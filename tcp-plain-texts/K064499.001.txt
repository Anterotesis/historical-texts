had never seen your Lordship I possessed no connection which could possibly recommend me to your favour I was known to you only by my endeavours in common with  many others to discharge my duty as a tutor in the University and by some very imperfect but certainly well intended and as you thought useful publications since In an age by no means wanting in examples os honourable patronage although this deserve not to be mentioned in respect of the object of your Lordship's choice it is inferior to none in the purity and disinterestedness of the motives which suggested it  How the following work may be received I pretend not to foretell My first prayer concerning it is that it may do good to any my second hope that it may assist what it hath always been my earnest wish to promote the religious part of an academical education If in this latter view it might seem in any degree to excuse your Lordship's  judgment of its author I shall be gratified by the reflection that to a kindness flowing from public principles I have made the best public return in my power  In the mean time and in every event I rejoice in the opportunity here afforded me of testifying the sense I entertain of

Preparatory Considerations  I DEEM it unnecessary to prove that mankind stood in need of a revelation because I have met with no serious person who thinks that even under the Christian revelation we have too much light or any degree of assurance which is superfluous I desire moreover that in judging of Christianity it may be remembered that the question lies between this religion and none for if the Christian religion be not credible no one with whom we have to do will support the pretensions of any other  Suppose then the world we live in to have had a Creator suppose it to appear from  the predominant aim and tendency of the provisions and contrivances observable in the universe that the Deity when he formed it consulted for the happiness of his sensitive creation suppose the disposition which dietated this council to continue suppose a part of the creation to have received faculties from their Maker by which they are capable of rendering a moral obedience to his will and of voluntarily pursuing any end for which he has designed them suppose the Creator to intend for these his rational and accountable agents a second state of existence in which their situation will be regulated by their behaviour in the first state by which supposition and by no other the objection to the Divine government in not putting a difference between the good and the bad and the inconsistency of this confusion with the care and benevolence discoverable in the works of the Deity is done away suppose it to be of the utmost importance to the subjects of this dispensation to know what is intended f  r them that is suppose the knowledge of it to be highly conducive to the  happiness of the species a purpose which so many provisions of nature are calculated to promote Suppose nevertheless almost the whole race either by the imperfection of their faculties the misfortune of their situation or by the loss of some prior revelation to want this knowledge and not to be likely without the aid of a new revelation to attain it under these circumstances is it improbable that a revelation should be made Is it incredible that God should interpose for such a purpose Suppose him to design for mankind a future state is it unlikely that he should acquaint them with it  Now in what way can a revelation be made but by miracles In none which we are able to conceive Consequently in whatever degree it is probable or not very improbable that a revelation should be communicated to mankind at all in the same degree is it probable or not very improbable that miracles should be wrought Therefore when miracles are related to have been wrought in the promulgating of a revelation  manifestly wanted and if true of inestimable value the improbability which arises from the miraculous nature of the things related is not greater than the original improbability that such a revelation should be imparted by God  I wish it however to be correctly understood in what manner and to what extent this argument is alledged We do not assume the attributes of the Deity or the existence of a future state in order to  prove  the reality of miracles That reality always must be proved by evidence We assert only that in miracles adduced in support of revelation there is not any such antecedent improbability as no testimony can surmount And for the purpose of maintaining this assertion we contend that the incredibility of miracles related to have been wrought in attestation of a message from God conveying intelligence of a future state of rewards and punishments and teaching mankind how to prepare themselves for that state is not in itself greater than the  event call it either probable or improbable of the two following propositions being true namely first that a future state of existence should be destined by God for his human creation and secondly that being so destined he should acquaint them with it It is not necessary for our purpose that these propositions be capable of proof or even that by arguments drawn from the light of nature they can be made out to be probable It is enough that we are able to say concerning them that they are not so violently improbable so contradictory to what we already believe of the Divine power and character that either the propositions themselves or facts strictly connected with the propositions and therefore no farther improbable than they are improbable ought to be rejected at first sight and to be rejected by whatever strength or complication of evidence they be attested  This is the prejudication we would resist For to this length does a modern objection to miracles go viz that no human  testimony can in any case render them credible I think the reflection above stated that if there be a revelation there must be miracles and that under the circumstances in which the human species are placed a revelation is not improbable or not improbable in any great degree to be a fair answer to the whole objection  But since it is an objection which stands in the very threshold of our argument and if admitted is a bar to every proof and to all future reasoning upon the subject it may be necessary before we proceed farther to examine the principle upon which it professes to be founded which principle is concisely this that it is contrary to experience that a miracle should be true but not contrary to experience that testimony should be false  Now there appears a small ambiguity in the term "experience" and in the phrases "contrary to experience" or "contradicting experience" which it may be necessary  to remove in the first place Strictly speaking the narrative of a fact is  then  only contrary to experience when the fact is related to have existed at a time and place at which time and place we being present did not perceive it to exist as if it should be asserted that in a particular room and at a particular hour of a certain day a man was raised from the dead in which room and at the time specified we being present and looking on perceived no such event to have taken place Here the assertion is contrary to experience properly so called and this is a contrariety which no evidence can surmount It matters nothing whether the fact be of a miraculous nature or not But although this be the experience and the contrariety which Archbishop Tillotson alledged in the quotation with which Mr Hume opens his essay it is certainly not that experience nor that contrariety which Mr Hume himself intended to object And short of this I know no intelligible signification which can be affixed to the term "contrary to experience" but one viz that of not having  ourselves experienced any thing similar to the thing related or such things not being generally experienced by others I say not "generally" for to state concerning the fact in question that no such thing was  ever  experienced or that  universal  experience is against it is to assume the subject of the controversy  Now the improbability which arises from the want for this properly is a want not a contradiction of experience is only equal to the probability there is that if the thing were true we should experience things similar to it or that such things would be generally experienced Suppose it then to be true that miracles were wrought upon the first promulgation of Christianity when nothing but miracles could decide its authority is it certain that such miracles would be repeated so often and in so many places as to become objects of general experience Is it a probability approaching to certainty Is it a probability of any great strength or force Is it such as no evidence can encounter  and yet this probability is the exact  converse  and therefore the exact measure of the improbability which arises from the want of experience and which Mr Hume represents as invincible by human testimony  It is not like alledging a new law of nature or a new experiment in natural philosophy because when these are related it is expected that under the same circumstances the same effect will follow universally and in proportion as this expectation is justly entertained the want of a corresponding experience negatives the history But to expect concerning a miracle that it should succeed upon repetition is to expect that which would make it cease to be a miracle which is contrary to its nature as such and would totally destroy the use and purpose for which it was wrought  The force of experience as an objection to miracles is founded in the presumption either that the course of nature is invariable  or that is it be ever varied variations will be frequent and general Has the necessity of this alternative been demonstrated Permit us to call the course of nature the agency of an intelligent Being and is there any good reason for judging this state of the case to be probable Ought we not rather to expect that such a Being upon occasions of peculiar importance may interrupt the order which he had appointed yet that such occasions should return seldom that these interruptions consequently should be consined to the experience of a sew that the want of it therefore in many should be matter neither of surprise nor objection  But as a continuation of the argument from experience it is said that when we advance accounts of miracles we assign effects without causes or we attribute effects to causes inadequate to the purpose or to causes of the operation of which we have no experience Of what causes we may ask and of what effects does the objection speak If it be answered that when we ascribe the  cure of the palsy to a touch of blindness to the anointing of the eyes with clay or the raising of the dead to a word we lay ourselves open to this imputation we reply that we ascribe no such effects to such causes We perceive no virtue or energy in these things more than in other things of the same kind They are merely signs to connect the miracle with its end The effect we ascribe simply to the volition of the Deity of whose existence and power not to say of whose presence and agency we have previous and independent proof We have therefore all we seek for in the works of rational agents a sufficient power and an adequate motive In a word once believe that there is a God and miracles are not incredible  Mr Hume states the case of miracles to be a contest of opposite improbabilities that is to say a question whether it be more improbable that the miracle should be true or the testimony false and this I think a fair account of the controversy But herein I remark a want of argumentative justice that  in describing the improbability of miracles he suppresses all those circumstances of extenuation which result from our knowledge of the existence power and disposition of the Deity his concern in the creation the end answered by the miracle the importance of that end and its subserviency to the plan pursued in the works of nature As Mr Hume has represented the question miracles are alike incredible to him who is previously assured of the constant agency of a divine Being and to him who believes that no such Being exists in the universe They are equally incredible whether related to have been wrought upon occasions the most deserving and for purposes the most beneficial or for no assignable end whatever or for an end confessedly trifling or pernicious This surely cannot be a correct statement In adjusting also the other side of the balance the strength and weight of testimony this author has provided an answer to every possible accumulation of historical proof by telling us that we are not obliged to explain how the story or the evidence  arose Now I think that we  are  obliged not perhaps to shew by positive accounts how it did but by a probable hypothesis how it might so happen The existence of the testimony is a phenomenon The truth of the fact solves the phenomenon If we reject this solution we ought to have some other to rest in and none even by our adversaries can be admitted which is not consistent with the principles that regulate human affairs and human conduct at present or which makes men  them  to have been a different kind of beings from what they are now  But the short consideration which independently of every other convinces me that there is no solid foundation in Mr Hume's conclusion is the following When a theorem is proposed to a mathematician the first thing he does with it is to try it upon a simple case and if it produce a false result he is sure that there must be some mistake in the demonstration Now to proceed in this way with what may be called  Mr Hume's theorem If twelve men whose probity and good sense I had long known should seriously and circumstantially relate to me an account of a miracle wrought before their eyes and in which it was impossible that they should be deceived if the governor of the country hearing a rumour of this account should call these men into his presence and offer them a short proposal either to confess the imposture or submit to be tied up to a gibbet if they should refuse with one voice to acknowledge that there existed any falsehood or imposture in the case if this threat were communicated to them separately yet with no different effect if it was at last executed if I myself saw them one after another consenting to be racked burnt or strangled rather than give up the truth of their account still if Mr Hume's rule be my guide I am not to believe them Now I undertake to say that there exists not a sceptic in the world who would not believe them or who would defend such incredulity  Instances of spurious miracles supported by strong apparent testimony undoubtedly demand examination Mr Hume has endeavoured to fortisy his argument by some examples of this kind I hope in a proper place to show that none of them reach the strength or circumstances of the Christian evidence In these however consists the weight of his objection In the principle itself I am persuaded there is none  PART I  OF THE DIRECT HISTORICAL EVIDENCE OF CHRISTIANITY AND WHEREIN IT IS DISTINGUISHED FROM THE EVIDENCE ALLEDGED FOR OTHER MIRACLES  THE two propositions which I shall endeavour to establish are these  I That there is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motive to new rules of conduct  II That there is  not  satisfactory evidence that persons professing to be original witnesses of other miracles in their nature as certain as these are have ever acted in the same manner in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and properly in consequence of their belief of those accounts  The first of these propositions as it forms the argument will stand at the head of the following  nine  chapters  CHAP I  There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motives to new rules of conduct  To support this proposition two points are necessary to be made out first that the founder of the institution his associates and immediate followers acted the part which the proposition imputes to them secondly that they did so in attestation of the miraculous history recorded in our scriptures and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of this history  Before we produce any particular testimony  to the activity and sufferings which compose the subject of our first assertion it will be proper to consider the degree of probability which the assertion derives from the  nature of the case  that is by inferences from those parts of the case which in point of fact are on all hands acknowledged  First then the Christian religion exists and therefore by some means or other was established Now it either owes the principle of its establishment  i e  its first publication to the activity of the person who was the founder of the institution and of those who were joined with him in the undertaking or we are driven upon the strange supposition that although they might lie by others would take it up although they were quiet and silent other persons busied themselves in the success and propagation of their story This is perfectly incredible To me it appears little less than certain that if the first announcing of the religion by the founder had not been followed up by the zeal and industry of his immediate disciples  the attempt must have expired in its birth Then as to the kind and degree of exertion which was employed and the mode of life to which these persons submitted we reasonably suppose it to be like that which we observe in all others who voluntarily become missionaries of a new faith Frequent earnest and laborious preaching constantly conversing with religious persons upon religion a sequestration from the common pleasures engagements and varieties of life and an addiction to one serious object compose the habits of such men I do not say that this mode of life is without enjoyment but I say that the enjoyment springs from sincerity With a consciousness at the bottom of hollowness and falsehood the fatigue and restraint would become insupportable I am apt to believe that very few hypocrites engage in these undertakings or however persist in them long Ordinarily speaking nothing can overcome the indolence of mankind the love which is natural to most tempers of chearful society and chearful scenes or the desire which is  common to all of personal ease and freedom but conviction  Secondly it is also highly probable from the nature of the case that the propagation of the new religion was attended with dissiculty and danger As addressed to the Jews it was a system adverse not only to their habitual opinions but to those opinions upon which their hopes their partialities their pride their consolation was founded This people with or without reason had worked themselves into a persuasion that some signal and greatly advantageous change was to be effected in the condition of their country by the agency of a longpromised messenger from heaven  "Pererebuerat oriente toto vetus et constans opinio esse in fatis ut eo tempore Judaeâ profecti rerum potirentur" Sueton Vespasian cap  "Pluribus persuasio inerat antiquis sacerdotum literis contineri co ipso tempore sore ut valesceret oriens prosectique Judaeâ rerum potirentur" Tacit Hist lib v cap  The rulers of the Jews their leading sect their  priesthood had been the authors of this persuasion to the common people So that it was not merely the conjecture of theoretical divines or the secret expectation of a few recluse devotees but it was become the popular hope and passion and like all popular opinions undoubting and impatient of contradiction They clung to this hope under every misfortune of their country and with more tenacity as their dangers or calamities increased To find therefore that expectations so gratifying were to be worse than disappointed that they were to end in the diffusion of a mild unambitious religion which instead of victories and triumphs instead of exalting their nation and institution above the rest of the world was to advance those whom they despised to an equality with themselves in those very points of comparison in which they most valued their own distinction could be no very pleasing discovery to a Jewish mind nor could the messengers of such intelligence expect to be well received or easily credited The doctrine was equally harsh and novel  The extending of the kingdom of God to those who did not conform to the law of Moses was a notion that had never before entered into the thoughts of a Jew  The character of the new institution was in other respects also ungrateful to Jewish habits and principles Their own religion was in a high degree technical Even the enlightened Jew placed a great deal of stress upon the ceremonies of his law saw in them a great deal of virtue and efficacy the gross and vulgar had scarcely any thing else and the hypocritical and ostentatious magnified them above measure as being the instruments of their own reputation and influence The Christian scheme without formally repealing the Levitical code lowered its estimation extremely In the place of strictness and zeal in performing the observances which that code prescribed or which tradition had added to it the new sect preached up faith wellregulated affections inward purity and moral rectitude of disposition as the true ground on the part of the  worshlpper of merit and acceptance with God This however rational it may appear or recommending to us at present did not by any means facilitate the plan then On the contrary to disparage those qualities which the highest characters in the country valued themselves most upon was a sure way of making powerful enemies As if the frustration of the national hope was not enough the longesteemed merit of ritual zeal and punctuality was to be decried and that by Jews preaching to Jews  The ruling party at Jerusalem had just before crucified the founder of the religion That is a fact which will not be disputed They therefore who stood forth to preach the religion must necessarily reproach these rulers with an execution which they could not but represent as an unjust and cruel murder This would not render their office more easy or their situation more safe  With regard to the interference of the  Roman government which was then established in Judea I should not expect that despising as it did the religion of the country it would if left to itself animadvert either with much vigilance or much severity upon the schisms and controversies which arose within it Yet there was that in Christianity which might easily afford a handle of accusation with a jealous government The Christians avowed an unqualified obedience to a new master They avowed also that he was the person who had been foretold to the Jews under the suspected title of King The spiritual nature of this kingdom the consistency of this obedience with civil subjection were distinctions too refined to be entertained by a Roman president who viewed the business at a great distance or through the medium of very hostile representations Our histories accordingly inform us that this was the turn which the enemies of Jesus gave to his character and pretensions in their remonstrances with Pontius Pilate And Justin Martyr about a hundred years afterwards complains  that the same mistake prevailed in his time "ye having heard that we are waiting for a kingdom suppose without distinguishing that we mean a human kingdom when in truth we speak of that which is with God  Ap  me  p ed Thirl  " And it was undoubtedly a natural source of calumny and misconstruction  The preachers therefore of Christianity had to contend with prejudice backed by power They had to come forward to a disappointed people to a priesthood possessing a considerable share of municipal authority and actuated by strong motives of opposition and resentment and they had to do this under a foreign government to whose favour they made no pretensions and which was constantly surrounded by their enemics The well known because the experienced fate of reformers whenever the reformation subverts some reigning opinion and does not proceed upon a change already taken place in the sentiments of a country will  not allow much less lead us to suppose that the first propagators of Christianity at Jerusalem and in Judea with the difficulties and the enemies which they had to contend with and entirely destitute as they were of force authority or protection could execute their mission with personal ease and safety  Let us next enquire what might reasonably be expected by the preachers of Christianity when they turned themselves to the heathen public Now the first thing that strikes us is that the religion they carried with them was  exclusive  It denied without reserve the truth of every article of heathen mythology the existence of every object of their worship It accepted no compromise it admitted no comprehension It must prevail if it prevailed at all by the overthrow of every statue altar and temple in the world It will not easily be credited that a design so bold as this was could in any age be attempted to be carried into execution with impunity  For it ought to be considered that this was not setting forth or magnifying the character and worship of some new competitor for a place in the Pantheon whose pretensions might be discussed or afferted without questioning the reality of any others It was pronouncing all other gods to be false and all other worship vain From the facility with which the Polytheism of ancient nations admitted new objects of worship into the number of their acknowledged divinities or the patience with which they might entertain proposals of this kind we can argue nothing as to their toleration of a system or of the publishers and active propagators of a system which swept away the very foundation of the existing establishment The one was nothing more than what it would be in Popish countries to add a saint to the calendar the other was to abolish and tread under foot the calendar itself  Secondly it ought also to be considered that this was not the case of philosophers  propounding in their books or in their schools doubts concerning the truth of the popular creed or even avowing their disbelief of it These philosophers did not go about from place to place to collect proselytes from amongst the commonpeople to form in the heart of the country societies professing their tenets to provide for the order instruction and permanency of these societies nor did they enjoin their followers to withdraw themselves from the public worship of the temples or refuse a compliance with rites instituted by the laws  The best of the ancient philosophers Plato Cicero and Epictetus allowed or rather enjoined men to worship the gods of the country and in the established form See passages to this purpose collected from their works by Dr Clarke Nat and Rev Rel p ed v Except Socrates they all thought it wiser to comply with the laws than to contend  These things are what the Christians did and what the philosophers did not and in these consisted the activity and danger of the enterprise  Thirdly it ought also to be considered  that this danger proceeded not merely from solemn acts and public resolutions of the state but from sudden bursts of violence at particular places from the licence of the populace the rashness of some magistrates and the negligence of others from the influence and instigation of interested adversaries and in general from the variety and warmth of opinion which an errand so novel and extraordinary could not fail of exciting I can conceive that the teachers of Christianity might both fear and susser much from these causes without any general persecution being denouncedag a inst them by imperial authority Some length of time I should suppose might pass before the vast machine of the Roman empire would be put in motion or its attention be obtained to religious controversy but during that time a great deal of ill usage might be endured by a set of friendless unprotected travellers telling men wherever they came that the religion of their ancestors the religion in which they had been brought up the religion of  the state and of the magistrate the rites which they frequented the pomp which they admired was throughout a system of folly and delusion  Nor do I think that the teachers of Christianity would sind protection in that general disbelief of the popular theology which is supposed to have prevailed amongst the intelligent part of the heathen public It is by no means true that unbelievers are usually tolerant They are not disposed and why should they to endanger the present state of things by suffering a religion of which they believe nothing to be disturbed by another of which they believe as little They are ready themselves to conform to any thing and are oftentimes amongst the foremost to procure conformity from others by any method which they think likely to be essicacious When was ever a change of religion patronized by insidels How little notwithstanding the reigning scepticism and the magnified liberality of that age the true  principles of toleration were understood by the wisest men amongst them may be gathered from two eminent and uncontested examples The younger Pliny polished as he was by all the literature of that soft and elegant period could gravely pronounce this monstroiis judgment "Those who persisted in declaring themselves Christians I ordered to be led away to punishment  i e  to execution for I DID NOT DOUBT  whatever it was that they confessed that contumacy and inflexible obstinacy ought to be punished"  His master Trajan a mild and accomplished prince went nevertheless no farther in his sentiments of moderation and equity than what appears in the following rescript "The Christians are not to be sought for but if any are brought before you and convicted they are to be punished" And this direction he gives after it had been reported to him by his own president that by the most strict examination nothing could be discovered in the principles of these persons but "a bad and excessive superstition" accompanied it  seems with an oath or mutual federation "to allow themselves in no crime or immoral conduct whatever" The truth is the ancient heathens considered religion entirely as an affair of state as much under the tuition of the magistrate as any other part of the police The religion of that age was not merely allied to the state it was incorporated into it Many of its offices were administered by the magistrate Its titles of pontiffs augurs and flamens were borne by senators consuls and generals Without discussing therefore the truth of the theology they resented every affront put upon the established worship as a direct opposition to the authority of government  Add to which that the religious systems of those times however ill supported by evidence had been long established The  ancient  religion of a country has always many votaries and sometimes not the fewer because its origin is hidden in remoteness and obscurity Men have a natural veneration  for antiquity especially in matters of religion What Tacitus says of the Jewish was more applicable to the heathen establishment "hi ritus quoquo modo inducti antiquitate defenduntur" It was also a splendid and sumptuous worship It had its priesthood its endowments its temples Statuary painting architecture and music contributed their effect to its ornament and magnificence It abounded in festival shows and solemnities to which the common people are greatly addicted and which were of a nature to engage them much more than any thing of that sort among us These things would retain great numbers on its side by the fascination of spectacle and pomp as well as interest many in its preservation by the advantage which they drew from it "It was moreover interwoven" as Mr Gibbons rightly repres  t it "with every circumstance of business or pleasure of public or private life with all the offices and amusements of society" Upon the due celebration also of its rites the people were taught to believe and did beli  ve that the  prosperity of their country in a great measure depended  I am willing to accept the account of the matter which is given by Mr Gibbon "The various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world were all considered by the people as equally true by the philosophers as equally false and by the magistrate as equally useful" and I would ask from which of these three classes of men were the Christian missionaries to look for protection or impunity Could they expect it from the people "whose acknowledged considence in the public religion" they subverted from its foundation from the philosopher who "considering all religions as equally false" would of course rank theirs amongst the number with the addition of regarding them as busy and troublesome zealots or from the magistrate who satisfied with the "utility" of the subsisting religion would not be likely to countenance a spirit of proselytism and innovation a system which declared war against  every other and which if it prevailed must end in a total rupture of public opinion an upstart religion in a word which was not content with its own authority but must disgrace all the settled religions of the world It was not to be imagined that he would endure with patience that the religion of the emperor and of the state should be calumniated and borne down by a company of superstitious and despicable Jews  Lastly the  nature of the case  affords a strong proof that the original teachers of Christianity in consequence of their new profession entered upon a new and singular course of life We may be allowed to presume that the institution which they preached to others they conformed to in their own persons because this is no more than what every teacher of a new religion both does and must do in order to obtain either proselytes or hearers The change which this would produce was very considerable It is a change which we do not easily estimate because ourselves and all about us  being habituated to the institution from our infancy it is what we neither experience nor observe After men became Christians much of their time was spent in prayer and devotion in religious meetings in celebrating the eucharist in conferences in exhortations in preaching in an affectionate intercourse with one another and correspondence with other societies Perhaps their mode of life in its form and habit was not very unlike the Unitas Fratrum or of modern Methodists Think then what it was to become  such  at Corinth at Ephesus at Antioch or even at Jerusalem How new How aliene from all their former habits and ideas and from those of every body about them What a revolution there must have been of opinions and prejudices to bring the matter to this  We know what the precepts of the religion are how pure how benevolent how disinterested a conduct they enjoin and that this purity and benevolence is extended to the very thoughts and affections We  are not perhaps at liberty to take for granted that the lives of the preachers of Christianity were as perfect as their lessons but we are entitled to contend that the observable part of their behaviour must have agreed in a great measure with the duties which they taught There was therefore which is all that we assert a course of life pursued by them different from that which they before led And this is of great importance Men are brought to any thing almost sooner than to change their habit of life especially when the change is either inconvenient or made against the force of natural inclination or with the loss of accustomed indulgences "It is the most difficult of all things to convert men from vicious habits to virtuous ones as every one may judge from what he seels in himself as well as from what he sees in others  Hartley's Ess on Man p  " It is almost like making men over again  Left then to myself and without any  more information than a knowledge of the existence of the religion of the general story upon which it is founded and that no act of power force or authority was concerned in its first success I should conclude from the very nature and exigency of the case that the author of the religion during his life and his immediate disciples after his death  exerled  themselves in spreading and publishing the institution throughout the country in which it began and into which it was first carried that in the prosecution of this purpose they underwent the labours and troubles which we observe the propagators of new sects to undergo that the attempt must necessarily have also been in a high degree dangerous that from the subject of the mission compared with the fixed opinions and prejudices of those to whom the missionaries were to address themselves they could hardly fail of encountering strong and srequent opposition that by the hand of government as well as from the sudden sury and unbridled licence of the people they would oftentimes experience injurious  and cruel treatment that at any rate they must have always had so much to fear for their personal safety as to have passed their lives in a state of constant peril and anxiety and lastly that their mode of life and conduct visibly at least corresponded with the institution which they delivered and so far was both new and required continual selfdenial  CHAP II  There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of these accounts and that they also submitted from the same motive to new rules of conduct  AFTER thus considering what was  likely  to happen we are next to enquire how the transaction is represented in the several accounts that have come down to us And this enquiry is properly preceded by the other forasmuch as the reception of these accounts may depend in part upon the credibility of what they contain  The obscure and distant view of Christianity  which some of the heathen writers of that age had gained and which a few passages in their remaining works incidentally discover to us offers itself to our notice in the first place because so far as this evidence goes it is the concession of adversaries the source from which it is drawn is unsuspected Under this head a quotation from Tacitus well known to every scholar must be inserted as deserving of particular attention The Reader will bear in mind that this passage was written about seventy years after Christ's death and that it relates to transactions which took place about thirty years after that event Speaking of the fire which happened at Rome in the time of Nero and of the suspicions which were entertained that the emperor himself was concerned in causing it the historian proceeds in his narrative and observations thus  "But neither these exertions nor his largesses to the people nor his offerings to the gods did away the infamous imputation  under which Nero lay of having ordered the city to be set on fire To put an end therefore to this report he laid the guilt and inflicted the most cruel punishments upon a set of people who were held in abhorrence for their crimes and called by the vulgar  Christians  The founder of that name was Christ who suffered death in the reign of Tiberius under his procurator Pontius PilateThis pernicious superstition thus checked for a while broke out again and spread not only over Judea where the evil originated but through Rome also whither every thing bad upon earth finds its way and is practised Some who confessed their sect were first seized and afterwards by their information a vast multitude were apprehended who were convicted not so much of the crime of burning Rome as of hatred to mankind Their sufferings at their execution were aggravated by insult and mockery for some were disguised in the skins of wild beasts and worried to death by dogssome were crucifiedand others  were wrapt in pitched shirts  This is rather a paraphrase but is justified by what the Scholiast upon Juvenal says"Nero malesicos homines tedâ et papyro et cerâ supervestiebat et sic ad ignem admoveri jubebat" Lard Jewish and Heath Test vol i p  and set on fire when the day closed that they might serve as lights to illuminate the night Nero lent his own gardens for these executions and exhibited at the same time a mock Circensian entertainment being a spectator of the whole in the dress of a charioteer sometimes mingling with the crowd on foot and sometimes viewing the spectacles from his car This conduct made the susserers pitied and though they were criminals and deserving the severest punishment yet they were considered as sacrisiced not so much out of a regard to the public good as to gratify the cruelty of one man"  Our concern with this passage at present is only so far as it affords a presumption in support of the proposition which we maintain concerning the activity and sufferings  of the first teachers of Christianity Now considered in this view it proves three things st that the founder of the institution was put to death dly that in the same country in which he was put to death the religion after a short check broke out again and spread dly that it so spread as that within thirtyfour years from the author's death a very great number of Christians ingens eorum multitudo were found at Rome From which fact the two following inferences may be fairly drawn first that if in the space of thirtyfour years from its commencement the religion had spread throughout Judea had extended itself to Rome and there had numbered a great multitude of converts the original teachers and missionaries of the institution could not have been  idle  secondly that when the author of the undertaking was put to death as a malefactor for his attempt the endeavours of his followers to establish his religion in the same country amongst the same people and in the same age could not but be attended with danger  Suetonius a writer contemporary with Tacitus describing the transactions of the same reign uses these words "Affecti suppliciis Christiani genus hominum superstitionis novae et malesicae  Suet Nero cap  " "The Christians a set of men of a new and mischievous or magical superstition were punished"  Since it is not mentioned  here  that the burning of the city was the pretence of the punishment of the Christians or that they were the Christians of Rome who alone suffered it is probable that Suetonius refers to some more general persecution than the short and occasional one which Tacitus describes  Juvenal a writer of the same age with the two former and intending as it should seem to commemorate the cruelties exercised under Nero's government has the following lines  Sat ver    "Pone Tigellinum tedâ lucebis in illâ  Quâ stantes ardent qui sixo gutture fumant  Et latum mediâ sulcum  Forsan "deducis"  deducit arenâ"  "Describe Tigellinus a creature of Nero's and you shall suffer the same punishment with those who stand burning in their own slame and smoke their head being held up by a stake fixed to their chin till they make a long stream of blood and melted sulphur on the ground"  If this passage were considered by itself the subject of the allusion might be doubtful but when connected with the testimony of Suetonius as to the actual punishment of the Christians by Nero and with the account given by Tacitus of the  species  of punishment which they were made to undergo I think it sufficiently probable that these were the executions to which the poet refers  These things as hath already been observed  took place within thirtyone years after Christ's death that is according to the course of nature in the lifetime probably of some of the apostles and certainly in the lifetime of those who were converted by the apostles or who were converted in their time If then the founder of the religion was put to death in the execution of his design if the first race of converts to the religion many of them suffered the greatest extremities for their profession it is hardly credible that those who came  between  the two who were companions of the author of the institution during his life and the teachers and propagators of the institution after his death could go about their undertaking with ease and safety  The testimony of the younger Pliny belongs to a later period for although he was contemporary with Tacitus and Suetonius yet his account does not like theirs go back to the transactions of Nero's reign but is confined to the affairs of his own time His celebrated letter to Trajan was written  about seventy years after Christ's death and the information to be drawn from it so far as it is connected with our argument relates principally to two points first to the  number  of Christians in Bithynia and Pontus which was so considerable as to induce the governor of these provinces to speak of them in the following terms "Multi omnis aetatis utriusque sexûs etiamneque enim civitates tantum sed vicos etiam et agros superstitionis istius contagio pervagata est" "There are many of every age and of both sexesnor has the contagion of this superstition seized cities only but smaller towns also and the open country" Great exertions must have been used by the preachers of Christianity to produce this state of things within this time Secondly to a point which hath been already noticed and which I think of importance to be observed namely the sufferings to which Christians were exposed  without  any public persecution being denounced against them by sovereign authority For from Pliny's doubt how he was to act his silence  concerning any subsisting law upon the subject his requesting the emperor's rescript and the emperor agreeably to his request propounding a rule for his direction without reference to any prior rule it may be inferred that there was at that time no public edict against the Christians in force Yet from this same epistle of Pliny it appears "that accusations trials and examinations were and had been going on against them in the provinces over which he presided that schedules were delivered by anonymous informers containing the names of persons who were suspected of holding or of favouring the religion that in consequence of these informations many had been apprehended of whom some boldly avowed their profession and died in the cause others denied that they were Christians others acknowledging that they had once been Christians declared that they had long ceased to be such" All which demonstrates that the profession of Christianity was at that time in that country at least attended with fear and danger and yet this  took place without any edict from the Roman sovereign commanding or authorizing the persecution of Christians This observation is farther consirmed by a rescript of Adrian to Minucius Fundanus the proconsul of Asia  Lard Heath Test v ii p  from which rescript it appears that the custom of the people of Asia was to proceed against the Christians with tumult and uproar This disorderly practice I say is recognized in the edict because the emperor enjoins that for the future if the Christians were guilty they should be legally brought to trial and not be pursued by importunity and clamour  Martial wrote a few years before the younger Pliny and as his manner was made the sufferings of the Christians the subject of his ridicule  In matutinâ nuper spectatus arenâ Mucius imposuit qui sua membra focis Si patiens fortisque tibi durusque videtur Abderitanae pectora plebis habes Nam cum dicatur tunicâ praesente molestâ Ure  Forsan "thure manum"  manum plus est dicere non facio  Nothing however  could shew the notoriety of the fact with more certainty than this does Martial's testimony as well indeed as Pliny's goes also to another point viz that the deaths of these men were martyrdoms in the strictest sense that is to say were so voluntary that it was in their power at the time of pronouncing the sentence to have averted the execution by consenting to join in heathen sacrisices  The constancy and by consequence the sufferings of the Christians of this period is also referred to by Epictetus who imputes their intrepidity to madness or to a kind of fashion or habit and about fifty years afterwards by Marcus Aurelius who ascribes it to obstinacy "Is it possible Epictetus asks that a man may arrive at this temper and become indifferent to those things from  madness or from habit  as the Galileans  Epic I iv c  " "Let this preparation of the mind to die arise from its own judgment and not from obstinacy  like the Christians  Marc Aur Med I xi c  "  CHAP III  There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motive to new rules of conduct  OF the primitive condition of Christianity a distant only and general view can be acquired from heathen writers It is in our own books that the detail and interior of the transaction must be sought for And this is nothing different from what might be expected Who would write a history of Christianity but a Christian Who was likely to record the travels sufferings labours or successes of the apostles but one of their own number or of their followers Now  these books come up in their accounts to the full extent of the proposition which we maintain We have four histories of Jesus Christ We have a history taking up the narrative from his death and carrying on an account of the propagation of the religion and of some of the most eminent persons engaged in it for a space of nearly thirty years We have what some may think still more original a collection of letters written by certain principal agents in the business upon the business and in the midst of their concern and connection with it And we have these writings severally attesting the point which we contend for viz the sufferings of the witnesses of the history and attesting it in every variety of form in which it can be conceived to appear directly and indirectly expressly and incidentally by assertion recital and allusion by narratives of facts and by arguments and discourses built upon these facts either referring to them or necessarily presupposing them  I remark this variety because in examining  ancient records or indeed any species of testimony it is in my opinion of the greatest importance to attend to the information or grounds of argument which are  casually  and  undesignedly  disclosed forasmuch as this species of proof is of all others the least liable to be corrupted by fraud or misrepresentation  I may be allowed therefore in the enquiry which is now before us to suggest some conclusions of this sort as preparatory to more direct testimony  Our books relate that Jesus Christ the founder of the religion was in consequence of his undertaking put to death as a malefactor at Jerusalem This point at least will be granted because it is no more than what Tacitus has recorded They then proceed to tell us that the religion was  notwithstanding  set forth at this same city of Jerusalem propagated from thence throughout Judea and afterwards preached in other parts of the Roman cmpire These points also  are fully confirmed by Tacitus who informs us that the religion after a short check broke out again in the country where it took its rise that it not only spread throughout Judea but had reached Rome and that it had there great multitudes of converts and all this within thirty years after its commencement Now these facts afford a strong inference in behalf of the proposition which we maintain What could the disciples of Christ expect for themselves when they saw their master put to death Could they hope to escape the dangers in which he had perished If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you was the warning of common sense With this example before their eyes they could not be without a full sense of the peril of their future enterprise  Secondly all the histories agree in representing Christ as soretelling the persecution of his followers  "Then shall they dellver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and ye shall  be hated of all nations for my name's sake  Matt xxiv  "  "When affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended  Mark iv See also x  "  "They shall lay hands on you and persecute you delivering you up to the synagogues and into prisons being brought before kings and rulers for my name's sakeand ye shall be betrayed both by parents and brethren and kinsfolks and friends and some of you shall they cause to be put to death  Luke xxi See also xi  "  "The time cometh that he that killeth you will think that he doeth God service And these things will they do unto you because they have not known the father nor me But these things have I told you that when the time shall come ye may remember that I told you of them  John xvi See also xv and xvi  "  I am not entitled to argue from these passages that Christ actually did foretell these events and that they did accordingly come to pass because that would be at once to assume the truth of the religion but I am entitled to contend that one side or other of the following disjunction is true either that the evangelists have delivered what Christ really spoke and that the event corresponded with the prediction or that they put the prediction into Christ's mouth because at the time of writing the history the event had turned out so to be for the only two remaining suppositions appear in the highest degree incredible which are either that Christ silled the minds of his followers with fears and apprehensions without any reason or authority for what he said and contrary to the truth of the case or that although Christ had never foretold any such thing and the event would have contradicted him if he had yet historians who lived in the age when the event was known falsely as well as ossiciously ascribed these words to him  Thirdly these books abound with exhortations to patience and with topics of comfort under distress  "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword Nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us  Rom viii  "  "We are troubled on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodyknowing that he which raised up the Lord Jesus shall raise us up also by Jesus and shall present us with youfor which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our  light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory  Cor iv  "  "Take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience Behold we count them happy which endure Ye have heard of the patience of Job and have seen the end of the Lord that the Lord is very pitiful and of tender mercy  James v  "  "Call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated ye endured a great fight of afflictions partly whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring substance  Cast not away therefore your considence which hath great recompense of reward for ye have need of patience that after ye have done the will of God ye might receive the promise  Heb x  "  "So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that ye endure Which is a manifest token of the righteous judgment of God that ye may be accounted worthy of the kingdom for which ye also suffer  Thess i  "  "We rejoice in hope of the glory of God and not only so but we glory in tribulations also knowing that tribulation worketh patience and patience experience and experience hope  Rom v  "  "Beloved think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you but rejoice inasmuch as ye are  partakers of Christ's sufferings Wheresore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing as unto a faithful Creator  Pct iv  "  What could all these texts mean if there was nothing in the circumstances of the times which required patience which called for the exercise of constancy and resolution or will it be pretended that these exhortations which let it be observed come not from one author but from many were put in merely to induce a belief in afterages that the sirst Christians were exposed to dangers which they were not exposed to or underwent sufferings which they did not undergo If these books belong to the age to which they lay claim and in which age whether genuine or spurious they certainly did appear this supposition cannot be maintained for a moment because I think it impossible to believe that passages which must  be deemed not only unintelligible but false by the persons into whose hands the books upon their publication were to come should nevertheless be inserted for the purpose of producing an effect upon remote generations In forgeries which do not appear till many ages after that to which they pretend to belong it is possible that some contrivance of that sort may take place but in no others can it be attempted  CHAP IV  There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motives to new rules of conduct  THE account of the treatment of the religion and of the exertions of its first preachers as stated in our scriptures not in a professed history of persecutions or in the connected manner in which I am about to recite it but dispersedly and occasionally in the course of a mixed general history which circumstance alone negatives the supposition of any fraudulent design is the following "That the sounder of Christianity srom the commencement of his ministry to the  time of his violent death employed himself wholly in publishing the institution in Judea and Galilee that in order to assist him in this purpose he made choice out of the number of his followers of twelve persons who might accompany him as he travelled from place to place that except a short absence upon a journey in which he sent them two by two to announce his mission and one of a few days when they went before him to Jerusalem these persons were statedly and constantly attending upon him that they were with him at Jerusalem when he was apprehended and put to death and that they were commissioned by him when his own ministry was concluded to publish his gospel and collect disciples to it from all countries of the world" The account then proceeds to state "That a few days after his departure these persons with some of his relations and some who had regularly frequented their society assembled at Jerusalem that considering the ossice of preaching the religion as now devolved upon them and one of their number having deserted the  cause and repenting of his perfidy having destroyed himself they proceeded to elect another into his place and that they were careful to make their election out of the number of those who had accompanied their master from the first to the last in order as they alledged that he might be a witness together with themselves of the principal facts which they were about to produce and relate concerning him  Acts i  that they began their work at Jerusalem by publicly asserting that this Jesus whom the rulers and inhabitants of that place had so lately crucified was in truth the person in whom all their prophecies and long expectations terminated that he had been sent amongst them by God and that he was appointed by God the future judge of the human species that all who were solicitous to secure to themselves happiness after death ought to receive him as such and to make profession of their belief by being baptized in his name  Acts xi  " The history goes on to relate "that considerable  numbers accepted this proposal and that they who did so formed amongst themselves a strict union and society  Acts v  that the attention of the Jewish government being soon drawn upon them two of the principal persons of the twelve and who also had lived most intimately and constantly with the founder of the religion were seized as they were discoursing to the people in the temple that after being kept all night in prison they were brought the next day before an assembly composed of the chief persons of the Jewish magistracy and priesthood that this assembly after some consultation found nothing at that time better to be done towards suppressing the growth of the sect than to threaten their prisoners with punishment if they persisted that these men after expressing in decent but firm language the obligation under which they considered themselves to be to declare what they knew "to speak the things which they had seen and heard" returned from the council and  reported what had passed to their companions that this report whilst it apprized them of the danger of their situation and undertaking had no other effect upon their conduct than to produce in them a general resolution to persevere and an earnest prayer to God to furnish them with assistance and to inspire them with fortitude proportioned to the increasing exigency of the service  Acts iv  " A very short time after this we read "that all the twelve apostles were seized and cast into prison  Acts v  that being brought a second time before the Jewish Sanhedrim they were upbraided with their disobedience to the injunction which had been laid upon them and beaten for their contumacy that being charged once more to desist they were suffered to depart that however they neither quitted Jerusalem nor ceased from preaching both daily in the temple and from house to house  Acts v  and that the twelve considered themselves as so entirely and exclusively devoted to this office that they now transferred  what may be called the temporal affairs of the society to other hands  I do not know that it has ever been insinuated that the Christian mission in the hands of the apostles was a scheme for making a fortune or for getting money But it may nevertheless be fit to remark upon this passage of their history how perfectly free they appear to have been from any pecuniary or interested views whatever The most tempting opportunity which occurred of making a gain of their converts was by the custody and management of the public funds when some of the richer members intending to contribute their fortunes to the common support of the society sold their possessions and laid down the prices at the apostles' feet Yet so insensible or undesirous were they of the advantage which that confidence afforded that we find they very soon disposed of the trust by putting it into the hands not of nominees of their own but of stewards formally elected for the purpose by the society at large  We may add also that this excess of generosity which cast private property into the public stock was so far from being required by the apostles or imposed as a law of Christianity that Peter reminds Ananias that he had been guilty in his behaviour of an officious and voluntary prevarication for whilst says he thy estate remained unsold "was it not thine own and after it was fold was it not in thine own power"  "  Hitherto the preachers of the new religion seem to have had the common people on their side which is assigned as the reason why the Jewish rulers did not at this time think it prudent to proceed to greater extremities It was not long however before the enemies of the institution found means to represent it to the people as tending to subvert their law degrade their lawgiver and dishonour their temple  Acts vi  And these insinuations were dispersed with so much success as to induce the people to join with their superiors in the stoning of a very active member of the new community  The death of this man was the signal of a general persecution the activity of which may be judged of from one anecdote of the time "As for Saul he made havock of the church entering into every house and haling men and women committed them to prison" This persecution  Acts viii  raged at Jerusalem  with so much fury as to drive most  Acts viii "And they were  all  scattered abroad" but the term "all" is not I think to be taken strictly or as denoting more than the  generality  in like manner as in Acts ix "And  all  that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him and turned to the Lord"  of the new converts out of the place except the twelve apostles The converts thus "scattered abroad" preached the religion wherever they came and their preaching was in effect the preaching of the  twelve  for it was so far carried on in concert and correspondence with  them  that when they heard of the success of their emissaries in a particular country they sent two of their number to the place to complete and confirm the mission  An event now took place of great importance in the future history of the religion The  Acts ix  persecution which had begun at Jerusalem followed the Christians to other cities in which the authority of the Jewish  Sanhedrim over those of their own nation was allowed to be exercised A young man who had signalized himself by his hostility to the profession and had procured a commission from the council at Jerusalem to seize any converted Jews whom he might sind at Damascus suddenly became a proselyte to the religion which he was going about to extirpate The new convert not only shared upon this extraordinary change the sate of his companions but brought upon himself a double measure of enmity from the party which he had left The Jews at Damascus upon his return to that city watched the gates night and day with so much diligence that he escaped from their hands only by being let down in a basket by the wall Nor did he sind himself in greater safety at Jerusalem whither he immediately repaired Attempts were there also soon set on foot to destroy him srom the danger of which he was preserved by being sent away to Cilicia his native country  For some reason not mentioned perhaps  not known but probably connected with the civil history of the Jews or with some danger  Dr Lardner in which he is followed also by Dr Benson ascribes this cessation of the persecution of the Christians to the attempt of Caligula to set up his own statue in the Temple of Jerusalem and to the consternation thereby excited in the minds of the Jewish people which consternation for a season suspended every other contest  which engrossed the public attention an intermission about this time took place in the sufferings of the Christians This happened at the most only seven or eight perhaps only three or four years after Christ's death Within which period and notwithstanding that the late persecution occupied part of it churches or societies of believers had been formed in all Judea Galilee and Samaria for we read that the churches in these countries "had  now rest  and were edisied and walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost were multiplied  Acts ix  " The original preachers of the religion did not remit their  labours or activity during this season of quietness for we find one and he a very principal person amongst them passing throughout all quarters We find also those who had been before cxpelled from Jerusalem by the persecution which raged there travelling as far as Phoenice Cyprus and Antioch  Acts xi  and lastly we find Jerusalem again the centre of the mission the place whither the preachers returned from their several excursions where they reported the conduct and effects of their ministry where questions of public concern were canvassed and settled from whence directions were sought and teachers sent forth  The time of this tranquillity did not however continue long Herod Agrippa who had lately acceded to the government of Judea "stretched forth his hand to vex certain of the church  Acts xii  " He began his cruelty by beheading one of the twelve original apostles a kinsman and constant companion  of the founder of the religion Perceiving that this execution gratified the Jews he proceeded to seize in order to put to death another of the number and him like the former associated with Christ' during his life and eminently active in the service since his death This man was however delivered from prison as the account states  Acts xii  miraculously and made his escape from Jerusalem  These things are related not in the general terms under which in giving the outlines of the history we have here mentioned them but with the utmost particularity of names persons places and circumstances and what is deserving of notice without the smallest discoverable propensity in the historian to magnify the fortitude or exaggerate the sufferings of his party When they fled for their lives he tells us When the churches had rest he remarks it When the people took their part he does not leave  it without notice When the apostles were carried a second time before the S  nhedrim he is careful to observe that they were brought without violence When milder councils were suggested he gives us the author of the advice and the speech which contained it When in consequence of this advice the rulers contented themselves with threatening the apostles and commanding them to be beaten with stripes without urging at that time the persecution farther the historian candidly and distinctly records their forbearance When therefore in other instances he states heavier persecutions or actual martyrdoms it is reasonable to believe that he states them because they were true and not from any wish to aggravate in his account the sufferings which Christians sustained or to extol more than it deserved their patience under them  Our history now pursues a narrower path Leaving the rest of the apostles and the original associates of Christ engaged in the propagation of the new faith and who there is not the least reason to believe abated in  their diligence or courage the narrative proceeds with the separate memoirs of that eminent teacher whose extraordinary and sudden conversion to the religion and corresponding change of conduct had before been circumstantially described This person in conjunction with another who appeared amongst the earliest members of the society at Jerusalem and amongst the immediate adherents  Acts iv  of the twelve apostles set out from Antioch upon the express business of carrying the new religion through the various provinces of the Lesser Asia  Acts xiii  During this expedition we find that in almost every place to which they came their persons were insulted and their lives endangered After being expelled from Antioch in Pisidia they repaired to leonium  Acts xiii  At Iconium an attempt was made to stone them At Lystra whither they fled from Iconium one of them actually was stoned and drawn out of the city for dead  Acts xiv  These two men though not themselves original apostles were acting  in connection and conjunction with the original apostles for after the completion of their journey being sent upon a particular commission to Jerusalem they there related to the apostles  Acts xv  and elders the events and success of their ministry and were in return recommended by them to the churches "as men who had hazarded their lives in the cause"  The treatment which they had experienced in their first progress did not deter them from preparing for a second Upon a dispute however arising between them but not connected with the common subject of their labours they acted as wise and sincere men would act they did not retire in disgust from the service in which they were engaged but each devoting his endeavours to the advancement of the religion they parted from one another and set forwards upon separate routes The history goes along with one of them and the second enterprise to him was attended with the  same dangers and persecutions as both had met with in the first The apostle's travels hitherto had been consined to Asia He now crosses for the first time the Aegean Sea and carries with him amongst others the person whose accounts supply the information we are stating  Acts xvi  The first place in Greece at which he appears to have stopped was Philippi in Macedonia Here himself and one of his companions were cruelly whipped cast into prison and kept there under the most rigorous custody being thrust whilst yet smarting with their wounds into the inner dungeon and their fest made fast in the stocks  V  Notwithstanding this unequivocal specimen of the usage which they had to look for in that country they went forward in the execution of their errand After passing through Amphipolis and Appollonia they came to Thessalonica in which city the house in which they lodged was assailed by a party of their enemies in order to bring them out to the  populace And when fortunately for their preservation they were not found at home the master of the house was dragged before the magistrate for admitting them within his doors  Acts xvii  Their reception at the next city was something better but neither here had they continued long before their turbulent adversaries the Jews excited against them such commotions amongst the inhabitants as obliged the apostle to make his escape by a private journey to Athens  V  The extremity of the progress was Corinth His abode in this city for some time seems to have been without molestation At length however the Jews found means to stir up an insurrection against him and to bring him before the tribunal of the Roman president  Acts xviii  It was to the contempt which that magistrate entertained for the Jews and their controversies of which he accounted Christianity to be one that our apostle owed his deliverance  V    This indefatigable teacher after leaving Corinth returned by Ephesus into Syria and again visited Jerusalem and the society of Christians in that city which as hath been repeatedly observed still continued the center of the mission  Acts xviii  It suited not however with the activity of his zeal to remain long at Jerusalem We find him going from thence to Antioch and after some stay there traversing once more the northern provinces of Asia Minor  V  This progress ended at Ephesus in which city the apostle continued in the daily exercise of his ministry two years and until his success at length excited the apprehensions of those who were interested in the support of the national worship Their clamour produced a tumult in which he had nearly lost his life  Acts xix  Undismayed however by the dangers to which he saw himself exposed he was driven from Ephesus only to renew his labours in Greece  V  After passing over Macedonia he thence  proceeded to his former station at Corinth  Acts xix  When he had formed his design of returning by a direct course from Corinth into Syria he was compelled by a conspiracy of the Jews who were prepared to intercept him on his way to trace back his steps through Macedonia to Philippi and from thence to take shipping into Asia Along the coast of Asia he pursued his voyage with all the expedition he could command in order to reach Jerusalem against the feast of Pentecost  V  His reception at Jerusalem was of a piece with the usage he had experienced from the Jews in other places He had been only a few days in that city when the populace instigated by some of his old opponents in Asia who attended this feast seized him in the temple forced him out of it and were ready immediately to have destroyed him had not the sudden presence of the Roman guard rescued him out of their hands  Acts xxi  The officer however who had thus seasonably interposed acted from his  care of the public peace with the preservation of which he was charged and not from any favour to the apostle or indeed any disposition to exercise either justice or humanity towards him for he had no sooner secured his person in the fortress than he was proceeding to examine him by torture  Acts xxii    From this time to the conclusion of the history the apostle remains in public custody of the Roman government After escaping assassination by a fortunate discovery of the plot and delivering himself from the influence of his enemies by an appeal to the audience of the emperor  Acts xxv  he was sent but not until he had suffered two years imprisonment to Rome  Acts xxiv  He reached Italy after a tedious voyage and after encountering in his passage the perils of a desperate shipwreck  Acts xvii  But although still a prisoner and his fate still depending neither the various and longcontinued sufferings which he had  undergone nor the danger of his present situation deterred him from persisting in preaching the religion for the historian closes the account by telling us that for two years he received all that came unto him in his own hired house where he was permitted to dwell with a soldier that guarded him "preaching the kingdom of God and teaching those things which concern the Lord Jesus Christ with all confidence"  Now the historian from whom we have drawn this account in the part of his narrative which relates to St Paul is supported by the strongest corroborating testimony that a history can receive We are in possession of letters written by St Paul himself upon the subject of his ministry and either written during the period which the history comprises or if written afterwards reciting and referring to the transactions of that period These letters without borrowing from the history or the history from them unintentionally confirm the account which the history delivers in a great variety of particulars  What belongs to our present purpose is the description exhibited of the apostle's sufferings and the representation given in the history of the dangers and distresses which he underwent not only agrees in general with the language which he himself uses whenever he speaks of his life or ministry but is also in many instances attested by a specific correspondency of time place and order of events If the historian puts down in his narrative that at Philippi the apostle "was beaten with many stripes cast into prison and there treated with rigour and indignity  Acts xvi  " we find him in a letter  Thess ii  to a neighbouring church reminding his converts that "after he had suffered before and was shamefully intreated at Philippi he was bold nevertheless to speak unto them to whose city he next came the Gospel of God" If the history relate  Acts xvii  that at Thessalonica the house in which the apostle was lodged when he first came to that place was assaulted by the populace and the master of it dragged before  the magistrate for admitting such a guest within his doors the apostle in his letters to the Christians of Thessalonica calls to their remembrance "how they had received the Gospel in much affliction" If the history deliver an account of an insurrection at Ephesus which had nearly cost the apostle his l fe we have the apostle himself in a letter written a short time after his departure from that city describing his despair and returning thanks for his deliverance  Acts xix  Cor i  If the history inform us that the apostle was expelled from Antioch in Pisidia attempted to be stoned at Iconium and actually stoned at Lystra there is preserved a letter from him to a favorite convert whom as the same history tells us he first met with in these parts in which letter he appeals to that disciple's knowledge "of the persecutions which befell him at Antioch at Iconium at Lystra  Acts xiii xix  Tim iii  " If the history make the apostle in his speech to the Ephesian elders remind them as one  Thess i  proof of the disinterestedness of his views that to their knowledge he had supplied his own and the necessities of his companions by personal labour  Acts xx  we find the same apostle in a letter written during his residence at Ephesus asserting of himself "that even to that hour he laboured working with his own hands  Cor iv  "  These coincidences together with many relative to other parts of the apostle's history and  all  drawn from independent sources not only confirm the truth of the account in the particular points as to which they are observed but add much to the credit of the narrative in all its parts and support the author's profession of being a contemporary of the person whose history he writes and throughout a material portion of his narrative a companion  What the epistles of the apostles declare of the suffering state of Christianity the writings  which remain of their companions and immediate followers expressly confirm  Clement who is honourably mentioned by St Paul in his Epistle to the Philippians  Acts iv  hath left us his attestation to this point in the following words "Let us take says he the examples of our own age Through zeal and envy the most faithful and righteous pillars of the church have been persecuted even to the most grievous deaths Let us set before our eyes  the holy apostles  Peter by unjust envy underwent not one or two but many sufferings till at last being martyred he went to the place of glory that was due unto him For the same cause did Paul in like manner receive the reward of his patience Seven times he was in bonds he was whipped was stoned he preached both in the east and in the west leaving behind him the glorious report of his faith and so having taught the whole world righteousness and for that end travelled even  unto the utmost bounds of the west he at last suffered martyrdom by the command of the governors and departed out of the world and went unto his holy place being become a most eminent pattern of patience unto all ages To these holy apostles were joined a very great number of others who having through envy undergone in like manner many pains and torments have left a glorious example to us For this not only men but women have been persecuted and having suffered very grievous and cruel punishments have finished the course of their faith with firmness  Clem ad Cor c v vi Abp Wake's trans  "  Hermas saluted by St Paul in his Epistle to the Romans in a piece very little connected with historical recitals thus speaks"Such as have believed and suffered death for the name of Christ and have endured with a ready mind and have given up their lives with all their hearts  Shepherd of Hermas c xxviii  "  Polycarp the disciple of John though all that remains of his works be a very short epistle has not left this subject unnoticed"I exhort says he all of you that ye obey the word of righteousness and exercise all patience which ye have seen set forth before your eyes not only in the blessed Ignatius and Lorimus and Rufus but in others among yourselves and in  Paul himself and the rest of the apostles  being confident in this that all these have not run in vain but in faith and righteousness and are gone to the place that was due to them from the Lord with whom also they suffered For they loved not this present world but him who died and was raised again by God for us  Pol ad Phil c ix  "  Ignatius the contemporary of Polycarp recognizes the same topic briefly indeed but positively and precisely "For this cause  ie  for having felt and handled Christ's body after his resurrection and being convinced as Ignatius expresses it both by his  flesh and spirit they  i e  Peter and those who were present with Peter at Christ's appearance despised death and were found to be above it  Ep Smyr c iii  "  Would the reader know what a persecution in these days was I would refer him to a circular letter written by the church of Smyrna soon after the death of Polycarp who it will be remembered had lived with St John and which letter is entitled a relation of that bishop's martyrdom "The sufferings say they of all the other martyrs were blessed and generous which they underwent according to the will of God For so it becomes us who are more religious than others to ascribe the power and ordering of all things unto him And indeed who can choose but admire the greatness of their minds and that admirable patience and love of their master which then appeared in them who when they were so flayed with whipping that the frame and structure of  their bodies were laid open to their very inward veins and arteries nevertheless endured it In like manner those who were condemned to the beasts and kept a long time in prison underwent many cruel torments being forced to lie upon sharp spikes laid under their bodies and tormented with divers other sorts of punishments that so if it were possible the tyrant by the length of their sufferings might have brought them to deny Christ  Rel Mor Pol c ii  "  CHAP V  There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to have been original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motives to new rules of conduct  UPON the history of which the last chapter contains an abstract there are a few observations which it may be proper to make by way of applying its testimony to the particular propositions for which we contend  I Although our scripture history leaves the general account of the apostles in an early part of the narrative and proceeds with the separate account of one particular  apostle yet the information which it delivers so far extends to the rest as it shews  the nature of the service  When we see one apostle suffering persecution in the discharge of his commission we shall not believe without evidence that the same office could at the same time be attended with ease and safety to others And this fair and reasonable inference is confirmed by the direct attestation of the letters to which we have so often referred The writer of these letters not only alludes in numerous passages to his own sufferings but speaks of the rest of the apostles as enduring like sufferings with himself "I think that God hath set forth  us the apostles  last as it were appointed to death for we are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to meneven unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place and labour working with our own hands being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer it being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and as the offscouring of all things  unto this day  Cor iv et seq  " Add to which that in the short account that is given of the other apostles in the former part of the history and within the short period which that account comprises we find first two of them seized imprisoned brought before the Sanhedrim and threatened with further punishment  Acts iv  then the whole number imprisoned and beaten  Acts v  soon afterwards one of their adherents stoned to death and so hot a persecution raised against the sect as to drive most of them out of the place a short time only succeeding before one of the twelve was beheaded and another sentenced to the same fate and all this passing in the single city of Jerusalem and within ten years after the founder's death and the commencement of the institution  II Secondly We take no credit at present for the miraculous part of the narrative nor do we insist upon the correctness of single passages of it If the whole story be not a novel a romance the whole action a dream if Peter and James and Paul and  the rest of the apostles mentioned in the account be not all imaginary persons if their letters be not all forgeries and what is more forgeries of names and characters which never existed then is there evidence in our hands sufficient to support the only fact we contend for and which I repeat again is in itself highly probable that the original followers of Jesus Christ exerted great endeavours to propagate his religion and underwent great labours dangers and sufferings in consequence of their undertaking  III The general reality of the apostolic history is strongly confirmed by the consideration that it in truth does no more than assign adequate causes for effects which certainly were produced and describe consequences naturally resulting from situations which certainly existed The  effects  were certainly there of which this history sets forth the cause and origin and progress It is acknowledged on all hands because it is recorded by other testimony than that of the Christians themselves that the religion  began to prevail at that time and in that country It is very difficult to conceive how it could begin or prevail at all without the exertions of the founder and his followers in propagating the new persuasion The history now in our hands describes these exertions the persons employed the means and endeavours made use of and the labours undertaken in the prosecution of this purpose Again the treatment which the history represents the first propagators of the religion to have experienced was no other than what naturally resulted from the situation in which they were confessedly placed It is admitted that the religion was adverse in a great degree to the reigning opinions and to the hopes and wishes of the nation to which it was first introduced and that it overthrew so far as it was received the established theology and worship of every other country We cannot feel much reluctance in believing that when the messengers of such a system went about not only publishing their opinions but collecting proselytes and forming  regular societies of proselytes they should meet with opposition in their attempts or that this opposition should sometimes proceed to fatal extremities Our history details examples of this opposition and of the sufferings and dangers which the emissaries of the religion underwent perfectly agreeable to what might reasonably be expected from the nature of their undertaking compared with the character of the age and country in which it was carried on  IV Fourthly The records before us supply evidence of what formed another member of our general proposition and what as hath already been observed is highly probable and almost a necessary consequence of their new profession viz that together with activity and courage in propagating the religion the primitive followers of Jesus assumed upon their conversion a new and peculiar course of private life Immediately after their master was withdrawn from them we hear of their "continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication  Acts i  " of their "continuing daily with one accord in the temple  Acts ii  " of "many being gathered together praying  Acts xii  " We know what strict injunctions were laid upon the converts by their teachers Wherever they came the first word of their preaching was "Repent" We know that these injunctions obliged them to refrain from many species of licentiousness which were not at that time reputed criminal We know the rules of purity and the maxims of benevolence which Christians read in their books concerning which rules it is enough to observe that if they were I will not say completely obeyed but in any degree regarded they would produce a system of conduct and what is more difficult to preserve a disposition of mind and a regulation of affections different from any thing to which they had hitherto been accustomed and different from what they would see in others The change and distinction of manners which resulted  from their new character is perpetually referred to in the letters of their teachers "And you hath he quickened who  were  dead in trespasses and sins wherein in  times past  ye walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others  Eph ii see also Tit iii  ""For the  time past of our life  may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when we walked in lasciviousness lust excess of wine revellings banquetings and abominable idolatries  wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the same excess of riot  Pet iv  " St Paul in his first letter to the Corinthians after enumerating as his manner was a catalogue of vicious characters adds "Such  were  some  of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified  Cor vi  " In like manner and alluding to the same change of practices and sentiment he asks the Roman Christians "what fruit they had in those things whereof they are  now  ashamed  Rom vi  " The phrases which the same writer employs to describe the moral condition of Christians compared with their condition before they became Christians such as "newness of life" being "freed from sin" being "dead to sin" "the destruction of the body of sin that  for the future  they should not serve sin" "children of light and of the day" as opposed to "children of darkness and of the night" "not sleeping as others" imply at least a new system of obligation and probably a new series of conduct commencing with their conversion  The testimony which Pliny bears to the behaviour of the new sect in his time and  which testimony comes not more than fifty years after that of St Paul is very applicable to the subject under consideration The character which this writer gives of the Christians of that age and which was drawn from a pretty accurate enquiry because he considered their moral principles as the point in which the magistrate was interested is as followsHe tells the emperor "that some of those who had relinquished the society or who to save themselves pretended that they had relinquished it affirmed that they were wont to meet together on a stated day before it was light and sung among themselves alternately a hymn to Christ as a God and to bind themselves by an oath not to the commission of any wickedness but that they would not be guilty of theft or robbery or adultery that they would never falsify their word nor deny a pledge committed to them when called upon to return it" This proves that a morality more pure and strict than was ordinary prevailed at that time in Christian societies  And to me it appears that we are authorised to carry this testimony back to the age of the apostles because it is not probable that the immediate hearers and disciples of Christ were more relaxed than their successors in Pliny's time or the missionaries of the religion than those whom they taught  CHAP VI  There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to have been original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motives to new rules of conduct  WHEN we consider first the prevalency of the religion at this hour secondly the only credible account which can be given of its origin viz the activity of the founder and his associates thirdly the opposition which that activity must naturally have excited fourthly the fate of the founder of the religion attested by heathen writers as well as our own fifthly the testimony of the same writers to the sufferings of Christians either contemporary with or immediately succeeding  the original settlers of the institution sixthly predictions of the sufferings of his followers ascribed to the founder of the religion which ascription alone proves either that such predictions were delivered and fulfilled or that the writers of Christ's life were induced by the event to attribute such predictions to him seventhly letters now in our possession written by some of the principal agents in the transaction referring expressly to extreme labours dangers and sufferings sustained by themselves and their companions lastly a history purporting to be written by a fellow traveller of one of the new teachers and by its unsophisticated correspondency with letters of that person still extant proving itself to be written by some one well acquainted with the subject of the narrative which history contains accounts of travels persecutions and martyrdoms answering to what the former reasons lead us to expect when we lay together these considerations which taken separately are I think correctly such as I have stated them in the preceding chapters there cannot much  doubt remain upon our minds but that a number of persons at that time appeared in the world publicly advancing an extraordinary story and for the sake of propagating the belief of that story voluntarily incurring great personal dangers traversing seas and kingdoms exerting great industry and sustaining great extremities of ill usage and persecution It is also proved that the same persons in consequence of their persuasion or pretended persuasion of the truth of what they asserted entered upon a course of life in many respects new and singular  From the clear and acknowledged parts of the case I think it to be likewise in the highest degree probable that the story for which these persons voluntarily exposed themselves to the fatigues and hardships which they endured was a  miraculous  story I mean that they pretended to miraculous evidence of some kind or other They had nothing else to stand upon The designation of the person that is to say that Jesus of Nazareth rather than any other person was  the Messiah and as such the subject of their ministry could only be founded upon supernatural tokens attributed to him Here were no victories no conquests no revolutions no surprising elevation of fortune no achievements of valour of strength or of policy to appeal to no discoveries in any art or science no great efforts of genius or learning to produce A Galilean peasant was announced to the world as a divine lawgiver A young man of mean condition of a private and simple life and who had wrought no deliverance for the Jewish nation was declared to be their Messiah This without ascribing to him at the same time some proofs of his mission and what other but supernatural proofs could there be was too absurd a claim to be either imagined or attempted or credited In whatever degree or in whatever part the religion was  argumentative  when it came to the question "is the carpenter's son of Nazareth the person whom we are to receive and obey" there was nothing but the miracles attributed to him by which his pretensions could be  maintained for a moment Every controversy and every question must presuppose these for however such controversies when they did arise might and naturally would be discussed upon their own grounds of argumentation without citing the miraculous evidence which had been asserted to attend the founder of the religion which would have been to enter upon another and a more general question yet we are to bear in mind that without previously supposing the existence or the pretence of such evidence there could have been no place for the discussion or the argument at all Thus for example whether the prophecies which the Jews interpreted to belong to the Messiah were or were not applicable to the history of Jesus of Na  areth was a natural subject of debate in those times and the debate would proceed without recurring at every turn to his miracles because it set out with supposing these inasmuch as without miraculous marks and tokens real or pretended or without some such great change effected by his means in the public condition  of the country as might have satisfied the then received interpretation of these prophecies I do not see how the question could ever have been entertained Apollos we read "mightily convinced the Jews showing by the scriptures that Jesus was Christ  Acts xviii  " but unless Jesus had exhibited some distinction of his person some proof of supernatural power the argument from the old scriptures could have had no place It had nothing to attach upon A young man calling himself the Son of God gathering a crowd about him and delivering to them lectures of morality could not have excited so much as a doubt amongst the Jews whether he was the object in whom a long series of ancient prophecies terminated from the completion of which they had formed such magnificent expectations and expectations of a nature so opposite to what appeared I mean no such doubt could exist when they had the whole case before them when they saw him put to death for his officiousness and when by  his death the evidence concerning him was closed Again the  effect  of the Messiah's coming supposing Jesus to have been him upon Jews upon Gentiles upon their relation to each other upon their acceptance with God upon their duties and their expectations his nature authority office and agency were likely to become subjects of much consideration with the early votaries of the religion and to occupy their attention and writings I should not however expect that in these disquisitions whether preserved in the form of letters speeches or set treatises frequent or very direct mention of his miracles would occur Still miraculous evidence lay at the bottom of the argument In the  primary  question miraculous pretensions and miraculous pretensions alone were what they had to rely upon  That the original story was miraculous is very fairly also inferred from the miraculous powers which were laid claim to by the Christians of succeeding ages If the accounts of these miracles be true it was a  continuation of the same powers if they be false it was an  imitation  I will not say of what had been wrought but of what had been reported to have been wrought by those who preceded them That imitation should follow reality fiction be grafted upon truth that if miracles were performed at first miracles should be pretended afterwards agrees so well with the ordinary course of human affairs that we can have no great difficulty in believing it The contrary supposition is very improbable namely that miracles should be pretended to by the followers of the apostles and first emissaries of the religion when none were pretended to either in their own persons or that of their master by these apostles and emissaries themselves  CHAP VII  There is satisfactory evidence that many professing to have been original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motives to new rules of conduct  IT once then being proved that the first propagators of the Christian institution did exert great activity and subject themselves to great dangers and sufferings in consequence and for the sake of an extraordinary and I think we may say of a miraculous story of some kind or other the next great question is Whether the account which our scriptures contain be that story that which these men delivered and for which they acted and suffered as they did  This question is in effect no other than whether the story which Christians have  now  be the story which Christians had  then  and of this the following proofs may be deduced from general considerations and from considerations prior to any enquiry into the particular reasons and testimonies by which the authority of our histories is supported  In the first place there exists no trace or vestige of any other story It is not like the death of Cyrus the Great a competition between opposite accounts or between the credit of different historians There is not a document or scrap of account either contemporary with the commencement of Christianity or extant within many ages after that commencement which assigns a history substantially different from ours The remote brief and incidental notices of the affair which are found in heathen writers so far as they do go go along with us They bear testimony to these facts that the institution originated from Jesus that the  founder was put to death as a malefactor at Jerusalem by the authority of the Roman governor Pontius Pilate that the religion nevertheless spread in that city and throughout Judea and that it was propagated from thence to distant countries that the converts were numerous that they suffered great hardships and injuries for their profession and that all this took place in the age of the world which our books have assigned They go on further to describe the  manners  of Christians in terms perfectly conformable to the accounts extant in our books that they were wont to assemble on a certain day that they sung hymns to Christ as to a god that they bound themselves by an oath not to commit any crime but to abstain from theft and adultery to adhere strictly to their promises and not to deny money deposited in their hands  Vide Pliny's Letter Bonnet in his lively way of expressing himself says"Comparing Pliny's Letter with the account in the Acts it seems to me that I had not taken up another author but that I was still reading the historian of that extraordinary society" This is strong but there is undoubtedly an affinity and all the affinity that could be expected  that they worshipped him who was crucified in Palestine that this their first lawgiver had taught  them that they were all brethren that they had a great contempt for the things of this world and looked upon them as common that they flew to one another's relief that they cherished strong hopes of immortality that they despised death and surrendered themselves to sufferings  "It is incredible what expedition they use when any of their friends are known to be in trouble In a word they spare nothing upon such an occasionfor these miserable men have no doubt they shall be immortal and live for ever therefore they contemn death and many surrender themselves to sufferings Moreover their first lawgiver has taught them that they are all brethren when once they have turned and renounced the gods of the Greeks and worship the master of theirs who was crucified and engage to live according to his laws They have also a sovereign contempt for all the things of this world and look upon them as common" Lucian de Morte Peregrini t I p ed Graev  " This is the account of writers who viewed the subject at a great distance who were uninformed and uninterested about it It bears the characters  of such an account upon the face of it because it describes effects namely the appearance in the world of a new religion and the conversion of great multitudes to it without descending in the smallest degree to the detail of the transaction upon which it was founded the interior of the institution the evidence or arguments offered by those who drew over others to it Yet still here is no contradiction of our story no other or different story set up against it but so far a confirmation of it as that in the general points upon which the heathen account touches it agrees with that which we find in our own books  The same may be observed of the very few Jewish writers of that and the adjoining period which have come down to us Whatever they omit or whatever difficulties we may find in explaining the omission they advance no other history of the transaction than that which we acknowledge Josephus who wrote his antiquities or history of the Jews about sixty years after the  commencement of Christianity in a passage generally admitted as genuine makes mention of John under the name of John the Baptist that he was a preacher of virtue that he baptized his proselytes that he was well received by the people that he was imprisoned and put to death by Herod and that Herod lived in a criminal cohabitation with Herodias his brother's wife  Antiq l xviii cap v sect  In another passage allowed by many although not without considerable question being moved about it we hear of "James the brother of him who was called Jesus and of his being put to death  Antiq l xx cap ix sect  " In a third passage extant in every copy that remains of Josephus's history but the authenticity of which has nevertheless been long disputed we have an explicit testimony to the substance of our history in these words"At that time lived Jesus a wise man if he may be called a man for he performed many wonderful works He was a teacher of such  men as received the truth with pleasure He drew over to him many Jews and Gentiles This was the Christ and when Pilate at the instigation of the chief men among us had condemned him to the cross they who before had conceived an affection for him did not cease to adhere to him for on the third day he appeared to them alive again the divine prophets having foretold these and many wonderful things concerning him And the sect of the Christians so called from him subsists to this time  Antiq l xviii cap iii sect  " Whatever become of the controversy concerning the genuineness of this passage whether Josephus go the whole length of our history which if the passage be sincere he does or whether he proceed only a very little way with us which if the passage be rejected we confess to be the case still what we asserted is true that he gives no other or different history of the subject from ours no other or different account of the origin of the institution And I think also  that it may with great reason be contended either that the passage is genuine or that the silence of Josephus was  designed  For although we should lay aside the authority of our own books entirely yet when Tacitus who wrote not twenty perhaps not ten years after Josephus in his account of a period in which Josephus was near thirty years of age tells us that a vast multitude of Christians were condemned at Rome that they derived their denomination from Christ who in the reign of Tiberius was put to death as a criminal by the procurator Pontius Pilate that the superstition had spread not only over Judea the source of the evil but had reached Rome also when Suetonius an historian contemporary with Tacitus relates that in the time of Claudius the Jews were making disturbances at Rome Chrestus being their leader and that during the reign of Nero the Christians were punished under both which emperors Josephus livedwhen Pliny who wrote his celebrated epistle not more than thirty years after the publication of Josephus's  history found the Christians in such numbers in the province of Bithynia as to draw from him a complaint that the contagion had seized cities towns and villages and had so seized them as to produce a general desertion of the public rites and when as hath already been observed there is no reason for imagining that the Christians were more numerous in Bithynia than in many other parts of the Roman empire it cannot I should suppose after this be believed that the religion and the transaction upon which it was founded were too obscure to engage the attention of Josephus or to obtain a place in his history Perhaps he did not know how to represent the business and disposed of his difficulties by passing it over in silence Eusebius wrote the life of Constantine yet omits entirely the most remarkable circumstance in that life the death of his son Crispus undoubtedly for the reason here given The reserve of Josephus upon the subject of Christianity appears also in his passing over the banishment of the Jews by Claudius which Suetonius we have seen  has recorded with an express reference to Christ This is at least as remarkable as his silence about the infants of Bethlehem  Michaelis has computed and as it should seem fairly enough that probably not more than twenty children perished by this cruel precaution Michael Introd to the N Test translated by Marsh Vol I c ii sect  Be however the fact or the cause of the omission in Josephus  There is no notice taken of Christianity in the Mishna a collection of Jewish traditions compiled about the year although it contains a Tract "De cultu peregrino" of strange or idolatrous worship yet it cannot be disputed but that Christianity was perfectly well known in the world at this time There is extremely little notice of the subject in the Jerusalem Talmud compiled about the year and not much more in the Babylonish Talmud of the year although both these works are of a religious nature and although when the first was compiled Christianity was upon the point of becoming the religion of the state and when the latter was published had been so for years  what it may no other or different history of the subject has been given by him or is pretended to have been given  But farther the whole series of Christian  writers from the first age of the institution down to the present in their discussions apologies arguments and controversies proceed upon the general story which our scriptures contain and upon no other The main facts the principal agents are alike in all This argument will appear to be of great force when it is known that we are able to trace back the series of writers to a contact with the historical books of the New Testament and to the age of the first emissaries of the religion and to deduce it by an unbroken continuation from that end of the train to the present  The remaining letters of the apostles and what more original than  their  letters can we have though written without the remotest design of transmitting the history of Christ or of Christianity to future ages or even of making it known to their contemporaries incidentally disclose to us the following circumstances "Christ's descent and family his innocence the meekness and gentleness of his character a recognition which goes  to the whole gospel history his exalted nature his circumcision transfiguration his life of opposition and suffering his patience and resignation the appointment of the eucharist and the manner of it his agony his confession before Pontius Pilate his stripes crucifixion burial resurrection his appearance after it first to Peter then to the rest of the apostles his ascension into heaven and his designation to be the future judge of mankind the stated residence of the apostles at Jerusalem the working of miracles by the first preachers of the gospel who were also the hearers of Christ  Heb ii "How shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord and was confirmed unto us  by them that heard him  God also bearing them witness both  with signs and wonders  and with  divers miracles  and gifts of the Holy Ghost" I alledge this epistle without hesitation for whatever doubts may have been raised about its author there can be none concerning the age in which it was written No epistle in the collection carries about it more indubitable marks of antiquity than this does It speaks for instance throughout of the temple as then standing and of the worship of the temple as then subsistingHeb viii "For if he were on earth he should not be a priest seeing there  are  priests that offer according to the law"Again Heb xiii "We have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which  serve  the tabernacle"  the successful  propagation of the religion the persecution of its followers the miraculous conversion of Paul miracles wrought by himself and alledged in his controversies with his adversaries and in letters to the persons amongst whom they were wrought finally  that  MIRACLES  were the signs of an apostle  Cor xii "Truly  the signs of an apostle  were wrought among you in all patience in signs and wonders and mighty deeds"  "  In an epistle bearing the name of Barnabas the companion of Paul probably genuine certainly belonging to that age we have the sufferings of Christ his choice of apostles and their number his passion the scarlet robe the vinegar and gall the mocking and piercing the casting lots for his coat  Ep Bar c vii  his  resurrection on the eighth  i e  the first day of the week  Ep Bar c vi  and the commemorative distinction of that day his manifestation after his resurrection and lastly his ascension We have also his miracles generally but positively referred to in the following words "finally teaching the people of Israel and  doing many wonders and signs among them  he preached to them and showed the exceeding great love which he bare towards them  Ibid c v  "  In an epistle of Clement a hearer of St Paul although written for a purpose remotely connected with the Christian history we have the resurrection of Christ and the subsequent mission of the apostles recorded in these satisfactory terms "The apostles have preached to us from our Lord Jesus Christ from GodFor having received their command and being  thoroughly assured by the resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ  they went abroad publishing that the kingdom of God was at hand  Ep Clem Rom c xlii  " We find noticed also  the humility yet the power of Christ  Ep Clem Rom c xvi  his descent from Abraham his crucifixion We have Peter and Paul represented as faithful and righteous pillars of the church the numerous sufferings of Peter the bonds stripes and stoning of Paul and more particularly his extensive and unwearied travels  In an epistle of Polycarp a disciple of St John though only a brief hortatory letter we have the humility patience sufferings resurrection and ascension of Christ together with the apostolic character of St Paul distinctly recognized  Pol Ep ad

came little more than thirty years after Quadratus From Justin's works which are still extant might be collected a tolerably complete account of Christ's life in all points agreeing with that which is delivered in our scriptures taken indeed in a great measure from those scriptures but still proving that this account and no other was the account known and extant in that age The miracles in particular which  form the part of Christ's history most material to be traced stand fully and distinctly recognized in the following passage"He healed those who had been blind and deaf and lame from their birth causing by his word one to leap another to hear and a third to see and by raising the dead and making them to live he induced by his works the men of that age to know him  Just Dial cum Tryph p cd Thirl  "  It is unnecessary to carry these citations lower because the history after this time occurs in ancient Christian writings as familiarly as it is wont to do in modern sermons occurs always the same in substance and always that which our evangelists represent  This is not only true of those writings of Christians which are genuine and of acknowledged authority but it is in a great measure true of  all  their ancient writings which remain although some of these may have been erroneously ascribed to authors to  whom they did not belong or may contain false accounts or may appear to be undeserving of credit or never indeed to have obtained any Whatever fables they have mixed with the narrative they preserve the material parts the leading facts as we have them and so far as they do this although they be evidence of nothing else they are evidence that these points were  fixed  were received and acknowledged by all Christians in the ages in which the books were written At least it may be asserted that in the places where we were most likely to meet with such things if such things had existed no reliques appear of any story substantially different from the present as the cause or as the pretence of the institution  Now that the original story the story delivered by the first preachers of the institution should have died away so entirely as to have left no record or memorial of its existence although so many records and memorials of the time and transaction remain and that another story should have stepped into  its place and gained exclusive possession of the belief of all who professed themselves disciples of the institution is beyond any example of the corruption of even oral tradition and still less consistent with the experience of written history and this improbability which is very great is rendered still greater by the reflection that no such  change  as the oblivion of one story and the substitution of another took place in any future period of the Christian aera Christianity hath travelled through dark and turbulent ages nevertheless it came out of the cloud and the storm such in substance as it entered in Many additions were made to the primitive history and these entitled to different degrees of credit many doctrinal errors also were from time to time grafted into the public creed but still the original story remained and remained the same In all its principal parts it has been fixed from the beginning  Thirdly The religious rites and usages that prevailed amongst the early disciples of  Christianity were such as belonged to and sprung out of the narrative now in our hands which accordancy shews that it was the narrative upon which these persons acted and which they had received from their teachers Our account makes the founder of the religion direct that his disciples should be baptized we know that the first Christians were baptized Our account makes him direct that they should hold religious assemblies we find that they did hold religious assemblies Our accounts make the apostles assemble upon a stated day in the week we find and that from information perfectly independent of our accounts that the Christians of the first century did observe stated days of assembling Our histories record the institution of the rite which we call the Lord's Supper and a command to repeat it in perpetual succession we find amongst the early Christians the celebration of this rite universal And indeed we find concurring in all the abovementioned observances Christian societies of many different nations and languages removed from one another  by great distance of place and dissimilitude of situation It is also extremely material to remark that there is no room for insinuating that our books were fabricated with a studious accommodation to the usages which obtained at the time they were written that the authors of the books found the usages established and framed the story to account for their original The scripture accounts especially of the Lord's Supper are too short and cursory not to say too obscure and in this view deficient to allow a place for any such suspicion  The reader who is conversant in these researches by comparing the short scripture accounts of the Christian rites above mentioned with the minute and circumstantial directions contained in the pretended apostolical constitutions will see the force of this observation the difference between truth and forgery    Amongst the proofs of the truth of our proposition viz that the story which we have  now  is in substance the story which the Christians had  then  or in other words that the accounts in our gospels are as to  their principal parts at least the accounts which the apostles and original teachers of the religion delivered one arises from observing that it appears by the gospels themselves that the story was public at the time that the Christian community was already in possession of the substance and principal parts of the narrative The gospels were not the original cause of the Christian history being believed but were themselves among the consequences of that belief This is expressly affirmed by St Luke in his brief but as I think very important and instructive preface "Forasmuch says the evangelist as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things  which are most surely believed amongst us even as they aelivered them unto us which from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word  it seemed good to me also having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first to write unto thee in order most excellent Theophilus that thou mightest know the certainty of those things  wherein thou hast been instructed"  This short introduction testifies that the substance of the history which the evangelist was about to write was already believed by Christians that it was believed upon the declarations of eyewitnesses and ministers of the word that it formed the account of their religion in which Christians were instructed that the office which the historian proposed to himself was to trace each particular to its origin and to fix the certainty of many things which the reader had before heard of In St John's Gospel the same point appears from hence that there are some principal facts to which the historian refers but which he does not relate A remarkable instance of this kind is the  ascension  which is not mentioned by St John in its place at the conclusion of his history but which is plainly referred to in the following words of the sixth chapter  Also John iii and xvi  "What and if ye shall see the Son of man ascend up where he was before" And still more positively in the words which Christ according to our evangelist  spoke to Mary after his resurrection "Touch me not for I am not yet ascended to my Father but go unto my brethren and say unto them I ascend unto my Father and your Father unto my God and your God  John xx  " This can only be accounted for by the supposition that St John wrote under a sense of the notoriety of Christ's ascension amongst those by whom his book was likely to be read The same account must also be given of St Matthew's omission of the same important fact The thing was very well known and it did not occur to the historian that it was necessary to add any particulars concerning it It agrees also with this solution and with no other that neither Matthew nor John dispose of the person of our Lord in any manner whatever Other intimations in St John's Gospel of the then general notoriety of the story are the following His manner of introducing his narrative ch i v "John bare witness of him and cried saying" evidently presupposes  that his readers knew who John was His rapid parenthetical reference to John's imprisonment "for John was not yet cast into prison  John iii  " could only come from a writer whose mind was in the habit of considering John's imprisonment as perfectly notorious The description of Andrew by the addition "Simon Peter's brother  Ibid i  Ibid xxi  " takes it for granted that Simon Peter was well known His name had not been mentioned before The evangelist's noticing ‡ the prevailing misconstruction of a discourse which Christ held with the beloved disciple proves that the characters and the discourse were already public And the observation which these instances afford is of equal validity for the purpose of the present argument whoever were the authors of the histories  THESE  four  circumstances first the recognition of the account in its principal parts by a series of succeeding writers secondly the total absence of any account of the origin of  the religion substantially different from ours thirdly the early and extensive prevalence of rites and institutions which result from our account fourthly our account bearing in its construction proof that it is an account of facts which were known and believed at the time are sufficient I conceive to support an assurance that the story which we have now is in general the story which Christians had at the beginning I say  in general  by which term I mean that it is the same in its texture and in its principal facts For instance I make no doubt for the reasons above stated but that the resurrection of the founder of the religion was always a part of the Christian story Nor can a doubt of this remain upon the mind of any one who reflects that the resurrection is in some form or other asserted referred to or assumed in every Christian writing of every description which hath come down to us  And if our evidence stopped here we should have a strong case to offer for we should  have to alledge that in the reign of Tiberius Caesar a certain number of persons set about an attempt of establishing a new religion in the world in the prosecution of which purpose they voluntarily encountered great dangers undertook great labours sustained great sufferings all  for  a miraculous story which they published wherever they came and that the resurrection of a dead man whom during his life they had followed and accompanied was a constant part of this story I know nothing in the above statement which can with any appearance of reason be disputed and I know nothing in the history of the human species similar to it  CHAP VIII  There is satisfactory evidence that many persons professing to have been original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motives to new rules of conduct  THAT the story which we have now is in the main the story which the apostles published is I think nearly certain from the considerations which have been proposed But whether when we come to the particulars and the detail of the narrative the historical books of the New Testament be deserving of credit as histories so that a fact ought to be accounted true because it is found in them or whether they are entitled to be considered as representing the accounts  which true or salse the apostles published whether their authority in either of these views can be trusted to is a point which necessarily depends upon what we know of the books and of their authors  Now in treating of this part of our argument the first and a most material observation upon the subject is that such was the situation of the authors to whom the four gospels are ascribed that if any one of the four be genuine it is sufficient for our purpose The received author of the first was an original apostle and emissary of the religion The received author of the second was an inhabitant of Jerusalem at the time to whose house the apostles were wont to resort and himself an attendant upon one of the most eminent of that number The received author of the third was a stated companion and fellow traveller of the most active of all the teachers of the religion and in the course of his travels frequently in the society of the original apostles The received author of the fourth as well as of the first  was one of these apostles No stronger evidence of the truth of a history can arise from the situation of the historian than what is here offered The authors of all the histories lived at the time and upon the spot The authors of two of the histories were present at many of the scenes which they describe eyewitnesses of the facts earwitnesses of the discourses writing from personal knowledge and recollection and what strengthens their testimony writing upon a subject in which their minds were deeply engaged and in which as they must have been very frequently repeating the accounts to others the passages of the history would be kept continually alive in their memory Whoever reads the gospels and they ought to be read for this particular purpose will find in them not merely a general affirmation of miraculous powers but detailed circumstantial accounts of miracles with specifications of time place and persons and these accounts many and various In the Gospels therefore which bear the names of Matthew and John these narratives if they really proceeded  from these men must either be true as far as the sidelity of human recollection is usually to be depended upon that is must be true in substance and in their principal parts which is sufficient for the purpose of proving a supernatural agency or they must be wilful and meditated falsehoods Yet the writers who fabricated and uttered these falsehoods if they be such are of the number of those who unless the whole contexture of the Christian story be a dream sacrificed their ease and safety in the cause and for a purpose the most inconsistent that is possible with dishonest intentions They were villains for no end but to teach honesty and martyrs without the least prospect of honour or advantage  The gospels which bear the name of Mark and Luke although not the narratives of eyewitnesses are if genuine removed from that only by one degree They are the narratives of contemporary writers of writers themselves mixing with the business one of the two probably living in the place  which was the principal scene of action both living in habits of society and correspondence with those who had been present at the transactions which they relate The latter of them accordingly tells us and with apparent sincerity because he tells it without pretending to personal knowledge and without claiming for his work greater authority than belonged to it that the things which were believed amongst Christians came from those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word that he had traced up accounts to their source and that he was prepared to instruct his reader in the certainty of the things which he related  Why should not the candid and modest preface of this historian be believed as well as that which Dion Cassius prefixes to his Life of Commodus "These things and the following I write not from the report of others but from my own knowledge and observation" I see no reason to doubt but that both passages describe truly enough the situation of the authors  Very few histories lie so close to their facts very few historians are so nearly connected with the subject of their narrative  or possess such means of authentic information as these  The situation of the writers applies to the  truth  of the facts which they record But at present we use their testimony to a point somewhat short of this namely that the facts recorded in the gospels whether true or false are the facts and the sort of facts which the original preachers of the religion alledged Strictly speaking I am concerned only to shew that what the gospels contain is the same as what the apostles preached Now how stands the proof of this point A set of men went about the world publishing a story composed of miraculous accounts for miraculous from the very nature and exigency of the case they must have been and upon the strength of these accounts called upon mankind to quit the religions in which they had been educated and to take up from thenceforth a new system of opinions and new rules of action What is more in attestation of these accounts that is in support of an institution of which  these accounts were the foundation the same men voluntarily exposed themselves to harassing and perpetual labours dangers and sufferings We want to know what these accounts were We have the particulars  i e  many particulars from two of their own number We have them from an attendant of one of the number and who there is reason to believe was an inhabitant of Jerusalem at the time We have them from a fourth writer who accompanied the most laborious missionary of the institution in his travels who in the course of these travels was frequently brought into the society of the rest and who let it be observed begins his narrative by telling us that he is about to relate the things which had been delivered by those who were ministers of the word and eyewitnesses of the fact I do not know what information can be more satisfactory than this We may perhaps perceive the force and value of it more sensibly if we reflect how  requiring  we should have been if we had wanted it Supposing it to be sufficiently proved that the religion now  professed amongst us owed its original to the preaching and ministry of a number of men who about eighteen centuries ago set forth in the world a new system of religious opinions founded upon certain extraordinary things which they related of a wonderful person who had appeared in Judea suppose it to be also sufficiently proved that in the course and prosecution of their ministry these men had subjected themselves to extreme hardships fatigue and peril but suppose the accounts which they published had not been committed to writing till some ages after their times or at least that no histories but what had been composed some ages afterwards had reached our hands we should have said and with reason that we were willing to believe these men under the circumstances in which they delivered their testimony but that we did not at this day know with sufficient evidence what their testimony was Had we received the particulars of it from any of their own number from any of those who lived and conversed with them from any of their hearers or even  from any of their contemporaries we should have had something to rely upon Now if our books be genuine we have all these We have the very species of information which as it appears to me our imagination would have carved out for us if it had been wanting  But I have said that if  any one  of the four gospels be genuine we have not only direct historical testimony to the point we contend for but testimony which so far as that point is concerned cannot reasonably be rejected If the first gospel was really written by Matthew we have the narrative of one of the number from which to judge what were the miracles and the kind of miracles which the apostles attributed to Jesus Although for argument's sake and only for argument's sake we should allow that this gospel had been erroneously ascribed to Matthew yet if the gospel of St John be genuine the observation holds with no less strength Again although the gospels both of Matthew and John could be supposed to be spurious yet if the gospel of St  Luke was truly the composition of that person or of any person be his name what it might who was actually in the situation in which the author of that gospel professes himself to have been or if the gospel which bears the name of Mark really proceeded from him we still even upon the lowest supposition possess the accounts of one writer at least who was not only contemporary with the apostles but associated with them in their ministry which authority seems sufficient when the question is simply what it was which these apostles advanced  I think it material to have this well noticed The New Testament contains a great number of distinct writings the genuineness of any one of which is almost sufficient to prove the truth of the religion it contains however four distinct histories the genuineness of any one of which is perfectly sufficient If therefore we must be considered as encountering the risk of error in assigning the authors of our books we are entitled to the advantage of so many separate  probabilities And although it should appear that some of the evangelists had seen and used each other's works this discovery whilst it subtracts indeed from their character as testimonies strictly independent diminishes I conceive little either their separate authority by which I mean the authority of any one that is genuine or their mutual confirmation For let the most disadvantageous supposition possible be made concerning them let it be allowed what I should have no great difficulty in admitting that Mark compiled his history almost entirely from those of Matthew and Luke and let it also for a moment be supposed that these histories were not in fact written by Matthew and Luke yet if it be true that Mark a contemporary of the apostles living in habits of society with the apostles a fellowtraveller and fellowlabourer with some of them if I say it be true that this person made the compilation it follows that the writings from which he made it existed in the ti  es of the apostles and not only so but that they were then in such esteem and  credit that a companion of the apostles formed a history out of them Let the gospel of Mark be called an epitome of that of Matthew if a person in the situation in which Mark is described to have been actually made the epitome it affords the strongest possible attestation to the character of the original  Again parallelisms in sentences in words and in the order of words have been traced out between the gospel of Matthew and that of Luke which concurrence cannot easily be explained otherwise than by supposing either that Luke had consulted Matthew's history or what appears to me in no wise incredible that minutes of some of Christ's discourses as well as brief memoirs of some passages of his life had been committed to writing at the time and that such written accounts had by both authors been occasionally admitted into their histories Either supposition is perfectly consistent with the acknowledged formation of St Luke's narrative who professes not to write as an eyewitness but to have investigated  the original of every account which he delivers in other words to have collected them from such documents and testimonics as he who had the best opportunities of making enquiries judged to be authentic Therefore allowing that this writer also in some instances borrowed from the gospel which we call Matthew's and once more allowing for the sake of stating the argument that that gospel was not the production of the author to whom we ascribe it yet still we have in St Luke's gospel a history given by a writer immediately connected with the transaction with the witnesses of it with the persons engaged in it and composed from materials which that person thus situated deemed to be safe sources of intelligence in other words whatever supposition be made concerning any or all the other gospels if St Luke's gospel be genuine we have  in it  a credible evidence of the point which we maintain  The gospel according to St John appears to be and is on all hands allowed to be an  independent testimony strictly and properly so called Notwithstanding therefore any connection or supposed connection between some of the gospels I again repeat what I before said that if any one of the four be genuine we have in that one strong reason from the character and situation of the writer to believe that we possess the accounts which the original emissaries of the religion delivered  II In treating of the written evidences of Christianity next to their separate we are to consider their aggregate authority Now there is in the evangelic history a cumulation of testimony which belongs hardly to any other history but which our habitual mode of reading the scriptures sometimes causes us to overlook When a passage in any wise relating to the history of Christ is read to us out of the epistle of Clemens Romanus the epistles of Ignatius of Polycarp or from any other writing of that age we are immediately sensible of the consirmation which it affords to the scripture account  Here is a new witness Now if we had been accustomed to read the gospel of Matthew alone and had known that of Luke only as the generality of Christians know the writings of the apostolical fathers that is had known that such a writing was extant and acknowledged when we came for the first time to look into what it contained and found many of the facts which Matthew recorded recorded also there many other facts of a similar nature added and throughout the whole work the same general series of transactions stated and the same general character of the person who was the subject of the history preserved I apprehend that we should seel our minds strongly impressed by this discovery of fresh evidence We should feel a renewal of the same sentiment in first reading the gospel of St John That of St Mark perhaps would strike us as an abridgement of the history with which we were already acquainted but we should naturally reflect that if that history was abridged by such a person as Mark or by any person of so early an age it afforded one  of the highest possible attestations to the value of the work This successive disclosure of proof would leave us assured that there must have been at least some reality in a story which not one but many had taken in hand to commit to writing The very existence of four separate histories would satisfy us that the subject had a foundation and when amidst the variety which the different information of the different writers had supplied to their accounts or which their different choice and judgement in selecting their materials had produced we observed many facts to stand the same in all of these facts at least we should conclude that they were fixed in their credit and publicity If after this we should come to the knowledge of a distinct history and that also of the same age with the rest taking up the subject where the others had left it and carrying on a narrative of the effects produced in the world by the extraordinary causes of which we had already been informed and which effects subsist at this day we should think the reality of the original story in no  little degree established by this supplement If subsequent enquiries should bring to our knowledge one after another letters written by some of the principal agents in the business upon the business and during the time of their activity and concern in it assuming all along and recognizing the original story agitating the questions that arose out of it pressing the obligations which resulted from it giving advice and directions to those who acted upon it I conceive that we should find in every one of these a still further support to the conclusion we had formed At present the weight of this successive confirmation is in a great measure unperceived by us The evidence does not appear to us what it is for being from our infancy accustomed to regard the New Testament as one book we see in it only one testimony The whole occurs to us as a single evidence and its different parts not as distinct attestations but as different portions only of the same Yet in this conception of the subject we are certainly mistaken for the very discrepancies amongst  the several documents which form our volume prove if all other proof was wanting that in their original composition they were separate and most of them independent productions  If we dispose our ideas in a different order the matter stands thusWhilst the transaction was recent and the original witnesses were at hand to relate it and whilst the apostles were busied in preaching and travelling in collecting disciples in forming and regulating societies of converts in supporting themselves against opposition whilst they exercised their ministry under the harassings of frequent persecution and in a state of almost continual alarm it is not probable that in this engaged anxicus and unsettled condition of life they would think immediately of writing histories for the information of the public or of posterity  This thought occurred to Eusebius"Nor were the apostles of Christ greatly concerned about the writing of books being engaged in a more excellent ministry which is above all human power" Eccles Hist  iii c The same consideration accounts also for the paucity of Christian writings in the first century of its aera    But it is very probable that emergencies might draw from some of them occasional letters upon the subject of their mission to converts or to societies of converts with which they were connected or that they might address written discourses and exhortations to the disciples of the institution at large which would be received and read with a respect proportioned to the character of the writer Accounts in the mean time would get abroad of the extraordinary things that had been passing written with different degrees of information and correctness The extension of the Christian society which could no longer be instructed by a personal intercourse with the apostles and the possible circulation of imperfect or erroneous narratives would soon teach some amongst them the expediency of sending forth authentic memoirs of the life and doctrine of their master When accounts appeared authorized  by the name and credit and situation of the writers recommended or recognized by the apostles and first preachers of the religion or found to coincide with what the apostles and first preachers of the religion had taught other accounts would fall into disuse and neglect whilst these maintaining their reputation as if genuine and well founded they would do under the test of time enquiry and contradiction might be expected to make their way into the hands of Christians of all countries of the world  This seems the natural progress of the business and with this the records in our possession and the evidence concerning them correspond We have remaining in the first place many letters of the kind above described which have been preserved with a care and fidelity answering to the respect with which we may suppose that such letters would be received But as these letters were not written to prove the truth of the Christian religion in the sense in which we regard that question nor to convey information  of facts of which those to whom the letters were written had been previously informed we are not to look in them for any thing more than incidental allusions to the Christian history We are able however to gather from these documents various particular attestations which have been already enumerated and this is a species of written evidence as far as it goes in the highest degree satisfactory and in point of time perhaps the first But for our more circumstantial information we have in the next place five direct  bistories  bearing the names of persons acquainted by their situation with the truth of what they relate and three of them purporting in the very body of the narrative to be written by such persons of which books we know that some were in the hands of those who were contemporaries of the apostles and that in the age immediately posterior to that they were in the hands we may say of every one and received by Christians with so much respect and deference as to be constantly quoted and referred to by them without any doubt of the  truth of their accounts They were treated as such histories proceeding from such authorities might expect to be treated In the preface to one of our histories we have intimations left us of the existence of some ancient accounts which are now lost There is nothing in this circumstance that can surprise us It was to be expected from the magnitude and novelty of the occasion that such accounts would  swarm  When better accounts came forth these died away Our present histories superseded others They soon acquired a character and established a reputation which does not appear to have belonged to any other that at least can be proved concerning them which cannot be proved concerning any other  But to return to the point which led to these reflections By considering our records in either of the two views in which we have represented them we shall perceive that we possess a  collection of proofs  and not a naked or solitary testimony and that the written evidence is of such a kind and comes  to us in such a state as the natural order and progress of things in the infancy of the institution might be expected to produce  Thirdly The genuineness of the historical books of the New Testament is undoubtedly a point of importance because the strength of their evidence is augmented by our knowledge of the situation of their authors their relation to the subject and the part which they sustained in the transaction and the testimonies which we are able to produce compose a sirm ground of persuasion that the gospels were written by the persons whose names they bear Nevertheless I must be allowed to state that to the argument which I am endeavouring to maintain this point is not essential I mean so essential as that the fate of the argument depends upon it The question before us is whether the gospels exhibit the story which the apostles and first emissaries of the religion published and  for  which they acted and suffered in the manner in which for some miraculous story or other they did act and  suffer Now let us suppose that we possessed no other information concerning these books than that they were written by early disciples of Christianity that they were known and read during the time or near the time of the original apostles of the religion that by Christians whom the apostles instructed by societies of Christians which the apostles sounded these books were  received  by which term "received" I mean that they were believed to contain authentic accounts of the transaction upon which the religion rested and accounts which were accordingly used repeated and relied upon this reception would be a valid proof that these books whoever were the authors of them must have accorded with what the apostles taught A reception by the first race of Christians is evidence that they agreed with what the first teachers of the religion delivered In particular if they had not agreed with what the apostles themselves preached how could they have gained credit in churches and societies which the apostles established  Now the fact of their early existence and not only of their existence but their reputation is made out by some ancient testimonies which do not happen to specify the names of the writers add to which what hath been already hinted that two out of the four gospels contain averments in the body of the history which though they do not disclose the names fix the time and situation of the authors viz that one was written by an eyewitness of the sufferings of Christ the other by a contemporary of the apostles In the gospel of St John xix after describing the crucifixion with the particular circumstance of piercing Christ's side with a spear the historian adds as for himself "and he that saw it bare record and his record is true and he knoweth that he faith true that ye might believe" Again xxi after relating a conversation which passed between Peter and the disciple as it is there expressed whom Jesus loved it is added "this is the disciple which testisieth of these things and wrote these things" This testimony let it be remarked  is not the less worthy of regard because it is in one view imperfect The name is not mentioned which if a fraudulent purpose had been intended would have been done The third of our present gospels purports to have been written by the person who wrote the Acts of the Apostles in which latter history or rather latter part of the same history the author by using in various places the first person plural declares himself to have been a contemporary of all and a companion of one of the original preachers of the religion  CHAP IX  There is satisfactory evidence that many persons professing to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motives to new rules of conduct  "Of the Authenticity of the Scriptures"  NOT forgetting therefore what credit is due to the evangelie history supposing even any one of the four gospels to be genuine what credit is due to the gospels even supposing nothing to be known concerning them but that they were written by early disciples of the religion and received with deference by early Christian churches more especially not forgetting what credit is due to the New Testament in its capacity of  cumulative  evidence we now proceed to  state the proper and distinct proofs which show not only the general value of these records but their specific authority and the high probability there is that they actually came from the persons whose names they bear  There are however a few preliminary reflections by which we may draw up with more regularity to the propositions upon which the close and particular discussion of the subject depends Of which nature are the following  I We are able to produce a great number of ancient  manuscripts  found in many different countries and in countries widely distant from each other all of them anterior to the art of printing some certainly seven or eight hundred years old and some which have been preserved probably above a thousand years  The Alexandrian manuscript now in the British Museum was written probably in the fourth or fifth century  We have also many ancient  versions  of these books and some of them into languages which are not at present nor for many ages have been spoken in any part of the world The existence of these manuscripts and versions proves that the scriptures were not the production of any modern contrivance It does away also the uncertainty which hangs over such publications as the works real or pretended of Ossian and Rowley in which the editors are challenged to produce their manuscripts and to show where they obtained their copies The number of manuscripts far exceeding those of any other book and their wide dispersion affords an argument in some measure to the senses that the scriptures anciently in like manner as at this day were more read and sought after than any other books and that also in many different countries The greatest part of spurious Christian writings are utterly lost the rest preserved by some single manuscript There is weight also in Dr Bentley's observation that the New Testament has suffered less injury by the errors of transcribers than the  works of any profane author of the same size and antiquity that is there never was any writing in the preservation and purity of which the world was so interested or so careful  II An argument of great weight with those who are judges of the proofs upon which it is founded and capable through their testimony of being addressed to every understanding is that which arises from the style and language of the New Testament It is just such a language as might be expected from the apostles from persons of their age and in their situation and from no other persons It is the style neither of classic authors nor of the ancient Christian fathers but Greek coming from men of Hebrew origin abounding that is with Hebraic and Syriac idioms such as would naturally be found in the writings of men who used a language spoken indeed where they lived but not the common dialect of the country This happy peculiarity is a strong proof of the genuineness of these writings for who  should forge them The Christian fathers were for the most part totally ignorant of Hebrew and therefore were not likely to insert Hebraisms and Syriasms into their writings The few who had a knowledge of the Hebrew as Justin Martyr Origen and Epiphanius wrote in a language which bears no resemblance to that of the New Testament The Nazarenes who understood Hebrew used chiesly perhaps almost entirely the gospel of St Matthew and therefore cannot be suspected of forging the rest of the sacred writings The argument at any rate proves the antiquity of these books that they belonged to the age of the apostles that they could be composed indeed in no other  See this argument stated more at large in Michaelis's Introduction Marsh's translation vol I c ii sec from which these observations are taken    III Why should we question the genuineness of these books Is it for that they contain accounts of supernatural events I apprehend that this at the bottom is the  real though secret cause of our hesitation about them for had the writings inscribed with the name of Matthew and John related nothing but ordinary history there would have been no more doubt whether these writings were theirs than there is concerning the acknowledged works of Josephus or Philo that is there would have been no doubt at all Now it ought to be considered that this reason however it may apply to the credit which is given to a writer's judgment or veracity affects the question of genuineness very indirectly The works of Bede exhibit many wonderful relations but who for that reason doubts that they were written by Bede The same of a multitude of other authors To which may be added that we ask no more for our books than what we allow to other books in some sort similar to ours We do not deny the genuineness of the Koran We admit that the history of Appollonius Tyanaeus purporting to be written by Philostratus was really written by Philostratus  IV If it had been an easy thing in the early times of the institution to have forged Christian writings and to have obtained currency and reception to the forgeries we should have had many appearing in the name of Christ himself No writings would have been received with so much avidity and respect as these consequently none afforded so great temptation to forgery Yet have we heard but of one attempt of this sort deserving of the smallest notice  that  in a piece of a very few lines and so far from succeeding I mean from obtaining acceptance and reputation or an acceptance and reputation in any wise similar to that which can be proved to have attended the books of the New Testament that it is not so much as mentioned by any writer of the three first centuries The learned reader need not be informed that I mean the epistle of Christ to Abgarus king of Edessa found at present in the work of Eusebius  Hist Eccl l i c  as a piece acknowledged by him though not without considerable doubt whether the whole passage  be not an interpolation as it is most certain that after the publication of Eusebius's work this epistle was universally rejected  Augustin A D De Confens Evang c had  heard  that the Pagans pretended to be possessed of an epistle from Christ to Peter and Paul but he had never seen it and appears to doubt of the existence of any such piece either genuine or spurious No other ancient writer mentions it He also and he alone notices and that in order to condemn it an epistle ascribed to Christ by the Manichees A D and a short hymn attributed to him by the Priscillianists A D cont Faust Man lib xxviii c The lateness of the writer who notices these things the manner in which he notices them and above all the silence of every preceding writer render them unworthy of consideration    V If the ascription of the gospels to their respective authors had been arbitrary or conjectural they would have been ascribed to more eminent men This observation holds concerning the three first gospels the reputed authors of which were enabled by their situation to obtain true intelligence and were likely to deliver an honest account of  what they knew but were persons not distinguished in the history by extraordinary marks of notice or commendation Of the apostles I hardly know any one of whom less is said than of Matthew or of whom the little that is said is less calculated to magnify his character Of Mark nothing is said in the Gospels and what is said of any person of that name in the Acts and in the Epistles in no part bestows praise or eminence upon him The name of Luke is mentioned only in St Paul's Epistles  Col iv  Tim iv  Philem  and that very transiently The judgement therefore which assigned these writings to these authors proceeded it may be presumed upon proper knowledge and evidence and not upon a voluntary choice of names  VI Christian writers and Christian churches appear to have soon arrived at a very general agreement upon the subject and that without the interposition of any public authority When the diversity of opinion which prevailed and prevails among Christians  in other points is considered their concurrence in the canon of scripture is remarkable and of great weight especially as it seems to have been the result of private and free enquiry We have no knowledge of any interference of authority in the question before the council of Laodicea in the year Probably the decree of this council rather declared than regulated the public judgement or more properly speaking the judgement of some neighbouring churches the council itself consisting of no more than thirty or forty bishops of Lydia and the adjoining countries  Lardner's Cred vol viii p et seq  Nor does its authority seem to have extended farther for we find numerous Christian writers after this time discussing the question "what books were entitled to be received as scripture" with great freedom upon proper grounds of evidence and without any reference to the decision at Laodicea  CHAP X  Of the Authenticity of the Scriptures  THESE considerations are not to be neglected but of an argument concerning the genuineness of ancient writings the substance undoubtedly and strength is ancient testimony  This testimony it is necessary to exhibit somewhat in detail for when Christian advocates merely tell us that we have the same reason for believing the Gospels to be written by the evangelists whose names they bear as we have for believing the Commentaries to be Cesar's the Aeneid Virgil's or the Orations Cicero's they content themselves with an imperfect representation They state nothing more than what is true but they do not state the truth correctly In the number variety and early date of our  testimonies we far exceed all other ancient books For one which the most celebrated work of the most celebrated Greek or Roman writer can alledge we produce many But then it is more requisite in our books than in theirs to separate and distinguish them from spurious competitors The result I am convinced will be satisfactory to every fair enquirer but this circumstance renders an enquiry necessary  In a work however like the present there is a difficulty in finding a place for evidence of this kind To pursue the detail of proofs throughout would be to transcribe a great part of Dr Lardner's eleven octavo volumes to leave the argument without proofs is to leave it without effect for the persuasion produced by this species of evidence depends upon a view and induction of the particulars which compose it  The method which I propose to myself is first to place before the reader in one view the propositions which comprise the  several heads of our testimony and afterwards to repeat the same propositions in so many distinct sections with the necessary authorities subjoined to each  The reader when he has the propositions before him will observe that the argument if he should omit the sections proceeds connectedly from this point    The following then are the allegations upon the subject which are capable of being established by proof  I That the historical books of the New Testament meaning thereby the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are quoted or alluded to by a series of Christian writers beginning with those who were contemporary with the apostles or who immediately followed them and proceeding in close and regular succession from their time to the present  II That when they are quoted or alluded to they are quoted or alluded to with peculiar respect as books  sui generis  as possessing  an authority which belonged to no other books and as conclusive in all questions and controversies amongst Christians  III That they were in very early times collected into a distinct volume  IV That they were distinguished by appropriate names and titles of respect  V That they were publicly read and expounded in the religious assemblies of the early Christians  VI That commentaries were written upon them harmonies formed out of them different copies carefully collated and versions of them made into different languages  VII That they were received by Christians of different sects by many heretics as well as catholics and usually appealed to by both sides in the controversies which arose in those days  VIII That the four Gospels the Acts of the Apostles thirteen Epistles of St Paul the first Epistle of John and the first of Peter were received without doubt by those who doubted concerning the other books which are included in our present canon  IX That the Gospels were attacked by the early adversaries of Christianity as books containing the accounts upon which the religion was founded  X That formal catalogues of authentic scriptures were published in all which our present sacred histories were included  XI That these propositions cannot be affirmed of any other books claiming to be books of scripture by which are meant those books which are commonly called apocryphal books of the New Testament  SECT I  The historical books of the New Testament meaning thereby the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are quoted or alluded to by a series of Christian writers beginning with those who were contemporary with the Apostles or who immediately followed them and proceeding in close and regular succession from their time to the present  THE medium of proof stated in this proposition is of all others the most unquestionable the least liable to any practices of fraud and is not diminished by the lapse of ages Bishop Burnet in the History of his own Times inserts various extracts from Lord Clarendon's History  One  such insertion is a proof that Lord Clarendon's History was extant at the time when Bishop Burnet wrote that it had been read by Bishop Burnet  that it was received by Bishop Burnet as a work of Lord Clarendon's and also regarded by him as an authentic account of the transactions which it relates and it will be a proof of these points a thousand years hence or as long as the books exist Quintilian having quoted as Cicero's  Quint lib xi c  that wellknown trait of dissembled vanity  Si quid est in me ingenii Judices quod sentio quàm sit exiguum  the quotation would be strong evidence were there any doubt that the oration which opens with this address actually came from Cicero's pen These instances however simple may serve to point out to a reader who is little accustomed to such researches the nature and value of the argument  The testimonies which we have to bring forward under this proposition are the following  I There is extant an epistle ascribed to  Barnabas  Lardner's Cred ed vol i p et seq The reader will observe from the references that the materials of these sections are almost entirely extracted from Dr Lardner's workmy office consisted in arrangement and selection  the companion of Paul It is quoted as the Epistle of Barnabas by Clement of Alexandria A D by Origen A D It is mentioned by Eusebius A D and by Jerome A D as an ancient work in their time bearing the name of Barnabas and as well known and read amongst Christians though not accounted a part of Scripture It purports to have been written soon after the destruction of Jerusalem during the calamities which followed that disaster and it bears the character of the age to which it professes to belong  In this epistle appears the following remarkable passage"Let us therefore beware lest it come upon us  as it is written  There are many called few chosen" From the expression "as it is written" we infer with certainty that at the time when the  author of this epistle lived there was a book extant well known to Christians and of authority amongst them containing these words"Many are called few chosen" Such a book is our present Gospel of St Matthew in which this text is twice found  Mat xx xxii  and is found in no other book now known There is a farther observation to be made upon the terms of the quotation The writer of the epistle was a Jew The phrase "it is written" was the very form in which the Jews quoted their scriptures It is not probable therefore that he would have used this phrase and without qualification of any books but what had acquired a kind of scriptural authority If the passage remarked in this ancient writing had been found in one of St Paul's epistles it would have been esteemed by every one a high testimony to St Matthew's gospel It ought therefore to be remembered that the writing in which it  is  found was probably by very few years posterior to those of St Paul  Beside this passage there are also in the epistle before us several others in which the sentiment is the same with what we meet with in St Matthew's gospel and two or three in which we recognize the same words In particular the author of the epistle repeats the precept "Give to every one that asketh thee  Mat v  " and faith that Christ chose as his apostles who were to preach the gospel men who were great sinners that he might shew that he came "not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance  Ib ix  "  II We are in possession of an epistle written by Clement Bishop of Rome  Lardner's Cred vol i p et seq  whom ancient writers without any doubt or scruple assert to have been the Clement whom St Paul mentions Phil iv "with  Clement  also and other my fellow labourers whose names are in the book of life" This epistle is spoken of by the ancients as an epistle acknowledged by all and as Irenaeus  well represents its value "written by Clement who had seen the blessed apostles and conversed with them who had the preaching of the apostles still sounding in his ears and their traditions before his eyes" It is addressed to the church of Corinth and what alone may seem almost decisive of its authenticity Dionysius Bishop of Corinth about the year  i e  about eighty or ninety years after the epistle was written bears witness "that it had been wont to be read in that church from ancient times"  This epistle affords amongst others the following valuable passages"Especially remembering the words of the Lord Jesus which he spake teaching gentleness and long suffering for thus he said  "Blessed are the merciful for they shall obtain mercy" Mat v "Forgive and ye shall be forgiven give and it shall be given unto you" Luke vi "Judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgement ye judge ye shall be judged and with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again" Mat vii  Be ye  merciful that ye may obtain mercy forgive that it may be forgiven unto you as you do so shall it be done unto you as you give so shall it be given unto you as ye judge so shall ye be judged as ye shew kindness so shall kindness be shewn unto you with what measure ye mete with the same it shall be measured to you By this command and by these rules let us establish ourselves that we may always walk obediently to his holy words"  Again "Remember the words of the Lord Jesus for he said Wo to that man by whom offences come it were better for him that he had not been born than that he should offend one of my elect it were better for him that a millstone should be tied about his neck and that he should be drowned in the sea than that he should offend one of my little ones  Mat xviii "But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were cast into the sea" The latter part of the passage in Clement agrees more exactly with Luke xvii "It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend one of these little ones"  "  In both these passages we perceive the high respect paid to the words of Christ as recorded by the evangelists  "Remember  the words of the Lord Jesusby this command and by these rules let us establish ourselves that we may always walk obediently to his holy words" We perceive also in Clement a total unconsciousness of doubt whether these were the real words of Christ which are read as such in the gospels This observation indeed belongs to the whole series of testimony and especially to the most ancient part of it Whenever any thing now read in the gospels is met with in an early Christian writing it is always observed to stand there as acknowledged truth  i e  to be introduced without hesitation doubt or apology It is to be observed also that as this epistle was written in the name of the church of Rome and addressed to the church of Corinth it ought to be taken as exhibiting  the judgement not only of Clement who drew up the letter but of these churches themselves at least as to the authority of the books referred to  It may be said that as Clement hath not used words of quotation it is not certain that he refers to any book whatever The words of Christ which he has put down he might himself have heard from the apostles or might have received through the ordinary medium of oral tradition This hath been said but that no such inference can be drawn from the absence of words of quotation is proved by the three following considerationsFirst that Clement in the very same manner namely without any mark of reference uses a passage now found in the epistle to the Romans  Rom i  which passage from the peculiarity of the words which compose it and from their order it is manifest that he must have taken from the book The same remark may be repeated of some  singular sentiments in the epistle to the Hebrews Secondly that there are many sentences of St Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians standing in Clement's epistle without any sign of quotation which yet certainly are quotations because it appears that Clement had St Paul's epistle before him inasmuch as in one place he mentions it in terms too express to leave us in any doubt"Take into your hands the epistle of the blessed apostle Paul" Thirdly that this method of adopting words of scripture without reference or acknowledgement was as will appear in the sequel a method in general use amongst the most ancient Christian writers These analogies not only repel the objection but cast the presumption on the other side and afford a considerable degree of positive proof that the words in question have been borrowed from the places of scripture in which we now find them  But take it if you will the other way that Clement had heard these words from the apostles or first teachers of Christianity with  respect to the precise point of our argument viz that the scriptures contain what the apostles taught this supposition may serve almost as well  III Near the conclusion of the epistle to the Romans St Paul amongst others sends the following salutation "Salute Asyncritus Phlegon  Hermas  Patrobus Hermes and the brethren which are with them"  Of Hermas who appears in this catalogue of Roman Christians as contemporary with St Paul a book bearing the name and it is most probable rightly is still remaining It is called the Shepherd or Pastor of Hermas  Lardner's Cred vol i p  Its antiquity is incontestable from the quotations of it in Irenaeus A D Clement of Alexandria A D Tertullian A D Origen A D The notes of time extant in the epistle itself agree with its title and with the testimonies concerning it for it purports to have been written during the lifetime of Clement  In this piece are tacit allusions to St Matthew's St Luke's and St John's gospels that is to say there are applications of thoughts and expressions found in these gospels without citing the place or writer from which they were taken In this form appear in Hermas the confessing and denying of Christ  Mat x or Luke xii  the parable of the seed sown  Mat xiii or Luke viii  the comparison of Christ's disciples to little children the saying "he that putteth away his wife and marrieth another committeth adultery  Luke xvi  " The singular expression "having received all power from his father" in probable allusion to Mat xxviii and Christ being the "gate" or only way of coming "to God" in plain allusion to John xiv x There is also a probable allusion to Acts v  This piece is the representation of a vision and has by many been accounted a weak and fanciful performance I therefore observe that the character of the writing has  little to do with the purpose for which we adduce it It is the age in which it was composed that gives the value to its testimony  IV Ignatius as it is testified by ancient Christian writers became Bishop of Antioch about thirtyseven years after Christ's ascension and therefore from his time and place and station it is probable that he had known and conversed with many of the apostles Epistles of Ignatius are referred to by Polycarp his contemporary Passages found in the epistles now extant under his name are quoted by Irenaeus A D by Origen A D and the occasion of writing the epistles is given at large by Eusebius and Jerome What are called the smaller epistles of Ignatius are generally deemed to be those which were read by Irenaeus Origen and Eusebius  Lardner's Cred vol i p    In these epistles are various undoubted allusions to the gospels of St Matthew and St John yet so far of the same form with those in the preceding articles that like  them they are not accompanied with marks of quotation  Of these allusions the following are clear specimens  Matt  iii "For thus it becomes us to fulfil all righteousness"  xi "Be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as doves"  Christ was baptised of John that  all righteousness might be fulfilled by him  Be ye wise as serpents  in all things and  harmless as a dove  John  iii "The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound thereof but canst not tell  whence it cometh and whither it goeth  so is every one that is born of the spirit"  x "I am the door by me if any man enter in he shall be saved"  Yet the spirit is not deceived being from God for it knows  whence it comes and whither it goes  He Christ is the  door  of the Father by which  enter in  Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and the Apostles and the Church  As to the manner of quotation this is observableIgnatius in one place speaks of St Paul in terms of high respect and quotes his epistle to the Ephesians by  name  yet in several other places he borrows words and sentiments from the same epistle without mentioning it which shews that this was his general manner of using and applying writings then extant and then of high authority  V Polycarp  Lardner's Cred vol i p  had been taught by the apostles had conversed with many who had seen Christ was also by the apostles appointed Bishop of Smyrna This testimony concerning Polycarp is given by Irenaeus who in his youth had seen him "I can tell the place" saith Irenaeus "in which the blessed Polycarp sat and taught and his going out and coming in and the manner of his life and the form of his person and  the discourses he made to the people and how he related his conversation with John and others who had seen the Lord and how he related their sayings and what he had heard concerning the Lord both concerning his miracles and his doctrine as he had received them from the eyewitnesses of the word of life all which Polycarp related agreeable to the scriptures"  Of Polycarp whose proximity to the age and country and persons of the apostles is thus attested we have one undoubted epistle remaining And this though a short letter contains nearly forty clear allusions to books of the New Testament which is strong evidence of the respect which Christians of that age bore for these books  Amongst these although the writings of St Paul are more frequently used by Polycarp than other parts of scripture there are copious allusions to the gospel of St Matthew some to passages found in the gospels both of Matthew and Luke and some which more nearly resemble the words in Luke  I select the following as fixing the authority of the Lord's prayer and the use of it amongst the primitive Christians "If therefore we  pray  the Lord that he  will forgive us we ought also to forgive"  "With supplication  beseeching  the allseeing God  not to lead us into temptation  "  And the following for the sake of repeating an observation already made that words of our Lord found in our gospels were at this early day quoted as spoken by him and not only so but quoted with so little question or consciousness of doubt about their being really his words as not even to mention much less to canvass the authority from which they were taken  "But remembring what the Lord said teaching Judge not that ye be not judged forgive and ye shall be forgiven be ye merciful that ye may obtain mercy with what measure ye mete it shall be measured to you again  Mat vii v  Luke vi  "  Supposing Polycarp to have had these words from the books in which we now find them it is manifest that these books were considered by him and as he thought considered by his readers as authentic accounts of Christ's discourses and that that point was incontestible  The following is a decisive though what we call a tacit reference to St Peter's speech in the Acts of the Apostles"whom God hath raised having loosed the pains of death  Acts ii  "  VI Papias  Lardner's Cred vol i p  a hearer of John and companion of Polycarp as Irenaeus attests and of that age as all agree in a passage quoted by Eusebius from a work now lost expressly ascribes the respective gospels to Matthew and Mark and in a manner which proves that these gospels must have publicly borne the names of these authors at that time and probably long before for  Papias does not say that one gospel was written by Matthew and another by Mark but assuming this as perfectly well known he tells us from what materials Mark collected his account viz from Peter's preaching and in what language Matthew wrote viz in Hebrew Whether Papias was well informed in this statement or not to the point for which I produce his testimony namely that these books bore these names at this time his authority is complete  The writers hitherto alledged had all lived and conversed with some of the apostles The works of theirs which remain are in general very short pieces yet rendered extremely valuable by their antiquity and none short as they are but what contain some important testimony to our historical scriptures  That the quotations are more thinly strown in these than in the writings of the next and of succeeding ages is in a good measure accounted for by the observation that the scriptures of the New Testament had not  yet  nor by their recency hardly could have become a general part of Christian education read as the Old Testament was by Jews and Christians from their childhood and thereby intimately mixing as that had long done with all their religious ideas and with their language upon religious subjects In process of time and as soon perhaps as could be expected this came to be the case And then we perceive the effect in a proportionably greater frequency as well as copiousness of allusion  Mich Intr c ii sect vi      VII Not long after these that is not much more than twenty years after the last follows Justin Martyr  Lardner's Cred vol i p  His remaining works are much larger than any that have yet been noticed Although the nature of his two principal writings one of which was addressed to heathens and the other was a conference with a Jew did not lead him to such frequent appeals to Christian books as would have appeared in a discourse intended for Christian readers we nevertheless reckon up in them between twenty and thirty quotations of the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles certain distinct and copious if each verse be counted separately a much  greater number if each expression a very great one  "He cites our present canon and particularly our four Gospels continually I dare say above two hundred times" Jones's New and Full Method Appen vol i p ed    We meet with quotations of three of the gospels within the compass of half a page "and in other words he says Depart from me into outer darkness which the Father hath prepared for Satan and his angels" which is from Matthew xxv "And again he said in other words I give unto you power to tread upon serpents and scorpions and venomous beasts and upon all the power of the enemy" This from Luke x "And before he was crucified he said The son of man must suffer many things and be rejected of the Scribes and Pharisees and be crucified and rise again the third day" This from Mark viii  In another place Justin quotes a passage in the history of Christ's birth as delivered  by Matthew and John and fortisies his quotation by this remarkable testimony "as they have taught who have writ the history of all things concerning our Saviour Jesus Christ and we believe them"  Quotations also are found from the Gospel of St John  What moreover seems extremely material to be observed is that in all Justin's works from which might be extracted almost a complete life of Christ there are but two instances in which he refers to any thing as said or done by Christ which is not related concerning him in our present gospels which shews that these gospels and these we may say alone were the authorities from which the Christians of that day drew the information upon which they depended One of these instances is of a saying of Christ not met with in any book now extant  "Wherefore also our Lord Jesus Christ has said In whatsoever I shall find you in the same I will also judge you" Possibly Justin designed not to quote any text but to represent the sense of many of our Lord's sayings Fabricius has observed that this saying has been quoted by many writers and that Justin is the only one who ascribes it to our Lord and that perhaps by a slip of his memory  Words resembling these are read repeatedly in Ezekiel "I will judge them according to their ways" vii xxxiii It is remarkable that Justin had but just before expressly quoted Ezekiel Mr Jones upon this circumstance founded a conjecture that Justin wrote only "the Lord hath said" intending to quote the words of God or rather the sense of those words in Ezekiel and that some transcriber imagining these to be the words of Christ inserted in his copy the addition "Jesus Christ" Vol i p  The other of a circumstance in  Christ's baptism namely a siery or luminous appearance upon the water which according to Epiphanius is noticed in the Gospel of the Hebrews and which might be true but which whether true or false is mentioned by Justin with a plain mark of diminution when compared with what he quotes as resting upon scripture authority The reader will advert to this distinction "and then when Jesus came to the river Jordan  where John was baptizing as Jesus descended into the water a fire also was kindled in Jordan and when he came up out of the water  the apostles of this our Christ have written  that the Holy Ghost lighted upon him as a dove"  All the references in Justin are made without mentioning the author which proves that these books were perfectly notorious and that there were no other accounts of Christ then extant or at least no others so received and credited as to make it necessary to distinguish these from the rest  But although Justin mentions not the authors' names he calls the books "Memoirs composed by the Apostles" "Memoirs composed by the Apostles and their Companions" which descriptions the latter especially exactly suit with the titles which the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles now bear  VIII Hegesippus  Lardner's Cred vol i p  came about thirty  years after Justin His testimony is remarkable only for this particular that he relates of himself that travelling from Palestine to Rome he visited upon his journey many bishops and that "in every succession and in every city the same doctrine is taught which the Law and the Prophets and the  Lord  teacheth" This is an important attestation from good authority and of high antiquity It is generally understood that by the word "Lord" Hegesippus intended some writing or writings containing the teaching of Christ in which sense alone the term combines with the other terms "Law and Prophets" which denote writings and together with them admits of the verb "preacheth" in the present tense Then that these writings were some or all of the books of the New Testament is rendered probable from hence that in the fragments of his works which are preserved in Eusebius and in a writer of the ninth century enough though it be little is left to shew that Hegesippus expressed divers things in the style of the Gospels and of the Acts of  the Apostles that he referred to the history in the second chapter of Matthew and recited a text of that gospel as spoken by our Lord  IX At this time viz about the year the churches of Lyons and Vienne in France sent a relation of the sufferings of their martyrs to the churches of Asia and Phrygia  Lardner's Cred vol i p  The epistle is preserved entire by Eusebius And what carries in some measure the testimony of these churches to a higher age is that they had now for their bishop Pothinus who was ninety years old and whose early life consequently must have immediately joined on with the times of the apostles In this epistle are exact references to the Gospels of Luke and John and to the Acts of the Apostles The form of reference the same as in all the preceding articles That from St John is in these words "Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by the Lord that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God service  John xvi  "  X The evidence now opens upon us full and clear Irenaeus  Lard vol i p  succeeded Pothinus as bishop of Lyons In his youth he had been a disciple of Polycarp who was a disciple of John In the time in which he lived he was distant not much more than a century from the publication of the Gospels in his instruction only by one step separated from the persons of the Apostles He asserts of himself and his contemporaries that they were able to reckon up in all the principal churches the succession of bishops from the first  Adv Haeres l iii c  I remark these particulars concerning Irenaeus with more formality than usual because the testimony which this writer affords to the historical books of the New Testament to their authority and to the titles which they bear is express positive and exclusive One principal passage in which this testimony is contained opens with a precise assertion of the point which we have laid down as the foundation of our argument viz that the story which the Gospels exhibit is the story which the Apostles told "We have  not received" faith Irenaeus "the knowledge of the way of our salvation by any others than those by whom the gospel has been brought to us Which gospel they first preached and afterwards by the will of God committed to writing that it might be for time to come the foundation and pillar of our faithFor after that our Lord rose from the dead and they the apostles were endowed from above with the power of the Holy Ghost coming down upon them they received a perfect knowledge of all things They then went forth to all the ends of the earth declaring to men the blessing of heavenly peace having all of them and every one alike the gospel of God Matthew then among the Jews writ a gospel in their own language while Peter and Paul were preaching the gospel at Rome and founding a church there And after their exit Mark also the disciple and interpreter of Peter delivered to us in writing the things that had been preached by Peter And Luke the companion of Paul put down in a book the gospel preached by him Paul Afterwards  John the disciple of the Lord who also leaned upon his breast he likewise published a gospel while he dwelt at Ephesus in Asia" If any modern divine should write a book upon the genuineness of the gospels he could not assert it more expressly or state their original more distinctly than Irenaeus hath done within little more than a hundred years after they were published  The correspondency in the days of Irenaeus of the oral and written tradition and the deduction of the oral tradition through various channels from the age of the apostles which was then lately passed and by consequence the probability that the books truly delivered what the apostles taught is inferred also with strict regularity from another passage of his works "The tradition of the apostles this Father saith hath spread itself over the whole universe and all they who search after the sources of truth will find this tradition to be held sacred in every church We might enumerate all those who have been appointed bishops to these  churches by the apostles and all their successors up to our days It is by this uninterrupted succession that we have received the tradition which actually exists in the church as also the doctrines of truth as it was preached by the apostles  Ir in Haer I iii c  " The reader will observe upon this that the same Irenaeus who is now stating the strength and uniformity of the tradition we have before seen recognizing in the fullest manner the authority of the written records from which we are entitled to conclude that they were then conformable to each other  I have said that the testimony of Irenaeus in favour of our gospels is  exclusive  of all others I allude to a remarkable passage in his works in which for some reasons sufficiently fanciful he endeavours to show that there could be neither more nor fewer gospels than  four  With his argument we have no concern The position itself proves that four and only four gospels were at that  time publicly read and acknowledged That these were our gospels and in the state in which we now have them is shown from many other places of this writer beside that which we have already alledged He mentions how Matthew begins his gospel how Mark begins and ends his and their supposed reasons for so doing He enumerates at length the several passages of Christ's history in Luke which are not found in any of the other evangelists He states the particular design with which St John composed his gospel and accounts for the doctrinal declarations which precede the narrative  To the book of the Acts of the Apostles its author and credit the testimony of Irenaeus is no less explicit Referring to the account of St Paul's conversion and vocation in the ninth chapter of that book "Nor can they says he meaning the parties with whom he argues show that he is not to be credited who has related to us the truth with the greatest exactness" In another place he has accurately collected the several  texts in which the writer of the history is represented as accompanying St Paul which leads him to deliver a summary of almost the whole of the last twelve chapters of the book  In an author thus abounding with references and allusions to the scriptures there is not one to any apocryphal Christian writing whatever This is a broad line of distinction between our sacred books and the pretensions of all others  The force of the testimony of the period which we have considered is greatly strengthened by the observation that it is the testimony and the concurring testimony of writers who lived in countries remote from one another Clement flourished at Rome Ignatius at Antioch Polycarp at Smyrna Justin Martyr in Syria and Irenaeus in France  XI Omitting Athenagoras and Theophilus who lived about this time  Lard vol i p Ib  in the remaining  works of the former of whom are clear references to Mark and Luke and in the works of the latter who was bishop of Antioch the sixth in succession from the apostles evident allusions to Matthew and John and probable allusions to Luke which considering the nature of the compositions that they were addressed to heathen readers is as much as could be expected observing also that the works of two learned Christian writers of the same age Miltiades and Pantaenus  Lard vol i p  are now lost of which Miltiades Eusebius records that his writings "were monuments of zeal for the divine oracles" and which Pantaenus as Jerome testifies was a man of prudence and learning both in the divine scriptures and secular literature and had left many commentaries upon the holy scriptures then extant passing by these without further remark we come to one of the most voluminous of ancient Christian writers Clement of Alexandria  Ib vol ii p  Clement followed Irenaeus at the distance of only sixteen  years and therefore may be said to maintain the series of testimony in an uninterrupted continuation  In certain of Clement's works now lost but of which various parts are recited by Eusebius there is given a distinct account of the order in which the four gospels were written The gospels which contain the genealogies were he says written first Mark's next at the instance of Peter's followers and John's the last and this account he tells us that he had received from Presbyters of more ancient times This testimony proves the following points that these gospels were the histories of Christ then publicly received and relied upon that the dates occasions and circumstances of their publication were at that time subjects of attention and enquiry amongst Christians In the works of Clement which remain the four Gospels are repeatedly quoted by the names of their authors and the Acts of the Apostles is expressly ascribed to Luke In one place after mentioning a particular circumstance  he adds these remarkable words "We have not this passage  in the four gospels delivered to us  but in that according to the Egyptians" which puts a marked distinction between the four gospels and all other histories or pretended histories of Christ In another part of his works the perfect confidence with which he received the gospels is signified by him in these words "That this is true appears from hence that it is written in the gospel according to St Luke" and again "I need not use many words but only to alledge the evangelic voice of the Lord" His quotations are numerous The sayings of Christ of which he alledges many are all taken from our gospels the single exception to this observation appearing to be a loose  "Ask great things and the small shall be added unto you" Clement rather chose to expound the words of Matthew vi than literally to cite them and this is most undeniably proved by another place in the same Clement where he both produces the text and these words as an exposition"Seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and its righteousness for these are the great things but the small things and things relating to this  shall be added unto you" Jones's New and  vol i p  quotation of a passage in St Matthew's gospel  XII In the age in which they lived† Tertullian joins on with Clement The number of the gospels then received the names of the evangelists and their proper descriptions are exhibited by this writer in one short sentence"Among the  apostles  John and Matthew teach us the faith among  apostolical men  Luke and Mark refresh it" The next passage to be taken from Tertullian affords as complete an attestation to the authenticity of our books as can be well imagined After enumerating the churches which had been founded by Paul at Corinth in Galatia at Philippi Thessalonica and Ephesus the church of Rome established by Peter and Paul and other churches derived from John he proceeds thus"I say then that with them but not with them only which are apostolical but with all who have fellowship with  Lardner vol ii p  them in the same faith is that gospel of Luke received from its first publication which we so zealously maintain" and presently afterwards adds ▪ "The same authority of the apostolical churches will support the other gospels which we have from them and according to them I mean John's and Matthew's although that likewise which Mark published may be said to be Peter's whose interpreter Mark was" In another place Tertullian affirms that the three other gospels were in the hands of the churches from the beginning as well as Luke's This noble testimony sixes the universality with which the gospels were received and their antiquity that they were in the hands of all and had been so from the first And this evidence appears not more than one hundred and fifty years after the publication of the books The reader must be given to understand that when Tertullian speaks of maintaining or defending  tuendi  the Gospel of St Luke he only means maintaining or defending the integrity of the copies of Luke received by Christian churches in opposition  to certain curtailed copies used by Marcion against whom he writes  This author frequently cites the Acts of the Apostles under that title once calls it Luke's commentary and observes how St Paul's epistles confirm it  After this general evidence it is unnecessary to add particular quotations These however are so numerous and ample as to have led Dr Lardner to observe "that there are more and larger quotations of the small volume of the New Testament in this one Christian author than there are of all the works of Cicero in writers of all characters for several ages  Lard vol ii p  "  Tertullian quotes no Christian writing as of equal authority with the scriptures and no spurious book at all a broad line of distinction we may once more observe between our sacred books and all others  We may again likewise remark the wide extent through which the reputation of the Gospels and of the Acts of the Apostles had spread and the perfect consent in this point of distant and independent societies It is now only about one hundred and fifty years since Christ was crucified and within this period to say nothing of the apostolical Fathers who have been noticed already we have Justin Martyr at Neapolis Theophilus at Antioch Irenaeus in France Clement at Alexandria Tertullian at Carthage quoting the same books of historical scriptures and I may say quoting these alone  XIII An interval of only thirty years and that occupied by no small number of Christian writers  Minucius Felix Apollonius Caius Asterius Urbanus Alexander bishop of Jerusalem Hippolitus Ammonius Julius Africanus  whose works only remain in fragments and quotations and in every one of which is some reference or other to the gospels and in one of themHippolytus as preserved in Theodoretis an abstract  of the whole gospel history brings us to a name of great celebrity in Christian antiquity Origen  Lard vol iii p  of Alexandria who in the quantity of his writings exceeded the most laborious of the Greek and Latin authors Nothing can be more peremptory upon the subject now under consideration and from a writer of his learning and information more satisfactory than the declaration of Origen preserved in an extract from his works by Eusebius "That the four gospels alone are received without dispute by the whole church of God under heaven" to which declaration is immediately subjoined a brief history of the respective authors to whom they were then as they are now ascribed The language holden concerning the gospels throughout the works of Origen which remain entirely correspond with the testimony here cited His attestation to the Acts of the Apostles is no less positive "And Luke also once more sounds the trumpet relating the acts of the Apostles" The  universality with which the scriptures were then read is well signified by this writer in a passage in which he has occasion to observe against Celsus "That it is not in any private books or such as are read by a few only and those studious persons but in books read by every body that it is written the invisible things of God from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by things that are made" It is to no purpose to single out quotations of scripture from such a writer as this We might as well make a selection of the quotations of scripture in Dr Clark's sermons They are so thickly sown in the works of Origen that Dr Mill says "If we had all his works remaining we should have before us almost the whole text of the Bible  Mill proleg cap vi p  "  Origen notices in order to censure certain apocryphal gospels He also uses four writings of this sort that is throughout his large works he once or twice at the most quotes  each of the four but always with some mark either of direct reprobation or of caution to his readers manifestly esteeming them of little or no authority  XIV Gregory bishop of Neocesarea and Dionysius of Alexandria were scholars of Origen Their testimony therefore though full and particular may be reckoned a repetition only of his The series however of evidence is continued by Cyprian bishop of Carthage who flourished within twenty years after Origen "The church says this Father is watered like Paradise by four rivers that is by four gospels" The Acts of the Apostles is also frequently quoted by Cyprian under that name and under the name of the "Divine Scriptures" In his various writings are such constant and copious citations of scripture as to place this part of the testimony beyond controversy Nor is there in the works of this eminent African bishop one quotation of a spurious or apocryphal Christian writing  XV passing over a crowd  Novatus Rome A D Dionysius Rome A D Commodian A D Anatolius Laodicea A D Theognostus A D Methodius Lycia A D Phileas Egypt  of writers following Cyprian at different distances but all within forty years of his time and who all in the imperfect remains of their works either cite the historical scriptures of the New Testament or speak of them in terms of profound respect I single out Victorin bishop of Pettaw in Germany merely on account of the remoteness of his situation from that of Origen and Cyprian who were Africans by which circumstance his testimony taken in conjunction with theirs proves that the scripture histories and the same histories were known and received from one side of the Christian world to the other This bishop  Lard vol v p  lived about the year and in a commentary upon this text of the Revelations "The first was like a lion the second was like a calf the third like a man and the fourth like a flying eagle" he makes out  that by the four creatures are intended the four Gospels and to show the propriety of the symbols he recites the subject with which each evangelist opens his history The explication is fanciful but the testimony positive He also expressly cites the Acts of the Apostles  XVI Arnobius and Lactantius  Ib vol vii p  about the year composed formal arguments upon the credibility of the Christian religion As these arguments were addressed to Gentiles the authors abstain from quoting Christian books  by name  one of them giving this very reason for his reserve but when they come to state for the information of their readers the outlines of Christ's history it is apparent that they draw their accounts from our gospels and from no other sources for these statements exhibit a summary of almost every thing which is related of Christ's actions and miracles by the four evangelists Arnobius vindicates without mentioning their names the credit of these historians  observing that they were eyewitnesses of of the facts which they relate and that their ignorance of the arts of composition was rather a confirmation of their testimony than an objection to it Lactantius also argues in defence of the religion from the consistency simplicity disinterestedness and sufferings of the Christian historians meaning by that term our evangelists  XVII We close the series of testimonies with that of Eusebius* bishop of Cesarea who flourished in the year contemporary with or posterior only by fifteen years to the two authors last cited This voluminous writer and most diligent collector of the writings of others beside a variety of large works composed a history of the affairs of Christianity from its origin to his own time His testimony to the scriptures is the testimony of a man much conversant in the works of Christian authors written during the three first centuries of its aera and  Ib vol viii p  who had read many which are now lost In a passage of his evangelical demonstration Eusebius remarks with great nicety the delicacy of two of the evangelists in their manner of noticing any circumstance which regarded themselves and of Mark as writing under Peter's direction in the circumstances which regarded him The illustration of this remark leads him to bring together long quotations from each of the evangelists and the whole passage is a proof that Eusebius and the Christians of those days not only read the gospels but studied them with attention and exactness In a passage of his ecclesiastical history he treats in form and at large of the occasions of writing the four gospels and of the order in which they were written The title of the chapter is "Of the Order of the Gospels" and it begins thus "Let us observe the writings of this apostle John which are not contradicted by any and first of all must be mentioned as acknowledged by all the gospel according to him well known to all the churches under heaven and that it has been  justly placed by the ancients the fourth in order and after the other three may be made evident in this manner" Eusebius then proceeds to shew that John wrote the last of the four and that his gospel was intended to supply the omissions of the others especially in the part of our Lord's ministry which took place before the imprisonment of John the Baptist He observes "that the apostles of Christ were not studious of the ornaments of composition nor indeed forward to write at all being wholly occupied with their ministry"  This learned author makes no use at all of Christian writings forged with the names of Christ's apostles or their companions  We close this branch of our evidence here because after Eusebius there is no room for any question upon the subject the works of Christian writers being as full of texts of scripture and of references to scripture as the discourses of modern divines Future testimonies to the books of scripture could only prove that they never lost their character or authority  SECT II  When the scriptures are quoted or alluded to they are quoted with peculiar respect as books sui generis as possessing an authority which belonged to no other books and as conclusive in all questions and controversies amongst Christians  BESIDE the general strain of reference and quotation which uniformly and strongly indicates this distinction the following may be regarded as specific testimonies  I Theophilus  Lard Cred pt ii vol i p  bishop of Antioch the sixth in succession from the apostles and who flourished little more than a century after the books of the New Testament were written having occasion to quote one of our gospels writes thus "These things the holy scriptures teach us and all who were moved by the holy spirit among whom John  says In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God" Again "Concerning the righteousness which the law teaches the like things are to be found in the prophets and the  gospels  because that all being inspired spoke by one and the same Spirit of God  Ib vol i p  " No words can testify more strongly than these do the high and peculiar respect in which these books were holden  II A writer against Artemon  Ib vol iii p  who may be supposed to come about one hundred and fiftyeight years after the publication of the scriptures in a passage quoted by Eusebius uses these expressions "Possibly what they our adversaries say might have been credited  if first of all  the divine scriptures did not contradict them  and then  the writings of certain brethren more ancient than the times of Victor" The brethren mentioned by name are Justin Miltiades Tatian Clement Irenaeus Melito with a general appeal  to many more not named This passage proves first that there was at that time a collection called  divine scriptures  secondly that these scriptures were esteemed of higher authority than the writings of the most early and celebrated Christians  III In a piece ascribed to Hippolitus  Ib vol iii p  who lived near the same time the author professes in giving his correspondent instruction in the things about which he enquires "to draw out of the  sacred fountain  and to set before him from the sacred scriptures what may afford him satisfaction" He then quotes immediately Paul's epistles to Timothy and afterwards many books of the New Testament This preface to the quotations carries in it a marked distinction between the scriptures and other books  IV  "Our  assertions and discourses" saith Origen  Ib p  "are unworthy of credit we must receive the  scriptures  as witnesses"  After treating of the duty of prayer he proceeds with his argument thus "What we have said may be proved from the divine scriptures" In his books against Celsus we find this passage "That our religion teaches us to seek after wisdom shall be shewn both out of the ancient Jewish scriptures which we also use and out of those written since Jesus which are believed in the churches to be divine" These expressions afford abundant evidence of the peculiar and exclusive authority which the scriptures possessed  V Cyprian bishop of Carthage  Ib vol iv p  whose age lies close to that of Origen earnestly exhorts Christian teachers in all doubtful cases "to go back to the  fountain  and if the truth has in any case been shaken to recur to the gospels and apostolic writings""The precepts of the gospels" says he in another place "are nothing less than authoritative divine lessons the foundations of our hope the supports of our faith the guides of  our way the safeguards of our course to heaven"  VI Novatus  Ib vol v p  a Roman contemporary with Cyprian appeals to the scriptures as the authority by which all errors were to be repelled and disputes decided "That Christ is not only man but God also is proved by the sacred authority of the divine writings""The divine scripture easily detects and confutes the frauds of heretics""It is not by the fault of the heavenly scriptures which never deceive" Stronger assertions than these could not be used  VII At the distance of twenty years from the writer last cited Anatolius  Ib p  a learned Alexandrian and bishop of Laodicea speaking of the rule for keeping Easter a question at that day agitated with much earnestness says of those whom he opposed "They can by no means prove their point by the authority of the divine scripture"  VIII The Arians who sprung up about fifty years after this argued strenuously against the use of the words consubstantial and essence and like phrases  "because they were not in scripture  Ib vol vii p  And in the same strain one of their advocates opens a conference with Augustine after the following manner "If you say what is reasonable I must submit If you alledge any thing from the divine scriptures which are common to both I must hear But unscriptural expressions quae extra scripturam sunt deserve no regard"  Athanasius the great antagonist of Arianism after having enumerated the books of the Old and New Testament adds "These are the fountains of salvation that he who thirsts may be satisfied with the oracles contained in them In these alone the doctrine of salvation is proclaimed Let no man add to them or take any thing from them  Ib vol xii p  "  IX Cyril bishop of Jerusalem  Ib vol viii p  who wrote about twenty years after the appearance of Arianism uses these remarkable words "Concerning the divine and holy mysteries of faith not the least article ought to be delivered without the divine scriptures" We are assured that Cyril's scriptures were the same as ours for he has left us a catalogue of the books included under that name  X Epiphanius  Ib p  twenty years after Cyril challenges the Arians and the followers of Origen "to produce any passage of the Old or New Testament favouring their sentiments"  XI Phoebadius a Gallic bishop who lived about thirty years after the council of Nice testifies that "the bishops of that council first consulted the sacred volumes and then declared their faith  Ib vol ix p    XII Basil bishop of Cesarea in Cappadocia contemporary with Epiphanius says "that hearers instructed in the scriptures ought to examine what is said by their teachers and to embrace what is agreeable to the scriptures and to reject what is otherwise  Ib vol ix p  "  XIII Ephraim the Syrian a celebrated writer of the same times bears this conclusive testimony to the proposition which forms the subject of our present chapter "The truth written in the sacred volume of the gospel is a perfect rule Nothing can be taken from it nor added to it without great guilt  Ib p  "  XIV If we add Jerome to these it is only for the evidence which he affords of the judgment of preceding ages Jerome observes concerning the quotations of  ancient  Christian writers that is of writers who were  ancient  in the year that they  made a distinction between books some they quoted as of authority and others not which observation relates to the books of scripture compared with other writings apocryphal or heathen  Ib vol x p    SECT III  The scriptures were in very early times collected into a distinct volume  IGNATIUS who was bishop of Antioch within forty years after the ascension and who had lived and conversed with the apostles speaks of the gospel and of the apostles in terms which render it very probable that he meant by the gospel the book or volume of the Gospels and by the apostles the book or volume of their Epistles His words in one place are  Lard Cred pt ii vol i p  "fleeing to the Gospel as the flesh of Jesus and to the Apostles as the presbytery of the church" that is as Le Clerc interprets them "in order to understand the will of God he fled to the gospels which he believed no less than if Christ in the flesh had been speaking to him and to the writings of the  apostles whom he esteemed as the presbytery of the whole Christian church" It must be observed that about eighty years after this we have direct proof in the writings of Clement of Alexandria  Ib vol ii p  that these two names "Gospel" and "Apostles" were the names by which the writings of the New Testament and the division of these writings were usually expressed  Another passage from Ignatius is the following"But the Gospel has somewhat in it more excellent the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ his passion and resurrection  Ib p  "  And a third "Ye ought to hearken to the Prophets but especially to the Gospel in which the passion has been manifested to us and the resurrection perfected" In this last passage the prophets and the gospel are put in conjunction and as Ignatius undoubtedly meant by the Prophets a collection of writings  it is probable that he meant the same by the Gospel the two terms standing in evident parallelism with each other  This interpretation of the word "gospel" in the passages above quoted from Ignatius is confirmed by a piece of nearly equal antiquity the relation of the martyrdom of Polycarp by the church of Smyrna "All things" say they "that went before were done that the Lord might shew us a martyrdom according to the gospel for he expected to be delivered up as the Lord also did  Ig Ep c i  " And in another place "We do not commend those who offer themselves forasmuch as the gospel teaches us no such thing  Ib c iv  " In both these places what is called  the gospel  seems to be the history of Jesus Christ and of his doctrine  If this be the true sense of the passages they are not only evidences of our proposition but strong and very ancient proofs  of the high esteem in which the books of the New Testament were holden  II Eusebius relates that Quadratus and some others who were the immediate successors of the apostles travelling abroad to preach Christ carried the gospels with them and delivered them to their converts The words of Eusebius are "Then travelling abroad they performed the work of evangelists being ambitious to preach Christ and  deliver the scripture of the divine gospels  Lard Cred pt ii vol i p  " Eusebius had before him the writings both of Quadratus himself and of many others of that age which are now lost It is reasonable therefore to believe that he had good grounds for his assertion What is thus recorded of the gospels took place within sixty or at the most seventy years after they were published and it is evident that they must before this time and it is probable long before this time have been in general use and in high esteem in the  churches planted by the apostles inasmuch as they were now we find collected into a volume and the immediate successors of the apostles they who preached the religion of Christ to those who had not already heard it carried the volume with them and delivered it to their converts  III Irenaeus in the year  Ib vol i p  puts the evangelic and apostolic writings in connection with the law and the prophets manifestly intending by the one a code or collection of Christian sacred writings as the other expressed the code or collection of Jewish sacred writings And  IV Melito at this time bishop of Sardis writing to one Onesimus tells his correspondent  Ib p  that he had procured an accurate account of the books of the OLD Testament The occurrence in this passage of the term  Old  Testament has been brought to prove and it certainly does prove that there was  then a volume or collection of writings called the  New  Testament  V In the time of Clement of Alexandria about fifteen years after the last quoted testimony it is apparent that the Christian scriptures were divided into two parts under the general titles of the Gospels and Apostles and that both these were regarded as of the highest authority One out of many expressions of Clement alluding to this distribution is the following"There is a consent and harmony between the law and the prophets the apostles and the gospel  Ib vol ii p  "  VI The same division "Prophets Gospels and Apostles" appears in Tertullian  Ib p  the contemporary of Clement The collection of the gospels is likewise called by this writer the "Evangelic Instrument  Ib p  " the whole volume the "New Testament" and the two parts the "Gospels and Apostles  Ib p  "  VII From many writers also of the third century and especially from Cyprian who lived in the middle of it it is collected that the Christian scriptures were divided into two codes or volumes one called the "Gospels or Scriptures of the Lord" the other the "Apostles or Epistles of the Apostles  Ib vol iv p  "  VIII Eusebius as we have already seen takes some pains to shew that the gospel of St John had been justly placed by the Ancients "the fourth in order and after the other three  Ib vol viii p  " These are the terms of his proposition and the very introduction of such an argument proves incontestably that the four Gospels had been collected into a volume to the exclusion of every other that their order in the volume had been adjusted with much consideration and that this had been done by those who were called Ancients in the time of Eusebius  In the Diocletian persecution in the year  the scriptures were sought out and burnt  Ib vol vii p et seq  many suffered death rather than deliver them up and those who betrayed them to the persecutors were accounted as lapsed and apostate On the other hand Constantine after his conversion gave directions for multiplying copies of the divine oracles and for magnificently adorning them at the expence of the imperial treasury  Ib p  What the Christians of that age so richly embellished in their prosperity and which is more so tenaciously preserved under persecution was the very volume of the New Testament which we now read  SECT IV  Our present sacred writings were soon distinguished by appropriate names and titles of respect  I POLYCARP "I trust that ye are well exercised in the  holy scriptures  as in these scriptures it is said Be ye angry and sin not and let not the sun go down upon your wrath  Lard Cred vol i p  " This passage is extremely important because it proves that in the time of Polycarp who had lived with the apostles there were Christian writings distinguished by the name of "holy scriptures" or  sacred  writings Moreover the text quoted by Polycarp is a text found in the collection at this day What also the same Polycarp hath elsewhere quoted in the same manner may be considered as proved to belong to the collection and this comprehends St  Matthew's and probably St Luke's gospel the Acts of the Apostles ten epistles of Paul the first epistle of Peter and the first of John  Ib vol i p  In another place Polycarp has these words "Whoever perverts the  oracles of the Lord  to his own lusts and says there is neither resurrection nor judgement he is the firstborn of Satan  Ib p  " It does not appear what else Polycarp could mean by the "oracles of the Lord" but those same "holy scriptures" or sacred writings of which he had spoken before  II Justin Martyr whose apology was written about thirty years after Polycarp's epistle expressly cites some of our present histories under the title of GOSPEL and that not as a name by him first ascribed to them but as the name by which they were generally known in his time His words are these"For the apostles in the memoirs composed by them  which are called gospels  have thus delivered it that Jesus commanded them to take bread and give thanks  Ib p  "  There exists no doubt but that by the memoirs above mentioned Justin meant our present historical scriptures for throughout his works he quotes these and no others  III Dionysius bishop of Corinth who came thirty years after Justin in a passage preserved in Eusebius for his works are lost speaks of "the scriptures of the Lord  Ib vol i p  "  IV And at the same time or very nearly so by Irenaeus bishop of Lyons in France  The reader will observe the remoteness of these two writers in country and situation  they are called "divine scriptures""divine oracles""scriptures of the Lord""evangelic and apostolic writings  Ib p et seq  " The quotations of Irenaeus prove decidedly that our present Gospels and these alone together with the Acts of the Apostles were the historical books comprehended by him under these appellations  V St Matthew's gospel is quoted by Theophilus bishop of Antioch contemporary with Irenaeus under the title of the "evangelic voice  Ib vol i p  " and the copious works of Clement of Alexandria published within fifteen years of the same time ascribe to the books of the New Testament the various titles of "sacred books""divine scriptures""divinely inspired scriptures""scriptures of the Lord""the true evangelical canon  Ib vol ii p  "  VI Tertullian who joins on with Clement beside adopting most of the names and epithets above noticed calls the gospels "our Digesta" in allusion as it should seem to some collection of Roman laws  Ib p  then extant  VII By Origen who came thirty years after Tertullian the same and others no less strong titles are applied to the Christian scriptures and in addition thereunto this  writer frequently speaks of the "Old and New Testament""the ancient and new scriptures""the ancient and new oracles  Ib vol iii p  "  VIII In Cyprian who was not twenty years later they are "books of the spirit""divine fountains""fountains of the divine fulness  Ib vol iv p  "  The expressions we have thus quoted are evidences of high and peculiar respect They all occur within two centuries from the publication of the books Some of them commence with the companions of the apostles and they increase in number and variety through a series of writers touching upon one another and deduced from the first age of the religion  SECT V  Our scriptures were publicly read and expounded in the religious assemblies of the early Christians  JUSTIN MARTYR who wrote in the year which was seventy or eighty years after some and less probably after others of the gospels were published giving in his first apology an account to the Emperor of the Christian worship has this remarkable passage  "The  memoirs of the apostles  or the writings of the prophets are  read  according as the time allows and when the reader has ended the president makes a discourse exhorting to the imitation of so excellent things  Lard Cred vol i p  "  A few short observations will shew the value of this testimony  The "memoirs of the apostles" Justin in another place expressly tells us are what are called "gospels" and that they were the gospels which we now use is made certain by Justin's numerous quotations of  them  and his silence about any others  Justin describes the general usage of the Christian church  Justin does not speak of it as recent or newly instituted but in the terms in which men speak of established customs  II Tertullian who followed Justin at the distance of about fifty years in his account of the religious assemblies of Christians as they were conducted in his time says "We come together to recollect the divine scriptures we nourish our faith raise our hope confirm our trust by the sacred word  Ib vol ii p  "  III Eusebius records of Origen and cites for his authority the letters of Bishops contemporary with Origen that when he went into Palestine about the year which was only years after the date of Tertullian's testimony he was desired by the Bishops of that country to discourse and expound the scriptures publicly in the church though he was not yet ordained a presbyter  Ib vol iii p  This anecdote recognizes the usage not only of reading but of expounding the scriptures and both as subsisting in full force Origen also himself bears witness to the same practice "This says he we do when the scriptures are read in the church and when the discourse for explication is delivered to the people  Ib p  " And what is a still more ample testimony many homilies of his upon the scriptures of the New Testament delivered by him in the assemblies of the church are still extant  IV Cyprian whose age was not twenty  years lower than that of Origen gives his people an account of having ordained two persons who were before confessors to be readers and what they were to read appears by the reason which he gives for his choice"Nothing says Cyprian can be more fit than that he who has made a glorious confession of the Lord should read publicly in the church that he who has shewn himself willing to die a martyr should read the  gospel of Christ  by which martyrs are made  Ib vol iv p  "  V Intimations of the same custom may be traced in a great number of writers in the beginning and throughout the whole of the fourth century Of these testimonies I will only use one as being of itself express and full Augustine who appeared near the conclusion of the century displays the benefit of the Christian religion on this very account the public reading of the scriptures in the churches "where says he is a confluence  of all sorts of people of both sexes and where they hear how they ought to live well in this world that they may deserve to live happily and eternally in another" And this custom he declares to be universal "The canonical books of scripture being read every where the miracles therein recorded are well known to all people  Ib vol x p et seq  "  It does not appear that any books other than our present scriptures were thus publicly read except that the epistle of Clement was read in the church of Corinth to which it had been addressed and in some others and that the Shepherd of Hermas was read in many churches Nor does it subtract much from the value of the argument that these two writings partly come within it because we allow them to be the genuine writings of apostolical men There is not the least evidence that any other gospel than the four which we receive was ever admitted to this distinction  SECT VI  Commentaries were anciently written upon the scriptures harmonies formed out of them different copies carefully collated and versions made of them into different languages  NO greater proof can be given of the esteem in which these books were holden by the ancient Christians or of the sense then entertained of their value and importance than the industry bestowed upon them And it ought to be observed that the value and importance of these books consisted entirely in their genuineness and truth There was nothing in them as works of taste or as compositions which could have induced any one to have written a note upon them Moreover it shows that they were even  then  considered as ancient books Men do not write comments upon publications of their  own times therefore the testimonies cited under this head afford an evidence which carries up the evangelic writings much beyond the age of the testimonies themselves and to that of their reputed authors  I Tatian a follower of Justin Martyr and who flourished about the year composed a harmony or collation of the gospels which he called  Diatessaron  of the four  Lard vol i p  The title as well as the work is remarkable because it shews that then as now there were four and only four gospels in general use with Christians And this was little more than a hundred years after the publication of some of them  II Pantaenus of the Alexandrian school a man of great reputation and learning who came twenty years after Tatian wrote many commentaries upon the holy scriptures which as Jerome testifies were extant in his time  Ib vol i p    III Clement of Alexandria wrote short explications of many books of the Old and New Testament  Ib vol ii p  "  IV Tertullian appeals from the authority of a later version then in use to the "authentic Greek  Ib p  "  V An anonymous author quoted by Eusebius and who appears to have written about the year appeals to the  ancient copies  of the scriptures in refutation of some corrupt readings alledged by the followers of Artemon  Ib vol iii p    VI The same Eusebius mentioning by name several writers of the church who lived at this time and concerning whom he says "There still remain divers monuments of the laudable industry of those ancient and ecclesiastical men"  i e  of Christian writers who were considered as ancient in the year adds "There are besides treatises of  many others whose names we have not been able to learn orthodox and ecclesiastical men as the interpretations of the divine scriptures given by each of them show  Ib vol ii p  "  VII The five last testimonies may be referred to the year immediately after which a period of thirty years gives us  Julius Africanus who wrote an epistle upon the apparent difference in the genealogies in Matthew and Luke which he endeavours to reconcile by the distinction of natural and legal descent and conducts his hypothesis with great industry through the whole series of generations  Ib vol iii p    Ammonius a learned Alexandrian who composed as Tatian had done a harmony of  the four gospels  which proves as Tatian's work did that there were four gospels and no more at this time in use in the church It affords also an instance of the zeal of Christians  for those writings and of their solicitude about them  Ib vol iii p    And above both these Origen who wrote commentaries or homilies upon most of the books included in the New Testament and upon no other books but these In particular he wrote upon St John's gospel very largely upon St Matthew's and commentaries or homilies upon the Acts of the Apostles  Ib p    VIII In addition to these the third century likewise contains  Dionysius of Alexandria a very learned man who compared with great accuracy the accounts in the four gospels of the time of Christ's resurrection adding a reflection which shewed his opinion of their authority"Let us not think that the evangelists disagree or contradict each other although there be some small difference but let us  honestly and faithfully endeavour to reconcile what we read  Ib vol iv p  "  Victorin bishop of Pettaw in Germany who wrote comments upon St Matthew's gospel  Ib p    Lucian a presbyter of Antioch and Hesychius an Egyptian bishop who put forth editions of the New Testament  IX The fourth century supplies a catalogue  Eusebius A D  Juvencus Spain  Theodore Thrace  Hilary Poictiers  Fortunatus  Apollinarius of Laodicca  Damasus Rome  Gregory Nyssen  Didymus of Alex  Ambrose of Milan  Diodore of Tarsus  Gaudent of Brescia  Theodore of Cilicia  Jerome  Chrysostom  of fourteen writers who expended their labours upon the books of the New Testament and whose works or names are come down to our times amongst which number it may be sufficient for the purpose  of shewing the sentiments and studies of learned Christians of that age to notice the following  Eusebius in the very beginning of the century wrote expressly upon the discrepancies observable in the gospels and likewise a treatise in which he pointed out what things are related by four what by three what by two and what by one evangelist  Ib vol viii p  This author also testifies what is certainly a material piece of evidence "that the writings of the apostles had obtained such an esteem as to be translated into every language both of Greeks and Barbarians and to be diligently studied by all nations  Ib p  " This testimony was given about the year how long  before  that date these translations were made does not appear  Damasus bishop of Rome corresponded with St Jerome upon the exposition of difficult texts of scripture and in a letter still  remaining desires Jerome to give him a clear explanation of the word Hosanna found in the New Testament "he Damasus having met with very different interpretations of it in the Greek and Latin commentaries of catholic writers which he had read  Ib vol ix p  " This last clause shews the number and variety of commentaries then extant  Gregory of Nyssen at one time appeals to the most exact copies of St Mark's gospel at another time compares together and proposes to reconcile the several accounts of the resurrection  given by the four evangelists  which limitation proves that there were no other histories of Christ deemed authentic beside these or included in the same character with these This writer observes acutely enough that the disposition of the clothes in the sepulchre the naplkin that was about our Saviour's head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself did not bespeak the terror  and hurry of thieves and therefore resutes the story of the body being stolen  Ib vol ix p    Ambrose bishop of Milan remarked various readings in the Latin copies of the New Testament and appeals to the original Greek  And Jerome towards the conclusion of this century put forth an edition of the New Testament in Latin corrected at least as to the gospels by Greek copies "and those he says ancient"  Lastly Chrysostom it is well known delivered and published a great many homilies or sermons upon the Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles  It is needless to bring down this article lower but it is of importance to add that there is no example of Christian writers of the three first centuries composing comments  upon any other books than those which are found in the New Testament except the single one of Clement of Alexandria commenting upon a book called the Revelation of Peter  Of the  ancient versions  of the New Testament one of the most valuable is the Syriac Syriac was the language of Palestine when Christianity was there first established And although the books of scripture were written in Greek for the purpose of a more extended circulation than within the precincts of Judea yet it is probable that they would soon be translated into the vulgar language of the country where the religion first prevailed Accordingly a Syriac translation is now extant all along so far as it appears used by the inhabitants of Syria bearing many internal marks of high antiquity supported in its pretensions by the uniform tradition of the East and confirmed by the discovery of many very ancient manuscripts in the libraries of Europe It is about years since a Bishop of Antioch sent a copy  of this translation into Europe to be printed and this seems to be the first time that the translation became generally known to these parts of the world The Bishop of Antioch's testament was found to contain all our books except the second epistle of Peter the second and third of John and the Revelation which books however have since been discovered in that language in some ancient manuscripts of Europe But in this collection no other book beside what is in ours appears ever to have had a place And which is very worthy of observation the text though preserved in a remote country and without communication with ours differs from ours very little and in nothing that is important  Jones on the Canon vol i c xiv    SECT VII  Our scriptures were received by ancient Christians of different sects and persuasions by many heretics as well as catholics and were usually appealed to by both sides in the controversies which arose in those days  THE three most ancient topics of controversy amongst Christians were the authority of the Jewish institution the origin of evil and the nature of Christ Upon the first of these we find in very early times one class of heretics rejecting the Old Testament entirely another contending for the obligation of its law in all its parts throughout its whole extent and over every one who sought acceptance with God Upon the two latter subjects a natural perhaps and venial but a fruitless eager and impatient curiosity prompted by the philosophy  and by the scholastic habits of the age which carried men much into bold hypotheses and conjectural solutions raised amongst some who professed Christianity very wild and unfounded opinions I think there is no reason to believe that the number of these bore any considerable proportion to the body of the Christian church and amidst the disputes which such opinions necessarily occasioned it is a great satisfaction to perceive what in a vast plurality of instances we do perceive all sides recurring to the same scriptures  I  The materials of the sormer part of this section are taken from Dr Lardner's history of the hereties of the two first centuries published since his death with additions by the Rev Mr Hogg of Exeter and inserted into the ninth volume of his works of the edition of  Basilides lived near the age of the apostles about the year or perhaps sooner  Vol ix p  He rejected the Jewish institution not as spurious but as proceeding from a being inferior to the true God and  in other respects advanced a scheme of theology widely different from the general doctrine of the Christian church and which as it gained over some disciples was warmly opposed by Christian writers of the second and third century In these writings there is positive evidence that Basilides received the gospel of Matthew and there is no sufficient proof that he rejected any of the other three on the contrary it appears that he wrote a commentary upon the gospel so copious as to be divided into twentyfour books  Ib vol ix ed p    II The Valentinians appeared about the same time  Ib pa  Their heresy consisted in certain notions concerning angelic natures which can hardly be rendered intelligible to a modern reader They seem however to have acquired as much importance as any of the separatists of that early age Of this sect Irenaeus who wrote A D expressly records that they endeavoured to fetch  arguments for their opinions from the evangelic and apostolic writings  Vol i p  Heracleon one of the most celebrated of the sect and who lived probably so early as the year wrote commentaries upon Luke and John  Vol ix ed p  Some observations also of his upon Matthew are preserved by Origen  Ib  Nor is there any reason to doubt that he received the whole New Testament  III The Carpocratians were also an early heresy little if at all later than the two preceding  Ib  Some of their opinions resembled what we at this day mean by Socinianism With respect to the scriptures they are specifically charged by Irenaeus and by Epiphanius with endeavouring to pervert a passage in Matthew which amounts to a positive proof that they received that gospel  Ib    Negatively they are not accused by their adversaries of rejecting any part of the New Testament  IV The Sethians A D  Vol ix ed p  the Montanists A D  Ib p  the Marcosians  Ib p  Hermogenes A D  Ib p  Praxias A D  Ib p  Artemon A D  Ib p  Theodotus A D all included under the denomination of heretics and all engaged in controversies with catholic Christians received the scriptures of the New Testament  V Tatian who lived in the year went into many extravagant opinions was the founder of a sect called Encratites and was deeply involved in disputes with the Christians of that age yet Tatian so received the four gospels as to compose a harmony from them  VI From a writer quoted by Eusebius of alout the year it is apparent that they who at that time contended for the mere humanity of Christ argued from the scriptures for they are accused by this  writer of making alterations in their copies in order to favour their opinions  Ib vol iii p    VII Origen's sentiments excited great controversies the Bishops of Rome and Alexandria and many others condemning the Bishops of the East espousing them yet there is not the smallest question but that both the advocates and adversaries of these opinions acknowledged the same authority of scripture In his time which the reader will remember was about one hundred and fifty years after the scriptures were published many diffentions subsisted amongst Christians with which they were reproached by Celsus yet Origen who has recorded this accusation without contradicting it nevertheless testifies "that the four gospels were received  without dispute  by the whole church of God under heaven  Ib vol iv p  "  VIII Paul of Samosata about thirty years after Origen so distinguished himself in the  controversy concerning the nature of Christ as to be the subject of two councils or synods assembled at Antioch upon his opinions Yet he is not charged by his adversaries with rejecting any book of the New Testament On the contrary Epiphanius who wrote a history of heretics a hundred years afterwards says that Paul endeavoured to support his doctrine by texts of scripture And Vincentius Lirinensis A D speaking of Paul and other heretics of the same age has these words "Here perhaps some one may ask whether heretics also urge the testimony of scripture They urge it indeed explicitly and vehemently for you may see them flying through every book of the sacred law  Ib vol xi p  "  IX A controversy at the same time existed with the Noetians or Sabellians who seem to have gone into the opposite extreme from that of Paul of Samosata and his followers Yet according to the express testimony  of Epiphanius Sabellius received all the scriptures And with both sects catholic writers constantly alledge the scriptures and reply to the arguments which their opponents drew from particular texts  We have here therefore a proof that parties who were the most opposite and irreconcileable to one another acknowledged the authority of scripture with equal deference  X And as a general testimony to the same point may be produced what was said by one of the Bishops of the council of Carthage which was holden a little before this time "I am of opinion that blasphemous and wicked heretics who  pervert  the sacred and adorable words of the scriptures should be execrated  Ib vol xi p  " Undoubtedly what they perverted they received  XI The Millenium Novatianism the  baptism of heretics the keeping of Easter engaged also the attention and divided the opinions of Christians at and before that time and by the way it may be observed that such disputes though on some accounts to be blamed shewed how much men were in earnest upon the subject yet every one appealed for the grounds of his opinion to scripture authority Dionysius of Alexandria who flourished A D describing a conference or public disputation with the Millenarians of Egypt confesses of them though their adversary "that they embraced whatever could be made out by good arguments from the holy scriptures  Ib vol iv p  " Novatus A D distinguished by some rigid sentiments concerning the reception of those who had lapsed and the founder of a numerous sect in his few remaining works quotes the gospel with the same respect as other Christians did and concerning his followers the testimony of Socrates who wrote about the year is positive viz  "That in the disputes between the catholics and them each side endeavoured to support itself by the authority of the divine scriptures  Ib vol v p  "  XII The Donatists who sprung up in the year used the same scriptures as we do "Produce saith Augustine some proof from the scriptures whose authority is common to us both  Ib vol vii p  "  XIII It is perfectly notorious that in the Arian controversy which arose soon after the year both sides appealed to the same scriptures and with equal professions of deference and regard The Arians in their council of Antioch A D pronounce that "if any one contrary to the sound doctrine of the scriptures say that the son is a creature as one of the creatures let him be anathema  Ib p  " They and the Athanasians  mutually accuse each other of using  unscriptural  phrases which was a mutual acknowledgment of the conclusive authority of scripture  XIV The Priscillianists A D  Ib vol ix p  the Pelagians A D  Ib vol xi p  received the same scriptures as we do  XV The testimony of Chrysostom who lived near the year is so positive in assirmation of the proposition which we maintain that it may form a proper conclusion of the argument "The general reception of the gospels is a proof that their history is true and consistent for since the writing of the gospels many heresies have arisen holding opinions contrary to what is contained in them who yet receive the gospels either entire or in part  Ib vol x p  " I am not moved by what may seem a deduction  from Chrysostom's testimony the words "entire or in part" for if all the parts which were ever questioned in our gospels were given up it would not affect the miraculous origin of the religion in the smallest degree  e g  Cerinthus is said by Epiphanius to have received the gospel of Matthew but not entire What the omissions were does not appear The common opinion that he rejected the two first chapters seems to have been a mistake  Ib vol ix ed p  It is agreed however by all who have given any account of Cerinthus that he taught that the Holy Ghost whether he meant by that name a person or a power descended upon Jesus at his baptism that Jesus from this time performed many miracles and that he appeared after his death He must have retained therefore the essential parts of the history  Of all the ancient heretics the most extraordinary  was Marcion  Ib sect ii c x Also Michael vol i c sect xviii  One of his tenets was the rejection of the Old Testament as proceeding from an inferior and impersect deity and in pursuance of this hypothesis he crased from the New and that as it should seem without entering into any critical reasons every passage which recognized the Jewish scriptures He spared not a text which contradicted his opinion It is reasonable to believe that Marcion treated books as he treated texts yet this rash and wild controversialist published a recension or chastised edition of St Luke's gospel containing the leading facts and all which is necessary to authenticate the religion This example affords proof that there were always some points and those the main points which neither wildness nor rashness neither the sury of opposition nor the intemperance of controversy would venture to call in question There is no reason to believe that Marcion though full  of resentment against the catholic Christians▪ ever charged them with forging their books "The Gospel of St Matthew the Epistle to the Hebrews with those of St Peter and St James as well as the Old Testament in general he said were writings not for Christians but for Jews  I have transcribed this sentence from Michaelis p who has not however referred to the authority upon which he attributes these words to Marcion  " This declaration shews the ground upon which Marcion proceeded in his mutilation of the scriptures viz his dislike of the passages or the books Marcion slourished about the year  Dr Lardner in his General Review sums up this head of evidence in the following words "Noetus Paul of Samosata Sabellius Marcellus Photinus the Novatians Donatists Manicheans  This must be with an exception however of Faustus who lived so late as the year  Priscillianists beside Artemon the Audians the Arians and divers others all received most or all  the same books of the New Testament which the catholics received and agreed in a like respect for them as writ by apostles or their disciples and companions  Ib vol xii p Dr Lardner's future enquiries supplied him with many other instances  "  SECT VIII  The four Gospels the Acts of the Apostles thirteen Epistles of St Paul the first Epistle of John and the first of Peter were received without doubt by those who doubted concerning the other books which are included in our present canon  I STATE this proposition because if made out it shews that the authenticity of their books was a subject amongst the early Christians of consideration and enquiry and that where there was cause of doubt they did doubt a circumstance which strengthens very much their testimony to such books as were received by them with full acquiescence  I Jerome in his account of Caius who was probably a presbyter of Rome and who flourished near the year records of him that reckoning up only thirteen  epistles of Paul he says the fourteenth which is inscribed to the Hebrews is not his and then Jerome adds "With the Romans to this day it is not looked upon as Paul's" This agrees in the main with the account given by Eusebius of the same ancient author and his work except that Eusebius delivers his own remark in more guarded terms "and indeed to this very time by  some  of the Romans this epistle is not thought to be the apostle's  Ib vol iii p  "  II Origen about twenty years after Caius quoting the epistle to the Hebrews observes that some might dispute the authority of that epistle and therefore proceeds to quote to the same point as  undoubted  books of scripture the Gospel of St Matthew the Acts of the Apostles and Paul's first Epistle to the Thessalonians  Ib p  And in another place this author speaks of the Epistle to the Hebrews thus"The account come down to us is various some  saying that Clement who was bishop of Rome wrote this epistle others that it was Luke the same who writ the Gospel and the Acts" Speaking also in the same paragraph of Peter "Peter says he has left one epistle acknowledged let it be granted likewise that he wrote a second for it is doubted of" And of John "He has also left one epistle of a very few lines grant also a second and a third for all do not allow these to be genuine" Now let it be noted that Origen who thus discriminates and thus confesses his own doubts and the doubts which subsisted in his time expressly witnesses concerning the four gospels "that they alone are received without dispute by the whole church of God under heaven  Ib vol iii p  "  III Dionysius of Alexandria in the year doubts concerning the Book of Revelation whether it was written by St John states the grounds of his doubt represents the diversity of opinion concerning it in his  own time and before his time  Ib vol iv p  Yet the same Dionysius uses and collates the four gospels in a manner which shews that he entertained not the smallest suspicion of  their  authority and in a manner also which shews that they and they alone were received as authentic histories of Christ  Ib p    IV But this section may be said to have been framed on purpose to introduce to the reader two remarkable passages extant in Eusebius's ecclesiastical history The first passage opens with these words"Let us observe the writings of the apostle John which are  uncontradicted  and first of all must be mentioned as acknowledged of all the gospel according to him well known to all the churches under heaven" The author then proceeds to relate the occasions of writing the gospels and the reasons for placing St John's the last manifestly speaking of all the four as parallel in their authority and in the certainty of their original  Ib vol viii p  The  second passage is taken from a chapter the title of which is "Of the Scriptures  universally acknowledged  and of those that are not such" Eusebius begins his enumeration in the following manner"  In the first place  are to be ranked the sacred four Gospels then the book of the Acts of the Apostles after that are to be reckoned the Epistles of Paul In the next place that called the first Epistle of John and the Epistle of Peter are to be esteemed authentic After this is to be placed if it be thought fit the Revelation of John about which we shall observe the different opinions at proper seasons Of the controverted but yet well known or approved by the most are that called the Epistle of James and that of Jude and the second of Peter and the second and third of John whether they are written by the evangelist or another of the same name  Ib vol viii p  " He then proceeds to reckon up five others not in our canon which he calls in one place  spurious  in another  controverted  meaning as appears to me nearly the same thing by these two words  That Eusebius could not intend by the word rendered "spurious" what we at present mean by it is evident from a clause in this very chapter where speaking of the Gospels of Peter and Thomas and Matthias and some others he says "They are not so much as to be reckoned among the  spurious  but are to be rejected as altogether absurd and impious" Vol viii p    It is manifest from this passage that the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles the parts of scripture with which our concern principally lies were acknowledged without dispute even by those who raised objections or entertained doubts about some other parts of the same collection But the passage proves something more than this The author was extremely conversant in the writings of Christians which had been published from the commencement of the institution to his own time and it was from these writings that he drew his knowledge of the character and reception of the books in question That Eusebius recurred to this  medium of information and that he had examined with attention this species of proof is shewn first by a passage in the very chapter we are quoting in which speaking of the books which he calls spurious "None he says of the ecclesiastical writers in the succession of the apostles have vouchsafed to make any mention of them in their writings" and secondly by another passage of the same work wherein speaking of the first epistle of Peter "This he says the presbyters of ancient times have quoted in their writings as undoubtedly genuine  Ib p  " and then speaking of some other writings bearing the name of Peter "We know he says that they have not been delivered down to us in the number of catholic writings forasmuch as no ecclesiastical writer of the ancients or of our times has made use of testimonies out of them" "But in the progress of this history" the author proceeds "we shall make it our business to shew together with the successions from the  apostles what ecclesiastical writers in every age have used such writings as these which are contradicted and what they have said with regard to the scriptures received in the New Testament  and acknowledged by all  and with regard to those which are not such  Ib p  "  After this it is reasonable to believe that when Eusebius states the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles as uncontradicted uncontested and acknowledged by all and when he places them in opposition not only to those which were spurious in our sense of that term but to those which were controverted and even to those which were well known and approved by many yet doubted of by some he represents not only the sense of his own age but the result of the evidence which the writings of prior ages from the apostle's time to his own had furnished to his enquiries The opinion of Eusebius and his contemporaries appears to have been founded upon the testimony of writers  whom they  then  called ancient and we may observe that such of the works of these writers as have come down to our times entirely consirm the judgement and support the distinction which Eusebius proposes The books which he calls "books universally acknowledged" are in fact used and quoted in the remaining works of Christian writers during the years between the apostle's time and that of Eusebius much more frequently than and in a different manner from those the authority of which he tells us was disputed  SECT IX  Our historical scriptures were attacked by the early adversaries of Christianity as containing the accounts upon which the religion was founded  I NEAR the middle of the second century Celsus a heathen philosopher wrote a professed treatise against Christianity To this treatise Origen who came about fifty years after him published an answer in which he frequently recites his adversary's words and arguments The work of Celsus is lost but that of Origen remains Origen appears to have given us the words of Celsus where he professes to give them very faithfully and amongst other reasons for thinking so this is one that the objection as stated by him from Celsus is sometimes stronger than his own answer I think it also probable that Origen in his answer has retailed  a large portion of the work of Celsus "That it may not be suspected he says that we pass by any chapters because we have no answers at hand I have thought it best according to my ability to confute every thing proposed by him not so much observing the natural order of things as the order which he has taken himself  Or cont Cels l i sect  "  Celsus wrote about years after the Gospels were published and therefore any notices of these books from him are extremely important for their antiquity They are however rendered more so by the character of the author for the reception credit and notoriety of these books must have been well established amongst Christians to have made them subjects of animadversion and opposition by strangers and by enemies It evinces the truth of what Chrysostom two centuries afterwards observed that "the Gospels when written were not hid in a corner or buried in obscurity but they were  made known to all the world before enemies as well as others even as they are now  In Mat hom i  "  Celsus or the Jew whom he personates uses these words"I could say many things concerning the affairs of Jesus and those too different from those written by the disciples of Jesus but I purposely omit them  Lardner's Jewish and Heathen Testim vol ii p  " Upon this passage it has been rightly observed that it is not easy to believe that if Celsus could have contradicted the disciples upon good evidence in any material point he would have omitted to do so and that the assertion is what Origen calls it a mere oratorical flourish  It is sufficient however to prove that in the time of Celsus there were books well known and allowed to be written by the disciples of Jesus which books contained a history of him By the term  disciple  Celsus  does not mean the followers of Jesus in general for them he calls Christians or believers or the like but those who had been taught by Jesus himself  i e  his apostles and companions  In another passage Celsus accuses the Christians of altering the gospel  Ib p  The accusation refers to some variations in the readings of particular passages for Celsus goes on to object that when they are pressed hard and one reading has been confuted they disown that and fly to another We cannot perceive from Origen that Celsus specified any particular instances and without such specification the charge is of no value But the true conclusion to be drawn from it is that there were in the hands of the Christians histories which were even then of some standing for various readings and corruptions do not take place in recent productions  The former quotation the reader will  remember proved that these books were composed by the disciples of Jesus strictly so called the present quotation shews that though objections were taken by the adversaries of the religion to the integrity of these books none were made to their genuineness  In a third passage the Jew whom Celsus introduces shuts up an argument in this manner"These things then we have alledged to you out of  your own writings  not needing any other weapons  Ib p  " It is manisest that this boast proceeds upon the supposition that the books over which the writer affects to triumph possessed an authority by which Christians confessed themselves to be bound  That the books to which Celsus refers were no other than our present Gospels is made out by his allusions to various passages still found in these Gospels Celsus takes notice of the  genealogies  which sixes two of  these gospels of the precepts Resist not him that injures you and If a man strike thee on the one cheek offer to him the other also  Ib p  of the woes denounced by Christ of his predictions of his saying that it is impossible to serve two masters  Ib p  of the purple robe the crown of thorns and the reed in his hand of the blood that flowed from the body of Jesus upon the cross  Ib p  which circumstance is recorded by John alone and what is instar omnium for the purpose for which we produce it of the difference in the accounts given of the resurrection by the evangelists some mentioning two angels at the sepulchre others only one  Ib p    It is extremely material to remark that Celsus not only perpetually referred to the accounts of Christ contained in the four Gospels  The particulars of which the above are only a few are well collected by Mr Bryant p  but that he referred to no other accounts that he founded none of his objections  to Christianity upon any thing delivered in spurious gospels  II What Celsus was in the second century Porphyry became in the third His work which was a large and formal treatise against the Christian religion is not extant We must be content therefore to gather his objections from Christian writers who have noticed in order to answer them and enough remains of this species of information to prove completely that Porphyry's animadversions were directed against the contents of our present Gospels and of the Acts of the Apostles Porphyry considering that to overthrow  them  was to overthrow the religion Thus he objects to the repetition of a generation in St Matthew's genealogy to Matthew's call to the quotation of a text from Isaiah which is found in a psalm ascribed to Asaph to the calling of the lake of Tiberias a sea to the expression in St Matthew "the abomination of desolation" to the variation in Matthew and Mark upon the text "the voice of one crying in the  wilderness" Matthew citing it from Isaias Mark from the prophets to John's application of the term "Word" to Christ's change of intention about going up to the feast of tabernacles John vii to the judgement denounced by St Peter upon Ananias and Sapphira which he calls an imprecation of death  Jewish and Heathen Test vol iii p et seq    The instances here alledged serve in some measure to shew the nature of Porphyry's objections and prove that Porphyry had read the Gospels with that sort of attention which a writer would employ who regarded them as the depositaries of the religion which he attacked Beside these specifications there exists in the writings of ancient Christians general evidence that the places of scripture upon which Porphyry had remarked were v ey numerous  In some of the above cited examples Porphyry speaking of St Matthew calls him  your evangelist  he also uses the term Evangelists in the plural number What was said of Celsus is true likewise of Porphyry that it does not appear that he considered any history of Christ except these as having authority with Christians  III A third great writer against the Christian religion was the Emperor Julian whose work was composed about a century after that of Porphyry  In various long extracts transcribed from this work by Cyril and Jerome it appears  Ib vol iv p et seq  that Julian noticed  by name  Matthew and Luke in the difference between their genealogies of Christ that he objected to Matthew's application of the prophecy "Out of Egypt have I called my son" ii and to that of "a virgin shall conceive" i that he recited sayings of Christ and various passages of his history in the very words of the evangelists in particular that  Jesus healed lame and blind people and exorcised demoniacs in the villages of Bethsaida and Bethany that he alledged that none of Christ's disciples ascribed to him the creation of the world except John that neither Paul nor Matthew nor Luke nor Mark have dared to call Jesus God that John wrote later than the other evangelists and at a time when a great number of men in the cities of Greece and Italy were converted that he alludes to the conversion of Cornelius and of Sergius Paulus to Peter's vision to the circular letter sent by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem which are all recorded in the Acts of the Apostles by which quoting of the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles and by quoting no other Julian shews that these were the historical books and the only historical books received by Christians as of authority and as the authentic memoirs of Jesus Christ of his apostles and of the doctrines taught by them But Julian's testimony does something more than represent the judgement of the Christian church in his time It discovers also his  own He himself expressly states the early date of these records he calls them by the names which they now bear He all along supposes he nowhere attempts to question their genuineness  The argument in favour of the books of the New Testament drawn from the notice taken of their contents by the early writers against the religion is very considerable It proves that the accounts which Christians had then were the accounts which we have now that our present scriptures were theirs It proves moreover that neither Celsus in the second Porphyry in the third nor Julian in the fourth century suspected the authenticity of these books or ever insinuated that Christians were mistaken in the authors to whom they ascribed them Not one of them expressed an opinion upon this subject different from that which was held by Christians And when we consider how much it would have availed them to have cast a doubt upon this point if they could and how ready they shewed themselves to  be to take every advantage in their power and that they were all men of learning and enquiry their concession or rather their suffrage upon the subject is extremely valuable  In the case of Porphyry it is made still stronger by the consideration that he did in fact support himself by this species of objection when he saw any room for it or when his acuteness could supply any pretence for alledging it The prophecy of Daniel he attacked upon this very ground of spuriousness insisting that it was written after the time of Antiochus Epiphanes and maintains his charge of forgery by some farfetched indeed but very subtle criticisms Concerning the writings of the New Testament no trace of this suspicion is anywhere to be sound in him  Michaelis's Introduction to the New Testament vol i p Marsh's Translation    SECT X  Formal catalogues of authentic scriptures were published in all which our present sacred bistories were included  THIS species of evidence comes later than the rest as it was not natural that catalogues of any particular class of books should be put forth until Christian writings became numerous or until some writings shewed themselves claiming titles which did not belong to them and thereby rendering it necessary to separate books of authority from others But when it does appear it is extremely satisfactory the catalogues though numerous and made in countries at a wide distance from one another differing very little differing in nothing which is material and all containing the sour Gospels To this last article there is no exception  I In the writings of Origen which remain and in some extracts preserved by Eusebius from works of his which are now lost there are enumerations of the books of scripture in which the four Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles are distinctly and honourably specified and in which no books appear beside what are now received  Lardner's Cred vol iii p et seq vol viii p  The reader by this time will easily recollect that the date of Origen's works is A D  II Athanasius about a century afterwards delivered a catalogue of the books of the New Testament in form containing our scriptures and no others of which he says "In these alone the doctrine of religion is taught let no man add to them or take any thing from them  Ib vol viii p  "  III About years after Athanasius Cyril bishop of Jerusalem set forth a catalogue of the books of scripture publicly  read at that time in the church of Jerusalem exactly the same as ours except that the "Revelation" is omitted  Ib vol viii p    IV And fifteen years after Cyril the Council of Laodicea delivered an authoritative catalogue of canonical scripture like Cyril's the same as ours with the omission of the "Revelation"  V Catalogues now become frequent Within thirty years after the last date that is from the year to near the conclusion of the fourth century we have catalogues by Epiphanius  Ib p  by Gregory Nazienzen  Ib vol ix p  by Philaster bishop of Brescia in Italy  Ib p  by Amphilochius bishop of Iconium all as they are sometimes called  clean  catalogues that is they admit no books into the number beside what we now receive and all for every purpose of historic evidence the same as ours  Epiphanius omits the Acts of the Apostles This must have been an accidental mistake either in him or in some copyist of his work for he elsewhere expressly refers to this book and ascribes it to Luke    VI Within the same period Jerome the most learned Christian writer of his age delivered a catalogue of the books of the New Testament recognizing every book now received with the intimation of a doubt concerning the Epistle to the Hebrews alone and taking not the least notice of any book which is not now received  Ib vol x p    VII Contemporary with Jerome who lived in Palestine was St Augustine in Africa who published likewise a catalogue without joining to the scriptures as books of authority any other ecclesiastical writing whatever and without omitting one which we at this day acknowledge  Ib p    VIII And with these concurs another contemporary writer Rufen presbyter of Aquileia whose catalogue like theirs is perfect and unmixed and concludes with  these remarkable words "These are the volumes which the Fathers have included in the canon and out of which they would have us prove the doctrine of our faith  Ib vol x p  "  SECT XI  These propositions cannot be predicated of any of those books which are commonly called apocryphal books of the New Testament  I Do not know that the objection taken from apocryphal writings is at present much relied upon by scholars But there are many who hearing that various gospels existed in ancient times under the names of the apostles may have taken up a notion that the selection of our present gospels from the rest was rather an arbitrary or accidental choice than founded in any clear and certain cause of preference To these it may be very useful to know the truth of the case I observe therefore  I That beside our Gospels and the Acts of the Apostles no Christian history claiming  to be written by an apostle or apostolical man is quoted within three hundred years after the birth of Christ by any writer now extant or known or if quoted is not quoted with marks of censure and rejection  I have not advanced this assertion without enquiry and I doubt not but that the passages cited by Mr Jones and Dr Lardner under the several titles which the apocryphal books bear or a reference to the places where they are mentioned as collected in a very accurate table published in the year by the Rev J Atkinson will make out the truth of the proposition to the satisfaction of every fair and competent judgment If there be any book which may seem to form an exception to the observation it is a Hebrew Gospel which was circulated under the various titles of the Gospel according to the Hebrews the Gospel of the Nazarenes of the Ebionites sometimes called of the Twelve by some ascribed to St Matthew This Gospel is  once  and only  once  cited by Clement Alexandrinus who lived the reader will remember in the latter part of the second century and which same Clement quotes one or other of our four Gospels in almost every page of his work It is also twice mentioned by Origen A D and both times with marks of diminution and discredit And this is the ground upon which the exception stands But what is still more material to observe is that this Gospel in the main agreed with our present Gospel of St Matthew  In applying to this Gospel what Jerome in the latter end of the fourth century has mentioned of a Hebrew Gospel I think it probable that we sometimes confound it with a Hebrew copy of St Matthew's Gospel whether an original or version which was then extant    Now if with this account of the apocryphal Gospels we compare what we have read concerning the canonical scriptures in the preceding sections or even recollect that general but wellfounded assertion of Dr Lardner's "That in the remaining works of Irenaeus Clement of Alexandria  and Tertullian who all lived in the two first centuries there are more and larger quotations of the small volume of the New Testament than of all the works of Cicero by writers of all characters for several ages  Lard Cred vol xii p  " and if to this we add that notwithstanding the loss of many works of the primitive times of Christianity we have within the abovementioned period the remains of Christian writers who lived in Palestine Syria Asia Minor Egypt the part of Africa that used the Latin tongue in Crete Greece Italy and Gaul in all which remains references are found to our evangelists I apprehend that we shall perceive a clear and broad line of division between those writings and all others pretending to a similar authority  II But beside certain  histories  which assumed the names of Apostles and which were forgeries properly so called there were some other Christian writings in the whole or in part of an historical nature which  though not forgeries are denominated apocryphal as being of uncertain or of no authority  Of this second class of writings I have found only two which are noticed by any author of the three first centuries without express terms of condemnation and these are the one a book entitled the Preaching of Peter quoted repeatedly by Clement Alexandrinus A D the other a book entitled the Revelation of Peter upon which the abovementioned Clement Alexandrinus is said by Eusebius to have written notes and which is twice cited in a work still extant ascribed to the same author  I conceive therefore that the proposition we have before advanced even after it hath been subjected to every exception of every kind that can be alledged separates by a wide interval our historical scriptures from all other writings which profess to give an account of the same subject  We may be permitted however to add  That there is no evidence that any spurious or apocryphal books whatever existed in the first century of the Christan aera in which century all our historical books are proved to have been extant "There are no quotations of any such books in the apostolical fathers by whom I mean Barnabas Clement of Rome Hermas Ignatius and Polycarp whose writings reach from about the year of our Lord to the year " and some of whom have quoted each and every one of our historical scriptures "I say this" adds Dr Lardner "because I think it has been proved  Ib vol xii p  "  These apocryphal writings were not read in the churches of Christians  Were not admitted into their volume  Do not appear in their catalogues  Were not noticed by their adversaries  Were not alledged by different parties as of authority in their controversies  Were not the subjects amongst them of commentaries versions collations expositions  Finally beside the silence of three centuries or evidence within that time of their rejection they were with a consent nearly universal reprobated by Christian writers of succeeding ages  Although it be made out by these observations that the books in question never obtained any degree of credit and notoriety which can place them in competition with our scriptures yet it appears from the writings of the fourth century that many such existed in that century and in the century preceding it It may be difficult at this distance of time to account for their origin Perhaps the most probable explication is  that they were in general composed with a design of making a profit by the sale Whatever treated of the subject would find purchasers It was an advantage taken of the pious curiosity of unlearned Christians With a view to the same purpose they were many of them adapted to the particular opinions of particular sects which would naturally promote their circulation amongst the favourers of those opinions After all they were probably much more obscure than we imagine Except the Gospel according to the Hebrews there is none of which we hear more than the Gospel of the Egyptians yet there is good reason to believe that Clement a presbyter of Alexandria in Egypt A D and a man of almost universal reading had never seen it  Jones vol i p  A Gospel according to Peter was another of the most ancient books of this kind yet Serapion bishop of Antioch A D had not read it when he heard of such a book being in the hands of the Christians of Rhossus in Cilicia and speaks of obtaining  a sight of this Gospel from some sectaries who used it  Lard Cred vol ii p  Even of the Gospel of the Hebrews which confessedly stands at the head of the catalogue Jerome at the end of the fourth century was glad to procure a copy by the favour of the Nazareans of Berea Nothing of this sort ever happened or could have happened concerning our Gospels  One thing is observable of all the apocryphal Christian writings viz that they proceed upon the same fundamental history of Christ and his apostles as that which is disclosed in our scriptures The mission of Christ his power of working miracles his communication of that power to the apostles his passion death and resurrection are assumed or asserted by every one of them The names under which some of them came forth are the names of men of eminence in our histories What these books give are not contradictions but unauthorised additions  The principal facts are supposed the principal agents the same which shews that these points were too much fixed to be altered or disputed  If there be any book of this description which appears to have imposed upon some considerable number of learned Christians it is the Sybilline oracles but when we reflect upon the circumstances which facilitated that imposture we shall cease to wonder either at the attempt or its success It was at that time universally understood that such a prophetic writing existed Its contents were kept secret This situation afforded to some one a hint as well as an opportunity to give out a writing under this name favourable to the already established persuasion of Christians and which writing by the aid and recommendation of these circumstances would in some degree it is probable be received Of the ancient forgery we know but little what is now produced could not in my opinion have imposed upon any one It is nothing else than the gospel  history woven into verse Perhaps was at first rather a fiction than a forgery an exercise of ingenuity more than an attempt to deceive  CHAP X  THE reader will now be pleased to recollect that the two points which form the subject of our present discussion are first that the founder of Christianity his associates and immediate followers passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings secondly that they did so in attestation of the miraculous history recorded in our scriptures and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of that history  The argument by which these two propositions have been maintained by us stands thus  No historical fact I apprehend is more certain than that the original propagators of Christianity voluntarily subjected themselves to lives of fatigue danger and suffering in the prosecution of their undertaking The  nature of the undertaking the character of the persons employed in it the opposition of their tenets to the fixed opinions and expectations of the country in which they first advanced them their undissembled condemnation of the religion of all other countries their total want of power authority or force render it in the highest degree probable that this must have been the case The probability is increased by what we know of the fate of the founder of the institution who was put to death for his attempt and by what we also know of the cruel treatment of the converts to the institution within thirty years after its commencement both which points are attested by heathen writers and being once admitted leave it very incredible that the primitive emissaries of the religion who exercised their ministry first amongst the people who had destroyed their master and afterwards amongst those who persecuted their converts should themselves escape with impunity or pursue their purpose in ease and safety This probability  thus sustained by foreign testimony is advanced I think to historical certainty by the evidence of our own books by the accounts of a writer who was the companion of the persons whose sufferings he relates by the letters of the persons themselves by predictions of persecutions ascribed to the founder of the religion which predictions would not have been inserted in his history much less have been studiously dwelt upon if they had not accorded with the event and which even if falsely ascribed to him could only have been so ascribed because the event suggested them lastly by incessant exhortations to fortitude and patience and by an earnestness repetition and urgency upon the subject which were unlikely to have appeared if there had not been at the time some extraordinary call for the exercise of these virtues  It is made out also I think with sufficient evidence that both the teachers and converts of the religion in consequence of  their new profession took up a new course of life and behaviour  The next great question is what they did this FOR That it was  for  a miraculous story of some kind or other is to my apprehension extremely manifest because as to the fundamental article the designation of the person viz that this particular person Jesus of Nazareth ought to be received as the Messiah or as a messenger from God they neither had nor could have any thing but miracles to stand upon That the exertions and sufferings of the apostles were  for  the story which we have now is proved by the consideration that this story is transmitted to us by two of their own number and by two others personally connected with them that the particularity of the narratives proves that the writers claimed to possess circumstantial information that from their situation they had full opportunity of acquiring such information that they certainly at least knew what their colleagues  their companions their masters taught that each of these books contains enough to prove the truth of the religion that if any one of them therefore be genuine it is sufficient that the genuineness however of all of them is made out as well by the general arguments which evince the genuineness of the most undisputed remains of antiquity as also by peculiar and specific proofs viz by citations from them in writings belonging to a period immediately contiguous to that in which they were published by the distinguished regard paid by early Christians to the authority of these books which regard was manifested by their collecting of them into a volume appropriating to that volume titles of peculiar respect translating them into various languages digesting them into harmonies writing commentaries upon them and still more conspicuously by the reading of them in their public assemblies in all parts of the world by an universal agreement with respect to  these  books whilst doubts were entertained concerning some  others by contending sects appealing to them by the early adversaries of the religion not disputing their genuineness but on the contrary treating them as the depositaries of the history upon which the religion was founded by many formal catalogues of these as of certain and authoritative writings published in different and distant parts of the Christian world lastly by the absence or defect of the abovecited topics of evidence when applied to any other histories of the same subject  These are strong arguments to prove that the books actually proceeded from the authors whose names they bear and have always borne for there is not a particle of evidence to shew that they ever went under any other but the strict genuineness of the books is perhaps more than is necessary to the support of our proposition For even supposing that by reason of the silence of antiquity or the loss of records we knew not who were the writers of the four Gospels  yet the fact that they were received as authentic accounts of the transaction upon which the religion rested and were received as such by Christians at or near the age of the apostles by those whom the apostles had taught and by societies which the apostles had founded this fact I say connected with the consideration that they are corroborative of each other's testimony and that they are further corroborated by another contemporary history taking up the story where they had left it and in a narrative built upon that story accounting for the rise and production of changes in the world the effects of which subsist at this day connected moreover with the confirmation which they receive from letters written by the apostles themselves which both assume the same general story and as often as occasions lead them to do so allude to particular parts of it and connected also with the reflection that if the apostles delivered any different story it is lost the present and no other being referred to by a  series of Christian writers down from their age to our own being likewise recognized in a variety of institutions which prevailed early and universally amongst the disciples of the religion and that so great a change as the oblivion of one story and the substitution of another under such circumstances could not have taken place this evidence would be deemed I apprehend sufficient to prove concerning these books that whoever were the authors of them they exhibit the story which the apostles told and for which consequently they acted and they suffered  If it be so the religion must be true These men could not be deceivers By only not bearing testimony they might have avoided all their sufferings and have lived quietly Would men in such circumstances pretend to have seen what they never saw assert facts which they had no knowledge of go about lying to teach virtue and though not only convinced of Christ's being  an impostor but having seen the success of his imposture in his crucifixion yet persist in carrying it on and so persist as to bring upon themselves for nothing and with a full knowledge of the consequence enmity and hatred danger and death  Of the Direct Historical Evidence of Christianity  PROP II  CHAP I  Our first proposition was  "That there is satisfactory evidence that many pretending to be original witnesses of the Christian miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undertaken and undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts and that they also submitted from the same motive to new rules of conduct"  Our second proposition and which now remains to be treated of is  "That there is  NOT  satisfactory evidence that persons pretending to be original witnesses of any other similar miracles have acted in the same manner in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and solely in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts"  I ENTER upon this part of my argument by declaring how far my belief in miraculous accounts goes If the reformers in the time of Wickliff or of Luther or those of England in the time of Henry the Eighth or of Queen Mary or the founders of our religious fects since such as were Mr Whitfield and Mr Wesley in our own times had undergone the life of toil and exertion of danger and sufferings which we know that many of them did undergo  for  a miraculous story that is to say if they had founded their public ministry upon the allegation of miracles wrought within their own knowledge and upon narratives  which could not be resolved into delusion or mistake and is it had appeared that their conduct really had its origin in these accounts I should have believed them Or to borrow an instance which will be familiar to every one of my readers if the late Mr Howard had undertaken his labours and journies in attestation and in consequence of a clear and sensible miracle I should have believed him also Or to represent the same thing under a third supposition if Socrates had professed to perform public miracles at Athens if the friends of Socrates Phaedo Cebes Crito and Simmias together with Plato and many of his followers relying upon the attestation which these miracles afforded to his pretensions had at the hazard of their lives and the certain expence of their ease and tranquillity gone about Greece after his death to publish and propagate his doctrines and if these things had come to our knowledge in the same way as that in which the life of Socrates is now transmitted to us through the hands of his companions  and disciples that is by writings received without doubt as theirs from the age in which they were published to the present I should have believed this likewise And my belief would in each case be much strengthened if the subject of the mission were of importance to the conduct and happiness of human life if it testified any thing which it behoved mankind to know from such authority if the nature of what it delivered required the sort of proof which it alledged if the occasion was adequate to the interposition the end worthy of the means In the last case my faith would be much confirmed if the effects of the transaction  remained  more especially if a change had been wrought at the time in the opinion and conduct of such numbers as to lay the foundation of an institution and of a system of doctrines which had since overspread the greatest part of the civilized world I should have believed I say the testimony in these cases yet none of them do more than come up to the apostolic history  If any one choose to call assent to this evidence credulity it is at least incumbent upon him to produce examples in which the same evidence hath turned out to be fallacious And this contains the precise question which we are now to agitate  In stating the comparison between our evidence and what our adversaries may bring into competition with ours we will divide the distinctions which we wish to propose into two kinds those which relate to the proof and those which relate to the miracles Under the former head we may lay out of the case  I Such accounts of supernatural events as are found only in histories by some ages posterior to the transaction and of which it is evident that the historian could know little more than his reader Ours is contemporary history This difference alone removes out of our way the miraculous history of Pythagoras who lived five hundred years before the Christian aera written by Porphyry and Jamblicus who lived  three hundred years after that aera the prodigies of Livy's history the fables of the heroic ages the whole of the Greek and Roman as well as of the Gothic mythology a great part of the legendary history of Popish saints the very best attested of which is extracted from the certificates that are exhibited during the process of their canonization a ceremony which seldom takes place till a century after their deaths It applies also with considerable force to the miracles of Apollonius Tyaneus which are contained in a solitary history of his life published by Philostratus above a hundred years after his death and in which whether Philostratus had any prior account to guide him depends upon his single unsupported assertion Also to some of the miracles of the third century especially to one extraordinary instance the account of Gregory bishop of Neocesarea called Thaumaturgus delivered in the writings of Gregory of Nyssen who lived one hundred and thirty years after the subject of his panegyric  The value of this circumstance is shewn to have been accurately exemplisied in the history of Ignatius Loyola the founder of the order of Jesuits  Douglass's Criterion of Miracles p  His life written by a companion of his and by one of the order was published about fifteen years after his death In which life the author so far from ascribing any miracles to Ignatius industriously states the reasons why he was not invested with any such power The life was republished fifteen years afterwards with the addition of many circumstances which were the fruit the author says of further enquiry and of diligent examination but still with a total silence about miracles When Ignatius had been dead near sixty years the Jesuits conceiving a wish to have the founder of their order placed in the Roman calendar began as it should seem for the first time to attribute to him a catalogue of miracles which could not then be distinctly disproved and which there was in those who governed the church a strong disposition to admit upon the slenderest proofs  II We may lay out of the case accounts published in one country of what passed in a distant country without any proof that such accounts were known or received at home In the case of Christianity Judea which was the scene of the transaction was the center of the mission The story was published in the place in which it was acted The church of Christ was first planted at Jerusalem itself With that church others corresponded From thence the primitive teachers of the institution went forth thither they assembled The church of Jerusalem and the several churches of Judea subsisted from the beginning and for many ages  The succession of many eminent bishops of Jerusalem in the three first centuries is distinctly preserved as Alexander A D who succeeded Narcissus then years old  received also the same books and the same accounts as other churches did  This distinction disposes amongst others of the abovementioned miracles of Apollonius Tyaneus most of which are related to have been performed in India no evidence remaining that either the miracles ascribed  to him or the history of those miracles were ever heard of in India Those of Francis Xavier the Indian missionary with many others of the Romish breviary are liable to the same objection viz that the accounts of them were published at a vast distance from the supposed scene of the wonders  Doug Crit p    III We lay out of the case  transient  rumours Upon the first publication of an extraordinary account or even of an article of ordinary intelligence no one who is not personally acquainted with the transaction can know whether it be true or false because any man may publish any story It is in the future confirmation or contradiction of the account in its permanency or its disappearance its dying away into silence or its increasing in notoriety its being followed up by subsequent accounts and being repeated in different and independent accounts that solid truth is distinguished from fugitive lies This distinction  is altogether on the side of Christianity The story did not drop On the contrary it was succeeded by a train of action and events dependent upon it The accounts which we have in our hands were composed after the first reports must have subsided They were followed by a train of writings upon the subject The historical testimonies of the transaction were many and various and connected with letters discourses controversies apologies successively produced by the same transaction  IV We may lay out of the case what I call  naked  history It has been said that if the prodigies of the Jewish history had been found only in fragments of Manetho or Berosus we should have paid no regard to them and I am willing to admit this If we knew nothing of the fact but from the fragment if we possessed no proof that these accounts had been credited and acted upon from times probably as ancient as the accounts themselves if we had no visible effects connected with the history no subsequent  or collateral testimony to confirm it under these circumstances I think that it would be undeserving of credit But this certainly is not our case In appreciating the evidence of Christianity the books are to be combined with the institution with the prevalency of the religion at this day with the time and place of its origin which are acknowledged points with the circumstances of its rise and progress as collected from external history with the fact of our present books being received by the votaries of the institution from the beginning with that of other books coming after these filled with accounts of effects and consequences resulting from the transaction or referring to the transaction or built upon it lastly with the consideration of the number and variety of the books themselves the different writers from which they proceed the different views with which they were written so disagreeing as to repel the suspicion of confederacy so agreeing as to shew that they were founded in a common original  i e  in a story substantially the same Whether  this proof be satisfactory or not it is properly a cumulation of evidence by no means a naked or solitary record  V A mark of historical truth although only in a certain way and to a certain degree is  particularity  in names dates places circumstances and in the order of events preceding or following the transaction of which kind for instance is the particularity in the description of St Paul's voyage and shipwreck in the th chapter of the Acts which no man I think can read without being convinced that the writer was there and also in the account of the cure and examination of the blind man in the ninth chapter of St John's Gospel which bears every mark of personal knowledge on the part of the historian  Both these chapters ought to be read for the sake of this very observation  I do not deny that fiction has often the particularity of truth but then it is of studied and elaborate fiction or of a formal attempt to deceive that we observe this Since however experience  proves that particularity is not consined to truth I have stated that it is a proof of truth only to a certain extent  i e  it reduces the question to this whether we can depend or not upon the  probity  of the relator which is a considerable advance in our present argument for an express attempt to deceive in which case alone particularity can appear without truth is charged upon the evangelists by few If the historian acknowledge himself to have received his intelligence from others the particularity of the narrative shews primâ facie the accuracy of his enquiries and the fulness of his information This remark belongs to St Luke's history Of the particularity which we alledge many examples may be found in all the Gospels And it is very difficult to conceive that such numerous particularities as are almost every where to be met with in the scriptures should be raised out of nothing or be spun out of the imagination without any fact to go upon  "There is always some truth where there are considerable particularities related and they always seem to bear some proportion to one another Thus there is a great want of the particulars of time place and persons in Manetho's account of the Egyptian Dynasties Etesias's of the Assyrian Kings and those which the technical chronologers have given of the ancient kingdoms of Greece and agreeably thereto these accounts have much fiction and falsehood with some truth whereas Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War and Cesar's of the War in Gaul in both which the particulars of time place and persons are mentioned are universally esteemed true to a great degree of exactness" Hartley vol ii p    It is to be remarked however that this particularity is only to be looked for in direct history It is not natural in references or allusions which yet in other respects often afford as far as they go the most unsuspicious evidence  VI We lay out of the case such stories of supernatural events as require on the part of the hearer nothing more than an  otiose  assent stories upon which nothing depends in which no interest is involved nothing is to be done or changed in consequence of believing them Such stories are  credited if the careless assent that is given to them deserve that name more by the indolence of the hearer than by his judgment or though not much credited are passed from one to another without enquiry or resistance To this case and to this case alone belongs what is called the love of the marvellous I have never known it carry men further Men do not suffer persecution from the love of the marvellous Of the indifferent nature we are speaking of are most vulgar errors and popular superstitions most for instance of the current reports of apparitions Nothing depends upon their being true or false But not surely of this kind were the alledged miracles of Christ and his apostles They decided if true the most important question upon which the human mind can six its anxiety They claimed to regulate the opinions of mankind upon subjects in which they are not only deeply concerned but usually refractory and obstinate Men could not be utterly careless in such a case as this If a Jew took up the story he found his darling partiality  to his own nation and law wounded if a Gentile he found his idolatry and polytheism reprobated and condemned Whoever entertained the account whether Jew or Gentile could not avoid the following reflection"If these things be true I must give up the opinions and principles in which I have been brought up the religion in which my fathers lived and died" It is not conceivable that a man should do this upon any idle report or frivolous account or indeed without being fully satisfied and convinced of the truth and credibility of the narrative to which he trusted But it did not stop at opinions They who believed Christianity acted upon it Many made it the express business of their lives to publish the intelligence It was required of those who admitted that intelligence to change forthwith their conduct and their principles to take up a different course of life to part with their habits and gratifications and begin a new set of rules and system of behaviour The apostles at least were interested not to sacrifice their ease their fortunes  and their lives for an idle tale multitudes beside them were induced by the same tale to encounter opposition danger and sufferings  If it be said that the mere promise of a future state would do all this I answer that the mere promise of a future state without any evidence to give credit or assurance to it would do nothing A few wandering fishermen talking of a resurrection of the dead could produce no effect If it be further said that men easily believe what they anxiously desire I again answer that in my opinion the very contrary of this is nearer to the truth Anxiety of desire earnestness of expectation the vastness of an event rather causes men to disbelieve to doubt to dread a fallacy to distrust and to examine When our Lord's resurrection was first reported to the apostles they did not believe we are told for joy This was natural and is agreeable to experience  VII We have laid out of the case those  accounts which require no more than a simple assent and we now also lay out of the case those which come merely  in affirmance  of opinions already formed This last circumstance is of the utmost importance to notice well It has long been observed that Popish miracles happen in Popish countries that they make no converts which proves that stories are accepted when they fall in with principles already fixed with the public sentiments or with the sentiments of a party already engaged on the side the miracle supports which would not be attempted to be produced in the face of enemies in opposition to reigning tenets or favourite prejudices or when if they be believed the belief must draw men away from their preconceived and habitual opinions from their modes of life and rules of action In the former case men may not only receive a miraculous account but may both act and suffer on the side and in the cause which the miracle supports yet not act or suffer  for  the miracle but in pursuance of a prior persuasion The miracle like any other  argument which only confirms what was before believed is admitted with little examination In the moral as in the natural world it is  change  which requires a cause Men are easily fortified in their old opinions driven from them with great difficulty Now how does this apply to the Christian history The miracles there recorded were wrought in the midst of enemies under a government a priesthood and a magistracy decidedly and vehemently adverse to them and to the pretensions which they supported They were Protestant miracles in a Popish country they were Popish miracles in the midst of Protestants They produced a change they established a society upon the spot adhering to the belief of them they made converts and those who were converted gave up to the testimony their most fixed opinions and most favourite prejudices They who acted and suffered in the cause acted and suffered  for  the miracles for there was no anterior persuasion to induce them no prior reverence prejudice or partiality to take hold of Jesus had not one follower when  he set up his claim His miracles gave birth to his sect No part of this description belongs to the ordinary evidence of Heathen or Popish miracles Even most of the miracles alledged to have been performed by Christians in the second and third century of its aera want this confirmation It constitutes indeed a line of partition between the  origin  and the  progress  of Christianity Frauds and fallacies might mix themselves with the progress which could not possibly take place in the commencement of the religion at least according to any laws of human conduct that we are acquainted with What should suggest to the first propagators of Christianity especially to fishermen taxgatherers and husbandmen such a thought as that of changing the religion of the world what could bear them through the difficulties in which the attempt engaged them what could procure any degree of success to the attempt are questions which apply with great force to the setting out of the institution with less to every future stage of it  To hear some men talk one would suppose the setting up of a religion by miracles to be a thing of every day's experience whereas the whole current of history is against it Hath any founder of a new sect amongst Christians pretended to miraculous powers and succeeded by his pretensions "Were these powers claimed or exercised by the founders of the sects of the Waldenses and Albigenses Did Wickliff in England pretend to it Did Huss or Jerome in Bohemia Did Luther in Germany Zuinglius in Switzerland Calvin in France or any of the reformers advance this plea  Campbell on Miracles p ed  " The French prophets in the beginning of the present century ventured to alledge miraculous evidence and immediately ruined their cause by their temerity "Concerning the religion of Ancient Rome of Turkey of Siam of China a single miracle cannot be named that was ever offered as a test of any of those religions  before  their establishment  Adams on Mir p  "  We may add to what has been observed of the distinction which we are considering that where miracles are alledged merely in affirmance of a prior opinion they who believe the doctrine may sometimes propagate a belief of the miracles which they do not themselves entertain This is the case of what are called  pious  frauds but it is a case I apprehend which takes place solely in support of a persuasion already established At least it does not hold of the apostolical history If the apostles did not believe the miracles they did not believe the religion and without this belief where was the  piety  what place was there for any thing which could bear the name or colour of piety in publishing and attesting miracles in its behalf If it be said that many promote the belief of revelation and of any accounts which favour that belief because they think them whether well or ill founded of public and political utility I answer that if a character exist which can with less justice than another be ascribed to the founders of the Christian religion it is that of politicians or  of men capable of entertaining political views The truth is that there is no assignable character which will account for the conduct of the apostles supposing their story to be false If bad men what could have induced them to take such pains to promote virtue If good men they would not have gone about the country with a string of lies in their mouths  IN APPRECIATING the credit of any miraculous story these are distinctions which relate to the evidence There are other distinctions of great moment in the question which relate to the miracles themselves Of which latter kind the following ought carefully to be retained  I It is not necessary to admit as a miracle what can be resolved into a  false perception  Of this nature was the demon of Socrates the visions of St Anthony and of many others the vision which Lord Herbert of Cherbury describes himself to have seen Colonel Gardiner's vision as related in his life written  by Dr Doddridge All these may be accounted for by a momentary insanity for the characteristic symptom of human madness is the rising up in the mind of images not distinguishable by the patient from impressions upon the senses  Batty on Lunacy  The cases however in which the possibility of this delusion exists are divided from the cases in which it does not exist by many and those not obscure marks They are for the most part cases of visions or voices The object is hardly ever touched The vision submits not to be handled One sense does not confirm another They are likewise almost always cases of a  solitary  witness It is in the highest degree improbable and I know not indeed whether it hath ever been the fact that the same derangement of the mental organs should seize different persons at the same time a derangement I mean so much the same as to represent to their imagination the same objects Lastly these are always cases of  momentary  miracles  by which term I mean to denote miracles of which the whole existence is of short duration in contradistinction to miracles which are attended with permanent effects The appearance of a spectre the hearing of a supernatural sound is a momentary miracle The sensible proof is gone when the apparition or sound is over But if a person born blind be restored to sight a notorious cripple to the use of his limbs or a dead man to life here is a permanent effect produced by supernatural means The change indeed was instantaneous but the proof continues The subject of the miracle remains The man cured or restored is there his former condition was known and his present condition may be examined This can by no possibility be resolved into false perception and of this kind are by far the greater part of the miracles recorded in the New Testament When Lazarus was raised from the dead he did not merely move and speak and die again or come out of the grave and vanish away He returned to his home and his family and there continued  for we find him some time afterwards in the same town sitting at table with Jesus and his sisters visited by great multitudes of the Jews as a subject of curiosity giving by his presence so much uneasiness to the Jewish rulers as to beget in them a design of destroying him  John xii  No delusion can account for this The French prophets in England some time since gave out that one of their teachers would come to life again but their enthusiasm never made them believe that they actually saw him alive The blind man whose restoration to sight at Jerusalem is recorded in the ninth chapter of St John's gospel did not quit the place or conceal himself from enquiry On the contrary he was forthcoming to answer the call to satisfy the scrutiny and to sustain the browbeating of Christ's angry and powerful enemies When the cripple at the gate of the temple was suddenly cured by Peter  Acts iii  he did not immediately relapse into his former lameness or disappear out of the  city but boldly and honestly produced himself along with the apostles when they were brought the next day before the Jewish council  Acts iv  Here though the miracle was sudden the proof was permanent The lameness had been notorious the cure continued This therefore could not be the effect of any momentary delirium either in the subject or in the witnesses of the transaction It is the same with the greatest number of the scripture miracles There are other cases of a  mixed  nature in which although the principal miracle be momentary some circumstance combined with it is permanent Of this kind is the history of St Paul's conversion  Ib ix  The sudden light and sound the vision and the voice upon the road to Damascus were momentary but Paul's blindness for three days in consequence of what had happened the communication made to Ananias in another place and by a vision independent of the former Ananias finding out Paul in consequence  of intelligence so received and finding him in the condition described and Paul's recovery of his sight upon Ananias laying his hands upon him are circumstances which take the transaction and the principal miracle as included in it entirely out of the case of momentary miracles or of such as may be accounted for by false perceptions Exactly the same thing may be observed of Peter's vision preparatory to the call of Cornelius and of its connection with what was imparted in a distant place to Cornelius himself and with the message dispatched by Cornelius to Peter The vision might be a dream the message could not Either communication taken separately might be a delusion the concurrence of the two was impossible to happen without a supernatural cause  Beside the risk of delusion which attaches upon momentary miracles there is also much more room for  imposture  The account cannot be examined at the moment And when that is also a moment of hurry and  confusion it may not be difficult for men of influence to gain credit to any story which they may wish to have believed This is precisely the case of one of the best attested of the miracles of old Rome the appearance of Castor and Pollux in the battle fought by Posthumius with the Latins at the lake Regillus There is no doubt but that Posthumius after the battle spread the report of such an appearance No person could deny it whilst it was said to last No person perhaps had any inclination to dispute it afterwards or if they had could say with positiveness what was or what was not seen by some or other of the army in the dismay and amidst the tumult of a battle  In assigning false perceptions as the origin to which some miraculous accounts may be referred I have not mentioned claims to inspiration illuminations secret notices or directions internal sensations or consciousnesses of being acted upon by spiritual influences good or bad because these appealing to no external proof however convincing  they may be to the persons themselves form no part of what can be accounted miraculous evidence Their own credibility stands upon their alliance with other miracles The discussion therefore of all such pretensions may be omitted  II It is not necessary to bring into the comparison what may be called  tentative  miracles that is where out of a great number of trials some succeed and in the accounts of which although the narrative of the successful cases be alone preserved and that of the unsuccessful cases sunk yet enough is stated to shew that the cases produced are only a few out of many in which the same means have been employed This observation bears with considerable force upon the ancient oracles and auguries in which a single coincidence of the event with the prediction is talked of and magnified whilst failures are forgotten or suppressed or accounted for It is also applicable to the cures wrought by relies and at the tombs of faints The boasted essicacy of the king's  touch upon which Mr Hume lays some stress falls under the same description Nothing is alledged concerning it which is not alledged of various nostrums namely out of many thousands who have used them certified proofs of a few who have recovered after them No solution of this sort is applicable to the miracles of the gospel There is nothing in the narrative which can induce or even allow us to believe that Christ attempted cures in many instances and succeeded in a few or that he ever made the attempt in vain He did not profess to heal every where all that were sick on the contrary he told the Jews evidently meaning to represent his own case that "although many widows were in Israel in the days of Elias when the heaven was shut up three years and six months when great famine was throughout all the land yet unto none of them was Elias sent save unto Sarepta a city of Sidon unto a woman that was a widow" and that "many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet and none of them was cleansed saving Naaman  the Syrian  Luke iv  " By which examples he gave them to understand that it was not the nature of a divine interposition or necessary to its purpose to be general still less to answer every challenge that might be made which would teach men to put their faith upon these experiments Christ never pronounced the word but the effect followed  One and only one instance may be produced in which the  disciples  of Christ do seem to have attempted a cure and not to have been able to perform it The story is very ingenuously related by three of the evangelists  Mark ix  Mat xvi  The patient was afterwards healed by Christ himself and the whole transaction seems to have been intended as it was well suited to display the superiority of Christ above all who performed miracles in his name a distinction which during his presence in the world it might be necessary to inculcate by some such proof as this  It was not a thousand sick that received his benediction and a few that were benefited a single paralytic is let down in his bed at Jesus' feet in the midst of a surrounding multitude Jesus bid him walk and he did  so  Mark ii  A man with a withered hand is in the synagogue Jesus bid him stretch forth his hand in the presence of the assembly and it was "restored whole like the other  Mat xii  " There was nothing tentative in these cures nothing that can be explained by the power of accident  We may observe also that many of the cures which Christ wrought such as that of a person blind from his birth also many miracles beside cures as raising the dead walking upon the sea feeding a great multitude with a few loaves and fishes are of a nature which does not in any wife admit of the supposition of a fortunate experiment  III We may dismiss from the question all accounts in which allowing the phenomenon to be real the fact to be true it still remains  doubtful  whether a miracle were wrought This is the case with the ancient history of what is called the thundering  legion of the extraordinary circumstances which obstructed the rebuilding of the temple at Jerusalem by Julian the circling of the flames and fragrant smell at the martyrdom of Polycarp the sudden shower that extinguished the fire into which the scriptures were thrown in the Diocletian persecution Constantine's dream his inscribing in consequence of it the cross upon his standard and the shields of his soldiers his victory and the escape of the standard bearer perhaps also the imagined appearance of the cross in the heavens though this last circumstance is very deficient in historical evidence It is also the case with the modern annual exhibition of the liquefaction of the blood of St Januarius at Naples It is a doubt likewise which ought to be excluded by very special circumstances from these narratives which relate to the supernatural cure of hypochondriacal and nervous complaints and of all diseases which are much affected by the imagination The miracles of the second and third century are usually healing the sick and casting out evil spirits  miracles in which there is room for some error and deception We hear nothing of causing the blind to see the lame to walk the deaf to hear the lepers to be cleansed  Jortin's Remarks vol ii p  There are also instances in Christianwriters of reputed miracles which were natural operations though not known to be such at the time as that of articulate speech after the loss of a great part of the tongue  IV To the same head of objection nearly may also be referred accounts in which the variation of a small circumstance may have transformed some extraordinary appearance or some critical coincidence of events into a miracle stories in a word which may be resolved into exaggeration The miracles of the gospel can by no possibility be explained away in this manner Total fiction will account for any thing but no stretch of exaggeration that has any parallel in other histories no force of fancy upon real circumstances could produce the narratives which we now have The feeding of the  five thousand with a few loaves and fishes surpasses all bounds of exaggeration The raising of Lazarus of the widow's son at Nain as well as many of the cures which Christ wrought come not within the compass of misrepresentation I mean that it is impossible to assign any position of circumstances however peculiar any accidental effects however extraordinary any natural singularity which could supply an origin or foundation to these accounts  Having thus enumerated several exceptions which may justly be taken to relations of miracles it is necessary when we read the scriptures to bear in our minds this general remark that although there be miracles recorded in the New Testament which fall within some or other of the exceptions here assigned yet that they are united with others to which none of the same exceptions extend and that their credibility stands upon this union Thus the visions and revelations which St Paul asserts to have been imparted to him may not in their separate evidence be distinguishable from the visions  and revelations which many others have alledged But here is the difference St Paul's pretensions were attested by external miracles wrought by himself and by miracles wrought in the cause to which these visions relate or to speak more properly the same historical authority which informs us of one informs us of the other This is not ordinarily true of the visions of enthusiasts or even of the accounts in which they are contained Again some of Christ's own miracles were  momentary  as the transfiguration the appearance and voice from Heaven at his baptism a voice from the clouds upon one occasion afterwards John xii and some others It is not denied that the distinction which we have proposed concerning miracles of this species applies in diminution of the force of the evidence as much to these instances as to others But this is the case not with all the miracles ascribed to Christ nor with the greatest part nor with many Whatever force therefore there may be in the objection we have numerous miracles which are free  from it and even these to which it is applicable are little affected by it in their credit because there are few who admitting the rest will reject  them  If there be miracles of the New Testament which come within any of the  other  heads into which we have distributed the objections the same remark must be repeated And this is one way in which the unexampled number and variety of the miracles ascribed to Christ strengthens the credibility of Christianity For it precludes any solution or conjecture about a solution which imagination or even which experience might suggest concerning some particular miracles if considered independently of others The miracles of Christ were of various kinds  Not only healing every species of disease but turning water into wine John ii feeding multitudes with a few loaves and fishes Mat xiv Mark vi Luke ix John iv walking on the sea Mat xiv calming a storm Mat viii Luke viii a celestial voice at his baptism and miraculous appearance Mat iii afterwards John xii his transfiguration Mat xvii Mark ix Luke ix Ep Peter i raising the dead in three distinct instances Mat ix Mark v Luke viii Luke vii John xi  and performed in great varieties of situation form and manner at Jerusalem the metropolis of the Jewish nation and religion in different parts of  Judea and Galilee in cities in villages in synagogues in private houses in the street in highways with preparation as in the case of Lazarus by accident as in the case of the widow's son at Nain when attended by multitudes and when alone with the patient in the midst of his disciples and in the presence of his enemies with the common people around him and before Scribes and Pharisees and rulers of the synagogues  I apprehend that when we remove from the comparison the cases which are fairly disposed of by the observations that have been stated many cases will not remain To those which do remain we apply this final distinction "that there is not satisfactory evidence that persons pretending to  be original witnesses of the miracles passed their lives in labours dangers and sufferings voluntarily undertaken and undergone in attestation of the accounts which they delivered and properly in consequence of their belief of the truth of those accounts"  CHAP II  BUT they with whom we argue have undoubtedly a right to elect their own examples The instances with which Mr Hume hath chosen to confront the miracles of the New Testament and which therefore we are intitled to regard as the strongest which the history of the world could supply to the enquiries of a very acute and learned adversary are the three following  The cure of a blind and of a lame man at Alexandria by the Emperor Vespasian as related by Tacitus  The restoration of the limb of an attendant in a Spanish church as told by Cardinal de Retz and  The cures said to be performed at the  tomb of the Abbé Paris in the early part of the present century  The narrative of Tacitus is delivered in these terms "One of the common people of Alexandria known to be diseased in his eyes by the admonition of the god Serapis whom that superstitious nation worship above all other gods prostrated himself before the emperor earnestly imploring from him a remedy for his blindness and entreating that he would deign to anoint with his spittle his cheeks and the balls of his eyes Another diseased in his hand requested by the admonition of the same god that he might be touched by the foot of the emperor Vespasian at first derided and despised their application afterwards when they continued to urge their petitions he sometimes appeared to dread the imputation of vanity at other times by the earnest supplication of the patients and the persuasion of his flatterers to be induced to hope for success At length he commanded an enquiry to be made by physicians whether  such a blindness and debility were vincible by human aid The report of the physicians contained various points that in the one the power of vision was not destroyed but would return if the obstacles were removed that in the other the diseased joints might be restored if a healing power were applied that it was perhaps agreeable to the gods to do this that the emperor was elected by divine assistance lastly that the credit of the success would be the emperor's the ridicule of the disappointment would fall upon the patients Vespasian believing that every thing was in the power of his fortune and that nothing was any longer incredible whilst the multitude which stood by eagerly expected the event with a countenance expressive of joy executed what he was desired to do Immediately the hand was restored to its use and light returned to the blind man They who were present relate both these cures even at this time when there is nothing to be gained by lying  Tac Hist lib iv  "  Now though Tacitus wrote this account twentyseven years after the miracle is said to have been performed and wrote at Rome of what passed at Alexandria and wrote also from report and although it does not appear that he had examined the story or that he believed it but rather the contrary yet I think his testimony sufficient to prove that such a transaction took place by which I mean that the two men in question did apply to Vespasian that Vespasian did touch the diseased in the manner related and that a cure was reported to have followed the operation But the affair labours under a strong and just suspicion that the whole of it was a concerted imposture brought about by collusion between the patients the physician and the emperor This solution is probable because there was every thing to suggest and every thing to facilitate such a scheme The miracle was calculated to confer honour upon the emperor and upon the god Serapis It was achieved in the midst of the emperor's flatterers and followers in a city and amongst  a populace beforehand devoted to his interest and to the worship of the god where it would have been treason and blasphemy together to have contradicted the fame of the cure or even to have questioned it And what is very observable in the account is that the report of the physicians is just such a report as would have been made of a case in which no external marks of the disease existed and which consequently was capable of being easily counterfeited viz that in the first of the patients the organs of vision were not destroyed that the weakness of the second was in his joints The strongest circumstance in Tacitus's narration is that the first patient was  "notus  tabe oculorum" remarked or notorious for the disease in his eyes But this was a circumstance which might have found its way into the story in its progress from a distant country and during an interval of thirty years or it might be true that the malady of the eyes was notorious yet that the nature and degree of the disease had never been ascertained a case by no means uncommon  The emperor's reserve was easily affected or it is possible he might not be in the secret There does not seem to be much weight in the observation of Tacitus that they who were present continued even then to relate the story when there was nothing to be gained by the lie It only proves that those who had told the story for many years persisted in it The state of mind of the witnesses and spectators  at the time  is the point to be attended to Still less is there of pertinency in Mr Hume's eulogium upon the cautious and penetrating genius of the historian for it does not appear that the historian believed it The terms in which he speaks of Serapis the deity to whose interposition the miracle was attributed scarcely suffer us to suppose that Tacitus thought the miracle to be real "by the admonition of the god Serapis whom that superstitious nation dedita superstitionibus gens worship above all other gods" To have brought this supposed miracle within the limits of comparison with the miracles of Christ it ought to have appeared that a person of a  low and private station in the midst of enemies with the whole power of the country opposing him with every one around him prejudiced or interested against his claims and character pretended to perform these cures and required the spectators upon the strength of what they saw to give up their firmest hopes and opinions and follow  him  through a life of trial and danger that many were so moved as to obey his call at the expence both of every notion in which they had been brought up and of their ease safety and reputation and that by these beginnings a change was produced in the world the effects of which remain to this day a case both in its circumstances and consequences very unlike any thing we sind in Tacitus's relation  The story taken from the memoirs of Cardinal de Retz which is the second example alledged by Mr Hume is this "In the church of Saragossa in Spain the canons shewed me a man whose business it was to  light the lamps telling me that he had been several years at the gate with one leg only I saw him with two  Liv iv A D  "  It is stated by Mr Hume that the Cardinal who relates this story did not believe it and it no where appears that he either examined the limb or asked the patient or indeed any one a single question about the matter An artificial leg wrought with art would be sufficient in a place where no such contrivance had ever before been heard of to give origin and currency to the report The ecclesiastics of the place would it is probable favour the story inasmuch as it advanced the honour of their image and church And if  they  patronized it no other person at Saragossa in the middle of the last century would care to dispute it The story likewise coincided not less with the wishes and preconceptions of the people than with the interests of their ecclesiastical rulers so that there was prejudice backed  by authority and both operating upon extreme ignorance to account for the success of the imposture If as I have suggested the contrivance of an artificial limb was then new it would not occur to the Cardinal himself to suspect it especially under the carelessness of mind with which he heard the tale and the little inclination he felt to scrutinize or expose its fallacy  The miracles related to have been wrought at the tomb of the Abbé Paris admit in general of this solution The patients who frequented the tomb were so affected by their devotion their expectation the place the solemnity and above all by the sympathy of the surrounding multitude that many of them were thrown into violent convulsions which convulsions in certain instances produced a removal of disorders depending upon obstruction We shall at this day have the less difficulty in admitting the above account because it is the very same thing as hath lately been experienced in the operations of animal magnetism and  the report of the French physicians upon that mysterious remedy is very applicable to the present consideration viz that the pretenders to the art by working upon the imaginations of their patients were frequently able to produce convulsions that convulsions so produced are amongst the most powerful but at the same time most uncertain and unmanageable applications to the human frame which can be employed  Circumstances which indicate this explication in the case of the Parisian miracles are the following  They were  tentative  Out of many thousand sick infirm and diseased persons who resorted to the tomb the professed history of the miracles contains only nine cures  The convulsions at the tomb are admitted  The diseases were for the most part  of that sort which depends upon inaction and obstruction as dropsies palsies and some tumours  The cures were gradual some patients attending many days some several weeks and some several months  The cures were many of them incomplete  Others were temporary  The reader will find these particulars verified in the detail by the accurate enquiries of the present bishop of Sarum in his Criterion of Miracles p et seq    So that all the wonder we are called upon to account for is that out of an almost innumerable multitude which resorted to the tomb for the cure of their complaints and many of whom were there agitated by strong convulsions a very small proportion experienced a beneficial change in their constitution espccially in the action of the nerves and glands  Some of the cases alledged do not require that we should have recourse to this solution The first case in the catalogue is scarcely distinguishable from the progress of a natural recovery It was that of a young man who laboured under an inflammation of one eye and had lost the sight of the other The inflamed eye was relieved but the blindness of the other remained The inflammation had before been abated by medicine and the young man at the time of his attendance at the tomb was using a lotion of laudanum And what is a still more material part of the case the inflammation after some interval returned Another case was that of a young man who had lost his sight by the puncture of an awl and the discharge of the aqueous humour through the wound The sight which had been gradually returning was much improved during his visit to the tomb that is probably in the same degree in which the discharged humour was replaced by fresh secretions And it is observable that these two are the only cases which from their nature should seem unlikely to be affected by convulsions  In one material respect I allow that the Parisian miracles were different from those related by Tacitus and from the Spanish miracle of the Cardinal de Retz They had not like them all the power and all the prejudice of the country on their side to begin with They were alledged by one party against another by the Jansenists against the Jesuits These were of course opposed and examined by their adversaries The consequence of which examination was that many falsehoods were detected that with something really extraordinary much fraud appeared to be mixed And if some of the cases upon which designed misrepresentation could not be charged were not at the time satisfactorily accounted for it was because the essicacy of strong spasmodic affections was not then sufficiently known Finally the cause of Jansenism did not rise by the miracles but sunk although the miracles had the anterior persuasion of all the numerous adherents of that cause to set out with  These let us remember are the strongest examples which the history of ages supplies In none of them was the miracle  unequivocal  by none of them were established prejudices and persuasions overthrown of none of them did the credit make its way in opposition to authority and power by none of them were many induced to commit themselves and that in contradiction to prior opinions to a life of mortification danger and sufferings none were called upon to attest them at the expence of their fortunes and safety  It may be thought that the historian of the Parisian miracles M Montgeron forms an exception to this last assertion He presented his book with a suspicion as it should seem of the danger of what he was doing to the king and was shortly afterwards committed to prison from which he never came out Had the miracles been unequivocal and had M Montgeron been originally convinced by them I should have allowed this exception It would have stood I think alone in the argument of our adversaries But beside what has been observed of the dubious nature of the miracles the account which M Montgeron has himself left of his conversion shews both the state of his mind and  that his persuasien was not built upon external miracles  "Scarcely had he entered the churchyard when he was struck" he tells us "with awe and reverence having never besore heard prayers pronounced with so much ardour and transport as he observed amongst the supplicants at the tomb Upon this throwing himself on his knees resting his elbows on the tombstone and covering his face with his hands he spake the following prayer  O thou by whose intercession so many miracles are said to be performed if it be true that a part of thee surviveth the grave and that thou hast influence with the Almighty have pity on the darkness of my understanding and through his mercy obtain the removal of it  Having prayed thus many thoughts as he sayeth began to open themselves to his mind and so profound was his attention that he continued on his knees four hours not in the least disturbed by the vast crowd of surrounding supplicants During this time all the arguments which he ever heard or read in favour of Christianity occurred to him with so much force and seemed so strong and convincing that he went home fully satisfied of the truth of religion in general and of the holiness and power of that person who" as he supposed "had engaged the divine goodness to enlighten his understanding so suddenly" Douglass Crit of Mir p    END OF THE FIRST VOLUME
