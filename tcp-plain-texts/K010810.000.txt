 A HERMIT'S TALE RECORDED BY HIS OWN HAND AND FOUND IN HIS CELL  There oft is found an Avarice in Grief  And the wan Eye of Sorrow loves to gaze  Upon the secret Hoard of treasur'd Woes  MASON  LONDON  PRINTED FOR T CADELL IN THE STRAND MDCCLXXXVII  RICHARD BRINSLEY SHERIDAN Esq  SIR  EQUALLY induced by a just admiration of your talents and a grateful sense of the distinction your praise has given to those you were pleased to find in me permit me to solicit your further indulgence to this little production and be assured its greatest value in my eyes is that it serves to convey those acknowledgments with which I have the honour to remain  SIR  Your most obliged Obedient humble servant SOPHIA LEE  A  HERMIT's TALE  I  FROM prime of youth to hoary age  In this lone cell I've dwelt  Here sought by tracing Nature's page  To soothe the pangs I felt  II  The mosswove oaks that near my cave  In sullen grandeur stand  And o'er its broken summit wave  Were acorns in my hand  III  Those timeshook tow'rs which all forsake  Erect and gay I've seen  And half of yon translucent lake  A flow'renamell'd green  IV  When shall my penitence and pray'rs  Obtain the boon I crave  When shall my thorny bed of cares  Become my peaceful grave  V  Oh worshipp'd reliques holy book  Detain my mental eye  Nor let it ever backward look  To trace sad memory  VI  Or thou memorial cross of God  My whole attention seize  And bow my heart upon the sod  Worn daily by my knees  VII  Alas not Piety can heal  The soul convuls'd with guilt  Nor all her fountains cleanse the steel  Which human blood has spilt  VIII  Ah let me ease it then and speak  The long long treasur'd tale  What bitter griefs first bade me seek  The silence of this vale  IX  Near Cheviot Hills I drew the air  On Aran's pleasant plain  My mother was of presence fair  Her sire an aged swain  X  To tend the flocks was my employ  Nor ever heav'd my breast  When my fond mother blest her boy  At rising and at rest  XI  Yet oft with tears and smiles she strove  And as I bent my knee  She'd cry "be juster to thy love  Than mine has been to me"  XII  Yet little note of this I took  Unskill'd in worldly harms  And more admir'd my flow'rbound crook  Than her unequall'd charms  XIII  The lowly cot and shepherd's life  Each night each morn she prais'd  And when they spoke of warlike strife  With terror on me gaz'd  XIV  For now the wars of Palestine  Brave Coeur de Lion fought  While all admir'd the zeal divine  And with his deeds were fraught  XV  The glorious talk to me was good  And as it fill'd my ear  I seem'd to cleave the founding flood  Or grasp a fancied spear  XVI  When lo the neighbouring Scots a band  Rough as their native rocks  Rush'd like a whirlwind o'er the land  And swept away our flocks  XVII  By many an art my mother try'd  My vengeance to restrain  But anger argument defy'd  And ev'n her tears were vain  XVIII  Each swain I bade renounce his crook  Each swain obey'd my voice  The ravagers we soon o'ertook  And left them not a choice  XIX  No parle did either party use  Impell'd by fierce disdain  One sought as men who'd all to lose  The other to regain  XX  Day faintly purpled o'er the sky  When the fell fight began  But ere our stubborn foes would fly  The Sun his course had ran  XXI  Thus we retriev'd our fleecy store  So late bewail'd as lost  And seem'd I ween to love them more  For all the blows they cost  XXII  Not Richard's self his warriors led  More proudly o'er the deep  Than I for Aran's pastures sped  Surrounded by my sheep  XXIII  As nigh I drew the clouds did roll  A crimson o'er the night  The valley flam'dand my full soul  Died in me at the fight  XXIV  Another band of those who roam  Our hamlet had destroy'd  And while we fought to guard our home  Had made that home a void  XXV  A while I wept and duteous sought  My parents dear remains  At length my heart with vengeance fraught  An useless grief disdains  XXVI  I rouz'd the swains who yet deplor'd  Each desolated field  I turn'd my sheephook to a sword  My scrip into a shield  XXVII  The savage Scots I swore t'annoy  With everloud alarms  And from a simple shepherdboy  Became renown'd in arms  XXVIII  Between both lands strong tow'rs I rear  With captive ensigns bright  One nation gaz'd on them with fear  The other with delight  XXIX  Around I station'd many a band  Who dubious stragglers sought  And ah one day by love's command  A matchless beauty brought  XXX  Her mien majestic seem'd to speak  Th' unsullied soul within  No rose like that on her pure cheek  Blooms o'er the face of sin  XXXI  Oh not in grace the mountain pine  With her slight form could vye  The blue that paints the arch divine  Was faint to her bright eye  XXXII  Like a rich group of yellow sheaves  In ringlets wild her hair  Play'd on her breastso Autumn leaves  Hang on the lily fair  XXXIII  Awestruck my soul imbib'd a flame  As virtuous as sincere  Nor dared I boldly ask the name  I most desir'd to hear  XXXIV  Unconscious of her beauty's blaze  She drew away the shade  With dignity endur'd my gaze  And thus to speak essay'd  XXXV  "Although by force I hither bend  "The captive of thy sword  "From brutal hands I seek a friend  "Nor need I own a Lord  XXXVI  "Of English blood thy servant came  "Not from a hostile line  "Lord Ethel is my Father's name  "And Ethelinda mine  XXXVII  "To Scotland with my Mother sent  "A Grandsire's eyes to close  "Her sum of days like his are spent  "With him she finds repose  XXXVIII  "Ev'n now on silver Severn's side  "My Father anxiously  "Forgets the day my Mother dy'd  "To look in vain for me  XXXIX  "By Knighthood's holy laws oh Youth  "I therefore claim your gage  "That you yield him with care and truth  "The darling of his age  XL  "So may the peace to him you give  "With large increase return  "So crown'd with conquest may you live  "And glory crown your urn"  XLI  "Be safe" I cried "thou lovely Maid  "By warlike Richard's throne  "Ne'er shall she vainly ask my aid  "Whom truth and honor own  XLII  "By Knighthood's holy laws I swear  "And give th' unquestion'd gage  "To yield thy Sire with truth and care  "The darling of his age  XLIII  "To horse to horse each vassal knight  "Prepare your burnish'd arms  "Diffuse around a dazzling light  "To hide and guard these charms  XLIV  "A Nymph beyond ev'n Helen fair  "Bestows a nobler trust  "A Youth her beauty well might snare  "Is Man in loveyet just"  XLV  And soon my warriors o'er the waste  In gay profusion roll  The Lady in the centre plac'd  Irradiated the whole  XLVI  Still as we journied on I sought  With love's unconscious art  T' impress myself on ev'ry thought  'Till I had won her heart  XLVII  And now my fears would often hint  Her Sire might prove unkind  And wiser 'twere our trust to stint  But duteous was her mind  XLVIII  "Ah doubt not Edmund"she would say  "Thy worth must all engage  "Nor dare I scorn a father's sway  "Nor dare I grieve his age  XLIX  "His silver'd head as lilies bow  "Declining now appears  "Alike his frame doth tremble now  "With tenderness and years  L  "And sure a fearful joy she knows  "Who unpermitted loves  "While doubly hallow'd are the vows  "A parent's voice approves"  LI  "More fondly draws the heart's dear chain  "When watching his decay  "Oh the sad charm to know his pain  "In blessings melts away"  LII  Fill'd with her love sooth'd with her hope  The present hour I blest  And gave luxuriant fancy scope  Who more enrich'd the rest  LIII  When now we reach'd fair Severn's side  Where 'mid her fairest bow'rs  A mountain swell'd with verdant pride  Crown'd with Lord Ethel's tow'rs  LIV  As to the height we gaily wound  From apprehension free  Surpriz'd we heard the drum's fierce sound  Proclaim an enemy  LV  Like shining swarms of bees in arms  The Knights now multiply  And pleasure's notes and war's alarms  Our mingling trumpets cry  LVI  When proud I did the Lady shew  Who bade all discord cease  More radiant than the vernal bow  Heav'ns own bright pledge of peace  LVII  Her name in various accents cried  Was borne away within  While the vast portals opening wide  Increas'd the joyful din  LVIII  Forth rush'd tumultuous as the wind  Knights who no longer frown'd  But marching with their spears declin'd  A mute obedience own'd  LIX  At once dividing to each side  Like waves the train retire  And as the swan floats with the tide  Slow came the rev'rend Sire  LX  The gift of health an aged bloom  His manly cheek confest  And white his locks as erst the plume  That quiver'd o'er his crest  LXI  The Maid oppress'd with tender pain  And than the hart more fleet  Now graceful shot along the plain  And panted at his feet  LXII  Have you not seen the fragile rose  Droop with the gems of morn  So fair the kneeling Virgin shews  A Parent's tears adorn  LXIII  Have you not seen the purple vine  With Autumn hoar embost  Youth with such loveliness divine  Glows wrapt in age's frost  LXIV  "Oh most belov'd" her father cried  And fast his tears would fall  "My youth's delight my age's pride  "My little earthly all  LXV  "Thy safe return in peace and health  "Doth all my griefs assuage  "Thy safe return doth spare my wealth  "And ah doth spare my age"  LXVI  He said and turning to a Knight  Upon whose brow serene  Sat grace attemper'd with delight  While valor mark'd his mien  LXVII  "See Baron" added he "thy Bride  "My child behold the Son  "Allotted for thy Lord and guide  "When thy fond father's gone  LXVIII  "Ah venerate that hallow'd shield  "Upon whose orb the cross  "Declares in many a wellfought field  "The Saracens vast loss  LXIX  "With grateful love accept the hand  "But for whose aid forlorn  "And fatherless thou now mightst stand  "Nor I hail thy return"  LXX  My  soul as with an ague shook  At once both froze and burn'd  When she not deigning  him  a look  All tearful to me turn'd  LXXI  "Behold" she faltering said "the sword  "Which set thy daughter free  "Approve a heart where I'm ador'd  "Where I alone would be  LXXII  "Could I from duty have been won  "His honor to reward  "I should have call'd this Knight thy son  "And claim'd a like regard  LXXIII  "Oh think tho' fortune freed his will  "With reverence he woo'd  "Oh rise above the thought of ill  "Remember gratitude  LXXIV  "That claim I never will disown  "Your pow'r may bid me weep  "But tears like falling drops on stone  "The heart'swound wear more deep"  LXXV  The Baron's eyes blaz'd thro' the snow  Of age with Hecla's fire  And red his haughty blushes glow  While thus he speaks his ire  LXXVI  "And who then art thou nameless Youth  From whence deriv'd that flood  "Which dyes thy cheek with nature's truth  "And vies with Ethel's blood  LXXVII  "Where are the honors of thy line  "Unblazon'd on thy arms  "Which thou presum'st to blend with mine  "Vain of ignoble charms  LXXVIII  "Knowst thou the spoils of many a Knight  "Descend to me alone  "Knowst thou the lands within thy sight  "This Maid will one day own  LXXIX  "Learn Youth to ask some fit reward  "Which with thy rank agrees  "And fame and wealth and high regard  "Thy anger shall appease"  LXXX  "Hold Lord" I cried "nor meanly boast  "Degraded ancestry  "Thy honors in thyself are lost  "While mine begin in me  LXXXI  "But let us prove this vaunted blood  "This elevated line  "And see if Edmund's humble flood  "Nerve not his arm like thine  LXXXII  "For while firm youth shall brace his hand  "And love his ardent heart  "The matchless Maid he will demand  "Who forms its dearest part  LXXXIII  "Come then ye knights your welltried arms  "In deadly wrath produce  "While ours unwrought for such alarms  "Gain strength alone from use"  LXXXIV  Alost I wav'd my sword of pow'r  The spiral lustre run  And like the Guard of Eden's bow'r  Flam'd to the noonday sun  LXXXV  While thus we met with equal ire  Before my sorrowing eyes  The proud inexorable Sire  Bore off the beauteous prize  LXXXVI  Oh if ye ever knew to melt  In passion's tender glow  I need not paint the pangs I felt  At this extreme of woe  LXXXVII  Oh if ye ever yet have rag'd  Oppress'd by savage pow'r  Ye well will guess the war we wag'd  The fierceness of that hour  LXXXVIII  The sun unheeded veil'd his head  While many a casque was riv'n  And that last darkness seem'd to spread  Which mingles earth with heav'n  LXXXIX  Yet still in mortal conflict join'd  No respite we allow  'Till oft by heaven's wild fires we find  A friend slain for a foe  XC  Humanity at length o'er pride  Prevail'd and sooth'd this heat  We deem'd 'till daylight should decide  'Twere valour to retreat  XCI  But on the morn at Ethel's word  Lordmarcher of the land  Indignant thousands on us pour'd  Nor could we more withstand  XCII  My Knights despoil'd of armor peace  Accepted as a boon  My sword alone they dar'd not seize  How useless when alone  XCIII  What then was all my early fame  The wealth by valor giv'n  What then alas even virtue's flame  Th' united gifts of heav'n  XCIV  Lost to my heart its only joy  Extinct at once its flights  Sad images my days employ  And sadder still my nights  XCV  The bridal feast approach'd the vests  To many a fair were shewn  Full was the Baron's hall of guests  Myself forbid alone  XCVI  All hope now lost I wild arose  And soon within the bound  Where piety adores the cross  My feet unconscious found  XCVII  Impell'd by destiny I past  When struck the vesper bell  A dreary eye around I cast  And own'd it as my knell  XCVIII  When lo approaching fast the tread  Of warlike steps I heard  I turn'd and as by justice led  My Rival there appear'd  XCIX  With wonder blessing ev'ry shrine  I drew the wellworn blade  "One moment yet" I cried "is mine  "Deserve or lose the Maid"  C  Impetuous love each sinew strung  As we by turns assail'd  And long the vict'ry doubtful hung  But oh my fate prevail'd  CI  At length between th' illjointed mail  My sword a passage found  Fast rush'd the stream of life and pale  He dropt upon the ground  CII  While sighs of rage from his proud breast  Impell'd the vital flood  A thousand pangs his eye confest  Beyond the waste of blood  CIII  "Ignoble Lord" I cried "she's mine  "On holy land you lie  "Call to your aid the pow'r divine  "Repent before you die"  CIV  "Ah say'st thou" groan'd he "  holy land  "'Twas there my sins began  "For thither heedless of command  "In early youth I ran"  CV  "Broke too the unacknowledg'd tye  "An humble love had made  "And left the charm of ev'ry eye  "In infamy to fade  CVI  "Alas perhaps on Aran's plain  "She yet exists forlorn  "With Albert's heir a fancied swain  "From lineal honors torn  CVII  "To Basil's daughter my true bride  "This ring restore again  "To Basil's daughter" I replied  "What Emma of the plain"  CVIII  He groan'd assentthro' all my frame  Did cold convulsions run  "You see" I falter'd "void of name  "That miserable son  CIX  "The murder'd Emma's only joy"  He bent to earth his head  "Oh do not more than kill me boy"  Allagoniz'd he said  CX  "Yet while I've strength the truth to groan  "To yonder convent run  "Bid here the Monks that I may own  "In you my heir my son"  CXI  Already did th' unwonted sound  The vesper rites restrain  And forth the holy Fathers wound  A venerable train  CXII  With consecrated lights they star  The bosom of the earth  And list with hallow'd zeal afar  The blessing of our birth  CXIII  Before the cross the dying Lord  With penitential awe  In silence first his God ador'd  And mourn'd his broken law  CXIV  Then raising to the Monks his eyes  Where life's last lustre play'd  "Suspend these sacred rites" he cries  'Till I deserve your aid  CXV  "If struggling thus with shame and death  "I dare avow a truth  "Confirm'd by my expiring breath  "Oh vindicate this Youth  CXVI  "Inform my Liege that led by pride  "Yet by fond passion won  "In early youth I chose a bride  "I ever scorn'd to own  CXVII  "With impious zeal the band I join'd  "He led to Palestine  "And with false glory fir'd my mind  "T' elude the wrath divine  CXVIII  "With him I ev'ry danger dar'd  "Which mark'd the proud crusade  "With him a prison's gloom I shar'd  "Nor selt my soul upbraid  CXIX  "While in our Northern wilds was born  "This Youth whose energy  "Has from its seat that being torn  "Which gave him first to be  CXX  "Since justly then in flow'r of health  "I expiate thus my pride  "Oh may he give my heir my wealth  "My namealas my Bride  CXXI  "Unhappy Boy if for thy fire  "These streaming sorrows flow  "To save his soul from endless fire  "Perennial pray'rs bestow"  CXXII  He diednor had I time to think  On all I'd lost or won  I hover'd on creation's brink  And clung to love alone  CXXIII  The busy Monks remov'd the corse  The arms alone remain'd  When fraud effected what nor force  Nor supplication gain'd  CXXIV  Incumber'd with Lord Albert's mail  A desperate hope I try'd  And soon the hostile mountain scale  Where now the gates flew wide  CXXV  The higharch'd halls I safely past  Thro' lucid heraldry  Where echo to the midnight blast  Sigh'd wild and loud as me  CXXVI  'Till the lone gallery now appear'd  Enrich'd with pond'rous mail  Where many a banner timeendear'd  Slow rustled to the gale  CXXVII  Upon its gilded sides pourtray'd  Magnificently old  Each ancestor's distinguish'd shade  Gave lustre to the gold  CXXVIII  The snowy plumes appear to wave  And arms and forms divine  Defend the honors which they gave  Or deify the line  CXXIX  On me all seem to turn their eyes  Prophetic with my doom  Then like the rainbow's transient dyes  They melt into a gloom  CXXX  Beyondall opensilentdim  The length'ning rooms extend  Where tapers shed a quiv'ring gleam  Each moment strove to end  CXXXI  With bold despair I thither past  My sate's extremes to prove  'Till ent'ring with rude step the last  I saw my longlost love  CXXXII  Careless she view'd those arms so fam'd  Nor once remov'd her eyes  "Rests Ethelinda" I exclaim'd  "While ruin'd Edmund dies  CXXXIII  "Or tir'd of having thus withstood  "Resolves she on a crime  "But Hymen's torch is quench'd in blood  "And yielded up to time"  CXXXIV  "By miracle since thou art come"  She falter'd out "t' attest  "With heav'n my melancholy doom  "I trust to that the rest  CXXXV  "Unjust and cruelif you knew  "What doubt my passion yet  "Edmund this heart forever true  "Could break but not forget  CXXXVI  "Each blush which deepen'd on my cheek  "Declar'd my love's excess  "Oh learn to think that passion weak  "Which language can express  CXXXVII  "And when the last fond crimson flies  "With my expiring breath  "Then then allow the sacrifice  "And own my lovein death  CXXXVIII  "Alas ev'n now that hour is come  "For think not I would be  "While herbs afford a mortal bloom  "A Bride and not to thee"  CXXXIX  While yet she spoke the roseate hue  Which on her soft cheek play'd  And her bright eyes celestial blue  Began apace to fade  CXL  O'er her transparent tender skin  An icy polish spread  A nerveless torpor crept within  As she ev'n then were dead  CXLI  More cold and cold that heart now grew  Which gave such rich supplies  More slow and slow her breath she drew  'Till it was nought but sighs  CXLII  And now beyond the grief of thought  And now devoid of bloom  She seem'd a beauteous statue wrought  To grace her own sad tomb  CXLIII  Astoundedhopelessrecklesslost  O'er the fair form tho' dead  Fond fancy's wish vain reason's boast  My heart in silence bled  CXLIV  No voice its solitude could break  No object win my eye  Not ev'n her sire's complaints could wake  A keener agony  CXLV  Alas to him who caus'd the grief  Relenting fortune gave  A sudden and a long relief  In Ethelinda's grave  CXLVI  The Monks Lord Albert's will assert  The King allow'd my claim  When did they know a breaking heart  Revive upon a name  CXLVII  Impatient of the proud controul  And thankless for each care  To all these comforters my soul  Sigh'd only outdespair  CXLVIII  Of ev'ry human hope forlorn  Alldesolate I ran  Wild as these woods in them to mourn  The miseries of Man  CXLIX  Oft on the hill the hunters hear  The sadly vocal gale  And turn aside with holy fear  Nor dare the copse assail  CL  Ev'n the wild deer with look profound  My sorrows seem to share  And ev'ry groaning tree around  But echoes my despair  CLI  'Till sometimes thought's aërial brood  A wan and num'rous train  Fantastic sons of solitude  Catch life from my wild brain  CLII  Full threescore times the frosts have bound  All streams but from these eyes  Since here my careworn limbs first found  A refuge from the skies  CLIII  Years upon years thus slowly roll  Nor comfort bring to me  Since ev'n in sleep my active soul  Lives o'er her misery  CLIV  Dim are my days and near the hour  When death at length is mine  Which only can my bliss restore  Or bid me ne'er repine  CLV  Ye generous poor who send me bread  When on my rushy couch  Your little offspring find me dead  With pious hearts approach  CLVI  Hide me in earth and consecrate  With tears this simple tale  So may you ever 'scape the fate  Of Edmund of the Vale  THE END
