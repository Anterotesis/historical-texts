your fatherYou have too much love to take the one and I too much conscience to give t'otherso we are just where we were madam  Nancy  Don't torment me Jenny  Jenny  Why I fancy we might find a way to reconcile your love and my conscience  Nancy  How how my dear girl  Jenny  Suppose we were to open the affair to your mama  Nancy  Nay now your jesting is cruel  Jenny  I never was more in earnest madamShe loves flattery dearly and she loves her daughter dearly I'll warrant with a sigh and a tear and a handkerchief she makes her husband break his word with young Harlowe in a quarter of an hour after his arrival  Nancy  Not unlikely but if  Jenny  What at your ifsno doubts I beg where I am concern'd  Nancy  But you know my poor mother is so unsettled a creature  Jenny  Why that's true enough

the women in London sure there never was such a temper as my lady's  Mrs  Stock  What can have set this girl against me    Aside  Jenny  Such good humour and good sense together seldom meetthen such a perpetual smile upon her features Well her's is a sort of face that can never grow old what wou'd I give for such a lasting face as she has  Mrs  Stock  Hussey hussey you're a flatterer    Taps her on the shoulder  Jenny  AhMadam is it you I vow you made me start Miss Nancy and I had just been talking of you and we agreed you were one of the best of women the most reasonable friend the tenderest

madam  Mrs  Stock  I am neither headstrong nor fantasticalneither  Jenny  No sweet lady the smallest twine may lead you Miss says I hear reason like your mama will so good a mother do you think force her daughter to marry against her inclinations  Mrs  Stock  I force my child's inclinationsNo I make the case my own But tell me there's a good girl has my daughter an aversion to young Harelowe  Jenny  I don't say that madamthat isaversionto be surebut I believe she hates him like the devil  Mrs  Stock  Poor thing poor thingand perhaps her little heart is beating for another  Jenny  Oh that's a certain rulewhen a young  woman hates her husband 'tis taken for granted she loves another man For example you yourself as you have often told me hated the sight of Mr Stockwell when first he was propos'd for your husbandWhy only because you were in love poor lady with captainyou know whothat was kill'd at the siegeyou know where  Mrs  Stock  Why will you name him Jenny    wipes her eyes  Jenny  Tender lady  Mrs  Stock  Why indeed had that fine young creature surviv'd his wounds I should never have married Mr Stockwellthat I will say  Jenny  Then you know how to pity your daughter Her

at cards with you lately  Mrs  Stock  Who Belford  Jenny  The same and a fine spirited young fellow it is  Enter Miss  Nancy  Miss  Nan  Pardon my folly my misfortunes dear madam if I cannot conform in all my sentiments with your's and my father's  Mrs  Stock  It will happen child sometimes that a daughter's heart may not be dispos'd to comply exactly with the views and schemes of a parentbut then a parent shou'd act with tendernessMy dear I pity your distress Belford has my approbation I assure you  Nancy  You are too good madam  Jenny  Your approbation is not enough madam will you answer for master's too He's a stubborn bit of stuff you know he will not always hearken to reason  Mrs  Stock  But he shall Jenny stubborn as he is I'll soften him I'll take Belford under my protectionHere comes my husbandI have taken my resolutions and you shall see how I'll bring him about presently  Enter Mr  Stockwell  My dear you're come in the very nick of time I have just chang'd my mind  Mr  Stock  You are always changing it I think  Mrs  Stock  I always hearken to reason Mr Stockwell  Mr  Stock  Well and which way does the wind s  now  Mrs  Stock  Why I have taken a resolution not to marry my daughter to young Harlowe  Mr  Stock  Hey that's chopping about indeed  Mrs  Stock  Nay but my dear hear me and let us reason a little here's a better offer for NancyBelford has ask'd her of me  Mr  Stock  Belford a better  Mrs  Stock  Nay but don't be obstinate child he is not indeed so rich as the other but what are riches to content Mr Stockwell  Mr  Stock  And what is content without riches Mrs Stockwell  Mrs  Stock  But he's a gentleman my dear and out of regard to his family we may very well excuse his fortune  Jenny  Well said madam this will do    aside  Mr  Stock  Ha ha ha that's because you were a gentlewomanbut I being a downright cit think just the reverse and out of regard to his fortune if he had one might excuse his familyI have no great objection to the man but is not our word and honour engag'd to another  Mrs  Stock  Eh that's true indeed but  Mr  Stock  Has my old friend Sir Harry Harlowe done any thing to  Mrs  Stock  I don't accuse him my dear  Mr  Stock  Or has his son refus'd to comply  Mrs  Stock  Not in the least that I know of  Jenny  Never flinch madam  Mrs  Stock  Never fear Jenny    aside  Nancy  But I have never seen him papa  Mrs  Stock  No Mr Stockwell she has never seen him  Mr  Stock  So much the better Mrs Stockwell he'll be a greater novelty and please her the better and the longer for it  Mrs  Stock  There is some reason in that Jenny  Jenny  Is there madam then I have not a bit about me  Nancy  But to marry without inclination Sir think of that  Mrs  Stock  Ay think of that Mr Stockwell  Mr  Stock  I never thought of it for myself nor you neither my dear and why shou'd our daughter think herself wiser than her parents  Mrs  Stock  Ay why indeedthere's no answering that Jenny  Jenny  I see there is notWhat a woman    aside  Mr  Stock  It wou'd be such an affront as never cou'd be forgiven Consider dame the instruments are sign'd preparations made and the bridegroom expected every minute 'tis too far gone to be recall'd with any honour  Mrs  Stock  Good lack a day very true very true  Jenny  Well said weathercock about and about we go this woman betrays the whole sexShe won't contradict her own husband
