 VERSES TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF  NEWCASTLE  ON THE DEATH OF THE RIGHT HONOURABLE  HENRY PELHAM  By HENRY JONES AUTHOR of the Earl of ESSEX  LONDON  Printed for R and J DODSLEY in  Pallmall  And sold by M COOPER at the Globe in  PaternosterRow  Price Sixpence  VERSES TO HIS GRACE THE DUKE OF  NEWCASTLE  IF yet your throbbing bosom finds relief  If Reason yet one moment steals from Grief  Forgive my Lord the Muse that late appears  To join with Britain's sighsNEWCASTLE's tears  The Muse that joins her well intended strain  With GEORGE's sacred sighs but joins in vain  Not regal sorrows can that life restore  In vain the kingly fountains rich run o'er  'Tis hers to join with all who truly mourn  Who pour the plaintive note on PELHAM's urn  Mistaken mortals in this vale below  Sons of Adversity and heirs of Woe  The sad inheritance tenacious keep  Too soon they triumph or too late they weep  The good possess'd with listless hearts they rate  Nor prize the bliss enjoy'd till snatch'd by Fate  Reflection then and Gratitude conspire  Then every virtue kindles every fire  The breast humane with sudden fervour burns  Then all the soul alarm'd regrets and mourns  This tribute Virtue from the heart demands  And Nature pays it with obedient hands  To vice high rais'd no hallow'd mark remains  Her springs of pleasures and her source of pains  Ambition's frenzy Lust and Lucre fly  To black Obscurity far off they lie  Sunk in the mass confus'd Oblivion's lot  By Time rejected and by Fame forgot  The allrevered pile erect to Fame  With Virtue's trophies charg'd with Trajan's name  O'er vanquish'd Time shall stand with story'd pride  With each immortal witness at its side  The world's applause by classic pow'r express'd  Which thunder spar'd to strike and Goths molest  O sacred Avarice O thirst divine  Th' immortal springs of paradise are thine  The treasures thine in Time's diminish'd store  For thou shalt claim when he can give no more  Illustrious PELHAM to thy country dear  For whom thy prince still sheds the social tear  Thy honour'd worth with lasting wreaths shall shine  And ev'ry British trophy shall be thine  Not Latian marble nobler praise can give  In ev'ry patriot heart thy name shall live  Nor yet Britannia let thy bosom cease  Thy beating bosom stranger yet to peace  The fatal storm that tore thy bulwark wide  With dread irruption cannot yet subside  Thy agitated heart yet feels the blow  And Justice must approve the grateful woe  'Tis due to merit in the humblest sphere  Where private virtue claims the private tear  A secret transport mingles with such grief  Such gen'rous sorrow brings the soul relief  Reason approves what Passion then bestows  And Nature pays the debt that Friendship owes  Ah say what sad memorial can express  A people's anguish and a king's distress  Alas what monumental mark make known  The sighs of millions griev'da monarch's moan  What equal witness shall invention find  Worthy the friend of truthof humankind  Let Gratitude her sacred source explore  Let Genius turn her treasur'd talents o'er  Let Greece let Rome bestow their rev'rend aid  And rear the awful pile to PELHAM's shade  Let Envy come by factious Malice nurs'd  With all her black seditious brood accurs'd  Come forth at once and witness if she can  That e'er thy shadow Fraud eclips'd the man  She growls conviction with reluctant tone  And grinds the sacred truth she's forc'd to own  The vanquish'd pest retreats that bane of men  Drove back by Truth she seeks her horrid den  A statesman die and not one arrow move  Has Faction lost her nervecan Malice love  Science Sincerity or Truth she can  The blameless minister the upright man  Ev'n in Britannia bless'd a length of years  In whose clear conduct not one stain appears  And will the jarring hydra this proclaim  From all her hostile mouths to PELHAM's fame  Thrice happy PELHAM bless'd beyond compare  Bless'd in thy life and what few else could share  In publick station and exalted trust  Bless'd in thy death and honour'd in the dust  With WALSINGHAM with BURLEIGH blend thy rays  Equal to each in merit as in praise  O if exalted to the realms of joy  Th' immortal mind one moment may employ  On things terrestrial on th' affairs of men  Bow down inraptur'd thy celestial ken  Behold each rank each faction all agree  The patriot's rich reward reserv'd for thee  Alike the prince's and the peasant's tear  In mingled current flowing o'er thy bier  Extatic vision to the virtuous given  Felt with increasing transport tho' in heav'n  How wretched now from thy seraphic sphere  Does Fraud does Flatt'ry to thy sight appear  Ambition's crest how abject does it shew  With Craft with Avarice thy scorn below  How Pomp how Pride how Courts to atoms shrink  From thy averted view how sudden sink  With gold with grandeur these misrated things  These trappings of command these toys of kings  Whilst in some lowly cottage Truth's retreat  Neglected Virtue to thy eye looks great  Th' unbody'd mind affection's force retains  And friendship with the bless'd new fervour gains  Exalted fervour free from earth's cold dross  And each alloy that sensual hearts engross  Still helpful to the good the virtuous mind  Still fond they cast the friendly wish behind  Fast by the stream of life that joyful roves  Through labyrinths of bliss immortal groves  Thy ardent spirit feels a social care  And Friendship still imprints its image there  With each endearing tie through life enjoy'd  With each fond object that the heart employ'd  To Science wedded in th' abstracted bow'r  To business sacred in th' important hour  When deep Experience pois'd Europa's weal  When Britain's genius watch'd the varying scale  And O where heartfelt raptures oft inspir'd  The throb reciprocal by Friendship fir'd  By Sense by Truth by Love by Honour taught  By rip'ning Time to rich perfection brought  Angels themselves might view a scene like this  With longing eyes and envy human bliss  Such soulfelt extasy so deep impress'd  Retains thy Cath'rine's form among the bless'd  Takes off thy raptur'd thought with tender care  Divides perhaps thy wishes even there  What mortal anguish tore each filial breast  When dreadful struck in fix'd amazeexpress'd  By gushing tears when Nature felt the blow  And ev'ry voice was lost in whelming woe  By silent agonizing looks alone  With heartexpressive force to words unknown  Sent from the agitated soul to tell  That Britain lost a friend when PELHAM fell  The parent dearbut sorrow stopt the rest  And Nature sunk beneath the load oppress'd  O Thou to whom my numbers would ascend  The tend'rest brother and the noblest friend  NEWCASTLE PELHAM patriot loyal true  From thy fraternal eye still falls the dew  Of genuine sorrow flowing from the heart  That melting feelsbut Britain claims her part  In thee thy country now demands thy care  Thy Prince to thee inclines th' attentive ear  By anxious thoughts and toils of state oppress'd  He leans for counsel on thy faithful breast  To thee his bosom's inmost weight makes known  Thou firm support thou pillar to his throne  O long support him long his cause defend  Thy Prince's fav'rite and thy country's friend  Another PELHAM to the grave descend  FINIS
