fondly think 'tis friendship's call  But pride and pomp indite  For int'rest with delusive wiles  Beneath fair friendship's form  In sunshine on us sweetly smiles  But leaves us in the storm  Enter  Caroline  Caro  My dear dear Edward  Edw  My sweet Caroline  Caro  Such a delicious scheme as I have devised for our reliefCome come I'll have no more melancholy  Edw  For myself I shou'd not care if

song of freedom if not impeded by its troublesome yet affectionate male  SONG  While pert cock sparrows sport and play  By turns with ev'ry female gay  The turtle faithful to his dove  Lives but for her and lives to love  Still closely nestling side by side  Sit the good bridegroom and good bride  And murm'ring gurgling on the spray  Both bill and coo their hours away  But Edward is the carriage gone  Edw  Sold by auction  Caro  You are so hastybut no matterif my plot don't lift us into another welcome a calash and pattenslet us first methodically state out case to fortune and invoke her aid

morning I'll to my uncle and tell him the same story of youNow each supposing the cause of their displeasure for ever remov'd willI make no doubt restore us again into favour supply us with an ample sum for the present and settle on each an affluent appointment in future  Edw  But the discovery of such a fraud  Caro  Howthey never see each other perhaps never maythen their circle is so remote from oursor at worst can we be poorer or farther remov'd from their favour than at present  Edw  Say no more I am dead  Caro  And I gone with the doleful news to my uncleI fear nothing but a laugh to prevent my success  Edw  And that we do succeed dear fortune grant  DUETTO  Edw  Let me but my Caroline guard  My love from distress let me save  And I ask for no other reward  Or blessing on this side the grave  Caro  Let me but see Edward content  His lot while his Caroline shares  Tho' uncle shou'd never relent  Or aunt shou'd be angry who cares  Both  Deign fortune to smile on a pair
