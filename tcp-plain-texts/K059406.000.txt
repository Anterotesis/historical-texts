 THE ANATOMY OF  ExchangeAlley  OR A  System  of STOCKJOBBING  Proving  that  Scandalous Trade as it is now carry'd on to be Knavish in its Private Practice and Treason in its Publick  Being a clear Detection  I Of the Private Cheats used to Deceive one another  II Of their Arts to draw Innocent Families into their Snares understood by their New Term of Art  viz    being let into the Secret    III Of their Raising and Spreading False News to Ground the Rise or Fall of Stocks upon  IV Of their Joyning with Traytors in Raising and Propagating Treasonable Rumours to Terrify and Discourage the People with Apprehensions of the Enemies to the Government  V Of their Improving those Rumours to make a Run upon the  Bank  and Ruin publick Credit  VI Of the dangerous Consequences of their Practices to the Government and the Necessity there is to Regulate or Suppress them  To which is added Some Characters of the most Eminent Persons concern'd now and for some Years past in Carrying on this Pernicious Trade  By a  JOBBER  The Second Edition Corrected  LONDON  Printed for  E Smith  near  ExchangeAlley  Price One Shilling  THE ANATOMY OF  ExchangeAlley  c  _THE General Cry against StockJobbing has been such and People have been so long and so justly Complaining of it as a publick Nusance and which is still worse have complained so long without a Remedy that the Jobbers harden'd in Crime are at last come to exceed all  bounds and now if ever sleeping Justice will awake and take some Notice of them and if it should not now yet the diligem Creatures are so steddy to themselves that they will some time or other make it absolutely necessary to the Government to demolish them  I know they upon all Occasions laugh at the Suggestion and have the Pride to think it impracticable to restrain them and one of the top of the Function the other Day when I casually told him That if they went on they wou'd make it absolutely necessary to the Legislature to suppress them return'd That he believ'd it was as absolutely necessary for 'em to do it now as ever it could be But how will they do it 'Tis impossible said he but if the Government takes Credit their Funds should come to Market and while there is a Market we will buy and sell there is no effectual way in the World says he to suppress us but this  viz  That the Government should first pay all the publick Debts redeem all the Funds and dissolve all the Charters  viz Bank SouthSea  and  EastIndia  and buy nothing upon Trust and then indeed says he they need not hang the StockJobbers for they will be apt to hang them selves  I must confess I in part agree that this is an effectual way but I am far from thinking it the only way to deal with a Confederation of Usurers who having sold the whole Nation to Usury keep the PurseStrings of Poor and Rich in their Hands which they open and shut as they please  But before I come to the needful ways for restraining those People I think 'twill be of some Service to expose their Practices to common view that the People may see a little what kind of Dealers they are  And first they have this peculiar to 'em and in which they outdo all the particular pieces of publick Knavery that ever I met with in the World  viz  That they have nothing to say for it themselves they have indeed a particular Stock of hard Ware as the Braziers call it in their Faces to bear them out in it but if you talk to them of their Occupation there is not a Man but will own 'tis a compleat System of Knavery that 'tis a Trade founded in Fraud born of Deceit and nourished by Trick Cheat Wheedle Forgeries Falshoods and all sorts of Delusions Coining false News this way good that way bad whispering imaginary  Terrors Frights Hopes Expectations and then preying upon the Weakness of those whose Imaginations they have wrought upon whom they have either elevated or depress'd If they meet with a Cull a young Dealer that has Money to lay out they catch him at the Door whisper to him Sir here is a great piece of News it is not yet publick it is worth a Thousand Guineas but to mention it I am heartily glad I met you but it must be as secret as the black side of your Soul for they know nothing of it yet in the CoffeeHouse if they should Stock would rise  per Cent  in a moment and I warrant you  SouthSea  will be in a Week's Time after it is known Well says the weak Creature prethee dear  Tom  what is it Why really Sir I will  let you into the Secret  upon your Honour to keep it till you hear it from other Hands why 'tis this  The Pretender is certainly taken  and is carried Prisoner to the Castle of  Millan  there they have him fast I assure you the Government had an Express of it from my Lord  Sts  within this Hour Are you sure of it says the Fish who jumps eagerly into the Net Sure of it why if you will take your Coach and go up to the SecretariesOffice you may be satisfied of it your self and be down again in Two Hours and in  the mean time I will be doing something tho' it is but little till you return  Away goes the Gudgeon with his Head full of Wildfire and a Squib in his Brain and coming to the Place meets a Croney at the Door who ignorantly confirms the Report and so sets fire to the Mine for indeed the Cheat came too far to be baulkt at home So that without giving himself Time to consider he hurries back full of the Delusions dreaming of nothing but of getting a Hundred Thousand Pounds or purchase Two and even this Money was to be gotten only upon the Views of his being beforehand with other People  In this Elevation he meets his Broker who throws more Fireworks into the Mine and blows him up to so fierce an Inflamation that he employs him instantly to take Guineas to accept Stock of any Kind and almost at any Price for the News being now publick the Artist made their Price upon him In a Word having accepted them for Fifty Thousand Pounds more than he is able to pay the Jobber has got an Estate the Broker or Guineas and the Esquire remains at Leisure to sell his Coach and Horses his fine Seat and rich Furniture to make good the Deficiency  of his BearSkins and at last when all will not go through it he must give them a Brush for the rest  There are who tell us that the  ExchangeAlley  Improvements made upon the News of the Pretender's being taken were part of the Plot that the late Earl of  Mar  having concerted the Voyage of  Voghera  and how and in what Manner the Report of the Pretender's being there should spread who it should amuse and how at one Blow it should spread East to  Vienna  and NorthWest to  Paris  and so on forgot not to contrive it as at once should serve Political Ends in  Italy  and at  Vienna  So on the other hand it should not fail to serve a private View in  ExchangeAlley  and at the same time that he deceiv'd some of the Whiggs who he ow'd a large Grudge to for shrew'd Turns at  Preston  and  Dumblain  he might also raise a Tax upon them towards the incident Charges of his wandring Circumstances  I do not averr this Story to be true but the Concert is so exact and the Nature of it so agreeable to the Stockjobbing Art nay and to the Artists also whose Correspondents are very punctual especially since it is said that Mr Ts chief Agent was formerly my  Lord  Mr  's Broker that I wont affirm it may be true but this I will venture to say of it That if we are often serv'd thus the Pretender may very easily raise a Hundred Thousand Pounds a Year in  ExchangeAlley  for the carrying on an Invasion and lay the Tax wholly upon his Enemies the Whigs which by the way I leave them to consider of  But now that I may make good the Charge  viz  that the whole Art and Mystery is a meer Original System of Cheat and Delusion I must let you see too that this Part of the Comedy may be very well call'd  A Bite for the Biter  for which I must go back to the Broker and his Gudgeon The Money'd Gentleman finding himself let into the Secret indeed and that he was bitten to the Tune of l worse than nothing After he had unhappily paid as far as his ready Money wou'd go of which Piece of Honesty they say he has heartily repented  and is in Hopes all that come after him will forgive him for the sake of what follow'd  stopt short as he might well you'll say when his Money was all gone and bethinks himself What am la doing I have paid away all this Money like a Fool I was drawn in like an Ass by the eager Desire of Biting my Neighbours to a vast Sum and I  have been Fool enough in that but I have been ten Thousand times a worse Fool to pay a Groat of the Money especially since I knew I could not pay it all Besides who but I would have forgot the Nature of the Thing I was dealing in and of the People I was dealing with why is it not all a meer Body of Knavery Is not the whole Doctrine of StockJobbing a Science of Fraud And are not all the Dealers meer Original Thieves and PickPockets Nay do they not own it themselves Have not I heard  T W B O  and  J S  a thousand times say they know their Employment was a Branch of Highway Robbing and only differ'd in two things  First in Degree    viz  that it was ten Thousand times worse more remorseless more void of Humanity done without Necessity and committed upon Fathers Brothers Widows Orphans and intimate Friends in all which Cases Highwaymen generally touch'd with Remorse and affected with Principles of Humanity and Generosity stopt short and choose to prey upon Strangers only  Secondly in Danger    viz  that these rob securely the other with the utmost Risque that the Highwaymen run at the Hazard of their Lives being sure to be hang'd first or last whereas these rob only at the Hazard of their Reputation which is generally lost before they  begin and of their Souls which Trifle is not worth the mentioning Have not I I say heard my Broker Mr say all this and much more And have not I also heard him say  'That no Man was obliged to make good any of their  ExchangeAlley  Bargains unless he pleased and unless he was in haste to part with his Money which indeed I am not And has not all the Brokers and Jobbers when they have been bitten too hard said the same thing and refused to pay'  'Pray how much did Old  Cudworth Ph Cpm  and Mr  Goog  Eminent Jobbers Monarchs in their Days of  ExchangeAlley  break for And how much did they ever pay One if I mistake not compounded at last for one Penny  per  Pound and the other Two for something less'  'In a Word they are all a Gang of Rogues and Cheats and I'll pay none of them Besides my Lawyer Sir  Thomas Subtle  tells me there's not a Man of them dares sue me  No tho' I had no Protection to fly to  and he states the Case thus'  'You have Sir  says Subtle  contracted to accept of Stock at a high Price  EastIndia  at    Bank  at  SouthSea  and the like  Very well  they come to put it upon you the Stock being since fallen tell them you cannot take it yet If they urge your Contract and demand when you will take it  tell them  you will take it when you think fit'  'If they swagger call Names as Rogue Cheat  and the like  tell them  as to that  you are all of a Fraternity there is no great Matter in it whether you Cheat them or they Cheat you 'tis as it happens in the Way of Trade that it all belongs to the Craft and as the Devil's Broker  Whiston  said to Parson  Giffard  tell them you are all of a Trade If they Rage and tell you the Devil will have you and such as that  tell them  they should let the Devil and you alone to agree about that 'tis none of their Business But when he comes for you tell them you would advise them to  keep out of the Way  or  get a Protection  as you have against them'  'After this it is supposed they will sue you at Law then leave it to me I'll hang them up for a Year or Two in our Courts and if ever in that time the Stock comes up to the  Price we will tender the Money in Court demand the Stock and Saddle the Charges of the Suit upon them let them avoid it if they can'  'This is my Lawyer's Opinion  says he to himself  and I'll follow it to a Tittle and so we are told he has and I do not hear that one StockJobber has begun to sue him yet or intends it nor indeed dare they do it'  This Experiment indeed may teach Understanding to every honest Man that falls into the Clutches of these merciless Men call'd StockJobbers and I give the World this Notice that in short not one of their  ExchangeAlley  Bargains need be otherwise than thus complied with and let these  Buyers of Bearskins  remember it not a Man of them dare go to CommonLaw to recover the Conditions nor is any Man oblig'd further then he thinks himself oblig'd in Principle to make good one of his Bargains with them how far Principle will carry any Man to be just to a common Cheat that has drawn him into a Snare I do not indeed know but I cannot suppose 'twill go a very great Length where there is so clear so plain and so legal a Door to get out at  It must be confess'd that if the projected Story of the taking the Pretender was acted in Concert between  Rome  and  ExchangeAlley  between my Lord  Marr  and a certain Broker as Fame reports either the Broker is the Devil of a Jacobite or my Lord the Devil of a Broker it must be acknowledg'd 'twas a far fetch'd Trick and answer'd the End in Exchange most admirably  Nor can all the World tell us any other End that it could answer for as to the Pretences of deluding the  Imperialists  on Shore or the  British  Men of War at Sea and so the better to facilitate the Escape of the Pretender to  Spain  I undertake to prove that this is absurd and ridiculous for the Pretender was Embark'd at  Netunna  and gone away to Sea thirteen Days at least before this Whim of People taken at  Voghera  was talk'd of  As to the Amusements among the Courtsa  Vienna Paris  and  London  they amounted to nothing at all answer'd no End neither prompted any Design on one hand or hindred any Thing on the other In a Word we may challenge the World to tell us any one Turn that was serv'd by it or End answer'd by it▪ but this in  ExchangeAlley  Nor was this so inconsiderable a Design as not to be worth while to form such a Juggle tho' a great way off and as far off as it is if we may believe the Report of those who remember the Machines and Contrivances of that Original of StockJobbing Sir  J C  There are those who tell us Letters have been order'd by private Management to be written from the  EastIndies  with an Account of the Loss of Ships which have been arriv'd there and the Arrival of Ships lost of War which the  Great Mogul  when they have been in perfect Tranquility and of Peace with the  Great Mogul  when he was come down against the Factory of  Bengale  with One Hundred Thousand Men just as it was thought proper to calculate those Rumours for the Raising and Falling of the Stock and when it was for his Purpose to but cheap or sell dear  It would be endless to give an Account of the Subtiltics of that Capital Chet when he had a Design to Bite the whole  Exchange  As he was the leading Hand to the Market so he kept it in his Power to set the Price to all the Dealers The Subject then was clrie fly the  EastIndia  Stock tho' there were other Stocks  on foot too tho' since sunk to nothing such as the  Hudson  'sBay Company the Linnen Manufacture Stock Paper Stock SaltPetre Stock and others all at this Day worse than nothing tho' some of them then Jobb'd up to  per Cent  as the two first in particular  But the  EastIndia  Stock was the main Point every Man's Eye when he came to Market was upon the Broker's who acted for Sir  J  Does Sir  J  Sell or Buy If Sir  J  had a Mind to buy the first thing he did was to Commission his Brokers to look sower shake their Heads suggest bad News from  India  and at the Bottom it follow'd I have Commission from Sir  J  to sell out whatever I can and perhaps they would actually sell Ten perhaps Twenty Thousand Pound immediately the  Exchange  for they were not then come to the  Alley  was full of Sellers no Body would buy a Shilling till perhaps the Stock would fall Six Seven Eight Ten  per Cent  sometimes more then the Cunning Jobber had another Sett of Men employ'd on purpose to buy but with Privacy and Caution all the Stock they could lay their Hands on 'till by selling Ten Thousand Pound at or  per Cent  lost he would buy a Hundred Thousand Pound Stock at or  per Cent  under Price  and in a few Weeks by just the contrary Method set them all a buying and then sell them their own Stock again at ten or twelve  per Cent  Profit  These honest Methods laid the Foundation we will not say of a fine great Stone House on a certain Forrest but it certainly laid the Foundation of an Opulent Family and iniutiated the Crowd of Jobbers on that dexterity in tricking and cheating one another which to this Day they are the greatest Proficients that this part of the World ever saw  To come a little nearer home We had another Gentleman who from a small Beginning came to leave  as they say who speak of the least    l  behind him and yet did not die an old Man neither This Knight to avoid as much as possible Reflections upon the Ashes of the Dead added to the former Craft that of bringing sudden News into  ExchangeAlley  calculated to the Wagers he had to lay or to any he had to hedge off and by this gain'd immense Sums of Money where he living I should give it an harder Name Why should it be thought so strange that my Lord  Marr  and his Broker should trump up a Story from  Italy  send a Sett of PostChaises with Gentlemen in Disguise  out of the way of all Road to be taken up in the  Milanese  and sent to the Castle and then sent word to a Great Man in  England  who is a BELIEVER that it was the Pretender and all this to raise the Price of Stocks and put it upon the Whiggs I say Why should this be more strange than that Sir  H Fse  in the late King  William  's Reign was able to maintain such a constant Intelligence in  Holland Flanders Germany Ireland  c that he several times brought the King Accounts of Battles fought Victories won Towns taken  c  before the swiftest Expresses of the King's own Servants and Generals could arrive and had once a Diamond Ring of  l  given him by the King for his early News  By this exactly concerted Intelligence he then knew how to turn the Wagers a sort of Jobbing then in Mode and which grew so infamous that they were at length oblig'd to suppress it by Act of Parliament which way he pleased and by which he got an immense Sum of Money How often did the Gentleman run down true News as if it had been false and run up false News as if it had been true by the Force of his Foreign Intelligeneers how often coin Reports of great Actions to serve a Turn it is too late a Trick to be forgot by many that were hit by it to the Bone  In a word they putting false News upon us is nothing but an old Trade reviv'd tho' it must be confess'd this of the Pretender has been a MasterPiece and the worthy Projector who has the Credit of it must pass for a dextrous Manager as any the University of  ExchangeAlley  has bred up for Years past  It had also one Particular in it for which it was very remarkable Sham Reports False News Foreign Letters  c  are Things that have been often trumpt upon us as above and the Town have been not long ago cheated to a good round Sum that Way But then they have been soon detected the Morning News has been set to rights in the Afternoon or the Evening's Heat has cool'd by Morning But this Trick had a fatal Duration for it held us near a Fortnight in a firm Perswasion of the Thing and even then it continued but suspected only for some time longer and was yet longer before it was fully detected and even at last it was hardly conquered till the Jacobites laugh us out of it and the Pretender was look'd for nearer Home  The Assurance with which it was carry'd about the several Places from whence it was  written made it so effectually be swallow'd down that really People saw no room to question the Truth of it for a great while 'Twas written from  Rome  from  Leghorn  from  Genoa  from  Turin  and from  Paris  Nay 'twas even believ'd at Court and almost every where else  Exquisite Fraud  who could have believed this had been born in  ExchangeAlley  sent over to  Rome  agreed to there and executed in such a Manner as to cheat not the Town only but all Europe  The Authority that every one found attemded the Report supported it so that it possess'd us all even those whose Concern for the Fact extorted Tears from them were not undeceiv 'd Thus the Hucksters had Time to play their Game and they made Hay while the Sun shone for if we may believe Common Fame Bargains Contracts and Agreements for Stocks BearSkins included amounted in that time to some Hundred Thousands of Pounds nay some say to Two Millions and better most of which was to the Loss of the  Believing  Party  But what Tricking what Fraud what laying Plots as deep as Hell and as far as the ends of the Earth is here What Cheating of Fathers and Mothers and Brothers gulling Widows Orphans couzening the most Wary and plundering the Unwary And how much meaner Roberies than these bring the Friendless even to the Gallows every Sessions  But I must not stop here the Story of the Pretender is over that Trump is play'd and the artful Gamester's wanting a new Trick after having play'd so many already that one would think Invention was at an end yet they have found it out and we are just led into the Secret  Hitherto Craft and Knavery appears to be their Method but we shall trace them now a little further and like true Hassars that plunder not the Enemy only but their own Army as the Opportunity presents so these Men are now come to prey upon the Government it self  Let us look into the late Lotteries had not a piercing Eye detected the Rognery and not the fall of other things taken off the Edge of the  Peoples Fancy for venturing these Artists had brought up the Tickets to  s  apiece advance even before the Act was pass'd That this could not be but by securing the Possession of all the Tickets in their own hands except such select Tickets as were not to come to  Market  I  say  that this could not be but by Connivance and this every one knows and that this Connivance again could not be but by some higher People than those that were nam'd to it this also every one may know who they were is none of my Business to enquire tho' 'tis easy to guess 'Tis very hard when our Statesmen come into a Confederacy to bite the People and when Dukes turn StockJobbers Yet that this was done is most certain and what was this but making a Property of the Power that might be in their Hands the better to bite the People For if the Parliament appointed  l  in Tickets to be given out at a certain Rate that was low and reasonable was it not to encourage the People on whom the rest of the National Burthen lies And if by the Craft and Knavery of Jobbers the People are made to pay  l  for them  which is much about the Case  pray why not pay the Hundred Thousand Pounds to the Publick either to pay off a Hundred Thousand Pounds of Debt or to make the Burthen  of the current Year a Hundred Thousand Pounds lighter of which I am sure there is need enough  It has been indeed our Happiness that a worthy Member being inform'd of this abominable Cheat detected it and laid it before the House upon which a Vote was past to make void all Bargains made for Tickets before the Act was past so the Biters were Bitten and a certain Sir  George  was oblig'd to refund but the Roguery of the Design was never a Jot the less for that  But the fatal Influences of this growing Evil does not end here and I must trace Stockjobbing now to its new acquir'd Capacity of intermeddling with the Publick assisting Rebellion encouraging Invasion and if I do not bring the Stockjobbers even the Whigs among them to be guilty of Treason against their King and Country and that of the worst Kind too then I do nothing  Had the Stockjobbers been all Jacobites by Profession or had the Employment led them by the Necessity of their Business to put King and Nation and particularly their own to Bargain and Sale and had the selling of News  een their Property and they had an Act of  Parliament or Patent to entitle them to the sole Privilege of imposing what false Things they pleased on the People I should have had much the less Reason to have complain'd of their Roguery and have rather turn'd my self to the rest of them People who are the Subject they work upon and only have stood at  ExchangeAlley  End and cried out  Gentlemen have a care of your Pockets  Again had it been a private Club or Suciety of Men acting one among another had the Cheats the Frauds and the Tricks they daily make use of  in which the English Rogue was a Fool to them  been practis'd upon themselves only and like Gamesters at a publick Board they had only play'd with those that came there to play with them in this Case also I should have held my Tongue and only put them in mind of an old Song every  Stanza  of which chim'd in with  Tantararand  Rogues all Rogues all  But when we find this Trade become a Political Vice a publick Crime and that as it is now carried on it appears dangerous to the Publick that whenever any Wickedness is it Hand any Mischief by the worst of the Nations Enemies upon the Wheel the Stock  Jobbers are naturally made assistant to it that they become Abettors of Treason assistant to Rebellion and Invasion then it is certainly time to speak for the very Employment becomes a Crime and we are oblig'd to expose a Sort of Men who are more dangerous than a whole Nation of Enemies Abroad an Evil more formidable then the Pestilence and in their Practise more fatal to the Publick than an Invasion of  Spaniards  It is said by some that the principal Leaders in the Jobbing Trade at that Time and at whom most part of the Satyr in this Work ought to be pointed are Whigs Members of Parliament and Friends to the Government and that the refore I had best have a Care of what I say of them  My first Answer is  So I will  I will have a Care of them and in the next Place let them have a Care of me for if I should speak the whole Truth of some of them they might be Whigs but I dare say they would be neither Pmen or Friends to the Government very long and it is very hard his Majesty should not be told what kind of Friends to him such Men are  Besides I deny the Fact these Men Friends to the Government  Jesu Maria  The Government may be friendly to them in a manner they do not deserve but as to their being Friends to the Government that is no more possible than the Cardinal  Alberoni  or the  Chevalier de St George  are Friends to the Government and therefore without reflecting upon Persons naming Names or the like  there will be no need of Names the Dress will describe them  I lay down this new fashion'd Proposition or  Postulatum  take it which way you please that I will make it out by the Consequences of what I am going to say  That Stockjobbing as it is now practised and as is generally understood by the Word Stockjobbing is neither less or more than HighTreason in its very Nature and in its Consequences  That the Stockjobbers who are guilty of the Practices I am going to detect are eventually Traytors to King  George  and to his Government Family and Interest and to their Country and deserve to be used at least as Confederates with Traytors when ever there are any alarms of Invasions Rebellions  or any secret Practices against the Government of what Kind soever  This is a black Charge and boldly laid and ought therefore to be effectually made out which shall be the Work of a few Pages in the following Sheets  First  I lay down this as a Rule which I appeal to the Laws of Reason to support that all those People who at a Time of publick Danger whether of treasonable Invasion from Abroad or trayterous Attempts to raise Insurrections at Home shall willingly and wittingly abett assist or encourage the Traytors Invading or Rebelling are equally guilty of Treason  Secondly  All those who shall endeavour to weaken disappoint and disable the Government in their Preparations or discourage the People in their assisting the Government to oppose the Rebels or Invadors are guilty of Treason  All that can be alledg'd in Contradiction to this and perhaps that could not be made our neither is That they are not Traytors within the Letter of the Law to which I answer  if they were I should not Satyrize them but Impeach them But if it appears that they are as effectually destructive to the Peace and Safety of the Government and of the King's Person and Family as if they were in open War with his Power I do the same Thing and fully answer the End proposed  As there are many Thieves besides HouseBreakers HighwayMen Lifters and Pickpockets so there are many Traytors besides Rebels and Invaders and perhaps of a much worse Kind for as in a Dispute between a certain Lord and a Woman of Pleasure in the Town about the different Virtue of the Sexes the Lady insisted that the Men were Agressors in the Vice and that in plain  English  if there were no WhoreMasters there would be no Whores So in a Word if there were no Parties at Home no Disaffection no Traytors among our selves there would be no Invasions from Abroad  Now I will suppose for the Purpose only that the People I am speaking of were not disaffected to the Government I mean not originally and intentionally pointing their Design at the Government nay that they are hearty Whigs call them as we please yet if it appear  they are hearty Knaves too will do any thing for Money and are by the Necessity of their Business oblig'd or by the vehement Pursuit of their Interest that is to say of their Profits push'd upon Things as effectually ruinous and destructive to the Government as the very buying Arms and Amunition by a profest Jacobite in order to Rebellion could be are they not Traytors even in spite of Principle in spite of the Name of Whig nay in spite of a thousand meritorious things that might otherwise be said of them or done by them  A GunSmith makes ten Thousand Firelocks in the  Minories  the honest Man may be a Whig he designs to sell them to the Government to lay up in the  Tower  or to kill  Spaniards  or any of the rest of the King's Enemies a Merchant comes and buys some of them and says they are for the  WestIndies  or to sell into  France  But upon Enquiry it appears they are bought for Rebellion the unde signing GunSmith comes into Trouble of course and it will be very hard for him to prove the Negative  viz  That when he has furnish'd the Rebels with Arms he had no Share in the Rebellion  To bring this home to the Case in view who were the Men who in the late Hurry of an expected Invasion sunk the Price of Stocks to  per Cent  Who were the Men that made a run upon the  Bank  of  England  and pusht at them with some particular Pique too if possible to have run them down and brought 'em to a Stop of Payment And what was the Consequences of these Things Will they tell us that running upon the  Bank  and lowering the Stocks was no Treason We know that litterally speaking those things are no Treason But is there not a plain constructive Treason in the Consequences of it Is not a wilful running down the publick Credit at a Time when the Nation is threaten'd with an Invasion from Abroad and Rebellion at Home Is not this adding to the Teror of the People Is not this disabling the Government discouraging the King's Friends and a visible Encouragement of the King's Enemies Is not all that is taken from the Credit of the Publick on such an Occasion added to the Credit of the Invasion Does not every thing that weakens the Government strengthen its Enemies And is not every Step that is taken in Prejudice of the King's Interest a Step taken in Aid of the design'd Rebellion The kindest thing that can be said of a  certain Triumvirate of Jobbers whose Hands have been deepest in this Part of the Work and who indeed had more Obligations upon them than any other Men in the Town to have assisted the Publick Interest and advanced the Credit of the Nation is that they did not think what they did and that this Excuse may not serve them another Time I may soon furnish them with an Anatomy of some of the Conduct of that little Body of  Number Three  that when they see their Mistakes with the Eyes that other Men see them they may at their Leisure give a better Turn to the Measures of Unbounded Avarice  And now that I may not be said to speak without a Precedent I humbly refer to those money'd Gentlemen to a Case recent in Memory and even in their own which tho' indeed they may think fit to have forgotten for a time they will all call to mind when they hear of it again and this was the Case of two Goldsmiths Knights also and one of them Member of Parliament too in  Fleetstreet  who push'd at the Bank of  England  at the Time that the Pretender's Invasion from  France  was in its Preparation One of them it was said had gather'd a quantity of BankBills to the value of near l and the  other a great Sum tho' not so many and it was said resolv'd to demand them all at once  Let the Gentlement I point at look back to the printed Papers that Year let them enquire what Construction was put upon it let them enquire how the Government resented it how my Lord Treasurer  Godolphin  look'd upon it as a Mine form'd to blow up the Queen's Affairs and how in a Word all the Friends of the Government took it to be such a Step in favour of the Pretender as was impossible to consist with Duty to the Queen  Let them enquire further with what Difficulty Sir  R H  wip'd off the Imputation of being a Favourer of the Rebellion and how often in vain he protested he did it with no such View and how hard the Whiggs were to believe him Sir  F Cd  indeed carry'd it with a higher Hand and afterwards pretended to refuse the Bills of the Bank but still declar'd he did it as a Goldsmith and as a piece of Justice to himself in some Points in which the Bank had as he alledg'd us'd him ill But in general it was look'd upon as an open Affront to the Government and an abetting and countenancing the Invasion of the Pretender from Abroad and the  Rebellion intended at Home Nor was the Government much less were the Authors of private Papers and Prints wanting in letting them know it nay if I am not misinform 'd they were threatned with being treated as Enemies to the Government and if Things had gone on to Extremities they had doubtless been mark'd out as Persons the Government were to take care of  Now I only speak in plainer Words It was said then that such Men as endeavour'd to run down the Publick Credit were Enemies to the Government I know no Distinction in the Case that should require so much Tenderness every Subject of King  George  who is at the same time an Enemy to King  George  is a Traytor and every OvertAct of that Enmity it being his Duty to his utmost to favour aid and support the Government is an Overt Act of Treason let it be gilded over with what fine Words the Persons please 'tis the same thing if it is not literal Treason and within reach of the Statute yet the Crime is in it self of the same Nature  And let any one tell me what is the Difference between two Dealers in Paper Credit in the time of a  French  Invasion and three  Dealers in PaperCredit in the time of a  Spanish  Invasion or what Sanctity in  BirchinLane  more than in  Fleetstreet  that one should be a Protection for the same Practice that was resented so justly in another  Were those Stockjobbers sincerely and heartily in the Interest of King  George  and his Government as they pretend loudly what Run could there be upon the Bank what Ebb of Credit what sinking of Stock The honest Whiggs who were Friends to the Government at that Time mention'd above who not only knew their Duty but how to make it seasonable and useful acted after another Manner when others run upon the Bank with all the Fury possible they carry'd all the Money thither they could gather up Nay I could name a Man in this City who having but in the World carry'd it all into the Bank to support the Credit of the Publick and the Story being told to her Majesty by the late Lord Treasurer  Godolphin  The Sense of such Fidelity so mov'd the Queen that she sent him a Hundred Pounds as a Gift a Royal Token of her accepting such an Act of Loyalty and caused my Lord to give him an Obligation from the Treasury to repay him the whole  l  if any Disaster to the Bank should have made it doubtful  Where's the like Courage and Conduct to be found now Is it in Being Are the Gentlemen less able Or is it that they have not the same Zeal for King  George  as that honest Citizen had for the Queen Or do they doubt the King being as sensible of the Service Or what is the matter that the Publick Credit had rather met with injurious Juggling and Jobbing upon it than real Support either from  ExchangeAlley Birchin Lane  or some other Places less noted  Let those Men reflect a little upon the Circumstances the Publick Credit must have been in by such Management if the  Spanish  Attempt had been made and if these Easterly Protestant Winds had not chopt in by which Providence has given the Government Time to put it self into a Posture of Defence so as now not to be afraid of them and if the Capital Stock of the Persons interested in the Funds is now sunk a Million in the real Value of them as they stood before even at the Market which is nothing but what the Matter of Fact will justify to what Degree would the same Current if it had gone on have sunk the Estates of all the Money'd Men in  England  In what Manner would Money have been rais'd upon a new Credit for any immediate Exigencies that might have happened And should the Goverment have been supported nay though the Parliament had granted Funds while these Men had made all Credit ebb perhaps to or  per Cent  Discount and is not this then a Species of Treason and Rebellion  It was very remarkable that in the Juncture of those Things the Jacobites could not refrain taking notice how easie it was to set the Citizens a plundering the Bank and even the Exchequer too for had this gone on the Funds which are in effect the Exchequer it self would have gone down Hill Hand in Hand with the Bank Credit would have borne equal Pace in one as well as in the other and the Government would no more have been able to borrow than the Bank would have been able to pay  It is scarce fit to enter into a Description of all the mischievous Consequences which necessary follow running down the Publick Credit in case of such Dangers as I have mention 'd above if I should fully describe them it would appear incredible Every one will  allow that this Practice of the Jobbers carry 'd on a little further would indeed appear to be the worst Kind of Treason  But it is needful after having said thus much of the Crime to say something of the Place and then a little of the Persons too The Center of the Jobbing is  in the Kingdom  of  ExchangeAlley  and its Adjacencies the Limits are easily surrounded in about a Minute and a half  viz  stepping out of  Jonathan  's into the Alley you turn your Face full  South  moving on a few Paces and then turning Due  East  you advance to  Garraway  's from thence going out at the other Door you go on still  East  into  BirchinLane  and then halting a little at the SwordBlade Bank to do much Mischief in fewest Words you immediately face to the  North  enter  Cornhill  visit two or three petty Provinces there in your way  West  And thus having Box'd your Compass and sail'd round the whole Stockjobbing Globe you turn into  Jonathan  's again and so as most of the great Follies of Life oblige as to do you end just where you began  But this is by way of Digression and even still before I come to the main Case I am oblig'd to tell you That though this is the  Sphere of the  Jobbers  Motion the Orbe to which they are confin'd and out of which they cannot well act  in their Way  yet it does not follow but that Men of Foreign Situation I mean Foreign as to them I do not meak Foreign by Nation and of different Figure are seen among them nay some whose Lustre is said to be too bright for the Hemisphere of a CoffeeHouse have yet their Influence there and act by Substitutes and Representatives But first I must speak to Originals  C  a Man of Brass sufficient for much more Businets than he can be trusted wich is  to manage for three blue Ribbonds and for four or five Cath  epers who tell more Money than their own He fetches and carries with such indefatigable Application that he is said never to sail his Appointments to a Minute however remote from one another Whereever he appears he makes an  ExchangeAlley  in his Person and  a Court  in his Audience He is himself a  JonathansCosseehouse  in little Tho' he be at a CockPit he reallizes  ExchangeAlley  in every Place and yet he rather is directed than directs and like a certain great General famed for more Fire than Flegm is fitter to drive than to lead  S  has twice the Head but not half the Business as  C  is said to have yet he gets more Money for himself and  C  gets more for other Folks  S  is as cunning as  C  is bold and the Reserve of one with the Openness of the other makes a compleat  ExchangeAlley Man C  jumps at every thing and as he got the start of the World at his Beginning by venturing more than he was worth so he deals now with all Men as if they ventured more than they are worth Originally he was a BITE which in Modern Language is a  Sharper  or being fully interpreted may signify the head Class of the Fraternity call'd  Pick pockets  T  a Gamester of the same Board acts in Concert with  C  and  S  and makes together a true Triumverate of modern Thieving He inherits the Face of  C  with the Crafr of  S  but seems to take State upon him and acts the reserv'd Part more than either yet even this too is all Grimace for where e'er he can be sure to kill he an't fawn like an  IrishMan  They are all Three of yesterday in their Characters yet they are old in the Cr  e    viz  of  resolving to be rich at the Price of every Man they can bubble  Their first Blow was aimed at the BANK but there they were outwitted and the Great LordTreasurer  Godolphin  in the late Reign gave them their just Characters from that Action The Defeat they met with there sticks so close to them that they reserve the Measures of their Revenge nor to cool no not till the Charter of the Bank shall expire  However their Wings being clipt by the Clause then obtain'd in an Act of Parliament  viz  That no Society Corporation  c  should issue out Bills of Credit as a Bank but the Bank of  England  only they were obliged ever since to turn  StockJobbers  or if we may speak properly of them they are the  StockJobbers  Masters for they have so many  BearSkins  pawn'd to them at a time so much Stock deposited with them upon Bottomree as it might be call'd that indeed they may he call'd the City PawnBrokers And I have been cold that they have had fifty StockJobbers and Brokers bound Hand and Foot and laid in Heaps at their Doors at a time  The next Trick they try'd and which was in+deed the Masterpiece of their Knavery was th  getting an Assignment of the Forfeited Estates in  Ireland  into their Hands Indeed they began the World upon this Prospect and expected to have had the whole Kingdom of  Ireland  mortgaged to them But here too they were disappointed and had they not found a Man that had as much Money as themselves and more Honesty that Bargain of the Forfeited Estates had been the last they had made in the World  The Endeavours they use to cheat that Gentleman after he had deliver'd them from a Blow that would have blown them up is another black Part of their Story that remains to be told for the Illustration of their Characters at another time But in the Interm 'tis enough to say that he who deliver  d them as Fools knew how to deliver himself from them as Knaves and so they were dropt out of the  Irish  Bargain to their great Mortification  Now they stand ready as Occasion offers and Profit presents to Stockjobb the Nation  ouzen the Parliament ruffle the Bank run up and run down Stocks and put the Dice upon the whole Town  They had another Flap with a FoxTail to the Scandal of their Politicks in the late Vote about the Tickets of the Lottery which I mentioned above what Market they will make of it is well enough known But the Plot was never the less Cunning and 'tis certain the Knavery is not the less visible for the Miscarriage I come next to their more modern Management  Whenever they call in their Money the  StockJobbers  must sell the  Bearskin Men  must commute and pay Difference money then down come the Stocks tumbling Two or Three  per Cent  then the Tools must sell and then Masters buy the next Week they take in Stocks again then the Jobbers buy and the Managers sell Thus the Jobbers bite their Friends and these Men bite the Jobbers  qui Sarpat Sharpabitur ExchangeAlley Latin  they that are let into the Secret will understand it  The Truth is it has been foretold by cunning Men who often see what can't be hid▪ that these Men by a Mass of Money which they command of other Peoples as well as their own will in Time ruin the Jobbing Trade But 'twill be only like a general Visitation where all Distempers are swallow'd  up in the Plague like a common Calamity that makes Enemies turn Friends and drowns lesser Grievances in the general Deluge For if the Reprisal Trade should adjourn from  ExchangeAlley  to  BirchinLane  it may seem to be like the banishing Usury from the City of  Rome  which transferr'd it to a Jew at  Genoa  a Monk at  Naples  and a Banker at  Venice  who it was said had no less than seven and twenty Principalities in  Italy  mortgag'd to them at a Time besides two Kingdoms seven Dutchies and the Jewels of the Crown of  France  Having thus given the blazing Characters of three Capital Sharpers of  GreatBritain  Knaves of lesser Magnitude can have no room to shine the Alley throngs with Jews Jobbers and Brokers their Names are needle ss their Characters dirty as their Employment and the best thing that I can yet find out to say of them is that there happens to be two honest Men among them Heavens preserve their Integrity for the Place is a Snare the Employment it self fatal to Principle and hitherto the same Observation which I think was very aptly made upon the Mint will justly turn upon them  viz  That many an honest Man  has gone in to them but cannot say that I ever knew One come an honest Man out from them  But to leave them a little and turn our Eyes another way Is it not surprizing to find new Faces among these scandalous People and Persons even too big for our Reproof Is it possible that  Stars  of another Latitude should appear in our Hemisphere Had it been  Sims  or  Bowcher  or Gamesters of the DrawingRoom or Masquerades there had been little to be said or had the GroomPorter's been transpos'd to  Garraway  's and  Jonathan  's it had been nothing new true Gamesters being always ready to turn their Hand to any Play But to see Statesmen turn Dealers and Men of Honour stoop to the Chicanry of Jobbing to see Men at the Orfices in the Morning at the P House about Noon at the Cabinet at Night and at  ExchangeAlley  in the proper Intervals What new  Phoenomina  are these What fatal Things may these shining Planets like the late Great Light foretell to the State and to the Publick for when Statesmen turn Jobbers the State may be Jobb'd  It may be true that a Treasurer or Cashkeeper may be trusted with more Money than he is worth and many times it is so and if the Man be honest there may be no harm in it But when a Treasurer plays for more Money than he is worth they that trust him run a Risque of their Money because tho' he may be an honest Man he may be undone I speak of private not publick Treasurers  Indeed it requires some Apology to say such a One may be an honest Man it would be hard to call him an honest Man who plays away any Man's Money that is not his own or more than he is able to pay again out of his own But if it be dishonest to play it away  that is  lose it at Play 'tis equally dishonest to play with it whether it be lost or no because in such a Case he that plays for more than he can pay his Master runs the Hazard more than himself nay his Master runs an unequal Hazard for if the Money be lost 'tis the Masters if there is Gain 'tis the Servants  StockJobbing is Play a Box and Dice may be less dangerous the Nature of them are alike a Hazard and if they venture at either what is not their own the Knavery  is the same It is not necessary any more than it is safe to mention the Persons I may think of in this Remark they who are the Men will easily understand me  In a Word I appeal to all the World whether a Man that is intrusted with other Mens Money whether Publick or Private is not the Question ought to be seen in  ExchangeAlley  Would it not be a sufficient Objection to any Gentleman or Merchant not to employ any Man to keep his Cash or look after his Estate to say of him  he plays  he is  a Gamester  or he is  given to Gaming  and  StockJobbing  which is still worse gives the same or a stronger Ground of Objection in the like Cases  Again are there fewer Sharpers and Setters in  ExchangeAlley  than at the GroomPorters Is there less Cheating in StockJobbing than at Play Or rather is there not fifty times more An unenter'd Youth coming to deal in  ExchangeAlley  is immediately surrounded with Bites Setters Pointers and the worst sort of Cheats just as a young Country Gentleman is with Bauds Pimps and Spungers when he first comes to Town It is ten Thousand to one when a forward  young Tradesman steps out of his Shop into  ExchangeAlley  I say 'tis ten Thousand to one but he is undone if you see him once but enter the fatal Door never discount his Bills afterwards never trust him with Goods at six Months Pay any more  If it be thus dangerous to  the Mean  what is it to  the Great  I see only this difference that in the first the Danger is Private in the latter Publick  It has not been many Years since Elections for Members of came to Market in  ExchangeAlley  as current as Lottery Tickets now and at a Price like these much above what any Parliament allow'd them to go at While this was carry'd on a great many honest Men exclaim'd against it and expos'd it nay several Acts of Parliament were propos'd for regulating Elections and preventing Bribery and Corruption But all this would not do and this indeed was one of the happy Consequences of that otherwise necessary Act for  Triennial Parliaments  and I firmly believe that it is oweing very much to the late suspending that Act for a Time that these Things are not come to Market again  It may easily be remember'd that the first Occasion of the  ExchangeAlley  Men engaging in the Case of Elections of Members was in King  William  's Time on the famous Disputes which happen'd between the Old  EastIndia  Company and the New which having held a great while and having embarrass'd not the City only but the whole Nation and even made it self dangerous to the Publick Business it was expected it should be fully decided by the House of Commons To this End the Members of both Companies with all the Trick Artifice Cunning and Corruption that Money and Interest could arm them with bestirred themselves to be chosen Members  Brokers rid Night and Day from one End of the Kingdom to the other to engage Gentlemen to bribe Corporations to buy off Competitors and to manage the Elections You will see the State of Things at that Time and the Danger this Stock jobbing Wickedness had brought the Publick to if you please to read the following Exclamation of the honest Freeholders at that Time which was presented to the Publick by way of Complaint The Thing was laid before the King first and before the Parliament afterwards and it  was his Majesty's Sense of the Consequence that made him resolve to bring the two  EastIndia  Companies to unite their Stocks for in a word the StockJobbers embroil'd the whole Nation  'The grand Work which the whole Nation is now intent upon is chusing their Representatives in Parliament chusing Men to meet and advise with the King about the most important Affairs of the Kingdom'  'And while all Men ought to be fixing their Eyes upon such Men as are best qualified to sit in that Place of Honour and to examine who are fittest to be entrusted with the Religion and Peace of  England  and perhaps of all  Europe  '  'Here we are plagu'd with the Impertinence of two  EastIndia  Companies as if the Interest of either Company were to be nam'd in the Day with the  Protestant Religion and the publick Peace  or as if they who are fit to be Representatives of the People in the great Matters of Peace and War Leagues and Alliances of Neighbours Succession of Crowns and Protection of the Protestant Religion should not  be capable of deciding the petty Controversy in Trade between two Rival Companies'  'The Grand Question ask'd now when your Vote is requir'd for a ParliamentMan is not as it ought to be Is he a Man of  Sense  of  Religion  of  Honesty  and  Estate  '  'But What Company is he for the New or the Old'  'As this StockJobbing in its own Nature is only a new Invented sort of  Deceptio Visus  a  Legerdemain  in Trade so mix'd with Trick and Cheat that 'twould puzzle a good  Logician  to make it out by  Syllogism  So nothing can be more Fatal in  England  to our present Constitution and which in time may be so to our Liberty and Religion than to have the Interests of Elections Jobb'd upon Exchange for Money and Transferr'd like  EastIndia  Stock for those who bid most'  'By this Method the Country Gentlemen may sit at home and only Corresponding with the Brokers at  Jonathan  's and  Garway  's as the Prizes Rise or Fall may dispose of their Interests in the Towns they can Govern at as good a rate as they can'  'The Citizens or such who have their several Companies and Interest to Serve will ease themselves of the Expence of Travelling with the fine borrow'd Equipages before mentioned and only go to Market in  ExchangeAlley  and Buy an Election as the  StockJobber  and they shall agree which Election shall be manag'd by the Country Gentleman who is to have his Bargain no Purchase no Pay and is to go thro' with it or else he gets none of the Money'  'Elections of Parliamentmen are in a hopeful way and Parliaments themselves are in a hopeful way by this concise Method of Practice to come under the absolute manages ment of a few Hands and no doubt things will go on accordingly'  'Banks and Stocks may be lay'd up and employ'd in a short time for the purchasing the Interest of Gentlemen and our Gentry being willing to get a Penny in an  Honestway  as we say will but too often sell their Interests and their Country too especially such Gentlemen whose Estates are reduc'd to an occasion for it'  'The  StockJobbers  who care not a Farthing which Side gets the better but make a Prey of them both have set up this new Trade of Jobbing for Elections And that the way of their Proceeding may be a little plainer understood We desire you to read the Copy of a Letter come down last Post to a worthy Gentleman in our Country from a Friend of his plying in or near  ExchangeAlley  concerning this Matter'  SIR  THE Elections for a New Parliament being begun almost every where I doubt not but the Time is fixt at your Town of I know you have the Absolute Power of the Inhabitants there and can put in whom you please and finding by your last you purpose to Decline it your Self I am to inform you that a very Honest Gentleman of my Acquaintance being an Eminent Merchant here wou'd think himself very much Oblig'd if you wou'd use your Interest in his behalf upon your Grant whereof I have an Order to Present you with a Thousand Guineas to buy my Lady  He is ready to come down at your first Summons in a very good Equipage Pray dispatch your Mind per the Bearer to  Your humble Servant  To the Honourable Sir  A B C D  Bar  Postcript  '  IF Sir  E F G H  will dispose of his Interest in the Town of I can help him to very good Terms  '  'Now tho' the worthy Gentleman to whom this Proposal was made rejected it with Disdain yet the Attempt is made very Plain in the Case'  'And we are inform'd that the Number of Members come down into the Countries on such Accounts are incredible'  'Wherefore we think it very needful to publish our Resentments at such a Practice and to protest against it in this our Honest  Plea  as an indirect wicked and pernicious Practice and which may be of very ill consequence to the Nation'  'If  StockJobbing  of Elections be the first step in all probability  StockJobbing  of Votes will be the second for he that will give a Thousand Pounds or more only for a power to Vote expects to get something by Voting or gives away his Money for nothing'  'What shall we say then if a League of Confederacy shou'd be made between our  ParliamentSolicitors  and our  StockJobbing Brokers  two sort of People equally mercenary and Deceitful'  'We desire to know whether 'twould not be more fatal to  England  than the New War with  Spain  which all  Europe  seems to be so much disturb'd at'  'To all Men whose Eyes are to be open'd with Reason and Argument it shou'd be enough to fill them with abhorrence to think that the Scandalous Mechanick Upstart Mi+stery of Jobbroking should thus grow upon the Nation that ever the  English  Nation shou'd suffer themselves to be Impos'd on by the New invented ways of a few Needy Mercinaries who can turn all Trade into a Lottery and make the  Exchange  a Gaming  Table A thing which like the Imaginary Coins of Foreign Nations have no reality in themselves but are plac'd as things which stand to be Calculated and reduc'd into Value a Trade made up of Sharp and Trick and Manag'd with Impudence and Banter'  'That Six or Eight Men shall Combine together and by pretended Buying or Selling among themselves raise or sink the Stock of the  E India  Company to what extravagant pitch of Price they will so to wheedle others sometimes to Buy sometimes to Sell as their occasions require and with so little regard to Intrinsick Value or the Circumstances of the Company that when the Company has a Loss Stock shall Rise when a great Sale or a Rich Ship arriv'd it shall Fall Sometimes run the Stock down to  l  other times up to  l  and by this Method Buy and Sell so much that 'tis thought there are few of the Noted StockJobbers but what have bought and sold more Stock than both the Companies possess'  'Thus let them Jobb Trick and Cheat one another and let them be bubbl'd by them that knows no better but for God's sake Gentlemen don't let the Important Affairs  of the State come under their wicked clutches'  'Don't let them prepare our Acts of Parliament and then chuse Members to Vote for them If Fate and  Popish  Confederacies and Union of  Popish  Powers abroad threaten us let us alone to struggle with them and have Fair Law and Honourable Conditions for it but to be Bought and Sold to have our Elections of Members and our Laws Liberties and Estates Stockjobb'd away is intolerable'  I said above that the Parliament put a Check to this Practice afterwards by several Acts and the late Act for suspending the Triennial Bill has at present laid it a ssep but how far the Practice may revive when a new Election shall come on who knows Never was more Knaves or more Money in  ExchangeAlley  and never more needy Gentlemen to assist the Purchasers How necessary 'tis to prevent them let any one judge  Besides what shall we say to the encroaching Nature of Immortal Avarice Has not that eminent  C  of whom at large above Stockjobb'd the very Publick it self as I may  say and the very House of Commons for jobbing their Funds before they are laid Stockjobbing their Tickets before the Lottery was found may in some Sense be call'd Stockjobbing the House If then they will even before the Members Faces jobb their depending Acts and that too before they are pass'd shall we doubt but they will Stockjobb the Elections of another Parliament when this is gone Home  It is evident that at present not being able to avoid preying upon their Country they have been tampering Abroad Foreign Alarms is the present Commodity at Market Choice of Members may be the next till in time by Strength of Money they may  Stockjobb  Religion Property Constitution and Succession for nothing can come amiss to them if they can but get Money by it for if the same Avarice reigns among them that 'tis evident is their Guide now they would with the same Facility jobb for the Nation and without any Scruple make a Transfer of King  George  and his Crown for a half  per Cent  upon the Value to whoever bids the Money  There was a Book publish'd some Years ago and when the Stockjobbing People were thought  as willing yet not quite so daring or so cunning as they are now it was Entitled  The Villany of the Stockjobbers  Indeed it set them out in their true Colours and for some time gave them a little Shock for the Truth was they jobb'd King  William  and the Government at that Time at such a Rate that in spight of the Invincible Valour and Resolution of the Soldiery in spight of the most Glorious Prince and most Vigilant General the World had ever seen yet the Enemy gain'd upon us every Year the Funds were run down the Credit jobb'd away in  ExchangeAlley  the King and his Troops devoured by Mechanicks and sold to Usury Tallies lay bundled up like  Bath  Faggots in the Hands of Brokers and Stockjobbers the Parliament gave Taxes laid Funds but the Loans were at the Mercy of those Men and they shew'd their Mercy indeed by devouring the King and the Army the Parliament and indeed the whole Nation bringing that Great Prince sometimes to that Exigence thro' unexpressible Extortions that were put upon him that he has even gone into the Field without his Equipage nay even without his Army the Regiments have been uncloathed when the King has been in the Field and the willing brave  English  Spirits eager to honour their Country and follow such a King have marched  even to Battle without either Stockings or Shoes while his Servants have been every Day working in  ExchangeAlley  to get his own Money of the StockJobbers even after all the horrible Demands of Discount have been allowed and at last scarce  per Cent  of the Money granted by Parliament has come into the Exchequer and that late too late for that Service and by Driblets till the King has been tir'd with the Delay and been even ready to give up the Cause  We have just now had a Test of their Cunning on the Subject of the Invasion These were the Men that made the first Advantage of the News immediately those that were to put Stock upon any Man at a high Price tender 'd it the Accepters forc'd by the Demand call in their Money on every Hand pay the Difference the Price falls a general Run upon the Bank follows and Stockjobbing began it  Say this was no Design yet if every Alarm of the Foolish or the Timerous or the False is capable to set the Humour afloat by the Agency of  ExchangeAlley  then  ExchangeAlley  is as dangerous to the Publick Safety as a Magazine of Gunpowder is to a populous City  But if it be by Design then whenever the Pretender is to be pawn'd upon us by any Foreign Power that can but talk of lending or Men our Publick Credit is at his Mercy by the Agency of  ExchangeAlley  and the Brokers  The Story of the Invasion from  Spain  we hope is now over Indeed at the Worst I saw no such Reason to be surprized to that Degree as was the Case here Let us look back and see what Injury to the Publick has the very Rumour been What Damage to Credit What Stop to Trade What Interruption to our General Commerce besides sinking above a Million Sterling upon our Estates and every Farthing of this is occasion'd by the  Stockjobbers  and in the Consequences of their Contrivances and by no other Means for as to the Design of an Invasion or that they resolv'd to come hither at all tho' we have evident Proofs of that because some of them have been actually landed yet we cannot yet resolve the Question positively whether it was ever worth our being so much alarm'd as we have been in  ExchangeAlley  Even this Way it appears that these StockJobbers are dangerous to the Peace since 'tis in their Power to set a Rate whenever they please not only upon private Estates but  even upon the whole Nation and in that Capacity it is to be hoped the Parliament who have hitherto redress'd the Publick Grievances will take care of these People in particular and deliver the Publick from such a Set of Men as are more fatal to them than a Midnight Fire more dangerous than an Enemy Embark'd nay I had almost said than an Enemy Landed  For in a word these Men take upon them to put a Standard upon our Fears and we are to ask them when Intelligence comes from Abroad whether any thing be to be slighted or apprehended every publick Piece of News every Menace of the Nation's Enemies is to receive its Weight from them and the Price of Stocks is the Rule by which we are to guide our Judgment in Publick Affairs by which we are either to hope or to fear when any thing amiss present it self to our View  Is this an Advantage fit to be put into the Hand of a Subject Are the King's Affairs to go up and down as they please and the Credit of his Majesty's Councils rise and fall as these Men shall please to value them This would be making them Kings and making the King Subject to the Caprice of their private Interst  his Affairs be liable to be rated in  ExchangeAlley  and to be run down as they pleased an Article which as the  Roman  Pontiff in the first Politicks of the Church made all the Kings of the Earth become Pensioners to the Priests so it would make all the Kings of  Britain  Pensioners to  ExchangeAlley  It must be confess'd it looks as if this were the present View in the Manner which StockJobbing now goes on and there are more Mischiefs in it than perhaps we are aware of the Extremes either way seem dangerous enough for Example  If one way the StockJobbers manage the Publick they scandalously subject the Government the Ministers of State the Publick Credit nay even the Elections of Parliament to their Orders So if a Government should come absolutely to get the Management of the StockJobbers it might be many Ways fatal to the Peoples Interest and indeed put the PurseStrings of the Nation so much into the Hands of a Ministry that if they did not at any time command the general Treasure and be able to raise what Money they pleas'd without a Parliament they would be able to add what Value they pleased to the Funds given raise  them when they pleas'd to draw Money in and sink them when they pleased to issue Money out That in a word the Rate of Stocks should be settled every Day in the  Exchequer  and tho' they might not be said to stand no more in need of Parliaments it would be most certain that they would not stand in so much need of Parliaments as they used to do and as it is convenient for us they should do  I must run out a great Length in the Enumeration of the Mischief to the Liberty of  GreatBritain  which might attend such a Thing as this and tho' at present it may be objected that it is unreasonable and entirely needless because we are under a King that stands in need of no Artifices and is too just to attempt any Encroachment on the Liberties of his People and a Ministry who we have reason to hope are above taking any such mean Steps yet if ever a Time shall come again when every Politick Step shall be enquired after to bring Grist to the Publick Mill and every way that can be found practicable shall be thought justifiable then let you Citizens of  London  have a care of a BearskinCourt and a StockJobbing Ministry when  ExchangeAlley  shall be transpos'd to the  Exchequer  and Statesmen shall make a Property of the Brokers  This is indeed a Thing remote and as I say above there is no Danger of its happening in this Reign so it may never happen at all But as I also say without the least Reflection upon our present Government that such a Time may come and such a Thing may happen so I affirm the State of Things ought forthwith to be annihilated if possible which is but in its Nature capable of being thus perverted and we ought not to leave our Posterity in a Condition to be devoured by such Caterpillars if it be in our Power to prevent it  Why may not any collected Stock of Money such as that we have mention'd before to be in the Management of the  BirchinLane Company  be manag'd in the Hands of Courtiers as well as of Citizens Ministers of State as well as Inhabitants of  Hackney  and to how many more unlucky Purposes may such Men apply that Power These Men indeed proceed with Trick and Cunning to amass great Estates and to enrich themselves and their Families out of the Spoils of the People their Neighbours  c  and in this we think they cannot have too much of our just Satyr bestow'd upon them but if this Engine of Jobbing should once come into the Hands of Ministers of State if a degenerated Government should come to use it as such a  Government may be supposed to be able to do what Mischiefs may they not bring upon the Nation And what may they not be able to do if their Designs are but wicked enough to push them on  It would be hard to say to what Length this Jobbing Trade might be extended especially whereby the Advantage of a punctual Management the publick Credit has so far gain'd upon the People as to bring the Rate of Funds and Stocks to exceed the Intrinsick Value and to keep upon an Advance What may not a Government who has the Command of Money do in the particular Art of Screwing up or Screwing down the publick Interests and Securities  'Tis a copious Subject our  ExchangeAlley  Men understand it well enough and if they were put to give their Opinions and had Honesty enough to speak the Truth against their Interest they would acknowledge their Trade is capable of ruining ten Nations if it was carried on to the full Extent of it  While these Sheets were at the Press we had another little Test of their Knavery to the Publick and it is not at all owing to them that the Thing run no further the contrary Winds  and Storms  c  had disappointed the King's Enemies and the  Spanish  Fleet was driven back to  Spain  in a shatter'd and defeated Condition as appears by the Publick Account of those Things But in the Interval of this News came an Account on the other Hand that some of the Party were arriv'd in  Scotland  that they had beat it up notwithstanding all the Opposition of Nature the Hindrances of Winds and Seas immediately Stocks fell Two  per Cent  nor did the good News of the Defeated return of the rest animate these Men to keep up the Interest by which it appears that they are acted more by the bad Principle than by the good that they choose rather to do Evil than to do Good that they sink faster than they rise and are willinger to do Harm than Good to the Government  From whence I infer that the Government looking upon them as they really are rather Enemies than Friends to the General Interest should rather encline to root them out than preserve them  AMEN  FINIS
