 HONORIA OR THE DAY OF ALL SOULS A POEM WITH OTHER POETICAL PIECES  LONDON PRINTED for J ROBSON BOOKSELLER IN NEW BOND STREET M DCC LXXXII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Scene of the following little Poem is supposed to be in the great church of St Ambrose at Milan the second of November on which day the most solemn office is performed for the repose of the Dead  HONORIA  'YE hallow'd bells whose voices thro' the air  'The awful summons of affliction bear  'Ye slowlywaving banners of the dead  'That o'er yon altar your dark horrours spread  'Ye curtain'd lamps whose mitigated ray  'Casts round the fane a pale reluctant day  'Ye walls ye shrines by melancholy drest  'Well do ye suit the fashion of my breast  'Have I not lost what language can't unfold  'The form of valour cast in beauty's mould  'Th' intrepid youth the path of battle tried  'And foremost in the hour of peril died  'Nor was I present to bewail his fate  'With pity's lenient voice to soothe his state  'To watch his looks to read while death stood by  'The last expression of his parting eye  'But other duties other cares impend  'Cares that beyond the mournful grave extend  'Now now I view conven'd the pious train  'Whose bosom sorrows at another's pain  'While recollection pleasingly severe  'Wakes for the awful dead the silent tear  And pictures as to each her sway extends  'The sacred forms of lovers parents friends  'Now Charity a fiery seraph stands  'Beside yon altar with uplifted hands  'Yet can this high solemnity of grief  'Yield to the youth I love the wish'd relief  'These rites of deathAh what can they avail  'Honorius died beyond the hallow'd pale  'Plung'd in the gulph of feardistressful state  'My anxious mind dares not enquire his fate  'Yet why despond cou'd one slight errour roll  'A flood of poison o'er the healthful soul  'Had not thy virtues full sufficing pow'r  'To clear thee in the dread recording hour  'Did they before the judge abash'd remain  'Did they weak advocates all plead in vain  'By love by piety by reason taught  'My soul revolts at the blaspheming thought  'Sure in the breast to pure religion true  'Where virtue's templed God is templed too  'Then while th' august procession moves along  'Midst swelling organs and the pomp of song  'While the dread chaunt still true to Nature's laws  'Is deepen'd by the terrourbreathing pause  'While 'midst encircling clouds of incense lost  'The trembling priest upholds the  sacred host    'Amid these scenes shall I forget my suit  'Amid these scenes shall I alone be mute  'Nor to the footsteps of the throne above  'Breathe the warm requiem to the youth I love  'Now silence reigns along the gloomy fane  'And wraps in dread repose the pausing strain  'When next it bursts my humble voice I'll join  'Disclose my trembling wish at mercy's shrine  'Unveil my anguish to the throne above  'And sigh the requiem to the youth I love  'Does fancy mock me with a false delight  'Or does some hallow'd vision cheer my sight  'Methinks emerging from the gloom below  'Th' immortal spirits leave the house of woe  'Inshrin'd in glory's beams they reach the sky  'While choral songs of triumph burst from high  'See at the voice of my accorded pray'r  'The radiant youth ascend the fields of air  'BeholdHe mounts unutterably bright  'Cloath'd in the sunrobe of unfading light  'Applauding seraphs hail him on his way  'And lead him to the gates of everlasting day'  THE SOLDIER's FAREWELL ON THE EVE OF A BATTLE  NIGHT expecting the dread morrow  Hover'd o'er the martial train  Beauteous Alice led by sorrow  Hurried to the silent plain  'Give the watchword the guard utter'd  'Loudly from his destin'd place  'Lo 'tis I fair Alice mutter'd  'Hast'ning to his fond embrace  'Ever beauteous faithful ever  'Quick the gallant youth rejoin'd  'Cruel death can only sever  'Hearts in love's strong links entwin'd  'Soon shall we be torn asunder  'Therefore welcome art thou come  'Till morn wakes the battle's thunder  'Rest thee on that broken drum'  She sat down in mind reviewing  Ills the morning might behold  Tears still other tears pursuing  Down her cheek in silence roll'd  Thoughts to other thoughts succeeding  O'er her mind incessant flow  She like meekness inlybleeding  Broods in stillness o'er her woe  'Wherefore Alice dost thou ponder  'Evils that are fancy's brood  'Sure our parting might be fonder  'Than beseems this silent mood  'Yet continue still to ponder  'Things thy voice wants pow'r to say  'Thy dumb grief to me seems fonder  'Than words deck'd in bright array'  She replied her tears still gushing  'What avails it to be brave  'Thou amidst the battle rushing  'Here perchance may meet a grave  'Shou'd'st thou perish in the action  'Where's the peace to soothe my care  'All my life wou'd be distraction  'Madness wailing and despair  'Still thou wert of gentlest carriage  'Still affectionately true  'And a lover still in marriage  'And a friend and parent too  'Cheer thee cheer thee best of women  'Trust to the great Pow'r above  'When I rush amidst the foemen  'Heav'n may think on her I love  'Saving is the miser's pleasure  'Spending is the soldier's thrift  'Take this guinea all my treasure  'Take it as a parting gift  'Here end we this mournful meeting  'Catch from my lips this fond sigh  'If this be our last last greeting  'Know that I was born to die  'See the dayspring gilds the streamers  'Waving o'er the martial train  'Now the hoarse drum wakes the dreamers  'Ne'er perchance to dream again  'Hark I hear the trumpet's clangor  'Bid the British youth excell  'Now now glows the battle's anger  'Lovely Alice fare thee well'  TO THE MEMORY OF A YOUNG LADY  ENDOW'D with all that Fortune cou'd bestow  With brilliancy of wit and beauty's glow  Francisca rising to her fifteenth year  Stood mid the virgin train without a peer  Her conscious bosom throbb'd to virtue warm  While diffidence still heighten'd ev'ry charm  But Heav'n's decree forbad this beauty's queen  To act her part thro' beauty's shortliv'd scene  A gradual illness on her figure prey'd  And slowly slowly sunk the fading maid  Torn from each wish to which her youth aspir'd  Unfearinguncomplainingshe expir'd  Thus some faint lily to its motherground  In silence fallswhile spring is blooming round  INSCRIPTION INTENDED FOR AN OLD THATCHED CHURCH  FAR from the splendour of a costly fane  My low roof canopies the humble train  Deep in my vaults divorc'd from human woes  The lifeworn weary villagers repose  When at my altar kneels the hamlet fair  And to her God unveils her bosom'd care  Or does the herdsman bend with grief distrest  Kind comfort steals upon their lighten'd breast  Here too Religion weaves with viewless hand  For spotless village hearts the nuptial band  And twines with many a charm the holy braid  That joins the lab'rer and the nutbrown maid  ON THE DEATH of TWO FAVOURITE BIRDS  INVOLV'D in flame and suffocating breath  A hapless bird was doom'd to sudden death  The female touch'd at his uncommon fate  Survey'd the form of her disfigur'd mate  With drooping head and shiv'ring wings she stood  In all the agony of widowhood  At length to grief's severest pow'r a prey  She droptand sigh'd her little soul away  Ye wedded birds tho' rigid be your doom  Yet Anna  Miss Ann Beauclerk  watches at your early tomb  For you her flowing pity bursts restraint  Your dirge is utter'd in her soft complaint  Your elegy without the poet's art  Is writ by sorrow on the purest heart  THE OAK  MARK well yon tree that shades the neighb'ring plain  And looks the ancestor of this domain  Beneath the slowlywaving branches hoar  Meet temple for a vow this morn I swore  To rear solicitous bright Friendship's flow'r  And fence it from bleak Time's destructive pow'r  To guard with holy care the tender frame  And on the fragrant leaves inscribe his name  Whose presence gilds with smiles this mild retreat  Within whose breast the virtues love to meet  Who woos coy science to frequent his scene  And bids good nature gambol o'er the green  I spoke the wordThe solemn branches bow'd  As conscious of the sacred deed I vow'd  SENSIBILITY  CELESTIAL spring to Nature's favourites giv'n  Fed by the dews that bathe the flow'rs of heav'n  From the pure crystal of thy fountain flow  The tears that trickle o'er another's woe  The silent drop that calms our own distress  The gush of rapture at a friend's success  Thine the soft show'rs down beauty's breast that steal  To soothe the heartwounds they can never heal  Thine too the tears of ecstasy that roll  When genius whispers to the list'ning soul  And thine the hallow'd flood that drowns the eye  When warm Religion lifts the thought on high  MAY the th MISS BOYLE's BIRTH DAY  OH shade of Hanb'ry  Sir Charles Hanbury Williams  from thy seat bestow  One transient aspect on this scene below  This youngest flow'ret of thy bow'r survey  Who meekly rears her head to welcome May  And looks the lily of the primros'd dale  Just breaking thro' its green o'ermantling veil  Behold the Mother  The Honourable Mrs Walsingham  prompt with skill refin'd  To watch the dawning of a Daughter's mind  With those clear rays which her bright noon adorn  She streaks and beautifies her pupil's morn  Foe to th' enamel'd rules of Stanhope's art  With Nature's sentiments she feeds the heart  Whose strong ascendant in due time display'd  Shall as a buckler shield the tender maid  When call'd to enter on her fate's career  Thro' life's uncertain voyage she shall steer  Methinks I now behold that future day  When the light galley shall the fair convey  I see this artless Cleopatra glide  Hope at her helm and Virtue at her side  Firm as her Father to repel the foe  To meet when Heav'n ordains th' assailing woe  Ah new adventurer on the sea of life  May'st thou ne'er meet the waves' insulting strife  Ne'er may thy bark amidst the whirlwind's roar  Dash its young bosom on the bulging shore  May halcyon stillness brood along the deep  And treach'rous Syrens in some cavern sleep  Allur'd by smiling skies may playful gales  Toy round thy mast and flutter in the sails  EnoughTo merriment the hours devote  Each accent tune to laughing pleasure's note  For thee the darling of these humble lays  Whose early merit wakes the voice of praise  From the bright date of this recorded day  Thou shalt be styled the Little Queen of May  THE END  LATELY PUBLISHED THE ANCIENT ENGLISH WAKE Price One Shilling and Sixpence  Also in One Volume Octavo  Price Three Shillings POEMS BY MR JERNINGHAM THE
