In Greek  In Latin  Avis tarda  or Slow bird and from this the Italian name  starda  is evidently formed And may not the old French term  bistarde  and the English  bustard  be only a corruption of  avis tarda  The German appellation  trappe  is of the same origin with the English verb  to trape  and alludes to its heavy sluggish pace  tarda  All the Naturalists  WHEN we undertake to clear up the history of an animal our first business is to examine with a critical eye the various names which it has received in different languages and at different times and to endeavour as much as possible to distinguish the several species to which these have been applied This is the only way of reaping benefit from the knowledge acquired by the ancients and of connecting it usefully with the discoveries of the moderns and consequently the only way of  making real progress in Natural History For how could I shall not say one man but a whole generation or even a succession of generations complete the history of a single animal Almost all animals fear man and fly from him The character of supremacy which the Most High has stamped on his brow inspires them with terror rather than respect They shrink from his eye they suspect his snares and they dread his arms Even those that are able to defend themselves by their strength or resist an attack by their bulk retire into deserts for which we disdain to contend or entrench in the fastnesses of impenetrable forests The small animals secure in escaping our vigilance by their diminutive size and emboldened by their weakness itself live in the midst of us in spite of our endeavours to extirpate them feed at our expence and sometimes even prey on our own substance though not on that account better known Among the great number of intermediate classes included between these two extremes some dig for themselves subterraneous retreats some plunge into the depths of the ocean others disappear in the aërial expanse but all of them fly from the tyrant of Nature How then is it possible in a short space of time to view all the animals in all the situations necessary for discovering completely their instincts their dispositions their habits and in a word the principal facts of  their history It is well to collect at great expence numerous series of these animals to preserve carefully their external coat to add their skeletons artfully combined to give each individual its proper attitude and native air but all this only represents the surface of nature dead and inanimate If some monarch would adopt the truly grand idea of contributing to the advancement of this beautiful part of science by forming vast collections and assembling under the eyes of observers a great number of living species we should still acquire but imperfect ideas Most animals intimidated by the presence of man teased with his observations and further tormented by the uneasiness inseparable from captivity would exhibit manners that are altered constrained and hardly worthy the attention of a philosopher who admires Nature only when free independent or even wild  To study animals with accuracy then we ought to observe them in the savage state to accompany them into the retreats which they have chosen for themselves to follow them into the deep caverns to attend them on the frightful precipices where they enjoy unbounded liberty Nor should we be perceived by them while we contemplate their habits for the eye of an observer if not concealed from their view would in some measure disconcert their motions But there are few animals especially of the winged tribe that  can be thus surveyed it requires a succession of ages and innumerable fortunate occurrences to ascertain all the necessary facts and it needs the closest attention to refer each observation to its proper subject and consequently to avoid the confusion of names Without these precautions the most profound ignorance should be preferred to a pretended science which at bottom is but a web of uncertainty and error The Great Bustard is a striking instance The Greeks named it  Otis  and Aristotle mentions it by this name in three places  Hist Anim lib ii lib v lib ix  and his description perfectly agrees with our Great Bustard But the Latins deceived probably by the resemblance of the words confounded it with  otus  which is a nocturnal bird Pliny after properly saying that the bird named  otis  by the Greeks is called  avis tarda  in Spain which character applies to the Great Bustard subjoins that its flesh has a rank taste  Pliny's words are  Proximae eis sunt quas Hispania aves tardas appellat Graecia otidas damnatas cibis Emissa enim ossibus medulla odoris taedium sequitur  Next to these he was speaking of the black grous we may rank what are termed in Spain the  slow birds  and in Greece the  otides  which are rejected as food for as soon as the marrow is detached from the bones a loathsome smell is exhaled  Lib x  which agrees with the  otus  according to Aristotle and to fact but has no reference to the Great Bustard and this mistake can be the more easily supposed since  Pliny in the following chapter evidently confounds the  otis  with the  otus  that is the Great Bustard with the Eared Owl  Alexander the Myndian as quoted by Athenaeus  Hist Nat lib ix  falls into the same error ascribing to the  otus  or  otis  which he takes for the same individual bird the circumstance of having hairy feet which is true of the  otus  or eared owl in which as in most of the nocturnal birds the legs and feet are covered with hair or rather clothed to the nails with feathers that are parted into threads and not to the  otis  which is our Great Bustard and in which not only the foot but the lower part of the leg immediately over the tarsus is quite bare  Sigismundus Gelenius having found in Hesychius the name of  the meaning of which was not ascertained has bestowed it from mere fancy on the Great Bustard  In Lexico Symphono  and since his time Maehring and Brisson have without assigning their reasons applied it to the Dodo  The modern Jews have arbitrarily taken the Hebrew word  anapha  which denoted a kind of kite to signify the Great Bustard  Paul Faugius  apud Gesnerum    Brisson gives the word  for the Greek name of the Great Bustard according to Belon but afterwards adopts  from Aldrovandus He does not advert that  is the accusative  of  and consequently is the same individual name It is just as if he had said that some call it  tarda  and others  tardam  Schwenckfeld pretends that the  tetrix  noticed by Aristotle  Hist Anim lib vi  and which was the  ourax  of the Athenians is also our Great Bustard But what little Aristotle mentions with respect to the  tetrix  does not apply to the Great Bustard The  tetrix  builds its nest among low plants and the Great Bustard among growing corn which Aristotle probably did not mean to include in the general expression "low plants" Secondly This great philosopher explains himself in this manner  The birds which fly little as the partridges and quails do not construct nests but lay their eggs on the ground on small heaps of leaves which they gather the lark and  tetrix  do the same  The least attention to this passage will convince us that it alludes to those tardy birds which fly little and that the lark and  tetrix  are mentioned because they nestle on the ground like these though apparently more agile since the lark is of the number If Aristotle had meant our Great Bustard by the name  tetrix  he would certainly have ranged it as a sluggish bird with the partridges and quails and not with the larks which from their lofty flight have merited according to Schwenckfeld himself the epithet of  coelipetes  Longolius  Dialog de Avibus  and Gesner  De Avibus lib iii  are both of opinion that the  tetrax  of the poet Nemesianus is nothing but the Great Bustard and it must be allowed that these nearly resemble each other in size  " Tarpeiae est custos arcis non corpore major  The sentinel of the Tarpeian rock the goose is not larger  and in plumage  " Persimiles cineri dorsum maculosaque terga  " Insiciunt pullae cacabantis imagine notae  Ashcoloured marks stain the shoulders perhaps the neck and speckled back as in the partridge  But these analogies are not sufficient to fix the identity of the species and the less so as I find by comparing what Nemesianus relates of his  tetrax  with what we know of our Great Bustard two distinct differences The  tetrax  appears tame from stupidity and heedlessly falls into the very snare which has been laid for it  " Cum pedicas necti sibi contemplaverit adstans  " Immemor ipse sui tamen in dispendia currit  but the Great Bustard is intimidated at the approach of man and quickly flies out of his view  Neque hominem ad se appropinquantem sustinent sed cum eum longinquo cernunt statim fugam capessunt  WILLOUGHBY  The  tetrax  built its nest at the foot of the Apennines whereas Aldrovandus who was an Italian assures us positively that the Great Bustards are never seen in Italy except when they are driven thither by a gust of wind  Italia nostra has aves nisi forte ventorum turbine advectas non habet  ALDROV tom ii  It is  true indeed that Willoughby suspects they are not rare in that country because when he passed through Modena he saw one in the market But I should conceive that a single Great Bustard brought to market in such a city as Modena agrees better with the assertion of Aldrovandus than with the conjecture of Willoughby  Perrault imputes to Aristotle the story that the  otis  of Scythia does not sit on its eggs like other birds but covers them with a hare's or fox's skin concealing them at the root of a tree on whose top it is perched Yet Aristotle does not apply this at all to the Great Bustard but only to a certain Scythian bird probably a bird of prey which could tear off the skins of hares and foxes and which was only of the size of a Bustard as Pliny and Gaza  In Scythis avis magnitudine  otidis  binos parit in leporina pelle semper in cacuminibus ramorum suspensa  Hist Nat  lib x  translate it besides however little Aristotle was acquainted with the Bustard he could not fail to know that it never perches  The compounded name  trappgantz  which the Germans have bestowed on this bird has given rise to other mistakes  Trappen  signifies to walk and custom has connected to its derivatives the accessory idea of tardiness in the same manner as in the case of the Latin word  gradatim  and the Italian  andante  and hence the epithet  trapp  can with propriety be applied to the Bustard which when not pursued walks slowly  and heavily The application would still be just though we did not affix the notion of sluggishness since to describe a bird with the habit of walking contains an implication that it seldom flies  With respect to the word  gantz  it may admit of a double acceptation Here it ought perhaps to be written as I have done with a final  z  and then it signifies  much  and marks the superlative but if it be written  gans  with an  s  it means a  goose  Some authors taking the word in the last sense have translated it by the Latin  anser trappus  and misled by this interpretation have alleged that the Great Bustard is an aquatic bird which delights in marshes  Sylvaticus  apud Gesnerum  Aldrovandus himself though informed by a Dutch physician of the ambiguity of the word and though inclined to give it the same meaning that I do has yet made Belon say in his Latin translation of the passage that the Great Bustard is fond of wet situations and yet that naturalist affirms directly the contrary  The nature of the Bustard is to live in spacious plains like the ostrich avoiding water above all things It does not haunt wet places since it remains among the ridges after rain or it visits the pools only to drink  This error has produced another and they have applied the name of  Great Bustard  to a bird that is really aquatic to the black and white goose which is found in Canada  and in several parts of North America  Charlevoix Lade Theodat and the Lettres Edifiantes  It was undoubtedly from the same mistake that Gesner received the figure of a palmipede bird from Scotland by the name of  Gustard  which is in that country the real name of Great Bustard  Gustard  in old Scotch is the same it would seem as  bustard  and was probably a corruption of that word  and which Gesner derives from  tarde  slow and  guss  or  goose  which has the same signification in Dutch and English Here then is a bird which is entirely confined to the land converted into an aquatic bird and this strange metamorphosis has been occasioned by the equivocal meaning of words alone Those who have ventured to justify or palliate the name of  anser trappus  or  trapp gans  have been obliged to say some of them that these fly in flocks like the geese  Longolius  apud Gesnerum  others that they are of the same size  Frisch  as if these circumstances were sufficient to discriminate a species For the same reason the vultures and woodgrous might be classed together But I need not insist on an absurdity I hasten to close this list of errors and this criticism which may already be considered as rather tedious though I am convinced that it is necessary  Belon pretends that the  tetras alter  of Pliny  Hist Nat lib x  was the Great Bustard but there is no foundation for this opinion since Pliny mentions the  avis tarda  in the same place It is true that Belon supporting this error by another asserts that the  avis tarda  of the Spaniards and the  otis  of the Greeks mean the owl But he ought to have proved That the Great Bustard inhabits lofty mountains as Pliny affirms of the  tetras alter    gignunt eos Alpes  which contradicts the assertions of all the naturalists with respect to this bird except Barrere  Barrere admits two sorts of Bustards in Europe but he is the only person that has represented them as inhabitants of the Pyrennees The author was born at Roussillon and referred to his native mountains all the animals bred in the adjacent provinces  That the owl and not the Great Bustard has really been known in Spain by the name of  avis tarda  and in Greek by that of  otis  but this is totally inadmissible as it is contrary to the testimony of almost all writers What may have deceived Belon is that Pliny mentions his second  tetras  as one of the largest birds after the ostrich which according to Belon is true only of the Great Bustard But we shall find in the sequel that the wood grous sometimes exceeds in bulk the Great Bustard and since Pliny subjoins that the flesh of this  avis tarda  has a rank taste which corresponds much better with the  otus  the longeared owl than with the  otis  the Great Bustard Belon should have suspected that the naturalist confounds here the  otis  with the  otus  as I have before remarked and that he ascribes to the same species the qualities of two species widely different from each  other though expressed in his compilation by nearly similar names but he was not entitled to conclude that the  avis tarda  was really the longeared owl  The same Belon would believe that his  aedicnemus  was an  ostardeau  or  stonecurlew  and indeed this bird has only three toes all of them anterior like the Great Bustard but its bill is widely different the tarsus thicker the neck shorter and it seems to have more analogy to the plover than to the Great Bustard But we shall afterwards consider this subject more fully  Finally We may observe that some authors deceived probably by the resemblance of words have confounded the name  starda  which in Italian signifies a bustard with the name  starna  which in the same language signifies a partridge  From these discussions we may conclude that the  otis  of the Greeks and not  otus  is our Great Bustard that the name  has been applied to it from inattention as it has afterwards been to the dodo that that of  anapha  given by the modern Jews belonged formerly to the kite that the  avis tarda  of Pliny or rather of the Spaniards in the time of Pliny was so called on account of its slowness and not as Nyphus would have it because it was late before it was known at Rome  tardus  that it is neither the  tetrix  of Aristotle nor the  tetrax  of the poet Nemesianus nor the Scythian bird mentioned by  Aristotle in his History of Animals nor the  tetras+alter  of Pliny nor an aquatic bird and lastly that it is the  starda  and not the  starna  of the Italians  I shall here collect the various names bestowed on this bird by different authors  Otis    Tarda    Bistarda  Gesn and Charleton  Otis    sive Tarda  Johnston  Otis    seu Tarda avis  Aldrov  Otis  Graecis  Tarda  Isiodoro  Bistarda  Alberto Rzacyski  Otis    Tarda  Sibbaldi Scotia Illustrata Will and Ray  Tarda Recentiorum  Schwen  Tarda  Klein

perceive the importance of this investigation we need only figure in our imaginations the strange and ridiculous idea which a beginner would form of the Great Bustard who had collected indiscriminately and with blind confidence all that has been ascribed to this bird by authors or rather to the different names by which it is  distinguished in their works at one time a diurnal bird at another a nocturnal sometimes an inhabitant of the mountains at other times an inhabitant of the plains sometimes a native of Europe at other times a native of America now a land bird then an aquatic one sometimes granivorous at other times carnivorous sometimes extremely large at other times very small in a word a monster and a chimaera But to discriminate the true qualities it is necessary as we have done to draw a critical comparison between the descriptions of former naturalists  But we have dwelt long enough on words it is now time to proceed to things Gesner exults in being the first who perceived that the Great Bustard might be referred to the gallinaceous class It is true indeed that it resembles this class in its bill and its weight but it differs in its thickness in its legs which have three toes in the shape of its tail in the lower part of its legs being naked in the great aperture of its ears in the beards of feathers which hang under its chin in place of those fleshy membranes with which the gallinaceous tribes are furnished not to mention the difference of the internal structure  Aldrovandus is not more fortunate in his conjectures when he takes the frugivorous eagle mentioned by Aelian  Lib x According to Aelian this eagle was called the  Eagle of Jupiter  It was still more a frugivorous bird than the Bustard which eats earthworms for the eagle destroyed no living creature  for a Bustard because of  its size as if the attribute of magnitude were alone sufficient to constitute the idea of an eagle It appears to me much more probable that Aelian+meant the great vulture which is a bird of prey as well as the eagle and even stronger than the common eagle and which feeds on grain in cases of necessity I opened one of these birds which had been wounded by a shot and which had passed several days in fields of growing corn and I found nothing in the stomach but a green liquor which was evidently halfdigested herbage  We can more easily trace the characters of the Great Bustard in the  tetrax  of Athenaeus which is larger than the biggest cocks and we know that some of these are of a prodigious size in Asia has only three toes on the feet has beards hanging on each side of the bill a mailed plumage a deep cry and whose flesh has the taste like that of the ostrich which resembles the Great Bustard in many other respects  Otis avis fidipes est tribus insistens digitis magnitudine gallinacei majoris capite oblongo oculis amplis rostro acuto linguâ osseâ gracili collo  GESNER  But this  tetrax  cannot be the Great Bustard since according to Athenaeus it is a bird nowhere mentioned in the writings of Aristotle whereas this philosopher speaks of the Great Bustard in several places  We might also suspect with Perrault that those partridges of India mentioned by Strabo as equal to the goose in size are a species of Bustards  The male is distinguished from the female by the colours of its plumage which are differently distributed and more vivid by those beards of feathers which hang from both sides of the neck which it is surprising that Perrault has not mentioned and with which Albin has improperly ornamented the figure of the male by its size which is almost double that of the female a greater disproportion than has been remarked in any other species  Belon and some others who were not acquainted with the cassowary the touyon the dodo or perhaps the great vulture considered the Great Bustard as a bird of the second magnitude and as the largest next to the ostrich But the pelilican which was not known to them is much larger according to Perrault Perhaps however Belon only saw a large Bustard and a small pelican and in that case his mistake will be the same with that of many others the asserting with respect to species what is true but of an individual  Edwards accuses Willoughby of being grossly deceived and of drawing Albin who copied him into the same error in asserting that the Great Bustard is sixty inches in length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail In fact those which I have measured were only three feet and a half and such was that of Brisson The one examined by Edwards was three feet and a half long or three feet nine inches from the point  of the bill to the extremity of the tail In the  British Zoology  it is stated at four English feet The expansion of the wings varies more than one half in different subjects It is reckoned seven feet four inches by Edwards nine feet by the authors of the  British Zoology  and four French feet by Perrault who declares that he never examined the males which are always larger than the females  The weight of this bird admits of considerable variations some are only ten pounds others twentyseven or even thirty But it also varies in its proportions and the individuals of the species seem not all formed after the same model Perrault observed some whose neck was longer and others where it was shorter than the legs some whose bill was more pointed others whose ears were shaded with longer feathers and all of them had a much longer neck and legs than those examined by Gesner and Aldrovandus In the subjects described by Edwards there were on each side of the neck two naked spots of a violet colour but which appeared covered with feathers when the neck was much extended a circumstance that has been remarked by no other observers Finally Klein mentions that the Great Bustards in Poland are not exactly like to those in France and in England and indeed we find by comparing the descriptions some differences in the colours of the plumage in the bill c  In general the Great Bustard is distinguished from the ostrich the cassowary the touyon and the dodo by the circumstance that its wings though little proportioned to its mass are yet able to raise it from the ground and support it for some time in the air whereas these four birds are totally incapable of flying It is also discriminated from all the others by its size its feet which are furnished with three toes that are parted and without membranes its bill refembling that of the dodo its rosecoloured down and the nakedness of the lower part of the feet not indeed by any one of these characters but by the conjunction of them all  The wing consists of twentysix quills according to Brisson and of thirtytwo or thirtythree according to Edwards who perhaps includes those of the false wing The only thing I have to remark on these quills and which can hardly be perceived from the inspecting of the figure is that at the third fourth fifth and sixth feathers of each wing the exterior webs become at once shorter and consequently these quills are narrower where they project from under the coverts  The quills of the tail amount to twenty and the two middle ones differ from all the rest  Perrault  Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire des Animaux  imputes to Belon the asserting that the upper part of the wings of the Great Bustard  is white contrary to the observations of the academicians and to what is commonly remarked in these birds in which there is more white on the belly and the under part of the body and more brown and other colours on the back and wings But I am inclined to think that Belon may be easily justified on this head for he says exactly what the academicians do that  the Great Bustard is white under the belly and below the wings  and when he describes the upper part of the wings as black he undoubtedly means those quills of the wing which are next the body and which are really over the wing when it is closed and the bird in an erect posture But in this sense the assertion is true and conformable to the description of Edwards where the twentysixth quill and those that follow inclusive to the thirtieth are perfectly white  Perrault has made a more accurate observation It is that some feathers of the Great Bustard are covered with down not only at their base but even at their extremity so that the middle of the feather which consists of close connected webs is situated between two parts where there is no down But what is very remarkable the down at the origin of all these feathers except the quills at the end of the wing is of a bright red approaching to rose colour which is a character common to the Great and the Small Bustard The end of the quill is also of the same colour  The foot or rather the  tarsus  and the lower part of the foot which articulates with the tarsus are covered with very small scales those of the toes being long narrow tablets they are all of a grey colour and sheathed with a cuticle which it casts like the slough of a serpent  The nails are short and convex both above and below like those of the eagle termed  Haliaetos  by Belon so that a section perpendicular to their axis would be nearly circular  Salerne was mistaken in asserting that the Great Bustard on the contrary had nails concave below  Under the feet we can perceive behind a callous prominence which serves instead of a heel  Belon and Gesner    The breast is thick and round  Belon  the width of the aperture of the ears is probably subject to variations for Belon found that it was larger in the Great Bustard than in any other land bird  One may easily put the tip of the finger in the passage  BELON  while the academicians could perceive nothing unusual These apertures are concealed under the feathers and internally we discover two ducts one of which may be traced into the bill and the other leads to the brain  In the palate and the lower part of the bill there are situated under the membrane that covers  these parts several glands which open into the cavity of the bill by very distinct mouths  Belon    The tongue is fleshy without and within it is furnished with a cartilaginous nut fixed to the  os hyoïdes  as in most birds its sides are beset with points that consist of a substance intermediate between membrane and cartilage The tongue is hard and terminates in a point but is not forked as alleged by Linnaeus who with others has undoubtedly been misled by a wrong punctuation in Aldrovandus  Lingua serrata utrimque acuta  The  utrimque  ought to be separated from  acuta  and joined to  serrata  It is only a translation of Belon  Sa langue est denteleè de chaque côté pointue et dure par le bout  Its tongue is indented on each side  utrimque  pointed and hard at the tip    Under the tongue appears a kind of sac containing about seven English pints and which Dr Douglas who first discovered it supposes to be a reservoir which the bird fills with water to serve as a supply while it wanders in the midst of those vast and parched plains which it naturally prefers But this singular reservoir is peculiar to the male  Edwards  and I suspect has given rise to a mistake of Aristotle's That great naturalist asserts that the oesophagus of the Great Bustard is wide through its whole length  Hist Anim lib ii cap ult  but the moderns and particularly the academicians have observed  that it enlarges only as it approaches the gizzard  Gesner Aldrovandus and Perrault  Both these assertions which seem to be contradictory may yet be reconciled if we suppose that Aristotle or the observers who were employed to collect the facts for the composition of his History of Animals had mistaken for the oesophagus that bag or reservoir which is really very broad through its whole extent  The true oesophagus where it expands is beset with glands regularly arranged The gizzard which comes next for there is no craw is about four inches long and three inches broad it is as hard as that of ordinary hens which is not owing as in these to the thickness of the fleshy part which is here very thin but to the internal membrane which is extremely hard and thick and folded and interwoven in various directions so as to increase much the bulk of the gizzard  This internal membrane appears not to be continuous but only connected closely to that of the oesophagus Further this is white while the internal membrane of the gizzard is yellow like gold  Perrault partie ii    The length of the intestines is about four feet exclusive of the  caecum  the internal coat of the  ileon  is striped with longitudinal folds and marked at its end with some transverse wrinkles  Ibidem    The two  caeca  take their rise about seven inches from the  anus  and stretch forwards According to Gesner they are unequal in all their dimensions the narrowest is the longest and bears to the others the ratio of six to five Perrault says only that the right one which measures about a foot is a little longer than the left  Near an inch from the  anus  the intestine contracts and then expands forming a bag which could admit an egg and into which are inserted the ureters and the  vas deferens  This intestinal bag called Fabricius's purse  From the name of  Fabricius of Aquapendente  who first observed it  has also its  caecum  two inches long and three inches broad and the hole by which they communicate is covered by a fold of the internal membrane which serves for a valve  Perrault    It follows from these observations that the Great Bustard far from having several stomachs and a great extent of intestines like the ruminating animals has on the contrary a very short and narrow alimentary canal and which is furnished with only a single ventricle The opinion of those therefore who pretend that this bird ruminates would be refuted by this circumstance alone  Athenaeus Eustachius  Nor can we believe with Albert that the Great Bustard is carnivorous that it feeds on dead bodies and even wages  war against the feeble kinds of game and that it never eats herbage or grain but in cases of extreme want far less ought we to conclude from these suppositions that the bill and claws are hooked These errors collected by Albert from a passage of Aristotle which is misunderstood have been admitted by Gesner with some modifications but rejected by all the other naturalists  Pennant and others    The Great Bustard is a granivorous bird it lives on herbs grain and every kind of seed on the leaves of coleworts of dandelions of turnips of mouseear of vetches of smallage of carrots and even on hay and on those large worms which during the summer swarm before sunrise on downs In the depth of winter and when the ground is covered with snow they feed on the bark of trees and at all times they swallow small stones or even bits of metal like the ostrich The academicians on opening the stomach of one of the Great Bustards which they observed found it filled partly with stones some of which were of the size of a nut and partly with  doubloons  to the number of ninety all worn and polished where they were exposed to the attrition but without the least appearance of erosion  Willoughby found in the stomach of these birds which were killed in the harvest season  three or four grains of barley with a large quantity of hemlock seed which indicates a decided preference and shews that these seeds would make the best bait for ensnaring them  The liver is very large the gallbladder the pancreas the number of pancreatic ducts their insertion and that of the hepatic and cystic ducts are liable to some variation in different subjects  The testicles are shaped like a small white almond and pretty firm the  vas deferens  is inserted in the lower part of the sac of the  rectum  as I have already mentioned and on the upper margin of the  anus  we find a small appendix which supplies the place of a yard  To these anatomical observations Perrault adds this remark That among all the subjects dissected by the academicians not a single female occurred but we have already anticipated at the article of the ostrich what reflections we should here make  In the pairing season the male struts round the female and spreads his tail into a sort of wheel  Klein and Gesner    The eggs are not so large as those of a goose they are of a pale olive brown sprinkled with small dark spots in which respect their colour bears a great resemblance to that of the plumage  This bird does not build any nest but only scrapes a hole in the ground  British Zoology  and drops into it two eggs which it hatches for thirty days as usual with large birds according to Aristotle  Hist Anim lib vi  When the anxious mother dreads the visits of the sportsmen she takes her eggs under her wings it is not described how and transports them to a safe place  Klein  She commonly chooses fields of corn in the ear from an instinct which prompts all animals to bring forth their young in situations that supply the proper food Klein pretends that she prefers oats as having the shortest stalks and that while she sits on her eggs her head is so elevated as to glance along the plain and notice what is going forward But this assertion agrees neither with the general opinion of naturalists nor with the instinct of the Great Bustard which as it is wild and timid must seek for safety rather by concealing itself in tall corn than by overtopping it in order to observe the sportsmen at a distance and incur the danger of being itself discovered  She sometimes leaves her eggs in quest of food and if during her short absence one handle or even breathe on them it is said that she perceives it on her return and abandons them  The Great Bustard though a very large bird is excessively timorous and seems neither  conscious of its strength nor animated by the proper spirit of exerting it Sometimes they assemble to the number of fifty or sixty but they gain as little confidence from their multitude as from their strength or their size the slightest appearance of danger or rather the least novelty alarms them and they can hardly provide for their safety but by flight Dogs they dread most especially as these are generally used to hunt them but they are also afraid of the fox the polecat and every other animal however small which has courage to attack them They shrink from the sierce animals and even the birds of prey So dastardly they are that though only slightly hurt they die through fear rather than from the effect of their wounds  Gesner  Yet Klein asserts that they are sometimes irritated and inflate a loose skin which hangs below the neck If we believe the ancients the Great Bustard has no less affection to the horse than antipathy to the dog  Oppian  de Aucupio  As soon as the timorous bird perceives that noble animal it flies to meet him and generally places itself under his feet  Plutarch  de Soc Animal  If we admit this sympathy between such different animals we might explain the fact by saying that the Great Bustard finds in horsedung some grains that are halfdigested and which prove a resource when pressed by hunger  When it is hunted it runs exceedingly fast and sometimes proceeds several miles without the least interruption  British Zoology  But as it with difficulty takes wing and never unless assisted carried by a favourable wind and as it cannot perch on account of its weight or by reason of the want of a hind toe with which it might cling on a branch and support itself we may admit on the testimony of both the ancients and moderns  Xenophon Aelian Albin Frisch c  that it can be caught by greyhounds It is also chased by a bird of prey  Aldrovandus  or nets are spread into which it will be decoyed by leading out a horse or by merely disguising one's self in a horse's skin  Athenaeus  Every kind of snare how artless soever must succeed if it is true as Aelian affirms that in the kingdom of Pontus the foxes attract them by lying on the ground raising their tail and moving it like the neck of a bird the Bustards he says mistake this object for one of their own species advance to it without hesitation and become the prey of the insidious animal But this implies much subtlety in the fox much stupidity in the Bustard and perhaps more credulity in the writer  I have already mentioned that these birds sometimes flock together to the number of fifty or sixty this happens in Great Britain especially  in autumn they spread over the turnipfields and commit great havock  British Zoology  Longolius says that the gardeners have great antipathy to the Bustard on account of their destroying the turnips  Nec ullam pestem odere magis olitores nam rapis ventrem fulcit nec mediocri praedâ contentus esse solet  LONGOLIUS  apud Aldrov  In France they are observed to arrive and retire regularly in the spring and autumn but in smaller flocks and they seldom halt except on the most elevated spots They have also been remarked on their passage through Burgundy Champagne and Lorraine  The Great Bustard is found in Lybia near Alexandria according to Plutarch  Unless the  otis  be confounded with  otus  which happens so frequently  in Syria in Greece in Spain in France in the plains of Poitou and Champagne  Salerne  in the open countries situated on the east and south of Great Britain from Dorsetshire to the Mers and Lothians in Scotland  British Zoology    Aldrovandus  in the Netherlands and Germany  Frisch says that the Bustard is the largest of the native fowls in Germany  in the Ukraine and Poland where according to Rzacynski it passes the winter in the midst of the snow The authors of the British Zoology affirm that these birds seldom leave the place where they were bred and that their greatest excursions never exceed twenty or thirty miles but Aldrovandus asserts that towards  the end of autumn they arrive in flocks in Holland and limit their haunts to the fields remote from cities and inhabited places Linnaeus says that they travel into Holland and England Aristotle also mentions their migrations  Hist Anim lib viii  but this point requires to be elucidated by more accurate observations  Aldrovandus accuses Gesner of a kind of contradiction on this subject that he affirms that the Great Bustard migrates with the quails  Otidem de quâ scribo avolare puto cum coturnicibus sed corporis gravitate impeditum perseverare non posse in locis proximis remanere  though he had mentioned before that they never leave Switzerland and are sometimes caught in that country during winter  Otis magna si ea est quam vùlgo Trappum vocant non avolat nisi fallor ex nostris regionibus si Helvetiae rara est hieme etiam interdum capitur apud nos  GESNER  ibid  But these assertions may be reconciled if we admit with the authors of the British Zoology that this bird only  flits  Besides those found in Switzerland are few and straggling and such as by no means represent the species and is there any proof that those which are sometimes caught at Zurich in the winter are the same individuals that lived in the country during the summer  What appears most certain is that the Great Bustard is but rarely found in mountainous or populous countries as in Switzerland Tyrol Italy many provinces of Spain France England  and Germany and that when it does occur this happens generally in the winter  Memini ter quaterque apud nos captum in Rhaetia circa Curiam Decembri Januario mensibus nec apud nos nec illic a quoquam agnitum  GESNER  The Bastard is seldom seen in Orleanois and only in winter during snow  SALERNE  Ornithologie  A person of indisputed credit  subjoins Salerne  told me that one day when the fields were covered with snow one of his servants found in the morning thirty bustards halffrozen which he brought into the house and that they were taken for turkies that had been shut out and were not discovered till their warmth was recruited  I recollect to have seen two myself at two different times in a part of Burgundy that is fertile in grain but mountainous but this was always in the winter season and while snow was lying on the ground  But though it can live in cold countries and according to some authors is a bird of passage it would seem that it has never migrated into America by the north for though the accounts of travellers are filled with Bustards found in the New Continent it is easy to perceive that these pretended Bustards are aquatic birds as I have before remarked and entirely different from that which we at present consider Barrere mentions indeed in his Essay on Ornithology a cinereous Bustard of America which he says he observed but in the first place it does not appear that he had seen it in America since he takes no notice of it in his account of Equinoctial France in the second place he is the only one except Klein who speaks of an American Bustard and that of Klein the  macucagua  of Marcgrave has not the characters that belong to the genus since there are four toes on each foot and the lower part of the leg is feathered to its articulation with the  tarsus  it wants the tail and bears scarcely any relation to the Great Bustard unless that it is heavy and never flies or perches With respect to Barrere his authority is not so great in natural history that his testimony can outweigh that of all others And finally his cinereous American Bustard is probably the female of the African Bustard which according to Linnaeus  The  Otis Afra  of Linnaeus  is of an ashcolour  It will be perhaps asked how a bird which though bulky is furnished with wings and sometimes makes use of them has never migrated into America by the straits on the north as many quadrupeds have done I would answer that though it flies this is only when it is pursued that it never makes a distant excursion and according to the remark of Belon has an aversion to water and therefore could never venture to cross the wide expanse of the ocean for though the continents approach each other towards the north the interval is still prodigious compared with the short and tardy flight of the Bustard  The Great Bustard may then be considered as a bird appropriated to the ancient continent  but attached to no particular climate it inhabits the burning sands of Lybia and the frozen shores of the Baltic and occurs in all the intermediate countries  Its flesh is excellent That of the young ones after being kept a short time is remarkably delicate and if some writers have maintained the contrary this arises from their confounding  otis  with  otus  as I have before observed I know not why Hippocrates forbids persons subject to the falling sickness to taste it Pliny recommends the fat of the Bustard to allay the pain in the breasts after childbirth The quills of this bird like those of the goose and the swan are used for writing and anglers are eager to fix them to their hooks because they believe that the little black spots with which they are mottled will appear to the fish as so many little flies and attract them by this deception  The specific character of the Great Bustard  Otistarda    The head and neck of the male is tufted on both sides  It is ranged in the order of the  Gallinae  The LITTLE BUSTARD  The name given by Buffon Pennant Edward and Latham    La Petite Outarde  vulgairement  La Canepeticre  Buff  Otistetrax  Linn Gmel Mull and Bor  Otis Minor  Briss Ray and Will  Tarda Nana  Klein  Tetrax  Belon and Aldrov  Gallina pratojuola  Cet  The French Field Duck  Albin  THIS bird is distinguished from the Great Bustard only by some variations in the colours of its plumage and in being much smaller Like the Great Bustard also it has received the epithet of duck  cane  though it has no analogy to that aquatic bird and is never found near streams or marshes Belon pretends that this name has been applied because it squats on the ground as the ducks do in the water  Caneterre  changed into  canepetiere  and Salerne imagines that it is on account of its resembling in some measure the wild duck and flying in the same manner But these etymological conjectures are vague and uncertain they rest on a single point of analogy and are inconsistent with each other and the name is therefore apt to convey a false idea The epithet  which we have adopted is not liable to the same objections  Belon supposes that this bird is the  tetrax  of Athenaeus resting his opinion on a passage of the ancient where it is compared in point of size to the  spermologus  The  tetrax    says Alexander Myndius  is a bird of the bulk of the  spermologus  of the colour of potters clay variegated with some dirty spots and great white lines it lives on fruits and after it has young it utters a cry that consists of four parts  ATHENAEUS lib ix  which he takes for the  freux  a kind of large crow but Aldrovandus affirms on the contrary that the  spermologus  is a species of sparrow and consequently cannot signify the Little Bustard and Willoughby even asserts that this bird had no name among the ancients  Aldrovandus too informs us that the fishers at Rome gave the name of  stella  for what reason he does not know to a bird which at first he took for the Little Bustard but afterwards on more minute inspection he discovered to be different Yet notwithstanding this express declaration Ray and Salerne say that the Little Bustard and the  stella avis  of Aldrovandus appear to be the same species and Brisson places it without hesitation among the synonyms he seems even to allege that Charleton and Willoughby had the same idea though these authors have been very attentive not to confound the  two kinds of birds which it is most probable they had never seen  Charleton makes two different species the ninth of his  phytivori  which is the Little Bustard and the tenth which is the  avis stella  In the former he copies Belon and in the latter he refers to Johnston Willoughby keeps the names of  stella  and  canepetiere  entirely distinct  On the other hand Barrere classing it with the rail bestows on it the name of  ortygometra melina  and gives it a fourth toe to each foot so true is it that the multiplicity of systems without increasing our real knowledge only serves to give birth to new errors  This bird is a real Bustard as I have said but formed on a smaller scale and for this reason Klein terms it  tarda nana    dwarf bustard  Its length from the point of the bill to the end of the nails is eighteen inches or it is less than half that of the Great Bustard This measure will serve as a standard of comparison from which all the other dimensions may be deduced but we must not conclude with Ray that its bulk is to that of the Great Bustard as one to two it is as the cubes of these numbers or as one to eight It is nearly the size of a pheasant  To have an idea of the Little Bustard conceive a quail much spotted and as large as a middling pheasant  BELON  and it has like the Great Bustard only three toes on each foot The lower part of its leg is naked the bill is similar to that of the gallinaceous tribe  and there is a rosecoloured down under all the feathers on the body but it has two  pennae  fewer in the tail one more in each of the wings and when these are closed the last ones stretch almost as far as the first or those most remote from the body Further the male has not those beards of feathers as the male of the great species and Klein adds that its plumage is not so beautiful as that of the female contrary to what is most usually remarked in other birds Excepting these slight differences the two species are perfectly analogous they have the same shape the same internal disposition of parts the same instincts the same habits and it would seem that the small one was produced from the egg of the large when it had not force sufficient to effect a complete developement  The male is distinguished from the female by a double white collar and by some other varieties in point of colour but the plumage on the upper part of the body is almost the same in both sexes and as Belon has remarked is much less liable to vary in different individuals  According to Salerne they have a particular call in the love season which begins in May It is the sound  broo  or  proo  which they repeat the whole night and are heard at a great distance The males fight obstinately and contend for the dominion of a certain tract one male takes a number of females under his protection and the  place of their amours is trodden like a barn floor  The female lays in the month of June three four or even five eggs which are extremely beautiful and of a shining green When the young are hatched she leads them as a hen does her chickens They begin to fly about the middle of August and when they hear a noise they lie flat on the ground and suffer themselves to be crushed rather than stir from the spot  Salerne That writer does not quote his authorities There is some reason to suspect that he confounds the  tetrix  or woodcock with the  tetrax  or Little Bustard especially as he is the only naturalist who describes minutely the amours of the Little Bustard    The males are caught in snares into which they are decoyed by a stuffed female whose cry is imitated They are often hunted by means of the falcon but in general it is difficult to get near them for they are always on the watch on some rising spot in fields of oats though never it is said among those of rye or wheat Towards the close of the summer season they prepare to quit the country and are then observed to assemble in flocks and the young ones are no longer distinguishable now from the old  Salerne    According to Belon they feed like those of the great species on herbs and grain and also on ants beetles and small flies but Salerne maintains that they live chiefly on insects and only  eat sometimes in the spring the most tender leaves of the sowthistle  The Little Bustard is not dispersed through so wide a range as the large species Linnaeus says that it is found in Europe and particularly in France This assertion is rather vague since there are some extensive countries in Europe and even large provinces in France where it is unknown We may refer the climates of Sweden and Poland to the number of such as are unfavourable to its nature for Linnaeus takes no notice of it in his  Fauna Suecica  nor Rzaczynzki in his Natural History of Poland and Klein never saw more than one at Dantzic and it came from the  menagerie  of the Margrave of Bareith  Nor can it be more common in Germany since Frisch who undertakes to describe and figure the birds in that country and who is minute on the subject of the Great Bustard never mentions a word of this species and Scwenckfield never names it  Gesner only inserts its name in the list of those birds which he had never seen and what indeed shews this is that he supposes its feet are hairy as those of Attagas which affords a suspicion that it is at least very rare in Switzerland  The authors of the British Zoology whose view it was to take notice of no animal but what was British or at least of British origin conceive that they would not have conformed to  their plan if they had described a Little Bustard that was killed in Cornwall but which they consider as a stray bird and by no means a native of Great Britain So totally unknown is it in that country that a specimen being presented to the Royal Society none of the members then present could recognise it and they were obliged to apply to Edwards to discover its species  Edwards' Gleanings    On the other hand Belon informs us that in his time neither the ambassadors from Venice Ferrara and the Pope's dominions to whom he shewed one nor any in their train could decide what it was and that some of them even took it for a pheasant From this circumstance he properly infers that it must be at least very uncommon in Italy and the conclusion is still very probable though Ray in passing through Modena saw one in the market We may therefore reckon Poland Sweden Great Britain Germany Switzerland and Italy as countries where the Little Bustard is not found It is even likely that the range is confined with in narrower limits and that France is the region peculiar to this bird and the only climate suited to its nature for the French naturalists describe it the best and all the others except Klein who saw one merely copy Belon Nor must we conclude that the Little Bustard is equally common in every part of France there are large provinces in the Kingdom where it is never seen Salerne informs us  that it is pretty common in Beauce where it is only a bird of passage that it arrives about the middle of April and retires on the approach of winter he subjoins that it delights in poor stoney lands and from this circumstance it derives the epithet of  canepetrace  or  rock duck  It also occurs in Berri where it receives a similar name  Canepetrotte  It must be common in Maine and Normandy since Belon judging of the other provinces from these with which he was best acquainted asserts that  there is not a peasant in the country who does not know its name  The Little Bustard is naturally cunning and suspicious insomuch that it has given rise to a proverb When it is apprehensive of danger it immediately quits the spot and keeping close to the ground flies swiftly or paces forward and then runs so fast that a man can hardly overtake it  Belon    The flesh of the Little Bustard is black and is excellent food Klein assures us that the eggs of the female in his possession were very palatable and that the flesh was better than that of the female of the black grous  Its internal structure is nearly the same according to Belon as that of the common granivorous birds  Specific character of the Little Bustard  otistetrax    Its head and throat smooth  Latham adds that  it is variegated with black rufous and white and the under surface white  It is frequent in the southern plains of Russia and even penetrates into Great Tartary but it is never found in Siberia  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE ANALOGOUS TO THE BUSTARDS  I The LOHONG or CRESTED ARABIAN BUSTARD  Buff  Otis Arabs  Linn Gmel Briss and Klein  The Arabian Bustard  Lath and Edw  THE bird which the Arabians call  Lohong  and which Edwards first figured and described is nearly the size of our Great Bustard and like it has three toes on each foot turned the same way only rather shorter the feet the bill and the neck are longer and on the whole it is rather more tapershaped  The plumage on the upper part of the body is browner and similar to that of the woodcock or it is tawny and radiated with deep brown with white spots in the form of a crescent on its wings The lower part of the body is white as also the margin of the upper part of the wing The crown of the head the throat  and the fore side of the neck are marked with transverse bars of a dull brown on a cincreous ground The lower part of the leg the bill and the feet are of a bright brown and yellowish the tail droops like that of the partridge and is stained with a cross black bar the great quills of the wing and the crest are also of the same colour  This crest forms a remarkable character in the Arabian Bustard it is pointed directed backwards and much inclined to the horizon from its base it sends off two black lines of which the longer one passes over the eye and makes a kind of eyelid the other which is much shorter stretches under the eye but does not reach it the eye is black and placed in a white space  When we take a profile view of this crest at a little distance we might fancy that we see ears pretty close to the head and leaning backwards and as the Arabian Bustard was undoubtedly better known to the Greeks than ours it is probable that they named it  otis  on account of these kind of ears in the same way that they have called the longeared owl  otus  or  otos  by reason of two similar tufts which distinguish that species of nocturnal birds  An individual of this kind which was brought from Moka lived several years at London in the possession of Sir Hans Sloane but Edwards who has given us a coloured figure of it has preserved no account of its dispositions its  habits or even of its manner of feeding he ought at least to have not confounded it with the gallinaceous tribes from which it differs so widely as I have shewn in the article of the Great Bustard  Linnaeus characterises the Arabian Bustard  Otis Arabs  by its  erect tufted ears  It inhabits Arabia Felix and penetrates in Asia as far as the Caspian Sea  II The AFRICAN BUSTARD  Buff  Otis Afra  Gmel  Otis Atra  Linn  The Whiteeared Bustard  Lath  THIS is what Linnaeus makes his fourth species it differs from the Arabian Bustard by the colours of its plumage the black predominating but the back is cinereous and the ears white  In the male the bill and feet are yellow the crown of the head ashcoloured and the exterior margin of the wings white but the female is entirely cinereous except the belly and thighs which are black as in the Indian Bustard  This bird is found in Ethiopia according to Linnaeus and it is extremely probable that the  one mentioned by the navigator Le Maire by the name of  flying ostrich  of Senegal is the same for though the account given by him be short it partly coincides and is entirely consistent with the description of the naturalist Its plumage is grey and black its flesh delicious and its size is nearly the same with that of the swan Our conjecture receives additional force from the testimony of Adanson that intelligent naturalist having killed one of these flying ostriches at Senegal and examined it narrowly assures us that in many respects it is analogous to the European Bustard but differs in the colour of its plumage which is generally of a greyash in the greater length of its neck and also by a kind of crest on the back of the head  This crest is evidently what Linnaeus calls the  ears  and the greyash colour is exactly that of the female and as these are the principal characters by which the African Bustard of Linnaeus and the flying ostrich of Senegal are distinguished from the European Bustard it would seem that we may conclude that they have a great analogy and for the same reason we may apply to both what is observed with respect to each individual for example that they are nearly as large as our bustard and have a longer neck The last mentioned circumstance noticed by Adanson is a point of resemblance to the Arabian Bustard which inhabits almost the same climate and nothing to the contrary can be inferred from the  silence of Linnaeus since he gives no measurement at all of the African Bustard With regard to bulk Le Maire makes that of the flying ostrich equal to that of the swan and Adanson represents it as the same with that of the European Bustard since while he mentions that the resemblance is complete in many respects and states the principal differences he omits that of the size and also as Ethiopia or Abyssinia which is the native region of the African Bustard and Senegal which is that of the flying ostrich though widely differing in longitude are of the same climate I conceive that there is great probability that these two birds belong to the same identical species  The specific character of the African Bustard  Otis Afra  is  That it is black its back cinereous its ears white  It is called  korrhaen  by the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope Sparrman says that it artfully conceals itself till one comes pretty near it when it suddenly soars almost perpendicularly aloft with a sharp quavering scream  korrh    korrh  which gives the alarm to the animals in its neighbourhood  III The CHURGE or MIDDLE INDIAN BUSTARD  Buff  Otis Bengalensis  Gmel  Pluvialis Bengalensis major  Briss  Indian Bustard  Edw and Lath  THIS Bustard is not only smaller than the European the African or the Arabian species but it is taller and more slender It is twenty inches high from the crown of the head to the plane on which it stands its neck seems to be shorter in proportion to its feet but in other respects it is entirely analogous to the Common Bustard It has three separate toes on each foot the lower part of the leg is not feathered the bill is somewhat hooked though more elongated I am at a loss to conceive why Brisson referred it to the genus of plovers  The distinguishing character between the plovers and the bustards consists according to that naturalist in the form of the bill which in the latter is an arched cone and in the former it is straight and enlarged near the extremity But in the Indian plover the bill is curved rather than straight and not at all swelling near the point as in the plovers at least so  it is represented in a figure of Edwards which Brisson allows to be exact I may add that this property is more remarkable than in the Arabian Bustard of Edwards the accuracy of which figure is also admitted by Brisson and yet he has not hesitated to class it with the bustards  We need only cast a glance on the figure of the Indian Bustard and compare it with those of the plovers to be convinced that it differs totally in its appearance and proportions its neck is longer its wings shorter and its shape more expanded and besides it is four times the bulk of the largest plover whose extreme length is only sixteen inches while that of the Indian Bustard is twentysix  This is consistent with the measure I have stated above that it is twenty inches from the crown of the head to the plane on which it stands for the bill and toes are not then taken into account    Black fulvous white and grey are the predominant colours of its plumage as in the European Bustard but they are differently distributed The black is spread on the crown of the head on the neck the thighs and the lower part of the body a bright yellow occupies the sides of the head and the circuit of the eyes a browner yellow and one more shaded with black stains the back the tail that part of the wings next the back and the top of the breast where it forms a broad belt on a dark  ground the white appears on the coverts of the wings farthest from the back and white mixed with black on the intermediate space the deepest gray is laid on the eyelids the extremity of the longest quills of the wing  As in some of the European Bustards  PERRAULT  of some of the middle and shortest ones and on some of their coverts lastly the brightest gray which verges on white is spread on the bill and the feet  This bird is a native of Bengal where it is called  Churge  We may remark that the climate of Bengal is nearly the same with that of Arabia Abyssinia and Senegal where the two preceding Bustards are found and we may term it the  Middle Bustard  because it holds the intermediate rank between the large and the small species  Specific character of the Indian Bustard  Otis Bengalensis    It is black the space about the eyes dusky the back the rump and the tail dusky but glossed  IV The HOUBARA or LITTLECRESTED AFRICAN BUSTARD  Buff  OutisHoubara  Gmel  The Ruffed Bustard  Lath  WE have found among the Great Bustards that some are crested and others not and we shall discover that the same distinction prevails in the Little Bustards That which the people of Barbary call  Houbara  is actually decorated with a crest or ruff Dr Shaw who gives us a figure of it asserts positively that it has the shape and plumage of the Great Bustard but is much smaller not exceeding the size of a capon for this single reason that intelligent traveller who was certainly not acquainted with the little species which inhabits France finds fault with Golius for translating the word  Houbaary  by Bustard  It lives like ours on vegetable substances and insects and generally inhabits the borders of the desert  Though Dr Shaw takes no notice of the ruff in his description there is one in the figure to which he refers and it appears bending backwards and pendant It is formed by long feathers  which rise from the neck and which as in the domestic cock bristle when the bird is irritated  It is curious  says Dr Shaw  to observe when it apprehends the attack of a rapacious bird the turnings and windings the marches and countermarches which it performs in a word the evasions and stratagems which it makes to elude its enemy  This learned traveller subjoins that it furnishes an excellent medicine for soreeyes and that for this reason its gall and a certain substance found in its stomach are sometines sold at a very high price  Specific character of the Ruffed Bustard  OtisHoubara    Yellowish the feathers of the neck very long whitish and striated with black the quills of the wings large and black and marked near the middle with a black spot  V The RHAAD another SMALLCRESTED AFRICAN BUSTARD  Buff  OtisRhaad  Gmel  The Rhaad Bustard  Lath  THE Rhaad is distinguished from the Little Bustard of France by its crest and from the Houbaara of Africa by the defect of the ruff It is however of the same size with the latter its head is black its crest deep blue the upper part of the body and the wings yellow spotted with brown the tail of a brighter brown radiated transversely with black the belly white and the bill strong as well as the legs  The Little Rhaad differs from the Great one by its size being no larger than a common hen by some varieties in the plumage and by the want of a crest But it may still possibly be of the same species with the other and differ only by its sex My reasons for this conjecture are these It inhabits the same climate and is called by the same name In almost all birds except the carnivorous kinds the male seems to have more power of development which appears in their greater height the strength of their muscles and in certain excrescences as fleshly  membranes spurs c or by tufts crests and ruffs which proceed as it were from the luxuriancy of organization and even by the brightness of the colours of their plumage  At any rate both the Great and the Little Rhaad are termed  Safsaf Rhaad  signifies thunder in the African language and is expressive of the noise that these birds make in springing from the ground  Safsaf  denotes the rustling of their wings when flying  Shaw's Travels    Specific character of the Rhaad  There is a crest on the back of the head in the male of skyblue the head black the upperside of the body and the wings yellow spotted with dusky colour the abdomen white the tail duskish with black transverse streaks  It is gregarious and granivorous in Arabia  The COCK  Le Coq  Buff  Phasianus Gallus  In Greek it was called  from    priv    a couch on account of its early crowing  In Latin  Gallus  in Spanish and Italian  Gallo  in German  Han  in Polish  Kur  or  Kogut  in Swedish  Hoens  or  Tupt  Gmel  THIS bird though a domestic and the most common of all is still perhaps not sufficiently known Most persons if we except the few who bestow particular attention on the productions of Nature need some information with respect to the peculiarities of its external form and of its internal structure its habits original and acquired the differences occasioned by sex climate or food and concerning the various races which sooner or later have branched from the primitive stock  But if the Cock be too little known by the bulk of men what embarrassment must it give to the methodical naturalist who is never satisfied till he refer every object to his classes and genera If he adopts the number of toes as the foundation of his system he will range it with the birds that have four But what place will  N  o  THE DOMESTIC COCK  he assign to the hen with five toes which is undoubtedly of the gallinaceous tribe and of an ancient family since it can be traced to the time of Columella who mentions it as a generous breed  They are reckoned the most noble which have five toes  COLUMELLA lib viii  If he forms the Cock into a separate genus distinguished by the singular shape of its tail where will he place the Cock that has no rump and consequently no tail but which still belongs to the same family If he admits that the legs clothed with plumage to the heels is a generic character will he not be puzzled in classing the roughfooted Cock which is feathered to the origin of the toes and the Japanese Cock which is feathered as far as the nails Lastly If he would refer the gallinaceous birds to the granivorous tribe and infer from the number and structure of their stomachs and intestines that they were destined to feed on grain and vegetable substances how will he account for the fondness which they discover for earthworms and mincedmeat whether raw or cooked But perhaps while he imagines that the long intestines and double stomachs in poultry prove that they are granivorous birds he would also conclude from the hooked shape of their bill they are also vermivorous or even carnivorous What absurdities and contradictions Such are the feeble efforts of a little  mind which being unable to comprehend the extension and grandeur of the universe endeavours to confine it within the tramels of system And to what trifling and vague speculations do these attempts give rise For our parts we shall not attempt to connect the birds by a scientific chain we shall only join those together that seem the most analogous but we shall endeavour to mark their characteristic features and note particularly the leading facts in their history  The Cock is a heavy bird whose gait is composed and slow His wings are very short and hence he flies seldom and sometimes his screams indicate the violence of the effort He crows either in the night or day but not regularly at certain hours and his note differs widely from that of the female Some hens make a kind of crowing though fainter and not so distinctly articulated He scrapes the ground to seek his food and swallows with the grains little pebbles which rather assist digestion He drinks by taking a little water into his bill and raising his head at each draught He sleeps oftenest with one foot in the air  The thigh on which the body rests is commonly more fleshy than the other and our epicures know well how to distinguish them  and his head covered by the wing on the same side In its natural situation the body is nearly parallel to the  ground and so is the bill the neck rises vertically the forehead is ornamented with a red fleshy comb and the underpart of the bill with a double pendant of the same colour and substance this however is neither flesh nor membrane but of a peculiar nature different from every thing else  In both sexes the nostrils are situated on either side of the upper mandible and the ears on either side of the head and below each ear a white piece of skin is spread The feet have commonly four toes sometimes five but always three of them placed behind The feathers rise two and two from each shaft a remarkable character which has been noticed by few naturalists The tail is nearly straight but admits of a small elevation and depression In those gallinaceous tribes where it is single it consists of fourteen feathers which are parted into two unequal planes that join at their upper margin making an angle more or less acute But what distinguishes the male is that the two feathers in the middle of the tail are much longer than the rest and are bent into an arch that the feathers of the tail and rump are long and narrow and that the feet are armed with spurs It is indeed true that some hens also have spurs but this rarely occurs and in such hens there are many other points of resemblance to the male their comb and tail are arched the same way they imitate the crowing of the cock and would even  attempt to perform his office  Arist Hist Anim lib ix  But we should be mistaken were we to infer that they are hermaphrodites they are unfit for procreation and averse to the male embrace we must regard them as imperfect degenerate individuals wherein the sexual character is obliterated  A good Cock is one whose eyes sparkle with fire who has boldness in his demeanour and freedom in his motions and all whose proportions display force Such a bird would not indeed strike terror into a lion as has often been said and written but would command the love of the females and place himself at the head of a numerous flock of hens To spare him he ought not to be allowed more than twelve or fifteen Columella recommends that these should not exceed five but though the Cock should have fifty aday it is said  Aldrovandus  that he would not neglect one Yet no one can be certain that all his embraces are efficatious and sufficient to fecundate the eggs of the female His lust seems to be as fiery as his gratifications are frequent In the morning the first thing he does after he is let out from his roost is to tread his hens Food seems to him only a secondary want and if he is deprived for some time of the company of his family he makes his addresses to the first female that he meets  though of a very different species  A crossbreed is produced between a Cock and the henpartridge which through time grows like the female  ARISTOTLE lib ix  and even courts the first male that occurs The first fact is mentioned by Aristotle the second is proved by an observation of Edwards  Having shut up three or four Cocks in a place where they could have no commerce with any hen they soon laid aside theïr former animosity and instead of fighting each tried the other though none seemed willing to submit  Preface to the Gleanings  and by a law mentioned by Plutarch in which it was enacted that a Cock convicted of this unnatural act should be burnt alive  In his treatise on the question "Whether brutes reason"    The hens must be selected for the Cock if we would have a genuine race but if we want to vary and improve the species the breed must be crossed This observation did not escape the ancients Columella expressly mentions that the best poultry is produced by the union of a Cock of a foreign family with the ordinary hens and we find in Athenaeus that this idea was improved a cockpheasant being given to the common hens  De Re Rustica  lib viii  Longolius describes the method of associating the cockpheasant with common hens  GESNER  de Avibus  I am assured that the Guinea Cock also treads the hens if educated together but that the breed are rather barren    In every case we ought to chuse those hens which have a lively eye a flowing red comb and  have no spurs The proportions of their body are in general more slender than the males yet their feathers are broader and their legs shorter Sagacious farmers prefer black hens because they are more prolific than the white and more easily escape the piercing sight of the birds of rapine which hover near the farmyard  The Cock is extremely watchful of his females and even filled with inquietude and anxiety he hardly ever loses sight of them he leads them defends them and threatens them with his menaces collects them together when they straggle and never eats till he has the pleasure of seeing them feeding around him To judge from the different inflexions of his voice and the various significant gestures which he makes we cannot doubt but these are a species of language that serves to communicate his sentiments When he loses them he utters his griefs Though as jealous as he is amorous he abuses not his wives but turns his rage against his rivals When another Cock is presented he allows no time for feduction he instantly rushes forward his eyes flashing fire and his feathers bristled and makes a furious attack on his rival and fights obstinately till one or the other fall or the interloper leave the field The desire of possession ever excessive not only prompts him to drive away every rival but to remove the most inoffensive obstacles he beats off and sometimes kills the chickens that he may enjoy the mother more at his ease Is  this appetite the sole cause of his furious jealousy In the midst of a submissive seraglio how can he apprehend any bounds to his gratification But how ardent soever be his passions he seems to be more averse to share the pleasures than eager to taste them and as his powers are greater so his jealousy is more excusable and better founded than that of other sultans Like them also he has his favourite female whom he courts with greater assiduity and on whom he bestows his favours as often nearly as on all the rest together  What proves that in Cocks jealousy is a passion founded on reflection is that many of them are perpetually fighting with each other in the courtyard while they never attack the capons at least if these are not in the habit of following the hens  Man who is dexterous in drawing amusement from every quarter has learnt to set into action that invincible antipathy which Nature has implanted in one Cock to another So much have they fostered this native hatred that the battles of two domestic birds have become spectacles fit to attract the curiosity of people even in polished society and at the same time these have been considered as the means of calling forth or maintaining that precious ferocity which is they say the source of heroism Formerly and even at present in more than one country men of all ranks crowd to these grotesque combats  divide into parties grow heated for the fortune of their favourite Cock heighten the interest of the exhibition by the most extravagant bets and the fate of families is decided by the last stroke of the victorious bird Such was anciently the madness of the Rhodians the Tangrians and the people of Pergamus  Pliny lib x  and such at present is that of the Chinese  Gemelli Careri Ancient Accounts of India and China  of the inhabitants of the Philippine islands of Java of the isthmus of America and of some other nations in both continents  Navarette  Description de la Chine    But Cocks are not the only birds that have been thus abused the Athenians who allotted one day in the year  When Themistocles was about to give battle to the Persians observing his troops dispirited he pointed to two Cocks that were fighting  See  said he  the unshaken courage of these animals yet they have no other motive than the love of victory But you fight for your household gods the tombs of your fathers and your liberty  These few words revived the courage of the army and Themistocles gained the victory It was in memory of this event that the Athenians instituted a kind of festival which was celebrated by cockfighting  AELIAN  to cockfighting employed quails likewise for the same diversion and even at present the Chinese breed for that purpose certain small birds resembling quails or linnets The mode of sighting varies according to the different schools where they are formed and the different weapons offensive or defensive with which they are armed but it is curious that  the Rhodian Cocks though larger stronger and better fighters than the others were not so ardent for the females and had only three hens instead of fifteen or twenty whether because their fire was extinguished in the constrained solitude in which they were accustomed to live or because their rage being too often roused had stifled in them the softer passions which however were at first the principle of their courage and the source of their hostile disposition The males of that breed were therefore less vigorous and the females less prolific and more indolent both in laying eggs and watching their chickensSo successful has Art been in degrading Nature and so unfavourable are the talents for war to the business of propagation  Hens need not the embrace of the Cock to procure eggs these are continually detached from the bunch in the ovarium which grows independent of the union with the male As they enlarge they acquire maturity separate from their calyx and pedicle pass through the whole length of the  oviductus  and in their road assimilate by a certain power that they possess the lymph with which the duct is filled and form it into their white their coats and their shell There they remain till the sensible and elastic fibres being stretched and stimulated by these substances which have now become foreign contract and extrude them the large end being foremost according to Aristotle  These eggs are all that the prolific quality of the female can produce alone and unassisted she exudes an organized body indeed susceptible of a kind of life but not a living animal similar to the mother and in its turn capable of continuing the race This requires the union of the male and intimate mixture of the seminal liquors of both sexes but when once this has taken place its effects are durable Dr Harvey observed that the egg of a hen which had been separated twenty days from the Cock was not less prolific than one laid newly after treading and that the embryo was not on that account more advanced and required the same length of incubation a certain proof that heat alone cannot produce or promote the developement of the chick but that the egg must be formed or at least placed where it can perspire in order that the embryo inclosed may be susceptible of incubation otherwise all the eggs which remain in the oviduct twentyone days after fecundation would hatch since they would have the proper time and heat and in this case hens would be sometimes oviparous sometimes viviparous  I know of no person except Dr Michael Lyzeruts who saw a viviparous hen But the instances would be frequent if heat were only required to hatch a fecundated egg  German Ephemerides  Dec ii an Append obs    The mean weight of the egg of an ordinary hen is one ounce six grains If we open it carefully  we may perceive immediately under the shell a common membrane which lines the whole of the inner cavity then the external white which has the form of this cavity next the internal white which is rounder than the preceding and lastly in the centre of this white we find the yolk which is spherical All these different parts are inclosed each in its proper membrane and all the membranes are connected together at the  chalazae  So called from  a hailstone on account of the similarity of appearance  or cords which form the two poles of the yolk The little lenticular vesicle called the  cicatricula  i e  a little scar  It is a yellowish white round spot and when examined it appears composed of several different coloured circles  appears very near its equator and is firmly attached to the surface  Bellini misled by his experiments or rather by the consequences which he drew from them fancied and made many believe that if fresh eggs were hardened in boiling water the  cicatricula  left the surface of the yolk and retired to the centre but when eggs that had been set under the hen were hardened in the same way the cicatricula remained constantly attached to the surface The philosophers at Turin repeated and varied the experiments but found that in all eggs whether newlaid or such as had undergone a partial incubation the cicatricula continued to adhere to the surface of the hardened yolk and that the white substance which Bellini saw at the centre was quite different and was occasioned by too much or too little boiling    With respect to its external form it is too well known to need any description but it is often altered by accidents which it is easy to account  for from the history of the egg itself and its formation  It is not uncommon to find two yolks included in the same shell This happens when two eggs alike formed are detached at the same time from the  ovarium  and pass together through the oviduct forming their white without parting and become invested with the same external coat  If by any accident which may easily be supposed an egg that has been some time disengaged from the  ovarium  is checked in its growth and when formed as much as it can be comes within the sphere of action of another vigorous egg it will coalesce with it and form an egg within an egg  Collection Academique    In the same manner we may conceive how a pin or any other substance which has penetrated as far as the oviduct will be found inclosed within  Idem  an egg  Some hens lay eggs that have no shell whether from the defect of the proper substance for forming the shell or because they are extruded from the oviduct before their complete maturity these never produce chickens and this happens it is said to hens that are too fat The opposite circumstances occasion the eggs to have too thick shells or even double shells Some retain the pedicle by which they are fixed to the ovarium others are bent into the form of a crescent  others are shaped like a pear some have had on their shells the impressions even of a sun a comet  Collection Academique  an eclipse or whatever has operated powerfully on the imagination nay some have appeared luminous What has been real in the alterations in the shape of the egg and the marks on the surface must be ascribed to the different pressures which it receives while the shell is still soft and pliant and yet of such a consistence as to retain the impressions It will be more difficult to account for the luminous appearance  Ephemerides de Curieux de la Nature  of some eggs A German doctor observed such under a white hen which had been fecundated he adds by a very vigorous Cock We cannot decently deny the possibility of the fact but as it is single it would be prudent to repeat the observation before we venture to explain it  With regard to the pretended Cocks eggs that have no yolk and include as the vulgar imagine a serpent  Collection Academique  they are nothing else but the immature productions of an infant hen or the last effort of one exhausted by excessive fecundity or finally they are imperfect eggs that have lost their yolks in the oviduct either from accident or from the wrong conformation of the parts but that have still retained their cords or  chalazae  which the lovers of the marvellous have fancied converted into a serpent M de la Peyronie has  put this beyond all doubt by the dissection of a hen which laid such eggs but neither M de la Peyronie nor Thomas Bartholin who dissected these pretended oviparous Cocks could discover eggs or ovaria or any thing analogous  Collection Academique    Hens lay through the whole year except the time of moulting which generally lasts six weeks or two months about the end of autumn and the beginning of the winter This moulting is nothing but the shedding of the old feathers which are detached like the old leaves of trees and the antlers of stags being excluded by the growth of the new The Cocks also suffer this renovation but it is remarkable that the new feathers sometimes assume a different colour One of our observers has noticed this fact in a hen and a cock and every person may remark it in many other kinds of birds particularly in those that are brought from Bengal which change their tints at almost every moulting and in general the colours of the first feathers in by far the greatest number of birds are different from what they afterwards become  The ordinary fecundity of hens is limited to the laying an egg each day There are some it is said in Samogitia  Rzacynski  Nat Hist Poland  Malacca  Bontekoe  Voyage aux Indes Orientales  and other places that lay twice aday Aristotle mentions certain hens of Illyria which laid so often as thrice aday  and it is probable that these were the same with the Adrian or Adriatic hens of which he speaks in another place and which were noted for their prolific quality Some add that there is a peculiar mode of feeding common hens which gives them this prodigious fecundity Heat is very favourable hens can be brought to lay in winter by keeping them in a stable where there is always warm dung on which they can sit  As soon as an egg is laid it begins to perspire and loses every day some grains of its weight by the evaporation of the more volatile juices in proportion it thickens hardens and dries or it contracts an offensive smell and becomes totally unfit for hatching The art of long preserving eggs consists in checking the perspiration  The  Journal Economique  for the month of March mentions three eggs fit for eating found in Italy in the heart of a wall built years ago This fact is the more incredible as a coat of mortar would not be sufficient to preserve an egg and as the thickest walls dry in every part the transpiration through the shell would not be prevented  by covering the shell completely with a coat of any kind of grease shortly after it is laid By this single precaution we can preserve them for several months and even years in a condition for eating and capable of being hatched and in a word retaining all the properties of fresh eggs  Pratique de l'art de faire eclore le poulets  The inhabitants of Tonquin keep them in a kind of  paste made of sifted ashes and brine other Indians in oil  Tavernier  varnish is also proper when the eggs are intended for the table but grease is equally fit for this purpose and is much better for preserving eggs that are to be hatched because it can be more easily separated than the varnish and the coating must be completely detached in order that the incubation succeed for whatever obstructs the perspiration prevents also the development of the chick  This assertion seems to require some modification The late ingenious Dr Monro of Edinburgh rubbed the obtuse ends of eighteen eggs and yet they all succeeded in hatching  Comparative Anatomy  p    I have said that the union of the Cock was necessary to the fecundation of the eggs and this fact is founded on long and constant experience But the details of this act so essential in the history of animals have been too slightly observed It is indeed known that the male organ is double and is only the two paps which terminate the spermatic vessels where they are inserted in the gut that the female  vulva  is placed over the  anus  and not under as in the quadrupeds  Rhedi  Collection Academique  that he advances to his female with an oblique quickened pace dropping his wings like the turkey and even partly spreading his tail uttering a certain expressive murmur with a trembling motion and with all the signs  of ardent desire that he darts upon the hen who receives him bending her legs squatting on the ground and laying aside the two fans of feathers which compose her tail that then he seizes with his bill the crest or tuft on the head of the female either by way of caressing her or of keeping his balance that he bends the hind part of his body where his double yard is lodged and applies it briskly where the corresponding orifice is placed that this copulation lasts the shorter time the oftener it is repeated and that the Cock seems to boast of his performance by clapping his wings and by a kind of crowing of joy or victory that he has testicles and that his seminal liquor is contained like that of the quadrupeds in spermatic vessels I have ascertained by my own observations that the semen of the hen is lodged in the  cicatricula  of each egg as that of the female quadrupeds is included in the glandular bodies of the testicles but I am uncertain whether the double  penis  of the Cock or only one of them penetrates the female orifice and even whether there is a real insertion or only a strong compression or mere contact It is not yet known what must be the precise condition of an egg in order to its fecundation nor to what distance the male influence can extendIn a word notwithstanding the infinite number of experiments and observations that have been made on this subject we still remain  unacquainted with some of the principal circumstances of the impregnation  Its first known effect is the dilation of the  cicatricula  and the formation of the chick in its cavity for it is this  cicatricula  which contains the true germ and occurs in eggs whether fertile or not and even in those pretended Cocks eggs which I have already spoken of  De la Peyronie observed in one of these eggs a round yellow spot of a line in diameter but without any sensible thickness situated on the membrane that adheres to the shell It is probable that the yellow colour was in this case occasioned by the dispersion of the yolk which was found in dissection the membrane which contained the yolk perhaps stuck to that next the shell  but it is smaller in the eggs that are not fecundated Malpighi having examined fertile eggs that were newly laid and before they were covered discovered in the centre of the  cicatricula  a speck swimming in a liquor in the midst of which he could trace the rudiments of a chick distinctly formed but the  cicatricula  of barren eggs produced by the hen alone without the intercourse of the male shewed merely a small shapeless globule furnished with appendices filled with a thick juice though surrounded with several concentric circles and he could perceive no embryo of an animal The intimate and complete organization of a shapeless mass is only the instantaneous effect of the mixture of the two seminal liquors it requires but a moment for Nature to give the first form to this transparent  glareous substance and to diffuse the principle of life through all its points she requires time and conspiring circumstances to finish the rude sketch She has entrusted this charge chiefly to the mother by inspiring the instinct of covering the eggs In most hens this propensity is felt as strongly and marked by as significant signs as copulation to which it succeeds in the order of nature and even though it is not excited by the presence of an egg A hen that has just laid is kindled with transports that are communicated to others which are only mere spectators and they all join in the repeated clamorous bursts of joy either because the sudden cessation of the pains of delivery is always accompanied with a lively pleasure or that the mother then anticipates all the delights of progeny Whatever be the cause certain it is that when she has laid twentyfive or thirty eggs she deliberately prepares to sit on them If they be continually taken from her she will perhaps lay twice or thrice as many and become exhausted by the mere excess of fecundity But the time at last comes when she is driven by the force of instinct to seek to hatch and expresses her wants by a particular sort of clucking and by certain unambiguous motions and attitudes If she cannot find her own eggs she will readily cover those of any other hen or those of the female of any other species or even balls of stone or chalk She will continue still to sit  after every thing is removed waste herself in vain plaints and idle movements  A hen may be put off the brooding by often dipping her posteriors in cold water  If she is successful in her search and finds eggs that are either real or resembling such in a retired and convenient spot she immediately seats herself on them covers them with her wings fosters a genial warmth and constantly changes them gently to heat all the parts equally She is so intent in her occupation as to neglect food and drink One would almost say that she perceives the importance of her employment she omits no care overlooks no precaution to complete the existence of the little incipient beings and to guard against the dangers that threaten  Noise is sometimes injurious to the brood A whole hatch made in a locksmith's shop was attacked by vertigos  Collection Academique  A singular circumstance lately came under my observationA brooding hen having perceived a hole made in one of her eggs was filled with rage but after her passion was somewhat abated she deliberately closed up the wound with mud and feathers T  It may perhaps be worthy of remark that the condition of sitting hen however insipid it appears to us is perhaps not a tedious situation but a state of continual joy the more delicious as it is the more choice so much has Nature connected raptures with whatever relates to the multiplication of her creatures  The effect of incubation is confined merely to the development of the embryo of the  chick which as we have already said exists already formed in the  cicatricula  of the fecundated egg The following is nearly the order in which this developement is made or rather as it appears to the observer and as I have elsewhere given a pretty full account of the facts relating to this subject I shall only repeat the more important circumstances  At the end of five or six hours the head of the chick is distinctly seen joined to the dorsal spine swimming in the liquor with which the speck in the centre of the  cicatricula  is filled and towards the close of the first day the head is already bent back by its enlargement  On the second day are perceived the first traces of the  vertebrae  which are like small globules disposed on the two sides of the middle of the spine the wings and umbilical vessels also begin to appear distinguished by their dull colour the neck and breast are unfolded and the head constantly increases the outlines of the eyes and the three encircling coats as well as the spine and membranes are now seen The life of the foetus is decided the heart beats and the blood circulates  On the third day the whole is more distinct and expanded It is remarkable that the heart hangs out of the breast and beats three times in succession once in receiving from the auricle the blood contained in the veins a second time in discharging it into the arteries and a third  time in forcing it into the umbilical vessels and this motion continues for twentyfour hours after the embryo has been separated from the white of its egg We also discover the veins and arteries on the vesicles of the brain and the rudiments of the spinal marrow beginning to extend along the  vertebrae  Lastly we see the whole foetus enveloped in a part of the surrounding liquor which has acquired a greater consistence than the rest  On the fourth day the eyes are considerably advanced we can distinguish the pupil the crystalline lens and the vitreous humour We also perceive in the head five vesicles filled with a fluid which approaching each other and gradually coalescing on the following days form at last the brain invested with its coats The wings grow the thighs begin to appear and the body to acquire bulk On the fifth day the whole body is covered with an unctuous flesh the heart is confined by a very thin membrane which spreads over the chest and the umbilical vessels rise out of the abdomen  The vessels which spread in the yolk of the egg and which are consequently without the abdomen soon retire into the cavity according to the remark of Steno  Collection Academique    The sixth day the spinal marrow being divided into two parts continues to stretch along the trunk the liver which was before whitish  is now become of a dusky colour the heart beats with its two ventricles the body of the chick is covered with a skin and even the feathers begin to sprout  It is easy on the seventh day to distinguish the bill the brain the wings the thighs and the legs have acquired their perfect shape the two ventricles of the heart appear like two bubbles contiguous and joined above to the substance of the auricles Two successive motions are observed in the ventricles as well as in the auricles which resemble two separate hearts  About the end of the ninth day the lungs appear and are of a whitish colour On the tenth day the muscles of the wings are completely formed and the feathers continue to shoot It is not till the eleventh day that we perceive the arteries which were before at a distance from the heart cohere to it and this organ is now perfect and united into two ventricles  The following days are spent in the farther expansion of the parts which continues till the chick breaks its shell and this happens commonly the twentyfirst day sometimes the eighteenth and at others the twentyseventh  All this train of phaenomena which presents so interesting a spectacle to the observer is the effect of incubation by a hen and human industry has found it not beneath its notice to imitate the process Formerly the rude  peasants of Egypt and in our own times philosophers have succeeded in hatching eggs as well as the most careful sitter and have given birth to amazing numbers at once The whole secret consists in keeping the eggs at a temperature which nearly corresponds to the warmth of the hen and in preventing every kind of humidity and pernicious exhalations such as those of charcoal burning fuel and even that of tainted eggs By observing these two conditions and being attentive in repeatedly shifting the eggs and varying the place of the oven or stove where the baskets are placed so that not only each egg but every part of it may enjoy alike the requisite heat we shall succeed in hatching millions of chickens  Every kind of heat is favourable nor is the warmth of the hen better than that of any other animal not even excepting man  When Livia was pregnant she cherished an egg in her bosom with a view of foretelling the sex of her expected child from that of the chicken which would be hatched It was a cock and she had a boy The augurs turned the accident to their advantage and endeavoured to convince the incredulous of the reality of their art But what was better proved is that the heat of the human body is sufficient for the incubation of eggs  nor than the solar or terrestrial fires or the heat of a bed of oakbark or dung The essential point is to be able to regulate the heat to increase or diminish at pleasure We can always know the degree by means of good thermometers placed in different parts within the oven or stove we  can preserve the heat by stopping the openings and shutting the registers of the lid we can augment it with warm ashes if it be an oven or by adding wood if a stove or using chafingdishes if it be a bed and we can diminish it by opening the registers to give access to the external air or at least by introducing into the oven cold bodies c  But whatever attention be bestowed in regulating the furnace it is hardly possible to maintain constantly and without interruption the d  ° Farenheit  degree of heat which is that of the hen Fortunately this limit is not very determined and a heat varying from the th  °½ F  to the th  ° F  degree is found to occasion no inconvenience But it is to be observed that the excess is more to be dreaded than the defect and that a few hours at the th degree or even the °  ° F  is more injurious than some days at ° And a proof that a still less heat would occasion no inconvenience is that a partridge's nest being discovered in a meadow that was mowing they were kept in the shade for thirtysix hours no hen being found during that time to cover them and yet they all hatched at the end of three days except those which were opened to perceive what condition they were in They were indeed very far advanced  and it undoubtedly required a greater degree of heat at the beginning than near the close of the incubation when the heat of the little chick was almost alone sufficient for its development  With regard to humidity as it is very hurtful to the progress of incubation we must be furnished with certain means of discovering whether it has penetrated into the oven and be able to expel it if it has penetrated and prevent its return  The hygrometer which is the simplest and fittest for estimating the humidity of the air in these sorts of ovens is a cold egg introduced and kept some time till it acquire a proper heat If at the end of a quarter of an hour or more the egg is covered with a light dew such as that formed by the breath on polished glass or what falls on the outside of a tumbler in which a freezing mixture is made this is a proof that the air of the oven is too humid and the more so the longer time the moisture takes to dissipate This happens chiefly in a tanbed and in dung composts inclosed in a confined place The best way to remedy this inconvenience is to renew the air where it is close by means of currents produced by opposite windows or instead of these by fixing ventilators proportioned to the space Sometimes the mere perspiration of the immense number of eggs occasions an excess of humidity in the oven itself in this case  the baskets with the eggs ought to be taken out for a few minutes every two or three days and fanned with a hat waving it in different directions  But it is not enough that the moisture which collects within the oven be expelled we must prevent the entrance of humidity from without by lining the inside with sheetlead good cement plaster a proper mixture of pitch and tar or at least by spreading it over with several coats of oil and allowing this to dry and gluing on the interior surface stripes of bladder or of grey paper  To these few easy practical operations is reduced the whole art of artificial incubation and hence are deduced the structure and dimensions of the ovens or stoves the number shape and distribution of the baskets and all the little manoeuvres which the circumstances require or the occasion suggests which have been described with a profusion of words but which we shall comprise in a few lines without omitting any thing essential  The simplest oven is a cask lined within with glued paper and stopped at the head with a cover which joins into it and which is perforated in the middle by a large opening that shuts with a grooved lid to allow an opportunity of examining the oven There are several other small holes round this which serve as registers to regulate the heat and which can also be stopped  with grooved covers This cask is buried threefourths of its height in warm dung In the inside there are placed one above another at proper distances two or three wideribbed baskets in each of which two rows of eggs are piled taking care that the upper layer be thinner than the lower so that this may be easily seen through the other Small holes may be made if we chuse in the centre of each basket and wellgraduated thermometers suspended there and others placed in different parts of the circumference Thus the requisite heat may be maintained and the chickens ushered into life  If we would be oeconomical of heat and draw utility from what is commonly loft we may employ for artificial incubation that of the ovens for bakers and pastrycooks of forges and glasshouses and even that of a chamberstove or a kitchengrate constantly keeping in mind that the success will depend chiefly on the equal distribution of heat and the total exclusion of humidity  When the ovens are large and wellmanaged they exclude thousands of chickens at a time This profusion would be rather inconvenient in a climate like ours if we had not as well discovered a method of rearing the brood independently of the assistance of the hen as of hatching them without her incubation This consists in a more or less perfect imitation of the manner  in which the mother treats her young after they have emerged from the shell  We shall easily conceive that the mother which shews so strong an inclination to cover her eggs sits on them with such unremitting assiduity and takes so lively a concern for embryos that have yet no being will not cool in her attachment after her chickens are hatched Her affection is heightened by the sight of these little creatures that owe to her their existence it is every day increased by the repetition of cares which their feebleness requires Continually employed in watching over them she seeks food merely to satisfy their craving wants If she cannot find it she scrapes the earth with her nails to extract the nourishment concealed in its bosom and freely bestows it on her young She recals them when they wander spreads her wings over them to defend them against the inclemency of the weather and broods a second time She enters into these tender concerns with so much ardour and anxiety that her health is visibly impaired and she can be distinguished from every other hen by her ruffled feathers her trailing wings and the hoarseness of her voice and the different inflections are all expressive of her situation and mark solicitude and maternal affection  But if she neglects herself in preserving her young she exposes herself to every danger in their defence If a sparrowhawk appear in the  air this mother so feeble so timid and which in every other circumstance would consult her safety by flight becomes intrepid from the warmth of attachment darts before the dreaded talon and by her repeated cries the clapping her wings and her undaunted resolution she often intimidates the rapacious bird which repulsed by the unexpected resistance retires to seek easier prey She then seems to possess all the qualities of a generous mind but what reflects no less honour on her instinct is that if she has been made to sit on ducks eggs or those of any other waterfoul her affection is no less ardent for these strangers than for her own progeny She does not perceive that she is only their nurse and not their mother and when directed by nature they plunge into the neighbouring stream it is amusing to observe the astonishment uneasiness and vexation of the poor nurse who fancies she is still a mother impelled on the one hand by the desire of following them into the midst of the water checked on the other by the invincible repugnance to that element teasing herself with fruitless bustling along the margin trembling forlorn beholding her family in imminent danger and not daring to afford them help  It would be impossible to supply all the assiduities of the hen in raising her young if the same degree of attention were required and an equal affection with that of the mother We  shall succeed by noticing the principal circumstances in the conduct of the hen to her progeny and by imitating them as much as we can For example it being observed that the chief object of the mother's attention is to lead the chickens where they can find food and to guard them against cold and the inclemency of the weather a plan has been formed to effect this and with even more advantage than from the assistance of the hen herself If they be hatched in winter they are kept a month or six weeks in a stove heated to the same degree with the ovens for incubation and only let out five or six times aday to eat in open air and especially to enjoy the sun The warmth of the stove promotes their growth and the exposure to the air strengthens and braces them Crumbs of bread yolks of eggs and millet seeds are their first food If the incubation be performed in summer they are kept in the stove only three or four days and in all seasons they are brought out of the stove only to be put into the crib which is a kind of square cage shut with a front of grating made of iron wire or simple netting and closed above with a hinged lid In this cage the chickens are fed but after they have eaten enough and taken sufficient exercise they must be sheltered so as to allow them to enjoy warmth and repose Hence the chickens that are led by their mother are accustomed to assemble under the covert of her wings For this purpose Reamur  contrived an  artificial mother  this is a box formed of sheeps skin the bottom of which is square and the upper part sloped like the top of a desk He places this box on one of the ends of the crib in such a situation that the chickens may enter easily and walk round the three sides at least he warms it below by means of a footstove which he refreshes occasionally The inclination of the cover of this kind of desk allows the chickens to place themselves according to their different sizes but as they have a practice especially when they are cold of pressing together and even climbing on each other and in this crowd the weak and small ones run the risk of being smothered this  artificial mother  is kept open at both ends or rather both ends are covered with a net which the least chicken can remove so as easily to escape when it feels itself too much squeezed and it can then by going round to the other hole chuse a less dangerous place Reamur endeavours to avoid even this inconvenience by another precaution which is to keep the cover sloped so low as to prevent the chickens from climbing on each other and he raises it gradually as they grow He improves still on this idea by dividing his largest cribs into two by means of a transverse partition so as to be able to separate the chickens of different sizes He even places the cribs on wheels that they may be easily transported for they must be brought into a chamber always in the evenings  and even during the daytime when the weather is bad and in winter this chamber must be warmed But when it is neither cold nor rainy the cribs ought to be exposed to the open air and the sun only taking the precaution of sheltering them from the wind The doors may even be left open and the chickens will soon learn to come out to scrape the dung or peck the tender grass and return to their food or to recover their warmth under their artificial mother If we would not hazard their sauntering at will we may place at the end of their crib an ordinary hencrib which communicating with the first will allow them a considerable space to roam in and at the same time prevent accidents  But the more we confine them the more regular we ought to be in giving them food Besides milletseeds yolks of eggs soup and crumbs of bread young poultry are fond of rapeseed hempseed and other small grains of that kind pease beans lentils rice shelled barley and oats chopped turkey beans and buckwheat It is proper and even oeconomical to burst most of these in boiling water before we offer them the saving amounts to a fifth on the wheat two fifths on the barley one half on the turkey beans but is nothing on the oats and buckwheat It would even be a loss to soak the barley but this grain is what the chickens shew the most indifference for Lastly after they have grown we  may give them every thing that we eat ourselves except bitter almonds  Ephemerides des Curieux de la Nature Dec an obs  and coffeebeans  Two chickens being fed the one on burnt coffee from the islands the other on fresh coffee they both grew consumptive and died the one on the eighth day and the other on the tenth after having eaten three ounces of coffee Their feet and legs were swelled and the gallbladder as large as that of a turkey cock  Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences  année p  Every kind of chopped flesh whether raw or boiled but particularly earthworms are proper they discover so great a liking for this sort of food that one would imagine that they are carnivorous and perhaps nothing is wanting to them as well as to many others but a hooked bill and claws to constitute them real birds of prey  It must however be admitted that poultry differ from birds of prey no less by their mode of digestion and the structure of their stomach than by their bill and their nails In these the stomach is membranous and digestion is effected by means of a solvent which varies in different species but the action of which is well ascertained  Memories de l'Academie Royale des Sciences an p  whereas the gallinaceous tribe may be considered as having three stomachs  viz  The craw which is a kind of membranous bag where the grains are first macerated and begin to be reduced to a pap The widest part of the canal lying between the craw and the gizzard but nearest the last it is lined with a  number of small glands which furnish a liquor that the food imbibes in its passage Lastly The gizzard which yields a liquor that is manifestly acid since the internal coat being soaked in water becomes an excellent runnet for curdling milk This third stomach completes by the powerful action of its muscles what had only been begun in the two first The force of its fibres is greater than could be conceived in less than four hours a ball of glass which could sustain a pressure of four pounds is reduced to an impalpable powder In fortyeight hours several tubes of glass four lines in diameter and one line thick were divided longitudinally into two kinds of rents and at the end of that time all the sharp edges were ground down and the polish destroyed particularly on the convex part The gizzard was also able to flatten tubes of tinned iron and in the space of twentyfour hours to crush seventeen nuts and this was effected by repeated compressions and alternate attrition the mechanism of which it is difficult to perceive Reaumur who made several trials to discover it never could distinguish but once any considerable motions in that part He saw in a capon the gizzard of which he had brought into view portions contracting and sinking and again swelling he observed a kind of fleshy chords which formed on the surface or rather appeared to be forming because he made incisions between them which separated them and  all these motions appeared to be propagated in waves and very slowly  What proves that in gallinaceous birds digestion is performed chiefly by the action of the muscles of the gizzard and not by the power of any solvent is that if one of these be made to swallow a small lead tube open at both ends but so thick as to resist the compression of the gizgard and into which a grain of barley be introduced the tube will be found in the space of two days to have lost considerably of its weight but the grain inclosed though it were boiled and shelled will then be discovered to be somewhat swelled but as little altered as if it had been left the same time in another place equally humid whereas the same grain and others that are much harder if not protected by a tube would be digested in much less time  One circumstance which may assist the action of the gizzard is that birds keep the cavity as full as possible and thus the four muscles of which it consists are thrown into play When grain is wanting they cramb it with herbage and even small flints the hardness and roughness of which contribute to bruise the grain against which they are incessantly rubbed I say by their roughness for when they are polished they quickly pass through the body and those with rugged surfaces only remain They are the more numerous in the gizzard the scarcer the food is and they continue in it a longer  time than any other substance whether digestible or indigestible  We shall not be surprised that the inner coat of this stomach is strong enough to resist the reaction of so many hard bodies on which it constantly grinds if we consider that it is really very thick and of a substance analogous to horn Besides we know that bits of wood and leather which are rubbed with an extremely hard powder to polish bodies last for a very long time  We may also suppose that this membrane is renewed in the same manner as the callous skin of labourers hands  But though the small stones may assist digestion it is not asserted that the granivorous birds have a decided view in swallowing them Redi having shut up two capons with water and little pebbles for their food they drank much water and died the one in twenty days the other in twentyfour and both of them without having swallowed a single stone Redi found many in the gizzard but these were what had been swallowed before  The organs that are destined for respiration consist of lungs similar to those of the land animals with ten air cells eight of which are within the breast and communicate directly with the lungs and two larger ones in the lower belly and which communicate with the eight preceding When in inspiration the thorax is dilated the air enters by the larynx into the lungs thence  into the eight upper air cells which dilating inhale that also of the two cells of the lower belly and these suffer a proportional collapse When on the contrary the lungs and upper cells contracting during expiration press the air included in their cavity it escapes partly through the larynx and partly returns from the eight cells in the breast into the two in the lower belly which then dilate by a mechanism nearly analogous to that of a double bellows But this is not the proper place to explain the mechanism it will be sufficient to observe that in those birds which never fly as the cassowary the ostrich c and in those that fly tardily such as the gallinaceous tribe the fourth cell on each side is the smallest  Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire les Animaux    All these differences in the structure necessarily imply many others not to speak of the membranous tubes that are observed in some birds Duverney has shewn from an experiment made on a living cock that the voice in these birds is formed not near the larynx as in the quadrupeds but below the  trachea arteria  near the forking at which place Perrault perceived an internal larynx Herissant observed in the principal bronchial vessels of the lungs semilunar membranes placed transversely one above another in such a manner that they only occupied the half of the cavity of these vessels and allowed  the air a free passage through the other half and he justly concludes that these membranes must contribute to the formation of the voice though their assistance is not so essential as that of the osseous coat of the crescent which terminates a considerable cavity above the superior and internal part of the breast and which has also some communication with the upper air cells This anatomist affirms that he has ascertained by repeated trials that if this coat be perforated the voice is immediately impaired and can be restored only by closing the hole accurately to vent the escape of the air  Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences  année  page    After observing such wide differences in the conformation of the organs of the voice will it not appear singular that birds with a tongue of cartilage and lips of horn should imitate our songs and even our speech more easily than those among the quadrupeds that resemble man the most So difficult it is to judge of the use of the parts from their mere structure and so true that the modification of the voice and of sounds depends almost entirely on the sensibility of the ear  The intestinal canal is very long in the gallinaceous tribe and exceeds about five times that of the animal reckoning from the point of the bill to the  anus  We find two  caeca  about six inches in length which take their rise where the  colon  joins the  ileon  the  rectum  widens towards its extremity and forms a common receptacle into which the solid and fluid excrements are separately discharged and from which they are ejected together though not intimately mixed The organs characteristic of the sexes are also perceived viz in hens the  vulva  or orisice of the  oviductus  and in Cocks the two yards that is the paps of the two spermatic vessels The  vulva  as we have before mentioned is placed above the  anus  and consequently the disposition of these parts which obtains in quadrupeds is reversed  It was known in the time of Aristotle that the Cock had testicles concealed within its body The ancients even ascribed to this situation the fiery passion of the male for the female who is less ardent they alleged because the ovarium being placed near the diaphragm is more apt to be cooled by the accession of the air respired  Aristotle  de Partibus Animalium  lib iv  But the testicles are not so exclusively appropriated to the male as not to be found in the females of some species of birds as in the little bustard and perhaps in the great bustard  Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences  année  p  Sometimes the male has only one but generally two the bulk of these kinds of glands is far from being proportioned to that of the bird In the eagle they are only of the size of peas in  a Cock of four months old they are as large as olives The bulk varies not only between one species and another but between different individuals of the same species and is most expanded in the season of love But how diminutive soever be their size they produce mighty effects in the animal oeconomy as is evinced by the wonderful changes effected by their extirpation This operation is commonly performed when the bird is three or four months old After emasculation it grows plumper and its flesh becomes more juicy and delicate and when subjected to a chemical analysis yields different products from what it would have given before castration  The extract of the lean of a capon is somewhat less than the fortieth part of its total weight whereas it amounts to one twelfth in a pullet and rather more than one seventh in a Cock Besides the extract of Cock's flesh is very dry while it is difficult to separate the humidity from that of a capon  Memoires de l'Acad Royale des Sciences  année p  The capon is no longer liable to moult in the same manner as the buck when degraded from his sex never casts his antlers The note is altered his voice is broken and seldom heard treated roughly by the Cocks with disdain by the females deprived of all the appetites related to generation it is not only excluded from the society of its equals but extruded as it were from its species It is an idle solitary outcast all whose powers are directed on itself and whose sole object is its individual  preservation to eat to sleep to fatten are its principal employments and constitute the sum of its wants But by a little attention we can draw advantage from its weakness and even its consequent docility by giving it useful habits For instance we can teach it to rear and tend young chickens For this purpose it must be kept some days in a dark place only bringing it out at regular hours to feed and accustoming it gradually to the sight and company of a few chickens that are pretty stout it will soon contract a fondness for them and will lead them with as much affection and assiduity as their mother It will even conduct a greater number than a hen for its wings spread and afford more shelter and the hen freed from its toil and solicitude will soon begin again to lay and thus the capon though condemned to sterility will still contribute indirectly to the preservation and multiplication of its species  So great a change produced in the character of the capon by a cause so weak and apparently so inadequate to the effect is the more remarkable as it is confirmed by an immense number of trials which men have made on other species and have even dared to extend to their brethren of the human race  The Cock has been the subject of another experiment that is far less cruel but perhaps no less important for the science of physiology it  is after cutting the comb  The reason why thè capon's comb is cut is that after emasculation it does not stand erect but becomes pendulous and would therefore prove inconvenient by hiding an eye  as usual to substitute in its stead one of the young spurs which has just begun to shoot thus engrafted it gradually strikes root into the flesh thence extracts its nourishment and often grows more luxuriantly than it would in its natural place Some have attained to two inches and a half in length and more than three lines and a half in diameter at the base sometimes they are twisted round like the horns of a ram at other times bent backwards like those of a hegoat  Anciens Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences tom xi p  Journal Economique  Mars  p    This is a kind of animal engrafting the success of which would appear very doubtful when first tried but from which since the success is known it is astonishing that no practical information has been derived In general the destructive experiments have been more studied and pursued with more ardour than those which are directed to preservation because man is fonder of pleasure and expence than the acquisition of knowledge and the exercise of beneficence Chickens are not hatched with that crest and those reddish membranes which distinguish them from other birds It is a month after they have left the shell before these parts begin to unfold at two months old the young  Cocks crow and fight with one another They feel that they must hate each other though the source of their dislike has yet no existence It is commonly five or six months before they shew any passion for the hens and that these begin to lay In both sexes the complete term of their growth is a year or fifteen months The young hens it is said lay more but the old ones are better sitters This period of their growth would imply that the ordinary extent of their life does not exceed seven or eight years if the same proportion subsisted in birds as in quadrupeds But we have seen that this is much longer a Cock will live twenty years in the domestic condition and perhaps thirty years in the state of liberty Unfortunately for them we have no interest in suffering them to reach to a great age The hens and capons that are destined for the table never enjoy above one year's existence and most of them have only one season Those which are selected for the multiplication of the species become soon exhausted and none are permitted to finish the period assigned by nature so that it is a singular accident that cocks have ever been seen to die of age  Poultry can subsist in all places under the protection of man and accordingly they are spread over the whole inhabited world The better sort of people breed hens in Iceland  Horrebow's Description of Iceland    where they lay as in other parts and the warm countries abound with them But according to Dr Thomas Hyde  Historia Religionis veterum Persarum  Observe however that the art of fattening capons was introduced by the Armenian merchants into Persia from Europe as appears from Tavernier  Persia is the native region of Cocks there they are numerous and held in great estimation especially by certain dervises who consider them as living clocks and it is well known that a clock is the soul of every society of dervises  Dampier says that he saw and killed in the islands of Poulocondor wild Cocks that were not larger than our crows and whose crow was much like that of our dunghill Cocks only shriller In another part he adds that there are some in the island of Timor and at St Jago one of the Cape de Verd islands Gemelli Carreri relates that he observed some in the Philippines and Merolla asserts that there are wild hens in the kingdom of Congo which are more beautiful and have a more delicate flavour than our domestic kind but that the Negroes set little value on these birds  From their native climate wheresoever it be these birds have spread over the extent of the ancient Continent from China to Cape Verd and from the Southern Ocean to the Seas of the North These migrations were performed in remote ages far beyond the reach of historical  tradition But their settlement in the New World seems to be a much more recent event The historian of the Incas informs us that there were none at Peru before its conquest and that after a residence of more than thirty years the hens could not be habituated to hatch in the valley of Cusco Coreal positively asserts that poultry were introduced by the Spaniards into Brazil and that the inhabitants of that country would eat none of them and looked upon their eggs as a kind of poison Nor according to the testimony of F Charlevoix had the natives of St Domingo any and Oviedo considers it as a certain fact that they were carried from Europe to America Acosta indeed maintains the opposite opinion that hens existed in Peru before the arrival of the Spaniards and alleges as a proof that the natives call the bird in their language  gualpa  and its egg  ponto  But the antiquity of the word is not sufficient to establish that of the thing denoted for it is easy to conceive that savages the first time they saw a strange bird would naturally give it a name either from its resemblance to some bird with which they were acquainted or from some other analogy What would determine me in favour of the first opinion is the conformity to the law of the climate This law though it cannot be applied in general to birds especially those which are vigorous on the wing and to which all countries are open yet regulates those  which like the poultry being bulky and having an aversion to water can neither waft their course through the air like the birds that soar nor cross the seas nor even the large rivers like the quadrupeds that swim and would therefore be for ever excluded but for the interference of man from those countries which are separated by an immense ocean The Cock is then an animal which belongs peculiarly to the Ancient Continent and ought to be added to the list that I have given of all those animals which existed not in the New World before it was discovered  In proportion as hens are removed from their native region and accustomed to another climate and different food they must suffer some alteration in their shape or rather in the parts most susceptible of change Hence undoubtedly those varieties that constitute the different breeds which I am to describe varieties which are constantly perpetuated in each climate whether from the continued action of the same causes that produced them at first or from the attention that is paid in matching the individuals selected for propagation  It is to be wished that we could here form as in the case of the dog a kind of genealogical tree of all families of the Cock which would point out the primitive stock and its different branches and represent the various orders of alterations and changes corresponding to its different  states But this would require more accurate and more minute accounts than those in our possession I shall therefore content myself with giving my opinion in regard to the hen of our own climate and shall endeavour to examine into it's origin but previous to this inquiry I shall enumerate the foreign breeds that have been described by naturalists or only mentioned by travellers    The Common Cock  That of our own climate    The Crested Cock  It is distinguished from the Common Cock by a tuft of feathers rising on the head and by its comb which is generally smaller probably because the food instead of being spent on the comb alone is partly distributed to nourish the feathers Some travellers assert that the Mexican poultry are crested these as well as all the rest on the continent of America have been introduced from the ancient continent The breed of the crested hens is that which the curious have most cultivated and what generally happens when things are closely examined they have observed a great number of differences particularly in the colours of their plumage which serve to distinguish a multitude of races that are the more esteemed in proportion to the beauty and rareness of their tints Such are the gold and silver ones the blackcrested white ones the whitecrested black ones the agate the chamois and  the slaty those with fishscales and the ermined the widowhen which has small white tears sprinkled on a sallow ground the flamecoloured the stony sort whose plumage has a white ground spotted with black chamois slaty or golden c But I suspect that these differences are not so invariable or so deeply impressed as to constitute real distinct species as some curious people pretend who assert that many of the above breeds never intermix    The Wild Cock of Asia  This is undoubtedly what approaches the nearest to the original stock of our common kind for never being fettered by man or thwarted in the choice of its food or mode of life what could ever alter its native purity It is neither the largest nor the smallest of its species but is intermediate between the extremes It is found as we have already observed in many countries of Asia in Africa and in the Cape de Verd islands We have no description of it so complete as to enable us to compare it with our Cock I must here recommend to travellers who have an opportunity of seeing this wild breed to inquire if they construct nests and in what manner Lottinger physician of Strasburg who has made many important observations on birds informs me that our hens when left to themselves build nests and with as much care as the partridges    The Acoho  or  Madagascar Cock  This species is very small and the eggs still less in proportion for the birds can hatch thirty at a time  Histoire Generale des Voyages tom viii      The Dwarf Hen of Java  It is of the size of a pigeon  Collection Academique partie etrangere tom iii  probably the Little English Hen which is still smaller than the Dwarf Hen of France is of the same kind We may perhaps add the Small Hen of Pegu which travellers describe as not larger than a middlesized turtle its feet scaly and its plumage beautiful    The Hen of the Isthmus of Darien  It is smaller than the common sort has a circle of feathers round its legs an exceeding thick tail which it carries erect and it crows before breakofday    Cambogia Hens  Carried by the Spaniards from that kingdom into the Philippines Their feet are so short that their wings trail on the ground It is very like the Dwarf Hen of France or perhaps that Dwarf Hen that is reared in Britanny on account of its fecundity and which constantly hops in its gait    The Bantam Cock  It has much resemblance to the Roughfooted Cock of France Its feet are covered with feathers but only on the  outside The plumage of the legs is very long and forms a sort of boots which reach a considerable way beyond the claws It is courageous and resolutely fights with one stronger than itself Its iris is red I have been informed that most of this breed have no tuft There is a large kind of roughfooted Cocks that comes from England and another smaller termed the  English Dwarf Cock  which is of a fine gold colour with a double comb  There is still another sort of dwarfs which exceeds not the size of a common pigeon and whose plumage is sometimes white sometimes mixed with white and gold colour  The Dutch speak of another kind of Cocks peculiar to the island of Java where they are seldom reated but for fighting they call it the  HalfHen of Java  According to Willoughby it carries its tail nearly like the turkey To this family we must refer those singular hens of Java mentioned by Mandeslo which resemble the common and Indian kinds and that fight desperately with each other like cocks The Sieur Fournier informs me that one of this species is still living at Paris it has according to him neither comb nor ruff the head is simple like that of the pheasant This hen is very high on its legs its tail is long and pointed and the feathers of unequal length and in general the colour of the feathers is auburn like those of the vulture    The English Cock  is not larger than the Dwarf Cock but is much taller than our Common Cock and this is what principally distinguishes it We may also class with it the  Xolo  Gemelli Carreri  a kind of Philippine Cock which has very long legs Besides the English Cock excels the French in fighting it has rather a tuft than a crest its neck and bill are more slender and above the nostrils there are two fleshy protuberances which are red like the comb    The Turkish Cock  is remarkable only for its fine plumage    The Hamburgh Cock  named also  the Velvet Breeches  because its thighs and belly are of a soft black Its demeanour is grave and stately its iris is yellow and its eyes are encircled with a ring of brown feathers from which rises a black tuft that covers the ears There are other feathers nearly like these behind the comb and beneath the barbils and broad round black spots on the breast His legs and feet are of a lead colour excepting the sole of the foot which is yellowish    The Frizzled Cock  whose feathers have a reversed position They are found in Java Japan and the whole of the south of Asia This bird belongs more peculiarly to the warm countries for chickens of this breed are extremely sensible to cold and can hardly support that  of our climate The Sieur Fournier assures me that their plumage assumes all sorts of colours white black silvery golden and slate tints    The Silky Hen of Japan  The feathers are white and their webs are parted and pretty much resemble hair Its feet are clothed with plumage on the outside as far as the nail of the outer toe This breed is found in Japan China and in some other countries of Asia To propagate it in all its purity requires that both the parents be covered with down    The Negro Cock  has its comb barbils epidermis and periosteum absolutely black Its plumage also is generally black but sometimes white It is found in the Philippines in Java Delhi and at St Jago one of the Cape de Verd islands Becman affirms that most of the birds in the last mentioned place have bones as black as jet and a skin black like that of a negroe  Dampier  If this fact be true we must impute it to the tinging quality of their food We know the effects of madder and other plants of that genus and we are informed that in England the veal is whitened by feeding the calves with grain and other soft aliments mixed with a certain earth or chalk found in the county of Bedford  Journal Economique  Mai    It would therefore be curious to discover at St Jago among the different substances which these birds eat that which tinges the  periosteum  black This negroe hen is also known in France and propagates  there but as its flesh after being dressed is black and unpalatable it is not likely that the race will be multiplied When it crosses the breed with others varieties of different colours are produced but which commonly retain the comb and the ruffs or black barbils and even the membrane that forms the little ear is tinged with a blackish hue on the outside    The Rumpless Cock  or  the Persian Cock  of some authors Most of the hens and Cocks in Virginia have no rump and yet they are undoubtedly of the English breed The inhabitants of that colony affirm that when these birds are imported they soon lose the rump  Philosophical Transactions for No  If this be admitted as a fact the variety in question ought to be called  Virginian  and not  Persian Cocks  especially as they were unknown to the ancients and the moderns have not noticed them till after the discovery of America We have mentioned that the European dogs which have pendulous ears lose their voice and that their ears become erect when they are carried into tropical climates This singular change produced by the excessive heat of those torrid regions is not however so great as the loss of the rump and tail in the gallinaceous tribe But it appears to me much more curious that as these two tribes of animals are the most domestic of all and therefore the widest removed from their  natural condition so there is breed of dogs without a tail as there is of Cocks without a rump Several years ago I was shewn one of these dogs that had been whelped without a tail but which I then conceived to be a degraded individual a monster and for that reason I took no notice of it in the history of the canine genus I have again considered the subject and I am now confident that it is a constant and invariable race like that of the Rumpless Cock This breed of Cocks has a blue bill and feet a single or double comb but no crest the plumage is variegated with all the colours and the Sieur Fournier assures me that when it couples with the ordinary kind a halfrumped sort are produced with six feathers in the tail instead of twelveThis may be true but I can hardly believe it    The Hen with five toes  is as we have said a powerful objection to the system of classification founded on the number of toes This kind has five on each foot three before and two behind there are even some individuals that have six    The Hens of Sansevara  The eggs of this sort are sold in Persia for three or four crowns apiece and the Persians amuse themselves in striking them against one another as a kind of play In that country there are also Cocks much more beautiful and larger which are sold so high as crowns  Tavernier      The Cock of Caux  or of  Padua  Its distinguishing character is its magnitude Its comb is often double and in the shape of a crown and there is a kind of tuft which is more conspicuous in the hens Their voice is strong hollow raucous and their weight is from eight to ten pounds To this fine breed we may refer the large Cocks of Rhodes Persia  Chardin  Pegu  Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi à l'Etablissement de la Compagnie des Indes  tome  iii p  the bulky hens of Bahia which do not begin to be covered with feathers till they have attained half their size  Dampier's New Voyage  It is well known that the hens of Caux are not so soon feathered as the ordinary sort  It may be observed that a great number of birds mentioned by travellers by the names of Cock and Hen are of a quite different species Such are the  patonardes  or  palonardes  found near the Great Bank and which are so fond of cods liver  Recueil des Voyages du Nord  tome  iii p  the Cock and hen of Muscovy which are the male and female grous the red hen of Peru which is like the pheasant that large tufted hen of New Guinea whose plumage is of an azure blue which has a pigeon's bill and feet like those of the common poultry and which nestles in trees  Histoire generale des Voyages  tome  xi p  and is probably the Banda pheasant  the hen of Damietta which has a red bill and feet a small spot on the head of the same colour and plumage of a violet blue and which must be considered as a great waterfowl the hen of the Delta the rich colours of whose plumage Thevenot extols but which differs from the common sort not only by the shape of its bill and tail but by its natural habits since it is fond of marshes the Pharaoh hen which the same traveller affirms is not inferior to a fat hazel grous the hens of Corea which have a tail three feet long c  Amidst the immense number of different breeds of the gallinaceous tribe how shall we determine the original stock So many circumstances have operated so many accidents have concurred the attention and even the whim of man have so much multiplied the varieties that it appears extremely difficult to trace them to their source The Wild Cocks found in the warm countries of Asia may indeed be considered as the primeval stem in those regions But as in our temperate climates there is no wild bird that perfectly resembles the Domestic Cock we are at a loss on which of the varieties to confer the priority The pheasant the grous the woodhen are the only birds in the state of nature which are analogous to our poultry but it is uncertain if they would ever intermix and have prolific progeny and they have constituted distinct and separate species from the most  remote times Besides they want the combs the spurs and the pendulous membranes of the gallinaceous tribe If we exclude all the foreign and wild kinds we shall greatly diminish the number of varieties and the differences will be found to be slight The hens of Caux are almost double the bulk of the ordinary sort the English Cock though exactly like the French has much longer legs and feet others differ only in the length of their feathers others in the number of their toes others are distinguished by the beauty and singularity of their colours as the Turkish and Hamburgh hen and of these six varieties to which the common breed may be reduced three are to be ascribed to the influence of the climate that of Hamburgh that of Turkey and that of England perhaps also the fourth and fifth for the hen of Caux most probably came from Italy since it is also called the  hen of Padua  and the hen with five toes was known in Italy in the time of Columella Thus there only remain the Common Cock and the Crested Cock as the natural breed of our country and even in these the two sexes admit of all the variety of colour The constant character of the tuft seems to mark an improved species that is one better kept and better fed and consequently the common breed which has no tuft must be the true parent of our poultry It would appear that the primitive colour was white and that all the intermediate shades between  it and black were successively assumed What seems to corroborate this conjecture is an analogy which no person has yet remarked that the colour of the egg generally resembles that of the plumage of the bird Thus a raven's eggs are of a green brown spotted with black those of the kestril are red those of the cassowary dark green those of the black crow are of a still duller brown than those of the raven those of the variegated magpie are also variegated and spotted those of the great cinereous shrike spotted with grey those of the woodchat spotted with red those of the goatsucker mottled with bluish and brown spots on a cloudy whitish ground those of the sparrow cinereous entirely covered with chesnut spots on a grey ground those of the blackbird blackish blue those of the grous whitish spotted with yellow those of the pintados speckled like their plumage with white round spots c In short there seems to be an invariable relation subsisting between the colour of the egg and that of the plumage The tints are indeed much more dilute on the eggs and in most of them the white predominates but white is also in most cases the prevailing colour of the plumage especially in females and since hens of all colours white black grey tawney and mottled have white eggs there is reason to conclude that if they had remained in the state of nature white would at least have predominated in their plumage Domestication  has introduced various shades on the feathers but as these are only accidental and superficial they have not been able to penetrate internally or operate any change in the eggs  Specific character of the Cock

called it  Pavon de las Indias  i e  the Peacock of the Indies  because it spreads its tail like a Peacock The Italians term it  Gallo d'India  the Germans  Indianisch Han  the Poles  Indiyk  and the Swedes  Kalkon    Le Dindon  Buff  MeleagrisGallopavo  Linn Gmel c  Gallina Indiana  Zuin  Il Gallinacio  Cett  IF the Cock be the most useful bird in our courtyards the Turkey is the most distinguished by its bulk by the shape ofits head and certain natural habits possessed by few species Its head is very small in proportion to its body and is destitute of the usual decoration for it is almost entirely featherless and together with a part of the neck is only covered with a bluish skin beset with red fleshy  papillae  on the fore part of the neck and whitish  papillae  on the hind part of the head with some small straggling black hairs and a few feathers still more rare on the arch of the neck and which are thicker in the lower part a circumstance which has not been noticed by naturalists From the base of the bill a kind of red fleshy caruncle falls  loosely over a third part of the neck which at first sight appears single but when examined is found to be composed of a double membrane A fleshy protuberance of a conical shape and furrowed with deep transverse wrinkles rises from the bottom of the upper mandible This protuberance is scarcely more than an inch long in its natural state of contraction that is when the Turkey seeing no objects but those to which it is accustomed and feeling no inward agitation walks calmly seeking its food But on any unusual appearance especially in the season of love this bird which in its ordinary state is humble and tame swells with instant rage its head and neck become inflated the conical protuberance expands and descends two or three inches lower than the bill which it entirely covers All these fleshy parts assume at the same time a deeper red it bristles up the feathers on its neck and back spreads its tail like a fan while its wings drop and even trail on the ground In this attitude he sometimes struts around his female making a dull sound produced by the air escaping from the breast through the bill and followed by a long gabbling noise Sometimes he leaves his female to attack those who disturb him In both these cases his motions are composed but they become rapid the instant he utters the dull sound which we have mentioned He vents a shrill scream which every body knows which intermits from time to time and  which he may be made to repeat as often as one chooses by whistling or by forming any sharp tones He then begins again to wheel round which action according as it is directed to his female or pointed at the object that has provoked his displeasure expresses attachment or marks rage and it is observed that his fits are the most violent at the sight of red clothes he is then inflamed and becomes furious rushes on the person strikes with his bill and exerts himself to the utmost to remove an object whose presence he cannot endure  It is a curious and very singular fact that the conical caruncle which lengthens and is relaxed when the bird is agitated by the violence of passion is relaxed in the same manner after death  Some Turkies are white others variegated with black and white others with white and rusty yellow others are of an uniform grey which are the most uncommon of all But in the greater number the plumage verges on black with a little white near the ends of the feathers those which cover the back and the upper surface of the wings are square at the extremities and among those of the rump and even of the breast there are some with rainbow colours occasioned by the different rays being reflected according to the various degrees of incidence As they grow older the tints become more glossy and the reflections more diversified Many people imagine that white Turkies are the hardiest  and for this reason that breed is preferred in some provinces there are numerous flocks in Pertois in Champaign  The naturalists have reckoned twentyeight quills in each wing and eighteen in the tail But what is much more striking and what will readily distinguish this species from any other yet known is a lock of hard black hair five or six inches long which in our temperate climates rises from the lower part of the neck in the grown male Turkey on the second year and sometimes about the end of the first and before it appears the place where it emerges is marked by a fleshy prominence Linnaeus says that this hair does not sprout till the third year in the Turkeys bred in Sweden If the fact be certain it would follow that this production is the slower in proportion to the rigour of the climate and indeed one of the principal effects of cold is to check every sort of growth This lock of hair is the foundation of the epithet of bearded  pectore barbato  which has been applied to the Turkey an expression in every respect improper for it does not grow from the breast but from the lower part of the neck and besides it is not sufficient that there are hairs they ought never to receive the name of beard unless they rise from the chin as in Edwards's bearded vulture  We should form an inaccurate idea of the tail of the Turkeycock if we imagined that all the  feathers of which it is composed can equally be spread like a fan In fact he has two tails an upper and an under one the first consists of eighteen broad feathers inserted round the rump and which are erected when the bird struts about the second or lower one is formed of others which are not so broad and remains always in a horizontal position The male is also distinguished by a spur on each foot which is of various lengths but always shorter and softer than in common cocks  IN the female not only the spurs and the lock of hair hanging from the lower part of the neck are wanting but also the conical caruncle is shorter and admits of no extension both this caruncle barbil and the glandulous flesh that sheaths the head are of a paler red she is smaller also and has less expression less resolution and less vigour of action her cry is only a plaintive accent she never stirs but to seek food or to fly before danger finally she cannot perform the strutting evolutions not because she has not the double tail of the male but on account of the want of the  elevator  muscles which erect the very large feathers that compose the upper fan  In the male as in the female the nostrils are situated in the upper mandible the ears are placed behind the eyes thickly covered and as it were darkened by a multitude of little divided feathers pointed in different directions  It will readily be supposed that the best Cock is the strongest the liveliest and the most vigorous in all his movements Five or six females may be entrusted to his care If there are several males they will fight with each other but not with the furious obstinacy of ordinary cocks these even attack Turkies which are double their size and kill them in the combat The subjects of the contention are equally compliant to the males of both species if as Sperling says the Turkeycock when deprived of his females pays his addresses to the common hens and the Turkeyhens in the absence of their males offer their favours to the ordinary cock and eagerly solicit his potent embrace  Zoologia Physica p    The battles which the Turkeycocks fight among themselves are far less vigorous the vanquished does not always fly from the field of battle and sometimes he is even preferred by the females It has been observed that though a white Turkey was beat by a black one all the chickens were white  The Turkies perform copulation nearly in the same way as ordinary cocks only it lasts longer Hence perhaps the reason that the male is not equal to so many females and is sooner worn out I have already mentioned on the authority of Sperling that he sometimes  mixes with common hens the same author asserts that when his females are taken from him he not only couples with the peahen which may happen but also with the ducks which seems to me to be less probable  The Turkeyhen is not so prolific as the common hen She must from time to time be fed with hempseed oats and buckwheat to make her lay and after all she seldom has more than one hatch of fifteen eggs ayear When she has two which is very uncommon the first is about the end of winter and the second in the month of August The eggs are white with some small spots of reddishyellow and their structure is nearly the same as in those of the common hen The Turkeyhen will also hatch the eggs of all sorts of birds We may know when she wants to sit for she remains in the nest and in order to fix her attachment the place must be dry with a good aspect according to the season and not too much exposed for instinct leads her to conceal herself with the greatest care when she covers  Those of a year old are generally the best sitters and they are so intent that they would die upon their eggs from mere inanition if we were not at pains to remove them once aday and give them food and drink This passion for hatching is so powerful and so durable that they sometimes have two nests in succession without the least interruption but in  such cases they must be supported by richer food The cock has a very opposite instinct for if he sees the female covering he breaks the eggs which he regards probably as an obstacle to his pleasures  Sperling  Ibid  and for this reason it is perhaps that the female is so industrious in concealing her nest  After the full time when the young Turkies are about to burst into day they pierce with their bill the shell of the egg in which they are inclosed but it is sometimes so hard that they would perish if not assisted by crushing it and this must be effected with great caution following as closely as possible the natural process If roughly handled in their tender moments if suffered to endure hunger or if exposed to inclement weather though they may survive for the time they will pine away and soon perish Cold rain and even dew occasions lingering sickness the rays of a bright sun strike them with instant death and sometimes they are crushed even under the feet of their mother such are the dangers which threaten the life of this delicate bird This cause joined to the inferior fecundity of the Turkeyhens in Europe is the reason why this species is much less numerous than that of the common poultry  After their extrication from the shell the young Turkies ought to be kept in a warm and  dry place where there is spread a broad layer of dung well trodden and when we would bring them out into the open air we should do it by degrees and chuse the finest days  The young Turkies instinctively prefer picking out of the hand to feeding in any other way We judge by their chirping when they want to eat which is frequent They ought to be presented with food four or five times aday their first nourishment should be wine and water which must be blown into their bill and afterwards a few crumbs of bread may be mixed with it On the fourth day eggs spoiled in hatching may be given beat up with bits of bread and these addled eggs whether they be hens or Turkies are found to afford a salutary nourishment  Journal Economique  Aôut  p  Towards the tenth or twelfth day the eggs are omitted and in their stead are used chopped nettles mixed with millet or with the flour of Turkey beans of barley of wheat or of buckwheat or at least if we would save the grain without hurting the brood with curdled milk burdock a little stinking camomile nettleseed and bran Afterwards it will be sufficient to give them all sorts of decayed fruits cut into bits  Id ibidem  especially the berries of brambles and of white mulberries c When we perceive them having a languishing appearance  we must dip their bills into wine to make them drink a little and at the same time oblige them to swallow a grain of pepper Sometimes they appear benumbed and motionless when they have been overtaken by a cold rain and they would infallibly die if we were not careful to wrap them in warm rags and blow repeatedly into them warm air through their bill They must be visited from time to time to pierce the small bladders that collect under the tongue and about the rump and to give them rustwater it is even recommended to bathe their head with this water to prevent certain diseases to which they are subject but in that case it must be wiped and dried very carefully for it is well known that humidity of every kind is hurtful to Turkies in their tender age  The mother leads them with the same solicitude that the hen leads her chickens she warms them under her wings with the same affection and protects them with the same courage It would seem that tenderness for her offspring gives quickness to her sight she descries a bird of prey at a prodigious distance when it is yet invisible to every other eye As soon as she perceives her dreaded enemy she vents her fears by a scream that spreads terror through the whole brood each little Turkey seeks refuge under a bush or squats in the herbage and the mother keeps them in that situation by her cries  so long as danger is impending but when her apprehensions are removed she informs them by a different note and calls them from their concealments to assemble round her  When the Turkies are newly hatched their head is shaded with a kind of down but they have still no glandulous flesh or barbils It requires six weeks or two months till these parts develope or as it is vulgarly said before the Turkies  put forth the red  Pousser le rouge  This is as critical a period with them as that of dentition is with children and then especially wine ought to be mixed with their ordinary food to strengthen them A short while before this they have begun to perch  It is seldom that Turkies are subjected to castration as ordinary cocks are they fatten very well without suffering that operation and their flesh is no less delicate another proof that their temperament is not so hot as that of common poultry  When they have grown hardy they leave their mother or rather they are abandoned by her The more tender and delicate they were in their infancy they become in time the more robust and the more capable of supporting the inclemency of the weather They are fond of perching in open air and thus pass whole nights in the rigours of winter sometimes resting on  one foot and drawing up the other to keep it warm as it were under the ventral feathers at other times on the contrary crouching on the branch and keeping their bodies in equilibrium They lay their head under the wing when they go to sleep and during their repose the motion of respiration is very perceptible  The best way of training Turkies after they are grown stout is to allow them to ramble in the fields where nettles and other plants which they are fond of are plentiful or to admit them into the orchards when the fruit begins to drop c But we must be attentive to restrain them from those pastures that bear plants hurtful to them such as the great foxglove with red flowers this plant is a real poison to Turkies those that eat it are thrown into a kind of intoxication vertigoes and convulsions and when the quantity is large they languish and die We cannot therefore be too careful in extirpating this noxious plant from those places where Turkies are raised  Histoire de l'Academie Royale des Sciences des Paris  année  p    We should also be careful especially in their early infancy not to suffer them to go abroad in the morning till the sun has dried the dew and to shut them up before the fall of the evening damps they must likewise be confined  in the shade during the violent heats of the summer's day Each evening when they return to roost they must be fed on paste of grain or on some other food except in harvest when they have gathered enough in the fields As they are extremely timid they are easily led the very shadow of a switch is sufficient to drive large flocks and they will often run from an animal that is much smaller and much weaker than themselves There are occasions however when they discover courage especially in their defence against the assaults of polecats and other foes of the poultry Sometimes even they surround a hare in his seat and strive to kill him by striking with their bill  Salerne    They have different tones and different inflexions of voice according to their age their sex and the various passions by which they are influenced their pace is slow their flight tardy they drink eat and swallow small pebbles nearly as the cocks do and have also a double stomach that is a craw and a gizzard but as they are much larger the muscles of the gizzard are also much stronger  The length of the intestines is nearly quadruple that of the bird reckoning from the tip of the bill to the end of the rump they have two  caeca  both turned forwards and which taken together constitute more than a fourth of  the whole alimentary canal these take their rise near the extremity and the excrements contained in their cavity differ but little from those included within the  colon  and  rectum  these excrements do not remain at all in the common  cloaca  as the urine and that white sediment which is always found where the urine passes and they have consistence enough to receive shape in their extrusion from the  anus  The parts of generation are nearly the same in Turkies as in common cocks but they seem to be much less vigorous in their performance The males are not so ardent for the females their embraces are less frequent and less expeditious and the females at least in our climate lay much later and have much fewer eggs  As the eyes of birds have in some respects a different organization from those of man and of quadrupeds it may be proper to mention the chief distinctions Besides the upper and under eyelids the Turkies as well as most other birds have still a third called the internal eyelid  membrana nictitans  which draws itself back into the shape of a crescent in the large angle of the eye and whose quick and frequent twinklings are effected by a curious muscular contrivance The upper eyelid is almost entirely immoveable but the lower can shut the eye by rising to the upper which scarcely ever happens except when the animal is asleep These two eyelids have each a lachrymal point but  no cartilaginous margins the  cornea  is transparent encircled by an osseous ring consisting of about fifteen scales overlapping each other like the tiles of a roof The crystalline lens is harder than in man but softer than in the quadrupeds or fishes  Memoires de l'Academie Royale des Sciences  année  p  and its posterior surface is the most convex  Id année  p  Lastly the optic nerve sends off between the retina and the choröid coat a black membrane of a rhomboidal figure consisting of parallel fibres which stretch through the vitreous humour and are attached sometimes directly to the interior angle of the crystalline capsule and sometimes are connected by the intervention of a filament branching from it It is to this subtile and transparent membrane that the academicians have given the name of  purse  though it has scarcely any resemblance to that in the Turkey and still less in the cock the goose the duck the pigeon c and its use according to Petit is to absorb the rays of light that come from the lateral objects and which intermingling with the others would render vision obscure  Id année  p  However this may be certain it is that the organ of sight is more complex in birds than in quadrupeds and as we have before shewn that this sense is possessed by the feathered race in a higher degree than what obtains in other animals we must  ascribe the superiority to its difference of structure and to its more perfect organization but to state the precise effect would require a more profound study of comparative anatomy and of the animal oeconomy  If we compare the relations of travellers we cannot hesitate to conclude that Turkies are natives of America and of the adjacent islands and that before the discovery of the New Continent there existed none in the Old  Father du Tertre observes that the Antilles are their congenial abode and that if a little care be bestowed they will there hatch three or four times in the year  Histoire Generale des Antilles  tome  ii p  But it is a general principle that all animals multiply fastest and grow largest and stoutest in their original residence and this is exactly what takes place with regard to the Turkies in America Immense numbers we are told by the Jesuit missionaries inhabit near the river Illinois  Lettres Edifiantes xxiii p  flocks of an hundred sometimes even of two hundred are seen at once They are much larger than those in Europe and weigh even thirtysix pounds Josselin affirms that some are sixty pounds  New England Rarities p  They are no less plentiful in Canada where according to Fathers Theodat and Recollet the savages call them  Ondettoutaques  in Mexico in New England in the vast country watered by the Mississippi and in the  Brazils where they pass by the name of  Arignanoussou  Voyage au Bresil recuelli par de Lery p  Dr Hans Solane saw some in Jamaica and he remarks that in almost all these countries they are in the wild state and swarm at some distance from the plantations and but gradually retire from the encroachments of the European settlers  But if most travellers and observers agree that Turkies are natives of America especially of the northern part of that continent they are no less unanimous in opinion that there are extremely few or none of these birds in the whole of Asia  Gemelli Careri informs us that not only there were none originally in the Philippine Islands but that those introduced by the Spaniards from Mexico did not thrive  Father du Halde assures us that none are to be found in the empire of China except what have been carried thither  Histoire Generale des Voyages  tome  vi p  It is true indeed that this Jesuit supposes in the same place that these birds are common in the East Indies but it would seem that this is only a supposition founded on report whereas he was an eyewitness of the fact that he relates with respect to China  Father de Bourzes another Jesuit says that there are none in the kingdom of Madura which lies in the peninsula on this side of the Ganges and he therefore concludes with probability that  it is the West Indies that have given name to this bird  Indian Cock  See his letter of the st September among the  Lettres Edifiantes    Dampier saw none at Mindanao  New Voyage vol i  Chardin and Tavernier who travelled over Asia affirm positively that there are no Turkies in the whole of that vast country  Voyages de Chardin  tome  ii p  Voyages de Tavernier  tome  ii p  According to Tavernier the Armenians introduced them into Persia where however they have not succeeded well the Dutch carried them to Batavia where they have thrived exceedingly  Finally Bosman and some other travellers tell us that if Turkies be ever seen in the country of Congo on the Gold Coast at Senegal or in other parts of Africa it is only at the factories and with strangers the natives making little use of them According to the same travellers their Turkies are evidently descended from those carried thither by the Portuguese and other Europeans along with other poultry  Bosman    I will not dissemble that Aldrovandus Gesner Belon and Ray have affirmed that Turkies were natives of Africa or of the East Indies and though their opinion on this subject is at present little regarded I conceive that it is a duty which I owe to these great names not to reject it without some discussion  Aldrovandus has attempted to prove at great length that Turkies are the  Meleagrides  of the ancients or the African or Numidian Hens whose plumage was covered with round spots like drops  Gallinae Numidicae guttatae  but it is evident and every body is now agreed on the subject that these are really our  pintados  which indeed come fromAfrica but which are quite different from Turkies It would therefore be needless to dwell more particularly on the opinion of Aldrovandus which in fact carries its refutation along with it and yet Linnaeus seems inclined to perpetuate or renew the error by applying to the Turkey the name of  Meleagris  Ray who maintains that Turkies have derived their origin from Africa or the East Indies seems to have suffered himself to be deceived by names That of the bird of  Numidia  which he adopts implies an African descent that of  Turkey  and the  Bird of Calecut  denotes an Asiatic extraction But no proof can be drawn from the name bestowed by illinformed people or even the scientific term imposed by philosophers who are not always exempted from prejudices Besides Ray himself admits with Dr Sloane that these birds delight in the warm countries of America and there multiply prodigiously  Synopsis Avium Append p    With regard to Gesner he admits indeed that most of the ancients and among others Aristotle  and Pliny were totally unacquainted with Turkies but he supposes that in the following quotation Aelian had them in view  India  says this ancient  produces a sort of very large cocks whose comb is not red like that of ours but so rich and variegated as to resemble a crown of flowers the feathers of the tail are not arched nor bent into circles but flat and when they are not erected they trail like those of the peacock their plumage is of an emerald colour  But it does not appear that this passage relates to Turkey Cocks for The size does not prove the point it being well known that in Asia and especially in Persia and at Pegu the common cocks are exceedingly large  This comb composed of various colours is alone sufficient to overturn the opinion since Turkies have never any comb and what is here described is not a tuft of feathers but a real comb similar to that of the ordinary cock though of a different colour  The manner it holds its tail resembling the peacock is equally inconclusive for Aelian positively says that the bird which he is describing carries its tail like the peacock  when it does not erect it  and if there had been an erection accompanied with a wheeling motion Aelian would not have omitted a character so singular and which forms so striking a resemblance to the peacock  with which he was at the same instant drawing a comparison  Lastly The emerald colour of the plumage is not sufficient to decide whether the description refers to the Turkey though some of its feathers have that tinge and in certain situations reflect that sort of light since many other birds have the same properties  Nor does Belon seem to rest his opinion on better foundation when he attempts to discover Turkies in the writings of the ancients Columella had said in his treatise  De re rustica Africana est meleagridi similis nisi quod rutilam galeam et cristam capite gerit quae utraque in meleagrida sunt coerulea  Lib viii    The African hen is like the meleagris only its tuft and comb are red but in the other both are coerulean  Belon takes this  African hen  for the pintado and the meleagris for the Turkey but it is evident from the passage itself that Columella speaks here only of two varieties of the same species since the two birds mentioned are perfectly alike except in colour which is liable to vary in the same species especially in that of the pintado of which in the males the membranous appendices that hang on both sides of the cheeks are of a blue colour while in the female the same parts are red Besides is it likely that Columella wishing to distinguish two species so remote from each other as the pintado and the Turkey  would be contented in selecting a slight difference of colour instead of marking obvious and striking characters  But if the attempts of Belon to bestow on Turkies from the authority of Columella an African origin are without foundation his success is not greater when he seeks from the following passage of Ptolemy to give them an Asiatic origin  Trigliphon Regia where the common cocks are said to be bearded  This Trigliphon is situated indeed beyond the Ganges but there is no reason to believe that these bearded cocks are Turkies for The very existence of these cocks is uncertain resting merely on hearsay This description cannot refer to Turkies since as I have before observed the word  beard  applied to a bird can mean only a tuft of feathers or hairs placed under the bill not the lock of stiff hair which the Turkies have on the under part of the neck Ptolemy was an astronomer and geographer and not a naturalist and it is evident that he wished to render his charts more interesting by introducing and not always with judgment accounts of the peculiarities of each country In the very same page he speaks of three islands of satyrs whose inhabitants had tails and he tells us that the Manioles are ten islands situated nearly in the same climate where loadstone abounds so much that iron cannot be employed in the construction of ships  because of the danger of their being attracted and held by the magnetic force But these human tails though asserted by several travellers and by the Jesuit missionaries according to Gemelli Careri are at least very doubtful and the mountains of loadstone or rather their effects on the iron of vessels are no less so so that little confidence can be put in facts mingled with such uncertain relations Lastly Ptolemy in the place above quoted speaks expressly of ordinary cocks which cannot be confounded with Turkeycocks neither in their external form their plumage their cry their natural habits the colour of their eggs nor the time of incubation c It is true that Scaliger while he admits that the meleagris of Athenaeus or rather of Clytus who is quoted by Athenaeus was an Aetolian bird that loved wet situations which was averse to hatching and whose flesh had a marshy taste none of which characters belong to the Turkey which is not an inhabitant of Aetolia which avoids watery spots which has the greatest affection to its young and whose flesh has a delicate flavour yet still maintains that the meleagris is the Turkey But the anatomists of the Academy of Sciences who were at first of the same opinion have after examining the subject with more attention ascertained and proved that the pintado was the real  meleagris  of the ancients In short we  must consider it as an established point that Athenaeus or Clytus Aelian Columella and Ptolemy have no more spoken of Turkies than Aristotle or Pliny and that these birds were totally unknown to the ancients  Nor can we find the least mention of the Turkey in any modern work written prior to the discovery of America A popular tradition refers the period of its first introduction into France to the sixteenth century in the reign of Francis I for this was the time when Admiral Chabot lived The authors of the British Zoology state it as a wellknown fact that they were introduced into England in the time of Henry VIII the contemporary of Francis I which agrees exactly with our opinion For America having been discovered by Christopher Columbus towards the end of the fifteenth century and these sovereigns having ascended the throne about the beginning of the sixteenth century it is natural to suppose that the Turkies brought from the New World would under their reigns be regarded as novelties in France and England This is confirmed too by the express testimony of J Sperling who wrote before he affirms that they had been introduced from the New Indies into Europe more than a century prior to his time  Zoologia Physica p    Every thing therefore concurs to prove that the Turkies are natives of America As they are  heavy birds and cannot rise on the wing or swim it would be impossible for them to cross the ocean which separates the two continents They are in the same situation with the quadrupeds which without the assistance of man would not have been dispersed through the Old and New Worlds This reflection gives additional weight to the testimony of travellers who assure us that they have never seen Wild Turkies either in Africa or Asia and that none are found there but such as are domestic and brought from other parts  The Honourable Daines Barrington has published an Essay in which he attempts to prove that the Turkey was known before the discovery of America He examines the Comte de Buffon's arguments and endeavours to invalidate or refute them but his objections are entirely inconclusive If the Turkey had been introduced into Spain by Columbus it would have been called says Mr Barrington  the Mexican bird  and not  pago  or  pavo  Cardinal Perron who died in relates that the Indian Cocks had prodigiously multiplied and were driven like flocks of sheep from Languedoc into Spain therefore says Mr B the Turkey must have been introduced first into France These conjectures are so vague as to merit no particular discussion and when Mr B asserts that Sperling means one hundred and one years by the expression  Ante centum  quod excurrit  annos  he seems not to have attended to grammar That phrase is classical and means indefinitely some time more than a century nor will the word  excurrit  admit of any other interpretation  Mr Barrington proceeds  The Spanish term is not  pavon de las Indias  as M Buffon states but simply  pavo  and formerly  pago  If moreover the name were  pavon de las Indias  it would not signify the West Indies as in all the European languages the addition of  Western  is necessary  But this assertion is too hasty did not the King of Spain after the discovery of America assume the title of  Indiae Rex  and not  Indiae Occidentalis  or  Indiarum  I must add that the opinion of the Comte de Buffon concerning the native climate of the Turkey is admitted by the ingenious and respectable naturalist Mr Pennant who has adduced several new arguments in support of it Linnaeus Gmelin and Latham entertain the same idea    This determination of the natal region of the Turkey leads to the decision of another question which at first sight seems to have no connection with it J Sperling affirms in his  Zoologica Physica  p that the Turkey is a monster he means an hybrid produced by the union of the two species that of the peacock and of the ordinary cock but as it is ascertained that the Turkey is of American extraction it could not be bred by the intercourse of two Asiatic species and what completely decides the point is that no Wild Turkies are found through the whole extent of Asia though they abound in the forests of America But it will be said what means the term  gallopavus  which has so long been applied to the Turkey Nothing is simpler the Turkey was a foreign bird which had no name in any of the European languages and as it bore several striking resemblances to the common cock and the peacock a compound word was formed expressive of these analogies Sperling and others would have us believe that it is really the crossbreed of these two species yet the intermixture  consists entirely in the namesSo dangerous it is to bestow upon animals compounded epithets which are always ambiguous  Edwards mentions another hybrid produced between the Turkey and the pheasant  Gleanings  The individual which he describes was shot in the woods near Hanford in Dorsetshire where it was seen in the month of October with two or three other birds of the same kind It was of a middlesize between the pheasant and the Turkey its wings extending thirtytwo inches a small tuft of pretty long black feathers rose on the base of the upper mandible the head was not bare like that of the Turkey but covered with little short feathers the eyes were surrounded with a circle of red skin but not so broad as in the pheasant It is not said whether this bird could spread the large feathers of the tail into the wheelshape it only appears from the figure that it carried the tail in the same way as the Turkey generally does It must also be observed that this tail is composed of sixteen quills as in the grous while that of the Turkey and of the pheasant consists of eighteen also each feather on the body shot double from the same root the one branch stiff and broad the other small and covered with down a character which belongs  neither to the pheasant nor the Turkey If this bird was really a hybrid it ought to have had like other hybrids st The characters common to the two primitive species dly The qualities intermediate between the extremes a circumstance that in this case does not take place since this individual had a character not to be found in either the double feathers and wanted others that occur in both the eighteen quills of the tail Indeed if it be insisted that it was hybridous we should more reasonably infer that it was produced by the union of the Turkey with the grous which as I have remarked has no more than sixteen feathers in the tail but has the double feathers  The Wild Turkies differ not from the domestic sort except that they are much larger and blacker they have the same dispositions the same natural habits and the same stupidity They perch in the woods on the dry branches and when one falls by a shot the rest are not intimidated by the report but all continue secure in the same position According to Fernandes their flesh though pleasant to eat is harder and not so delicate as that of the Tame Turkies but they are twice as large The Mexican name of the male is  hucxolotl  and that of the female  cihuatotolin  Albin tells us that many English gentlemen amuse themselves in breeding Wild Turkies and that these birds thrive very well in small woods parks or other inclosures  The Crested Turkey is only a variety of the common kind similar to what occurs among the ordinary cocks It is sometimes black sometimes white That described by Albin was of the usual size its feet fleshcoloured the upper part of the body deep brown the breast belly thighs and tail white and also the feathers that form the tuft In other respects it resembled exactly the ordinary kind it had the spongy and glandulous flesh which covers the head and arch of the neck and the lock of hard hair rising apparently from the breast and the short spurs on each foot it also bore the same singular antipathy to scarlet c  Specific character of the Turkey  Meleagris Gallopavo  The caruncle of the head is extended to the forehead and the throat the breast of the male is bearded  The Wild Turkies are of a dingy uniform colour and seldom weigh more than thirty pounds They are now very rare in the old settlements of North America yet some occur in Virginia within miles of the coast Beyond the ridge of Apalachian mountains they are frequent and flocks of several hundreds are seen near the Mississippi and Ohio They roost in the great swamps but spend the whole day among the dry woods searching for red acorns and various sorts of berries They grow very fat in the spring When surprised they run with prodigious speed but if hotly pursued they take wing and perch on the summit of the next tall tree The Indians make fans of the Turkies tails and also weave the inner webs of their feathers with hemp or the rind of the mulberrytree into an elegant sort of clothing  The GUINEA PINTADO  In Greek and Latin  Meleagris  in modern Italian  Gallina di Numidia  in German  Perlhuhn  or  Pearlhen  In Congo it has the name  Quetelé    La Peintade  Buff  Numida Meleagris  Linn Gmel c  Gallus Gallina Guineensis  Ray and Will  The Guinea Hen  Ray  WE must not like Ray confound this with the Pintado mentioned by Dampier which is a seabird equal to the duck in size having very long wings and skimming along the surface of the water these characters are all widely different from those of the real Pintado which is a landbird with short wings and whose flight is laborious and slow  It was known and accurately described by the ancients Aristotle mentions it only once in his History of Animals he calls it  Meleagris  and says that its eggs are marked with small spots  Lib vi    Varro takes notice of it by the name of African Hen and he tells us that it was a large bird  N  o  THE GUINEA PINTADO  with variegated plumage and a round back that was very uncommon at Rome  Grandes variae gibberae quas Meleagrides appellant Graeci  Lib iii    Pliny gives the same account and seems merely to copy Varro unless we ascribe the sameness of their descriptions to the identity of the object  Africae Gallinarum genus gibberum variis sparsum plumis  Lib x  He repeats also what Aristotle had said with regard to their eggs  Lib x  and he adds that the Pintado of Numidia was most esteemed  Lib x  quam plerique Numidicam dicunt  and hence he bestows the name of Numidian Hen on the whole species  Columella admitted two sorts which were perfectly alike except that the one had blue barbils and the other red This difference seemed so important to the ancients that they formed two species denoted by distinct names They called the one which had red barbils  Meleagris  the other which had blue barbils the  African Hen  Africana Gallina est Meleagridi similis nisi quod rutilam paleam cristam capite gerit quae utraque sunt in Meleagrida caerulea  COLUMELLA  de Re Rusticâ  lib xiii  not adverting that the former is the female and the latter the male of the same identical species as the academicians have found  Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire Naturelle des Animaux dressé par M Perrault  Deuxieme Partie  p    However it appears that the Pintado which was anciently reared with so much care at Rome was afterwards entirely lost in Europe We can discover no trace of it in the writings of the middle ages and we find it only begun to be spoken of after the Europeans had visited the western coasts of Africa in their voyages to India by the Cape of Good Hope  As Guinea is a country from which merchants have imported many articles formerly unknown to the French so its hens would also have remained unknown had they not been brought over sea But they are now so frequently kept by the great lords in our provinces as to be reckoned common  BELON  But not only have they diffused these birds through Europe but transported them into America and the Pintados have suffered various alterations in their external qualities from the influence of different climates Nor must we be surprised that the moderns both the naturalists and travellers have multiplied the divisions of the breeds still more than the ancients  Frisch distinguishes like Columella the Pintado with red barbils from that with blue barbils but he states several other differences According to him the latter which is found only in Italy is unpalatable food small fond of wet places and careless about its young the two last features also mark the  Meleagris  mentioned by Clytus of Miletus  They delight  says he  in marshes and discover little attachment  to their progeny which the priests are obliged to watch over with care    but  he subjoins  their size is equal to that of a hen of the finest breed  See  Athenaeus lib xiv    It appears too from Pliny that this naturalist considered the Meleagris as an aquatic bird  Mnesias calls a place in Africa Sicyone and a river Crathis which rises out of a lake where the birds termed  Meleagrides Penelopae  haunt  Lib xxxvii  That with red barbils is on the contrary according to Frisch larger than a pheasant prefers a dry situation and is assiduous in its attention to its young c  Dampier informs us that in the island of May one of the Cape de Verd islands there are Pintados of which the flesh is of an uncommon whiteness and others of which it is black but that in all of them it is tender and delicate Father Labat gives the same account This difference if the fact be true would appear to be the more considerable as it cannot be imputed to the change of climate since the Pintados on this island which is near the African shore may be considered as in their native residence at least unless we assert that the same causes which tinge with black the skin and  periosteum  of most of the birds in the islands of St Jago darken also the flesh of the Pintados in the neighbouring island of May  Father Charlevoix pretends that there is at St Domingo a species smaller than the ordinary sort  History of the Spanish island of St Domingo  But these are probably the chesnut Pintados bred from such as were introduced by the Castilians soon after the conquest of the island These having become wild and as it were naturalized in the country have experienced the baneful influence of that climate which as I have elsewhere shewn has a tendency to enfeeble to contract and to degrade the animal tribes It is worth observing that this breed originally from Guinea and transported to America where it had once been reduced to the domestic state but suffered to grow wild could not afterwards be reclaimed to its former condition and that the planters in St Domingo have been obliged to import tame ones from Africa to propagate in their farmyards  Lettres Edifiantes xx  Is it from living in a more desert and wilder country inhabited by savages that the chesnut Pintados have become savage themselves or is it because they have been frighted away by European hunters especially the French who according to Father Margat the Jesuit have destroyed vast numbers of them  Ibidem    Marcgrave saw some with crests that came from Sierra Leona and which had about their  neck a kind of membranous collar of a bluish cinereous colour  The head was covered with a roundish crest much divided and consisting of elegant black feathers  Hist Naturalis Brasiliensis  and this is one of those varieties which I call primitive and which deserve the more attention as they are anterior to every change of climate  The Jesuit Margat who admits no special difference between the African Hen and the Meleagris of the ancients says that they have two kinds in regard to colour at St Domingo in some black and white spots are disposed in the form of rhomboids in others the plumage is of a deeper ashgrey He adds that they all have white below the belly and on the underside and at the tips of the wings  Lastly Brisson considers the whiteness of the plumage of the breast observed on the Pintados at Jamaica as constituting a distinct variety and he characterises it by this epithet  pectore albo  which as we have just seen belongs as much to the Pintados of St Domingo as to those of Jamaica  But besides the differences which have been regarded by naturalists as a sufficient foundation for admitting several races of Pintados I can perceive many others in comparing the descriptions and figures published by different authors which shew little permanency either in the  internal mould of the bird or in the impression of the exterior form but on the contrary a great disposition to be affected by foreign influences  In the Pintado of Frisch and some others  The cock and hen  says Belon  have the same marbling on the feathers and whiteness about the eyes and redness below  At the sides of the head white  MARCGRAVE    The head is clothed  says the Jesuit Margat  by a spongy rough wrinkled skin whose colour is whitish blue  the casque and the feet are whitish the forehead the circle of the eyes the sides of the head and neck in its upper part are white spotted with ashgrey That of Frisch has besides under the throat a red spot in the shape of a crescent and lower down a very broad black collar the silky filaments on the  occiput  few and not a single white quill in the wings which form so many diversities in which the Pintados of these authors differ from ours  In Marcgrave's specimen the bill was yellow in that of Brisson it was red at the base horncoloured near the tip The academicians found on some a small tuft at the origin of the beak consisting of twelve or fifteen stiff threads about four inches long which did not occur in those of Sierra Leona mentioned above  Dr Caius says that in the female the head is entirely black and that this is the only distinction between it and the male  Apud Gesnerum    Aldrovandus asserts on the contrary that the head of the female has the same colours with that of the male but that its casque is less elevated and more obtuse  Roberts affirms that it has not the casque at all  Voyage to the Cape de Verd islands    Dampier and Labat maintain that they never saw those red barbils and caruncles which border the nostrils in the male  New Voyage  It is probable that the short and very bright red crest mentioned by Father Charlevoix is nothing but these caruncles    Barrere tells us that these parts are of a paler colour than in the male and that the silky hairs of the  occiput  are thinner such apparently as represented in Frisch's figure  Lastly the academicians found in some individuals these filaments on the  occiput  rising an inch so that they formed a kind of tuft behind the head  It would be difficult from all these varieties to select those that are so deeply and so permanently stamped as to constitute distinct races and as we cannot doubt but that they are very recent it will perhaps be safest to regard them as the effects produced by domestication change of climate nature of the food c and without introducing them into the description to mark the limits of the variations to which certain qualities of the Pintado are subject and to  endeavour as much as possible to ascend to those causes of which the continued operation has at last imprinted constant characters and formed distinct species  In one circumstance the Pintado bears a striking resemblance to the turkey viz it has no feathers on the head nor on the arch of the neck This has induced several ornithologists as Belon Gesner Aldrovandus and Klein to take the turkey for the Meleagris of the ancients But not to mention the numberless points of difference between these two species  The Meleagris was according to the ancients as large as a good hen and it had a fleshy tubercle on the head its plumage was marked with white spots like lentils but larger there were two barbils attached to the upper mandible the tail was pendulous the back round there were membranes between the toes and no spurs at the feet it delighted in marshes had no tenderness for its young These characters are entirely different from those of the turkey which on the other hand has many properties not to be found in the description of the Meleagris particularly the bunch of hairs that hangs under the neck and his manner of displaying his tail and of pacing around his female  we need only refer to the proofs by which it was decided that the turkey was peculiar to America and could never migrate into the ancient continent  Brisson seems also to have mistaken when from a quotation of Kolben  A bird which belongs properly to the Cape  says this traveller  is the  Knorhahn  or  Coqknor  It is the centinel of the other birds it informs them when it sees a man approach by a scream resembling the sound of the word  crac  and which it repeats very loud It is as large as a common hen its bill is short and black like the feathers on its crown the plumage of the wings and body is mixed with red white and cinereous the legs are yellow and the wings small It frequents solitary places and builds its nest in the bushes it lays two eggs its flesh is not much esteemed though it is very good  he inserted  Knorhaan  in the list of the names of the Pintado I agree with Brisson that the figure given by this traveller is only copied from that of the African Hen of Marcgrave he must also allow that it would be hard to admit a bird peculiar to the Cape of Good Hope to be the Pintado which is spread through the whole of Africa and less common at that promontory than in other parts of the country still more difficult will it be to reconcile the short black bill the crown of feathers the red which is intermixed with the colours of the wings and of the body and the quality which Kolben ascribes to his  Knorhaan  that it lays only two eggs  The plumage of the Pintado though not decorated with rich and dazzling colours is remarkably beautiful It is of a bluishgrey ground sprinkled with considerable regularity with white roundish speckles resembling pearls Hence some of the moderns have bestowed on this bird the name of  Pearled Hen  Frisch  and the ancients applied the epithets  varia  and  guttata  Martial's Epigrams  Such at least was the plumage in its native climate but since it has been carried into other  countries it has assumed more of the white Thus the Pintados at Jamaica and St Domingo are white on the breast and Edwards mentions some entirely white  Gleanings  Part Third  The whiteness of the breast therefore which Brisson considers as the character of a variety is only an alteration begun in the natural colour or rather it is the shade between that colour and complete whiteness  The feathers on the middle part of the neck are very short near its arch where they are entirely wanting From that part they gradually lengthen unto the breast and there they are three inches long  Memoires pour servir l'Histoire des Animaux  Partie  II p    These feathers are of a downy texture from their root to near their middle and this part is covered by the tips of the feathers in the preceding row consisting of stiff webs interwoven with each other  It has short wings and a pendulous tail like that of the partridge which joined to the arrangement of its feathers makes it look as if it were hunchbacked  Genus Gibberum  PLIN but this appearance is false and no vestige remains when the bird is plucked  Lettres Edifiantes  Receuil  xx    The size is nearly that of an ordinary hen but the shape is like that of the partridge hence  it has been called the Newfoundland Partridge  Belon  But it is of a taller form and its neck longer and more slender near the arch  The barbils which rise from the upper mandible have no invariable form being oval in some and square or triangular in others they are red in the female and bluish in the male and according to the academicians and Brisson it is this circumstance alone which distinguishes the two sexes But other authors as we have already seen have assigned different marks drawn from the colours of the plumage  Caius  apud Gesnerum  of the barbils  Columella Frisch Dampier c  the callous tubercle on the head  Aldrovandus Roberts Barrere Dalechamp c  the caruncles of the nostrils  Barrere Labat Dampier c  the size of the body  Frisch  the silky threads of the  occiput  c  Frisch Barrere c  whether these differences really result from the sex or by a logical error which is but too common the accidental properties of the individual have been regarded as sexual  Behind the barbils we perceive on the sides of the head the very small orifice of the ears which in most birds is concealed by feathers but in this is exposed But what is peculiar to the Pintado is a callous bump or a kind of casque which rises on its head and which Belon improperly compares to the tubercle or  rather to the horn of the  giraffe  It was on account of this tubercle that Linnaeus termed the Pintado in the sixth edition  Hen with a  HORNY  top  and in his tenth edition  Pheasant with a  CALLOUS  top  It resembles in shape the reverse of the ducal cap of the Doge of Venice or this cap placed with its back towards the front Its colour varies in different subjects from white to reddish passing through the intermediate shades of yellow and brown  It is whitish in Frisch waxcoloured according to Belon brown according to Marcgrave tawny brown according to Perrault and reddish in the  Planches Enluminées  Its interior surface is like that of hard callous flesh and it is covered with a dry wrinkled skin which extends over the  occiput  and on the sides of the head but is furrowed where the eyes are placed Those naturalists who deal in final causes have asserted that this is a real helmet bestowed on the Pintados as a defensive armour to protect them against the attacks which they make on each other because they are quarrelsome birds and have a strong bill and a delicate skull  The eyes are large and covered the upper eyelid has long black hairs bent upwards and the crystalline lens is more convex at the anterior than at the posterior surface  Perrault affirms that the bill is like that of the common hen the Jefuit Margat makes it thrice as large very hard and pointed the claws are also sharper according to Labat But  all agree both ancients and moderns in saying that the feet have no spurs  There is a remarkable difference which occurs between the ordinary hen and the Pintado that the intestines of the latter are much shorter in proportion not exceeding three feet according to the academicians exclusive of the  caeca  which are each six inches and widen as they extend from their origin and receive like the other intestines vessels from the mesentery The largest of all is the  duodenum  which is eight lines in diameter The gizzard is like that of the common hen and also contains numbers of small pebbles and sometimes even nothing else probably when the animal dying of a languishing distemper has passed the close of its life without eating at all  The inner membrane of the gizzard is full of wrinkles it adheres loosely to the nervous coat and is of a substance analogous to horn  The craw when inflated is about the size of a tennis ball the duct which joins it to the gizzard is of a harder and whiter substance than what precedes the craw and does not present near so many distinct vessels  The  aesophagus  descends along the neck to the right of the  tracheaarteria  because no doubt the neck which as I have already said is very long bending oftener forwards than sidewise the  aesophagus  pressed by the  tracheaarteria  whose rings are entirely osseous has  here as in most of the birds been pushed to that side where there is least resistance  These birds are subject to schirrous concretions in the liver and even in the kidney Some have been found without any gallbladder but in this case the hepatic branch was very thick Others have occurred with only one testicle in general it seems that the internal parts are no less liable to changes than the exterior and superficial parts  The heart is more pointed than common in birds  Memoires pour servir a l'Hist Nat des Animaux  the lungs are of the ordinary shape It has however been observed in some subjects that on blowing into the  tracheaarteria  to inflate the lungs and aircells the  pericardium  which appeared more than ordinarily flaccid swelled with the lungs  Histoire de l'Academie des Sciences tome i p    I shall add another anatomical remark which has perhaps some connection with the habit of crying and the clamorous notes of the Pintado it is that the  tracheaarteria  receives in the cavity of the thorax two small muscular chords of an inch long and twothirds of a line broad which are inserted on each side  Memoires pour servir a l'Hist Nat des Animaux    The Pintado is an exceedingly noisy bird and for this reason Brown has termed it  Gallus clamosus  Natural History of Jamaica  Its cry is sharp and by its continuance  becomes so troublesome that though the flesh is very delicate and much superior to that of ordinary poultry most of the American planters have given over breeding it  Lettres Edifiantes  Recueil  xx    The Greeks had a word appropriated to denote the screaming of the Pintado  according to Pollux  Gesner  That word signifies also  to laugh loud  Aelian observes that the Meleagris utters a sound resembling that of its name Dr Caius says that its cry is like that of the partridge though not so loud Belon tells us that it is analogous to the chirping of young chickens lately hatched but at the same time he positively affirms that it is unlike that of ordinary hens I cannot conceive why Aldrovandus and Salerne assert the contrary  The Pintado is a lively restless and turbulent bird that dislikes to remain in the same place and contrives to become master of the poultryyard It can intimidate even the turkies for though much smaller it gains the ascendency over them by the mere dint of petulance  The Pintado  says Father Margat  wheels sometimes round gives twenty strokes with his bill before these heavy birds are roused to defence  The Hens of Numidia seem to have the same mode of fighting which the historian Sallust imputes to the cavalry of that country  Their charge is sudden and irregular  if they meet with resistance they retreat but in an instant they renew the attack  Lettres Edifiantes  Recueil  xx    To this example we might add many others tending to prove the influence of climate on the instincts of the animals as well as on the national genius of the inhabitants The elephant joins to strength and industry a slavish disposition the camel is laborious patient and sober and in those enervating regions even the dog forgets to bite  Aelian relates that in a certain island the Meleagris is respected by the birds of prey  Historia Animalium  lib v  but I presume that in every country of the world these would rather attack other fowls whose bill is not so strong whose head is not protected by a casque and who are not so well acquainted with the art of defence  The Pintado is one of those birds which seek by weltering in the dust to rid themselves of insects They also scrape the ground like common hens and roam in numerous flocks Bodies of two or three hundred together are sometimes seen in the Isle of May and the inhabitants hunt them with a greyhound and without other weapons than sticks  Dampier and Brue  But according to Belon they run very fast keeping their head elevated like the camelopard  They perch at night to sleep and sometimes during the day on the walls of inclosures on hedges and even on the roofs of houses and on trees They are at great pains Belon adds in providing their food and indeed considering the length of their intestines they must consume more than ordinary fowls and be subject to more frequent calls of hunger  De Seve observed in throwing some bread to Pintados that when one of them happened to take a bit larger than it could immediately swallow it hurried away with it out of the reach of the other fowls and hid it in the dunghill or in the earth and sometime afterwards returned and ate it    It appears from the concurrence of the ancients  Pliny  Historia Naturalis  lib xxxvii  and Clitus of Miletus in Athenaeus  and moderns  Gesner Frisch  Lettres Edifiantes  which is also corroborated by the semimembranes which connect the toes that the Pintado is partly an aquatic bird Accordingly those from Guinea which have recovered their liberty in St Domingo and obey the impulse of nature alone prefer the swamps and moist situations  Lettres Edifiantes    I entered  says Adanson  a little thicket near a marsh where flocks of Pintados were gathered    If they be trained when young they soon become tame Brue relates that when he was at the coast of Senegal he received as a present from a princess of that country two Pintados a male and a female both of which were so familiar that they would come to eat on his  plate and that when they were at liberty to fly about the beach they returned regularly to the ship when the dinner or supper bell rung Moore says that they are as wild as the pheasants are in England  Hist Gen des Voyages  tome iii p  but I suspect he never saw pheasants so tame as Brue's Pintados And what proves that the Pintados are not very wild is that they receive the food which is offered them the moment after they are caught  The Pintado lays and hatches nearly like the ordinary hen but its fecundity appears to be not the same in different climates or at least that this is much greater in the domestic condition where food is more abundant than in the savage state which affords but a scanty subsistence I have been informed that it is wild in the Isle of France and there lays ten or twelve eggs on the ground in the woods whereas those that are domestic in St Domingo and seek the hedges and bushes to deposite their eggs lay or provided that one be left constantly in the nest  These eggs are smaller in proportion than those of an ordinary hen and their shell is much harder But there is a remarkable difference between those of the domestic Pintados and those of the wild sort the latter are marked with small round spots like those on their plumage  and this circumstance has not been overlooked by Aristotle but those of the former are at first of a pretty bright red which afterwards fades and at last runs into the faint colour of a dried rose If this fact be true as I have been assured by Fournier who has raised many of these birds we must conclude that the influence of domestication penetrates here so deeply as to change not only the colours of the plumage as we have already seen but even those of the matter which forms the shell of the eggs and as this does not happen in other species there is reason to conclude that the nature of the Pintado is not so fixed and invariable as that of other birds  Is the Pintado watchful or not of its brood This is a problem that has not yet been solved Belon replies without qualification in the affirmative  They are very prolific and careful in rearing their young  History of Birds  Frisch is of the same opinion with regard to his great species which delights in dry situations but affirms that the contrary is true of the small species which prefers marshes But most authors impute to them a degree of indifference for their offspring the Jesuit Margat informs us that at St Domingo they are not suffered to cover their eggs because they discover so little attachment and so often abandon their young  Lettres Edifiantes  The planters give their  eggs to be hatched he says under turkies or common hens  I can find nothing with respect to the time of incubation but if we judge from the size of the bird and from our knowledge of other species to which it is most analogous we may allow three weeks more or less according to the heat of the season or climate and the assiduity of the sitter c  In their first infancy the young Pintados have neither the barbles nor the casque they resemble the red partridges in their plumage and the colour of their feet and bill and it is difficult to distinguish the young males from the old females  I have this fact from Fournier who was mentioned above  for in all these species the maturity of the females corresponds to the infancy of the males  The young Pintados are very tender and being natives of the burning climates of Africa are with difficulty reared in our northern countries According to Father Margat they feed at St Domingo as well as the old ones on millet At the Isle of May they subsist on the grasshoppers and worms which they find themselves by scraping the ground with their nails  Dampier and Labat  and Frisch says that they live on all sorts of grain and insects  The Pintado cock breeds also with the common hen But it is a kind of artificial union  which requires attention to bring about They must be bred together from their infancy and the hybridous intercourse gives birth to a bastard progeny of an imperfect structure and disavowed as it were by nature Their eggs are destitute of the prolific power and the race is extinguished in the death of the individuals  Fournier    The Pintados that are raised in our poultryyards have an excellent flavour in no respect inferior to that of partridges but the wild or chesnut sort of St Domingo have the most exquisite relish and exceed the delicacy of the pheasant The eggs of the Pintado too are a very agreeable food  We have seen that the Pintado is of African origin and hence all the names that have been bestowed on it hen of Africa of Numidia the foreign hen that of Barbary of Tunis of Mauritania of Lybia of Guinea of Egypt of Pharaoh and even of Jerusalem Some Mahometans called them Jerusalem hens and sold them to the Christians for whatever price they chose to demand  Longolius  apud Gesnerum  but these perceiving the fraud retaliated on the good Musulmen by offering them under the name of Mecca hens  They are found in the isles of France and Bourbon  Aublet  where they have been introduced  at a late period but have

Syria breeds Pintados  DIODORUS SICULUS  we are not informed whether they occur in the island of Madeira or in the Canaries Gentil tells us that he saw Pintado hens at Java  Voyage round the World  but it is uncertain if they were tame or wild I should rather suppose that they were domestic and carried from Africa to Asia as they have been transported from Europe to America But as these birds were accustomed to a hot climate they could not support the intense cold that reigns on the frozen shores of the Baltic and Linnaeus never mentions them in his  Fauna Suecica  Klein seems to speak but from the report of  another person and we are informed that at the beginning of the present century they were rare even in England  Edwards's Gleanings    Varro says that in his time the African hens it is thus he names the Pintados were sold for a high price at Rome on account of their scarcity  De Re Rusticâ lib iii  They were much more common in Greece in the age of Pausanias since this author positively asserts that the meleagris with the common goose was what persons who were not in easy circumstances generally presented at an offering in the solemn mysteries of Isis But we must not therefore infer that the Pintados were natives of Greece for according to Athenaeus the Aeolians were the first Greeks who were possessed of these birds Yet I conceive that some trace of a regular migration may be discovered from the battles that were annually fought with these birds in Boeotia on the tomb of Meleager which are mentioned both by the naturalists and mythologists  Pliny lib x  Hence the name of Meleagris  According to the fable the sisters of Meleager having gone distracted through excessive grief at their brother's death were turned into these birds which still bear the tears sprinkled on their plumage  as that of Pintado  Peintade  from  peindre  which in French signifies to paint  has been bestowed  on account of the beautiful distribution of the colours with which their plumage is painted  Specific character of the Pintado  Numidia Meleagris  Has a double caruncle at the chaps no fold at the throat  Mr Pennant makes it appear that the Pintados had been early

make a creeking noise alluding to the whirring cry of the Grous The word  akin to the former seems to have been in use and hence the Latin  Tetrao Auer  in old German signifies  shy  or  wild  and the Grous was therefore termed  Auerhahn  or Wild Hen which was latinized into  Urogallus  In Italian it is called  Gallo Cedrone  or the Cedar Cock In Polish it is named  Gluszec  in Swedish  Kjaeder  and in Norwegian  Lieure  Linn Gmel c c  Urogallus Major  Briss Klein and Gerini  The Capcalze  Sibbald Scot Illust  The Cock of the Wood or Mountain  Ray Will and Alb  IF we were to judge of things by their names only we should take this bird for a wild cock or a pheasant for in many countries particularly in Italy it is called Wild Cock  Albin describes the male and female under the name of the  Black Cock and Hen  of the Muscovy mountains    gallo alpestre    selvatico  i e  Mountain Cock Wood Cock  In other places it is termed the  Noisy Pheasant  and the  Wild Pheasant  But it differs from the pheasant in its tail which is of another shape and only half the length in the number of great feathers that compose it in the extent of its wings compared  with its other dimensions and in the form of its feet which are rough and without spurs c Besides though both these species of birds delight in forests they are seldom found in the same spots the pheasant which shuns cold fixes its residence in the woods that grow in the plains while the Grous prefers the chill exposure of the woods which crown the summits of lofty mountains Hence the names of  Cock of the Mountain  and  Cock of the Wood  Those who with Gesner and some others would consider it as the original cock can indeed found their conjecture on some analogies the general shape of its body the particular configuration of its bill the red projecting skin above the eyes the singular nature of its feathers which are mostly double and rise in pairs from the same root a property which according to Belon is peculiar to the ordinary cock and lastly they have the same common habits one male supplying several females and these not building any nests but sitting on their eggs with much assiduity and showing a strong affection to their young after they are hatched But if we consider that the Grous has no membranes under its bill and no spurs on its feet that its feet are clothed with plumage and its toes are edged with a kind of indenting that there are two quills more in the tail that this tail is not divided into two planes as in the ordinary cock but can be displayed like a fan  as in the turkey that its bulk is quadruple that of the ordinary cock that it is fond of cold countries while the domestic fowls thrive best in temperate climates that no instance was ever adduced of the intermixture of the breeds and that their eggs are of a different colour If to all these we add the proofs already given that the ordinary cock is a native of the genial regions of Asia where travellers have hardly ever seen the Grous we certainly cannot admit that these are the primitive stock and we must impute it to an error occasioned like many others by the deceitful gloss of names  Aristotle merely mentions a bird which he terms  tetrix  and which the Athenians called  ourax    it is a bird he says which does not nestle on trees or on the ground but among low creeping plants    Lib vi  A little afterwards he adds that the  tetrix  does not make any nest but drops its eggs on the ground like all the heavy birds and covers them with stiff herbs This short description manifestly applies to the Grous the female of which constructs no nest but drops her eggs on moss and when obliged to leave them covers them carefully with leaves Besides the Latin word  tetrao  which Pliny employs to signify the Grous has an evident analogy to the Greek  tetrix  not to mention the resemblance which the Athenian  ourax  bears to the compound  term  ourhhahn  bestowed by the Germans a coincidence which cannot with propriety be ascribed to chance  But there is a circumstance which seems to shed some doubts on the identity of these birds Pliny describing his  tetrao  at some length never takes notice of what Aristotle had said of the  tetrix  which it is likely he would have done if he had conceived these to be the same unless the slight mention made by Aristotle had escaped the Roman naturalist  With regard to the great  tetrax  of which Athenaeus speaks  Lib ix  it is certainly not our Grous since it has fleshy barbles like those of the cock rising near the ears and descending below the bill a character quite foreign to the Grous and which applies much better to the Meleagris or Numidian hen which is our Pintado  The little  tetrax  mentioned by the same author is according to him an exceeding small bird and this excludes all comparison with our Wood Grous which is one of the first magnitude  In respect to the  tetrax  of the poet Nemesianus who dwells on its stupidity Gesner considers it as a species of bustard But I discover a discriminating mark of resemblance to the meleagris in the colours of its plumage the  ground is of an ashgray sprinkled with spots in the shape of drops  Fragments of Books on Birdcatching  ascribed by some to the Poet Nemesianus who lived in the third century of the Christian aera  a circumstance which has given the pintado the name of  Gallina Guttata  Et picta perdix Numidicaeque guttatae  And the painted partridge and the speckled Numidian hens  MARTIAL  This is exactly the plumage of the two hens belonging to the Duke of Ferrara of which Gesner says in his account of the Pintado  That they were entirely of a cinereous colour with a whitish cast and with black and round spots    But whatever be the force of these conjectures it appears incontestably proved that the two species of the  tetrao  of Pliny are really those of our Grous the fine shining black of their plumage the flamecolour of their eyebrows their residence in cold mountainous countries  A glossy jet black becomes the  tetraones  and a scarlet on the eyebrowsThey inhabit the Alps and the region of the North    PLINY lib x  The  tetrao  seen by Belon on the lofty mountains of Crete corresponds well to Pliny's description  the delicacy of their flesh these are properties that belong both to the Wood and Black Grous We can even distinguish in Pliny's description the traces of a peculiarity that has been remarked by few moderns  Moriuntur contumaciâ  says this author  spiritu revocato  i e  They die through obstinacy recalling their breath  This refers to a curious observation which Frisch has inserted in his history of this bird That naturalist not being able to find  the tongue in a dead Grous opened the gizzard and discovered that it retreated there with all its ligaments and this must commonly happen since it is the general opinion of sportsmen that the Grous has no tongue The same perhaps might be said of the Black Eagle mentioned by Pliny and the Brazil bird of which Scaliger speaks which was reckoned to have not tongue This opinion might take its rise with credulous travellers or unobservant hunters who never viewed this bird except when expiring or after death and no person inspecting their gizzard  The other species of  tetrao  which Pliny describes at the same place is much larger since it exceeds the bustard and even the vulture which it resembles in plumage and in point of size is inferior to the ostrich alone besides it is so unwieldy a bird that it can be caught by the hand  This is literally true of the Little Grous as we shall find in the following article  Belon asserts that this species of  tetrao  is unknown to the moderns who according to him have never seen any Wood Grous larger or even so large as the bustard and there is room to doubt whether the bird mentioned in this passage of Pliny by the names  Otis  and  Avis tarda  was really our bustard whose flesh has an excellent flavour while the  avis tarda  of Pliny was very unpalatable  But we must not on this account infer with Belon that the great  tetrao  was no other than the  avis tarda  since the Roman naturalist names both the  tetrao  and the  avis tarda  in the same passage and compares them together as birds of different species  After a mature consideration of the subject I should rather conclude That the first  tetrao  of which Pliny speaks is the small species of Grous to which what is here said more directly refers That his great  tetrao  is our Wood Grous which without exaggeration exceeds the bulk of the bustard I myself weighed a large bustard whose extreme length was three feet three inches and the extent of whose wings was six feet and an half and found it twelve pounds but it is well known and we shall afterwards have occasion to take notice of it that some of the Wood Grous weigh more  The Wood Grous has near four feet of alar extent Its weight is generally twelve or fifteen pounds Aldrovandus affirms that he has seen some that were twentythree pounds but these were Bologna pounds which contain each only ten ounces and therefore twentythree are not quite equal to fifteen pounds of sixteen ounces The Black Cock of the Mountains of Muscovy described by Albin and which is really the Wood Grous weighed ten pounds without the feathers or entrails and the  same author informs us that the  lieures  of Norway which is really the same bird is as large as a bustard  This bird scrapes the ground like all the frugivorous tribe Its bill is strong and sharp  I know not what Longolius means when he says that this bird has traces of barbils Is there a kind of large grous which have barbils as there is among the small grous or does he allude to a certain disposition of the feathers representing imperfectly barbils as he has done at the article of the Hazel Grous  the tongue is pointed and lodged in a proportional concavity in the palate The feet are also firm and clothed before with plumage the craw is extremely wide but in other respects both it and the gizzard are constructed as in the domestic cock the coat of the gizzard has a velvet softness where the muscles are attached  The Wood Grous feeds on the leaves or tops of the pine of the juniper of the cedar of the willow of the white poplar of the hazel of the myrtle of the bramble on thistles fircones the leaves and flowers of buckwheat on chichling vetch millfoil dandelion trefoil the vetch and the chokeweed especially when these plants are young and tender When the seed begins to be formed they leave the flowers and only eat the leaves They feed too especially in their first year on blackberries beechmast and ants eggs On the other hand it has been observed that many  plants prove poisonous to this bird among others lovage celandine wallwort lily of the valley wheat nettles c  Journal Economique  Mai    On opening the gizzard of the Wood Grous small pebbles have been found similar to those in common poultry a certain proof that they do not confine themselves to the leaves and flowers which they pluck from the trees but also feed on grains which they seek by scraping the ground When they eat too many juniperberries their flesh which otherwise is excellent contracts an unpleasant taste and according to the remark of Pliny it loses its delicate flavour if kept in cages or coops where it is sometimes fed for curiosity  Lib x    The female differs from the male only in its size and plumage being smaller and not so black besides it excels the male in the beauty and variety of its colours a circumstance which is uncommon in birds and even in other animals From not attending to this fact Gesner has made the female another species of Grous by the name of  grygallus major  formed from the German term  grugelhahn  for the same reason he has made the female of the Black Grous another species which he calls  grygallus minor  Yet he pretends that he did not fix these species till he had carefully examined all the individuals except the  grygallus minor  and was confident that he could  perceive characteristical differences On the other hand Schwenckfeld whose residence was among mountains and who observed the  grygallus  often and carefully assures us that it was the female Grous but it must be admitted that in this species and perhaps in many others the plumage is subject to great diversity arising from the age the sex the climate and other circumstances The one which we have caused to be engraved is somewhat crested Brisson takes no notice of a crest in his description and of the two figures given by Aldrovandus the one is crested the other not Some pretend that the Grous when young has much white in its plumage  When the bird displays its tail the white forms a circle around it  which diminishes as the bird grows old and so regularly as to serve as a mark for distinguishing the age It would even appear that the number of quills in the tail is not constant for Linnaeus makes it eighteen in his  Fauna Suecica  and Brisson only sixteen in his  Ornithology  and what is more extraordinary Schwenckfeld who saw and examined many of these birds asserts that both in the large and in the small species the females have eighteen tailfeathers and the male only twelve It therefore follows that every system which assumes for its specific characters differences so variable as are the colours and even the number of the feathers will be liable to the great inconvenience  of multiplying the species I should rather say nominal species or more properly new terms of oppressing the memory of beginners and of giving them false ideas of things and consequently that such a plan increases the difficulties in the study of nature  It is false what Encelius relates that the male Grous sitting on a tree calls the females to him with loud cries emits  semen  from his bill which they swallow and again discharge and thus become impregnated Nor is it true that the part of the  semen  which is not gathered up by the females forms serpents precious stones and pearls It is mortifying to our pride to see the human mind inflicted with grovelling errors or hurried into such extravagant follies The Grous couple like other birds nor was Encelius unacquainted with the fact but he insists that the embrace is mere dalliance and that the deglutition of the  semen  is essential to propagation  The male Grous begins to be in season about the first of February the fiery appetite is most intense towards the latter end of March and continues till the leaves are expanded During that period of love each cock fixes his residence in a certain quarter out of which he never removes In the morning and evening he is observed walking backwards and forwards on the trunk of a large pine or other tree his tail displayed his wings trailing his neck projecting his head ruffled and assuming all sorts of uncommon  postures with such force is he impelled by the burning desires He has a certain note with which he calls his females who run under the tree where he lodges from which he soon descends to taste the joys of love This singular cry which is very loud and can be heard at a great distance is perhaps the reason of the name which has been applied of  noisy pheasant  It begins with a kind of explosion and expires in a sharp shrill note resembling the sound produced by whetting a seythe This noise vanishes and returns alternately and after being repeated several times in the course of half an hour it ends in explosion like the first  Journal Economique  April      The Wood Grous which at other times is very shy can easily be surprised in the season of love especially when it is occupied with its call it is then stunned with its own noise or if we chuse so intoxicated that it is neither scared by the sight of man nor roused by the report of a fowlingpiece It sees nothing it hears nothing it is dissolved into extacy  It is so overgrown that it may be caught motionless on the ground  PLINY  What that naturalist imputes to its bulk may be referred with greater probability to heat and intoxication of its passion  hence it has been said and even written that the Grous is deaf and blind But almost all animals not excepting man are in similar situations absorbed in delight all feel in a certain degree the raptures  of maddening joys But probably the Wood Grous is more under the dominion of lust for in Germany the term  auerhahn  is bestowed on the lover who neglects every other concern and devotes himself entirely to the object of his passion  Frisch  and even applied to every person who discovers a stupid insensibility to his most important interests  It will be readily conceived that the season when the Grous is wholly occupied by the amorous passions is the proper time for setting gins or for hunting it When I come to treat of the Small Black Grous I shall describe more particularly the precautions observed in this sport I shall here only observe that people are attentive in extirpating the old cocks because these appropriate an extensive tract and suffer no rivals to enter the region of their pleasures and thus many females are deprived of the male influence and produce addle eggs  Some birdcatchers pretend that before the Wood Grous couple they provide a clean even spot  Gesner  That such may occur I have no doubt but I suspect that the Grous show no foresight in choice It is much more natural to suppose that these spots have been the habitual resort of the hen and her young and that after two or three months they become more trodden and flat than the rest of the ground  The least number of eggs which the female Wood Grous commonly lays is five or six the greatest number eight or nine Schwenckfeld asserts that their first hatch is eight and the subsequent ones amount to twelve fifteen or even sixteen  This gradation is conformable to the general observation of Aristotle I suspect only that the number is overrated  These eggs are white spotted with yellow and according to the same author they are larger than those of common hens The female drops them in a dry spot on the moss where it hatches them alone without the assistance of the male  I have somewhere read that the time of incubation is twentyeight days which is probable considering the bulk of the bird  When it is obliged to leave the eggs it carefully strews them with leaves and though it inherits a savage instinct the love of progeny seems to blunt the sense of immediate danger and it continues to sit after we have approached it and can hardly be forced to forsake its eggs  As soon as the young are hatched they run nimbly and even before the shell is completely detached The mother leads them in the most careful and attentive manner she goes with them into the woods where she feeds them with ants eggs blackberries c They continue united through the rest of the year till the return of the season of love inspiring them with new appetites and inclinations disperses the family the males are the widest separated never associating  with their own sex and seldom mixing with the females but to satiate their lust  The Wood Grous delights as we have already observed in lofty mountains But this is the case only in the milder latitudes for in countries that are intensely cold as Hudson's Bay they prefer the plains and sheltered places and in such situations they enjoy in those inclement regions perhaps the same temperature as on the most elevated summits in the genial climes  Hist Gen des Voyages tome xiv  They inhabit the Alps the Pyrenees the mountains of Auvergne of Savoy of Switzerland of Westphalia of Swabia of Muscovy of Scotland those of Greece and Italy those of Norway and even those in northern tracts of the continent of America It is supposed that the breed is extinct in Ireland where however they once resided  British Zoology    It is said that birds of prey are very destructive to them either because they direct their assaults when the Wood Grous is intoxicated with love or growing fond of the superior delicacy of their flesh they select them for their prey  Specific character of the Wood Grous  TetraoUrogallus  Its tail is rounded its axillary feathers white  Mr Pennant whose authority on this subject is unquestionable assures us that this bird is not found in America It is now almost extinct in Scotland being found only in the forests north of Lochness  The BLACK GROUS  Le Petit Tetras  ou  Coq de Bruyere à Queue Fourchue  i e The forkedtail Heathcock

bird for the  tetrax  of the poet Nemesianus This oversight arose undoubtedly from not attending to what Nemesianus himself had mentioned that it was of the bulk of a goose or a crane  Tarpeiae est custos arcis non corpore major  Nec qui te volucres docuit Palamede figuras  some other observers inform us that the Black Grous is scarcely larger than an ordinary cock but only longer shaped and the female according to Ray is smaller than a common hen  Turner speaking of his Moorish hen so called he says not on account of its plumage which  N  o  THE BLACK GROUS  resembles that of the partridge but on account of the colour of the male which is black ascribes to it a red flesh comb with two barbils of the same colour and substance  See Gesner  In this assertion Willughby insists that he was mistaken But it is difficult to conceive that Turner could fall into an error with respect to this bird which inhabits his own country and concerning a character that would be so easily noticed On the other hand admitting what Turner says I should refer his Moorish hen to another species or if we chuse to another sort of the Black Grous analogous to the first in its general structure and habits but distinguished by its undivided tail and its flesh barbils and what confirms me in this opinion is that I find in Gesner a bird by the name of  gallus sylvestris  which has these properties so that we may consider it as an individual of the same species with Turner's Moorish hen especially as in this species the male is called the  black cock  in Scotland whence Gesner received his figure and the female  grey hen  a circumstance which marks distinctly the difference of the plumage of the two sexes in this species of the Grous  The Black Grous weighs three or four pounds It bears a great resemblance to the Wood Grous it has red eyelids rough feet without spurs indented toes white spot on the wing c But it is distinguished by two obvious characters it  is much smaller and its tail is forked the outer feathers being longer the middle ones bent backwards Besides the male of the small species is of a deeper and more distinct black the red glandulous skin above the eyes is broader but subject to some variations in the same individuals at different times as we shall find in the sequel  The female is only two thirds of the size of the male  British Zoology  Its tail is less forked and the colours of its plumage are so different that Gesner was induced to refer it to a distinct species by the name of  grygallus minor  This change in the colours of the plumage does not take place till after a certain age the young males at first resemble their mother and preserve the same appearance till the end of the autumn Towards the close of that season and during the winter the plumage gradually acquires a deeper colour till it becomes a bluishblack which is permanent thenceforth except the slight changes which I shall mention The blue increases somewhat with age At the end of three years and not sooner a white spot appears under the bill When they are very old another spot of a variegated black spreads under the tail where the feathers are all white  Acts of Breslau Nov  Charleton and some others add that the number of white specks on the tail diminishes regularly with the age of the bird so as to serve for a mark to discover it  The naturalists who unanimously reckon twentysix quills in the wing of the Black Grous do not agree so well with respect to the number of quills in the tail Schwenckfeld allows eighteen to the female and only twelve to the male Willoughby Albin and Brisson bestow sixteen on either sex The two males preserved in the Royal Cabinet have each eighteen viz seven large ones on each side and four in the middle much shorter Must we ascribe these differences to a real variation in the number of quillfeathers or are we to impute them to the inaccuracy or inattention of the observersThe wings of the Black Grous are short and hence its flight is laborious nor is it ever seen to rise high or to pursue a distant course  In both sexes the orifice of the ears is wide the toes are connected by a membrane as high as the first articulation and edged with indenting their flesh is white and of easy digestion the tongue soft beset with small points and not parted under the tongue is a glandulous substance in the palate a cavity corresponding exactly to the dimensions of the tongue the craw is very large the intestinal tube fiftyone inches long and the appendices or  caeca  twentyfour these fluted with six  striae  Willughby and Schwenckfeld    The difference between the male and female is not confined to the surface it penetrates even  to the interior organization Dr Waygand observes that the bone of the  sternum  in the males being held to the light appears interwoven with a prodigious number of small ramifications of a red colour which meander in every shape and in all directions and form a curious and singular web but that in the females the same bone has nothing analogous to these ramifications it is besides very small and of a whitish colour  Acts of Breslaw  as quoted above    This bird flies often in flocks and perches on trees much like the pheasant  British Zoology  It casts its feathers in the summer and then conceals itself in luxuriant heath or seeks for lodgment among fens  Acts of Breslaw  It feeds chiefly on the leaves and buds of the birch or on the berries that are the spontaneous production of Alpine tracts Hence the French name  coq de bruyere  or  heathcock  and the German of  birkhan  or  birchhen  It also eats the catkins of the hazel wheat and other grains in autumn it has recourse to the acorns brambleberries alderbuds pinecones bilberries and the berries of the spindle tree in winter it retires to the extensive forests and subsists on juniper berries or searches under the snow for the cranberries  SchwenckfeldRzacynskiWillughby and the  British Zoology  Sometimes it lives two or three months in the rigour of winter without  any food  The author of the British Zoology remarks that the white partridges which winter in the snow have their legs better clothed with feathers than the two species of Grous which find shelter in the thick forests But if the Grous sleep beneath the snow what becomes of this final cause or rather what becomes of all that superficial sort of reasoning when examined by the light of philosophy  for in Norway it is said to pass the inclement season torpid and motionless beneath the snow in the same manner as in the milder climates the bats the dormice the  lerots  the shrewmice and the marmots if the fact be true suffer a temporary suspension of the active powers  This puts me in mind of what is related in the book  De Mirabilibus  ascribed to Aristotle that certain birds in the kingdom of Pontus lay during the winter in such a state of torpor that they might be plucked and even stuck upon the spit without shewing any feeling and were not roused from their lethargy till they began to be roasted If we strip this tale of the marvellous it alludes to the same sort of torpor with that of the Grous and Marmots while the functions of the external senses are suspended for want of heat    These birds are found in the mountainous tracts of the North of England and Scotland in Norway and the boreal provinces of Sweden in the neighbourhood of Cologne in the Swiss Alps in Bugey where according to Hubert they are called  grianots  in Podolia in Lithuania in Samogitia and particularly in Volhinia and in the Ukraine which includes the Palatinates of Kiovia and Breslaw where a Polish noble as Rzacynzski says caught in one day near the village of Kusmince one hundred  and thirty brace in a single drawing of the netWe shall afterwards see the mode of catching them which is practised in Courland These birds can hardly be reconciled to a different climate or to their domestic state almost all those which Marshal Saxe got from Sweden for his  menagerie  at Chambor died of melancholy without leaving posterity  Salerne    The Black Grous comes in season about the time when the willows begin to shoot that is towards the end of the winter the sportsmen readily discover it by the humidity of their excrements  Acts of Breslaw Nov  It is then that the males are observed to assemble by daybreak to the number of a hundred or more in some place which is elevated solitary surrounded with marshes or covered with heath and this is the field of continual contention they fight bitterly with each other till the vanquished are driven to flight The victors then seat themselves on the trunk of a tree or on a rising spot of ground their eyes flashing fire their eyebrows swelled their feathers bristled their tail expanded like a fan beating their wings and frisking with wild desire  Frisch  British Zoology  they invite their females by a call which may be heard at halfamile's distance the natural note which resembles the sound of the German word  frau  Salerne  rises at this time one third and is joined with another singular cry  or kind of noisy rattling of the gizzard  Frisch  The females in the neighbourhood answer to the voice of the males by a cry peculiar to them flock around their mates and in the following days resort to the precise spot According to Dr Waygand each cock has two or three hens to which he is more particularly attached  When the females are impregnated they retire to lay their eggs in copses which are thick and tall They drop them on the ground and like all the large birds are at little pains in constructing a nest They lay six or seven eggs according to some  British Zoology  from twelve to sixteen  Schwenckfeld  and even from twelve to twenty according to others  Acts of Breslaw  these are not so large as those of the domestic hens but are somewhat longer shaped Linnaeus asserts that the female Black Grous loses its delicate flavour in the time of incubation Schwenckfeld seems to insinuate that their season for laying is now deranged since they have been molested by the sportsmen and scared by the reports of the fowlingpiece and to the same causes he ascribes the extinction in Germany of many other beautiful species of birds  As soon as the chickens are twelve or fifteen days old they flap their wings and essay to fly but it is five or six weeks before they are able to rise from the ground and then they perch on the  trees with their mothers This is the time to decoy them with a call  This call is made of a bone of the Goshawk which is filled with wax and proper holes bored in it  BRESLAW's  Acts  to catch them in the net or to shoot them The mother mistaking this call for the chirping of her strayed young runs to the place and invites them by a particular cry which she often repeats like the domestic fowls in the same circumstances she thus collects the whole covey and all become devoted to the mercy of the sportsmen  As they grow bigger their plumage gradually assumes a black cast and then they are not so easily decoyed but when they have attained half their growth the falcon is flown at them and the proper time is about the close of autumn when the trees have shed their leaves In that season the males select some spot whither they repair every morning at sunrise and by a certain cry especially when it is likely to be frost or fine weather they invite all other birds of the same species of every age and of either sex When assembled they fly in flocks to the bushes or if there is no snow on the ground they disperse over the stubble fields where barley oats or other such grain has been reaped Then it is that birds of prey trained on purpose afford excellent sport  Another method of catching this game is practised in Courland Livonia and Lithuania They use a stuffed grous or an artificial bird made of  cloth of the proper colour and stuffed with hay or tow and this is termed in those countries  balvane  They fasten this  balvane  to the end of a stick and place it on some birchtree near the scene of their amours the time for this sport is in the month of April The birds gather round the  balvane  and fight with each other in play at last they engage in earnest and are so much occupied in the violence of their contentions that the sportsman who is concealed near the spot in his hut surprises them and catches them without being obliged to aim a single blow Those caught in this way he tames in the space of five or six days so that they will come to eat out of his hand  In this respect the Little Grous differs widely from the Great Grous which far from submitting to domestication constantly rejects what is offered it to eat  On the following year in the spring they make use of those tame birds instead of  balvanes  to decoy the wild Black Grous which fall upon them and fight with such fury as not to be scared by the report of a fowlingpiece Each morning they repair by daybreak to the common rendezvous and remain there till sunrise when they fly away and disperse through the forests and heaths in search of food About three o'clock in the afternoon they return to the same spot and continue there till late in the evening This is their regular course of life especially in fair weather during the season of love which lasts three or four  weeks but when it is rainy or cold they are rather more retired  The young Black Grous have also their favourite spot of resort where they assemble in flocks of forty or fifty at a time and devote themselves to nearly the same amusements or occupations their voice however is hoarser and broken and they do not leap with equal agility Their meeting lasts only eight days after which they join the old ones  When the season of love is over and consequently their assemblies less regular new stratagems must be employed to decoy them near the hut where is the  balvane  Several sportsmen on horseback enclose a circuit of variable extent having the hut for its centre and cracking their whips they drive the Grous from bush to bush and so gradually contract the bounds and by means of a whistle they inform the person who manages the  balvane  of their approach The Grous when they shift from one bush to another distinguish accurately those branches which are able to support them not even excepting the vertical shoots which bend with their weight into an horizontal situation after alighting they listen attentively stretching out their neck to learn if they are in a place of safety and as soon as they have allayed their fears they begin to pluck the tender buds The dexterous sportsman then seizes the opportunity of placing his  balvane  on the neighbouring twigs and  fixing a cord he pulls it from time to time so as to imitate the waving motions of the Grous sitting on a flexible branch Experience also instructs him to turn the head of the  balvanes  against the wind when it blows violently but in still weather he finds it best to place them opposite to each other If the Grous are driven straight towards his hut he can discover by an easy observation whether they will perch within his reach If their flight is irregular if they sometimes approach and sometimes retire flapping their wings he concludes that perhaps the whole flock or at least part of them will alight near him On the other hand if they spring not far from his hut and shoot in a rapid steady course he is certain that they will push on to a distance When the Grous settle near the hut the fowler is informed at least thrice by their repeated cries he is then cautious not to fire upon them too suddenly he remains still in his hut and without making the least noise allowing the birds time to examine their situation and to quiet their apprehensions When they are settled and begin to feed he takes his aim steadily and fires But however numerous the flock be though it even amount to fifty or a hundred he can hardly expect to kill more than one or two at each shot for these birds do not group together but commonly perch on a separate tree and hence straggling bushes are better for the sport than a thick forest However when there is no snow  lying on the ground this amusement is sometimes taken in open stubble fields the crops of oats barley buckwheat being led the hut is covered with straw there the sport is tolerably successful except in severe weather when these birds are dispersed and concealed But the first fine day that succeeds makes them more easily caught and a shooter who has taken his station properly can without any assistance of horsemen and with birdcalls alone entice them to his hut with ease  It is asserted that when these birds fly in flocks they are led by an old cock who conducts them like an experienced chief and teaches them to shun the decoys of the sportsmen so that in this case it is exceedingly difficult to drive them to the  balvane  and all that can be then expected is to intercept a few of the stragglers  The proper time for the sport is from sunrise to ten o'clock in the forenoon and from one o'clock in the afternoon to four But in autumn when the air is still and close it may be continued without interruption through the whole day for the Grous then seldom shift their place And in this way they may be chased from tree to tree till near the winter solstice about that time they grow more wild shy and cunning they even change their accustomed haunt unless they are confined by the rigours of the season  It is said to be a sign of fair weather when the Grous sit on the tops of the trees and upon the young shoots but if they descend to the lower branches and squat it forebodes an approaching storm I should not take notice of these remarks of the sportsmen if they did not correspond with the instincts of these birds which from what we have already seen must be very susceptible of the impressions made by the varying state of the atmosphere and whose sensibility in this respect may be supposed so great consistently with probability as to be affected by the change which decides the nature of the following day  When the weather is excessively rainy they retire for shelter into the closest and most bushy forests and as they are tardy and laborious in their flight they can sometimes be hunted down with dogs which exhaust them and catch them by speed of foot  Breslaw's Acts for  This unwieldiness has been remarked by Pliny and was meant to apply both perhaps to the Great and the Small Grous    In other countries the Black Grous is according to Aldrovandus caught with a noose a net is also used as has been already observed but it would be curious to know the shape dimensions and construction of the one with which the Polish nobleman of whom Rzaczynski speaks caught two hundred and sixty at one time  Specific character of the Black Grous  TetraoTetrix  Its Stail is forked its second wingquills white near the base  Its egg is yellowish spotted with dark red In Lapland the Black Grous is taken in snares but formerly it was shot with arrows The people of Siberia have a singular method for catching these birds during the winter They lay a number of poles horizontally on forked sticks in the open birch forests and set small bundles of corn on them At a short distance they plant tall baskets shaped like an invented cone and place in the mouth of these a little wheel that turns freely on its axis The Black Grous are attracted by the corn alight on the poles and after a hasty repast fly to the baskets perch upon the rim of the wheel which giving way precipitates them into the trap  BROADTAILED BLACK GROUS  Le Petit Tetras a Qucue pleine  Buff  I HAVE in the preceding article stated the reasons which have induced me to refer this bird to a distinct family Gesner speaks of it by the name of  Woodcock    gallus sylvestris  as a bird having red barbils and a broad undivided tail He adds that the male is called  Woodcock  in Scotland and the female  Greyhen  It is true indeed that this author conceiving that the two sexes cannot differ much in the colour of their plumage translates Greyhen by  gallina fusca  or  Duskyhen  in order to bring them to a nearer conformity and resting on this erroneous version he concludes that this species is quite distinct from the Moorish hen of Turner because he imagines this bird is too widely removed by the colour of its plumage from the male to belong to the same family But the fact is that the male is almost always entirely black and the female is nearly the same colour with the gray partridge and this circumstance completely decides its identity with the Black Cock of Scotland for even Gesner admits that in other respects they are perfectly alike The only difference that I can perceive is that  the Scotch Black Cock has small red spots under the breast the wings and the thighs but we have seen in the preceding article that the young males which in the end become black are at first of the colour of the mother and perhaps the small red spots mentioned by Gesner are only the traces of their infant plumage before they have acquired the deep jet  I see no reason why Brisson should confound this tribe or variety as he calls it with the  tetrao  dotted with white of Linnaeus  Fauna Suecica  No  since one of the characters of this bird which is termed by the Swedes  racklehane  is its having a forkedtail Besides Linnaeus gives it no barbils which according to the figure and description of Gesner belong to the other birds  Nor can I see why Brisson though he classes these two tribes together makes only one variety of the forkedtail Black Grous since besides the differences that have been just noticed Linnaeus expressly mentions that his Grous sprinkled with white is more shy and wild and has a quite different cry which implies I should imagine characters deeply impressed and more permanent than what constitute a mere variety  It would appear therefore more consistent to distinguish these into two species of Black Grous the one including the Scotch Black Cock and Turner's Moorish Hen and the other characterized by the small white spots under the breast and  its different cry would comprehend the Swedish  racklehane  Thus we might reckon four species of the genus of Grous The Wood Grous The Forkedtail Black Grous The  Racklan  or  Racklehane  of Sweden described by Linnaeus The Moorish Hen of Turner or the Black Cock of Scotland with flesh barbils on both sides of the bill and with an uniform tailThese four species are all natives of the northern climates and reside either in forests of pine or of birch The third only or the Swedish  racklehane  is the only one that might be considered as a variety of the Black Grous if Linnaeus had not ascertained its having a different note  The BLACK GROUS WITH VARIABLE PLUMAGE  Le Petit Tetras à Plumage variable  Buff  THE Wood Grous are common in Lapland especially when the scarcity of provisions or the excessive multiplication of their numbers compels them to leave the forests of Sweden and Scandinavia and advance into the polar tracts  Klein  Yet they have never been found white in those frozen regions the colour of their plumage seems to be fixed and permanent and to resist the operation of cold The same may be said of the Little or Black Grous which are frequent in Courland and the north of Poland but Dr Weigandt the Jesuit Rzaczynski and Klein affirm that there is in Courland another kind of the same termed  White Grous  which however become white only in winter and by the return of summer acquire a reddishbrown colour according to Dr Weigandt but a bluishgrey according to Rzaczynski These variations take place generally in both sexes so that at all times the individuals have precisely  the same colours They do not perch on trees like the other Grous but delight in thick brushwood and heath and generally select each year a certain spot to which they commonly resort when dispersed by sportsmen by birds of prey or by the violence of a storm If we hunt them we ought when they are first sprung to observe carefully their place of shelter since this will certainly be their rendezvous throughout the year and it will be more difficult to spring them a second time for they will rather squat on the ground and endeavour to conceal themselves in which case it will be easy to shoot them  It appears therefore that they differ from the Black Grous not only by their colour and by the uniformity which obtains between the male and female but in their habits since they never perch They are also distinguished from the ptarmigans because they inhabit not the lofty mountains but reside in the woods and among the heaths nor are their legs clothed to the toes with feathers I must indeed confess that I would rather have ranked it with the Red Grous did I not submit to the opinion of these three intelligent writers who speak of a bird that is a native of their own country  The HAZEL GROUS  La Gelinotte  Buff  TetraoBonasia  Linn Gmel c  Gallina Corylorum  In German  Haselhuhn  in Swedish  Harpen  in Polish  Jarzabek  Ray Will and Klein  WHAT Varro has said concerning the Rustic or Wild Hen applies so accurately to the Hazel Grous that Belon does not hesitate to conclude that they were the same It was according to Varro a bird uncommonly rare at Rome and so difficult to tame that it could only be raised in cages and seldom or never laid eggs in this state of captivity Belon and Schwenckfeld say the same of the Hazel Grous the former conveys in a few words a precise notion of the bird more distinct than could be given by a long description  Suppose  says he  that you saw a partridge bred by the crossing of the red with the grey and having a few pheasants feathers and you will have an idea of the Hazel Grous  The male is distinguished from the female by a very remarkable black spot under its throat and by its orbits which are of a much deeper red Their size is that of the  bartavelle  the  N  o  THE SPOTTED GROUS  extent of their wings is only twentyone inches and hence they fly slowly and laboriously and a great effort is required to raise them from the ground however they run exceedingly fast  Gesner  They have twentyfour quills that are almost all equal in each wing and sixteen in the tail Schwenckfeld says that there are only fifteen but he is mistaken and the less excusable as there is perhaps not a single bird that has an odd number of tail quills The tail is marked near its extremity by a broad blackish bar interrupted only by the two middle quills I should not take notice of that circumstance were it not to confirm the remark of Willughby that in most birds the two middle quills do not follow the distance of the lateral ones but sometimes project beyond them and sometimes extend not so far so that in this case the interruption of colour appears to depend on the difference of their positionLike the other Grous their orbits are red the toes indented on the sides though more slightly the nail of the middle toe sharp and flat the legs clothed with feathers before but only as far as the middle of the tarsus the gizzard muscular the alimentary canal thirty inches and odd the appendices or  caeca  thirteen or fourteen inches striped with furrows  Willughby  the flesh white when dressed but more so within than  without and those who have examined it attentively pretend that they can distinguish four different colours in the same manner as three different flavours are found in the bustards and common grous However the flesh of the Hazel Grous is excellent and hence is derived it is said its Latin name  Bonasa  and also the Hungarian appellation  Tschasarmadar  or  Caesar's Bird  signifying that it was fit to be kept for the Emperor It is indeed highly esteemed and Gesner remarks that it is the only dish suffered to appear twice at princes' tables  In the kingdom of Bohemia it is as much eaten at Easter as lamb in France and it is customary to send it in presents from one person to another  Schwenckfeld    The Hazel Grous lives both in summer and winter on nearly the same food as that of the Common Grous We find in their stomach in the summer the berries of the servicetree of the bilberry the bramble and the heath the seeds of the Alpine elder the pods of the  saltarella  the catkins of the birch and of the hazel c and in winter we meet with juniper berries the buds of the birch the tops of heath fir juniper and of some other evergreens  Ray Schwenckfeld and Rzaczynski  When the Hazel Grous is kept in confinement it may be fed with wheat barley  and other grain but like the Common Grous it does not long survive the loss of its liberty  Gesner and Schwenckfeld  whether because it is shut up so closely as to affect its health or that its savage or rather generous nature will not brook the slightest encroachment on its freedom  The time of sport returns twice ayear in spring and in autumn but the latter season is the most favourable They are attracted by the sound of birdcalls which imitate their note and horses are led into the field because it is a vulgar opinion that the Hazel Grous are fond of these animals  Gesner  It has also been remarked by the sportsmen that if the cock be first caught the hen seeks her mate with anxious solicitude and returns several times to visit the spot with other males in her train but if the hen be first ensnared the cock joins another family and totally forgets his former attachments  Ibid  Certain it is that when one of these birds is surprised and roused it springs making a loud noise and perching on a tree it sits motionless and unconcerned while the sportsman meditates its destruction Commonly they settle on the centre of the tree where the boughs part from the trunk  As much has been said of the Hazel Grous many fables have been told the most absurd  are those concerning its manner of propagating Encelius and others assert that they copulate with their bills that the cocks themselves lay when they grow old and that their eggs being hatched by the toads produce wild basilisks in the same manner as the eggs of the common cocks if hatched by toads give birth to the domestic basilisks And lest we should entertain suspicions with regard to these basilisks Encelius describes one that he saw  In Gesner  but unfortunately he neither tells us whether he beheld it emerge from the egg or beheld this egg excluded by the male Most of these absurdities take their rise from the misrepresentation of facts and it is probable that the Hazel Grous bill like the turtle doves and toy with each other to raise the swell of love  According to the opinion of sportsmen the Hazel Grous comes in season in the months of October and November and at that time the males only are killed being decoyed by a kind of whistling analogous to the shrill note of the females they hasten to the spot making a loud rustling noise with their wings and are shot as soon as they alight  The females like other large birds form their nest on the ground and commonly conceal it under hazels or below the shade of a  broad mountain fern They commonly lay twelve or fifteen eggs and sometimes even twenty and these are somewhat larger than pigeons eggs  Schwenckfeld  They sit three weeks and have seldom more than seven or eight young  Frisch  which run as soon as they are hatched as usual in most of the shortwinged birds As soon as the young are able to fly the parents remove from the tract where they bred and being thus forsaken they pair and disperse to form new settlements and in their turn to send off other colonies  Gesner    The Hazel Grous delight in forests where they can find their proper sustenance and conceal themselves from the rapacious birds which they dread exceedingly and perch for shelter on the low branches  Ibid  Some affirm that they prefer the mountain forests but they also inhabit the woods that grow in the plains for they are plentiful in the neighbourhood of Nuremberg They are frequent also in the woods that clothe the bottom of the Alps and the Apennines They are found likewise in the mountain of Giants in Silesia in Poland c Anciently they were so numerous according to Varro in a little island in the Ligustic Sea now the Gulph  of Genoa that it was called the  Island of the Hazel Grous  Specific character of the Hazel Grous  TetraoBonasia  Its tailquills are cinereous with black dots and a black stripe except the two intermediate  It is larger than the English partridge It occurs in many parts of the north of Europe in Russia Siberia and Lapland It has a shrill piping note and may be decoyed by imitating the sound  The SCOTCH HAZEL GROUS  IF this bird be the same with the  Gallus palustris  of Gesner as Brisson thinks the figure which the German naturalist gives must undoubtedly be very inaccurate since no feathers are represented on the legs and on the other hand red barbils appear under the bill Is it not natural then to suspect that this figure belongs to a different bird However the  Woodcock  or  Cock of the Marsh  is excellent meat and all that we know of its history is that it delights in wet situations as its name denotes The Authors of the  British Zoology  suppose that what Brisson takes for the  Scotch Hazel Grous  is really the  Ptarmigan  in its summer garb and that its plumage becomes almost always white in winter But if this were the case it must also lose the feathers which cover the toes for Brisson expressly notices that it is only clothed to the origin of the toes and the ptarmigan in the British Zoology is feathered even to the nails besides these two birds as they are represented in the Zoology and in Brisson's work resemble each other neither in appearance nor structure Brisson's Scotch Hazel Grous is somewhat larger than ours and its  tail shorter it resembles that of the Pyrenees in the length of its wings its legs clothed before with feathers as far as the origin of the toes in the length of the middle toe compared with those on the sides and in the shortness of the hind toe it differs because its toes are not indented and its tail has not the two long narrow feathers which is the most obvious character of the Pyrenean Hazel Grous I need take no notice of the colours of the plumage the figure will convey a clearer idea than any description and besides nothing is more uncertain since they vary considerably in the same individual at different seasons  N  o  THE PINTAILED GROUS  The PINTAILED GROUS  La Ganga  vulgairement  La Gelinotte des Pyrenees  i e  The Ganga commonly called the Pyrenean Ptarmigan In Turkish  Kata  in Spanish  Ganga  Buff  TetraoAlchata  Linn Gmel Klein c  Bonasa Pyrenaica  Briss  The Partridge of Damascus  Will and Ray  The Kitiwiah  or  African Lagopus  Shaw  THOUGH there is a wide difference between words and things it often happens in natural history that the misapplication of terms is the source of multiplied mistakes we have therefore made it an invariable rule to discover as much as possible the true meaning of names  Brisson considering the Damascus or Syrian Partridge of Belon as the same species with his Pyrenean Hazel Grous ranges it among the appellations bestowed in different languages on that tribe and quotes Belon as his authority for the Greek name  But he is mistaken in two points First Belon tells us himself that the bird which he calls  the Damascus Partridge  is a different species from what authors term  Syroperdrix  which has a black plumage and a  red bill Secondly Brisson writing the word in Greek characters seems to insinuate that it is derived from that language while Belon positively mentions that it is originally Latin Lastly it is difficult to conceive what led Brisson to consider the  aenas  of Aristotle as the same species with his Pyrenean Hazel Grous for Aristotle classes his  aenas  which is the  vinago  of Gaza with the pigeons the turtles and the ringdoves in which he is followed by all the Arabians and he expressly mentions that like these birds it only lays two eggs at a time But we have already seen that the Hazel Grous lays a much greater number and consequently the  aenas  of Aristotle cannot be considered as the Pyrenean Hazel Grous and ought therefore to be referred to a different species  Rondelet conceived that the Greek word was not  but ought to be read  whose primitive signifies a  fibre  or  thread    because the flesh is so fibrous and hard that it must be flead before it can be eaten But if it were really the same bird with the Pyrenean Hazel Grous we might adopt the correction of Rondelet and yet give to the word  inas  a more happy explanation and more consistent with the genius of the Greek language which paints whatever it would express if we conceive it to denote the two threads or narrow feathers of the  tail of the Pyrenean Hazel Grous and which is their characteristical distinction But unfortunately Aristotle does not say a word concerning these threads which had escaped his observation nor does Belon take any notice of this circumstance in his description of the Damascus partridge Besides the name  From  wine  or  vinago  is more suitable to this bird as it arrives in Greece about the beginning of autumn which is the season of vintage for the same reason that in Burgundy a certain kind of thrushes are called by the people in that county  vinettes  It follows from what has been said that the  syroperdrix  of Belon and the  oenas  of Aristotle are not the Pyrenean Hazel or Pintailed Grous any more than the  alchata    alfuachat  and the  filacotona  which appear to be Arabian names and certainly denote a bird of the pigeon kind  On the other hand the Syrian bird which Edwards terms  the little heathcock with two threadlike feathers in the tail  and which the Turks call  kata  is really the same with the Pyrenean HazelGrous This author tells us that Dr Shaw names it  kittawiah  and that he only gives three toes to each foot but he alleges that the traveller has committed this oversight in not attending to the hind toe which is hid under the plumage of the legs Yet he had a little before mentioned and we readily  perceive it from the figure that the forepart only of the leg is covered with white feathers like hairs and it is difficult to conceive how the hind toe could be concealed under the anterior plumage It would be more natural to say that it escaped Dr Shaw's observation by its diminutive size for it is only two lines long The two lateral toes are also very short compared with the middle one and in them all the edges are marked with small indentings as in the common Grous The Pintailed or Pyrenean Hazel Grous seems therefore to be quite a distinct species from the true Hazel Grous For its wings are much broader in proportion to the rest of its body and consequently it must fly smoothly and rapidly and have habits different from those of tardy birds We learn from the observations of Dr Russel quoted by Edwards that it flies in numerous flocks and spends the greatest part of the year in the deserts of Syria and does not venture near the city of Aleppo except in the months of May and June when it is obliged to resort to places where it can get water We know too that the Hazel Grous is a timorous bird and never deems itself secure from the vultures talons unless concealed in the most shady trees The Pintailed Grous which the inhabitants of Catalonia call the  partridge of Garrira  Barrere  Ornithologia  is nearly the bulk of the gray partridge  the orbits are black nor are the eyebrows red or flame coloured the bill is almost straight the nostrils are placed at the base of the upper mandible and joining the feathers which cover the face the forepart of the leg is feathered to the origin of the toes the wings are of considerable length and the shafts of the quills are black the two quills in the middle of the tail are twice as long as the rest and very narrow where they project the lateral quills grow shorter and shorter until the last one We may remark that of all these properties which characterise the pretended Hazel Grous of the Pyrenees there is not one which exactly agrees with the Hazel Grous  Edwards and Brisson    The female is of the same size with the male but differs by its plumage the colours of which are fainter and by the filaments in the tail which are not so long It appears that the male has a black spot under its throat and that the female instead of this has three rings of the same colour which encircle its neck like a collar  I shall not attempt to describe the colours of the plumage I shall only observe that they have a great affinity to those of the bird known at Montpelier by the name of  angel  of which John Culmann communicated a description to Gesner  The feathers are of a dusky colour inclining to black and yellowish verging on rufous  says Gesner speaking of the  angel  Variegated with olive yellowish black and rufous  says Brisson in his description of the Pyrenean Hazel Grous  but the two long feathers of the tail  seem to be omitted in this description and also in the figure sent by Rondelet to Gesner of this same bird which he had taken for the  oenas  of Aristotle In short there seems to be reason to doubt the identity of these two species notwithstanding their correspondence in the plumage and in the place of residence unless we suppose that the subjects described by Culmann and designed by Rondelet were females in which the threads of the tail were much shorter and consequently less remarkable  This species is found in most of the warm countries in the ancient continent in Spain in the south of France in Italy in Syria in Turkey and Arabia in Barbary and even at Senegal for the bird figured in the  Planches Enluminées  by the name of the Senegal Hazel Grous is only a variety and somewhat smaller but has the same long feathers or threads in the tail the lateral quills become gradually shorter the farther they are placed from the middle the wings are very long the legs covered before with a white down the midtoe much longer than those near the sides and the hind one exceedingly short lastly it has no red skin over the eyes and differs from the Pintailed Grous only in being rather smaller and its plumage deeper tinged with reddish It is therefore only  a variety of the same species produced by the influence of climate and what ought to shew that this bird is different from the Hazel Grous and should therefore be distinguished by a diffrent name is that besides the disparity of figure it always inhabits the warm countries and never occurs in the cold or even the temperate climates whereas the Hazel Grous are rare except in chilly tracts  It may be proper in this place to transcribe what Dr Shaw informs us with respect to the  Kittawiah  or Barbary Hazel Grous and which is all we know on the subject that the reader may compare it with the Pintailed Grous or the Pyrenean Hazel Grous and judge if they are really two individuals of the same species  The  Kittawiah  or  African Lagopus  This name is improperly applied since the bird is not feathered under the toes  as we may call it is another bird of the gregarious and granivorous kind which likewise wanteth the hinder toe It frequenteth the most barren as the  Rhaad  doth the most fertile parts of these countries being in size and habit of body like the dove short feathered feet also as in some birds of that kind The body is of a livid colour spotted with black the belly blackish and upon the throat there is the figure of a half moon in a beautiful yellow The tip of each feather of the tail hath a white spot upon  it and the middle is long and pointed as in the  Merops  The flesh is of the same colour with the  Rhaad's  red upon the breast and white in the legs agreeing further in being not only of an agreeable taste but easy digestion  Shaw's Travels p  Specific character of the Pintailed Grous  TetraoAlchata  Above

the other so distinguished an appearance its neck is shorter and its body thicker the feet reddish furnished with spurs and not feathered as its toes are not indented in short it bears no resemblance at all to the bird which we at present consider  The ancients have said a great deal about the  attagas  or  attagen  for they use both names indifferently Alexander the Myndian tells us in his commentary on Athenaeus that it was rather larger than a partridge and its plumage which was of a reddish ground was mottled with several  colours Aristophanes had said nearly the same thing but Aristotle according to his commendable custom of marking the analogy between unknown objects and such as are common compares its plumage to that of the woodcock  Alexander the Myndian subjoins that its wings are short and its flight tardy and Theophrastus remarks that like the other heavy birds as the partridge the cock the pheasant c it is hatched without feathers and can run as soon as it quits the shell Like these also it welters in the dust  The ancients called these birds  Pulveratrices  which roll in dust to rid themselves of the insects that torment them in the same manner as the aquatic fowls seek to remove them by sprinkling water on their wings  and feeds on fruits devouring the berries and grain which it finds sometimes eating the plants themselves sometimes scraping the earth with its nails and as it runs more than it flies it was customary to hunt it with dogs and this chase was successful  Oppian  in Ixeuticis  This author adds that they are fond of stags and on the contrary have an aversion to cocks    Pliny Aelian and others say that these birds lose their cry with their liberty and that owing to the depression of their native faculties they are very difficult to tame Varro however instructs us how to breed them and the mode is nearly the same with that of raising peacocks pheasants Guinea fowls partridges c  Pliny informs us that this bird which had been very rare was become more common in  his time that it was found in Spain in Gaul and on the Alps but that those from Ionia were the most esteemed In another place he tells us that there were none in the island of Crete Aristophanes speaks of those found in the vicinity of Megara in Achaia Clement of Alexandria says that those from Egypt were reckoned the most delicious by the epicures Some there were also in Phrygia according to Aulus Gellius who describes it as an Asiatic bird Apicius directs us how to cook the Red Grous which he joins with the partridge and St Jerome mentions it in his letters as a most exquisite dish  You smell of Grous  Attagen  and yet boast of eating Goose  said St Jerome to an hypocrite who pretended to live on simple diet but in private regaled himself with delicacies    However to judge whether the  attagen  of the ancients is our Red Grous we must collect its history from the writings of the moderns and form the comparison  It appears that the word  attagen  though with various corruptions has generally been used by the modern authors who have written in Latin as the name of this bird  Attago    Actago    Atago    Atchemigi    Atacuigi    Tagenarios    Taginari  are all words corrupted from  Attagen  Gesner  It is true indeed that some ornithologists as Sibbald Ray Willughby and Klein have referred it to the  lagopus altera  of Pliny  Hist Nat lib x  but besides that Pliny only mentions it by the way and so cursorily as to give no precise  idea is it likely that this great naturalist who had treated at great length on the  attagen  in the same chapter would say a few words of it afterwards under another name and without giving notice This reflection is alone sufficient in my opinion to prove that the  attagen  of Pliny and his  lagopus altera  were different birds and we shall afterwards know what they really were  Gesner was told that this bird is commonly called  franguello  at Bologna but Aldrovandus who was a native of that place tells us that the name  franguello    hinguello  according to Olina was given commonly to the chaffinch and which is evidently derived from the Latin  fringilla  Olina subjoins that in Italy his  francolin  which we have said is a bird different from ours was generally named  franguellina  a word corrupted from  frangolino  and to which a feminine termination was added to distinguish it from  fringuello  I know not why Albin who has copied the description that Willughby gives of the  lagopus altera  of Pliny has changed the name into  Cock of the Marsh  unless because Tournefort says that the Samian  francolin  haunts marshes But if we compare the descriptions with the figures we shall readily perceive that the Samian  francolin  is entirely different from the bird which Albin or his translator has been pleased to term  Cock of the Marsh  since he had before applied the name of  francolin  to this Forkedtail Black Grous The Red Grous is called  duraz  or  alduragi  by the Arabians and the English name is derived from the red colour of its orbits and plumage some British naturalists have also termed it  perdrix asclepica  Johnston Charleton c    This bird is larger than the  bartavelle  and weighs about nineteen ounces its eyes are arched with two very broad red orbits formed by a fleshy membrane rounded and pared above and rising higher than the crown of the head the nostrils are shaded with small feathers which produce a fine effect the plumage is mixed with red black and white But the female has less of the red and more of the white than the male the membrane of the orbits not so prominent much less pared and of a fainter red in general the colours of its plumage are more dilute  British Zoology  besides it has not those black feathers dotted with white which in the male form the tuft on the head and a kind of beard under the bill  Aldrovandus    In both sexes the tail is nearly like that of the partridge but rather longer it consists of sixteen quills the two middle ones variegated  with the same colours with those on the back while the lateral are all black the wings are very short each containing twentyfour quills of which the third reckoning from the tip of the wing is the longest the legs are clothed with plumage to the toes according to Brisson and as far as the nails according to Willughby these nails are blackish and also the bill the toes of a deepgray edged with a narrow indented membranous belt Belon tells us that in his time  francolins  that is Red Grous were brought from Venice some of which had the plumage we have described and others were entirely white and were called in Italy by the same name Except in the colour the latter were exactly like the former and on the other hand they resembled so much the white partridge of Savoy that Belon conceives them to belong to another species which Pliny has termed the  lagopus altera  According to this idea which appears to me to be well founded the  attagen  of the Roman naturalist would be our  variegated Red Grous  and the second species of the  lagopus  would correspond to the  White Attagas  which is distinguished from the former by its white plumage and from the first kind of  lagopus  commonly termed the  White Partridge  by its size and its legs which are not feathered below  All these birds according to Belon live on seeds and insects the authors of the British Zoology add heath tops and mountain berries  The Red Grous is indeed an inhabitant of the elevated tracts Willughby informs us that it seldom ventures into the low country nor even descends to the sloping sides of the mountain but prefers to reside on the loftiest summits It is found in the Pyrenees the Alps the mountains of Auvergne of Dauphiné of Switzerland in Foix Spain England Sicily the canton of Vicenza and in Lapland  Klein  Lastly it inhabits Olympus in Phrygia where the modern Greeks call it  taginari  Belon  a word evidently derived from  which occurs in Suidas and is formed from  attagen  or  attagas  which must be considered as the primitive  Although this bird is naturally very shy the secret of breeding them in cages has been discovered in the island of Cyprus as formerly at Rome at least if the bird spoken of by Alexander Benedictus is the Red Grous What induces me to suspect this is that the francolin figured in the CCXLVIth plate of Edwards which was certainly brought from Cyprus is much more like the common sort than that of Olina and we know that the last can be kept in cages  Olinà    The domestic Red Grous is larger than the wild but this has a superior delicacy of flavour and is preferred to the Partridge At Rome the  francolino  is called the Cardinal's dish  Gesner  however it soon grows tainted and cannot be sent to a great distance The sportsmen take out its entrails the instant it is killed and stuff it with fresh heath  Willughby  Pliny makes the same remark with regard to the  lagopus  Lib x  and it must indeed be admitted that these birds bear a great analogy to each other  The Red Grous breed in the spring the female lays on the ground like all the large birds the eggs are eight or ten sharp at the one end eighteen or twenty lines in length and dotted with redbrown except in one or two places about the small end The incubation lasts twenty days the young remain with the mother and continue to follow her throughout the summer By winter they have almost attained their full size and they unite into flocks of forty or fifty and become completely wild In their infancy they are very subject to worms or  lumbrici  and sometimes they are observed to fly about with these hanging a foot from the  anus  Willughby and Pennant But have not these authors mistaken the protruded  penis  for a worm as I have seen chickens deceived in that way in regard to ducks    If we compare the accounts of the moderns in regard to the Red Grous with what the ancients have said on the same subject we find the former more accurate and full yet we have still facts enow from which we may conclude the identity of that bird with the  attagen  of antiquity  To conclude though I have been at pains to remove the confusion in which this subject is involved and to assign to each species the characters that have been indiscriminately bestowed I cannot expect that I have been equally successful in clearing every point The uncertainty which clouds our views is owing entirely to that latitude in the use of names in which naturalists have indulged themselves and which throws obstacles almost insurmountable on every attempt to connect our present information with the discoveries of past ages  Specific character of the Red Grous  Tetrao Scoticus  LATH  It is striated transversely with rufous and blackish its six exterior tailquills on either side blackish  Mr Pennant thinks that this bird is peculiar to Britain It occurs in Wales and in the north of England and is numerous in the Highlands of Scotland Its egg is elongated tawny marked with irregular bloodcoloured blotches having dots interspersed  The WHITE ATTAGAS  IT is found in the mountains of Switzerland and in those around Vicenza I have nothing to add to what has been said in the preceding article except that Gesner's second species of  lagopus  appears to be really one of these birds though the white of its plumage is pure only on the belly and the wings and is clouded with brown or black on the rest of the body for we have already seen that the colour of the male is not so deep as that of the female and we know that in most young birds and particularly of this kind it never acquires its due intensity till the second year Also Gesner's description suits this species exactly the eyebrows red naked curved and prominent the feet feathered as far as the nails but not below the bill short and black the tail also short its residing in the Swiss mountains c I should imagine that this bird was really a White Attagas a male and young weighing only fourteen ounces instead of nineteen the usual bulk  I would draw a similar conclusion with regard to Gesner's third species of  lagopus  which seems to be the same with what the Jesuit  Rzaczynski mentions by the Polish name  parowa  In both a part of the wings and belly is white the back and the rest of the body of a variegated colour their feet feathered their flight laborious their flesh excellent and their size equal to that of an ordinary hen Rzaczynski takes notice of two kinds the one small which I am at present considering the other larger and which is probably a species of the Hazel Grous This author subjoins that both birds are found entirely white in the Palatinate of Novogorod I do not class them with the Ptarmigan as Brisson has done Gesner's second and third species of  lagopus  because their feet are not feathered beneath which is the most ancient and decided character  The PTARMIGAN  In Norwegian  Rype  in Iceland the cock is called  Riupkarre  and the hen  Riupa    Le Lagopede  Buff  TetraoLagopus  Linn Gmel c  Lagopus  Pliny  Tetrao Mutus  Martin  White Game  Will  THIS bird has been called the  White Partridge  very improperly since it is not a partridge and is white only in winter on account of the intense cold to which it is exposed during that season on the lofty mountains of the North which it commonly inhabits Aristotle who was unacquainted with the Ptarmigan knew that partridges quails swallows sparrows ravens and even hares stags and bears suffer in similar situations the same change of colour  De coloribus  cap vi  and  Hist Anim  lib iii  Scaliger adds the eagles vultures sparrowhawks kites turtledoves and foxes  Exercitationes in Cardanum  and it would be easy to increase this list by the names of many birds and quadrupeds on which cold can produce similar effects We may therefore infer that the white colour is not  N  o  THE PTARMIGAN  permanent and cannot be considered as a discriminating character of the Ptarmigan especially as many species of the same genus as the Little White Grous according to Rzaczynski  Auctuarium Poloniae  and Dr Weygandt  Breslaw's Acts Nov  and the White Attagas according to Belon are liable to the same variations of colour It is astonishing that Frisch was not informed that his  White Mountain Francolin  which is the Ptarmigan is subject to this influence of cold for if he was acquainted with this fact it is equally strange that he has omitted to mention it He only says that he was told that no White Francolins could be met with in summer and therefore he tells us that they were sometimes found in summer no doubt with their wings and back brown but which he had never seen This was the place therefore where he ought to have added that they are white only in winter c  Aristotle as I have already said was unacquainted with the Ptarmigan what demonstrates the assertion is a passage in his Natural History where he says that the hare is the only animal whose feet are covered with fur on the sole but if he had known the fact he would certainly not have omitted in a place where he draws general comparisons to mention a bird that is distinguished by the same property  The name  Lagopus  is that which Pliny and other writers of antiquity have bestowed on this species of birds The moderns have therefore committed an impropriety when they have applied a word which marks the distinguishing character of the Ptarmigan to the nocturnal birds whose feet are feathered above and not below  Belon Willughby and Klein  Pliny adds that it is as large as a pigeon that it is white that it is excellent and that it resides on the summits of the Alps lastly that it is so wild that it can hardly be reduced to the domestic state and he concludes with telling us that its flesh soon runs into putrefaction  The laborious accuracy of the moderns has completed this sketch of antiquity They have noticed that glandulous skin which forms a sort of red eyebrows but of a brighter colour in the male than in the female it is also smaller in the latter and the two black streaks are wanting on the head which in the male stretch from the bottom of the bill to the eyes and even extend near the ears Except in this circumstance the male and female are perfectly alike in their external form and all that I shall afterwards mention on this subject will apply to both equally  The snowy colour of the Ptarmigan is not spread over its whole body but is stained even  in winter This exception obtains especially in the quills of the tail which are black with a little white at the point nor does it appear from the description that this colour tinges continually the same quills Linnaeus in his  Fauna Suecica  describes the middle ones as black and in his  Systema Naturae  he says with Brisson and Willughby that these are white and the lateral quills black These naturalists seem not to have examined their specimens with sufficient accuracy In the individual which I have caused to be figured and in others which I have viewed I found the tail composed of two rows of feathers one over the other the upper one entirely white and the under one black and each consisting of fourteen feathers  These cannot be counted exactly without plucking as we have done above and below the rump it was in this way that we ascertained that there were fourteen white above and as many black below  Klein takes notice of a bird which he received from Prussia on the th of January and which was perfectly white except the bill the lower part of the tail and the shafts of six quills of the wings The Lapland priest Samuel Rheen whom he quotes says that the Snow Fowl or Ptarmigan has not a single black feather except the female which has one of that colour in each wing And the white partridge of which Gesner speaks was indeed entirely white except round the ears where  there were some black marks the coverts of the tail which are white and extending its whole length conceal the black feathers are what have occasioned most of these mistakes Brisson reckons eighteen quills in the tail while Willughby and some other ornithologists reckon only sixteen and there are really only fourteen It would seem that the plumage of this bird how variable soever is more uniform than the naturalists represent it  It is not surprising that authors differ about the white or black colour of the lateral tailfeathers of this bird for in spreading out the tail with the hand it is easy to terminate the sides either by the black or the white feathers Daubenton the younger has well remarked that there is another method of settling the contradiction of authors and of shewing clearly that the tail consists only of fourteen quills all black except the outer one which is edged with white near its origin and the tip which is white in them all because the shafts of these fourteen black quills are twice as thick as the shafts of the fourteen white quills and do not project so far not overlapping entirely the shafts of the black quills so that we may regard these white feathers as only coverts though the four middle ones are as large as the black ones which are all very nearly equal in length  There are twentyfour quills in the wings the third one reckoning from the outer side is the longest and the first six have black shafts though the webs are white the down which shade the feet and toes as far as the nails is very thick and soft and it has been said that this is a kind of furgloves which nature has given to these birds to defend them from the intense cold of their native climates The nails are very long even that of  the little hind toe that of the midtoe is scooped lengthwise and its edges are sharp which enables it to form holes in the snow with ease  The Ptarmigan is at least as large as a tame pigeon according to Willughby its length is fourteen or fifteen inches the extent of its wings twentytwo inches and its weight fourteen ounces ours is rather smaller But Linnaeus remarks that they are of different sizes and that the smallest inhabits the Alps  Fauna Suecica  He subjoins indeed that the same bird is found in the forests of the northern countries and especially in Lapland which gives room to suspect that this species is different from our Alpine Ptarmigan which has different habits and prefers the lofty mountains unless perhaps we say that the cold which prevails on the summits of the Alps is nearly the same with what is experienced in the vallies and forests of Lapland But the disagreement of writers with respect to the cry of the Ptarmigan seems to prove decidedly that there is a confusion of species Belon says that it has the note of the partridge Gesner that the voice somewhat resembles that of a stag Linnaeus compares it to a prattling and jeering Lastly Willughby speaks of the feathers on its feet as a soft down  plumulis mollibus  and Frisch compares them to hogs  bristles But how can we reconcile such opposite qualities how refer such different characters to the same species There is reason then for the division which I have drawn between the Ptarmigans of the Alps the Pyrennees and such other mountains and the birds of the same genus that occur in the forests and even in the plains of the northern regions  We have already seen that in winter the Ptarmigan is robed in white in summer it is covered with brown spots which are scattered irregularly on a white ground It may be said however never to enjoy the solstitial warmth and to be determined by its singular structure to prefer the chilling frost for as the snow melts on the sides of the mountains the bird constantly ascends till it gains the summits where reigns eternal winter It would seem to be oppressed by the dazzle of the solar rays it withdraws from the lustre of day and forms holes and burrows under the snow It were curious to investigate the internal and intimate structure of the Ptarmigan and discover the reason why cold seems so necessary to its existence and why it so carefully shuns the presence of the sun while almost every animated being longs for his return and hails his approach as the father of Nature the source of delight whose benign influence inspires and enlivens all Must we ascribe it to the same causes  which make the nocturnal birds retire from his eslugence or is the Ptarmigan the  kakkerlac  of the winged tribe  Such a disposition however will evidently render this bird difficult to tame and Pliny expressly mentions the fact  Coll Acad Part Etrang i  Yet Redi speaks of two Ptarmigans which he calls  White Partridges of the Pyrenees  that were bred in the volery of the garden at Boboli belonging to the Grand Duke  The Ptarmigans fly in flocks but never soar aloft for they are heavy birds When they perceive any person they remain still on the snow to avoid being seen but they are often betrayed by their whiteness which surpasses the snow itself However whether through stupidity or inexperience they are soon reconciled to the sight of man they may often be caught by presenting bread or a hat may be thrown before them and a noose slipped round the neck while they are engaged in admiring this new object or they may be dispatched by the blow of a stick behind  Gesner  It is even said that they will not venture to pass a row of stones rudely piled like the foundation of a wall but will constantly travel close by the side of this humble barrier quite to the spot where the snares are placed  They live upon the buds and tender shoots of the pine the birch the heath whortle berry and other Alpine plants  Willughby Klein  It is to the nature of their food undoubtedly that we must ascribe the slight bitterness of their flesh  Gesner  which otherwise is excellent for the table it is darkcoloured and is a very common sort of game in Mount Cenis and in all the towns and villages near the mountains of Savoy  Belon  I have eaten of it and found it had much the flavour of hare  The females lay and hatch their eggs on the ground or rather on the rocks  Gesner Rzaczynski  this is all that we know with regard to their propagation We should require wings to study the instincts and habits of birds especially of those that will not bend to the yoke of domestication and which delight in deserts  The Ptarmigan has a very thick craw and a muscular gizzard in which small stones are found mixed with its aliments The intestines are thirtysix or thirtyseven inches long the  coeca  are thick fluted and very long but not uniform and are according to Redi full of minute worms  Coll Acad Part Etrang tome i  the coats of the small intestine are covered with a curious network formed by a multitude of small vessels or rather of little wrinkles disposed regularly  Klein Willughby  It has been observed that its heart is somewhat  smaller and its spleen much smaller than in the Red Grous  Roberg  apud Kleinum  and that the cystic and hepatic ducts join the intestines at a considerable distance from each other  Redi Collect Acad Part Etrang tome i      I cannot close this article without observing with Aldrovandus that Gesner joins to the different names which have been given to the Ptarmigan that of  urblan  conceiving it to be an Italian word used in Lombardy yet this term is totally unknown both in the language of Italy and in that which is spoken in Lombardy The same perhaps may be said of the words  rhoncas  and  herbey  which according to the same author the Grisons who speak Italian bestow on the Ptarmigan In the part of Savoy which borders on the Valais it is called  arbenne  which being corrupted by the pronunciation of the Swiss and Grison peasants might pass changed into some of the words just mentioned  Specific character of the Ptarmigan  TetraoLagopus  It is cinereous its toes shaggy its wingquills white its tailquills black and white at the tip the intermediate ones white  The Ptarmigan occurs sometimes in the colder parts of England and is pretty frequent in the Highlands of Scotland Its egg is pale rufous with dusky red spots  The Greenlanders catch the Ptarmigan by slipping a noose over its neck Sometimes they kill it with stones but now they commonly shoot it They eat the bird with seals fat trainoil and berries and esteem the repast a great luxury They make shirts of its plumage  The Laplanders take these birds by forming a hedge of birchenhoughs and leave certain intervals in which they hang snares  HUDSON's BAY PTARMIGAN  Tetrao Albus  Ripa Major  Schoef  The White Partridge  Edw  The White Grous  Penn and Lath  THE authors of the British Zoology justly blame Brisson for classing the Ptarmigan with Edwards's White Partridge since they are distinct species for the latter is thrice as large as the Ptarmigan and the colours of their summer garb are also very different the White Partridge having broad spots of white and deep orange and the Ptarmigan streaks of a dusky brown on a light brown The same authors admit that in winter both birds are alike almost entirely white Edwards says that the lateral quills of the tail are black even in winter and only tipt with white and yet he afterwards subjoins that one of these which had been killed in that season and brought from Hudson'sbay by Light was of a snowy white which still more shews that in this species the colours of the plumage are variable  The White Grous is of a middle size between the partridge and the pheasant and its shape would resemble that of the former if its tail  were somewhat shorter The one represented in Edwards Pl LXXII is a cock such as it is in spring when it begins to drop its winter's robe and feel the influence of the season of love its eyebrows are red and more prominent and in short like those of the Red Grous it has also small white feathers round the eyes and others at the bottom of the bill which cover the nostrils the two middle feathers are variegated like those of the neck the two succeeding are white and all the rest blackish tipt with white both in summer and winter  The livery of summer extends only over the upper part of the body the belly continues always white the feet and toes are entirely covered with feathers or rather with white hairs the nails are less curved than usual in birds  We have seen two birds brought from Siberia under the name of  Ptarmigans  which were probably the same species with that of Hudson's Bay and whose nails were so flat that they resemble more the nails of Apes than the claws of birds    The White Grous resides the whole year in Hudson'sbay it passes the night in holes that it makes in the snow which in these arctic countries resembles fine sand In the morning it emerges from its retreat and flies directly upwards shaking the snow from off its wings It feeds in the morning and evening and does not seem to dread the sun like the Ptarmigan of the Alps since it spends whole days exposed to his rays even in the middle of the day when they  are most forcible Edwards received this same bird from Norway which appears to me to form the shade between the Ptarmigan and the Red Grous having the feet of the one and the large eyebrows of the other  Specific character of the White Grous  TetraoAlbus    It is orange variegated with black stripes and white dashes its toes shaggy its tailquills black and white at the tip the intermediate ones entirely white  The White Grous are amazingly numerous about Hudson's Bay where they breed all along the coast and lay about ten eggs sprinkled with black In the beginning of October they assemble in some hundreds and live among the willows whose tops they crop Hence they are styled  Willow Partridges  In December they retire to the mountains to feed on cranberries for in that frightful climate the cold is so intense that the snow appears like fine powder which in the depth of winter is in a great measure swept by the winds from the uplands and carried into the plains These birds are generally tame as chickens if they chance to be unusually shy they may be soon hunted and worn out till they sink into their natural security They are esteemed excellent meat and much sought for by the servants of the Hudson's Bay Company They are commonly taken with nets of twine twenty feet square set inclined into which they are driven Ten thousand are often caught in the course of the winter  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE GROUS  I The CANADA HAZEL GROUS  La Gelinotte du Canada  Buff  Tetrao Canadensis  Linn and Gmel  Lagopus Freti Hudsonis  Klein  The Black and Spotted Heathcock  Edw  The Spotted Grous  or  Wood Partridge  Penn and Lath  IT would seem that the Hazel Grous of Canada and the Hazel Grous of Hudson's Bay as described by Brisson and designed by Edwards are the same species  It is frequent through the whole year in the country bordering on Hudson's Bay and prefers the plains and low grounds whereas in another climate the same bird says Ellis is found in the highest tracts and even on the summit of mountains In Canada it is called the Partridge  The male is smaller than the common Hazel Grous its eyebrows red its nostrils covered with small black feathers the wings short the feet clothed below the tarsus the toes and nails gray the bill black In general its colour is very dusky and is brightened only by a few white  spots round the eyes on the flanks and on some other parts  The female is smaller than the male and the colours of its plumage lighter and more variegated in other respects it is precisely alike  These birds feed on pine cones juniperberries c They are numerous in the northern countries of America and are stored up for winter's provisions the frost preserves them from prutrefaction and they are thawed in cold water when they are to be used  Specific character of the  Tetrao Canadensis    Its tailquills are black fulvous at the tip two white dashes at the eyes  By the English settlers at Hudson's Bay it is called the  Wood Partridge  because it usually lives among the pines It is a very stupid bird often knocked down with a stick and commonly caught by the Indians with a noose In summer it lives on berries in winter it crops the shoots of the spruce fir which gives its flesh a disagreeable taste It is said to lay only five eggs  II The RUFFED HEATHCOCK Or The LARGE HAZEL GROUS OF CANADA  Tetrao Togatus  Linn and Gmel  Bonasa Major Canadensis  Briss  The Shoulderknot Grous  Lath  Though Brisson conceives this bird also as a distinct species from the ruffed Hazel Grous of Pennsylvania it is highly probable that they are  really the same and to this species must we refer too the ruffed Heathcock of Edwards If we consider that Edwards's figure was taken from a living bird in loveseason and that Brisson's was copied from a dead subject if we make allowance for the liberties which are suggested by the fancy of the designer we may disregard the minute disparities  It is rather larger than the ordinary Hazel Grous and like it the wings are short and the feathers that cover the feet reach not to the toes but it has neither the red eyebrows nor the ring of that colour which encircles the eyes What distinguish it are the two tufts of feathers which rise from the upper part of the breast one on each side and project beyond the rest and bend downwards the feathers which form these are of a fine black the edges beaming with different reflections of gold green The bird can expand at pleasure these false wings which when closed fall on both sides on the upper part of the true the bill toes and nails are of a reddish brown  This bird is according to Edwards very common in Maryland and Pennsylvania where it is called the  pheasant  But its instincts and habits are much nearer those of the Grous It is of a middle size between that of the pheasant and the partridge its feet are feathered and its toes indented on the edges like those of the Grous its bill is similar to that of a common cock its  nostrils are shaded with small feathers which rise from the bottom of the bill and point forward the whole upper part of the body including the head the tail and the wings are mailed with different brown colours more or less brightened with the mixture of orange and black the throat is of a brilliant orange though rather deep the stomach the belly and the thighs are marked with black spots in the shape of a crescent and strewed with regularity on a white ground it is furnished with long feathers round the head and neck which it can erect at will and form a crest or ruff and this it generally does in the season of its amours it also spreads the tailquills like a fan inflates its craw trails its wings and rustles with a whirring noise like a turkeycock it summons its females also by a very odd sort of clapping the wings which is so loud as to be heard at halfamile's distance in calm weather  Mr Bartram says that the people of Pennsylvania call this the  thumping  of the ruffed Grous  It takes this kind of exercise in spring and autumn which are the seasons of breeding and repeats it every day at stated hours viz at nine o'clock in the morning and four o'clock in the afternoon and this always sitting on a dead trunk At first it strikes slowly allowing an interval of two seconds between each beat but it gradually quickens the strokes which at last become so rapid as to appear a  continued sound resembling the noise of a drum or according to some the muttering of distant thunder This noise lasts about a minute and after a repose of seven or eight minutes it again renews and passes through the same gradations Such is the call which invites the female to the feast of love but what announces a future generation is often the signal for the destruction of the present The sportsman led by the noise approaches the bird unperceived and when the male is dissolved in convulsions of pleasure he takes the fatal aim If the bird however observe the person it stops its motions and flies off three or four hundred pacesThese are really the instincts and habits of the European Grous though the singularities are rather heightened  The common food of those in Pennsylvania is grain fruits wild grapes and above all ivy berries which is the more extraordinary as these prove fatal to other animals  They hatch only twice a year probably in spring and autumn which are the two seasons when the male beats his wings They make their nests on the ground with leaves or by the side of a fallen trunk or at the foot of a tree all which habits indicate a heavy bird They lay from twelve to sixteen eggs and sit about three weeks The mother has the safety of her young much at heart she risks every thing in their defence and exposes herself to all the  dangers that menace their destruction The tender brood are themselves dexterous in searching for a concealment beneath the leaves But all these precautions are insufficient to elude the dreaded assaults of the birds of prey The little family continues united till the glow of the following spring inspires new appetites and disperses its members  These birds are exceedingly wild and can never be tamed If they are hatched under common hens they fly almost as soon as they burst from the shell and hide themselves in the forests The flesh is white and an excellent meat and may not this be the reason why the rapacious birds chase them with such perseverance We have already mentioned the conjecture in treating of the European Grous if it were confirmed by a sufficient number of observations we might infer that voracity does not always exclude predilection but that the birds of prey have nearly the same taste as man and this would afford another analogy between those two species  Specific character of the Ruffed Grous  TetraoUmbellus  It has a ruff about its neck  Its flesh is lean dry close and exceedingly white yet if well cooked it is excellent food The bird builds its nest on dry ground and hatches nine young The mother clucks to her chickens and gathers them under her wings  III The LONGTAILED GROUS  Tetrao Phasianellus  Lin and Gmel  The Sharptailed Grous  Penn  The American bird which may be called the Longtailed Hazel Grous designed and described by Edwards under the name of the  Hudson'sBay HeathCock  or  Grous  but which appears to me to be more related to the Hazel Grous The individual represented in Edwards Plate CXVII is a female with the size colour and long tail of the pheasant the plumage of the male is of a deeper shining brown with various reflections near the neck and he stands very erect with a bold aspect differences which are invariable between the male and female in all birds of this kind Edwards did not venture to give red eyebrows to this female because he only saw a stuffed specimen in which that character was not sufficiently distinct the legs were rough the toes indented on the edges and the hind toe very short  At Hudson's Bay this bird is called a  pheasant  The long tail indeed forms a sort of shade between the hazel grous and the pheasants The two middle quills of the tail project  two inches farther than the two following on either side and thus gradually shorten These birds are also found in Virginia in the woods and the unfrequented parts  Specific character of the Longtailed Grous  Tetrao Phasianellus    Its tail is wedgeshaped its head its neck and the upper side of its body are brickcoloured striped with black  In Hudson's Bay it lives among the larch bushes feeds on berries in summer and on the buds of larch and birch in winter It lays from nine to thirteen eggs The cock has a very shrill sort of a crow not very loud When disturbed or on wing he repeats the sound  cuck    cuck  and cracks the feathers of his tail The flesh of these birds is gray fat and juicy  N  o  THE CRESTED PEACOCK  The PEACOCK  In Greek  or  perhaps from  to stretch on account of the length of its tail in the Aeolian dialect it was pronounced  and hence the Latin  Pavo  and its names in the modern languages in Italian  Pavone  in Spanish  Pavon  in French  Paon  in German  Pfau  in Polish  Paw  and in Swedish  Paofogel    Le Paon  Buff  Pavo Cristatus  Linn and Gmel  The Crested Peacock  Lath  IF empire belonged to beauty and not to strength the Peacock would undoubtedly be king of the birds for upon none of them has Nature poured her treasures with such profusion Dignity of appearance nobleness of demeanour elegance of form sweetness and delicacy of proportions whatever marks distinction and commands respect have been bestowed A light waving tuft painted with the richest colours adorns its head and raises without oppressing it Its matchless plumage seems to combine all that delights the eye in the soft delicate tints of the finest flowers all that dazzles it in the sparkling lustre of the gems and all that astonishes it in the grand display of the rainbow But not only has Nature united in the plumage  of the Peacock to form a masterpiece of magnificence all the colours of heaven and earth she has selected mingled shaded melted them with her inimitable pencil and formed an unrivalled picture where they derive from their mixture and their contrast new brilliancy and effects of light so sublime that our art can neither imitate nor describe them  Such appears the plumage of the Peacock when at ease he saunters alone in a fine vernal day But if a female is presented suddenly to his view if the fires of love joined to the secret influence of the season rouse him from his tranquillity and inspire him with new ardour and new desires his beauties open and expand his eyes become animated and expressive his tuft flutters on his head and expresses the warmth that stirs within the long feathers of the tail rising display their dazzling richness the head and neck bending nobly backwards trace their shadow gracefully on that shining ground where the sunbeams play in a thousand ways continually extinguished and renewed and seem to lend new lustre more delicious and more enchanting new colours more variegated and more harmonious each movement of the bird produces new shades numberless clusters of waving fugitive reflections which ever vary and ever please  It is then that the Peacock seems to spread out all his beauties only to delight his female who  though denied the rich attire is captivated with its display the liveliness which the ardor of love mingles with his gestures adds new grace to his movements which are naturally noble and dignified and which at this time are accompanied with a strong hollow murmur expressive of desire  Running forward with a creeking noise  PALLADIUS    But this brilliant plumage which surpasses the glow of the richest flowers like them also is subject to decay and each year the Peacock sheds his honours  It loses its feathers with the first fall of the leaves and recovers them again when the buds burst forth  ARISTOTLE  Hist An  As if ashamed at the loss of his attire he avoids being seen in this humiliating condition and conceals himself in the darkest retreats till a new spring restores his wonted ornaments and again introduces him to receive the homage paid to beauty for it is pretended that he is really sensible to admiration and that a soothing and attentive gaze is the most certain means to engage him to display his decorations but the look of indifference chills his vivacity and makes him close his treasures  Though the Peacock has been long naturalized in Europe it is not a native of this quarter of the globe The East Indies the climate that produces the sapphire the ruby and the topaz must be considered as the original  country of the most beautiful of birds Thence it passed into the western parts of Asia where according to the express testimony of Theophrastus quoted by Pliny it had been introduced from abroad  Theophrastus relates that even in Asia the pigeons and peacocks are of foreign extraction  PLIN lib x  But it does not appear to have been carried thither from the eastern part of Asia or China for travellers agree that though very common in the East Indies it is not indigenous in China which at least proves it to be a rare bird in that country  Navarette  Description de la Chine    Aelian informs us that Greece received this beautiful bird from the Barbarians  Hist Anim  lib v  who must have been the people of India since Alexander who traversed Asia and was well acquainted with Greece first met with the Peacock in that country  Id ibid  and besides in no region of the globe is the tribe so numerous as in that oriental clime Mandeslo and Thevenot saw them in profusion in the province of Guzarat Tavernier in every part of India but particularly in the territories of Baroche Cambaya and Broudra Francis Pyrard in the vicinity of Calicut the Dutch on the Malabar coast Lintscot in the island of Ceylon the Author of the Second Voyage to Siam in the forests on the frontiers of that kingdom on the side of Cambogia and near the banks  of the river Meinam Gentil at Iva Gemelli Carreri in the Calamian islands lying between the Philippines and Borneo if to these authorities we add that in all these countries the Peacocks live in the wild state and that they are no where else so large  The largest Peacocks are found in India  AELIAN lib xxvi  or so prolific  Peter Martyr  de Rebus Oceani  says that in India the Peahens lay from twenty to thirty eggs  we cannot hesitate to conclude that the East Indies is their native abode That beautiful bird must owe its birth to the luxurious climate where Nature lavishly pours her riches where gold and pearls and gems and precious stones are scattered with profusion This opinion is countenanced by Holy Writ Peacocks are enumerated among the valuable and rare commodities that were every three years imported by Solomon's fleet which being fitted out in the Red Sea and not being able to venture at a distance from the shore must obviously have drawn its riches either from India or the eastern coast of Africa Nor is it probable that the latter was the place that furnished these luxuries for no traveller has ever seen wild Peacocks in Africa or the adjacent islands except at St Helena where Admiral Verhowen shot some that could not be caught But it is not probable that Solomon's fleet could sail every three years to Madeira without a mariner's  compass where besides they could obtain neither gold nor silver nor ivory nor scarce any thing which they might want I should even imagine that in this island which is above three hundred leagues from the continent there were no Peacocks in Solomon's time and that those found there by the Dutch had been left by the Portuguese and had multiplied exceedingly in the wild state especially as it is said that no venomous creature or voracious animal exists in St Helena  Nor can we doubt that the Peacocks which Kolben saw at the Cape of Good Hope and which he says are exactly like those of Europe though the figure that he gives is widely different  Hist Gen des Voyages  tome v pl  had the same origin with those at St Helena and had been carried thither in some of those European ships which are continually visiting that coast  The same may be said of those seen by travellers in the kingdom of Congo  Voyage de P VanBrooek  in the  Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi a l'etablissement de la Compagnie des Indes  tome iv p  with the turkies which undoubtedly are not natives of Africa and of those also that are found on the confines of Angola in a wood inclosed by a wall where they are bred for the king of the country  Relation de Pigafetta  p  This conjecture is corroborated  by the testimony of Bosman who expressly mentions that there are no Peacocks on the Gold Coast and that the bird taken by de Foquembrog and others for a Peacock is quite different and called  Kroon vogel  Voyage de Guinée  Lettre xv    Besides the term  African Peacock  bestowed by most travellers on the  Demoiselle of Numidia  Labat  Voyage de M de Genes au detroit de Magellan  is a direct proof that Africa is not the natal region of the Peacock If they were anciently seen in Lybia as Eustathius relates they were certainly transported from India to that country which is the part of Africa next to Palestine nor does it appear that they were naturalized in that country or multiplied fast since severe laws were passed against killing or wounding them  Aldrovandus    We may therefore presume that Solomon's fleet did not import these rarities from the African coast but from the shores of Asia where they abound living in a state of nature and multiplying without the assistance of man and where they are larger and more prolific than in other countries as is the case with all animals in their congenial climate  From India they migrated into the western part of Asia Accordingly we learn from Diodorus Siculus that they abounded in Babylon  In Media also they were bred in such numbers that the bird was called  Avis Medica  Aldrovandus  Philostratus speaks of those of Phasis which had a blue crest  Idem  and travellers have seen some of that kind in Persia  Thevenot  Voyage du Levant    From Asia they were transported into Greece where at first they were so rare as to be exhibited in Athens for thirty years at the monthly festivals as an object of curiosity which drew crouds of spectators from the neighbouring towns  The Peacock was at Athens shewn for a stated price to both men and women who were admitted to the spectacle at the feasts of the new moon Considerable sums were thus collected and many through curiosity came from Lacedaemon and Thessaly  AELIAN  Hist Anim  vol  We cannot fix the date of this event but we are certain that it was after the return of Alexander from India and we know that he first stopped at the island of Samos The conqueror was so delighted with the rich plumage of the Peacocks that he enacted severe penalties against killing them But it is very probable that soon after his time and even before the close of his reign they were become common for we learn from the poet Aristophanes who was contemporary with that hero and survived him that a single pair brought into Greece had multiplied so rapidly that they were as numerous as quails and  besides Aristotle who outlived his pupil only two years speaks in several parts of his work of Peacocks as wellknown birds  Secondly That the isle of Samos was the first station of Alexander on his return from India is probable from its proximity to Asia and is besides proved by the express testimony of Menodotus  There are the Peacocks sacred to Juno they being first reared in Samos and thence carried into other countries as the cocks from Persis and the Meleagrides from Aeolia or Aetolia  ATHENAEUS  Some indeed have given a forced interpretation of this passage and resting on the authority of some very ancient medals of Samos in which Juno is represented with a Peacock at her feet  Some of these are still to be seen and even medallions which represent the temple of Samos with Juno and her Peacocks  TOURNEFORT's  Voyage to the Levant  have pretended that Samos was the primitive abode of that bird from whence it has been dispersed to the east and the west But if we examine the words of Menodotus we shall find that they mean no more than that Samos was the first part in Europe where the Peacocks were bred in the same manner as the Pintadoes which are well known to be African birds were seen in Aeolia or Aetolia before they were introduced into the rest of Greece and especially as the climate of Samos is particularly suited to them  Foreign flocks of Peacocks are said to subsist wild on the island of Samos in the grove of Juno  VARRO  de Re Rustica  lib iii  and they lived there in the state  of nature and as Aulus Gellius considered those of that island as the most beautiful of all  Noct Attic  l vii c    These reasons are more than sufficient to account for the epithet of Samian bird which some authors have bestowed on the Peacock but the term can no longer be applied since Tournefort never mentions the Peacock in his description of that island and says that it is full of partridges woodcocks thrushes wildpigeons turtles becafigoes and excellent poultry and it is not probable that Tournefort would include so distinguished a bird in the generic term  poultry  After the Peacock was transplanted from Asia into Greece it found its way into the south of Europe and gradually was introduced into France Germany Switzerland  The Swiss are the only people who have endeavoured to extirpate this beautiful species of bird and with as much pains as other nations have bestowed in rearing them The reason is somewhat whimsical the crest of the Dukes of Austria against whom they had revolted was a Peacock's tail  and as far as Sweden where indeed they are very rare and require great attention  Linnaeus  and even suffer an alteration in their plumage  Lastly The Europeans who by the extent of their commerce and navigation connect the whole inhabited world have spread them along the African coasts and adjacent islands and  afterwards introduced them into Mexico Peru and some of the Antilles  Histoire des Incas  as St Domingo and Jamaica where they now are numerous  Charlevoix's History of St Domingo  and  Ray's Synopsis of Birds  though there were none prior to the discovery of America The Peacock is a heavy bird as the ancients well remarked  They can neither soar high nor fly to great distances  COLUMELLA  the shortness of its wings and the length of its tail check its aërial course and as it with difficulty subsists in a northern climate  They live sometimes with us especially in the aviaries of the great but require attention  LINNAEUS  it could never migrate into the new world  The Peacock has scarcely less ardour for the female or contends with less obstinacy than the common cock  Columella de Re Rustica lib viii  His passions must even be more fiery if it be true that when he has only one or two hens he teazes and fatigues them and even induces sterility and disturbs the work of generation by his immoderate use of venery In this case the eggs are ejected from the oviduct before they have time to ripen  Id Ibid  and for this reason he ought to be allowed five or six females  I here give the opinion of the ancients for intelligent persons whom I have consulted and who have reared Peacocks in Burgundy assure me from experience that the males never fight and that hey require each only one or two females at most But perhaps this coolness of passion is owing to the nature of the climate  whereas when the ordinary cock  who can satisfy the wants of fifteen or twenty hens is reduced to one he makes her the mother of a numerous brood  The peahens are also of an amorous mould and when deprived of the males they toy with each other and welter in the dust but the eggs which they lay are then void of the principle of life This happens commonly in the spring when the return of soft and genial warmth awakens nature from her torpor and gives a new stimulus to the appetite which prompts every animated being to reproduce its species Hence perhaps the reason why such eggs were termed zephyrian  ova zephyria  not because the gentle zephyrs were imagined capable of impregnating them but because the vernal season is fanned by light airs and even depicted by the zephyrs  Windeggs  is their common name in English because they want the outer shell and are flaccid as if inflated with air Perhaps this was also the reason of the ancient epithet Zephyrian    I could easily believe that the sight of the male strutting round them displaying his tail and shewing every expression of desire would still more excite them and make them lay more of these addle eggs but I will never be persuaded that the caresses distant gestures and light flutterings would effect a real fecundation without the more intimate union and the more vigorous compressions of the male And the peahens which some have fancied to be impregnated  by the influence of love glances must have been covered before though unobserved  Belon makes the same remark    These birds according to Aristotle attain their full vigour in three years  Hist Anim lib vi  Collumella  De Re Rustica lib viii  is of the same opinion and Pliny repeats the words of Aristotle with some slight alterations  The first year it lays one or two eggs the second four or five and in the following years not more than twelve  Lib x  Varro fixes the period at two years  Lib iii  and people who are well acquainted with these birds inform me that in our climate the female begins to lay at the end of the year though the eggs are then certainly addle But almost all agree that the age of three years is the term when the Peacock has acquired his full growth and is fit to perform the office of the male and that the power of procreating is announced by a new and splendid production this is the long and beautiful feathers of the tail which they display as they strut and expand their fan  Pliny lib x  the surplus nourishment being no longer directed to the growth of the individual is spent on the reproduction of the species  The spring is the season when these birds seek to couple  About the ides of February before the month of March  COLUMELLA  and if we would forward the union we must according to Columella's direction  give them every five days in the morning while fasting beans slightly roasted  COLUMELLA    The female lays her eggs soon after fecundation she does not exclude one every day but only once in three or four days and according to Aristotle she has but one hatch in the year which consists in the first of eight eggs and in the following years of twelve But this must be understood of those peahens that both lay their eggs and rear their young for if the eggs be removed as fast as they are laid and are placed under a common hen  Aristotle says that an ordinary hen cannot hatch more than two peahens' eggs but Columella allows five of these eggs in addition to four common eggs He advises to remove the eggs the tenth day and substitute an equal number of the same kind recently laid in order that they may be hatched along with the peahen's eggs which require ten days longer incubation Lastly he directs that these be turned every day if the sitter be unable to do it on account of their bulk which it is easy to discover by marking the eggs on one side  they will according to Columella have three hatches in the course of the year the first of five eggs the second of four and the third of two or three It would seem that in this country they are not so prolific since they lay scarcely four or five eggs in the year On the other hand they appear to be far more prolific in India where according to Peter Martyr they lay twenty or thirty as I have already noticed The temperature of a climate has a mighty influence on whatever relates to generation  and this is the key to those apparent contradictions which are found between the writings of the ancients and our own observations In a warm country the males are more ardent fight with each other require more females and these lay a greater number of eggs but in a cold country the latter are not so prolific and the former are calm and indifferent  If the peahen be suffered to follow the bent of instinct she will lay her eggs in a secret retired spot the eggs are white and speckled like those of the turkeyhen and nearly of the same size It is asserted that she is very apt to lay in the night or rather carelessly drop the eggs from the roost on which she is perched and for this reason it is advised to spread straw underneath to prevent their being broken by the fall  Columella lib viii    During the whole time of incubation the peahen anxiously shuns the male and is particularly careful to conceal her track when she returns from the nest for in this species as in the gallinaceous tribe and many others  Aristotle Hist Anim lib vi  the male burning with lust and faithless to the intentions of nature is more earnest in the pursuit of pleasure than solicitous about the multiplication of the race If he discovers his mate sitting on her eggs he breaks them probably to remove an obstacle to the gratification of his passions  Some have imagined that it was from the desire of covering them himself  Aldrovandus  which would be a very different motive Natural history will continually be clouded with uncertainties to remove them we ought to observe every thing ourselves but who is able for the task  The peahen sits from twentyseven to thirty days more or less according to the temperature of the climate and the warmth of the season  Aristotle lib vi  and  Pliny lib x  During that time a sufficient supply of food ought to be set within their reach that they may not be obliged to stray in search of subsistence and allow their eggs to cool and care must be taken not to teaze or disturb them in their nest for if they perceive that they are discovered they will be filled with disquietude abandon their eggs and begin to make a second hatch which is not likely to succeed because of the lateness of the season  It is said that the peahen never hatches all her eggs at once but as soon as a few chickens emerge she leaves the nest to lead them about In this case the eggs that are left should be set under another hen or placed in a stove for incubation  Maison Rustique tome i p    Aelian tells us that the peahen does not sit constantly on her eggs but sometimes leaves  them two days together which suspends the progress of incubation But I should imagine that there is some mistake in the text of Aelian which refers to the hatching what Aristotle and Pliny mention with regard to the laying which is really liable to interruptions of two or three days whereas such interruptions in the sitting seem to be inconsistent with the law of nature observed by all the known species of birds unless when the heat of the climate approaching that of incubation dispenses with it as unnecessary  As in the case of the Ostrich    After the young are hatched they ought to be left under the mother for twentyfour hours and then removed to the coop  Columella lib viii  Frisch advises them not to be restored to their dam till some days after  Their first food must be barleymeal soaked in wine wheat steeped in water or even pap boiled and allowed to cool Afterwards they may have fresh curd from which the whey is well pressed mixed with chopped leeks and even grasshoppers of which they are very fond but the legs must be previously removed from these insects  Columella lib viii  When they are six months old they will eat wheat barley the dregs of cyder and perry and even crop the tender grass but that sort of nourishment is not sufficient though Athenaeus represents them as  graminivorous  It is observed that on the first days after hatching the mother never leads her young to the ordinary nest or even sits with them twice in the same place and as they are delicate and cannot mount on the trees they are exposed to many accidents At this time therefore we ought to watch them closely and discover where the mother resorts and put the brood in a coop or in the field in a patch inclosed with hurdles c  Maison Rustique tome i p  Till they grow stout the young Peacocks trail their wings  Belon  and make no use of them In their early essays to fly the mother takes them every evening one after another on her back and carries them to the branch on which they are to pass the night In the morning she descends before them from the tree and encourages them by her example to trust themselves to their slender pinions  Maison Rustique tome i p    A peahen or even a common hen can breed twentyfive young Peacocks according to Columella but only fifteen according to Palladius and this last number is even too great for cold countries where they must be warmed from time to time and sheltered under the mother's wing  It is said that the common hen when she sees a hatch of young Peacocks is so pleased with their beauty that she grows disgusted with her  own chickens and attaches herself to the strangers  Columella lib viii  I mention this circumstance not as a fact that is ascertained but as one that deserves to be inquired into  As the young Peacocks grow strong they begin to fight especially in warm countries and for this reason the ancients who seem to have bestowed more attention than we in training these birds  Id ibid  kept them in small separate huts  Varro  De Re Rustica  lib iii  But the best places for breeding were according to them the islets which are so numerous on the Italian coasts  Columella  loco citato  for instance that of Planasia belonging to the Pisans  Varro  loco citato  Such a spot indeed allowed them to follow freely the bent of nature without danger of escaping since they are unable to fly to a distance and cannot swim and at the same time they had nothing to apprehend from rapacious animals which were entirely extirpated from the little island They lived there at ease without constaint and without disquietude they thrived better and what was not overlooked by the Romans their flesh acquired a finer relish and to have them under their eye and to examine whether their numbers increased or diminished they accustomed them every day at a stated hour on the display of a certain signal  to come round the house and they threw a few handfuls of grain to draw them together  Columella  loco citato    When the brood are a month old or a little more the crest begins to shoot and then they are subject to sickness as the young turkies in similar circumstances At this time the parent cock adopts them as his offspring for before the growth of the crest he drives them away as supposititious  Palladius  De Re Rustica  lib i  They ought not however to be trusted with the old ones before the age of seven months and they must be accustomed to perch on the roost that they may not suffer from lying on the ground on account of the cold damps  Columella    The crest consists of small feathers of which the shaft is not furnished with webs but beset with little slender detached threads the top is formed by a bunch of ordinary feathers united together and painted with the richest colours  The number of these small feathers is variable I have counted twentyfive in a male and thirty in a female but I have not examined enough to decide accurately  The crest is not an inverted cone as might be supposed its base which is uppermost forms a very extensive ellipse whose greater axis is in the direction of the head all the feathers that compose it have a particular and perceptible  motion by which they approach each other or recede at will and also a general motion by which the whole crest is sometimes erected sometimes reclined  The waving summits of this crest as well as all the rest of the plumage are decorated with much more splendid colours in the male than in the female Besides this circumstance the cock is discriminated from the hen when three months old by a little yellow which appears on the tip of the wing he is afterwards distinguished by his size by the spur on each leg by the length of his tail and the power of expanding it like a fan Willughby fancies that the Peacock shares that remarkable property with the turkey alone but in the course of this history we have seen that it belongs also to some grous to some pigeons c  The tailfeathers or rather those long coverts that are inserted in the back near the rump are on a great scale what those of the crest are on a small one The shaft is equally furnished from its origin to its extremity with parted filaments of a varying colour and it ends in a flat vane decorated with what is called the  eye  or the  mirror  This is a brilliant spot enamelled with the most enchanting colours yellow gilded with many shades green running into blue and bright violet according to the different positions and the whole receives additional lustre from the colour of the centre which is a fine velvet black  The two feathers in the middle are each four feet and a half long and extend beyond the rest the others gradually diminishing as they approach the sides The crest is permanent but the tail is cast every year either entirely or in part about the end of July and shoots again in the spring during which interval the bird is dispirited and seeks retirement  The predominant colour of the head throat neck and breast is blue with different reflections of violet yellow and lucid green and by means of these waving shades nature can spread a greater variety of colouring on the same space  On each side of the head there is a protuberance formed by small feathers which cover the perforation of the external ear  Peacocks seem to toy with each other by the bill but on examining them closely I find that they scratch the head which is subject to a very nimble sort of lice These may be seen running over the white skin that encircles the eyes which must occasion an uneasy feeling Accordingly the birds remain very tame and seem pleased when another scratches them  These birds assume the rule in the yard and will not suffer the other poultry to feed till they have satisfied their hunger They eat nearly the same way with the gallinaceous tribe laying hold of the grain by the point of the bill and swallowing it whole  When they drink they plunge their bill into the water and make five or six quick motions with the lower jaw then raising their head and holding it horizontal they swallow the water with which their mouth is filled and without moving the bill  Their food is received into the  oesophagus  where a little above the anterior orifice of the stomach is placed a glandulous swelling filled with small tubes which pour out much limpid liquor  The stomach is clothed on the outside with a great number of muscular fibres  In one of these birds which was dissected by Gaspar Bartholin there were two biliary ducts but he found only one pancreatic duct though there are generally two in the feathered tribes  The  coecum  was double and pointing from behind forwards its length was equal to that of all the other intestines together and was more capacious  Acta Hafniensia    The rump is very thick because in it are inserted all the muscles destined to elevate and expand the tail  The excrements are commonly figured and mixed with a little of that white matter which is common to the gallinaceous tribes and many other birds  I am informed that they sleep sometimes hiding their head under their wing sometimes covering their neck and leaving the bill exposed  Peacocks love cleanliness and for this reason they are at pains to hide their excrements not because they are loth that men should derive any benefit from the dung  Fimum suum resorbere traduntur invidentes hominum utilitatibus  PLIN lib xxix  Hence the Peacock is said to be envious  which it is said is good for sore eyes for manure c but doubtless they are not well acquainted with all these properties  Though they cannot fly much they are fond of climbing They generally pass the night on the roofs of houses where they do a great deal of mischief and on the loftiest trees From these elevated stations they often scream and their cry is universally allowed to be disagreeable perhaps because it disturbs our sleep and from which it is pretended that their name is formed in all languages  Volucres pleraeque a suis vocibus appellatae ut hae Upupa cuculus ulula pavo  VARRO de Linguâ Latinâ    It is said that the female has only one note which she seldom utters except in the spring while the male has three For my own part I can only distinguish two tones the one flat like that of the hautboy the other sharp exactly the octave of the former which resembles more the shrill notes of the trumpet and I confess that my ear is not hurt by these sounds any more than my eye by the shape of their legs and we apply to the Peacocks our false reasonings  and even our vices when we suppose that their cry is only a groan extorted by their vanity as often as they view the clumsiness of their feet  Theophrastus maintains that their cries if often reiterated forebode rain others that they foretell it when they scramble higher than ordinary  De Naturâ Rerum  Others allege that these cries forebode the death of a neighbour and lastly others relate that these birds always wear under the wing a bit of the root of flax as an amulet to preserve them from witchcraft  Aelian Hist Anim lib xi  Whatever is much spoken of is made a subject of silly fables  Besides the different cries which I have mentioned the male and female emit a certain dull sound or smothered cracking which seems to be formed internally and which they often repeat whether they are disturbed or in a state of tranquillity and ease  Pliny says that a sympathy has been observed between the pigeons and the Peacocks  Plin Hist Nat lib x  and Clearchus tells us of one of the latter which grew so much attached to a young woman that having witnessed her death it could not survive the shock  Athenaeus lib xiii  But a more natural and better founded friendship is observed between the turkey and Peacock These two birds are of the number that raise and display their tail a circumstance which implies many common properties  Accordingly they agree better than with the other fowls It is even said that a Peacock has been seen to copulate with a turkeyhen  Belon  which would shew a great analogy between the two species  The term of the life of the Peacock is twentyfive years according to the ancients  Aristotle Hist Anim vi    Pliny x  and this determination seems to be wellfounded since the bird is full grown before the end of three years and the feathered race attain to a greater age than quadrupeds because their bones are more pliant But I am surprised that Willughby imagines on the authority of Aelian that the Peacock lived a complete century especially as the account of that relator is mingled with many circumstances evidently fabulous  Aelian de Nat Anim xi    I have already said that the Peacock feeds on all sorts of grain like the gallinaceous tribe The ancients generally gave it a monthly allowance of a bushel of wheat weighing about twenty pounds It is proper to notice that the flower of the elder is hurtful to them  Linnaeus  and that the leaf of the nettle is according to Franzius a mortal poison to the young Peacocks  As in India the Peacocks live in the state of nature it is usual in that country to hunt them They can hardly be approached in the daytime though they are scattered over the  fields in numerous flocks because as soon as they descry a sportsman they fly away more speedily than partridges and conceal themselves in the thickets where they cannot be pursued The night therefore is the only proper time for the chase which in the vicinity of Cambaya is conducted in the following manner  The sportsmen get close to the tree where the Peacocks are perched and present a kind of banner which supports two burning candles and is painted with the figures of Peacocks The Peacock dazzled by the glare or engaged in admiring the painting stretches out its neck repeatedly and again draws it back and when its head is observed to be entangled in a running knot placed for the purpose the hunters immediately draw the cord and secure the bird  Tavernier    We have seen that the Greeks much admired the Peacock but this was only for the beauty of the plumage The Romans who carried every luxury to excess actually feasted on Peacocks flesh The orator Hortensius was the first who ordered it to be served up at his table  Varro  De Re Rustica  lib iii  and his example being followed this bird came to be sold at a very high price at Rome The Emperors refined on the luxury of their subjects and Vitellius and Heliogabalus gloried in filling enormous chargers  Among others that called by Vitellius the Aegis of Minerva  with the brains of  Peacocks the tongues of the  phoenicopterus  and the livers of the  scarus  Suetonius  forming insipid dishes whose whole merit consisted in their destructive expenceIn those times a flock of an hundred Peacocks could bring a revenue of sesterces three Peacocks being only required of the keeper for each hatch  Varro  De Re Rusticâ  lib iii  This sum according to the estimation of Gassendi amounts to or livres Among the Greeks the cock and hen together cost a thousand  drachmae  which corresponds to eightyseven livres ten sous on the highest valuation twentyfour livres on the lowest But the last was undoubtedly reckoned much under value else the exclamation in Athenaeus would have no meaning  Is it not madness to rear Peacocks when they are as dear as statues  Anaxandrides apud Athenaeum lib xiv    The price must have greatly fallen towards the beginning of the sixteenth century since in the "Nouvelle Coutume de Bourbonnois" published in the Peacock is valued at two sous six deniers money of that time which Dupré de Saint Maur values at three livres fifteen sous of the present currency But it would seem that soon after this period the price was advanced for Bruyere tells us that in the neighbourhood of Lisieux where they could easily rear Peacocks with the cyder lees they bred flocks which were very profitable since being rare in other  parts of the kingdom they were usually sent from thence to all the considerable cities to be served up in splendid entertainments However scarce any but young ones are sit to be eaten for their flesh is naturally dry and grows hard as they become old To this quality we must impute the singular property which appears well ascertained that their flesh can be kept several years without putrifying  St Augustine  de Civitate Dei  lib xxi  Yet old ones have been used though more for show than use for they were served up decorated with their richest plumes  Aldrovandus  This is a well imagined refinement in luxury and which the industrious elegance of the moderns has added to the extravagant magnificence of the ancients It was over a Peacock dressed in this way that our old knights made on grand occasions the vow called the  Vow of the Peacock  Mem de l'Acad des Inscript tome xx    Peacock's feathers were formerly used to make a sort of fans  Frisch  and they were formed into crowns like those of laurel for the  Troubadour  poets Gesner  Traite de Tournois  par le pere Menestrier  saw a web whose woof was silk and gold thread and the warp Peacocks feathers Such no doubt was the robe woven with these feathers which Pope Paul III sent to king Pepin  Genealogie de Montmorency    According to Aldrovandus Peacocks' eggs are reckoned by the moderns as improper food whereas the ancients put them in the first class and even before those of the goose and common hen  Athenaeus  This contradiction he explains by saying that they are pleasant to the taste but pernicious to the health It remains to be inquired whether the temperature of the climate affects their quality  Specific character of the Peacock  Pavo Cristatus    Has a compressed crest on its head with single spurs  The WHITE PEACOCK  Climate has no less influence on the plumage of birds than on the fur of animals We have elsewhere seen that the hare the ermine and most other animals are subject to grow white in cold countries particularly in the winter season Here is a species or a variety of Peacocks which seems to have received similar impressions from the same cause and the effects are even greater since the race is permanent for the whiteness of hares and ermines is merely temporary and happens only in the winter like that of the ptarmigan The colour of the White  Peacock on the other hand is no longer affected by the season or climate and the eggs hatched even in Italy produced a white brood The one which Aldrovandus has caused to be engraved was reared at Bologna and this circumstance has made him suspect that this variety did not belong peculiarly to cold countries Yet most naturalists agree in assigning Norway and other northern countries for its native region  Frisch and Willughby  It would seem that it is there wild for in the winter it travels into Germany where it is commonly caught in that season  Frisch  They are indeed found in countries much farther south as in France and Italy but there they are in the domestic state  Aldrovandus He adds also the Madeira islands citing  Cadamosto de Navigatione    Linnaeus affirms in general as I have before said that Peacocks are averse to reside in Sweden and he excepts not even the white sort  It required a long period of time and a singular concurrence of circumstances to reconcile a bird bred in the delicious climates of Asia and India to the rigours of the northern tracts If it had not been carried thither it could not have migrated to these inhospitable countries either by the north of Asia or by the north of Europe  Though the date of this event be not exactly known I presume that it is not very distant  for on the one hand I learn from Aldrovandus Longolius Scaliger and Schwenckfeld that it is not long since White Peacocks were esteemed as rarities and on the other hand I have grounds to believe that the Greeks were unacquainted with them because Aristotle having spoken in his  Treatise on the Generation of Animals  of the variegated colours of the Peacock and afterwards of white partridges white ravens and white sparrows takes no notice of White Peacocks  The moderns add nothing to the history of this sort of Peacocks except that the young are very delicate and difficult to rear  Schwenckfeld  It is however likely that the influence of climate is not confined to the change of plumage alone but must have operated in some degree on their temperament instincts and habits I am surprised that no naturalist has observed the progress of the alterations or at least noticed the intimate and latent effects produced A single discovery of this kind would undoubtedly be more interesting and tend more to the improvement and extension of natural knowledge than the minute enumeration of all the feathers of these birds and the laborious description of all their shades and tints in the four quarters of the world  Lastly though their plumage be entirely white and particularly the long feathers of the  tail we can still perceive at their extremities distinct traces of those spangles which formed their finest ornament so deep was the impression of their primaeval colours  Frisch  It would be a curious subject to try to revive these colours and to determine by experiment what length of time and how many generations would be required in a suitable climate such as that of India to restore them to their original lustre  The VARIEGATED PEACOCK  Frisch supposes that this is produced by the union of the common Peacock with the white kind It bears indeed on its plumage the impression of this origin for white is spread on its belly its wings and its cheeks In the rest of the body it is like the common Peacock except in the spangles of the tail which are neither so broad so round nor so well defined All that I can find in authors with respect to the particular history of this bird is that the young ones are not so delicate in rearing as those of the White Peacock  The COMMON PHEASANT  In Greek  in Latin also  Phasianus  in Turkish  Surglun  in

China  Voyages de Gerbillon  In the Corea we see abundance of pheasants hens larks c  HAMEL  Relation de la Corée  and Japan  Koempfer says that at Japan there are Pheasants of great beauty  and even into Tartary I say through Media for it appears that that country which is congenial to the nature of birds and which is stocked with the most excellent poultry the most beautiful peacocks c has also proved a nursery of Pheasants and has supplied many other regions  Athenaeus relates that these birds were sent for from Media as being more numerous and of a better kind  ALDROVANDUS  They are

met with The Authors of the British Zoology assure us that in the whole extent of Great Britain there is not a single Wild Pheasant Sibbald agrees with these naturalists since he tells us that in Scotland some gentlemen breed these birds in their houses  Prodromus Historiae Naturalis Scotiae  Boter affirms still more directly that there are no Pheasants in Ireland  Willughby  Linnaeus takes no notice of them in the enumeration he has given of the Swedish birds In the time of Schwenckfeld they were very rare in Silesia and it is only twenty years since they were introduced into Prussia  Klein  though they are very frequent in Bohemia  Id  If they have multiplied in Saxony it is owing to the attention of the Duke Frederic  Aldrovandus  who let loose two hundred in that country and prohibited their being caught or killed Gesner who travelled through the mountains of Switzerland affirms that he never saw any It is true indeed that Stumpfius asserts the contrary but it is probable that they may be found in some districts which Gesner had not examined as in that part which borders on the Milanese territories where Olina says they are very common  Pheasants are far from being plentiful in France In the northern provinces they are seldom seen and would perhaps soon die away but for the attention bestowed on the preservation of the royal game Even in Brie where some are continually making their escape from their keepers and where their nests with eggs have been found in the extensive forests of that province so unfavourable is the climate that the number of the wild Pheasants is never observed to increase We knew an opulent person in Burgundy who was at the utmost pains and spared no expence in stocking his estate which lay in Auxois but without success I should therefore suspect that Regnard must have been mistaken when he tells us that he killed two Pheasants in Bothnia  Regnard  Voyage de Lapponie  and Olaus Magnus who says that they are found in Scandinavia where they lie under the snow through the winter without any sustenance  Quoted by Aldrovandus  This habit seems to belong rather to the grous than to the Pheasants and the name  Gallae sylvestres  which Olaus applies suits better that genus of birds My conjecture has the more foundation since neither Linnaeus nor any other accurate observer mentions seeing real Pheasants in the northern countries In short we may suppose that the name Pheasant has first been given by  the natives to the grous which are very numerous in the boreal tracts and afterwards adopted blindly by travellers and even by compilers who are equally inattentive in discriminating species  Since the wings of the Pheasant are short consequently its flight low and laborious we may readily conclude that it could not traverse the immense ocean that divides America from the temperate countries in the Ancient Continent Accordingly none have been found in the New World but only some birds akin to them I speak not of the true Pheasants which are at present common in the plantations of St Domingo for these as well as the peacocks and pintados were introduced by the Europeans  Histoire de l'Isle Espagnole de St Domingue    The Pheasant is of the size of the common cock  Aldrovandus who has carefully observed and described this bird says that he examined one which weighed three pounds of twelve ounces  libras tres duodecim unciarum  which some have ignorantly translated three pounds twelve ounces  and in some respects rivals the peacock in beauty His figure is as dignified his deportment as bold and his plumage almost as resplendent The colours of the Chinese Pheasant are even brighter but he has not like the peacock the power of displaying his rich plumage and of elevating the long feathers of his tail Besides the Pheasant has neither the crest of the peacock nor the double tail of  which the shorter one consists of quills capable of being erected and the longer one formed of the coverts of these in general the Pheasant seems to have been modelled after less slender and less elegant proportions the body thicker the neck shorter the head larger c  The most remarkable traits in its appearance are the two spots of scarlet in the middle of which the eyes are placed and the two tufts of feathers of a goldgreen which in the love season rise on each side under the ears for in animals there is almost always as I have already remarked a new production more or less remarkable which is a sign that the generative faculty is again roused to action These tufts of feathers are probably what Pliny calls sometimes ears  Geminas ex plumâ aures submittunt subriguntque  Lib x  sometimes little horns  Phasianae corniculis  Lib xi  A prominence is observed at their base formed by an  erector  muscle  Aldrovandus  Besides these the Pheasant is furnished with feathers at each ear to close at pleasure the orifice which is very large  Ibid    The feathers of the tail and rump have their ends heartshaped like some of the tailfeathers of the peacock  Brisson    I shall not here enter into a particular description of the colours of the plumage I shall only  observe that in the female they are much less brilliant than in the male in whom the reflexions are still more fugitive than in the peacock and depend not only on the various incidence of the light but on the junction and position of the feathers for if any one be taken singly the green wavings vanish and we see only a brown or black  Aldrovandus  The shafts of the feathers of the neck and the back are of a fine bright yellow and appear like so many plates of gold  Ibid  The coverts under the tail continue diminishing and terminate in a kind of filaments The tail consists of eighteen quills though Schwenckfeld reckons only sixteen the two middle ones are the longest of all and they shorten regularly towards the sides Each leg is furnished with a short pointed spur which has escaped some designers and even the engraver of our  Planches Enluminées  No the toes are connected by a membrane broader than usual in pulverulent birds  Ibid  and seems to form the first shade between these and the aquatic tribes and in fact Aldrovandus observes that the Pheasants delight in wet places and he adds that they are sometimes caught in the marshes in the neighbourhood of Bologna Olina another Italian and Le Roi Lieutenant of Rangers at Versailles have made the same remark The lastmentioned person informs me that it is always in  the most watery spots and along the sides of the pools in the large forests of Brie that Pheasants lodge which have escaped from the hunters in the vicinity Though habituated to the society of man though loaded with his favours these Pheasants retire as far as possible from all human dwellings for these birds are very wild and extremely difficult to tame It is said however that they can be instructed to return at the sound of a whistle  Journal Economique mois de September    It is very probable that this was all the attainment of the tame Pheasants which according to Aelian were bred in the  menagerie  of the King of India lib xviii  that is they can be attracted by this means to their food but as soon as their appetite is satisfied they return to their natural mode of life and forget the hand that fed them They are stubborn slaves that will not submit to constraint who know nothing desirable that can enter into competition with liberty who seek continually to recover it and never lose sight of it when opportunity occurs  Though reared in the house and hatched under a hen they never grow domestic but still retain their rusticity  OLINA  Which confirms what I have myself observed  The wild ones newly bereaved of freedom become furious they dart with violence on the companions of their captivity and strike with their bills nor do they spare even the peacocks  Longolius  apud Aldrovandum    These birds are fond of living in woods that grow on the plains differing in this respect from the grous which inhabit forests that clothe the mountains They perch on the tops of trees during the night  Frisch  sleeping with their head under the wing their cry that is the cry of the male for the female has none at all is intermediate between that of the peacock and the pintado but more like that of the latter and therefore far from being agreeable  Their disposition is so unsocial that they not only fly from the presence of man but avoid the company of each other except in the months of March and April when the male courts the female It is then easy to discover them in the woods because they are betrayed by the loud noise made by the clapping of their wings which may be heard at a great distance  Olina  The Cock Pheasants are not so ardent as the common cocks Frisch asserts that in the wild state each attaches itself to a single female but man who glories in perverting the order of nature to his interest or his whims has changed the instinct of these birds by habituating each cock to serve seven hens and constraining these to rest satisfied with the performance of a single male  Some have had patience to make all the observations necessary to determine this proportion  to be the most profitable for breeding  Journal Economique Sept  Also see the article  Faisanderie  in the Encyclopedie  Several oeconomists however allow only two females to each male  FrischMaison Rustique  and I must confess that this distinction succeeded the best in some trials I have made But the different combinations must depend on particular circumstances on the temperature of the climate the nature of the soil the quality and quantity of the food the extent and position of the place for rearing them and the attention of the keeper who ought to remove the hen as soon as she has imbibed the quickening influence and present the females one after another at proper intervals He should also give the cock during that season buckwheat and other stimulating aliments as is usual about the end of winter when we want to anticipate the period of love  The Hen Pheasant constructs her nest alone she selects the darkest corner of her lodging and forms it with straw leaves and other materials though it appears very rude and unshapely she prefers it to any other not built by herself insomuch that if one be prepared for her of a regular construction she tears it in pieces and arranges the materials a new in her own way She breeds but once a year at least in our climates she lays twenty eggs  Palladius  De Re Rustica  according to some and forty or fifty according to others especially if we save  her the trouble of sitting  Journal Economique Sept  Those however which I had occasion to see never laid more than twelve eggs and sometimes less though these were hatched by common hens They generally lay one every two or three days and the eggs are much smaller than those of an ordinary hen and the shell thinner even than those of pigeons The colour is a greenishgrey speckled with little brown spots as Aristotle has well observed  Hist Anim lib vi  Imitated by  Pliny lib x  ranged in a circular zone round the egg A Hen Pheasant can hatch eighteen  If we would undertake to raise Pheasants on a great scale we must for that purpose allot a park of proportional extent which should be partly laid out in grass and partly planted with bushes where these birds may be shaded from the sun sheltered from rain and even protected from the assaults of the ravenous tribes One part of this park ought to be divided into several small patches of ten or twelve yards square constructed so that each may lodge a cock with his females and they must be confined either by disabling their wings or by spreading a net over the little inclosure Care should be taken not to shut up several cocks together for they will undoubtedly fight and perhaps kill each other  Journal Economique Sept  We must even contrive that they shall not see  or hear each other for though naturally cold and phlegmatic their disquietude or jealousy will interrupt or relax their amours Thus in some animals as well as in man jealousy is not always proportioned to the appetite of love  Palladius alleges that the cocks need only be a year old  Journal Economique Sept  and all naturalists agree that hens are proper for breeding the third year Sometimes when Pheasants are numerous it is sufficient to lodge the females in the inclosures and leave them to the embraces of the wild cocks  These birds feed on all sorts of grain and herbs It is even recommended to throw part of the park into a kitchen garden in which to raise beans carrots potatoes onions lettuces parsnips and especially the two last of which they are remarkably fond It is also said that they love acorns the berries of the white thorn and seed of wormwood  Gerbillon  Voyage de la Chine de la Tartarie  but the food best adapted to them is wheat mixed with ants eggs Some advise not to mix ants themselves lest they take a dislike to the eggs but Edmond King recommends the ants themselves and affirms that these insects afford them the most salutary nourishment and can even restore them when they are sickly and drooping and that instead of these we may substitute even grashoppers earwigs and millepedes The English author whom I have just quoted assures us that he lost many Pheasants  before he learnt this fact but that after he attended to that circumstance not one died of those which he was breeding  Philosophical Transactions No  But whatever sort of food we give them it must be offered sparingly not to make them too fat for corpulence blunts the ardor of the cock weakens the prolific powers of the hen and makes her lay eggs with soft shells and easily broken  The time of incubation is from twenty to twentyfive days according to most authors and my own observation  Gesner Schwenckfeld  Journal Economique  le Roi  Palladius fixes it at thirty but this is a mistake which ought not to have been adopted in the  Maison Rustique  for in the warm climate of Italy the Pheasants could not require so long time to hatch and therefore instead of  trigesimus  we ought to read  vigesimus  We ought to keep the sittinghen in a place remote from noise and somewhat under ground so as not to be affected by the variations of the weather or exposed to the stroke of thunder  As soon as the young Pheasants leave the shell they begin to run like all the gallinaceous tribe For the first twentyfour hours food is generally withheld from them after that they are put with the mother into a crib and carried out every day to the fields into the pasture grounds where anthills abounds This ought  to be covered with deals which may be removed or replaced as occasion requires It ought also to have a division near one of the ends where the mother should be confined with bars so wide asunder however as to allow the chickens to go out and return as often as they chuse The clucking of the imprisoned mother and the necessity of being frequently warmed will constantly bring them back and prevent them from sauntering too far It is usual to join together three or four hatches of nearly the same age so as to form a single family which may be reared by the same mother  They are fed at first like all young chicks with a mixture of hard eggs crumbs of bread and lettuce leaves mixed together and with an addition of the eggs of meadow ants But at this tender age two precautions must be carefully observed They must not be allowed to drink at all nor be carried abroad till the dew is entirely gone for humidity of every kind is hurtful to them We may notice by the way that this is one of the reasons why hatches of wild Pheasants seldom succeed in France for as I have already remarked these birds prefer the fresh verdant places and in such situations the young can hardly survive the damps The second point to be attended to is that their food should be given frequently and in small quantities beginning as soon as day break and always mixing with it ants eggs  In the second month more substantial nourishment may be given eggs of the wood ants turkey beans wheat barley millet ground beans and the intervals between the meals may be gradually enlarged  At this time they begin to be subject to vermin To prevent that disorder most modern writers advise us to clean the crib or even to lay it aside altogether except the small roof which serves to shelter them Olina recommends a plan proposed by Aristotle which seems to me better contrived and more suitable to the nature of these birds They are in the number of those that welter in the dust and when that gratification is withheld they languish and die  ARIST Hist Anim lib v  Olina directs small heaps of dry earth or very fine sand to be laid near them in which they may tumble and rid themselves of the painful itching occasioned by the insects  We must also be very attentive in giving them clean water and in often renewing it else they will be in danger of contracting the pip of which there is scarcely any remedy according to the moderns though Palladius advises to remove it as in common chickens and to rub the bill with garlick bruised with tar  The third month is attended with new diseases The tail feathers then drop and others appear which is a sort of crisis to them as well as to  the Peacocks But ants eggs are still a resource they hasten the trying moment and lessen the danger provided we do not give them too much for the excess is pernicious In proportion as the young Pheasants grow up their regimen becomes the more like that of the adults and at the end of the third month they may be let loose in the place intended to be stocked But such is the effect of domestication on animals that have lived some time in that state that even those which like the Pheasants have an invincible attachment to liberty cannot be restored to it but by imperceptible degrees in the same manner as a good stomach that has been weakened with watery elements cannot at once recover its tone so as to digest rich food We must first carry the crib which contains the brood to the field where the colony is to be dispersed we must give them what food they like best but never in the same spot and we must diminish the quantity every day and thus by degrees constrain them to provide for themselves and to become acquainted with the country When they are able to procure subsistence they should be resigned to liberty and nature They will soon grow as wild as those bred in the woods except only that they will still retain a sort of affection for those spots where they were fostered in their infancy  Man encouraged by his success in changing the instinct of the Cock Pheasant and in reconciling  it to the society of a number of females has tried also to effect another violence to make it breed with a foreign species and the experiments have in some degree succeeded though they required great care and attention  The Wild Pheasants never tread the hens which they meet not but they sometimes make advances only the hens will never permit them to proceed I owe this among many other observations to M Le Roi Lieutenant des Chasses at Versailles  A young Cock Pheasant which had never copulated was shut in a close place where but a faint light glimmered through the roof some young pullets were selected whose plumage resembled the most that of the Pheasant and were put in a crib adjoining that of the Cock Pheasant and separated from it only by a grate of which the ribs were so close as to admit no more than the head and neck of these birds The Cock Pheasant was thus accustomed to see these females and even to live with them because the food was thrown into the crib only When they had grown familiar and the season of love approached both the cock and hens were fed on heating aliments to provoke their desires and after they discovered an inclination to couple the grate which parts them was removed It sometimes happened that the Cock Pheasant faithful to nature and indignant at the insult offered him abused the hens and even killed the first he met with but if his rage did not subside he was on the one hand mollified by touching his bill  with a redhot iron and on the other stimulated by the application of proper fomentations At last his appetites however growing every day more fiery and nature constantly counteracting herself he at last copulated with the hens which in consequence laid eggs dotted with black like those of the Pheasant but much larger and they produced hybrids partaking the properties of both species and according to some more delicate and even better flavoured than the true sort but incapable it is said of propagating their kind yet Longolius asserts that the females of this kind which couple with their sire produce real Pheasants Care has also been taken to give the Cock Pheasant only virgin hens whether the more to incite the males for man judges of all creatures from himself or because the repetition of the experiment on the same subjects is said to occasion the breed to degenerate  It is pretended that the Pheasant is a stupid bird and imagines itself safe when its head is concealed which has been alleged of many other birds that heedlessly fall into all sorts of snares When hunted by a pointer and met it stands still and looks steadily at the dog so that the sportsman can take his aim at leisure To decoy it we need only present its own figure or a red rag on a white sheet It is caught also by setting gins in the tracks which it treads in the morning to drink It is also chased by the  falcon and such as are taken this way are said to be more delicate and delicious than ordinary  Aldrovandus  Autumn is the season when they are fattest The young ones may be fattened like other poultry only in introducing the little ball into the throat care should be taken to prevent the tongue from being pushed backwards which would infallibly kill the bird  A fat young Pheasant is a most exquisite morsel and at the same time very wholesome food Accordingly this luxury has been always reserved for the tables of the rich and the whim of Heliogabalus of feeding his lions on Pheasants has been regarded as the most wanton profusion  According to Olina and Le Roi this bird like the common hens lives about six or seven years but the opinion that the age may be discovered from the number of the cross bars on its tail is void of foundation  Specific character of the Pheasant  Phasianus Colchicus    It is rufous its head blue its tail wedgeshaped its cheeks marked with  papillae  The WHITE PHEASANT  Phasianus Colchicus Albus  Linn  We are not sufficiently acquainted with the history of this variety to determine the cause  to which we ought to refer the whiteness of its plumage analogy would lead us to suppose it to be the effect of cold as in the case of the White Peacock It is true that the Pheasant has not been introduced so far into the northern regions as the Peacock but the white is also not so pure since according to Brisson it has spots of deep violet on its neck and other rusty spots on the back and according to Olina the males have sometimes the full colours of ordinary Pheasants on the head and neck This last author asserts that the White Pheasants come from Flanders but in Flanders they undoubtedly say that they come still farther north He subjoins that the females are of a purer white than the males and I have myself observed that property to obtain in the Pheasants  The VARIEGATED PHEASANT  Phasianus Colchicus Varius  Linn  As the White Peacock when coupled with the common sort produces the variegated kind we may suppose that the White and the common Pheasant would breed the variety here mentioned especially as it has the shape and even the size of the ordinary sort and its plumage the ground of which is white is sprinkled with spots that have all the usual colours  Frisch observes that the variegated Pheasant is not proper for propagation  The COCQUAR OR BASTARD PHEASANT  Phasianus Colchicus Hybridus  Linn  The Hybridal Pheasant  Lath  The Pied Pheasant  Hayes  The name which Frisch gives to this variety shews that he considered it as bred between the Cock Pheasant and the common hen It resembles indeed the Pheasant by the red circle round its eyes and its long tail and it approaches the common cock by the dull and homely feathers of its plumage It is also smaller than the ordinary Pheasant and like the other Hybrids it is incapable of producing its species  Frisch tells us that many of these are raised in Germany being profitable and that they are excellent food  N  o  THE PIED PHEASANT  FOREIGN BIRDS ANALOGOUS TO THE PHEASANT  I SHALL not range under this denomination several birds on which most travellers or naturalists have bestowed the name of Pheasant but which after a close investigation we have determined to belong to very different tribesSuch as The Pheasant of the Antilles of Brisson which is that of the island Kayriouacou of Father Tertre and which has longer legs and a shorter tail than the Pheasant Brisson's crowned Pheasant of the Indies which differs from the Pheasant by its general form and by the shape of its bill its instincts and habits its long wings and short tail and which if we except its size seems to resemble much the pigeons The American bird which we have directed to be figured under the name of  The Crested Pheasant of Cayenne  because it was sent to us under that name but which appears to be distinguished from the Pheasant by its bulk its carriage its long slender neck its small head its long wings c The  Hocco Pheasant  of Guiana which is by no means a Pheasant as the comparison of the figures alone suffices to shew All the other  Hoccos  of America  which Brisson and Barrere and others who have been misled by their systems have referred to the genus of the Pheasant though they differ in many respects and even in some properties that have been received as generic characters  I The PAINTED PHEASANT  Faisan Doré  ou  Le Tricolor Huppé de la Chine  Buff  Phasianus Pictus  Linn and Gmel  Phasianus Sanguineus  Klein  Phasianus Aureus Sinensis  Briss  Gold Fasian  Gunth  Some authors who have applied to this bird the name of  Red Pheasant  would have had equal reason to have called it the  Blue Pheasant  and the term  Golden Pheasant  is equally inadequate to denote the plumage which is enriched by the lustre of all these three colours  It may be considered as a variety of the ordinary species whose garb sparkles with the decorations of a happier clime They are two branches of the same family which though long separated recal their common descent and can still intermingle and breed with each other But it must be confessed that their progeny partakes somewhat of the sterility of Hybrids which  proves the antiquity of the partition of the paternal house  The Painted Pheasant is smaller than the ordinary Pheasant The remarkable beauty of this bird has occasioned its being so much bred in our pheasant walks The predominant colours of its plumage are red gold yellow and blue it has long beautiful feathers on the head which can be erected at pleasure its iris bill legs and nails are yellow the tail is proportionally longer than that of the common Pheasant more mottled and in general of a brighter plumage above the feathers of the tail others are spread long and narrow and of a scarlet colour with a yellow shaft the eyes are not encircled with red skin like the European Pheasant in a word it appears to have been deeply marked by the impression of the climate  The female of the Painted Pheasant is somewhat smaller than the male and its tail is not so long the colours of its plumage are very ordinary and even inferior to those of the common kind but sometimes they acquire in time the beauty of the male In England one belonging to Lady Essex changed in the space of six years its mean dusky colour into the rich lustre of the male so as not to be distinguished except by the appearance of the eyes and the length of the tail Intelligent persons who have had opportunities of observing these birds inform  me that this change of colour takes place in most females and begins at four years old when males take a dislike to them and treat them harshly That then those long narrow feathers which in the male lie over the tail begin to appear And in a word as they grow older they become the more like the males which in a certain degree happens in all animals  Edwards tells us that he saw at the Duke of Leeds's a common Hen Pheasant whose plumage had in the same manner become like that of the male He adds that such changes of colours seldom take place except among birds that live in the domestic state  The eggs of the Painted Pheasant are very like those of the Pintado they are proportionally smaller than those of the domestic Hen and more reddish than those of the common Pheasant  Sir Hans Sloane kept a male about fifteen years it would therefore seem that this bird is hardy since it lived so long out of its native abode It is soon reconciled to our climate and multiplies fast it breeds even with the European Pheasant Le Roi Lieutenant of the Rangers at Versailles put one of them to a Cock Pheasant of this country and obtained two Cock Pheasants very like the common kind but the plumage had a dirty cast and only a few yellow feathers on the head like those of the Painted  Pheasant and these two young males being paired with European henpheasants one succeeded the second year and a henpheasant was hatched which could never be made to breed The two Cocks produced no more and the fourth year made their elopement  It is probable that the Painted Pheasant is that elegant pheasant whose plumes sell higher in China than the pheasant itself and also the same with what  Marco Polo  admired in one of his travels to China whose tail was two or three feet long  Specific character of the Painted Pheasant  Phasianus Pictus    Its crest is yellow its breast saffron its secondary wingquills blue its tail wedgeshaped  II The BLACKANDWHITE CHINA PHEASANT  Phasianus Nycthemerus  Linn and Gmel  Phasianus Albus Sinensis  Briss and Klein  Silber Fasian  Gunth  The Pencilled Pheasant  Lath  The figure in the  Planches Enluminées  was taken from a stuffed specimen and I doubt not but that of Edwards which was drawn from the life and retouched at leisure the minute  parts being added from the dead subject represents this Pheasant more exactly and gives a better idea of its air and port c  It is easy to see from the bare inspection of the figure that it is a variety of the Pheasant having the general proportions of the Painted Chinese Pheasant but larger and exceeding even the European kind It resembles the last in a remarkable property having a red border round the eyes which is even broader and of greater extent for it falls on each side below the under mandible and at the same time rises like a double comb above the upper mandible  The female is rather smaller than the male and differs much in colour It has neither the upperside of the body white nor underside of a fine black with purple reflexions In no part of its plumage is there any white except a single speck below its eyes the rest is of a brown red more or less deep except under the belly and on the lateral feathers of the tail where there are black transverse bars on a gray ground In every other respect there is less difference between the sexes in this than in any other Pheasant the female has like the male a tuft on its head its eyes are encircled with a red border and its legs are of the same colour  Since no naturalist or traveller has given the least hint concerning the original abode of  the Blackandwhite Pheasant we are obliged to form conjectures I am inclined to suppose that as the Pheasant of Georgia having migrated towards the east and having fixed its residence in the southern or temperate provinces of China has become the Painted Pheasant so the White Pheasant which is an inhabitant of our cold climates or that of Tartary having travelled into the northern provinces of China has become the pencilled kind that it has there grown to a greater size than the original Pheasant or that of Georgia because it has found in these provinces food more plentiful and better suited to its nature but that it betrays the marks of a new climate in its air port and external form in all which it resembles the Painted Pheasant but retains of the original Pheasant the red orbits which have been even expanded from the same causes undoubtedly that promoted the growth of its body and gave it a superiority over the ordinary Pheasant  Specific character of the Pencilled Pheasant  Phasianus Nycthemerus    It is white its crest and belly black its tail wedgeshaped  III The ARGUS OR LUEN  Phasianus Argus  Linn and Gmel  The Argus Pheasant  Lath  In the north of China another sort of Pheasant has been found the wings and tail of which are sprinkled with a multitude of round spots like eyes whence it has received the name of  Argus  The two feathers in the middle of the tail are very long and project much beyond the rest it is of the size of a turkey its head is covered with a double crest which lies backwards  In the  Philosophical Transactions vol LV p  for is a very full description of this bird accompanied with a good engraving framed by Mr Edwards from a drawing sent from China    IV The NAPAUL OR HORNED PHEASANT  Meleagris Satyra  Linn  Penelope Satyra  Gmel  Phasianus Cornutus  Briss  The Horned Pheasant  Lath  Edwards to whom we are indebted for our acquaintance with this uncommon bird ranges it among the turkies on account of the fleshy excrescences on the head and yet he has given it the name of Horned Pheasant I should suppose that it is more like the pheasant than the turkey for these protuberances are by no means peculiar to the turkey they belong also to the cock the pintado the royal bird the cassowary and many others in both continents nor are they even withheld from the pheasant since we may regard the broad circle of red skin that surrounds the eyes as nearly of the same nature and in the Pencilled Pheasant of China this really forms the double comb on the bill and the barbils under it If we add that the Napaul is an inhabitant of the congenial climate of pheasants since it was sent to Dr Mead from Bengal that in its bill its feet its spurs its wings and its general form it was like the pheasant we shall be convinced  that it is more natural to class it with the pheasants than with an American bird such as the turkey  The Napaul or Horned Pheasant is so called because of two protuberances which grow from its head like horns are of a blue colour a cylindrical shape blunt at their ends reclined backwards and consist of a substance resembling callous flesh It has not that round circle about its eyes which occurs in the pheasants and is sometimes dotted with black the space which surrounds the eyes is shaded with black hairs like feathers Under thisspace and from the bottom of the lower mandible grows a kind of gorget consisting of loose skin which falls down and floats freely on the throat and the upper part of the neck this gorget is black in the middle and is sprinkled with a few straggling hairs of the same colour It is marked with wrinkles so that it appears to admit of extension in the living animal and there is reason to suppose that it can be inflated or contracted at pleasure The lateral parts are blue with some spots of orange and without any hair on the outer surface but the inside which applies to the neck is shaded with little black feathers as well as that part of the neck which it covers The crown of the head is red the forepart of the body reddish and the hindpart of a dusky colour Over the whole bird including even the tail and the wings we perceive  white spots surrounded with black and dispersed with considerable regularity these spots are round on the forepart and oblong or shaped like tears on the hindpart with the point turned towards the head The wings scarcely reach beyond the origin of the tail from which we may conclude that it is a heavy bird The length of the tail could not be determined by Edwards for in the original drawing it is represented as being partly worn off  Specific character of the Horned Pheasant  Penelope Satyra    It has a pair of horns on its head its body is red with spangling points    V The KATRACA  Phasianus Motmot  Linn and Gmel  Phasianus Guianensis  Briss  The Motmot Pheasant  Lath  Though there are no ture pheasants in America as we have already established yet among the multitude of birds that inhabit that vast continent some possess the properties of that tribe in a greater or less degree The Katraca approaches the nearest and may be considered  as the representative of the pheasant in the New World Its general form its bill which is slightly hooked its eyes which are encircled with red orbits and its tail which is remarkable for its length are all characters which prove it to be of a congenerous kind At the same time as it is a native of a distant climate of even a different world and as it is uncertain whether it would breed with the European pheasants I range it in this place after the Chinese sort which certainly couple with ours Its history is totally unknown to us We retain the name  Katraca  which according to Father Feuilleé is the name it has in Mexico  Specific character of the  Phasianus Motmot    It is brown below tawny its tail wedgeshaped its lateral tailquills rufous  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT SEEM RELATED TO THE PEACOCK AND PHEASANT  ☞ I range under this vague title some foreign birds which have not been described with sufficient accuracy for us to assign their precise place  I The CHINQUIS  Pavo Tibetanus  Linn Gmel and Briss  The Thibet Peacock  Lath  The name  Chinquis  is formed from the Chinese word  chintchienkhi  The bird is the tenth species of the genus of Pheasant in Brisson's system It is found in Thibet whence that author has called it the  Thibet Peacock  It is as large as the pintado the iris is yellow the bill ashcoloured the feet gray the ground of the plumage cinèreous variegated with black lines and white points But its chief and distinguishing ornament is the large round spots of brilliant blue changing into violet and gold spread one by one on the feathers of the back  and the coverts of the wings two and two on the quills of the wings and four and four on the long coverts of the tail of which the two middle ones are the longest the lateral perpetually diminish  We are totally unacquainted with its history we are not even informed whether it expands its fine spangled plumes into a fan  We must not confound the Chinquis with the Kinki or Golden Hen of China which is mentioned in the narrations of Navarette Trigault and du Halde and which as far as we can judge from the imperfect accounts given of it is nothing but the Painted Pheasant  Abbe Prevot  Hist Gen des Voyages    Specific character of the  Pavo Tibetanus    It is cinereous striated with blackish its head somewhat crested with two spurs  II The SPICIFERE  Pavo Muticus  Linn and Gmel  Pavo Japanensis  Briss  The Japan Peacock  Lath  The Japan Peacock is the name given by Aldrovandus to what is referred to in the eighth species of Pheasant by Brisson and both of  these authors admit that this bird resembles our peacock only by the feet and tail  It has a spikeshaped tuft on its head for which reason I term it  spicifere  This tuft is about four inches high and appears enamelled with green and blue the bill is of an ashcolour longer and more slender than that of the Peacock the iris is yellow and the orbits red as in the Pheasant the tailfeathers are fewer their colour deeper and their spangles broader but glowing with the same tints as in the European Peacock The distribution of the colours forms on the breast the back and that part of the wings next the back a kind of scales which give different reflexions in different places blue on the part of the wings next the back blue and green on the back blue green and goldcolour on the breast the other quills of the wing are green in the middle through their whole length then yellowish and run into black at their extremity the crown of the head and the arch of the neck are covered with blue spots mixed with white on a greenish ground  Such is nearly the description which Aldrovandus has given of the male from a painted figure sent by the Emperor of Japan to the Pope He does not inform us whether it displays its tail like our Peacock but it is certainly  not spread in Aldrovandus' figure nor has it any spurs on the legs though that author has not omitted them in the engraving of the Common Peacock which is placed opposite to serve for comparison  According to Aldrovandus the female is smaller than the male has the same colours on the head neck breast and wings but the underside of its body is black and the coverts of the rump which are much shorter than the quills of the tail are decorated with four or five spangles of considerable breadth in proportion to the size of the quills green is the predominant colour in the tail the feathers are edged with blue and their shafts are whiteThis bird seems to be much akin to the bird which Koempfer in his History of Japan mentions under the name of Pheasant  There is at Japan a kind of Pheasants distinguished by the diversity of their colours by the brilliancy of their feathers and by the beauty of their tail which is as long as half a man's height which by this mixture and charming variety of the richest colours particularly of gold and azure yields in no respect to that of the Peacock  KOEMPFER    Specific character of the  Pavo Muticus  The crest on its head is awlshaped no spurs  III The EPERONNIER  Pavo Bicalcaratus  Linn and Gmel  Pavo Sinensis  Briss  The Peacock Pheasant  Edw  The Iris Pheasant  Lath  This bird is hardly known except from the figure and description which Edwards published of the male and female made from the living subject  At first sight the male seems to bear some analogy to the Pheasant and Peacock like them it has a long tail decorated with spangles as in the Peacock And some naturalists abiding by the first impression have ranged it with the Pheasants  Klein and Brisson  But though from the consideration of these exterior appearances Edwards has been induced to retain the name of PeacockPheasant he was convinced on a closer inspection that it did not belong to the Pheasant kind because The long feathers of the tail are round and not pointed at the end They are straight throughout and not arched back They do not make an inverted gutter by the bending back of their webs as in the Pheasant  It does not walk with its tail raised and recurved as in that bird  Still less does it belong to the Peacock kind from which it differs in the carriage of its tail in the disposition and number of the quills that compose it It is distinguished too by other properties its head and neck are thick its tail does not rise and spread like the Peacock's  Edwards never says that this bird displays its tail I may therefore infer the negative since if the expansion had taken place that intelligent naturalist would have observed it and have mentioned it  and instead of a tuft it has only a sort of flat crest formed by the feathers on the top of the head which bristle and stretch towards a point somewhat projecting and lastly it has a double spur on each leg a singular character from which I have denominated the bird  Eperonnier  from  Eperon  a spur    These external differences which undoubtedly involve many others which are more concealed would seem a sufficient reason to every sensible man who is not prejudiced by systems for excluding it from the Peacocks and Pheasants though like these its toes are parted its feet naked its legs covered with feathers as far as the heel the bill fashioned into a curved cone the tail long and the head without comb or membrane A person who sticks rigidly to a system could not fail to range it with the Peacock or the Pheasant since it possesses all the attributes  of that genus but must the historian exempt from prejudice and unfettered by forms recognise it as the Peacock of Nature  In vain it will be urged that since the principal characters of this bird are the same with those of the Pheasant the little variations ought not to seclude it from that arrangement for I may still ask who has a right to fix these principal characters to decide for instance that the negative attribute of having neither crest nor membrane is more essential than the shape or the size and to pronounce that all birds which resemble each other in characters arbitrarily selected must also agree in their true properties  In laying aside the name of Chinese Peacock I have acted conformably to the testimony of travellers who assure us that through the whole extent of that vast country there are no Peacocks but such as have been introduced from abroad  Navarette  Description de la China    In this bird the iris is yellow and also the space between the bottom of the bill and the eye the upper mandible red the lower mandible of a deep brown and the feet of a dirty brown its plumage is exceedingly beautiful the tail as I have already said is sprinkled with oval spangles and is of a fine purple colour with reflections of blue green and gold The effect of these spangles or mirrors is the more striking as they  are defined and distinguished from the ground by a double circle the one black and the other dull orange Each quill of the tail has two of these mirrors clustered together the shaft passing between them However as the tail contains much fewer quills than that of the Peacock it is much less loaded with spangles but to compensate this it has a very great number on its back and wings where the Peacock has none those on the wings are round and as the ground colour of the plumage is brown it resembles a sable richly strewed with sapphires opals emeralds and topazes The greater quills of the wing are not decorated with spangles all the rest have each only one and their colours whether in the wings or in the tail do not penetrate to the other surface which is of an uniform dull cast  The male exceeds the size of an ordinary Pheasant and the female is a third smaller and appears more lively and active As in the male its iris is yellow but there is no red on its bill and its tail is much smaller And though in the female of this bird the colours are more like those of the male than in the Peacocks or Pheasants they are more faint and dull and have not that lustre and those luminous undulations which produce so charming an effect in the spangles of the male  This bird was alive last year at London and Sir  Codrington sent coloured drawings of it to the younger Daubenton from which our figures were taken  Specific character of the  Pavo Bicalcaratus  It is brown its head somewhat crested two spurs  The HOCCOS  ALL the birds known under the general term Hocco are strangers to Europe they belong to the warmer parts of America And the various names bestowed by different Savages each in his own jargon have contributed no less than the multiplied epithets imposed by nomenclators to introduce confusion I shall endeavour as far as the poverty of observation will permit to dispel the chaos and reduce the nominal to real species  N  o  THE MALE CURASSO  I The HOCCO  properly so called  CraxAlector  Linn and Gmel  Crax Guianensis  Briss  Mituporanga  Ray  The Indian Cock  Pitfield  The Peacock Pheasant of Guiana  Bancr  The Crested Curassow  Lath Brown and Sloane  Under this species I range not only the  Mitou  and the  Mitouporanga  of Marcgrave  which that author considered as of the same kind the Indian cock of the Academicians and of many others the  Mutou  or  Moytou  of Laët the  Temocholli  of the Mexicans and their  Tepetototl  or mountainbird the  Quirizao  or  Curasso  of Jamaica the  Pocs  of Frisch the  Hocco  of Cayenne in Barrere's system the  Hocco  of Guiana or the twelfth Pheasant in Brisson's but I also refer to the same division as varieties the  Hocco  of Brazil and even Albin's Red Hen of Peru  Albin  It is of the same size and figure with the Carassow hen and appears to be of the same species  Thus speaks Albin who had the advantage of delineating the two birds from the life  or Brisson's eleventh species of Pheasant the Hocco of Peru the  Coxolisli  of Fernandez and sixteenth Pheasant in Brisson's system My reason for this arrangement is that this multitude of names is applied to birds having many common characters distinguished only by some slight variations in the disposition of the colours in the fashion of the bill and in some other circumstances which in the same species are affected by the age sex and climate and these diversities are the more to be expected in a species like the present which is so easily tamed and has actually been tamed in some provinces and consequently must partake in some degree of the changes to which domestic animals are subject  Sir Hans Sloane says that their plumage is variegated in different ways like that of common hens    The Academicians had heard that their Indian cock was brought from Africa where it was called  Ano  but as Marcgrave and several other observers inform us that it is a native of Brazil and since we learn from a comparison of the most accurate descriptions and figures that its wings are short and its flight laborious we can hardly be persuaded that it could traverse the immense stretch of ocean that divides the shores of Africa and Brazil It is much more natural to suppose that the subjects dissected by the Academicians if they were really brought from Africa had been previously carried thither either from Brazil or from some other settlement in the New World The same reason will enable us to judge of the propriety of the appellation of the Persian Cock bestowed by Johnston on this bird  The Hocco is nearly as large as a turkey One of its most distinguishing properties is a crest which is black or sometimes black mixed with white about two or three inches high and which extends from the origin of the bill to the back of the head The bird can raise or depress it at pleasure and according as it is differently affected This crest consists of narrow tapering feathers somewhat reclined but the point is reflected and bent forwards Of these feathers the Academicians observed many whose webs were inclosed half the length of their shaft in a kind of membranous case  The prevailing colour of the plumage is black which is for the most part uniform and like velvet on the head and neck and sometimes sprinkled with white speckles the rest of the body has greenish reflections and in some subjects it changes into a deep chesnut as in that of No of the  Planches Enluminées  The bird figured in that plate has no white under the belly or on the tail in which respect it differs from that of No Lastly Others are white below the belly and not at the tail and  vice versâ  and we must observe that these colours are liable to vary both in their tints and in disposition according to the sex  The bill is shaped like that of the gallinaceous tribe but is rather stronger in some it is of a flesh colour and whitish near the point as in the Brazilian Hocco of Brisson in others the end of the upper mandible is grooved on both sides which makes it look as if it were armed with three points the principal one in the middle and the two lateral formed by furrows somewhat farther back as in the Indian Cocks of the Academicians in others the base is covered with a yellow skin in which are placed the nostrils as in the Guiana of Brisson in others this yellow skin extending on both sides of the head forms a circle of the same colour round the eyes as in the  Mitouporanga  of Marcgrave in others this skin swells on the base of the upper mandible into a kind of tubercle or round bump  N  o  THE FEMALE CURASSO  which is pretty hard and about the size of a small nut It is commonly believed that the females have not this protuberance and Edwards adds that it does not grow on the males till after the first year which appears to be the more probable since Fernandez observed in his  Tepetototl  a kind of tumor begun to form on the bill Some individuals as the  Mitou  of Marcgrave have a white skin behind the ear like the common hens The legs would resemble in shape those of the gallinaceous tribe if they had spurs and were not proportionally thicker they vary too in their colour from a darkish brown to a carnation  Some naturalists would refer the Hocco to the genus of the turkey but it is easy from the foregoing description and from the figure to collect numerous and decisive differences which discriminate these kinds In the turkey the head is small and not feathered which is also the case with the top of the neck the bill bears a conical muscular protuberance capable of being dilated and contracted the legs are armed with spurs the tail feathers can be spread like a fan c whereas in the Hocco the head is large the neck sunk and both are clothed with feathers on the bill is a round hard and almost bony swelling and on the crown of the head a moveable crest which seems to be peculiar to this bird and which is raised and depressed at  pleasure but no person has ever asserted that it can expand its tail feathers like a fan  To these exterior differences add the more intimate essential disparities which appear from dissection to be as numerous  The intestinal canal is much longer and the two  coeca  much shorter than in the turkey its craw is also much less capacious being only four inches round but I have seen a crop taken out of a turkey that seemed to have nothing unusual in its structure that could contain half a Paris pint dry measure Besides in the Hocco the fleshy substance of the gizzard is for the most part very thin and its inner coat on the contrary very thick and so hard as even to be apt to crack Lastly The  trachea arteria  dilates and makes an inflexure near where it forks as happens in some aquatic birds quite contrary to what is observed in the turkey  But if the Hocco be not a turkey the modern nomenclators had still less reason to suppose it a Pheasant for besides those differences which will readily be perceived externally and internally there is a decisive one in the instincts of these birds The Pheasant is always wild though bred from its infancy though treated kindly and fed with great attention it never becomes reconciled to the domestic state it is ever a restless prisoner ever seeking the means of escape it even abuses the companions of its slavery and never associates with them When  it recovers its liberty and is restored to the savage state for which it seems to be formed nothing can be more timorous or mistrustful every new object is viewed with a suspicious aspect the least noise scares it and the slightest motion disturbs its quiet even the shadow of a branch shaken by the wind is sufficient to make it take wing On the contrary the Hocco is a calm bird secure and even stupid which perceives no danger or at least makes no exertion to shun it it seems to forget itself and to be careless of its own existence Aublet shot nine of them in the same flock with the same piece which he loaded as often as required Such was their patient tranquillity We may suppose that such a bird must be sociable that it will readily accommodate itself to the other domestic fowls and that it can be easily tamed And though trained it roams to a great distance during the day but always returns again in the evening as Aublet tells me himself It becomes so tame as to rub with its bill on the door to gain admission to pull the servants by the clothes when they neglect it to follow its master every where or if not allowed it waits anxiously for his return and on seeing him again shews every sign of joy and affection  It is difficult to conceive habits more opposite and I should imagine that no naturalist or even nomenclator if he had been acquainted with  them would have ventured to refer these two birds to the same genus  The Hocco loves to inhabit the mountains if we may infer this from the import of the name  Tepetototl  which in the Mexican language signifies  mountainbird  When kept in cages it is fed on bread paste and other such things  Fernandez  It is fond of perching on trees especially to pass the night It flies tardily as I have observed above but its carriage is bold  Barrere  Its flesh is white though rather dry but when kept a sufficient time it is pleasant eating  Fernandez Marcgrave c    Sir Hans Sloane says that its tail is only two inches long which Edwards conceives to be printed by mistake for ten But I should imagine that this correction is too general and unlimited for I observe that Aldrovandus asserts from a drawing of a bird of this sort that it has no tail And on the other hand Barrere relates from his own observations which he made on the spot that the female of his Amazon Hocco which is the CurassowHocco of Brisson has a short tail Whence it appears that what Sir Hans Sloane has affirmed with regard to the Hocco in general must be restricted to the female only at least in certain tribes  Specific character of the  CraxAlector  Its cere is yellow its body black its belly white  II The PAUXI or STONE  CraxPauxi  Linn and Gmel  Gallina Indica Alba  Will  Crax Mexicanus  Briss  The Cushew Curassow  Lath and Edw  We have figured this bird in the  Planches Enluminées  under the name of  Stone of Cayenne  which is really what it bears in the  Royal Menagerie  where the drawing was made after the life But as in its native country which is Mexico it is known by the name of  Pauxi  according to Fernandez I have thought proper to employ both these namesIt is the fourth species of the Pheasant of Brisson which he terms the  Mexican Hocco  This bird resembles the preceding in many respects but it differs in some particulars Its head is not tufted like the other the swelling on the bill is larger of the shape of a pear and of a blue colour Fernandez says that this tubercle is as hard as a stone and this is the reason I suppose why it was called first the  Stonebird  and then the  Stone  for the same cause that it was first named  Cusco  or  Cushewbird  and  Numidianhen  from this bump which some have conceived to resemble the American nut called  cusco  or  cushew  and others have imagined that it is like the casque of the Pintado  But these are not the only differences which distinguish the Pauxi from the preceding Hoccos it is smaller its bill is stronger more hooked and almost as much so as that of the parrot Besides it is much more seldom brought to Europe than the Hocco Edwards who saw the Hocco in almost every collection could not meet with a single Cashew or Pauxi in the course of his inquiries  The elegant black of its plumage has blue and purple reflections which cannot be represented in the design  This bird perches on trees but it lays on the ground like the pheasants leads its young and even calls them together The brood live first on infects and afterwards when they are grown up they feed on fruits seeds and whatever is proper for poultry  Aublet and Fernandez    The Pauxi is as gentle or if we chuse as stupid as the other Hoccos for it will sit still though fired at six times in succession yet according to Fernandez it will not suffer itself to be caught or handled and M Aublet informs me that it is found in uninhabited places which is probably one of the causes why it is so rarely brought to Europe  Brisson says that the male differs from the female only by the colours having brown where the other is black but that they are in other respects alike Aldrovandus however admitting  that the plumage is in general brown observes that its wings and tail are cinereous that the bill is less hooked and that it has no tail which would be a feature of coincidence with the Amazon Hocco of Barrere in which as we have already noticed the tail of the female is much shorter than that of the male and these are not the only American birds which want the tail in a certain part of that continent the poultry transported from Europe lose their tail and rump as we have already observed in the history of the cock  Specific character of the  Crax Pauxi  Its cere is blue a crested bunch on its nostrils its body blackish its belly and the tip of its tail white  III The HOAZIN  Phasianus Cristatus  Gmel  Crax Fuscus Mexicanus  Briss  The Crested Pheasant  Lath  This bird is figured in the  Planches Enluminees  under the name of  Crested Cayenne Pheasant  at least it does not differ sensibly from that as will appear by comparing No with the description of Fernandez  According to that author the Hoazin is not quite so large as a turkeyhen its bill is hooked its breast of a yellowish white the wings and tail marked with spots or white rays an inch asunder the back the upper side of the neck the sides of the head are of a tawny brown the legs are of a dirty colour It has a crest composed of feathers that are whitish on one side and black on the other this crest is taller and differently shaped from that of the Hoccos and it does not appear that they can raise and depress it at pleasure its head also is smaller and its neck more slender  Its voice is very strong and more like a braying than a cry It is said that it calls its own name probably in a sad frightful tone Nothing more was wanted among savage tribes to place it in the class of inauspicious birds and as the human mind is naturally prone to imagine the object of dread endowed with vast power these rude people draw from it remedies for the most inveterate and alarming disorders They do not appear however to feed on it they abstain perhaps through fear which it inspires or perhaps from an aversion because it lives commonly on serpents It inhabits generally extensive forests where it perches on trees beside water to watch and surprise these reptiles It is found in the warmest parts of Mexico Hernandez adds that it appears in autumn  which gives room to suspect that it is a bird of passage  HernandezFernandez speaks of another bird to which he gives the name of  Hoazin  though from his account it appears to be very different from what we have described for besides that it is smaller its cry is very agreeable and resembles sometimes a laugh or a sneering laugh its flesh is eaten though neither tender nor well tastedThe bird cannot be tamed  I should rather discover the Hoazin in another bird mentioned by the same author after the Pauxi He thus describes it  Another bird must be ranged with the Pauxi It is of the size of a stork its colour cinereous the crest eight inches long and composed of many feathers these dilated especially on the top  Here is distinctly the crest and the size of the Hoazin    M Aublet assures me that this bird which he easily recognized in No of the  Planches Enluminées  can be tamed and that it is sometimes a sort of domestic among the Indians and that the French call it a peacock The young are fed with ants worms and other insects  Specific character of the  Phasianus Cristatus  Above brown below rufouswhite its vent rufous its head crested a naked red space about the eyes the tail wedgeshaped with a yellow tip  IV The YACOU  Penelope Cristata  Gmel  Meleagris Cristata  Linn  Phasianus Fuscus Brasiliensis  Klein  Iacupema  Marcg Ray and Will  The Guan  or  Quan  Edw and Lath  This bird has named itself for its cry is according to Marcgrave  Yacou  whence is derived the name  Iacupema  I have preferred that of Yacou as the easiest and the best adapted  Marcgrave is the first who has spoken of this bird Some naturalists copying him have ranged it with the pheasants others such as Brisson and Edwards have classed it with the turkies But it is neither the one nor the otherit is not a turkey though it has a red skin under the neck for it differs in many respects in its size which is scarcely equal to that of a common hen its head is partly covered with feathers and its crest is much more like that of the Hoccos than that of the crested turkey and its legs have no spursbesides it has not the bunch of hard hair under the neck nor the muscular caruncle on the bill as in the turkeycock nor does it expand the feathers of its tail On the other hand it is not a pheasant for it has the long and slender bill and the crest of  the Hoccos its neck is slender it has a fleshy membrane under the throat its tailfeathers are all of an equal length and its dispositions are mild and gentle all which characters distinguish it from the pheasants and its cry differs from both that of the pheasant and of the turkey But what shall we then make it It shall be a Yacou having some analogies with the turkey the fleshy membrane under the throat and the tail composed of equal quills with the pheasants the eye encircled with black skin the wings short and the tail long with the Hocco the long tail the crest and mild disposition but which is distinguished from all these by numerous and marked differences and therefore constitutes a separate species  We can hardly doubt that the  Guan  or  Quan  of Edwards so called according to him in the West Indies probably by some other tribe of Savages is at least a variety of the Yacou from which it differs only in being not so tall and its eyes of another colour but such differences may take place in the same species especially since it is domesticated  Black mixed with brown is the prevailing colour of its plumage but with different reflections and some white streaks on the neck breast belly c the legs are of a bright red  The flesh of the Yacou is excellent meat All that is known with respect to its other properties has been related in the beginning of this article  Ray considers it as of the same species with the coxolitli of Fernandez but that bird is much larger and has not under its throat that fleshy membrane which characterizes the Yacou and for this reason I have classed it with the Hoccos properly so called  Specific character of the  Penelope Cristata  Its head is crested with erect feathers its temples violet  V The MARAIL  PenclopeMarail  Gmel  The Marail Turkey  Lath  No author has taken notice of the female of the Yacou except Edwards who conjectures that it has no crest From this single authority and the comparison of the most accurate figures and stuffed specimens I am inclined to suppose that the bird figured in No of the  Planches Enluminées  under the name of  The Greenish Pheasant of Cayenne  and which is generally called in that island  The Marail  is perhaps the female of the species of Yacou for I can discover many decisive points of resemblance to the  Guan  of Edwards Plate XIII in its size the colour of its  plumage and its general shape if we except only the crest which is wanting in the female in its port in the length of its tail in the red circle that surrounds the eyes  This naked skin is blue in the Yacou and red in the Marail but we have before observed the same difference of colour between one sex and the other in the fleshy membranes of the Pintado  the red naked space below the throat the form of its feet and bill c I must own that I have also perceived some differences the quills of the tail are like organ pipes as in the pheasant and not equal as in the Guan of Edwards and the nostrils are not so near the origin of the bill but it would not be difficult to instance a number of species in which the female differs still more from the male and in which there are varieties that are more remote from each other  M Aublet who saw this bird in its native country tells me that it is easily tamed and that its flesh is delicate and richer and superior in succulency to that of the pheasant He adds that it is a real turkey only smaller than what is naturalized in Europe and this is still another point of resemblance to the Yacou its having been taken for a turkey  This bird is not only found in Cayenne but if we may judge from the identity of the name it inhabits the country which is watered by the majestic stream of the Amazons for Barrere speaks of the Marail of the Amazons as a bird whose plumage is black its bill green and no  tail We have seen in the account of the Hocco and the Stone of Cayenne that in these species some individuals without tails have been taken for females is this the case too with the Marails With regard to most of these foreign birds so little known if we adhere to veracity we must speak with diffidence and hesitation  Specific character of the  Penelope Marail    It is greenish black the space about its eyes naked and its feet red the throat somewhat naked and dotted with white  VI The CARACARA  I give this name which is expressive of its cry to that beautiful bird of the Antilles described by Father du Tertre  If all the American birds that have been taken for pheasants must be referred to the Hocco tribe the Caracara ought to be ranged with these for the French inhabitants of the Antilles and Father du Tertre after them have applied to it the name of  Pheasant  This Pheasant is  says he  a very beautiful bird about the size of a capon taller and with legs like those of the peacock Its neck is much longer than that of a cock and the bill and head resemble those of a raven all the feathers of the neck  and breast are of a fine shining blue as pleasing as peacock's plumes all the back is of a brown gray and the wings and tail which are rather short are black  When this bird is tamed it becomes master of the house and drives off the common hens and turkeyhens and sometimes even kills them Nor does it allow the dogs to pass without offering violence I saw one which was a mortal enemy to Negroes and would not permit one to enter the hut but picked their legs and feet so cruelly as to draw blood  Those who have eaten them affirm that their flesh is as good as that of the pheasants in France  How could Ray suppose that such a bird was the ravenous bird mentioned by Marcgrave under the same name It is true indeed that it fights with the poultry and flies at dogs and Negroes but this it does only when tamed We shall more easily discover in it the natural jealousy of a domestic animal which cannot bear the rivals in his master's favour than the ferocious dispositions of a bird of prey which darts on others to tear them in pieces and devour them Besides it is not common that the flesh of a rapacious bird is delicate eating as is that of the Caracara Lastly It appears that in the Caracara of Marcgrave the tail and wings are much longer in proportion than in that of Father du Tertre  VII The CHACAMEL  Penelope Vociferans  Gmel  The Crying Curassow  Lath  Fernandez speaks of a bird which is of the same country and nearly the same size with the preceding and which in the Mexican language is called  Chachalacamelt  from which I have formed  Chacamel  for the easier pronunciation Its chief character is that of having a cry like the common hen or rather like the clamorous noise of a number of fowls for it is so constant and so loud that a single bird of this kind is said to make as much din as a whole courtyard Hence is derived the Mexican name which signifies the  crying bird  It is brown on the back of a duskywhite on the belly and the bill and feet are bluish  The Chacamel like most of the Hoccos commonly inhabits the mountains where it rears its young  Specific character of the  Penelope Vociserans    Its bill is bluish its back brown its breast blue its belly whitishbrown  VIII The PARRAKA AND HOITLALLOTL  Phasianus Parraqua  Lath Ind  The Parraka Pheasant  Lath Syn  Phasianus Mexicanus  Gmel  The Courier Pheasant  Lath  As far as we can judge from the imperfect hints of Fernandez and Barrere we may range here The Parraka  Specific character  It is brown below fulvous its top fulvous its tail equal  of the latter which he calls  Pheasant  and of which he says only that the feathers of the head are of a tawny colour and form a kind of crest The  Hoitlallotl  or Long Bird of the former which inhabits the warm regions of Mexico  Specific character  It is tawnywhite its tail long and green  This bird has a long tail short wings and a laborious flight like most of the foregoing but it outstrips the fleetest horses It is not so large as the Hoccos being only eighteen inches from the tip of the bill to the end of the tail Its general colour is white verging on the fulvous Near the tail it is stained with black mixed with some white spots but the tail itself is of a varying green which has reflections nearly like the peacock's plumes  These birds are so little known that we cannot venture to refer them to their species I range them here only because those few properties which we do know belong more to the birds just described than to others Their true place must be assigned from actual observation In the mean time I have done what I can to draw the curiosity of those who have it in their power to observe the facts  The PARTRIDGE  IT is often the most difficult to give an accurate and consistent account of those species which are the most generally known When a person meets for the first time with a bird which he has never before seen he overlooks the minute characters and seizing the more obvious resemblances he refers it to that tribe with which he is previously best acquainted Hence that strange incoherent jumble of names which have been formed on the relations of hasty and inaccurate observers We have already been more than once embarrassed in this chaos of terms and I am afraid that the article of the Partridge will not be the last which requires a critical examination  I take the Common Partridge for the basis and first species of the genus as being the best known and therefore the fittest subject for comparisonI shall admit one variety and three permanent breeds  These permanent breeds are The  Common Gray Partridge  and as a variety of it the  White Gray Partridge  of Brisson The  Damascus Partridge  not that of Belon which is the Hazel Grous but that of Aldrovandus which is smaller than our Gray Partridge and which  appears to be the same with the Little Partridge a bird of passage well known to our sportsmen The  Mountain Partridge  which is figured in No of the  Planches Enluminées  and which seems to form the shade between the Gray and the Red Partridges  In the second species I range the Red Partridge into which I admit two permanent breeds in France and one variety and two foreign breeds  The two permanent Red Partridges which are found in France are No  Planches Enluminées  The  Greek Partridge  Pl  The two foreign species are The  Red Barbary Partridge  of Edwards Pl The  Rufousbreasted Partridge  which is found on the banks of the Gambra  As the plumage of the Red Partridge is liable to assume shades of white like that of the Gray Partridge thence results a variety exactly similar to that in the latter  From this genus I exclude several species which have been improperly referred to it  The Francolin which we have removed from the Partridges because it differs from them not only by its general shape but by some particular characters as in the spurs c  The bird called by Brisson the  Senegal Partridge  and which he makes his eighth species This bird appears to me to be more akin to the Francolins than to the Partridges  and as it has two spurs on each leg I shall give it the epithet of  Double Spur  The African Red Partridge  The third foreign species called by Brisson the  Great Partridge of Brazil  which he supposes to be the  Macucagua  of Marcgrave from whom he copies the description and confounds it with the  Agamia  from Cayenne which is a bird wholly different from both  The  Yambou  of Marcgrave which is the Brazilian Partridge of Brisson and which has neither the shape the habits nor the characters of the Partridge since according to Brisson himself it has a long bill perches upon trees and lays blue eggs  The American Partridge of Catesby and Brisson which also perches and prefers the woods to the cleared grounds a character which does not belong to the Partridge  A multitude of American birds which the herd of travellers have called Partridges from some slight resemblance inaccurately observed Such are the birds known at Guadeloupe under the names of  Red Partridges    Gray Partridges  and  Black Partridges  though according to the accounts of persons better informed they are pigeons or turtles since they have neither the bill nor the flesh of the Partridge perch on trees where they build their nests lay only two eggs and since the young do not run as soon as they quit the shell but are fed by the parents in the  nest like turtles Such too are most probably those Partridges which Carreri saw on the mountains of the Havannah such the  Manbouris  the  Pegassous  and the  Pegacans  of Lery and such perhaps are some American birds which I have ranked in the class of Partridges on the authority of writers when their relations seemed not contradicted by facts though I must own that it is not likely birds so heavy could cross the intervening ocean  The GRAY PARTRIDGE  In Italian  Perdice  in Spanish  Perdiz  in German  Wildhun  or  Feldhun  in Swedish  Rapphoena  in Polish  Kuroptwa    TetraoPerdix  Linn and Gmel  Perdix Cinerea  Ray Will and Briss  The Common Partridge  Penn and Lath  Though Aldrovandus judging of other countries from his own asserts that Gray Partridges abound in every part of the globe it is certain that there are none in the island of Crete and it is probable that they never inhabited Greece for Athenaeus remarks with surprize that all the Italian Partridges had not a red bill like those of Greece Nor are they  equally spread through Europe they seem to avoid the extremes both of heat and cold and are found neither in Africa nor in Lapland They thrive most in the temperate parts of France and Germany It is true indeed that Boterius says that they do not inhabit Ireland but this must be understood of the Red Partridges which are not found even in England according to the best authors of that country and which have not penetrated in that direction beyond the islands of Guernsey and Jersey The Common Partridge is frequent in Sweden where Linnaeus tells us it winters under the snow in a kind of burrow which has a double entrance This manner of lodging during the severe season is very like that of the Ptarmigan which we have already described and if this fact were not averred by a man of so high reputation as Linnaeus I should suspect some mistake especially as in France the long winters with great falls of snow prove fatal to numbers of Partridges Lastly as it is a bird of laborious flight I am much inclined to suspect that it has never migrated into America and I should imagine that those birds of the New World which are referred to this genus would be separated from it if they were better known  The Gray Partridge differs in many respects from the Red but what makes me consider them as distinct kinds is that according to the  remark of the few sportsmen who can make observations though they sometimes inhabit the same spot they never associate together A vacant male of the one species will sometimes indeed consort with a pair of the other follow them and even discover symptoms of jealousy yet it never copulates with the female though it is reduced to abstinence and beholds continually the sweets of conjugal felicity and feels the enlivening influence of spring  The Gray Partridge is also of a gentler nature than the Red and not difficult to tame and when not teazed it soon becomes familiar  Ray asserts the contrary but as he confesses that the Red Partridges are never seen in England his authority will not in this instance weigh against actual observers  However they never could be formed into flocks that would be driven as has been done with the Red Partridges for the Red Partridges are those which travellers as Olina remarks describe as being bred in numerous flocks on some islands of the Mediterranean The Gray Partridges have also a more social turn since each family continues in a single body or covey till the pairing of love If a hatch from some accident does not completely succeed the families recruit their strength by uniting with others and adopting the feeble remnants of such as have suffered most severely from the sportsmen so that about the end of  summer they often compose new coveys more numerous than at first and which continue associated till next year  These birds are fond of corn countries especially where the fields are in high cultivation and manured with marl no doubt because they find there abundance of food both grain and insects and perhaps the saline quality of the marl which contributes so much to the fertility of the soil is also suited to their constitution or taste Gray Partridges prefer the open country and never resort to copses or vineyards but when they are pursued by the fowler or by the bird of prey yet they do not lodge in the depths of the forests and I have been frequently told that they never pass the night among bushes or thickets however a Partridge's nest was found in a bush at the root of a vine They begin about the end of winter after the intense frosts to pair that is each male selects his female companion and retires But this new arrangement is not effected without violent disputes among the males and sometimes even among the females War and love are in most animals inseparable especially among those which like the Partridges are stimulated by an ardent appetite The females of this species like the common hens lay without having had intercourse with the male When the Partridges are once paired they never part but live in the closest and the  most faithful union Sometimes after they are paired the weather grows severe and then they all gather together and again form the covey  Gray Partridges seldom breed at least in France before the end of March above a month after they have begun to pair and they do not lay before May or even June if the winter has lasted long They make their nest in general with little care or preparation some grass or straw strewed roughly in the print of an ox or a horse's foot is all they require It is observed however that the older and more experienced females take greater pains with their nests than young ones and are more careful both in guarding against inundation and in chusing a spot somewhat elevated and protected naturally by brushwood They generally lay from fifteen to twenty eggs and sometimes twentyfive but the number is much smaller when the bird is either very young or very old such too is the second hatch made by Partridges of the proper age when the first has been destroyed The eggs are nearly of the same colour with those of pigeons Pliny says that they are white  Lib x  The incubation lasts about three weeks more or less according to the degree of heat of the season  The female takes upon herself the whole task of covering and during that time she undergoes  a considerable moult for all the feathers of the belly drop She sits with great assiduity and it is said that she never leaves her eggs without strewing them with leaves The male attentive to his mate generally settles near the nest ready to accompany her when she rises in quest of food and his attachment is so faithful and steady that he prefers this laborious office to the free pleasures which the calls of other Partridges solicit him to enjoy to these he sometimes replies but never quits his station to indulge his appetite At the expiration of the regular time if the season be favourable and the incubation succeed the chicks pierce the shell with great ease and as soon as they have extricated themselves they begin to run carrying sometimes a part of the shell with them It happens sometimes however that they are unable to burst from their prison and that they die in the struggle In this case the feathers of the young bird are found glued to the inner surface of the shell which must happen whenever the egg is exposed to too great heat To remedy this malady dip the eggs five or six minutes in water so that the moisture may soak through the shell and loosen the feathers This kind of bathing may also perhaps refresh the young bird and give it additional strength to force a passage The same happens with regard to pigeons and many other useful birds which  might be saved by the method I have described or some analogous experiment  The male though it has no share in the incubation assists the mother in raising the young They lead them in common continually call them together point out to them their proper food and teach them to find it by scratching the ground with their nails It is not uncommon to discover them squatted beside each other covering the chickens with their wings whose heads project on all sides presenting very lively eyes In such case the parents are not easily flushed and the sportsman who is attentive to the preservation of his game avoids disturbing so interesting an office But if the pointer comes too near or runs in upon them the male is always the first that springs venting his anguish in a peculiar cry and appropriated to this emergence He stops thirty or forty paces distant and sometimes even he returns upon the dog and beats it with his wingsto such a degree does parental affection inspire courage in the most timid animals Sometimes that tender sentiment inspires in these birds a sort of prudence and suggests expedients for saving the brood When the male springs in such cases he has been observed to fly slowly and hanging his wing as if to decoy the enemy into a pursuit in the expectation of an easy prey while the bird keeps always before him but at such a short distance as continually  to afford hopes till the sportsman is carried away from the covey On the other hand the female springs shortly after the male and shoots to a much greater distance and invariably in a different direction Immediately after she has alighted she returns back running along the furrow and finds her chickens scattered and squatted among the grass and the leaves hastily collects them and before the dog has returned from the eager pursuit of the male she has led them to a distant spot without giving the slightest notice to the sportsman by the noise in retreating It is an observation with respect to animals which holds very generally that the ardor for copulation is the measure of the solicitude for their progeny The Partridge is an instance few birds are so amorous and few discover such an assiduous or such bold vigilance for their young This strength of affection sometimes degenerates into rancour which the mother discovers to other coveys pursuing them and tearing them with her bill  The legs of the young Partridges are at first yellow which colour grows lighter running into white and afterwards turns brown and at last when the bird is three or four years old it deepens into black This is a method of discovering their age another is drawn from the appearance of the last feather of the wing  which is pointed after the first moult but in the following year is quite round  The first food of young Partridges is ants eggs and the small insects which they find on the ground and among the herbage Those which are fed within doors refuse grain for a long time and probably this is not their proper aliment till they are grown up They always prefer lettuce succory chickweed sowthistle groundsel and even the shoots of springing corn In the month of November their stomach is found filled with that substance and during the winter they learn to search for the tender herbage beneath the snow But when the ground is stiff with frost they resort to the mild springs and crop the herbs on their margins though not suited to their constitutionIn summer they are never observed to drink  Partridges are three months old when the red tint discovers itself for the Gray Partridges also have red on the side of the temples between the eye and the ear and its appearance is a critical period with these birds as with all others in like cases since it advances the adult state Previous to this they are delicate their wing feeble and they dread the damps but after they have recovered from the shock they become hardy and begin to ply their wings to spring together and constantly keep company and though the covey be dispersed they learn to assemble again in spite of the precautions of the sportsman  They assemble by a call every body knows the cry of the Partridge which is not very pleasant it is rather a sharp grating noise like that of a scythe than a warble The mythologists struck with this resemblance metamorphosed the inventor of that instrument into a Partridge  Ovid's Metamorphoses Book viii  The note of the male differs not from the female except in being louder and more drawling The male is besides distinguished from the female by a blunt spur on each leg and a black mark like a horsehoe under the belly which is not found in the other sex  In this species as in many others there are more males hatched than females  About a third more according to Ray  and it is a matter of some consequence to destroy the supernumerary males which disturb the pairs already formed and check multiplication The common method of catching them is to call them in the pairing season by means of a female and the best for this purpose is one that has been taken old The males flock to the female's voice and fall into the fowler's snares So headlong they rush into danger as sometimes to alight on houses or even on the shoulder of the birdcatcher The most proper sort of snares and what are the least liable to accidents are a kind of large weel nets of a tunnel shape into which the Partridges are driven by a person disguised  like a cow who to aid the deception holds in his hand one of the bells usually fastened to the necks of cattle  Olina  After they are entangled in the lines the supernumerary males are selected and sometimes even all the males are taken and the females are set at liberty  The Gray Partridges are sedentary birds which not only continue in the same country but which stray as little as possible from the neighbourhood where they are bred and they always return again They fear much the bird of prey when they perceive him they crowd close one upon another but their formidable enemy discovers them from a distance approaches them glancing along the ground in order to spring one of which he may catch on the wing Surrounded by so many enemies and exposed to so many dangers we may naturally suppose that few will reach a great age Some fix the period of their life at seven years and assert that in their second year they have attained their full vigour and give over laying in the sixth Olina says that they live twelve or fifteen years  It has been tried to breed Partridges in parks for the purpose of stocking grounds not inhabited by them The experiment has succeeded and it has been found that they may be raised nearly the same way as Pheasants only no dependence must be had on the eggs of domestic  Partridges Seldom do they lay when reduced to that state and still seldomer do they pair and copulate and they never have been observed to hatch in those inclosures where the Pheasants so readily breed We must therefore search in the fields for the eggs of free Partridges and set them under common hens A single hen can hatch about two dozen and rear that number of young which will follow this stranger as well as they would do their natural mother but they are not so well acquainted with her voice They become however familiarized to it in a certain degree and the Partridge thus bred retains through the rest of its life the habit of calling when she hears the clucking of hens  The Gray Partridges are much less delicate to raise than the Red sort and not so subject to diseases at least in France which it would seem is their congenial climate It is unnecessary even to give them ants eggs and they may be fed like the common poultry on bread crumbs hard eggs c When they have grown stout and begin to seek their food they may be let loose where they are bred and from which place they never as I have already noticed remove to any great distance  The flesh of the Common Partridge has long been esteemed delicious and wholesome food It has two properties which are seldom combined it is juicy and yet not fat These birds have twentytwo quills in each wing and  eighteen in the tail of which the four midones are of the same colour with the back  Willughby    The nostrils which are at the origin of the bill are more than half covered with a screen of the same colour with the bill but of a softer substance as in the common hens The naked space between the eye and the ear is of a brighter red in the male than the female  The intestinal canal is about two feet and a half long and the two  coeca  are each five or six inches The craw is very small  Ingluvies ampla  says Willughby but in the Partridge which I dissected it was very small  and the gizzard is full of gravel mixed with the food as observed in all the granivorous tribes  Specific character of the Common Partridge  Tetrao Perdix    It has a naked saffron spot under its eyes its tail is ferruginous its breast brown its feet whitish  Its egg is somewhat pearshaped and greenish gray  The GRAYWHITE PARTRIDGE  Tetrao Perdix  Var Linn  Perdix CinercoAlba  Briss  This bird was known to Aristotle  Lib v  and noticed by Scaliger  Exercit in Cardanum  for they both speak of the  While Partridge  and we cannot suppose that they meant the Ptarmigan sometimes improperly so called since Aristotle could not be acquainted with that bird which is not an inhabitant of Greece Asia or any country to which his information reached And indeed what proves decidedly this position he does not remark the characteristic property of this bird that its feet are feathered to the toes With regard to Scaliger he could not possibly confound these two species because in the same chapter where he speaks of the White Partridge of which he had eaten he a little afterwards discourses at great length on the  Lagopus  of Pliny whose feet are clothed with plumage and which is the true Ptarmigan  The Grayish White Partridge is by no means so white as the Ptarmigan the ground only is of that colour and is sullied with the same specks as in the Common Partridge distributed in the same manner But what fully proves that the difference in the colour of the plumage is only accidental and forms a variety of the Gray Partridge is that according to naturalists and even according to sportsmen it mingles and associates with that species One of my friends  Le Roi  Lieutenant des Chasses  at Versailles  saw a covey of ten or twelve Partridges which were entirely white and was witness to their pairing with the common sort in the breeding season  These White Partridges had white eyes or rather white pupils as happens too in white hares white mice c the bill and legs were of a lead colour  The DAMASCUS PARTRIDGE  La Petite Perdrix Grise  Buff  Tetrao Damascenus  Gmel  Perdix Damascena  Briss c  This Partridge described by Aldrovandus is probably the small migratory species which has been observed at different times in several provinces of France  It differs from the Gray Partridge not only in its size which is always inferior but by its bill which is longer by the yellow colour of its legs and above all the habit of changing its residence It has been seen in Brie and in other places passing in numerous flocks and pursuing its journey without halting A gamekeeper in the neighbourhood of Montbard saw last March a flight of one hundred and fifty or two hundred which seemed to turn aside and suspend their progress at the noise of the call but were entirely gone the next day This simple fact which is undoubted points out the analogy  and the difference between this species and the common sort Their being drawn by the call shewed their affinity their rapid flight through a country equally suited to the Gray and Red Partridges which both reside in it the whole year denotes another instinct and consequently another organization and at least another family  We must not confound this Damascus or Syrian Partridge with the  Syroperdix  of Aelian found in the vicinity of Antioch whose plumage was black the bill fulvous the flesh firmer and better flavoured and the disposition more savage than that of other Partridges for the colours we see do not correspond and Aelian does not tell us that this  Syroperdix  is a bird of passage He adds as a singular circumstance that it swallows stones which however is very common in the granivorous tribes Scaliger mentions a remarkable fact to which he was witness and which bears some relation to the present it is that in Gascony where the land is very sandy their flesh was mixed with minute particles which was very disagreeable  Specific character of the Damascus Partridge  Tetrao Damascenus    It has a naked saffron spot under its eyes its tail is ferruginous its breast brown its feet yellow  The MOUNTAIN PARTRIDGE  Le Perdrix de Montagne  Buff  Tetrao Montanus  Gmel  Perdix Montana  Briss  I make this Partridge a distinct species since it resembles neither the Gray nor the Red sort It would be difficult to decide to which of these kinds we ought to refer it for if on the one hand it be certain they sometimes breed with Gray Partridges on the other their ordinary residence is on mountains and the red colour of their bill and legs also shews a close relation to the Gray Partridge and I am strongly inclined to suspect that they sometimes even consort with these I am therefore persuaded that it constitutes the intermediate species between these extremes it is nearly the size of the Gray Partridge and has twenty quills in the tail  Specific character of the Mountain Partridge  Tetrao Montanus    Its feet and bill are red its throat tawnyyellowish  The RED PARTRIDGES  The GREEK PARTRIDGE  La Bartavelle  ou  Perdrix Grecque  Buff  Tetrao Rufus  Linn and Gmel  Perdix Graeca  Briss  Pernice  Zinn  Whatever the ancients have said on the subject of Partridges we must refer to the Red kinds and especially to the  Bartavelle  Aristotle was undoubtedly best acquainted with the Greek Partridge nor is it probable that he knew any but the Red Partridges since these are the only Partridges that are found in Greece or in the islands of the Mediterranean  Belon  and in all probability in the part of Asia conquered by Alexander situated in nearly the same latitude with Greece and the Mediterranean  It appears that only the Red Partridge was known to the Jews since they represent it as an inhabitant of the mountains  The king of Israel is come out to seek a flea  as one would hunt a Partridge on the mountains  Samuel chap ver  and which was probably the source of Aristotle's principal information With respect to the succeeding naturalists such as Pliny Athenaeus c we plainly see that though they were acquainted with other Partridges in Italy besides the Red they were contented with barely copying what Aristotle had said It is  indeed true that the Grecian philosopher admitted a difference in the cries of the Partridges  Some  others    but we cannot thence infer any real distinction of species for this diversity often results from the age or sex has place even in the same individual and may be the effect of some local cause or of the influence of climate which the ancients themselves admitted since Athenaeus asserts that the Partridges which passed from Attica into Boeotia were known to change their cry  Gesner  Besides Theophrastus who also remarks some varieties in the notes of the Partridges according to the countries which they inhabit certainly supposes them not to be all of different species for he describes the different voices in his treatise "  On the various Notes of Birds of the same kind  "  On examining the accounts which the ancients have given respecting this bird I discover many accurate facts and observations disfigured by a heap of exaggerations and fables on which some moderns  Willughby  have shewn their pleasantry though it required no great talents to ridicule I shall endeavour to trace the origin of these tales from the nature and instincts of the Partridge  Aristotle relates that this bird is fond of rolling in the dust has a craw a gizzard and very small  caeca  Hist Anim  lib ii cap ult and lib vi  that it lives fifteen years and  more  Lib ix  Gesner has inadvertently put twentyfive years in his version which error has been copied by Aldrovandus Athenaeus makes Aristotle say that the female lives longer than the male as usual in birds  that like all other birds of a laborious flight it builds no nest but lays its eggs on the open ground on a little herbage or leaves strewed carelessly  Lib vi  though in a spot of good aspect and sheltered from the attacks of rapacious birds that in this species which is of a very amorous disposition the males fight obstinately with each other in love season and that at that time their testicles are distinctly seen though in winter  Lib iii  they are hardly visible that the females can lay eggs without any intercourse with the male  Id ibid  that both sexes copulate by opening the mouth and darting out the tongue  Lib v  Avicenna has thence been led to say that the Partridges work up their passion by the closest kisses and caresses like the pigeons but this is a mistake  that their hatch commonly consists of twelve or fifteen eggs that sometimes they cannot retain their eggs but drop them wherever they happen to be  Lib ix  But after mentioning these facts which are incontestible and which are confirmed by the observations of the moderns Aristotle adds many circumstances where the truth is disguised and which must be analised in order to extract what is valuable from the mixture  He says That the female Partridges lay most of their eggs in a concealed spot to save  them from the male who seeks to destroy them as impeding his pleasures  Id ibid  This is reckoned ridiculous by Willughby but I am inclined to think that he has been too hasty in passing judgment for if we distinguish between the fact observed and the intention implied the assertion of Aristotle is literally true and is nothing more than that the Partridge like all the other females of the feathered race is industrious to conceal her nest lest the males especially the supernumerary ones seeking to copulate in the time of incubation disturb the function by the gratification of their appetites For this reason it has always been recommended to destroy the superfluous males as one of the most efficacious means of advancing the multiplication of the breed not only of Partridges but of other birds in the savage state  Aristotle adds dly That the female Partridge divides her eggs into two hatches one of which she entrusts to the male until the young are educated  Hist Anim  lib vi  This is absolutely incompatible with the propensity to break the eggs which he supposes to be implanted in the male But if we would reconcile Aristotle with himself and with truth we may say that as the female does not lay all her eggs in the same spot since she cannot retain them but allows them sometimes to drop wherever she happens to sit and as the male seems in this species or at least in some  families of this species as in the gray sort to share in the education of the young it is not improbable but he also participates in the drudgery of incubation and may cover a part of the eggs which were not under the hen  Aristotle says dly That the males tread one another and even their young as soon as they are able to walk  Lib ix  and this assertion has been considered as fabulous and absurd I have however more than once had occasion to mention undoubted instances of this perversion of instinct and among the Partridges nature is so purient that the male cannot hear the cry of the female without shedding  semen  and so intoxicated is he with pleasure in the season of love that though commonly extremely shy he ventures then to alight on the birdcatcher How much more therefore would their ardour be exalted in the warm climate of Greece and when they had long been denied the company of their mates as during the time of incubation  Aristotle asserts thly That female Partridges conceive and produce eggs when they happen to be fanned by wind from the males or when these fly over them or even when they hear their notes  Lib v  These words of the Grecian philosopher have given occasion to much ridicule as if a current of air impregnated with the foecundating particles of the male or the mere vibration  impressed by his voice were really sufficient to impregnate the female All that is insinuated is that in such circumstances the natural fire of their constitution blazes with new force and for the same reason weltering in the dust forwards the laying  Aristotle adds a fact which evinces their salacious temperament  they also lay  zephyrian  or addle eggs if the genital parts be stroked by the finger    From these facts it is easy to conceive that the Hen Partridge though strongly set on covering will sometimes prefer the indulgence of appetite to the tedious duty of incubation It may even happen that when she perceives her mate wavering in his fidelity and about to yield to the allurements of other females she will offer the embrace to secure the domestic harmony and provide for the prosperity of the expected progeny  Often the female rises from her nest when she perceives her mate attending to a sauntering female and throwing herself into his embrace satiates his appetite  Arist lib ix  So that lust overcomes even the attachment to their brood  Lib x    Aelian has said that the males fight always with greater obstinacy in presence of the females because he adds when thus circumstanced they will rather die than shew cowardice or appear after being vanquished  Hist Anim lib iv  We must here too distinguish between the fact and the intention It is certain that the sight of the females adds fuel to their quarrels not however because it  piques their honour but because it inflames their appetite for enjoyment  It is thus by distinguishing between actions and intentions and rejecting crude suppositions which disfigure important facts that we can often extract the truth from relations of animals which have so much been deformed by the fictions of man and the folly of ascribing to all other beings his own character his own feelings and his own apprehensions  As the  Bartavelles  possess many properties in common with the Gray Partridges we need only remark the chief differences Belon who had visited their native climate tells us that they are double the size of our Partridges that they are very plentiful and even more common than any other bird in Greece in the Archipelago islands and particularly on the coasts of the island of Crete now Candia that they call in the love season uttering a sound like that of the word  chacabis  whence the Latins have undoubtedly formed the term  cacabare  to denote that cry and the same analogy might perhaps have had some share in the construction of the  cubeth    cubata    cubeji  c the names of the Red Partridge in the eastern languages  Belon relates also that the  Bartavelles  generally lodge in rocks but that they come down into the plains to build their nest in order that their young may procure food with ease that they lay from eight to sixteen eggs of the size of small  hen eggs white and sprinkled with reddish points and the yolk of which cannot be made hard Lastly what he imagines shews the Greek Partridge to be of a different kind from our Red Partridge is this that in Italy where both are known they have each a distinct name the Grecian sort being called  Cothurno  and the other  Perdice  as if the vulgar who bestow names could not be mistaken or even apply two different denominations to the same species He conjectures also and not without probability that it is this large Partridge which according to Aristotle crosses with the ordinary hen and breeds prolific hybrids a circumstance which as the Greek philosopher remarks rarely happens and never but between the most salacious kinds  De Generatione Animalium  lib ii  It bears still another analogy to the common hen that it sits on other eggs when robbed of its ownThis observation is very ancient for it occurs in scripture  As the Partridge gathereth the young which she has not brought forth so he that getteth riches and not by right shall leave them in the middle of his days and in the end be a fool    Aristotle observes that the male Partridges sing or cry chiefly in the love season when they fight with each other or even before they begin to quarrel  Lib iv  The ardour which they have for the female is then converted into mutual rage  Hence those contests and those screams that intoxication and that heedless security which precipitates them not only into snares but into the very hands of the fowler  Lib ix    Fowlers have profited by their ardent headlong disposition to draw them into the snare a female is presented to their burning appetites or a male has been exposed to provoke their imprudent rage  Lib iv  The males have even been trained to fight by way of entertainment and these birds commonly so peaceable and so timid have contended with obstinate fury and the combat has been inflamed by the sight of the females  Aelian  de Nat Anim  lib iv  This custom is still very common in the island of Cyprus  Hist de Chypre  par Francois Stephano Lusignano  and we have already observed that the Emperor Alexander Severus took great delight in this sort of battles  Specific character of the Greek Partridge  Tetrao

might be hatched should totally ruin the crops And  N  o  THE GUERNSEY PARTRIDGE  these eggs prepared with different sauces serve several days to subsist the islanders  Tournefort    The Red Partridges settle in mountains which abound with heath and bushes and sometimes in the same mountains which are inhabited by the game improperly termed  White Partridges  yet they prefer the lower and more hospitable tracts  Stumpsius  apud Gesn  In winter they confine the range of their excursions and lodge under the shelter of rocks with a southern aspect During the rest of the year they continue in the bushes and the sportsmen can hardly drive them from their retreats I am well informed that they can better than the common Partridge support the rigours of winter and are much more easily caught by gins or snares They resort every spring in nearly the same numbers to their favourite haunts They feed on grain herbs slugs caterpillars ants' eggs and other insects but their flesh is often tainted with the smell of their aliments Aelian relates that the Partridge of Cyrrha a maritime town in Phocis had a disagreeable taste because of their living on garlick  They fly heavily and laboriously like the gray sort and without seeing them we may easily distinguish them by the noise merely which they make with their wings when they are flushed When they are surprised on the mountains they seek shelter among the precipices and  when they are dislodged they regain the summit In the plains they shoot swiftly forward When they are hotly pursued they fly into the woods and perch upon the trees and sometimes even burrow in the ground which the Gray Partridge never does  The Red Partridges are distinguished from the Gray also by their natural habits and dispositions they are not so social they form themselves indeed into coveys but the union is not so complete or harmonious Though hatched and bred together the Red Partridges keep apart from each other they do not spring at the same instant they do not fly in the same direction and they do not call each other with the same eagerness except in the love season and then even each pair forms a separate union Lastly When their passion is gratified and the female begins coolly to cover her eggs the male abandons to her the charge of raising the family In this respect our Red Partridges seem to differ from those of Egypt since the priests chose as the emblem of domestic harmony a pair of Partridges a male and a female occupied each apart with its hatch  Aldrovandus    A consequence of the savage disposition of the Red Partridge is that they are more difficult to breed in parks like the pheasant though the method is nearly the same It requires more pains and attention to habituate  them to their captivity nor are they ever completely reconciled since the young Partridges languish in their prison and though every expedient be tried to sweeten their condition would pine away or fall into some disorder if not set at liberty as soon as their feathers begin to shade their heads  These facts which have been communicated to me by M Le Roi seem to contradict what is related of the Partridges of Asia  In the country round Trebizond I saw a man leading above four thousand Partridges He marched on the ground while the Partridges followed him in the air till he reached a certain camp three days journey from Trebizond When he slept all the Partridges alighted to repose around him and he could take as many as he pleased of their number  ODORICUS de ForoJulü  apud Gesn  and some islands in the Archipelago  There are people on the coast of Vessa and Elata in the isle of Scios who raise Partridges with care They lead them to feed in the fields like flocks of sheep each family entrusts its Partridges to the common keeper who brings them back in the evening and he calls them together by means of a whistle even in the daytime  TOURNEFORT'S Voyage to the Levant  and even those of Provence  I have seen a man in Provence who led flocks of Partridges into the fields and assembled them whenever he chose he took them with his hand put them into his bosom and then dismissed them Id ibid  where numerous flocks have been seen that obeyed the voice of their conductor with wonderful docility Porphyry mentions a tame Partridge brought from Carthage which ran to call his master fawned on him and expressed its  fondness by certain articulations which seemed to flow from sentiment and were entirely different from its ordinary notes Mundella and Gesner raised some themselves that grew very familiar It appears from several passages in ancient authors that they had even acquired the art of teaching them to sing or at least to improve their natural notes so much as to give a pleasing sort of warble  AthenaeusPlutarchAelian    But all this may be reconciled by saying that this bird has not so great aversion to man as abhorrence of slavery that he has discovered the way to tame and subdue the most savage animal that is one the most enamoured of liberty and that the method is to treat it according to its instinct and to indulge it with as much freedom as possible In this light the society of the tame Partridge with the person who directs its will is the most engaging and the most noble founded not on its wants its interests or on a stupid serenity of temper but bound by sympathy choice and a mutual affection The Partridge contracts a liking for man and submits to his inclinations only when he allows it to leave him at pleasure and imposes no restraint beyond what society requires In a word when he attempts to reduce it to domestic slavery its generous nature revolts at the appearance of force the loss of liberty preys upon its vitals and extinguishes  the most powerful instincts those of love and of selfpreservation Sometimes in the paroxysms of its rage it dashes its head against the cage and expires It discovers an invincible repugnance to propagation and if sometimes stimulated by the ardour of temper and the warmth of the season it copulates in confinement its embraces are too feeble to perpetuate a race of slaves  The Red Partridge is not found in England but in France it is the most common of the genus  The WHITE RED PARTRIDGE  In the species of the Red Partridge as in the Gray the plumage is sometimes white which change of colour is the accidental effect of some particular cause Nor is this whiteness intimate the colour of the head is not altered and the bill and legs remain red and as they commonly breed with the Red Partridges we have reason to conclude that they belong to the same species  The FRANCOLIN  Tetrao Francolinus  Linn and Gmel  Perdix Francolinus  Lath Ind  Tetrao Orientalis  Hesselq  The Francoline Partridge  Lath Syn  This name too has been bestowed on very different birds We have already seen it applied to the  Attagas  and from a passage of Gesner the bird known at Venice by the name of  Francolin  appears to be a kind of Hazel Grous  It is the same with the hazelhen of the Germans which I discovered beyond all doubt from a figure of the Venetian Francolin sent to me by the learned physician Aloysius Mundella  GESNER    The Neapolitan Francolin is larger than a common hen and indeed the length of its legs bill and neck will not allow us to regard it as either an Hazel Grous or a Francolin  Ibid    All that we know of the Francolin of Ferrara is that it has red feet and lives on fish  Ibid  The bird of Spitzbergen which has been called Francolin receives also the appellation of the  Beach Runner  because it never strays far from the shore where it picks up gray worms and shrimps for its subsistence it is no larger than a lark  Voyages de Prevôt  tome xv  The Francolin which Olina figures and describes is the one of which I am to treat That of Edwards differs from it in some respects  and appears to be exactly the same bird with the Francolin of Tournefort which also resembles that of Ferrara since it is found on the seacoast and in marshy situations  Ours seems to differ from these three last and even from that of Brisson not only in the colour of its plumage and even of its bill but by the size and form of its tail which is longer in Brisson's figure more spread in ours and hanging in those of Edwards and Olina But notwithstanding this I believe that the Francolin of Olina that of Tournefort that of Edwards that of Brisson and my own are all of the same species since they have many common properties and their small differences are not sufficient to constitute different races but may be referred to the age the sex the climate and other local or accidental circumstances  The Francolin is undoubtedly in many respects like the Partridges and for this reason Olina Linnaeus and Brisson have ranged it with them For my own part I am convinced from a close examination and comparison of these two birds that they ought to be separated for the Francolin differs from the Partridge not only in the colours of its plumage its general shape the figure of its tail and its cry but is distinguished also by a spur on each leg  That of Olina had none but it was probably a female  whereas the male Partridge has only a callous tubercule  The Francolin is also much less diffused than the Partridge it can hardly subsist but in the warm climates Spain Italy and Sicily are almost the only countries of Europe where it is found it inhabits also Rhodes  Olina  the Isle of Cyprus  Tournefort  Samos  Edwards  Barbary especially in the vicinity of Tunis  Olina  Egypt the coasts of Asia  Tournefort  and Bengal  Edwards  In all these places both Francolins and Partridges occur but they have each their appropriated name and form distinct species  As these birds are very rare in Europe and their flesh is excellent food the killing them has been forbidden in many countries under severe penalties and hence it is said they derive the name  Francolin  because they enjoy a sort of freedom under the protection of these prohibitions  Little more can be said of this bird than what the figure suggests its plumage is very beautiful it has a conspicuous collar of an orange colour It is rather larger than the Common Partridge the female is smaller than the male the colours of its plumage fainter and less variegated  These birds feed on grain and they may be bred in aviaries though care must be taken to give each a small separate crib where it may  squat and conceal itself and to strew sand and a little gravel on the floor  Their cry is a kind of loud whistle audible at a great distance  Olina    Francolins live much in the same manner as Partridges  Ibid  their flesh is exquisite and sometimes preferred to that of Partridges or Pheasants  Linnaeus takes the Damascus Partridge of Willughby for the Francolin  Tenth edition of the  Systema Naturae  But we may observe st That this Damascus Partridge is rather Belon's who first took notice of it and whom Willughby only copied dly This bird differs from the Francolin both in the size which is inferior to that of the Common Partridge according to Belon and in its plumage as will easily be perceived by comparing the figures and besides its legs are feathered which prevented Belon from classing it with the plovers Linnaeus should also have admitted the Francolin of Tournefort as the same with that of Olina which Willughby mentions Lastly the Swedish naturalist is mistaken in fixing exclusively on the East as the climate of the Francolin for as I have already observed it is found in Sicily Italy Spain and Barbary and in many other countries to which the epithet of oriental cannot be applied  Aristotle ranges the  Attagen  which Belon conceives to be the Francolin among the pulverulent and granivorous birds Belon makes him also say that it lays a great number of eggs though no mention of this sort is made in the place quoted but it is the necessary consequence of Aristotle's theory with regard to pulverulent granivorous birds Belon relates on the authority of the ancients that the Francolin was common in the plain of Marathon being fond of marshy situations which agrees very well with Tournefort's observations respecting the Francolins at Samos  Specific character of the  Tetrao Francolinus    Its belly and throat are black its tail wedgesnaped  DOUBLE SPUR  Le BisErgot  Buff  Tetrao Bicalcaratus  Linn  Perdix Bicalcaratus  Lath Ind  Perdix Senegalensis  Briss  The Senegal Partridge  Lath Syn  The first species which seems to approach to the Francolin is the bird to which in the  Planches Enluminées  we have given the name of  Senegal Partridge  It has on each foot two spurs or rather tubercles of hard callous  flesh and as it is a distinct species we may call it  Double Spur  on account of that singular character I place it next the Francolins as being more related to them than to the Partridge by its size by the length of its bill and wings and by its spurs  Specific character  Its legs are double spurred its eyebrows black  The BARENECKED AND AFRICAN RED PARTRIDGE  Tetrao Nudicollis  Gmel  Perdix Nudicollis  Lath  This bird which we have seen alive at Paris at the house of the late Marquis de Montmirail had the lower part of the neck and throat divested of feathers and merely covered with a red skin the rest of the plumage was much less variegated and less pleasant than that of the Francolin It resembles that species by its red legs and the spreading shape of its tail and is related to the preceding species by the double spur on each leg  The want of facts prevents me from inquiring into the analogy between these two species in respect to their dispositions and habits M Aublet assures me that it is a bird which never perches  The AFRICAN RED PARTRIDGE has more red than our species because of a broad spot of that colour under its throat but the rest of its plumage is much inferior It is distinguished from the two preceding by two very obvious characters its spurs are long and pointed and its tail more expanded than is common in Partridges We have not observations sufficient to enable us to judge whether they differ also in their modes of living  Specific character  Its legs are double spurred and rufous its throat naked and rufous  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE PARTRIDGE  I  THE RED PARTRIDGE OF BARBARY Pl LXX of Edwards  Tetrao Rufus  Var Gmel  Perdix Rubra Barbarica  Briss  seems to be a different kind from the European Red Partridge and is smaller than the Gray Its bill its orbits and its feet are red as in the Greek Partridge but the scapular feathers are of a fine blue edged with brownred and round the neck is a sort of collar formed by white spots scattered on a brown ground which joined to its diminutive size distinguishes this species from the two breeds of Red Partridges common in Europe  II The ROCK PARTRIDGE OR GAMBRA PARTRIDGE  Tetrao Petrosus  Gmel  Perdix Petrosa  Lath Ind  The Rufousbreasted Partridge  Lath Syn  This bird takes its name from its favourite haunts it delights as do the Red Partridges in rocks and precipices its predominant colour is a dull brown and it is marked on the breast with a spot like the colour of Spanish tobacco It also resembles the Red Partridge in the colour of its legs its bill and its orbits it is smaller than our sort and cocks its tail when it runs but is like them very fleet its shape on the whole is the same and its flesh excellent  Journal de Stibbs  PREVÔST    Specific character of the  Tetrao Petrosus    Its bill and legs are red its body dusky with a ferruginous spot on its breast  III The PEARLED CHINESE PARTRIDGE  Tetrao Perlatus  Gmel  Perdix Sinensis  Briss  This Partridge known only by Brisson's description seems to be peculiar to the eastern extremity of the Antient Continent It is somewhat larger than the Red Partridge of Europe but has its shape the figure of its tail the shortness of its wings and the same general appearance Of the Common Red Partridge it has the white throat and of the African sort the long pointed spurs but it has not like that bird the red bill and legs these are here of a rustcolour and the bill is blackish as well as the nails The ground of the plumage is dusky enlivened on the breast and sides by a number of small round lightcoloured spots from this property I have applied the name of  Pearled Partridge  It has besides four remarkable bars which rise from the bottom of the bill and stretch over the sides of the head these bars are alternately of a bright and deep colour  Specific character of the  Tetrao Perlatus    Its legs and eyebrows are rufous its bill blackish its throat white its body dusky and variegated  IV The NEW ENGLAND PARTRIDGE  Tetrao Marilandus  Linn and Gmel  Perdix Marilanda  Lath Ind  Perdix Novae Angliae  Briss  The American Partridge  Du Pratz  The Maryland Partridge  Penn and Lath  I refer this American bird and the following to the Partridges not that I imagine them to be real Partridges but only the representatives for of the birds in the New World they approach the nearest to the Partridge though it is impossible that this species could wing its course over the immense oceans which separate the continents  This bird is smaller than the common Gray Partridge its iris is yellow its bill black its throat white and two bars of the same colour stretch from the base of the bill to the back of the head passing over the eyes It has also some white spots on the top of the neck the underside of the body is yellowish striped with black and the upper side of a brown bordering on rufous nearly as in the Red Partridge and checquered with black its tail is short as in the other Partridges It is found not only in New England but in Jamaica though these two climates differ widely  Albin fed one a considerable time with wheat and hempseed  Specific character of the  Tetrao Marilandus    Its eyebrows are white its neck dotted with black and white  The American Partridges are about onehalf larger than the English Quails and are plump and welltasted They are frequent in North America as high as Canada They lay from twenty to twentyfive eggs and breed about the beginning of May their numerous covies make a loud noise when sprung The cock perches on a fence and emits his double note while the hen is sitting These birds have been introduced into Jamaicae where they are naturalized and said to breed twice ayear  THE QUAIL  In Greek  in Latin  Coturnix  in Italian  Quaglia  in Spanish  Cuaderviz  in German  Wachtel  Frisch asserts that in the time of Charlemagne it was called  Quacara  some others have termed it  Currelius  on account of its swift running    La Caille  Buff  TetraoCoturnix  Linn and Gmel  Perdix Coturnix  Lath Ind  Coturnix  All the Naturalists  THEOPHRASTUS discerned such intimate relation between the Partridge and the Quail that he bestowed on the latter the name of  Dwarf Partridge  The same appearance of analogy must have led the Protuguese to call the Partridge  Codornix  and the Italians apply the term  Coturnice  to the  Bartavelle  or Greek Partridge These birds indeed resemble each other considerably they are both pulverulent they have short wings and tail and run very swiftly their bill is like that of the gallinaceous tribe their plumage is gray speckled with brown and sometimes entirely white  Aristotle  de Coloribus  chap vi  Besides they feed copulate build their nest hatch their eggs and raise their young nearly in the same way both are of a falacious disposition and the males quarrel much with each other  N  o  THE QUAIL  But how numerous soever be the points of resemblance they are balanced by an almost equal number of disparities which make the Quails a species entirely distinct from the Partridges For The Quails are universally smaller than the Partridges comparing corresponding breeds They have not the bare space between the eyes as in the Partridges nor the figure of the horseshoe impressed on the breast of the males nor have true Quails the bill and legs ever red The eggs are smaller and of an entirely different colour Their notes also are quite different though they love in nearly the same season but the Partridges intimate their rage before they fight while the Quails scream only in the midst of their quarrels  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib viii  The flesh of the latter is of a different taste and much more loaded with fat The period of their life is much shorter They are less cunning than the Partridge and much more easily ensnared especially when young and unexperienced Their dispositions are not so gentle it is extremely rare to see them tamed and though confined from their infancy they can hardly be trained to obey the voice They are not of such a social temper for they seldom form themselves into coveys except when their wants unite the feeble family to their mother or some common and powerful cause urges at once the whole species  to assemble together and traverse the extent of the ocean holding their course to the same distant land But this forced association subsists no longer than necessity requires and after they have alighted and find in their adopted country that they can live at will their union dissolves The appetite of love is the only tie that binds them together and even this connection is unstable and momentary for though the male seeks the female with the greatest ardour he discovers no choice or predilection the matches are formed hastily and as quickly broken As soon as passion has spent its force the male treats his mate with indifference and cruelty and abandons her to the labour and care of raising the family The young are hardly grown up when they separate or if they are kept together they fight obstinately with each other their quarrels are terminated only by their mutual destruction  The ancients were well acquainted with this fact for they said that obstinate quarrelsome children were like Quails in a cage  ARISTOPHANES    The propensity of the Quails to migrate at certain seasons is one of their most powerful instincts  The cause of this desire must be very general for it acts not only on the whole species but also on individuals kept in confinement and debarred from communication with their kind Some young Quails bred in cages from their  earliest infancy which had never enjoyed liberty and therefore could not feel its loss were yet observed for the space of four years to shew a degree of restlessness and to flutter with unusual agitations regularly at the season of migration which returns twice annually in April and in September This uneasiness lasted thirty days each time and began constantly an hour before sunrise The prisoners moved backward and forward from one end of the cage to the other and darted against the net which covered it and often with such violence that they dropped down stunned by the blow They passed the night in these fruitless struggles and the following day they appeared dejected exhausted and torpid We know also that in the state of liberty Quails sleep the greater part of the day and if to this we add that they are seldom observed to arrive in the daytime we may infer that they perform their journies by night  Belon and Pliny express the same opinion  and that the disposition to migrate is innate whether that avoiding the extremes of heat and cold they remove to the north in summer and advance to the south in winter or what is more probable that they direct their course to those countries where the harvest is making and thus change their abode to procure the proper subsistence for themselves and for their young  This last reason I say is the most probable for on the one hand it is proved by experience that Quails can well support cold since Horrebow informs us that they have been found in Iceland and they have been kept for years together in a room without fire and having even a northern aspect and yet seemed not in the least affected by the severest winters On the other hand it appears that one circumstance which determines them to abide in a country is the plenty of herbage for it is well known by sportsmen that when the spring is dry and consequently grass scarce there are few Quails the rest of the year Besides the spur of actual want is a more powerful cause is more consistent with the limited instinct of these animals and implies less foresight which philosophers have rather been too liberal in bestowing on brutes When they cannot procure subsistence in one country it is very natural to suppose that they will seek it in another This scarcity of food intimates to them their situation and rouses all their faculties into action They leave the exhausted tract rise into the regions of air and push forward to discover countries which may present them with abundance Habit joining itself to the instinct common to all animals but most remarkable in the winged tribes of scenting their food from a  distance gives birth to a disposition which is as it were innate it is not therefore surprising that the same Quails should return annually to the same haunts But we can hardly suppose with Aristotle that it is from an attentive observation of the seasons and that they change their climate twice ayear like the ancient kings of Persia It will be still more difficult to admit with Catesby and Belon and some others that when they shift their residence they wing their course without interruption to the Antipodes there to find exactly the same latitude and to enjoy the same temperature which would imply scientific knowledge or rather error to which brute instinct is much less subject than cultivated reason  But whatever speculations we may form with respect to the migration of the Quails certain it is that when they enjoy their natural liberty they depart and return at stated times They left Greece according to Aristotle in the month  Boedromion  Hist Anim lib viii  which comprehended the end of August and the beginning of September In Silesia they arrive in the month of May and depart about the end of August  Schwenckfeld  Our sportsmen reckon on their return to France about the tenth or twelfth of May Aloysius Mundella says that they begin to appear in the neighbourhood of Venice about the middle of  April Olina fixes the time of their arrival in the  Campagna di Roma  in the beginning of April But almost all agree that they depart after the first autumnal frost which spoils the grass and destroys the insects and since the colds of May do not drive them back to the south we are furnished with another proof that warmth is not what they seek but that their real object is food and of which the spring frosts cannot deprive them We must not however consider these terms as invariably fixed They will vary within certain limits in different countries according to the nature of the climate and even in the same region they will be affected by the lateness or earliness of the season which will advance or retard the harvest and will promote or check the multiplication of the insects which support the Quails  Both the ancients and the moderns have been busy in forming theories with regard to the migration of the Quail and other birds of passage some have heightened it by the addition of the marvellous while others struck with the difficulty of conceiving that so small a bird and which flies tardily and laboriously could perform distant journies have hesitated to admit the fact and have had recourse to hypotheses still more extraordinary to account for their regular disappearance at certain stated seasons None of the ancients ever entertained indeed the slightest doubt on the subject and yet they  well knew that the Quail is inactive flies little and with reluctance  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib viii  and that though extremely ardent in its passions it employs not its wings to transport itself to the invitation of the female but often travels more than a quarter of a league through the closest herbage to meet her and never rises into the air except when closely pursued by dogs or hunters with all these circumstances the ancients were acquainted but they never dreamt that on the approach of the cold season these birds crept into holes to remain in a dormant state during the winter like the dormice the hedgehogs the marmots the bats c This absurdity was reserved for some moderns who certainly did not know that the internal heat of animals subject to become torpid being generally inferior to that of other quadrupeds and still more to that of birds requires a constant accession of warmth from the air as I have shewn in another work when this source fails the vital action is suspended and if they were exposed to a greater cold they would in a short time perish But this certainly is not applicable to the Quails which are generally esteemed of a hotter constitution than the other birds so that in France it has given rise to a proverb  It is a common saying  Chaud comme un Caille  warm as a Quail  and in China it is customary to carry this bird alive in one's hands to keep them  warm  Osborn's Travels  Besides I have discovered from observations continued for several years that they never grow torpid though shut during the whole winter in rooms without a fire and exposed to the north as I have formerly mentioned and many persons of the most undoubted veracity who had similar opportunities have assured me of the same fact But if the Quails neither conceal themselves nor remain torpid through the winter and always disappear in that season we may certainly conclude that they migrate into other countriesAnd this fact is demonstrated by a great number of other authorities  Belon happening in autumn to be on board a vessel in his passage from Rhodes to Alexandria saw Quails flying from the north towards the south Many of them were caught by the mariners and grains of wheat were found very entire in their craw The preceding spring the same observer saw in sailing from the island of Zante to the Morea a great number of them in motion from south to north and he affirms that in Europe as well as Asia Quails are generally migrating birds  The Commander Godeheu constantly saw them passing Malta in the month of May aided by certain winds and again in September in their return  Memoires de Mathematique and de Physique presentes a l'Academie Royal des Sciences par divers Savans c tome iii  Many sportsmen have assured me  that they have often in the fine nights during spring heard them arrive and could easily distinguish their cry though at a great height in the air Add to this that they are no where so plenty as on the French coasts opposite to Africa or Asia and in the interjacent islands Almost all those of the Archipelago and even the shelves are according to Tournefort covered with them in certain times of the year and more than one of those islands has been named  Ortygia  From  which signifies a Quail The two Delos were according to Phanodemus in Athenaeus termed  Ortygiae  so also another little island opposite to Syracuse and even the city of Ephesus according to Stephanus of Byzantium and Eustathius  In the age of Varro it was remarked that at the seasons of the arrival and departure of the Quails immense flocks were seen in the islets of Pontia Pandataria and others scattered along the southern coast of Italy  De Re Rustica lib iii  and which they probably chose for a station to recruit About the beginning of autumn such great numbers were caught in the island of Caprea in the entrance of the Gulph of Naples that the bishop of the island drew his principal revenue from the profits of the game and was for that reason called  The Bishop of Quails  Many too are caught in the neighbourhood of Pesaro which is situated on the Adriatic Gulf about the end of autumn the season of their arrival  Aloysius Mundella  apud Gesnerum  Lastly such amazing numbers drop  on the western coasts of the kingdom of Naples in the vicinity of  Nettuno  that in the extent of four or five miles sometimes a hundred thousand are taken in a day and are sold for fifteen  jules  the hundred less than seven shillings to a sort of brokers who carry them to Rome where they are much less common  Gesner and Aldrovandus This capture is so lucrative that land near the place is extravagantly high priced  Clouds of them also alight in the spring on the coasts of Provence especially on the lands belonging to the bishop of Frejus which border on the sea they are exhausted it is said with the fatigue of their journey that for the first days they may be caught with the hand  But it will still be replied how can a bird so small so weak whose flight is so slow and laborious how can it though urged by hunger traverse the great extent of sea I may admit that many islands are scattered at intervals in their passage on which they may halt to recruit their vigour such as Minorca Corsica Sardinia Sicily Malta Rhodes and other isles in the Archipelago But still I conceive that it would be impossible for them to perform the journey without assistance Aristotle was well convinced that this was necessary and was even acquainted with the kind of aid which the Quails most commonly received and if he was mistaken it is only in describing the manner  When the north wind blows  the Quails says he perform their journey with ease but when the south wind prevails as it oppresses them with the load of its vapours they make a painful progress and declare their labour and exertion by the cries which they utter in their flight  Lib viii    In fact it is the wind I conceive which assists the Quails in their passage not indeed the north wind alone but a favourable wind nor does the south impede their progress but so far as it is contrary to the direction of their motion and this must take place in all countries where the Quails perform their journies across the seas  Pliny expresses the same idea  lib x    M Godeheu has well remarked that in the spring the Quails never alight on Malta except when they are carried by a northwest wind which hinders them from gaining Provence and that in their return they are wafted to that island by the south wind which opposes their descent on the Barbary shore  Memoires presentés a l'Acad c tome iii  We know also that the Author of nature employed that mean as the most conformable to the general laws which he had established to shower the immense multitudes of Quails upon the Israelites in the desert  Psalm lxxvii  and this wind which came from the southwest swept over Egypt Ethiopia and the coasts of the Red Sea and in a word the  countries where these birds were most abundant  The Gulf of Arabia abounds very much with Quails  JOSEPHUS lib iii    Sailors whom I have consulted on this subject inform me that when the Quails are surprised in their passage by a contrary wind they alight on the nearest vessels as Pliny has remarked  They arrive not without danger to navigators who have approached near the land for they alight on the sails and this always at night and sink the vessels  PLINY  Hist Nat  lib x  and often fall into the sea and are then observed to float and struggle on the waves with one wing raised in the air to catch the gale Hence some naturalists have taken occasion to say that when they embark on their voyage they furnish themselves with a little stick with which they relieve themselves at intervals from the fatigue of flying resting upon it as upon a raft and riding on the rolling billows  See  Aldrovandus tome ii  It has even been supposed that each carries in his bill three small stones to ballast them according to Pliny  Lib x  against the violence of the wind or according to Oppian  In Ixeut  to discover  Pliny lib x  and  Solinus cap xvii  by dropping them one after another when they have crossed the sea This is nothing more than bits of gravel which the Quails like other granivorous birds swallow with their food In general such a degree of design sagacity and discernment is ascribed to them as would  give room to doubt if those who are so liberal in bestowing these qualities really possess a large share themselves They have remarked that other migratory birds as the Land Rail accompany the Quails and that the Falcon was sure to catch some one on its arrival hence they have concluded that the Quails choose out from another species a guide or chief which they call  The King of the Quails ortygrometra  for as the foremost of the body falls a victim to the hawk the Quails shrewdly contrive to cast the danger upon the fated individual of a foreign race  But the Quails do not all migrate there are a few which being unable to follow the rest remain behind either having received a wound in their wings or being the product of the second hatch they are too young and feeble to perform the journey These stragglers seek to find a proper situation in the country where they are obliged to abide  Aldrovandus lib viii  In France the number of these is very inconsiderable but the Author of the British Zoology assures us that in England a part only of the Quails are observed to quit the island entirely while those which remain shift their quarters removing from the interior counties to the sea coast and particularly to the hundreds of Essex where they continue through the winter if the frost or snow drive  them from the stubble fields or marshes they retreat to the beach and subsist upon the marine plants which they can pick up between high and low water mark The same Author subjoins that the time of their appearance in Essex corresponds exactly to that of their leaving the inland country It is likewise said that a great number of them remain in Spain and in the south of Italy when the winter is not so severe as entirely to destroy the seeds and insects that serve for their food  With respect to such as venture to cross the seas those only perform a fortunate voyage that are assisted by a fair wind and if in the preceding season it has seldom blown from a favourable quarter much fewer arrive in the countries where they spend their summer And in general we may judge with tolerable accuracy of the place whence they have come by the direction of the breeze which wafts them along  As soon as the Quails arrive they set about laying They do not pair as I have already remarked and if the number of males as I am informed exceeds much that of the females monogamy would have been inconvenient Fidelity confidence personal attachment qualities so desirable in the individual would have been hurtful in the species The multitude of males reduced to a state of celibacy would disturb the marriages that are formed and render them unprolific  But in the present case the unbounded liberty of union blunts and extinguishes the jealousy and the rivalship of their loves The male has been observed to repeat a dozen times aday his embraces with several females indiscriminately  Aldrovandus and Schwenckfeld  and while nature tolerates this kind of libertinism she provides for the multiplication of the species Each female drops fifteen or twenty eggs into a nest which she hollows in the ground with her claws lines with grass and leaves and conceals as much as possible from the piercing eye of the hawks These eggs are greyish speckled with brown She sits about three weeks The ardor of the males effectually fecundates them and they are seldom found addle  The Authors of the British Zoology say that in England the Quails seldom lay more than six or seven eggs If this fact be uniform we may conclude that they are less prolific in that island than in France Italy c and it remains to be inquired whether this diminution of the genial powers ought to be attributed to the cold or some other quality of the climate  The young Quails are able to run almost as soon as they leave the shell like the young Partridges but they are in many respects more hardy since in the state of liberty they quit their mother much earlier and even venture to depend  on themselves for subsistence eight days after they are hatched This circumstance has made some persons suppose that the Quail lays twice a year  Aldrovandus asserts that the Quails begin to lay the same year they are hatched in the month of August and have ten eggs  but I much doubt it except they have been disturbed in their first hatch It is not even affirmed that they begin another after they have arrived in Africa in the month of September though this would be much more probable since on account of their regular migrations they are unacquainted with autumn and winter and the year to them consists of two springs and two summers and they change their climate it might seem to enjoy and perpetuate the ever verdant season of love and propagation  Certain it is that they drop their feathers twice a year in the end of winter and on the approach of autumn Each moulting lasts a month and as soon as their plumage is restored they wing their passage if at liberty into other climes and if they are kept in confinement they discover a restlessness and struggle to burst from their prison at the stated periods of migration  When the young are four months old they are able to accompany their parents in their distant flight  The female differs from the male in being somewhat larger according to Aldrovandus  others reckon it equal and others smaller in having a white breast sprinkled with black spots almost round while in the male it is reddish without any intermixture of other colours its bill is also black as well as its throat and a few hairs that grow round the base of the upper mandible  AldrovandusSome naturalists have taken the male for the  emale I have on this occasion followed the opinion of sportsmen  specially those of observation  its testicles have also been remarked to be very large in proportion to the size of the body but this observation has undoubtedly been made in the season of their amours when the testicles of all birds acquire a considerable increase of dimensions  The male and female have each two cries a louder and a fainter The male makes a sound like  ouan    ouan    ouan    ouan  he never gives the sonorous call except when parted from the females nor when confined though he has a female companion The female has a wellknown cry which invites the male and though it is very weak and audible only a short way the males flock to it from the distance of half a league it has also a slender quivering note  cri    cri  The male is more ardent than the female as he runs to her amorous murmurs with such precipitation and inconsiderateness as to  light to her upon the hand of the birdcatcher  Aristotle lib viii    The Quail like the Partridge and many other animals never multiplies its kind except when it enjoys the liberty of nature In vain have the forlorn prisoners been furnished with the materials for constructing their nests the tenderest concerns are stifled in their breast and their eggs are allowed to drop unheeded  Many foolish stories have been told with respect to the generation of Quails It has been said that like the Partridges they are impregnated by the wind this means no more than that they sometimes lay without the male influence  Ibidem  It has been alleged that they are bred from the tunnies which the troubled ocean sometimes casts on the shores of Lybia that they appear at first like worms then assume the form of flies and gradually growing larger they become grasshoppers and at last Quails  Gesner  that is the vulgar seeing the Quails searching among the carcases of the tunnies rejected by the waves for some insects that are hatched in them and having some vague idea of the metamorphoses which insects undergo fancied that a grasshopper could be transformed into a Quail as a worm is changed into a fly Lastly it has been said that the male copulates with the female toad  Phanodemus  apud Gesnerum  a story which has not even the slightest appearance of probability  The Quails feed on wheat millet hempseed green herbage insects and all sorts of seed even that of the hellebore which gave the antients an antipathy to its flesh augmented still further by the reflection that these were the only animals besides man that are subject to the epilepsy  Pliny lib x  But experience has destroyed this prejudice  In Holland where these birds are frequent especially along the coasts it is usual to call the berries of Bryony Quailberries which shews that they prefer that sort of food  Hadrian Jun  Nomenclat    It would appear that they can subsist without drink for sportsmen have assured me that they are never observed to seek water and others that they have fed them a whole year on dry grain without any drink though they frequently drank when it was in their power To withdraw every kind of drink is even the only way to cure them when they  cast out their water  that is when they are attacked by a certain distemper in which they have always a drop at the point of their bill  Some have imagined that they always trouble the water before they drink and they have not failed to ascribe it to envy for naturalists are never satisfied till they assign to brutes the motives of action They inhabit the fields the pasture grounds and the vineyards but seldom  resort to the woods and never perch upon trees They grow much fatter than Partridges What is supposed to contribute to this is their remaining still during the greatest part of the heat of the day then they conceal themselves in the tallest grass and sometimes continue in the same spot for the space of four hours lying on their side with their legs extended and so much are they overcome with the drowsy indolence that a dog must absolutely run upon them before they are flushed  It is said that they live only four or five years and Olina attributes the shortness of the term to their disposition to corpulency Artemidorus imputes it to their unhappy quarrelsome temper and such is really their character for they have been made to fight in public to entertain the rabble Solon even directed that such combats should be exhibited to the youth with the view to inflame their courage And this species of gymnastic exercise which would appear to us so puerile must have been held in high estimation by the Romans and considered as an affair of the state since we are told that Augustus punished a prefect of Egypt with death for buying and bringing to table one of these birds that had acquired celebrity by its victories Even at present this sort of amusement is common in some cities of Italy They give two Quails high feeding and then place them opposite to each  other at the ends of a long table and throw between them a few grains of millet seed for they need a ground of quarrel At first they shew a threatening aspect and then rush on like lightning strike with their bills erecting the head and rising upon their spurs and fight till one yields the field of battle  Aldrovandus  Formerly these combats were performed between a Quail and a man the Quail was put into a large box and set in the middle of a circle traced on the floor the man struck it on the head with one finger or plucked some feathers from it if the Quail in defending itself did not pass the limits of the circle its master gained the wager but if in its fury it transgressed the bounds its worthy antagonist was declared victor and such Quails as often won the prize sold very dear  Julius Pollux  de Ludis  lib ix  It may be remarked that these birds as well as the Partridges and others never fight but with their own species which implies jealousy rather than courage or even violence of temper  Since the Quail is accustomed to migrate and travels to immense distances by the aid of the wind it is easy to conceive that it must be spread through a wide extent It is found at the Cape of Good Hope and through the whole inhabited part of Africa  Kolben and  Josephus lib iii  Comestor c  in Spain Italy  Aldrovandus  France Switzerland  Stumpsius  the Netherlands  Aldrovandus  Germany  Frisch    England  British Zoology

Tartary in the suite or by the order of the Emperor of China  Hist Gen des Voyages  tome vii p and  as far as China  Edward's Gleanings vol i  The Chinese says he have also our common Quail as evidently appears from their paintings in which it is depicted from nature  It is even possible that it could migrate into America since it every year penetrates near the polar circles where the two continents approach and in fact it occurs in the Malouine islands as we shall afterwards take notice In general it is more common along the coasts than in the interior country  The Quail is therefore an universal inhabitant and is every where esteemed excellent game Aldrovandus tells us that the fat is sometimes melted by itself and kept for sauce  The female or a call imitative of her cry is made use of to draw the males into the snares It is even said that a mirror having a noose placed before it is sufficient the bird mistaking its image for another of the species rushes towards it The Chinese catch them as they fly with slender nets which they use very dextrously  Gemelli Carreri  In general all the forms of gins that are used for other birds succeed with the Quails  and especially the males which are less suspicious more ardent and which may be led at pleasure by imitating the cry of the female  This ardor of the Quails has occasioned the quality to be ascribed to their eggs fat c of restoring a relaxed frame and rousing the genial powers  The eggs of the Quail rubbed on the testicles procure pleasure and if swallowed they stimulate lust  KIRANIDES  It has been said that the presence alone of one of these birds in a bedchamber gave those who slept there love dreams  Frisch  We need only quote these stories as they refute themselves  Specific character of the Quail  Tetrao Ceturnix    Its body is spotted with gray its eyebrows white the margin of its tailquills with a crescent ferruginous  The Quail occurs in every part of Great Britain but is not frequent  The CHROKIEL OR THE GREAT POLISH QUAIL  Tetrao Coturnix  Var Gmel  Coturnix Major  Briss  Our knowledge of this Quail is drawn from the Jesuit Rzaczynski a Polish author who merits the more attention on this subject as he  describes a bird which is a native of his own country In its shape and even its habits it exactly resembles the Common Quail and differs only by its size and for this reason I consider it as merely a variety  Jobson says that the Quails of Gambra are as large as Woodcocks  Purchas's Collection of Voyages vol ii  and if the climate were not widely different I should consider them as the same with the Polish sort  The WHITE QUAIL  Tetrao Coturnix  Var Gmel  Aristotle is the only naturalist who mentions this Quail  De Colonibus  cap  which must be viewed as a variety just as the grayishwhite and whitered partridges are varieties of these two species of the partridge and the white lark a variety of the common lark c  Martin Cramer speaks of Quails  De Polonia  lib i  with greenish legs is this a variety of the species or merely adventitious in the individual  The QUAIL OF THE MALOUINE ISLANDS  Tetrao Falklandicus  Gmel  We may consider this bird as a variety of the common sort which is diffused through Africa and Europe or at least a proximate species the only difference being that its plumage is of a deeper brown and its bill somewhat stronger  But what opposes this idea is the immense expanse of ocean which separates the two continents towards the south our Quails must have performed an astonishing voyage if we suppose they held their course from the north of Europe to the Straits of Magellan I will not therefore decide whether this Quail is the same species with ours or only a branch from the same stem or if not rather a breed peculiar to the Malouine Islands  Specific character of the  Tetrao Falklandicus    It is variegated with dusky curved streaks and spots below white its bill lead coloured its feet dusky its temples spotted with white  The RUFF OR CHINESE QUAIL  Tetrao Chinensis  Linn and Gmel  Coturnix Philippensis  Briss  This bird is figured in the  Planches Enluminées  by the name of the  Quail of the Philippines  because it was sent from these islands to the Royal Cabinet But it is also found in China and I have called it the  Ruff  on account of a sort of white ruff under its neck which is the more remarkable as its plumage is of a brown verging upon black Edwards gives a figure of the male Pl CCXLVII it differs from the female in our  Planches Enluminées  in being somewhat larger though still not bigger than a lark its aspect is also more marked the colour of its plumage more lively and variegated and its feet strongerThe subject which is described by Edwards was brought alive from Nankin to England  These little Quails have this character in common with the ordinary sorts that they fight obstinately with each other particularly the males and the Chinese lay considerable bets as customary in England on game cocks We cannot therefore hesitate to admit that they are of the same genus with our Quails though probably of a different species  The TURNIX OR MADAGASCAR QUAIL  Tetrao Striatus  Gmel  We have given this Quail the name  Turnix  contracted for  Coturnix  to distinguish it from the ordinary kind from which it differs in many respects For st it is smaller dly its plumage is different both in the colours and their distribution and dly it has three foretoes on each foot like the bustards and none behind  Specific character of the  Tetrao Striatus    Its legs tawny its eyebrows white its bill its throat the lower part of its breast and its belly black with white drops  The NOISY QUAIL  RéveilMatin  i e Morning WakerSee  Bontius's "Natural and Medical History of the EastIndies"  ou  La Caille de Java  Buff  Tetrao Suscitator  Gmel  Coturnix Javensis  Briss  This bird is not much larger than our Quail resembles it exactly in the colours of its plumage and pipes at intervals but it is distinguished by many notable differences  Its note is very deep and very strong and pretty much like the sort of lowing of the bittern ingulphing its bill in the marshes  The Hollanders call this lowing  Pittoor  according to Bontius    Its disposition is so gentle that it can be tamed to the same degree as our domestic fowls  It is remarkably affected by cold it ceases to pipe and its active powers are suspended in the absence of the sun As soon as he has descended into the west it retires into some hole and spends the night enveloped in its wings but when the star of day again beams upon the earth it rises from its lethargy and celebrates his return with joyous notes that awaken the whole house  Bontius says that he kept one in a cage for the express purpose of rouzing him in the morning in fact their first calls announce always the rising of the sun  Also when kept in a cage if it has not the sun constantly or if the cage is not covered with a coat of sand upon linen cloth to retain the heat it will pine away and soon die  Its instinct is different for according to Bontius's account it is very social and goes in companies Bontius adds that he found it in the forests on the island of Java but our Quails live solitary and are never found in the woods  Its bill is somewhat longer  This species has however one point of analogy to our Quail and to many others to wit the males fight each other with excessive rancour and desist not till one is killedBut this circumstance is not a sufficient foundation for arranging it with these and I have therefore bestowed on it a distinct name  Specific character of the  Tetrao Suscitator    It is variegated with yellowish rufous black and gray its bill longer  OTHER BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE PARTRIDGES AND THE QUAILS  I The COLINS  THE Colins are Mexican birds which have rather been mentioned than described by Fernandez  Historia Avium Novae Hispaniae  cap xxiv xxv xxxix lxxxv and cxxxiv  and those who have copied that author on this subject have committed some mistakes which it will be proper to correct  First Nieremberg  Joan Euseb Nirembergi Historia Naturae maxime Peregrinae  lib x cap lxxii p  who professes to take his accounts entirely from others and who in this place borrows from Fernandez takes no notice of the  Cacacolin  of chap cxxxiv though that bird is of the same species with the Colins  Secondly Fernandez speaks of two  Acolins  or WaterQuails in chap x and cxxxi Nieremberg mentions the former and very improperly after the Colins since it is a waterbird as well as the one of chap cxxxi which he totally omits  Thirdly He takes notice of the  Occolin  of chap lxxxv of Fernandez which is a Mexican Partridge and consequently nearly related to the Colins which are also Partridges as we shall see  Fourthly Ray still copying Nieremberg on the subject of the  Coyolcozque  varies the expression and in my opinion alters the meaning of the passage for Nieremberg says that this Coyolcozque is like the Quails so called by us  Spaniards  which are certainly the Colins and concludes with telling that this is a species of the Spanish Partridge But Ray makes him say that it is like the European Quails and suppresses the words  est enim species perdicis Hispanicae  i e  For it is a species of Spanish Partridge  yet these last words are essential and contain the real notion of Fernandez with regard to the species to which these birds must be referred since in chap xxxix which is occupied entirely on the Colins he says that the Spaniards call them  Quails  because they resemble the European Quails though they certainly belong to the genus of Partridges It is true that he repeats in the same chapter that all the Colins are referred to the Quails but in spite of this confusion it is easy to see that when the author bestows on the Colins the name of  Quails  he speaks after the vulgar who are guided in applying epithets by the general appearances and that his more accurate  opinion was that they are species of the Partridge I should therefore have had reason from the authority of Fernandez the only observer who has had an opportunity of viewing these birds to place the Colins next the Partridges but I have rather chosen to yield as much as possible to the common opinion which is not altogether groundless of ranging them after the Quails as being related to both these kinds of birds  According to Fernandez the Colins are very common in New Spain their music resembles much that of our Quails their flesh is excellent and proper even for sick people when kept some days They feed on grain and are commonly kept in a cage which would make one believe that they are different from our Quails and even our PartridgesWe shall in the following articles take notice of their several kinds  II The ZONECOLIN  Fernandez chap xxxix    Tetrao Cristatus  Linn and Gmel  Coturnix Mexicana Cristata  Briss  The Crested Quail  Lath  This word shortened for the Mexican  Quanhizonecolin  denotes a bird of a moderate size whose  plumage is of a dusky colour it is distinguished by its cry which though rather plaintive is agreeable and by the crest which decorates its head  Fernandez mentions in the same chapter another Colin of the same plumage but not so large and without the crest this is perhaps the female of the preceding from which it is distinguished only by accidental characters that are liable to vary in the different sexes  Specific character of the  Tetrao Cristatus    Its pendulous crest and its throat are fulvous  III The GREAT COLIN  Fernandez chap xxxix    Tetrao Novae Hispaniae  Gmel  Coturnix Major Mexicana  Briss  The Mexican Quail  Lath  This is the largest of all the Colins Fernandez does not give us its name he only says that its predominant colour is fulvous that its head is variegated with white and black and that there is also white on the back and on the tips of the wings which must make a fine contrast with the black colour of its legs and bill  IV The CACOLIN  Species of what is called the Quail  Fernandez  chap cxxxiv    This bird is called the  Cacolin  by Fernandez and is according to him a species of Quail that is of the Colin of the same size shape and even cry feeding on the same substances and having its plumage painted with almost the same colours with those of the Mexican Quails Neither Nieremberg Ray nor Brisson takes any notice of it  V The COYOLCOS  Tetrao Coyolcos  Gmel  Coturnix Mexicana  Briss  The Lesser Mexican Quail  Lath  I have softened the Mexican word  Coyolcozque  into this name This bird in its cry its size its habits its manner of living and of flying resembles the other Colins but differs from them in its plumage Fulvous mixed with white is  the prevailing colour of the upper side of the body and fulvous alone that of the under side and of the legs the top of the head is black and white and two bars of the same colour descend from the eyes upon the neck it inhabits the cultivated fieldsSuch is what Fernandez relates and Brisson must have read the account with little attention or rather copied Ray when he tells us that the Coyolcos is like our Quail in its cry flight c while Fernandez expressly says that it is analogous to the Quails so called by the vulgar that is to the Colins and is really a species of the Partridges  It is a species of the Spanish Partridge  Hist Anim Novae Hispaniae    Specific character of the  Tetrao Coyolcos  Its feet are fulvous its top and its neck are striped with black and white its body is fulvous above variegated with white  VI The COLENICULI  Tetrao Mexicanus  Linn and Gmel  Coturnix Ludoviciana  Briss  Attagen Americanus  Frisch  The Louisiana Quail  Lath  Frisch gives Pl CXIII the figure of a bird which he calls  The Small Hen of the forests of America  and which according to him resembles  the Wood Grous in its bill legs and general form its legs however are not feathered nor are its toes edged with indentings nor its eyes decorated with red orbits as we may see from the figure Brisson who conceives this bird to be the same with the  Colenicuiltic  of Fernandez has ranged it among the Quails by the name of  Louisiana Quail  and gives a figure of it But comparing the figures or the descriptions of Brisson Frisch and Fernandez I find greater differences than could occur in the same bird for not to mention the colours of the plumage so difficult to paint in description and still less the attitude which is but too arbitrary I observe that the bill and the legs are large and yellowish according to Frisch red and moderate sized according to Brisson and that the legs are blue according to Fernandez  But if I attend to the different lights in which naturalists have viewed it the embarrassment will be increased for Frisch fancied that it was a Hen of the Wood Brisson a Quail and Fernandez a Partridge That this was the opinion of the last manifestly appears for though he says in the beginning of chap xxv that it is a Quail he evidently conforms to the common language since he concludes the chapter with saying that the  Colenicuiltic  in its bulk in its cry in its habits and in every other particular is analogous to the bird of chap xxiv but that bird is the Coyolcozque a kind of Colin and Fernandez  as we have already seen ranks the Colins among the Partridges  I would not insist on this matter were it not to avoid as much as possible the great inconvenience attending on nomenclature Each author fond of building a system is not satisfiled till he assign to every object however anomalous its place and thus according to the different views that arise the same animal may be classed with  genera  widely distinctSuch is the present case  To returnThe Colenicui is of the bulk of our Quail according to Brisson but its wings seem to be longer its body is brown above and dirtygray and black beneath it has a white throat and a sort of white eyebrows  Specific character of the  Tetrao Mexicanus    Its legs and bill are bloodcoloured the line on its eyebrows white  VII The OCOCOLIN OR MOUNTAIN PARTRIDGE OF MEXICO  This species which Seba took for the crested Roller of Mexico is still farther removed from the Quail and even the Partridge than the preceding It is much larger and its flesh is not inferior  to that of the Quail though much inferior to that of the Partridge The Ococolin resembles somewhat the Red Partridge in the colour of its plumage of its bill and of its feet its body has a mixture of brown light gray and fulvous the lowerpart of its wings is of an ashcolour the upperpart is mottled with dull white and fulvous spots as likewise the head and neck It thrives best in countries that are temperate and rather chilly and cannot subsist or propagate in the hot climatesFernandez speaks also of another Ococolin but which is a bird entirely of a different kind  Ococolin a kind of Woodpecker with a long sharp bill  It lives in the forests of Telzcocan where it breeds it does not chirp    The PIGEON DOMESTICA  Columba  Linn and Gmel  IT was easy to domesticate the heavy and inactive birds such as the common hen the turkey and the peacock but to tame those which are nimble and shoot on rapid wings required attention and art A low hut rudely constructed on a confined spot is sufficient for lodging and raising our poultry to induce the Pigeons to settle we must erect a lofty building well covered without and fitted up with numerous cells They really are not domestics like dogs or horses or prisoners like the fowls they are rather voluntary captives transient guests who continue to reside in the dwelling assigned them only because they like it and are pleased with a situation which affords them abundance of food and all the conveniencies and comforts of life On the slightest disappointment or disgust they abandon their mansion and disperse and some of them even will always prefer the mouldering holes of ancient walls to the neatest apartments in Pigeonhouses others take their abode in the clefts and hollows of trees others seem to fly the habitations of men and cannot be prevailed to enter their precincts others again never  roam from human dwellings but must be fed near their volery to which they are inflexibly attached These various and even opposite habits shew that under the Pigeon are included many different species This opinion is confirmed by the modern nomenclators who besides a great number of varieties reckon five species of Pigeons without including the Ringdove and Turtle We shall remove these two last species from those of the Pigeon and consider each separately  The five species of Pigeons noticed by our nomenclators are The Domestic Pigeon The Roman Pigeon which includes sixteen varieties The Brown Pigeon The Rock Pigeon with one variety The Wild Pigeon but these five species are in my opinion the same My reason is this The Domestic Pigeon and the Roman Pigeon with all their varieties though differing in size and colours are certainly the same species since they breed together and their progeny are capable of procreating We cannot consider the great and little Domestic Pigeons as two different species we can only say that they are different branches of the same kind the one of which has been reduced to a more perfect domestication than the other In the same manner the Brown Pigeon the Rock Pigeon and the Wild Pigeon are three nominal species which may be comprised in one which is the Brown Pigeon and of which the Rock Pigeon and the Wild Pigeon are only minute varieties  since the nomenclators themselves admit that these three are nearly of the same size that they migrate perch and have all the same instincts differing only in their shades of colour  Thus the five nominal species are comprised under two viz the Brown Pigeon and the Common Pigeon and in these no real difference exists except that the first is wild and the second domestic I consider the Brown Pigeon as the parent of all the rest and from which they differ more or less according as they have been handled by men Though I cannot prove it I am confident that the Stock Pigeon and the Common Pigeon would breed together if they were paired for the difference is not so great between our little Domestic Pigeon and the Stock Pigeon as between it and the large roughfooted or Roman Pigeon with which however it breeds Besides in this species we can trace all the gradations between the wild and the domestic state as they occur in succession in the order of genealogy or rather of degeneracy The Stock Pigeon is imitated in a way that cannot be misunderstood by those deserters which leave our pigeonhouses they perch on trees which is the first and strongest shade in their return to the state of nature these Pigeons though bred domestics and apparently reconciled like the rest to a fixed abode and to common habits abandon their dwelling renounce society and seek a settlement in the woods and thus impelled by instinct  alone they resume their native manners Others seemingly less courageous and less intrepid but equally fond of liberty fly from our pigeonhouses and seek a solitary lodgment in the holes of old walls or forming a small body they haunt some unfrequented towers and in spite of the hardships to which their situation exposes them and the multiplied dangers that assail them from all sides they still prefer these uncomfortable dwellings to the convenience and plenty of their former mansion this is the second gradation to the state of nature The Wall Pigeons do not completely adopt their native habits and do not perch like the former yet they enjoy a much larger share of freedom than those which remain in the domestic condition The third gradation is the inhabitants of our pigeonhouses which never leave their dwelling but to settle in one more comfortable and which roam abroad only to seek amusement or to procure subsistence And as even among these there are some deserters it would seem that the traces of their primaeval instincts are not entirely effaced The fourth and fifth gradations have totally changed their nature Their tribes varieties and intermixtures are innumerable being completely domestic from the earliest ages and man while he has improved their external forms has changed their internal qualities and extinguished in them every sentiment of freedom These birds are for the most part larger and more beautiful than  the Common Pigeons are more prolific fatter and finer flavoured and on all these accounts more pains have been bestowed upon them They are inactive helpless creatures that require the constant attention of man and the most cruel hunger cannot in them call forth those little arts in which animals are usually so prompt They are therefore completely domesticated and entirely dependent on man who has degraded them from their original condition  If we suppose that after our dovecots were stocked we selected those of the young which were most remarkable for their beauty and raised them apart with greater care and attention and still continued to choose the most gaudy of their descendants we should at last obtain those painted varieties which at present exist To give a complete history of these would therefore be to detail the effects of art rather than to describe the productions of nature For this reason we shall content ourselves with the bare enumeration of them  The BISET or WILD PIGEON  ColumbaLivia  Gesner Gmel and Briss  Le Biset  Buff  Columba Saxatilis  Aldrov  Columba Fera Saxatilis  Schwenckfeld  The Biset Pigeon  Lath  is the primitive stock whence all the others are descended It is commonly of the same size and shape with the  Domestic Pigeon but of a browner colour It varies however both in its bulk and plumage for the one which is figured by Frisch under the name of  Columba Agrestis  is the same bird with a white shade and its head and tail reddish and what the same author has termed  Vinago    five Columba Montana  is still the Wild Pigeon only its plumage borders on a dark blue What Albin describes by the term  ringdove  which is not applicable to it must be considered as still the same bird and likewise what Belon calls the  Deserter Pigeon  which is more proper We may suppose that this variety has arisen from those individuals which desert our pigeonhouses and relapse into the state of nature for the dark blue Wild Pigeons nestle not only in the clefts of trees but in the holes of ruins and precipices which they find in the forests Hence some naturalists have called them  Rock Pigeons  and others because they are fond of elevated tracts have named them  Mountain Pigeons  We may also observe that this is the only species of the Wild Pigeon with which the ancients seem to have been acquainted and which they called  or  Vinago  and that they never mention our brown sort which is however the only Pigeon really wild and never reduced to that state of domestication My opinion on this subject derives additional force from this fact that in all countries where there are Domestic  Pigeons the  Oenas  is found from Sweden  Caerulean Dove with a shining neck and a double blackish spot on the wings  LINN  Fauna Suecica  No  to the torrid zone  Wild and tame Pigeons are found every where in Persia but the wild ones are much the most numerous and as Pigeon's dung is the best for melons a great many Pigeons are carefully bred throughout the kingdom and no country in the world has I suppose more beautiful pigeonhouses Above pigeonhouses are computed in the neighbourhood of Ispahan it is a pleasure to see people take Pigeons in the field by means of Pigeons tamed and trained for the purpose which they make to fly in flocks the whole day beside the Wild Pigeons these are thus mingled in the flock and led to the pigeonhouse  Voyage de  CHARDIN tom ii p and  TAVERNIER tom ii p and  The Pigeons of the island Rodrigue are rather smaller than ours all of them slate coloured and constantly very fat and excellent they perch and nestle on the trees and are very easily caught  Voyage de  LEGUAT tom i p  but the Brown Pigeon never occurs except in cold regions and continues only during the summer in our temperate climates They arrive in flocks in Burgundy Champagne and other northern provinces in France about the end of February and the beginning of March they settle in the woods and nestle in the hollow trees laying two or three eggs in the spring and probably making a second hatch in summer they raise only two young at a time and leave the country in November and direct their course towards the south traversing Spain to pass the winter probably in Africa  The Biset or Wild Pigeon and the Oenas or Deserter Pigeon which returns into the wild state perch and by this circumstance they are  distinguished from the Wall Pigeons which also forsake their houses but seem afraid to penetrate into the forests After these three Pigeons the two last of which approach more or less to the state of nature we shall range the Common Pigeon  In Greek  in Latin  Columba  in Italian  Colombo  or  Colomba  in Spanish  Colont  or  Paloma  in German  Taube  or  Tauben  in Saxony  Duve  in Swedish  Duwa  and in Polish  Golab  which as we have observed is only half domestic and still retains the original instinct of flying in flocks If it has lost that native courage which is founded on the feeling of independence it has acquired more of the agreeable and useful qualities It often hatches thrice ayear and if still more domesticated even ten or twelve times whereas the Brown Pigeons breeds only once or at most twice annually They lay at intervals of two days almost always two eggs and seldom three and never raise more than two young which are commonly a male and female Many and these are of the younger sort lay only once ayear and the spring hatch is always the most numerous The best pigeonhouses are those built facing the east on some rising ground several hundred paces distant from the farmyard where the inhabitants can enjoy quiet have the advantage of an extensive prospect and receive the cheering influence of the morning sun I have frequently seen Pigeons flying from the vallies before sunrise  alight to bask on a pigeonhouse that was seated on a hill and drive away or even dispossess the lodgers and this happens oftenest in spring and autumn I shall add another remark that lofty and solitary pigeonhouses are the most productive From one of mine I had usually pairs of young Pigeons while I got only or from others that were situated feet lower The only danger is lest the rapacious birds that hover about the elevated tracts disturb the Pigeons and check their breeding for they cannot much diminish their numbers as they prey on those only which stray from the flock  After the Common Pigeon which is half domestic we shall place those varieties to the production of which man has so much contributed but the number is so immense that it would exceed the limits of our work to describe each particularly and we shall therefore be contented with a general survey  The curious in this line apply the name of Biset to all Pigeons that live in the fields or are bred in large pigeonhouses and call those  domestic  which are lodged in small pigeonhouses or voleries and do not venture to roam abroad They are of different sizes for instance the tumbler and wheeler Pigeons which are the least of all the volery Pigeons and smaller than the Common Pigeon They are more agile and nimble and when they breed with the common sort they lose their distinctive qualities It  would seem that their peculiar constrained motions are owing to the slavery to which they are reduced  The pure breeds that is the principal varieties of the Domestic Pigeons from which all the secondary ones can be derived are The Pouter Pigeons  Les grosses gorges  i e the thick throats  which are so called on account of their power of inflating their craw in respiration The Proud Pigeons  Les Pigeons mondains  which are noted for their prolific quality such as the Roman Pigeons the roughfooted Pigeons and the Jacobine Pigeons The Shaker  Les Pigeons paons  i e the Peacock Pigeons  Pigeons which display their broad tail like the turkey and peacock The Turbet Pigeon  Le Pigeon cravate  on  à gorge frisée  i e the cravated or frizlednecked  The Shell Pigeon of Holland  Le Pigeon coquille Hollandois  The Swallow Pigeon  Le Pigeonhirondelle  The Carmelite Pigeon  Le Pigeon carme  The Dashed Pigeon  Le Pigeon heurté  The Swiss Pigeons  Les Pigeons Suisses  The Tumbler Pigeon  Le Pigeon culbutant  The Wheeler Pigeon  Le Pigeon tournant    The breed of the Pouter Pigeon consists of the following varieties  The Winesop Pouter Pigeon in which the males are extremely beautiful being decorated  N  o  THE POUTER PIGEON  N  o  THE POUTER PIGEON  with plumage of a varied intermixture of hues but the females are destitute of such ornament  The Painted Chamois Pouter Pigeon the female has not that rich assemblage of colours To this variety we ought to refer the Pigeon pl cxlvi of Frisch and which the Germans call  Kropftaube  i e  The crop or craw Pigeon  or  Kroüper  and to which that author has applied the epithet  Strumous Pigeon  or  Pigeon with the inflated oesophagus  The Pouter Pigeon white as a Swan  The White Pouter Pigeon roughfooted with long wings which cross over the tail and of which the ball of the neck appears very loose  The variegated gray and soft gray Pouter Pigeon whose colour is delicate and spread uniformly over the whole body  The Pouter Pigeon of iron gray and barred and striped gray  The Gray Pouter Pigeon spangled with silver  The Hyacinth Pouter Pigeon of a blue colour interwoven with white  The Firecoloured Pouter Pigeon each of its feathers is marked with a blue and red bar and terminates in a black bar  The Hazelcoloured Pouter Pigeon  The Chesnutcoloured Pouter Pigeon whose tailquills are all white  The Dark Pouter Pigeon of a fine velvet black with ten wingquills white as in the Chesnut Pouter Pigeon Both have the bib or kerchief under the neck white and the females are like the males Of all the Pouter Pigeons of a pure breed that is which have an uniform plumage the ten quills are all white as far as the middle of the wing and this may be regarded as a general character  The Slaty Pouter Pigeon which has the undersurface of the wings white and a white cravat the female is like the maleThese are the principal breeds of the Pouter Pigeons but there are others of inferior beauty such as the red the olive the sable c  All Pigeons have more or less the power of inflating their craw by inspiring air and the same effect may be produced by blowing into the gullet But this breed of Pouter Pigeons possesses the property in so superior a degree as can result only from some peculiar conformation of its organs The craw almost as large as the rest of the body and kept constantly inflated obliges them to draw back their head and prevents them from looking forward and thus while they swell with conceit the falcon seizes them unawares Hence they are raised more for curiosity than utility  Another breed is the Proud Pigeons they are the most common and at the same time the most esteemed on account of their prolific quality  The Proud Pigeon is nearly one half larger than the Biset and the female pretty much resembles the male They breed almost every month in the year provided that only a small number are put into the same volery and to each there be allowed three or four baskets or rather holes formed into pretty deep casements with shelves to prevent them from seeing one another while sitting for each Pigeon not only defends its own hole and fights the others that come near it but contends for the possession of the next row For example eight pairs are sufficient to stock a space eight feet square and people who have bred them affirm that six pair would be equally productive The more their number be increased in a given space the more there will be of brawling and fighting and of broken eggs In this breed there are often impotent males and barren females which never lay  They are fit to breed in the eighth or ninth month but do not attain maturity till three years old Their prolific powers are vigorous for six or seven years after which the number of eggs they lay diminishes gradually though there are instances of their breeding at the age of twelve They lay their two eggs sometimes in the space of twentyfour hours and during winter in that of two days so that the interval varies according to the season The female keeps her first egg warm without covering it assiduously nor does she begin to sit closely till after  the second is laid The period of incubation is commonly eighteen days sometimes only seventeen especially in summer and nineteen or twenty in winter The attachment of the female to her eggs is so ardent and steady that she will forego every comfort and submit to the most cruel hardships rather than forsake them A Hen Pigeon whose toes froze and dropt off persisted to sit till her young were hatched her toes were frostbitten because her hole chanced to be close to the window of the dovecot  While the female is employed in hatching the male places himself in the next hole and the moment she is compelled by hunger to leave her eggs and go to the trough he observes her feeble murmur of intimation takes her place covers the eggs and sits two or three hours This incubation of the male is commonly repeated twice in the course of the twentyfour hours  The varieties of the Proud Pigeon may be reduced to three with respect to size which have all the common character of a red filet round the eyes  Those heavy birds that are nearly as large as small pullets their bulk alone recommends them for they are not good breeders  The  Bagadais  are large Proud Pigeons with a tubercle over the bill in the form of a small morel  Morel  is a little red mushroom  and a broad red ribbon round the  eyes that is a second eyelid fleshy and reddish which even falls upon the eyes when they are old and prevents them from seeingThese Pigeons are not productive  The  Bagadais  have a curved and hooked bill and exhibit many varieties white black red tawny c  The Spanish Pigeon which is as large as a hen and exceedingly beautiful It differs from the  Bagadais  in not having the  morel  above its bill and its second fleshy eyelid being less protuberant and its bill straight instead of curved It crosses with the  Bagadais  and produces a very thick and large breed  The Turkish Pigeon which like the  Bagadais  has a thick excrescence above the bill with a red bar extending from the bill round the eyes This bird is very thick crested low legged with a broad body and wings some are of a tawny colour or a brown bordering on black such as represented in Pl CXLIX of Frisch others are of an irongray lintgray chamois and winesop These Pigeons are very inactive and never roam from their volery  The Roman Pigeons which are not quite so large as the Turkish but have the same extent of wings but no crest they are black tawny or spotted  These are the largest of the Domestic Pigeons there are some of a middle size and others  smaller Among the roughlegged Pigeons which are feathered as low as the nails we may distinguish the one without a crest figured by Frisch Pl CXLV under the name  trummel taube  i e  The Drum Pigeon  The Latin and French signify the same  in the German  Columba typanisans  in the Latin and  Pigeontambou  in the French also the crested roughlegged Pigeon which the same Author has designed in Pl CXLIV by the name of  Montaube  i e  The Month Pigeon  in German and in Latin by the epithets  Columba menstrua    seu cristata pedibus plumosis  i e  The Month Pigeon or the crested with feathery feet  The roughlegged DrumPigeon is also termed the  Glouglou Pigeon  because it continually repeats that sound and its voice at a distance resembles the beat of a drum The crested roughlegged Pigeon is also called the  Month Pigeon  because it hatches every month and does not wait till its young are able to provide for themselves Its breed is very profitable though we must not reckon upon twelve hatches annually the usual number is eight or nine which is still very great  In the intermediate and small breed of Domestic Pigeons we may distinguish the Jacobine Pigeon  Pigeon Nonain  i e The Nun Pigeon  of which there are many varieties viz the Winesop the Painted Red and the Painted Chamois but in none of the three is the female thus decorated In the Jacobine  N  o  THE JACOBINE PIGEON  N  o  THE SHAKER PIGEON  breed there is also the  Moorish Pigeon  Pigeon Maurin  which is entirely black except the head and the tips of its wings which are white to this we may refer the Pigeon of Pl CL of Frisch which he names in German  Schleyer  or  Parruquentaube  i e  The veiled  or  perruked Pigeon  and in Latin  Columbagalerita  that is Hooded Pigeon But in general all of the Jacobines are hooded or rather have a halfcowl on the head which descends along the neck and extends along the breast like a cravat of ruffled feathers this variety is nearly allied to the Pouter Pigeon for its size is the same it also somewhat inflates its craw nor is it so prolific as the other Jacobines of which the most perfect are entirely white In all of them the bill is very short the latter breed often but their young is very small  The Shaker or Peacock Pigeon is somewhat larger than the Jacobine The finest of this breed have thirtytwo feathers in the tail while the common sort have only twelve After they have raised their tail they bend it forwards and at the same time draw back the head so as to make it meet the tail They shake also during the whole of this movement either from the violent contraction of the muscles or from some other cause for there is more than one breed of Shaker Pigeons  There is a Shaker Pigeon different from the Peacock Pigeon its tail not being near so broad The Peacock Pigeon has been denominated by Willughby and Ray  Columba tremula laticauda  broadtailed Shaker Pigeon and the Shaker Pigeon  Columba tremula angusticauda seu acuticauda  narrowtailed or sharptailed Shaker Pigeon the latter though it does not raise or display its tail trembles they say almost continually  They make this display of the tail  commonly in the love season though sometimes also upon other occasions The female raises and displays her tail also like the male and is quite as beautiful some kinds are entirely white others white with the head and tail black To this second variety we must refer the Pigeon figured in Pl CLI of Frisch which he calls in German  Pfautaube  or  Hunerschwantz  i e  Peacock  or  Hentailed Pigeon  and in Latin  Columba caudata  That Author remarks at the same time that the Shaker Pigeon displays its tail and works eagerly and constantly with its head and tail nearly in the same way as the  wryneck  These Pigeons do not fly so well as the others their broad tail catches the wind and they often fall to the ground for this reason they are bred chiefly from curiosity However these Pigeons though by themselves they could perform no distant journies have been carried into remote countries in the Philippine islands says Gemelli Carreri are Pigeons that elevate and spread their tail like the peacock  The Polish Pigeons are larger than the Shaker Pigeons Their distinguishing character is a very thick and short bill their eyes bordered  N  o  THE POLISH PIGEON  with a red circle their legs very low They are of different colours many black others rufous chamois dotted with gray or entirely white  The Turbet Pigeon is one of the smallest being scarcely larger than a turtle with which it breeds The Turbet Pigeon is distinguished from the Jacobine the former not having the half cowl on the head and neck but only a tuft of feathers that appear to ruffle on the breast and under the throat These Pigeons are very handsome wellmade and have a neat air some are of the colour of winesop others chamois painted rufous gray entirely white or black and others white with black mantles The last variety is what Frisch represents in his CXLVII Plate under the German name  Mowchen  and the Latin designation  Columba collo hirsuto  Pigeon with shaggy neck  This Pigeon has an aversion to pairing with other Pigeons and is not very prolific it is besides very small and easily falls a prey to the rapacious tribes Upon all these accounts it is scarcely ever raised  The Pigeons called Dutchshell Pigeons because on the back of the head are reversed feathers forming a sort of shell are also small Their head is black the end of the tail and the tip of the wings are also black but all the rest of the body is white Some are redheaded blueheaded or the head and tail yellow  the tail is usually of the same colour with the head but the wings are always white The first variety which has a black head resembles so much the Seaswallow that some persons have applied to it that name and with the more appearance of analogy as this Pigeon has not its body round like most of the rest but long and very slender  Besides the Shell Pigeon which we have just mentioned there are other Pigeons which have the head and tail blue others where these parts are black others where they are red others where they are yellow but in all the four the extremity of the tail is of the same colour with the head They are nearly as large as the Peacock Pigeons and their plumage is very neat and singular  There are some named Swallow Pigeons that are not larger than turtles and like them are slender shaped and of very nimble flight the whole of the underside of their body is white and the upperside as well as the neck the head and the tail black or red or blue or yellow with a small casque of the same colours on the head but the underside of the head is always white and so is that of the neck To this variety we must refer the  Galeated Pigeon  of Johnston and Willughby of which the principal character is that the feathers of the head and those of the tail and the quills of the wings are always of the same colour and the body of a different colour for example the body white  N  o  THE TURBET PIGEON  and the head the tail and the wings black or of some other colour whatever it be  The Carmelite Pigeon which forms a different breed is perhaps the lowest and the smallest of all our Pigeons it appears squatted like the goatsucker it is also very roughlegged the feathers on its thighs being exceeding long and its legs remarkably short The males and females resemble each other as in most of the other breeds It includes four varieties which like those of the preceding sorts are also of an irongray chamois winesop and soft gray but in them all the underside of the body and of the wings is white all the upperside of the body being of the colours we have mentioned Their bill is smaller than that of a turtle and they have a little tuft behind the head which draws to a point as in the crested lark  The Drum Pigeon or  glouglou  of which we have spoken is also very low and roughlegged but larger than the Carmelite Pigeon and nearly of the size of the Polish Pigeon  The Dashed Pigeon which is marked by a daub as it were of a black a yellow or a red pencil above the bill only and as far as the middle of the head with the tail of the same colour and all the rest of the body white is highly valued by the curious It is not roughlegged it is of the size of the ordinary Proud Pigeons  The Swiss Pigeons are smaller than the Common Pigeons and not larger than the Bisets they even fly as nimbly There are several kinds of them viz those garnished with red with blue and with yellow on a silky white ground with a collar which forms a horseshoe on the breast and is of an embroidered red They have often two bars on the wings of the same colour with that of the horseshoe  There are other Swiss Pigeons not garnished with intermingled tints shaded over the whole body with an uniform slate colour and without any collar or horseshoe Others are called  jaspered yellow collars mailed yellow collars  and others  very mailed yellow collars  c because they have collars of that colour  There is still another variety of the Swiss Pigeons called the  Azure Pigeon  because its plumage inclines more to blue than the preceding  The Tumbler Pigeon is one of the smallest kind that which Frisch has figured Pl CXLVIII under the names  Tummeltaube    tumler    Columba gestuosa seu gesticularia  is of a rufous brown but some are gray and variegated with rufous and gray It whirls round in its flight like a body thrown in the air for this reason it has received its appellation All these motions seem to imply vertigoes which as I have observed may be ascribed to the effect of domestication It flies very  swiftly and soars higher than any but its movements are precipitate and very irregular Frisch says that its fluttering resembles in some measure the capers of a ropedancer it has been called the Harlequin Pigeon  Columba gestuosa  Its shape is pretty much like that of the Biset it is commonly employed to attract Pigeons from other dovecots because it flies higher and farther and continues longer on the wing than the rest and more easily escapes the hawk  The same may be said of the Wheeler Pigeon which Brisson has called after Willughby the  Smiter Pigeon  Columba Percussor  Will  and  Briss  it turns round in its flight and flaps so vigorously with its wings as to make as much noise as a millclapper and often in the violence of its exertions which seem to be almost convulsive it breaks some of its wingquills These Wheeler or Smiter Pigeons are commonly gray with black spots on the wings  I shall barely mention some other varieties that are uncertain or secondary noticed by the nomenclators and which belong undoubtedly to the breeds that we have described but to which from the imperfect accounts given we cannot refer them with accuracy or certainty  The Norway Pigeon mentioned by Schwenckfeld which is white as snow and which is probably a crested roughlegged Pigeon bigger than the rest  The Pigeon of Crete according to Aldrovandus or of Barbary according to Willughby  Columba Barbarica seu Numidica  Will  which has a very short bill its eyes encircled with a broad ring of naked skin and its plumage blueish and marked with two blackish spots on each wing  The frizzled Pigeon  The  Laced Pigeon  Lath  of Schwenckfeld  Columba Crispa  Schwenck  and Aldrovandus  Columba crispis pennis  Aldrov  which is entirely white and frizzled all over its body  The Carrier Pigeon of Willughby  Columba Tabellaria  Will  which is much like the Turkish Pigeon both by its plumage which is brown and by its eyes which are encircled with a naked skin and its nostrils covered with a thick membrane These Pigeons it is said were usually employed to carry letters speedily to a distance when dispatch was needed which gave occasion to the name  The Horseman Pigeon of Willughby  Columba Equis  Will  and Albin produced they say by crossing the Pouter Pigeon and the Carrier Pigeon and partaking of the qualities of both for it has the power of inflating its craw like the Pouter Pigeon and like the Carrier Pigeon its nostrils are covered with thick membranes But it is probable that any other Pigeon might be trained to carry light matters or rather to fetch them from a distance We need only separate them from  their female and carry them to the place from whence the news is to be brought and they will certainly return to their mate as soon as they are set at liberty  In the pigeonhouses of Cairo some males are separated from their females and sent into the cities from which they wish to receive news The message is written on a small bit of paper which is folded and then covered with wax this is stuck under the wing of the male Pigeon and in the morning after a hearty meal he is dismissed and proceeds straight to the dovecot where his female resides He travels farther in one day than a man on foot could in six  Pietro della Valle tom i p  At Aleppo Pigeons are employed to carry letters from Alexandretta to Aleppo which they perform in less than six hours though the distance is at least twentytwo leagues  Voyage de  THEVENOT tom ii p    These five families of Pigeons are only we see secondary varieties of the first which we have described from the observations of some curious people who have passed their lives in breeding Pigeons and particularly the Sieur Fournier who has for several years had the charge of the voleries and poultryyards of his Highness the Count of Clermont That prince who discovered an early taste for the arts directed all sorts of domestic fowls to be collected from every quarter and continually intermixed In this way from the Hen Pigeon alone an amazing variety was produced entirely new and yet bearing the impressions of their original species though all surpassing it in beauty  Tame Pigeons were known in ancient Greece for Aristotle says that they hatch ten or eleven times a year and those of Egypt twelve times  Historia Animalium  lib vi  However we may suppose that large dovecots where Pigeons breed only twice or thrice annually were not very common in the time of that philosopher He divides the genus into four species  Hist Anim  lib viii  to wit the RingPigeon the Turtle the Biset and the Common Pigeon  In the original  or    or      or    and it is the last which he mentions as breeding ten times ayear But this rapid multiplication is found only in some of those that are highly domesticated Aristotle takes no notice of the varieties of the tame Pigeons Perhaps they were then few in number but in the time of Pliny they seem to have been greatly multiplied for that naturalist mentions a large breed of Pigeons that existed in Campania and tells us that there were some curious persons who gave an extravagant price for a pair whose pedigree could be traced and that these were kept in little turrets erected on the housetops  Lib x  The purchase was made by Lucius Axius before Pompey's civil war for the sum of four hundred  denarii  about fifteen pounds sterling a price much higher than is given by birdsanciers at present  All that the ancients have said with respect to the instincts and habits of Pigeons must be applied to the domestic sort rather than to the inhabitants  of pigeonhouses which ought to be considered as an intermediaterace between the tame Pigeons and the wild partaking of the qualities of both They are all fond of society attached to their companions and faithful to their mates a neatness and still more the art of acquiring the graces bespeak the desire to please those tender caresses those gentle movements those timid kisses which grow close and rapturous in the moment of bliss that delicious moment soon renewed by the return of the same appetites and by the gradual swell of the soothing melting passion a flame always constant and ardor continually durable an undiminished vigour for enjoyment no caprice no disgust no quarrel to disturb the domestic harmony their whole time devoted to love and progeny the laborious duties mutually shared the male assisting his mate in hatching and guarding the youngIf man would copy what models for imitation  Specific character of the Common Pigeon  Columba Domestica    It is cinereous its rump white there is a stripe on its wings the tip of its tail is blackish  Linnaeus reckons up twenty varieties The Biset  Columba Livia  The RockPigeon  Columba Saxatilis  The Roman Pigeon  Columba Hispanica  The roughfooted Pigeon  Columba Dasypus  The Crested Pigeon  Columba Cristata  The Norway Pigeon  Columba Norwegica  The Barbary Pigeon  Columba Barbarica  The Jacobine  Columba Cucullata  The Frizzled Pigeon  Columba Crispa  The Turbit Pigeon  Columba Turbita  The Peacock Pigeon

Gutturosa  The Horseman Pigeon  Columba Eques  The Smiter Pigeon  Columba Percussor  The Turner Pigeon  Columba Jubata  The Spot Pigeon  Columba Maculata  Though Linnaeus reckons the Biset a variety of the  Columba Domestica  it is evidently the same with our Wood Pigeon which he denominates  Columba Oenas  and thus characterizes  Cinereous neck glossy green stripe on the wings and the tip of the tail blackish  In English it bears the name of Stock Dove being supposed to be the only original of all the domestic kinds Multitudes of Stock Doves breed in the rabbit burrows on the downs of Suffolk and the young are every year sold by the shepherds The Rock Pigeons as our Author observes are the same birds they are frequent in the South of Russia and breed in turrets and on the steep banks and rivers in winter vast numbers resort to the cliffs of the Orkneys  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE PIGEONS  FEW species are so generally spread as those of the Pigeons for having a very powerful wing and a wellsupported flight they can easily perform very distant journies Accordingly most of our wild and tame sorts occur in every climate house Pigeons are bred from Egypt to Norway and though they thrive the best in warm countries they succeed also in the cold when care is taken What proves that in general they are little affected by heat or cold is that the Wild Pigeon is almost equally diffused through the whole extent of both continents  The birds which the inhabitants of our American islands call  Wood Pigeons    Ramiers  are the real European Bisets They are migratory and never halt long in one place They follow the crops which ripen not at the same time in all the different parts of the islands They perch on the tallest trees in which they breed twice or thrice ayear It is incredible what number the sportsmen kill When they eat good grain they are very fat and as well tasted as the Pigeons of Europe but those which feed on bitter seeds such as those of the Acomas are as bitter as soot  DU TERTRE Hist Antilles tom ii    There are Pigeons on the coast of Guinea which are the most common such as our Field Pigeons and which are very good eating  BOSMAN'S  Voyage to Guinea  There are many Pigeons in the Maldive islands At Calcutta are very large Pigeons and wild Peacocks  Voyage de  Pyrard p and    The Brown Pigeon of New Spain mentioned by Fernandez under the Mexican name  Cehoilotl  Hist Nov Hisp  cap cxxxii  It is the  Columba Mexicana  of Brisson and Gmelin and the  Mexican Pigeon  of Latham  which is entirely brown excepting the breast and the tip of the wings which are white appears to be only a variety of the Biset Its eyes are encircled by a bright red skin its iris black its legs red The one mentioned by the same author under the name  Hoilotl  Ibidem  cap lvi and lx  It is the  Columba Naevia  of Gmelin the  Oenas Mexicana  of Brisson and the  Blackspotted Pigeon  of Latham  which is brown marked with black spots is probably but a variety of the preceding occasioned by difference of age or sex Another of the same country termed  Kacahoilotl  Ibidem  cap clix  The  Columba Caerulea  of Gmelin and the  Columba Caerulea Mexicana  of Brisson and the  Blue Pigeon  of Latham  which is blue in the upper parts and red on the breast and belly is perhaps only a variety of our Wild Pigeon All these seem to belong to our European Pigeon  The Pigeon described by Brisson by the name of  Violet Pigeon of Martinico  The Violetchesnut Pigeon its belly tawny its quillfeathers rufous within  BRISS  and which he figures under this same name appears to us only a very slight variety of the Common Pigeon The one which that author calls simply the  Martinico Pigeon  Pigeon duskyrufous above dilute fulvous winecoloured below the neck goldviolet black spots on either wing the lateral tail quills furnished with a black stripe white at the tips  BRISS  and which is designed in our  Planches Enluminées  under this appellation of  Rufous Cayenne Pigeon  are neither of them different from the Common Pigeon It is probable even that the latter is the female of the former and that both derive their descent from the Deserter Pigeons They are improperly called  Partridges  in Martinico where no real partridges exist but there are Pigeons that resemble partridges in colour only and differ not considerably from our European Pigeons  As the one was brought from Cayenne and the other from Martinico we may infer that they are spread through all the warm countries in the New Continent  The Pigeon described and figured by Edwards Pl CLXXVI under the name of the  Brown Indian Dove  is of the same size with the Biset and as it differs only in colour we may consider it as a variety produced by the influence of climate Its eyes are encircled by a fine blue skin devoid of feathers and frequently it raises its tail of a sudden but does not however display it like the Peacockpigeon  In like manner Catesby's  Passenger Pigeon  This is the  Columba Migratoria  of Linnaeus and the Wild Pigeon of Lawson Its specific character  Its orbits bare and bloodcoloured its breast rufous  Weight nine ounces The Passenger Pigeons breed in the northern parts of the American continent they nestle on trees and lays two eggs During incubation they live on the seeds of the redmaple and afterwards on those of the elm As soon as their provisions fail they gather in vast bodies and advance towards the fouthern provinces In hard winters the air is darkened by their flight one flock succeeds to another and this passage lasts several days When they roost in trees the branches are sometimes broken down by their weight and the ground beneath is covered to a considerable depth with their dung The Indians used to kill vast numbers and collected their fat to serve as butter In the State of New York the Passenger Pigeons are observed in their progress to the southern or western settlements about the beginning of August and in their return about the beginning of March they fly in mornings and evenings Prodigious quantities of these birds are caught in clapnets or decoyed and shot T  which Frisch terms the  American Pigeon  differs  from those which desert our pigeonhouses and relapse into the state of nature only by the colours and by the greater length of the tailfeathers which seem to indicate an analogy with the turtle but these differences are too minute to form a distinct and separate species  The same may be said of the Pigeon noticed by Ray called by the English the  ParrotPigeon  afterwards described by Brisson and which we have caused to be delineated in the  Planches Enluminées  No by the name  Green Pigeon of the Philippines  it differs from our Wild Pigeon only by the intensity of its colours which we may attribute to the effect of a hot climateIn the Royal Cabinet there is a bird termed the  Green Amboyna Pigeon  which is different from that on which Brisson bestows the same name It is figured No  Planches Enluminées  and so nearly resembles the preceding that it may be considered as a variety of  N  o  THE WHITE BELLIED PIGEON  the same resulting from a difference of age or of sex  The Green Amboyna Pigeon described by Brisson  Olivegreèn Pigeon the back chesnut the wingquills black above cinereous below their exterior margins yellow the feet naked  BRISSON  is of the size of a turtle and though different in the distribution of its colours from that to which we have appropriated that name must still be considered as but another variety of the European Pigeon It is also extremely probable that the Green Pigeon from the island of St Thomas mentioned by Marcgrave which is of the same size and shape with the European sort but differs from it as from all others by the saffron colour of its legs is also a variety only of the Wild Pigeon In general Pigeons have all red legs the difference consists entirely in the intensity or the vivacity of this colour and perhaps the yellow cast observed by Marcgrave was occasioned by some distemper or accident It is much like the Green Pigeons of Amboyna and of the Philippines as delineated in the  Planches Enluminées  Thevenot speaks of these Green Pigeons in the following terms  In India at Agra there are found Green Pigeons which differ from ours only in the colour Fowlers catch them easily with birdlime  The Jamaica Pigeon mentioned by Sir Hans Sloane  The lesser whitebellied Pigeon  SLOANE  The middle whitebellied Pigeon  BROWN  which is of a purple brown on the  body and white under the belly and nearly of the same size with our Wild Pigeon must be regarded as merely a variety of that species especially as it is not a constant inhabitant of Jamaica but only visits the island as a bird of passage  There is still another in Jamaica which must also be regarded as a variety of the Wild Pigeon it is what Sloane and after him Catesby termed the White Crowned Pigeon its size is the same it nestles and breeds also in the holes of rocks so that we can scarce doubt of its being the same species  From this enumeration it appears that the Wild Pigeon of Europe is found in Mexico Martinico Cayenne Carolina and Jamaica that is in all the warm and temperate climates of the West Indies and that it also occurs in the East from Amboyna to the Philippines  N  o  THE RINGDOVE  The RING PIGEON  In Greek  or  in Latin  Palumbes  or  Palumbus  in Italian  Colombo Torquato    Colombaccio  in Spanish  Paloma Torcatz  in German  Ringel Taube  in Swiss  Schlagtub  in Dutch  Ringduve  in Flemish  Kriessduve  and in the Brabant  Manseau  in Swedish  Ringduswa  and in the isle of Oeland  Siutut  in Danish  Ringeldue  and at Bornholm  Skude  in Polish  Grywatz    Le Ramier  Buff  Columba Palumbus  Linn and Gmel  Palumbus  Gesner and Brisson  Palumbus Torquatus  Aldrov Ray and Will  Columba Torquata  Frisch  The Ring Dove    Queest  or  Cushat  Will and Penn  AS this bird is much larger than the Biset and as both are nearly related to the Domestic Pigeon we may suppose that the small breeds of our housepigeons have proceeded from the Bisets and the large breeds from the Ring Pigeons and this conjecture is the more probable as the ancients were in the practice of rearing and fattening the Ring Pigeons  Perrottus  apud Gesnerum  The only circumstance that seems to oppose this idea is that the small domestic Pigeons cross with the large sorts while the Ring Pigeon seems not to intermix with the Biset and though they inhabit the same tracts do not mix together The turtle as it is still more easily raised and kept  in houses might equally be regarded as the source of some of our domestic breeds were it not like the Ring Pigeon of a peculiar species that intermingles not with the Wild Pigeons But though in their native forests where each can possess its proper female these birds are never observed to associate together yet when they are deprived of their liberty and have no longer the opportunity of selection the force of passion may obliterate the principle of choice and may impel them to unite with the females of their kindred species and give birth to a progeny of hybrids Nor will the offspring like the males be blasted with sterility but may like the breed between the hegoat and the sheep be capable of reproduction To judge from analogy the Pigeon tribe consists in the state of nature of three principal species as we have observed and of two that may be regarded as intermediate On these the Greeks bestowed five different names the first and largest is the  Phassa  or  Phatta  which is our Ring Pigeon the second is  Peleias  which is our Wild Pigeon the third is the  Trugon  or the Turtle the fourth which is the first of the intermediate kinds is the  Oinas  which being rather larger than the Wild Pigeon must be considered as relapsed from the state of domestication the fifth is the  Phaps  which is a Ring Pigeon smaller than the  Phassa  and for that reason called the  Lesser Pigeon  but which appears to us to be only a variety of the species of  the Ring Pigeon for it has been observed that the Ring Pigeons are of different sizes according to the nature of the climateThus all the nominal species ancient or modern may be reduced to three viz the Wild Pigeon the Ring Pigeon and the Turtle which have all perhaps contributed to the endless varieties of our domestic Pigeons  The Ring Pigeons arrive in our provinces in the spring rather earlier than the Bisets and retire in autumn somewhat later The month of August is the time in France when the young are the most numerous and it appears that they issue from the second hatch which is made towards the end of the summer for the first hatch being very early in the spring the nest is not covered with leaves and is therefore too much exposed and often destroyed Some Ring Pigeons remain in most of our provinces during winter they perch like the Bisets but do not like them construct their nests in holes of trees they place them on the tops and build them neatly with sticks the nest is flat and so wide as to admit at once both the male and female I have ascertained that very early in the spring they lay two and often three eggs for several nests have been brought to me containing two and sometimes three young ones already strong in the beginning of April  Salerne says that the poulterers of Orleans buy in the season of the nests a considerable number of Turtles which they blow with the mouth and fatten with millet so that in less than a fortnight they are fit to be carried to Paris That in the same manner they fatten the Ring Pigeons and also carry thither Bisets and other Pigeons which they call  Postes  and which are according to them Pigeons that have forsaken dovecots and roam at will nestling sometimes in one place and sometimes in another in churches in towers in the walls of old castles or in rocksThis fact proves that the Ring Pigeon like all the Pigeons and Turtles can be reared like other domestic birds and consequently that they may have given birth to the most beautiful and the largest dovecot Pigeons M Le Roy Lieutenant of the chaces and inspector of the park at Versailles assures me that the young Ring Pigeons taken from the nest tamed and fattened very well and that even the old Ring Pigeons caught by a net were easily reconciled to live in the voleries where in a very short time by blowing they grow fat  Some persons have  asserted that in our climate they breed only once ayear unless they are robbed of their eggs or young which it is well known obliges all birds to a second hatch But Frisch affirms that they lay twice ayear which seems to us very certain since the union of the male and female being constant and faithful would seem to imply that their love and the attachment for their young continues the whole year But the female lays a fortnight after the embrace of the male  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib vi  and sits only another fortnight and the same length of time would be sufficient for the young gaining strength to enable them to fly and provide for themselvesthus it is probable that she may breed twice in the course of the year first in the beginning of spring and again at the summer solstice as the ancients remarked In warm and temperate climates this  undoubtedly takes place and very probably the case is nearly the same in cold countries The Ring Pigeon has a louder sort of cooing than the Common Pigeon but is never heard except in the love season and in fine weather for when it rains these birds are silent and seldom does their song cheer the gloom of winter They live upon wild fruits acorns beechmast strawberries of which they are very fond and also beans and grain of all kinds They make great havoc among the corn when it is shed or lodged and if these sorts of food fail them they have recourse to herbage They drink like other Pigeons that is at one draught without raising their head till they have swallowed as much water as they have occasion for As their flesh especially when they are young is excellent meat their nests are much sought for and great numbers are robbed This devastation joined to their slow multiplication much reduces every where the species Many are caught indeed with nets in their route through the provinces bordering on the Pyrenees but this lasts only a few days and at one season  It appears that though the Ring Pigeons prefer the warm and temperate climates  The rocks of the two islands of Magdalena serve as a retreat to an infinite number of Ring Pigeons natives of the country and differing not from those of Europe except that they are of a more delicate and exquisite flavour  Voyage au Senegal  par M ADANSON  they  also inhabit sometimes the bleak regions of the north since Linnaeus inserts them among the birds that are natives of Sweden  Fauna Suecica  No  They would seem also to have migrated from the one continent to the other  At Guadaloupe the seeds of the logwoodtree which were ripe had attracted a prodigious number of Ring Pigeons for these birds are passionately fond of such seeds They fatten surprisingly and their flesh acquires a very agreeable odour of cloves and nutmegs When these birds are fat they are excessively lazy Several discharges of a musket will not force them to rise they only hop from branch to branch while they behold their companions drop around them  Nouveau Voyage aux iles de l'Amerique  tom v p In the Bay of All Saints there are two sorts of Ring Pigeons some of the bulk of our Ring Pigeons others smaller and of a light gray both are very good to eat and the flocks of them are so large that from the month of May to September one man may kill nine or ten dozen in a morning when the sky is cloudy and they resort to feed on the berries which grow in the forests  DAMPIER's  Voyage  for we have received from the southern parts of America as well as from the hot countries in the Old World several birds which must be considered as varieties or species closely allied to the Ring Pigeon and which we shall notice in the following article  Specific character of the Ring Pigeon  Columba Palumbus    Its tailquills are black behind its primary wingquills whitish on their margin the neck white on both sides  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE RING PIGEON  I  THE Ring Pigeon of the Moluccas mentioned under this name by Brisson  Columba Aenea  Linn  and  Gmel  Palumbus Moluccensis  Briss  The Nutmeg Pigeon  Lath  Specific character  its legs feathery its bill and legs greenish its body coppercoloured  and which we have caused to be designed  Pl Enl  No with a nutmeg in its bill because it feeds on that fruit How different soever the climate of those islands be from that of Europe the bird is so like our Ring Pigeon in size and figure that we cannot but consider it as a variety occasioned by the influence of climate  The same may be said of the bird described by Edwards under the name of the  Triangular Spotted Pigeon  Columba Guinea  Linn Gmel  and  Klein  The Turtle of the Cape of Good Hope  Sonnerat  Specific character  Its orbits naked and red its wings marked with triangular white spots its tailquills black at the tip  and which he tells us is found in the southern parts of Guinea As it is half roughlegged and nearly of the size of the European  Ring Pigeon we shall refer it to that species as a simple variety It differs indeed in its colours being marked with triangular spots on the wings having the whole of the underside of the body gray the eyes encircled with a red naked skin the iris of a fine yellow the bill blackish but all these differences of the colour of the plumage bill and eyes may be considered as variations introduced by the climate  A third variety of the Ring Pigeon which occurs in the other continent is the  Ringtailed Pigeon  mentioned by Sir Hans Sloane and Brown  Pigeon with a ringtail or marked with a dusky belt  Sloane  Greater Pigeon of a skyblack the tail striped  Brown  Columba Caribaea  Gmel  The Ringtailed Pigeon  Lath  which being nearly of the same size with the European sort may be referred to it better than to any other species It is remarkable for the black bar which crosses its blue tail for the iris which is of a more lively red than in the Ring Pigeon and for two tubercles near the base of its bill  II The FOUNINGO  Columba Madagascariensis  Linn and Gmel  Palumbus Madagascariensis  Briss  The Madagascar Pigeon  Lath  The bird called at Madagascar  Founingomenarabou  and of which we retain part of the name because it appears to be a peculiar species and which though related to the Ring Pigeon differs too much from it in size to be regarded as a simple variety  What induces us to consider the Founingo of a different species from our Ring Pigeon is that the latter occurs in the same climate  We saw says Bontekoe in the island of Mascarenas a number of Blue Ring Pigeons which allowed themselves to be caught in the hand We killed this day near two hundred We also found there a number of Ring Pigeons  Voyage aux Indes Orientales  Brisson first noticed this bird and we have caused it to be figured  Pl Enl  No under the appellation of the  Blue Ring Pigeon of Madagascar  It is much smaller than the European Ring Pigeon and nearly of the same size with another Pigeon of the same climate which appears to have been first mentioned by Bontius  Pigeon of a very green colour  and afterwards by Brisson  Columba Madagascariensis  Linn  and  Gmel  Palumbus Viridis Madagascariensis  Briss  Specific character  Its legs feathery its tail violet its body bluishblack    from an individual brought from Madagascar where it was called  Founingo Maitsou  which seems to prove that notwithstanding the difference of colour its being green instead of blue these two birds are of the same species and the only distinction subsisting between them arises from the age or sex This bird is represented  Pl Enl  No by the name of  Green Ring Pigeon of Madagascar  III The SCALLOP NECKED PIGEON  Le Ramiret  Buff  Columba Speciosa  Gmel  We have represented this bird  Pl Enl  No by the name of the  Cayenne Ring Pigeon  The species is new and has been described by no preceding naturalist It is smaller than our Ring Pigeon and different from the African  Founingo  It is one of the handsomest birds of this kind it resembles somewhat the turtle in the shape of its neck and the disposition of its colours but differs in point of size and in many other characters which denote a greater affinity to the Ring Pigeon than to any other species  IV  The Pigeon of the Nincombar or rather the Nicobar islands described and designed by Albin  Columba Nicobarica  Linn Gmel  and  Klein  Columba Nicombariensis  Briss  The Nicobar Pigeon  Alb Edw  and  Lath  Specific character  Its tail is white its body black its wingquills blue its back glossy green with an elongated feather round its neck  which according to him is of the size of the European Ring Pigeon its head and throat are of a blueishblack the belly of a blackishbrown and the upper parts of the body and of the wings are variegated with blue with red with purple with yellow and with green According to Edwards who has since Albin given an excellent description and an accurate figure of it the size does not exceed that of an ordinary Pigeon The feathers covering the tail are long and pointed like those of a dunghill cock they have very beautiful reflections of colour variegated with blue with red with gold and with copper the back and the upperside of the wing are green with reflections of gold and copper I have subjoins Edwards found in Albin figures which he calls the  Cock  and the  Hen  of this species but I have examined the specimens in Sir Hans Sloane's collection and can discover no difference from which we might infer that these birds were male  and female Albin calls it the  Ninckombar Pigeon  the true name of the island whence this bird was brought is  Nicobar  there are several small islands which bear that name and lie on the north of Sumatra  V  The bird called by the Dutch  Kronvogel  figured by Edwards Pl CCCXXXVIII under the name of the  Great Crowned Pigeon  Columba Coronata  Linn  and  Gmel  Columba Mugiens  Scop  Specific character  It is bluish above cinereous its orbits black its shoulders ferruginous  and also by Brisson by the term  Crowned Pheasant of India  Though this bird is as large as a turkey it belongs undoubtedly to the genus of the Pigeon its bill its head its neck the general shape of its body its legs its feet its nails its cooing its instincts its habits c all are analogous From being deceived by its size and never thinking of comparing it with a Pigeon Brisson and afterwards our designer termed it a  Pheasant  The last work of Edwards was not then published that excellent ornitholgist has since given  his opinion on the subject  It is of the family of the Pigeons though it is as large as a middle sized turkey Mr Loten brought several of these birds alive from India It is a native of the island of Banda Mr Loten assured me that it was really a Pigeon and has all the gestures and cooing of that bird in caressing its female I confess that without this information I should never have imagined that a bird of such magnitude was related to the Pigeons  Edwards Gleanings    The Prince of Soubise has very lately received at Paris five of these birds alive They are all so much like each other in size and colour that it is impossible to distinguish their sex Besides they do not lay and Mauduit an intelligent naturalist informs me that he saw several in Holland which also did not lay I remember to have read in some voyages that it is usual in India to raise these birds as we do our poultry  The COMMON TURTLE  In Greek  from  or    to

Turtle more perhaps than any other birds loves coolness in summer and gentle warmth in winter It arrives in our climates very late in the spring and departs in the end of August whereas the Bisets and the Ring Pigeons appear a month earlier and remain a month later and some even the whole winter All the Turtles without a single exception assemble in flocks and perform their journeys in a body they never reside with us more than four or five months and during that short space they pair build their nest and lay and rear their young which are able to join them in their retreat They choose the darkest and coolest woods to form their settlement and they construct their nest which is almost quite flat on  N  o  THE TURTLE  the tallest trees at a distance from our habitations In Sweden  The Turtles do not winter with us the Turtles keep in flocks when they arrive and depart the Quails also retire except a few that settle in sheltered spots which is likewise the case with the Turtles  ARIST  Hist Anim  lib viii  in Germany in France in Italy in Greece  We saw in the kingdom of Siam two sorts of Turtles the first is like ours and the flesh excellent the second has a finer plumage

BOSMAN'S  Voyage to Guinea  There are Turtles in the Philippines in the isles of Pulo Condor and in Sumatra  DAMPIER'S  Voyage  Here at New Holland is a number of plump fat Turtles which are very good eating  Idem  and perhaps in countries still cooler or hotter than these they remain only during summer and depart before autumn only Aristotle informs us that in Greece a few stay behind in the most sheltered situations this seems to prove that they seek very hot climates where to pass the winter They are found in every part almost of the Ancient Continent  The plains of Chili are stocked with an infinite number of birds particularly Ring Pigeons and Turtles  FREZIER'S  Voyage  The Ring Pigeons there are bitter and the Turtles not excellent  Idem    In New Spain are many European birds as Pigeons large Turtles like those of Europe and others as little as Thrushes  GEMELLI CARRERI tom v    In no part of the world have I seen such numbers of Turtles and Ring Pigeons as at Areca in Peru  LE GENTIL tom i  In the country about the Bay of Campeachy there are different sorts of Turtles some have a white craw the rest of the plumage gray verging on blue these are the largest and are good eating others are of a brown colour over the whole body not so fat as the first and smaller These two species fly in pairs and live upon the berries which they gather from the trees The third sort are of a very dull gray and called  Land Turtles  they are much larger than a Lark round and plump they go in pairs  DAMPIER'S  Voyage    It is commonly believed that there are Red Partridges and Ortolans at St Domingo but this is a mistake for these are different species of Turtles ours are very common there  CHARLEVOIX  Hist des St Dominque  tom i pp    At Martinico and the Antilles Turtles are seldom found but in sequestered spots whither they are driven Those of America have appeared to me to be much larger than those of France At the time they breed many of the young are caught in nets they are fed in voleries and fatten perfectly well but are not so fine tasted as the wild ones it is impossible to tame them Those which live at liberty feed on  monbin  plums and wild olives of which the nuts remain pretty long in the craw which has led some persons to believe they eat small stones They are commonly very fat and well tasted  Nouv Voy aux iles de l'Amerique  tom ii p  they occur also in the  New  In the enchanting islands of the South Sea we saw Turtles that were so familiar as to perch upon us  Hist des Navig aux Terres Auslrales  tom ii p  There are plenty of Turtles at the Gallapago islands in the South Sea they are so tame that one may kill five or six dozen in an afternoon merely with a stick  Nouv Voy aux iles de l'Amerique  tom ii p  as far as the South Sea islands  Linnaeus  Fauna Suecica  No  They are like the Pigeons subject to varieties and though naturally more savage they can be raised in the same manner and multiplied in the domestic state It is easy to intermingle their different varieties and they can even be made to breed with the Pigeon and thus produce new  tribes or new individual varieties  I have seen a person writes me of the most undoubted credit  M Hebert whom I have already cited more than once  I have seen in Bugey at a house of Chartreux a bird got by crossing a Pigeon with a Turtle it was of the colour of a French Turtle and resembled the Turtle more than the Pigeon it was restless and molested the other birds of the volery The father Pigeon was of a very small kind perfectly white with black wings  It has not been observed whether these hybrids are prolific but the general fact proves at least the great analogy that subsists between these two birds It is therefore not unlikely as we have before remarked that all the varieties of the domestic Pigeon may result from the gradations of intercourse and the multiplied combinations of the Biset the Ring Pigeon and the Turtle  What seems to confirm our opinion with regard to these unions which may be conceived to be illegitimate as being out of the usual course of nature is that excessive ardor which these birds feel in the season of love The Turtle melts with a still more tender passion than the Pigeon and more singular preludes announce the swell of pleasure The male Pigeon only struts round his mate puffing and displaying his figure The Turtle whether kept in confinement or fluttering at will in the grove begins his addresses by  saluting his female eighteen or twenty times in succession in the most humble posture bending so low each time as to touch the ground or the branch with his bill and he sighs the tenderest murmurs The female appears at first insensible to his passion but the secret flame soon kindles and at last yielding to the soft desires she gives vent to some plaintive accents And when once she has dissolved in his embrace she burns with a constant fire she never leaves the male she returns his kisses and his caresses and stimulates him to renew the rapturous joys till the business of hatching divides her attention and invites to more serious occupations  I shall cite only one fact which manifests the ardour of these birds  The Turtle M Roy writes me differs from the Ring Pigeon and the Common Pigeon by its dissoluteness and inconstancy notwithstanding its reputation for the contrary qualities Not only females that are shut up in voleries receive promiscuously all the males but I have seen wild ones which were neither constrained nor corrupted by domestication give favours to two successively on the same branch  if the males be put in one cage and the females in another they will copulate together as if they were of different sexes the males indeed burn sooner and with more intensity than the females Confinement therefore only deranges nature but cannot extinguish it  In the species of the Turtle we are acquainted with two constant varieties The first is the  N  o  THE COLLAR'D TURTLE  N  o  THE WHITE TURTLE  Common Turtle the second the  Collared Turtle  Columba Risoria  Linn  and  Gmel  La Tourterelle à Collier  Buff  Turtur Torquatus  Briss  The Indian Turtle  Albin    Will  The Collared Turtle  Lath  Specific character  Above yellowish with a black crescent on the neck  so called because it bears on its neck a sort of black collar Both of them are found in our climate and when they mix together they produce a hybrid The one which Schwenckfeld describes and which he calls  Turtur mixtus  was the offspring of a common male Turtle and of the female Collared Turtle and resembled more the father than the mother I have no doubt but these are prolific The Collared Turtle is only somewhat larger than the common kind its instincts and habits are the same In general we may say that all the three tribes of the Pigeon are more analogous in their dispositions than in their figure They eat and drink in the same manner without lifting their head till they have swallowed as much as they want they fly in flocks their voice is a loud murmur or a plaintive moan rather than an articulated song they lay only two eggs sometimes three all of them hatch several times in the year in warm countries or when kept in voleries  Specific character of the Turtle  ColumbaTurtur    Its tailquills are tipped with white its back gray its breast carnation a black lateral spot on its neck with white strokes  The Turtle is found in the west of England where it breeds retired in the oakwoods  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE TURTLE  I  Columba Marginata  Linn and Gmel  Turtur Americanus  Briss  The Marginated Pigeon  Lath  THE Turtle as well as the Common Pigeon and the Ring Pigeon has suffered varieties in different climates and occurs likewise in both continents That which Brisson has mentioned by the name of the  Canada Turtle  and which is figured No  Pl Enl  is rather larger and its tail longer than that of the European Turtle but the differences are not so great as to constitute a distinct species I think that we might refer to it the bird which Edwards calls Pl XV the  Longtailed Dove  and which Brisson names the  American Turtle  These birds much resemble each other and as they are distinguished from our Turtle only by the length of their tail we regard them as varieties produced by influence of climate  II  The SENEGAL TURTLE and the COLLARED TURTLE OF SENEGAL both mentioned by Brisson the second being only a variety of the first as the Collared Turtle of Europe is only a variety of the common sort they appear not distinct species from our Turtles for they are of the same size and scarce differ but in the colours which must be ascribed to the influence of climate  We presume that the Spotted throated Turtle of Senegal being of the same size and climate with the preceding is also but a variety  III The TOUROCCO  Columba Macroura  Gmel  The Greattailed Pigeon  Lath  But there is another bird of Senegal which has hitherto been noticed by no naturalist and which we have caused to be engraved  Pl Enl  No under the name of the  Broadtail Turtle of Senegal  this denomination being given  it by Adanson when he presented it However as it seems to differ from the European Turtle carrying its tail like the  Hocco  and having the bill and other characters of the Turtle the term  Tourocco  may denote its mixed qualities  Specific character of the  Columba Macroura    It is cinnamoncoloured below partly whitish the tip of its tail white  IV The TURTLETTE  Columba Capensis  Gmel  The Cape Pigeon  Lath  Another bird akin to the Turtle which is that described by Brisson and figured  Pl Enl  No by the appellation of  Black Cravated Turtle of the Cape of Good Hope  but we have appropriated a name to it because it appears a peculiar species different from that of the Turtle It is much smaller than our Turtle and its tail much longer though not so broad as that of the Tourocco the two feathers in the middle of the tail only are very long The male alone is represented in the  Pl Enl  it is distinguished from the female by a kind of cravat of a shining black under the neck and on  the throat while the corresponding part in the female is gray mixed with brown This bird is found at Senegal as well as at the Cape of Good Hope and probably in all the southern parts of Africa  Specific character of the  Columba Capensis    Its primary wingquills are rufous on the inside  V The TURVERT  We give this name to a green bird which bears some resemblance to the Turtle but appears to be a species entirely distinct from all the rest Under the Turvert we include three birds No and of the  Pl Enl  The first has been described by Brisson under the appellation of  Green Amboyna Turtle  and in the  Pl Enl  by the  Purplethroated Turtle of Amboyna  Columba Viridis  Linn  and  Gmel  The Green Turtle  Lath  Specific character  It is coppercoloured the underside of its body purple violet  because that colour of the throat is the most striking character of the bird  To this species the following passages probably refer  In the island of Java there is an infinite number of Turtles of different colours green with white and black spots yellow and white white and black and a species of an ashcolour Their bulk is as different as their colours are various some are as large as a Pigeon and others are smaller than a Thrush  Le GENTIL  Voyage au Tour du Monde  In the Philippine islands is a sort of Turtle which has the feathers on the back gray and those on the stomach white in the middle of which we perceive a red spot like a fresh wound flowing with blood  GEMELLI CARRERI tom v p  The  second is the  Turtle of Batavia  Columba Melanocephala  Gmel  The Blackcapped Pigeon  Lath  which has not been noticed by any naturalist We may presume that being a native of the same climate with the Turvert and differing little in size shape or colours it is only a variety arising from the age or sex The third is termed the  Java Turtle  Columba Javanica  Gmel  The Javan Turtle  Lath  because it is said to inhabit that island it seems also to be only a variety of the Turvert but still more characterised than the former by the difference of colour in the lower parts of the body  VI  These are not the only species or varieties of the Turtle tribe for in the Old Continent we find the  Portugal Turtle  Columba Turtur  Var    Gmel  Turtur Lusitanicus  Briss  which is brown with black and white spots on each side and near the  middle of the tail  The striated Turtle of China  Columba Sinica  Linn  and  Gmel  Turtur Sinensis Striatus  Briss  Dove from China  Alb  Specific character  It is dusky striped with black its belly somewhat bloodcoloured its wings yellow the wingquills and the bill black  which is a beautiful bird the head and neck being streaked with yellow red and white  The striated Turtle of India  Columba Striata  Linn  and  Gmel  Turtur Indicus Striatus  Briss  The Barred Turtle  Lath  Specific character  Its orbits and straps bright white its body cinereous striped with black below rufous  which is not striped longitudinally along the back as the preceding but transversely on the body and the wings  The Amboyna Turtle  Columba Amboinensis  Linn  and  Gmel  Turtur Amboinensis  Briss  Thus described by Brisson  Rufous tail very long neck and breast covered with feathers striated transversely with blackish wingquills dusky tailquills of a duskyrufous  which is also striped transversely with black lines on the neck and breast with a very long tail But as we have not seen these four birds and as the authors who describe them term them  Doves  or  Pigeons  we cannot decide whether they belong to the Pigeons or to the Turtles  VII The TOURTE  Columba Carolinensis  Linn and Gmel  Columba Canadensis  Linn and Gmel  Turtur Carolinensis  Briss  Turtur Canadensis  Briss  The Carolina Pigeon  Penn and Lath  The Canada Pigeon  Penn and Lath  In the New Continent we meet first with the Canada Turtle which as I have said is the same species with the European Turtle  Another bird which we have called after the travellers  Tourte  is what Catesby has termed the  Carolina Turtle  This Pigeon resides the whole year in Carolina and seeds on the berries of poke  Phytolacca Decandria  Linn and the seeds of the mugapple  Podophyllum Peltatum  Linn Its flesh is delicate  It appears to be the same the only difference being a goldcoloured spot mixed with green and crimson which in Catesby's bird is placed below the eyes and on the side of the neck but which is not to be seen in ours This would incline me to suppose that the first is the male and the second the female It is likely that the  Picacuroba  of Brazil mentioned by Marcgrave belongs to this species  I presume also that the Jamaica Turtle  Columba Cyanocephala  Linn  and  Gmel  Turtur Jamaicensis  Briss  The Turtle Dove from Jamaica  Alb  The Bluehead Turtle  Lath  Specific character  Its head is blue with a white stripe under its eyes  noticed by Albin and afterwards by Brisson being  a native of the same climate with the preceding and differing but little from it must be regarded as a variety of it  We shall also remark that this bird bears a great resemblance to the one given by Edwards which is probably only the female of ours What alone seems opposed to this opinion is the difference between the climates Edwards was informed that his bird came from the East Indies and ours was brought from America Might not there be some mistake with regard to the climate of Edwards's These birds are so much like each other and to the  Tourte  that we cannot be persuaded that they are the inhabitants of climates so widely different and we are certain that ours was sent from Jamaica to the Royal Cabinet  VIII The COCOTZIN  Columba Passerina  Linn and Gmel  Turtur Parvus Americanus  Briss  Columbus Minutus  Klein  The Ground Dove  Catesby Penn and Lath  We have retained this name given by Fernandez because the bird on which it was bestowed seems to differ from all the others As it is smaller than the Ordinary Turtle many naturalists have called it the  Little Turtle  Ray Sloane Brown c  Others  have called it the  Ortolan  Martinico Ortolan  Dutertre    The birds which our islanders call  Ortolans  are only Turtles much smaller than those of Europe Their plumage is of an ashgray the underside of the throat inclines somewhat to rufous they always go in pairs and many of them are found in the woods These birds are fond of seeing people and come into the roads without being scared When taken young they grow very tame they are lumps of fat of a luscious taste  Nouv Voy aux îlcs de l'Amerique  tom ii p  because it is not much larger than that bird and is excellent eating It was represented  Pl Enl  No by the name of  Little Turtle of St Domingo  fig and  Little Turtle of Martinico  fig But after a close examination and comparison we are convinced that they are the same bird fig being the male and fig the female It would also seem that the  Picuipinima  of Piso and Marcgrave and the Little Turtle of Acapulco mentioned by Gemelli Carreri  In the neighbourhood of Acapulco Turtles are seen smaller than ours with the tips of the wings coloured they sly even into houses  GEMELLI CARRERI tom vi p  belong all to the same kind And thus this bird is spread through all the southern parts of the New World  Specific character of the  Columba Passerina    The quills of its wings and tail are darkish its body is purplish its bill and legs are red  This Pigeon is notlarger than a Lark It sometimes advances to the coast of Carolina where it seeds on the berries of shrubs especially those of the pellitory  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
