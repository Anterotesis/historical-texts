Thy light O LIBERTY to shine on all  Bright intellectual Sun why does thy ray  To earth distribute only partial day  Since no resisting cause from spirit flows  Thy penetrating essence to oppose  No obstacles by Nature's hand imprest  Thy subtle and ethereal beams arrest  Nor motion's laws can speed thy active course  Nor strong repulsion's pow'rs obstruct thy force  Since there is no convexity in MIND  Why are thy genial beams to parts confin'd  While the chill North with thy bright ray is blest  Why should fell darkness half the South invest  Was it decreed fair Freedom at thy birth  That thou shou'd'st ne'er irradiate  all  the earth  While Britain basks in thy full blaze of light  Why lies sad Afric quench'd in total night  Thee only sober Goddess I attest  In smiles chastis'd and decent graces drest  Not that unlicens'd monster of the crowd  Whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud  Deaf'ning the ear of Peace fierce Faction's tool  Of rash Sedition born and mad Misrule  Whose stubborn mouth rejecting Reason's rein  No strength can govern and no skill restrain  Whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw  To spurn at Order and to outrage Law  To tread on grave Authority and Pow'r  And shake the work of ages in an hour  Convuls'd her voice and pestilent her breath  She raves of mercy while she deals out death  Each blast is fate she darts from either hand  Red conflagration o'er th' astonish'd land  Clamouring for peace she rends the air with noise  And to reform a part the whole destroys  O plaintive Southerne  Author of the Tragedy of Oronoko  whose impassion'd strain  So oft has wak'd my languid Muse in vain  Now when congenial themes her cares engage  She burns to emulate thy glowing page  Her failing efforts mock her fond desires  She shares thy feelings not partakes thy fires  Strange pow'r of song the strain that warms the heart  Seems the same inspiration to impart  Touch'd by the kindling energy alone  We think the flame which melts us is our own  Deceiv'd for genius we mistake delight  Charm'd as we read we fancy we can write  Tho' not to me sweet Bard thy pow'rs belong  Fair Truth a hallow'd guide inspires my song  Here Art wou'd weave her gayest flow'rs in vain  For Truth the bright invention wou'd disdain  For no fictitious ills these numbers flow  But living anguish and substantial woe  No individual griefs my bosom melt  For millions feel what Oronoko felt  Fir'd by no single wrongs the countless host  I mourn by rapine dragg'd from Afric's coast  Perish th' illiberal thought which wou'd debase  The native genius of the sable race  Perish the proud philosophy which sought  To rob them of the pow'rs of equal thought  Does then th' immortal principle within  Change with the casual colour of a skin  Does matter govern spirit or is mind  Degraded by the form to which 'tis join'd  No they have heads to think and hearts to feel  And souls to act with firm tho' erring zeal  For they have keen affections kind desires  Love strong as death and active patriot fires  All the rude energy the fervid flame  Of highsoul'd passion and ingenuous shame  Strong but luxuriant virtues boldly shoot  From the wild vigour of a savage root  Nor weak their sense of honour's proud control  For pride is virtue in a Pagan soul  A sense of worth a conscience of desert  A high unbroken haughtiness of heart  That selfsame stuff which erst proud empires sway'd  Of which the conquerors of the world were made  Capricious fate of man that very pride  In Afric scourg'd in Rome was deify'd  No Muse O  It is a point of honour among negroes of a high spirit to die rather than to suffer their glossy skin to bear the mark of the whip Quashi had somehow offended his master a young planter with whom he had been bred up in the endearing intimacy of a playfellow His services had been faithful his attachment affectionate The master resolved to punish him and pursued him for that purpose In trying to escape Quashi stumbled and fell the master fell upon him they wrestled long with doubtful victory at length Quashi got uppermost and being firmly seated on his master's breast he secured his legs with one hand and with the other drew a sharp knife then said  Master I have been bred up with you from a child I have loved you as myself in return you have condemned me to a punishment of which I must ever have borne the marks thus only I can avoid them  so saying he drew the knife with all his strength across his own throat and sell down dead without a groan on his master's body  Ramsay's Essay on the Treatment of African Slaves  Quashi shall thy deeds relate  No statue snatch thee from oblivious fate  For thou wast born where never gentle Muse  On Valour's grave the flow'rs of Genius strews  And thou wast born where no recording page  Plucks the fair deed from Time's devouring rage  Had Fortune plac'd thee on some happier coast  Where polish'd souls heroic virtue boast  To thee who sought'st a voluntary grave  Th' uninjur'd honours of thy name to save  Whose generous arm thy barbarous Master spar'd  Altars had smok'd and temples had been rear'd  Whene'er to Asric's shores I turn my eyes  Horrors of deepest deadliest guilt arise  I see by more than Fancy's mirror shewn  The burning village and the blazing town  See the dire victim torn from social life  The shrieking babe the agonizing wife  She wretch forlorn is dragg'd by hostile hands  To distant tyrants sold in distant lands  Transmitted miseries and successive chains  The sole sad heritage her child obtains  Ev'n this last wretched boon their foes deny  To weep together or together die  By felon hands by one relentless stroke  See the fond links of feeling Nature broke  The fibres twisting round a parent's heart  Torn from their grasp and bleeding as they part  Hold murderers hold nor aggravate distress  Respect the passions you yourselves possess  Ev'n you of ruffian heart and ruthless hand  Love your own offspring love your native land  Ah leave them holy Freedom's cheering smile  The heav'ntaught fondness for the parent soil  Revere affections mingled with our frame  In every nature every clime the same  In all these feelings equal sway maintain  In all the love of HOME and FREEDOM reign  And Tempe's vale and parch'd Angola's sand  One equal fondness of their sons command  Th' unconquer'd Savage laughs at pain and toil  Basking in Freedom's beams which gild his native soil  Does thirst of empire does desire of fame  For these are specious crimes our rage inflame  No sordid lust of gold their fate controls  The basest appetite of basest souls  Gold better gain'd by what their ripening sky  Their fertile fields their arts  Besides many valuable productions of the soil cloths and carpets of exquisite manufacture are brought from the coast of Guinea  and mines supply  What wrongs what injuries does Oppression plead  To smooth the horror of th' unnatural deed  What strange offence what aggravated sin  They stand convictedof a darker skin  Barbarians hold th' opprobrious commerce spare  Respect  his  sacred image which they bear  Tho' dark and savage ignorant and blind  They claim the common privilege of kind  Let Malice strip them of each other plea  They still are men and men shou'd still be free  Insulted Reason loaths th' inverted trade  Dire change the agent is the purchase made  Perplex'd the baffled Muse involves the tale  Nature confounded well may language fail  The outrag'd Goddess with abhorrent eyes  Sees MAN the traffic SOULS the merchandize  Plead not in reason's palpable abuse  Their sense of  Nothing is more frequent than this cruel and stupid argument that they do not  feel  the miseries inflicted on them as Europeans would do  feeling callous and obtuse  From heads to hearts lies Nature's plain appeal  Tho' few can reason all mankind can feel  Tho' wit may boast a livelier dread of shame  A loftier sense of wrong refinement claim  Tho' polish'd manners may fresh wants invent  And nice distinctions nicer souls torment  Tho' these on finer spirits heavier fall  Yet natural evils are the same to all  Tho' wounds there are which reason's force may heal  There needs no logic sure to make us feel  The nerve howe'er untutor'd can sustain  A sharp unutterable sense of pain  As exquisitely fashion'd in a slave  As where unequal fate a sceptre gave  Sense is as keen where Congo's sons preside  As where proud Tiber rolls his classic tide  Rhetoric or verse may point the feeling line  They do not whet sensation but define  Did ever slave less feel the galling chain  When Zeno prov'd there was no ill in pain  Their  miseries philosophic quirks deride  Slaves groan in pangs disown'd by Stoic pride  When the fierce Sun darts vertical his beams  And thirst and hunger mix their wild extremes  When the sharp iron  This is not said figuratively The writer of these lines has seen a complete set of chains fitted to every separate limb of these unhappy innocent men together with instruments for wrenching open the jaws contrived with such ingenious cruelty as would shock the humanity of an inquisitor  wounds his inmost soul  And his strain'd eyes in burning anguish roll  Will the parch'd negro find ere he expire  No pain in hunger and no heat in fire  For him when fate his tortur'd frame destroys  What hope of present fame or future joys  For  this  have heroes shorten'd nature's date  For  that  have martyrs gladly met their fate  But him forlorn no hero's pride sustains  No martyr's blissful visions sooth his pains  Sullen he mingles with his kindred dust  For he has learn'd to dread the Christian's trust  To him what mercy can that Pow'r display  Whose servants murder and whose sons betray  Savage thy venial error I deplore  They are  not  Christians who infest thy shore  O thou sad spirit whose preposterous yoke  The great deliverer Death at length has broke  Releas'd from misery and escap'd from care  Go meet that mercy man deny'd thee here  In thy dark home sure refuge of th' oppress'd  The wicked vex not and the weary rest  And if some notions vague and undefin'd  Of future terrors have assail'd thy mind  If such thy masters have presum'd to teach  As terrors only they are prone to preach  For shou'd they paint eternal Mercy's reign  Where were th' oppressor's rod the captive's chain  If then thy troubled soul has learn'd to dread  The dark unknown thy trembling footsteps tread  On HIM who made thee what thou art depend  HE who withholds the means accepts the end  Not  thine  the reckoning dire of LIGHT abus'd  KNOWLEDGE disgrac'd and LIBERTY misus'd  On  thee  no awful judge incens'd shall sit  For parts perverted and dishonour'd wit  Where ignorance will be found the surest plea  How many learn'd and wise shall envy  thee  And thou WHITE SAVAGE whether lust of gold  Or lust of conquest rule thee uncontrol'd  Hero or robberby whatever name  Thou plead thy impious claim to wealth or fame  Whether inferior mischiefs be thy boast  A petty tyrant rifling Gambia's coast  Or bolder carnage track thy crimson way  Kings dispossess'd and Provinces thy prey  Panting to tame wide earth's remotest bound  All Cortez murder'd all Columbus found  O'er plunder'd realms to reign detested Lord  Make millions wretched and thyself abhorr'd  In Reason's eye in Wisdom's fair account  Your sum of glory boasts a like amount  The means may differ but the end's the same  Conquest is pillage with a nobler name  Who makes the sum of human blessings less  Or sinks the stock of general happiness  No solid same shall grace no true renown  His life shall blazon or his memory crown  Had those advent'rous spirits who explore  Thro' ocean's trackless wastes the farsought shore  Whether of wealth insatiate or of pow'r  Conquerors who waste or ruffians who devour  Had these possess'd O COOK thy gentle mind  Thy love of arts thy love of humankind  Had these pursued thy mild and liberal plan  DISCOVERERS had not been a curse to man  Then bless'd Philanthropy thy social hands  Had link'd dissever'd worlds in brothers bands  Careless if colour or if clime divide  Then lov'd and loving man had liv'd and died  The purest wreaths which hang on glory's shrine  For empires founded peaceful PENN are thine  No bloodstain'd laurels crown'd thy virtuous toil  No slaughter'd natives drench'd thy fairearn'd soil  Still thy meek spirit in thy  The Quakers have emancipated all their slaves throughout America  flock survives  Consistent still  their  doctrines rule their lives  Thy followers only have effac'd the shame  Inscrib'd by SLAVERY on the Christian name  Shall Britain where the soul of Freedom reigns  Forge chains for others she herself disdains  Forbid it Heaven O let the nations know  The liberty she loves she will bestow  Not to herself the glorious gift confin'd  She spreads the blessing wide as humankind  And scorning narrow views of time and place  Bids all be free in earth's extended space  What page of human annals can record  A deed so bright as human rights restor'd  O may that godlike deed that shining page  Redeem OUR fame and consecrate OUR age  And see the cherub Mercy from above  Descending softly quits the sphere of love  On feeling hearts she sheds celestial dew  And breathes her spirit o'er th' enlighten'd few  From soul to soul the spreading influence steals  Till every breast the soft contagion feels  She bears exulting to the burning shore  The loveliest office Angel ever bore  To vindicate the pow'r in Heaven ador'd  To still the clank of chains and sheathe the sword  To cheer the mourner and with soothing hands  From bursting hearts unbind th' Oppressor's bands  To raise the lustre of the Christian name  And clear the foulest blot that dims its fame  As the mild Spirit hovers o'er the coast  A fresher hue the wither'd landscapes boast  Her healing smiles the ruin'd scenes repair  And blasted Nature wears a joyous air  She spreads her blest commission from above  Stamp'd with the sacred characters of love  She tears the banner stain'd with blood and tears  And LIBERTY thy shining standard rears  As the bright ensign's glory she displays  See pale OPPRESSION faints beneath the blaze  The giant dies no more his frown appals  The chain untouch'd drops off the fetter falls  Astonish'd echo tells the vocal shore  Oppression's fall'n and Slavery is no more  The dusky myriads crowd the sultry plain  And hail that mercy long invok'd in vain  Victorious Pow'r she bursts their twofold bands  And FAITH and FREEDOM spring from Mercy's hands  FINIS
