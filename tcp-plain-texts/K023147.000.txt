 MEMOIRS Of the Extraordinary LIFE WORKS AND DISCOVERIES OF  MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS  By Mr POPE  DUBLIN  Printed by and for GEORGE FAULKNER MDCCXLI  INTRODUCTION TO THE READER  IN the Reign of Queen ANNE which notwithstanding those happy Times which succeeded every Englishman may remember thou may'st possibly gentle Reader have seen a certain Venerable Person who frequented the Outside of the Palace of St James's and who by the Gravity of his Deportment and Habit was generally taken for a decay'd Gentleman of Spain His stature was tall his visage long his complexion olive his brows were  black and even his eyes hollow yet piercing his nose inclin'd to Aquiline his beard neglected and mix'd with grey All this contributed to spread a solemn Melancholy over his countenance Pythagoras was not more silent Pyrrho more motionless nor Zeno more austere His Wig was as black and smooth as the plumes of a Raven and hung as strait as the hair of a RiverGod rising from the water His Cloak so compleatly covered his whole person that whether or no he had any other cloaths much less any linnen under it I shall not say but his sword appear'd a full yard behind him and his manner of wearing it was so stiff that it seem'd grown to his Thigh his whole figure  was so utterly unlike any thing of this world that it was not natural for any man to ask him a question without blessing himself first Those who never saw a  Jesuit  took him for one and others believed him some  High Priest of the Jews  But under this macerated form was conceal'd a Mind replete with Science burning with a Zeal of benefiting his fellowcreatures and filled with an honest conscious Pride mix'd with a scorn of doing or suffering the least thing beneath the dignity of a Philosopher Accordingly he had a soul that would not let him accept of any offers of Charity at the same time that his body seem'd but too much to require it His lodging  was in a small chamber up four pair of stairs where he regularly payed for what he had when he eat or drank and he was often observed wholly to abstain from both He declin'd speaking to any one except the Queen or her first Minister to whom he attempted to make some applications but his real business or intentions were utterly unknown to all men Thus much is certain that he was obnoxious to the Queen's Ministry who either out of Jealousy or Envy had him spirited away and carried abroad as a dangerous person without any regard to the known Laws of the Kingdom  One day as this Gentleman was walking about dinnertime alone in the Mall it happen'd  that a Manuscript dropt from under his cloak which my servant pick'd up and brought to me It was written in the Latin tongue and contain'd many most profound Secrets in an unusual turn of reasoning and style The first leaf was inscribed with these words  Codicillus se√∫ Liber Memorialis Martini Scribleri  The Book was of so wonderful a nature that it is incredible what a desire I conceiv'd that moment to be acquainted with the Author who I clearly perceiv'd was some great Philosopher in disguise I several times endeavour'd to speak to him which he as often industriously avoided At length I found an opportunity as he stood under the Piazza by the Dancingroom  in St James's to acquaint him in the Latin tongue that his Manuscript was fallen into my hands and saying this I presented it to him with great Encomiums on the learned Author Hereupon he took me aside survey'd me over with a fix'd attention and opening the clasps of the Parchment cover spoke to my great surprize in English as follows  " Courteous stranger whoever thou art I embrace thee as my best friend for either the Stars and my Art are deceitful or the destin'd time is come which is to manifest Martinus Scriblerus to the world and thou the person chosen by fate for this task What thou seest in me is a  body exhausted by the labours of the mind I have found in Dame Nature not indeed an unkind but a very coy Mistress Watchful nights anxious days slender meals and endless labours must be the lot of all who pursue her through her labyrinths and meanders My first vital air I drew in this Island a soil fruitful of Philosophers but my complexion is become adust and my body arid by visiting lands as the Poet has it  alio sub sole calentes  I have through my whole life passed under several disguises and unknown names to skreen my self from the envy and malice which mankind express against those who are  possessed of the  Arcanum Magnum  But at present I am forc'd to take Sanctuary in the British Court to avoid the Revenge of a cruel Spaniard who has pursued me almost through the whole terraqueous globe Being about four years ago in the City of Madrid in quest of natural knowledge I was informed of a Lady who was marked with a Pomegranate upon the inside of her right Thigh which blossom'd and as it were seem'd to ripen in the due season Forthwith was I possessed with an insatiable curiosity to view this wonderful Phaenomenon I felt the ardour of my passion encrease as the season advanced till in  the month of July I could no longer contain I bribed her Duenna was admitted to the Bath saw her undress'd and the wonder display'd This was soon after discovered by the husband who finding some letters I had writ to the Duenna containing expressions of a doubtful meaning suspected me of a crime most alien from the Purity of my Thoughts Incontinently I left Madrid by the advice of friends have been pursued dogg'd and waylaid through several Nations and even now scarce think my self secure within the sacred walls of this Palace It has been my good fortune to have seen all the grand Phaenomena of Nature  excepting an Earthquake which I waited for in Naples three years in vain and now by means of some British Ship whose Colours no Spaniard dares approach I impatiently expect a safe passage to Jamaica for that benefit To thee my Friend whom Fate has marked for my Historiographer I leave these my Commentaries and others of my works No morebe faithful and impartial"  He soon after performed his promise and left me the Commentaries giving me also further lights by many Conferences when he was unfortunately snatch'd away as I before related by the jealousy of the Queen's Ministry  Tho' I was thus to my eternal grief depriv'd of his conversation he for some years continued his Correspondence and communicated to me many of his Projects for the benefit of mankind He sent me some of his Writings and recommended to my care the recovery of others straggling about the world and assumed by other men The last time I heard from him was on occasion of his Strictures on the Dunciad since when several years being elaps'd I have reason to believe this excellent Person is either dead or carry'd by his vehement thirst of knowledge into some remote or perhaps undiscover'd Region of the world In either case I think it a debt no longer to be delay'd to reveal what I know of this  Prodigy of Science and to give the History of his life and of his extensive merits to mankind in which I dare promise the Reader that whenever he begins to think any one Chapter dull the style will be immediately changed in the next  MEMOIRS OF  MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS  BOOK I  CHAP I  Of the Parentage and Family of  Scriblerus  how he was begot what Care was taken of him before he was born and what Prodigies attended his Birth  IN the City of Munster in Germany lived a grave and learned Gentleman by Profession an Antiquary who among all his invaluable Curiosities esteemed none more highly than a Skin of the true Pergamenian Parchment which hung at the upperend of his hall On this was curiously traced the ancient Pedigree of the  Scribleri  with all their Alliances and collateral Relations  among which were reckon'd Albertus Magnus Paracelsus Bombastus and the famous Scaligers in old time Princes of Verona and deduced even from the Times of the Elder Pliny to Cornelius Scriblerus For such was the name of this venerable Personage whose glory it was that by the singular Virtue of the Women not one had a Head of a different Cast from his family  His wife was a Lady of singular beauty whom not for that reason only he espoused but because she was undoubted daughter either of the great Scriverius or of Gaspar Barthius It happen'd on a time the said Gaspar made a visit to Scriverius at Harlem taking with him a comely Lady of his acquaintance who was skilful in the Greek Tongue of whom the learned Scriverius became so enamour'd as to inebriate his friend and be familiar with his Mistress I am not ignorant of what  Columesius relates this from Isaac Vossius in his Opuscul p  Columesius affirms that the  learned Barthius was not so overtaken but he perceiv'd it and in Revenge suffer'd this unfortunate Gentlewoman to be drowned in the Rhine at her return But Mrs Scriblerus the issue of that Amour was a living proof of the falsehood of this Report Dr Cornelius was further induced to his marriage from the certain information that the aforesaid Lady the mother of his wife was related to Cardan on the father's side and to Aldrovandus on the mother's Besides which her Ancestors had been professors of Physick Astrology or Chymistry in German Universities from generation to generation  With this fair Gentlewoman had our Doctor lived in a comfortable Union for about ten years But this our sober and orderly pair without any natural infirmity and with a constant and frequent compliance to the chief duty of conjugal life were yet unhappy in that Heaven had not blessed them with any issue This was the utmost grief to the good man especially considering  what exact Precautions and Methods he had used to procure that Blessing for he never had cohabitation with his spouse but he ponder'd on the Rules of the Ancients for the generation of Children of Wit He ordered his diet according to the prescription of Galen confining himself and his wife for almost the whole first year to  Galen Lib de Cibis boni mali succi cap  Goat's Milk and Honey It unfortunately befel her when she was about four months gone with child to long for somewhat which that author inveighs against as prejudicial to the understanding of the Infant This her husband thought fit to deny her affirming it was better to be childless than to become the Parent of a Fool His Wife miscarried but as the Abortion proved only a female Faetus he comforted himself that had it arrived to perfection it would not have answer'd his account his heart being wholly fixed upon the learned Sex However he  disdained not to treasure up the Embryo in a Vial among the curiosities of his family  Having discovered that Galen's prescription could not determine the sex he forthwith betook himself to Aristotle Accordingly he withheld the nuptial embrace when the wind was in any point of the South this  Arist Sect Prob  Author asserting that the grossness and moisture of the southerly winds occasion the procreation of females and not of males But he redoubled his diligence when the wind was at West a wind on which that great Philosopher bestowed the Encomiums of Fatner of the earth Breath of the Elysian Fields and other glorious Elogies For our learned man was clearly of opinion that the Semina out of which Animals are produced are Animalcula ready formed and received in with the Air  Religion of Nature Sect Parag  Under these regulations his wife to his unexpressible joy grew pregnant a  second time and what was no small addition to his happiness he just then came to the possession of a considerable Estate by the death of her Uncle a wealthy Jew who resided at London This made it necessary for him to take a journey to England nor would the care of his posterity let him suffer his Wife to remain behind him During the voyage he was perpetually taken up on the one hand how to employ his great Riches and on the other how to educate his Child He had already determin'd to set apart several annual Sums for the recovery of  Manuscripts  the effosson of  Coins  the procuring of  Mummies  and for all those curious discoveries by which he hoped to become as himself was wont to say a second  Peireskius  He had already chalked out all possible schemes for the improvement of a male child yet was so far prepar'd for the worst that could happen that before the nine months were expired he had composed two Treatises of Education the one he called  A Daughter's Mirrour  and the other  A Son's Monitor  This is all we can find relating to Martinus while he was in his Mother's womb excepting that he was entertained there with a Consort of Musick once in twenty four hours according to the Custom of the Magi and that on a  Ramsey's Cyrus  particular day he was observed to leap and kick exceedingly which was on the first of April the birthday of the great  Basilius Valentinus  The Truth of this and every preceding Fact may be depended upon being taken literally from the Memoirs But I must be so ingenuous as to own that the Accounts are not so certain of the exact time and place of his birth As to the first he had the common frailty of old men to conceal his age as to the second I only remember to have heard him say that he first saw the light in St Giles's Parish But in the investigation of this point Fortune hath favoured our diligence For one  day as I was passing by the  Seven Dials  I overheard a dispute concerning the place of Nativity of a great Astrologer which each man alledged to have been in his own street The circumstances of the time and the description of the person made me imagine it might be that universal Genius whose life I am writing I returned home and having maturely considered their several arguments which I found to be of equal weight I quieted my curiosity with this natural conclusion that he was born in some point common to all the seven streets which must be that on which the Column is now erected And it is with infinite pleasure that I since find my Conjecture confirmed by the following passage in the Codicil to Mr Neale's Will  I appoint my Executors to engrave the following Inscription on the Column in the Center of the seven Streets which I erected  LOC NAT INCLUT PHILOS MAR SCR  But Mr Neale's Order was never performed because the Executors durst not administer  Nor was the Birth of this great man unattended with Prodigies He himself has often told me that on the night before he was born Mrs Scriblerus dream'd she was brought to bed of a huge  Inkhorn  out of which issued several large streams of Ink as it had been a fountain This dream was by her husband thought to signify that the child should prove a very voluminous Writer Likewise a  Virgil's Laurel Donat  Crabtree  that had been hitherto barren appeared on a sudden laden with a vast quantity of Crabs This sign also the old gentleman imagined to be a prognostic of the acuteness of his Wit A great swarm of  Plato Lucan c  Wasps  play'd round his Cradle without hurting him but were very troublesome to all in the room besides This seemed a certain presage of the effects of his Satire A Dunghill was  seen within the space of one night to be covered all over with  Mushroom  This some interpreted to promise the infant great fertility of fancy but no long duration to his works but the Father was of another opinion  But what was of all most wonderful was a thing that seemed a monstrous  Fowl  which just then dropt through the skylight near his wife's apartment It had a large body two little disproportioned wings a prodigious tail but no head As its colour was white he took it at first sight for a Swan and was concluding his son would be a Poet but on a nearer view he preceived it to be speckled with black in the form of letters and that it was indeed a Paper kite which had broke its leash by the impetuosity of the wind His back was armed with the Art Military his belly was filled with Physick his wings were the wings of Quarles and Withers the several Nodes of his voluminous tail were diversify'd with several branches of Science where the Doctor beheld with great joy a knot of  Logick a knot of Metaphysick a knot of Casuistry a knot of Polemical Divinity and a knot of Common Law with a  Lanthorn  of  Jacob Behmen  There went a Report in the family that as soon as he was born he uttered the voice of nine several animals he cry'd like a Calf bleated like a Sheep chattered like a Magpye grunted like a Hog neighed like a Foal croaked like a Raven mewed like a Cat gabbled like a Goose and bray'd like an Ass And the next morning he was found playing in his bed with two Owls which came down the chimney His Father greatly rejoyced at all these signs which betokened the variety of his Eloquence and the extent of his Learning but he was more particularly pleased with the last as it nearly resembled what happen'd at the birth of  Vid Eustat in Odyss l ex Alex Paphio Leo Allat de patr Hom pag  Homer  CHAP II  The Speech of  Cornelius  over his Son at the Hour of his Birth  NO sooner was the cry of the Infant heard but the old gentleman rushed into the Room and snatching it in his arms examin'd every limb with attention He was infinitely pleas'd to find that the Child had the Wart of Cicero the wry Neck of Alexander knots upon his legs like Marius and one of them shorter than the other like Agesilaus The good Cornelius also hoped he would come to stammer like Demosthenes in order to be as eloquent and in time arrive at many other Defects of famous men He held the child so long that the Midwife grown out of all patience snatch'd it from his arms in order to swaddle it  ' Swaddle him quoth he far be it from me to submit to such a pernicious Custom Is not my son a Man  and is not Man the Lord of the Universe Is it thus you use this Monarch at his first arrival in his dominions to manacle and shackle him hand and foot Is this what you call to be freeborn If you have no regard to his natural Liberty at least have some to his natural Faculties Behold with what agility he spreadeth his Toes and moveth them with as great variety as his Fingers a power which in the small circle of a year may be totally abolish'd by the enormous confinement of shoes and stockings His Ears which other animals turn with great advantage towards the sonorous object may by the ministry of some accursed Nurse for ever lye flat and immoveable Not so the Ancients they could move them at pleasure and accordingly are often describ'd  arrectis auribus  "  ' What a devil quoth the Midwife would you have your son move his Ears like a Drill"  ' Yes fool said he why should he not have the perfection of a Drill or of any other  animal"  Mrs Scriblerus who lay all this while fretting at her husband's discourse at last broke out to this purpose  ' My dear I have had many disputes with you upon this subject before I was a month gone We have but one child and can not afford to throw him away upon experiments I'll have my boy bred up like other gentlemen at home and always under my own eye"  All the Gossips with one voice cry'd Ay ay but Cornelius broke out in this manner  ' What bred at home Have I taken all this pains for a creature that is to lead the inglorious life of a Cabbage to suck the nutritious juices from the spot where he was first planted No to perambulate this terraqueous Globe is too small a Range were it permitted he should at least make the Tour of the whole System of the Sun Let other Mortals pore upon Maps and swallow the legends of lying travellers the son of Cornelius shall make his own Legs his Compasses with those he shall measure Continents  Islands Capes Bays Streights and Isthmus's He shall himself take the altitude of the highest mountains from the piek of Derby to the piek of Tenariff when he has visited the top of Taurus Imaus Caucasus and the famous Ararat where Noah's Ark first moor'd he may take a flight view of the snowy Riphaeans nor would I have him neglect Athos and Olympus renowned for poetical fictions Those that vomit fire will deserve a more particular attention I will therefore have him observe with great care Vesuvius Aetna the burning mountain of Java but chiefly Hecla the greatest rarity in the Northern Regions Then he may likewise contemplate the wonders of the Mephitick cave When he has div'd into the bowels of the earth and survey'd the works of Nature under ground and instructed himself fully in the nature of Vulcanos Earthquakes Thunders Tempests and Hurricanes I hope he will bless the world with a more exact survey of  the deserts of Arabia and Tartary than as yet we are able to obtain Then will I have him cross the seven Gulphs measure the currents in the fifteen famous Streights and search for those fountains of fresh water that are at the bottom of the Ocean"  At these last words Mrs Scriblerus fell into a trembling the description of this terrible Scene made too violent an impression upon a woman in her condition and threw her into a strong hysteric Fit which might have prov'd dangerous if Cornelius had not been push'd out of the room by the united force of the women  CHAP III  Shewing what befel the Doctor's Son and his Shield on the Day of the Christ'ning  THE day of the Christ'ning being come and the house filled with Gossips the Levity of whose Conversation  suited but ill with the Gravity of Dr Cornelius he cast about how to pass this day more agreeably to his Character that is to say not without some  Profitable Conference  nor wholly without observance of some  Ancient Custom  He remembred to have read in Theocritus that the Cradle of Hercules was a Shield and being possess'd of an antique  Buckler  which he held as a most inestimable Relick he determined to have the infant laid therein and in that manner brought into the Study to be shown to certain learned men of his acquaintance  The regard he had for this Shield had caused him formerly to compile a Dissertation concerning it proving from the several properties and particularly the colour of the Rust the exact chronology thereof  With this Treatise and a moderate supper he proposed to entertain his Guests tho' he had also another design to have their assistance in the calculation of his Son's  Nativity  He therefore took the Buckler out of a Case in which he always kept it least it might contract any modern rust and entrusted it to his Housemaid with orders that when the company was come she should lay the Child carefully in it cover'd with a mantle of blue Sattin  The Guests were no sooner seated but they entered into a warm Debate about the  Triclinium  and the manner of  Decubitus  of the Ancients which Cornelius broke off in this manner  This day my Friends I purpose to exhibit my son before you a Child not wholly unworthy of Inspection as he is descended from a Race of Virtuosi Let the Phisiognomists examine his features let the Chirographists behold his Palm but above all let us consult for the calculation of his Nativity To this end as the child is not vulgar I will not present him unto you in a vulgar manner He shall be cradled in my Ancient Shield so famous through the Universities of Europe You all know how I purchas'd that invaluable piece of Antiquity at the  great though indeed inadequate expence of all the Plate of our family how happily I carry'd it off and how triumphantly I transported it hither to the inexpressible grief of all Germany Happy in every circumstance but that it broke the heart of the great Melchior Insipidus  Here he stopp'd his Speech upon sight of the Maid who enter'd the room with the Child He took it in his arms and proceeded  Behold then my Child but first behold the Shield Behold this Rustor rather let me call it this precious Aerugobehold this beautiful Varnish of Timethis venerable Verdure of so many Ages  In speaking these words he slowly lifted up the Mantle which cover'd it inch by inch but at every inch he uncovered his cheeks grew paler his hand trembled his nerves failed till on sight of the whole the Tremor became universal The Shield and the Infant both dropt to the ground and he had only  strength enough to cry out  O God my Shield my Shield  The Truth was the Maid extreamly concern'd for the reputation of her own cleanliness and her young master's honour had scoured it as clean as her Andirons  Cornelius sunk back on a chair the Guests stood astonished the infant squawl'd the maid ran in snatch'd it up again in her arms flew into her mistresses room and told what had happen'd Down stairs in an instant hurried all the Gossips where they found the Doctor in a Trance Hungary water Hartshorn and the confus'd noise of shrill voices at length awaken'd him when opening his eyes he saw the Shield in the hands of the Housemaid  O Woman Woman he cry'd and snatch'd it violently from her was it to thy ignorance that this Relick owes its ruin where where is the beautiful Crust that cover'd thee so long where those Traces of Time and  Fingers  as it were of Antiquity Where all those beautiful obscurities the cause of much delightful  disputation where doubt and curiosity went hand in hand and eternally exercised the speculations of the learned All this the rude Touch of an ignorant woman hath done away The  curious Prominence  at the belly of that figure which some taking for the  Cuspis  of a sword denominated a Roman Soldier others accounting the  Insignia Virilia  pronounc'd to be one of the  Dii Termini  behold she hath cleaned it in like shameful sort and shown to be the head of a Nail O my Shield my Shield well may I say with Horace  non bene relicta Parmula  The Gossips not at all inquiring into the cause of his sorrow only asked if the Child had no hurt and cry'd  Come come all is well what has the woman done but her duty a tight cleanly wench I warrant her what a stir a man makes about a  Bason  that an hour ago before this labour was bestowed upon it a Country Barber would not have hung at his shop door A  Bason  cry'd another no such matter 'tis nothing but a paultry old  Sconce  with the nozzle  broke off  The learned Gentlemen who till now had stood speechless hereupon looking narrowly on the Shield declar'd their Assent to this latter opinion and desir'd Cornelius to be comforted assuring him it was a  Sconce  and no other But this instead of comforting threw the Doctor into such a violent Fit of passion that he was carried off groaning and speechless to bed where being quite spent he fell into a kind of slumber  CHAP IV  Of the Suction and Nutrition of the Great  Scriblerus  in his Infancy and of the first Rudiments of his Learning  AS soon as Cornelius awaked he rais'd himself on his elbow and casting his eye on Mrs Scriblerus spoke as follows  Wisely was it said by Homer that in the Cellar of Jupiter are two barrels the one of good the other  of evil which he never bestows on mortals separately but constantly mingles them together Thus at the same time hath Heav'n bless'd me with the birth of a Son and afflicted me with the scouring of my Shield Yet let us not repine at his Dispensations who gives and who takes away but rather join in prayer that the Rust of Antiquity which he hath been pleas'd to take from my Shield may be added to my Son and that so much of it as it is my purpose he shall contract in his Education may never be destroy'd by any Modern Polishing  He cou'd no longer bear the sight of the Shield but order'd it should be remov'd for ever from his eyes It was not long after purchas'd by Dr Woodward who by the assistance of Mr Kemp incrusted it with a new Rust and is the same whereof a Cut hath been engraved and exhibited to the great Contentation of the learned  Cornelius now began to regulate the Suction of his Child Seldom did there pass a day without disputes between him and the Mother or the Nurse  concerning the nature of Aliment The poor woman never dined but he denied her some dish or other which he judg'd prejudicial to her milk One day she had a longing desire to a piece of beef and as she stretch'd her hand towards it the old gentleman drew it away and spoke to this effect  Had'st thou read the Ancients O Nurse thou would'st prefer the welfare of the Infant which thou nourishest to the indulging of an irregular and voracious Appetite Beef it is true may confer a Robustness on the limbs of my son but will hebetate and clogg his Intellectuals  While he spoke this the Nurse look'd upon him with much anger and now and then cast a wishful eye upon the Beef  Passion continu'd the Doctor still holding the dish throws the mind into too violent a fermentation it is a kind of Fever of the soul or as Horace expresses it a  Short Madness  Consider Woman that this day's Suction of my son may cause him to imbibe many ungovernable Passions and in a manner spoil him for the temper of a Philosopher Romulus  by sucking a Wolf became of a fierce and savage disposition and were I to breed some Ottoman Emperor or Founder of a Military Commonwealth perhaps I might indulge thee in this carnivorous Appetite  What interrupted the Nurse Beef spoil the understanding that's fine indeedhow then could our Parson preach as he does upon Beef and Pudding too if you go to that Don't tell me of your Ancients had not you almost kill'd the poor babe with a dish of Daemonial black Broth  Lacedemonian black Broth thou would'st say reply'd Cornelius but I cannot allow the surfeit to have been occasioned by that diet since it was recommended by the Divine Lycurgus No Nurse thou must certainly have eaten some meats of ill digestion the day before and that was the real cause of his disorder Consider Woman the different Temperaments of different Nations What makes the English Phlegmatick and melancholy but Beef what renders the Welch so hot and cholerick but cheese and leeks the French derive their levity from their  Soups Frogs and Mushrooms I would not let my Son dine like an Italian lest like an Italian he should be jealous and revengeful The warm and solid diet of Spain may be more beneficial as it might indue him with a profound Gravity but at the same time he might suck in with their food their intolerable Vice of Pride Therefore Nurse in short I hold it requisite to deny you at present not only Beef but likewise whatsoever any of those Nations eat  During this speech the Nurse remain'd pouting and marking her plate with the knife nor would she touch a bit during the whole dinner This the old Gentleman observing order'd that the Child to avoid the risque of imbibing ill humours should be kept from her breast all that day and be fed with Butter mix'd with Honey according to a Prescription he had met with somewhere in Eustathius upon Homer This indeed gave the Child a great looseness but he was not concern'd at it in the opinion that whatever harm it might do his body would be amply recompenced  by the improvements of his understanding But from thenceforth he insisted every day upon a particular Diet to be observed by the Nurse under which having been long uneasy she at last parted from the family on his ordering her for dinner the  Paps  of a  Sow  with Pig taking it as the highest indignity and a direct Insult upon her Sex and Calling  Four years of young Martin's life pass'd away in squabbles of this nature Mrs Scriblerus consider'd it was now time to instruct him in the fundamentals of Religion and to that end took no small pains in teaching him his  Catechism  But Cornelius look'd upon this as a tedious way of Instruction and therefore employ'd his head to find out more pleasing methods the better to induce him to be fond of learning He would frequently carry him to the  Puppetshow  of the Creation of the world where the Child with exceeding delight gain'd a notion of the History of the Bible His first rudiments in profane history were acquired by seeing  of  Rareeshows  where he was brought acquainted with all the Princes of Europe In short the old Gentleman so contriv'd it to make every thing contribute to the improvement of his knowledge even to his very Dress He invented for him a Geographical suit of cloaths which might give him some hints of that Science and likewise some knowledge of the Commerce of different Nations He had a French Hat with an African Feather Holland Shirts and Flanders Lace English Cloth lin'd with Indian Silk his Gloves were Italian and his Shoes were Spanish He was made to observe this and daily catechis'd thereupon which his Father was wont to call  Travelling at home  He never gave him a Fig or an Orange but he obliged him to give an account from what Country it came In Natural history he was much assisted by his Curiosity in  SignPosts  insomuch that he hath often confess'd he owed to them the knowledge of many Creatures which he never found since in any Author  such as White Lions Golden Dragons c He once thought the same of Green Men but had since found them mention'd by Kercherus and verify'd in the History of William of Newbury  Gul Neubrig Book i Ch  His disposition to the Mathematicks was discover'd very early by his drawing  Pascal's Life Locke of Educ c  parallel lines on his bread and butter and intersecting them at equal Angles so as to form the whole Superficies into squares But in the midst of all these Improvements a stop was put to his learning the  Alphabet  nor would he let him proceed to Letter D till he could truly and distinctly pronounce C in the ancient manner at which the Child unhappily boggled for near three months He was also oblig'd to delay his learning to  write  having turn'd away the Writing Master because he knew nothing of Fabius's Waxen Tables  Cornelius having read and seriously weigh'd the methods by which the famous Montaigne was educated and resolving in some degree to exceed them resolv'd he should speak and learn nothing but the learned Languages and especially the Greek in which he constantly eat and drank according to Homer But what most conduced to his easy attainment of this Language was his love of Gingerbread which his Father observing caused it to be stampt with the Letters of the Greek Alphabet and the child the very first day eat as far as Iota By this particular application to this language above the rest he attain'd so great a proficience therein that Gronovius ingenuously confesses he durst not confer with this child in Greek at eight years old and at fourteen he composed a Tragedy in the same language as the younger  Plin Epist Lib  Pliny had done before him  He learn'd the Oriental Languages of Erpenius who resided some time  with his father for that purpose He had so early a Relish for the Eastern way of writing that even at this time he composed in imitation of it the  Thousand and One Arabian Tales  and also the  Persian Tales  which have been since translated into several languages and lately into our own with particular elegance by Mr Ambrose Philips In this work of his Childhood he was not a little assisted by the historical Traditions of his  Nurse  CHAP V  A Dissertation upon Playthings  HERE follow the Instructions of Cornelius Scriblerus concerning the Plays and Playthings to be used by his son Martin  '  Play  was invented by the  Lydians  as a remedy against  Hunger  Sophocles says of Palamedes that he invented  Dice  to serve sometimes instead of a dinner It is therefore  wisely contrived by Nature that Children as they have the keenest  Appetites  are most addicted to  Plays  From the same cause and from the unprejudic'd and incorrupt simplicity of their minds it proceeds that the Plays of the Ancient Children are preserv'd more entire than any other of their Customs In this matter I would recommend to all who have any concern in my Son's Education that they deviate not in the least from the primitive and simple Antiquity  ' To speak first of the  Whistle  as it is the first of all Playthings I will have it exactly to correspond with the ancient  Fistula  and accordingly to be compos'd  septem paribus disjuncta cicutis  ' I heartily wish a diligent search may be made after the true  Crepitaculum  or  Rattle  of the Ancients for that as  Archytas Tarentinus  was of opinion kept the children from breaking Earthen Ware The  China  Cups in these days are not at all the safer for the modern  Rattles  which is an  evident proof how far their  Crepitacula  exceeded ours  ' I would not have Martin as yet to scourge a  Top  till I am better informed whether the  Trochus  which was recommended by  Cato  be really our present  Top  or rather the  Hoop  which the boys drive with a stick Neither  Cross  and  Pile  nor  Ducks  and  Drakes  are quite so ancient as  Handydandy  tho' Marcobius and St Augustine take notice of the first and Minutius Foelix describes the latter but  Handydandy  is mention'd by Aristotle Plato and Aristophanes  ' The Play which the Italians call  Cinque  and the French  Mourre  is extreamly ancient it was play'd at by  Hymen  and  Cupid  at the Marriage of  Psyche  and term'd by the Latins  digitis micare  ' Julius Pollux describes the  Omilla  or  Chuck farthing  tho' some will have our modern  Chuckfarthing  to be nearer the  Aphetinda  of the Ancients He also mentions the  Basilinda    or  King I am  and  Myinda  or  HoopersHide  ' But the  Chytindra  described by the same Author is certainly not our  Hotcockle  for that was by pinching and not by striking tho' there are good authors who affirm the  Rathapygismus  to be yet nearer the modern  Hotcockle  My son Martin may use either of them indifferently they being equally antique  '  Building of Houses  and  Riding upon Sticks  have been used by children in all ages  Aedificare casas equitare in arundine longa  Yet I must doubt whether the Riding upon Sticks did not come into use after the age of the  Centaurs  ' There is one Play which shews the gravity of ancient Education call'd the  Acinetinda  in which children contended who could longest  stand still  This we have suffer'd to perish entirely and if I might be allowed to guess it was certainly first lost among the  French  ' I will permit my Son to play at  Apodidiascinda  which can be no other than our  Puss in a Corner  ' Julius Pollux in his ninth book speaks of the  Melolouthe  or the  Kite  but I question whether the Kite of Antiquity was the same with ours And tho' the  or  Quailfighting  is what is most taken notice of they had doubtless  Cockmatches  also as is evident from certain ancient Gems and Relievo's  ' In a word let my son Martin disport himself at any Game truly Antique except one which was invented by a people among the Thracians who hung up one of their Companions in a Rope and gave him a Knife to cut himself down which if he fail'd in he was suffer'd to hang till he was dead and this was only reckon'd a sort of joke I am utterly against this as barbarous and cruel  ' I cannot conclude without taking notice of the beauty of the  Greek  names whose Etymologies acquaint  us with the nature of the sports and how infinitely both in sense and sound they excel our barbarous names of Plays  Notwithstanding the foregoing Injunctions of Dr Cornelius he yet condescended to allow the Child the use of some few modern Playthings such as might prove of any benefit to his mind by instilling an early notion of the sciences For example he found that  Marbles  taught him  Percussion  and the  Laws of Motion    Nutcrackers  the use of the  Leaver    Swinging  on the ends of a Board the  Balance    Bottlescrews  the  Vice    Whirligigs  the  Axis  and  Peritrochia    Birdcages  the  Pully  and  Tops  the  Centrifugal  motion  Others of his sports were farther carry'd to improve his tender soul even in Virtue and Morality We shall only instance one of the most useful and instructive  Bobcherry  which teaches at once two noble Virtues Patience and Constancy the first in adhering to the pursuit of one end the latter in bearing a disappointment  Besides all these he taught him as a diversion an odd and secret manner of  Stealing  according to the Custom of the Lacedaemonians wherein he succeeded so well that he practised it to the day of his death  CHAP VI  Of the  Gymnasticks  in what Exercises  Martinus  was educated something concerning  Musick  and what sort of a Man his Uncle was  NOR was Cornelius less careful in adhering to the rules of the purest Antiquity in relation to the  Exercises  of his Son He was stript powder'd and anointed but not constantly bath'd which occasion'd many heavy complaints of the Laundress about dirtying his linnen When he play'd at Quoits he was allow'd his Breeches and Stockings because the  Discoboli  as Cornelius well knew were naked  the middle only The Mother often  contended for modern Sports and common Customs but this was his constant reply  Let a Daughter be the care of her Mother but the Education of a Son should be the delight of his Father  It was about this time he heard to his exceeding content that the  Harpastus  of the Ancients was yet in use in  Cornwall  and known there by the name of  Hurling  He was sensible the common  Football  was a very imperfect imitation of that exercise and thought it necessary to send Martin into the West to be initiated in that truly ancient and manly part of the  Gymnasticks  The poor boy was so unfortunate as to return with a broken leg This Cornelius look'd upon but as a slight ailment and promis'd his Mother he would instantly cure it He slit a green Reed and cast the knife upward then tying the two parts of the Reed to the disjointed place pronounced these words  Pliny Hist Nat  lib  in fine  Carmen contra luxata membra eujus verba inserere non equidem serio ausim quanquam a Catone prodita  Vid Cato de re rust  c  Daries daries astataries    dissunapiter huat hanat huat ista pista fista domi abo damnaustra  But finding to his no small astonishment that this had no effect in five days he condescended to have it set by a modern Surgeon  Mrs Scriblerus to prevent him from exposing her Son to the like dangerous Exercises for the future propos'd to send for a DancingMaster and to have him taught the Minuet and Rigadoon  Dancing quoth Cornelius I much approve for  Socrates  said the best Dancers were the best Warriors but not those species of Dancing which you mention They are certainly Corruptions of the Comic and Satyric Dance which were utterly disliked by the sounder Ancients Martin shall learn the Tragic Dance only and I will send all over Europe till I find an Antiquary able to instruct him in the  Saltatio Pyrrhica  Scalig Poetic  l c  Hanc saltationem Pyrrhicam nos saepe diu jussu Bonifacii patrui coram Divo Maximiliano non sine stupore totius Germaniae repraesentavimus Quo tempore vox illa Imperatoris Hic puer out Thoracem pro pelle out pro cunis habuit  Scaliger    from whom my son is lineally descended boasts to have performed this warlike Dance in the Presence of the Emperor to the great admiration of all Germany What would he say could be look down and see one of his posterity so ignorant as not to know the least step of that noble kind of  Saltation  The poor Lady was at last enur'd to bear all these things with a laudable patience till one day her husband was seized with a new thought He had met with a saying that  '  Spleen    Garter  and  Girdle  are the three impediments to the  Cursus  '  Therefore Pliny lib xi cap says that such as excel in that exercise have their  Spleen  cauteriz'd  My son quoth Cornelius runs but heavily therefore I will have this operation performed upon him immediately Moreover it will cure that immoderate Laughter to which I perceive he is addicted For laughter as the same author hath it ibid is caused by the bigness of the Spleen  This design was no sooner hinted to Mrs Scriblerus but she burst into tears  wrung her hands and instantly sent to his Brother Albertus begging him for the love of God to make haste to her husband  Albertus was a discreet man sober in his opinions clear of Pedantry and knowing enough both in books and in the world to preserve a due regard for whatever was useful or excellent whether ancient or modern If he had not always the authority he had at least the art to divert Cornelius from many extravagancies It was well he came speedily or Martin could not have boasted the entire Quota of his Viscera  What does it signify quoth Albertus whether my Nephew excels in the  Cursus  or not Speed is often a symptom of Cowardice witness Hares and DeerDo not forget Achilles quoth Cornelius I know that Running has been condemn'd by the proud Spartans as useless in war and yet Demosthenes could say  a thought which the English Hudibras has well rendered    For he that runs may fight again    Which he can never do that's slain  That's true quoth Albertus but pray consider on the other side that Animals  Blackmore's Essay on Spleen  spleened grow extremely salacious an experiment well known in dogs  Cornelius was struck with this and reply'd gravely  If it be so I will defer the Operation for I will not encrease the powers of my son's body at the expence of those of his mind I am indeed disappointed in most of my projects and fear I must down at last contented with such methods of Education as modern barbarity affords Happy had it been for us all had we lived in the age of Augustus Then my son might have heard the Philosophers dispute in the Porticos of the Palestra and at the same time form'd his Body and his Understanding It is true reply'd Albertus we have no  Exedra  for the Philosophers adjoining to our TennisCourts but there are AleHouses where he will hear very notable  argumentations Tho' we come not up to the Ancients in the  Tragicdance  we excel them in the  or the art of  Tumbling The Ancients would have beat us at  Quoits  but not so much at the  Jaculum  or  pitching the Bar  The  FistyCuffs  Pugilatus  is in as great perfection in England as in old Rome and the  CornishHug  in the  Wrestling  Luctus  is equal to the  volutatoria  of the Ancients You could not answer'd Cornelius have produc'd a more unlucky instance of modern folly and barbarity than what you say of the  Jaculum  The  Arist politic lib cap  Cretians wisely forbid their servants Gymnasticks as well as Arms and yet your modern Footmen exercise themselves daily in the  Jaculum  at the corner of  HydePark  whist their enervated Lords are lolling in their chariots a species of Vectitation seldom us'd amongst the Ancients except by old Men You say well quoth Albertus and we have several other kinds of Vectitation unknown to the Ancients particularly flying Chariots where the people may  have the benefit of this exercise at the small expence of a farthing But suppose which I readily grant that the Ancients excel'd us almost in every thing yet why this singularity your son must take up with such masters as the present age affords we have Dancingmasters Writingmasters and Musickmasters  The bare mention of  Musick  threw Cornelius into a passion  How can you dignify quoth he this modern fidling with the name of Musick Will any of your best Hautboys encounter a Wolf now adays with no other arms but their instruments as did that ancient piper Pythocaris Have ever wild Boars Elephants Deer Dolphins Whales or Turbotts shew'd the least emotion at the most elaborate strains of your modern Scrapers all which have been as it were tam'd and humaniz'd by ancient Musicians Does not  Aelian Hist Animal lib xi cap and lib xii cap  Aelian tell us how the Lybian Mares were excited to horsing by Musick which ought in truth to be a caution to modest Women against frequenting Operas    and consider brother you are brought to this dilemma either to give up the virtue of the Ladies or the power of your Musick Whence proceeds the degeneracy of our Morals Is it not from the loss of ancient Musick by which says Aristotle they taught all the Virtues Else might we turn Newgate into a College of Dorian Musicians who should teach moral Virtues to those People Whence comes it that our present diseases are so stubborn whence is it that I daily deplore my Sciatical pains Alas because we have lost their true cure by the melody of the Pipe All this was well known to the Ancients as  Athenaeus lib xiv  Theophrastus assures us whence  Lib de sanitat tuend cap  Caelius calls it  loca dolentia decantare  only indeed some small remains of this skill is preserved in the cure of the Tarantula Did not  Quintilian lib cap  Pythagoras stop a company of drunken Bullies from storming a civil house by changing the strain of the Pipe to the sober Spondaeus and yet your modern Musicians want art to defend their windows  from common Nickers It is well known that when the Lacedaemonian Mob were up they  Suidas in Timotheo  commonly sent for a Lesbian Musician to appease them and they immediately grew calm as soon as they heard Terpander sing Yet I don't believe that the Pope's whole band of Musick though the best of this age could keep his Holiness's Image from being burnt on a fifth of November Nor would Terpander himself replyed Albertus at Billing sgate nor Timotheus at Hockley in the Hole have any manner of effect nor both of 'em together bring  Horneck a scurrilous Scribler who wrote a weekly paper called  the High German Doctor  Horneck to common civility That's a gross mistake said Cornelius very warmly and to prove it so I have here a small Lyra of my own fram'd strung and tun'd after the ancient manner I can play some fragments of Lesbian tunes and I wish I were to try them upon the most passionate creatures aliveYou never had a better opportunity says Albertus for yonder are two applewomen scolding and just  ready to uncoif one another  With that Cornelius undress'd as he was jumps out into his Balcony his Lyra in hand in his slippers with his breeches hanging down to his ankles a stocking upon his head and a waistcoat of murreycolour'd sattin upon his body He touch'd his Lyra with a very unusual sort of an Harpegiatura nor were his hopes frustrated The odd Equipage the uncouth Instrument the strangeness of the Man and of the Musick drew the ears and eyes of the whole Mob that were got about the two female Champions and at last of the Combatants themselves They approach'd the Balcony in as close attention as Orpheus's first Audience of Cattle or that of an Italian Opera when some favourite Air is just awaken'd This sudden effect of his Musick encouraged him mightily and it was observ'd he never touch'd his Lyre in such a truly chromatick and enharmonick manner as upon that occasion The mob laugh'd sung jump'd danc'd and us'd many odd gestures all which he  judg'd to be caused by his various strains and modulations  Mark quoth he in this the power of the Ionian in that you see the effect of the Aeolian  But in a little time they began to grow riotous and threw stones Cornelius then withdrew but with the greatest air of Triumph in the world  Brother said he do you observe I have mixed unawares too much of the  Phrygian  I might change it to the  Lydian  and soften their riotous tempers But it is enough learn from this Sample to speak with veneration of ancient Musick If this Lyre in my unskilful hands can perform such wonders what must it not have done in those of a Timotheus or a Terpander  Having said this he retir'd with the utmost Exultation in himself and Contempt of his Brother and it is said behav'd that night with such unusual haughtiness to his family that they all had reason to wish for some ancient Tibicen to calm his Temper  CHAP VII  Rhetorick Logick and Metaphysicks  COrnelius having as hath been said many ways been disappointed in his attempts of improving the bodily Forces of his son thought it now high time to apply to the Culture of his Internal faculties He judg'd it proper in the first place to instruct him in  Rhetorick  But herein we shall not need to give the Reader any account of his wonderful progress since it is already known to the learned world by his Treatise on this subject I mean the admirable Discourse  which he wrote at this time but conceal'd from his Father knowing his extreme partiality for the Ancients It lay by him conceal'd and perhaps forgot among the great multiplicity of other Writings till about the year he sent it us to be printed with many additional examples drawn from the excellent live  Poets of this present age We proceed therefore to  Logick  and  Metaphysick  The wise Cornelius was convinced that these being  Polemical  Arts could no more be learned alone than Fencing or Cudgelplaying He thought it therefore necessary to look out for some Youth of pregnant parts to be a sort of humble Companion to his son in those studies His good fortune directed him to one of most singular endowments whose name was Conradus Crambe who by the father's side was related to the  Crouches  of Cambridge and his mother was Cousin to Mr  Swan  Gamester and Punster of the City of London So that from both parents he drew a natural disposition to sport himself with  Words  which as they are said to be the counters of wise Men and readymoney of Fools Crambe had great store of cash of the latter sort Happy Martin in such a Parent and such a Companion What might not he atchieve in Arts and Sciences  Here I must premise a general observation of great benefit to mankind  That there are many people who have the use only of one Operation of the Intellect tho' like shortsighted men they can hardly discover it themselves They can form  single apprehensions  but have neither of the other two faculties the  judicium  or  discursus  Now as it is wisely order'd that people depriv'd of one sense have the others in more perfection such people will form single Ideas with a great deal of vivacity and happy were it indeed if they would confine themselves to such without forming  judicia  much less  argumentations  Cornelius quickly discover'd that these two last operations of the intellect were very weak in Martin and almost totally extinguish'd in Crambe however he used to say that Rules of Logick are Spectacles to a purblind understanding and therefore he resolv'd to proceed with his two Pupils  Martin's understanding was so totally immers'd in  sensible objects  that he demanded examples from Material things of the abstracted Ideas of Logick  As for Crambe he contented himself with the Words and when he could but form some conceit upon them was fully satisfy'd Thus Crambe would tell his Instructor that All men were not  singular  that Individuality could hardly be praedicated of any man for it was commonly said that a man  is  not the same he  was  that madmen are  beside themselves  and drunken men  come to themselves  which shows that few men have that most valuable logical endowment Individuality Cornelius told Martin that a shoulder of mutton was an individual which Crambe deny'd for he had seen it cut into commons That's true quoth the Tutor but you never saw it cut into shoulders of mutton If it could quoth Crambe it would be the most lovely individual of the University When he was told a  substance  was that which was  subject to accidents  then Soldiers quoth Crambe are the most substantial people in the World Neither would he allow it to be a good definition of  accident  that it could be  present or absent without the destruction of the subject  since there are a great many accidents that destroy the subject as burning does a house and death a man But as to that Cornelius informed him that there was a  natural death  and  a logical death  that though a man after his natural death was not capable of the least parishoffice yet he might still keep his Stall amongst the logical praedicaments  Cornelius was forc'd to give Martin sensible images thus calling up the Coachman he ask'd him what he had seen at the Beargarden the man answer'd he saw two men fight a prize one was a fair man a Sergeant in the Guards the other black a Butcher the Sergeant had red breeches the Butcher blue they fought upon a Stage about four o'clock and the Sergeant wounded the Butcher in the leg  Mark quoth Cornelius how the fellow runs through the praedicaments Men  Substantia  two  quantitas  fair and black  qualitas  Sergeant and Butcher  relatio  wounded the other  actio passio  fighting    situs  Stage  ubi  two a Clock  quando  blue and red Breeches  habitus At the same time he warn'd Martin that what he now  learn'd  as a Logician he must  forget  as a natural Philosopher that tho' he now taught them that accidents inher'd in the subject they would find in time there was no such thing and that colour taste smell heat and cold were not in the things but only phantasms of our brains He was forc'd to let them into this secret for Martin could not conceive how a habit of dancing inher'd in a dancingmaster when he did not dance nay he would demand the Characteristicks of Relations Crambe us'd to help him out by telling him a Cuckold a losing gamester a man that had not din'd a young heir that was kept short by his father might be all known by their countenance that in this last case the Paternity and Filiation leave very sensible impressions in the  relatum  and  correlatum  The greatest difficulty was when they came to the Tenth Praedicament Crambe affirmed that his  Habitus  was more a substance than he was for his cloaths could better subsist without him than he without his cloaths  Martin suppos'd an  Universal Man  to be like a Knight of a Shire or a Burgess of a Corporation that represented a great many Individuals His Father ask'd him if he could not frame the Idea of an Universal Lord Mayor Martin told him that never having seen but one Lord Mayor the Idea of that Lord Mayor always return'd to his mind that he had great difficulty to abstract a Lord Mayor from his Fur Gown and Gold Chain nay that the horse he saw the Lord Mayor ride upon not a little disturb'd his imagination On the other hand Crambe to show himself of a more penetrating genius swore that he could frame a conception of a Lord Mayor not only without his Horse Gown and Gold Chain but even without Stature Feature Colour Hands Head Feet or any Body which he suppos'd was the abstract of a Lord Mayor Cornelius told him  that he was a lying Rascal that an  Universale  was not the object of imagination and that there was no such thing in reality or  a parte Rei  But I can prove quoth Crambe that there are  Clysters a parte Rei  but  clysters  are  universales    ergo  Thus I prove my Minor  Quod aptum est inesse multis  is an  universale  by definition but every clyster before it is administred has that quality therefore every clyster is an  universale  He also found fault with the Advertisements that they were not strict logical  definitions  In an advertisement of a Dog stol'n or stray'd he said it ought to begin thus  An irrational animal  of the  Genus caninum  c Cornelius told them that though those advertisements were not fram'd according to the exact rules of logical definitions being only  descriptions  of things  numero differentibus  yet they contain'd a faint image of the  praedicabilia  and were highly subservient to the common purposes of life often discovering things that were lost both animate and inanimate  An Italian Greybound of a mousecolour a white speck in the neck lame of one leg belongs to such a Lady  Greyhound  Genus  mousecolour'd c  differentia  lame of one leg  accidents  belongs to such a Lady  proprium  Though I'm afraid I have transgress'd upon my Reader's patience already I cannot help taking notice of one thing more extraordinary than any yet mention'd which was Crambe's  Treatise of Syllogisms  He suppos'd that a Philosopher's brain was like a great Forest where Ideas rang'd like animals of several kinds that those Ideas copulated and engender'd Conclusions that when those of different Species copulate they bring forth monsters or absurdities that the  Major  is the male the  Minor  the female which copulate by the Middle Term and engender the Conclusion Hence they are call'd the  praemissa  or  Predecessors  of the Conclusion and it is properly said by Logicians  quod pariunt scientiam    opinionem  they  beget  science opinion c Universal  Propositions are Persons of quality and therefore in Logick they are said to be of the first  Figure  Singular Propositions are Private persons and therefore plac'd in the third or last figure or rank From those principles all the rules of Syllogisms naturally follow  I That there are only three Terms neither more nor less for to a child there can be only one father and one mother  II From universal premisses there follows an universal conclusion as if one should say that persons of quality always beget persons of quality  III From singular premisses follows only a singular conclusion that is if the parents be only private people the issue must be so likewise  IV From particular propositions nothing can be concluded because the  Individua vaga  are like whoremasters and common strumpets barren  V There cannot be more in the conclusion than was in the premisses that is children can only inherit from their parents  VI The conclusion follows the weaker part that is children inherit the diseases of their parents  VII From two negatives nothing can be concluded for from divorce or separation there can come no issue  VIII The medium cannot enter the conclusion that being logical incest  IX An hypothetical proposition is only a contract or a promise of marriage from such therefore there can spring no real issue  X When the premisses or parents are necessarily join'd or in lawful wedlock they beget lawful issue but contingently join'd they beget bastards  So much for the Affirmative propositions the Negative must be defer'd to another occasion  Crambe us'd to value himself upon this System from whence he said one  might see the propriety of the expression  such a one has a barren imagination  and how common it is for such people to  adopt  conclusions that are not the issue of their premisses therefore as an Absurdity is a  Monster  a Falsity is a  Bastard  and a true conclusion that followeth not from the premisses may properly be said to be  adopted  But then what is an Enthymem quoth Cornelius Why an Enthymem reply'd Crambe is when the Major is indeed married to the Minor but the Marriage  kept secret  METAPHYSICKS were a large field in which to exercise the Weapons  Logick  had put into their hands Here Martin and Crambe us'd to engage like any prize fighters before their Father and his other Learned companions of the Symposiacks And as Prize fighters will agree to lay aside a buckler or some such defensive weapon so would Crambe promise not to use  simpliciter secundum quid  provided Martin would part with  materialiter formaliter  But it was found that without  the help of the defensive armour of those Distinctions the arguments cut so deep that they fetch'd blood at every stroke Their  Theses  was pick'd out of Suarez Thomas Aquinas and other learned writers on those subjects I shall give the Reader a taste of some of them  I If the Innate Desire of the knowledge of Metaphysicks was the cause of the Fall of Adam and the  Arbor Porphyriana  the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil  affirm'd  II If transcendental goodness could be truly praedicated of the Devil  affirm'd  III Whether one or many be first or if one doth not suppose the notion of many  Suarez  IV If the desire of news in mankind be  appetitus innatus  not  elicitus affirm'd  V Whether there is in human understandings potential falsities  affirm'd  VI Whether God loves a  possible Angel  better than an  actuallyexistent flye deny'd  VII If Angels pass from one extreme to another without going through the middle  Aquinas  VIII If Angels know things more clearly in a morning  Aquinas  IX Whether every Angel hears what one Angel says to another  deny'd    Aquinas  X If temptation be  proprium quarto modo  of the Devil  deny'd Aquinas  XI Whether one Devil can Illuminate another  Aquin  XII If there would have been any females born in the state of Innocence  Aquinas  XIII If the Creation was finish'd in six days because six is the most perfect number or if six be the most perfect number because the Creation was finished in six days  Aquinas  There were several others of which in the course of the life of this learned person we may have occasion to treat and one particularly that remains undecided to this day it was taken from the learned Suarez  XIV  An praeter esse  reale  actualis essentiae sit aliud  esse necessarium  quo res actualiter existat  In English thus Whether besides the real being of actual being there be any other being necessary to cause a thing to be  This brings into my mind a Project to banish Metaphysicks out of Spain which was suppos'd might be effectuated by this method That nobody should use any Compound or Decompound of the Substantial Verbs but as they are read in the common conjugations for every body will allow that if you debar a Metaphysician from  ens    essentia    entitas    subsistentia  c there is an end of him  Crambe regretted extremely that  Substantial Forms  a race of harmless beings which had lasted for many years and afforded a comfortable subsistance to many poor Philosophers should be now hunted down like so many Wolves without the possibility of a retreat He consider'd that it had gone much harder with them than with  Essences    which had retir'd from the  Schools  into the  Apothecaries Shops  where some of them had been advanc'd into the degree of  Quintessences  He thought there should be a retreat for poor  substantial Forms  amongst the Gentleushers at court and that there were indeed  substantial forms  such as  forms of Prayer  and  forms of Government  without which the things themselves could neyer long subsist He also us'd to wonder that there was not a reward for such as could find out a  fourth Figure  in  Logick  as well as for those who shou'd discover the  Longitude  CHAP VIII  ANATOMY  COrnelius it is certain had a most superstitious veneration for the Ancients and if they contradicted each other his Reason was so pliant and ductile that he was always of the opinion of the last he read But he reckon'd it a point of honour never to be vanquish'd in a dispute from  which quality he acquir'd the title of the  Invincible Doctor  While the Professor of Anatomy was demonstrating to his son the several kinds of  Intestines  Cornelius affirm'd that there were only two the  Colon  and the  Aichos  according to Hippocrates who it was impossible could ever be mistaken It was in vain to assure him this error proceeded from want of accuracy in dividing the whole Canal of the Guts Say what you please he reply'd this is both mine and Hippocrates's opinion You may with equal reason answer'd the Professor affirm that a man's Liver hath five Lobes and deny the Circulation of the blood Ocular demonstration said Cornelius seems to be on your side yet I shall not give it up Show me any viscus of a human body and I will bring you a Monster that differs from the common rule in the structure of it If Nature shews such variety in the same age why may she not have extended it further in several ages Produce me a man now of the age of an Antidiluvian of the strength  of Sampson or the size of the Giants If in the whole why not in parts of the body may it not be possible the present generation of men may differ from the Ancients The Moderns have perhaps lengthen'd the channel of the guts by Gluttony and diminish'd the liver by hard drinking Though it shall be demonstrated that modern blood circulates yet I will still believe with Hippocrates that the blood of the Ancients had a flux and reflux from the heart like a Tide Consider how Luxury hath introduced new diseases and with them not improbably alter'd the whole Course of the Fluids Consider how the current of mighty Rivers nay the very channels of the Ocean are changed from what they were in ancient days and can we be so vain to imagine that the Microcosm of the human body alone is exempted from the fate of all things I question not but plausible Conjectures may be made even as to the Time when the blood first began to circulateSuch disputes as these frequently perplex'd the  Professor to that degree that he would now and then in a passion leave him in the middle of a Lecture as he did at this time  There unfortunately happen'd soon after an unusual accident which retarded the prosecution of the studies of Martin Having purchased the body of a Malefactor he hir'd a Room for its dissection near the Pestfields in St Giles's at a little distance from Tyburn Road Crambe to whose care this body was committed carry'd it thither about twelve a clock at night in a Hackneycoach few Housekeepers being very willing to let their lodgings to such kind of Operators As he was softly stalking up stairs in the dark with the dead man in his arms his burthen had like to have slipp'd from him which he to save from falling grasp'd so hard about the belly that it forced the wind through the  Anus  with a noise exactly like the  Crepitus  of a living man Crambe who did not comprehend how this part of the Animal Oeconomy could remain in a dead man was so terrify'd  that he threw down the body ran up to his master and had scarce breath to tell him what had happen'd Martin with all his Philosophy could not prevail upon him to return to his post You may say what you please quoth Crambe no man alive ever broke wind more naturally nay he seemed to be mightily relieved by it The rolling of the corps down stairs made such a noise that it awak'd the whole house The maid shriek'd the landlady cry'd out Thieves but the Landlord in his shirt as he was taking a candle in one hand and a drawn sword in the other ventur'd out of the Room The maid with only a single petticoat ran up stairs but spurning at the dead body fell upon it in a swoon Now the Landlord stood still and list'ned then he look'd behind him and ventur'd down in this manner one stair after another 'till he came where lay his maid as dead upon another corps unknown The wife ran into the street and cry'd out Murder the Watch ran in while Martin and Crambe hearing all this uproar  were coming down stairs The Watch imagin'd they were making their escape seiz'd them immediately and carried them to a neighbouring Justice where upon searching them several kind of knives and dreadful weapons were found upon them The Justice first examin'd Crambe What is your Name says the Justice I have acquir'd quoth Crambe no great Name as yet they call me Crambe or Crambo no matter which as to my self though it may be some dispute to posterityWhat is yours and your Masters profession  It is our business to imbrue our hands in blood we cut off the heads and pull out the hearts of those that never injur'd us we rip up bigbelly'd women and tear children limb from limb  Martin endeavour'd to interrupt him but the Justice being strangely astonish'd with the frankness of Crambe's Confession order'd him to proceed upon which he made the following Speech  May it please your Worship as touching the body of this man I can answer each head that my accusers alledge against  me to a hair They have hitherto talk'd like numsculls without brains but if your Worship will not only give ear but regard me with a favourable eye I will not be browbeaten by the supercilious looks of my adversaries who now stand cheek by jowl by your Worship I will prove to their faces that their foul mouths have not open'd their lips without a falsity though they have shewed their teeth as if they would bite off my nose Now Sir that I may fairly slip my Neck out of the collar I beg this matter may not be slightly skin'd over Tho' I have no man here to back me I will unbosom my self since Truth is on my side and shall give them their bellies full though they think they have me upon the hip Whereas they say I came into their lodgings with arms and murder'd this man without their Privity I declare I had not the least Finger in it and since I am to stand upon my own legs nothing of this matter shall be left till I set it upon a right foot In the vein I am in I cannot for my heart's blood and guts bear this usage I shall not spare my  lungs to defend my good name I was ever reckon'd a good liver and I think I have the bowels of compassion I ask but justice and from the crown of my head to the soal of my foot I shall ever acknowledge my self your Worship's humble Servant  The Justice stared the Landlord and Landlady lifted up their eyes and Martin fretted while Crambe talk'd in this rambling incoherent manner till at length Martin begg'd to be heard It was with great difficulty that the Justice was convinc'd till they sent for the Finisher of human laws of whom the Corps had been purchas'd who looking near the left ear knew his own work and gave Oath accordingly  No sooner was Martin got home but he fell into a passion at Crambe  What Daemon he cry'd hath possessed thee that thou will never forsake that impertinent custom of punning Neither my council nor my example have thus misled thee thou governest thy self by most erroneous Maxims  Far from it answers Crambe my life is as orderly as my  Dictionary for by my Dictionary I order my life I have made a Kalendar of radical words for all the seasons months and days of the year Every day I am under the dominion of a certain Word but this day in particular I cannot be misled for I am govern'd by one that rules all sexes ages conditions nay all animals rational and irrational Who is not govern'd by the word  Led  Our Noblemen and Drunkards are pimpled Physicians and Pulses feeled their Patients and Oranges pilled a Newmarried Man and an Ass are brideled an Oldmarried Man and a Packhorse sadled Cats and Dice are ratled Swine and Nobility are styled a Coquet and a Tinderbox are sparkled a Lover and a Blunderer are groveled And that I may not be tediousWhich thou art reply'd Martin stamping with his foot which thou art I say beyond all human tolerationSuch an unnatural unaccountable uncoherent unintelligible unprofitableThere it is now interrupted Crambe this is your Day for  Uns  Martin could bear no longerhowever composing his Countenance Come hitherhe cry'd there are five pounds seventeen shillings and nine pence thou hast been with me eight months three weeks two days and four hours Poor Crambe upon the receipt of his Salary fell into tears flung the money upon the ground and burst forth in these words  O Cicero Cicero if to pun be a crime 'tis a crime I have learned from thee O Bias Bias if to pun be a crime by thy example was I bias'd  Whereupon Martin considering that one of the greatest of Orators and even a Sage of Greece had punned hesitted relented and reinstated Crambe in his Service  CHAP IX  How  Martin  become a grat Critick  IT was a most peculiar Talent in Martinus to convert every Trifle into a serious thing either in the way  of Life or in Learning This can no way be better exemplify'd than in the effect which the Puns of Crambe had on the Mind and Studies of Martinus He conceiv'd that somewhat of a like Talent to this of Crambe of  assembling parallel sounds  either  syllables  or  words  might conduce to the Emendation and Correction of  Ancient Authors  if apply'd to their Works with the same  diligence  and the same  liberty  He resolv'd to try first upon Virgil Horace and Terence concluding that if the  most correct  Authors could be so served with any reputation to the Critick the amendment and alteration of  all the rest  wou'd easily follow whereby a new a vast nay boundless Field of Glory would be open'd to the true and  absolute Critick  This Specimen on Virgil he has given us in the Addenda to his Notes on the Dunciad His Terence and Horace are in every bodies hands under the names of Richard B  ley and Francis H  re And we have convincing proofs that the late Edition of Milton  publish'd in the name of the former of these was in truth the Work of no other than our Scriblerus  CHAP X  Of  Martinus  's Uncommon Practice of  Physick  and how he apply'd himself to the  Diseases  of the  Mind  BUT it is high time to return to the History of the Progress of Martinus in the Studies of Physick and to enumerate some at least of the many Discoveries and Experiments he made therein  One of the first was his Method of investigating latent Distempers by the sagacious Quality of  SettingDogs  and  Pointers  The Success and the Adventures that besel him when he walk'd with these Animals to smell them out in the Parks and publick places about London are what we would willingly relate but that his own Account together with a  List of those Gentlemen  and Ladies  at whom they made a  Full Sett  will be publish'd in time convenient There will also be added the Representation which on occasion of one distemper which was become almost epidemical he thought himself oblig'd to lay before both Houses of Parliament intitled  A Proposal for a General Flux  to exterminate at one blow the P  x out of this kingdom  He next proceeded to an Enquiry into the  Nature  and  Tokens  of  Virginity  according to the Jewish Doctrines which occasion'd that most curious Treatise of the  Purification  of  Vid Esther chap vers  Queen Esther  with a  Display  of her  Case  at large speedily also to be published  But being weary of all practice on  foetid Bodies  from a certain niceness of Constitution especially when he attended Dr Woodward thro' a Twelvemonths course of Vomition he determined to leave it off entirely and to apply himself only to diseases of the  Mind  He attempted to find out Specificks for  all the  Passions  and as other Physicians throw their Patients into sweats vomits purgations c he cast them into Love hatred hope fear joy grief c And indeed the great Irregularity of the Passions in the English Nation was the chief motive that induced him to apply his whole studies while he continued among us to the Diseases of the Mind  To this purpose he directed in the first place his late acquir'd skill in  Anatomy  He consider'd  Virtues  and  Vices  as certain Habits which proceed from the natural Formation and Structure of particular parts of the body A Bird flies because it has Wings a Duck swims because it is webfooted and there can be no question but the Aduncity of the pounces and beaks of the Hawks as well as the length of the fangs the sharpness of the teeth and the strength of the crural and Massetermuscles in Lions and Tygers are the cause of the great and habitual Immorality of those Animals  Ist He observ'd that the Soul and Body mutually operate upon each other and therefore if you deprive the Mind of the outward Instruments whereby she usually expresseth that Passion you will in time abate the Passion itself in like manner as Castration abates Lust  dly That the Soul in mankind expresseth every Passion by the Motion of some particular  Muscles  dly That all Muscles grow stronger and thicker by being  much us'd  therefore the habitual Passions may be discerned in particular persons by the  strength  and  bigness  of the Muscles us'd in the expression of that Passion  thly That a Muscle may be strengthen'd or weakn'd by weakning or strength'ning the force of its Antagonist These things premis'd he took notice  That  Complaisance    humility    assent    approbation  and  civility  were express'd by nodding the head and bowing the body forward on the contrary  dissent    dislike    refusal    pride  and  arrogance    were mark'd by tossing the head and bending the body backwards which two Passions of  assent  and  dissent  the Latins rightly express'd by the words  adnuere  and  abnuere  Now he observ'd that complaisant and civil people had the Flexors of the head very strong but in the proud and insolent there was a great overbalance of strength in the Extensors of the Neck and the Muscles of the Back from whence they perform with great facility the motion of  tossing  but with great difficulty that of  bowing  and therefore have justly acquir'd the Title of  stiffneck'd  In order to reduce such persons to a just balance he judg'd that the pair of Muscles call'd  Recti interni  the Mastoidal with other flexors of the head neck and body must be strengthen'd their Antagonists the  Splenii Complexi  and the Extensors of the Spine weaken'd For which purpose Nature herself seems to have directed mankind to correct this Muscular Immorality by tying such fellows  Neckandheels  Contrary to this is the pernicious Custom of Mothers who abolish the natural Signature of Modesty in their Daughters by teaching them  tossing  and  bridling  rather than the bashful posture of  stooping  and  hanging down the head  Martinus charg'd all husbands to take notice of the  Posture of the Head  of such as they courted to Matrimony as that upon which their future happiness did much depend  Flatterers  who have the flexor Muscles so strong that they are always bowing and cringing he suppos'd might in some measure be corrected by being ty'd down upon a Tree by the back like the children of the Indians which doctrine was strongly confirm'd by his observing the strength of the  levatores Scapulae  This Muscle is call'd the Muscle of  patience  because in that affection of Mind people shrug and raise up the shoulder to the tip of the ear This Muscle also he observed to be exceedingly strong and large in  Henpeck'd Husbands  in  Italians  and in  English Ministers  In pursuance of his Theory he suppos'd the  Constrictors  of the  Eyelids  must be strengthen'd in the supercilious the  abductors  in drunkards and contemplative men who have the same steddy and grave motion of the eye That the  buccinatores  or blowers up of the  cheeks  and the  dilators  of the  Nose  were too strong in Cholerick people and therefore Nature here again directed us to a remedy which was to correct such extraordinary dilatation by  pulling by the Nose  The rolling amorous Eye in the Passion of Love might be corrected by frequently looking thro' glasses Impertinent fellows that jump upon Tables and cut capers might be cur'd by relaxing medicines apply'd to the  Calves  of their  legs  which in such people are too strong  But there were two Cases which he reckon'd extremely difficult First  Affectation  in which there were so many Muscles of the bum thighs belly neck back and the whole body all  in a false tone that it requir'd an impracticable multiplicity of applications  The second case was immoderate  Laughter  When any of that risible species were brought to the Doctor and when he consider'd what an infinity of Muscles these laughing Rascals threw into a convulsive motion at the same time whether we regard the spasms of the Diaphragm and all the muscles of respiration the horrible  rictus  of the mouth the distortion of the lower jaw the crisping of the nose twinkling of the eyes or sphaerical convexity of the cheeks with the tremulous succussion of the whole human body when he consider'd I say all this he used to cry out  Casus plane deplorabilis  and give such Patients over  CHAP XI  The Case of a young Nobleman at Court with the Doctor's Prescription for the same  AN eminent Instance of Martinus's Sagacity in discovering the Distempers of the Mind appear'd in the case of a young Nobleman at Court who was observ'd to grow extremely affected in his speech and whimsical in all his behaviour He began to ask odd questions talk in verse to himself shut himself up from his friends and be accessible to none but Flatterers Poets and Pickpockets till his Relations and old Acquaintance judged him to be so far gone as to be a fit Patient for the Doctor  As soon as he had heard and examined all the symptoms he pronounced his distemper to be  Love  His friends assured him that they had with great care observ'd all his motions  and were perfectly satisfy'd there was no Woman in the case Scriblerus was as positive that he was desperately in love with some person or other  How can that be said his Aunt who came to ask the advice when he converses almost with none but himself  Say you so he replied why then he is in love with Himself one of the most common cases in the world I am astonish'd people do not enough attend this Disease which has the same causes and symptoms and admits of the same cure with the other especially since here the case of the Patient is the more helpless and deplorable of the two as this unfortunate passion is more blind than the other There are people who discover from their very youth a most amorous inclination to themselves which is unhappily nurs'd by such Mothers as with their good will wou'd never suffer their children to be  cross'd in love  Ease luxury and idleness blow up this flame as well as the other Constant opportunities of conversation with the person beloved the greatest  of incentives are here impossible to be prevented Bawds and Pimps in the other love will be perpetually doing kind offices speaking a good word for the party and carry about Billet doux Therefore I ask you Madam if this Gentleman has not been much frequented by Flatterers and a sort of people who bring him dedications and verses  O Lord Sir quoth the Aunt the house is haunted with them  There it is reply'd Scriblerus those are the bawds and pimps that go between a man and himself Are there no civil Ladies that tell him he dresses well has a gentlemanly air and the like  Why truly Sir my Nephew is not aukward  Look you Madam this is a misfortune to him In former days these sort of lovers were happy in one respect that they never had any Rivals but of late they have all the Ladies soBe pleased to answer a few questions more Whom does he generally talk of Himself quoth the Aunt Whose wit and breeding does he most commend His own quoth the Aunt  Whom does he write letters to Himself Whom does he dream of All the dreams I ever heard were of himself Whom is he ogling yonder Himself in his lookingglass Why does he throw back his head in that languishing posture Only to be blest with a smile of himself as he passes by Does he ever steal a kiss from himself by biting his lips  Oh continually till they are perfect vermilion  Have you observ'd him to use Familiarities with any body  With none but himself he often embraces himself with folded arms he claps his hand often upon his hip nay sometimes thrusts it intohis breast  Madam said the Doctor all these are strong symptoms but there remain a few more Has this amorous gentleman presented himself with any Lovetoys such as gold Snuffboxes repeating Watches or Tweezercases those are things that in time will soften the most obdurate heart  Not only so said the Aunt but he bought the other day a very fine brilliant diamond Ring for his own wearing  Nay if he has accepted  of this Ring the intrigue is very forward indeed and it is high time for friends to interpose Pray Madam a word or two moreIs he jealous that his acquaintance do not behave themselves with respect enough will he bear jokes and innocent freedoms  By no means a familiar appellation makes him angry if you shake him a little roughly by the hand he is in a rage but if you chuck him under the chin he will return you a box on the ear  Then the case is plain he has the true Pathognomick sign of Love  Jealously  for no body will suffer his mistress to be treated at that rate Madam upon the whole this Case is extreamly dangerous There are some people who are far gone in this passion of selflove but then they keep a  very secret Intrigue  with themselves and hide it from all the world besides But this Patient has not the least care of the Reputation of his Beloved he is downright scandalous in his behaviour with himself he is enchanted bewitch'd and almost  past cure However let the following methods be try'd upon him  First let him ***  Hiatus  *** Secondly let him wear a Bobwig Thirdly shun the Company of flatterers nay of ceremonious people and of all Frenchmen in general It would not be a miss if he travel'd over England in a Stagecoach and made the Tour of Holland in a Trackscoute Let him return the Snuffboxes Tweezercases and particularly the Diamond Ring which he has receiv'd from himself Let some knowing friend represent to him the many vile Qualities of this Mistress of his let him be shewn that her Extravagance Pride and Prodigality will infallibly bring him to a morsel of bread Let it be prov'd that he has been False to himself and if Treachery is not a sufficient cause to discard a Mistress what is In short let him be made to see that no mortal besides himself either loves or can suffer this Creature Let all Lookingglasses polish'd Toys and even clean Plates beremoved from him  for fear of bringing back the admired object Let him be taught to put off all those tender airs affected smiles languishing looks wanton tosses of the head coy motions of the body that mincing gait soft tone of voice and all that enchanting womanlike behaviour that has made him the charm of his own eyes and the object of his own adoration Let him surprize the Beauty he adores at a disadvantage survey himself naked divested of artificial charms and he will find himself a forked stradling Animal with bandy legs a short neck a dun hide and a potbelly It would be yet better if he took a strong purge once a week in order to contemplate himself in that condition at which time it will be convenient to make use of the Letters Dedications c abovesaid Something like this has been observ'd by Lucretius and others to be a powerful remedy in the case of Women If all this will not do I must e'en leave the poor man to his destiny Let him  marry himself  and when he is condemn'd eternally to  himself perhaps he may run to the next pond to get rid of himself the Fate of most violent Selflovers  CHAP XII  How  Martinus  endeavoured to find out the  Seat  of the  Soul  and of his Correspondence with the  FreeThinkers  IN this Design of Martin to investigate the Diseases of the Mind he thought nothing so necessary as an Enquiry after the  Seat  of the  Soul  in which at first he labour'd under great uncertainties Sometimes he was of opinion that it lodg'd in the Brain sometimes in the Stomach and sometimes in the Heart Afterwards he thought it absurd to confine that sovereign Lady to one apartment which made him infer that she shifted it according to the several functions of life The Brain was her Study the Heart her Stateroom and the Stomach her Kitchen But as he saw several Offices  of life went on at the same time he was forc'd to give up this Hypothesis also He now conjectured it was more for the dignity of the Soul to perform several operations by her little Ministers the  Animal Spirits  from whence it was natural to conclude that she resides in different parts according to different Inclinations Sexes Ages and Professions Thus in Epicures he seated her in the mouth of the Stomach Philosophers have her in the Brain Soldiers in their Heart Women in their Tongues Fidlers in their Fingers and Ropedancers in their Toes At length he grew fond of the  Glandula Pinealis  dissecting many Subjects to find out the different Figure of this Gland from whence he might discover the cause of the different Tempers in mankind He suppos'd that in factious and restlessspirited people he should find it sharp and pointed allowing no room for the Soul to repose herself that in quiet Tempers it was flat smooth and soft affording to the Soul as it were an easy cushion He was confirm'd in this by  observing that Calves and Philosophers Tygers and Statesmen Foxes and Sharpers Peacocks and Fops CockSparrows and Coquets Monkeys and Players Courtiers and Spaniels Moles and Misers exactly resemble one another in the conformation of the  Pineal Gland  He did not doubt likewise to find the same resemblance in Highwaymen and Conquerors In order to satisfy himself in which it was that he purchased the body of one of the first Species as hath been before related at Tyburn hoping in time to have the happiness of one of the latter too under his Anatomical knife  We must not omit taking notice here that these Enquiries into the  Seat  of the  Soul  gave occasion to his first correspondence with the society of  FreeThinkers  who were then in their infancy in England and so much taken with the promising endowments of Martin that they order'd their Secretary to write him the following Letter  To the learned Inquisitor into Nature MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS The Society of  FreeThinkers  greeting  Grecian  CoffeeHouse  May  IT is with unspeakable joy we have heard of your Inquisitive Genius and we think it great pity that it should not be better employed than in looking after that Theological Nonentity commonly call'd the  Soul  Since after all your enquiries it will appear you have lost your labour in seeking the Residence of such a Chimera that never had being but in the brains of some dreaming Philosophers Is it not  Demonstration  to a person of your Sense that since  you cannot find it  there is  no such thing  In order to set so hopeful a Genius right in this matter we have sent you an answer to the illgrounded Sophisms of those crackbrain'd fellows and likewise an easy  mechanical Explanation  of  Perception  or  Thinking  One of their chief Arguments is  that  Selfconsciousness  cannot inhere in any system of Matter because all matter is made up of several distinct beings which never can make up one individual thinking being  This is easily answer'd by a familiar instance In every  Jack  there is a  meatroasting  Quality which neither resides in the Fly nor in the Weight nor in any particular wheel of the Jack but is the result of the whole composition So in an Animal the Selfconsciousness is not a real Quality inherent in one Being any more than meatroasting in a Jack but the result of several Modes or qualities in the same subject As the fly the wheels the chain the weight the cords c make one Jack so the several parts of the body make one Animal As perception or consciousness is said to be inherent in this Animal so is meatroasting said to be inherent in the Jack As sensation reasoning volition memory c are the several Modes of thinking so roasting of beef roasting of mutton roasting of pullets geese turkeys c are the  several modes of meatroasting And as the general Quality of meatroasting with its several modifications as to beef mutton pullets c does not inhere in any one part of the Jack so neither does consciousness with its several modes of sensation intellection volition c inhere in any one but is the result from the mechanical composition of the whole Animal  Just so the Quality or disposition in a Fiddle to play tunes with the several modifications of this  tuneplaying  quality in playing of Preludes Sarabands Jigs and Gavotts are as much real qualities in the Instrument as the thought or the imagination is in the mind of the Person that composes them  The Parts say they of an animal body are perpetually chang'd and the fluids which seem to be subject of consciousness are in a perpetual circulation so that the same individual particles do not remain in the Brain from whence it will follow that the idea of Individual Consciousness must be constantly translated from one particle of  matter to another whereby the particle A for example must not only be conscious but conscious that it is the same being with the particle B that went before  We answer this is only a fallacy of the imagination and is to be understood in no other sense than that maxim of the English Law that the  King never dies  This power of thinking selfmoving and governing the whole Machine is communicated from every Particle to its immediate Successor who as soon as he is gone immediately takes upon him the Government which still preserves the Unity of the whole System  They make a great noise about this Individuality how a man is conscious to himself that he is the same Individual he was twenty years ago notwithstanding the flux state of the Particles of matter that compose his body We think this is capable of a very plain answer and may be easily illustrated by a familiar example  Sir John Cutler had a pair of black  worsted stockings which his maid darn'd so often with silk that they became at last a pair of silk stockings Now supposing those stockings of Sir John's endued with some degree of Consciousness at every particular darning they would have been sensible that they were the same individual pair of stockings both before and after the darning and this sensation would have continued in them through all the succession of darnings and yet after the last of all there was not perhaps one thread left of the first pair of stockings but they were grown to be silk stockings as was said before  And whereas it is affirm'd that every animal is conscious of some individual selfmoving selfdetermining principle it is answer'd that as in a House of Commons all things are determin'd by a  Majority  so it is in every Animal system As that which determines the House is said to be the reason of the whole assembly it is no otherwise with thinking Beings who are determin'd by the greater force of several particles  which like so many unthinking Members compose one thinking System  And whereas it is likewise objected that Punishments cannot be just that are not inflicted upon the same individual which cannot subsist without the notion of a spiritual substance We reply that this is no greater difficulty to conceive than that a Corporation which is likewise a flux body may be punished for the faults and liable to the debts of their Predecessors  We proceed now to explain by the structure of the Brain the several Modes of thinking It is well known to Anatomists that the Brain is a  Congeries  of Glands that separate the finer parts of the blood call'd Animal Spirits that a Gland is nothing but a canal of a great length variously intorted and wound up together From the Arietadion and Motion of the Spirits in those Canals proceed all the different sorts of Thoughts Simple Ideas are produced by the motion of the Spirits in one simple Canal when two of these Canals disembogue themselves  into one they make what we call a Proposition and when two of these propositional Chanels empty themselves into a third they form a Syllogism or a Ratiocination Memory is perform'd in a distinct apartment of the brain made up of vessels similar and like situated to the ideal propositional and syllogistical vessels in the primary parts of the brain After the same manner it is easy to explain the other modes of thinking as also why some people think so wrong and perversely which proceeds from the bad configuration of those Glands Some for example are born without the propositional or syllogistical Canals in others that reason ill they are of unequal capacities in dull fellows of too great a length whereby the motion of the spirits is retarded in trifling genius's weak and small in the overrefining spirits too much intorted and winding and so of the rest  We are so much persuaded of the truth of this our Hypothesis that we have employ'd one of our Members a  great Virtuoso at Nuremberg to make a sort of an Hydraulick Engine in which a chimical liquor resembling Blood is driven through Elastick chanels resembling Arteries and veins by the force of an Embolus like the heart and wrought by a pneumatick Machine of the nature of the lungs with ropes and pullies like the nerves tendons and muscles And we are perswaded that this our artificial Man will not only walk and speak and perform most of the outward actions of the animal life but being wound up once a week will perhaps reason as well as most of your Country Parsons  We wait with the utmost impatience for the honour of having you a Member of our Society and beg leave to assure you that we are c  What return Martin made to this obliging Letter we must defer to another occasion let it suffice at present to tell that Crambe was in a great rage at them for stealing as he thought a hint from his  Theory of Syllogisms  without  doing him the honour so much as to mention him He advis'd his Master by no means to enter into their Society unless they would give him sufficient security to bear him harmless from any thing that might happen after this present life  CHAP XIV  The DOUBLE MISTRESS  N B  The style of this Chapter in the  Original Memoirs  is so singularly different from the rest that it is hard to conceive by whom it was penn'd But if we consider the particular Regard which our Philosopher had for it who expresly directed that  not one Word of this Chapter should be alter'd  it will be natural to suspect that it was written by himself at the Time when  Love  ever delighting in  Romances  had somewhat tinctur'd his Style and that the Remains of his first and srongest Passion gave him a Partiality to this Memorial of it Thus it begins  BUT now the successful Course of the Studies of Martin was interrupted by  Love  Love that unnerves the Vigour of the Hero and softens  the Severity of the Philosopher It chanced that as Martin was walking forth to inhale the fresh breeze of the Evening after the long and severe Studies of the day and passing through the Western Confines of the famous Metropolis of Albion not far from the proud Battlements of the Palace of Whitehall whose walls are embraced by the silver Thames his eyes were drawn upwards by a large square piece of Canvas which hung forth to the view of the passing Citizens Upon it was pourtrayed by some accurate pencil the Lybian Leopard more fierce than in his native Desart the mighty Lion who boasted thrice the bulk of the Nemaean monster before whom stood the little Jackall the faithful spy of the King of beasts Near these was placed of two Cubits high the black Prince of Monomotapa by whose side were seen the glaring Catamountain the quilldarting Porcupine and the Manmimicking Manteger Close adjoining to this hung another piece of Canvas on which was display'd the pourtrait of two Bohemian  Damsels whom Nature had as closely united as the ancient Hermaphroditus and Salmacis and whom it was as impossible to divide as the mingled waters of the gentle Thames and the amorous Isis While Martin stood in a meditating posture feasting his eyes on this Picture he heard on a sudden the sonorous notes of a Clarion which seem'd of the purest crystal In an instant the passing multitude flock'd to the sound as when a Drum summons the straggling soldiers to the approaching Battle The youthful Virtuoso who was in daily pursuit of the Curiosities of Nature was immediately surrounded by the gazing throng The doors for ever barr'd to the pennyless populace seem'd to open themselves at his producing a silver Sixpence which like Aeneas's golden bough gain'd him admission into that Scene of Wonders He no sooner enter'd the first apartment but his nostrils were struck with the scent of Carnage broken Bones and naked Carcasses bestrow'd the floor The majestick Lion rouz'd  from his bed and shook his brindled Mane the spotted Leopard gnash'd his angry teeth and walking to and fro in indignation rattled his chains Martin with infinite pleasure heard the History of the several Monsters which was courteously open'd to him by a Person of a grave and earnest mien whose frank behaviour and ready answers discover'd him to have been long conversant with different Nations and to have journey'd through distant Regions By him he was informed that the Lion was hunted on the hills of Lebanon by the Basha of Jerusalem that the Leopard was nurs'd in the uninhabited woods of Lybia the Porcupine came from the kingdom of PresterJohn and the Manteger was a true descendant of the celebrated Hanniman the Magnificent Sir said Mr Randal for that was the name of the Master of the Show the whole World cannot match these prodigies twice have I sail'd round the Globe these feet have travers'd the most remote and barbarous nations and I can with  conscience affirm that not all the Desarts of the four Quarters of the Earth furnish out a more compleat sett of Animals than what are contain'd within these walls Friend answer'd Martin bold is thy Assertion and wonderful is the knowledge of a Traveller But did'st thou ever risque thy self among the  Pliny lib cap  Scythian Canibals or those wild men of Abarimon who walk with their feet backwards hast thou ever seen the Sciopi so called because when laid supine they shelter themselves from the Sunbeams with the shadow of their feet canst thou procure me a Troglodyte footman who can catch a Roe at his full speed hast thou ever beheld those Illyrian damsels who have two sights in one eye whose looks are poisonous to males that are adult hast thou ever measur'd the gigantick Ethiopian whose stature is above eight cubits high or the sesquipedalian Pigmey hast thou ever seen any of the Cynocephali who have the  head and voice of a Dog and whose  Pilny  milk is the only true specifick for Consumptions Sir reply'd Mr Randal all these have I beheld upon my honour and many more which are set forth in my Journal As for your dogfac'd men they are no other than what stands before you that is naturally the fiercest but by art the tamest Manteger in the world That word replies Martin is a corruption of the  Aelian lib cap Pliny lib cap Pliny lib cap lib cap Aelian lib cap Aelian lib cap Aelian lib cap  Mantichora of the Ancients the most noxious Animal that ever infested the earth who had a Sting above a cubit long and would attack a rank of armed men at once flinging his poisonous darts several miles around him Canst thou inform me whether the Boars grunt in Macedonia Canst thou give me a Certificate that the Lions in Africa are afraid of the scolding of Women hast thou ever heard the sagacious Hyaena counterfeit the voice of a shepherd imitate the vomiting of a  man to draw the dogs together and ev'n call a shepherd by his proper name Your Crocodile is but a small one but you ought to have brought with him the bird Trochilos that picks his teeth after dinner at which the silly animal is so pleased that he gapes wide enough to give the Ichneumon his mortal enemy an entrance into his belly Your modern Ostriches are dwindled to meer Larks in comparison with those of the Ancients theirs were equal in stature to a man on horseback Alas we have lost the chaste bird Porphyrion the whole Race was destroy'd by Women because they discover'd the infidelity of wives to their husbands The Merops too is now no where to be found the only bird that flew backward by the tail But say canst thou inform me what Dialect of the Greek is spoken by the birds of Diomedes'island for it is from them only we can learn the true pronunciation of that ancient languageMr Randal made no satisfactory answer to these demands but harangued chiefly upon modern Monsters  and seem'd willing to confine his instances to the Animals of his own collection pointing to each of them in order with his Rod  After Martin had satisfy'd his curiosity here he was conducted into another Apartment Just at the entrance of the door appear'd a Negroe Prince His habiliments bespoke him royal his head was crown'd with the feather of an Ostrich his sable feet and legs were interlaced with Purple and Gold spangled with the Diamonds of Cornwall and the precious stones of Bristol Though his stature was of the lowest yet he behav'd himself with such an Air of Grandeur as gave evident tokens of his Regal Birth and Education He was mounted upon the lest Palfrey in the Universe a Palfrey whose natural Beauty stood not in need of those various colour'd Ribbons which braided his Mane and were interwoven with his Tail Again the chrystal Clarion founded and after several courteous speeches between the black Prince and Martin our youthful Philosopher  walk'd into the midst of the room to bless his sight with the most beautiful Curiosity of Nature On a sudden enter'd at another door the two Bohemian Sisters whose common parts of Generation had so closely ally'd them that Nature seem'd here to have conspired with Fortune that their lives should run in an eternal Parallel  The Sun had twice eight times perform'd his annual course since their Mother brought them into the world with double pangs Lindamira's eyes were of a lively blue Indamora's were black and piercing Lindamira's cheeks might rival the blush of the morning in Indamora the Lilly overcame the Rose Lindamira's tresses were of the paler Gold while the locks of Indamora were black and glossy as the Plumes of a Raven  How great is the power of Love in human breasts In vain has the Wise man recourse to his Reason when the insinuating Arrow touches his heart and the pleasing poison is diffused through his veins But then how violent  how transporting must that passion prove where not only the Fire of Youth but the unquenchable Curiosity of a Philosopher pitch'd upon the same object For how much soever our Martin was enamour'd on her as a beautiful Woman he was infinitely more ravish'd with her as a charming Monster What wonder then if his gentle Spirit already humaniz'd by a polite Education to receive all soft impressions and fired by the sight of those beauties so lavishly expos'd to his view should prove unable to resist at once so pleasing a Passion and so amiable a Phaenomenon  Martin who felt the true emotions of Love blush'd that the Object of his flame should be so openly prostituted to vulgar eyes And though he had been permitted to peruse her most secret charms yet his honourable passion was so strong that it ran into the extreme of bashfulness so that at the first interview he made no Overtures of his Love Pensive he return'd and flinging himself on his Couch pass'd  away the tedious hours of the night in the utmost Inquietude The rushy Taper afforded a glimm'ring light by which he contemplated the tender lines of Ovid but alas his Remedy of Love was no cure for our unhappy Lover's Anxiety He closed the amorous volume sigh'd and casting his eyes around on the Books that adorned his room broke forth in this pathetic Apostrophe  O ye Spirits of Antiquity who yet live in those sacred leaves why do I make you conscious of my shame Yet why should I depreciate the noble Passion of Love and call it Shame your Heroes have felt it your Poets and Orators have prais'd it Were I enamour'd on some gaudy Virgin did I doat on vulgar Perfection the Lustre of an Eye or the Rose of a Cheek with reason might I blush before you most learned Inquisitors into Nature most reverend Pliny Aelian and Aldrovandus Yet sure you cannot disapprove of this which is no wanton Passion but excited by so unparallel'd a  Production a flame that may not only justify itself to the Severity of a Philosopher but even to the Avarice of a Parent since she who causes it carries a most plentiful Fortune in the sole Exhibition of her person Heavens how I wonder at the Stupidity of mankind who can affix the opprobrious Name of Monstrosity to what is only Variety of Beauty and a Profusion of generous Nature If there are charms in one face one mouth one body if there are charms in two eyes two breasts two arms are they not all redoubled in the Object of my Passion What tho'she be the common Gaze of the multitude and is follow'd about by the stupid and ignorant does she not herein resemble the greatest Princes and the greatest Beauties only with this difference that her Admirers are more numerous and more lasting  Thus sigh'd he away the melancholy Night but no sooner had Aurora with blushes in her cheeks as conscious that she was just risen from the embraces of Tithon advanc'd through  the purple gates of the east but Martin rose He rose indeed but Melancholy the companion of his slumbers rose and wak'd with him This was the first day that he amused himself with the gaudy Ornaments of the body that with secret pleasure he contemplated his Face and the symmetry of his limbs in a lookingglass And now forsaking his solitary apartment he walked directly to the habitation that confined the Object of his desires But as it is observ'd that the Curious never wander into the City to indulge their thirst of knowledge'till about the hours of eleven or twelve the Morning has ever been the season of Repose for all those Animals who trapann'd by the frauds of Men have been oblig'd to change their Woods and Wildernesses for Lodgings in Cities at the rate of four shillings a week Therefore Martin at this early hour was neither saluted by the sound of the Trumpet nor were his eyes feasted as before with the pleasing picture of his Mistress but he walked to and fro before  the door with folded arms from the hour of five to eleven humming in a low and melancholy tune  The Trumpet no sooner sounded but his heart leapt for joy and a second sixpence gain'd him a second admittance into her apartment Yet this day also he only own'd his Passion in the language of his Eyes But alas this language is only understood by those that love and Lindamira remain'd still ignorant of his Passion  In the mean time it was no small cause of wonder to Mr Randal that this Gentleman should come every day to behold the same show He no less covetous than the Guardian of a rich Heiress entertain'd a suspicion that Martin had a design of stealing the Ladies He thereupon issued out strict Orders not to admit our Lover on any pretence whatsoever What Torments must this occasion in the raging feaver of Love Martin had now recourse to Stratagem and by a Bribe which often even the Ermine and Scarlet Robe cannot resist gain'd the Dwarf who  kept the gates of the Showroom to promote his Amour He promis'd to convey a Letter to Lindamira the same evening if he would bring it him when darkness favour'd his design at the apartment next the Monsters Martin overjoy'd hasted home and after having consulted all the Authors that treat of Love composed his Billetdoux and at the time appointed went to entrust it to the hands of his Confident Softly he stole up stairs approach'd the door and gave a gentle rap when on a sudden a small hand was thrust through a little hole at the bottom of the door whence issued an unintelligible squeaking voice Martin concluding it to be the Signal delivered his Epistle and made his retreat unobserv'd He was no sooner retir'd but Mr Randal enter'd and as it was his usual custom before he went to bed took a view if all were safe in the Showroom At his coming in he saw his Monkey exceedingly busy in picking the Sealwax by little bits from a Letter which he turn'd over and over  with infinite satisfaction Mr Randal not thinking it a breach of honour to pry into the secrets of his own family took the Letter from him and read as follows  To the most amiable LINDAMIRA  WHile others O darling of Nature look upon thee with the eyes of Curiosity I behold thee with those of Love Since I have been struck with thy most astonishing Charms how have I call'd upon Nature to make a new head new arms and a new body to sprout from this single Trunk of mine and to double every member so to render me a proper Mate for so lovely a Pair but think to how little purpose it will be for thee to stay till Nature shall form another of thy kind In such beauties she exhausts her whole art and cannot afford to be prodigal Ages must be numbred nay perhaps some Comet may vitrify this Globe on which we tread before we behold a Castor  and a Pollux resembling the beauteous Lindamira and Indamora Nature forms her wonders for the Wise and such a Masterpiece she could design for none but a Philosopher Cease then to display those beauties to the prophane Vulgar which were created to crown the desires of  Your Passionate Admirer MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS  The Dwarf enter'd as he was reading the Letter and perceiving his Master mov'd with passion immediately fell on his knees and confess'd the whole affair Mr Randal bent on revenge caused him to hasten to Martin's house with assurances that Lindamira had read his Letter with infinite satisfaction and conjured him that he would immediately favour her escape Martin overjoy'd at the news flew thither on the Wings of Love The perfidious Dwarf conducted him up stairs in the dark gently open'd the door  and bad him enter How happy was Martin in that instant who thought of nothing but leaping into the four soft arms of his Mistress when lo on a sudden he saw at the further end of the Room two glitt'ring balls of Fire which roll'd to and fro in a most terrible manner Immediately his ears were invaded with horrid hissings and spittings the balls of Fire drew nearer him and the noise redoubled as he approach'd Our Philosopher bold and resolute with love ventur'd towards it when all at once he perceiv'd something grasp him hard by the throat and fix as it were sharp lances in his cheek so that blood trickled amain down his chin Thrice Martin essay'd to free himself but vain were all his endeavours till at length to save his life he was forced to betray his Intrigue and alarm the house with reiterated cries of Murder The apartment of the Bohemian Beauties being the adjoining Room they were the first that enter'd with a light to his assistance Martin all bloody as he was a most fierce Catamountain  hanging at his chin which Mr Randal had maliciously placed there on purpose at the sight of Lindamira forgot his distress Ah my Love he cry'd how like is thy fate to that of Thisbe who staying but a moment too late found as she thought her miserable Lover torn in pieces by a Savage beast The affrighted Damsels skriek'd aloud Mr Randal with all his Retinue rush'd into the room and now every hand conspired to free his underjaw from the sharp teeth of the enragedMonster But the Lady whose heart melted at the piteous Spectacle was so zealous in this office of Humanity that the Catamountain provok'd at her goodnatur'd diligence leap'd furiously on her and wounded three of her hands and her two noses to such a barbarous degree that she was not fit to be shown publickly for the space of three weeks The generous Lover more wounded at this Spectacle than at all the scratches he had himself receiv'd charg'd the monster again with the utmost Intrepidity and rescued his mangled Mistress  Then having taken her by the hand and given it a gentle grasp he retreated with his eye fixed upon her and just as he left the room in a low and tender Accent thus breath'd forth his Soul  Behold all this have I suffered for you  Such and so modest was the first Declaration of Love made on this eminent occasion by our youthful Philosopher Nor was it ungently receiv'd by the simple and innocent Lindamira who hitherto unus'd to the soft Protestations of adoring Slaves had rather been wonder'd at than belov'd and receiv'd but imperfect notions of that tender language from the Addresses only of the black Prince or the Dwarf  Martin notwithstanding this unfortunate adventure still pursued his wishes His Letters were now no more intercepted Lindamira read them and behav'd like other courteous dames when they receive those amorous Testimonials conceal'd them from her Guardian and return'd the most engaging answers In short she  was so far captivated as to resolve no longer to be gaz'd at like a publick Beauty in her own Assembly but retire from the world and become the virtuous Mistress of a Family  But Fate had so ordain'd that Martin was not more enamoured on Lindamira than Indamora was on Martin She jealous that her Sister had the greatest share in this conquest resented that an equal application had not been made to herself She teiz'd Lindamira to such a degree on this subject as made her promise to see Martin no more But then again might Indamora be deem'd the unhappiest of Women whom her Passion and Imprudence had robb'd of the sight of her Lover Yet shame caused her to conceal those anxieties from her Sister And let the Reader judge how unhappy the Nymph must be who was even depriv'd the universal Relief of a  Soliloquy  However thus she thought without being allow'd to tell it to any Grove or purling Stream  Wretched Indamora if Lindamira must never more see Martin Martin shall never again bless the eyes of Indamora Yet why do I say wretched since my Rival can never possess my Lover without me The pangs that others feel in Absence from the thought of those Joys that bless their Rivals can never sting thy bosom nor can they mortify thee by making thee a Witness without giving thee at the same time a share of their Endearments Change then thy proceeding Indamora thy Jealousy must act a new and unheardof part and promote the interest of thy Rival as the only way to the enjoyment of thy Lover  From that moment she studied by all methods to advance her Sister's Amour and in that her own And thus there appeared in these three Lovers as extraordinary a Conjunction of Passions as of Persons Love had reconcil'd himself to his mortal foes to Philosophy in Martin and to Jealousy in Indamora  And now flourish'd the Amour of Martin Success even prevented his wishes the Marriage was agreed on and the day appointed Sunday was the time when Mr Randal's Absence favour'd their hopes who never on that day omitted taking the fresh air in the fields The key of the door he always took with him  Crambe  was ready laid at a convenient distance who accommodated them with a ladder of ropes The ladder was thrown up and the Signal given at the window Lindamira hasten'd to the Alarm of Love when behold a new Disaster As she was getting out of the window the weight of her body on one side and that of Indamora's on the other unluckily caused them to stick in the midway Lindamira hung with her coats stript up to the navel without and Indamora in no less immodest posture within The  Manteger  who for his gentleness was allowed to walk at large in the house was so heighten'd at this sight that he rush'd upon Indamora like a barborous Ravisher Indamora  cry'd aloud for help Martin flew to revenge this insolent attempt of a Rape on his weddingday The lustful Monster driv'n from our double Lucrece fled into the middle of the room pursued by the valorous and indignant Martin Three times the hot Manteger frighted at the furious menaces of his Antagonist made a circle round the chamber and three times the swiftfooted Martin pursued him He caught up the  Horn  of a  Unicorn  which lay ready for the entertainment of the curious spectator and brandishing it over his head in airy circles hurl'd it against the hairy son of Hanniman who wrinkling his brown forehead and gnashing his teeth in indignation stoop'd low The horny Lance just raz'd his left shoulder and stuck into the tapestry hangings Provok'd at this the grinning Offspring of Hanniman caught up the pointed  Horn  of an  Antelope  and aim'd a blow against his undismay'd Adversary Our heroic Lover who held his hat before him like a shield receiv'd the weapon full on  the Crown it pierc'd the beaver and gave a small rent to his breeches Then the human Champion flung with mighty violence the hinder  foot  of an  Elk  which hit the bestial Combatant full on the nether jaw He reel'd but soon recovering and his skill in war lying rather in the close fight than in projectile weapons he endeavour'd to close with him Forthwith assailing him behind unawares he clamber'd up his back and pluck'd up by the roots a mighty grasp of hairbut Martin soon dismounted him and kept him at a distance Love not only inspired his breast with Courage but gave double strength to his sinews he heav'd up the  hand  of a prodigious  SeaMonster  which when the chatt'ring Champion beheld he no less furious wielded the pond'rous  Thighbone  of a  Giant  And now they stood oppos'd to each other like the dread Captain of the sevenfold Shield and the redoubted Hector The Thighbone miss'd its aim but the hand of the SeaMonster descended directly on the head of  the Sylvian Ravisher The Monster chatter'd horribly he stretch'd his quiv'ring limbs on the floor and eternal sleep lock'd fast his eyelids  The Lady from the window like another Helen from the Trojan wall was witness of the Combat caused by her own beauty She saw with what gracefulness her Hero enter'd the Lists admir'd his activity and courage in the combat and was a joyful witness of his Triumph She gave a spring from the window and with open arms and legs embraced the neck and shoulders of her Champion Our Philosopher receiv'd her with his face turn'd modestly from her and in that manner convey'd her into the street He call'd a Chair with all haste but no chairman would take her which oblig'd him to bear his extraordinary burden till he found a Coach in which he carried her off and was happily united to her that very evening by a Reverend Clergyman in the Fleet in the holy Bands of Matrimony  CHAP XV  Of the strange and never to be parallell'd  Process  at  Law  upon the Marriage of  Scriblerus  and the Pleadings of the Advocates  BUT  Nemesis  who delights in traversing the bestlaid designs of Cupid maliciously contrived the means to make these three Lovers unhappy No sooner had the Master of the Show receiv'd notice of their flight but he seiz'd on the Bohemian Ladies by a  Warrant  and not content with having recover'd the Possession of them resolv'd to open all the Sluices of the  Law  upon Martin So he instantly went to Council to advise upon all possible methods of revenge  The first point he proceeded on was the  Property  of his Monster and the question propounded was  An Servi possint invitis Dominis Matrimonium contrahere  " Whether  Slaves could marry without the consent of their Master"  To this he was answer'd in the Affirmative but told at the same time  " That  An Servus Matrimonio eximitur a Domini obsequio  the Marriage did not exempt them from Servitude"  This put him in no small hopes of having Martin added to his  Show  and acquiring a property in his  Bodily issue  by the Ladies But his joy was soon dash'd when he was inform'd that since Martin was a Free Man  An Liberi sequuntur conditionem Patris an Matris  " The children must follow the condition of the Father or that indeed if they were to follow that of their Mother the Case would be the same there being no slavery in England"  Then his Counsel judg'd it more adviseable to plead for a  Dissolution  of the  Marriage  upon the impossibility of Conjugal dues in the Wife But then the  Canon Law  allow'd a  Triennal Cohabitation  which entirely ruin'd this  Project also Besides it was evident by the same Law that  " Monstrosity could not incapacitate from Marriage"  witness the Case of Hermaphrodites who are allow'd  "  Facultatem Conjugii  provided they  make Election  before the  Parish Priest  in  what sex  they will act and take an Oath never to perform in the other capacity"  Sanchez Hostiens Sylvest  It was next consulted whether Martin should not be permitted to  take away  his Wife since upon his so doing  " he might be sued for a  Rape  upon the body of her  Sister  there being plainly the  four conditions  of a  Violentia Causa Libidinis Traductio ad Locum Mulier honesta  Rape"  But then again they consider'd that Martin might answer he claim'd nothing but his own and if another person had fix'd herself to his Wife he must not for that cause be debarr'd the use of his Property  Yet still upon the same head of Martin's possessing his spouse a Suit might be devis'd in the name of Lindamira  on this account  Uxor non tenetur vivere cum viro Concubinam tenente  That a  "  Wife  was not oblig'd to live with a  Concubine  and such her Sister Indamora must be accounted to Martin from the common  Tactus amplexus cohabitatio  Proofs"  To this too it was reply'd that the Law order'd the Wife to  reside  with the  Husband  if there were sufficient security given to expel the Concubine So Martin might say he was ready to accomplish his part of the Covenant if his wife would perform hers and consent to the  An Uxor tenetur Incisionem pati  Sanchez  de  Matrimonio  Incision But this being an impossibility on the side of the Wife it could no way be exacted of the Husband  At length Mr Randal being vext at the heart to have been so long and so quaintly disappointed determin'd to commence a Suit against Martin for  Bigamy  and  Incest  Mean while he left no Artifice or Address untry'd to  perplex the unhappy Philosopher He even contriv'd with infinite cunning to alienate Indamora's affections from him and debauch'd her into an Intrigue with a Creature of his own the black Prince whom he secretly caus'd to marry her while her Sister was  asleep  Hereupon Martin was reduc'd to turn  Plaintiff  and commenc'd a Suit in the  Spiritual Court  against the black Prince for Cohabitation with his said wife He was advis'd to insist upon a new Point viz  " That Lindamira and Indamora  together  made up but  one  lawful wife"  The Monstermaster further to distress Martin forc'd Lindamira to petition for Aliment  lite pendente  which was no sooner allow'd her by the Court but he oblig'd her to alledge that  " it was not sufficient to maintain both herself and her Sister and if her Sister perish'd she could not live with the dead body about her"  Martin now began to repent that he had not executed a resolution he formerly conceiv'd of marrying  Crambe  to Indamora as an Expedient to have made all secure Moreover it was insisted on that the other also had a right to  Aliment    " because if Martin's Wife should prove with child the said Sister must necessarily perform the  Offices  of a  wife  in contributing to the  Nutrition  and  Gestation  of the said child"  A Jury of Physicians being impannel'd declar'd that as to Nutrition they were doubtful whether any blood of Lindamira circulated through Indamora But as to Gestation it was evidently true And upon this Martin was order'd to allow Aliment to both the Black Prince appearing  insolvent  Then the Court proceeded to the Trial And as both the Cause and the Pleadings are of an extraordinary Nature we think sit here to insert them at length  Dr Pennyfeather thus pleaded for Martinus Scriblerus the Plaintiff  Dr PENNYFEATHER  " I appear before your Honour in behalf of Martinus Scriblerus Batchelor of Physick in a Complaint against EbnHaiPawWaw commonly called the black Prince of Monopotapa Inasmuch as the said EbnHaiPawWaw hath maliciously forcibly and unlawfully seiz'd ravish'd and detain'd LindamiraIndamora the wife of the said Martin and the body of the said LindamiraIndamora from time to time ever since hath wickedly leudly and indecently us'd handled and evil entreated And in order to make this his Villainy more lasting hath presum'd to marry this our Wife pretending to give his wickedness the Sanction of a Law And forasmuch as the Adulterer doth not deny the fact but insists upon his said Marriage as lawful we cannot open the Case more plainly to your Honour than by answering his Reasons which indeed to mention is to confute  " He maintains no less an absurdity than this that  One  is  Two  and that LindamiraIndamora the individual wife of the Plaintiff is not one but two Persons And that the said EbnHaiPawWaw is not marry'd to Lindamira the wife of the said Martin but to his own lawful wife Indamora another individual Person distinct from the said Lindamira tho' join'd to her by a strong Ligament of Nature"  In answer whereunto we shall prove three things "  First  that the said LindamiraIndamora now our lawful wife makes but one individual person"  " Secondly that if they made two individual persons yet they constitute but one wife"  "  Thirdly  that supposing they made two individual persons and two wives each lawfully marry'd to her own husband yet Prince EbnHaiPawWaw hath no right to detain Lindamira our lawfully wedded wife  on pretence of being marry'd to Indamora"  As to the first point " It will be necessary to determine the  constituent Principle  and  Essence  of  Individuality  which in respect of mankind we take to be one simple identical soul in one simple identical body The individuality sameness or identity of the body is not determin'd as some vainly imagine by one head and a certain number of arms legs and other members but in one simple single  or member of Generation"  " Let us search Profane History and we shall find Geryon with three heads and Briareus with an hundred hands Let us search Sacred History and we meet with one of the sons of the Giants with six Fingers to each Hand and six Toes to each Foot yet none never accounted Geryon or Briareus more than one Person and give us leave to say the wife of the said Geryon would have had a good action against any women  who should have espous'd themselves to the two other heads of that Monarch The Reason is plain because each of these having but one simple  or one member of Generation could be look'd upon but as one single person"  " In conformity to this when we behold this one member we distinguish the Sex and pronounce it a  Man  or a  Woman  or as the Latins express it  unus Vir una Mulier une Homme une Femme One Man One Woman  For the same Reason Man and Wife are said to be one Flesh because united in that part which constitutes the Sameness and Individuality of each sex"  " And as where there is but one Member of Generation there is but one Body so there can be but one Soul because the said Organ of Generation is the Seat of the Soul and consequently where there is but one such Organ there can be but one Soul Let me here say without injury to truth that no Philosopher  either of the past or present age hath taken more pains to discover where the Soul keeps her residence than the Plaintiff the learned Martinus Scriblerus And after his most diligent enquiries and experiments he hath been verily persuaded that the Organ of Generation is the true and only  Seat of the Soul  That this part is seated in the middle and near the Center of the whole Body is obvious to your Honour's view From thence like the Sun in the Center of the world the Soul dispenses her warmth and vital influence Let the Brain glory in the Wisdom of the aged the Science of the learned the Policy of the statesman and the Invention of the witty the accidental Amusements and Emanations of the Soul and mortal as the Possessors of them It is to the Organs of Generation that we owe Man himself there the Soul is employ'd in works suitable to the Dignity of her Nature and as we  may say sits brooding over ages ye unborn"  " We need not tell your Honour that it has been the opinion of many most learned Divines and Philosophers that the Soul as well as Body is produc'd  Ex Traduce  This doctrine has been defended by arguments irrefragable and accounts for difficulties without it inexplicable All which arguments conclude with equal strength for the Soul's being seated in the Organs of Generation For since the whole man both Soul and Body is  there  form'd and since nothing can operate but where it  is  it follows that the Soul must reside in that individual place where she exerts her generative and plastick Powers"  " This our Doctrine is confirm'd by all those Experiments which conspire to prove the absolute Dominion which that part hath over the whole Body We see how many Women who are deaf to the perswasions of the Eloquent the insinuations of the  Crafty and the threats of the Imperious are easily govern'd by some poor Loggerhead unfurnish'd with the least art but that of making immediate application to this  Seat of the Soul  The impressions made by the Ear are so distant and transmitted thro' so many windings that they lose their Energy But your Honour by immediately applying to the Organ of Generation acts like a bold and wife Petitioner who goes strait to the  very Throne  and  JudgmentSeat  of the Monarch"  " And whereas it is objected that here are  two Wills  and therefore  two  different  Persons  we answer if Multiplicity of Wills imply'd multiplicity of Persons there are few Husbands but what are guilty of  Poligamy  there being in the same Woman great and notorious diversity of Wills A Point which we shall not need to insist upon before any marry'd person much less of your Honour's Experience"  " Thus have we made good our first and principal Point That if the wife of the Plaintiff LindamiraIndamora hath but  one  Organ of Generation she is but  one individual Person  in the truest and most proper sense of Individuality And that the matter of Fact is so we are willing to put upon a fair Trial by a Jury of Matrons whom your Honour shall think fit to nominate and appoint to inspect the body of the said LindamiraIndamora"  "  Secondly  we are to prove that though LindamiraIndamora were  two  individual Persons consisting each of a Soul and Body yet if they have but one Organ of Generation they can constitute but one Wife For from whence can the  Unity  of any thing be denominated but from that which  constitutes  the  Essence  or principal  Use  of it Thus if a Knife or Hatchet have but one blade though two handles it will properly be denominated but one Knife or one Hatchet inasmuch as it hath  but one of that which constitutes the Essence or principal Use of a Knife or Hatchet So if there were not only one but twenty  Supposita Rationalia  with one common Organ of Generation that one System would only make one Wife Upon the whole let not a few Heads Legs or Arms extraordinary biass your Honour's Judgment and deprive the Plaintiff of his legal Property In which right our Client is so strongly fortify'd that allowing both the former Propositions to be false and that there were two Persons two Bodies two Rational Souls yea and two Organs of Generation yet would it still be plain in the third place"  " That the Defendant Prince EbnHaiPawWaw can have no Right to detain from the Plaintiff his lawfully wedded  Wife  Lindamira For abstracting from the  Priority  of the marriage of our Client by which it would seem he acquir'd a property in his Wife and  all other  Matter inseparably annex'd unto her  it is evident Prince EbnHaiPawWaw by his marriage to Indamora could never acquire any property in Lindamira nor can produce any Cause why both of them should live with himself rather than with the other Therefore we humbly hope your Honour will order the body of Our said Wife to be restor'd to us and due Censure past on the said EbnHaiPawWaw"  Dr Pennyfeather having thus ended his Pleading was thus answer'd by  Dr LEATHERHEAD  " I will not trouble your Honour with any unnecessary Preamble or false Colours of Eloquence which Truth hath no need of and which would prove too thin a Veil for Falsehood before the penetrating eyes of your Honour In answer therefore to what our learned brother Dr Pennyfeather hath asserted we shall labour to demonstrate"  "  First  That though there were but one Organ of Generation yet are there two distinct persons"  "  Secondly  That although there were but one Organ of Generation so far would it be from giving the Plaintiff any right to the body of Indamora the wife of EbnHaiPawWaw that it will subject the Plaintiff to the penalty of Incest or of Bigamy"  "  Thirdly  We doubt not to prove that the said LindamiraIndamora hath two distinct parts of Generation"  " And  First  we will show that neither the individual Essence of mankind nor the Seat of the Soul doth reside in the Organ of Generation and this first from Reason For unreasonable indeed must it be to make that the Seat of the Rational Soul which alone sets us on a level with beasts or to conceive that the Essence of Unity and Individuality should consist in that which is the Source of Discord and Division In a word what can be a greater absurdity than to affirm Bestiality to  be the Essence of Humanity Darkness the Center of Light and Filthiness the Seat of Purity"  " We could from the authority of the mos eminent Philosophers of all ages confirm this our Assertion few of whom ever had the impudence to degrade this Queen the Rational Soul to the very lowest and vilest Apartment or rather Sink of her whole Palace But we shall produce fill a greater Authority than these to manifest that personal Individuality did subsist when there was no such generative Carnality"  " It hath been strenuously maintain'd by many holy Divines and particularly by Thomas Aquinas that our first Parents in the state of Innocence did in no wife propagate their species after the present common manner of men and beasts but that the propagation at that time must have been by Intuition Coalition of Ideas or some pure and spiritual manner suitable to the dignity of their station And though the Sexes  were distinguish'd in that State yet it is plain it was not by parts such as we have at present since if our First Parents had any such they must have known it And it is written that they discover'd them not till after the Fall when it is probable those parts were the immediate Excrescence of Sin and only grew forth to render them fitter companions for those a Beasts among which they were driven"  " It is a Maxim in Philosophy that  Generatio unius est Corruptio alterius  whence it is apparent that the Paradisaical Generation was of a different nature from ours free from all Corruption and Imbecility This is further corroborated by the Authority of those Doctors of the Church who have asserted that before the Fall Adam was endow'd with a continual uninterrupted Faculty of Generation which can be explain'd of no other than of that  Intuitive Generation  above said Since it is well known to all the least  skill'd in Anatomy that the present male part of Generation is utterly incapable of this continual Faculty"  " We come now to our  second  point wherein the Advocate for the Plaintiff asserteth that if there were two persons and one Organ of Generation this System would constitute but one Wife This will put the Plaintiff still in a worse condition and render him plainly guilty of Bigamy Rape or Incest For if there be but one such Organ of Generation then both the persons of Lindamira and Indamora have an equal property in it and what is Indamora's property cannot be dispos'd of without her consent We therefore bring the whole to this short issue whether the Plaintiff  Martinus Scriblerus  had the  Consent  of Indamora or  not  If he hath  had  her consent he is guilty of  Bigamy  if  not  he is guilty of a  Rape  or  Incest  or  both  "  " The Defendant Prince EbnHaiPawWaw having been lately  baptiz'd hath with singular modesty abstain'd from Consummation with his said Wife until he shall be satisfy'd from the opinion of your Honour his learned Judge how far in Law and Conscience he may proceed And therefore he cannot affirm much nor positively as to the structure of the Organ of Generation of this his wife Indamora Yet make we no doubt that it will upon inspection appear that the said Organ is distinct from that of Lindamira Whereupon we crave to hear the Report of the Jury of Matrons appointed to inspect the body of the said gentlewoman"  " And if the Matter of Fact be thus give me your Honour's permission to repeat what hath been said by the Advocate for the Plaintiff to wit that  Martinus Scriblerus  Batchelor in Physick by this his Marriage with  Lindamira  could in no wise acquire any property in the body of Indamora not shew any Cause why this duplicated Wife  LindamiraIndamora should abide with him rather than with the Defendant Prince EbnHaiPawWaw of Monomotapa"  The Jury of Matrons having made their Report and it appearing from thence that the Parts of Generation in Lindamira and Indamora were distinct the Judge took time to deliberate and the next CourtDay he spoke to this effect  GENTLEMEN  " I am of opinion that Lindamira and Indamora are distinct persons and that both the Marriages are good and valid Therefore I order you Martinus Scriblerus Batchelor in Physick and you EbnHaiPawWaw Prince of Monomotapa to cohabit with your wives and to lie in bed each on the side of his own wife I hope Gentlemen you will seriously consider that you are under a stricter Tye than common Brothersinlaw that being as it were Joint Proprietors of one common  Tenement you will so behave as good fellowlodgers ought to do and with great modesty each to his respective sisterinlaw abstaining from all further Familiarities than what Conjugal Duties do naturally oblige you to Consider also by how small limits the Duty and the Trespass is divided lest while ye discharge the duty of Matrimony  ye  heedlessly slide into the sin of Adultery"  This Sentence pleas'd neither Party and Martin appeal'd from the Consistory to the  Court  of  Arches  but they confirm'd the Sentence of the Consistory  It was at last brought before a  Commission  of  Delegates  who having weigh'd the Case revers'd the Sentence of the inferior Courts and disannull'd the marriage upon the following Reasons  " That allowing the manner of Cohabitation enjoin'd to be practicable though highly inconvenient yet the  Jus petendi reddendi Debitum conjugale  being at all times equal  in both husbands and both wives and at the same time impossible in more than one Two persons could not have a Right to the entire possession of the same thing at the same time nor could one so enjoy his property as to debar another from the use of his who has an equal right So much as to the  Debitum petendi  and as to the  Debitum reddendi    nemo tenetur ad impossibile  "  Therefore the Lords with great Wisdom dissolv'd both Marriages as proceeding upon a natural as well as legal Absurdity  CHAP XVI  Of the Secession of  Martinus  and some Hints of his  Travels  THIS affair being thus unhappily terminated and become the whole Talk of the Town Martinus unable to support the Affliction as well as to avoid the many disagreeable Consequences  resolv'd to quit the Kingdom  But we must not here neglect to mention that during the whole Course of this Process his continual Attendance on the Courts in his own Cause and his invincible Curiosity for all that past in the Causes of others gave him a wonderful insight into this Branch of Learning which must be confest to have been so improved by the Moderns as beyond all comparison to exceed the Ancients From the day his first Bill was filed he began to collect  Reports  and before his Suit was ended he had time abundantly sufficient to compile a very considerable Volume His Anger at his ill success caus'd him to destroy the greatest part of these  Reports  and only to preserve such as discover'd most of the Chicanery and Futility of the practice These we have some hopes to recover if they were only mislaid at his Removal if not the world will be enough instructed to lament the loss by the only one now publick viz The  Case of  Stradling  and  Stiles  in an  Action concerning certain  black  and  white Horses  We cannot wonder that he contracted a violent Aversion to the  Law  as is evident from a whole Chapter of his Travels And perhaps his Disappointment gave him also a Disinclination to the  Fair Sex  for whom on some occasions he does not express all the Respect and Admiration possible This doubtless must be the Reason that in no part of his  Travels  we find him belov'd by any  strange Princess  nor have we the least account that he ever relaps'd into this Passion except what is mention'd in the Introduction of the  Spanish Lady's Phenomenon  It was in the year that Martin set out on his  Travels  Thou wilt certainly be very curious to know what they were It is not yet time to inform thee But what hints I am at liberty to give I will  Thou shalt know then that in his first Voyage he was carry'd by a prosperous Storm to a Discovery of the  Remains of the ancient  Pygmaean  Empire  That in his second he was as happily shipwreck'd on the Land of the  Giants  now the most humane people in the world  That in his third Voyage he discover'd a whole Kingdom of  Philosophers  who govern by the  Mathematicks  with whose admirable Schemes and Projects he return'd to benefit his own dear Country but had the misfortune to find them rejected by the envious Ministers of  Queen Anne  and himself sent treacherously away  And hence it is that in his fourth Voyage he discovers a Vein of Melancholy proceeding almost to a Disgust of his Species but above all a mortal Detestation to the whole flagitious Race of  Ministers  and a final Resolution not to give in any  Memorial  to the  Secretary of State  in order to subject the Lands he discover'd to the  Crown  of  Great Britain  Now if by these hints the Reader can help himself to a further discovery  of the Nature and Contents of these Travels he is welcome to as much light as they afford him I am oblig'd by all the tyes of honour not to speak more openly  But if any man shall ever see such very extraordinary Voyages into such very extraordinary Nations which manifest the most distinguishing marks of a Philosopher a Politician and a Legislator and can imagine them to belong to a  Surgeon of a Ship  or a  Captain  of a  Merchantman  let him remain in his Ignorance  And whoever he be that shall further observe in every page of such a book that cordial  Love  of  Mankind  that inviolable  Regard  to  Truth  that  Passion  for his  dear Country  and that particular attachment to the excellent Princess Queen  Anne  surely that man deserves to be pity'd if by all those visible Signs and Characters he cannot distinguish and acknowledge the Great  Scriblerus  CHAP XVII  Of the Discoveries and Works of the Great  Scriblerus  made and to be made written and to be written known and unknown  AND here it seems but natural to lament the unfortunate End of the Amour of our Philosopher But the Historian of these Memoirs on the contrary cries out  " Happy thrice happy day which dissolved the Marriage of the great Scriblerus let it be celebrated in every language learned and unlearned let the Latin the Greek the Arabian the Coptic let all the Tongues of manylanguag'd men nay of Animals be employ'd to resound it since to this we owe such immense discoveries not only of Oceans Continents Islands with all their Inhabitants minute gigantick mortal and immortal but those yet more enlarged  and astonishing Views of worlds philosophical physical moral intelligible and unintelligible"  Here therefore at this great Period we end our first Book And here O Reader we entreat thee utterly to forget all thou hast hitherto read and to cast thy eyes only forward to that boundless Field the next shall open unto thee the fruits of which if thine or our sins do not prevent are to spread and multiply over this our work and over all the face of the Earth  In the mean time know what thou owest and what thou yet may'st owe to this excellent Person this Prodigy of our Age who may well be called  The Philosopher of Ultimate Causes  since by a Sagacity peculiar to himself he hath discover'd Effects in their very Cause and without the trivial helps of Experiments or Observations hath been the Inventor of most of the modern Systems and Hypotheses  He hath enrich'd Mathematicks with many precise and Geometrical  Quadratures  of the  Circle  He first  discover'd the  Cause  of  Gravity  and the intestine  Motion  of  Fluids  To him we owe all the observations on the  Parallax  of the  PoleStar  and all the new  Theories  of the  Deluge  He it was that first taught the right use sometimes of the  Fuga Vacui  and sometimes of the  Materia Subtilis  in resolving the grand Phaenomena of Nature  He it was that first found out the  Palpability  of  Colours  and by the delicacy of his Touch could distinguish the different Vibrations of the heterogeneous Rays of Light  His were the Projects of  Perpetuum Mobiles    Flying Engines  and  Pacing Saddles  the Method of discovering the  Longitude  by  BombVessels  and of increasing the  TradeWind  by vast plantations of  Reeds  and  Sedges  I shall mention only a few of his Philosophical and Mathematical Works  A compleat Digest of the Laws of Nature with a Review of those that are obsolete or repealed and of those  that are ready to be renew'd and put in force  A Mechanical Explication of the Formation of the Universe according to the Epicurean Hypothesis  An Investigation of the Quantity of real Matter in the Universe with the proportion of the specifick Gravity of solid Matter to that of fluid  Microscopical Observations of the Figure and Bulk of the constituent Parts of all fluids A Calculation of the proportion in which the Fluids of the earth decrease and of the period in which they will be totally exhausted  A Computation of the Duration of the Sun and how long it will last before it be burn'd out  A Method to apply the Force arising from the immense Velocity of  Light  to mechanical purposes  An answer to the question of a curious Gentleman How long a  New Star  was lighted up before its appearance to the Inhabitants of our earth To which is subjoin'd a Calculation how much the Inhabitants of the  Moon  eat for Supper considering that they pass a Night equal to fifteen of our natural days  A Demonstration of the natural Dominion of the Inhabitants of the Earth over those of the Moon if ever an intercourse should be open'd between them With a Proposal of a  PartitionTreaty  among the earthly Potentates in case of such discovery  TideTables for a Comet that is to approximate towards the Earth  The Number of the Inhabitants of London determin'd by the Reports of the Goldfinders and the Tonnage of their Carriages with allowance for the extraordinary quantity of the  Ingesta  and  Egesta  of the people of England and a deduction of what is left under dead walls and dry ditches  It will from hence be evident how much all his Studies were directed to the universal Benefit of Mankind Numerous have been his Projects to this end of which  Two  alone will be sufficient to show the amazing Grandeur  of his Genius The first was a Proposal by a general contribution of all Princes to pierce the first crust or  Nucleus  of this our  Earth  quite through to the next concentrical Sphere The advantage he propos'd from it was to find the  Parallax  of the  Fixt Stars  but chiefly to refute Sir Isaac Newton's Theory of  Gravity  and Mr Halley's of the  Variations  The second was to build  Two Poles  to the  Meridian  with immense Lighthouses on the top of them to supply the defect of Nature and to make the Longitude as easy to be calculated as the Latitude Both these he could not but think very practicable by the Power of all the Potentates of the World  May we presume after these to mention how he descended from the sublime to the beneficial parts of Knowledge and particularly his extraordinary practice of  Physick  From the Age Complexion or Weight of the person given he contrived to prescribe at a dis  ance as well as at a Patient's bedside He taught the way to many modern  Physicians to cure their Patients by  Intuition  and to others to cure  without looking on them at all  He projected a Menstruum to dissolve the Stone made of Dr Woodward's  Universal Delugewater  His also was the device to relieve Consumptive or Asthmatick persons by bringing fresh Air out of the Country to Town by pipes of the nature of the Recipients of Airpumps And to introduce the Native air of a man's country into any other in which he should travel with a seasonable Intromission of such Steams as were most familiar to him to the inexpressible comfort of many Scotsmen Laplanders and white Bears  In  Physiognomy  his penetration is such that from the  Picture  only of any person he can write his  Life  and from the features of the Parents draw the Portrait of any Child that is to be born  Nor hath he been so enrapt in these Studies as to neglect the Polite Arts of Painting Architecture Musick Poetry c It was he that gave the  first hint to our modern  Painters  to improve the  Likeness  of their Portraits by the use of such  Colours  as would faithfully and constantly accompany the  Life  not only in its present state but in all its alterations decays age and death itself  In  Architecture  he builds not with so much regard to present symmetry or conveniency as with a Thought well worthy a true lover of Antiquity to wit the noble effect the Building will have to posterity when it shall fall and become a Ruin  As to  Musick  I think Heidegger has not the face to deny that he has been much beholden to his Scores  In  Poetry  he hath appear'd under a hundred different names of which we may one day give a Catalogue  In  Politicks  his Writings are of a peculiar Cast for the most part Ironical and the Drift of them often so delicate and refin'd as to be mistaken by the vulgar He once went so far as to write a Persuasive to people to eat their own Children which was so  little understood as to be taken in ill part He has often written against  Liberty  in the name of  Freemen  and  Algernoon Sydney  in vindication of the Measures of  Spain  under that of  Raleigh  and in praise of  Corruption  under those of  Cato  and  Publicola  It is true that at his last departure from England in the Reign of Queen  Anne  apprehending lest any of these might be perverted to the Scandal of the weak or Encouragement of the flagitious he cast them all without mercy into a Boghouse near  St James  's Some however have been with great diligence recover'd and fish'd up with a hook and line by the Ministerial Writers which make at present the great Ornaments of their works  Whatever he judg'd beneficial to Mankind he constantly communicated not only during his stay among us but ever since his absence by some method or other in which Ostentation had no part With what incredible Modesty he conceal'd himself is known  to numbers of those to whom he address'd sometimes Epistles sometimes Hints sometimes whole Treatises Advices to Friends Projects to First Ministers Letters to Members of Parliament Accounts to the Royal Society and innumerable others  All these will be vindicated to the true Author in the Course of these Memoirs I may venture to say they cannot be unacceptable to any but to those who will appear too much concern'd as  Plagiaries  to be admitted as  Judges  Wherefore we warn the publick to take particular notice of all such as manifest any indecent Passion at the appearance of this Work as Persons most certainly involved in the Guilt  The END of the First BOOK  THE CONTENTS OF THE MEMOIRS of  SCRIBLERUS
