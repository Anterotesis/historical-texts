in the Representation and the Air Page    beginning  "Submission's the Lover's best Grace"  is substituted for it  LOVE finds the WAY  ACT I  AIR  BRUMPTON  I  MY Heart I presume is my own Sir  And will not to Bondage submit  'Tis Passion for Passion alone Sir  My Wish and my Humour can hit  II  If I smack of an obstinate Temper  The Failing from you I derive  While you try my Affections to hamper  'Gainst Weather and Current you strive  III  I know 'tis a Maxim with you Sir  That Money all Faults will remove  But each Guinea with me is as two Sir  When Wealth is ennobled by Love  AIR  OLDCASTLE  I  'Tis the commonest Instance in Nature  The pleasantest Subject of Satire  No Object of Ridicule greater  In the Records of Whim can be shewn  To find others Faults how we labour  And our Tongue like a twoedged Sabre  Hacks and hews the Defects of a Neighbour  But never adverts to our own  II  Lord help us what's come to your Reason  That thus out of Measure and Season  Your Betters you issue Decrees on  Setting up Judge and Jury in one  Brother  Lovibond  lay by your Jeering  Your Carping your Mocking and Sneering  At the Hump of another leave peering  And pr'ythee look back at your own  AIR  BRUMPTON  I  Though his Modes and Forms are slighted  Venus' Son beholds delighted  Ardent Hearts at View united  And adopts the Pair his own  II  Not by dint of tedious Sighing  Pining Whining Crying Dying  Daily Oaths and daily Lying  Did I make my Passion known  III  But by Love's more artless Fancies  Silent soothing▪ soft Advances  Ogling Looks alluring Glances  I was caught and she was won  Though his Modes c  AIR  HARRIET  As mourns the soft Songster confin'd from the Spray  And changes to Notes of Lamenting his Lay  So I with my Freedom my Spirits forego  And my Ditties alas all are Ditties of Woe  Oh come then my  Belford  my wellbelov'd Swain  Restore me to Mirth and to Freedom again  Or still if a Captive I'm fated to be  Alone make me Captive to Love and to thee  AIR  OLDCASTLE  Zooks that an old Man can't keep a Chicken  A snug Titbit for his own private picking  And Means of Redress no Statute allows  But a Rake like a sly Beast of Prey will be watching  New Mischiefs inventing new Artifice hatching  O  his Whitelegged Dainty the Owner to chouse  Are there no Means in his Art to outtrick him  Traps and Guns shall be planted to nick him  On every Floor and each Stair of my House  AIR  LOVIBOND  I  My Joy my Pride  While thee beside  My Heart is light and gay  Those Charms so rare  Old Age r  air  And Winter turns to May Toll loll c  Those Charms c  II  No Time destroys  Our Hopes and Joys  While Health and Mirth remain  The honest Mind  From Spleen confin'd  Defies Old Age and Pain Toll loll c  Those Charms c  III  In Hymen's Bands  Adieu Commands  My Harriet then shall sway  In his bless'd Reign  Let her ordain  While I with Pride obey Toll loll c  Those Charms c  AIR  HARRIET  I  Fancy my Thought inspiring  Courage my Bosom firing  To Pleasure's Realms aspiring  On Love's gay Wings I rise  II  D ubt and Despair defying  O  Belford  's Truth relying  Fond Hope her Aid supplying  Shall waft me to my Joys  AIR  MARY ANN  I  At ruddy Eve and rosy Dawn  I rov'd the Fields at Leisure  I danc'd at Freedom on the Lawn  And took my Fill of Pleasure  I rambled through the bushy Wood  Where Rills were gently flowing  Admir'd the Rose within the Bud  And Violets sweetly blowing  II  How sweet to see along the Meads  The Lads and Lasses playing  When Spring entic'd them from their Beds  And call'd them forth aMaying  Some new Vagary and Delight  With ev'ry Day returning  And Mirth and Pastime clos'd the Night  And welcom'd in the Morning  DUET  OLDCASTLE and MARY ANNE  Old  His Words his Looks his wanton Smiles  Were only sly alluring Wiles  Your Pride should take Alarm  Mar  So soft so soothing was his Look  So gentle ev'ry Word he spoke  He could not mean to harm  Oldc  Vows like his are ever harming  Mar  Vows like his are ever charming  Oldc  Then away to your Chamber and mind what I say  What your Guardian advises be sure to obey  His Presents and Words you must learn to disdain  And do all you can to forget him again  Mar  I'll away to my Chamber nor mind what you say  What my Guardian advises I cannot obey  His Presents and Words I can never disdain  And I'll do all I can to behold him again  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  AIR  HARRIET  WHEN a Point's in Agitation  Whereon some future Bliss depends  What alarming Palpitation  The anxious Bosom rends  Now glowing Hope now chilling Fear  Now sullen Doubt now dark Despair  Then again comes Hope with ardent Fires  Gives new Ambition new Desires  And sure Success inspires  DUET  LOVIBOND and HARRIET  Beauty is the Prize of Merit  Boys and Fools appeal in vain  Manly Sense and manly Spirit  They alone the Fair obtain  AIR  BELFORD  I  Sweet Peace restore my wonted Rest  No longer let me prove  The Pangs that rend the hapless Breast  Of unrequited Love  By thee protected let me lie  And shun the Scorn of Beauty's Eye  II  But should ye Powers the sweet sweet Maid  My Pains with Pity view  And though my Sighs too weakly plead  Lament a Swain so true  Far greater Torments bid me prove  I'll die adoring die for Love  AIR  BELFORD  Oh Love thou Delight and Tormentor of Hearts  How balmy thy Comforts how piercing thy Smarts  When distress'd by the Frowns of the Nymph we adore  The Pinions of Time move with Rapture no more  But when Beauty relents and no longer we mourn  When Sighs of fond Passion are paid with Return  Our Years and our Days Oh how sweetly they fly  Each Moment of Life is a Moment of Joy  AIR  BELFORD  I  How sweetly fits the simplest Phrase  Unfeigned Passion to discover  Too weak alas my fondest Lays  To shew how well how true I love her  As soon could I the glittering Stars  That Midnight's sable Bosom cover  In order number as declare  How well how true how dear I love her  II  Professions trick'd in Language high  The Force of Eloquence discover  But Nature's Accents best imply  The Meaning of a faithful Lover  As soon could I c  III  Fierce Vows too often sprung from Art  Unfair Designs may serve to cover  But Deeds of Kindness speak the Heart  And they shall shew how well I love her  As soon could I c  AIR  MARY ANN  I  Come Oh come my own dear Swain  Be but true to Love and me  Come Oh come thy Faith maintain  And my Guardian ever be  II  Chase away these rude Alarms  And beneath thy tender Care  Take a Lass that from thy Arms  No Wealth nor Power shall tear  TRIO  OLDCASTLE PETER BRIDGET  Oldc  Villain thus your Faith d'ye hold  'Twas but by Way of Trial  Peter  If you had not shewn the Gold  I still had made Denial  Oldc  All my good Advice to fail  The Devil sure is in ye  Brid  What will good Advice avail  When balanc'd with a Guinea  Oldc  From your Duty and Virtue so quickly to fall  Peter  'Tis the Sight of this Gold that bewitches us all  If our Betters resist not the Force of a Fee  Say how should such poor silly Creatures as we  Brid  Oldc  From your Duty and Virtue so quickly to fall  Pet  From our Duty and Virtue how could we but fall  Brid  'Tis the Sight of this Gold that bewitches us all  Oldc  'Tis the Sight of that Gold that bedevil's you all  END OF THE SECOND ACT  ACT III  AIR  LOVIBOND  I  I often have thought and I often have said  'Tis Matter of greatest Surprise  Such old ones as he still pursue their own Head  And will not with wiser advise  II  An obstinate Greybeard by Dotage misled  Returns to his Childhood again  Good Counsel's the Gocart wherein he should tread  Or Woe to his poor shatter'd Brain  III  If these he provide not all Mischief and Moan  Deservedly fall on the Elf  For none should presume to proceed all alone  Unless they're as wise as myself  AIR  BRUMPTON  I  Lovers when they meet Return  Soft Return to am'rous Wishes  Feel no more their Bosoms burn  But dissolve in melting Blisses▪  But debarr'd the fairone's Sight  All is Torment all is Anguish  Far they stray from cheering Light  Doom'd alone to pine and languish  II  Yet before I bid adieu▪  Oh forgive each rude Vexation  Which from fond Endeavours grew  To reveal a faithful Passion  Thus debarr'd my Fairone's Sight  Left alone to pine and languish  Robb'd of thee my Star of Light  All is Darkness all is Anguish  AIR  MARYANN  I  Two before me that adore me  How how shall I speak my mind  One is pleasing t'other teazing  Where I ought to be I'll be kind  Then▪ Ahwelladay what I covet Oh  Guess and my Meaning find  II  One to cheer me ever near me  Sweet smiling I wish to obtain  T'other Creature sour in Feature  Never may I behold again  Then Ahwelladay what I covet Oh  Guess and my Meaning find  III  One to wed me if decreed me  Bless'd bless'd wou'd be all my Hours  But with t'other horrid Lover  Marriage Mis'ry at once insures  Then Ahwelladay what I covet Oh  Guess and my Heart is yours  TRIO  BRUMPTON MARYANN OLDCASTLE  Brump  At length the false Dream of Delusion is o'er  I wander in Doubt and in Darkness no more  Mar  At length the false Dream of Delusion is o'er  I wander in Doubt and in Darkness no more  Oldc  At length the sad Hours of Suspicion are o'er  I wander in Doubt and Vexation no more  Mar  To your Honour be just to your Promise be true  Thus firmly relying I bid you adieu  Brum Mar  Endless Blessings Fortune send you  Oldc  With your Leave Sir I'll attend you  Brum Mar  All your fairest Wishes crown  Oldc  With your Leave I'll see you down  To Honour be justc  To my Honour  AIR  BELFORD  I  Cupid befriends us  His Sanction he lends us  Rebuking our idle Delay▪  He points to the Glade  Where his Honours are paid  And he cries Come away come away  II  Away with denying  The Moments are flying  And fleet is the Season of Love  The God will repent  Of the Grace he has lent  If the Favours we will not improve  III  On those who obey  And are fond of his Sway  Profusely his Blessings he show'rs  Then seize we the Time  That if lost by our Crime  Ah never again may be ours  DUETT  HARRIET and BELLFORD  Love and Freedom now uniting  Speak the happy Moments nigh  Now to Hymen's Fane inviting  Glad their golden Course they ply  And in his Behest delighting  Scatter Blessings as they fly  AIR  MARYANN  Tell me Love tell me Love  Tell the Fate I'm doom'd to prove  Hope now shines with cheerful Ray  Smiling Joys around me play  Cupid say Cupid say  Will the flatt'ring Vision stay  Let no mournful Change appear  Gloomy Sorrow boding Fear  Tell me Love c  AIR  HARRIET  I  Submission's the Lover's best Grace  Loud Accents and Menaces rude  Each other Perfection efface  By Softness the Fair is subdu'd  II  The Glances that partly reveal  And partly suppress the soft Pain▪  Mute Sighs to the Soul that appeal  These only the Fair can obtain  AIR  HARRIET  Come my good Guardian and compare  The Bloom of Youth with aged Care  As you to Time to you I bow  But here have pledg'd my faithful Vow  Believe me Youth hath many Charms  Which long ago has left thy Arms  Be patient Sir this Flight will prove  A School for Guardians kept by Love  FINALE▪  BRUMPTON  Affection born of wild Desires  Uncertain transient Joys inspires  But built on firm and fair Esteem▪  It then affords a Bliss supreme  Chor  It then affords c  MARYANN  Affection oft is truer seen  When sporting round the rural Green  Than there where Wealth and Pow'r reside  Tho' deck'd in all the Pomp of Pride  Chor  Tho' deck'd c  HARRIET  By Nature Love was first design'd  A gen'ral Good to all Mankind  "And Love like Air was widely giv'n  The purest noblest Gift of Heav'n"  Chor  The purest noblest c  BELFOLD  Love himself will find the Way  His faithful Vot'ries to repay  And decent Hymen most reveres  Consenting Hearts and equal Years  Chor  Consenting Hearts c  OLDCASTLE  and  LOVIBOND  together  Tho' foolish once grown wiser now  Let us this honest Truth allow  That decent Hymen most reveres  Consenting Hearts and equal Years  GENERAL CHORUS  Affection born of wild Desires c  FINIS
