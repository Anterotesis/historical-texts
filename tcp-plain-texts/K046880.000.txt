at the CrossKeys between the  TempleGates  in  Fleetstreet    TO Her Royal Highness THE PRINCESS of  WALES  MADAM  _A Princess of the same Royal Blood to which you are so closely and so happily ally'd presumes to throw her self at the Feet of YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS for Protection The Character of that Excellent Lady as it is deliver'd down to us in History  is very near the same with the Picture I have endeavour'd to draw of her And if in the Poetical Colouring I have aim'd at heightning and improving some of the Features it was only to make her more worthy of those Illustrious Hands to which I always intended to present her  As the  British  Nation in general is infinitely indebted to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS so every particular Person amongst us ought to contribute according to their several Capacitys and Abilitys towards the discharging that Publick Obligation  We are your Debtors MADAM for the Preference You gave us in chusing to wear the  British  rather than the  Imperial  Crown for giving the Best Daughter to our KING and the Best Wife to our PRINCE It is to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS we owe the Security that  shall be deliver'd down to our Childrens Children by a most Hopeful and Beautiful as well as a Numerous Royal Issue These are the Bonds of our Civil Duty  ut YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has  aid us under others yet more Sacred and Engaging I mean those of Religion You are not only the Brightest Ornament  ut the Patroness and Defender of our Holy Faith  Nor is it  Britain  alone but the World  t the present and all succeeding Ages  ho shall bless Your Royal Name for the greatest Example that can be given of a Disinterested Piety and Unshaken Con  ancy  This is what we may certainly reckon  mongst the Benefits YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS has confer'd upon us Tho  the same time how partial soever we  ay be to our selves we ought not to believe  You declin'd the First Crown of  Europe  in regard to  Britain  only No MADAM it is in Justice to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS that we must confess you had more excellent Motives for so great an Action as that was Since You did it in Obedience to the Dictates of Reason and Conscience for the Sake of True Religion and for the Honour of God All things that are Great have been offer'd to You and all things that are Good and Happy as well in this World as a Better shall become the Reward of such Exalted Virtue and Piety The Blessings of our Nation the Prayers of our Church with the faithful Service of all good Men shall wait upon YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS as long as You live And whenever for the Punishment of this Land You shall be taken from us your Sacred Name shall be dear to Remembrance and Almighty God who alone is able shall bestow upon you the Fulness of Recompence  Amongst the several Offerings of Duty which are made to You here be grasiously pleas'd to accept of this Unworthy Trifle which is with the greatest Repect and lowest Submission presented to YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS by  MADAM  YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS's Most Obedient Most Devoted and Most Faithful Humble Servant N ROWE  PREFACE  _THO I have very little Inclination to writ  Preface before Works of this nature yet upon this particular Occasion I cannot but think my self oblig'd to give some short Account of this Play  justice to my self as to a very Learned and Ingenious  man my Friend who is dead The Person  Mr  Smith  of  ChristChurch Oxon  one whose  I could with great pleasure enter into if it was  very well known to the World As I had the Happiness to be intimately acquainted with him he often told me  sign'd writing a Tragedy upon the Story of the Lady  Jane Gray  and if he had liv'd I should never have  ought  meddling with it my self But as he dy'd without doing  in the beginning of the last Summer I resolv'd to undertake  And indeed the hopes I had of receiving some considerable As+sistances from the Papers he left behind him were one of  principal Motives that induc'd me to go about it These Pa+pers were in the hands of Mr  Ducket  to whom my Fri  Mr  Tho Burnett  was so kind to write and procure 'em for me The least Return I can make to those Gentlemen is this publick Acknowledgment of their great Civility on th  occasion I must confess before those Papers came to my  and I had intirely form'd the Design or Fable of my own Play And when I came to look 'em over I found it was very different from that which Mr  Smith  intended the Plan of his being drawn after that which is in Print of Mr  Banks  at least I thought so by what I could pick out of his Papers To say the truth I was a good deal sur  iz'd and disappointed at the sight of 'em I hop'd to have  et with great part of the Play written to my hand or at  ast the whole Design regularly drawn out Instead of that  found the quantity of about two Quires of Paper written over  odd pieces blotted interlin'd and confus'd What was  ntain'd in 'em in general was loose Hints of Sentiments  short obscure Sketches of Scenes But how they were  be apply'd or in what order they were to be rang'd I  uld not by any Diligence of mine and I look'd 'em very  refully over more than once come to understand One  cene there was and one only that seem'd pretty near per  ct in which Lord  Guilford  singly persuades the Lady  ne to take the Crown From that I borrow'd all that I  uld and inserted it in my own third Act But indeed the  er and Turn of his Fable was so different from mine  I could not take above five and twenty or thirty Lines at  most and even in those I was oblig'd to make some Al  ration I should have been very glad to have come into a  rtnership of Reputation with so fine a Writer as Mr  Smith  but in truth his Hints were so short and dark many 'em mark'd ev'n in ShortHand that they were of little  service to me They might have serv'd as Indexes  own Memory and he might have form'd a Play out of  'em but I dare say no body else could In one part of  Design he seem'd to differ from Mr  Banks  whose Tale  generally design'd to follow since I observ'd in many of those short Sketches of Scenes he had introduc'd Queen  Mary  He seem'd to intend her Character Pitiful and inclining to Mercy but urg'd on to Cruelty by the Rage and  Dispositions of  Bonner  and  Gardiner  This Hint  wise taken from the late Bishop of  Salisbury  's  the Reformation  who lays and I believe very  horrible Cruelties that were acted at that time  charge of that Persecuting Spirit by which the  then animated than to the Queen's own natural Disp  Many People believ'd or at least said that Mr Smi  left a Play very near entire behind him All that I am  for is that it was not so in fact I should have  scruple of taking three four or even the whole five  from him but then I hope I should have had the  to let the World know they were his and not take  Man's Reputation to my self  This is what I thought necessary to say as well  own account as in regard to the Memory of my Friend  For the Play such as it is I leave it to prosper  can I have resolv'd never to trouble the World with  publick Apologies for my Writings of this kind as much  have been provok'd to it I shall turn this my young Child out into the World with no other Provision

unconquerable Flame  Creeps in his Veins and drinks the Streams of Life  His youthful Sinews are unstrung cold Sweats  And deadly Paleness sit upon his Visage  And ev'ry Gasp we look shall be his last

Journey's End oppos'd in View  A Thousand thwarting Paths break in upon us  To puzzle and perplex our wandring Steps  Love Friendship Hatred in their Turns mislead us  As ev'ry Passion has its separate Interest  Where is that piercing Foresight can unfold  Where all this mazy Error will have end  And tell the Doom reserv'd for me and  Pembroke  There is but one End certain that isDeath  Yet ev'n that Certainty is still incertain  For of these several Tracks which lye before us  We know that one leads certainly to Death  But know not which that one is 'Tis in vain  This blind divining let

Allow me but to look on you and sigh  'Tis all the humble Joy that  Guilford  asks  LJG  Still wilt thou frame thy Speech to this vain Purpo  When the wan King of Terrors stalks before us  When Universal Ruin gathers round  And no Escape is left us Are we not  Like Wretches in a Storm whom ev'ry Moment  The greedy Deep is gaping to devour  Around us see the pale despairing Crew  Wring their sad Hands and give their Labour over  The Hope of Life has ev'ry Heart forsook  And Horror sits on each distracted Look  One solemn Thought of Death does all employ  And cancels like a Dream Delight

Spoken by Mrs PORTER  THE Palms of Virtue Heroes oft have worn  Those Wreaths tonight a Female Brow adorn  The De  rin'd Salar unfortunately Brave  those Altars which she strove to save  she dar'd to prop the Juster Side  greatly with her adverse Fate comply'd  that Heav'n cou'd ask Resign'd and Dy'd  the Land for which she wish'd to Live  And gain'd that Liberty she could not give  Oh Happy People of this Fav'rite Isle  On whom so many better Angels smile  For you kind Heav'n new Blessings still supplies  other Saints and other Guardians rise  For you the Fairest of her Sex is come  Adopts our  Britain  and forgets her Home  For Truth and you the Heroine declines  Austria  's Proud Eagles and the  Indian  Mines  What Sense of such a Bounty can be shown  But Heav'n must make the vast Reward its own  And Stars shall join to form her future Crown  Your Gratitude with ease may be express'd  Strive but to be what she wou'd make you Bless'd  Let no vile Faction vex the vulgar Ear  With fond Surmise and false affected Fear  Confirm but to your selves the given Good  'Tis all She asks for all She has bestow'd  Such was our great Example shown today  And  Thanks our Author's Pains repay  If  Scenes to guard your Faith you learn  If for your Laws to shew a just Concern  If you are taught to dread a Popish Reign  Our Beauteous Patriot has not dy'd in vain  A PROLOGUE to Lady JANE GRAY sent by an Unknown Hand  WHEN waking Terrors rouze the guilty Breast  And satal Visions break the Murd'rer's Rest  When Vengeance does Ambition's Fate decree  And Tyrants bleed to set whole Nations free  Tho the Muse saddens each distressed Scene  Unmov'd is ev'ry Breast and ev'ry Fate serene  The mournful Lines no tender Heart subdue  Compassion is to suff'ring Goodness due  The Poet your Attention begs once more  T' atone for Characters here drawn before  No Royal Mistress sighs through ev'ry Page  And breathes her dying Sorrows on the Stage  No lovely Fair by soft Persuasion won  Lays down the Load of Life when Honour's gone  Nobly to bear the Changes of our State  To stand unmov'd against the Storms of Fate  A brave Contempt of Life and Grandeur lost  Such glorious Toils a Female Name can boast  Our Author draws not Beauty's heavenly Smile  T' invite our Wishes and our Hearts beguile  No soft Enchantments languish in her Eye  No Blossoms sade nor sick'ning Roses die  A nobler Passion ev'ry Breast must move  Than youthful Raptures or the Joys of Love  A Mind unchang'd superiour to a Crown  Bravely defies the angry Tyrant's Frown  The same if Fortune sinks or mounts on high  Or if the World's extended Ruins lie  With gen'rous Scorn she lays the Scepter down  Great Souls shine brightest by Misfortunes shown  With patient Courage she sustains the Blow  And triumphs o'er Variety of Woe  Through ev'ry Scene the sad Distress is new  How well feign'd Life does represent the true  Unhappy Age who views the bloody Stain  But must with Tears record  Maria  's Reign  When Zeal by Doctrine flatter'd lawless Will  Instructed by Religion's Voice to kill  Ye  British  Fair lament in silent Woe  Let ev'ry Eye with tender Pity flow  The lovely Form through falling Drops will seem  Like flou'ry Shadows on the silver Stream  Thus beauty Heaven's sweet Ornament shall prove  Enrich'd by Virtue as ador'd by Love  Forget your Charms fond Woman's dear Delight  The Fops will languish here another Night  No Conquest from dissembline Smiles we fear  She only kills who wounds us with a Tear
