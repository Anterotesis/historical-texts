 A WEEK at a COTTAGE  a Pastoral Tale  Gent antiq  LONDON Printed for  HAWES CLARKE COLLINS  in Paternosterrow  MDCCLXXV  SUNDAY OPENS the SCENE  FOR ever sacred to TRANQUILLITY sweet rural scenes where CON∣TEMPLATION sits and meditates on God's benevolence  RETIREMENT plaud the poets peace∣ful seat with hands of grave HUMILITY forbidding OSTENTATIONS steps PRIDE'S arrogance or fickle TASTE to tread her hallow'd bounds  HitherO hither come sweet social SCIENCE leading on CONTENTMENT with countenance serenehere hand in hand let MEDITATION walk with grave MORALITYwhilst IGNORANCE with con∣tumelious look averts her rustic foot and tells an aukward tale to ENVY and her sister fiends who minister in her un∣letter'd reign  The varied scene of HUMAN LIFE at once displays on this hand all the an∣xious grandeur of the GREAT on that sad INDIGENCES tears from whence RE∣FLECTION turns with a sigh and by her just comparisons disposes all my mind to GRATITUDE  Hail MEDIOCRITY thou blest estate depart not from thy happy votary seated on the centre of PLEASURES wheel safe from AMBITIONS giddy flights and POVERTY'S depression thou ensures me PEACE  For this RETREAT I leave the busy Town where TRAFFICK with a brow be∣set with cares and shoulders bending to the burthen walks Adventures restless mazes and her labyrinths of Hopeon whose hard indefatigable heel full of∣ten sullen DISAPPOINTMENT treads whilst from her meagre visage she rubs the sickly sweat with rags disconsolateor if  attended by some better fate perchance comes sportive LUCK in steps fantastick and with prosperity rewards the Toils of TRADE relieves INDUSTRY'S soul of doubtfulness yet teints the jaundic'd eye with AVARICE and gives another countenance to CARE  Away away ATTENTION hither haste to rove the Sylvan scene the plain the valley and the grove leave the dull haunts of mercenary men and gains in∣satiable gaze to court the smiles of ru∣ral INNOCENCE and catch the living Virtues as they riseperuse the flow'ry page of NATURE'S book and reaping  WISDOM with the arms of scientific pleasure soar aloft and breath thy ado∣ration to the GOD OF ALL  There stands the COTT where fancy strays A WEEK and gathers up the beauties of the scene  On elevated ground erected it com∣mands extensive PROSPECTS stretching every way placed on the skirts of a small VILLAGE where lofty Sycamores with spreading boughs dispense their shade around its tenementsbeneath the leafy covert oft at ease the Peasant fits sagacious musing on the ev'ning clouds as weatherwisethere the rus∣tic  Damsel loit'ring in the dayfall gloom communes with telltale inti∣mates describing LOVE so natural and naked that each fond confidant with sympathetic Sighs salutes the well dis∣cover'd passion whilst each stands wish∣ing panting and on firethere too at seasons sits the Matron of the Village whose wrinkled brow confesses Age but yet denies severity for as she bends her weaken'd sight upon the polish'd nee∣dles whilst she knits she courts facetious prattle from the Babes who pull the pansies on the green and smiles to hear them lisp their Granny's tale and imi∣tate her prayer  Surrounded with a shadowy grove the RUINS of an ABBY lift their solemn fronts and shew their bending archesin the distracted pomp of wasting columns tot'ring walls and gasping windows all the havoc of infatuated zeal stands cha∣racteriz'd whilst in widowweeds of mantling Ivy sage RELIGION sits and mourns the desolation of her house and the sad sins of her degenerate Sons  There the Groves of Rkby stretching round her park o'ertop the wallsweet scenes of Rural ease and Ele∣gancewhere GA flying from the heathy mountains precipitates her streams from rock to rock 'till in the  bosom of exulting Ts the river Nymph resigns her auburn tresses and nutbrown charms in murmurs o  soft extacy and Lovehigh hanging woods repeat the sounds mix'd with the plaintive voice of amorous Doves who coo their tale of jealousy for every absent mate  Here Nature with dignity sublime excells the works of Art and forms a so∣lemn walk where massive rocks with august Columns prop the oaken grove that hangs upon their tow'ring Cliffs the far projecting trees spread wide their boughs and give a leafy Canopy▪ umbriferous forming a scene whe  where WISDOM would delight to con∣template where MEDITATION met with PIETY would hold their holy converse and sage PHILOSOPHY would sit unseen to study Natureonce made the haunt of sad DISSATISFACTIONS gloomy steps where MELANCHOLY measured out her pensively reiterated Walkthere un∣redeeming Rkby often stray'd to meditate on the forlorn fate of his pa∣ternal Landsthere too projecting Rbn hath sat to see his sweet De∣mesnes from his unfeeling genius transform'd to Stone to plan the proud devouring Edifice which swallow'd up these fertile fields and all this paradise  now MTT is thy Lord whose elegance of Taste is with the zone of PRUDENCE girt and whose provident sa∣gacity engrafts DESCRETION on his PLEASURES  Near to thy streams O GA once the Praefect lay of fam'd SOLENCES and the plain was burthen'd with a Roman Hostoft in thy waters have the He∣roes laved their valarous Limbs and oft along thy channel stray'd delighted with fertilityhere too the Altar blaz'd to festive CERES and the Grove re∣sounded with the rights of PAN  to them another Host succeeded  usurp'd their Lustrals and their Altars and pitch'd their Tent on MRNS plains to foster foreign Piety in these rich Landsthe fair Exotic ask'd for happy vales where Nature lavish'd her luxuriancy the mountain and the rock where in the days of Yore the Sage had sought the presence of his God the gloomy Forest and the dark damp Cave were not befitted to her soft Italian Con∣stitution  Too long my Pen dwells on thy scenes ORKBY whilst other objects wait my Musewhere TPE in rural  opulence surmounts the Hill and to the Eastern sun extends its golden meads  beneath whose feet deep in the silent and sequester'd Dale a friend to Science lives a letter'd Sage devoted to Tranquillity and sacred Truth where pious WKFF once convers'd with God  Wide spreading Groves and deep em∣bow'ring shades wrap up in solemn stillness TL'S Mansionwhere the dis∣contented Genius of the Glades sits sigh∣ing for the absence of her Lord who from her haunts estranges science and Philosophy the Muses and the Graces  and carries them as Captives far from his long deserted Lands  Those lines of dusky Pines which mark DN'S rich Demesnes shut up the prospect  There thro' an Arch of Boughs the elevated Fane of KY strikes the eye and gives its sacred Tower to form a noble distant Obelisk  And here the woody banks of BRGM are bent up to the mountains brow where MK still inherits the Pa∣trician Virtues and marks the ways of Life with such benevolence as purchas'd for his Ancestors immortal Love  Still nearer lie the Lands of EN where cultivation with a comely counte∣nance sits smiling in its youth and makes abash'd the neighbouring hills where Nature sleeps in native russet wrap'd in indolence and barrenness where HE forlorn creeps from the gloomy mountains side and hides its claybuilt Cottagesfrom whence a winding way is mark'd aloft ascending to the summit of the steep conducting to the golden regions and the Mines of Patriotic TR and Paternal S whose knees benevolent are crowded with his Childrens Children  The SOUTHERN PROSPECT calls for my Attention  the nearest object is the TOWN OF B where on the hanging steep the streets extend and pour their Thousands forth  There on the Cliff a ruin'd CASTLE stands and frowns impending o'er the foaming streams where Ts precipi∣tates his noisy floods and drives his frighted Neiades from the scene of Hor∣rorghastly and wild the disconcert∣ed Walls stand sullenly and brave the wrath of Timegloomy and dark their aspect as the Age in which the Scottish founder form'd his Plan and labour'd  up these Bulwarks and this mass of stone the work of

poisons every breath of young BENEVO∣LENCEhow graceful are the Labours  of the few who struggle by example to envigorate the fainting VIRTUES where HK for fraternal Love and filial Piety rever'd

I were awaya listles∣ness hangs on me I know not how that gives me little rest and yet it is a kind of melancholy pleasure      Tell me my MARIANNE from whence these new sensations come      My heart is open to my Mother's EyeConcealment is not known with∣in my soulyou know the gay OLIS∣SUS the lord of yonder rich Demesnes he talk'd to me of LOVEand with  a graceful person flow'ry Tongue and strange humility of tenderness discover'd to me first the Character of a LOVER for indeed I had not form'd the least Idea what a Lover meant    "And what ensued my Girl" the Matron hastily reply'd for to her bosom glowing with wishes for her Daughter's welfare AMBITION had insi∣nuated its delusive visions  On his pursuit of Pleasure here he stray'dhis Dogs were in the Thicket after gamehe bearing on his Arm a Gun surprized me at my Work then it was I first beheld OLISSUS  he seem'd to eye me with a fond at∣tentionabash'd to beat the looks of this rich man I blush'd and walk'd awayhe follow'd me and ask'd my Name and where I dwelt and who belong'd I tonever asham'd to own my Habitation or my dear Mother I reply'd with Truth and shew'd him where our COTTAGE stood and talk'd of youhe look'd

trembledobserving my confusion h  bow'd and left me      I never thought of the ever for many days till again I saw O∣LISSUS coming towards me in the Grove where I sat to shelter me from Noo  tide heatwhen he approach'd beheld the character of benevolen  imprinted on his looks his eyes we  flashing with good humourI attempt¦ed to arise but he prevented me ar  sat down by my sidewith a degree of fervor which I never had perceiv'd i  any man he talk'd to me of Love assur'd me that his soul was languish∣ing and all his Happiness depend  on my smilesI wonder'd at his words and grew afraidhis face be∣gan to glow like the Countenance of a Man in Wrath his lips were trem∣bling and his eyes grew piercing then seizing my hand he grasp'd me passionately I shrunk awaywith soft persuasion and the gentlest accents he still'd my apprehensionas I grew bolder he grew bolder toohe cast one Arm about my waist and kiss'd my cheekI thought his lips were burninghe sigh'd and seem'd uneasy I was abash'dConfusion grew upon meI was overwhelm'd with shame and yet I gain'd recollection  sufficient to enable me to reprove him for his boldnessyou kill me with your frown says heyou make me tremble Sirindeed I am much a∣sham'd and terrifiedyour blushes set my bosom in a blaze your eyes dis∣solve my soul says he and press a  himself upon meI bent back and shun'd his KissesI tumbled on the Green    "Alas my MARIANNE" the Ma∣tron cries  Then unbounded in his Kisses he planted them upon my Bosomhis hands were wand'ring over my Neck I was flutter'd distress'd and out  of breathhe saw my MiseryOh my Mother the remembrance agitates me grievouslyfor giddy with the strange unusual freedom and my fright I was ready to expire within his Arms when he perceiving my Distress and weak Estate seiz'd the occasion  he paus'd  With eyes and hands directed up to  eaven the Matron sat mute  Again she breaks the awful tho'  omentary silence  At that instant he display'd himself in the most amiable Characterhe arose and bending to∣wards me took my trembling hand and rais'd meHe seem'd to pity me  how godlike was his figure in h  Pitythe expressions of Charity and Benevolence were stamp'd upon h  featuresa gracious greatness sho  upon his Countenance and like the saving Angel he appear'd who le  the brokenhearted HAGAR'S fainting steps to streams of water in the W  ¦dernessyour Images of Love str  my mind with the just similitude o  my mishap and brought your co  ¦demnations home upon my own impru∣dencefor 'till the strange event was past I never conceiv'd the danger I was exposed to or weighed the wi  disparities of fortune the inequalities  between usI thought he utter'd truths and entertaining no impulse of guile I doubted no deceitbut since that time dear Mother I have trembled at the recollection of myself for I have heard say that Man is often base and can dissemble and coun∣terfeit the Passions of a Lovercan vow such Vows and tell such Tales as cheat poor Innocentscan like the barbarous Man who slays a Lamb di∣vest himself of all Humanity pos∣sess the Virgins moment of distress and whilst she places all her virtuous confidence and holy faith upon de∣lusive promises and whilst he  plants the rapturous kiss to seal the lips which breath her Innocence his heart is harbouring the worst of wish∣es and the Maiden is lost in Wiles alas my MotherI tremble at the precipice on which I trod    The Matron shook her head and sigh'd  and yet thou art not from that pre∣cipice escap'dwithin thy bosom lurks the Traitor that will yield thee back into OLISSUS' Arms  The affrighted MARIANNE dropt upon her knee and holding forth her hands beseech'd her Mother to discover the in∣siduous  sentiment which threat'ned to  ndo her  What was that listlesness my MA∣  IANNE of which you talk'd that gave you little rest yet seem'd to be a me∣lancholy pleasure  OLISSUS name" replies the Maid has no connection with those senti∣mentsof him or his professions I have never thought but with a blush no tenderness of mind is due to him if Love is known by such sensations as I heretofore spoke of that Love belongs not to OLISSUSno another claims my sighs    The Matron's silence gave liberty to MARIANNE to tell her Tale  Some months since when winter cloath'd the ground with snow I went to visit my poor Lamb which went with neighbour SYMKINS Flock upon the Fellthe pretty Animal was given to me by ALCIRIS CYMON'S sonits mother dear creature dy'd soon after it was born and then the little Or∣phan wanting sustenance was trusted to my tenderness and Carewith great compassion I beheld its desolate Estate helpless and harmlessin its looks were soft distresses written and in  languid eye express'd dejected Inno∣cence its cries were pitiful complain∣ings and my compassion succeeded to its moanI fed it with my hands I made its couch of Wool I heard its calls of hunger and I tended it with tendernessthe pretty female grew in strengthas if its little heart was mo∣ved with gratitude it follow'd to my call and lifted up its face to court my looks its Countenance express'd the pleasures of its mind whilst on its curling wool I stroak'd my hand grown older in my walks it walk'd and whilst I sat it crop'd the blades of grass play'd round my seat and  when some length of time elaps'd with∣out my calling on its name it came and bleated in my face and seem'd to court continuance of my care or seem'd to fear I had neglected her these were pretty tricks which won my heart and of its innocence and sweetness sure I was enamour'dfor I lov'd the Lamb as now I seem to love a Swain whom may the Heavens be pleas'd my Mother may ap∣prove      ALCIRIS met me trudging in the snow the sheep were gather'd on the Hillocks where they stood lamenting and dismay'd hungry and trembling  for my Lamb I wepthe caught it up and bare it in his arms home to our COTTas then I loved the Lamb I lik'd the man who saved it from the misery it felthe ask'd a poor reward for such his care and with good will I yielded ithe ask'd a kiss he took it for his pains and for my Lamb I gave him one againmy transport made me bold for all my mind was full of the dear Lamb I never thought of what it was I didbut re∣collection soon rush'd upon me my confusion was almost immediate and blushes were incessanthe gaz'd upon me with looks of languishment mixing  with smiles an expression not to be described was in his eyesthen was the time I first perceiv'd peculiar pleasure in the conversation of a Man and thence I first began to observe the image of his Sex with more than cold indifferencefor my involuntary gaze ran rambling over his figure with a curiosity fraught with pleasure I beheld him tall and well propor∣tion'dhis limbs are not robust but of a gentle turnhis jetty Locks break careless o'er his neck in ringlets his garb tho' homely shews his form to some advantagehis brow is open his eyes as dark as sloes look quick  as sparks struck from the Travellers horseshoe in the Lanes at night and make one start with the acuteness of the flashhis cheek is ruddy with the glow of Health where smiles sit goodnaturedly in dimples and from his lips the softest Voice in sweet in mild and modest accents fallhis edu∣cation far beyond his station gives him sentiments and phraze would make my Mother wondera SHEPHERD in his occupation but above OLISSUS in his WisdomMy MARIANNE he says the Lamb's an Orphan bereft of aidit has lost its ParentAnimals of Prey will soon devour it if it is  not foster'd by theeall ORPHANS are exposed to perilspreserve my Lamb and let me be thy ShepherdI won∣der'd at his talkthou art says he just as this Lamb bereft of that good Parent who might defend sustain and bring thee out of Dangersthy antient mother may instruct thee b  the wisdom of all precept is confoun∣ded by evil Fortune and subject to the subtilties of Knaves as Aspines tremble to every breezethe Wood∣bine unsupported dangles in the dust and untimely all her sweets and beauties languish and expiremy Arm  methinks could find for thee Protec∣tion my bosom could ensure a resting place my Industry could earn thee Competency and ComfortI guess'd not at his wishes    And I could love my Lamb for∣ever he cries      then it was I first was struck with comprehensionI told him that my Mother ruled my Actions and that I had not entertain'd a Wish to call my own    but wilt thou adds he with a degree of impatiency hear me tell my Passion for I love thee as my Life  I first observ'd thee at the Chapel and I thought I saw an Angel praymy Soul was set on fire and I was all En∣thusiasm my Devotion was carry'd to a fervor beyond what I had before experiencedyet whilst I kneel'd my mind began to wander and my thoughts would often stray from hea∣ven replete with Love of theeI che∣rish'd the fond flame and oft it led me musing in the Grove and oft my fancy wander'd inspired by thy i∣mage as on the Hill I lay to tend my Sheepwhen e'er I tuned my Pipe thou wert the music of my Mind and  full of thee each warbling sonnet tril'd oft to myself I talk'd and prais'd thy Charms and pray'd for thy em∣bracethe Beachen bark stands letter'd with thy name the Limetree bears the emblems of my Love      as thus he talk'd my Bosom heav'd with hasty breathing on my cheeks the colour arose and tears stood in my eyeshe press'd my hand to his soft lips whilst my impatient bosom throb'd to exchange the pleasure      he added to wedlock fairest MARIANNE my wishes lead for it would equal a state of Paradise to have thee mine      I bid him talk to you of Mar∣riage here in this Dale he often comes in these sequester'd Plains we walk and in yonder long green Lane beneath the shade of Hawthorns our talk is full of gentleness and the more he professes himself the Lover  seems the more abash'd timorous and doubtful to offendnot like OLISSUS whose impetuous Passion kindling up from sparks blazed out in vehemence and terrified me with a flood of Kisses when ALCIRIS is here the hours seem enviously short and he is de∣parting before I think I have wel∣comed him his kindness delights my  recollectionI could think of him for everIf this is LOVE

which when elapsed re∣signs mankind to Care  JENNETTA sigh'dthe Father ceas'd the Maid cries out  Why what am Iof what am I compounded unlike my Parents and unlike my  BrotherI neither feel the pleasure which my father pictures or my Bro∣ther tastes nor doth my mind con∣ceive what kind of Joy this Love in∣spires I often thought the strang  contagion was a kind of Madness i  which the Patient was busy'd with e¦ternal fever of the Mind and Image extravaganta malady of thought a wild conception of delights delu¦sive as the Images of a deliriuma other times I looked upon it as a  intoxication a disease that drowns the Judgment and benumbs the nerves am I by nature blighted mishapen i  ¦form and in my sensations untoned  and unharmonizedI feel myself in no wise made deficient Judgment rules my thoughts and all my senses own the same impulse as others of my Sex experienceSurely this deficiency is in the soul for by my Father's talk it seems this Love is sentiment not mere sensationI cannot com∣prehend itto yield to conjectures is to lead to anxietybut of ALCIRIS'S fatherif your experience shews that Love's a transitory scene of vague in∣stable transports and that wealth pro∣cures a lifelong Joy wherefore do you hesitate you love your Son and from parental principles would save  him from his folliesforbid his inter¦course with MARIANNE I hate he haughtiness and arrogance of Wi

fortieth yearher form is comely tho' not beautifulher Education rural and domesticher Acres spread the Val∣ley with grassy walks for Pleasure's  stepsher golden furrows laugh with Opulence and on her

stood low'ring on OLD CYMON'S browhe sighedand from his murmurs no Articulation escaped but just the name of Money    Extravagance would hold re∣vels in the stores which your Industry gain'd and a

Poets Visions and drunken dreams which constitute the Dramavain tittle tattle fit only to become the conver∣sation of those who hold the hands of indolencebut ANNA can adorn the marriage Life with maxims pluck'd from the pinions of Prudence and pro∣priety of Judgment ensuring wealth with hand assiduous and the measures of frugality    The father clasping both his hands upon his breast reply'd  I love my Son such is the human Mind that if the Lad should be restrain'd in this his early passion all the wealth that I can give may but increase his wretch∣ednessLove sometimes is so fickle that with indulgence it grows lan∣guid sickens and dies if Love is well established if it depends not on out∣ward beauties but is fed by excel∣lencies of the mind and Virtue and is supported by pure Judgment it will never be liable to extinction nay there is even a bias of the Mind which arises in Nature and Nature  herself from Sympathy influences man's heart the common proverb is that marriages are made in Hea∣ven implying that our Love is in∣voluntary but how we for the sake of Prudence may counteract this Passion there is the rubby indul∣gence in a course of years it may grow faint but then becoming tem∣perate it may grow into an indissolu∣ble Friendshipso was my Love of ELLENa friendship which with mutual pleasure flows and all the measures of a mutual mind Friend∣ship on mutual

from all the busy world conceal'd I'll tell thee such a Tale as rocks alone should witness to and Mountains shadow with their frowns    through all the winding tracks they haste with silent steps they

me of the Pain  I suffer'd thro' my Compassion for a little Wrenand little as the Object was it caus'd me with a thousand tears to think of my dear Mother and to feel the supposition that the Case might once be her's      Within a little Cell a Wren had built her nest as every day I sat with∣in her Eye she grew familiar as she grew assured I was no foefor every day I scatter'd Crumbs to feed the lit∣tle pairwith pleasure I beheld their mutual Care and Assiduity whilst they constructed all their pretty nest and form'd the safe repository of the Eggs with which she teem'dI often  view'd his tenderness and Love how he would play gay anticks on the bough and chirm his wild Notes to divert his incubating Matehow he would peck the insect from the leaf and with exulting Pinions bear the dainty to his Hen o'er whose repast he sat with flutt'ring feathers as if he tasted transport in her Appetite in∣dulgedthis daily pleasure I possess'd but after all as if the joys of human Minds were preordain'd to be dash'd out by disappointment's hand as I was sitting there a fullen Hawk with savage Eye decerned the Wren and stooping struck him with his cruel  Tallonsthe Hen perceiv'd the blow

Father was no more      Oh MARIANNE your tender I∣mages at once delight and torture interrupts the Holy Man the picture is so striking that my Mind transports its sad Ideas to another Scene      A parent Wren says she can give but small protection to his pro∣geny  but Wrens have their propor∣tion to their Enemies and Man can nothing boast superior for the wrath of Fortune the enmity of an inve¦terate World will ever be superior to the bravest Father of the human race  "A melancholy truth"    Five little Wretches fill'd th  Nestthe Mother in her tenderness and Care absorb'd the Sorrows of he  Widowhood and tasted hopes for he  small progenyI saw her passage to an  fro in quest of foodI heard their Call  and her Reply and saw her swift retur  when e'er their Voice express'd Cala¦mityand when she brought th  diet o'er her brood with lapsing qui∣vering Wing she hung expressing the soft feelings of her Maternal Heart      The birds were almost fledg'd and fit for flightthe Mother's assi∣duity was ripe for a reward and often had she thought of leading forth her infanttrain to Woods and Fountains and the World of Liberty and Joy when from yonder Village spoiling Boys in

 But of the Mother Wren with food encumbred home she cam  exulting in the labours of her flight she found her Nest despoil'd and rui  mark'd the havock made by sacrili¦gious hands in the destruction

sad Obduracy and sinful Avarice unable to sustain the wretched scene they both withdrewJENNETTA only staidand that no Vow no Voice might from her wicked Ear escape fast at the sick Man's back she laid to cut off all  the tenderness which true Love's deli∣cacy hates should bear another's Eye  Fair MARIANNE sat on her Knees close by the sick Man's bed and in her hands clasping his hand she pray'd her Voice was heard by Cherubims her virtuous Prayer was wafted up to Heaven where Angels with a Tear repeated SPARE HIM GOOD LORD  With ghastly smiles the Youth's diffigured Countenance was setthe

such Agitation would in∣crease ALCIRIS'S Malady they denied her readmittance to the room  Onward in the way CYMON attends the mourning MARIANNE on her return with silent steps she quits the Vale of Sorrow  When left alone the wretched Maiden stray'd in unknown paths and wander'd in the Woods 'till Night drew onthe pale Moon from the broken Clouds by intermissions gleam'd and glancing through the trees with many a  shadow trim'd the solemn Grove and many a pale shine cast that to the frighted Eye of fanciful dejection of∣ten stood the semblance of sad Spectres and the Ghost of her ALCIRIS

the astonish'd EMMA'S neck  "What means my Lord" the Wi∣dow enclasp'd in his Arms scarce utter'd from the strange profusion of his kisses she trembled as he held her to his bosom    Thy surprize dear MATRON is not yet arrived to its pitch cries he Good EMMA look upon mein OLISSUS you behold the brother of AMINTOR    Tears dim'd the Matron's Eyes A∣stonishment was big within her heart    I was more

that your MARIANNE'S enamour'd of a merito∣rious Youth whose avaritious Father interferes and stays their Happiness I'll send to CYMON and promote the Match and with her give a dowry e∣qual to his
