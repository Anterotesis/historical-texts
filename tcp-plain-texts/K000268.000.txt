 Every Man in his Own Way  AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND  By  STEPHEN DUCK  LONDON  Printed for J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  and R DODSLEY in  Pallmall  MDCCXLI Price  s  Every Man in his Own Way AN EPISTLE TO A FRIEND  _'T WERE well my  Laelius  if I could pursue  That prudent Counsel which I had from You  To quit the Muse before her Spirits sink  Forsake my Rhymes and wash my Hands of Ink  But spite of all the Precepts You impart  This Itch of Scribbling  Parody of a Line in a late Poem  clings about my Heart  'Tis a Disease above the Doctor's Skill  Too stubborn to be cur'd with  Drop  or  Pill  AND yet believe me I have often try'd  To take your fav'rite Maxim for my Guide  Nil admirari  dwells upon your Tongue  So  Horace  sings and I approve his Song  But like  Medea  frantic in her Love  I cannot practise what I thus approve  Too fond of Verse I waste my precious Time  In Sounds and Similies and worthless Rhyme  Mad as the Priest who in poetic Rage  With Floods of Nonsense deluges the Stage  What tho' you damn one Offspring of his Brain  Prolific Dullness quickly spawns again  This Monster crush'd another strait appears  Head after Head the sprouting Hydra rears  Despising all the Censures of the Town  And ev'ry Person's Judgment but his own  For tho' pronounc'd a Fool by all the Pit  He impudently thinks himself a Wit  A SOBER Countryman as Stories say  Would visit  Bedlam  on a certain Day  Where as he pitied a poor Wretch's Case  The merry Madman laugh'd him in the Face  And cry'd Alas your Judgment's very bad  Believe me 'tis not I but You are mad  Mankind are run distracted ev'ry where  All but a few who keep their Senses  Here  You see our Madman tho' prodigious ill  Was happy in his own Opinion still  NOR lives a Wretch so wretched in the Town  But has some darling Pleasure of his own  Which he calls Happiness 'Tis my Delight  My Pleasure and my Happiness to write  For Happiness we various Ways explore  Some think it plac'd in Wealth and some in Pow'r  Others believe in Luxury it lies  In Women some and some in Butterflies  All other Gifts of Fortune are confin'd  But Pleasure's free and common as the Wind  The Cobler feels it often as the Peer  One's drown'd in Politics and one in Beer  One's pleas'd with Honours one with being drunk  This  fondly courts a Ribband  that  a Punk  THERE are who fix their Pleasure in a Race  Whose Acres lessen as their Steeds increase  Some place their Joys in ancient Coins and some  Admire the curious Busts of  Greece  and  Rome  Others in Painting all their Fortune waste  While dunning Tradesmen curse their lavish Taste  So much they honour the illustrious Dead  They wrong the Living of their daily Bread  In Building some consume a vast Estate  And only leave their Heirs the Walls to eat  These for a Supper many Hundreds pay  While those in Music tune their Wealth away  Thus diff'rent as our Faces are our Views  Yet each this Harlot  Happiness  pursues  This common Strumpet is by all ador'd  She's Mistress to the Fidler and the Lord  ONE whom her Charms unluckily delight  Courts her at Gamingtables ev'ry Night  No matter what her saucy Favours cost  He will enjoy her till his Fortune's lost  Careless of what his Wife and Chidren do  Let Wife and Children starve what's that to You  YOU may condemn our Gamesters if you please  But is he more ridiculous than these  Who count their glitt'ring Dirt essential Bliss  Umidius  has no other Joy but this  For Gold he studies strives and toils and sweats  For Gold he swears and lyes and jobs and cheats  Full fifty thousand Pounds he has in Store  And yet he covets fifty thousand more  No wild Profusion wastes his useless Hoard  No Soups or  French  Rago√ªs adorn his Board  But left such Diet should provoke his Lust  He dines like  Seneca  upon a Crust  And thinks the  Turks  Religion most divine  Because it has forbid them drinking Wine  ANOTHER who  Lucullus  would excel  In the luxurious Arts of eating well  Plump as a Swine of  Epicurus  looks  His God his Belly and his Glory Cooks  So many Dishes on his Board appear  'Twould surfeit you to read his Bill of Fare  And of one Dinner the Expence so large  Not  Peter  often could support the Charge  THE gay  Adonis  of a diff'rent Mind  Counts Love the  Summum Bonum  of Mankind  Love is the great Employment of his Life  A Passion very pleasing to a Wife  But Wife he is determin'd to have none  For our penurious Laws allow but one  Of willing Nymphs he keeps a mighty Store  Not  Solomon  himself had many more  These are his Happiness tho' Goats may be  Much happier Animals perhaps than  he  ACTEON rides the Fields with rapid Pace  He feels no Happiness but in a Chace  To him the Genius of his Hounds is known  And  Jowler's  Nature better than his own  Ask him if  Jowler  strives to starve her Young  He'll wonder at the Folly of your Tongue  Yet he more cruel wickedly inclines  To starve the native Issue of his Loins  Go to thy Dogs inhuman thoughtless Elf  Their Ways consider and be wise thyself  LORD  Fickle  with his virtuous Lady vext  Weds her one Day and widows her the next  'Tis hard to say the Pleasure of his Life  'Tis plain however 'tis not in a Wife  BIBLUS with thirsty Throat and firy Face  Has fix'd his chiefest Pleasure in a Glass  Drinking and Dozing are his dear Delight  All Day he dozes and he drinks all Night  His Wife and he alternate Watches keep  At Morning when she wakes he falls asleep  FAR other Thoughts young  Theron  's Bosom fire  Far other Joys his noble Breast inspire  No idle Pleasure charms the youthful Peer  Except the Pleasure of a Charioteer  Firm seated in the Box he smoaks along  The Jest and Wonder of the gazing Throng  Dextrous as Racers on  Olympian  Plains  He sounds the clashing Whip and shakes the loosen'd Reins  Proud to survey the Wheels impetuous roll  While all the Coachman's Glory warms his Soul  CHREMES devoutly mad forsakes his Wife  His Friends and Children for a future Life  He follows  Whitefield  by the Spirit driv'n  And starves himself on Earth to feast in Heav'n  To shun the fatal Rock on which he splits  Diagoras  employs his subtle Wits  Denies the Being of a God by Rule  And proves by Logicthat he is a Fool  Is there no Mean no Passage we can find  Safely to steer this Vessel of the Mind  Must we on  Scylla  or  Charybdis  run  When Dead be wretched or alive undone  GRACCHUS endow'd with admirable Parts  Polish'd with Learning Eloquence and Arts  Protects the People warmly in Debate  And all his Pleasure's to reform the State  He could adjust all Business of the Crown  And yet he never could adjust his own  Not that he wanted Wit for such Affairs  He had too much for low domestic Cares  His active scheming Head has always found  Too little Business which has turn'd it round  As pond'rous Ships immoderately great  For want of proper Ballast overset  OTHERS there are who use their utmost Skill  To climb Ambition's flatt'ring faithless Hill  To Posts and Dignities Today they rise  Tomorrow greater Honours tempt their Eyes  For these they struggle next they these acquire  Greater appear and greater they desire  Those too they gain Well now they have their Will  Or is this happy  Something  farther still  Alas my  Laelius  you mistake their Aim  Their Pleasure's in the Chace not in the Game  As arrant Sportsmen hunt thro' Bog and Brake  Not for their Hunger but Diversion's sake  See  Manlius  striving for his Lordship's Place  His Lordship very fain would be his Grace  The Serjeant treads upon the Judge's Heels  Th'impatient Judge anticipates the Seals  Some boldly vain like  Phaethon  aspire  And if indulg'd would set the World on Fire  Ev'n  Budgel  hop'd to guide the Reins of State  My Lord of  Lambeth's  miserably great  Oppress'd with Cares and Business all his Time  And harder still he can no higher climb  THE Muse my Friend might Thousands more relate  Led either by their Folly or their Fate  Who follow Pleasures of another Sort  Some go to  DruryLane  and some to Court  These rake in Stews those shine in Drawingrooms  Proud of their Cloaths as Peacocks of their Plumes  Who in their Dress such wond'rous Pleasure take  They wear their Happiness upon their Back  In Dress the gay Lord  Fopling  squanders more  Than would support an Hospital of Poor  For Dress in Debt  Fastidius  yearly runs  Patient of Scandal negligent of Duns  While  Curius  lewd and lavish on his Whores  Brings Claps and Fashions from the  Gallic  Shores  These have their Pleasures Is it then a Crime  In me to take the Privilege of Rhyme  BUT now methinks you whisper in my Ear  "This Itch of Rhyming carries you too far"  What is't to me you say whose Plays are dull  What is't to me who's Fop or Knave or Fool  Who games or swears or lyes or jobs or cheats  Who gain Preferments or who lose Estates  Men ever had their Pleasures ever will  In God's Name let them have their Pleasures still  But since in diff'rent ways they all incline  To have their Pleasures shall I not have mine  THERE's Mistress  Drummond  frequently will tell ye  The Spirit swells her like to burst her Belly  How shall she ease her Bosom of the Load  How but discharge and loose the lab'ring God  Shall Ease my Friend be found for her alone  Shall she have Remedy and I have none  WELL then proceed you say but mark the End  Writing will make you Foes tho' not a Friend  Besides 'twere Vanity to think your Lays  Should please a Critic's Ear or merit Praise  PRAISE is a Feather foreign to my Hope  Give it to THOMSON WARBURTON or POPE  When urgent Nature calls I write for Ease  The Call of Nature ev'ry one obeys  Alike the Learn'd and those who never learn  Whether 'tis in a College or a Barn  Whether on  Mincio  's Banks or in the Mint  When Nature bids us write we write and print  I KNOW your Judgment Sense and Taste require  A Bard to sing with Spirit Force and Fire  Compose such Numbers as the Ancients writ  Are Ancients then the only Men of Wit  Is Wit immutable Is nothing so  But what was writ Two thousand Years ago  Sure if it vary not 'tis mighty strange  Since much more sacred Things have suffer'd Change  BEFORE King  Harry  last of all the Name  To good Queen  Bess  's Mother told his Flame  What a mysterious Dress Religion wore  What Crops of Superstition  England  bore  Our pious Sires implicit Faith receiv'd  Believing what could hardly be believ'd  'Twas Sin to think their Bread compos'd of Flour  Or Two and Two equivalent to Four  Nor dar'd they reason in their own Defence  For the worst Heresy was common Sense  Or if they durst espouse the noble Cause  Of Nature's Right and Truth's eternal Laws  Bulls and Damnations thunder'd from the Press  And curs'd as zealously as Christ could bless  Now thank Reformers of a later Age  We can't complain of superstitious Rage  No  Flamen  cheats us with his holy Wiles  Nor  Smithfield  smoaks with frequent Fun'ral Piles  No Royal  Quixotes  lead their martial Pow'rs  To fight for Lady  Faith  on Foreign Shores  Yet grant Almighty Heav'n we may not fall  From too much Piety to none at all  THUS Modes of Faith have chang'd 'tis very plain  And Wit has chang'd and change it will again  This comforts  Mr  for we must allow  Tho' his damn'd Comedies are Folly now  They may be Wit perhaps to future Fools  If they escape Trunks Kitchens and Closestools  'TWERE hard indeed if nothing should be writ  But what was solid Sense or current Wit  Such rigid Laws would ruin Authors quite  Not One in Twenty would attempt to write  But as the Poets Case in  Britain  stands  We scorn tenacious Wit shou'd tie our Hands  We freely write whatever we devise  No matter whether Wit or Truth or Lyes  Thus bold  Lucilius  lashes half the Town  And teaches  Manners  tho' himself has none  At Peers and Prelates darts his poison'd Stings  Asperses Ministers and libels Kings  Rakes up the sacred Ashes of a Queen  To vent his Spite and gratify his Spleen  Thus  See  Harlequin Horace  p where the Author prosesses he has imitated the Style of Mr  Pope  He who mimics POPE'S immortal Pen  Tho' awkwardly as Monkeys mimic Men  With wicked Farce profanes the hallow'd Gown  And to expose our Folly shews his own  Thus  L  when at Leisure from the Stews  Thro' Dirt and Dung whips a lame jaded Muse  To number all would weary  Whitefield's  Lungs  Who scribble Journals and satiric Songs  Who rail at WALPOLE impotent and fierce  Barren of Thought yet prodigal of Verse  Guilty of Scandal innocent of Wit  They write worse Stuff than  Flecknoe  ever writ  And by the halfform'd Embryo's of the Scull  Abuse the Privilege of being dull  God save his Honour while such Authors write  He ought to thank their inoffensive Spite  And shall not I indulge my harmless Pen  And have my Way as well as other Men  YOU worthy  Laelius  have your Pleasure too  And quitting Crouds a nobler Way pursue  The Way of Truth and Virtue you explore  For this you turn the  Grecian  Sages o'er  For this You read what  Roman  Authors writ  Digest their Precepts and improve their Wit  In these and true Philosophy you find  A Muse to tune and harmonize your Mind  Who sings All Pleasure rightly understood  Consists alone in being Wise and Good  FINIS
