ou  Le Coracias  In Greek  and in modern Greek  Scurapola  in Cambden's Latin  Avis Incendiaria  in Italian  Spelviero    Taccola    Tatula    Pazon    Zorl    Cutta  in French  Chouette  and  Choucas Rouge  in German  Steintahen stonedaw    Steintulen    Steinkrae  Buff  CorvusGraculus  Linn and Gmel  Gracula Pyrrhocorax  Scop  Coracias  Aldrov and Briss  Coracias  seu  Pyrrhocorax  Ray  Cornix rostro pedibusque rubris  i e  The Crow with bill and feet red  Klein  The CornishChough    CornwallKae  or  Killegrew  Alb and Will  SOME authors have confounded this bird with the Alpine Crow but the distinction is clearly marked Its bill is longer more slender more hooked and of a red colour its tail is also shorter its wings longer and as a natural consequence its flight is more lofty and lastly its eyes are environed by a small red circle  It is true that the Redlegged Crow resembles the Alpine Crow in the colour and in some common  instincts In both the plumage is black with green reflections of blue and purple which have an admirable effect on that dark ground Both delight in the summits of the loftiest mountains and seldom descend into the plain The former however is much more diffused than the latter  The Redlegged Crow is of an elegant figure lively restless turbulent but can be tamed to a certain degree At first it is fed with a sort of paste made with milk bread and grain c and afterwards it is reconciled to whatever is served for our tables  Aldrovandus saw in Bologna in Italy a bird of this sort which had an odd trick of breaking panes of glass from the outside as if to enter the house by the window this instinct is undoubtedly the same with that of the crows the magpies and daws which are attracted by every thing that glitters It has even been known to snatch from the chimney light pieces of wood and thus set the house on fire so that this dangerous bird adds the character of an incendiary to that of a domestic plunderer But I should imagine that this pernicious habit might be turned against itself and like the lark it might be decoyed into snares by means of mirrors  Salerne saw at Paris two Redlegged Crows which lived peaceably with the house pigeons but it is probable that he had not seen the Wild Crow of Gesner nor the description which that  author gives of it since he says after Ray that it agreed in every thing but in size with the  coracias  whether he meant the bird to which this article is allotted or the  pyrrhocorax  of Pliny These birds are widely different and Gesner was careful not to confound them He knew that the Wild Crow differs from the Redlegged Crow by its crest its carriage the shape and length of its bill the shortness of its tail the excellence of its flesh at least when young that it was not so noisy or so sedentary and that it changed its residence more regularly at certain times of the year  They arrive in the beginning of the spring at the same time as the storksThey retire the first of all that I know about the beginning of July  c  GESNER  de Avibus  not to mention other differences  The Redlegged Crow has shrill though a pretty loud cry very like that of the Seapie It chatters almost incessantly and Olina remarks that it is bred not for its voice but for its beautiful plumage  The  cutta  with a red bill which on other parts is all black like the Crow except that its feet are yellow comes from the mountains In Latin it is named  Coracias  This bird does not talk but is kept merely on account of it beauty  Uccelleria  Belon however and the authors of the British Zoology say that it learns to speak  The female lays four or five white eggs spotted with dirty yellow She builds her nest on the tops of old deserted towers or on frightful  precipices for according to Edwards these birds prefer the cliffs all along the west coast of England to similar situations on the flat shores of the east and south I shall add another fact of the same kind which I owe to a very respectable observer  Hebert treasurer extraordinary of war at Dijon  It is that though these birds be inhabitants of the Alps of the mountains of Switzerland and of those of Auvergne c they are never found on the mountains of Bugey nor in all the chain that stretches along the confines of the country of Gex as far as Geneva Belon who saw them on Mount Jura in Switzerland again observed them in the islands of Crete and always on the summits of rocks But Hasselquist affirms that these birds arrive in Egypt and spread through the country after the inundation of the Nile has subsided and the waters are about to return into their bed If we admit this fact which however seems to be repugnant to the general nature of these birds we must suppose that they are drawn to Egypt by the abundance of food with which the lands are replete after being left by the waters to the powerful influence of a tropical sun and in fact they feed on insects and on seeds which have been lately committed to the soil and swell with milky juice the effect of incipient vegetation It follows then that these birds do not confine their residence exclusively to rocks and the summits of mountains since at  certain seasons they regularly appear in Lower Egypt Nor do they seem to be equally attached to every bleak eminence but to be directed in their choice by certain peculiar circumstances which have hitherto escaped observers  It is probable that the  coracias  of Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib ix  is the same with the Redlegged Crow and not the  pyrrhocorax  of Pliny  Lib x  which seems to differ in size and in the colour of its bill which is yellow But the bird of which we here treat has a red bill and red feet and as it was seen by Belon on the Cretan mountains it was more likely known to Aristotle than the  pyrrhocorax  which was supposed by the ancients to be confined to the Alps and in fact was not seen by Belon in Greece  I must admit however that Aristotle makes his  coracias  a species of daw  as we regard the  pyrrhocorax  of Pliny which would seem to favour the identity or at least the proximity of these two species But as in the same chapter I find a palmipede bird joined with the daws as of the same genus the philosopher evidently confounds birds that are of a very different nature or rather since the text traces a regular analogy the confusion must have arisen from some mistakes of the copyists Besides the word  pyrrhocorax  though entirely of Greek  derivation  It signifies  firecrow  occurs not in any part of Aristotle's treatise and Pliny who was well acquainted with that work could discover in it no account of the bird on which he bestows that name and in his description of the  pyrrhocorax  he does not copy what the Greek philosopher had said on the subject of the  coracias  The specimen examined by the authors of the British Zoology weighed thirteen ounces and its wings extended about two feet and a half the tongue was almost as long as the bill somewhat hooked the nails black strong and hooked  Gerini mentions a bird of this kind whose bill and feet were black and which he considers as a variety of the Redlegged Crow affected only by some accidental differences of colour arising from the distinction of the age or sex  Storia degli Uccelli  tom ii p    The specific character of the Chough  CorvusGraculus  Linn is that  it is blackish violet its bill and feet red  It resembles the jackdaw in habits and size being sixteen inches long it is voracious gregarious and circles as it flies Borlase says that it is not as mischievous as commonly represented the tricks of the jackdaw being often imputed to it by mistake  The HERMIT CROW  In Zurich it is called  Scheller    Waldtrapp    Steinrap  in Bavaria and Stiria  Claussrapp  in Italian  Corvo Spileto  in Polish  Kruklesny    Nocny    Le Coracias Huppé  ou  Le Sonneur  i e  The Crest Chough    or the Sounder  This name has been given by some persons to this bird because its voice resembles the tinkling of the bells fastened to the necks of cattle  Buff  CorvusEremita  Linn and Gmel  Coracia Cristata  Briss  Corvus Sylvaticus  Gesneri Will  Upupa Montana  Klein  Gesner's WoodCrow  Will  WoodCrow from Switzerland  Alb  THIS bird is of the size of a hen its plumage is black with fine green reflections which are variegated nearly as in the Redlegged Crow like it the bill and feet are red but the bill is still longer and more slender very proper for inserting into the fissures of rocks and the cracks in the ground into the holes of trees and walls in search of insects and worms which are its principal food In its stomach are found portions of the molecrickets It eats also the  larvoe  of the Maybug and is useful on account of the havock which it makes among these destructive insects  The feathers on the top of its head are longer than the rest and form a kind of crest which  hangs backwards but this only appears after they are full grown and again disappears when they are aged Hence the reason that in some places they are called  Bald Crows  and in some descriptions they are represented as having a yellow head marked with red spots These colours are probably the tints of the skin which age leaves bare  The crest which has given occasion to the name of  Mountaincrested  Klein  is not the only distinction between this bird and the Redlegged Crow its neck is longer and more slender its head smaller its tail shorter c Besides it is known only as a bird of passage while the Redlegged Crow as we have already seen is migratory but only in certain countries and in particular circumstances Gesner has therefore divided them properly into two species and I have distinguished them by different names  The Hermit Crows fly very lofty and generally go in flocks  I am aware that Klein makes the Hermit Crow a solitary bird but this is directly contrary to what Gesner asserts the only original observer whom Klein copies without being conscious when he transcribes from Albin  They seek their food often in the meadows and marshy places and always nestle on the tops of old deserted towers or in the clefts of frightful inaccessible rocks Sensible as it were that their young are delicate meat  and much valued by the luxurious they are careful to breed them out of the reach of man But there are still some men hardy enough to risk their lives for the most sordid gain and allow themselves to be let down by ropes from giddy heights to plunder the infant brood in their recesses and reap the most dangerous of harvests  The females lay generally two or three eggs every hatch and those who wish to get the brood commonly leave a young bird in each nest in order to invite them to return the following year When the young are plundered the parents cry  ka    ka    kae    kae  but are seldom heard at any other time The young are easily tamed and the more so if they be taken early and before they can fly  They arrive in the country of Zurich towards the beginning of April at the same time with the storks Their nests are sought for about Whitsunday and they depart the earliest of all the birds in the middle of June I know not why Barrere has made the Hermit Crow a species of curlew  The Hermit Crow inhabits the Alps the lofty mountains of Italy Stiria Switzerland Bavaria and the high cliffs which border on the Danube in the vicinity of Passau and Kelkeym These birds choose for their retreat certain natural breastworks or cells of a good aspect among  the rocks and hence the name  Klaussrappen  or  MonkRaven  Specific character  Greenish head yellowish back of the head somewhat crested the bill and feet red  N  o  THE RAVEN  The RAVEN  Le Corbeau  Buff  CorvusCorax  Linn and Gmel  Corvus  Briss Klein and Will  In Greek  in Latin  Corvus  in Spanish  Cuervo  in Italian  Corvo  in German  Rabe    Rave    Kolrave    coalraven  in Swedish  Korp  in Polish  Kruk  in Hebrew  Oreb  in Arabic  Gerabib  in Persian  Calak  in old French  Corbin  The appellations bestowed in all languages are evidently formed from the Raven's croak The Scotch name  Corbey  like many others of that dialect was introduced from the French The English word  Raven  is derived from the German  Rabe  M Montbeillard author of this article objects to the indiscriminating application of the name  Corvus  to the crows daws choughs c The  corvus  of the ancients was appropriated to the large species the Raven differing from the rest considerably in its habits and instincts It is as large as a good cock and would weigh three carrion crows and two rooks  The Corbey  Sibb  Scotia Illustrata  THIS bird has always been famous but its bad reputation has been owing most probably to its being confounded with other birds and loaded with their ill qualities It has ever been regarded as the lowest of the rapacious tribe the most cowardly and the most disgusting Filth and rotten carcases it is said are its chief food and when it gluts its appetite on live prey its victims are the weak or useful animals lambs leverets  Aldrovandus relates a story of two Ravens concerting an attack upon a hare they picked out its eyes and devoured it  c yet it sometimes attacks the large  animals with success supplying its want of strength and agility by cunning it plucks out the eyes of buffaloes  Aelian  Natur Anim  lib ii  Recueil des Voyages qui ont servi à l'Etablissement de la Compagnie des Indes  tom viii p  This is perhaps the source of the antipathy which is said to subsist between the Ox and Raven  See  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib ix  I can hardly believe that a Raven attacks a buffaloe as travellers relate It may happen that these birds will sometimes alight upon the backs of the buffaloes as the hooded crow alights upon the backs of asses and sheep or the magpie upon the backs of hogs to eat the insects which lodge in the hair of these animals It may happen too that the Ravens by excessive strokes with their bill may tear the buffaloes' hides or even attracted by the glistening of the pupil they may pick out the eyes but I cannot persuade myself that they deliberately determine to eat the buffaloes alive and are able to accomplish that undertaking  and then fixing on the back it tears off the flesh deliberately and what renders the ferocity more detestable it is not incited by the cravings of hunger but by the appetite for carnage for it can subsist on fruits seeds of all kinds and indeed may be considered as on omnivorous animal  See  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib viii  and  Willoughby p  I have seen them fed in a great measure with flesh either raw or cooked    This violence and indiscriminating voracity of the Raven has procured it a various treatment sometimes it has been proscribed as a pernicious destructive animal sometimes it has been afforded the protection of law as useful in extirpating noxious insects In poor thinly inhabited states the Raven may prove a burthensome and expensive guest but in  rich populous countries it will be serviceable by devouring the filth generated in them For this reason it was formerly according to Belon forbidden in England  Belon wrote in  This bird is esteemed sacred by our people and few persons will dare to kill it  Fauna Suecica  N  o    The Ravens enjoy the same protection at Surinam according to Dr Fermin  Description de Surinam  tom ii p  to hurt this bird but in the narrow islands of Ferroe Malta c a premium was offered for its destruction  Acts of Copenhagen  for the years and With regard to the island of Malta I have been assured that the birds are carrion crows but at the same time as I am told they inhabit the most desert rocks on the coast I am disposed to believe that they are Ravens    If to the features which we have now traced of the Raven we join its gloomy plumage its cry still more gloomy though very feeble its ignoble port in proportion to its bulk its savage look its body smelling perpetually of infection  The authors of the British Zoology alone assert that the Raven has an agreeable smell which is difficult to believe of a bird that feeds on carrion We know also by experience that Ravens just killed give the fingers a smell as disagreeable as that of fish This I have been assured by Hebert a very respectable observer and the fact is confirmed by the testimony of Hernandez p It is indeed said of the  Carancro  a sort of vulture in America which has also been termed a Raven that it exhales an odour of musk though it lives upon filth  Dupratz  Hist de la Louisiane  tom ii  But most authors assert directly the contrary  we shall not be surprised that in all ages it has been regarded as an object of aversion and horror Its flesh was forbidden  to the Jews savages never eat it  Voyage du Pere Theodat p  and among ourselves the most starved wretches discover an extreme dislike to it and remove the coriaceous skin before they make their disgusting meal In every country it is reckoned an ominous bird which announces impending calamities Grave historians  Aeneas Sylvius  Hist Europ  cap  Bembo  Init  lib vGesner  de Avibus  p  have described pitched battles between armies of crows and those of other ravenous birds and have regarded these combats as foreboding the bloody wars kindled among nations And how many persons at present are alarmed and dejected at the noise of its croaking The whole of its knowledge of futurity is limited however like that of the other inhabitants of the air to a greater sensibility to the changes in its element and to the expression of its feelings by certain cries and actions In the southern provinces of Sweden Linnaeus tells us that the Ravens in fine weather soar to an immense height and make a clangorous noise that is heard at a great distance  Fauna Suecica  No  The authors of the British Zoology add that in this case they fly generally in pairs Other writers  Pliny Belon Gesner Aldrovandus c  in less enlightened times have given other remarks mingled with fable and superstition  In those times when augury formed a part of religion the Ravens though bad prophets could not fail to be birds of vast importance The fondness of prying into futurity how dismal soever may be the prospect is an ancient malady of the human race All the various motions of the Raven were studied with the most scrupulous attention all the circumstances of its flight all the differences of its voice of which not to mention the minute discriminations too difficult to be appretiated  Aldrovandus  no less than sixtyfour distinct inflexions were reckoned up Each had its determined signification the artful applied themselves to the profession and credulity drew multitudes to their oracles  Pliny  lib  xxix  cap    Pliny himself though superior to the prejudices of the vulgar was so far carried by the tide of popular opinion as to mention its most infaustous cries  Id lib  x  The worst omen is when they cluck with a strangled voice  Some even carried this folly to such lengths as to eat the heart and entrails of these birds from the hope of acquiring the spirit of prophecy  Porphyr  De abstinendo ab Animant  lib ii    But the Raven has not only a great number of inflections of voice corresponding to its interior affections it has also the talent of imitating the cry of other animals  Aldrovandus  and even human discourse  and to improve this natural quality the ligament of the tongue has been cut  Colas  is the word which it pronounces the most easily  Belon  and Scaliger heard one which when hungry called distinctly on the cook by the name of  Conrad  Exercit in Cardanum  Scaliger adds as a pleasant anecdote that this same Raven having found a paper with written music pricked with its bill as if it were reading and beating time It seems more natural to suppose that the bird mistook the notes for insects on which it sometimes feeds  These words bear indeed some resemblance to the ordinary cry of the Raven  These speaking birds were highly prized at Rome and a philosopher has not disdained to relate the history of one of them  Being early accustomed to speak it flew every morning to the  rostra  and saluted Tiberius then the two Caesars Germanicus and Drusus and afterwards the Roman people as they passed by  c  Pliny  lib x  They not only learn to prattle or repeat words but become quite familiar They can be tamed though old  Gesner p  and appear even susceptible of a lasting and personal attachment  Witness the tame Raven mentioned by Schwenckfeld which having suffered itself to be carried too far by its wild companions and not being able to regain its way discovered afterwards on the high road the man who had been used to feed it hovered some time croaking above his head as if to pay him homage then alighted upon his hand and never more left him  Aviarium Silesiae  p    In consequence of their pliancy of temper they can be instructed not indeed to divest themselves  of their voracity but to moderate it and direct it to the service of man Pliny speaks of Craterus an Asiatic who was noted for his skill in breeding Ravens to hunt and who could make himself be followed even by the wild Ravens  Lib x  Scaliger relates that king Louis probably Louis XII had one so trained and used it in the chace of partridges  In Cardanum exercit  Albertus saw one at Naples which caught partridges and pheasants and even other Ravens but to hunt birds of its own species it required to be roused and as it were forced by the presence of the falconer  Aldrovandus p  Also  Dampier vol ii  Lastly It can sometimes be taught it would seem to protect its master and assist him against his enemies by its manoeuvres at least if we give credit to the story which Aulus Gellius tells of the Crow of Valerius  A Gaul of high stature having challenged the bravest Roman to single combat a Tribune named Valerius stepped forth and proved victorius by the assistance of a Raven which perpetually harassed his antagonist tearing his hands with its bill and darting at this face and eyes Valerius afterwards bore the name of the  Raven Corvus  Noct Atticae  lib ix  This story is also related by  Livy lib vii  The Gauls were so much intimidated by the fall of their champion that the Romans gained a complete victory The Raven is said to have perched on the head of Valerius and was regarded as a token of victory sent down from heaven so that it must have been a wild Raven But the story is evidently fabulous T    The Raven has also great sagacity at scenting out  The Ravens are the only birds employed in the auspices that seem conscious of their own faculties for when the guests of Media were slain they all flew out of Peloponnesus and the region of Attica  PLINY lib x from ARISTOTLE lib ix  The same quality is also noticed in the  Fauna Suecica No  carrion from a distance Thucydides ascribes to it the instinct of abstaining from the carcasses of animals that have died of the plague  Lib ii  It has been said also that a bird of this kind wanting to drink out of a vessel which was too narrow to admit it had the shrewdness to drop into it small stones which by degrees raised the water to the top  Pliny lib x  This thirst if the fact be true  It is also remarked by Gesner  is a circumstance which distinguishes the Raven from all the rest of the birds of prey especially from those which feed on live game which are stimulated by hunger and never desire but to drink blood Another difference is that the Ravens are more social than the other rapacious birds but it is easy to account for this since as they eat every sort of food and have more resources than the rest of the carnivorous kind they can subsist in greater numbers on the same extent and have not therefore the same causes of separation We may here observe that though tame Ravens feed on all sorts of flesh and those in the state of liberty be generally supposed to commit great havock among the moles and fieldmice  It is said that in the Isle of France a certain species of Raven is religiously kept with a view to destroy the rats and mice  Voyage d'un Officiér du Roi    p    It is said that the islands of Bermudas having been ravaged five years in succession by a prodigious multitude of rats which devoured the plants and trees and crossed by swimming from one island to another these rats suddenly disappeared and no cause could be assigned except that a great number of Ravens had in the latter years resorted to the islands which were never seen there either before or since But we have no proof that Ravens prey much upon rats the inhabitants of the Isle of France may like others entertain a prejudice and with respect to the rats of the Bermuda islands they may have been starved to death they may have devoured one another as often happens or they may have been drowned in their passage between the islands    Hebert who has noticed them attentively for a long course of years never saw them tear or mangle dead carcasses or even settle upon them he is therefore of opinion that they prefer insects and especially earthworms to every other sort of food He adds that earth is found in their excrements  The Ravens the real mountain Ravens are not birds of passage and in this respect they differ more or less from the Crows with which they associate They seem particularly attached to the rock where they were bred or rather where they have paired it is their ordinary residence which they never entirely abandon If they descend into the plains it is to procure their subsistence and this more rarely happens in summer than in winter because they avoid the heat which appears to be the only influence that difference of seasons produces on them They do not pass  the night in the woods like the Carrion Crows they choose in their mountains a retreat sheltered from the northern blast under the natural alcoves secured by the recesses and projections of the rocks Thither they retire during the night to the number of fifteen or twenty They sleep perched on the bushes that grow between the rocks and build their nests in the crevices or in the holes of walls on the tops of old deserted towers and sometimes on the high branches of large straggling trees  Linnaeus says that in Sweden the Raven nestles chiefly upon the pines  Fauna Suecica  No  And Frisch asserts that in Germany they pitch mostly upon great oaks that is they prefer the loftiest trees whether pines or oaks  Each male attaches itself to a female with which it remains united for the course of many years  They are said to maintain their conjugal engagements sometimes forty years    ALDROVANDUS  Athenaeus goes still farther  for these birds which we view with disgust can yet inspire mutual and constant love and like the turtle express the gradual swell of passion The male if we believe some authors begins always with a sort of lovesong  Oppian  de Aucupio  then caresses and bills with his mate and it has even been alleged that they copulate by the bill  Aristotle ascribes this absurdity to Anaxagoras and is even at pains to refute it seriously for the female Ravens he says have a  vulva  and  ovaria  and that if the male semen entered by the mouth it would be digested and produce nothing  De Generatione  lib iii  The fact is that  we see their courtships frequently in the daytime but the consummation is performed in the silence and obscurity of the most secret recess  Albertus says that he once witnessed the copulation of Ravens and that it was performed as usual with other birds See  Gesner p  and hence probably the origin of the fable Nor must we ascribe this to any motives of decency wild animals are conscious of the danger of their situation and are anxious to provide for their security The  WhiteJohn  we have already seen conceals itself while it drinks because its head being plunged up to the eyes in the water it is in danger of being surprized The Raven has the more need of caution since he is languid in the act of coition which probably lasts a considerable time he therefore seeks a secret retreat where in undisturbed security he may indulge his passion  The genus of the Ravens is not libidinous because it is not very prolific  ARISTOTLE  de Generatione  lib iii    The female is distinguished from the male according to Barrere by its plumage being of a lighter black and her bill weaker and my own observations seem to confirm this remark She lays about the month of March  Willoughby says that the Ravens sometimes lay earlier in England  five or six eggs

which time the male provides her with food and the supply is large for the peasants sometimes find in the Ravens' nests or near them considerable heaps of grain nuts and fruits It has been suspected indeed that this hoarding is intended not only for the females during incubation but for the subsistence of both through the winter  Aldrovandus  But whatever be their motives certain it is that the Ravens steal not only provisions but whatever tickles their fancy particularly bits of metal and glittering substances  Frisch  There was one at Erford which had the assiduity to carry one by one and conceal beneath a stone in a garden a quantity of small pieces amounting to five or six florins  Gesner  de Avibus  p  Every country furnishes stories of such domestic thefts  When the young are hatched they are far from being of the colour of their parents they are rather white than black contrary to the swans which are originally brown though destined to wear a snowy plumage  Aldrovandus  At first the mother seems to treat her offspring with indifference nor does she feed them till they begin to be feathered it has been alleged that she alters her conduct the moment she is convinced  by their plumage that they are not spurious  Aldrovandus  But for my part I can see nothing in this that has not place in other animals and even in man some days after birth a certain time is necessary to reconcile them to a new element and a new existence Nor is the young Raven then totally destitute of food for a part of the yolk is included in the  abdomen  and flows insensibly into the intestines by a particular duct  Willoughby  After a few days the mother feeds the young with the proper aliments which previously undergo a preparation in her crop and are then disgorged into their bills nearly as in the pigeons  Idem    But the male not only provides for the family but watches for its safety If he perceive a kite or other such rapacious bird approach the nest the danger animates his courage he takes wing gains above his foe and dashing downwards he strikes violently with his bill both contend for the ascendency and sometimes they mount entirely out of sight till overcome with fatigue one or both fall to the ground  Frisch    Aristotle and many others after him pretend that when the young are able to fly the parents drive them out of the nest and if the tract where they are settled affords too scanty a subsistence they entirely expel them from  their precincts  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib ix  If this fact were true it would shew that they are really birds of prey but it does not agree with the observations which Hebert has made on the Ravens which inhabit the mountains of Bugey for they protract the education of their brood beyond the period when these are able to provide for themselves As it seldom happens that opportunity and talents concur in making such observations I shall relate them in his own words  The young Ravens are hatched very early in the season and against the month of May are able to quit their nest A family of them was every year bred opposite to my windows upon the rocks which terminate the prospect The young to the number of four or five sat on the large detached fragments about the middle of the precipice where they were easily seen and drew notice by their continual wailing Every time that the parents brought them food which happened frequently during the course of the day they called with a cry  crau    crau    crau  very different from their other noise Sometimes one tried to fly and after a slight essay it returned to settle upon the rock Almost always some one was left behind and its wailing then became incessant After the young had strength sufficient to fly that is fifteen days at least  after their leaving the nest the parents conducted them every morning to the field and in the evening led them back It was commonly five or six in the afternoon when the family returned and they spent the rest of the day in noisy brawling This practice lasted the whole summer which would give reason to suppose that the Ravens have not two hatches annually  Gesner fed young Ravens with raw flesh small fishes and bread soaked in water They are very fond of cherries and swallow them greedily with the stones and stalks they digest however only the pulpy part and in two hours afterwards vomit up the rest It is also said that they disgorge the bones of those animals which they eat entire like the kestril the nocturnal birds of prey the fishing birds c  Aldrovandus  Pliny says  Lib xxix  that the Raven is subject every summer to a periodical distemper which lasts sixty days whose principal symptom is excessive thirst but I suspect that this is nothing but moulting which is more tedious in this bird than in many others of the rapacious tribe  Gesner    No person as far as I know has determined the age at which the young Ravens have acquired their full growth and are able to propagate If in the birds as in the quadrupeds each period of life was proportional to the total  space of existence we might suppose that the Crows required many years to reach their adult state for though the venerable age ascribed by Hesiod  Hesiod assigns nine of our ages to the Crow the quadruple to the stags and this tripled to the Ravens  PLINY lib vii  If we estimate a generation at thirty years the age of the Crow would be years that of the stag years and that of the Raven years The only way to give a reasonable sense to the passage is to understand the  aetas  of Pliny and the  of Hesiod to mean a year and on this supposition the life of the Crow would be reckoned at nine years that of the stag thirtysix and that of the Raven as proved by observation"  must be considerably curtailed it seems well ascertained that this bird sometimes lives a century or more In many cities of France they have been known to attain to that distant period and in all countries and all ages they have been reckoned as birds extremely longlived But the progress to maturity must be slow in this species compared to the duration of their life for towards the end of the first summer when all the family consort together it is difficult to distinguish the old from the young and very probably they are capable of breeding the second year  We have already remarked that the Crow is not black at first In the decline of life also its plumage loses the deep colour and in extreme age changes into yellow  Aristotle  de Coloribus  But at no time is this bird of a pure black without the intermixture of other shades Nature knows no absolute  uniformity The black which predominates is mingled with violet on the upper part of the body with cinereous on the throat and with green under the body and on the quills of the tail and the largest feathers of the wings and the remotest of the back  Brisson  Only the feet the nails and the bill are quite black and this colour of the bill seems to penetrate to the tongue as that of the feathers appears to tincture the flesh The tongue is cylindrical at its base flattened and forked near the tip and roughened with small points on the edges The organ of hearing is very complicated and more so perhaps than in the other birds  Acts of Copenhagen  ann    It must also be more sensible if we credit Plutarch who says that he has seen Crows fall down stunned with the noisy acclamations of a numerous multitude agitated by violent emotions  Life of T Q Flaminius    The oesophagus dilates at its junction with the ventricle and forms a kind of craw which was not overlooked by Aristotle The inner surface of the ventricle is furrowed with wrinkles the gallbladder is very large and adheres to the intestines  Willoughby  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib ii  Redi found worms in the cavity of the  abdomen  Collect Acad Etrang  tom iv p  the length of the gut is nearly twice that of the bird itself measuring  from the tip of the bill to the extremities of the nails that is a medium between the extent of the intestines of the true carnivorous birds and the true granivorous in a word it is exactly suited for an animal which lives partly on flesh and partly on fruits  A respectable observer assured me that he saw a Raven drop a nut more than twenty times from the height of twentyfour or thirty yards and each time picked it up but it could not succeed in breaking it all this being done in a ploughed field    The appetite of the Raven which is thus reconciled to every sort of aliment proves often its destruction from the ease with which birdcatchers can provide a bait The powder of the  nux vomica  which is mortal to so many quadrupeds is also a poison to the Raven it is benumbed and drops soon after eating the dose but the moment of intoxication must be seized for the torpor is often only transient and the bird recovers strength sufficient to reach its native rock there to languish or expire  Gesner p  Journal Economique  Dec  It is also caught by various sorts of nets snares and gins and even by the birdcall like the little warblers for it also entertains an antipathy to owls and cannot see them without venting a cry  Traite de la Pipee  It is

carnivorous birds which are enemies or rivals of each other  When the Ravens alight upon the ground they walk but do not hop Like the birds of prey they have long vigorous wings extending nearly three feet and a half these consist of twenty quills of which the two or three first  Brisson and Linnaeus say two Willoughby three  are shorter than the fourth which is the longest of all and the middle ones have a remarkable property viz that the ends of their shafts stretch beyond the vanes and terminate in points The tail contains twelve quills which are about eight inches long but somewhat unequal the two middle ones being the longest then those next so that the end of the tail appears somewhat rounded on its horizontal plane  Add to this that the Ravens have on almost their whole body a double sort of feathers so closely adhering to the skin that they cannot be plucked without the help of hot water  This I shall afterwards call the  tapered tail  Queue etagee  i e like the steps of a staircase    From the extent of its wings we may infer the elevation of its flight In storms and tempests the Raven it is said has been seen gliding through the air conveying fire at its bill  Scala Naturalis apud Aldrovandum tom i p  This is only the luminous star formed at the point of its bill in its passage through the elevated regions of the atmosphere then surcharged  with electricity From some appearance of this kind probably the Eagle has been termed the minister of thunder for there are few fables but are founded upon truth  Since the Raven has a lofty flight and is capable of enduring every temperature the wide world is opened for its reception  Aldrov  Ornith  In fact it is scattered from the polar circle  Klein  to the Cape of Good Hope  Kolben  and the island of Madagascar  Flaccourt  and its number is determined by the quantity of food which the various intermediate regions supply and the convenience of the situations which they afford  Pliny says from Theophrastus that Ravens were strangers in Asia  Lib x  It sometimes migrates from the coasts of Barbary to the island of Teneriffe It is found in Mexico St Domingo and Canada  Charlevoix  and undoubtedly in the other parts of the New Continent and of the adjacent islands When it is once settled in a country and has become accustomed to its situation it seldom quits it to roam into another  Frisch  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib ix  It grows even attached to the nest which it has built and uses it for several years together  Its plumage is not the same in all countries Beside the changes which age introduces the  colour is also subject to vary from the influence of climate It is sometimes entirely white in Norway and Iceland where numbers are also quite black  HorrebowKlein John of Cay saw in at Lubec two white Ravens bred for the chace  Id  p  On the other hand white Ravens are found in the heart of France and Germany  Ephemerides d'Allemagne  Dr Wisel adds that in the year following black Ravens were found in the same nests and that in another nest in the same wood a black Raven and two white ones were found Of the latter colour they are sometimes killed in Italy  See  GERINI  Storia degli Uccelli  tom ii p  in nests where some are likewise black The Mexican Raven called  Cacalotl  by Fernandez  Hist Avium Novae Hispaniae  cap clxxiv p  This is the  Corvus Varius  of Brisson and the  Red Raven  of Latham Gmelin also reckons it a variety  is variegated with two colours That of the Bay of Saldagne has a white collar  Downton's Voyage  that of Madagascar named  Coach  according to Flaccourt is white under the belly The same mixture of black and white occurs in some individuals of the European sort even in what Brisson terms the  White Raven of the North  This is the  White Raven  of Latham which Gmelin makes a second variety  which ought rather to have been called the  Black and White Raven  since the upper part of its body is black and the under white its head white and black and also its bill its feet its tail and its wings these have twentyone quills and the tail has twelve and what is remarkable the  quills at an equal distance on either side which are commonly alike are in this subject marked with black and white differently distributed This circumstance would induce me to suppose that this is only an accidental change produced on the natural colour which is black by the excessive rigour of the climate and if this conjecture be well founded it would follow that this is improperly reckoned a permanent species especially as all other animals that inhabit the arctic regions are clothed with a thicker fur than those of the same kind which live in milder climates  These variations in the plumage of a bird so generally and so deeply impressed with black as the Raven is another proof that colour can afford no permanent or essential character  There is another kind of Raven which forms a variety in point of size Those of Mount Jura for instance appeared to Hebert who had an opportunity of comparing them to be larger than those which inhabit the mountains of Bugey and Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib viii  informs us that the Ravens and Hawks were smaller in Egypt than in Greece  The specific character of the Raven  CorvusCorax  LINN is  That it is black its back of a black skycolour its tail somewhat rounded  To the very ample detail given in the text we can add but few circumstances The Raven weighs three pounds and is twentysix inches long In the northern countries of Finmark Iceland and Greenland it frequents the huts of the natives feeds upon the offals of seals and also devours birds eggs It whirls dextrously in the air and changes its prey from bill to feet for relief It replies to the echo of its croak The male sits by day and the female by night On the approach of storms it gathers under the shelter of crags The Greenlanders eat its flesh clothe themselves with its skin make brushes of its wings and split the quills for fishinglines When a physician among the American savages visits a patient he invokes the Raven as the sign of returning health the Esquimaux however detest and dread the whole genus  FOREIGN BIRDS RELATED TO THE RAVEN  The INDIAN RAVEN of BONTIUS  BucerosHydrocorax  Linn and Gmel  Corvus Indicus Bontii  Ray and Will  Corvus Torquatus  Klein  The Indian Hornbill  Lath  THIS bird is found in the Molucca islands and chiefly at Banda Our knowledge of it is drawn from an imperfect description and a wretched figure so that we can only conjecture the European species to which it belongs Bontius the first and I believe the only one who has seen it reckons it a Raven in which he is followed by Ray Willoughby and some others but Brisson conceives it to be a Calao I would rather adhere to the former opinion and my reasons are briefly these  This bird according to Bontius resembles the Raven in the shape of its bill and in its part though its neck is rather longer and a slight protuberance appears in the figure rising on the bill  This is a certain proof that he knew no other bird to which he could so readily compare it and yet he was acquainted with the Calao of  India He tells us indeed that it feeds upon nutmegs and Willoughby considers this feature as different from the character of the Common Ravens but we have already seen that these eat wild nuts and are not so much carnivorous as generally supposed  On the other hand neither the description of Bontius nor his figure discovers the least trace of the indenting of the bill which Brisson regards as one of the characters of the Calaos and the little bump which appears on the bill bears no resemblance to the protuberance which distinguishes the Calao Lastly the Calao has neither the speckled temples nor the black tail quills which are mentioned in the description of Bontius and its bill is so singularly shaped that an observer could not I should suppose have seen it and not remarked its form much less have taken it for the bill of a Common Raven  The flesh of the Indian Raven of Bontius has a pleasant aromatic flavour derived from the nutmegs which constitute its principal food and it is extremely probable that if our Raven had the same sort of aliments it would lose its rank smell  Linnaean character of Bontius' Indian Raven  Its front bony plain and bare before its belly yellow  It is often tamed and employed to catch rats and mice it is thirty inches long    It would require to have seen the Raven of the Desert  graab el zahara  which Dr Shaw  mentions  Shaw gives it also the names  Crow of the desert    Redlegged Crow  or  Pyrrhocorax  to be able to refer it with certainty to its analogous European species All that the Doctor says is that it is rather larger than our Raven and that its bill and feet are red This last character has determined Dr Shaw to reckon it a large Chough that bird as we have already seen is indeed known in Africa but how can we conceive a Chough to be greater than a Raven I mention this to draw the attention of some intelligent traveller  I find in Koempfer two other birds mentioned by the name of Ravens without a single character to justify that appellation The one is according to him of a middle size but extremely audacious it was brought from China to Japan as a present to the emperor The other which was also given to the emperor of Japan was a bird from Corea exceedingly rare and called  Coreigaras  that is the Raven of Corea Koempfer adds that the Ravens which are common in Europe are not found in Japan no more than the parrots and some other birds of India    Note  We should here place the Armenian bird which Tournefort calls the  King of the Ravens  if it were really a Raven or belonged to that family But a glance of the miniature figure will convince us that it is more related to the peacocks and pheasants by its beautiful crest  its rich plumage its short wing and the shape of its bill though it is somewhat longer and though other slight differences occur in the form of its tail and of its feet It is properly termed on the figure  Avis Persica pavoni congener  Persian bird akin to the peacock I should therefore have mentioned it among the foreign birds analogous to the peacocks and pheasants if I had been earlier acquainted with it  The CARRION CROW  In Greek  which name was also applied to

they occasionally emerge to procure subsistence for themselves and their infant brood Their chief food in the spring is partridges eggs of which they are very fond and are so dexterous as to pierce them and carry them on the point of the bill to their young The consumption is prodigious and though they are not the most sanguinary of the rapacious tribe we may reckon them the most destructive Fortunately they are not numerous we should hardly find two dozen of pairs in a forest of five or six miles compass in the environs of Paris  During winter they live with the Rooks and Hooded Crows and nearly in the same way In this season numerous flights of all sorts of  N  o  THE CROW  Crows assemble about our dwellings keeping constantly on the ground sauntering among our flocks and shepherds hovering near the tracks of our labourers and sometimes hopping upon the backs of hogs and sheep with such familiarity that they might be taken for tame domestic birds At night they retire into the forests to lodge on the large trees which they seem to choose as the general rendezvous whither they resort from every quarter sometimes from the distance of three miles all round and whence they again sally out in the morning in quest of subsistence  But this mode of life which is common to the three species of Crows is not equally suited to them all for the Hooded Crows and the Carrion Crows become excessively fat while the Rooks continue always lean But this is not the only difference that subsists towards the end of winter which is the season of their amours the Rooks remove into other climates while the Carrion Crows which disappear at the same time in the plains make only a partial flitting and retire into the next large forests where they dissolve the general society to form new connexions more endearing and more intimate They form into pairs and seem to divide their territory into districts of about a quarter of a league in diameter each of which maintains its separate family  This has perhaps given occasion to say that Ravens expel their young from their district as soon as these are able to fly  It is said that  this connexion subsists inviolate during the rest of their life and it is even alleged that if one of the couple happen to die the survivor will never enter into another union  The female is distinguished by her plumage which is of inferior lustre She lays five or six eggs and sits about three weeks during which time the male supplies her with food  I had an opportunity of examining a nest of a Crow which was brought to me in the beginning of July It was found in an oak eight feet high in a wood planted on a little hill where were other oaks larger The nest weighed two or three pounds it was formed on the outside with small branches and thorns rudely interwoven and plaistered with earth and horsedung the inside was softer and lined carefully with fibrous roots I found in it six young already hatched all alive though they had eaten nothing for twentyfour hours their eyes were not open  See  Aristotle  de Generatione  lib iv  and no plumage was to be seen on them except the point of the wing quills their flesh was a mixture of yellow and black the tip of the bill and their nails yellow the edges of the mouth a dirty white and the rest of the bill and feet reddish  When a buzzard or kestril approaches the nest the parents unite to attack them and dart with such fury that they often kill them splitting the skull with their bills They also fight with the  shrikes but these though smaller are so bold as often to prove victorious drive them from the nest and plunder the young  The ancients assert that the Crows as well as the Ravens are watchful of their young after the period of their flight  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib vi  This seems to be probable and I should suppose that they do not separate from their parents the first year for these birds readily associate with strangers and is it not natural to suppose that the society which is formed in the same family will continue to subsist till interrupted by the breeding season  Like the Raven the Crow can be taught to prattle it is also omnivorous

bladder large and communicating with the intestinal tube by a double duct  Willoughby  Lastly the bottom of the feathers that is the part which is concealed is of a deep ashcolour  As this bird is exceedingly cunning has an acute scent and flies commonly in large flocks it is difficult to come near it and hardly possible to decoy it into snares Some however are caught by imitating the screech of the owl and placing lime twigs on the high branches or it is drawn within gunshot by means of an eagle owl or such other nocturnal bird raised on perches in an open spot They are destroyed by throwing to them garden beans of which they are very fond and in which rusty needles have been concealed but the most singular mode of catching them illustrates the nature of the bird which I shall for that reason relate  A Carrion Crow is fastened alive on its back firmly to the ground by means of a brace on each side at the origin of the wings In this painful posture the animal struggles and screams the rest of its species flock to its cries from all quarters with the intention as it were to afford relief But the prisoner grasping at every thing within reach to extricate himself from his situation seizes with his bill and claws which are left at liberty all that come near him and thus delivers them a prey to the birdcatcher  Gesner  They are also caught with cones of paper baited with raw flesh as the Crow introduces his head to devour the bait which is near the bottom the paper being besmeared with birdlime sticks to the feathers of the neck and he remains hooded unable to get rid of this bandage which covers his eyes entirely he betakes to flight rises almost perpendicularly into the air the better to avoid striking against any thing till quite exhausted he sinks down always near the spot from which he mounted In general though the flight of the Carrion Crows be neither easy nor rapid they mount to a very great height where they support themselves long and whirl much  This species has like the Raven varieties of white  Schwenckfeld and SalerneBrisson adds that they have also the bill the feet and the nails white  and of white mixed with black  Frisch  but which have the same instincts  Frisch says that he once saw a flock of swallows travelling with a troop of variegated Crows in the same direction He adds that these pass the summer on the coasts of the ocean subsisting on what the waves cast ashore that in autumn they migrate to the south never in large bodies but in small divisions at certain intervals from each other in which circumstance they resemble the Black Common Crows of which they seem to be only a permanent variety  It is very probable that the Crows of the Maldivas mentioned by Francis Pyrard are of the same kind since that traveller who saw them very distinctly remarks no difference They seem however to be more familiar and bolder than ours for they entered houses to pick up whatever suited them and often the presence of a man did not discompose them Another traveller says that these Indian Crows when they can get into a chamber delight in doing all the mischievous tricks that are ascribed to monkeys derange the furniture and tear it with their bills overturn lamps inkstands c  Voyage d'Orient  du Pere Philippe de la Trinite p  Lastly according to Dampier there are in New Holland and New Guinea  According to this navigator the New Guinea Crows differ from ours only by the colour of their feathers of which all that appears is black but the ground white  many Carrion Crows which resemble ours There are also

another traveller they are very common in Louisiana  Specific character of the Carrion Crow  Corvus Corone  LINN  All of a skyblack its tail rounded its tailquills sharp  Its length is eighteen inches

Nigra Frugilega  Ray Will and Frisch  THIS bird is of an intermediate size between the Raven and the Carrion Crow and it has a deeper cry than them What distinguishes it the most is a naked white skin scaly and sometimes scabby that encircles the base of the bill instead of those black projecting feathers which in the other species of Crows extend as far as the aperture of the nostrils Its belly is not so thick or strong and seems as it were rasped These differences apparently so superficial imply more radical distinctions  The peculiarities of the Rook result from its mode of life It feeds upon grain roots and worms and as in search of its proper subsistence it scratches deep in the ground with its bill which in time becomes rough the feathers at the base are worn off by the continual rubbing  Daubenton the younger keeper and demonstrator of the cabinet of natural history made an observation lately in a jaunt to the country which relates to the present subject This naturalist to whom ornithology already owes so much saw at a distance in a field entirely uncultivated six Crows of which he could not distinguish the species which seemed very busy lifting and turning over the stones that were scattered here and there to get the worms and insects lodged under them They went so briskly to work that they made the smaller stones spring two or three feet If this singular exercise which no person before has attributed to the Crows be familiar to the Rooks it will afford another reason for the wearing and dropping of the feathers that encircle the base of their bill In that case the name  turnstone  now applied to a single species of bird might become generic    However the straggling feathers are perceived there a sufficient proof that the bird is not naturally bald  The appetite of the Rook is confined to grain worms and insects it never prowls in the kennel nor eats any sort of flesh it has also the muscular ventricle and the broad intestines of the granivorous tribe  These birds fly in numerous flocks which are sometimes so immense as to darken the air We may conceive what havock these hordes of reapers will commit on newlysown fields or on crops nearly ripe Accordingly in some countries government has interfered  Aldrovandus  The British Zoology vindicates them from the aspersion asserting that they do more good than harm by destroying the caterpillars that gnaw the roots of the useful plants and blast the honest  labours of the husbandman It would require a calculation to decide the point  But not only the Rooks fly in flocks they also nestle in company as it were with those of their own species and their society is very clamorous especially when they have young Ten or twelve nests are sometimes found on the same tree and a great number of trees thus furnished occur in the same forest or rather in the same district  Frisch  They seek not retirement and solitude but rather prefer settling near our dwellings Schwenckfeld observes that they commonly prefer the large trees planted round cemeteries because perhaps these are frequented spots or afford worms in greater plenty for we cannot suppose that they are attracted by the scent of the dead bodies since we have already said that they will not touch flesh Frisch asserts that if in the breeding season a person goes under the tree on which they are thus settled he will instantly be deluged with their excrements  One circumstance will appear singular though very like to what happens every day among animals of a different species When a pair are employed in constructing their nest one must be left to guard it while the other is procuring the suitable materials without this precaution it is alleged the nest would in an instant be completely pillaged by the other Rooks which  are settled on the same tree each carrying off a sprig to its own dwelling  These birds begin to build their nest in the month of March at least in England  British Zoology  They lay four or five eggs smaller than those of the Raven but marked with broader spots especially at the large end It is said that the male and female sit by turns When the young are hatched and able to eat they disgorge their food which they keep in reserve in their craw or rather in a sort of bag formed by the dilatation of the oesophagus  Willoughby    I find in the British Zoology that after their hatch is over they leave the trees where they nestled and that they return not again till the month of August and only begin to repair or rebuild their nests in October  It is said that the herons take advantage of their absence to lay and hatch in their nests  ALDROVANDUS  This would shew that they continue almost the whole year in England but in France in Silesia and in many other countries they are undoubtedly birds of passage if we except a few the only difference is that in France they announce the winter while in Silesia they are the forerunners of the summer  See  Schwenckfeld p  At BaumelaRoche which is a village of Burgundy a few leagues from Dijon surrounded with mountains and craggy rocks and where the air is sensibly colder than at Dijon I saw repeatedly in summer a flock of Rooks which had lodged and nestled above a century I am assured in the holes of rocks facing the south west and where it would be very difficult to get at their nests and not without being let down by cords These Rooks were so familiar that they ventured to steal the reapers' luncheons they disappeared about the end of summer a couple of months only after which they returned to their usual haunt For these two or three years past they have not been seen and their place was immediately occupied by the hooded Crows    The Rook is an inhabitant of Europe according to Linnaeus but it would appear that there are some exceptions since Aldrovandus is of opinion that there are none in Italy  It is said that the young ones are good eating and that even the old ones are tolerable food when fat but this is very rare Country people have less aversion to their flesh knowing that they subsist not on carcases like the Ravens and the Carrion Crows  Specific character of the Rook  Corvus Frugilegus  Linn  Black its front ashcoloured its tail somewhat rounded  The Rooks are remarked to fly chiefly in the morning and the evening The  erucae  of the dorbeetle  Scarabaeus melolantha  LINN are what they search for in the ground They advance no nearer the pole than the south of Sweden  N  o  THE ROYSTON CROW  The HOODEDCROW  Le Corneille Mantelée  Buff  Corvus Cornix  Linn and Gmel  Cornix Cinerea  Briss  Cornix Cinerea Frugilega  Gesn and Ald  The Royston Crow  Ray and Will  This species seems to have been unknown to the ancient Greeks and Romans The moderns have given it the Latin appellations  CornixCinerea    Varia    Hyberna    Sylvestris    Corvus Semicinereus  in Italian  Mulacchia  or  Monacchia  in Swedish  Kraoka  in Polish  Vrona  in German  Holzkrae

distinguished from the CarrionCrow and the Rook by the colours of its plumage Its head tail and wings are of a fine black with bluish reflections it is marked with a sort of scapulary of a greyish white which extends both ways from the shoulders to the extremity of the body On account of this appearance it has been called by the Italians  Monacchia  or  Nun  and  Mantled Crow  by the French  The name  HoodedCrow  is common is Scotland  SIBBALD    It associates in numerous flocks like the Rook and perhaps is still more familiar with man preferring especially in winter the vicinity  of our farms and hamlets and picking up its food in the kennels and dunghills c  Like the Rook also the HoodedCrows change their abode twice ayear and may perhaps be considered as birds of passage for we annually perceive immense flocks arrive near the middle of autumn and depart about the beginning of spring shaping their course towards the north but we are uncertain where they stop Most authors assert that they pass the summer on the losty mountains  Aldrovandus Schwenckfeld and Belon  and build their nests in the pines or firs it must therefore be on mountains uninhabited and little known as in those of the Shetland isles where they are actually said to breed  British Zoology  The authors of that work add that it is the only species of Crow found in those islands  In Sweden also  Fauna Suecica  they nestle in the woods especially among the alders and lay commonly four eggs but they never settle in the mountains of Switzerland of Italy  Aldrovandus  c  Though according to most naturalists it lives on every sort of food worms insects fish  Frisch says that they are expert at picking fishbones and that when water is let out from pools they quickly perceive the fish that are left in the pool and lose no time in catching them It is easy therefore to perceive that the HoodedCrows may often frequent the sides of water but this was no sufficient reason for terming them aquatic or marine crows    and even putrid flesh and above all on the products of milk  Aldrovandus  and though these facts would rank it among the omnivorous tribe yet as seeds of various kinds mixed with small stones are found in its stomach  Gesner and Ray  we may infer that they are the nearest allied to the granivorous species and this is another trait in their character common to the Rook In other respects they resemble much the CarrionCrow they have nearly the same size the same port the same cry and the same flight the structure of their tail wings bill and feet the disposition of their internal parts are exactly the same  Willoughby  and if any difference can be perceived they incline to the nature of the Rook They often associate together and nestle on the trees  Frisch remarks that they place their nest sometimes on the tops of trees and sometimes on the lower branches which would imply that they sometimes breed in Germany I have lately ascertained that they nestle sometimes in France and particularly in Burgundy A flight of these Crows has resided constantly for two or three years past at Baumela Roche in certain holes of rocks possessed above a century by Rooks One year these Rooks not having returned a flock of fifteen or twenty HoodedCrows immediately occupied their scite have since had two hatches and are at present th May engaged with a third This is another analogous feature of the two species  both lay four or five eggs eat those of small birds and sometimes devour the helpless animals themselves  Analogies so striking to the CarrionCrow and the Rook would lead us to suspect that the HoodedCrow is only the hybridous offspring of these two species If it were only a variety of the CarrionCrow why does it fly in flocks and shift its abode twice ayear  The Raven and Crow are always seen and never migrate or abscond  ARISTOTLE  Hist Anim  lib ix  or if it were merely a variety of the Rook whence those numerous relations which it bears to the CarrionCrow But this double resemblance will be easily explained if we admit it to be a crossbreed participating of the qualities of both This opinion would appear plausible to philosophers who are accustomed to trace physical analogies but it derives additional probability from the consideration that the HoodedCrow is a new family entirely unknown to the ancients  Frisch says that the HoodedCrow has two cries the one hollow and wellknown the other shrill and somewhat resembling the crowing of a Cock He adds that it is ardently attached to its young and that if the tree on which its nest is built be cut down it will fall with it rather than abandon its offspring  A similar story is told by White in his "Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne" A pair of Ravens had for a course of years been accustomed to breed in an ancient oak the tree was cut down in the month of February when the birds were sitting and the dam was crushed by the fall    Linnaeus seems to apply to this bird what is said in the British Zoology with respect to the Rook that it is useful in destroying destructive insects But do they not themselves destroy more grain than the insects which they extirpate In many parts of Germany a price is set on their head  Frisch    They are caught in the same snares as are the other Crows They are found in all the countries of Europe but at different times Their flesh has a strong smell and is little used except by the lower sort of people  I know not for what reason Klein ranged the  Hoexotototl  or the WillowBird of Fernandez among the Crows unless on the assertion of Seba who describing this bird as the same with that mentioned by Fernandez makes it as large as an ordinary pigeon while Fernandez in the very place quoted by Seba says that the  Hoexotototl  is a small bird of the size of a sparrow having the song of the goldfinch and being good eating  The Crows must be widely scattered since they appear in the beautiful series of birds which Sonnerat has brought from India the Molucca islands and the land of the Papoux The individual mentioned in the text came from the Philippines  This is not much like a Crow and such mistakes which are so pregnant in Seba's work must only throw confusion into the nomenclature of natural history  Specific character of the HoodedCrow  CorvusCornix  Linn  Ashcoloured its head throat wings and tail black It weighs twentytwo ounces its length twentytwo inches its alar extent twentythree It is a bird of passage in Great Britain appearing in the beginning of winter and returning with the Woodcocks It is found as far north as the Feroe islands and Lapmark where it continues the whole year but chiefly on the seacoast subsisting on shellfish Its toes are very broad and flat which enables it to walk on marshy grounds  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE CROWS  I The SENEGAL CROW  Corvus Dauricus  Gmel and Pallas  The Whitebreasted Crow  Lath and Kolben  TO judge of this from its shape and colours which is all that we know of it we should suppose it most analogous to the HoodedCrow and differing only because its white scapulary is not so much extended Some distinctions are also perceived in the length of its wings the shape of its bill and the colour of its feet It is a new species and little known  This bird is described in Pallas's Travels and Gmelin thus states its specific character  It is black its nape whitish its neck and breast white  It is of the size of the Jackdaw being twelve inches long It arrives in numerous flocks early in the spring in the neighbourhood of Lake Baikal from China and the southern parts of the Mogul Empire    II The JAMAICA CROW  Corvus Jamaicensis  Gmel  Cornix Jamaicensis  Briss  The ChatteringCrow    or CacaoWalk  Ray Sloane and Lath  This foreign Crow seems to be modelled from ours only its tail and feet are smaller its plumage is black like that of the CarrionCrow In its stomach are found red berries grain and catterpillars which shews that its ordinary food is the same with that of our Rook and our HoodedCrow Its ventricle is muscular and lined in the inside with a very strong coat This bird abounds in the southern part of the island and never leaves the mountains in which respect it resembles our Raven  Klein characterises this species by the largeness of its nostrils but Dr Sloane whom he quotes says only that they are moderately large  It is obvious that it belongs to the Crows but it would be difficult to refer it to any one species since it unites the qualities proper to each and differs from them all by its continual chattering  Specific character  Totally black  it is eighteen inches long  N  o  THE JACKDAW  The JACKDAWS  Les Choucas  Buff  CorvusMonedula  Linn and Gmel  Cornix Garrula  Klein  Graculus  seu  Monedula  Gesner  Monedula  seu  Lupus  Aldrov Ray and Briss  The Kae  Sibbald  In Greek      in Latin  Lupus    Graccus    Gracculus    Monedula  which Scaliger derives from  moneta  a coin on account of this bird's disposition to pilfer in Spanish  Graio    Graia  in Italian  Ciagula    Tattula    Pola  in German  Tul  or  Duhl    Thale  or  Dahle    Thaleche  or  Dahlike  in Saxon  Aelcke    Kaeyke    Gacke  in Swiss  Graake  in Dutch  Kaw  in Flemish  Gaey    Hannekin  in Swedish  Kaja  in Turkish  Tschauka    THESE birds are nearly related to the Crows to institute a comparison between them would therefore throw light on the history of both As there are three species of Crows the black the CarrionCrow the cinereous the HoodedCrow and the bald the Rook so there are three corresponding ones among the Jackdaws a black one the Daw properly so called a cinereous the Chough and a bald The only difference is that the last is of America and has little black in its plumage In general the Jackdaws are smaller than the Crows their cry at least that of the two European species the  only kinds known to us is shriller and has influence in the forming of their names such as  Choucas    Graccus    Kaw    Kae  c But it appears that they have more than one inflexion of voice for I am assured that they sometimes call out  tian    tian    tian  They live upon insects grain fruits and even flesh though very rarely but they will not touch filth nor do they haunt the coasts to pick up the dead fish and other carcases that are cast ashore by the sea  Aldrovandus  In this circumstance they resemble more the Rook and even the HoodedCrow than the CarrionCrow but they approach the latter by the habit of searching and hunting for partridge eggs of which they destroy great numbers  They fly in large flocks like the Rooks like these too they form a sort of cantonments which are even more numerous consisting of a multitude of nests crouded upon one another in a large tree in a belfry or in the ruins of an old deserted castle  Belon Aldrovandus and Willoughby They prefer the holes of trees to the branches  The male and female when once paired remain a long time steadily united When the genial season returns which awakens the sensibility of the animal frame they eagerly court each other's society and prattle incessantly they toy and kiss till they are worked up to a  fury which can no longer be satisfied with the calmer joys nor do they omit these preliminaries when reduced to the state of captivity  Aristotle  de Generatione  lib iii  After fecundation the female lays five or six eggs marked with a few brown spots on a greenish ground and after the young are hatched she watches feeds and rears them with an affection which the male is eager to share In this respect the Jackdaw resembles the Crows especially the common sort but Charleton and Schwenckfeld assert that it has two hatches in the year which has never been affirmed of any of the Crows though it well corresponds to the order of nature the small species being always the most prolific  The Jackdaws are birds of passage though they are not so well entitled to that appellation as the Rooks and HoodedCrows since a number of them continue in the country through the summer The towers of Vincennes are at every season stocked with them and so are all old buildings which afford the same convenience and shelter but in France there are always fewer in summer than in winter Those which migrate form themselves into great bodies like the Rooks and the HoodedCrows sometimes they join the same army and continually chatter as they fly yet they keep not the same periods in France as in Germany for they leave Germany  in autumn with their young and appear not again till the spring after having wintered with us and Frisch was right in maintaining that they do not hatch during their absence since neither the Jackdaws nor other birds breed in winter  With respect to their internal structure I shall only observe that they have a muscular ventricle and near its superior orifice a dilatation of the oesophagus which serves in place of a crop as in the Crows but that the gallbladder is more elongated  They can be easily tamed and taught to speak They seem fond of the domestic state but they are faithless servants concealing the food which they cannot consume and secreting bits of money and jewels  To complete the history of the Jackdaws we have only to compare together the two kinds which are natives of Europe and afterwards subjoin as usual the foreign species and varieties  THE COMMON JACKDAW  Choucas  Buff  is of the size of a pigeon its iris is whitish it has some white streaks under its throat some dots of the same colour round its nostrils and some of an ash colour on the hind part of the head and neck the rest is entirely black which is deeper however  on the upper parts and glossed sometimes with violet sometimes with green  THE CHOUGH  Chouc  BUFF This is the  Monedula Nigra  of Brisson which Linnaeus makes to be a variety of the Common Jackdaw  Corvus Monedula  differs from the preceding in being rather smaller and perhaps less common its iris is bluish as in the Rooks the prevailing colour of its plumage is black without any cinereous mixture and small white points are observed round its eyes But in every other respect they are exactly alike and there is no reason to doubt that they belong to the same species and would breed together  We need not be surprised that birds so nearly related to the Crows should present the same varieties Aldrovandus saw in Italy a Jackdaw with a white collar this is probably the same with what is found in many parts of Switzerland and which for this reason the English call the  Helvetian Daw  The  MonedulaTorquata  of Brisson which Linnaeus regards as a variety The  CollaredJackdaw  of Latham    Schwenckfeld had occasion to see a white Daw with a yellowish bill These white Daws are more common in Norway and the cold countries in the temperate climates even as in Poland a small white Daw is sometimes found in the nest of the black Daws or Choughs  Rzacynzki  in this case the colour of the plumage does not depend on the  influence of climate but arises from a natural defect in the same way as white Ravens are bred in France and white Negroes born in Africa  Schwenckfeld speaks st of a variegated Daw which resembles the true Jackdaw except that its wings are white and its bill hooked Another Daw which is very rare and differs from the common kind in its being crossed  I had this year in my court yard four tufted hens of a Flemish breed which had the bill crossed the upper mandible was very hooked and at least as much so as in the crossbill itself the lower was almost straight These hens could not feed on the ground so well as others it was necessary that grain should be laid of a considerable thickness  But these are perhaps individual varieties or monstrous productions  Specific character of the Jackdaw  Corvus Monedula  LINN  It is dusky the back of its head hoary its wings and tail black  The Jackdaw weighs nine ounces its length thirteen inches and its breadth twentyeight It is found as far north as Sondmor and sometimes in the Feroe islands it leaves Smoland and East Gothland immediately after harvest and returns in the spring with the staresMr White in his Natural History of Selborne relates a singular fact That in a neighbouring warren the Daws sometimes breed under ground in the rabbitburrows  N  o  THE ALPINE CROW  The ALPINE DAW  In Swiss  Alpkachtel    Wildtul Alpkae    WildDaw  in German  Bergdol    Alprapp    MountainDaw    AlpRaven    Le Choquard  ou  Choucas des Alpes  Buff  CorvusPyrrhocorax  Linn and Gmel  Pyrrhocorax  Gesner and Aldrovandus  The Alpine Crow  Lath  PLINY calls this bird  Pyrrhocorax  which name alone includes an abridged description  Korax  which signifies Crow marks the blackness of its plumage as well as the analogy of its species and  pyrrhos  which means rufous or orange denotes the colour of its bill which in fact varies between yellow and orange and also that of its feet which are still more variable since they were red in the subject examined by Gesner and black in the one described by Brisson That author mentions also their being sometimes yellow and others relate that they are yellow in winter and red in summer These yellow feet and bill which last is smaller than that of the Jackdaw have made it be taken for the Blackbird and termed the Great Alpine Blackbird But if we draw a comparison we shall find that it approaches much nearer to the Jackdaws by the size of its body the length of its  wings and even the shape of its bill though slenderer and by its nostrils being covered with feathers which are thinner indeed than in the Jackdaws  In the article of the Redlegged Crow or Cornish Chough I have stated the difference between these two birds which Belon and some others who have not seen them have confounded together  Pliny believed the  Pyrrohocorax  to be of the Alps  Hist Nat  lib x  but Gesner who has accurately pointed out the distinction between it and the Redlegged Crow says that in certain parts of the country of the Grisons this bird does not appear in winter and in other parts that it is seen nearly the whole year but that its favourite residence where it settles in numerous flocks is the summit of lofty mountains These facts restrict somewhat the opinion of Pliny but at the same time they confirm it  The Alpine Daw is of a middle size between the Jackdaw and the CarrionCrow its bill is smaller and more arched than either its cry is shriller and more plaintive than the Jackdaw and by no means agreeable  Schwenckfeld says that the  Pyrrhocorax  which he terms also the  NightCrow  is noisy especially during the night and seldom appears in the day but I am not certain if Schwenckfeld means the same bird as I do by that name    It lives chiefly upon grain and is very destructive among the crops its flesh is very indifferent eating The inhabitants of the mountains draw meteorological predictions from its manner of flying if it rises aloft they lay their account for cold if it keep near the surface they expect mild weather  Specific character of the  CorvusPyrrhocorax  LINN  It is blackish its bill yellowish its feet black  It is fifteen inches long  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE JACKDAWS  I The MUSTACHIO DAW  Corvus Hottentottus  Linn and Gmel  Monedula Capitis Bonae Spei  Briss  The Hottentot Crow  Lath  THIS bird is nearly the size of the Blackbird its plumage is of a glossy black like the Jackdaw's and its tail is proportionably longer than in any of them all the feathers which compose it are equal and the wings when closed do not extend half its length the fourth and fifth are the longest of all reaching two inches and a half farther than the first  There are two circumstances to be remarked in the exterior of this bird Those long and flexible black hairs which arise from the base of the upper mandible and which are twice as long as the bill besides many other hairs shorter and stiffer and pointing forwards and spreading over this same base as far as the corners of the mouth Those long and narrow feathers inserted  in the upper part of the neck which play on the back and form a sort of mane  Specific character  It is greenish black its tail equal with very long mustachios  Its length is eleven inches and a quarter    II The BALDDAW  Corvus Calvus  Gmel  The BaldCrow  Lath  This singular Daw corresponds to the Rook the anterior part of its head is bare as in the Rook and its throat is only shaded with a few straggling feathers Its relation to the Daws in general is marked by the length of its wings the shape of its feet its port its bulk and its wide nostrils which are almost round But it differs because its nostrils are not covered with feathers and are placed in a deep cavity on either side of the bill and also because its bill is broader near the base and scalloped at the edges I can say nothing with respect to its history It has not even received a name in any treatise of ornithology It is a native of Cayenne  Specific character  It is duskyferruginous its front and top bald  It is rather larger than the Jackdaw being thirteen inches long    III The NEW GUINEA DAW  Corvus Novae Guineae  Gmel  The New Guinea Crow  The natural place this bird ought to occupy is between our Daws and what I call  Colnud  It has the figure of the Daws the grey plumage of one of them at least on the upper part of the body but it is not so large and its bill is broader in the base in which it resembles the  Colnud  It differs from the last by the length of its wings which reach almost to the end of its tail and from the  Colnud  and the Daws by the colours of the underside of the body which consist of black and white stripes that extend to the wings and which bear some resemblance to those in the variegated Woodpecker  The specific character of this bird includes a full description which would only be an unnecessary repetition of the text and is therefore omitted    IV The PAPUAN DAW  Le Choucari de la Nouvelle Guineé  Buff  Corvus Papuensis  Gmel  The Papuan Crow  Lath  The prevailing colour of this bird for we know only its surface is an ashgrey deeper in the upper side and lighter in the under and diluting by degrees almost to white under the belly and the parts adjacent There are only two exceptions to this uniformity of plumage A black ring which surrounds the base of the bill and extends as far as the eyes The great quills of the wings which are of a blackish brown  In this bird the nostrils are as in the preceding entirely covered with white feathers the bill is nearly similar except that the ridge of the upper mandible is not round as in the Jackdaws but angular as in the  Colnud  It bears other relations also to the last and resembles it in the proportions of its wings which extend no farther than the middle of its tail in the smallness of its feet and in the shortness of its nails In short we cannot hesitate to place it as well as the preceding between the Jackdaws and the  Colnuds  Its length reckoning from the point of the bill to the extremity of the tail is about thirteen inches  We owe this new species as well as the preceding to Sonnerat  Specific character  It is cinereous its belly white its wingquills dusky blackish    V The CAYENNE COLNUD  ie  NakedNeck    Corvus Nudus  Gmel  The Barenecked Crow  Lath  I rank this bird after the Daws though it differs from them in some respects because it is certainly more analogous to these than to any birds of our continent  Like No II it has a very broad bill at the base and resembles it also in another respect in being bald but this is in a diffeent way the neck being almost naked and featherless Its head is covered from the nostrils inclusively with a sort of black velvet cap consisting of small straight feathers short interwoven and very soft to the feel these are more straggling under the neck and much more so under the sides and in the hind part  The Colnud is nearly of the size of our Jackdaws and we may add that it wears their livery for its plumage is entirely black except  some of the coverts and the wingquills which are of a whitish grey  To look at the feet of the one which I observed one would suppose that the hindtoe was forcibly turned back but this is its natural position and it can be directed forward occasionally as in the martins I have even remarked that it is connected with a membrane to the inner toe in each foot It is a new species  Specific character  It is black having a cape waved with soft feathers its neck thinly covered with feathers    VI The PHILIPPINE BALICASE  In the Philippines it is called  BaliCassio    CorvusBalicassius  Gmel  Monedula Philippensis  Briss  The Philippine Crow  Lath  I cannot prevail upon myself to give this bird the appellation of a Daw as Brisson has done since from his description even it appears to differ widely from them Its wings extend only fifteen or sixteen inches and it is scarcely larger than a Blackbird its bill is thicker and longer in proportion than in any of the European Jackdaws its feet slenderer and its tail forked  lastly instead of the shrill gloomy cries of the Jackdaws it has a soft pleasant song Such differences would lead us to expect many more when the bird is better known  Its bill and feet are black its plumage of the same colour with green reflections its colour at least is the same therefore with that of the Jackdaw  Specific character  It is of a greenish black its tail forked    N  o  THE MAGPIE  The MAGPIE  In Greek  or  and on account of its variegated plumage  in Latin  Pica    Cissa  and according to some  Avis Pluvia  RainBird in wretched modern Latin  Ajacia  in Spanish  Pega    Picata    Pigazza  and in Catalonia  Grassa  in Italian  Gazza    Ragazza    Aregazza    Gazzuola    Gazzara    Pica    Putta  in German  Aeloter    Atzel    Aegerst    Agerluster  in Flemish  Aexter  in Polish  Stroka  in Swedish  Skata

 Piot  Will Alb c  THIS bird resembles the crow so much in external appearance that Linnaeus has classed them under the same genus and Belon remarks that if the tail of the Magpie was shortened and the white removed from its plumage it would be really a crow In fact the Magpie has the bill the feet the eyes and the general shape of the crows and jackdaws it has also many of their instincts and habits for it is omnivorous living on all sorts of fruits and devouring even carrion  KLEIN  I saw one that are greedily the skin of an orange  robbing the small birds' nests of the eggs and the young and seizing sometimes the parents either by an  open attack or by surprising them while ensnared One has been known to fall upon a blackbird another to snatch a crab but strangled by the closing of the claws c  ALDROVANDUS  It occasions much disorder in the catching of birds by calls and dares so to say the fowler in his hut  Its fondness for live flesh has suggested the breeding it for falconry like the ravens  Frisch  It commonly spends the warm season paired with its female and engaged in hatching and breeding its young In the winter it goes in flocks and approaches the hamlets where it has greater resources which the severity of the season renders the more necessary It is easily reconciled to the sight of man soon grows familiar in the house and at last becomes master I knew one which passed a day and night among a crew of cats which it was shrewd enough to command  It prattles nearly like the carrioncrow and learns to imitate the cries of animals and even the human voice One is mentioned which could exactly mimic the calf the kid the sheep and even the notes of the shepherd's pipe another repeated completely the flourish of trumpets  Plutarch relates that a Magpie which amused itself with imitating human discourse the cry of animals and the sound of instruments having one day heard a flourish of trumpets became mute all of a sudden which surprised persons who had been accustomed to hear it chatter incessantly but they were much more surprised sometime after when quite unexpectedly it broke silence not to repeat its usual lesson but to copy the notes and modulations of the trumpets  PLUTARCH  Willoughby knew many which  could pronounce whole phrases  Margot  is the word commonly given them because they can the most readily articulate it and Pliny assures us that this bird is very fond of that sort of imitation is pleased with repeating the words it has learned studies patiently and earnestly to recal those it has lost is overjoyed with the discovery and sometimes dies of vexation if its recollection fails it or if its tongue refuses to pronounce a hard word  Hist Nat  lib x    The tongue of the Magpie is like that of the raven for the most part black It alights on the backs of hogs and sheep like the jackdaw and searches after the vermin which infest these animals with this difference however that the hog receives its civilities with complaisance but the sheep no doubt more delicate and sensible seems to dread it  Salerne  It also snaps very dexterously the flies and other winged insects which come in its way  The Magpie can be caught by the same snares and in the same manner with the carrioncrow and it is addicted to the same bad habits of stealing and hoarding up provisions  I have verified this fact by scattering before a tame Magpie pieces of money and little bits of glass It was discovered also that they conceal their theft with such great care that it was sometimes difficult to make a detection under the bed for instance or between the quilts    habits almost ever inseparable in the different species of animals It is imagined also to forebode rain when it chatters more than usually  Aldrovandus  On the other hand many circumstances concur to separate it from the crows  It is much smaller than even the jackdaw not weighing more than eight or nine ounces its wings are shorter and its tail longer in proportion and hence its flight is neither so lofty nor so well supported It never undertakes distant journies but only flies from tree to tree or from steeple to steeple When on the ground it is in a continual flutter hopping as much as walking and briskly wagging its tail It shews in general more restlessness and activity than the crows it is more malicious and is disposed to a species of raillery  I once saw a Magpie flying towards a bird which happened to be tied to some place and as it was reaching to eat a bit of flesh the Magpie removed the morsel with its tail I thence concluded that the Magpie delights in tantalizing other birds  Avicenna  apud Gesnerum  The female accordingly displays greater art and contrivance in the construction of her nest whether because she is more ardent for the male  The ancients had this idea for from the name of the Magpie  they formed the verb    to desire  and therefore more attached to its young or because she is aware that many birds of rapine  are forward to plunder its eggs and its brood and besides that some of them are prompted to retaliate She places her nest on the tops of the loftiest trees or at least on high bushes  It commonly builds in the skirts of woods or on vineyards  and with the assistance of the male strengthens it on the outside with flexible twigs and worked mud and environs the whole with a basketing of small thorny branches closely entangled leaving only in the thickest and most accessible side a small hole for entering But not contented with safety alone she seeks convenience she lines the bottom of the nest with a sort of round mattress  The Blackbird and Magpie spread a bedding under their young  ARISTOTLE  Hist Anim  lib ix  I take this opportunity to observe that many writers have thought that the  of Aristotle is the same with our jay because the  is described to hoard up acorns which are the principal food of the jay but it is admitted that this food is common to both the jay and the Magpie and there are two characters peculiar to the jay which Aristotle could not fail to have observed viz the two blue marks on the wings and the sort of crest which the bird makes by occasionally bristling the feathers on the head Since Aristotle is silent on these particulars I conjecture that his Magpie and ours are the same bird and likewise the longtailed variegated Magpie which was new at Rome and rare even in the time of Pliny  Lib  x  on which the young repose soft and warm and though this lining which is the true nest be only six inches in diameter the whole mass including the thorny embrasure is at least two feet every way  But all these precautions are not sufficient to remove her anxiety and apprehensions she is  perpetually on the watch if she perceive a crow to approach she flies immediately to meet him harasses him and pursues him to a distance  Frisch  If the enemy be more formidable a falcon for instance or an eagle yet will not fear restrain she rushes on danger with a temerity which is not always crowned with success Her conduct must sometimes however be more considerate if we believe what is alleged that when she sees a person spying her nest with too envious an eye she transports the eggs to some other place either between her claws or in a way still more incredible  To the underside of a twig they glue two eggs with their excrements and having taken the burthen on their neck they transport it thus equally poised  PLINY  lib  x  Sportsmen tell stories no less strange about her skill in arithmetic though her knowledge extends not beyond the number five  Sportsmen say that if a Magpie sees a man enter a hut built at the foot of the tree on which it breeds it will not go into its nest till it has perceived the man leave the hut that if two enter and only one comes out it will not be deceived by the stratagem but will stay till the second also comes out that it will likewise distinguish three out of four and even four out of five beyond which it cannot discriminate It would thence follow that the Magpie has a distinct idea of the series of numbers from one to five and it must be confessed that the glance of a man's eye is not perhaps more accurate    She lays seven or eight eggs at each hatch and breeds only once a year unless the nest be destroyed or deranged in which case she constructs another and both parents exert themselves  with such ardour as to complete it in less than a day They have afterwards a second hatch consisting of four or five eggs and if they be again disturbed they will rebuild the nest and make a third hatch though still smaller than the preceding  Something of this kind has made the stratagem be imputed to the Magpie of having constantly two nests with a view to disappoint the birds of prey by shifting from the one to the other It was for the same reason that the tyrant Dionysius had thirty bedchambers  The eggs of the Magpie are never so large or of so deep a colour as those of the Raven they are marked with brown spots strewed on a bluegreen ground most crowded about the thick end John Liebault quoted by Salerne is the only one who affirms that the male and female sit alternately  The Magpies are hatched blind and shapeless and it is some time before they assume their destined form The mother not only rears them with an anxious care but takes an interest in them after they are grown up Their flesh is indifferent eating though it is not held in such aversion as that of young crows  With respect to the difference remarked in the plumage I conceive it to be not absolutely specific since among the ravens the crows and the jackdaws individuals are found variegated like the Magpie with black and white we must admit indeed that in the former black  is the ordinary colour as the mixture of white and black is in the latter But this is not uniform and if we examine the bird closely or view it in certain lights we may perceive shades of green purple and violet though not expected in a bird so little celebrated for beauty of plumage  British Zoology  The male is distinguished from the female by the deeper blue gloss on the upper part of its body and not by the blackness of its tongue as some have alleged  The Magpie is subject to moult like the other birds but it is observed that the feathers drop successively and by degrees except those on the head which are detached all at once so that at the annual return of the season it appears bald  PLINY  lib  x  The young ones do not get their long tail before the second year and no doubt this is the time when they become adult  All that I can learn with respect to the duration of the life of the Magpie is that Dr Derham kept one twenty years when it grew blind with age  Albin    This bird is very common in France England Germany Sweden and in every part of Europe except Lapland  Fauna Suecica No  M Hebert assures me that no Magpies are seen in the mountains of Bugey or even at the height of Nantua  it is also rare in mountainous countries which shews that it  cannot support excessive cold I shall close this account with a short description which will illustrate what cannot be represented at all or which the figure expresses imperfectly  It has twenty quills in each wing the first of which is very short and the fourth and fifth the longest twelve unequal quills in the tail diminishing always in length the farther they are from the two middle ones which are the longest of all the nostrils round the internal eyelids marked with a yellow spot the edges of the chops beset with hairs the tongue blackish and forked the intestines about twentytwo inches long the  coecums  half an inch the  oesophagus  dilated and covered with glands at its junction with the ventricle which is but little muscular the kidney oblong and the gallbladder of the ordinary size  Willughby    I have already said that there are white Magpies as well as white ravens and though the principal cause of this change of the plumage is the influence of northern climates as may be supposed of the white Magpie of Wormius  Musaeum Wormianum  p  It was sent me from Norway where two young ones of this kind were found in the nest It is evidently from its form a Magpie only of a white colour and smaller not being yet full grown Its head appears smooth  which was brought from Norway and even  of some of those mentioned by Rzacynski  A white Magpie was hatched in the town of Camarn in the Russian palatinate Five Magpies of the same colour were seen near Viaska In Volhinia not far from the township of Olika another was found  RZACYNZKI  Actuarium  p  I must confess however that they are sometimes found in temperate climates for instance the one caught some years ago in Sologne which was entirely white except a single black feather in the middle of its wings  Salerne  whether it had migrated from the northern countries to France after having undergone this change or was bred in France and the change of colour owing to some accidental cause We must say the same of the white Magpies that have sometimes been seen in Italy  GERINI  Storia degli Uccelli  tom ii p    Wormius remarks that the head of his white Magpie was smooth and bare because he probably saw it in the moulting season which confirms what I have said with regard to the common Magpies  Willughby saw in the king of England's collection Magpies of a brown or rusty colour which may be esteemed a second variety of the ordinary sort  Specific character of the Magpie  CorvusPica  LINN  It is variegated with black and white its tail wedgeshaped  Its length is eighteen inches its breadth only twentyfour It is found also in the island of Madeira  FOREIGN BIRDS RELATED TO THE MAGPIE  I The SENEGAL MAGPIE  IT is somewhat less than ours but its wings being proportionably longer are nearly of the same extent its tail on the contrary is shorter though of the same shape The bill the feet and the nails are black as in the common Magpie but the plumage is very different It has not a particle of white and all the colours are dull the head the neck the back and the breast are black with violet reflections the quills of the tail and the great quills of the wings are brown All the rest is blackish with different degrees of intensity  II The JAMAICA MAGPIE  This bird weighs only six ounces and is about a third smaller than the common Magpie  which it resembles in its bill its feet and its tail  The plumage of the male is black with purple reflections that of the female is brown darker on the back and all the upper side of the body and lighter under the belly  They build their nest on the branches of trees They are found in every part of the island but are most numerous at a distance from the scene of bustle After breeding they quit their concealments and in autumn they spread over the settlements in such prodigious multitudes as sometimes to darken the air They fly thus in flocks for miles and wherever they alight they occasion considerable damage to the planters In winter their resource is to crowd to the barndoors Such facts would lead us to suppose that they are frugivorous but they have a strong smell and their flesh is rank and coarse and seldom eaten  It follows from what I have said that this bird differs from our Magpie not only in its mode of feeding in its size and in its plumage but is besides distinguished by its being able to continue long on wing by its associating in numerous flocks and by the rankness of its flesh The difference of sex is attended with a still greater in the colours In short if we add that the common Magpie could not traverse the immense ocean which separates the two continents and could not support the intense  cold of a northern passage we may conclude the American Magpies to be analogous to ours and their representatives in the new world but not derived from the same common stock  The tesquizana  I have formed this word by contraction for the Mexican  Tequixquiacazanatl  Fernandez calls it also  Stare of Salt Marshes  and the Spaniards  Tordo  thrush This bird has a plaintive song  FERNANDEZ  Hist Avium Novae Hispaniae  cap xxxiv  of Mexico seems to bear a great resemblance to this Jamaica Magpie since according to Fernandez its tail is very long and its size is inferior to that of the stare its plumage is of a glossy black it flies in numerous flocks which are destructive to the cultivated fields where they alight it breeds in the spring and its flesh is tough and rank In a word this bird might be considered as a sort of stare or jackdaw but if we except the plumage a jackdaw with a long tail resembles much a Magpie  It is quite different with respect to the isana  Id  cap xxxii  He calls it  Izanatl  others  Yxilaolzanatl  of Fernandez which Brisson confounds with the Jamaica Magpie The bill indeed the feet and the plumage have the same colours in both but the isana is larger and its bill is twice as long besides it prefers the coldest parts of Mexico and in its instincts its habits and its cry it resembles the stare It would be difficult I imagine to trace these characters in  the Jamaica Magpie of Catesby and if it must be referred to the same genus it ought at least to be formed into a separate species The authority of Fernandez the only naturalist who has had an opportunity of viewing the bird is surely of more weight than the artificial classification of a systemmaker and that experienced observer says that it bore a stronger analogy to the stare than to the Magpie However we may be deceived in a subject of this kind where our information is drawn from imperfect descriptions and inaccurate figures I shall add that the isana has a sort of jeering note common to most of the birds termed American  Magpies  III The MAGPIE of the ANTILLES  See  L'Historie generale des Antilles  tom i p  Aldrovandus  tom i p    Corvus Caribaeus  Gmel  Galgalus Antillarum  Briss  Pica Cauda Indica  Ray  The Persian Pie  Will  The Carribaean Crow  Lath  Brisson has classed this bird with the rollers for no other reason that I can discover except that in Aldrovandus's figure the nostrils are  naked which Brisson reckons one of the characters of the roller but we cannot with certainty infer from a figure which Brisson himself considers as inaccurate a property so minute that it would escape the notice of a designer To this we may oppose a remarkable character which could not be overlooked viz the long quills in the middle of the tail which Brisson considers as belonging exclusively to the Magpie The Magpie of the Antilles resembles ours in its cry in its confident disposition in its nestling on trees in its sauntering by the margin of streams and in the coarseness of its flesh  Hist des Antilles  The Magpie also walks by the sides of water since it sometimes catches crabs as we have already said  in short if we must rank it with the most analogous European birds it ought to be placed among the Magpies  It differs however by the excessive length of the two middle quills of the tail which stretch six or eight inches beyond the lateral ones  I do not mean the singular property ascribed to it by Aldrovandus that there are only eight quills in the tail that naturalist counted them only in a coloured figure a very uncertain method of judging Father Dutertre indeed repeats the same thing but most probably he copies Aldrovandus with whose  ornithology  he was well acquainted since he quotes it in the next page Besides he was accustomed to make his descriptions from memory which requires assistance and lastly the Magpie of the Antilles is perhaps the only one in which he mentions the number of the tailquills  its colours are also different the bill and  feet being red the neck blue with a white collar the head of the same blue tinged with a white spot streaked with black which extends from the origin of the upper mandible to the junction of the neck the back of a tawny colour the rump yellow the two long quills of the tail striped with blue and white those of the wing mixed with green and blue and the under side of the body white  Upon comparing Father du Tertre's description of the Magpie of the Antilles with that of Aldrovandus's longtailed Magpie of India we cannot doubt but they were formed from a bird of the same species and consequently it is an American bird as we are assured by Father du Tertre who saw it at Guadaloupe and not a native of Japan as Aldrovandus asserts from a very uncertain tradition  The emperor of Japan transmitted this most beautiful bird some years since to his holiness the Pope as a remarkable present as I have learned from the marquis Facchinetto who said that it was received by his uncle Innocent IX  ALDROVANDUS  unless we suppose that it had penetrated towards the north and thus spread through both continents  IV The HOCISANA  FERNANDEZ cap xxxiii  The Mexican name is  Hocitzanatl  it is also called  Caxcaxtototl    Corvus Mexicanus  Gmel  Pica Mexicana Major  Briss  Le Criard  Pernetty's Voy  The Mexican Crow  Lath  Though Fernandez calls this bird a great stare we may from his own account refer it to the genus of Magpies for he tells us that it would be exactly like the common jackdaw if it were somewhat smaller its tail and nails shorter and its plumage of a purer black and not mixed with blue But a long tail is the property not of the stare but of the Magpie and what discriminates it the most in its external appearance from the jackdaw With regard to the other characters which separate the Hocisana from the jackdaw they are as much foreign to the stare as to the Magpie if not more so  This bird courts the residence of man it is as familiar as the Magpie chatters like it and has a shrill cry its flesh is black and very well tasted  Specific character  Entirely of a bluish black    V The VARDIOLE  It is called  Waygehoe  or  Wardioe    Seba has given this bird the appellation of the  Bird of Paradise  as he has to almost all foreign birds with long tails In this respect the Vardiole was entitled to the name since its tail is double the extreme length of its body But this tail is not formed as in the bird of paradise for its quill feathers are furnished with vanes through their whole length besides many other differences  White is the prevailing colour in this bird we must only except the head and neck which are black with very bright purple reflections the feet which are of a light red the wings whose quills have black vanes and the two middle ones of the tail which stretch much beyond the rest and which are marked with black along their shaft from the base to half of their length  The eyes of the Vardiole are lively and encircled with white the base of the upper mandible is shaded with little hairlike black feathers that meet behind and cover the nostrils its wings are short and extend not beyond the origin of its tail So far it resembles the Magpie but it differs on account of the shortness of its feet which are only the half in proportion  a circumstance attended with other differences in its figure and port  It is found in the island of Papoe according to Seba whose description is the only original one and comprehends all that is known about this bird  VI The ZANOE  The Mexican name is  Tsanahoei    CorvusZanahoe  Gmel  Pica Mexicana Minor  Briss  The Lesser Mexican Crow  Lath  Fernandez compares this Mexican bird to the common Magpie for its size for the length of its tail for the perfection of its senses for its talents for speaking and for its proneness to steal whatever pleases its fancy He adds that its plumage is entirely black except on the neck and head where we can perceive a fulvous tinge  Specific character  Blackish its head and neck somewhat fulvous its tail long    The JAY  In Greek according to Belon  in modern Greek  in Latin  Garrulus  in Spanish  Gayo    Cayo  in Italian  Ghiandaia    Gaza Verla    Berta    Bertina    Baretino  in German  Hăher    Hătzler    Baum Hatzel  TreeJay  Eichenheher  OakJay  Nussheher  NutJay  Nusshecker  NutHedger  Jăck    Broekexter

Gesner Aldrov and Ray  WHAT we have said with regard to the instinct of the Magpie we hold almost entirely in respect to the Jay it will be sufficient therefore to notice the characteristic differences  The principal one is the blue spot or rather mail formed by various shades of blue with which each of its wings is decorated and which suffices to distinguish it at least from all the other European birds It has also on its forehead a tuft of small feathers black blue and white in general its feathers have all a soft and silky feel and it can at pleasure raise and depress those on its head It is a fourth part less than the Magpie its tail is shorter and its  N  o  THE JAY  wings longer in proportion but notwithstanding it can scarcely fly better  Belon    The male is distinguished by the bulk of his head and the lustre of his colours  Olina  The old ones differ also from the young in their plumage and hence the various inconsistent descriptions  Willoughby says that in the Jay described by Aldrovandus no transverse spots appear on the tail Its feet are gray according to Belon they are brown verging on fleshcolour according to Brisson and our own observations    The Jays are of a petulant disposition they have keen sensations and brisk movements and in their frequent bursts of rage they hurry into danger and often entangle their head between two branches and die thus suspended in the air  GESNER  This instinct makes those battles credible which are said to be fought between armies of Jays and those of Magpies  When they feel restraint their violence exceeds bounds and hence in a cage they entirely lose their beauty by the continual rumpling wearing and breaking of their feathers  Their ordinary cry is harsh and frequent they are also fond of imitating other birds whose notes are not more agreeable such as the kestril the tawny owl c  Frisch  If they perceive in the wood a fox or other ravenous animal they give  a certain shrill scream to alarm their companions they quickly assemble presuming that they shall be formidable by their numbers or at least by their noise  Frisch  This instinct which the Jays have of summoning their force together with their violent antipathy to the brown owl suggest several ways of ensnaring them and the sport is commonly very successful  Belon  for they are more petulant than the magpies and by no means so suspicious or crafty nor is their natural cry so various though they have great flexibility of throat and have a turn for imitating all the cries and sounds of animals which they habitually hear and even human discourse The word  Richard  they can the most easily imitate The have also like the magpie and all the family of the daws crows and ravens the habit of burying their superfluous provisions  Id  and of stealing whatever they can obtain But they cannot always recognize the spot where they have buried their treasure or like all misers they are more actuated by the fear of encroaching on their stock than by the desire of using it so that in the succeeding spring the acorns and nuts that were concealed perhaps forgotten germinate in the earth and their tender leaves discover the useless heap though too late to the frugal sordid hoarders  The Jays breed in woods remote from human dwellings preferring the most branchy oaks whose trunks are entwined with ivy  Olina  but they are not so artful and cautious as the magpies in building their nests I have received many of these in the month of May they were hollow hemispheres formed with small interwoven roots open above without any soft lining and without any exterior defence I always found them to contain four or five eggs others say that the number is five or six They were smaller than pigeons eggs gray with more or less of a greenish hue and with small spots faintly marked  The young undergo their moulting in July they keep company with their parents till the succeeding spring  British Zoology  when they separate to form new pairs By this time the blue plate on their wings which appears very early has attained its highest beauty  In the domestic condition to which they easily conform themselves they become accustomed to all sorts of food and live in this way eight or ten years  Olina Frisch  In the state of freedom they feed not only on acorns and filberts but on chesnuts peas beans sorbs goosberries cherries rasberries c They also prey on the young of other birds when they can surprise them in the nest during the absence of the parents  and sometimes they venture to attack the old ones when they discover them entangled in snares and in this case they advance with their usual imprudence and are often caught themselves  Frisch  British Zoology  Their flesh though not delicate is eatable particularly if it be boiled first and afterwards roasted  In Jays the first phalanx of the outer toe is in each foot connected with that of the middle toe the inside of the mouth is black the tongue of the same colour forked thin membranous and almost transparent the gallbladder is oblong the stomach not so thick and lined with weaker muscles than the gizzard in the granivorous tribe Their gullet must be very wide for they swallow acorns filberts and even chesnuts entire like the ringdoves  Belon  I know however that they never thus treat the flowercup of a pink though they are exceedingly fond of the seed which it contains I have often admired their procedure if a pink be thrown to them they seize it greedily and if others be offered they continue to snatch them till their bill can hold no more When they want to eat these they lay aside all the rest but one hold it with the right foot and pluck off the petals one by one keeping a watchful eye all the time and casting a glance on every side at last when the seed appears they devour  it greedily and again begin to pluck a second flower  This bird is found in Sweden Scotland England Germany and Italy and is I believe a native of every country in Europe and even of the corresponding climates of Asia  Pliny mentions a kind of Jays or magpies with five toes which learned to speak better than the rest  Lib x  This is not more wonderful than that there should exist hens with five toes especially as the Jays become more familiar and domestic than hens and we know well that all animals which live with man and feed richly are subject to exuberance of growth The phalanges of the toes might be multiplied in some individuals beyond the usual number a deviation which has been ascribed too generally to every species  Aldrovandus    But another variety more generally known in this species is the White Jay It has the blue mark on the wings  Gerini  but is distinguished from the common Jay by the almost universal whiteness of its plumage which extends even to its bill and nails and by the red colour of its eyes a property observed in so many other white animals But we must not imagine that this white complexion is entirely pure it is often shaded with a yellowish tinge of various intensity In a subject which I examined the  coverts of the wings were the whitest its feet also seemed to be more slender than those of the common Jay  Specific character of the Jay  Corvus Glandarius  LINN  The coverts of its wings are skyblue with transverse white and black lines its body variegated ferruginous  It weighs between six and seven ounces its length is thirteen inches breadth twenty and a half It is esteemed one of the most beautiful of the British birds  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE JAY  I The REDBILLED JAY of CHINA  Corvus Erythrorynchos  Gmel  The Redbilled Jay  Lath  THIS new kind of Jay has been just introduced into France Its red bill is the more remarkable as the whole of the forepart of the head the neck and even the breast is of a fine velvet black The hind part of its head and neck is of a soft gray which mixes in small spots on the crown with the black of the forepart the upper side of the body is brown the under whitish But to form a clear idea of the colours we must suppose a violet tint spread over them all except the black deeper on the wings fainter on the back and still more dilute under the belly The tail is tapered and the wings exceed not onethird of its length and each of its quills is marked with three colours viz a light violet at its origin black at its middle and white at its extremity  but the violet is more extensive than the black and that still more than the white  The feet are red like the bill the nails whitish at their origin and brown near the point and are besides very long and hooked  This Jay is somewhat larger than ours and may be only a variety arising from the influence of climate  Specific character  The body dusky above and whitish below the tail wedgeshaped the tailquills dilute violet at the base black in the middle and white at the tips    II The PERUVIAN JAY  Le Geai du Perou  Buff  Corvus Peruvianus  Gmel  The plumage of this bird is of singular beauty it consists of an assemblage of the finest colours sometimes melting with inimitable art and sometimes forming a contrast which heightens the effect The delicate green which prevails in the upper part of its body extends on the one side over the six midquills of the tail and on the other it advances passing by insensible shades and receiving at the same time a bluish tint to join a sort of white crown on the head The base of the bill is surrounded with a fine blue which appears again behind the eye and  in the space below it A kind of black velvet which covers the throat and all the forepart of the neck is contrasted at its upper margin with the fine blue colour and at its lower to the jonquil yellow which is spread over the breast the belly and the three lateral quills on each side of the tail The tail is tapered and more so than the Siberian Jay  Nothing is known with regard to the qualities of this bird which has never been seen in Europe  III The BROWN CANADA JAY or CINEREOUS CROW  Lath  Corvus Canadensis  Linn and Gmel  Garrulus Canadensis Fuscus  Briss  The Cinereous Crow  Penn and Lath  If it were possible to suppose that the Jay could migrate into America I should be inclined to suppose that this is a variety of our European species for it has the appearance and the port and also those soft silky feathers which are conceived to belong peculiarly to the Jay It is distinguished only by its inferior size by the colours of its plumage and by the length and shape of its tail which is tapered Such slight differences might be ascribed to climate  but our Jay is unable to traverse the intervening ocean Till therefore we receive a fuller account of the habits of the Brown Jay of Canada we shall consider it as one of the foreign species the most analogous to our Jay  The upper side of the body is of a brown colour the under side and also the crown of the head the throat and the forepart of the neck are of a dirty white which also appears at the extremity of the tail and wings In the individual which I observed the bill and the legs were of a deep brown the under side of the body of a deeper brown and the lower mandible broader than in the figure lastly the feathers on the throat jutting forward formed a sort of barbil  Specific character  It is dusky the front yellowish the underside of the body and the tips of the tailquills white  It inhabits the northern and western parts of America breeds early in the spring and builds its nest with sticks and grass in the pines It lays two and rarely three eggs which are blue The young are quite black They fly in pairs the male and female being precisely alike They store up berries in hollow trees yet they are avaricious and so bold as to visit the huts of the natives and pilfer whatever they can snatch even salted meat They are seldom seen in the month of January unless near dwellings    IV The SIBERIAN JAY  Corvus Sibiricus  Gmel  The points of analogy between this new species and our Jay consist in a certain family likeness and that the shape of the bill and feet and the position of the nostrils are nearly the same and also that the Siberian Jay has like ours narrow feathers on its head which it can raise at pleasure as a crest The discriminating properties are these it is smaller its tail is tapered and the colours of its plumage are very different Its history is totally unknown  V The WHITE COIF or CAYENNE JAY  Corvus Cayanus  Linn and Gmel  Garrulus Cayanensis  Briss  It is nearly of the size of the common Jay only it is taller its bill shorter its tail and wings proportionally longer which gives it a sprightlier air  There are also other differences chiefly in the plumage gray white black and the different  shades of violet constitute all the variety of its colours The gray appears on the bill the legs and the nails the black on the front the sides of the head and the throat the white round the eyes on the crown of the head and on the nape as far as the origin of the neck and also over all the lower part of the body the violet lighter on the back and wings and deeper on the tail which is tipped with white and composed of twelve quills of which the two middle ones are rather longer than those towards the side  The small black feathers on its front are short and scarce flexible part of them project over the nostrils and the rest are reflected so as to form a sort of ruffled crest  Specific character  It is somewhat violet white below its neck and front black its tail white at the tip  It is thirteen inches long    VI The GARLU or the YELLOWBELLIED JAY of CAYENNE  Corvus Flavus  Gmel  This also is a native of Cayenne but of all the Jays it is the one which has the shortest wings we should therefore be the farthest from  suspecting that it crossed the Atlantic especially as it can subsist only in warm climates Its feet are short and slender I can add nothing with respect to its colours but what the sight of the figure will suggest and with respect to its habits we are totally ignorant We know not even whether like the other Jays it can erect the crown feathers It is a new species  Specific character  Above it is duskygreenish below yellow its chin and eyelids white its wings and tail of a duskyblush colour  It is nine inches long    VII The BLUE JAY of NORTHAMERICA  Corvus Cristatus  Linn and Gmel  Garrulus Canadensis Coeruleus  Briss  Pica Glandaria Cristata  Klein  The Blue Jay  Catesby Edw Penn and Lath  This bird is noted for the fine blue colour of its plumage which with a slight intermixture of white black and purple is spread over all the upper part of its body from the crown of the head to the extremity of the tail  Its throat is white with a tint of red under it is a kind of black gorget and still lower a reddish zone which melts by degrees into the gray and white that predominate in the lower part of the body The feathers on the crown  of the head are long and the bird raises them at pleasure like a crest which is larger and more beautiful than in our Jay this is terminated on the front by a kind of black fillet which stretching on both sides over a white ground as far as the nape joins the branches of the gorget This fillet is divided from the bottom of the upper mandible by a white line formed by the small feathers which cover the nostrils  The tail is almost as long as the bird itself and consists of twelve staged quills  Catesby remarks that the American Jay has the same petulance in its actions as the common Jay that its notes are less disagreeable and that the female is distinguished from the male by its duller colours Admitting this Catesby's figure must represent a female and that of Edwards a male but the age of the bird must also affect the vivacity and perfection of its colours  This Jay is brought from Carolina and Canada and in those countries it must be very common for many are sent to Europe  Specific character  The coverts of the wings are marked by black transverse lines its body is coerulean its collar black  It is twelve inches long It feeds on fruits and berries of which it generally wastes more than it consumes It lays in the month of May five or six eggs of dusky olive with ferruginous spots It remains in the country the whole year It is well known to sailors by the name of  Blue Bird  and frequently brought to Britain from Virginia and the Carolinas    N  o  THE NUT CRACKER  The NUTCRACKER  This bird was unknown to the Greeks tho' Gesner has formed a compound Greek name  from  a  nut  and    to kill  in Latin it is called  Nucifraga    Ossifragus  and by some  Turda Saxatilis    Pica Abietum Guttata  StoneThrush or speckled PineMagpie in Turkish  Garga  in German  Nussbretscher    Nuskraehe  NutCrow  Tannen heyer  FirJay  Steinheyer    Waldstarl  WoodStare  Turkischerholstschreyer  the Turkish Forestbrawler in Polish  Klesk    Grabulusk  in Russian  Kostohryz  in French  Pie Grivelée    Le CaisseNoix  Buff  Corvus Caryocatactes  Linn and Gmel  Nucifraga  Briss  Caryocatactes  Gesner Ray and Will  Merula Saxatilis  Aldrov  THIS bird is distinguished from the jays and magpies by the shape of its bill which is straighter blunter and composed of two unequal pieces Its instinct is also different for it prefers the residence of high mountains and its disposition is not so much tinctured with cunning and suspicion However it is closely related to these two species of birds and most authors not fettered by their systems have ranged it with the jays and magpies and even with the jackdaws  Gesner Turner Klein Willughby Linnaeus Frisch  which it is well known bear a great analogy to the magpies but it is  asserted that it chatters more than any of these  Klein distinguishes two varieties of the Nutcracker the one speckled like the stare has a strong angular bill a long forked tongue as in all the magpies the other is of inferior size and its bill for he says nothing of the plumage is more slender and rounder composed of two unequal mandibles the upper of which is the longer and its tongue divided deeply very short and almost lost in the throat  According to Willughby the tongue seems not capable of reaching farther than the corners of the mouth while the bill is closed because in that situation the cavity of the palate which usually corresponds to the tongue is then filled by a protuberant ridge of the lower jaw which here fits this cavity He adds that the bottom of the palate and the sides of the chaps are roughened with little points    According to the same author these two birds eat hazelnuts but the former breaks them and the latter pierces them they feed also on acorns wild berries the kernels of pinetops which they pluck dextrously and even insects And lastly like the jays the magpies and the jackdaws they conceal what they cannot consume  Besides the brilliancy of the plumage the Nutcracker is remarkable for the triangular white spots which are spread over its whole body except the head These spots are smaller on the  upper part and broader on the breast their effect is the greater as they are contrasted with the brown ground  These birds are most attached as I have observed above to mountainous situations They are common in Auvergne Savoy Lorraine FrancheCompté Switzerland the Bergamasque in Austria in the mountains which are covered with forests of pines They also occur in Sweden though only in the southern parts of that country  It inhabits Smoland and rarely occurs elsewhere  Fauna Suecica  Gerini remarks that it is never seen in Tuscany  The people in Germany call them Turkey birds Italian birds African birds which language means no more than that they are foreign  Frisch    Though the Nutcrackers are not birds of passage they fly sometimes from the mountains to the plains Frisch says that flocks of them are often observed to accompany other birds into different parts of Germany especially where there are pine forests But in great flights of them entered France particularly Burgundy where there are few pines they were so fatigued on their arrival that they suffered themselves to be caught by the hand  A skilful ornithologist of the town of Sarbourg Dr Lottinger who is well acquainted with the birds of Lorraine and to whom I am indebted for many facts relating to their instincts their habits and their migrations informs me that in the same year flights so numerous of Nutcrackers passed into Lorraine that the woods and the fields were filled with them Their stay lasted the whole month of October and hunger had so much enfeebled them that they were knocked down with sticks The same observer adds that these birds appeared again in but in smaller numbers that their passage is always in autumn and that six or nine years commonly intervene between their visits This must be restricted to Lorraine for in France especially in Burgundy the Nutcrackers appear much seldomer  One  was killed in the month of October that same year at Mostyn in Flintshire which was supposed to have come from Germany We may remark that that year was exceedingly arid and hot which must have dried up most of the springs and have much affected those fruits on which the Nutcrackers usually feed Besides as on their arrival they seemed to be famished and were caught by all sorts of baits it is probable that they were constrained to abandon their retreats for want of subsistence  One of the reasons it is said why the Nutcrackers do not settle and breed in the inviting climates is the perpetual war waged against them by the proprietors of the woods for the injuries which they commit on the large trees by piercing the trunks like the woodpeckers  Salerne  Part of them is soon destroyed and the rest is forced to seek an asylum in the desert unprotected forests  Nor is this the only circumstance in which they resemble the Woodpeckers they nestle like them in the holes of trees which perhaps they themselves have formed for the middle quills of the tail are also worn near the end  Linnaeus  which shews that they as well as the woodpeckers clamber upon trees In short Nature seems to have placed the Nutcrackers between the Woodpeckers and the Jays and it is singular that Willughby has given them this precise arrangement in his Ornithology though his description suggests no relation between these species  The iris is of a hazelcolour the bill the feet and the nails black the nostrils round shaded with whitish feathers straight stiff and projecting the feathers of the wing and tail are blackish without spots but only terminated for the most part with white though there are some varieties in the different individuals and in the different descriptions which seems to confirm the opinion of Klein with regard to the two races or varieties which he admits into the species of the Nutcrackers  We cannot find in writers of natural history any details with regard to their laying their incubation the training of their young the duration of their life c for they haunt  inaccessible spots where they enjoy undisturbed safety and felicity  Specific character of the Nutcracker  CorvusCaryocatactes  LINN  It is dusky dotted with white its wings and tail black the tailquills white at the tip the middle ones worn at the tip  It is thirteen inches long It inhabits Europe and the north of Asia but very seldom appears in Great Britain  The ROLLERS  Les Rolliers  Buff  IF we regard the European Roller as the type of the genus and rest its distinctive character not upon one or two superficial qualities but upon the general combination of its properties we shall be obliged to make considerable changes in the enumeration given by Brisson  On this principle which appears to be well founded I reduce The European Roller and the ShagaRag of Barbary mentioned by Dr Shaw to the same species I range together the Abyssinian and the Senegal Roller with which Brisson seems not to have been acquainted I class together the Roller of Mindanao that of Angola which Brisson makes his twelfth and thirteenth Rollers and that of Goa which Brisson does not mention I exclude from the genus of Rollers the fifth species of Brisson or the Chinese Roller because it is a different bird and is much more like the Cayenne  Grivert  with which I shall class it I shall place both of them under the common name of  Rolle  before the Rollers because  they appear to form the intermediate shade between the Jays and the Rollers I transfer the Roller of the Antilles to the Jays which is the sixth species of Brisson I leave among the birds of prey the  Ytzquauhtli  of which Brisson has made his seventh species of Roller by the name of  the Roller of New Spain  the history of which has been given after the Eagles In fact according to Fernandez who is the original author and even according to Seba who copies him it is really a bird of prey devouring hares and rabbits and consequently is very different from the Rollers Fernandez subjoins that it is proper for falconry and that its bulk is equal to that of a ram I omit also the  Hoxetot  or Yellow Roller of Brisson which I have ranged after the magpies as being more related to that kind than to any other Lastly I exclude the  Ococolin  of Fernandez for the reasons already stated in the article of the quails nor can I admit the  Ococolin  of Seba which is very different from that of Fernandez though it bears the same name for it is of the size of a crow its bill is thick and short its toes and nails very long its eyes encircled with red  papillae  c In short after this reduction and the addition of the new species or varieties which have been hitherto unknown the genus will consist of two species of  Rolles  and seven of Rollers with their varieties  The CHINESE ROLLE  Coracias Sinensis  Gmel  Galgalus Sinensis  Briss  The Chinese Roller  Lath  This bird has wide nostrils like the Rollers and a bill resembling theirs but are these characters sufficient to justify its classification with the Rollers or are these not counterbalanced by more numerous and more important differences Its feet are longer its wings shorter and consist of a smaller number of quills and these differently proportioned  In the Chinese  Rolle  the wing consists of eighteen quills of which the first is very short and the fifth longer than the rest as in the Jay whereas the wing of the Roller includes twentythree quills of which the second is the longest  its tail is tapered and its crest is precisely like that of the blue Canada Jay These circumstances but particularly the length of its wings have induced me to assign it a place between the Jays and the Rollers  Specific character  It is green below yellowishwhite the tail wedgeshaped the tip white  It is eleven inches and a half long    The GRIVERT or CAYENNE ROLLE  Coracias Cayanensis  Gmel  The Cayenne Roller  Lath  This bird ought not to be separated from the preceding which it is entirely like except because it is smaller and the colours of its plumage different With regard to the instincts and habits of these birds we can draw no comparison though the resemblance in their exterior properties seems to denote a radical connection  Specific character  It is of a dusky green below dirty white the eyebrows white the upper part of the throat striated both ways with black the tail wedgeshaped  It is nine inches long    The GARRULOUS ROLLER  Gesner was told that the German name  Roller  was expressive of its cry Schwenckfeld says the same of  Rache  One of them must be mistaken and I am inclined to think that it is Gesner for the name  Rache  adopted by Schwenckfeld is more analogous with those given to this bird in different countries and which are probably derived from its cry In German  GalgenRegel    HalkRegel    GalsKregel    Racher  in Polish  Kraska  in Swedish  SpanskKraska  It has also the following names in Germany  HeidenElster    KugelElster    MandelKrae    DeutscherPapagey    BirkHeher  i e HeathMagpie BallMagpie AlmondCrow German Popinjay BirchJay    Le Rollier d'Europe  Buff  CoraciasGarrula  Linn and Gmel  Galgulus  Briss  CoraciasCoerulea  Gerini  GarrulusCoeruleus  Frisch  The names of  Strasburg Jay    SeaMagpie    BirchMagpie  and  German Parrot  which this  N  o  THE GARRULOUS ROLLER  bird has received in different countries have been applied at random from popular and superficial analogies We need only view the bird or even a good coloured figure of it to be convinced that it is not a parrot though there is a mixture of green and blue in its plumage and a closer examination will inform us that it is neither a magpie nor a jay though it chatters incessantly like these birds  Aldrovandus  Its appearance and port are different its bill is not so thick its legs much shorter in proportion shorter even than the midtoe its wings longer and its tail entirely of a different shape the two outer quills projecting more than half an inch at least in some individuals beyond the six intermediate ones which are all equal in length It has also a kind of wart behind the eye and the eye itself is surrounded with a ring of yellow naked skin  Edwards    The appellation of Strasburg Jay is still more absurd for M Hermann professor of medicine and natural history in that city writes me  The Rollers are so rare here that scarcely three or four stragglers are seen in the course of twenty years  One of these had been sent to Gesner who not being acquainted with the fact denominated it the  Strasburg Jay  Besides it is a bird of passage and performs its migrations regularly once ayear in the months of May and September  Extract of a Letter from the Commander Godeheu of Riville on the Migration of Birds tom iii  Memoires presentés à ' Academie Royale des Sciences  p  yet it is not so common as the magpie or the jay It is found in Sweden  Fauna Suecica  No  and in Africa  Shaw's Travels  but we must not suppose it settled in the intermediate regions It is unknown in many parts of Germany  Frisch  France and Switzerland  It was caught with us in the middle of August and not known  GESNER  de Avibus  c We may therefore conclude that in its passage it moves only in a narrow zone from Smoland and Scania to Africa There are even points enow given to mark nearly its tract through Saxony Franconia Suabia Bavaria Tirol Italy  I remember to have seen it once at Bologna  Id  Sicily  We saw them for sale on the stalls at Messina in Sicily  WILLUGHBY  and lastly the island of Malta  We saw them exposed for sale in the market of Malta  Id  Also Commander Godeheu's letter  which is a sort of general rendezvous for all  the birds that cross the Mediterranean The one described by Edwards was killed on the rock of Gibraltar whence it could wing its lofty  Gesner  course to the African shore It is also seen sometimes in the vicinity of Strasburg as we have already noticed and even in Lorraine and in the heart of France  BRISSON  M Lottinger informs me that in Lorraine these birds pass more seldom than the Nutcrackers and in smaller numbers He adds that they are never seen but in autumn no more than the Nutcrackers and that in one was wounded in the neighbourhood of Sarrebourg which notwithstanding lived thirteen or fourteen days without sustenance  but these are probably young ones which stray from the main body  The Roller is more wild than the jay or the magpie it settles in the thickest and the most solitary woods nor as far as I know has it ever been tamed or taught to speak  Schwenckfeld  Its plumage is beautiful it has an assemblage of the finest shades of blue and green mixed with white and heightened by the contrast of dusky colours  Linnaeus is the only one who says that its back is bloodcoloured  Fauna Suecica  No  Was the subject that he described different from all those described by other naturalists  But a good figure is superior to any description The young do not assume the delicate azure till the second year whereas the jays are decorated with their most beautiful feathers before they leave the nest  The Rollers build when it is in their power on birches and it is only when they cannot find these that they lodge in other trees  Frisch  But in countries where wood is scarce as in the island of Malta and in Africa they form their nest it is said on the ground  A sportsman  says M Godeheu in a letter which I have already quoted  assured me that in the month of June he saw one of these birds issuing from a bank of earth where was a hole as large as the hand and that having dug the spot in the direction of the hole which went horizontally he found at the depth of a foot or thereabouts a nest made of straw and thorns in which were two eggs  This account of the sportsman which would be doubtful if it were single seems confirmed by that of Dr Shaw who speaking of the bird known in Africa under the name of  ShagaRag  says that it makes its nest on the brinks of rivers Notwithstanding I am much afraid that there is some mistake and that the Kingfisher was taken for the Roller on account of the resemblance of its colours  If this be a fact it would follow that the instincts of animals can be modified by situation climate c  Klein says that contrary to what happens in other birds the young Rollers void their excrements in the nest  Ordo Avium  p  and this circumstance has perhaps given rise to the notion that this bird besmears its nest with human ordure as has been alleged of the hoopoe  Schwenckfeld  but this is inconsistent with its lonely sylvan haunt  These birds are often seen in company with the woodpeckers and crows in the tilled  grounds which are in the vicinity of their forests They pick up the small seeds roots and worms which the plough throws to the surface and even the grain that is lately sown When this supply fails them they have recourse to wild berries caterpillars grasshoppers and even frogs  Klein Willughby Schwenckfeld Linnaeus  Schwenckfeld adds that they sometimes devour carrion but this must be during winter and only in cases of absolute want  If they rake among garbage in summer it must be for insects  for they are in general regarded as not carnivorous and Schwenckfeld himself remarks that they are very fat in autumn and then are good eating  Frisch compares their flesh to that of the ringdove  which can hardly be said of birds that feed on garbage  The Roller has long narrow nostrils placed obliquely on the bill near its base and open the tongue is black not forked but ragged at the tip and terminated towards the root by two forked appendices one on each side the palate is green the gullet yellow the ventricle of a saffron colour the intestines about a foot long and the  caeca  twentyseven lines The wings extend twentytwo inches each consisting of twenty quills or according to others of twentythree the second of which is the longest of all Lastly it is observed that  wherever these quills are black on the outside they are blue beneath  Aldrovandus who seems to have been well acquainted with these birds and who lived in a country which they inhabit asserts that the female differs much from the male its bill being thicker and its head neck breast and belly of a chesnut colour bordering on ashgray while the corresponding parts in the male are of the colour of the beryl with different reflections of a duller green I suspect that the two long outside quills of the tail and the warts behind the eyes which appear only in some individuals are the attributes of the male as the spur in the gallinaceous tribe the long tail in the peacocks c  * Willughby Schwenckfeld Brisson  Specific character of the GarrulousRoller  CoraciasGarrula  LINN  It is skyblue its back red its tailquills black  Its eggs are of a pale green with numerous dull spots and of the bulk of a pigeon's It is seldom or never seen in Great Britain  VARIETIES of the ROLLER  Dr Shaw mentions in his Travels a bird of Barbary called by the Arabs  ShagaRag  which is of the bulk and shape of the jay but with a smaller bill and shorter feet  The upper part of the body of this bird is brown the head neck and belly of a light green and on the wings as well as on the tail are spots of a deep blue Dr Shaw adds that it makes its nest on the banks of rivers and that its cry is shrill  This short description agrees so well with our Roller that we cannot doubt but the ShagaRag belongs to the same species and the resemblance which the name bears to most of the German appellations of the Roller derived from its voice adds to the probability  Mr Latham conjectures that the  ShagaRag  is the same with the Variety of the Abyssinian Roller afterwards described    FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE ROLLER  I The ABYSSINIAN ROLLER  Coracias Abyssinica  Gmel  THIS bird is in its plumage much like the European Roller only its colours are more lively and brilliant which must be ascribed to the influence of a drier and hotter climate On the other hand it resembles the Angola Roller by the length of the two side feathers of its tail which project five inches beyond the rest In short this bird seems to occupy a place between the European and Angola Rollers The point of its upper mandible is very hooked It is entirely a new species  VARIETY of the ABYSSINIAN ROLLER  We may consider the Senegal Roller as a variety of that of Abyssinia The chief difference between them is that in the Abyssinian  bird the orange colour of the back does not extend as in that of Senegal so far as the neck and the hind part of the head a difference which would not be sufficient to constitute two distinct species especially as they belong to nearly the same climate as the two lateral quills are double the length of the intermediate ones as in both the wings are shorter than those of the European Roller and lastly as they are alike in the shades the lustre and the distribution of their colours  This is the  Coracias Senegalensis  of Gmelin the  Swallowtailed Indian Roller  of Edwards and the  Senegal Roller  of Latham    II The ANGOLA ROLLER or the MINDANAO ROLLER  These two Rollers resemble each other so exactly that it is impossible to separate them That of Angola is distinguished from the other only by the length of the exterior quills of its tail which is double that of the intermediate ones and by slight variations of colour But differences so minute may be the effect of age of sex or even of moulting and the inspection of our figures nay the descriptions of  Brisson who makes two species of them will confirm our conjecture of the identity of the two species They are both nearly of the bulk of the European Roller have the same general shape its bill somewhat hooked its naked nostrils its short legs its long toes its long wings and even the colours of its plumage though differently distributed they are always blue green and brown which are sometimes distinct sometimes mixed melted together forming many intermediate shades and having various reflections The bluish green or sea green is however spread on the crown of the head the brown more or less intense and more or less greenish covers all the forepart of the body with some tints of violet on the throat and the blue the green and all the shades which arise from their mixture appear on the rump the tail the wings and the belly only the Mindanao Roller has under its breast a kind of orange tincture which is not found in that of Angola  To this opinion it will be objected perhaps that the kingdom of Angola is at a great distance from Bengal and still farther from the Philippines But is it impossible or is it not natural that these birds should be spread through the different parts of the same continent or the neighbouring islands which are connected with it perhaps by the continuation of the same  chain especially in climates so nearly alike Besides we cannot always expect the most scrupulous exactness in those who import the productions of foreign countries and the intercourse of European vessels with the various regions of the globe is so extensive and multiplied that a bird found in the East Indies might have been carried to Guinea and afterwards imported as a native of Africa Admitting this if we ascribe the slight differences between the Roller of Mindanao and that of Angola to the effect of age we must reckon the latter the older or if we impute them to the distinction of sex we must consider it as the male for we know that in the Rollers the fine colours of the feathers do not appear till the second year and it is a general principle that in all birds the male when it differs from the female is distinguished by an exuberance of growth or a superior richness of plumage  Specific character of the Angola Roller which is the  CoraciasCaudata  of Linnaeus and the  Longtailed Roller  of Latham  It is somewhat fulvous below coerulean the neck striated below with pale violet the outmost quills of the tail very long  Specific character of the Mindanao Roller which is the  CoraciasBengalensis  of Gmelin the  Bengal Pie  or  Jay  of Albin and the  Bengal Roller  of Latham  It is somewhat fulvous below coerulean the neck striated beneath with pale violet the tail entire    VARIETY of the ANGOLA  and  MINDANAO ROLLERS  The Royal Cabinet has lately received from Goa a new Roller which is very like that of Mindanao It differs only by its size and by a sort of collar like winelees in colour which grasps only the hind part of the neck a little under the head It has not any more than the Angola Roller the orange cincture of the Mindanao Roller but if in this respect it differs from the latter it is so much the more allied to the former which is certainly of the same species  III The ROLLER of the INDIES  Coracias Orientalis  Gmel  Galgulus Indicus  Briss  The Oriental Roller  Lath  This Roller which is the fourth of Brisson differs less from the preceding in the nature of its colours which are always blue green brown c than in the order of their distribution but in general its plumage is more dusky its bill is also broader at the base more hooked  and of a yellow colour lastly of all the Rollers it has the longest wings  M Sonerat has lately sent to the Royal Cabinet a bird which is almost in every respect like the Indian Roller only its bill is still broader and for this reason it has received the epithet of  largetoadmouthed  but that appellation would better suit the Goatsucker  Specific character  It is green its throat striated with coerulean its tailquills black at the tip It is of the bulk of the jay being ten inches and a half long    N  o  THE MADAGASCAR ROLLER  IV The MADAGASCAR ROLLER  Coracias Madagascariensis  Gmel  This species differs from all the preceding in several properties its bill is thicker at the base its eyes are larger its wings and tail longer though the exterior pupils of the latter do not project beyond the rest lastly the plumage is of an uniform purplebrown excepting only that the bill is yellow the largest quills of the wings black the lower belly of a light blue the tail of the same colour edged at its extremity with a bar of three shades viz purple light blue and dark purple approaching to black It has all the other characters which belong to  the Rollers short feet the edges of the upper mandible scalloped near the point the small feathers which reflect from its base and the naked nostrils c  V The MEXICAN ROLLER  Coracias Mexicanus  Gmel  Galgulus Mexicanus  Briss  This is the Mexican Blackbird of Seba which Brisson makes his eighth Roller It would require the inspection of it to fix its true species for this would be difficult from the short notice given by Seba who is here the original author I place it among the Rollers because I know of no reason to exclude it I therefore follow the opinion of Brisson till more perfect information confirm or destroy the temporary arrangement The colours are different from those which are common in the Rollers The upper part of the body is of a dull gray mixed with a rufous tint and the under of a light gray with some marks of firecolour  Specific character  It is of a grayrufous below and on the wings of a dilute gray mixed with flamecolour  It is much larger than a thrush    VI The PARADISE ROLLER  Oriolus Aureus  Linn and Gmel  Paradisea Aurea  Lath  Ictericus Indicus  Lath  The Golden Bird of Paradise  Edw  I place this bird between the Rollers and the Birds of Paradise as forming the shade which connects these two kinds because it seems to have the shape of the former and to resemble the latter by its smallness and the situation of the eyes under and very near the junction of the mandibles and by a sort of natural velvet which covers the throat and part of the head Besides the two long quills of the tail which sometimes occur in the European Roller and which are much longer in that of Angola is another analogical character that connects the genus of the Roller with that of the Bird of Paradise  The upper part of the body of this bird is of a vivid and brilliant orange the under of a fine yellow it has no black but under the throat on part of the shoulders and on the quills of the tail The feathers which cover the hind part of the neck are long narrow flexible and recline on each side over the lateral parts of the neck and breast  The feet and legs had been torn from the subject described and designed by Edwards as if it had been a real Bird of Paradise and this circumstance probably led that naturalist to refer it to that genus though it has none of the principal characters The quills of the wings were wanting though those of the tail were complete they were as I have said twelve in number and terminated with yellow Edwards suspects that the quills of the wing are also black whether because they are of the same colour with those of the tail or that they were wanting in the individual which he observed for dealers in birds in drying the specimens pluck all the feathers which are of a bad colour to increase the beauty of the plumage  Specific character  It is of a fulvousyellow its bridle the upper part of its throat the primary coverts and the tips of the tailquills black  It is eight inches long    N  o  THE GREATER PARADISE  The GREATER BIRD of PARADISE  In Latin  Apis Indica    Avis Dei    Parvus Pavo    Pavo Indicus    Manucodiata  which the Italians have adopted  Manucodiata Rex    Manucodiata Longa    Hippomanucodiata    Hirundo Ternatensis  in German  LuftVogel  SkyBird  ParadissVogel  in Portuguese  Passaros de Sol  Sparrow of the Sun    L'Oiseau de Paradis  Buff  Paradisea Apoda  Linn and Gmel  Manucodiata  Briss  Paradisea Avis  Clusius Seba Wormius c  THIS species is more famous for the fictitious and imaginary qualities ascribed to it than for any real and remarkable properties The name of the  Bird of Paradise  commonly suggests the idea of a bird which has no feet which flies constantly even in its sleep or at most suspends itself but for a few moments from the branches of trees by means of the long filaments of its tail  Acosta  which copulates in its flight like certain insects and lays and hatches in a way unexampled in nature  To give an air of probability to the relation the male it is alleged has on its back a cavity where the female deposits her eggs and hatches them by means of a corresponding cavity in her  abdomen  and that the sitter might maintain her posture they entwine themselves with their long filaments Others have said that they nestle in the terrestrial paradise and hence their name See  Musaeum Wormianum  p  which lives only on vapours and dews and which has the cavity  of its abdomen entirely filled with fat instead of stomach and intestines  Aldrovandus  which would be quite superfluous since it eats nothing and therefore needs not to digest or to void in short which has no existence but motion no element but air where it is supported as long as it retains breath as fish are buoyed up in water and which never touches the ground till after death  The people of India say that they are always found with their bills pitched into the ground  Navigations aux Terres Australes  tom ii p  In fact their bill must necessarily fall foremost    This monstrous heap of absurdities is only a chain of consequences justly drawn from a radical error that the Bird of Paradise has no legs though it is furnished with even pretty large ones  Barrere who seems on this head to speak only from conjecture asserts that the Birds of Paradise have legs so short and so thickly clothed with feathers to the toes that one should suppose them to have none at all It is thus that trying to explain one mistake he falls into another    The fact  The inhabitants of the Arou islands believe that these birds are hatched with legs but apt to lose them either from disease or old age If this were true it would at once explain and excuse the error See the observations of  J Otto Helbigius  Collect Acad partie Etrang  tom iii p  If what  Olaus Wormius  Musaeum  p  asserts were a fact that each of the toes of this bird has three articulations this singularity would be still greater for in almost all birds the number of joints is different in each toe the hind one having two including that of the nail and of the foretoes the inner having three the midone four and the outer five  is that the Indian merchants who trade with the feathers of this bird or the  fowlers who sell them are accustomed whether for the sake of preserving and transporting the specimens with more ease or perhaps of countenancing an error which is favourable to their interest to dry the bird with its feathers after having previously separated the thighs and extracted the entrails This practice has been so long continued as to have strengthened the prejudice to such a degree that those who first asserted the truth were as usual regarded as unworthy of credit  Antonius Pigafetta falsely ascribes to their legs a palm of length  Aldrovandus  tom i p    The fable that the Bird of Paradise continually flies derived an appearance of probability from the consideration of the quantity of feathers with which it is furnished for besides those common to other birds it has many long feathers which rise on each side between the wing and the thigh and which extending much beyond the true tail and mingling with it form a sort of false tail which many observers have mistaken These  subalar  feathers are what the naturalists term  decomposed  they are very light themselves and form a bunch  almost devoid of weight and aërial they will therefore increase the apparent bulk of the bird  It is said to appear as large as a pigeon though it exceeds not the bulk of a blackbird  diminish its specific gravity and thus assist in supporting it in the air But if the wind be contrary the abundance of plumage will rather obstruct its motion accordingly it is observed that the bird of Paradise avoids the blustering gales  The Arous consist of five islands and these birds inhabit only the middle ones they never appear in the others because being naturally weak they cannot withstand high winds  HELBIGIUS  and commonly settles in countries the least subject to them  These feathers are of the number of forty or fifty on each side of unequal lengths the greater part spread under the true tail and others lie over it without concealing it for their texture is delicately slender and almost transparent which is very difficult to represent in a figure  These feathers are highly esteemed in India and much sought after It is not more than a century since they were employed in Europe for the same purposes as those of the Ostrich and indeed their lightness and brilliancy make them elegant ornaments But the priests of Asia ascribe to them miraculous virtues which give them a new value in the eyes of the vulgar and have procured the bird the appellation of the  Bird of God  Next to this the most remarkable property of the Bird of Paradise is those two long filaments which take their rise above the true tail and extend more than a foot beyond the false tail formed by the subalar feathers These indeed are real filaments only at their middle for at their origin and their termination they are furnished with webs of the ordinary breadth In the females the extremities are narrower which according to Brisson is the only distinction between it and the male  The inhabitants of the country say that the females are smaller than the males according to J Otto Helbigius    The head and throat are covered with a sort of velvet formed by small erect feathers which are short stiff and close those of the breast and back are longer but always silky and soft to the feel They are all of different colours which vary according to the position and the light in which they are viewed  The head is very small in proportion to the body the eyes still smaller and placed very near the opening of the bill Clusius reckons only ten quills in the tail but this assertion was certainly not founded on the examination of a living subject and it is doubtful whether the plumage of a bird brought from so great a distance be entire especially as it is subject to an annual moulting which lasts several months During that time which happens  in the rainy season it lives concealed but in the beginning of August after hatching its feathers are restored and in the months of September and October in which calm weather prevails it flies in flocks like the Stares in Europe  Helbigius    This beautiful bird is not much diffused it is almost entirely confined to that part of Asia which produces the spiceries and especially the islands of Arou It is known also in the part of New Guinea opposite to these islands but the name which it there receives  BurungArou  seems to indicate its natal soil  Since warm regions of spices alone are proper for the Bird of Paradise it probably subsists on some aromatic productions  Tavernier remarks that the Paradise Bird is very fond of nutmegs and that it resorts to eat them in the season that it passes in flocks like those which we observe of the thrushes in the time of vintage and that they are intoxicated by the nutmegs and drop down  Voyage des Indes  tom iii p  at least it does not live solely on dew J Otto Helbigius who travelled into India tells us that it feeds on red berries which grow on a very tall tree Linnaeus says that it subsists on large butterflies  Systema Naturae  Edit  x p  and Bontius that it sometimes preys on small birds Its ordinary haunt is the woods where it perches on the trees and the Indians watch it in slender huts which they  attach to the branches and shoot it with their arrows of reeds  Some open the belly with a knife as soon as they drop and having detached the entrails with a part of the flesh they introduce into the cavity a redhot iron after which they dry the bird in the chimney and sell it for a low price to the merchants  HELBIGIUS  It flies like the swallow whence it has been called the  Ternateswallow  Bontius  though others say that its shape indeed resembles the swallow but that it flies higher and always soars in the aërial regions  Navig aux Terres Austr  tom ii p    Though Marcgrave ranges it among the birds of Brazil there is no reason to suppose that it exists in America at least no European vessels have ever imported it from thence Besides that naturalist does not as usual mention the name which it receives in the language of the Brazilians and a bird clothed in such delicate swelling plumage could not traverse the wide expanse of ocean which divides the equatorial parts of the two continents  The ancients seem to have been totally unacquainted with the Bird of Paradise no mention is ever made of its rich decorations Belon pretends that it was the phoenix of antiquity but his opinion is founded on the fabulous qualities of both  It has a golden brilliancy about its neck its other parts are purple  says Pliny speaking of the Phoenix then he adds  no person ever saw it feed  Lib x z  The phoenix too appeared  in Arabia and Egypt while the Bird of Paradise has remained always attached to the Oriental parts of Asia which were very little known to the ancients  Clusius mentions on the authority of some mariners who themselves learned the fact from report that there are two kinds of this bird the one large and beautiful which inhabits the islands of Arou the other inferior to it in size and elegance which is settled in the country of the Papous next Gilolo  J Otto Helbigius speaks of the species which is found in New Guinea as not having in its tail the two long filaments which appear in that of the species of the Arou islands  Helbigius who heard the same in the islands of Arou adds that the Birds of Paradise of New Guinea or of the Papous differ from those of Arou not only in point of size but also in the colours of the plumage which is white and yellowish I should regard these authorities as suspicious and insufficient to found any general conclusion The dried specimens indeed which are brought to Europe present great diversity of appearance in size in the number and position of the feathers in the colours of the plumage c But in such mutilated and imperfect preparations it is impossible to decide what must be ascribed to the effect of age of sex of season of climate and of other accidental causes Besides the Birds of Paradise  being very expensive articles of commerce many other birds with long tails and an elegant plumage have been passed on the credulity of the public and the legs and thighs pulled off to conceal the fraud and enhance the price We have already had an example in the Paradise Roller mentioned by Edwards on which the honours of mutilation had been conferred I have myself seen several paroquets promerops and other birds which had been thus treated and many instances are to be found in Aldrovandus and Seba and it is very common to disfigure the real Birds of Paradise with a view to add to their value I shall therefore take notice only of two principal species of these birds without venturing to vouch for the accuracy of that division till new observations illustrate the matter  Specific character of the  Paradisea Apoda  of LINNAEUS  The feathers on the flanks are longer than the body the two middle tailquills long and hairy    The MANUCODE  Paradisea Regia  Gmel  Manucodiata Minor  Briss  Rex Avium Paradisaearum  Gaza Seba Clusius c  The King's Bird  Forrest  The King Paradise Bird  Lath  I ADOPT this name from the Indian appellation  Manucodiata  which signifies  Bird of God  It is usually called  the King of the Birds of Paradise  but this appellation is drawn from fabulous accounts Clusius was informed by the mariners from a tradition which prevailed in the East that each of the two species of the Birds of Paradise had its leader whose imperial mandates were received with submissive obedience by a numerous train of subjects that his majesty always flew above the flock and issued orders for inspecting and tasting the springs where they might drink with safety c  This may allude to the method by which the people of India sometimes take whole flocks of birds by poisoning the fountains to which they resort and drink  This ridiculous fable is what alone consoles Nieremberg for the loss of the multitude of vulgar opinions which Clusius has erased from the history of birds and this by the  N  o  THE KING PARADISE  way may serve to fix our idea of that compiler's judgment  The King Bird of Paradise resembles much the rest Like them his head is small his eyes still smaller placed near the corner of the opening of the bill his feet pretty long and firm the colours of his plumage glossy the two filaments of his tail nearly similar except that they are shorter and their extremity which is furnished with webs forms a curl by rolling into itself and is ornamented with spangles resembling in miniature those of the peacock  Collection Academique  tom iii  Part Etran  p  He also has beneath the wing on each side a bunch of seven or eight feathers which are longer than in most birds but not so long as those of the Bird of Paradise and of a different shape for they are edged through their whole extent with webs of adhering filaments The Manucode is smaller the bill white and long in proportion the wings are also longer the tail shorter and the nostrils are covered with feathers  Clusius counted only thirteen quills in each wing and seven or eight in the tail but he did not consider that in a dried specimen these might be complete The same author remarks as a singularity that in some the two filaments of the tail cross each other though this might  often happen from accident considering their flexibility and their length  Specific character of the  Paradisea Regia  of Linnaeus  The two middle tailquills are threadlike their tip of a crescentshape and feathery    The MAGNIFICENT BIRD OF PARADISE  This bird bears some relation to the  ManucodiataCirrhata  of Aldrovandus The latter has a similar tuft formed in the same way of unwebbed feathers but which appears longer and its bill and tail are much longer    Le Magnifique de la Nouvelle Guinée  ou  Le Manucode à Bouquets  Buff  Paradisea Magnifica  Gmel  The two tufts  bouquets  which I regard as the distinctive character of this bird appear behind the neck and at its origin The first consists of several narrow feathers of a yellow colour marked near the point with a small black spot and which instead of lying flat as ordinary stand erect those near the head at right angles and the succeeding ones with smaller inclinations  Under the first tuft we perceive a second which is larger but not so much raised and more reclined it is composed of long detached filaments which sprout from very short shafts and of which fifteen or twenty join together  forming strawcoloured feathers These feathers seem to be cut square at the end and make angles more or less acute with the plane of the shoulders  This second tuft is bounded on the right and left by common feathers variegated with brown and orange and is terminated behind by a reddish and shining brown spot of a triangular shape with the vertex turned towards the tail and the filaments of the feathers loose and decomposed as in the second tuft  Another characteristic feature of this bird is the two filaments of the tail which are about a foot long and a line broad and of a blue colour changing into a lucid green and taking their origin above the tail So far they much resemble the filaments of the preceding species but are of a different form for they do not end in a point and are furnished with webs on the middle only of the inner side  The middle of the neck and breast is marked from the throat by a row of very short feathers displaying a series of small transverse lines which are alternately of a fine light green changing into blue and of a deep duckgreen  Brown is the prevailing colour on the lower belly the rump and the tail rusty yellow is that of the quills the wings and of their coverts  but the quills have more than one brown spot at their extremity at least this is the case in the specimen preserved in the Royal Cabinet for it may be proper to mention that the long quills of the wings as well as the feet have been removed  I know not whether the individual observed by Aldrovandus had the number of wingquills very complete but this author says that these quills were of a blackish colour    This bird is rather larger than the preceding its bill is similar and the feathers of the front extend over the nostrils which they partly cover this is inconsistent with the character that has been established of these birds by one of our most intelligent ornithologists  The feathers at the base of the bill turned back and leaving the nostrils bare  BRISSON    The feathers of the head are short straight close and very soft to the touch They form a sort of velvet of a changing colour as in almost all the Birds of Paradise and of a brownish ground The throat is also covered with velvet feathers but these are black with goldengreen reflections  Specific character of the  Paradisea Magnifica    It is scarlet above the upper part of its throat green with golden crescents the neck bearing a bunch of yellow feathers  The BLACK MANUCODE of NEW GUINEA called the SUPERB  Paradisea Superba  Gmel  The Superb Paradise Bird  Lath  The predominant colour of the plumage of this bird is a rich velvet black decorated under the neck with reflections of deep violet Its head breast and the hind part of its neck are brilliant with the variable shades of a fine green the rest is entirely black not even excepting the bill  I place this bird immediately after the Birds of Paradise though it wants the filaments of the tail but we may suppose that moulting or some accidental cause is the reason of this defect for in other respects it resembles these birds not only in its general shape and in that of its bill but is also related by the identity of climate by the richness of its colours and a certain superabundance or luxuriancy of feathers which is peculiar to the Birds of Paradise for there are two small tufts of black feathers which cover the nostrils and two other bunches of the same colour but much longer and directed to the opposite extremity These rise on the shoulders and spreading more or less over the back but always bent backwards form a  sort of wings which extend almost to the extremity of the true when these are closed  We must add that these feathers are of unequal lengths and that those of the anterior surface of the neck and the sides of the breast are very long and narrow  Specific character of the  Paradisea Superba    It is somewhat crested with a goldgreen below it is a lively green the upper part of the throat violet its wings black its tail blue and shining  The SIFILET or MANUCODE with Six Filaments  Paradisea Aurea  Gmel  The Goldbreasted Bird of Paradise  If we adopt the filaments as the specific character of the Manucodes the present is entitled to be ranged at their head for instead of two it has six and of these not one rises on the back but all of them take their origin from the head three on each side They are half a foot long and reflect backwards They have no webs but at their extremity for the space of six lines and these are black and pretty long  Besides these filaments this bird has two properties which belong to the Bird of Paradise luxuriancy of feathers and richness of colours  The luxuriancy of feathers consists In a sort of tuft composed of stiff narrow feathers and which rises at the base of the upper mandible In the length of the feathers of the belly and of the abdomen which is four inches or more one part of these feathers extending directly conceals the underside of the tail while another part rising obliquely on each side covers the upper surface of the tail as far as the third of its length and all of them correspond to the subalar feathers of the Bird of Paradise and of the Manucode  With regard to the plumage the most brilliant colours appear on the neck behind it is goldgreen and bronze violet before topazgold reflections which wanton in all the shades of green and derive new lustre from the contrast with the darkness of the contiguous parts for the head is black changing into a deep violet and the rest of the body is brown inclining to black and with reflections of the same deep violet  The bill of this bird is nearly the same as in the Birds of Paradise the only difference is that its upper ridge is angular and sharp while in most of the other kinds it is rounded  Nothing can be said with respect to the feet and the wings because they were extirpated in the subject from which this description is drawn a practice which as we have remarked  is usual with the Indian hunters or merchants  Specific character of the  Paradisea Aurea    It is crusted with black the top the cheeks and the upper part of its throat are glistening violet the rest of the throat the breast and the spot on the neck goldgreen  The CALYBE' of NEW GUINEA  The name  Calybé  or Calybete was given by Daubenton the younger to express the chief colour of its plumage which is a bronzed steel To the same gentleman we owe the elements of the descriptions of these four new species    Paradisea Viridis  Gmel  The Blue Green Paradise Bird  Lath  If this bird has not the luxuriant plumage of the Paradise tribe it has at least the rich colours and the peculiar softness of texture  Its head is covered with a beautiful blue velvet changing into green and exhibiting the reflections of the beryl The neck is clothed with a longer shag but which dazzles with the same colours except that each feather being of a shining black in the middle of a green changing into blue only at the edges there result waving shades which play still more than those of the head The back the rump the tail and the belly are blue like polished steel and with very brilliant reflections  The small velvet feathers on its forehead project forwards as far as the nostrils which are deeper than in the preceding kinds The bill is also longer and thicker but it is of the same shape and its edges are scalloped in the same manner near the point Six quills only are reckoned in the tail but probably it was not entire  In the subject on which this description is founded as well as those of the three preceding descriptions a stick was passed through their whole length and projected two or three inches out of the bill  They were brought from India by M Sonnerat correspondent of the king's cabinet of natural history  In that simple way and by extirpating the feathers which would spoil the effect the Indians can in an instant form an elegant sort of plume with any small bird which they meet But the specimens are thus deranged and their proportions altered On this account it was difficult to discover in the Calybé the insertion of the wings insomuch that credulity might have asserted that this bird had neither feet nor wings  The Calybé differs from the Manucodes more than the preceding for this reason I have ranged it in the last place and bestowed on it a particular name  Specific character of the  Paradisea Viridis    It is seagreen its back belly rump and tail steelcoloured  It is sixteen inches long    The OXPECKER  Le PiqueBoeuf  Buff  Buphaga Africana  Linn and Gmel  Buphaga  Briss  The African Beefeater  Lath  BRISSON is the first who has described this little bird which Adanson brought from Senegal It is scarcely larger than the crested lark and its wings extend only fourteen inches Its plumage has nothing remarkable in general a grayish brown prevails on the upper part of the body and grayish yellow on the under The bill is not of an invariable colour in some individuals it is entirely brown in others red at the point and yellow at the base in all it is nearly of a quadrangular shape and the points of the two mandibles are reflected in a contrary direction The tail is tapered in steps and a singular circumstance is observed that the twelve quills of which it consists are all pointed Lastly the first  phalanx  of the exterior toe is closely connected to that of the midtoe  This bird is very fond of certain worms or the  larvae  of insects which lodge under the epidermis in oxen It alights on the backs of these animals and pierces their skin with its bill to extract these worms and hence its name  N  o  THE AFRICAN BEEFEATER  The COMMON STARE  In Greek  whence the name for Granite  the spotted surface of that stone resembling the plumage of the Stare it had also the appellations      or  in Latin  Sturnus  or  Sturnellus  in Hebrew  Sarsir  or  Zezir

Flemish  Spreuve    Sprue  in Polish  Szpak    Spatzek    Szpaczieck    Skorzek    L'Etourneau  Buff  Sturnus Vulgaris  Linn Gmel Scop Kram c  Sturnus  Gesner Belon Aldrov Briss c  The Stare  or  Starling  Will Ray Sibb Alb Penn c  FEW birds are so generally known especially in the temperate climates as the Stare for as it is a constant resident of the district where it settles  In the colder countries however such as Sweden and Switzerland it is migratory  It descends after the middle of summer into the low lands of Scania  says  Linnaeus  Fauna Suecica  p    when they leave our country  says  Gesner  de Avibus  p  and as it can be trained in the domestic state its habits have been observed whether when subjected to restraint or ranging without controul  The Blackbird is that of all the feathered race which the Stare resembles the most their  young can hardly be distinguished  BELON  So exact is the resemblance between the young of these two species that I once knew a lawsuit grounded upon it The appellant produced a well trained blackbird and demanded the recompence stipulated for rearing and educating it but the defendant insisted that the young bird which he had committed in charge was a Stare  but after their characters are developed the Stare is found to be distinguished by the streaks and reflections of its plumage by the blunter form of its bill which is broader and not scalloped near the point  Barrere says that the Stare has a quadrangular bill He must at least allow that the angles are very round  and by the greater flatness of its head c But another very remarkable difference and which is derived from a more intimate cause is that the species of the Stare is solitary in Europe whereas the species of the Blackbird are extremely numerous  There is another circumstance also in which these birds are analogous they never change their residence during the winter They only seek for those spots in the tract where they are settled that have the best aspect and are in the neighbourhood of springs  This has probably led Aristotle to say that the Stare conceals itself well in winter  with this difference however that the Blackbirds still continue to live solitary whereas the Stares assemble after the breeding season in very numerous flocks these fly in a peculiar manner which would  N  o  THE STARE  seem to be directed by a sort of tactics It is the voice of instinct which incessantly impels the Stares toward the centre of the battalion while the rapidity of their motions hurries them beyond it a sort of vortex is thus formed denser at the middle and rarer near the verge and the collective body performs an uniform circular revolution and at the same time continues to make a progressive advance This mode of flying has its advantages and its inconveniencies The rapacious tribe is disconcerted by the whirling of the Stares alarmed by their noisy cries and deterred by the appearance of order But the danger is increased of falling a prey to the arts of man the birdcatcher fixes a packthread besmeared with birdlime to each foot and thus discharges one or two Stares these mingle in the flock of their companions and in their frequent gyrations and rencounters entangle others and a number of victims after wasting their efforts tumble headlong to the ground  The evening is the time when the Stares assemble in the greatest numbers to provide more effectually against the dangers of the night which they commonly spend among the reeds whither they hasten about the close of the day in a noisy flight  OLINA  He compares the noise of their passage through the air to the rattling of hail  They chatter much in the  evening and morning at the forming and dispersing of their forces are less clamorous during the rest of the day and quite silent during the night  So attached are the Stares to society that they not only join those of their own species but also birds of a different kind In the spring before the breeding season they often associate with the crows and jackdaws and even with the redwings and fieldfares and sometimes with the pigeons  Their loves commence about the end of March Violence decides their choice they continue as noisy as ever their twitter is incessant and to sing and toy seem then their sole occupation The care of the expected progeny succeeds but they are not overanxious in providing for the reception They often take possession of the nest of a woodpecker which often retaliates in its turn When they would construct one for themselves they only heap a few dry leaves some herbage or moss in the hole of a tree or of a wall In this artless bed the female drops five or six eggs of a greenish ashcolour and covers them for the space of eighteen or twentyone days Sometimes she hatches in dovecotes in the roofs of dwellinghouses and even in the holes of rocks on the seacoast as in the Isle of Wight and  in other places  British Zoology  I have sometimes received in the month of May nests which were pretended to belong to the Stare and to be found in trees but as two of them resemble exactly those of the Thrush I suspect that the persons whom I employed wanted to impose on me unless we suppose that the Stare had dispossessed the Thrush and occupied its place In some cases however they make their own nests a skilful observer told me that he has seen several of them on the same tree The young continue long with their mother which would make me doubt the assertion of some authors  It has two or three hatches annually each consisting of four or five young  OLINA  Uccelliera  that the Stare hatches thrice ayear except this relate to warm countries where the progress of incubation and of growth is rapid  The feathers of the Stares are in general long and narrow as Belon describes their colour is at first of a blackishbrown uniform and without streaks or reflections The streaks begin to appear after the first moulting emerging about the end of July on the lower part of the body then on the head and towards the th of August are spread over the upper part of the body I always mean the young Stares which were hatched in the beginning of May  I have remarked that in this first moulting the feathers which surround the base of the  bill dropped almost all at once so that this part was bald during the month of July  I know not why Pliny speaking of the Stares says  But these lose not their feathers  Lib x  as it happens constantly in the rook through the rest of the year I also observed that the bill was almost all yellow on the th of May this soon changed into a horn colour and Belon assures us that in time it becomes orange  In the males the eyes have a larger share of brown or it is more uniform  The female has a little mail in the pupil of the eyes which in the male is entirely black  OLINA  Willughby seems also to allude to this slough on the eye  The irides are hazel the upper part whiter  where he must probably mean the female  the streaks of the plumage more distinct and yellower and the dark colour of the feathers which are not streaked is brightened by more vivid reflections that vary between purple and deep green Besides the male is larger weighing three ounces and a half Salerne adds another distinguished character of the sex is that the tongue is pointed in the male but forked in the female It would appear that Linnaeus had seen it pointed in some individuals and forked in others  Lingua Acutâ  Syst Nat Edit x    Lingua bisidâ  Fauna Suecica  In those which came under my examination it was forked  The Stares live on snails worms and caterpillars especially on those large caterpillars of a  fine green with reddish reflections which appear in the month of June upon the flowers and chiefly upon the roses They feed also on wheat buckwheat millet panic hempseed elderberries olives cherries raisins c It is pretended that the last is what corrects best the natural bitterness of their flesh and that cherries are what they are the fondest of  Schwenckfeld Salerne c Cardan says that to sweeter the flesh of Stares we need only cut off their head as soon as they are killed Albin directs them to be flayed others allege that the mountain Stares are better tasted than those of the plains But these authors can only mean the young birds for the flesh of the old ones is always bitter and unpalatable  and these afford an almost infallible bait for weelnets which are laid among the reeds where they retire in the evenings and in this way an hundred may often be caught in one night but this diversion lasts no longer than the season of cherries  They are fond of following oxen and other large cattle as they feed in the meadows attracted it is said by the insects which flutter round them or by those perhaps which swarm in their dung or in meadows in general From this habit is derived the German name  RinderStaren  They are also accused of feeding on the carcasses that are exposed on gibbets  Aldrovandus  but it is probably in search only of insects I have raised some of these birds and have observed that when bits of raw flesh were offered to  them they fixed on the prey with great avidity If they were presented with the flowercup of a pink containing seed already formed they did not grasp it with their claws and pluck it like the jay but shook it and struck it against the bars in the bottom of the cage till the grains dropped out I remarked also that they drank nearly like the gallinaceous tribe and took great delight in bathing It is probable that one of those which I raised died of cold in consequence of bathing too often during the winter  These birds live seven or eight years or even longer in the domestic state The wild ones cannot be decoyed by the call because they regard not the scream of the owl But besides the contrivance of the limed threads and the weelnets which I have already mentioned a method has been fallen on to take entire families by fixing to the walls and the trees where they lodge pots of earthen ware of a convenient form which the birds often prefer to place their nests in  Olina and Schwenckfeld  Many are also caught by the gin and drawnet In some parts of Italy it is common to employ tame weasels to drag them out of their nests or rather their holes for the artifice of man consists in employing one enslaved race to extend his dominion over the rest  The Stares have the  membrana nictitans  their nostrils are halfsheathed by a membrane the  legs are of a reddish brown  I know not why Willughby says that  the legs are feathered to the toes  I never found this in any of the Stares which I examined  the outer toe is connected to the mid one as far as the first  phalanx  the hind nail is stronger than the rest the gizzard is preceded by a dilatation of the  aesophagus  is a little fleshy and contains sometimes small stones The intestinal tube is twenty inches in length from the one orifice to the other the gallbladder is of the ordinary size the  caeca  very small and placed nearer the anus than is common in birds  In dissecting a young Stare one of those which I had raised I remarked that the contents of the gizzard and of the intestines were entirely black though it had been fed on bread and milk only This circumstance denotes an abundance of black bile and at the same time accounts for the bitterness of the flesh of these birds and the use which has been made of their excrements in the preparation of cosmetics  The Stare can be taught to speak either French German Latin Greek  The young Caesars had a Stare and Nightingales docil in the Greek and Latin languages and which made continual progress and assiduously prattled new phrases of considerable length  PLINY lib x  c and to pronounce phrases of some length Its pliant throat accommodates itself to every inflexion and every accent It can readily articulate the letter R  Scaliger    and acquires a sort of warbling which is much superior to its native song  Sturnus pisitat ore    isitat    pisistrat  It was thus that the Latine expressed the notes of the Stare See the  Author of Philomela    This bird is spread through an extensive range in the ancient continent It is found in Sweden Germany France Italy the Isle of Malta the Cape of Good Hope  Kolben  and every where nearly the same whereas those American birds which have been called Stares present a great diversity of appearance  Specific character of the Stare  Sturnus Vulgaris  LINN  Its bill is yellowish its body black with white points  It is near nine inches long and its alar extent fourteen inches The male weighs three ounces the female somewhat less  VARIETIES of the STARE  Though the Stares retain uniformly the original impression they are not entirely exempted from the tendency to variety in nature but the varieties which occur are always superficial and often confined to individuals The following have been noticed by authors  I The WHITE STARE of Aldrovandus  Sturnus Vulgaris  var Linn and Gmel  Sturnus Albus  Briss  the White Starling  Will  with fleshcoloured legs and a reddish yellow  bill as in the common kind after they have grown old Aldrovandus says that it was taken along with the ordinary Stares and Rzaczynski informs us that in a certain part of Poland  Near Coronovia  it was usual to see a Black and a White Stare rising from the same nest Willughby also speaks of two White Stares which were observed in Cumberland  II The BLACK and WHITE STARETo this variety I refer The Whiteheaded Stare of Aldrovandus  Sturnus Vulgaris  var Linn and Gmel  Sturnus Leucocephalus  Briss  In this bird the head the bill the neck the whole of the under part of the body the coverts of the wings and the two exterior quills of the tail were white the other quills of the tail and all those of the wings were as in the ordinary Stare the white of the head was set off by two small black spots placed above the eyes and the white of the under part of the body was variegated with bluish spots The Pied Stare of Schwenckfeld in which the top of the head the half of the bill next the base the neck the quills of the wing and those of the tail were black and all the rest white The Blackheaded Stare seen by Willughby the rest of the body entirely white  Sturnus Vulgaris  var Linn and Gmel  Sturnus Leucomelas  Briss  the Black and White Starling  Will    III The GREY CINEREOUS STARE of Aldrovandus  Sturnus Vulgaris  var Linn and Gmel  Sturnus Cinereus  Briss  This author is the only person who has seen one of that colour which is nothing but black melted with white It is easy to conceive how these varieties might be multiplied from the different distribution of the black and white and from the numerous shades of gray which result from the different proportions in which the two original colours enter into the mixture  FOREIGN BIRDS RELATED TO THE STARE  I The CAPE STARE or the PIED STARE  Sturnus Capensis  Linn Gmel  THIS African bird resembles in its general shape the Common Stare and the black and white colours of its plumage are distributed as in the Magpie  Were it not that its bill is thicker and longer than in the European Stare we might regard it as merely a variety especially as our Stare is to be met with at the Cape of Good Hope and this variety would coincide with the one already mentioned in which the black and white are distributed in large spots The most remarkable character in this bird is a very large white spot of a round shape placed on each side of the head and which stretches forward to the base of the bill and inclosing the eye shoots into a sort of appendix variegated with black that descends along its neck  This bird is the same with Edwards's Black and White Indian Starling Pl with Albin's  Contra  of Bengal vol iii Pl with Brisson's Cape of Good Hope Stare vol ii p and even with his ninth tropic bird He acknowledges this and rectifies it p of the Supplement and considering the chaos of incomplete description and of mutilated figures which disgraces Natural History he is certainly excusable To avoid confusion therefore it is of the utmost importance to collate the different names which have been bestowed on a bird by different authors and at different times  Specific character of the  Cape Stare    It is blackish the sides of the head and the under part of the body white  The other birds mentioned are considered by Mr Latham as varieties but Gmelin is rather disposed to form them into a new species the  Sturnus Contra  whose character is  dusky with a spot on the eye a stripe on the wing and the belly all white    II The LOUISIANA STARE or the STOURNE  Sturnus Ludovicianus  Linn Gmel  I have applied the name of  Stourne  which is formed from the Latin  Sturnus  to an American bird which though considerably different is allied to our Stare The under part of its body  is gray variegated with brown and the upper is yellow The most characteristic marks of this bird in respect to colour are A blackish plate intermixed with gray at the lower part of the neck and rising distinctly out of the yellow ground Three white bars on its head which rise from the base of the upper mandible and extend as far as the  occiput  the one rests on the top of the head while the two others which are parallel to it stretch on each side over the eyes In general this bird resembles the European Stare by the proportions of its wings and tail and also by the dispersion of these colours in small spots its head is likewise flat but its bill is longer  A correspondent of the Cabinet informs us that Louisiana is much incommoded by clouds of these Stares which would show that their manner of flying resembles that of the European sort But we are not very certain if he means the species of this article  Specific character of the  Louisiana Stare    It is spotted with gray and dusky a line on the head and the eyelids white the upper part of its throat black    III The TOLCANA  Formed from the Mexican name  Tolocatzanatl  which signifies Reedstare    Sturnus Obscurus  Gmel  Sturnus Novae Hispaniae  Briss  The Brownhead Stare  Lath  The short account which Fernandez has given of this bird is not only incomplete but carelessly drawn up for though he says that the Tolcana is in size and figure like the Stare he afterwards adds that it is rather smaller Yet he is the only original author from whom we can obtain information with regard to this bird and on his evidence Brisson has ranged it among the Stares It appears to me however that these two authors adopt very different characters of the Stare Brisson for instance makes it the distinguishing feature of the genus that the bill is straight blunt and convex and Fernandez speaking of a bird of the  Tzanatl  or  Stare  kind mentions that it is short thick and rather hooked and in another place he refers the same bird named  Cacalotototl  to the genus of the Raven which is called  Cacalotl  in the Mexican  language and to that of the Stare  Cacalotototl  or Raven Bird seems to belong to the genus  Tzanatl  of the Stares  This bird has according to Fernandez a black plumage inclining to blue the bill entirely black the iris orange the tail long the flesh bad to eat and no song It loves temperate and warm countries From this short statement it is difficult to decide whether the bird in question be a Raven or a Stare  The arrangement of the  Tolcana  is therefore not determined I have retained its Mexican name without venturing to pronounce whether it is a Stare or not  This bird is like the European Stares fond of places abounding in rushes and aquatic plants Its head is brown and the rest of its plumage black It has no song or even cry In that it partakes of the qualities of many other American birds which are more remarkable for the richness of their plumage than the sweetness of their warble  Specific character of the  Sturnus Obscurus    It is black its head dusky    IV The CACASTOL  The Mexican name is  Caxcaxtototl  it is also called  Hucitzanatl Tzanatl  in the Mexican language corresponds to our Stare    Sturnus Mexicanus  Gmel  Cotinga Mexicana  Briss  The Mexican Stare  Lath  I here range this bird on the very suspicious authority of Fernandez and the analogy which  its name bears in the Mexican language to that of the Stare nor am I acquainted with any European bird to which I can refer it Brisson who conceives it to be a  Cottinga  has been obliged in order to support his preconceptions to reject from the description of Fernandez already too short the words which indicate the lengthened and pointed shape of its bill this shape being really related more closely to the Stare than to the Cottinga Besides the Cacastol is nearly of the bulk of the Stare and like that bird it has a small head and is indifferent food it likewise inhabits the temperate and warm regions It is indeed a bad singer but we have seen that the native notes of the European Stare are not very captivating and if it were carried into America we may presume that its imitation of the harsh music of the forest would soon destroy every harmonious modulation  Specific character of the  Sturnus Mexicanus    It is skyblue variegated with black    V The PIMALOT  This word is formed from the Mexican name  Pitzmalotl    The broad bill of this bird might lead us to suspect that it is not a Stare but if what Fernandez  says be true that its habits and instincts are the same with those of the other Stares we cannot hesitate to infer that it is of an analogous species especially as it generally haunts the coasts of the South Sea lodging probably like the European sort among the aquatic plantsThe Pimalot is rather larger  VI The STARE of TERRA MAGELLANICA or the WHITE RAY  Sturnus Milibaris  Gmel  The Magellanic Stare  Lath  I have given this last name to a bird brought by M Bougainville on account of the white ray which rising on each side near the junction of the mandibles bends under the eye and stretches along the neck This white ray is the more remarkable as it is environed by a deep brown the dark colours prevail on the upper part of the body only the wings and their coverts are edged with yellow The tail is of a full black forked and extending not far beyond the wings which are very long The under side of the body including the throat is of a fine crimson red sprinkled with black on the sides the anterior  part of the wing is also of crimson and not spotted and the same colour appears round the eyes and in the space lying between these and the bill which though blunt as in the Stares and less pointed than that of the Troupiales may be regarded as nearest the shape of the latter If we consider also that the White Ray resembles much the appearance of the Troupiales we may esteem it as intermediate between these two kinds  Specific character of the  Sturnus Milibaris    It is dusky red below    The TROUPIALES  THESE birds as I have just observed are nearly related to the European Stares and often the vulgar and the naturalists have confounded them We may regard them as representing the Stares in the New World their habits are the same except in the mode of building their nests  The American continent is the native region of these birds and of all others that have been classed with them such as the Cassics the Baltimores the Bonanas c and though some are said to belong to the Old World these have really been brought from the New World for instance probably the Troupiale of Senegal called the  CapeMore  Oriolus Textor  Gmel  the Weaver Oriole  Lath  the Bonana of the Cape of Good Hope and all the pretended Troupiales of Madras  I shall exclude from the genus of the Troupiales The four species brought from Madras and which Brisson has borrowed from Ray because the  law of climate  will not admit the supposition and the descriptions are not decisive and the figures so ill executed that they might as well be taken for magpies jays blackbirds loriots and gobemouches c  A skilful ornithologist Mr Edwards is of opinion that the yellow jay and the chop jay of Petiver which Brisson has made his sixth and his fourth Troupiale are only the male and female loriot and that the variegated jay of Madras of the same Petiver which is the fifth Troupiale of Brisson is his yellow Indian Stare and lastly that the crested Troupiale of Madras which is Brisson's seventh species is the same bird with the crested gobemouche of the Cape of Good Hope of the same Brisson  He adds that the two long quills of the tail were wanting in these two individuals They must either have not yet grown or have dropped by moulting or some other accident    I shall exclude the Bengal Troupiale which is Brisson's ninth species since that author has himself perceived that it is his second of the Stare  I shall exclude the Forkedtail Troupiale which is the sixth of Brisson and the Thrush of Seba All that the latter says is that it is much larger than the thrush that its plumage is black its bill yellow the under surface of its tail white the upper and its back shaded by a light tint of blue that its tail is long broad and forked and lastly that excepting the difference in the shape of its tail and in its bulk it is much like the European thrush But in all this I can perceive nothing that relates to a Troupiale and the figure given by Seba and which Brisson reckons  a very bad one no more resembles a Troupiale than it does a Thrush  I shall exclude the Blue Bonana of Madras because on the one hand it is inconsistent with the law of the climate and on the other the figure and description of Ray have nothing which would characterise the Bonana not even the plumage According to that author its head tail and wings are blue but the tail of a brighter tinge the rest of the plumage black or cinereous except the bill and the feet which are rusty  Lastly I shall exclude the India Troupiale not only on account of the difference of climate but for other stronger reasons which before induced me to place it between the Rollers and the Birds of Paradise  Though we have ranged along with the Troupiales the Cassies the Baltimores and the Bonanas these as they have received separate names are distinguished by differences that are sufficiently important to form small subordinate  genera  I am able from the comparison of a number of these birds to assert that the Cassies have the strongest bill next to them the Troupiales and then the Bonanas With respect to the Baltimores their bill is not only smaller than in the rest but it is straighter and of a peculiar shape They seem also to have different instincts I therefore retain their proper names and treat of each separately  The common characters which Brisson ascribes to them are the naked nostrils and the elongated conical form of the bill I have already observed that the upper mandible extends over the cranium or that the tuft instead of making a point makes a considerable reentrantangle a circumstance which sometimes occurs in other species but is most remarkable in the present  The TROUPIALE  Brisson gave this bird the Latin name  Icterus  from its yellow colour for the same reason Scopoli termed  Xanthornus  or yellow bird other authors have called it  Pica    Cissa    Picus  and  Turdus  The savages of Brazil name it  GuiraTangeima  those of Guiana  Yapou  the French colonists  Culjaune  or yellowbottom    Oriolus Ictericus  Gmel  Icterus  Briss  Coracias Xanthornus  Scop  The Yellow and Black Pye  Catesby  The Banana Bird from Jamaica  Albin  The Icteric Oriole  Lath  The most obvious features in the exterior appearance of this bird are its long pointed bill the narrow feathers of its neck and the great variety of its plumage not only three colours enter into it an orangeyellow black and white but these colours seem to multiply by their artful distribution The black is spread over the head the anterior part of the neck the  N  o  THE ICTERIC ORIOLE  middle of the back the tail and the wings the orangeyellow occupies the intervals and all the under part of the body it appears also in the iris  Albin adds that the eye is encircled by a broad bar of blue but he is the only person who has made this remark it was probably an accidental variety  and on the anterior part of the wings the black which prevails through the rest is interrupted by two oblong white spots of which the one is placed at the coverts of the wings the other on their middle quills  The feet and nails are sometimes black sometimes of a leaden colour The bill seems to have no constant colour for it has been observed to be in some white gray  Brisson  in others brown cinereous above  Albin  and blue below and lastly in others black above and brown below  Sloane and Marcgrave    This bird is nine or ten inches long from the point of the bill to the end of the tail and according to Marcgrave its wings extend fourteen inches and its head is very small It is dispersed through the region lying between Carolina and Brazil and through the Caribbean islands It is of the bulk of a blackbird it hops like the magpie and has many of its gestures according to Sloane It has even according to Marcgrave the same cries but Albin asserts that in all its actions it resembles the Stare and adds that sometimes four or five unite to attack a larger bird which after they have killed they devour  orderly each maintaining his rank Sloane an author worthy of credit says that the Troupiales live on insects Yet there is no absolute contradiction for every animal which feeds on the smallest reptile is rapacious and would feed on larger animals if it could do it with safety  These birds must be of a very social disposition since love which divides so many other societies seems on the contrary to knit theirs more closely together They do not separate to accomplish in retirement and secrecy the views of nature a great many pairs are seen on the same tree which is almost always lofty and sequestered constructing their nest laying their eggs hatching and cherishing their infant brood  These nests are of a cylindrical form suspended from the extremity of high branches and waving freely in the air so that the young are continually rocked But some who believe that the birds act from deliberation assert that the parents hang their nest to avoid the attack of certain land animals and especially serpents  The Troupiale is also reckoned very docile and easily subjected to domestic slavery which propensity almost always attends a social temper  Specific character of the  Oriolus Ictericus    Fulvous the head throat back the wingquills and coverts black with a white spot on the wings  The ACOLCHI of SEBA  Contracted for  Acolchichi    Oriolus Novae Hispaniae  Gmel  Icterus Mexicanus  Briss  The Mexican Oriole  Lath  Seba having found this name in Fernandez has according to his way applied it arbitrarily to a bird entirely different from the one meant by that author at least with regard to its plumage and he has again ascribed to the same bird what Fernandez has said of the true  Acolchi  which the Spaniards call  Tordo  or Stare  This false  Acolchi  of Seba has a long yellow bill its head is all black and also its throat the tail and wings are blackish and these are ornamented with small feathers of a golden colour which have a fine effect on the dark ground  Seba reckons his Acolchi an American bird and I know not for what reason Brisson who quotes no authority but Seba subjoins that it is most common in Mexico It is certain that the word  Acolchi  is Mexican but we are not warranted to conclude the same thing of the bird on which Seba bestows it  Specific character of the  Oriolus N Hispaniae    Yellow the head upper part of the throat wingquills and tail black the greater quills of the wings yellow at the tip the lesser all black  The RINGTAILED ORIOLE  Lath  L'Arcen Queue  Buff  Oriolus Annulatus  Gmel  Icterus Caudâ Annulatâ  Briss  Cornix Flava  Klein  Fernandez gives the name of  Oziniscan  to two birds which bear no resemblance and Seba has taken the freedom to apply the same name to a third entirely different from either except in size which is that of the pigeon  The third  Oziniscan  is the Ringtail  ArcenQueue  of this article I give it this name on account of a black arch or crescent with its concavity turned towards the head which appears distinctly on the tail when spread and the more remarkable as this is of a fine yellow colour which is also that of the bill and of the whole body the head and neck are black and the wings of the same colour with a slight tint of yellow  Seba adds that he received many of these birds from America where they are looked upon as ravenous perhaps their habits are the same with those of our Troupiales the figure which Seba gives has a bill somewhat hooked near the point  Specific character of the  Oriolus Annulatus    Yellow the head and neck black the greater coverts of the wings and their quills edged with yellowish the tail blackish and tinged    The JAPACANI  This is the Brazilian name according to Marcgrave    Oriolus Japacani  Gmel  Luscinia pullolutea  Klein  Sloane considers his  Little Yellow and Brown Flycatcher  as the same with the Japacani of Marcgrave but besides the differences of the plumage the Japacani is eight times larger each dimension being double for Sloane's bird is only four inches long and seven over the wings while Marcgrave's is of the bulk of the  Bemptère  which is equal to that of the Stare whose extreme length is seven inches and its alar extent fourteen It would be difficult to refer to the same species two birds especially two wild birds so widely different  The Japacani has a long pointed black bill a little curved its head is blackish its iris of a gold colour the hind part of its neck its back its wings and its rump are variegated with black and light brown its tail is blackish below and marked with white above its breast its belly its legs are variegated with yellow and white with blackish transverse lines its feet brown its nails black and pointed  Marcgrave    Sloane's little bird  Oriolus Brasilianus  Gmel  Icterus Brasiliensis  Briss  Muscicapa e fusco et luteo varia  Sloane  the Brazilian Oriole  Lath  has a round bill almost straight and half an inch long the head and back are of a light brown with some black spots the tail eighteen inches long and of a brown colour as also the wings which have a little white at their tips The orbits the throat the sides of the neck the coverts of the tail yellow the breast of the same colour but with brown marks the belly white the legs brown about fifteen lines long and yellow in the toes  This bird is common in St Jago once the capital of Jamaica it lodges generally in the bushes Its stomach is very muscular and lined with a thin loose insensible membrane Sloane found nothing in the gizzard of the individual which he diffected but he observed that the intestines made a great number of circumvolutions  The same author mentions a variety which differs only because it has less yellow in its plumage  This bird may be reckoned a Troupiale on account of the form of its bill but it is certainly different from the Japacani  Specific character of the  Japacani    It is black and dusky below variegated with white and yellow with transverse black lines the head and tail blackish  Specific character of Sloane's little bird  It is yellow the breast spotted the head and back marked by soft dusky spots the belly white the tail and wings dusky and the latter white at the tips    The XOCHITOL and the COSTOTOL  Oriolus Costototl  Gmel  The New Spain Oriole  Lath  Brisson makes the  Xochitol  of Fernandez the tenth species of his  Troupiale of New Spain  and which the Spanish naturalist considers as only the adult  Costotol  But he takes notice of two Costotols which are pretty much alike but if they differ in some degree we must refer what Fernandez says here to the Costotol of Chap xxviii  If we compare the description of the Xochitol of Chap cxxii to that of Chap xxviii we shall meet with contradictions which it will be difficult to reconcile for is it possible that the Costotol which when so much grown as to be able to sing is only of the size of a Canary bird should afterwards acquire the bulk of a Stare that when young it has the sweet warble of the Goldfinch but after it is adult and received the name of the Xochitol it should have the disagreeable chatter of the Magpie But wide differences also occur in the plumage in the Costotol the head and the under part of the body are yellow while in the Xochitol they are black in the former the wings are yellow  tipped with black in the latter they are variegated with black and white above and cinereous below without a single yellow feather  But all these contradictions will vanish if instead of the Xochitol of Chap cxxii we substitute the Xochitol or Flowery bird of Chap cxxv The size is nearly the same being that of the Sparrow its warble is pleasant like that of the Costotol the yellow of which is mingled with other colours that variegate the plumage of the former they are both an agreeable food The Xochitol resembles in two circumstances the Troupiales it lives upon insects and seeds and hangs its nest from the ends of small branches The only difference which can be remarked between the Xochitol of Chap cxxv and the Costotol is that the latter is found in warm countries only while the former inhabits all climates without distinction But is it not likely that Xochitols go to breed in warm countries where their young or the Costotols remain till they are grown up or are Xochitols and able to accompany their parents into colder climates In the Costotol the plumage is yellow as I have said and the tips of the wings black and in the Xochitol of Chap cxxv the plumage is variegated with pale yellow brown white and blackish  Brisson has indeed made the latter his first  carouge  but as it suspends its nest like the Troupiales we have a decisive reason to range  it with these except we reckon as another Troupiale the Xochitol of Chap cxxii of Fernandez which is of the size of a Stare its breast belly and tail of a saffron colour variegated with a little black its wings variegated with black and white below and cinereous above its head and the rest of its body black it has the chatter of the Magpie and its flesh is good eating  The TOCOLIN  Its true name is  Ococolin  but as I had appropriated it to another bird I have here changed it by prefixing the letter  T  of Troupiale  Oriolus Cinereus  Gmel  Icterus Cinereus  Briss  The Gray Oriole  Lath  Fernandez considered this bird as a Woodpecker on account of its long and pointed bill but this character belongs also to the Troupiales nor can I perceive in the description of Fernandez any other discriminating qualities of the Woodpeckers I shall therefore leave it among the Troupiales where Brisson has placed it  It is of the bulk of a Stare it lives in the woods and nestles on trees Its plumage is  beautifully variegated with yellow and black excepting the back the belly and the feet which are cinereous  The Tocolin is destitute of song but its flesh is good it inhabits Mexico  Specific character of the  Oriolus Cinereus    It is variegated with yellow and black its back thighs and belly cinereous    The COMMANDER  Oriolus Phoeniceus  Linn and Gmel  Icterus Pterophoeniceus  Briss  The Scarletfeathered Indian Bird  Will  The Redwinged Starling  Catesby Alb and Kalm  The Redwinged Oriole  Penn and Lath  This is the true Acolchi of Fernandez It is called the Commander  In Spanish  Commendadoza  on account of a fine red mark on the anterior part of its wings which in some measure resembles the badge of the order of knighthood The effect is here the more striking as it is thrown upon a ground of shining glossy black for that is the general colour not only of its plumage but of its bill feet and nails There are however some slight exceptions the iris is white and the base of the bill is encircled by a narrow ring of red the  bill also inclines sometimes to brown rather than black according to Albin But the real colour of the mark on the wings is not a pure red according to Fernandez but is tarnished with a rufous tint which increases and becomes at last the predominant colour These sometimes separate the red occupying the anterior and the more elevated part of the spot yellow the posterior and lower But is this true with regard to all the individuals or has not that been ascribed to the whole species which is applicable only to the females We are certain that in these the spot on the wings is not of so bright a red besides that distinction the black of their plumage is mixed with gray and they are smaller  The RedWing is nearly of the size and shape of the Stare its extreme length is eight or nine inches and its alar extent thirteen or fourteen it weighs three ounces and a half  These birds inhabit the cold as well as the warm countries They are found in Virginia Carolina Louisiana Mexico c They are peculiar to the New World though one was killed in the environs of London but this had doubtless escaped from its cage They can be easily tamed and taught to speak and they are fond of singing and playing whether they be confined or allowed to run through the house for they are very familiar and lively  The one killed near London was opened in its stomach were found caterpillars beetles and maggots But in America they feed on wheat maize c and are very destructive They fly in numerous flocks and like the Stares of Europe joining other birds equally destructive as the Jamaica Magpies they pour their famished squadrons on the standing crops and sown fields but the havock which they commit is by far greatest in the warm regions and near the seacoast  When the planters fire on these combined flocks birds fall of different kinds and before the piece can be again charged another flight arrives  Catesby informs us that in Carolina and Virginia they always breed among the rushes they interweave the points of these so as to form a sort of roof or shed under which they build their nest and at so proper a height that it can never be reached by the highest floods This construction is very different from that of our first Troupiale and shews a different instinct and therefore proves that it is a distinct species  Fernandez pretends that they nestle on the trees near the plantations Has this species different customs accommodated to the different countries where it is found  The RedWings appear in Louisiana in the winter only but they are then so numerous that three hundred have been sometimes caught in a  single draw of the net For this purpose is used a long and very narrow net of silk in two parts like that for larks  When they intend to spread it  says Le Page Dupratz  they clear a place near the wood and make a kind of path which is smooth and beaten on which they strew a train of rice or other grain and retire to conceal themselves behind a bush where the dragcord is brought When the flocks of RedWings pass over the spot they quickly descry the bait light and are caught in an instant It is necessary to dispatch them it being impossible to collect so many alive  But they are destroyed chiefly as being pernicious birds for though they sometimes grow very fat their flesh is always indifferent eating another point of resemblance to the Stares of Europe  I have seen at Abbé Aubri's a variety of this species in which the head and the upper part of the neck was of a light fulvous colour The rest of its plumage was the same as usual This first variety seems to shew that the bird represented in the  Planches Enluminées  No by the name of  Cayenne Carouge  is a second which differs from the first in wanting the red spots on the wings only for the rest of its plumage is exactly the same the size is nearly alike and the same proportions take place and the difference between the climates is not so great but  that we may suppose a bird could be equally reconciled to both  We need only compare No and Fig No of the  Planches Enluminées  to be convinced that the bird engraved in the latter under the name of  Cayenne Troupiale  is only a second variety of the species of No under the name of  Redwinged Troupiales of Louisiana  which is the subject of the present article It is nearly the same in size shape and in the kind and distribution of the colours except that in No the red tinges not only the anterior part of the wings but is spread over the throat the origin of the neck a portion of the belly and even the iris  If we next compare this bird No with the one represented No under the name of  Guiana Troupiale  we shall perceive that the latter is a variety of the former arising from the difference of age or sex All the colours are fainter the red feathers are edged with white and the black or blackish with light gray so that the figure of each feather is distinctly marked and the bird looks as if it were covered with scales But the distribution of the colours is the same the bulk the same the climate the same c It is impossible to discover so many relations subsisting between birds of different species  I am informed that these frequent the Savannas in the island of Cayenne and commonly lodge in the bushes and that some people give them the name of  Cardinal  Specific character of the  Oriolus Phoeniceus    It is black the coverts of the wings fulvous  In North America it is sometimes called the  Swamp BlackBird  They appear in NewYork about April and retire in October to the South In some of the colonies a premium of threepence the dozen was offered for destroying them and several farmers had the precaution to steep their Indian corn in a decoction of white hellebore before they sowed it Their nest is suspended among the bushes and reeds in sequestered swamps it is strong covered externally with plastered broad grass and lined thickly with bent The eggs are white with scattered black streaks    The BLACK TROUPIALE  Oriolus Niger  Gmel  Icterus Niger  Briss  Cornix parva profunde nigra  Klein  The Black Oriole  Penn and Lath  The dark colour of this bird has procured it the names of Crow Blackbird and DawBut this is not so deep nor so uniform as has been alleged the plumage in certain positions is of a black changing with greenish reflexions especially on the head the upper part of the body the tail and the wings  It is of the size of a Blackbird being ten inches long and fifteen or sixteen across the  wings which when closed reach to the middle of the tail this is four inches and a half in length tapered and consisting of twelve quills The bill is more than an inch and the midtoe is longer than the leg or rather the  tarsus  This bird is settled in St Domingo and is very common in some parts of Jamaica particularly between Spanishtown and Passagefort Its stomach is muscular and generally contains caterpillars and other insects  The specific character of the  Oriolus Niger  is  That it is entirely black  It inhabits also the whole extent of North America They arrive at Hudson's Bay in June and sing sweetly till their incubation during which they only make a sort of chucking They build their nests with grass and moss on trees at the height of eight feet Their eggs are five in number dusky and spotted with black After hatching they resume their warble and collect in vast flocks to retire in September    The Little BLACK TROUPIALE  Oriolus Minor  Gmel  The Lesser Black Oriole  Lath  I have seen another Black Troupiale from America but much smaller and even inferior to the Redwing Thrush in size It was six or seven inches long and its tail which was square only two inches and a half and extended an inch beyond the wings  The plumage was entirely black but more glossy and floating with bluish reflexions on the head and the contiguous parts It is said that this bird can be easily tamed and taught to live familiarly in the house  The bird of No  Planches Enlumineés  is probably the female of this for it is entirely of a black or blackish colour except the head and the tail which are of a lighter tint as is commonly the case in females We also perceive the bluish reflexions which were remarked in the plumage of the male but these appear not on the feathers of the head but on those of the tail and the wings  No naturalist has I apprehend taken notice of this species  Specific character of the  Oriolus Minor    It is black the dark colour of the head mingled with coerulean    The BLACKCAPPED TROUPIALE  Le Troupiale a Calotte Noire  Buff  Oriolus Mexicanus  Gmel  The Blackcrowned Oriole  Lath  This bird appears to be entirely the same species with Brisson's Brown Troupiale of New Spain To form an idea of its plumage  imagine a bird of a fine yellow with a black cap and mantle The tail is of the same colour and spotless but the black on the wings is somewhat interrupted by the white which borders the coverts and again appears on the tips of the quills Its bill is of a lightgray with an orange tinge and the legs are chesnutIt is found in Mexico and in the island of Cayenne  Specific character of the  Oriolus Mexicanus    It is blackish the upper side and the head yellow    The SPOTTED TROUPIALE of Cayenne  Oriolus Melancholicus  Linn and Gmel  Anthornus Naevius  Briss  The Schomburger  Edw and Lath  The spots which occur in this small Troupiale are owing to this circumstance that almost all the feathers which are brown or blackish in the middle are edged with yellow more or less inclined to orange on the wings the tail and the lower part of the body The throat is of a pure white a streak of the same colour which passes close under the eye stretches back between two parallel black streaks one of which accompanies the white above and the other bends round the eye below the iris is of  a bright orange almost redAll these give a lively appearance to the male for though the iris is orange also in the female its plumage is of a tarnished yellow which mingling with a pale white produces an unpleasant uniformity  The bill is thick and pointed as in the Troupiales and cinereous the legs are fleshcoloured Its proportion may be conceived from the figure  The spotted Carouge of Brisson which in many respects resembles the Troupiale of this article differs from it in several important circumstances It is not half the size its hind nail is longer its iris is hazel its bill fleshcoloured its throat and the sides of its neck black and lastly the belly the legs above and below the tail are without a single spot  Edwards hesitated to which of two species he should refer it to the Thrush or to the Ortolan Klein decides very readily that it belongs to neither but to the Chaffinch yet notwithstanding his decision the shape of its bill and the identity of the climate determine me to adopt the opinion of Brisson who makes it a Carouge  Specific character of the  Oriolus Melancholicus    It is gray dotted with black with a white stripe on the eyes  Latham considers the Spotted Troupiale as a variety of this bird    The OLIVE TROUPIALE of Cayenne  Oriolus Olivaceus  Gmel  The Cayenne Olive Oriole  Lath  This bird is only six or seven inches long It owes its name to the olive colour which prevails on the hind part of its neck its back its tail its belly and the coverts of its wings But this colour is not uniform it is darker on the neck the back and the adjacent coverts of the wings and somewhat less so on the tail it is much lighter under the tail and also on a great part of the coverts of the wings which are furthest from the back with this difference between the large and the small sort that the latter have no mixture of colour while the former are variegated with brown The head the throat the forepart of the neck and the breast are of a glossy brown deeper under the throat and inclining to orange on the breast and running into the olive colour of the lower part of the body The bill and legs are black the wingquills and the large coverts nearest the outer edge are of the same colour but bordered with white  The shape of its bill is the same as that of the other Troupiales its tail is long and its wings when closed do not reach the third of the length  Specific character of the  Oriolus Olivaceus    It is olive the head throat and breast dusky the wings black    The WEAVER ORIOLE  Le CapMore  The name  Capmore  is contracted for  Capuchonmordoré  which denotes its  cowl of a dusky golden gloss  Buff  Oriolus Textor  Gmel  The two birds figured No and  Pl Enl  were brought by the captain of a ship who had collected forty birds from different countries Senegal Madagascar c and who had called them Senegal Chaffinches They have been termed Senegal Troupiales but that appellation seems very improper for the climate is different from that of the Troupiales and the Weaver is widely distinguished by the proportions of its bill tail and wings and the manner in which it builds its nest It is perhaps the African representative of the American species The two which we have mentioned belonged to a lady of high rank who allowed  them to be designed at her house and has obligingly communicated some particulars that occurred with regard to the way in which they conducted themselves This is the only source of information which we have  The eldest had a kind of cowl which appeared of a browngold gloss in the sun this cowl disappeared in the moulting during the autumn leaving the head of a yellow colour but it again returned in the spring and was constantly renewed the succeeding years The chief colour of the rest of the body was yellow more or less inclined to orange this was the predominant colour on the back and on the lower part of the body it bordered the coverts of the wings their quills and those of the tail which were all of a blackish ground  The young one had no cowl till the end of the second year and did not even change its colours before that time which occasioned its being mistaken for a female and designed as such No This mistake was excusable since the distinction of sexes is not apparent during infancy and one of the principal characters of the females is that of preserving long the marks of youth  Before the change which took place in the colours of its plumage the yellow was of a lighter tint than in the old one it spread over the throat the neck the breast and bordered as in the other all the quills of the tail and of  the wings The back was of an olivebrown which extended beyond the neck as far as the head In both the iris was orange the bill of a horn colour thicker and shorter than in the Troupiale and the legs reddish  These two birds lived in the same cage and at first upon good terms with each other the young one sat generally on the highest bar holding its bill close to the other which it answered by clapping its wings and with a submissive air  They were observed in the spring to interweave chickweed in the grating of their cage this was therefore conceived as an indication of their desire to nestle They were supplied with small rushes and they built a nest so capacious as to conceal one of them entirely The following year they renewed their labour but the young one being new clothed in the plumage of its sex was driven off by the other and obliged to conduct its work alone in another corner of the cage But it was still persecuted and notwithstanding its submissive behaviour it was often so roughly treated as to be left insensible They were separated and each was intent on building but the labours of one day were often destroyed in the succeedingA nest is not the production of an individual  They had both a singular kind of song somewhat shrill but very sprightly The old one died suddenly and the young one was cut off  by epileptic sits Their size was rather inferior to that of our first Troupiale and their wings and tail were also proportionably shorter  Specific character of the  Oriolus Textor    It is yellow its head dusky glistening with gold the quills of its wings and tail blackish and orange at their margin    The WHISTLER  Oriolus Viridis  Gmel  Icterus minus Viridis  Briss  The Whistler Oriole  Lath  I see no reason why Brisson has reckoned this bird a Baltimore for both in the shape of its bill and in the proportions of its tarsus it seems more related to the Troupiales But I leave the matter undecided placing it between the Troupiales and Baltimores and applying the vulgar name which it receives in St Domingo on account of its shrill notes  This bird is in general brown above except the rump and the small coverts of the wings which are of a greenish yellow as also in the whole underpart of the body but this colour is dusky below the throat and variegated with rusty on the neck and breast the great coverts and the quills of the wings as well as the twelve of the tail are edged with yellow But to form  an accurate idea of the plumage of the Whistler we must imagine an olive tint of various intensity spread over all the colours without exception To characterize the predominant colour of the plumage of this bird therefore we ought to take olive and not green as Brisson has done  The Whistler is of the size of a Chaffinch it is about seven inches long and ten or twelve inches across the wings the tail which is unequally tapered is three inches in length and the bill nine or ten lines  The BALTIMORE  Oriolus Baltimore  Linn and Gmel  Icterus Minor  Briss  Icterus ex auro nigroque varius  Klein  The Baltimore Bird  Catesby Penn and Lath  This bird owes its name to some resemblance that is perceived between the nature and distribution of the colours of its plumage and the arms of Lord Baltimore  Lord Baltimore was a Roman Catholic nobleman who obtained the grant of Maryland which he planted T  It is a small bird of the size of a house Sparrow and weighing little more than an ounce its length is six or seven inches its alar extent eleven or twelve its tail composed of twelve quills and two or three  inches long stretching more than a half beyond the wings when closed A sort of cowl of a fine black covers the head and descends before upon the throat and behind as far as the shoulders the great coverts and the quills of the wings are also black like those of the tail but the former are edged with white and the latter tipped with orange which is the broader the farther they are from the midones in which it is wanting The rest of the plumage is of a beautiful orange and lastly the bill and legs are of a lead colour  In the female which I examined in the Royal Cabinet all the forepart was of a fine black as in the male the tail of the same colour the great coverts and the wingquills blackish the whole without any mixture of other colour and what was so beautiful an orange in the male was only a dirty red in the female  I have already said that the bill of the Baltimores was not only proportionably shorter and straighter than in the Carouges the Troupiales and the Cassiques but of a peculiar shape It is a pyramid of five sides two belonging to the upper mandible and three to the lower I shall add that its leg or rather its tarsus is more slender than in the Carouges and Troupiales  The Baltimores disappear in the winter at least in Virginia and Maryland where Catesby observed them They are also found in Canada but Catesby met with none in Carolina  They build their nests on large trees such as the poplars the tulip trees  The tulip tree  LiriodendronTulipifera  LINN is peculiar to America and so called because its flowercup resembles a tulip in size and shape and has somewhat of the same tints T  c They fix it to the end of a thick branch and commonly support it by two small shoots which enter its sides in which circumstance the nests of the Baltimores seem to resemble those of the Loriots  Specific character of the  Oriolus Baltimore    It is blackish the underpart of its body and a stripe on its wings fulvous  The nest is curiously woven of tough filaments of plants intermixed with wool and lined with hair It is pearshaped open at top with a hole in the side by which the young are fed and void their excrements In some parts of North America it is called on account of its brilliancy the  Fiery hangnest    The BASTARD BALTIMORE  Oriolus Spurius  Gmel  Icterus Minor Spurius  Briss  Tardus Minor gutture nigro  Klein  This bird was no doubt so called because the colours of its plumage are not so lively as in the Baltimore and for this reason it may be considered as a degraded race In fact when we compare these birds and find an exact correspondence in every thing except in the colours and not even in the distribution of these but only in the different tints which they assume  we cannot hesitate to infer that the Bastard Baltimore is a variety of a more generous race degenerated by the influence of climate or some other accidental cause The black on the head is somewhat mottled that of the throat pure that part of the hood which falls behind is of an olive gray which becomes darker as it approaches the back Whatever in the preceding was bright orange is in the present yellow bordering on orange and more vivid on the breast and the coverts of the tail than on any other place The wings are brown but their great coverts and their quills are of a dirty white Of the twelve tail quills the two central ones are blackish near their middle olive at their origin and yellow at their extremity the next one on either side shews the two first colours mixed confusedly and in the four following quills the two last colours are melted together In a word the true Baltimore bears the same relation to the bastard one in respect to the colours of the plumage that the latter bears to its female in which the upperpart of the body is of a dusky white and the under of a yellowish white  Specific character of the  Oriolus Spurius    It is black fulvous below with a white stripe on the wings  In the State of NewYork it usually arrives in May attaches its nest to an appletree and lays five eggs  The YELLOW CASSIQUE of Brazil or the YAPOU  Oriolus Persicus  Linn and Gmel  Cassicus Luteus  Briss  The Black and Yellow Oriole  Lath  In Latin it has also been called  Pica    Picus Minor    Cissa    Nigra  c in Italian  Gazza  or  Zalla di Terra Nuova  in English  The Black and White Daw of Brazil  When we compare the Cassiques with the Troupiales the Carouges and the Baltimores all which have many common properties we perceive that they are larger that their bill is stronger and their legs proportionably shorter not to mention the difference in the general appearance which it would be difficult to describe  Several authors have given figures and descriptions of the Yellow Cassique under different names and scarcely two of these exactly correspondBut before we proceed to consider the varieties in detail it will be proper to separate a bird the characters of which seem to be widely distant from those of the Yellow Cassique of Brazil It is the Persian Magpie of Aldrovandus That naturalist describes it merely from a drawing which had been sent from Venice He reckons it to be of the size of our Magpie Its predominant colour is not black  but only duskish  subfuscum  Its bill is very thick somewhat short  breviusculum  and whitish its eyes white and its nails small whereas the Yapou is scarcely larger than a Blackbird and the dark part of its plumage is jet black its bill is pretty long of the colour of sulphur its iris is like sapphire and its nails of considerable strength according to Edwards and even very strong and hooked according to Belon We cannot doubt that birds so distinct belong to different species especially if Aldrovandus's information be true that his bird is a native of Persia for we are certain that the Yapou is American  The principal colours of the Yapou are constantly black and yellow but the distribution is not uniformly the same and varies in different individualsThe one for instance which we have caused to be designed is entirely black except the bill and the iris as we have said and the great coverts of the wings nearest the body which are yellow as also all the hindpart of the body both above and below from the thighs inclusively as far as the middle of the tail and even beyond itIn another which was brought from Cayenne and lodged in the Royal Cabinet and which is larger than the preceding there is less yellow on the wings and none at all on the lower part of the thigh and the legs appear proportionably strongerit is probably a maleIn the Black and White Pye of Edwards which  is evidently the same bird with ours there is on four or five of the yellow coverts of the wings a black spot near their extremity and besides this the black has purple reflexions and the bird is rather largerIn the Yapou or Jupujuba of Marcgrave the tail is mottled with black and white only below for its upper surface is entirely black except the outmost feather on each side which is yellow half its length  It follows therefore that the colours of the plumage are by no means fixed and invariable in this species which inclines me to believe with Marcgrave  I saw some entirely black having the back of a blood colour  MARCGRAVE  that the bird which Brisson calls  the Red Cassique  is only a variety of the sameI shall afterwards state my reasons  Specific character of the  Oriolus Persicus    It is black the hindpart of its back and a spot on the coverts of the wings and at the base of the coverts yellow    VARIETY of the YAPOU  I The RED CASSIQUE of Brazil or the JUPUBA  Oriolus Persicus  var Gmel  This is one of the names which Marcgrave gives to the Yapou and which I apply to the  Red Cassique of Brisson because it resembles that bird in the essential points the same proportions the same size the same aspect the same bill the same legs and the same deep black diffused through most of its plumage It is true that the lower part of the back is red instead of yellow and the under surface of the body and of the tail entirely black but this cannot be considered as a material distinction in a bird whose plumage we have already observed is subject to considerable variations Besides yellow and red are contiguous colours and apt to melt into orange a circumstance which may be occasioned by difference of age of sex of climate or of season  These birds are about twelve inches long and seventeen across the wings the tail is forked and bluish the two mandibles are equally arched downwards the first  phalanx  of the outer toe in each foot seems to grow into the midtoe the tail consists of twelve quills and the under surface is white both below the black and the yellow part of the plumáge  They construct their nests with grass interwoven with horse hair and hogs bristles or with vegetable productions which supply their place and they imitate the form of a cucurbit fitted to its alembic The nests are brown on the outside and about eighteen inches deep though the interior cavity is only a foot the upper part is thick and prominent for the space of half a foot and here they are suspended from the extremities  of small branches Sometimes four hundred of these nests have been seen at once hanging in a single tree of the kind which the Brazilians call  Uti  and as the Yapous hatch thrice ayear the multiplication must be prodigious This instinct of nestling in society on the same tree marks some analogy to our Daws  Linnaeus and Gmelin consider the bird described in this article as different from the  Jupujuba  of Marcgrave and form it into a new species under the name of  Oriolus Haemorrhous  the  Redrumped Oriole  of Latham Its specific character  Black with a scarlet rump    II The GREEN CASSIQUE of Cayenne  Oriolus Cristatus  var Gmel  I shall not here be obliged to compare or discuss the relations of other authors for none has taken notice of this bird Nor can I produce any information respecting its dispositions and instincts It is larger than the preceding its bill is thicker at the base and longer and its legs though still as short would appear to be stronger It has been very properly named the Green Cassique for all the forepart both above and below and even the coverts of the wings are of that colour the hindpart is chesnut the wingquills are black and those of the tail partly  black partly yellow the legs are entirely black and the bill is all red  The length of this Cassique is fourteen inches and its alar extent eighteen or nineteen  III The CRESTED CASSIQUE of Cayenne  Oriolus Cristatus  Gmel  Anthornus Maximus  Pallas  The Crested Oriole  Lath  This is also a new species and the largest with which we are acquainted Its bill is proportionably longer and firmer than in the others but its wings are shorter Its extreme length is eighteen inches its tail five and its bill two It is also distinguished from the preceding by small feathers which it bristles at pleasure on the top of its head and which form a sort of moveable crest All the forepart of this Cassique both above and below including the wings and the legs is black and the whole of the re  of a deep chesnut In the tail which is tapered the two middle quills are black like those of the wings but all the lateral ones are yellow and the bill is of the same colour  I have seen in the Royal Cabinet a specimen which was rather of an inferior size and in which the tail was entirely yellow but I am  not certain whether the two midquills were plucked for it had only eight quills in all  Specific character of the  Oriolus Cristatus    It is very black its top somewhat crested by some elongated feathers    IV The CASSIQUE of Louisiana  Oriolus Ludovicianus  Gmel  The Whiteheaded Oriole  Penn and Lath  White and changing violet sometimes mixed together sometimes separated are all the colours of this bird Its head is white and also its tail belly and rump the feathers of the wings and of the tail are of a waving violet and edged with white the rest of the plumage is dyed with a mixture of these colours  It is a new species lately brought from Louisiana We may add that it is the smallest of the Cassiques known its whole length is only ten inches and its wings when closed reach only to the middle of the tail which is somewhat tapered  The CAROUGE  Oriolus Bonana  Linn and Gmel  Xanthornus  Briss  Brisson regards it as the same with the  Xochitol Altera  of Fernandez already noticed But its plumage is different and though it inhabits the same country it builds its nest differently  Turdus Minor Varius  Klein  The Bonana Bird  Brown and Lath  In general the Bonanas are smaller and have a slenderer bill in proportion than the Troupiales The subject of this article has its plumage painted with three colours applied in large bodiesThese are Reddishbrown which is spread over all the forepart of the bird on the head the neck and the breast A velvet black on the back the feathers of the tail those of the wings and their great coverts and even on the bill and the legs Deep orange on the small coverts of the wings the rump and the coverts of the tail All these colours are more obscure in the female  The length of the Bonana is seven inches that of its bill six lines that of its tail above three inches its wings when spread measure eleven inches and when closed extend to the middle of the tail or beyond it This bird was brought from Martinico that of Cayenne  Fig No  Pl Enl  is smaller and the sort of cowl which covers its head neck c is black sprinkled with some small white spots on the sides of the neck and little reddish streaks on the back and lastly the great coverts and the middle feathers of the wings are edged with white But these differences are I conceive too inconsiderable to prevent our supposing the Cayenne Bonana a variety of that of Martinico They construct a curious kind of nest resembling the quarter of a hollow globe and few it under the leaf of a Bonana which shelters the nest and forms a part of it the rest consists of the fibres of the leaves  In what has been said it would be difficult to recognise the Spanish Nightingale of Sloane  Called also the  Watchy Picket  and  American Hangnest  It is the  Oriolus Nidipendulus  of Gmelin and the  Hangnest Oriole  of Latham  for that bird is in every respect smaller than the Bonana being only six English inches in length and nine across the wings its plumage is different and it constructs its nest in another mode It is a sort of bag suspended from the extremity of small branches by a thread which they spin out of a substance that they extract from a parasite plant called  old man's beard  which many have mistaken for horsehair In Sloane's bird the base of the bill was whitish and encircled by a black ring the crown of the head the neck the back and the tail were of a light  brown or rather reddish gray the wings of a deeper brown variegated with some white feathers the lower part of the tail marked in its middle with a black line the sides of the neck the breast and the belly of the colour of a dead leaf  Sloane mentions a variety either from age or sex which differs from the preceding only because its back has more of the yellow tint the breast and belly of a brighter yellow and there is a greater share of black under the bill  These birds haunt the woods and have an agreeable song They feed on insects and worms for fragments of these are found in their gizzard or stomach which is not muscular Their liver is divided into a great number of lobes and of a blackish colour  I have seen a variety of the St Domingo Carouges or the Yellow Bottoms of Cayenne which I proceed to consider it resembled much the female Bonana of Martinico except that its head and neck were blacker This confirms my idea that most of these species are related and that notwithstanding our constant endeavour to reduce their number we have still carried the subdivisions too far especially with regard to foreign birds with which we are so imperfectly acquainted  Specific character of the  Oriolus Bonana    It is fulvous its head and breast chesnut its back and the quills of its wings and tail black    The LESSER BONANA  Le Petit Cul Jaune de Cayenne  Buff  Oriolus Xanthornus  Linn and Gmel  Xanthornus Mexicanus  Briss  Brisson supposes it to be the same with the  Ayoquantototl  of Fernandez which has indeed the same size and its plumage com  osed of black yellow and white But Fernandez says nothing of the distribution of these colours nor furnishes any property  haracteristic of the species  The male and female of this species are repre  ented No fig and fig  Pl Enl  They  ave a jargon nearly like that of our Loriot and  rill like that of our Magpie  They suspend their nests which are of a  urse shape from the extremity of small branch  s like the Troupiales but I am informed they  hoose the branches that are long and naked and  elect the trees that are stunted and illformed  nd lean over the course of a river It is also said that these nests are subdivided into compartments for the separate families which has not been observed in the Troupiales  These birds are exceedingly crafty and difficult to ensnare They are nearly of the size of a Lark their length eight inches their alar ex  ent twelve or thirteen the tail three or four  nches and tapered stretching more than half beyond the closed wings The principal colours  of those represented No are yellow and black In fig the black is spread over the throat the bill and the space between that and the eye the great coverts and the quills of the wings and of the tail and the legs all the rest is yellow But we must observe that the middle quills and the great coverts of the wings are edged with white and the latter sometimes entirely white In fig a part of the small coverts of the wings the thighs and the belly as far as the tail are yellow and the rest all black  Specific character of the  Lesser Bonana Bird    It is yellow the upper part of its throat its tail and wingquills black    We may consider as varieties of this species The Yellowheaded American Carouge or Bonana of Brisson The crown of its head the small coverts of its tail those of the wings and the lower part of the thigh are yellow the rest of the body entirely black or blackish it is about eight inches long twelve inches across the wings the tail consisting of layers containing twelve quills each four inches long  Oriolus Chrysocephalus  Linn and Gmel  Xanthornus Icterocephalus Americanus  Briss  The Goldenheaded Oriole  Lath  The Bonana or Carouge of the island of St Thomas whose plumage is also black except a little yellow spot on the small coverts of the wings it has twelve quills in the tail which is tapered as in the Lesser Bonana but somewhat longer Edwards has designed one of the same species Pl  which has a remarkable depression at the base of the upper mandible  Oriolus Cayanensis  Linn and Gmel  Xanthornus Cayanensis  Briss  The Yellowwinged Pye  Edw  The Yellowwinged Oriole  Lath  The Jamac of Marcgrave which differs very little from it with respect to size and of which the colours are the same and distributed nearly in the same way as in fig except that the head is black that the white on the wings is collected in a single spot and that a black line extends across the back from the one wing to the other  Oriolus Jamacaii  Gmel  The Brazilian Oriole  Lath    The YELLOWHEADED ORIOLE  Les Coiffes Jaunes  Buff  Oriolus Icterocephalus  Linn and Gmel  Xanthornus Icterocephalus Cayanensis  Briss  The Yellowheaded Starling  Edw  These are Cayenne Bonanas which have a black plumage and a sort of cap that covers the head and part of the neck but descends lower before than behind A black streak which stretches from the nostrils to the eyes and turns round the bill has been omitted in the figure The subject represented Pl appears to be considerably larger than another which I have seen in the Royal Cabinet Must this be ascribed  to the difference of age of sex of climate or to the defect of the preparation But from that variety Brisson has drawn his description its size is equal to that of the Brambling it is about seven inches long and eleven across the wings  The OLIVE CAROUGE of Louisiana  Oriolus Capensis  Gmel  Xanthornus Capitis Bonoe Spei  Briss  The Olive Oriole  Lath  This bird is represented  Pl Enl  No Fig under the name of the Carouge Bonana of the Cape of Good Hope I had long suspected that this bird though brought from the Cape to Europe was really not a native of Africa and the point is decided by the late arrival October of a Bonana from Louisiana which is evidently of the same species and differs in nothing but in the colour of the throat which in the latter is black and orange in the former I am convinced that we ought to entertain the same opinion of all the pretended Bonanas and Troupiales of the ancient continent and that we shall discover sooner or later that they are either of a different species or have derived their origin from America  The Olive Bonana of Louisiana has much of the olive tinge in its plumage especially on the upper part of the body but this colour is not uniform it is tinctured with gray on the crown of the head and with brown behind the neck on the back the shoulders the wings and the tail with a lightbrown on the rump and the origin of the tail and with yellow on the flanks and the thighs and the large coverts and quills of the wings whose fundamental colour is brown are edged with yellow All the underpart of the body is yellow except the throat which is orange the bill and the legs are of a cinereous brown  This bird is nearly of the size of a house sparrow its length six or seven inches its alar extent ten or eleven inches The bill is near an inch long and the tail more than two it is square and consists of twelve quills The first quill is the shortest of the wing and the third and fourth the longest  Specific character of the  Olive Oriole    It is of a dusky olive below yellow    The KINK  Oriolus Sinensis  Gmel  The Kink Oriole  Lath  This new species brought very lately from China appears to resemble so much the Bonana on the one hand and the Blackbird on the other that it may be regarded as the intermediate shade The sides of its bill are compressed as in the Blackbird but not scalloped like those of the Bonana and Daubenton the younger has properly given it a distinct name as being really different from these two species though it connects the common chain  The Kink is smaller than our Blackbird its head its neck origin of its back and its breast are of ashgray and this colour acquires a deeper hue as it approaches the back the rest of the body both above and below is white as also the coverts of the wings whose quills are of a polished steelcolour glistening with reflexions that play between greenish and violet The tail is short tapered and parted by this same steel colour and white so that on the two midquills the white is only a small spot at their extremity this white spot extends higher on the following quills the farther they remove from the middle and the steel colour retiring is at last reduced on the two exterior quills to a small spot near their origin  N  o  THE GOLDEN ORIOLE  The LORIOT  In Greek  from its greenish yellow colour the female  according to Aelian in modern Greek  or figeater In Latin it has also the names  Chlorion  and  Chloris  besides  Chloreus    Oriolus    Merula Aurea    Turdus Aureus    Luteus    Lutea    Luteolus    Ales Luridus    Picus nidum suspendens    Avis Icterus    Galgalus  and Pliny applies these four names  Galbulus    Galbula    Vireo    Vineo  in Italian  Oriolo    Regalbulo    Gualbedro    Galbero    Reigalbero    Garbella    Rigeyo    Melziozallo    Becquafigo    Brusola  in Spanish  Oropendula    Oroyendola  in German  Bierholdt    Bierolf    BrouderBerolft    Byrolt    Tyrolt    Kirscholdt    Gerolft    Kersenrife    Goldamsel    Goldmerle    Gutmerle    Olimerle    Gelbling    Widdewal    Witwal  in Swiss  Wittewalch  The name  Oriole  is derived from the Latin  Aureolus  or Golden    Oriolus Galbula  Linn and Gmel  Oriolus  Briss  Galbula  Ray and Will  Turdus Luteus  Frisch  Turdus Aureus  Klein  The Witwall  Will  The Yellowbird from Bengal  Alb  The Golden Oriole  Penn and Lath  IT has been said that the young of this bird are excluded by degrees and in detached parts and that the first object of the parents is to collect and combine the scattered limbs and by virtue of a certain herb to form them into an animated whole The difficulty of this marvellous reunion hardly exceeds perhaps that of properly separating the ancient names which the moderns have confusedly applied to this species  retaining those which really belong to it and referring the others to those kinds which the ancients intended them to denote I shall here observe only that though this bird is dispersed through a wide extent there are certain countries which it seems to avoid It is not found in Sweden in England in the Bugey mountains nor in the heights of Nantua though it appears in Switzerland regularly twice a year Belon says that he never saw it in Greece and how can we suppose that Aristotle knew this bird without being acquainted with the singular construction of its nest or if he knew it that he should have omitted to take notice of it  Pliny speaks of the  Chlorion  Hist Nat lib x  from the account of Aristotle but is not always attentive to compare the information which he borrows from the Greeks with what he draws from other sources He has mentioned the Loriot by four different terms  Picorum  aliquis suspendit in surculo nidum primis in ramis cyathi modo  Lib x  Jam publicum quidem omnium est  galgulos  tabulata ramorum sustinendo nido providè eligere camerâque ab imbri aut fronde protegere densâ  From this similarity in the construction of the nest we may conclude that the  Picus  and  Galgulus  are the same with the Loriot That the  Galgulus  is still the same with the  Avis Icterus  and the  Ales Luridus  appears from the two following passages  Avis icterus  vocatur a colore quae si spectetur sanari id malum regium tradunt et avem mori hanc puto Latine vocari  galgulum  Lib xxx  Icterias lapis  aliti lurido  similis ideo existimatur salubris contra regios morbos  Lib  xxxvii  Besides in Book x Pliny says of the  Galgulus  that  it retires as soon as it has reared its young  which agrees exactly with the Golden Oriole  without acquainting us whether it is the same bird with the  Chlorion  The Loriot is a roving bird continually changing its abode it lives with us only during the season of love It obeys the primary impulses with ardour and fidelity The union is formed on the arrival about the middle of the spring The pair build their nest on lofty trees but often at no considerable height they form it with singular industry and in a way very different from that of the Blackbird though they have been referred to the same genus They commonly fasten to the fork of a small branch long straws or hempstalks some of which extending directly across form the margin of the nest others penetrate through its texture while others bending under it give solidity to the structure The nest is thus provided with an exterior cover and the inner bed prepared for receiving the eggs is a matting of the small stems of doggrass the beards of which are so much concealed that the nest has often been supposed to be lined with the roots of plants The interstices between the outer and inner case are filled with moss lichens and other such substances which compact the whole After the nest is constructed the female drops in it four or five eggs the ground colour of which is a dirty white and sprinkled with small distinct  spots of a brown approaching to black most numerous on the small end She sits closely three weeks and not only retains long her affection  BELON  to her young but defends them against their enemies and even against man with more intrepidity than could be expected from so small a bird The parents have been seen to dart resolutely upon the plunderers of their brood and what is still more remarkable a mother taken with her nest continued to hatch in the cage and expired on her eggs  After the young are reared the family prepares for its journey This commonly happens in the end of August or the beginning of September They never assemble in numerous flocks nor do the families remain united for seldom are more than two or three found together Though they fly rather heavily flapping their wings like the Blackbird they probably winter in Africa for on the one hand the Chevalier des Mazy Commander of the Order of Malta assures me that they pass that island in the month of September and repass it in the spring and on the other Thevenot says that they migrate into Egypt in the month of May and return in September  Voyage du Levant tom i p  He adds that in May they are very fat and their flesh good eating Aldrovandus is surprised that in France they are never brought to our tables  The Loriot is about as large as the Blackbird its length nine or ten inches its alar extent sixteen its tail three and a half long and its bill fourteen lines The male is of a fine yellow over all the body the neck and head except a black streak which stretches from the eye to the corner of the aperture of the bill The wings are black except a few yellow spots which terminate most of the great quills and some of the coverts the tail is divided by yellow and black so that the black prevails on the part which appears of the two midquills and the yellow gradually exends over the lateral quills beginning at the tips of those which are next the two middle ones But the plumage is very different in the two sexes Almost all that was of a pure black in the male is in the female of a brown with a greenish tinge and what was of a beautiful yellow in the former is in the latter olive and pale brownolive on the head and the upper part of the body dirty white variegated with brown streaks under the body white at the tips of most of the wingquills and pale yellow at the extremity of their coverts and there is no pure yellow except at the end of the tail and on the lower coverts I have besides observed in a female a small space behind the ear without feathers and of a light slate colour  The young males resemble the females with respect to plumage and the more so the tenderer their age At first they are still more speckled  than the female and even on the upper part of the body but in the month of August the yellow begins to appear under the body Their cry is different also from that of the old ones they scream  yo    yo    yo  succeeded sometimes with a sort of mewing like that of a cat  Gesner says that they pronounce  Oriot  or  Loriot  Belon that they seem to say  compere loriot  and others have fancied that they articulated  lousot bonnes merises  c  But they have also a sort of whistling especially before rain  GESNER  if this be not really the same with the mewing  Their iris is red the bill reddish brown the inside of the bill reddish the edges of the lower mandible somewhat arched lengthwise the tongue forked and as it were jagged at the tip the gizzard muscular terminating in a bag formed by the dilatation of the  oesophagus  the gall bladder green the  coeca  very small and short and the first  phalanx  of the outer toe glued to that of the middle toe  When they arrive in the spring they feed on caterpillars worms insects whatever in short they can catch but they are fondest of cherries figs  Hence they have been called  and  Becafigos  Perhaps the figs improve the quality of their flesh they do so in the case of Blackbirds  the berries of the service tree peas c A couple of these birds could in one day completely plunder a rich cherrytree for they peck  the cherries one after another and only eat the ripe part  The Loriots are not easy to breed or tame They can be caught by the call placing limed twigs where they drink and by various sorts of nets  These birds have sometimes spread from one end of the continent to another without suffering any alteration in their external form or in their plumage for Loriots have been seen in Bengal and even in China which were precisely like ours But others have been brought from nearly the same countries which had some differences in their colours and which may be regarded for the most part as varieties of climate till accurate observations of their instincts their habits and manner of life throw light on our conjectures  Specific character of the  Golden Oriole    It is yellow its straps and joints are black its outer tailquills yellow behind  It seldom or never visits England    VARIETIES of the LORIOT  I The COULAVAN  Oriolus Chinensis  Linn and Gmel  Oriolus Cochinensis  Briss  This bird is brought from CochinChina it is perhaps rather larger than our Loriot its bill is also proportionably stronger the colours of the plumage are precisely the same and every where distributed in a similar manner except on the coverts of the wings which are entirely yellow and on the head where there is a sort of black horseshoe of which the convex part bounds the occiput and its branches passing below the eye terminate in the corners of the opening of the bill This is the most remarkable distinction of the Coulavan and yet there is in the Loriot a black spot between the eye and the bill which appears to be the rudiment of the horseshoe  I have seen some specimens of the Coulavan in which the upper part of the body was of a brown yellow In all the bill is yellowish and the legs black  Specific character of the  Oriolus Chinensis    It is yellow the joints black but yellow at the tips a black stripe on the back of the head  Latham reckons it a variety    II The CHINESE LORIOT  Oriolus Melanocephalus  Gmel  Sturnus Luteolus  Linn  Oriolus Bengalensis  Briss  The Blackheaded Indian Icterus  Edw  It is somewhat less than ours but is of the same shape proportions and colours though these are differently disposed The head the throat and the forepart of the neck are entirely black  The sort of black piece that covers the throat and the foreside of the neck is in Edwards' figure a scallop on each near its middle  and in the tail there is no black but a broad stripe which crosses the two intermediate quills near their extremity and two spots placed very near the tips of the two following quills Most of the coverts of the wings are yellow the others are parted with black and yellow the largest quills are black where they are seen when the wings are closed and the others are edged or tipt with yellow all the rest of the plumage is of the finest yellow  The female is different  Oriolus Galbula  var Gmel  Icterus Maderaspatanus Noevius  Briss  The Mottled Jay  Ray  The Yellow Starling from Bengal  Alb  The Yellow Indian Starling  Edw  for the front or the space between the eye and the bill is of a vivid yellow the throat and the forepart of the  neck of a light yellowish cast with brown speckles the rest of the underpart of the body is of a deeper yellow the upper of a shining yellow all the wings variegated with brown and yellow the tail also yellow except the two midquills which are brown marked with a yellowish spangle and tipt with yellow  III The INDIAN LORIOT  Oriolus Galbula  var Gmel  Oriolus Indicus  Briss  Chloris Indicus  Aldr  It has more yellow than any of the Loriots for it is entirely of that colour except A horseshoe which bends round the crown of the head and terminates on each side in the corners of the bill Some longitudinal spots on the coverts of the wings A belt which crosses the tail near the middle the whole of an azure colour but the bill and legs are of a glowing bright red  IV The STRIPEDHEADED ORIOLE  Le Loriot Rayé  Buff  Oriolus Radiatus  Gmel  Oriolus Capite striato  Briss  Merula Bicolor  Aldrov  This bird has been regarded by some as a Blackbird by others as a Loriot its true place seems to be between the Loriots and the Blackbirds and since its proportions are different from those of either of these two species I would consider it as an intermediate or related species rather than as a mere variety  The radiated Loriot is not so large as a Blackbird and of a more slender shape its bill tail and legs are shorter but its toes longer its head is brown delicately radiated with white its wingquills are also brown and edged with white all the body is of a beautiful orange deeper on the upperpart than on the lower the bill and the nails are nearly of the same colour and the legs are yellow  The THRUSHES  Les Grives  Buff  Turdi  Linn c  THE family of the Thrushes is certainly much related to that of the Blackbirds  Merulae et turdi amicae sunt aves  says Pliny There seems little doubt that the Blackbirds and Thrushes consort since they are commonly caught in the same snares  but it would be improper as several naturalists have done to confound them together The common people appear to have acted more wisely who have applied different names to objects which are really distinct Those are termed Thrushes whose plumage is speckled  The word  grivelé  is used in the original and is formed undoubtedly from  grive  the term for a Thrush  or marked with little strokes disposed with a kind of regularity on the contrary those are Blackbirds whose plumage is uniform or varied with large spots We readily adopt this distinction and reserving the Blackbirds for a separate article we shall treat of the Thrushes in the present We shall distinguish four principal species in our own climate and to them we shall refer as usual their varieties and the foreign species most analogous  The first species is the  Throstle  Pl Enl No and I consider as varieties the  Whiteheaded  Thrush  of Aldrovandus the  Crested Thrush  of Schwenckfeld and as foreign analogous species the  Guiana Thrush  Pl Enl No fig and  the Little American Thrush  mentioned by Catesby  The second species is the  Missel  Pl Enl No which is the  turdus viscivorus  of the ancients and to which I shall refer the  White Missel  as a variety  The third species is the  Fieldfare  Pl Enl No it is the  turdus pilaris  of the ancients The varieties the  Spotted Fieldfare  of Klein and the  Whiteheaded Fieldfare  of Brisson I reckon as the analogous foreign kinds the  Carolina Fieldfare  of Catesby which Brisson makes his eighth species of Thrushes and the  Canada Fieldfare  of Catesby which Brisson makes his ninth species  The fourth species is the  RedWing  Pl Enl No which is the  turdus iliacus  of the ancients  Lastly I shall subjoin some foreign Thrushes which are too little known to be referred to their proper species such are the  Green Barbary Thrush  of Doctor Shaw and the  Chinese Hoami  of Brisson which I shall admit into the Thrushes upon the authority of that naturalist though it appears to me to differ from them in its plumage and in its shape  Of the four principal species belonging to our climate the two first which are the Throstle  and the Missel resemble each other Both appear to be less subject to the necessity of migration since they often breed in France Germany Italy and in short in those countries where they pass the winter Both sing delightfully and they are of the small number of birds whose warble is composed of a succession of notes and they both seem to be of an unsocial disposition for according to some observers they perform their journies alone Frisch traces other analogies also between the colours of their plumage and the order of their distribution c  The two other species  viz  the Fieldfare and the Redwing are also analogous in some circumstances They travel in numerous flocks are more transitory and seldom nestle in our climates for which reason they sing very seldom  FRISCH  In summer says TURNER the Turdus Pilaris is seldom or never seen with us in England in winter no birds are more numerous  and their song is unknown not only to many naturalists but even to most sportsmen It is rather a sort of chirping and when a score meet on a poplar they chatter all at once making a very loud noise which is far from being melodious  Both sexes of the Thrush are nearly of the same size and equally liable to change their plumage from one season to another  They have one colour in winter another in summer  ARISTOTLE  In all  of them the first  phalanx  of the outer toe is joined to that of the midtoe the edges of the bill scalloped near the tip None of them subsists on seeds whether because it suits not their appetite or that their bill and stomach are too weak to break and digest them Berries are their chief food and hence they have received the epithet of  baccivorous  They also eat insects worms c and it is in quest of these that they come abroad after rain rove in the fields and scrape the ground especially the Missels and the Fieldfares They make the same search in winter in places of a warm aspect where the ground is thawed  Their flesh is a delicate food especially that of the first and fourth species which are the Throstle and the RedWing but the ancient Romans held it in still higher estimation than we and kept these birds the whole year in a sort of voleries which deserve to be described  Inter aves turdus Inter quadrupedes gloria prima lepus  MARTIAL    Each volery contained many thousand Thrushes and Blackbirds not to mention other birds excellent for eating such as Ortolans Quails c So numerous were these voleries in the vicinity of Rome and in the territory of the Sabines that the dung of the Thrushes was employed to manure the lands and what is remarkable to fatten oxen and hogs  Varro  Dere Rusticâ  Lib i    These Thrushes had less liberty in their voleries than our field pigeons in their dovecotes for they were never suffered to go abroad and they laid no eggs but as they were supplied with abundance of choice food they fattened to the great profit of the proprietor  Each fat Thrush except at the time of migration sold for three  denarii  equal to about two shillings sterling And on the occasion of a triumph or public festival this sort of trade yielded a profit of twelve hundred  per cent  See  Coslumella  de re Rusticâ  lib viii  and  Varro lib iii  The voleries were a kind of vaulted courts the inside furnished with a number of roosts The door was very low the windows were few and placed in such manner as to prevent the prisoners from seeing the fields the woods the birds fluttering at liberty or whatever might awaken their sensibility and disturb the calm so conducive to corpulence A little glimmering was sufficient to direct them to their food which consisted of millet and a sort of paste made with bruised figs and flour They had also given them the berries of the lentisk of the myrtle of the ivy and whatever in short would improve the delicacy and flavour of their flesh They were supplied with a little stream of water which ran in a gutter through the volery Twenty days before they were intended for killing their allowance was augmented nay so far was the attention carried that they gently removed into a little antichamber the Thrushes  which were plump and in good order to enjoy more quiet and frequently to heighten the illusion they hung boughs and verdure imitating the natural seenery so that the birds might fancy themselves in the midst of the woods In short they treated their slaves well because they knew their interest Such as were newly caught were put in small separate voleries along with others that had been accustomed to confinement and every contrivance every soothing art was employed to habituate them somewhat to bondage yet these were birds never completely tamed  We can at present perceive some traces of the ancient practice improved indeed by the skill of the moderns It is common in certain provinces of France to hang pots in the tops of trees which are haunted by the Thrushes and these birds finding convenient sheltered nests seldom fail to lay their eggs in them to hatch and rear their young  BELON  This plan contributes doubly to the multiplication of the species for it both preserves the brood and by saving the time spent in building nests it enables them to make two hatches in the year  It appears even that they sometimes have three hatches for Salerne found in the month of September a Thrush's nest in a vine containing three eggs not yet hatched which appeared to be of the third hatch  When they find no pots they construct their  nests in trees or even bushes and with great art they cover the outside with moss straw dried leaves c but they line the inside with a hard case formed of mud compacted with straws and small roots In this respect they differ from the Pies and Blackbirds which lay their eggs on a soft mattress These nests are hollow hemispheres about four inches in diameter The colour of the eggs varies in the different species between blue and green with some dull spots that are most frequent on the large end Every species has also its peculiar song and sometimes they have even been taught to speak  Agrippina the wife of Claudius Caesar had a Thrush which imitated human speech  Pliny lib x  But this must be understood chiefly of the Throstle and the Missel in which the organs of voice seem to be the most perfect  It is said that the Thrushes swallow the berries entire of the juniper the misletoe the ivy c  Linnaeus  and void them so little altered that when they fall in a proper soil they germinate and produce But Aldrovandus affirms that having made these birds swallow the grapes of the wild vine and the berries of the misletoe he could never discover in their excrements any of these that retained its form  The Thrushes have a ventricle more or less muscular no craw nor even a dilatation of the  oesophagus  which may supply its place and scarce any  caecum  but all of them have a gall bladder have the end of the tongue parted into two or three threads and have eighteen quills in each wing and twelve in the tail  These birds are sad and melancholy and as the natural consequence of that disposition they are the more enamoured of liberty They seldom play or even fight together still less will they bend to domestic slavery But their love of freedom is not equalled by their resources for preservation Their oblique and tortuous flight is almost their only protection against the shot of the sportsman or the talons of the bird of prey  Skilful sportsmen assure me that Thrushes are difficult to shoot even more so than Snipes  If they reach a close branchy tree they remain still through fear and can hardly be beat out  This is perhaps the reason that they are said to be deaf    deafer than a Thrush  was a proverb in Greece But all the fowlers assure me that the Thrush has a very quick ear  Thousands of them are caught in snares but the Throstle and the RedWing are the two species which can the most easily be caught by the noose and almost the only ones that can be taken by the call  These nooses are nothing but two or three horsehairs twisted together and forming a running knot They are placed round the junipers or servicetrees in the neighbourhood of a fountain or a mere and when the place is well chosen and the springs properly set several  hundred Thrushes have been caught in a day in the space of a hundred acres  It is ascertained from observations made in different countries that when the Thrushes appear in Europe about the beginning of the autumn they arrive from the countries of the north in company with those numerous flocks of birds which on the approach of winter traverse the Baltic sea and leave Lapland Siberia Livonia Poland and Prussia for more temperate climates So abundant are the Thrushes then on the southern shore of the Baltic that according to the computation of Klein the single city of Dantzic consumes every year ninety thousand pairs It is equally certain that the survivors which emigrate again after the rigors of winter direct their course towards the north But the different species arrive not all of them at the same time In Burgundy the Throstle appears the first about the end of September next the RedWing and last of all the Fieldfare and the Missel but the latter species is much less numerous than the three others which might be expected since it is more dispersed  We must not suppose that all the species of Thrushes pass constantly in the same number sometimes they are very few because the season has either been unfavourable to their multiplication or to their migration  I am assured that some years the RedWings are very rare in Provence and this is the case also in the northern countries  at other times they  are extremely numerous and a very intelligent observer  Hebert  has informed me that he saw prodigious clouds of Thrushes chiefly RedWings and Fieldfares alight in the month of March at Brie and cover an extent of seven or eight leagues This appearance which was unexampled lasted near a month and it was remarked that the cold had continued very long that winter  Letters of M le Commandeur Godeheu de Riville tom i pp  Mem Etran    The ancients said that the Thrushes came every year into Italy from beyond seas about the autumnal equinox and that they returned about the vernal equinox and that in both passages  Varro  De Re Rustica  lib iii  These islets lie south of the city of Rome somewhat to the east That of  Pandataria  is at present known by the name  Ventotene  they assembled and rested in the islets of Pontia Palmaria and Pandataria which are nigh the Italian coasts They repose too in the island of Malta where they arrive in October and November the northwest wind brings some flocks the south or southwest sometimes beats them back But they do not always arrive with certain winds and their appearance depends oftener on the state of the air than on its motion for if in calm weather the sky suddenly darkens with the preludes of a storm the ground is then covered with Thrushes  Nor does the island of Malta appear to limit the migration of the Thrushes towards the  south for they are found in the interior parts of the African continent from whence they annually pass it is said into Spain  Being in Spain in  says the translator of Edwards  in the kingdom of Valencia on the seacoast I saw in October great flocks of birds that came in a direct course from Africa Some were killed and found to be Thrushes but so dry and lean that they had neither substance nor taste The people of the country told me that every year at the same season such flocks arrive but that most of them proceed much further  Admitting the fact I still doubt whether thest Thrushes really come from Africa for this would be contrary to their usual route and the tendency of their flight on their arrival is no proof of the direction of their whole course    Those which remain in Europe spend the summer in the mountain forests and on the approach of winter they remove from the heart of the woods where the fruits and insects begin to fail and settle on the skirts of the adjacent plains It is no doubt during this flitting that in the beginning of November so great a number are caught in the forest of Compigne It is uncommon says Belon to find the different species in numbers at the same time and in the same place  In all of them the edges of the upper mandible are scalloped near the point the inside of the bill is yellow its base has some black hairs or bristles projecting forwards the first  phalanx  of the outertoe is joined to that of the middletoe the upperpart of the body is of a deeper brown and the under lighter and speckled lastly in all or in most of them the tail is  nearly a third of the total length of the bird which varies in the different species between eight and eleven inches and is only twothirds of the alar extent the wings when closed reach as far as the middle of the tail and the weight of the bird is between two ounces and a half and four and a half  Klein asserts he is well informed that Thrushes are found also in the northern parts of India but which differ from ours in not migrating  The THROSTLE  In Greek  or  In Latin  Turdus  In Italian  Tordo Mezzano  In Spanish  Zorzal  In German  Drossel  or  Drostel  hence the English name and in Brandenburg  Zippe  In Poland  Drozd  In Smoland  Klera  and in Ostrogothia  Klaedra    La Grive  Buff  Turdus Musicus  Linn and Gmel  Turdus Minor  Briss  Turdus in altissimis  Klein  The Mavis    Throstle  or  SongThrush  Will  THIS species in the French language gives name to the whole genus I have therefore ranged it in the first place though in point of size it occupies only the third It is very common in some parts of Burgundy and called by the country people  The Little Thrush  Grivette  or  Little RedWing  Mauviette  It commonly arrives every year about the time of vintage probably attracted by the maturity of the grapes and hence undoubtedly it has received the name of  VineThrush  It disappears during the frosts and again makes a transient visit in the months of March or April before its migration in May On the departure of the flock they always leave a few stragglers behind which are either unable to follow the main body or yielding to  the mild influence of spring stop and breed in the forests that occur in their route  Dr Lottinger assures me that they arrive in the months of March and April in the mountains of Lorraine and that they return in September and October Hence it would follow that in these mountains or rather in forests that cover them they pass the summer and from these retreats visit us in autumn But must we apply this local remark of Lottinger's to the whole species Observations alone will decide  This is the reason why some Throstles constantly remain in our woods where they build their nest on the wild apple and peartrees and even in junipers and in the bushes as has been observed in Silesia  Frisch  and in England  British Zoology  Sometimes they fix it in the trunk of a thick tree ten or twelve feet high and prefer for the materials wood rotten and wormeaten  They generally pair about the end of winter and form lasting unions They make two hatches in the year and sometimes a third when their former have not succeeded The first laying consists of five or six eggs of a deep blue with black spots most frequent at the large end and in the subsequent hatches the number regularly diminishes It is difficult in this species to separate the males from the females their size being the same in both sexes and the colours of their plumage as I have said subject to vary Aldrovandus saw and caused to be delineated three of these birds caught in different  seasons all which differed in the colours of their bill of their legs and of their feathers in one of them the streaks on the breast were hardly perceptible Frisch asserts however that the old males have a white ray above the eyes and Linnaeus makes these white eyelids one of the characters of the species Almost all the other naturalists agree that the young males can hardly be distinguished but by their early inclination to chant for the Throstle sings delightfully especially in the spring  On its first arrival about the end of winter it has only a feeble whistle day and night like the Ortolans  whose return it announces and as it breeds several times in the year it enjoys a succession of the vernal pleasures and may be said to warble threefourths of the year It sits whole hours on the top of a tall tree straining its delicate throat Its warbling consists of several different couplets like that of the Missel but still more varied and more charming which has obtained for it in many countries the denomination of the  Singing Thrush  The song is undoubtedly intended to attract the female for even the imperfect imitation of it will produce that effect  Each brood follows separately their parents sometimes several of these chancing to meet in the same wood would induce us to think that  they associate in numerous flocks  FrischDr Lottinger also says that though they do not migrate in troops many are found together or pretty nigh each other  but their union is fortuitous and momentary the families soon separate and even the individuals disperse after they are able to provide singly their subsistence  I am assured however that they like the company of the Calendar Larks    These birds are found in Italy France Lorraine England Scotland Sweden where they haunt the forests which abound with maples  Linnaeus  Fauna Suecica  They migrate from Sweden into Poland fifteen days before and after the festival of St Michael when the weather is warm and calm  Though the Throstle is quicksighted and very alert to avoid its declared enemies and to escape from manifest dangers it has at bottom but little cunning and is quite unguarded against concealed stratagems it is easily caught either by the call or the gin though less so than the RedWing In some parts of Poland such numbers are taken that small barks are loaded with them for exportation  Rzaczinski  It is a bird that delights in woods and in such places the snares may be laid with success It seldom is met with in the plains and even when it visits the vines it constantly retires into the neighbouring copses in the evening and during the heat of the day  so that to succeed in catching the Throstle we ought to choose the proper time its departure in the morning and its return in the evening or the midday when the sun's rays are most oppressive Sometimes they are intoxicated with eating ripe grapes and then they fall an easy prey  Willughby informs us that this species breeds in England and resides there the whole year and he adds that its flesh is excellent but partakes of the quality of its food Our Throstle subsists in autumn on chesnuts beechmast grapes figs ivyberries juniperberries the fruit of the servicetree and such like aliments We are not so certain what it lives upon in the spring In that season it commonly appears on the ground in the woods in wet places and among the bushes which skirt the flooded meadows where it may be supposed to search for earthworms snails c If an intense vernal frost happens the Throstles instead of flying to milder climates retire to the springs and languish and pine and a continuance of this severe weather will destroy many of them This would seem to shew that cold is not the sole cause of their migrations but that they have a certain circuit to describe annually in a given time It is said that pomegranates prove a poison to them In Bugey the nests of the Throstles are much sought after or rather  their young which are dressed into delicate dishes  I should suppose that this species was unknown to the ancients for Aristotle reckons only three kinds  Hist Anim  lib ix  which are all different from the present and of which we shall treat in the following articles Nor can we imagine that Pliny meant this when he speaks of a new species which appeared in Italy in the time of the war between Otho and Vitellius for that bird was almost as large as a Pigeon  Pliny lib x  and therefore four times the size of the Throstle which weighs only three ounces  I have observed in a Throstle which lived some time with me that when it was angry it cracked and snapped with its bill its upper mandible was also moveable though much less than the lower also its tail was somewhat forked which is not very evident from the figure  Specific character of the Throstle  Turdus Musicus  LINN  Its wingquills are ferruginous at their inner base  It is nine inches long and its alar extent thirteen and a half It sings especially in the evenings of the spring from the top of the highest tree and breeds in bushes and thickets Its nest is formed with earth moss and straws the inside plastered with clay It lays five or six eggs of a bluish green variegated with a few black spots    VARIETIES of the THROSTLE  The WHITE THROSTLE The sole difference consists in the whiteness of its plumage a quality which though commonly ascribed to the influence of the northern climates may be produced by accidental causes in the more temperate countries as we have remarked in the history of the Raven but this colour is not spread over the whole body nor is it pure The breast and neck are marked with the speckles peculiar to the Thrushes though far more dilute and faint the back is shaded with a mixture of brown and the breast tinged with rufous as in those figured by Frisch pl but without any description Sometimes none of the upper part of the body except the head is white as in that described by Aldrovandus at other times the lower part of the neck only is marked by a whitecrossbar like a half collar and in different individuals this colour certainly mingles variously with those proper to the speciesBut distinctions of that sort cannot form even permanent varieties  II The CRESTED THRUSH mentioned by Schwenckfeld must also be regarded as a variety of this species not only because it is of the same size and its plumage similar except  a whitish tuft formed like that of the Crested Lark and also its collar white but because it is very rare It may be even said that hitherto it is  unique  since Schwenckfeld is the only person who has seen it and that only once when it was caught in in the forests of the Dutchy of LignitzIt may be proper to mention that these birds have sometimes a crest formed in drying from the contraction of certain muscles of the skin which cover the head  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE THROSTLE  I The GUIANA THRUSH  La Grive de la Guyane  Buff  Turdus Guianensis  Gmel  THE coloured figure conveys nearly all the information which we possess with regard to this little bird Its tail is longer and its wings proportionably shorter than in the Throstle but its colours are nearly the same only the speckles are spread as far as the last of the inferior coverts of the tail  As the Throstle visits the countries of the north and is besides very fond of changing its residence it may have thence migrated into North America and penetrated towards the south where it would experience the alterations produced by the difference of climate and of food  Specific character of the  Turdus Guianensis    Above it is duskygreenish below okerywhite with black longitudinal streaks    II The LITTLE THRUSH  La Grivette d'Amerique  Buff  Turdus Minor  Gmel  Turdus Iliacus Carolinensis  Briss  Turdus Minimus  Klein  Merula Tusca  Sloane  This birds occurs not only in Canada but in Pennsylvania Carolina and as far as Jamaica it spends only the summer in the northern provinces though in the milder regions of the south it resides the whole year In Carolina it haunts the thickest woods contiguous to the swamps but in the hotter climate of Jamaica it retires to the forests that cover the mountains  The specimens described or figured by naturalists differ in the colours of their feathers of their bill and of their legs which would imply if they all belong to the same species that the plumage of the American Throstles is no less variable than those of Europe and that they all spring from a common stem This conjecture derives force from the numerous analogies which this bird has to the Thrushes in its shape in its port in its propensity to migrate and to feed upon berries in the yellow colour of its internal parts observed by Sloane and in the speckles  which appear on its breast but it seems the most nearly related to our Throstle and RedWing and a comparison of the points of similarity is necessary to determine the species to which it belongs  This bird is smaller than any of our Thrushes as in general are all the birds of America if compared with their archetypes in the old continent Like the RedWing it does not sing and has fewer speckles than that species and therefore than any of the genus like the RedWing also its flesh is delicateSo far the American Thrush resembles the RedWing but it has more numerous relations to our Throstle and in my opinion more decisive ones It has beards round the bill a sort of yellowish plate on the breast it readily settles and remains in a country which affords it subsistence its cry is like the winternotes of the Throstle and therefore unpleasant as generally are the cries of all birds that live in wild countries inhabited by savages Besides the Throstle and not the RedWing is found in Sweden whence it could easily migrate into America  This Throstle arrives in Pennsylvania in the month of May it continues there the whole of the summer during which time it hatches and raises its young Catesby tells us that few of these Throstles are seen in Carolina whether because a part only settle of what arrive or that as we have already observed they conceal themselves  in the woods They subsist on the berries of the holly of the whitethorn c  In the specimens described by Sloane the nostrils were wider and the feet longer than in those described by Catesby and Brisson Nor was their plumage the same and if these differences were constant we should have reason to conclude that they belong to another family or at least are a permanent variety of this species  Gmelin and Latham make the American and the Jamaica Throstle to be two different species The former  Turdus Minor  is thus characterized by Latham  It is duskyrufous the underside of its body variegated with blackish spots the upperpart of its throat its belly and its vent white  The specific character of the latter the  Turdus Jamaicensis  or  Jamaica Thrush    It is duskycinereous below white its throat striated longitudinally with brown its breast cinereous  N  o  THE REED THRUSH  III The REED THRUSH  In Latin it has been called  Junco    Cinclus    Turdus Palustris  MarshThrush  Passer Aquaticus  WaterSparrow in Italian  Passere d'Acqua  in the language of the American Indians  Atototloquichitl  according to Nieremberg  Acototloquichitl  according to Fernandez  Caracura  according to Laet▪ The French name  Rousserole  is derived from  rousse  the feminine of  roux  which denotes its rufous plumage    La Rousserole  Buff  Turdus Arundinaceus  Linn Gmel and Briss  Junco  Gesner Aldrov Ray and Will  This bird has been called the River Nightingale because the male chants night and  day while the female is employed in hatching and because it haunts wet places But though its song has a greater extent it is far from being so pleasant as that of the Nightingale It is commonly accompanied with a very brisk motion and a trembling of the whole body The bird climbs like the Creepers along the reeds and the low willows in search of insects which constitute its food  The habit of this bird in frequenting the marshes would seem to exclude it from the family of the Thrushes but it resembles them so much in its external form that Klein who saw one almost alive since it was killed in his presence doubts whether it could be referred to another genus He informs us that these birds inhabit the islands in the mouth of the Vistula and make their nest on the ground along the sides of the little hillocks covered with moss  It builds among the canes says Belon with small reedstraw and lays five or six eggs  He suspects that they pass the winter in the dense marshy forests  Belon at first supposed the ReedThrush to be a bird of passage but afterwards discovered the contrary  and he adds that the upperpart of their body is a rufous brown the lower of a dirty white with some ash spots the  bill black the inside of the mouth orange as in the Thrushes and the legs leadcoloured  An intelligent observer has assured me that he was acquainted in Brie with a small bird of this kind and vulgarly called  Effarvatte  which also prattles continually and lodges among the reeds like the other This reconciles the opposite opinions of Klein and Brisson with regard to the size of the ReedThrush the former maintaining that it is as large as a Throstle the latter that it does not exceed the Lark It flies heavily and flaps with its wings the feathers on its head are longer than the rest and form an indistinct crest  Sonnerat brought from the Philippines a true ReedThrush exactly

 lib ix  an error probably of the copyist or perhaps it attains to a greater size in Greece than with us  The Greeks and Romans considered the Thrushes as birds of passage  Aristot  Hist Anim  lib

viscus  was formerly made from the berries of the misletoe hence the Latin proverb  Turdus malum sibi cacat  that parasite plant being supposed to be propagated on the oak from the berries voided by the Missels Birdlime is now obtained by macerating the inner bark of holly    N  o  FIG THE MISSEL BIRD FIG THE THROSTLE  In Burgundy the Missels arrive in flocks about the months of September and October coming most probably from the mountains of Lorraine  Dr Lottinger of Sarbourg assures me that such of the Thrushes as remove from the mountains of Lorraine on the approach of winter depart in September and October and return in the months of March and April and that they breed in the forests with which the mountains are covered c This account agrees well with what we have given from our own observation But I must confess that another remark of that gentleman disagrees with one of a very intelligent ornithologist The latter M Hebert pretends that in Brie the Thrushes assemble at no time of the year whereas M Lottinger asserts that in Lorraine they always fly in flocks and in fact they seem to arrive in troops about Montbard as I have remarked Can their habits differ in different countries or in different times This is not altogether unexampled and I must add from a more particular observation that after the November passage is over those which remain in our districts live separately till the time of hatching in short that the assertions of these two observers may be true with certain restrictions  Part of them pursue their journey and depart always in numerous bodies in the beginning of winter while the rest remain till the month of March for some of them always continue during the summer both in Burgundy and in other provinces of France of Germany of Poland  Rzaczynski  c In Italy also and in England so many nestle that Aldrovandus saw the new brood sold in the markets and Albin regards the Missels as not birds of passage  The authors of the British Zoology are of the same opinion  Those  which remain lay and hatch successfully They build their nests sometimes in trees of a middling height and sometimes on the top of such as are extremely tall but always prefer those which are most covered with moss They construct both the inside and outside with herbage leaves and moss especially the white moss and their nest resembles more that of the Blackbird than of the other Thrushes except its being lined with bedding They lay four or five grayspotted eggs they feed their young with caterpillars worms slugs and even snails the shell of which they break The parents eat all sorts of berries during the summer cherries grapes olives the fruits of the cornel and the servicetrees and in winter they subsist upon the berries of the juniper of the holly of the ivy of the buckthorn upon beechmast sloes fennel and above all upon misletoe berries When disturbed they cry  tré    tré    tré  hence their name in the dialect of Burgundy  draine  and even some of the English names In the spring the females have no other notes but the males sitting on the tops of the trees sing charmingly and their warble consists of different airs that form a constantly varied succession In winter they are no longer heard The male differs not in external appearance from the female except that he has more black in his plumage  These birds are of a gentle pacific temper they never fight with one another but yet are anxious for their own safety They are more cautious even than the Blackbirds which are generally reckoned very shy and timorous for these are sometimes decoyed by the call while the Missels resist the allurement They are however caught sometimes in gins though less frequently than the Throstles or RedWings  Belon asserts that the flesh of the Missel which he calls the Great Thrush is of a superior flavour to that of the other species but this is contrary to the account of all other naturalists and to my own experience Our Missels live not indeed upon olives nor our small Throstles upon misletoeberries as those of which he speaks and it is well known how much the difference of food affects the quality of game  Specific character of the  Turdus Viscivorus    Its back is dusky its neck spotted with white its bill yellowish  The Minel Thrush resembles much the Throstle but the spots on its breast are large and round not elongated as in the latter and the inner coverts of its wings are white those of the Throstle yellow It is also of superior size for it is eleven inches long sixteen and a half broad and weighs near five ounces It builds its nest in bushes or in the sides of trees particularly the ash    VARIETY of the MISSEL THRUSH  The only variety I find in this species is the Whitish Missel noticed by Aldrovandus The quills of its tail and wings were of a light and almost whitish colour the head and all the upperpart of the body cinereous  We may remark in this variety the alteration of the colour of the quills of the wings and of the tail which are commonly supposed to be the least liable to change and as being of a deeper dye than the other feathers  I may add that there are always some Missels which breed in the Royal Garden on the leafless trees they seem to be very fond of yew berries and eat so plentifully of them that their excrements are red they are also attached to the fruit of the lote  In Provence the people have a sort of call with which they imitate the vernal song of the Missel Thrush and of the Throstle The person conceals himself in a green arbour from which he can see through a loophole a pole which he has fastened to a neighbouring tree the Thrushes are invited by the call and expecting to meet with their companions alight on the pole and fall by the shot of the fowler  The FIELDFARE  In Greek  which is also adopted in Latin in Italian  Viscada    Viscardo  I suspect these names to belong to the Missel Thrush in Spanish  Zorzol  in German  KrammetVogel    Ziemmer  in Swiss  Reckolter    Wecholter    Wachholderdrostel  in Polish  DrozdSrzedni    Kwiczot  in Danish  Dobbelt Kramsfugl  in Norwegian  Graae Trost    FieldTrost    Norden Vinds  ibe  in Swedish  Kramsfogel    Snoskata    La Litorne  Buff  Turdus Pilaris  Linn Gmel Gesner and Aldrov  Turdus Pilaris  seu  Turdela  Briss  THIS Thrush is the largest after the Missel and like it can hardly be decoyed by the call but may be caught by a noose It differs from the other Thrushes by the yellow colour of its bill the deeper brown of its legs and the cinereous sometimes variegated with black which spreads over its head behind its neck and upon its rump  The male and female have the same cry which will equally attract the wild Fieldfares in the season of migration  Frisch  But the female is distinguished from the male by the colour of her bill which is much duller These birds which breed in Poland and Lower Austria  Klein and Kramer  never nestle in France They arrive in flocks with the RedWing about the beginning of December and make a loud noise as they fly  Rzaczynski    They haunt the unploughed fields which are interspersed with juniper bushes and when they appear again in the spring  They arrive in England about the beginning of October and depart in the month of May  BRITISH ZOOLOGY  they prefer the wet meadows In general they inhabit the woods much less than the two preceding species Sometimes they make an early but transient appearance when the services are ripe of which they are very fond though they nevertheless return at the usual time  It is not an uncommon thing to see the Fieldfares assemble to the number of two or three thousand in a spot where there are ripe services which they devour with such voracity that they throw half of them on the ground After rains they frequently run along the ditches in search of worms and slugs In the time of hard frosts they live upon the haws of the whitethorn the berries of the misletoe and those of other plants  Lottinger    We may infer then that the Fieldfares are of a much more social disposition than the Throstles or the Missels They sometimes go single but for the most part they form as I have already remarked very numerous flocks fly in a body and spread through the meadows in search of food never losing sight of their society They all collect together upon the same tree at certain hours of the day or when at any time  they are alarmed at the near approach of a person  Linnaeus mentions a Fieldfare which was bred in the house of a winemerchant and became so familiar that it would run along the table and drink the wine out of the glasses it drank so much that it grew bald but being shut up in its cage and denied wine it recovered its plumage  Fauna Suecica  p  This little anecdote presents two remarkable facts the effect of wine upon the feathers of a bird and the instance of a tame Fieldfare which is very uncommon for the Thrushes cannot be as I have before said easily domesticated  The Fieldfares are the more numerous in proportion to the severity of the weather they seem to be even a sign of its continuance for the fowlers and those who live in the country judge that the winter is not over as long as the Fieldfares are heard They retire in summer into the northern countries where they breed and find abundance of junipers Frisch ascribes to this sort of food the excellent quality he discovered in their flesh I own that there is no disputing about tastes but I must say that in Burgundy this Thrush is reckoned very indifferent eating and that in general the flavour communicated by juniper is always somewhat bitter Others assert that the flesh of the Fieldfares is  never better or more succulent than when it feeds on worms and insects  The Fieldfare was known by the ancients under the name of  Turdus Pilaris  not because it has been always caught with a noose as Salerne says a quality which would not have distinguished it from the other Thrushes but because the hairs or black bristles round its bill which project forwards are longer in this species than in the Throstle or the Missel We may add that its claws are very strong as remarked in the British Zoology Frisch relates that if the young of the Missel be put in a Fieldfare's nest it will feed and educate them as its own but I would not thence infer as Frisch has done that we might expect to obtain an hybridous race for no person surely looks for a new breed between the hen and the drake though the hen often rears whole hatches of ducklings  Specific character of the Fieldfare  Turdus Pilaris    Its tailquills are black the outermost whitish at the tip of their inner margin the tail and rump hoary  It is ten inches long seventeen broad and weighs four ounces The Fieldfares never breed in Great Britain but arrive in flocks with the RedWings in the end of September and retire in the beginning of March but what is singular they appear for a fortnight about Michaelmas and again for about a week in April Linnaeus and Latham think that the Fieldfares were the Thrushes which the Romans fattened in their voleries  VARIETY of the FIELDFARE  The PIED or SPOTTED FIELDFARE It is variegated with white black and many other colours so distributed that except the head and the neck which are white spotted with black and the tail which is entirely black the dusky hues interspersed with white spots prevail on the upperpart of the body and on the contrary the light colours especially the white are spread over the lowerpart marked with black speckles most of which are shaped like small crescents This Fieldfare is of the ordinary size  We ought to refer to this the  Whiteheaded Fieldfare  of Brisson It has no black speckles and as its white is what alone distinguishes it from the common Fieldfare we may consider it as intermediate between that and the Spotted Fieldfare It is even natural to suppose that the change of plumage would begin at the head since the colour of that part varies in different individuals  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE FIELDFARE  I The CAYENNE FIELDFARE  Turdus Cayanensis  Gmel  The Cayenne Thrush  Lath  IREFER this Thrush to the Fieldfare because it appears to be more closely related to that species than to any other by the colour of the upperpart of its body and of its legs It differs in many respects from the whole genus its breast and the underpart of its body are not so distinctly dappled its plumage is more extensively variegated though in a different manner almost all the feathers of the upper and underside of the body being edged with a lighter colour which marks nicely their shape and lastly the lower mandible is scalloped near the pointand these differences are sufficient to constitute it a distinct species till we are better acquainted with its habits and dispositions  Specific character of the  Turdus Cayanensis    It is cinereous below partly white the greater coverts of its wings and the quills black the upperpart of the throat the bill and the legs black  It is of the size of the Throstle being eight inches long    II The CANADA FIELDFARE  Turdus Migratorius  Linn Gmel and Klein  Turdus Canadensis  Briss  The Fieldfare of Carolina  Catesby  The Redbreasted Thrush  Penn and Lath  Fieldfare is the name which Catesby applies to the Thrush described and figured in his Natural History of Carolina and I adopt it the more readily since that species spends at least a part of the year in Sweden and could thence migrate into the New World and produce other varieties In the Canada Fieldfare the orbits are white there is a spot of the same colour between the eye and the bill the upperpart of the body is brown the under orange before and variegated behind with dirty white and rusty brown shaded with a greenish tinge there are also some speckles under its throat whose ground colour is white In winter it advances in numerous flocks from the northern parts of America to Virginia and Carolina and returns in the spring It resembles our Fieldfare in this circumstance but it sings better  We must remember that the song of a bird cannot be known unless it be heard in the season of love and that the Fieldfare never breeds in our climates  Catesby says that it has a  sharp note like the Guy Thrush or Missel He also tells us that one of these Canada Fieldfares having discovered the first privet that was planted in Virginia took so great a liking to the fruit that it remained all the summer Catesby was informed that these birds breed in Maryland where they remain the whole year  Specific character of the  Turdus Migratorius    It is gray its belly rufous its eyelids white the outermost tailquill white at its inner tip  The Redbreasted Thrushes seem to traverse the wholeextent of North America In Hudson's Bay they appear in pairs about the beginning of May at Moose Fort they nestle and hatch in fourteen days at Severn Settlement four degrees farther north they require twentysix In the State of NewYork they arrive in February lay their eggs in May and retire southwards in October They live upon worms insects the seeds of the sassafras shrub and various sorts of berries Their nest is composed of roots moss c The male is assiduous in aiding his mate during incubation She lays four or five eggs of a fine seagreen  III The REDWING  In Italian  Malvizzo    Tordosacello    Cion    Cipper  in Spanish  Malvis  in German  Weindrostel  Winethrostle  Rothdrostel  Redthrostle  Heidedrostel  Heaththrostle  Pfiefdrostel  Pipethrostle  Behemle    Boemerlin

Gesner  Turdus Illas  seu  Tylas  Aldrov  The RedWing    Swinepipe  or  Wind Thrush  Will  This small Thrush is the most useful of them all since it is the best to eat especially in Burgundy where its flesh is delicious  Linnaeus asserts the contrary  Syst Nat  p This difference between one country and another depends probably on that of the quality of the food or perhaps on that of tastes  Besides it is oftener caught in the noose than any other and is therefore the most valuable species both for its quantity and its quality  Frisch and the fowler  assert that it is not easily taken with nooses when they are mad  of white or of black hairs in Burgundy  made of these two sorts twisted together  It generally appears the second that is after the Throstle and before the Fieldfare and it arrives in large bodies in November and departs before Christmas It breeds in the woods near Dantzic  Klein    but seldom or never settles in our provinces or in Lorraine where it arrives in April and retires about the end of the same month and appears not again till autumn though that country affords abundance of proper food in its vast forests It halts there a certain time at least and does not as Frisch asserts remove merely into some parts of Germany Its common food is berries and small worms which it finds by scraping the ground It is distinguished from the other Thrushes by its feathers being more glossy and shining its bill and eyes of a deeper black than the Throstle whose size it approaches and by its having fewer speckles on the breast It is also remarkable for the orange colour under its wing a circumstance which has occasioned its being called in several languages  Redwinged Thrush  Its ordinary cry is  tan    tan    kan    kan  and when it perceives a fox its natural enemy it leads him off to a great distance as do also the Blackbirds repeating always the same notes Most naturalists remark that it never sings but this assertion needs to be qualified and we can only say that it is seldom heard to sing in countries where it does not appear in the season of love as in France England c An excellent observer M Hebert has informed me that he has witnessed its chanting in the spring in Brie twelve or fifteen of them sat on a tree and warbled like linnets Another observer who lives  in the south of Provence tells me that the RedWing only whistles which it does incessantly we may infer therefore that it does not breed in that country  Aristotle mentions it by the name of  Ilian Thrush  as being the smallest and the least spotted of the Thrushes  Aristotle  Hist Anim  lib ix  This epithet seems to imply that it was brought into Greece from the coasts of Asia where once stood  Ilium  the city of Troy  I have traced an analogy between this species and the Fieldfare They are both foreign and only visit our climate twice a year  In natural History as in many other subjects general observations always admit of exceptions Though for the most part the RedWing does not spend the winter in our climates I am assured by M Hebert that he killed one year in a hard frost several dozens on a whitethorn which was still loaded with its berries  they assemble in numerous flocks at certain hours to chirp together they are similarly marked with speckles on the breast But the RedWing is also related to the Throstle its flesh is not inferior in quality the undersurface of its wing is yellow but more lively indeed and of an orange tinge it often occurs single in the woods and visits the vineyards like the Throstle with which Lottinger has observed it often to fly in company especially in the spring From the whole it appears that this species is furnished with the means of subsisting of the other two  and that in many respects it may be regarded as forming the shade between the Throstle and the Fieldfare  Specific character of the  Turdus Iliacus    Its wings are ferruginous its eyelids whitish  It is smaller than the Fieldfare and nearly nine inches long It breeds in the north of Europe in hedges and bushes and lays six eggs of a bluish green spotted with black  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE THRUSHES AND BLACKBIRDS  I The BARBARY THRUSH  Termed  Bassette  on account of its short legs    La Grive Bassette de Barbarie  Buff  Turdus Barbaricus  Gmel  The Greek Thrush  Shaw  IT resembles the Thrushes in its general shape in its bill and the streaks on its breast dispersed regularly upon a white ground in short by all the exterior characters except its legs and its wings Its legs are not only shorter but stronger in which it is opposite to the  Hoamy  and seems to resemble somewhat our Missel which has its legs shorter in proportion than the other three species With regard to the plumage it is extremely beautiful the prevailing colour on the upperpart of the body including the head and the tail is a light brilliant green and the rump is tinged with a fine yellow as also the extremity of the coverts of the tail and  of the wings of which the quills are of a less vivid colour But this enumeration of the colours were it even more complete will by no means give a just idea of the effect which they produce in the bird itself a pencil and not words can exhibit its beauty Dr Shaw who saw this Thrush in its native country compares its plumage to that of the richest birds of America he adds that it is not very common and appears only in the season when the figs are ripe This would shew that these fruits direct its migration and in this single fact I perceive two analogies betweeen this bird and the Thrushes both birds of passage and both excessively fond of figs  Specific character of the  Turdus Barbaricus    It is green its breast spotted with white its rump and the tip of its tail yellow    II The REDLEGGED THRUSH  Le Tilly  ou  La Grive Cendree d'Amerique  Buff  Turdus Plumbeus  Linn and Gmel  Merula Americana Cinerea  Briss  Turdus Thilius  Molin  Merula Tilli  Feuillée  All the upperpart of the body of this bird its head and neck are of a deep ashcolour  which extends over the small coverts of the wings and passing under the body rises on the one hand as far as the throat without suffering any change and on the other descends to the lower belly shading however gradually into white which is also the colour of the coverts under the tail The throat too is white but dappled with black the quills and the great coverts of the wings are blackish and edged exteriorly with cinereous The twelve quills of the tail are tapered and blackish like those of the wing but the three outer ones on each side are terminated by a white spot which is the larger the nearer it is to the margin The iris the orbits the bill and the legs are red the space between the eye and the bill black and the palate tinged with a vivid orange  The total length is about ten inches its alar extent near fourteen its tail four its leg eighteen lines its bill twelve its weight two ounces and a half lastly its wings when closed do not reach the middle of the tail  This bird is subject to variety for in the one observed by Catesby the bill and throat were black May we not ascribe this difference of colours to sex Catesby only says that the male is a third smaller than the female he adds that these birds feed on the berries of the tree which produces gum elemi  It is found in Carolina and according to Brisson it is very common in the islands of Andros and Ilathera  III The SMALL THRUSH of the Philippines  Turdus Philippensis  Gmel  The Philippine Thrush  Lath  We owe this to Sonnerat The forepart of its neck and breast are dappled with white upon a rufous ground the rest of the lowerpart of the body is dirty white bordering on yellow and the upperpart of the body is of a deep brown with an olive tinge  The size of this bird is inferior to that of the RedWing we cannot ascertain its alar extent since the wingquills in the specimen which we have observed are incomplete  IV The HOAMY of China  Turdus Sinensis  Linn and Gmel  The Chinese Thrush  Lath  Brisson is the first who has described this bird or rather the female of it This female is somewhat  smaller than a RedWing which it resembles as well as the Throstle and still more the Canada Thrush its legs being proportionably longer than in the other Thrushes they are yellowish as is the bill the upperpart of the body is of a brown bordering upon refous the under of a light and uniform rufous the head and neck are striped longitudinally with brown the tail is also of the same colour only barred transversely  Such is nearly the description of the external appearance of this bird but we are not informed with regard to its instincts and habits If it be really a Thrush as it is said its breast is like that of the Red Thrush not dappled  V The LITTLE THRUSH of St Domingo  This Thrush is in point of smallness like the American Thrush its head is ornamented with a sort of crown or cap of bright orange verging upon red  The specimen figured by Edwards Pl differs from ours in not being dappled under the belly It was caught in November at sea eight or ten leagues off the island of St Domingo which led Edwards to suppose that it was one of those birds of passage which every  year leave the continent of North America on the approach of winter and depart from the Cape of Florida in quest of milder seasons This conjecture was verified Bartram informed Edwards that these birds arrived in Pennsylvania in the month of April and remained there during the whole summer He added that the female built its nest on the ground or rather in heaps of dry leaves where it formed a sort of excavation that it lined it with grass and always chose the slope of a hill facing the south and that it layed four or five eggs spotted with brown Such differences in the colour of the eggs in that of the plumage and in the mode of nestling seem to point at a nature distinct from that of our European Thrushes  VI The LITTLE CRESTED OUZEL of China  I place this bird between the Thrushes and the Ouzels or Blackbirds because it has the port and the ground colours of the Thrushes but without the dapples which we may consider in general as the distinctive character of that genus The feathers on the crown of the head are longer than the rest and the bird can erect them into a crest It has a rosecolour  mark behind the eye another more considerable of the same colour but not so bright under the tail and its legs are of a reddish brown Its size is nearly that of the Lark and its wings which when displayed extend ten inches scarcely reach when closed to the middle of the tail The tail consists of twelve tapered quills Brown more or less deep is the prevailing colour of the upperpart of the body including the wings the crest and the head but the four lateral quills on either side of the tail are tipt with white The underpart of the body is of this last colour with some tints of brown over the breast I must not forget two blackish streaks which rising from the corners of the bill and extending over a white ground make a kind of mustachoe which has a remarkable effect  The MOCKING BIRDS  Les Moqueurs  Buff  EVERY remarkable bird has always many names but if it be at the same time a native of a foreign climate this embarrassing multitude disgraceful to Natural History is increased by the confusion of species Such is the case with the American Mocking Birds It is easy to perceive that Brisson's Mocking Bird and the Cinereous Blackbird of St Domingo  Pl Enl  No both belong to the same species the only difference being that the former has somewhat less of the gray colour in the underside of the body than the latter It will also appear from comparison that Brisson's Blackbird of St Domingo is likewise the same distinguished only by some lighter or deeper tints on its plumage and its tailquills which are hardly at all tapered In like manner we shall find that the  Tzonpan  of Fernandez is either the female of the  Cencontlatolli  that is of the Mocking Bird as Fernandez himself suspects or at least a permanent variety of that species  Historia Avium Novae Hispaniae  cap xx  Nieremberg calls it  Tzanpan    Hist Nat lib x cap  and Edwards  Tzaupan    It is true that its plumage is less uniform being mixed above with white black and brown and below with white black and cinereous but the fundamental colour is the same as also its size its general shape its song and climate We may say the same of the  Tetzonpan  and  Centzonpantli  of Fernandez  Cap cxv  for in the short mention which that author has made of it features of analogy are to be met with in size in colour and in song and no instance of disparity occurs Besides the resemblance between the names  Tzonpan    Tetzonpan    Centzonpantli  seems to shew that they mark a single species and that the diversity has arisen from the mistake of the transcriber or the difference of the Mexican dialectsLastly we can scarcely hesitate to admit among the species the bird called by Brisson the  Great Mocking Bird  and which he says is the same with Sloane's Mocking Bird though according to the dimensions given by Sloane this is the smallest of the kind but Sloane regards it as the  Cencontlatolli  of Fernandez which Brisson makes his ordinary Mocking Bird But Brisson has himself without perceiving it admitted the position which I hold for he quotes two passages from Ray which applied to the same bird and refers one to his great and the other to his small species The only difference between the two is that the great Mocking Bird has a  somewhat browner plumage and longer legs  The expression of Sloane is somewhat ambiguous he says that its legs and feet are an inch and three quarters long Does he mean the leg with the tarsus or the tarsus with the toes Brisson understood it to signify the tarsus alone This last is certainly the usual meaning of the  leg  of a bird in English and accordingly we have translated the French  pied  by  leg Tr    and its describers have taken no notice of its tapered tail  After this reduction there remains only two species of Mocking Birds  viz  The French Mocking Bird and the Ordinary Mocking Bird I shall treat of them in the order I have named them as it is nearly that of their relation to the Thrushes  The FRENCH MOCKING BIRD  Turdus Rufus  Linn Gmel and Klein  Turdus Carolinensis  Briss  Foxcoloured Thrush  Catesby and Penn  The Ground MockingBird  Lawson  The Ferruginous Thrush  Lath  None of the American Mocking Birds resembles so much our Thrushes in the speckles on the breast as this but it differs widely from them in the proportions between the tail and wings these ending when closed almost where the tail begins The tail is more than four inches long which exceeds the third of the whole length of the bird that being only eleven  inches Its size is intermediate between that of the Missel and the Fieldfare Its eyes are yellow its bill blackish its legs brown and all the upperpart of the body of a fox colour but with a mixture of brown These two colours also predominate on the wingquills though separately the rufous on the outer webs the brown on the inner The great and middle coverts of the wings are tipt with white which forms two streaks that cross the wings obliquely  The underside of the body is dirty white spotted with a dusky brown but these spots are more straggling than in our Thrushes the tail is tapered somewhat drooping and entirely rufous The song of the French Mocking Bird has some variety but not comparable to that of the proper Mocking Bird  It feeds commonly on a kind of black cherries which are very different from those of Europe since they hang in clusters It remains all the year in Carolina and Virginia and consequently is not at least in those provinces a bird of passageanother analogous circumstance to our Thrushes  Specific character of the  Turdus Rufus    It is rufous below partly spotted with white its wingquills of an uniform colour its tail rounded and rufous  It inhabits North America appears in NewYork in May and retires southwards in August It builds in low bushes and lays five eggs thick spotted with ferruginous It is much inferior in the variety of its notes to the true Mocking Bird    The MOCKING BIRD  Turdus Polyglottus  Linn and Gmel  Mimus Major  Briss  The American Nightingale    Song Thrush  or  Gray Mocking Bird  Sloane  The Mocking Bird  Catesby  The Mimic Thrush  Penn and Lath  We have here a striking exception to the general remark made by travellers that in proportion as the plumage of the birds in the New World are rich elegant and splendid so their notes are harsh raucous and monotonous The Mocking Bird is on the contrary if we believe Fernandez Nieremberg and the native Americans the sweetest chorister of the feathered race not excepting the Nightingale It equals that charming bird in the melody of its song but it possesses besides the power of imitating the cries of other animals hence is derived its name Nor is it satisfied with barely reechoing the sounds It gives them softness and grace Accordingly the savages have bestowed upon it the appellation of  cencontlatolli  that is four hundred languages and the learned have employed the epithet  polyglot  But the Mocking Bird mingles action with its song and its measured movements accompany and express the succession of its emotions Its prelude is to rise slowly with expanded wings and soon  sink back to the same spot its head hanging downwards Its action now corresponds with the varied nature of its music If the notes are brisk and lively it describes in the air a number of circles crossing each other or it ascends and descends continually in a spiral line If they are loud and rapid it with equal briskness flaps its wings Is its song unequal it flutters it bounds Do its tones soften by degrees melt into tender strains and die away in a pause more charming than the sweetest melody it gently diminishes its action glides smoothly above its tree till the wavings of its wings begin to be imperceptible at least cease and the bird remains suspended and motionless in the air  The plumage of this American Nightingale by no means corresponds with the beauty of its song the colours are very ordinary and have neither brilliancy nor variety The upperside of the body is a grayish brown the upperside of the wings and of the tail are still of a deeper brown only it is interrupted on the wings by a white mark which crosses it obliquely near the middle of its length and sometimes a few small white speckles are scattered on the forepart On the tail by an edging of the same white colour and lastly on the head with a circle of the same which forms a sort of crown  Fernandez  and extending over the eyes appears like two distinct eyelids The underside of the body  is white from the throat as far as the end of the tail We perceive in the figure given by Edwards a few dapples some on the sides of the neck and others on the white of the great coverts under the wings  The Mocking Bird approaches the RedWing in size its tail is somewhat tapered  This appears not in Sloane's figure  and its feet are blackish its bill is of the same colour and with long bristles that grow above the angles of its opening lastly its wings are shorter than those of our Thrushes but longer than those of the French Mocking Bird  It is found in Carolina Jamaica New Spain c It in general loves the hot climates but can subsist in the temperate In Jamaica it is very common in the savannas of the woody parts of the island it perches on the highest branches and chants its song It often builds its nest on the ebony trees Its eggs are spotted with brown It feeds on cherries and the berries of the whitethorn and cornel tree  The Dogwood  Cornus Florida  Linn  and even on insects Its flesh is esteemed excellent It is not easily raised in a cage but this may be accomplished by care and kind treatment It is besides a familiar bird which seems to be fond of man approaches his dwellings and even perches on the chimney tops  In the subject which Sloane dissected the stomach was a little muscular the liver whitish and  the intestines were folded in a vast number of circumvolutions  Specific character of the American Mocking Bird  Turdus Polyglottus  LINN  It is of a dull ashcolour below paleash the primary wingquills white in their outer half  In the northern provinces of America as NewYork they appear only during the summer In the warmer parts of the continent they sing incessantly by night and day from March to August They often breed in fruittrees but are shy during the time of incubation They lay five or six eggs which are blue thickly spotted with rufous  There is a smaller kind of Mocking Bird which has obtained the following appellations from naturalists  Turdus Orpheus  Linn and Gmel  Mimus  Briss  Avis Polyglotta  Will  The Lesser Mocking Bird  Edw  The Mocking Thrush  Lath  Its specific character  Its back is dusky its breast and its lateral tailquills are whitish its eyebrows white  The BLACKBIRD  In Greek  or  also  the Latire name  Merula  is derived by Varro from  Mera    mere    alone    solitary  which denotes the retired disposition of the bird in Italian  Merlo  in Spanish  Mierla  in Portuguese  Melroa  in German  Schwartze Amsel  Black Ouzel in Flemish  Merlaer    Meerel  in Swedish  Kohltrost  in Danish and Norweglan  Solsort    Le Merle  Buff  Turdus Merula  Linn and Gmel  Merula  Belon Gesner Briss c  THE adult male of this species is of a deeper and purer black than the Raven and hence its English name Indeed except the orbits the talons and the sole of the foot which have always a yellow cast it is entirely black in every position In the female on the contrary the same decided black is not spread through the whole of the plumage it is mixed with different shades of brown ferruginous and gray the bill is but seldom yellow and the song is different from that of the maleall these circumstances combined have made it be mistaken for a bird of another species  The Blackbirds are distinguished from the Thrushes not only by the colour of their plumage and the different livery of the male and of the female but by their song and their natural habits They never fly in flocks like the  N  o  THE BLACKBIRD  Thrushes and though they are more savage with regard to each other they are less so with regard to man for they are more easily tamed and live nearer the hamlets They are also reckoned very crafty because they have a quick sight to descry the fowler at a distance and shun his approach But if we study their nature more closely we shall find that they are more restless than cunning more timorous than suspicious since they allow themselves to be caught with birdlime with nooses and with all sorts of snares provided the hand which sets these be concealed  When they are shut up with other birds their natural inquietude degenerates into petulance they pursue and continually harass their companions in slavery and for that reason they cannot be admitted into voleries where several kinds of small birds are kept  They may be raised apart for the sake of their song not indeed on account of their natural music which is hardly tolerable except in the fields but because they have a facility of improving their notes and of learning others of imitating tones of different instruments  Olina  Uccelliera  p  and even the human voice  Olina  Ibid    Philostrat  Vita Apollonii  lib vii    Gesner  De Avibus  p    As the Blackbirds like the Thrushes early engage in love they soon begin to warble and  as they have more than one hatch they chant before the vernal warmth and continue their strain when the other songsters of the grove droop in silence This circumstance hasled some to fancy that they never suffer any change of plumage but such a supposition is neither true nor probable  The blackbirds thrushes and stares lose not their feathers  PLINY lib x  They are found in the woods towards the end of the summer in moult some having their head entirely bald Olina and the author of the British Zoology say that like the other birds it is silent during that time the latter adds that sometimes it renews its song in the beginning of winter but most commonly it has in that season only a harsh discordant cry  The ancients pretended that in winter its plumage changed into rufous  Ibid lib x  and Olina one of the moderns the best acquainted with the birds which he describes says that this happens in autumn whether it be because this alteration of colour is the effect of moulting or that the females and the young Blackbirds which really incline to rufous rather than to black are then more numerous and oftener seen than the adult males  These birds make their first hatch in the end of winter it consists of five or six eggs of a bluish green with frequent and indistinct spots  of a rust colour This first hatch seldom prospers because of the severity of the weather the second succeeds better though it is only of four or five eggs The Blackbirds nest is constructed nearly like that of the Thrushes except that it is lined with a matting It is commonly placed in bushes or trees of a moderate height They would seem naturally disposed to place it near the ground and experience alone of the danger of such a situation instructs them to give it some elevation  I have diligently examined a nest found near the ground in a place overgrown with thorns  GESNER  A Blackbird observing that a cat ate its two first hatches in its nest at the bottom of a hedge made a third on an appletree eight feet high  SALERNE  A nest was brought to me only once which had been found in the trunk of a hollow peartree  Moss which always occurs on the trunk and mud which is to be found at the foot of the tree or in its neighbourhood are the materials that form the body of the nest Stalks of grass and small roots are the softer substances with which they line it and they labour with such assiduity that in eight days they complete the work The female hatches alone and the male is no farther concerned than in providing her subsistence The Author of the  Treatise on the Nightingale  affirms that he has seen a young Blackbird of the same year but already strong cheerfully engage in rearing the infant  brood of its own species but he does not inform us of its sex  I have remarked that the young drop their feathers more than once the first year and that at each time the plumage of the male becomes blacker and the bill yellower beginning at its base With regard to the females they retain as I have said the colours of infancy as they also retain most of its qualities However the inside of their mouth and throat is yellow like the males and in both may be perceived a frequent motion of the tail upwards and downwards with a slight shudder of the wings accompanied by a feeble broken cry  These birds do not leave the country in winter  Many people assert that they leave Corsica about the th of February and return not till October but M Artier Royal Professor of Philosophy at Bastia doubts the fact because in that island they can always enjoy the proper temperature in cold weather in the plains and in the sultry seasons in the mountains He adds that there is always abundance of food berries of all kinds grapes and particularly olives which in Corsica are not entirely gathered till the end of April Lottinger believes that the males pass the winter in Lorraine but that the females remove to a little distance in severe weather  but choose situations the best sheltered settling commonly in the thickest woods especially when these are supplied with perennial springs and consist of evergreens such as pines firs laurels cypresses myrtles junipers which both afford them subsistence and protect them from the rigour of the season They sometimes seek for cover and food in our gardens  The wild Blackbirds feed on all sorts of berries fruits and insects and as no country is so sterile as not to afford some of these and as the Blackbird is reconciled to all climates it is found in almost every part of the world but varying according to the impressions which it receives  Those which are kept in the cage eat flesh also either dressed or minced bread c but it is said that the kernels of pomegranates prove poisonous to them as to the Thrushes They are very fond of bathing and they must have plenty of water in the voleries Their flesh is good and not inferior to that of the Missel or the Fieldfare and seems even to be preferred to that of the Throstle and of the RedWing in countries where it can require a succulence from the olives and a perfume from the myrtleberries The birds of prey are as fond of feasting on them as man and commit an equal havoc without that their multiplication would be excessive Olina fixes their period of life at seven or eight years  I dissected a female which was taken on its eggs about the th of May and which weighed two ounces and two gros In the  ovarium  was a cluster consisting of a great number of unequal sized eggs the largest two lines in diameter and of an orange colour the smallest were of a lighter colour and of a substance less opaque and about onethird of a line in diameter Its  bill was quite yellow also the tongue and the whole inside of the mouth the intestinal tube seventeen or eighteen inches long the gizzard very muscular and preceded by a bag formed by the dilatation of the  oesophagus  the gall bladder oblong and the  coecum  wanting  Specific character of the Blackbird  Turdus Merula    It is black its bill and eyelids are yellow  It builds earlier than any other bird its nest is formed with moss withered grass leaves c lined with clay over which is spread some hay  VARIETIES of the BLACKBIRD  THOSE THAT ARE WHITE OR SPOTTED WITH WHITE  The plumage of the Blackbird is subject like that of the Raven the Crow the Jackdaw and other birds to great changes from the influence of the climate or from the action of less obvious causes In fact white seems to be in most animals what it is in many plants the colour into which all the others and even the black degenerate by a quick transition and without passing through the intermediate shades  The only varieties of this sort which appear to belong to the common Blackbird are the White one which was sent to Aldrovandus at Rome and the Whiteheaded one of the same author Both these have the yellow bill and feet of the ordinary species  N  o  THE RINGOUZEL  The RING OUZEL  In Italian  Merula Alpestro  or Crag Blackbird in German  RingAmsel    RotzAmsel  snotty or filthy Ouzel because it feeds sometimes on the maggots found in horsedung  Wald Amsel  Wood Ouzel  SteinAmsel    BergAmsel  Mountain Ouzel  SchneeAmsel  Snow Ouzel    Le Merle a Plastron Blanc  Buff  Turdus Torquatus  Linn and Gmel  Merula Torquata  Briss Ray and Will  THIS species is marked above the breast with a horseshoe which in the male is of a very bright white but in the female is of a dirty tawny colour and as the rest of the female's plumage is a rufous brown the horseshoe appears much less distinct and is sometimes entirely obscured  WILLUGHBY  Hence some nomenclators have imagined that the female belonged to a particular species which they termed  The Mountain Blackbird  The Ring Ouzel much resembles the common Blackbird the ground colour of their plumage is black the corners and the inside of their bill yellow they are nearly of the same size and the same port but the former distinquished by the horseshoe by the white enamel of its plumage chiefly on the breast belly and wings  Willughby saw at Rome one of these birds which had its horseshoe gray and all its feathers edged with the same colour He judged it was a young bird or a female  by its bill which is shorter and not  so yellow by the shape of the middlequills of the wings which are square at the end with a small projecting point in the centre formed by the extremity of the shaft lastly by its cry  This cry in autumn is  crr    crr    crr  but a person of veracity assured Gesner that he heard this Ouzel sing in the spring and very agreeably  which is different as also its habits and dispositions It is a real bird of passage though its route cannot be precisely traced It follows the chain of the mountains but does not keep in any certain track  It does not appear every year in Silesia according to Schwenckfeld this is also the case in certain cantons of Burgundy  It seldom appears in the neighbourhood of Montbard except in the beginning of October when it arrives in small bodies of twelve or fifteen and never in larger numbers These seem to be a few families that have straggled from the great body they seldom stay more than two or three weeks and on the slightest frost entirely disappear But I must own that Klein informs us that these birds were brought to him alive in winter They repass about April or May at least in Burgundy Brie  M Hebert assures me that in Brie where he has fowled much at all seasons he killed a great number of these Ouzels in the months of April and May and that he never chanced to meet with any in the month of October In Burgundy on the contrary they seem less rare in autumn than in spring  and even in Silesia and in Frisia according to Gesner  It is uncommon for the Ring Ouzels to inhabit the plains in the temperate part of Europe  yet Salerne affirms that their nests have been found in Sologne and in the forest of Orleans that these nests were not constructed like those of the ordinary Blackbird that they contained five eggs of the same size and colour a circumstance different from what happens in the Blackbirds that these birds breed in the ground at the foot of bushes and hence probably they are called  BushBirds  or  Terrier Blackbirds  Merles Terriers  ou  Bouissonniers  Certain it is that in some seasons of the year they are very frequent on the lofty mountains of Sweden of Scotland of Auvergne of Savoy of Switzerland of Greece c It is even probable that they are spread in Asia and in Africa as far as the Azores for this species so social so fond of dwelling in mountains and having its plumage marked with white corresponds well to what Tavernier says of the flocks of Blackbirds which pass from time to time on the frontiers of Media and Armenia and rid the country of grasshoppers It also agrees with the account which Adanson gives of those Blackbirds spotted with white which he saw on the summits of the mountains in the island of Fayal keeping in flocks among the arbutes on the fruit of which they fed chattering continually  Voyage au Senegal    Those which ramble in Europe subsist likewise on berries Willughby found in their stomach  vestiges of insects and berries resembling goodseberries but they prefer those of ivy and grapes It is in the season of vintage that they are generally so fat and their flesh so savoury and succulent  Some fowlers say that the Ring Ouzels attract the Thrushes they remark too that they allow themselves to be more easily approached than the common Blackbirds though they are more difficult to decoy into snares  I found on dissection that their gallbladder is oblong very small and consequently quite different from what Willughby describes it to be but the situation and form of the soft parts it is well known are very subject to vary in animals The ventricle was muscular its inner coat wrinkled as usual and inadhesive In this membrane I saw fragments of juniper berries and nothing else The intestinal canal measured between its two extreme orifices was about twenty inches the ventricle or gizzard was placed between the fourth and fifth of its length Lastly I perceived some traces of  caecum  of which one appeared to be double  Specific character of the RingOuzel  Turdus Torquatus  LINN  It is blackish with a white collar its bill yellowish  It is larger than the Blackbird being eleven inches long and seventeen broad It inhabits the mountainous parts of this island in small bodies of five or six  The  Merula Saxatilis  or the  Rock Ouzel  is reckoned by Latham the young of the RingOuzel from which it differs chiefly by the dulness of its colours  VARIETIES of the RINGOUZEL  I THOSE WHICH ARE WHITE OR SPOTTED WITH WHITE  Aristotle was acquainted with White Ouzels and made them a distinct species though they have the same song and the same bulk with the common Ouzel or Blackbird but he knew that their instincts were different since they preferred the mountains  They are frequent about Cyllene in Arcadia and breed no where else  Hist Anim  lib ix  and these are the only distinctive characters which Belon admits  He says expressly that the White Ouzel never descends into the plains  They are found not only in the mountains of Arcadia of Savoy and of Auvergne but also in those of Silesia and among the Alps and Appennines c  WILLUGHBY  They are also birds of passage and migrate with the RingOuzel at the same season The white colour of the horseshoe in the RingOuzel may extend over the rest of the plumage I should therefore conceive that these though usually referred to the Blackbirds belong really to the RingOuzels In the white one which I observed the quills of the wings and tail were whiter than any of the rest and the upperpart of the body except  the top of the head was of a lighter gray than the under The bill was brown with a little yellow on the edges there was also yellow under the throat and on the breast and the legs were of a deep gray brown It was caught in the vicinity of Montbard in the beginning of November before the frost that is at the exact time of the passage of the RingOuzel for a few days before two of that species were brought to me  In those which are spotted the white is combined variously with the black sometimes it is confined to the quills of the wings and tail which are commonly supposed to be least subject to change of colour  ALDROVANDUS  sometimes it forms a collar that encircles the neck but is not so broad as the white horseshoe of the RingOuzel This variety did not escape Belon who says that he saw in Greece in Savoy and in the valley of Maurienne a great number of collared Blackbirds so called on account of a white line which bent quite round the neck Lottinger who had an opportunity of observing these birds in the mountains of Lorraine where they sometimes breed informs me that they commence breeding very early that they construct and place their nest nearly like the Thrush that the education of their young is completed before the end of June that they retire every year but that the time of their departure is not fixed that this usually begins  about the end of July and lasts the whole of August during which time not one is seen in the plain a proof that they follow the chain of the mountains but their retreat is uncertain Lottinger adds that this bird which formerly was very common in the Vosges is now seldom found there  II The GREAT MOUNTAIN OUZEL  It is spotted with white has no horseshoe and is larger than the Missel It arrives in Lorraine about the end of autumn and is then excessively fat The birdcatchers seldom succeed with it it feeds upon snails and is dexterous in breaking the shells When these fail it subsists on ivyberries It is excellent eating its strains far inferior to those of the Blackbird are harsh and dismal  I am indebted for these facts to Dr Lottinger    The ROSECOLOURED OUZEL  In Spanish  Tordos  in German  HaarkopfigeDrossel  Hairheaded Thrush    Le Merle Couleur de Rose  Buff  Turdus Roseus  Linn and Gmel  Merula Rosea  Briss Ray and Will  Sturnus Roseus  Scopoli  The Rose  or  Carnationcoloured Ouzel  Penn  ALL the ornithologists who have taken notice of this bird mention it as very rare as foreign and little known that it is seen only in its passage and the country to which it belongs is uncertain Linnaeus tells us indeed that it inhabits Lapland and Switzerland but he says nothing with regard to its instincts and mode of life Aldrovandus who first described this bird only remarks that it appears sometimes in the plains near Bologna where it is known by the birdcatchers under the name of  SeaStare    Storno Marino  that it sits on the dunghills grows very fat and is excellent eating Two birds of this kind were found in England and Edwards supposes that they were driven thither by the violence of the wind We have observed several in Burgundy which had been caught in their passage and it is probable that they pursue their excursions as far as Spain if what Klein says be  N  o  THE ROSE COLOURED THRUSH  true that they have a name in the Spanish language  The plumage of the male is remarkable its head and neck and the quills of its wings and of its tail are black with brilliant reflexions which play between green and purple The belly the back the rump and the small coverts of the wings are of a rose colour which has two tints the one light the other deep with a few black spots scattered here and there on a kind of scapulary which descends above as far as the tail and below to the abdomen Besides its head is ornamented with a sort of crest which reclines like that of the Chatterer and which must have a fine effect when the bird erects it  The lower belly the inferior coverts of the tail and the thighs are of a brown colour the tarsus and the toes of a dirty orange the bill partly black and partly fleshcoloured But the distribution of these colours seems not fixed in that part for in the subjects which we have observed and in those of Aldrovandus the base of the bill was blackish and all the rest of a flesh colour whereas in those examined by Edwards the point of the bill exhibited the black which changed by degrees into a dirty orange on the base of the bill and on the legs The underside of the tail seemed marbled the effect produced by the colour of its lower coverts which are blackish and tipt with white  In the female the head is black like that of the male but not the neck nor the quills of the tail and of the wings which are of a lighter tinge the colours of the scapulary are also less vivid  This bird is rather smaller than the common Blackbird its bill wings legs and toes are proportionably longer In size figure and even instinct it is much more analogous to the RingOuzel for it likewise migrates However we must own that one of these Rosecoloured Ouzels which was killed in England kept company with yellowbilled Blackbirds Its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail is seven inches and threequarters and to the extremity of the nails seven and a half its alar extent thirteen or fourteen and its wings when closed reached almost to the middle of the tail  Specific character of the  Turdus Roseus    It is somewhat of a carnation colour its head its wings and its tail black the back of its head crested  It very rarely appears in England It annually resorts in great flocks about the river Don where it breeds among the rocks The  Turdus Seleucis  of Gmelin is really the same species which in Syria obtains the name of  locust bird  It visits Aleppo in the months of July and August in pursuit of the swarms of locusts and hence the Turks regard it as somewhat sacred  N  o

Gmel  Lanius Infaustus  Gmel  Merula Saxatilis  Ray Will and Briss  The Greater RedStart  Alb  The Rock Crow  Penn  THE name indicates sufficiently the haunts of this bird it inhabits precipices and mountains it is found in the wildest parts of Bugey it sits commonly on the large stones and constantly without cover so that it is difficult to get near it with a fowlingpiece for as soon as it perceives the person it removes to another place Its shyness seems to be less owing to native wildness than to its apprehensions of man and its experience of his artifices Nor is it so much exposed as many other birds to danger from that quarter The loss of liberty alone is what it has to dread for though excellent eating it is more prized on account of its song which is soft varied and much like that of the Pettychaps It soon acquires the notes of other birds and even learns our music It begins by daybreak and welcomes the return of the morning and it renews its strain with the setting sun If during the night we go near its cage with a light it  immediately sings and in the daytime if it is not warbling it seems humming and preparing new airs  These birds conceal their nests with the utmost care and build them in the holes of the rocks and in the bottom of the most inaccessible caverns It is with the greatest difficulty and hazard that we can scramble to these which they defend with courage darting at the eyes of their plunderers  Each hatch contains three or four eggs They feed their young with worms and insects on which they live themselves They can subsist however on other food and when they are raised in a cage it succeeds well to give them the same paste as the Nightingales But they must be taken from the nest for after they have flown they cannot be enticed into any kind of snare and if they be caught by surprise they will never survive their liberty  FRISCH    The Rock Blackbirds are found in many parts of Germany in the Alps in the mountains of Tyrol in those of Bugey c I received a female of this species caught on its eggs the th of May it had built its nest on a rock in the neighbourhood of Montberd where these birds are very rare and quite unknown its colours were not so bright as those of the male This last is rather smaller than the common Blackbird and entirely different in its proportions  Its wings are very long such as would suit a bird that nestles in the bottom of caverns they measure thirteen or fourteen inches when expanded and if closed they reach almost to the end of the tail which is only three inches in length The bill is about an inch  With regard to the plumage the head and neck are covered as it were with a cinereous cowl variegated with small rusty spots The back is darker near the neck and lighter near the tail The ten lateral quills of the tail are ferruginous and the intermediate brown The wingquills and their coverts are of a dusky colour and edged with a lighter tinge Lastly the breast and all the lowerpart of the body orange variegated with small speckles some white others brown the bill and legs are blackish  There are two kinds of Rock Blackbirds or Ouzels a greater and a lesser The former has sometimes been denominated a Crow or Shrike It is the  Turdus Infaustus  of Latham who thus characterizes it  It is blackish variegated with dusky and tawny its head spotted with cinereous tawny its lateral tailquills rufous  It is of the size of a Thrush and occurs chiefly in Italy and the south of Europe  The Lesser Rock Ouzel is the one whose habits are exhibited in the text It is the

Edw  The Blue Thrush  Lath  THIS bird has the same ground colour with the Rock Blackbird that is a cinereous blue without any mixture of orange the same size the same proportions nearly the same taste for certain kinds of food the same song the same habit of settling on the summits of mountains and of building its nest in the most craggy rocks In short we might be inclined to refer it to the same species Accordingly many naturalists have mistaken the one for the other The colours of its plumage vary somewhat in the descriptions and it is probably subject to real variations arising from the difference of the individuals that of age of sex of climate c The male which Edwards has delineated Pl XVIII was not of an uniform blue throughout the tinge of the upperpart of the body was deeper  N  o  THE BLUE THRUSH  than that of the lower the quills of its tail blackish those of its wings brown and also the great coverts which are edged with white its eyes surrounded by a yellow circle the inside of its mouth orange its bill and legs of a brown verging on black There would seem to be more uniformity in the plumage of the female  Belon who saw some of these birds at Ragusa in Dalmatia tells us that they are also found in the islands of Negropont Candia Zante Corfu c that they are very much sought for on account of their song but he adds that they do not inhabit France or Italy However the arm of the sea which separates Dalmatia from Italy is no insurmountable barrier especially to these birds which according to Belon himself fly much better than the common Blackbird and which could at least make the circuit and penetrate into Italy by the State of Venice Besides it is a fact that these Ouzels are found in Italy the one described by Brisson and that figured in our  Pl Enl  No were both sent from that country Edwards had learnt from current report that they nestled on inaccessible rocks or old deserted towers  M Lottinger tells me of a Leadcoloured Ouzel which passes into the mountains of Lorraine in the months of September and October which is then much fatter and better tasted than our common Blackbirds but resembles neither the male nor the female of that species As no description accompanied this note I cannot decide whether it refers to the Blue Ouzel  and he saw some which were  killed near Gibraltar from which he infers with great probability that they are spread through the whole of the south of Europe But this must be understood of the mountainous tracts for it is rare to find them in the plains They commonly lay four or five eggs and their flesh especially when they are young is reckoned good eating  BELON    Specific character of the  Turdus Cyanus    Its quills are blueash coloured at the margin its mouth and eyelids yellow  It

singular pleasure in listening to it and even at present the male of this species is tamed and sold at a very high price at Geneva and Milan  Olina Gesner Willughby  and still dearer at Smyrna and Constantinople  It is sometimes sold in these cities for fifty or a hundred piastres  HASSELQUIST  The native warble of the Solitary Ouzel is extremely liquid and tender but rather plaintive as must be the song of every bird which leads a lonely existence It remains always single except in the season of love At that joyous period the male and female not only associate together  but desert in company the wild and dreary heights where they had lived separately and resort to the milder abodes of man They seem to seek spectators of their pleasures and come forward in those intoxicating moments when other animals court the silence of retreat But they lodge at a considerable height above the surface and thus in the midst of population they shun the dangers to which they would be exposed They build their nest with stalks of grass and feathers in the top of a separate chimney or on the ruins of an old castle or on the summit of a large tree and almost always near a steeple or lofty tower The male sits whole hours or days upon the vane or weathercock and soothes the tedious situation of his mate by a continual warble but pathetic as are his strains they are still insufficient to express the warmth and tenderness of his emotions A solitary bird feels more delicately and ardently than others Sometimes he rises chanting flapping his wings displaying the feathers of his tail bristling those on his head and panting with delight he describes many circles in the air round his beloved mate as the centre  If the female be scared by any uncommon noise or by the sight of any new object she retires into her fort but soon returns to the nest which she never abandons  As soon as the young are hatched the male ceases to sing but not to love he gives another  proof of his affection by sharing in the trouble of rearing the brood and bringing provisions in his bill In animals the ardor of love is ever proportioned to the tenderness for the offspring  They commonly lay five or six eggs they feed their young with insects on which and on grapes they subsist themselves  Willughby Belon c  They arrive in April in those countries where they pass the summer and depart about the end of August they return every year to the same spot where they first fixed their abode It is uncommon to see more than two pairs settled in the same tract  There is every year a pair of them in the belfry of SainteReine a small town in my neighbourhood situated on the declivity of a hill of moderate height    The young when they are taken out of the nest are capable of instruction and they learn to chant or to prattle They begin to sing at midnight on the approach of the light of a candle When welltreated they can live in a cage eight or ten years They are found on the mountains in France and Italy  Belon  in almost all the islands of the Archipelago especially in Zira and Nia where it is said they nestle among the heaps of stones  Hasselquist  and in the island of Corsica where they are not considered as birds of passage  Artier Professor of Natural History at Bastia  But in Burgundy those which arrive  in the spring and lodge on the chimney tops and in ruined churches were never known to spend the winter in that province The Solitary Ouzel may not migrate in Corsica and yet flit from one part to another according to the change of seasons as it does in France  The singular habits of this bird and the charms of its song have inspired in the people a sort of veneration for it I know some places where it is looked upon as lucky where they would hardly suffer its nest to be disturbed and dread its death as a public misfortune  The Solitary Ouzel is rather smaller than the common Blackbird but its bill is stronger and more hooked near the point and the legs are shorter in proportion Its plumage is brown of different shades and speckled throughout with white except on the rump and on the feathers of the wings and tail Also its neck throat breast and the coverts of the wings are in the male of a blue tinge with purple reflexions entirely wanting in the female which is of an uniform brown with yellowish speckles In both the iris is of an orange yellow the opening of the nostrils wide the edges of the bill scalloped near the tip as in almost all the Blackbirds and Thrushes the inside of the mouth yellow the tongue parted into three threads of which the mid one is the longest twelve quills in the tail nineteen in each wing the first of which is very short lastly the first  phalanx  of the outer toe  is joined to that of the middle one The total length of the bird is eight or nine inches its alar extent twelve or thirteen its tail three its leg thirteen lines and its bill fifteen the wings when closed reach beyond the middle of the tail  Specific character of the  Turdus Solitarius    It is dusky a great part of it spotted with white its tail blackish  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE SOLITARY OUZEL  I The PENSIVE THRUSH  Le Merle Solitaire de Manille  Buff  Turdus Manillensis  Gmel  THIS species seems to be intermediate between the Solitary Ouzel and the Rock Blackbird It has the colours of the latter and distributed partly in the same order but its wings are not so long though when closed they reach to twothirds of the tail Its plumage is a slateblue uniform on the head the hindpart of the neck and the back almost quite blue on the rump speckled with yellow on the throat and on the forepart of the neck and top of the breast The same blue colour is deeper on the coverts of the wings with similar speckles though scattered more sparingly and some white spots which are still fewer The rest of the underside of the body is orange speckled with blue and white the quills of the wings and of the tail are blackish and the latter edged with  rufous lastly the bill is brown and the legs almost black  The Pensive Ouzel is nearly of the size of the Rock Blackbird its total length is about eight inches its alar extent twelve or thirteen its tail three its bill only an inch  The female has no blue or orange in its plumage but two or three shades of brown which form pretty regular speckles on the head the back and all the underside of the bodyThese two birds were presented by M Sonnerat  II The HERMIT THRUSH  Le Merle Solitaire des Philippines  Buff  Turdus Eremita  Gmel  The figure of this bird its port and its bill resemble those of the Solitary Ouzels and its plumage is somewhat analogous to that of the Pensive Ouzel but it is rather smaller Each feather in the underside of the body is rufous of various shades and edged with brown The feathers of the upperside of the body are brown with a double border the inner blackish and the outer dirty white The small coverts of the wings have an ashcast and those of the rump and tail are quite cinereous The head is olive  verging on yellow the orbits whitish the quills of the tail and of the wings edged with gray the bill and legs brown  The entire length of the Hermit Ouzel is about seven inches and a half its alar extent twelve and its wings if closed reach to threefourths of its tail which contains twelve quills and is only two inches and three quarters long  This bird which was sent by M Poivre resembles in so many respects the Pensive Ouzel that I should not wonder if it be afterwards found only a variety of age or sex especially as it is brought from the same country is smaller and its colour intermediate between those of the male and of the female  FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE

of the wings and impressed on the quills and a little white on the tips of the lateral quills of the tail the bill and legs are yellow and the iris of a fine orange There is a small tuft of pretty long feathers on the forehead which the bird can bristle up at pleasure But notwithstanding this mark of distinction and the difference perceived in its proportions we may perhaps regard it as a variety produced by climate of our Yellowbilled Blackbird It has like  that bird a great facility in learning to whistle airs and in repeating words It is difficult to be brought from China into Europe Its length is eight inches and a half its wings when closed reach to the middle of the tail which is only two inches and a half long and composed of twelve quills nearly equal  Specific character of the  Gracula Cristatella  LINN  It is black the primary wingquills white at their base and the tailquills at their tips the bill yellow    III The RUFOUSWINGED THRUSH  Le Podobé du Senegal  Buff  Turdus Erythropterus  Gmel  We are indebted to M Adanson for this foreign and new species its bill is brown its wings and legs rufous its wings short its tail long tapered marked with white at the extremity of the lateral quills and of the lower coverts In every other part the Podobé is of the colour of our Blackbirds and resembles them in size and in the shape of the bill which however is not yellow  IV The BLACKBIRD of China  Turdus Perspicillatus  Gmel  The Spectacle Thrush  Lath  This Blackbird is larger than ours its legs much stronger its tail longer and differently shaped for it is tapered The most remarkable feature in its plumage is what appears like a pair of spectacles placed at the base of the bill and extending both ways upon the eyes the sides of these spectacles are nearly of an oval form and black so that they are distinctly defined on the gray plumage of the head and neck The same gray colour intermixed with a greenish tint is spread over the whole of the upperside of the body including the wings and the intermediate quills of the tail the lateral quills are of a much deeper colour part of the breast and the belly are of a dirty white with a little yellow as far as the lower coverts of the tail which are rufous The wings when closed extend not far beyond the origin of the tail  V The GLOSSY THRUSH  Le VertDoré  ou  Merle a Longue Queue du Senegal  i e  The GoldenGreen or Longtailed Blackbird of Senegal  Buff  Turdus Aeneus  Gmel  The extreme length of this bird which is about seventeen inches is only twothirds of that of its tail Its alar extent by no means corresponds to the same proportion being narrower than that of the common Blackbird which is a much smaller bird Its bill is also proportionably shorter but its legs are longer  The measures given by Brisson are theseTotal length eighteen inches from the point of the bill to the end of the nails ten and a half alar extent fourteen and a quarter the length of the tail eleven the bill thirteen lines the legs eighteen  The prevailing colour is the fine glossy green that appears in the plumage of Ducks the only difference is derived from the various tints and reflexions which in different parts it assumes It is blackish on the head with gold colour shining through and on the rump and the two long intermediate quills of the tail are purple reflexions on the belly and thighs a changing green with rosecopper Almost all the rest of its plumage is of a rich gold green  There is in the Royal Cabinet a bird exactly like this only its tail is not near so long It is probably the same bird but caught in the time of moulting  It is titled  The Green Ouzel of Senegal    VI The CRESCENT BLACKBIRD of America  Le FeraCheval  on  Merle a Collier d'Amerique  Buss  Alauda Magna  Linn and Gmel  Sturnus Ludovicianus  var Lath  Merula Americana Torquata  Briss  The Large Lark  Catesby  The Crescent Stare  Penn and Lath  The only black part of the plumage of this bird is a mark shaped like a horseshoe which descends upon the breast and a bar of the same colour rising on each side under the eye and extending backwards The first of these spots seems from its determined figure to be the most characteristic of this species and distinguishes it the best from the other collared Blackbirds This horseshoe is traced on a yellow ground which is the colour of the throat and of all the underside of the body and which appears again between the bill and the eyes brown predominates on the head and behind the neck and light gray on the sides Also the top of the  head is marked with a whitish ray all the upperside of the body is of a partridgegray the quills of the wings and of the tail  Linnaeus says that the three lateral quills of the tail are partly white  Syst Nat  Edit x p  are brown with some rusty spots the legs brown and very long and the bill which is almost black is shaped like that of our Blackbirds like them also it sings agreeably in the spring though it has not the same extent of notes It scarcely eats any thing but the small seeds which it finds on the ground  For instance those of the Yellowflowered  Ornithogalum  in which respect it resembles the Larks though it is much larger exceeding even our Blackbird nor is its hindnail lengthened as in the Larks It perches on the top of bushes and its tail is observed to have a brisk motion upwards and downwards In fact it is neither a Lark nor a Blackbird and yet of all the European birds it resembles the latter the most It is found not only in Virginia and Carolina but in almost the whole continent of America  Linnaeus asserts that it occurs also in Africa    The subject examined by Catesby weighed three ounces and a quarter its extreme length ten inches its bill fifteen lines its legs eighteen its wings when closed reached to the middle of its tail  Authors are much divided with respect to the classification of this bird Lawson and Catesby call it a Lark Brisson reckons it a Blackbird Pennant makes it a Stare and Latham regards it as a variety of the Louisiana Stare already described and Gmelin seems inclined to the same opinion It is thus characterized by Mr Latham  Above it is variegated with rusty brown and blackish below yellow with a black curved stripe on the breast the three lateral quills of the tail white  It lives in savannas and is esteemed good eating In the State of NewYork it appears in the beginning of April breeds in June and retires in September or October It nestles on the ground and its eggs are whitish  VII The GREEN BLACKBIRD of Angola  The Blue and Green Daw  Edw  The upperpart of the body the head the neck the tail and the wings are of an olive green but brown spots appear on the wings and the rump is blue On the back and on the foreside of the neck is a mixture of blue with green the blue again occurs on the upperpart of the throat violet predominates on the breast the belly the thighs and the feathers which cover the ears lastly the lower coverts of the tail are of an olive yellow the bill and legs of a deep black  This bird is of the same size with the fiftythird Thrush of Brisson the proportions are likewise the same but the plumage of the latter is different being entirely of a fine duckgreen  with a spot of steelviolet on the anterior part of the wing  These birds are nearly of the bulk of our Blackbird their length being nine inches their alar extent twelve and a quarter their bill eleven or twelve lines their wings when closed reach to the middle of the tail which consist of twelve equal quills  It is probable that these two birds belong to the same species but I cannot decide which is the original stem and which the collateral branch  This bird is a variety of the  Shining Thrush  of Latham the  Turdus Nitens  of Linnaeus and the  Turdus Viridis Angolensis  of Brisson  The character of the species is That it is green with a spot of shining violet on the coverts of the wings  VIII The GILDED THRUSH  Le Merle Violet du Royaume de Juida  Buff  The plumage of this bird is painted with the same colours as the preceding that is with violet green and blue but differently distributed violet is spread without any mixture on the head the neck and all the underpart of the body blue on the tail and its upper coverts and lastly  green on the wings but these have besides a blue stripe near their inner margin  This bird is also of the same size with the preceding it appears to have the same port and as it comes from the same climates I should be tempted to refer it to the same species were it not longer winged which implies other instincts and habits But as the length of the wings in dried birds depends greatly on the mode of preparing them we cannot admit the circumstance just mentioned to constitute a specific difference and it will be prudent to wait the decision of accurate observation  IX The CEYLON THRUSH  Le PlastronNoir de Ceilan  Buff  Turdus Zeylonus  Linn and Gmel  Merula Torquata Capitis Bonae Spei  Briss  The Green Pye of Ceylon  Edw  I bestow a separate name on this bird because those who have seen it do not agree with regard to the species to which it belongs Brisson makes it a Blackbird and Edwards a Pie or a Shrike For my own part I conceive it to be a RingOuzel not venturing however to decide till farther information clear up the subject  It is smaller than the Blackbird and its bill proportionably stronger Its total length is seven inches and a half its alar extent eleven its tail three and a half its bill twelve or thirteen lines and its legs fourteen its wings when closed reach beyond the middle of its tail which is somewhat tapered  The black breastpiece which distinguishes this bird is the more conspicuous as it is bounded above and below by a lighter colour for the throat and all the underpart of the body is of a pretty bright yellow From the two ends of the uppermargin of this breastpiece arise two cords of the same colour which first ascending on each side towards the head define the beautiful yellow orange plate on the throat and then bending under the eyes terminate at the base of the bill where they are in a manner inserted Two yellow eyebrows which take their origin close to the nostrils embrace the eyes above and form a contrast to the black cords All the upperpart of this bird is olive but that colour seems to be tarnished by a mixture of cinereous on the top of the head and on the contrary to brighten on the rump and on the outer edge of the wingquills the largest of these are tipt with brown the two intermediate ones of the tail are of an olive green and also the whole of the underpart of the body and the ten lateral ones are black tipt with yellow  The female has neither the black breastpiece nor the black cords Its throat is gray its breast and belly of a greenish yellow and all the upperside of the body of the same colour but deeper In general the female differs little from the bird figured  Pl Enl  No under the name of the  Orangebellied Blackbird of Senegal  Brisson has supposed that this bird is a native of the Cape of Good Hope and indeed it was brought from that place by the Abbé de la Caille But if we believe Edwards it belongs to a more distant climate that of the island of Ceylon That naturalist obtained accurate information on this subject from John Gideon Loten who had been governor of Ceylon and who on his return from India presented several birds of that country to the Royal Society and among the rest a Ceylon Thrush Edwards introduces here an observation which we have already anticipated but which it may not be improper to repeat The Cape of Good Hope is the general rendezvous of ships trading to the East and it may often happen that in touching there birds may be left which afterwards are mistaken for natives of the extremity of Africa  X The ORANGEGREEN or the ORANGEBELLIED BLACKBIRD of Senegal  Turdus Chrysogaster  Gmel  The Orangebellied Thrush  Lath  The principal colours of this new species are green and orange a fine deep green with reflexions which are variously shaded with yellow is spread over the whole of the upperpart of the body including the tail the wings the head and even the throat but is not so deep on the tail The underpart of the body from the throat downwards is of a shining orange When the wings are closed there appears a train of white which belongs to the outer edge of some of the quills The bill is brown and also the legsThis bird is smaller than the Blackbird its length is about eight inches its alar extent eleven and a half its tail two and threequarters and its bill eleven or twelve lines  VARIETY  of this  BIRD  The preceding bird resembles much the female of the RingOuzel of Ceylon but it is  equally related to the  Blackbird of the Cape of Good Hope  No which I call  OrangeBlue oranbleu  for the whole of the underpart of its body is orange from the throat to the lower belly inclusive and blue is spread over the upperpart from the base of the bill to the end of the tail This blue consists of two shades the deeper of which edges each feather whence results an agreeable and regular variety The bill and legs are black and also the quills of the wings but many of the middle ones have a whitegray margin lastly the tailquills are the most uniform in regard to colour  XI The BROWN BLACKBIRD of the CAPE of GOOD HOPE  Turdus Bicolor  Gmel  The Whiterumped Thrush  Lath  We are indebted to Sonnerat for this new species It is nearly the size of the Blackbird its total length ten inches and its wings extend a little beyond the middle of the tail Almost all its plumage is of a varying brown with reflexions of dusky green the belly and rump are white  XII The BANIAHBOU of Bengal  Turdus Canorus Lanius Faustus  Linn and Gmel  Merula Bengalensis  Briss  The Brown Indian Thrush  Edw  To Crying Thrush  Lath  plumage is every where brown deeper on the upperpart of the body lighter on the under and also on the edge of the coverts and wingquills the bill and legs are yellow the tail tapered about three inches long and extending half its length beyond the closed wings Such are the chief circumstances which characterize this foreign bird the size of which somewhat exceeds that of the Throstle  Linnaeus informs us on the authority of some Swedish naturalists who had travelled into Asia that the same bird occurs in China but it seems there to have been affected by the climate being gray above and rustcoloured below with a white streak on each side of the head The epithet of  canorus  which Linnaeus bestows on it no doubt from accurate information implies that these foreign Blackbirds have an agreeable warble  XIII The CINEREOUS BLACKBIRD  L'Ourovang  ou  Merle Cendré de Madagascar  Buff  TurdusUrovang  Gmel  Merula Madagascariensis Cinerea  Briss  The name Cinereous Blackbird gives a very just idea of the predominant colour of the plumage but the intensity is not every where the same it is very deep almost black with a slight tinge of green on the long and narrow feathers that cover the head it is lighter without mixture of other tinge on the quills of the tail and of the wings and on the great coverts of the latter It has an olive cast on the upperpart of the body on the small coverts of the wings on the neck on the throat and on the breast Lastly it is lighter under the body and about the lower belly and there is a slight tinge of yellow  This Blackbird is nearly as large as our RedWing but its tail is rather longer its wings somewhat shorter and its legs much shorter Its bill is yellow as in our Blackbirds marked near the end with a brown ray and furnished with some bristles round the base its tail consists of twelve equal quills and its legs are of a brown colour  XIV The PIGEON THRUSH  Le Merle des Colombiers  Buff  Turdus Columbinus  Gmel  This bird is called in the Philippines the  Pigeonhouse Stare  because it is naturally familiar and seeks the conveniencies which the dwellings of men afford and nestles even in the pigeonhouses But it resembles the Blackbird more than the Stare in the shape of its bill and legs and in the proportions of its wings which only reach the middle of the tail c Its bulk is nearly that of the RedWing and its plumage consists of one colour though not uniform this is a varying green which according to its position has different shades and reflexions This species is new and we are indebted for it to Sonnerat There are also found in the collection which he brought from the Cape of Good Hope some individuals that evidently belong to the same species but which differ in having their rump white both on the upper and under surface and in being smaller Must this be ascribed to climate or to age  Specific character of the  Turdus Columbinus    It is green with different coloured reflexions    XV The OLIVE THRUSH  Le Merle Olive du Cape de Bonne Esperance  Buff  Turdus Olivaceus  Linn and Gmel  The upperpart of the body of this bird including what appears of the quills of the tail and of the wings when they are closed is of an olivebrown the neck and the breast are of the same colour as the throat but without streaks all the rest of the underpart of the body is of a fine fulvous colour lastly the bill is brown as well as the legs and the inside of the quills of the wings and the lateral quills of the tail  This Blackbird is as large as a RedWing its alar extent near thirteen inches and its total length eight and a quarter the bill is ten lines the leg fourteen the tail which consists of twelve equal quills is three inches long and the wings when closed reach only half its length  Specific character of the  Turdus Olivaceus    It is somewhat dusky below dusky    XVI The BLACKTHROATED THRUSH  Le Merle à Gorge Noire de Saint Domingue  Buff  Turdus Aler  Gmel  The black on the throat of this bird extends on the one hand below the eye and even on the space between the eye and the bill and on the other it descends upon the neck as far as the breast It is besides edged with a broad rufous border with different shades of brown which extends upon the eyes and upon the forepart of the top of the head the rest of the head the posterior surface of the neck the back and the small coverts of the wings are grayish brown variegated slightly with some browner tints The great coverts of the wings as well as the quills are of a blackish brown edged with light gray and separated from the small coverts by an oliveyellow line belonging to these small coverts The same oliveyellow predominates on the rump and on all the underpart of the body but under the body it is variegated with some black spots which are pretty broad and scattered thinly over the whole space between the black piece of the throat and the legs The tail is of the same gray as the upperpart of the body but in its middle only the lateral quills being edged  on the outside with a blackish colour the bill and the legs are black  This bird which has not been hitherto described is nearly of the bulk of the RedWing its total length is about seven inches and a half its bill one inch its tail three and its wings which are very short reach scarcely the fourth of its tail  XVII The CANADA BLACKBIRD  This resembles the most the Mountain Blackbird which is only a variety of the Ring Ouzel It is smaller but its wings bear the same proportion to its tail not reaching beyond the middle and the colours of its plumage which are not very different are distributed in the same manner The ground colour is constantly darkbrown variegated with lighter shades in every part except in the quills of the tail and of the wings which are of an uniform blackish brown The coverts of the wings have reflexions of a deep but shining green all the other feathers are blackish and terminated with rufous which disjoining them from one another produces a regular variety so that the feathers may be counted from the rufous spots  XVIII The INDIAN OLIVE BLACKBIRD  Turdus Indicus  Gmel  Merula Olivacea Indica  Briss  The Indian Thrush  Lath  All the upperpart of this bird including the quills of the tail and those uncovered of the quills of the wing are of a deep olivegreen All the underpart is of the same groundcolour but of a lighter tinge and bordering upon yellow The inner webs of the wingquills are brown edged partly with yellow the bill and legs are almost blackThis bird is larger than the RedWing its whole length is eight inches its alar extent twelve and a half its tail three and a half its bill thirteen lines its leg nine and its wings when closed reach to the middle of its tail  XIX The INDIAN CINEREOUS BLACKBIRD  Turdus Cinereus  Gmel  Merula Cinerea Indica  Briss  The Ashcoloured Thrush  Lath  The colour of the upperpart of the body is deeper than that of the under The great coverts  and the quills of the wings are edged with whitegray on the outside but the middle quills have this edging broader They have likewise another border of the same colour on the inside from their origin to twothirds of their length Of the twelve tailquills the two middle ones are cinereous like the upperpart of the body the two following are partly of the same colour but their inside is black the eight others are entirely black as also the bill the legs and the nails The bill has some blackish bristles near the angles of its openingThis bird is smaller than the RedWing it is seven and a quarter in length twelve and twothirds alar extent its tail is three inches its bill eleven lines and its leg ten  XX The BROWN BLACKBIRD of Senegal  Turdus Senegalensis  Gmel  Merula Senegalensis  Briss  The Senegal Thrush  Lath  Nothing can be more uniform and ordinary than the plumage of this bird or more easy to describe It is grayish brown on the upper and anterior parts dirty white on the underpart brown on the quills of the tail and of the wings and also on the bill and legs It is not so large  as the RedWing but its tail is longer and its bill shorter Its whole length according to Brisson is eight inches its alar extent eleven and a half its tail three and a half its bill nine lines its leg eleven Its wings do not reach farther than the middle of its tail which consists of twelve quills  XXI The TANOMBE or the MADAGASCAR BLACKBIRD  Turdus Madagascariensis  Gmel  Merula Madagascariensis  Briss  The Madagascar Thrush  Lath  I have retained the name by which this bird is known in its native region It is to be wished that travellers would thus preserve the real names of the foreign birds we should then be able to distinguish the species to which each observation applied  The  Tanombé  is rather smaller than the RedWing its plumage is in general of a very deep brown on the head neck and all the upperpart of the body but the coverts of the tail and wings have a tinge of green The tail is a gold green edged with white as also the wings which have besides some violet changing into  green at the tips of the great quills a colour of polished steel on the middle quills and the great coverts and an oblong mark of fine goldyellow on the same middle quills The breast is of a rufous brown the rest of the underpart of the body white the bill and legs are black and the tarsus very short The tail is somewhat forked the wings reach only to the middle but its alar extent is greater in proportion than in the RedWing I may observe that in a subject which I had occasion to see the bill was more hooked at the point than represented in the figure and in this respect the Tanombé seems to resemble the Solitary Blackbird  XXII The MINDANAO BLACKBIRD  Turdus Mindanensis  Gmel  The Mindanao Thrush  Lath  The steel colour which appears on part of the wings of the Tanombé is in the Mindanao Blackbird spread over the head the throat the neck the breast and all the upperpart of the body as far as the end of the tail The wings have a white bar near their outer margin and the rest of the underpart of the body is white  This bird exceeds not seven inches in length and its wings reach only the middle of the tail which is somewhat taperedIt is a new species introduced by Sonnerat  Daubenton the younger has observed another individual of the same kind in which the ends of the long quills of the wings and of the tail are of a deep varying green with several spots of wavyviolet on the body but chiefly behind the head It is perhaps a female or else a young male  XXIII The GREEN BLACKBIRD of the Isle of France  Turdus Mauritianus  Gmel  The Mauritius Thrush  Lath  The plumage of this bird is quite uniform all the outside being bluish green verging to brown but its bill and legs cinereous It is smaller than the RedWing its length is about seven inches its alar extent ten and a half its bill ten lines and its wings reach to the third of its tail which is only two inches and a half The feathers that cover the head and neck are long and narrowIt is a new species  XXIV The BLACK CASQUE or the BLACKHEADED BLACKBIRD of the Cape of Good Hope  Though at first sight this bird seems to resemble most in its plumage that of the following article the  Brunet  and particularly the  Yellowrumped Blackbird of Senegal  which I consider as a variety of the same species we still perceive obvious differences in its colour and more important ones in the proportions of its limbs It is not so large as the RedWing its total length nine inches its alar extent nine and a half its tail three and twothirds its bill thirteen lines and its leg fourteen Its wings therefore spread less than those of the Brunet but its bill tail and legs are proportionably longer Its tail is also of a different form and consists of twelve tapered quills each wing has nineteen of which the longest are the fifth and the sixth  With regard to its plumage it resembles that bird in the brown colour of the upperpart of its body but it differs by the colour of its helmet which is of a shining black by the rufous colour of its rump and of the uppercoverts of its tail by the rusty cast of its throat and of the whole of the underpart of its body as far as  the lower coverts of the tail inclusively by the small brown ray on the flanks by the small white spot which appears on the wings and which belongs to the large quills by the blackish colour of the quills of the tail and lastly by the white mark which terminates the lateral ones and which is larger as the quill is nearer the outside  XXV The BRUNET of the Cape of Good Hope  Turdus Capensis  Linn and Gmel  Merula Fusca Capitis Bonae Spei  Briss  The Brunet Thrush  Lath  The predominant colour of the plumage of this bird is deep brown which is spread over the head the neck all the upperpart of the body the tail and wings it is rather lighter on the breast and sides has a yellowish cast on the belly and thighs and gives place to a beautiful yellow on the lower coverts of the tail This yellow spot is the more conspicuous as it is contrasted with the colour of the quills of the tail which are of a still deeper brown below than above The bill and legs are entirely black  This bird is not larger than a Lark its wings measure ten inches and a half across and hardly reach to the third of its tail which is near three inches long and consists of twelve equal quills  Specific character of the  Turdus Capensis    It is dusky its belly somewhat yellowish its vent yellow    VARIETY of the CAPE BRUNET  The bird represented  Pl Enl  No by the name of the  Yellowrumped Blackbird of Senegal  Merle a culjaune du Senegol  is much analogous to the Brunet only it is rather larger and its head and throat are black The remaining parts are of the same colour in both and nearly of the same proportions which would lead us to suppose that it is a variety produced by difference of age or of sex But having occasion afterwards to observe that among a great number of birds sent by Sonnerat many marked "Cape Blackbirds" were exactly like the subject described by Brisson and not one with a black head and throat it seems more probable that the bird No is only a variety derived from climate The bill of this bird is broader at the base and more curved than that of the ordinary Blackbird  XXVI The BROWN JAMAICA BLACKBIRD  Turdus Aurantius  Gmel  Merula Jamaicensis  Briss  Merula Fusca  Ray Sloane and Klein  The Whitechinned Thrush  Lath  Deep brown is the predominant colour of the head the upperpart of the body the wings and the tail brown of a lighter shade on the foreside of the breast and of the neck dirty white under the belly and on the rest of the lowerpart of the body The most remarkable feature in this bird is that the throat and bill are white and the legs orange Its extreme length is six inches four lines its alar extent nine inches and some lines its tail two inches and eight or nine lines its leg two inches and a quarter its bill eleven lines all English measure It appears then that it is not so large as our RedWing It generally haunts the mountains and forests and is esteemed good eating All that Sloane informs us with respect to the interior structure of this bird is that its fat is of an orangeyellow  Specific character of the  Turdus Aurantius    It is blackishbrown the upperpart of its throat and its belly whitish its bill and legs orange    XXVII The CRAVATED BLACKBIRD of Cayenne  Turdus Cinnamomeus  Gmel  The Blackbreasted Thrush  Lath  The cravat of this Blackbird is very broad of a fine black edged with white it extends from the base of the lower mandible and even from the space included between the upper mandible and the eye as far as the middle of the breast where the white border widens and is marked with transverse rays of black it covers the sides of the head as far as the eyes and incloses threefourths of the circumference of the neck The coverts of the wings are of the same black as the collar but the small ones are tipt with white which produces speckles of that colour and the two rows of great coverts have a fulvous edging The rest of the plumage is cinnamon colour but the bill and legs are black  This Blackbird is smaller than our RedWing the point of its bill is hooked as in the Solitary Thrushes Its whole length is about seven inches its tail two and a half its bill eleven lines and its wings which are short extend but a little way beyond the origin of the tail  XXVIII The CRESTED BLACKBIRD of the Cape of Good Hope  Turdus Cafer  Linn and Gmel  The Cape Thrush  Lath  The crest is not permanent it consists of long narrow feathers which naturally recline on the top of the head but which the bird can bristle at pleasure Its colour and that of the head and the breast is a fine black with violet reflexions the foreside of the neck and breast have the same wavy gloss on a brown ground This brown is spread on all the upperpart of the body and extends over the neck the coverts of the wings part of the tailquills and even under the body where it forms a sort of broad cincture which passes under the belly but in all these places it is softened by a whitish colour which edges and defines each feather in the same way nearly as in the Ring Ouzel  The lower coverts of the tail are red the upper white the abdomen also white and the bill and legs black The corners where the bill opens are shaded with long black bristles projecting forwards This Blackbird is scarcely larger than the Crested Lark Its wings measure eleven or twelve inches across and when closed do not  reach the middle of the tail The longest feathers are the fourth and fifth and the first is the shortest of all  Specific character of the  Turdus Cafer    It is somewhat crested its rump and belly white its vent red    XXIX The AMBOYNA BLACKBIRD  Turdus Amboinensis  Gmel  The Amboina Thrush  Lath  I allow this bird to remain in the place assigned it by Brisson though I am not quite certain whether it really belongs to this genus Seba who first noticed it tells us that he ranged it among the Nightingales on account of the sweetness of its song it not only chants its loves in the spring but erects its long beautiful tail and bends it in a singular manner over its back All the upperpart of its body is reddish brown including the tail and the wings except that these are marked with a yellow spot all the underpart of the body is of this last colour but the lower surface of the tailquills is golden These are twelve in number and regularly diminishing  XXX The BLACKBIRD of the Isle of Bourbon  Turdus Borbonica  Gmel  The Bourbon Thrush  Lath  The size of this bird is nearly that of the Crested Lark it is seven inches and a half long and eleven and onethird across the wings its bill ten or eleven lines its legs the same and its wings reach not to the middle of its tail which is three inches and a half long and consequently almost half the whole length of the bird  The top of the head is covered with a sort of black cap all the rest of the upperpart of the body the small coverts of the wings the whole of the tail and breast are of an oliveash colour the rest of the underpart of the body is olive verging on yellow except the middle of the belly which is whitish The great coverts of the wings are brown with some mixture of rufous the wingquills are parted by these two colours the brown being placed within and beneath the rufous before We must however except the three middlequills which are entirely brown those of the tail are brown also and intersected near their end by two bars of different shades of brown but from the sameness of the ground colour they are very indistinct the bill and legs are yellowish  XXXI The DOMINICAN BLACKBIRD of the Philippines  Turdus Dominicanus  Gmel  The Dominican Thrush  Lath  The length of the wings is one of the most remarkable characters of this new species they reach as far as the tail Their colour as well as that of the underside of the body is brown on which appear a few irregular spots of the colour of polished steel or rather of changing violet  These violet spots irregularly scattered on the upperside of the body have led Daubenton the younger to suppose that this individual was killed at the close of the moulting season before the true colours of its plumage had stability  This brown ground assumes a violet cast at the origin of the tail and a greenish at the end it is lighter on the side of the neck and becomes whitish on the head and all the lowerpart of the body The bill and legs are light brown  This bird is scarcely six inches long It is a new species for which we are indebted to Sonnerat  XXXII The GREEN CAROLINA BLACKBIRD  Catesby who observed this bird in its native region informs us that it is scarcely larger than a  Lark and its figure is nearly the same that it is extremely shy and conceals itself dexterously that it haunts the banks of the large rivers two or three hundred miles from the sea and flies with its feet extended backwards as usual in those of our own birds whose tails are very short and that its song is loud It probably subsists on the seeds of the purpleflowered nightshade  All the upperpart of the body is of a dull green the eye is almost encircled with white the lower jaw delicately edged with the same colour the tail brown the undersides of the body except the lower belly which is whitish the bill and the legs black the quills of the wings do not reach much beyond the origin of the tail  The total length of the bird is about seven inches and a quarter its tail three its leg twelve lines its bill ten  XXXIII The TERAT BOULAN or the INDIAN BLACKBIRD  Turdus Orientalis  Gmel  Merula Indica  Briss  The Ashrumped Thrush  Lath  The characters of this species are these The bill legs and toes are proportionably shorter  than in the others the tail is tapered but differently from ordinary the six middle quills are of equal lengths and it is properly the three lateral quills on each side that are tapered The upperpart of the body the neck the head and the tail are black the rump cinereous and the three lateral feathers on each side tipt with white The same white prevails on all the underpart of the body and of the tail on the foreside of the neck and of the throat and extends both ways over the eyes but on each side a small black streak rises at the base of the bill and seems to pass under the eye and extend beyond it The great quills of the wings are blackish edged halfway with white on the inside the middle quills and also the great coverts are likewise edged with white but on the outside and through their whole length  This bird is rather larger than the Lark its alar extent is ten inches and a half and its wings extend a little beyond the middle of its tail Its length from the point of the bill to the end of the tail is six inches and a half and to the end of the nails five and a half the tail is two and a half the bill eight lines and a half the leg nine and the middle toe seven  XXXIV The SAUI JALA or the GOLDEN BLACKBIRD of Madagascar  Turdus Nigerrimus  Gmel  Merula Madagascariensis Aurea  Briss  The Blackcheeked Thrush  Lath  This species which is an inhabitant of the ancient continent retains in part the plumage of our Blackbirds Its bill legs and nails are blackish it has a sort of collar of fine velvet black which passes under the throat and extends only a little beyond the eyes the quills of the tail and of the wings and the plumage of the rest of the body are always black but edged with lemon colour as they are edged with gray in the Ring Ouzel so that the shape of each feather is beautifully defined on the contiguous feathers which it covers  This bird is nearly of the size of the Lark its alar extent is nine inches and a half and its tail is shorter than in our Blackbirds in proportion to the total length of the bird which is five inches and three quarters and also in proportion to the length of its wings which stretch almost to twothirds of its tail The bill is ten lines the tail sixteen the legs eleven and the middle toe ten  XXXV The SURINAM BLACKBIRD  Turdus Surinamus  Gmel  Merula Surinamensis  Briss  The Surinam Thrush  Lath  We find in this American Blackbird the same ground colour that predominates in the common Blackbird It is almost entirely of a shining black but diversified by other tints On the crown of the head is a yellowish fulvous plate on the breast are two marks of the same colour but of a lighter shade on the rump is a spot of the same hue on the wings is a white line that borders them from their origin to the third joint and lastly under the wings is white which prevails over all the lower coverts so that in flying this bird discovers as much white as black Its legs also are brown and its bill only blackish and also the wingquills and all those of the tail except the two first and the last which are a yellowish fulvous colour at their origin but only in the inside  The Surinam Blackbird is not larger than a Lark its whole length is six inches and a half its alar extent nine and a half its tail three nearly its bill eight lines and its legs seven or eight lastly its wings stretch beyond the middle of its tail  XXXVI The PALMISTE  Turdus Palmarum  Linn and Gmel  The Palm Thrush  Lath  This bird owes its name to its habits of lodging and nestling in palmtrees where it no doubt gathers its food Its bulk is equal to that of the Lark its length is six inches and a half its alar extent ten and onethird its tail two and a half and its bill ten lines  What strikes us first in the plumage is a sort of large black cap which descends both ways lower than the ears and is marked on each side with three white spots the one near the forehead the other above the eye and the third below it The neck is ashcoloured behind where it is not covered by this black cap and white before as also the throat The breast is cinereous and  he rest of the underpart of the body is white  ray The upperpart of the body including  small coverts of the wings and the twelve  uills of the tail is of a beautiful olivegreen  parts of the wingquills that appear are of  same colour and the rest is brown The  ill and legs are cinereousThe wings stretch  little beyond the middle of the tail  The bird which Brisson has made another  ecies of the Palmiste differs from the preceding  in nothing but that its cap instead of being entirely black has an ashcoloured bar on the top of the head and has rather less white under the body But in every other respect the resemblance is exact and not a word of the description needs to be altered and as they inhabit the same country I do not hesitate to conclude that these two individuals belong to the same species and I am disposed to think that the first is the male and the second the female  XXXVII The WHITEBELLIED VIOLET BLACKBIRD of Juida  Turdus Leucogaster  Gmel  The Whidah Thrush  Lath  The name of this bird contains almost a complete description of its plumage I need only add that the great wingquills are blackish that the bill is of the same colour and the legs cinereous It is rather smaller than the Lark its length is about six inches and a half its alar extent ten and a half its tail sixteen lines its bill eight its legs nineThe wings stretch threefourths of the tail  XXXVIII The RUFOUS BLACKBIRD of Cayenne  Turdus Rufifrons  Gmel  The Rufous Thrush  Lath  The front and sides of its head the throat and all the forepart of its neck and belly are rufous The top of the head and all the upperpart of the body including the superior coverts of the tail and the quills of the wings brown the superior coverts of the wings black edged with bright yellow which is conspicuous on the ground colour and terminates each row of these by a waving line The lower coverts of the tail are white the tail the bill and the legs are cinereous  This bird is smaller than the Lark its total length is only six inches and a half I could not measure it across the wings but these were certainly not broad for when closed they did not reach beyond the coverts of the tail The bill and the legs are each eleven or twelve lines  XXXIX The LITTLE RUFOUSTHROATED BROWN BLACKBIRD of Cayenne  Turdus Pectoralis  Lath Ind  The Yellowbreasted Thrush  Lath  I scarcely need add any thing to this description The rufous extends over the neck and breast the bill is cinereous black and the legs greenishyellow It is nearly of the size of the Goldfinch its total length is hardly five inches the bill seven or eight lines the legs eight or nine and the wings reach beyond the middle of the tail which in all is only eighteen lines  XL The OLIVE BLACKBIRD of St Domingo  Turdus Hispaniolensis  Gmel  Merula Olivacea Dominicensis  Briss  The Hispaniola Thrush  Lath  The upperpart of its body is olive and the under gray mixed confusedly with the same colour The inner webs of the tailquills of those of the wings and of the great coverts of  these are brown edged with white or whitish the bill and legs are grayishbrown  This bird is scarcely larger than the Petty Chaps its whole length is six inches its alar extent eight and threequarters its tail two its bill nine lines its legs of the same length its wings reach beyond the middle of its tail which consists of twelve equal quills  We may consider the  Olive Blackbird of Cayenne  Pl Enl No as a variety of this the only difference is that the upperpart of the body is of a browner green and the under of a lighter gray the legs are also more blackish  XLI The OLIVE BLACKBIRD of Barbary  Mr Bruce saw in Barbary a Blackbird which was larger than the Missel all the upperpart of the body was an olive yellow the small coverts of the wings the same colour with a tinge of brown the great coverts and the quills black the quills of the tail blackish tipt with yellow and all of equal length the underpart of the body of a dirty white the bill reddish brown the legs short and leadcoloured the wings reached only to the middle of the tail It resembles much the Barbary Throstle already  described but it has no speckles on its breast and besides there are other differences which would lead us to refer them to two distinct species  XLII The MOLOXITA or the NUN of Abyssinia  Turdus Monacha  Gmel  The Nun Thrush  Lath  Not only is this bird of the same figure and size with the Blackbirds but like them it inhabits the forests and lives on berries and fruits Instinct or perhaps experience teaches it to lodge in trees near the brink of precipices so that it is difficult to be shot and still more to be found after it has dropped It is remarkable for a great black cowl which covers the head and throat and descends over the breast like a pointed stomacher on this account it has been called the  Nun  The whole of the upperpart of the body is yellow more or less inclined to brown the coverts of the wings and the quills of the tail are brown edged with yellow the quills of the wings different shades of black and edged with lightgray or white all the underpart of the body and the thighs lightbrown the legs cinereous and the bill reddish  XLIII The BLACK and WHITE BLACKBIRD of Abyssinia  Turdus Aethiopicus  Gmel  The Ethiopian Thrush  Lath  Black extends over all the upperpart from the bill inclusively to the end of the tail excepting however the wings on which we perceive a cross bar of white conspicuous on the dark ground white predominates in the underpart and the legs are blackish This bird is nearly of the size of the RedWing but is rounder shaped the tail is square at the end and the wings so short that they scarcely reach beyond its origin It sings nearly like the cuckoos or rather the wooden clocks that imitate the cuckoos  It haunts the thickest woods and would be difficult to be discovered but for its song which would seem to shew that it does not seek safety in concealment since the same instinct would enjoin silence  This bird feeds on fruits and berries like the Blackbirds and Thrushes  XLIV The BROWN BLACKBIRD of Abyssinia  Turdus Abyssinicus  Gmel  The Abyssinian Thrush  Lath  The ancients have spoken of an Aethiopian olivetree that bore no fruit this bird feeds on the flower of that tree If it were contented with that provision few would have reason to complain But it also eats grapes and is very destructive in the season This Blackbird is nearly as large as a RedWing all the upperpart of the head and of the body is brown the coverts of the wings of the same colour the quills of the wings and of the tail deepbrown edged with a lighter brown the throat of a light brown all the underpart of the body of a fulvous yellow and the legs black  Elegant drawings of the four last species were communicated by M Ie Chevalier Bruce James Bruce  Esq  of Kinnaird of whom the author makes very honourable mention    The GRISIN of Cayenne  THE top of the head is blackish the throat black and this black colour extends from the eyes as far as the lowerpart of the breast it has a sort of white eyebrows which appear distinct on the dusky ground and connect the eyes by a white line which borders the base of the upper mandible All the upperpart of the body is cinereous gray the tail is deeper and terminated with white its lower coverts and the belly are also white the coverts of the wings are blackish and their limits accurately defined by a white border The quills of the wings are edged without with light gray and tipt with white the bill is black and the legs cinereous  This bird is not larger than a Pettychaps its length is about four inches and a half its bill seven lines its legs the same and its wings reach to the middle of its tail which is rather tapered  In the female the upperpart of the body is more cinereous than in the male what is black in the latter is only blackish in the former and for that reason the edge of the coverts of the wings is not so perceptible on the ground colour  The VERDIN of Cochin China  Turdus Cochinchinensis  Gmel  The Blackchinned Thrush  Lath  THE name of this bird sufficiently marks its predominant colour The green is shaded with a tinge of blue on the tail on the outer edge of the great quills of the wings and on the small coverts near the back The throat is velvet black except the two small blue spots which appear on both sides of the lower mandible This black extends behind the corners of the mouth and rises on the upper mandible where it occupies the space between its base and the eye and below it is surrounded by a sort of yellow high cape that falls on the breast the belly is green the bill black and the legs blackish This bird is nearly of the size of the Goldfinch I could not measure its length because the tail was not fully grown when the bird was killed  The bill is ten lines in length and appears shaped like that of the Blackbirds its edges being scalloped near the point This little Blackbird is certainly a native of Cochin China for it was found in the same box with the Musk Animal sent directly from that country  The AZURIN  THIS bird is undoubtedly not a Blackbird for it has neither the appearance nor the shape of one However there is some resemblance in the form of the bill the legs c It has been called the  Guiana Blackbird  I wait till travellers ardent in the pursuit of Natural History make us acquainted with its true name and above all with its habits To judge from the little that is known of it that is from its external appearance I should range it between the Jays and the Blackbirds  Three broad bars of fine velvet black parted by two bars of orangeyellow cover entirely the upperpart and the sides of the head and of the neck The throat is pure yellow the breast decorated with a large blue plate all the rest of the lowerpart of the body including the inferior coverts of the tail is radiated transversely with these two last colours and the blue appears alone on the quills of the tail which are tapered The upperpart of the body from the origin of the neck and the nearest coverts of the wings are of a reddish brown the most remote coverts are black as are also the wingquills but some of the first have besides a white spot whence rises a stripe of the same colour  deeply indented and which runs almost parallel to the margin of the closed wing The bill and legs are brown  This bird is rather larger than a Blackbird its whole length is eight inches and a half its tail is two and a half its bill twelve lines and its legs eighteen The wings when closed reach almost to the middle of the tail  The SHORT TAIL  Les Breves  Buff  NATURE has established important distinctions between these birds and the Blackbirds and I therefore do not hesitate to range them separately The shortness of the tail the thickness of the bill and the length of the legs are characteristic features and these must involve other differences in their port their habits and perhaps in their dispositions  We are acquainted with only four birds of this species I say species for the resemblance in the plumage is so exact that they must be regarded as varieties only of a common stem In all of them the neck the head the tail are black or partly black the upperpart of the body is green of various intensity the superior coverts of the wings and tail are of a fine beryl colour with a white or whitish spot on the great quills of the wing lastly in all except that of the Philippines the lower part of the body is yellow  I The SHORTTAIL PHILIPPINE  Corvus Brachyurus  var Gmel  Merula Viridis Atricapilla Moluccensis  Briss  Its head and neck are covered with a sort of cowl entirely black the tail of the same colour the underpart of the body including the coverts and the small quills of the wings nearest the back of a deep green the breast and the top of  the belly of a lighter green the lower belly and the coverts of the tail of a rose colour the great quills of the wings black at their origin and at their extremity and marked with a white spot between the two the bill yellowish brown and the legs orange  The whole length of the bird is only six inches and a quarter because of its short tail but it is more than eight inches when measured from the point of its bill to the end of its feet It is nearly as large as the common Blackbird its wings are twelve inches across and reach beyond the tail which is only twelve lines long the legs are eighteen  II The SHORT TAIL which Edwards has figured Pl by the name of  Shorttailed Pie of the EastIndies  Corvus Brachyurus  var Gmel  Coturnix Capensis  Klein  The Madras Jay  Ray  The Bengal Quail  Albin  Its head is not entirely black it has only three bars of that colour rising from the base of the bill the one stretching over the top of the head and behind the neck and each of the others passing under the eye and descending on the sides of the neck The two last bars are parted from the middle one by another bar which is divided lengthwise by yellow and white the yellow being contiguous to this middle bar and the white contiguous to the black lateral bar Also the underpart of its tail and the lower belly are rosecoloured like the preceding but all the rest of the underpart of the body is yellow the throat white and the  tail edged with green at the end It was brought from the island of Ceylon  III The SHORT TAIL of Bengal  Corvus Brachyurus  Gmel  Merula Viridis Moluccensis  Briss  The Shorttailed Crow  Lath  Like the first it has the head and neck covered with a black cowl but on this two large orangecoloured eyebrows are distinctly defined all the underpart of the body is yellow and what was black in the great quills of the wing in the two preceding birds is in this of a deep green like the back This bird is somewhat larger than the first and of the size of an ordinary Blackbird  IV The SHORT TAIL of Madagascar  Corvus Brachyurus  var Gmel  The plumage of its head is also different from what we have just seen the crown is of a blackish brown which assumes a little yellow behind and on the sides the rest is bounded by a half collar which is black and encircles the neck behind at its origin and by two bars of the same colour which rising from the extremity of this half collar pass under the eyes and terminate at the base of both mandibles the tail is bordered at the end with a beryl colour the wings are like those of the first the throat is mottled with white and yellow and the underpart of the body is of a colour between yellow and brown  The MAINATE of the East Indies  It is the Indian Stare of Bontius the  Corvus Javanensis  of Osbeck and seems to be the  Merula Persica  of Camel Philof Transact No This last author says that  it is a sonorous and chattering bird black but naked about the eyes like the  Illing  but less so  A few lines below this  Illing  is written  Iting  which is our  Goulin    Gracula Religiosa  Linn and Gmel  Mainatus  Briss  Minor Grakle  Lath  THE slightest comparison will convince us that this bird ought to be removed from the Blackbirds Thrushes Stares and Jackdaws with which it has been hastily ranged and classed with the  Goulin  Bald Grakle  Lath  of the Philippines and especially with the  Martin  Paradise Grakle  Lath  which belong to the same country and have likewise naked spots on the head This bird is scarcely larger than a common Blackbird its plumage is entirely black but more glossy on the upperpart of the body the throat the wings and the tail and has green and violet reflexions What is most remarkable in the bird is a double yellow comb irregularly jagged which rises on each side of the head behind the eye the two parts recline and approach each other and on the back of the head they are parted only by a bar of long narrow  N  o  THE MINOR GRAKLE  feathers which begins at the base of the bill the other feathers on the crown of the head form a sort of black velvet The tail which is eighteen lines long is yellow but receives a reddish tinge near the tail lastly the legs are of an orange yellow The tail of this bird is shorter and the wings longer than in the common Blackbird these extend within half an inch of the end of the tail and measure eighteen or twenty inches across The tail consists of twelve quills and of those of the wing the first is the shortest and the third the longest  Such is the Mainate No  Pl Enl  But we must own that this species is subject to great variety both in its plumage in its size and in the double comb which characterizes it Before entering into detail I shall mention that the Mainate has great talents for whistling chanting and even speaking that its pronunciation is more free than that of the Parrot that it has been called by distinction the Speaking Bird and that its garrulity becomes troublesome  Specific character of the  Gracula Religiosa    It is violet black with a white spot on the wings and a naked yellow stripe on the back of the head  It is ten inches and a half long lives upon fruits cherries grapes c    VARIETIES of the MAINATE  I The MAINATE of Brisson It differs from ours because it has on the middle of the first quills of the wing a white spot which does not appear in the coloured figure whether that it did not exist in the subject or escaped the desinger we may observe that the edge of the first quills is black even where the white spot crosses them  II The MAINATE of Bontius Its plumage is blue of many tints and consequently somewhat different from that of ours which is black with reflexions of blue green violet c Another remarkable difference is that this blue ground was strewed with specks like those of the Stare in point of shape and arrangement but different with regard to colour for Bontius subjoins that they are cinereousgray  III The LITTLE MAINATE of Edwards It has the white spot of Brisson's on its wings but what distinguishes it sufficiently is that the two crests uniting behind the  occiput  form a half crown which stretches from one eye to the other Edwards dissected one which was a female and notwithstanding the disproportion in point of size he leaves it to be decided whether it was not a female of the following  IV The GREAT MAINATE of Edwards  Gracula Religiosa var  Linn  and  Gmel  The Greater Minor  Edw  and  Lath  Its crest is the same as in the preceding and it differs from that only in size and in slight variations of colour It is nearly the bulk of the Jay and consequently double the preceding and the yellow of the bill and legs has no reddish tingeWe are not informed whether the crest of all these Mainates is subject to change of colour according to the different seasons of the year and the various passions by which they are actuated  The GOULIN  Camel in the Philosophical Transactions for says that the  Goulin  is known in the Philippine islands by the names of  Iting    Illing  and  Tabadura  He adds that it is a species of  Palalaca  which is a Great Woodpecker In this last assertion he is perhaps mistaken but there is little doubt that his  Gulin  or  Goulin  is the bird now under consideration His description is as follows  It is of the bulk of the Stare its bill its wings its tail and its legs are black the rest silvery the head is naked except a line of black feathers that runs on the crown It sings and chatters much    Gracula Calva  Linn and Gmel  Merula Calva Philippensis  Briss  The Bald Grakle  Lath  THERE are two specimens of this species in the Royal Cabinet In both the upperpart of the body is of a light silvergray the tail and wings darker each eye encircled by a bit of skin entirely bare and forming an irregular ellipse inclined on its side the eye being the inner focus lastly on the crown of the head is a line of blackish feathers which runs between these two skins but one of these birds is much larger than the other The largest is nearly of the bulk of the common Blackbird the underpart of its body is brown varied with some white spots the naked skin which surrounds the eyes fleshcoloured the bill the legs and the nails black In the smaller the underpart of  the body is of a yellowish brown the bald parts of the head yellow and also the legs the nails and the anterior part of the bill Poivre informs us that this naked skin sometimes yellow sometimes fleshcoloured which surrounds the eyes is painted with a bright orange when the bird is angry and this must probably happen likewise in the spring when the bird burns with a passion as impetuous but more gentle I retain the name of  Goulin  which it receives in the Philippines because it is distinguished from the Blackbird not only by the bald part on its head but by the shape and thickness of its bill  Sonnerat has brought from the Philippines a bald bird which resembles much the one figured No  Pl Enl  but differs in the size and plumage It is near a foot in length the two bits of naked skin which encircle the eyes are fleshcoloured and parted from the crown of the head by a line of black feathers which runs between them All the other feathers which surround this naked skin are also of fine black and so is the underpart of the body the wings and the tail the upperpart of the body is gray but this colour is lighter on the rump and neck deeper on the back and the loins The bill is blackish the wings very short and scarcely extend beyond the origin of the tail If the two bald Blackbirds in the Royal Cabinet belong to the same species we must regard the larger as a young subject which had not attained its full  growth or received its true colours and the smaller as one still younger  These birds commonly nestle in the holes of trees especially on the cocoanut tree they live on fruits and are very voracious which has given rise to the vulgar notion that they have only one intestine which extends straight from the orifice of the stomach to the anus  Specific character of the  Gracula Calva    It is somewhat ashcoloured its head naked on both sides    The PARADISE GRAKLE  Le Martin  Buff  Paradisea Tristis  Linn and Gmel  Gracula Tristis  Lath Ind  Merula Philippensis  Briss  THIS bird feeds upon insects and the havoc which it makes is the more considerable as it has a gluttonous appetite the various sorts of flies and caterpillars are its prey Like the Carrion Crows and Magpies it hovers about the horses the oxen and the hogs in search of the vermin which often torment these animals to such a degree as to exhaust them and even occasion death The patient Quadrupedes are glad to get rid of these and suffer without molestation often ten or twelve Paradise Grakles to perch on their back at once but the intruders are not content with this indulgence the skin need not be laid bare by some wound the birds will peck with their bill into the raw flesh and do more injury than the vermin which they extract They may indeed be considered as carnivorous birds whose prudence directs them to attack openly none but the weak and the feeble A young one was known to seize a rat two inches long exclusive of the tail dash it repeatedly against the board of its cage break the  bones and reduce every limb to a pliancy suited to its views and then lay hold of it by the head and almost in an instant swallow it entire It rested about a quarter of an hour to digest it its wings drooping and its air languid but after that interval it ran with its usual cheerfulness and about an hour afterwards having found another rat it swallowed that as it did the first and with as little inconvenience  This bird is also very fond of grasshoppers and as it destroys immense quantities it is a valuable guest in countries cursed with these insects and it merits to have its history interwoven with that of man It is found in India and the Philippines and probably in the intermediate islands but it has long been unknown in that of Bourbon Not above twenty years ago DesforgesBoucher Governorgeneral and Poivre the Intendant perceiving this island desolated by grasshoppers  These grasshoppers had been introduced from Madagascar their eggs being conveyed in the soil with some plants  deliberated seriously about the means of extirpating these insects and for that purpose brought several pairs of Paradise Grakles from India with the view to multiply them and oppose them as auxiliaries to their formidable enemies This plan promised to succeed when unfortunately some of the colonists noticing these birds eagerly boring in the newsown fields fancied that they were searching for grain  were instantly alarmed and reported through the whole island that the Paradise Grakle was pernicious The cause was considered in form in defence of the birds it was urged that they raked in newploughed grounds not for the grain but on account of the insects and were so far beneficial However they were proscribed by the council and two hours after the sentence was passed not one was to be found in the island This prompt execution was followed by a speedy repentance The grasshoppers gained an ascendency and the people who only view the present regretted the loss of the Paradise Grakles De Morave consulting the inclinations of the settlers procured four of these birds eight years after their proscription They were received with transports of joy Their preservation and breeding were made a state affair the laws held out to them protection and the physicians on their part declared that their flesh was unwholesome After so many and so powerful expedients the desired effect was produced the Paradise Grakles multiplied and the grasshoppers were entirely extirpated But an opposite inconvenience has arisen the birds supported no longer by insects have had recourse to fruits and have fed on the mulberries grapes and dates They have even scraped up the grains of wheat rice maize and beans they have rifled the pigeonhouses and preyed on the young and thus after freeing the settlers from the  grasshoppers they have themselves become a more dreadful scourge  They are still more pernicious as they devour the useful insects particularly that called the  Little Lion  which preys upon the woolly lice that so much injure the coffeeshrubs  Their rapid multiplication renders it difficult to stop their progress unless perhaps a body of more powerful rapacious birds were employed against them a plan which would soon be attended with other difficulties The great secret would be to maintain a certain number of Paradise Grakles and at the same time to contrive to restrain their farther multiplication Perhaps an attentive observation of the nature and instincts of grasshoppers would suggest a method of getting rid of them without having recourse to such expensive auxiliaries  These birds are not timorous and are little disturbed by the report of a musket They commonly take possession of certain trees or even certain rows of trees often very near hamlets to pass the night They alight in an evening in such immense bodies that the branches are entirely covered with them and the leaves concealed When thus assembled they all begin to chatter together and their noisy society is exceedingly troublesome to their neighbours Yet their natural song is pleasant varied and extensive In the morning they disperse into the fields either in small flocks or in pairs according to the season  They have two hatches in succession every year the first being in the middle of spring These turn out well unless the season be rainy Their nests are very rude and they take no precaution to prevent the wet from penetrating They fasten them in the leaves of the palm or other trees and whenever an opportunity presents they prefer a hayloft These birds are warmly attached to their young When their nests are about to be robbed they flutter round and utter a sort of croaking which indicates their rage and dart upon the plunderer Nor do their fruitless exertions extinguish their affection they follow their brood which if set in a window or open place the parents will carefully supply with food nor will they in the least be deterred by anxiety for their own safety  The young Paradise Grakles are quickly trained and easily learn to prattle If kept in the poultryyard they spontaneously mimic the cries of all the domestic animals hens cocks geese dogs sheep c and their chattering is accompanied with certain accents and gestures which are full of prettinesses  These birds are rather larger than the Blackbirds their bill and legs are yellow as in these but longer and the tail shorter The head and neck are blackish behind the eye is a naked reddish skin of a triangular shape the lowerpart of the breast and all the upperpart of the  body including the coverts of the wings and of the tail of a chesnut brown the belly white the twelve quills of the tail and the middle quills of the wings brown the large ones blackish from the tip to the middle and thence to their origin white which produces an oblong spot of that colour near the edge of each wing when it is closed and in this situation the wings extend to twothirds of the tail  It is scarcely possible to distinguish the female from the male by the external appearance  The principal facts in the history of this bird were communicated by M M Sonnerat and De la Nux correspondents of the Cabinet of Natural History    N  o  THE CHATTERER  The CHATTERER  In  Aristotle lib ix  which signifies a sort of matrass or pillow alluding to the silky feathers of the Chatterer Aldrovandus gives it the name  Ampelis  from not the best authority that of the poet Callimachus This word  Ampelis  was besides applied to other small birds such as the Beccafico which like the Chatterer feeds upon grapes  denotes  a vine  Some have reckoned it improperly the  Merops  of Aristotle which is the  Beeeater  others have taken it for the  Avis Incendiaria  of the ancients or the bird of the Hercynian forest mentioned by Pliny though its feathers do not cast fire at night as alleged of that bird unless this was a metaphorical allusion to the colour of the Chatterer's eyes and the tears on its wings This bird has also been called  Avis Bohemica    Adepellus    Pteroclia    Fullo    GallulusSylvestris    Zinzirella  which last is formed from its cry  zi    zi    ri  and the German name  Zinzerelle  has the same derivation In that language it is also termed  Boehmer    Boeheimle    BoehmischeDrostel    HaubenDrostel  hood thrush  PestVogel  noxious

Silk Tail  Ray  The Bohemian Chatterer  Penn and Lath  THIS bird is distinguished from all others by the small red appendices which terminate most of the middle quills of the wings these appendices are nothing but the projection of  the shafts beyond the webs which as they spread extend into the shape of a pallet and assume a red colour Sometimes as many have been reckoned as eight appendices on each side some assert that the males have seven and the females five others that the females have none at all  Edwards  For my own part I have seen specimens which had seven in the one wing and five in the other others which had only three and others which had none and at the same time exhibited other differences in the plumage Lastly I have observed these appendices sometimes parted longitudinally into two branches nearly equal instead of forming as usual the little pallets of a single piece  Linnaeus has with great propriety separated this bird from the Thrushes and Blackbirds observing besides the small red appendices which distinguish it that its proportions are different its bill shorter more hooked and armed with a double tooth or scallop which appears near the ends of both mandibles  Dr Lister asserts that he observed in one of these birds that the edges of the upper mandible were not notched near the tip this may be regarded as an individual variety but the remark corrected a mistake of the Doctor's who had like Linnaeus  In the  Fauna Suecica  the Chatterer is termed  Lanius Garrulus  T  classed the Chatterer with the Shrikes  But it is not easy to conceive why he should range it with the Shrikes while he admits that it feeds on berries  and is by no means carnivorous There is indeed a considerable resemblance between these and the Shrikes and RedBacks in the disposition of the colours particularly on the head in the shape of the bill c but the difference of instinct is more important and ought to preclude their association  It is not easy to determine the native climate of this bird We should be much deceived if from the names of Bohemian Jay Bohemian Chatterer c we inferred with Gesner Brisson and others that Bohemia is its principal abode It only migrates thither as into many other countries  Frisch  In Austria it is conceived to be a native of Bohemia and of Stiria because it enters by the frontiers of these regions but in Bohemia it might be called the bird of Saxony and in Saxony the bird of Denmark or of other countries on the shores of the Baltic The English trades assured Dr Lister that for near a century past the Chatterers were very common in Prussia Rzaczynski tells us that they visit Great and Little Poland and Lithuania Reaumur was informed from Dresden that they breed in the neighbourhood of Petersburg Linnaeus mentions seemingly on good authority that they spend the summer and consequently breed in the countries beyond Sweden but his correspondents did not communicate the detail of  circumstances Lastly Strahlemberg told Frisch that they are found in Tartary in the holes of the rocks and no doubt they must build their nests in these But whatever be the country which the Chatterers choose for their residence where they enjoy the sweets of existence and transmit them to new generations it is certain that they are not sedentary but make their excursions over all Europe They sometimes appear in the North of England  The subject figured and described in the British Zoology was killed on FlamboroughMoor Yorkshire The two which Dr Lister saw were killed near the city of York  See  Philosophical Transactions No Art  in France  A few years since a Chatterer was killed at Marcilly near the FertéLowendhal and lately four were taken at Beauce in the heart of winter which had taken shelter in a pigeonhouse  SALERNE  Italy  Aldrovandus  and no doubt in Spain but this last is conjectural for we must own that the natural history of this charming country so rich and so contiguous inhabited by a people so renowned is not better known to us than that of California or of Japan  Bowles' Natural History of Spain  has been since published T  Gesner says that he never saw the Chatterer and that it is almost every where very rare We may at least conclude that it is rare in Switzerland    The migrations of the Chatterers are in every country pretty regular with regard to the season but if these be annual as Aldrovandus was told the birds by no means pursue constantly  the same route The young Prince Adam d'Aversperg Chamberlain of their Imperial Majesties and one of the Lords of Bohemia who possesses the most extensive chasegrounds and makes the noblest use of them since he aims at the progress of Natural History informs us in a Memoir addressed to the Count de Buffon  This Prince sent with his Memoir a stuffed Chatterer from his collection and presented it to the Royal Cabinet  that this bird flits every three or four years  Others say every five years and others every seven years  GESNER  from the mountains of Bohemia and Stiria into Austria in the beginning of the autumn that it returns about the end of that season and that even in Bohemia not one is seen during the winter However it is said in Silesia the winter is the time when these birds are found on mountains Those which have strayed into France and England appeared in the depth of the winter but always in small numbers a circumstance which would shew that they were parted from the great body by some accident and too much fatigued or too young to recover their route We might also infer that France England and even Sweden are not situated in the course of the principal migration but we cannot draw the same conclusion with regard to Italy for immense numbers of these birds have there been several times observed to arrive This was particularly the  case in in the month of December at that time it was not uncommon to see flocks of an hundred or more and forty were often caught at once The same event took place in February  As Italy is warmer than Germany they might appear there later and I doubt not but in more northern countries they remain a great part of the winter in years when it is not rigorous  when Charles V caused himself to be crowned at Bologna for in countries where these birds appear at distant intervals their visits form an epoch in political history especially since when they are very numerous they announce to the frightened imaginations of the people war and pestilence From these calamities we must however except that of earthquakes for in when the Charterers again appeared it was observed that they spread through Modena Placentia and almost all parts of Italy  Aldrovandus  but constantly avoided Ferrara as if they had a  presentiment  of the earthquake which happened soon after and dispersed even the birds of that country  We cannot well assign the cause that determines these birds to leave their ordinary residence and to roam into distant climes It is not excessive cold for they are embodied for their expedition as early as the beginning of autumn and besides their migration is only occasional happening once in three or four years or only after six or seven years and their numerous  host often darkens the heavens  Gesner  Are we to ascribe these migrations to their prodigious multiplication like the locusts and those rats of the north called  lemings  and as has happened to the human species when they were less civilized and consequently stronger and more independent of the equilibrium which at length establishes itself between all the powers of nature Or are the Chatterers compelled repeatedly by local scarcity to quit their abodes and seek subsistence in other climates It is said that they penetrate far into the arctic regions and this is confirmed by Count Strahlenberg who as we have already noticed saw them in Tartary  When the Chatterer resides in wine countries it seems fondest of grapes whence Aldrovandus calls it  Ampelis  or  Vine Bird  Next to these it feeds upon the berries of privet of bramble of juniper of laurel upon almonds apples sorbs wild gooseberries figs and in general upon melting juicy fruits The one which Aldrovandus kept near three months would not eat ivyberries or raw flesh till driven to extremity and never touched grain That which they tried to breed in the  menagerie  at Vienna was fed upon crumbs of white bread mashed carrots bruised hempseed and juniper berries  which it preferred  Memoire of the Prince d'Aversperg  but in spite of all the care which was taken it lived only five or six days Not that the Chatterer is difficult to tame but that a bird which has roamed at will and been accustomed to provide its own subsistence thrives always best in the state of liberty Reaumur remarks that the Chatterers love cleanliness and when confined they constantly void their excrements in the same spot  See  Salerne p    These birds are entirely of a social disposition they commonly fly in flocks and sometimes form immense bodies Beside this general amicable turn and independent of their attachment to the females they are susceptible of particular friendships to individuals of the same sex But their affectionate temper which implies more gentleness than activity more security than discernment more simplicity than prudence more sensibility than vigour precipitates them oftener into danger than such as are more selfish Accordingly these birds are reckoned the most stupid and they are caught in the greatest numbers They are generally taken with the Thrush which migrates about the same time and their flesh has nearly the same taste  Gesner tells us that their flesh is very delicate served up at the best tables and the liver especially highly valued The Prince d'Aversperg assures us that it is better tasted than that of the Thrush and Blackbird On the other hand Schwenckfeld says that it is very indifferent eating and unwholesome This must depend much on the quality of the substances on which the bird feeds  which is natural to suppose since they live upon the same  food I shall add that many of them are killed at once for they sit close together  Frisch    They utter their cry as they rise from the ground this is  zi    zi    ri  according to Frisch and all those who have seen them alive it is rather a chirrup than a song and hence their name of  Chatterer  Reaumur will not even admit that they can chant but Prince d'Aversperg says that their notes are very pleasant Perhaps in countries where they breed they may warble in the season of love while they only chirp or chatter in other places and when confined in cages they may be totally silent  The plumage is agreeable when the bird is still but when it displays its wings expands its tail and erects its crest in the act of flying its appearance is charming Its eyes which are of a beautiful red shine with uncommon lustre in the middle of the black band in which they are placed This black extends under the throat and quite round the bill the different shades of wine colour on its head back and breast and the ash colour of the rump are surrounded with a frame enamelled with white with yellow and with red formed by the different spots of the wings and tail the latter is cinereous at its origin blackish in its middle and yellow at its  end the quills of the wings are blackish the third and fourth are marked with white near the tip the five following marked with yellow and most of these terminated with broad tears of a red colour of which I have spoken in the beginning of this article The bill and legs are black and shorter in proportion than in the Blackbird The total length of the bird is according to Brisson seven inches and threequarters its tail two and a quarter its bill nine lines its legs the same and its alar extent thirteen inches For my part I have observed that the dimensions were all greater than here stated owing perhaps to difference of age or sex or even between the individuals  I am not acquainted with the plumage of the young Chatterers but Aldrovandus tells us that the margin of the tail is of a duller yellow in the females and that the middle quills have whitish marks and not yellow as in the males He adds a circumstance which is hard to believe though he asserts it from his own observation that in the females the tail consists of twelve quills but in the males of ten only It is much more credible that the male specimens examined by Aldrovandus had lost two of their quills  Specific character of the  Ampelis Garrulus    The back of its head is crested the secondary wingquills are membranous and coloured at the tip    VARIETY of the CHATTERER  We may observe that the Chatterer is proportionably much broader across the wings than the Blackbird or Thrushes Aldrovandus has also remarked that the  sternum  is of a shape better adapted for cutting the air and accelerating its course We need not then be surprised that it performs such distant journies in Europe and since it spends the summer in the countries of the north we should naturally expect to discover it in America And this is actually the case Reaumur received several from Canada where they were called  Recollet  It is the  Caquantototl  of Fernandez  on account of the resemblance perceived between the crest and a monk's frock From Canada they could easily spread into the southern colonies Catesby describes them among the birds of Carolina Fernandez saw them in Mexico near Tezcuco  He says that it delights to dwell in the mountains that it lives on small seeds that its song is ordinary that its flesh is indifferent food  I have examined some which were sent from Cayenne This bird is not above an ounce in weight according to Catesby its crest when erected is pyramidal its bill is black with a large opening its eyes placed on a bar of the same colour separated from the ground by two white streaks the extremity of the tail edged  with a shining white the upperpart of the head the throat and the back hazel with a winetinge the coverts and quills of the wings the lowerpart of the back the rump and a great part of the tail of different shades of cinereous the breast and the inferior coverts of the tail whitish the belly and flanks of a pale yellow It appears from this description and from the measures which have been taken that the American Chatterer is rather smaller than the European sort that its wings have less of the enamel and are rather of a duskier hue and that the wings do not extend so far in proportion as the tail But it is undoubtedly the same species for seven or eight middle quills of its wing are terminated by the little red appendices Brooke surgeon in Maryland told Edwards that the females wanted these appendices and that the colours of their plumage were not so bright as those of the males The Cayenne Chatterers which I examined had really not these appendices and the shades of the plumage were in general fainter as it commonly happens in the females  N  o  FIG THE HAWFINCH FIG THE COMMON CROSSBILL  The GROSBEAK  Its Greek and Latin name  Coccothraustes  is derived from  a  grain  or  kernel  and  to  break  because it feeds upon cherrystones However that appellation might have been given to some other bird that had the same habit for Hesychius and Varro the only ancient authors in whose writings the word is found say no more than that  the  Coccothraustes  is a certain bird  In Italy it is called  Frosone    Frisone    Grisone    Franguet del Re    Franguet Montano  in Germany  HeineBysser    Bollebiek    KirschFinck    KernBeisz    Risch Leske  in Switzerland  Klepper  in Sweden  Talbin    Le GrosBec  Buff  LoxiaCoccothraustes  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes  Gesner Aldrov Briss c  The Grosbeak  or  Hawsinch  Will Edw c  THIS bird is an inhabitant of the temperate climates from Spain and Italy as far as Sweden The species though rather stationary is not numerous It appears every year in some of the provinces of France and leaves them only for a short time in the severest winters  It is difficult to reconcile this remark of which I am certain with the account given by the authors of the British Zoology that the Grosbeak is seldom seen in England and never except in winter Perhaps as there are few forests in England there are also few of these birds which reside only in the woods and as they approach the hamlets only in winter observers may never have seen them but in that season  It generally inhabits in the woods during the summer and sometimes the vineyards and in winter it resorts near the hamlets and farms It is a silent bird which is seldom heard and seems  to have no song or decided warble Nor is its organ of hearing so perfect as that of other birds for though it resides in the forests it cannot be enticed by the call Gesner and most naturalists after him have said that the Grosbeak is good eating I have tasted the flesh but it seemed neither pleasant nor juicy  I have observed in Burgundy that these birds are much fewer in winter than in summer and that great numbers of them arrive about the th of April in small flocks and perch among the copses building their nests  A Grosbeak's nest was found the th of April on a plumtree ten or twelve feet high in the fork of a branch it was of a round hemispherical shape composed externally with small roots and some lichens and internally with other small roots more slender it contained four eggs somewhat pointed their great diameter nine or ten lines their small diameter six lines they were marked with spots of an olive brown and with irregular blackish streaks faintly impressed on a ground of bluish lightgreen Note communicated by  M Gueneau de Montbeillard  on trees generally at the height of ten or twelve feet where the boughs divide from the trunk The materials are like those of the Turtle dry sticks matted with small roots They commonly lay five bluish eggs spotted with brown We might suppose that they breed only once ayear since the species is not numerous They feed their young with insects chrysalids c and when they are about to be robbed of their family they make a vigorous defence and bite fiercely Their thick strong bill enables them to crack nuts and other hard substances and though  they are granivorous they also live much upon insects I have kept them a long time in voleries they reject flesh but readily eat any thing else They must be confined in a separate cage for without seeming at all discomposed or making the least noise they kill the weaker birds that are lodged with them They attack not by striking with the point of the bill but by biting out a morsel of the skin When at liberty they live upon all sorts of grain and kernels of fruits and Orioles eat the pulp of cherries but the Grosbeaks break them to obtain the kernel they feed also on fir and pine cones and on beech mast c  This bird is solitary shy and silent its ear is insensible and its prolific powers are inferior to those of most other birds It seems to have its qualities concentrated in itself and is not subject to any of the varieties which almost all proceed from the luxuriance of nature The male and female are of the same size and much resemble each other The species is uniform in our climate but in foreign countries there exist many analogous birds which shall be enumerated in the succeeding article  The uppermandible is cinereous but of a lighter tint near the base the lowermandible is cinereous at the edges which close into the upper its underside is fleshcoloured with a cinereous cast The tongue is fleshy small and pointed the gizzard is very muscular preceded by a pouch containing in summer bruised hempseeds green caterpillars almost entire and very small stones In a subject which I dissected lately the intestinal tube from the  pharynx  to the craw was three inches and an half long and from the gizzard to the  anus  about a foot It had no  caecum  or gallbladder  Observations communicated by M Guencau de Montbeillard    the d April      Specific character of the  Loxia Coccothraustes    It has a white line on the wings the middle quills of the wings are rhomboidshaped at the tips the quills of the tail are black on the thinner side of the base    The CROSSBILL  Gesner gave it the name  Loxia  from the Greek    oblique  on account of the crossing of its bill In Germany it is called  KreutzSchnabel  Crossbill  KreutzVogel  in Poland  Rzywonos  in Sweden  Korsnaef    Kiaegelrifware    Le Bec Croisé  Buff  Loxia Curvirostra  Linn and Gmel  Loxia  Gesner Aldrov Briss c  The ShellApple  or  Crossbill  Will Edw c  THE species of the Crossbill is closely related to that of the Grosbeak Both have the same size the same figure the same instincts  Frisch conceives them to be so nearly allied that they would breed together  The Crossbill is distinguished only by a sort of deformity in its bill a character or rather a defect which belongs to it alone of all the winged tribe What proves that it is a defect an error of nature rather than a permanent feature is that it is variable the bill in some subjects crosses to the left in others to the right but the productions of nature are regular in their developement and uniform in their arrangement I should therefore impute this difference of position to the way in which the bird has used its bill according as it has been more accustomed to employ the one side or the other to lay hold of its food The same takes place in men who  from habit prefer the right hand to the left  This observation must be qualified If habit were the sole cause of this difference as many people would be lefthanded as righthanded But the number of the former is very small compared with that of the latter and therefore the righthand must by original constitution be stronger than the left however much the difference is afterwards increased from habit The same reasoning seems applicable to the Crossbill T  Each mandible of the Crossbill is affected by an exuberance of growth so that in time the two points are parted asunder and the bird can take its food only by the side and hence if it oftener uses the left the bill will protrude to the right and  vice versâ  But every thing has its utility and each sentient being learns to draw advantage even from its defects This bill hooked upwards and downwards and bent in opposite directions seems to have been formed for the purpose of detaching the scales of fircones and obtaining the seeds lodged beneath these which are the principal food of the bird It raises each scale with its lower mandible and breaks it off with the upper it may be observed to perform this manoeuvre in its cage This bill also assists its owner in climbing and it dextrously mounts from the lower to the upper bars of its cage From its mode of scrambling and the beauty of its colours it has been called by some  the German Parrot  The Crossbill inhabits only the cold climates or the mountains in temperate countries It is found in Sweden in Poland in Germany in Switzerland and among the Alps and Pyrenees It is quite stationary in countries where it lives the whole year but sometimes it accidentally appears in large flocks in other regions In and great numbers were seen in the neighbourhood of London They do not arrive at stated seasons but seem to be rather directed by chance and many years pass without their being at all observed The NutCrackers and some other birds are subject to the same irregular migrations which occur only once in twenty or thirty years The only cause which can be assigned is that they have been deprived of their usual subsistence in the climates where they inhabit by the inclemency of the season or have been driven upon the coast by the violence of a storm or hurricane for they arrive in such numbers and appear so much exhausted that they are careless of their existence and allow themselves to be caught by the hand  We might presume that the species of the Crossbill which prefers the cold climates would be found in the north of the New Continent as in that of the Old yet no traveller to America has taken notice of it But besides the general presumption which is verified by analogy there is a fact which seems to prove our opinion the  Crossbill is found in Greenland whence it was brought to Edwards by the whalefishers and that naturalist who was better acquainted than any person with the nature of birds remarks properly that both the land and the water sort which inhabit the arctic regions appear indifferently in the north of America or of Europe  The Crossbill is one of those birds whose colours are the most subject to vary among a great number we can scarcely find two individuals that are exactly similar not only are the shades of the plumage different but the position of the colours change with the season and the age Edwards who examined a prodigious number of them and sought to mark the limits of variation paints the male with a rose colour and the female with a yellowish green but in both the bill the eyes the thighs and the legs are precisely the same in regard to shape and colours Gesner tells us that he kept one of these birds which was blackish in September and assumed a red colour in October He adds that the parts where the red began to appear were the underside of the neck the breast and the belly that this red afterwards became yellow and that winter especially is the season when these changes take place and that at different times it is said they receive a red yellow green and cinereous cast We must not therefore with our modern nomenclators reckon as a separate species or a particular variety a  greenish Crossbill  Loxia Pyrenaica  Barrere  Loxia Rufescens  Brisson  found in the Pyrenees since it occurs equally in other places and in certain seasons it has in all countries that colour According to Frisch who was perfectly acquainted with these birds which are common in Germany the colour of the adult male is reddish or green mixed with red but they lose this red like the Linnets when they are kept in the cage and only retain the green which is more deeply impressed both in the young and in the old For this reason they are called in some parts of Germany  krinis  or  grünitz  that is greenish bird The two extreme colours have not therefore been well chosen by Edwards we must not infer as his figures would suggest that the male is red and the female green there is every reason to believe that in the same season and at the same age the female differs from the male only in the greater faintness of the colours  This bird which is so analogous to the Grosbeak resembles it also in stupidity One may approach it fire upon it without scaring it and sometimes even catch it by the hand and as it is equally inactive and secure it falls an easy victim to all the birds of prey It is mute in summer and its feeble notes are only heard in winter  GESNER  It is quite placid in captivity and  lives long in a cage It is fed with bruised hempseed and this contributes to make it sooner lose its red  Frisch  In summer its flesh is said to be good eating  Gesner and Frisch    These birds delight only in the dark forests of pines and firs and seem to dread the effulgence of day Nor do they yield to the genial influence of the seasons it is not in spring but in the depth of winter that their loves commence They build as early as January and their young are grown before the other birds begin to lay They place their nests under the large branches of the pine fixing them with the resin of that tree and besmearing them with that substance so that the melted snow or the rains cannot penetrate In the young as in those of other birds the bill or rather corners of its opening are yellow and they hold it always open as long as they are fed by the mother We are not told how many eggs they lay but we may presume from their size and their resemblance to the Grosbeak that the number is four or five and that they hatch only once ayear  Specific character of the Crossbill  Loxia Curvirostra  LINN  It is red its bill forked  It is of the size of a Lark being six inches and a half long  FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE GROSBEAK  I  THE EastIndia bird delineated in the  Pl Enl  No fig under the name of  Coromandel Grosbeak  and which name we have still retained because it appears to be the same species with that of Europe The shape the size the bill the length of the tail are the same in both and the only difference consists in the colours which are also disposed in the same order In short we may impute the difference of shade to the influence of climate and consider this Coromandel bird which no naturalist has taken notice of as a beautiful variety of the European Grosbeak  II  The American bird No  Pl Enl  termed  the Blue American Grosbeak  on which we have bestowed no discriminating name because we  are not certain if it is a peculiar species different from that of Europe for in size and figure it is the same with our Grosbeak The only difference is that it has more red on its bill and more blue in its plumage and if its tail were not longer we should not hesitate to pronounce that it is a mere variety occasioned by the influence of climate No naturalist has noticed this new variety or species which we must be careful not to confound with the Carolina bird called by Catesby  the Blue Grosbeak  III The HARDBILL  Le DurBec  Buff  Loxia Enucleator  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Canadensis  Briss  The Greatest Bulfinch  Edw  The Pine Grosbeak  Penn and Lath  The Canada bird delineated  Pl Enl  No fig under the name of  Canada Grosbeak  and which we have called  Hard bill  because its bill is comparatively harder shorter and stronger than in the others and it was proper to apply to it a distinct name since it differs not only from the European Grosbeaks but from all those of America and of other climates It is of a beautiful red as large as our Grosbeak  but longer tailed and may be easily distinguished from all the other birds by the inspection of the coloured figure The female has only a little reddish on its head and rump and a slight tinge of rosecolour on the lowerpart of its body Salerne tells us that in Canada this bird is called  bouvreuil Bulfinch  This name has not been ill applied for there is perhaps an affinity between it and the Bulsinch The inhabitants of that part of America could decide this point by a very simple observation  viz  by noticing whether it whistles almost continually like the Bulsinch or is almost mute like the Grosbeak  Specific character of the  Loxia Enucleator    It has a double white line on the wings and all the quills of its tail are blackish  It is about nine inches long Found in all the northern parts of America from Canada to the western side of the continent It arrives in Hudson's Bay early in the spring lodges among the pines and junipers builds its nest at a small height from the ground lays four eggs which it hatches in June These birds occur also in the north of Europe and Asia They are frequent in Russia and Siberia and Mr Pennant tells us that he saw them in the pine forests near Invercauld Aberdeenshire in the month of August    IV The CRESTED CARDINAL  Le Cardiual Huppé  Linn and Gmel  Loxia Cardinalis  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Virginiana  Briss  Coccothraustes Indica Cristata  Ray and Will  The Red Grosbeak  Albin  The Red Bird  Kalm's Travels  The Virginia Nightingale  Will  The Cardinal Crosbeak  Penn and Lath  This is a native of the temperate climates of America and figured No  Pl Enl  by the name of the  Virginia Grosbeak  It is also called the  Crested Cardinal  which name we retain as denoting its two characters its colour and its crest This bird resembles much the Pine Grosbeak the size and in a great measure the plumage are the same the bill is as strong the tail of the same length and the climate is nearly the same We might therefore but for the crest reckon it a variety of that beautiful species The colours in the male are much brighter than in the female whose plumage is not red but only reddishbrown its bill is also of a much fainter red though both have the crest I should range this bird rather with the Bulfinch and the Chaffinch than with the Grosbeak since it sings agreeably whereas the Grosbeak is silent Salerne say that the warble of  N  o  THE CRESTED CARDINAL  the Crested Cardinal is charming and resembles the song of the Nightingale and that it can be taught also to speak like the Canary birds He adds that this bird which he observed alive is bold strong and vigorous that it feeds upon seeds particularly those of millet and is easily tamed  Specific character of the  Loxia Cardinalis    Its head is red its bridle black its bill and legs bloodcoloured  It is nine inches long is found through the whole extent of North America It feeds chiefly on Indian corn of which it makes a provision for the winter artfully concealing the deposit with leaves and small branches It warbles delightfully in the spring mornings on the summits of the loftiest trees Its song is said to resemble that of the Throstle It is a hardy and familiar bird    The four birds which we have just mentioned are all nearly of the same size with the European Grosbeak But there are many other intermediate or smaller species which we shall range according to their size and climate and which though all different from each other may best be compared with the Grosbeaks to which they are more analogous than to any other We may name them the  Middle Grosbeaks  and the  Little Grosbeaks  V The ROSETHROAT  Loxia Ludoviciana  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Ludoviciana  Briss  The Redbreasted Grosbeak  Penn and Lath  The first of these species of the middle size is that of the  Pl Enl  No fig termed  the Grosbeak of Louisiana  Its throat is of a fine red rose colour and differs so much from all other species of the same genus that it merits a distinct name Brisson first mentioned this bird and has given a tolerably good figure of it but he says nothing of its habits The settlers in Louisiana could inform us  Specific character of the  Loxia Ludoviciana    It is black its breast its belly the stripe on its wings and the base of its tailquills are white  The female is spotted with white on the head It inhabits the greater part of North America In the State of NewYork it is reckoned a scarce bird It appears there in May and retires in August    VI The GRIVELIN  Loxia Brasiliana  Lath  The second species of the middling Grosbeaks is Fig No  Pl Enl  and there  termed the  Brazilian Grosbeak  We have given it the name of  Grivelin  because the underpart of its body is speckled like as in the Thrushes  grives  As it is a beautiful bird and unlike any other it merited an appropriated name It seems to be much related to the bird mentioned by Marcgrave and which is called in Brazil  Guira    Tirica  However as the short description given by that author does not exactly correspond with our Grivelin we cannot decide with regard to the identity of the species  These middlesized species and those still smaller are much more like the Sparrow in point of bulk and shape but we have allowed them to remain with the Grosbeak because their bill resembles that of these birds and is much broader at the base than that of the Sparrow  VII The RED BLACK  The third species of the middlesized Grosbeak is the bird delineated Fig No  Pl Enl  under the name of  the Cayenne Grosbeak  We have called it the  Red Black  because the whole of its body is red and the breast and belly black This bird which is brought from Cayenne has been noticed by no naturalist but  as we did not see it alive we cannot describe its habits The people of Guiana could instruct us in that point  VIII The FLAVERT  i e  The yellowgreen    Loxia Canadensis  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Cayanensis  Briss  The Canada Grosbeak  Penn and Lath  The fourth species of these foreign middlesized Grosbeaks is the bird Fig No  Pl Enl  termed  the Cayenne Grosbeak  It is yellow and green and therefore differs from the preceding almost as much as it can do with regard to colours but as its size the shape of its body and of its bill and its climate are the same we may reckon it a species closely related to the Red Black if it be not a variety arising merely from the difference of age or sex Brisson is the first who took notice of it  Specific character of the  Loxia Canadensis    It is olivegreen above oliveyellow its bridle black  IX The FANTAILED GROSBEAK  La Queue en Eventail  Buff  Loxia Flabellifera  Gmel  The fifth species of these birds is that figured  Pl Enl  No under the name of  the Fantail of Virginia  We received it from that part of America and it has not been noticed by any preceding author The upper figure No represents probably the male and the under the female for its colours are not so vivid We received these birds alive but not being able to preserve them we could not decide whether we should attribute the differences to sex or to age They are so remarkable for the shape of their tail which is expanded horizontally that this character alone is sufficient to distinguish them from others of the same genus  Specific character of the  Loxia Flabellifera    It is duskyred which below is more dilute its bill its wingquills its tail and its legs are black  It is five inches long    X The PADDA or RICEBIRD  Loxia Oryzivora  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Sinensis Cinerea  Briss  The Java Grosbeak  Lath  The sixth species is the Chinese bird described and figured by Edwards and which he names  Padda  or  RiceBird  because the Chinese call rice in the husk  padda  which is the food of this bird This author has painted two of these birds and supposes with great probability that  Pl  represents the male and  Pl  the female We had a male of this species which is delineated Fig No  Pl Enl  It is an exceedingly beautiful bird for besides the lustre of the colours its plumage is so perfectly regular that no feather projects beyond another but they appear covered entirely with down or rather with a sort of meal such as we perceive in plums which produces a fine gloss Edwards adds little to the description of this bird though he saw it alive He says only that it is very destructive among the plantations of rice that the traders to the EastIndies call it  the Javan  or  Indian Sparrow  that this appellation would imply that it is found in the EastIndies as well as in China but he is rather disposed to think that  the Europeans in their intercourse between China and Java had often carried these birds to that island and lastly that what proves them to be natives of China is they are painted on the Chinese paper and muslins  The species which we are now to describe are smaller than the preceding and consequently differ so much from our Grosbeaks that we could hardly refer them to the same genus did not the shape of their bill the figure of their body and even the order and position of its colours indicate that these birds though not exactly Grosbeaks are still nearer related to them than to any other genus  XI The TOUCNAM COURVI  Loxia Philippina  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Philippensis  Briss  The Philippine Grosbeak  Lath  The first of these small foreign Grosbeaks is the  Toucnam Courvi  of the Philippines of which Brisson has given a description with a figure of the male under the name of  the Philippine Grosbeak  and which is delineated Fig No  Pl Enl  by that denomination But we have  here preserved the name which it receives in its native climate because it differs from all the rest The female is of the same size with the male but its colours are different its head being brown and also the upperpart of its neck which in the male is yellow c Brisson gives also a figure and description of their nest  These birds construct a nest of a singular form It is composed of little interwoven fibres of leaves which form a sort of small pouch whose mouth is placed in one of the sides To this mouth is fitted a long passage composed of the same leafy fibres turned downwards with its aperture situated below so that the real entrance to the nest is entirely concealed These nests are fastened by their upperpart to the small branches of trees  BRISSON    Specific character of the  Loxia Philippina    It is dusky below yellowishwhite the top and breast yellow the throat dusky  XII The ORCHEF  Loxia Bengalensis  Linn and Gmel  Passer Bengalensis  Briss  The Bengal Sparrow  Alb  The Yellowheaded Indian Sparrow  Edw  The Bengal Grosbeak  Lath  The second of these little foreign Grosbeaks is the EastIndia bird delineated  Pl Enl  No Fig under the name of  Indian Grosbeak  I have termed it  goldhead Orchef  because  the upperpart of its head is of a fine yellow and being different from all the rest required a distinct nameThis species is new and has not been noticed by any preceding naturalist  Specific character of the  Loxia Bengalensis    It is gray with a yellow cap its temples whitish its lowerbelly whitish spotted with dusky  It is somewhat larger than the House Sparrow    XIII The NUN GROSBEAK  Loxia Collaria  Linn and Gmel  Le Gros Bec Nonette  Buff  The third of these little species is that of Fig No  Pl Enl  which we have called  the Nun  because it has a sort of black biggen on its head It is a new species also but we can say nothing more of it being unacquainted with its native climate We bought it from a dealer in birds who could give us no information on that subject  Specific character of the  Loxia Collaria    It is yellowish its breast and collar yellow its temples black    XIV The GRAY GROSBEAK  Loxia Grisea  Gmel  The fourth of these is new and as little known as the preceding It is Fig No  Pl Enl  called  the Virginia Grosbeak  But we shall term it  greywhite Grisalbin  because its neck and part of its head is white and all the rest of the body gray and as it differs from the others it merits an appropriated name  Specific character of the  Loxia Grisea    It is of a coerulean gray its neck and front white  It is four inches long    XV The QUADRICOLOR  The fifth of these little foreign Grosbeaks is the bird described by Albin under the name of  the Chinese Sparrow  and afterwards by Brisson  The female says this author differs from the male its thighs being of a lightchesnut and the colour of its tail not so vivid  under that of  the Java Grosbeak  and delineated Fig No  Pl Enl  by the same name We shall however term it  the Quadricolor    to distinguish it from all the rest and mark its principal colours for it is a beautiful bird and painted with four brilliant colours the head and neck being blue the back the wings and the end of the tail green there is a broad red bar like a girth under the belly and on the middle of the tail and lastly the rest of the breast and belly is lightbrown or hazel We are ignorant of its habits  XVI The JACOBINE and the DOMINO  Specific character  It is duskish its head its throat its tailquills black below it is waved with black and white    Loxia Malacca  Linn and Gmel  Coccothraustes Moluccensis  Briss  The Molucca Grosbeak  Lath  The sixth of these is the bird known to the curious by the name of  Jacobine  which we retain as applicable and discriminating It is represented  Pl Enl  Fig No and titled "The Java Grosbeak called the Jacobine" We conceive that Fig of that plate termed  the Molucca Crossbill  is of the same species and probably a female of the first We have seen these birds alive and fed them like Canaries Edwards describes and figures them by the name  of  Coury  It is called a  Cowrie  because its ordinary price is one of the small shells which pass in India for money but these are not current in China  Pl XL and from the meaning of this word he infers that they inhabit India and not China  It is the  Loxia Punctularia  of Linnaeus the  Coccothraustes Javensis Naevia  of Brisson Specific character  It is baycoloured its lowerbelly black spotted with white  It is four inches and a half long  We would have adopted this term had not that of  Jacobine  already come into use Fig No and Fig No are two birds which the virtuosi call  Dominos  and which they distinguish from the Jacobines They are smaller indeed but ought to be regarded as varieties of the same species The males are probably those which have the belly spotted and the females those which have it of an uniform whitegray The description of them occurs in Brisson's work but not a word is said of their natural habits  XVII The BAGLAFECHT  Loxia Philippina  var Gmel  This is an Abyssinian bird much resembling the  Toucnam Courvi  the only difference consisting in the shades or arrangement of the colours  The black spot which is on both sides of the head rises in the Baglafecht above the eyes the brown and yellow marbling of the upperpart of the body is less marked and the great coverts of the wings and their quills those of the tail are greenishbrown edged with yellow Its iris is yellowish and its wings when closed reach near the middle of the tail  The Baglafecht resembles the Toucnam Courvi also in the precautions which it takes to secure its eggs against rain and every sort of danger but the form of its nest is different The bird rolls it into a spiral nearly like the  Nautilus  and suspends it as does the Toucnam Courvi at the extremity of a small branch almost always above stagnant water the aperture constantly turned to the east the quarter opposite to the rain In this way the Baglafecht is not only sheltered from the wet but secured from the intrusions of different sorts of animals which seek to feed upon its eggs  XVIII The ABYSSINIAN GROSBEAK  Loxia Abyssinia  Gmel  I range among the Grosbeaks also the Abyssinian bird which resembles them in the characteristic  feature the thickness of its bill and likewise in the size of its body Its iris is red its bill the top and sides of its head its throat and its breast are black the rest of the underpart of the body the thighs and the upperpart of the body light yellow but which assume a brown tinge where the black of the anterior part meets it as if the two colours there melted into one the scapular feathers are blackish the coverts of the wings brown edged with gray the quills of the wings and of the tail are brown edged with yellow and the legs reddishgray  The most singular fact of the history of the Abyssinian Grosbeak is the construction of its nest and the sort of foresight which it discovers in common with the Toucnam Courvi and the Baglafecht The shape of the nest is nearly pyramidal and the bird is always careful to suspend it over the surface of water from the end of a small branch the entry is in the side and commonly faces the east the cavity is divided by a partition into two compartments the first is a kind of court into which the bird enters then creeping along the inclosure it descends into the second chamber where its eggs are laid By means of this complex construction the eggs are sheltered against the rain from whatever quarter the wind blows and we may observe that in Abyssinia the wet season lasts six months for it is a general remark that inconvenience and hardship quicken industry unless  they be so excessive as to extinguish it entirely In that country the bird was exposed not only to the penetrating rains but to the attacks of the monkeys the squirrels the serpents c It seems to have foreseen the dangers that threaten its family and to have artfully provided against them This species is new and we owe all our information on the subject to Mr Bruce  XIX The GUIFSO BATITO  The full name of this bird as it is written in Mr Bruce's drawings is  Guifso Batito Dimmo Won Jerck    Loxia Tridactyla  Gmel  The Threetoed Grosbeak  Lath  There is no European species to which this foreign bird is more related than the Grosbeak It shuns inhabited places and lives retired in the unfrequented forests It is languid in its amours and destitute of song and its only noise almost is made by the strokes of its bill in piercing the nuts to extract the kernelSo far the analogy applies But it differs from the Grosbeak by two remarkable properties st its bill is indented on the edges and dly its feet have only three toes two before and one  behind which is an uncommon disposition and occurs only in a few species These two discriminating features seem to me so important that the bird required an appropriated name and I have preserved that by which it is known in its natal region  The head the throat and the forepart of the neck are of a fine red which extends in a pretty narrow stripe under the body as far as the lower coverts of the tail All the rest of the underpart of the body the upperpart of the neck the back and the tail are black the uppercoverts of the wings brown edged with white the quills of the wings brown with a greenish border and the legs of a very dull red The wings when closed reach not beyond the middle of the tail  XX The SPOTTED GROSBEAK of the Cape of Good Hope  The bird represented by this name Fig No  Pl Enl  though different from the European Grosbeaks in its colours and the distribution of its spots appears so much akin to that species that it may be regarded as a variety produced by climate for which reason we have given it an appropriated name And Sonnerat  assures us positively that it is the same with that of the first article and he adds that these birds appear different because they change their colours every year  XXI The CRAVATED GRIVELIN  The bird delineated  Pl Enl  No Fig under the denomination of the Angola Grosbeak because we received it from that province of Africa appears to be related to the  Grivelin  and as all the neck and the underpart of the throat is covered and encircled by a sort of white cravat which extends even over the bill we have given it the name of  the Cravated Grivelin  We are ignorant of its habits  The HOUSE SPARROW  In Greek  Most translators and naturalists have made it to be  the fact is that this last name is generic and applicable to all the Sparrows in Italian  Passera  or  Passere Casaringo  in Spanish  Pardal  in German  HussSpar    HausSperling  in Swedish  Taelting    Grawparf    Le Moineau  Buff  Fringilla Domestica  Linn  Passer Domesticus  Gesner Aldrov Briss c  AS the species of Sparrow comprehends a multitude of individuals so its genus seems at first inspection to include a number of species One of our nomenclators reckons it to contain no less than sixtyseven different species and nine varieties making in all seventysix birds  Brisson  among which we are surprized to find many Linnets Finches Green Birds Canary Birds Bengal Birds Senegal Birds Mayo Birds Cardinals Buntings and many others not related to the Sparrows and which ought to be distinguished by separate names To introduce order into this confused group we shall first remove from the Sparrow with which we are well acquainted all the birds just mentioned which are also sufficiently known to enable us to decide that they do not belong to the same genus Following then our general plan we shall consider  N  o  FIG THE SPARROW FIG THE MOUNTAIN SPARROW  each of those which inhabit Europe a principal species and afterwards refer to them the analogous foreign kinds  We shall also separate from the Common or House Sparrow the  Field Sparrow  and the  Wood Sparrow  two birds more related than any of the preceding and also inhabitants of our climate to each we shall allot a distinct article This is surely the only way to avoid confusion  Our Sparrow is too well known to need a description It is represented Nos and  Pl Enl  fig No is the adult male after it has cast its feathers and fig No the young male before moulting The change of colour in the plumage and in the angles of the mandibles is general and uniform but the same species is subject to accidental varieties for some House Sparrows are white others variegated with brown and white and others almost entirely black  Black Sparrows occur in Lorraine but they are undoubtedly the common sort which as they lodge constantly in the glasshouses which are frequent along the foot of the mountains are smoked Dr Lottinger being in one of these glasshouses observed a flock of common Sparrows among which were several black ones An old person who dwelt on the spot told him that they sometimes appeared so much disguised that they could not be distinguished  and others yellow  Aldrovandus  The only difference between the females and the males is  that the former are smaller and their colours much fainter  Besides these first varieties some of which are general and others individual and which occur in all the European climates there are others in more distant regions which would prove that this species is spread from the north to the south in our continent from Sweden  Linnaeus  to Egypt  Prosper Alpinus  Senegal c  But in whatever country the Sparrow is settled it never is found in desert places or at a distance from the residence of man It likes neither woods nor vast plains It is more frequent in towns than in villages nor is it seen in the hamlets or farms that are buried in the depth of forests It follows society to live at their expence and indolence and voracity lead it to subsist on the provisions of others Our granaries our barns our courtyards our pigeonhouses and in short all places where grain is spilt are its favourite resort It is extremely destructive its plumage is entirely useless its flesh indifferent food its notes grating to the ear and its familiarity and petulance disgusting In some places Sparrows are proscribed  In many villages of Germany the peasants are obliged annually to produce a certain number of Sparrows' heads  FRISCH  and a price set on their heads  But what will render them eternally troublesome and vexatious is not only their excessive multiplication but their subtlety their cunning and their obstinacy to abide in places which suit them They are crafty and artful easily distinguish the snares laid for them and wear out the patience of those who try to catch them It is only in seasons of scarcity and when the snow covers the ground that the sport will succeed and little impression can be made on a species which breeds thrice ayear Their nest consists of hay lined with feathers If you destroy it they will in twentyfour hours build another if you plunder the eggs which are five or six  Olina says that they lay sometimes eight and never fewer than four  often more they will in the course of eight or ten days lay others if you drive them from the trees or the houses they will resort in greater numbers to your granaries Persons who have kept them in cages assure me that a single pair of Sparrows consume near twenty pounds of corn annually We may judge from their numbers what prodigious destruction they must make in our fields for though they feed their young with insects and eat many themselves they principally subsist on our best grain They follow the labourer in seedtime and the reaper in harvest They attend the threshers at the barns and the poulterer when he scatters grain to his fowls They visit the pigeonhouses and even  pierce the craw of the young pigeons to extract the food They eat bees and are thus disposed to destroy the only insects useful to man In short it is much to be wished that some method could be devised for destroying them I have been told that if sulphur were smoaked under the trees where in certain seasons they assemble and sleep at night they would be suffocated and drop dead I have tried the experiment without success though I took much pains and was interested in the issue for I could not get them driven from the neighbourhood of my voleries and I perceived that they not only disturbed the warbling of my birds but that by the continual repetition of their harsh cry  tui    tui  they sensibly spoiled the song of the Canaries Siskins Linnets c  I then placed on a wall covered with great Indian chesnuts in which the Sparrows assembled in great numbers in the evening pots filled with sulphur mixed with a little charcoal and rosin and these substances being set on fire caused a thick smoke which had no effect but to waken the birds As the volume ascended they removed to the tops of the trees and then retired to the neighbouring houses but not one dropped I observed only that they did not for three days visit the trees that were smoaked but afterwards returned to their former habit  As these birds are hardy they can be easily raised in cages and live several years especially  if the females be withheld from them  Some suppose that the male Sparrows cannot live longer than a year The proof is that none are observed to have a black beard in the spring but only sometime after as if none had survived the preceding season It is alleged that the females are more vivacious for they are caught along with young ones and are distinguished by the hardness of their bills  ARIST  Hist Anim  lib x  for it is said that their excessive venery abridges the period of their lives When they are taken young they are so docile as to obey the voice and catch somewhat of the song of those birds with which they are bred and being naturally familiar they become more so in the state of captivity But when at liberty they are rather solitary and hence perhaps the origin of their name  Perhaps the French word  Moineau  is derived from the Greek    solus  Since they never leave our climate and are always about our houses it is easy to perceive that they commonly fly single or in pairs There are however two seasons in the year when they assemble not to fly in flocks but to chirp together in autumn on the willows by the river sides and in spring on the firs and other evergreens They meet in the evening and in mild weather They spend the night on the trees but in winter they are found either alone or with their females in a hole of the wall or beneath the tiles of roofs And it is only in excessive frosts that five or six are found lying together probably to keep themselves warm  The males fight obstinately for the possession of their females and in the violence of their struggle they often fall to the ground Few birds are so ardent or so vigorous in their love They can embrace twenty times in succession with the same fire the same trepidation and the same expressions of rapture What is singular the female first shews a degree of impatience at a sport which must fatigue her less than the male but which may also yield her less pleasure since there are no preludes no caresses no adjustment Much petulance is shewn without tenderness and a flutter of action which betrays only a selfish appetite Compare the loves of the Pigeon with those of the Sparrow and you will perceive almost all the shades from the physical to the moral qualities  These birds nestle commonly under the tiles in the leadgutters in holes of the wall in pots that are erected for them and often about the sides of windows which have Venetian blinds A few however build their nests in trees I have received some of these which were found in large chesnuts and lofty willows They place them on the summit of these trees and construct them with the same materials  viz  hay on the outside and feathers within but what is singular they add a sort of cap above which covers the nest so as to prevent the water from penetrating and leave an opening for entering at under this cap When they lodge in holes or covered  places they judiciously dispense with this cap Instinct discovers here a sort of reasoning and at least implies a comparison of two small ideas Some House Sparrows more indolent though bolder than the rest do not give themselves the trouble of building but drive off the Martins and possess their nests Sometimes they fight the Pigeons and establish themselves in the holesThis little tribe exhibit therefore habits and instincts more varied and perfect than most other birds This results undoubtedly from their living in society They enjoy the benefits of the domestic state without surrendering any portion of their independence Hence that subtlety that circumspection and that accommodation of instinct to situations and circumstances  Specific character of the Common or House Sparrow  Fringilla Domestica  LINN  The quills of its wings and tail are brown its body gray and black with a single white stripe on its wings  It is near six inches long The eggs are ashwhite with thick dusky spots The male is distinguished by his black throat the female has a duller plumage They occur throughout Europe and in Africa and Asia  FOREIGN BIRDS RELATED TO THE HOUSE SPARROW  I  THE bird delineated fig No  Pl Enl  under the name of  Senegal Sparrow  We shall retain that denomination since it appears to be of the same species with the Common House Sparrow The only difference is that the bill the top of the head and the lowerparts of the body are reddish whereas in the European Sparrow the bill is brown the crown of the head and the lowerparts of the body gray But in every other respect they are the same and we may regard the difference of colour as resulting from the influence of climate  The bird of which the male and female are in fig and No  Pl Enl  appears to be only a variety of this  II  We may extend these remarks to the bird fig No  Pl Enl  termed the  Redbilled  Senegal Sparrow  which we shall consider especially since it belongs to the same climate with the preceding as a variety of it occasioned by difference of age or sex  III The BLACK SPARROW  There are other foreign birds however which though analogous to the House Sparrow must be regarded as of a different species Such is the American bird which the inhabitants of the French WestIndia islands call  the Black Father    Pere noir  It is represented fig No  Pl Enl  It would appear to be settled not only in these islands but on the continent of South America as at Mexico for it is mentioned by Fernandez under the Mexican name of  Yohualtototl  and described by Sir Hans Sloane as a native of Jamaica  The Black Sparrow marked with saffron dots  SLOANE  We suppose also that the two birds figured No are only varieties of this The only thing which weakens this conjecture is that they were found in climates very distant from each other from Macao the d from Java and the d from Cayenne I still conceive however that they are varieties of the Black Sparrow for the climates allotted to them by the importers are not to be considered  as certain and besides this species may occur equally in the hot countries in both continents  There are others also which may be regarded as varieties of this species The  Brazil Sparrow  of which fig No  Pl Enl  is the male and fig the female resembles the Black Sparrow so that we cannot hesitate to assign it the same place The resemblance is indeed the most perfect in the male for the female differs widely in its colours but this circumstance only apprizes us of the uncertainty of any classification founded on the plumage  Lastly There is another species which we should range with the Black Sparrow but for the great difference in the length of the tail This bird is delineated fig No  Pl Enl  under the name of the  Sparrow of the kingdom of Juida  We may consider it as a variety of the Black Sparrow distinguished by its long tail which consists of unequal quills If we have been rightly informed with respect to the climates it would appear that the Black Sparrow is found in the Antilles in Jamaica in Mexico in Cayenne in Brazil in the kingdom of Juida in Abyssinia in Java and as far as Macao that is in all the tropical countries both of the New and of the Old Continent  IV The DATE SPARROW  Mr Bruce after having attentively examined this bird found it to be the same with the Mascalouf of Abyssinia It is there called also  the Bird of the Cross  because it usually arrives the day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross which denotes the close of the rainy season Mr Bruce adds that at the sources of the Nile a bird appears after the rains which resembles much the Mascalouf except that it has a much shorter tail    Le Dattier  ou  Moineau de Datte  Buff  Fringilla Capsa  Gmel  The Capsa Finch  Lath  Dr Shaw speaks of this bird in his Travels under the name of  the Capsa Sparrow  and Mr Bruce has shewn me a miniature drawing of it from which I have made the following description  The Date Sparrow has a short bill thick at the base with some whiskers near the angles of its junction the uppermandible is black the lower yellowish and also the legs the nails black the anterior part of the head and throat white the rest of the head the neck the upper and even the lower surface of the body gray tinged with reddish but the tint is deepest on the breast  Shaw speaks of some reflexions which he perceived on its breast  and on the small uppercoverts of the wings the quills of the wings and of the tail are black the tail is slightly forked pretty  long and stretches twothirds beyond the extremity of the wings  This bird flies in flocks it is familiar and ventures to pick up grains at barndoors In that part of Barbary south of the kingdom of Tunis it is as common as the House Sparrow in France but it sings much better if what Shaw advances be a fact that its warble is superior to that of the Canaries and Nightingales  I should have been tempted from the fineness of its notes to range it with the Canaries but Mr Bruce who had often seen it and to whom I communicated my idea persisted in his opinion that it ought to be classed with Sparrows  It is a pity that it is too delicate to be carried out of its native country at least all the attempts that have hitherto been made of transporting it alive have proved unsuccessful  The TREE SPARROW  In German  Baum Sperling    Feld Spatz  or  Rohr Spatz    Le Friquet  Buff  Fringilla Montana  Linn and Gmel  Passer Montanus  Aldrov Ray and Briss  Passerinus  Gesner  The Mountain Sparrow  Will  THIS bird is undoubtedly of a different species from the House Sparrow Though they inhabit the same climate and the same tracts they never associate together and their habits are for the most part dissimilar The House Sparrow never leaves our dwellings but lodges and breeds in the walls and roofs The Tree Sparrow seldom visits us lives in the fields haunts the sides of the roads perches on shrubs and low plants and builds its nest in crevices and holes at a little height from the ground It is said to nestle also in the woods and in the hollows of trees but I have never seen them in the woods but transiently and they certainly prefer the open fields The House Sparrow flies heavily and always to short distances nor can it walk without hopping and making awkward movements The Tree Sparrow on the contrary whirls round more smartly and walks better This species is not so numerous as that  of the House Sparrow and it is exceedingly probable that they hatch only once ayear laying four or five eggs for about the end of summer they assemble in great bodies and remain together during the winter It is easy in that season to catch them on the bushes where they sit  After this bird has alighted it is in a continual flutter whirling jerking its tail upwards and downwards performing all these motions with tolerable grace and hence comes its French name  friquet frisky  Though not so bold as the House Sparrow it does not shun the presence of man it often follows travellers without shewing any signs of timidity It flies with a wheeling motion and always very low for it never perches on large trees and those who have called it the Chesnut Sparrow have confounded it with the Ring Sparrow which really lodges on lofty trees and on chesnuts  This species is subject to variety Many naturalists have reckoned the Mountain Sparrow  In German  Ringel Spatz    Ringel Sperling    Feld Sperling    Wald Sperling  in Polish  Wrobellesmf    Wrobelpolny    Mazurek  the Collared Sparrow  In German  Berg Sperling  in Polish  Wrobelgarny  in Greek    the Foolish Sparrow of the Italians as specifically different from it But the Foolish Sparrow is exactly the same  bird and the other sorts are only slight varieties  The Mountain Sparrow and Collared Sparrow are the same bird and differ from the Tree Sparrow only by the white or whitish collar on the top of the neck    What proves that the  Passera Mattugia  Fringilla Stulta  Gmel  Passer Stultus  Briss  The Foolish Sparrow  Will and Lath  Specific character  It is grayrufous spotted with sooty below yellowish its eyebrows and two stripes on its wings white a yellow spot on its throat its tail blackish and at the margin rufous  or Foolish Sparrow of the Italians is either the Tree Sparrow or a slight variety of it distinguished only by the distribution of its colours is that Olina who gives a figure and a description of it says that it receives the epithet of  Mattugia  because it can never rest a single moment in one place  Passer Sylvestris  Aldrov  the same circumstance to which I attribute the origin of its French name Would it not be very singular that this bird which is so common in France should not at all be found in Italy as our nomenclators have stated On the contrary it would seem that there are more varieties of this species in Italy than in France It inhabits therefore the temperate and warmer regions and not the cold climates for it is not found in Sweden But I am surprized that Salerne should say that this bird occurs not in Germany or England since the naturalists of these countries have given  figures and descriptions of it Frisch even asserts that the Tree Sparrow and the Canary bird can breed together and that the experiment has been made in Germany  The Tree Sparrow though more restless than the House Sparrow is not so petulant so familiar or so voracious It is more innocent and not so destructive to the crops It prefers fruits wild seeds particularly those of the thistle and also eats insects It avoids meeting the House Sparrow which is stronger and more mischievous It can be raised in a cage and fed like a Goldfinch it lives five or six years its song is very poor but quite different from the harsh cries of the House Sparrow Though more gentle than the House Sparrow it is remarked not to be so docile This is owing to its living more out of the society of man  Specific character of the Tree or Mountain Sparrow  Fringilla Montana    The quills of its wings and tail are brown its body gray and black with a double white stripe on its wings  Its egg is white blue with spots of a dull purple crowded at the thick end It is found in Yorkshire    FOREIGN BIRDS WHICH ARE RELATED TO THE TREE SPARROW  THE bird called the  Wild Sparrow Passereau Sauvage  in Provence appears to be merely a variety of the Tree Sparrow Its song says M Guys would seem never to end and is quite different from that of the House Sparrow He adds that this bird is very shy and conceals its head among the stones leaving its body uncovered and then fancies itself to be safe It subsists in the fields upon grain and some years it is very rare in Provence  But besides this and other varieties of the same sort that inhabit our climates and which we have mentioned after our nomenclators by the names of  Mountain Sparrow    Collared Sparrow    Foolish Sparrow  there are others found in foreign climates  I The GREEN SPARROW  Le Passe Vert  Buff  It is delineated fig No  Pl Enl  under the name of  Redheaded Cayenne Sparrow  We shall term it the  Green Sparrow  because its body is greenish But though in point of colour it differs as much as possible from our Tree Sparrow it is nearer related to this than to any other European bird  II The BLUE SPARROW  Le Passe Bleu  Buff  The same may be said of  the Blue Cayenne Sparrow  of fig No and as both these birds inhabit the same climate we can hardly decide whether they are distinct species or ought to be ranged in the same  III The FOUDI  This bird is called in Madagascar  Foudi Lehemené  Brisson mentioned it first under the name of the  Madagascar Cardinal  It is delineated fig No  Pl Enl  by the title of  Madagascar Sparrow  There are two birds the  Cardinal of the Cape of Good Hope  fig No and  the Sparrow  of the Cape of Good Hope  fig No which both appear to me to be varieties of the Tree Sparrow the former being the male and the latter the female for the only difference is that the underpart of the body is black but in all other respects they are alike and as we have reason to believe that they live in the same climate we may conclude they belong to the same species  IV The CRESTED TREE SPARROW  Le Friquet Huppé  Buff  Fringilla Cristata  Gmel  The Blackfaced Finch  Lath  It is like the Tree Sparrow in size and shape though much different in point of colour It is delineated fig and No  Pl Enl  under the names of the  Cayenne and Carolina Sparrow  Fig is probably the male and fig the female of the same species  Specific character of the  Fringilla Cristata    It is crested with dusky red the underside of its body and its rump scarlet  V The BEAUTIFUL MARKED SPARROW  Le Beau Marquet  Buff  It is delineated fig No  Pl Enl  under the appellation of  Sparrow of the Coast of Africa  It is certainly different from the Tree Sparrow and all those which we have mentioned and therefore required an appropriated name That which we have formed denotes that it is beautiful and finely spotted under the belly  N  o  FIG THE RING SPARROW FIG THE GRIVELIN  The RING SPARROW  In Italian  Passara Alpestre    Le Soulcie  Buff  Fringilla Petronia  Linn and Gmel  Passer Sylvestris  Briss  Passer Torquatus  Aldrov and Ray  THIS bird has as well as the Tree Sparrow been often confounded with the House Sparrow though it is of a different species It is larger than either its bill is stronger and red rather than black and it has no habit in common with the House Sparrow It dwells in the woods and hence the name that it has received from most of the naturalists  Passer Sylvestris  It nestles in hollow trees lays four or five eggs and hatches only once ayear As soon as the young are able to accompany the parents that is about the end of July they associate in flocks The Ring Sparrows are therefore collected six weeks earlier than the Tree Sparrows and form also more numerous bodies They remain united till the season of love when they separate with their females in pairs Though these birds are invariably stationary in our climate it is probable that they dread the severity of the arctic region for Linnaeus makes no mention of them in his enumeration of the natives of Sweden They  are birds of passage in Germany  This bird was hitherto scarcely if at all known in Germany but of late years it has become very common  Note communicated by  LOTTINGER  and do not arrive in flocks but only one by one  Frisch  and what seems to confirm our conjecture they are often found dead in the hollows of trees in hard winters They subsist not only on grain and seeds of all sorts but also on flies and other insects They are fond of the society of their equals and when they discover abundance of food they invite them to partake As they are almost always in numerous bodies they do vast injury to newlysowed fields They can scarcely be driven away or destroyed for they partake of the caution of the House Sparrow They avoid snares limetwigs and traps but they can be caught in great numbers with nooses  Specific character of the  Fringilla Petronia    It is gray its eyebrows white the upperpart of its throat yellow  Its egg is dusky with white dots    FOREIGN BIRDS THAT ARE RELATED TO THE RING SPARROW  I The LITTLE RING SPARROW  Le Soulciet  Buff  Fringilla Monticula  Gmel  Passer Canadensis  Briss  The Mountain Finch  Lath  THIS bird is so much like the Ring Sparrow that we might consider it as only a variety if it were possible that it could migrate into the New Continent It is delineated fig No under the name of the  Canada Sparrow  It is smaller than the Ring Sparrow as all the American animals are inferior to those of the same species in the Old World  Specific character  It is brown white below its top variegated with graybay its temples its neck and two stripes on its wings white    N  o  THE PAROARE  II The PAROARE  Is another beautiful bird a native of South America Marcgrave calls it by its Brazilian  name  tije guacu paroara  from which we have taken the term  Paroare  Brisson has named it the  Dominican Cardinal  because its head is red and its body black and white In the female the forepart of the head is not red but yelloworange sprinkled with reddish points  We shall also apply the name of  Crested Paroare  to a bird of the same continent which appears to be only a variety distinguished by a tuft or crest on its head This beautiful bird is figured No  Pl Enl  and there termed  the Crested Dominican Cardinal of Louisiana  III The CRESCENT  Le Croissant  Buff  This bird is delineated fig No  Pl Enl  and there named  the Sparrow of the Cape of Good Hope  which had been given to it by Brisson We shall term it the  Crescent  because in its species and climate it is different from the others In the distribution of its colours it is analogous to the Ring Sparrow and has a white crescent which extends from the eye below the neckThis character is alone sufficient to distinguish it  END OF THE THIRD VOLUME
