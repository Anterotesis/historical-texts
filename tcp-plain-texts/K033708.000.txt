suppliant People hear  Help help O Lord or else we dye  CHARMIS Chorus  Char  Well may ye mourn O miserable Race  Well may ye mourn The Angel of Destruction  Even now on Wing malignant hovers o'er us  And show'rs upon our Heads the Wrath of Heaven  A Man  Ye are the Cause ye Governors and Rulers  Of the dire Mischiefs that are fallen upon us  Why sought ye not a Peace with these  Assyrians  E'er they approach'd our City Now their Troops  Encompass us about have seiz'd our Springs  And thro' a Dearth of Water all must perish  AIR  A Wo  O Torment great too great to bear  Parch'd up with Thirst I burn I rage  Distraction Horror and Despair  Give me this Fury to asswage  One Drop from some yet moist'ned Bowl  To cool the Fever in my Soul  SCENE II  OZIAS CHARMIS Chorus  A Man  Throw wide our Gates let  Holofernes  enter  With all his Troops and spoil us we will serve him  It's better so to serve than to behold  Our Wives and Children die before our Faces  Ozias  Brethren take Courage let us yet endure  Five Days and if within that Space the Lord  Turn not his Mercy towards us we will do  According to the Words ye now have spoken  AIR  Be humble suff'ring trust in God  Who joys not with the chast'ning Rod  To shew his Power Divine  No he is Good as well as Great  And Men that will not patient wait  Rebel when they repine  SCENE III  JUDITH ABRA  Jud  Have then our Miseries at length subdued us  And must those Heathens lord it o'er the Race  Of abject  Israel  Abra  Within five Days  Bithulia  shall be plundered our young Men  Slain with the Sword our Virgins violated  And the small Remnant must groan out a Life  In Slavery and Exile  Jud  Know'st thou not  What Wonders the Almighty can perform  Oh weak of Faith should God stretch forth his Arm  Is it too late to save his sinking People  I feel my Spirit stirr'd with strange Emotions  Raise raise some potent Strain whilst I retireing  In holy Meditation seek the Lord  AIR  Abra  Wake my Harp to melting Measures  Pour thy softest sweetest Treasures  Such as lift the Thoughts on high  'Till the rapt Soul Earth forsaking  Heavenward it's Flight is taking  On the Wings of Harmony  SCENE IV  JUDITH ABRA  Jud  Where are the Ancients of the CityLead me  This instant lead me to them with some vast  Design my Soul is big Yet what am I  Most Gracious what am I that thou shouldst do  This Thing and by an Instrument so feeble  Blazon thy glorious Name among the Nations  AIR  Adventurous lo I spread the Sail  Steering where Patriot Virtue guides  That marks my Passage 'points the Gate  And Pilot at my Helm presides  With stedfast Heart I quit the Shore  Nor Man's Assistance deign to court  The Star of Mercy goes before  In Promise of a joyful Port  SCENE V  OZIAS CHARMIS JUDITH ABRA Chorus of  Israelites  Ozias  Brethren behold the Widow of  Menasses    Judith  for Wisdom and for Beauty fam'd  This way she comes attended by her Damsel  Daughter what wouldst thou  Jud  Hear me O ye Rulers  Ye have not rightly done to tempt the Lord  By swearing that unless within five Days  He turn'd to help us ye would yield the City  Charm  Th' rash Inhabitants compell'd us to it  But thou implore the Lord that he may send  Rain from the Clouds and we shall faint no more  Chorus of  Israelites  When  Israel  wept no Comfort nigh  Thou heardst O Lord thy People's Cry  Tender as Shepherd of his Flock  When thro' the Desart they were led  From Heav'n thy Bounty gave them Bread  And pour'd them Water from the Rock  Jud  Hear me I mean to do an Act shall go  Throughout all Generations I will go  Forth from the City to the  Assyrian  Camp  With this my Virgin and within the Time  Prescrib'd the Lord shall save ye by my Hand  But question not the Scope of my Design  For nought I will divulge 'till all be finish'd  AIR  Remember what  Jehovah  swore  To Abram and his Seed of yore  Above 'tis on Record  With this right Hand I plant thy Race  No Power shall root it from its Place  So spoke the living Lord  And Suns may melt and Stars decay  Both Heaven and Earth shall pass away  But not his sacred Word  SCENE VI  OZIAS CHARMIS  Char  She breaths prophetic Strains depart in Peace  And the Lord God go with thee Wonder not  My Brethren that upon this Woman's Strength  We rest our Hopes of Safety through the Tribes  The Fame of her Religion is gone forth  And know a single Champion so provided  Is better than a Host of the Prophane  AIR  Conquest is not to bestow  In the Spear or in the Bow  Nor does Victory belong  To the Valiant or the Strong  But the Pious and the Just  Those who in  Jehovah  trust  To their Foes the Sword may give  They shall triumph they shall live  SCENE VII  OZIAS CHARMIS Chorus of  Israelites  Ozias  Lo where fair  Judith  issuing from the Gate  With

fall a Prey  But all  Judea    Hol  Wonder of thy Sex what Language can express  My Admiration  What Words do Justice to thy Excellence  For Comeliness of Form and Strength of Mind  There is not such

lament my own  SCENE II  HOLOFERNES JUDITH ABRA Chorus of  Assyrians  Hol  Strait thro' the Camp let this Command be issued  That none presume t'approach the Hebrew Women  But with such due Respect and Reverence  As suits the Friends of the  Assyrian  King  An unmolested Passage let them find  And ample Liberty to observe their Laws  Their Customs and Religion  Chorus of  Assyrians  Live for

Rejoice Rejoice  Judea  falls  Yon stubborn City bows her Walls  Victors we come her Gates display  And Desolation marks our Way  While every Sword from Slaughter reeks  The Virgin cries the Matron shrieks  Thro' her pale Streets Groans Shouts resound  And all her Turrets flame around  SCENE III  JUDITH ABRA  Jud  Thus far the Lord hath led us by the Hand  Till in the Midst of these Idolaters  We are set down But know like Sparks of Fire  Lodg'd in a Heap of Stubble we shall soon  Blaze and consume them Only thou my Sister  Beware of their Deceptions Nor with Flattery  Let them intoxicate our Reason  Abra  Never  The Praise of the Abandon'd to the Ear  Of Virtue sounds but like the Serpent's Hiss  As timely Warning to avoid its Sting  Too well by thy Example am I taught  To scorn the glittering Gewgaws they esteem  AIR  Vain is Beauty gawdy Flow'r  Pageant of a Day an Hour  Born just to bloom and fade  Nor less weak less vain than it  Is the Pride of human Wit  The Shadow of a Shade  SCENE IV  JUDITH ABRA Chorus of  Assyrians  Jud  Soft break we off what wanton Troop comes yonder  This Way they bend their Steps Now speak your Errand  If from the Great the gracious  Holofernes    Ought in Command ye bear behold a Vassal  Submissive to the Pleasures of her Lord  A Man  Thus then our general greets the peerless  Judith    To Night he holds a Banquet and her Presence  Only is wanting to compleat its Splendor  Further he charg'd mebut I need not speak it  Charms have the  Hebrews  and the  Assyrians  Hearts  A Wo  Come beauteous Stranger give a Loose to Joy  Our General amidst the Noise of War  Has a Soul tun'd to all the softer Passions  Enough she smiles Consent return we back  With the glad Answer of our Embassy  AIR  Haste to the Gardens of Delight  Blest Scenes where plenteous Pleasures grow  Where Fruits luxuriant charm the Sight  And court the Hand from every Bough  No Churls are bid to Nature's Treat  The Goods the Gods provide

There  Holofernes  lay stupid with Wine  Then came the Spirit of the Lord upon me  And drawing from his Sheath his shining Faulchion  I smote him twice and strook away his Head  Which when my faithful  Abra  had received  We pass'd unquestioned 'till we reach'd  Bithulia    Ozias  Blessed art thou O  Judith  among Women  What thou hast wrought today for  Israel  Shall be remembered to thy Praise

Hand thine Enemy  Here take his Head and hang it on the Walls  Gird every Man his Sword upon his Thigh  And feign yourselves preparing all for Battle  The  Assyrians  will perceive ye are in motion
