stile  'Twas but a frolic task a youthful play  Whose best reward was thy approving smile  It scarcely claim'd th' offended Critic's rod  We love to imitate what we admire  The Persian thus adores the Solar God  And lights faint Emblem his terrestrial fire  No longer inexperienced I presume  On fancied worth beneath the quaint disguise  But strip the veil remove th▪ incumbent gloom  And modern numbers give to modern eyes  Yet still to thee I dedicate the song  Language may change our friendship cannot fade  To thee all Virtue's winning charms belong  Nor is my soul of fickle substance made  The LAND of the MUSES  MAY we unblamed in these fastidious times  Retreat to  Spenser  's allegoric rhimes  His venturous step thro' fairy bowers pursue  Till  Alma  's castled dome appears in view  There see advancing on th' embattled plain  Guyon  and  Arthur  of heroic strain  Their martial grace their valiant deeds admire  Unwearied arms and unextinguish'd fire  When the base Squadrons who besieged her rouud  They forced to quit the field and shun the sacred ground  Then view brave  Guyon  with intrepid heart  Against th' enchanted bower of bliss depart  While by his presence check'd the sensual croud  Led by  Malaeger  confident and proud  Again invest the walls See  Arthur  ride  Indignant forth and as Antaeus died  By Hercules of yore the Chief inclasp  Who breathed his last within his nervous grasp  Yet tho' renown's allenvied prize He won  Espy from many a gash the crimson current run  "There view the Grooms and Squires with tender speed  "Respectful take Him from his foaming steed  "And fairest  Alma  costly spice prepare  "And wine and balm t' administer with care  "Eager her lively gratitude t' express  "And aid her Champion in his deep distress  "Then of his armour gently disarray'd  "On richest Sopha cause him to be laid  "And while his wounds they gird with circling band  "Close by his side behold the Virgin stand"  Ah Fools who think that  Temperance  will refuse  Enjoyments sweet the soul's refreshing dews  To Humankind or frowningly survey  Their feet proceed in Pleasure's roseate way  See them recline beneath her myrtle bowers▪  Inhale the balmy air and pluck th' innocuous flowers  Liberal and candid all delights She loves  Which Taste desires and Elegance approves  Fosters each genuine bliss to reason dear  But hates impetuous passion's mad career  Now while  the Prince  nigh heal'd by  Alma  's skill  Felt health begin each languid vein to fill  Exhausted erst when in her cause he fought  And with his blood the wellearn'd triumph bought  As well She knew the body and the mind  In weal and woe essentially combin'd  United each to each with strictest ties  She bent her thought his mind to harmonize  So to his ear closeseated by his side  In accents duly couch'd her speech applied  At times of chivalry war's purest flame  And hardy Knights who scorning abject shame  Trampled on death to gain immortal fame  Then as the Powers of Virtue listening stood  Of conscious worth She spake and mental good  And peace and civic merit laurelcrown'd  While He was ravish'd by the soothing sound  With Her two  Nymphs  ministrant came prepared  And when She paused the grateful labour shared  For ever and anon would  PraiseDesire  Open her ruby lips attune her lyre  And sing her pensive notes the powerful strain  Charm'd the sensation of internal pain  Infused serenest stedfastness and brought  To justest temper each rebellious thought  It seem'd as if an Angel from above  Melodious glided on the wings of love  Such silver tones th' enamour'd gales prolong  Her flowing measures such and blandishment of song  And often Virgin  Bashfulness  assay'd  The melting lute and sweetest descants play'd  For She her instrument could aptly guide  Nor wanted in welldoing comely pride  The  Prince  's bosom secret pleasure fills  And every nerve the love of glory thrills  His spirit seizes her celestial meed  He meditates th' unutterable deed  Rapt and beyond expression moved He sighs  The living fire darts ardent from his eyes  And drench'd in bliss unknown to vulgar soul He lies  One evening as these  Four  excursive tread  Where that majestic stream is seen to spread  Whence  Guyon  launch'd the country far and wide  Profusely watering with exhaustless tide  Arthur  beholds the farther coast it's hills  Ascending steep it's vales meandring rills  Woods whose thick boughs a solemn shade diffuse  And lawns which now declining Phoebus views  Beaming the last remains of golden day  Then curious ask'd what region yonder lay  That is the  Land  replied th' ingenuous Fair  Apollo  's and the  Muses'  favourite care  On which their blessings they benignly shower  E'en to excess there in immortal bower  Close by the fount of Hippocrene divine  Th' unfading wreathe of harmony entwine  There all their choral extasies repeat  Far from the world there fix their happy seat  And scorn its vulgar herd and tasteless Great  There too is heartfelt  Joy  with aspect bright  And Pain is banish'd thence and Grief is put to flight  There too a thousand beauteous Forms reside  To which in habit or in shape allied  In other place the eye can never find  Beings invisible to common mind  Of purest nature and ethereal race  Girded with zones by every Sister Grace  For there the  Graces  shed their choicest rays  While  Liberty  with smiles before them plays  And clad in robes of white each spotless  Virtue  strays  May not rejoin'd the  Prince  a Stranger sue  Those scenes thy lively words describe to view  What bliss to travel thro that region fair  What bliss to mingle with the Natives rare  Nor speak I urged by boastful folly vain  Yet in my heart is no illiberal stain  Honour hath poured her influence on my mind  And cherish'd passions generous and refin'd  Say whom must I invoke that purer mould  To tread those Forms Ethereal to behold  No base Intruder no malicious Spy  Seeking their hidden mysteries to defery  Then  Alma  smiled and smiled th' attendant  Twain  O  Briton Prince  She said that blest domain  To me by young Apollo's self is given  Freely t'enjoy to me that earthly Heaven  He grants to range from Him the power is mine  All lawless wanderers from the sacred Nine  To keep by force  Riot  's wild crew to quell  And all the Sons of insolence repell  But ever modest merit to befriend  Direct his steps and my assistance lend  But darkness now protrudes her shadowy cone  The fields are trod by wakeful man alone  Take we our frugal meal and then to rest  The Beasts their couch the Birds have sought their nest  All but the Beast of prey with ruthless mind  Threatening sell slaughter to the helpless kind  And Philomel whose conscious measures flow  Feeding th' unsated luxury of woe  Now passionately full now soft and dying low  Tomorrow when the Eastern clouds display  Their lucid pomp and crimson banners gay  At my request a bark shall waft us o'er  Th' expanded stream to yon sequester'd shore  The prospects which await us there to paint  Art cannot reach all language would be faint  In courtly phrase the  Prince  his thanks exprest  For every polisht grace adorn'd his breast  His eyelids light and transient slumbers close  And in the morn with Heaven's first beam He rose  His gentle  Guide  not unprepared He found  For when the Lark soar'd upward from the ground  With joy She heard his sweetlywarbled strain  And brake the silken bands of sleep in twain  Then o'er the humid lawns they took their way  The dewdrops glittering with the orient ray  And to the River's verdant margin sped  Where lay th' expecting bark with sail unspread  The Pilot at the helm of aspect mild  And bland yet piercing eye  GoodCulture  stiled  The  Knight  and  Lady  He with transport warm  Received then push'd far off with nervous arm  Unfurl▪d his sail which gales propitious swell'd  And o'er the waves his easy course impell'd  The sparkling waves like lucid chrystal gleam  Or like unclouded Titan's radiant beam  For not the smallest stain or spot they know  Tho deep the tide the sands were seen below  When they approach'd that shore's extremest bound  With Spring's eternal cestus girt around  Ambrosial airs mildbreath'd their senses greet  Diffusing odours exquisitely sweet  For  Zephyr  there his softest plumes indued  And chid each devious blast of pinions rude  While  Flora  hung with living gems the bowers  And deck'd the turf with neverfading flowers  Blossoms and flowers of every various hue  Which once in Eden's happy garden grew  Now at the Coast arrived they land with speed  And now along the lilied banks proceed  Viewing in silence with attentive eye  The scenes romantic which before them lye  The  Prince  at every turn to wonder yields  At every turn new beauties crown the fields  Upon his cheeks a warmer glow is spread  His bosom throbs with awe and pleasing dread  Such prospect frailer mortals scarce could bear  He gazed and wish'd to gaze forever there  His mild  Conductress  bade him now behold  Where crossing o'er the velvetshaded mould  Two of the gentle Habitants advance  He sees and quits his visionary trance  Their eyes the glittering beams of pleasure dart  Their smooth brows speak their gayety of heart  Their virid garlands wanton'd in the wind  Their nimble feet moved on as chance inclined  And treading the soft turf no pressure left behind  The one was  Youthful Prime  of comely grace  The rising down began to shade his face  Unchanged by years The other was his Bride  Hygeia  She of firm affection tried  From whom a Son paced smiling by his side  Her presence every thought of time exiled  So well each hour her converse sweet beguiled  That tender Imp whose smiles proclaim'd his joy  He named  Content  to whom tho yet a Boy  Is given exclusive power and wondrous might  For ease of mind and spirits dancing light  All those inspire on whom He casts his sight  The blooming Dame sustain'd an Infant Child  Simplicity  by both his Parents stiled  Wellfavour'd and of lovely hue to see  Stretching his little arms and telling his tale free  To whom with bland demeanor  Alma  said  Where widely your enchanted feet have stray'd  Among the mazes of this flowery green  Tell me ye gentle Pair if ye have seen  Where  Fancy  now resides for like the wind  I know the sudden shiftings of her mind  No certain spot She loves but varies soon  Now the deep shade allures and now the blaze of noon  To Her with swiftwing'd accents  Youth  replied  The Nymph ye seek fair Dame I lately spied  In yonder glen which craggy rocks surround  Whence bursts a torrent forth with roaring sound  Then bending decent with respectful eye  He and his loved Copartner hasted by  But  Alma  with the  Prince  right onward fared  Who ask'd her why to  Fancy  She repair'd  Without her aid said She I want the power  To guide thee as behoves a single hour  Besides her skill hath raised a Building high  Which yonder view aspiring to the sky  From whence is seen distinctly rock and plain  And dell and grot and stream and woodland reign  Each goodly object all the living race  Which breathe and move and these dominions grace  To which if thee O  Prince  She will convey  What else would take up many a tedious day  And many a night in vigils to behold  In portion small of time She can unfold  Nor should we haply else succeed at last  But after much sojourn and labour vast  Some thorny glade our tangled feet might chain  Some wilderness mislead or sandy plain  Or we might sink beneath some foaming bourn  Or to the place we left unsped return  Now where they sought the  Maid Divine  they scann'd  Upon a craggy cliff She took her stand  Forming a gloomy shade above her head  A lofty pine it's ample branches spread  Downward on either side with rapid force  From rock to rock a strong stream bent it's course  Precipitate the dashing currents flow  And mingle in one boiling gulph below  She stood enraptured o'er the whirling bay  And bathed her forehead in the floating spray  Conscious of stranger feet her eyes She rear'd  Which as th' effulgent sunbeam bright appear'd  And quicker than the quivering lightning glanced  Then t'ward them strait with airy feet advanced  In prodigal abundance uncontroul'd  Wide waved her burnisht locks of tendrill'd gold▪  Brede or incircling band they never knew  When most dishevell'd comeliest to the view  In thin habiliment her limbs were drest  A curious robe depended from her vest  Of fleecy clouds and gossimer intwined  Which on the bosom of the dalliant wind  It's folds sustaining sported far behind  Adorn'd with tints of every various die  Which in Heaven's glorious bow attract the eye  And every blended hue which e'er was traced  In complicated beauty there was placed  Oft in that vale retired She sate alone  Where  Nature  wildly stray'd to  Art  unknown  But circumscribed by no determined bound  Free and at large She ranged Creation round  Or thro the brazen gyre would urge her way  With cheek unblanch'd and heart without dismay  The din of  Chaos  and  Confusion  hear  Nor all the bickering elements would fear  There if She wills the cold abyss She warms  New worlds and peopled with unnumber'd swarms  She bids arise her palace strait they mould  She mounts her throne extends her scepter'd gold  While thronging round her ready subjects stand  Or stoop submiss and wait her high command  Then in a moment such her varying soul  On ruin bent annihilates the whole  Assists confusion multiplies the jar  Heightens the tumult and augments the war  For She alone most wondrous to relate  Except  Heaven's Sire  is unrestrain'd by  Fate  Oft to th' empyreal Dome with boldest gaze  Striving to pierce th' impenetrable blaze  She speeds her course where mid the depth profound  Of strong refulgent glory floating round  Sits the mysterious  Godhead  in his reign  Of trinal unity But all in vain  She strives to pass that inexpressive light  Heaven  's  Sire  alone escapes her thrillant sight  Yet She could bring so potent was her sway  Cherubs  and  Seraphs  from the realms of day  While gently hovering round  Angelic Quires  Tuned at her will their goldenstringed lyres  Or spite of  Pluto  's horrid flames would dare  To cleave the earth and rouse to upper air  The  Furies  with their whips of iron dread  The snakes loud hissing on each ghastly head  With Them would  Hecate  reluctant stand  Her cypress wreathe display and wield her sparkling brand  Then would arise on pitchy pinions borne  Sternlook'd  Revenge Hate  by wild frenzy torn  And each tremendous  Pest  which shuns the light  And every  Child  abhorr'd of ugly  Night  Lust  fierce and restless  Jealousy  worn blind  Murther  whose features shock the generous mind  And pining  Care  which in thick gloomy clouds  The halfslain wretch while yet alive inshrouds  And  Woe  by inches destined to consume  Hanging with face all pale o'er her dead Lover's tomb  And She would call th' unbodied  Ghosts  around  Uttering their dolorous wail with shrieking sound  And  Witchcraft  mumbling forth her rites might make  The stoutest tremble and the firmest quake  And  Conscious Fear  who steals with secret stride  Keeping close watch th' Assassin's bed beside  And when  Sleep  long invoked begins to seal  His wearied lids unfold the poppied veil  And his tormenting thoughts awhile controul  Rings her alarum wild and rends his guilty soul  Yet were no frowns or sternness in her face  But amiable and clad with native grace  Her blushing cheeks confess'd a modest die  Blending with softness virgin majesty  Love ever view'd her in respect array'd  Enchanting smiles o'er all her features play'd  Her azure veins in winding mazes flow'd  The snow above with living lustre glow'd  So deckt with radiance deckt with beauty's beams  The Eldest Daughter of the  Morn  She seems  While cordial joy her winning looks express'd  To  Alma  thus her speech She first address'd  Welcome fair Maid to this secluded place  Then seal'd the welcome with a warm embrace  And hail to thee  her Knight  Command the Powers  Who here inherit thee the lightplumed  Hours  Transported view for thee each  Grace  will twine  The dance the  Virtues  chaunt their airs divine  For thee  Apollo  's self would tune the lay  And I with ready step thy will obey  O Passing Fair to her the  Virgin  said  This Gentle  Knight  He bent his comely head  No Son of riot or obstrusive pride  To these blithe regions follows me his guide  Let me his earnest suit to thee commend  My strong Deliverer He and stedfast Friend  Oh bear him to thy lofty tower with speed  Or with him thro these mazy haunts proceed  That He each wondrous Inmate may descry  And satiate with delight his knowledgegathering eye  She answer'd not but lock'd with aspect sweet  Her hand in their's prepared for voyage fleet  Then swift as light or if with swifter force  Aught moves upbore them in her airy course  Till on th' aspiring edifice they stood  Whence they survey'd that Isle it's circling flood  The girding Heavens outstretch'd in vast array  And Earth and Ocean wide which far beneath them lay  Rare was the Building glorious to behold  It's parts nor steel nor brass nor lead nor gold  Nor marble form'd nor were they knit with lime  With  Roman  cement or  Asphaltic  slime  One piece of lucent glass composed the mound  In shortest space She raised it from the ground  Tho seeming thin and frail it braved the rage  Of wasting time and gain'd new strength from age  With portraits numberless the walls were lined  Landscapes and Histories by her design'd  For when that tower She left and ranging wide  New shapes and forms before unseen descry'd  Those from her memory's faithful chart the Maid  Before an Artist's skilful sight display'd  Who every stroke with eager rapture scann'd  And all defined with swiftlymoving hand  And ornamented all with colours rare  Description  was her name a Virgin debonair  Soft was her pencil delicately light  Yet were it's sketches strong and glowing bright  For from the clouds their checquer'd spots She drew  And it's pure essence from the morning dew  Her blush when first  Aurora  rose from sleep  She took it's azure from th' unruffled deep  The smiles of  Venus Cynthia  's silver ray  Flora  's enamell'd robe the  Lord of Day  Pouring his splendours in refulgent tide  And all Dame  Nature  's works her tints supplied  Each colour mingling just a reverend  Eld  Or seperating each the palette held  The wrinkles well became his antient face  Low stream'd his hoary beard with decent grace  His piercing eye his perfect senses told  Active his soul tho in experience old  Judgement  the Sage was stiled his looks with awe  She view'd his slightest hint she deem'd a law  Full many a time her youthful hand He stay'd  When wanton or with careless touch it stray'd  The  Briton Prince  with pleasure view'd the Pair  Her curious works and his attentive care  Till  Fancy  beckon'd Him to whom resign'd  He left th' enchanting imagery behind  And now by  Her  and  Alma  seated nigh  Where rose the glittering battlements on high  She waved her hand then bade them look around  And mark the charms of that celestial ground  Wide spread the magic scene their eyes before  The laughing meads with flowers were sprinkled o'er  There was the crocus there the harebell seen  The lily fair the rose unrivall'd Queen  The pink the tulip with embroider'd vest  The violet blue the daisy meekly drest  The cowslip drooping down his languid head  All which the sweetest liveliest odours bred  And all which  Nature  's vivid stains imbrue  There scorning  Art  uncultivated grew  And mid the valleys lucid rivers stray  Which rolling on in wild meanders play  With dimpled surface now they calmly glide  The listening Swain hears not the gentle tide  Now broke by mossy stones sweet music make  And the thrall'd sense in willing bondage take  Now sudden bounding o'er some rocky wall  From rift to rift the dashing currents fall  On hills far off the forests shed their gloom  Here tufted groves with verdure ever bloom  Around whose trunks the honeysuckle winds  And scented jessamine it's branches binds  And purple grapes between thickclustering hung  And thousand thousand feather'd Inmates sung  Conceal'd from every eye the Minstrels raised  Their choral notes and Harmony was pleased  While every leaf more gladly seem'd to move  And every bough consenting waved above  As o'er the lawns their eyes delighted pass  Fair flocks they see which cropp'd the tender grass  Or slept reclined beside each pastoral stream  Or wanton sported in the sunny beam  And where or rock appeared or rising hill  The goats of antic gambols took their fill  And jocund  Keepers  with their crooks in hand  Guarded them both with dogs a faithful band  Or in the plain or hid beneath the shade  On pipes of reed their amorous descants play'd  Soon they beheld the horned  Pan  draw near  A merry note he tuned the heart to cheer  Pleasant but rude and rustic was the strain  Him follow'd dancing trim in frolic vein  A crowd of  Fauns  and  Satyrs  who with fleet  And active motions sped their cloven feet  With them the looserobed  Dryads  aptly join'd  Their Partners gay the mazy round entwined  With nimble step they beat the hollow ground  Their hair with oaken wreathes and ivy crown'd  A pleasing sight succeededLo the  God  Of Love  a gentle lamb the Power bestrod  Not He for whom  Spite  tempers savage darts  Teaching those cursed and malignant arts  His and his cruel  Mother  's lasting shame  While just reproach indignifies his name  Arts by which numerous wretches first his slaves  Have sunk in torture to untimely graves  And numerous wretches who alive remain  Dwell with despair and everracking pain  This  winged Boy  a milder bosom proved  Mild as the beast on which He onward moved  Nor could He see th' unhappy drop a tear  But He sustain'd of grief an eqnal share  He was not blind and from his piercing sight  Fled  base Desire  who shrunk beneath his might  Deceit  and  Calumny  his frown dismay'd  And by him walked  Sincerity  the Maid  A chrystal vase she held before her breast  In which her secret thoughts were all exprest  Each inward sentiment reflecting true  Clad without varnish in their native hue  With this she oft can  Villainy  disgrace  And make him stooping hide his odious face  Guarded by this no lurking ill she fears  And e'en assail'd a smiling aspect wears  As if defended strong by magic charms  Or firmly girded in Vulcanian arms  Close on the left Fair  Innocence  sustain'd  A rosy brede with which that Lamb she rein'd  And guided him along the flowery way  Or check'd him if his Rider will'd to stay  Her to behold on balmy wings upborne  Angels would oft this lower world adorn  Bathing in mortal air their limbs divine  Around her such attractive graces shine  Her other hand a bloated serpent rear'd  Which lick'd her face for she no venom fear'd  And now a Nymph tript o'er the pathless green  Blithe was her look unequal was her mien  None could her lineaments exactly spy  The colour of her garment mock'd the eye  For both each moment chang'd inconstant wild  That fickle Female  Novelty  was stiled  Of  Admiration  She the heart possest  Her frequent change inflamed his youthful breast  With eager look he mark'd her giddy pace  And every shifting feature of her face  Twisting a silken cord with all his might  And stretching each unyielding fibre tight  Next came a Swain and walking by his side  One more than kin tho not in blood allied  The first was  Friendship  while the other bore  The name of  SansSelflove  in human lore  Honour's pure beams illumed his faithful soul  In true affection stedfast as the pole  For he the former to secure from pain  Would naked rush on spears or plunge into the main  And now advanced the Wight they first survey'd  And with his Spouse that Boy in smiles array'd  While heightening all the lustre of her charms  The little Prattler graced her matron arms  Behind with downcast eye and motion flow  Trod virgin  Chastity  a lump of snow  In her cold hands which tho the tepid west  Around her breathed no soil or stain confest  Unthaw'd and ever spotless as her breast  Long since her modest vows and plighted truth  Fidelity  obtain'd a comely youth  Her face was his fixt vision's only sphere  But such his looks as raised no blushes there  This hand the flower in living gold displays  Which to the sun still turns it's constant rays  That a Cameleon in a diamond chain  Whose magic links his varying hues restrain  And many more from their exalted seat  The  Prince  and  Alma  saw a Band replete  With all that charms the heart or feeds desire  Stirs the soft wish or warm enthusiast fire  Uncinctured there the Sister  Graces  bright  There  Liberty  unveil'd her peerless light  Benevolence  and  Gratitude  conjoin'd  Beauty  alllovely both in shape and mind  There heartfelt  Ease  and  Leisure  onward past  And happy  Indolence  and  Peace  the last  Then  Fancy  waved again her potent arm  Th' inverted prospect own'd the sudden charm  Black was the sky the blustring wind blew rude  To the gay troop succeeded Solitude  Instead of flowery lawns a doleful glade  Which seem'd for Grief's afflicted offspring made  T'ward which no visionary joy could steal  Alas so soon all human glories fail  Forth came an hundred  Nymphs  with solemn mien  And flaming torches then as seem'd a  Queen  By the pure crown of gold which deck'd her head  Her awful front and her majestic tread  Her crimson vestment flow'd in stately pride  Like Scythian  Tomyris  when in slaughter died  She bade the Persian  Cyrus  thirst no more  Or bold  Bonduca  drench'd in Roman gore  Her left hand held a bowl with poison fill'd  Which working quick dispatch the victim kill'd  Her right a dreadful dagger which to those  Who tired of life their own relentless foes  Became she gave or if they ask'd the bowl  She bade them drink and satisfy their soul  Impurpled buskins on her legs she wore  A golden clasp connected them before  Behind her was a Wretch with garments rent  He moved as if with weakness all forespent  Hollow his cheeks and pale his dreary face  His eyes still gleaming with a languid grace  Misfortune  He  Adversity  around  His passive limbs a brazen chain had bound  Tho breathless faint o'erpower'd and well nigh slain  She spared him not but dragg'd him on amain  And ever and anon her arm on high  She lifted scouling grim with threatening eye  And oft his vesture would with fury tear  And scourge him till each vital part lay bare  No evil word tho hopeless of relief  But sighs profound declared his mighty grief  She heeded not his virtues or his moan  Her heart long since had been transform'd to stone  With aspect sweet and bland a lovely Dame  The fairest and the best behind him came  No rarer mixture of Creation's mould  No purer human eyesight could behold  His sufferings when she view'd his dire unrest  O God what anguish wrung her tender breast  What would she not relinquish to set free  From his sad state the Man of misery  To rescue him she almost wish'd to die  Such was the feeling soul of  Sympathy  The tears which sprinkled her celestial cheek  With added beauty graced each feature meek  As for that Wretch beset with cruel pain  Her eyes let fall the copious drops in vain  And blushing  Pudency  there sat inshrined  With silent voice interpreting the mind  Softmantling on the polisht surface play'd  And the moist pearls in orient beams array'd  So in her Eastern temple glowing bright  Thro a thin cloud  Aurora  darts her light  So a sweet rosy bud attracts the view  Beneath it's lucid veil of ambient dew  Two  Cherubs  hover'd mild her steps before  One in his hand a golden censor bore  Intent each precious tear of her's to save  Which fill'd he straitway to the other gave  Who to the starry mansions of the sky  Speeding his purple pinions soar'd on high  Where  Jove  with might superior reign'd alone  Except that  Mercy  stood beside his throne  The sacred offering he received with love  And shook with gracious sign his nectared locks above  Next came  Remorse  his eyes with looks profound  In ghastly silence glared upon the ground  But soon retorted with an eager view  As if to pierce his inmost bosom thro  There tenting to the quick with direst pain  Keen anguish throbb'd thro every panting vein  His arms convulsed sad object of despair  He tost alost or wildly beat the air  Ah Consciencesmitten in thy secret heart  Deep is the sting and fixt th' eternal smart  Now  Indignation  breathing vengeful ire  His sparkling glances darted living fire  Deep blush'd his cheeks with glowing crimson red  His manly brow the sternest frowns o'erspread  A glittering falchion beam'd above his head  Yet taught by  Reason  his emotions flow  His ire she prompts and gives his cheeks to glow  Wielding his blade a monster he pursued  Snaky and foul with venom all imbued  Guilt  who by terror wing'd ne'er ceased to fly  Nor tho far off dared turn her craven eye  Next  Horror  nought his ravin could controul  With harrows dire 'twas his to rend the soul  To tear each finer nerve with fell dismay  To rule with strength untamed and fiercest sway  Then  Hopeless Love  a shaft had pierced her breast  Her tongue to none the rankling wound confest  Beneath her robe she hid the smart severe  And pined unwitnest like the stricken Deer  Such numbers own'd that  Queen  's majestic reign  The Muse can scarce describe th' attendant train  In the dark glade they dwelt their native place  Till now call'd forth her sovereign state to grace  Suspicion  green and sickly was his hue  Excess of Grief  whose eyes no moisture knew  Revenge  who both his hands insteep'd in blood  Envy  pernicious foe to all that's good  Dissimulation  weeping to beguile  Like the scaled Reptile on the Banks of Nile  Madness  wild raving like the stormy wave  And  Melancholy  silent as the Grave  There too was  Brave Disdain of worthless deed  And  Conscious Pride  from all dishonour freed  And  Stoic Rigour  which reproach defied  And  Bounteous Kindness  to the Gods allied  And  Seemly Zeal  by  True Religion  drest  And  Justice  wellspring pure of public rest  And  Emulation  scorning second place  And  Wedded Love  whom wreathes unfading grace  And  Filial Piety  to whom is given  A lengthen'd term of years by favouring Heaven  All that from lethargy could rouse the soul  All that with potent spell could vice controul  Was there for  Virtue  ranged the bands unseen  Her Vassals they and e'en their haughty  Queen  From her derived and bound her laws t' obey  To whose support alone she owes her sway  By her she from confusion order draws  And rules the diverse  Croud  with strictest laws  Now for so  Fancy  bade arose a blast  And the dark gloom which erst had overcast  The sun dispell'd and with it all the Crew  Like the swift rack or misty vapour flew  His cheering rays more bright illumed the skies  And soon a public road before them lyes  Which t'ward a neighbouring City seem'd to lead  Where many a jovial troop they now survey'd  Who rode or laughing walk'd or sung or play'd  By the frequented path an  Archer  stood  Black was his lowering brow in angry mood  Two beauteous  Nymphs  within a certain gyre  Held him softsoothing and restrain'd his fire  Satire  whom  Candour  meek and  Truth  attend  They taught him when his threatening bow to bend  At their command the twanging string he drew  And with sure aim the barbed arrow flew  Those whom with deep and rigorous wound he sped  By  Vice  an antient Beldam had been bred  Some in disguises quaint a lurking Pest  Others with open force that road t' infest  And unsuspecting Travellers molest  But now with limping pace they trod awry  Pursued with flouts by grinning  Infamy  And hated kept at distance from the throng  Nor join'd in frolic dance or jocund song  But ever when his two Companions cast  Their eyes aside a shaft he snatch'd in haste  And smiling cruel with malicious face  Struck some of sober mien and goodly grace  The  Virgins  when they saw this evil deed  To their assistance ran with earnest speed  And pour'd in oil and balm with healing hand  But punish'd him with bitter reprimand  Not far removed a  Female  they survey'd  Her easy limbs in flowing robes array'd  Loose socks adorn'd her feet of diverse hue  A vizard hid her features from the view  An ugly  Hag  who waved a brand of flame  Follow'd her steps attending  Secret Shame  While  Ridicule  a Dwarf still moved before  And as he moved a burnisht mirrour bore  Led on by  Vanity  and  Folly  gay  The desultory Croud who past that way  Curious t' observe what images were there  With idle mirth and wantonness drew near  When in the mirrour bright themselves they spied  But so deform'd the likeness they denied  Till that uncomely  Dame  forsook her stand  Full in their cheeks she dash'd her fiery brand  The strong similitude at once confest  They fled disgrace alarm'd each conscious breast  But oh what tongue what language shall I find  What energy what amplitude of mind  The scenes which now superbly rose to paint  My numbers fail my Muse is all too faint  When she the  Prince  and  Alma  fair to bless  Liberal and kind and bounteous to excess  Unfolded to their sight the rich domains  Where in full pomp th' exalted  Epic  reigns  As if a man by more than human power  Should in his sleep be snatch'd at midnight hour  And o'er the sounding billows swift upborne  Behold with wild amaze at break of morn  A Country strange before with rapid force  The Amazonian stream's unrivall'd course  Beyond an open realm which upward tends  And gradual with majestic swell ascends  By the vast towering Cordilleras bound  And on the other side th' Atlantic waste profound  So stood the  Briton Prince  in wonder lost  For now down timeworn vallies rough embost  Strong torrents rolling fierce his vision crost  Now without shore an ocean huge and deep  On which the lingering breezes seem'd to sleep  But soon dire war conflicting tempests wage  And it's chased bosom feels the whirlwinds rage  With foaming wrath the watery mountains rise  And the red lightning fires the blazing skies  Now on the Champion or mid shady bowers  Proud castles he beheld and stately towers  And clad in sunlike armour many a  Knight  With  Ladies  by their sides of beauty bright  To whom they told fair tales of love's delight  Or in their cause with pointed lance oppose  Portentous Monsters or mishapen Foes  Or in round lists obey the trumpet's blast  And at their feet each meed of victory cast  Now heard he clarions numberless around  His heart enkindled own'd the martial sound  And now the plain two banner'd armies fill  They march they shout they join they fight they kill  Undaunted Heroes lift the spear and shield  Pierce the deep ranks and thin the crouded field  From steeds and men forth streams a mingled flood  The earth is crimson'd with the smoaking blood  Then where the distant mountains he espied  Moving from rock to rock with giant stride  A Form appear'd his stature reach'd the pole  He grasp'd at Heaven  Sublimity of Soul  These past away and now of golden light  A cloud He view'd which floated dazzling bright  Upon a forked hill his eyes in vain  Strove it's collected radiance to sustain  And from behind such music flow'd He thought  That airs divine from Heaven above were brought  And whelm'd with pleasure scarcely breath'd or moved  Nor was it strange that He such rapture proved  When  Jove  himself would often stoop his ear  From high  Olympus  top these symphonies to hear  Thro the thin edges of the floating light  Part of a seeming temple struck his sight  Of gorgeous frame yet tho he strain'd his eye  It fail'd the building wholly to descry  Whene'er the central lustre was assay'd  Each glance recoil'd confounded and dismay'd  With bold attempt repeatedly he gazed  At every look more strong the radiance blazed  And now said She O  Prince  whate'er these plains  Can boast whate'er th' extent of my domains  All that my will can grant or Thou behold  Have briefly been display'd those rays of gold  Thy fair Conductress knows the laws of fate  Will not allow thee yet to penetrate  Unless when born Thou hadst been sprinkled o'er  With dews Castalian and on Pindus' shore  Been lapt in myrtle and in laurel green  And thrice three times been dipt in Hippocrene  There on his throne  Apollo  I survey  And there the  Muses  tune their deathless lay  Yet e'en their mansions shalt Thou view in time  But first must toil in many a various clime  And combat with thy Country's deadly Foes  And crush the  Saxons  with redoubled blows  Then shall Themselves thy partial Guides become  By whom conducted to yon lofty dome  Conspicuous Thou in  Glory  's  fane  shalt stand  And thy renown be read in every land  This saying She a private door unbound  Which led a winding passage to the ground  For tho 'twere difficult the tower t' ascend  Spontaneous and with ease they downward tend  When at it's feet arrived with grateful breast  The  Prince  and  Alma  their due thanks exprest  Instant She mounted like an arrowy flame  They backward trod the path by which they came  ODE  Occasioned by the CORONATION  I  SLEEP'ST thou fair maid  Aeolian Virgin sleep'st thou in the cave  Of drowsy silence all array'd  In indolence supine  Doth listless Morpheus wave  His torpidstriking wand thy brows around  Damping thy faculties divine  Arise fair maid arise  Shake off the tardiness of dull delay  Quick bid the sacred lyre resound  And tune th' harmonious lay  Brunswick demands the verse prepare  Thine eagleplumes and light as air  Sail through the azurevaulted skies  I  But first remove  Far from thy hallow'd presence the base train  Of sawning Flattery she to prove  Her love falls bestial down  Licking the dust disdain  So lowly to debase thine honest head  And soil thy verdant laurel crown  Back to thy shades retire  Immerge in solitude thy form august  Thy shining locks with darkness braid  Still rest in silence if the lust  Of fame entice thy voice to sing  The meanest of mankind a King  Whom vice and tyranny inspire  I  The worthless great to praise  Befits the hireling's prostituted pen  Who sells for sordid gold his venal lays  Though oft along the winding Seine  Though oft in days of elder date  On the green margin of the Tuscan stream  Dazzled by pomp's external state  Th' ignoble bard has strung the glozing lyre  Of specious falsehood yet the British Muse  Freeborn should spurn th' illusive theme  And fraught with conscious dignity refuse  On Folly's sons to waste her sacred fire  Or soothing regal grandeur weave  For undeserving Pride her everblooming wreathe  II  Such caution here  Is vain those numbers fabulously bright  Are harsh nor charm a Brunswick's ear  Where Truth shall point the way  T'ward that unclouded height  Expand thy purer wings and onward fly  Directed by her steady ray  Should meager Envy scowl  With baleful front and grimlythreatening lance  Keen arrows from her poisonous eye  Unmoved thou shalt advance  Smile at her rage without a wound  Hear her fierce serpents hiss around  And all her illshaped monsters howl  II  Chaste Virgin say  Where shall begin the song before my eyes  So various are the Forms which stray  That all confused my mind  And smit with wild surprise  Scarce keeps its proper function Here behold  Upon a craggy rock reclined  High stretch'd out o'er the main  Despair and Horror on her faded brow  Sits Gallia while her arms enfold  The anguish of her breast as now  Wide o'er the deep she looks now o'er  Th' exhausted land her humbled power  She weeps thick falls the briny rain  II  Changed is the scene and here  Suppliant the savage chiefs of Indian race  In lowly guise with aspect meek appear  The rugged features of their face  No more with death and terror clad  Oft wont with wild foot thro the dreary shade  To range with Slaughter oft when mad  With wrath and hot revenge and stern desire  Of blood and prey in the calm silent night  For soft repose and slumber made  Have raised th' awakening yell of dread affright  Have basely slain the unresisting sire  The babe from it's fond mother tore  Soon weltering in her own and her loved infant's gore  III  Well skill'd in guile  And treacherous as th' inconstant air which waves  It's fickle pinion with a smile  Now o'er the tranquil sea  But soon with fury raves  And lifts it's tortured billows to the sky  Where the redflaming car of day  Bursts from his morning goal  O'erpowering darkness with refulgent might  While disarray'd her shadows fly  Before his piercing light  Proud Eastern Tyrants wear the chain  Trust their deep policy in vain  And treacherous wiliness of soul  III  Wheree'er his arms  Proceed th' immortal form of Victory  In her full bloom of matchless charms  Girds laurels round the brow  Of British Mars his eye  Gazes entranced upon the lovely maid  Whose winning smiles endow  His thoughts with ecstasy  Say then bright Queen of song wilt thou entwine  A chaplet for his honour'd head  Wilt thou among th' assembled Nine  Exalted paint his wondrous deeds  His thundring course his foaming steeds  His spear and brazen panoply  III  Ah no for what tho here  No vile ambition covets false renown  Yet learn O Brunswick name for ever dear  To Albion's sons that at the frown  Of Justice the distressful sigh  Mild Virtue breathes her cheeks the pitying drop  Bedews with tenderest sympathy  Each generous passion casts the head aside  And every child of Reason and of Sense  Ah be it thine with haste to stop  The fatal rage of War and Death dispense  With ardent zeal and true heroic pride  The blessings which attend the train  Of hallow'd Peace and dignify her glorious reign  IV  And lo they come  Soft o'er the flowers which deck the velvet mead  Content and meekey'd Quiet roam  Or join the choral dance  By frolic Laughter led  And liberal Science rears her blushing face  And Merit dares advance  From the dark haunt of Scorn  Where she stray'd pensive many a long long day  And every Muse and sister Grace  On thee shall beam the living ray  Thy memory prized when those who gain  Fame's blood besprinkled palm remain  The curse of ages yet unborn  IV  And see to bless  Thy life to soften Grandeur's aking fears  With the chaste conjugal caress  To soothe it's weighty toils  And heartcorroding cares  Where Charlotte every female virtue brings  Oh happy state in mutual smiles  Where souls communion mingle there  Love revels ever amiable and free  There modest Transport waves her wing  There dwells accordant Harmony  With true Delight nor e'er is seen  Groundless resentment's coward mien  Nor doubts nor jealousies appear  IV  Hail'd by a nation's voice  Long may you add a lustre to the crown  By merit your's long may the land rejoice  Ruled by a Prince who boasts himself her own  And when howe'er beloved howe'er  Call'd on to stay the laws of fate  Which not transcendent goodness spare  Shall snatch you hence from a lamenting world  Heir to his father's virtues may a son  Another George renew th' auspicious date  And mount with glory his paternal throne  As now far off be envious Faction hurl'd  Diffusive Peace oh spread thy bounties wide  And may another nymph like Charlotte be his bride  ODE to the LYRIC MUSE  I  SAY will the Lyric Muse  The themes of tender love refuse  Tho she with haughty state presides  Over the big tumultuous tides  Which down the sacred mountain pour  And stun the ear with deafening roar  Yet where more gentle currents stray  And thro the flowery vallies play  Laughing with transport as they flow  Where roses and where myrtles grow  Her hair with wreathes She oft has crown'd  And scatter'd her enchanting blessings round  I  Long in the Grecian isles  Retain'd by Cytheraea's smiles  Enamour'd of her rosy hue  While frolic pleasures round her flew  Stole from her lips the nectar'd kiss  And bathed their lightplumed wings in bliss  While Hebe danced with graceful tread  And the soft airs and passions led  While sallying from her temple's porch  Young Love waved high his magic torch  Thou too with sweetest look appear'd  And often thy melodious voice was heard  I  Hast thou forgot the melting strain  Which taught by thee thy Sappho sung  When stretch'd upon the Lesbian plain  O'er her the form of tender Pity hung  Didst thou not bountifully shed  Thy visions o'er Anacreon's head  And e'en the frozen breast of age  In amorous nets and toils engage  While all the virgins wondering stood  And laugh'd yet found themselves subdued  And when he immaturely died  Say did not Grief thy heavenly beauties hide  II  On what wideseated shore  Do mortals now thy name adore  Celestial Love Thy haunts of old  What clouds of sullen gloom enfold  How sunk in shades thy influence bright  Diffusing then it's genial light  Within th' incircled Haram reign  Tyrannic Lust and jealous Pain  Bitter Constraint internal Fears  Lean Anguish and corroding Cares  Unknown are there the mutual sighs  Which from the sympathetic breast arise  II  Thy more than human mien  By yellow Tiber oft was seen  And ere the Roman eagle flew  The sons of Britain to subdue  With native Innocence allied  Haply thy power did here reside  But big with plenitude of woes  From the rank earth a pest arose  Nature his shape with grief espied  And for her deathdoom'd offspring sigh'd  They sunk beneath an easy prey  And Love fled far from Avarice away  II  Didst thou then seek Columbia's strand  There thy propitious forehead shew  While raised by thy creative hand  The blooming flowers of social rapture grew  Too short a time alas from thence  Didst thou thy radiant gifts dispense  Behold th' impetuous monster haste  Rapine and Violence and Waste  Follow attendant on his flight  And lo before thy pitying sight  Weltering in blood thy people lies  To cursed gold the fated sacrifice  III  By force exiled ah where  Did thy insulted steps repair  Some island in the southern main  Perhaps enjoy'd thy bounteous reign  Or didst thou steer thy vagrant course  To Orellana's distant source  There while in artlessness array'd  The youth beholds his sunburnt maid  There while of every wish possest  He leans with fondness on her breast  Thou seest them in the palmy grove  And e'er their heads thy purple pinions move  III  There too the heavenly Muse  Showers perchance her kindly dews  While thus some Indian Horace sings  As to his love he strikes the strings  "Ah when you praise my rival's charms  "His comely neck and graceful arms  "With passion swells my fervid breast  "With passion hard to be supprest  "My senses float in terrors vain  "My blood retreats and comes again  "The tears steal down my cheeks and say  "With what slow fires I totally decay"  III  Oh if with me ye gentle powers  Ye sometimes would but deign to dwell  Borne by the quicklycircling hours  If ye would visit my sequester'd cell  One who with pure emotion glows  Who not the face of Avarice knows  Nor by Ambition drawn aside  But owning Nature for his guide  Who from his earliest day of youth  Confess'd her charms and worship'd Truth  Ye in that secret cell should find  And subject to your laws a willing mind  ODE  I  WHO with ungovern'd tongue will blame  The verse th' eternal Muse inspires  The soulilluminating flame  Kindled at heaven's own sacred fires  Who but the wretch of narrow mind  Whose sentiments are unrefin'd  From the vile dross with base alloy  Condemning him to plod along  Scarce elevated o'er the bestial throng  Unconscious of each nobler source of joy  I  Yet tho unto the frigid ear  Of native Dullness every strain  Of melody uncouth appear  And all the gifts of Science vain  Tho dazzled by the blaze of light  Vice starting turns away her sight  From where the Muses fix their sway  Tho Cruelty Revenge and Strife  And all the plagues which harrass human life  Keep far aloof and tread a distant way  I  Thy sons O Virtue with respect sincere  Bend lowly down before their holy shrine  To them they offer up the grateful prayer  And bless the influence of the powers divine  All who with more exalted thought  Have Wisdom's valued precepts sought  All who delight with spotless breast  In Beauty by the Graces drest  All who to bounteous Nature just  Dare her instinctive feelings trust  The Muses hallow'd votary approve  Enjoy his confidence and share his love  II  Hence then away ye vulgar crew  Such wish I to reject my lays  But hither turn ye worthier few  Embold'ned by whose genuine praise  Let the halfsoul'd coldblooded friend  Sneer while affecting to commend  Let the unfeeling fool laugh loud  To you alone the bard his lyre  Shall strike and quitting every mean desire  Soar far beyond the falselyjudging croud  II  Hard and unjust the poet's fate  Th' intrinsic value of his name  While all presume to estimate  Depress or fix his height of fame  Empty deceit as if their eye  Could trace the light'ning thro the sky  Pursue the comet's devious maze  Or looking on the blue profound  Where not the fathomline could ever sound  Pierce to the bottom with a single gaze  II  Ah wretch whoe'er is destined to possess  Superior strength and energy of mind  Unless highseated in a sphere to bless  Even against their wills perverse mankind  Else mingling with the common train  He speaks to fond selflove in vain  The voice sublime of Truth is stiled  Extravagant excentric wild  For Reason on the wings of light  Upborne eludes their grosser sight  And active sense springs t'ward the distant goal  Dwells not on parts but largely scans the whole  III  Yet if their weakness He befriend  His piercing thought benignly veil  Reflection's serious brow unbend  And her intenser rays conceal  They view him with familiar eyes  And being like themselves despise  O contradicting law the chain  Of Nature draws with all it's power  To mix in life and seek the social hour  Indignant Reason goads us thence again  III  She proves how vague the hope how blind  Which on external good relies  Which seeks for aught among mankind  To gratify the just and wife  Ah where then shall the Bard remove  Whose song the choral Nine approve  Or where the Sage whose breast disdains  The fickle throng the sordid Great  To those sequester'd shades that still retreat  Where Solitude closeleagued with Virtue reigns  III  Her's are the Graces her's the winning charms  Which the fix'd bosom from conviction please  From necessary choice within her arms  We wish to spend the remnant of our days  Not so in our first greener years  New to this world of vice and cares  By Flattery taught for what is Fame  But a delusive idle name  Which fades before the  living  breath  Though having pass'd the vale of Death  She may with vain solicitude return  And deck with fruitless wreathes the funeral urn  ODE  I  HOW lives the man whose thoughts obey  Stern Custom's arbitrary sway  He razes from his abject breast  The stamp by Nature's seal imprest  He floats on Dissipation's tide  Or cringes at the shrine of pride  Sees as the Croud directs his eyes  Or wears the garb of mean disguise  Unconscious wastes his genial prime  Still deeper plunged in guilt by time  II  When age steals on with tardy pace  And bounds fantastic Pleasure's race  No cheerful scene Reflection yields  But dreary glades or barren fields  Avarice usurps his tortured mind  He loathes the sun and hates mankind  On Him no pious Care attends  To Him no fond Affection bends  All view him with indignant gloom  And wish him in the silent tomb  III  How lives the man whose thoughts have broke  Imperious Custom's servile yoke  Him Nature guiding by the hand  Leads on where Truth and Reason stand  Virtue her mantle round him flings  And Honour waves her silver wings  He dares not stoop to foreign laws  But wisely courts his own applause  Health beams delighted from his eye  And Innocence walks smiling by  IV  When sinking in the vale of years  His head the hoary foliage bears  Backward He casts his tranquil sight  And views each scene reflected bright  No sullen damps his joy infest  No plagues of Avarice tear his breast  Him willing Duty hastes to serve  And strains with zeal each labouring nerve  While Love stands gazing on his face  Intent the latent wish to trace  SONNETS Written in the Highlands of Scotland in the Year  SONNET I  HENCE Sickness nor about my weary head  Thy languid vapours wrap and drooping wings▪  Better would'st thou thy baleful poison shed  In some dark cave where the Nightraven sings  Where heavy fits the gloomdelighted Owl  Where Aconite its loathsome juices throws  Where dwells the Bat and Serpents hissing foul  With fell Despair who never knows repose  There drag the Caitiff Wretch who hath betray'd  His trust hath ruin'd innocence or spilt  The sacred blood of him who gave him life  Him torture Stern nor will the lovely maid  The sweeteyed Mercy conscious of his guilt  Restrain thy hand or blunt thy sharpen'd knife  SONNET II  Tho here almost eternal Winter reigns  And piercing deep the womb of Nature chills  Tho born far off under a milder sky  The northern blast e'en thro my marrow thrills  And freezes up the lifeblood in my veins  The hardy natives o'er the mountains high  Trace out the step of Health where mid the snow  Or stubborn heath her feet unsandall'd stray  Hence active nerves and scorn of danger flow  Hence when of late call'd forth to mortal fray  At their approach Revenge more furious grew  War smiled while triple Rage new steel'd his heart  Pale bloodless Fear assumed a ghastlier hue  And Death more dreadful shook his pointed dart  SONNET III  When Recollection stirs up in the mind  And sets before her eye past scenes of woe  In vain the Wise their hoarded precepts bring  Dead unimpassion'd written in the flow  Of health and strength to nicer feelings blind  In vain against Reflection's piercing sting  They urge a formal phrase or adage quaint  And with a shrewd and wellturn'd point of wit  Or a laborious studied argument  Think to chase far away the fretful fit  They might as well drink the wide ocean dry  Or rob cold Winter of his snowy beard  Spite of the vain saws of Philosophy  Nature is prevalent and will be heard  SONNET IV  Now is the feudal vassalage destroy'd  By which the haughty Thane his subject train  Held at his will and arbitrary sway'd  The crouching throng from fear his lordly reign  Or with hereditary love obey'd  No resolutions of their own enjoy'd  They bent implicitly to his controul  Now by degrees they find that Liberty  Opens the narrow foldings of the soul  Erect they stand and boast that they are free  No more with rapine they the fields infest  Or seek out Slaughter in her secret den  But by the laws of equal Justice blest  Humanely think and feel that they are men  SONNET V  Here turn thine eyes thou bloated Luxury  That pamper'st thy nice taste with viands rare  Arraying thy soft limbs in cloathing vain  Sumptuous and delicate and thou shalt see  With what small reason men like thee complain  And how superfluous is thy idle care  The shed with uncemented stones built low  With flaggy grass or rushes overlaid  The fire of humble turf the bed of straw  Hard by with one sole coverlid bespread  Thus meanly lives the Caledonian Sire  With his halfnaked Progeny around  Yet joy and calm content his mind inspire  And every night He bathes in sleep profound  SONNET VI  I do not blame these rocks and barren hills  This desart wilderness which round me lyes  Wild glens where Nature rude hath fix'd her seat  Dark heaths o'er which the screaming Eagle flies  While the fierce winds my tottering mansion beat  For savage Pain the worst of human ills  Tho scenes of pure and exquisite delight  Were round me cast meadows and fairy groves  All that might captivate the wond'ring sight  Tho by soft streams should echo murmuring Doves  Tho warm Etesian gales should gently play  And Philomela tune her sweetest voice  Possessing whom night envies not the day  Pain savage Pain forbids me to rejoice  SONNET VII  Had I but met whence Nature bade expect  That just return of tenderness exprest  That mutual generosity of mind  And liberal turn which judging from my breast  I fondly thought to others were consign'd  Always reluctant meanly to suspect  I should not far far from my native home  With numerous cares in my sad bosom pent  Have hither e'er prolong'd my wandering tread  Not willingly but driven by fate to roam  I should not then have press'd this cheerless bed  To sharp reflection more than pain a prey  Chewing the cud of bitter discontent  Where these high hills the Lomond Lake survey  A PICTURE of HUMAN LIFE  ELATE with Hope and her enlivening fires  I rush'd impetuous o'er the fields of youth  I gave up all my soul to gay desires  And Fancy's dazzling form mistook for Truth  She held her magic glass and strait I saw  A youth with rare accomplishments endued  Perfect he seem'd nor quickly did I know  That struck with wonder of myself I stood  When known a transient blush o'erspread my face  Selflove soon took the sanguine stain away  Increased each mental visionary grace  And deck'd each feature with a brighter ray  Wellpleased the treacherous Nymph O youth she cried  Point thy ideas to the highest aim  Why are superior virtues still untried  Why does not Worth its lawful honours claim  Inactive rise lift thy aspiring brow  Thine be the joys of wealth of power of fame  Let thy young breast with emulation glow  Behold the noblest and be thou the same  Fool that I was with giddy transport blind  I swallow'd the sweet sound with eager ear  My eyes the latent poison could not find  Nor heart think evil of a shape so fair  Drunk as with wine methought I could attain  To be of each admiring tongue the theme  Whether I will'd th' heroick palm to gain  Or haunt the olive shade of Academe  Whether with Love to waste the smiling hours  To melt the captived virgin's icy breast  Or wander in the Muse's roseate bowers  Weave the proud wreathe and dignify my crest  Methought my penetrating eye could dart  Thro the black plots and mysteries of state  Pierce the thick foldings of the human heart  And rule with Judgement's voice the deep debate  Wildly fantastic the fierce northern blast  I might as soon with guiding rein have taught  Or dryshod o'er the billowy sea have past  As into form have changed unbodied thought  Ye gay delusions whither are ye fled  Begot by Health on Fiction's lovely form  Will ye ne'er gently hover o'er my head  With rapture ne'er again my bosom warm  Say canst thou bid old Time with stealthy pace  Retread the paths his feet have trod before  The sun mete backward his celestial race  And we'll again our pleasing dreams restore  Again from the full fount of lise thy blood  Swift bursting forth shall swell each turgid vein  Th' enthusiastic spirits in a flood  From each strong nerve shall fire thy kindling brain  This Fate withstandsand Reason sternest guide  Contracts in narrower bounds th' excursive view  She plainly shews throughout the fleeting tide  Of Life what airy bubbles we pursue  By her does conscious Diffidence and Fear  Ambition's rage and Fancy's whims controul  The flighty purposes to youth so dear  And that wild elasticity of soul  Hence then ye vain ye unsubstantial joys  Able the self▪deluded foul to bless  Yet when alas among life's real toys  Shall I such soothing happiness possess  ODE  I  ASSUME O Vice thy proper hue  In thy own native likeness stand  Soon shalt thou find thy subjects few  Thy throne uprear'd on sand  Abhorrent Nature with surprise  Would turn away her loathing eyes  Ingenuous Youth with pain  Thy monstrous shape would see  Cover'd with each toadspotted stain  While writhing Anguish and pale Infamy  Stalk close behind too desperate to complain  II  But cunning as thou art  Well dost thou know the human heart  It's intimate recesses lie  Open to thy wily eye  Hence thou with many a mimic grace  Stol'n from the Virtues as of old  Unconscious of an enemy so near  Always open and sincere  Ever with decent freedom bold  They stripp'd themselves to lave  Beneath a grot in the translucent wave  Hast deck'd thy odious face  III  Thy unsuspecting lover thinks them true  Of cloudy vapours made  A thousand dazzling forms parade  Before his cheated view  A thousand pleasures move  Breathing Mirth and social Love  Some with quickdoubling feet  And winning smiles advance  In the mazy circling dance  And then with more alluring step retreat  IV  Others on waving wing  Such notes of lively transport sing  Or varying now their strain  With such dying melody complain  That guided by th' enchanting sound  And swallowed up in hearing every sense  The fated victim o'er the magic ground  Straying without defence  His careless progress takes  Till lost among inextricable brakes  Or in the midst of some wild heath forlorn  He finds himself at last  Hears nothing but the wintry blast  Which all his idle moanings flouts with scorn  V  Fatigued and spiritless he lies  Nor dares from the cold earth to rise  Night closes inAh where art thou  Celestial Hope thy face the darkness shrouds  Oh through the quickdisparting clouds  Appear and by the moon's clear ray  Let him behold thy placid brow  Faithful companion of thy way  By his golden lance well known  And firmingirding adamantine zone  Bring Resolution in a purple vest  By the young unfledg'd Moments drest  VI  Oh raise him in your arms and while his veins  Yet flow with life while any strength remains  Bear him away with swiftest course  For should Sleep on him steal  And with it's dew his eyelids seal  Not even an immortal force  Could open them again no more  Shall he behold the sun of Virtue pour  It's radiance from the morningsky

for Candour lays  And branding innocence with shame  The Virgin's faith betrays  Who practiced in destructive art  Her thoughts sincere arraigns  And tho his image fills her heart  Of cold neglect complains  Then while She feels the quick alarm  Seizes th' unguarded time  Honour and Love's emotion warm  And glories in his crime  Such Cynthio and Aspasia were  In pride of earliest youth  A victim sunk the generous Fair  To his dissembled truth  Pall'd by possession tho her soul  Was worth a kingdom's price  Yet all it's charms could not controul  The harden'd slave of vice  Tho on her bosom well he knew  What pangs would urge their force  Pangs which their sharper tortures drew  From Virtue's native source  But Vengeance sure tho now defied  Shall harrow up his mind  That mercy which his soul denied  Shall be from him confin'd  The grief which to her Sire befell  His agony's excess  No pen no other tongue can tell  A Father only guess  Let us said He my Friends proceed  To where th' afflicted strays  Oh may our cares at least succeed  To give some transient ease  Let us her bosom's rankling wound  With tender pity fill  Or sit in silent woe around  As the mute mourner still  But lo She darts across the green  Spare spare my tortured sight  Before my eyes this hour had seen  Why closed they not in night  Her face I view distraction there  I read it in her eye  That glance bespeaks and that wild air  Extremest misery  She opes her pallid lipsoh worth▪  O ruin'd excellence  Thy unconnected thoughts pour forth  And reave me of my sense  I've been to yonder wood to gather flowers  There on a bank so steep  I saw him lying fast asleep  I stole on softly to the bowers  No ear  My silent step could hear  For why should I awake  Or cause him from his dream to start  But a fierce snake  My footsteps did pursue  I nothing of it knew  And springing on me eat out all my heart  See what a frightful wound  Ah no it cannot now be found  So I snatch'd up my flowers in haste  And round my head have traced  But they're too bright and gay  As I wear them in my hair  They make my complexion more faded appear  Away away away  Yet I have been as fair as they  But should  they  be betray'd  Deprived of their bloom  They'd sink down to the tomb  And be pale and wan like me  Be sure with them let my hearse be drest  And strew them o'er my earthy bed  Where I shall shortly lie  When the cold turf supports my head  I'll take my fill of rest  The sunbeams gay and fine  Shall see no grief of mine  Nor the worm hear me sigh  But I pray you secret prove  Tell it not to my love  Nor let him that way go  For should he come in  And see me look so thin  His heart would burst in two  Nohe has quite forgot  He says he knows me not  Now in my misery  And will you believe him too  Has madness seiz'd your mind  Tho you may think him true  The faithless seas and wind  Are not more false than he  Methinks I can't but smile  That he should  you  beguile  I  heed not what he says  But stop up my ears  And am deaf to his prayers  In vain his flatteries he displays  And tells me I am fair  As the newfallen snow  That my keen eyes have pierc'd him through  That me alone he lovesNo no  When once deceived beware  Fool that I was I thought him true  Oh snatch him snatch him from my view  Yet ye tormentors set him free  Give him his liberty  The pain his conscience brings  Is worse than all your racks of steel  Your whips and cruel stings  I know what he must feel  He swore so holy was his flame  That I should never know  A pleasure or a woe  But he should feel the fame  So bid the bridemaids come  I'll be dress'd all in white  We'll take the damask room  'Tis long before 'tis night  What say you Lost 'tis all a jest  It is not yet quite dark  He stays till I'm undrest  Is that the morning lark  Not yet return'd where fled where fled  Alas I knew it well  I knew that he was dead  Altho you would not tell  I'm wond'rous cold My hands are clay  My blood in frost is bound  Yet force me not away  We'll lie in the same spot of ground  Under this marble stone  I shall enjoy him all alone  Oh help my Friends her accents low  Her interrupted breath  And these convulsive strugglings shew  The quick approach of death  And are there powers in Heaven above  Will they this sight behold  Then pensive Virtue fearful rove  Exulting Vice be bold

Damon move  I gazed upon him with suprise  But not one thought had I of love  My soul grew fond of fancies vain  Tetchy and froward nought could please  Yet knew I not what gave me pain  Nor thought it love but some disease  Soon as the beauty of the sky  Night had defaced with pallid hue  Striving to sleep I down should lie  But sleep away far from me flew  Instead thereof sad sighs and fears  About me cruel watch maintain'd  Forth gush'd th' involuntary tears  And Sorrow then triumphant reign'd  If any drop of slumb'ring rest  Into my weary soul distill'd  What frightful dreams would then infest  What horror through my bosom thrill'd  Then up I from my bed should start  And all my former grief renew  Think on that image in my heart  And all its heavenly charms review  All night a stranger to repose  To ease a stranger all the day  No sports no company I chose  To Solitude a willing prey  Thus cared I not abroad to spread  Youth's plant when in its fairest prime  But let it all neglected shed  Both fruit and flower before its time  Alas should this be love I cried  Too late the fatal cause I found  In vain each lenient art I tried  Too deep had pierced the rankling wound  Nor other cure had I for grief  But my hard fortune to deplore  To languish like the fallen leaf  And feed with plaints th' impoison'd sore  Thus t'ward the silent grave I paced  Thus by degrees decay'd my frame  Till by the long and lingering waste  I like a pined ghost became  INSCRIPTION for an ARBOUR  ENTER of welcome sure beneath this shade  Ye sacred few whose eyes can see with scorn

Loves bewail  And all who finer passions feel  Dead is the sparrow of my Fair  The sparrow who her tender care  Who her excess of fondness proved  Whom dearer than her eyes she loved  For he the sweetest mind possess'd  Conscious by whom he was caress'd  He ne'er from her endearments flew  Not she her mother better knew  But leaping round in wanton play  Twitter'd to her the livelong day  Now goes he to the gloomy bourn  Whence no one ever may return  Perish ye fatal shades who spare  Nothing that's either good or fair  Now have ye snatch'd with ruthless mind  The best and fairest of his kind  O Impious Deed from cheerful day  To force the little wretch away  For whom my Girl finds no relief  Her swelling eyes are red with grief  To SLEEP  WHERE are the downy slumbers fled  Which hover'd nightly o'er my head  And soon as I my pillow prest  Closed my eyes in sweetest rest  By wakeful Love forbid to stay  Alas too long ye keep away  O come ye vagrant slumbers spread  Again your pinions o'er my head  O long unchear'd my sweet repose  Again my fainting eyelids close  ELEGY  THE truest Love is most reserved and shy  No look of confidence or boldness wears  Known by the humble brow and soften'd eye  And full of wavering doubts and anxious fears  When I perceived that Thespia had o'ercome  My yielding heart and fixt her empire there  That from her hands I must receive my doom  And all my future weal must flow from her  How did my bosom fluctuate with the pain  Of native bashfulness and strong desire  What varying conflicts did I not sustain  How struggled soft respect with Passion's fire  Oft did I wish the secret to have told  But awe withheld and modest dread prevail'd  Her presence all my faculties controul'd  And every settled resolution fail'd  At length with firm intent I sought the Fair  With firm intent to pour out all my heart  At once display the story of my care  And the long misery of consuming smart  To a sequester'd grove her steps I drew  She without guile went innocently free  No ill suspecting for no ill she knew  Nor fear'd to trust herself alone with me  At first my usual converse I assay'd  Hoping from thence to gain a tranquil air  And as along the winding path we stray'd  With frequent blossoms deck'd her flowing hair  But still my shorten'd breath fast went and came  O'er my embarrass'd limbs a stiffness hung  My heart throbb'd strong and shook my labouring frame  And fears I knew not how unnerved my tongue  Resolved to speak some secret power restrain'd  Ashamed and angry with myself I grew  With crimson consciousness my cheeks were stain'd  And quick again the conscious stains withdrew  She whether observant all the while  Or else this strange confusion to relieve  Talks with her wonted ease and careless smile  But brief and vague each answer which I gave  Then chang'd my fickle will it's first design  Determined sudden on some future day  Then would I each perplexity entwine  And every ardent wish before her lay  A transient calm succeeded in my breast  Yet sure thought I they were not so conceal'd  But she th' emotions of my heart hath guess'd  She too may haply wish they were reveal'd  Though now my faultering tongue its aid denies  She must have read the language of my soul  Nor have I mark'd displeasure in her eyes  When forth from mine the glance of Love hath stole  Then turning round in haste as if afraid  Lest diffidence again might intervene  Not daring to erect my timid head  My hesitating lips disclosed my pain  ELEGY  IN nothing was I learn'd but only how  To pen my flocks and drive them to the field  In the strait furrow to direct my plough  And when my hoe and pruninghook to wield  Uncultivated was my mind and mean  My abject thoughts low fasten'd to the earth  Till Love with hand benign brake Custom's chain  And bade me soar beyond my humble birth  With beauty fired I look'd around and saw  The charms of Nature never seen before  O Love a willing vassal to thy law  I bend I feel thy blessings and adore  Prompted by thee  as yet  with trembling tongue  I call'd the Muses and desired their aid  My woodnotes in the hazel copse I sung  And caught th' attention of the listening maid  She listen'd to my strains she heard my tale  While deepening blushes o'er her cheeks arise  The soft consenting sigh my lips inhale  I see the yielding languor of her eyes  No witness Truth if ever I estrange  This grateful heart which only beats for thee  Why utter needless vows I cannot change  Fix'd are my bonds nor will I e'er be free  Fix'd is thy gentle sway by thee my mind  Avarice and all its sordid acts disdains  The common vice of Passion unrefined  The common vice among our country Swains  Hence stinging cares hence groveling they behold  The state of riches with an envious eye  They think not aught beyond the power of gold  Nor know how Love can lift the soul on high  Oh come my Fairone I have thatch'd above  And whiten'd all around my little cot  I've shorn the hedges leading to the grove  Nor is the seat and willow bower forgot  Low is the path of life in which I move  Yet wilt thou not regret the higher sphere  Of Wealth and noisy Pride while faithful Love  And Innocence and sweet Content are here  ELEGY  STILL blooming Health thy modest graces shed  O'er the clear surface of my Thespia's cheek  There let thy fresh thy glowing tints be spread  Thy smiles enlightening and complacence meek  Protect her where she goes ye gentle Powers  Pure Denizons of undulating air  Whether from glowing noontide's sultry hours  Or Evening's dewy shades protect the Fair  'Tis true my Thespia I indeed confess  That selfish are the prayers and vows I pay  With no disinterested voice I bless  The Gods or pour the supplicating lay  For ah from thee and from thy looks I find  Warm to my heart each cordial joy must flow  Sweetening the ills of Life from thee my mind  Must taste its keenest sense of piercing woe  Thine is the masterkey each spring to rule  Each hidden movement of my secret thought  Sure thou wert bred in some Enchanter's school  Who all his spells and mystick charms has taught  Yet then would Holy Truth with thee reside  Truth which unbounded Confidence may trust  Yet then would mean Deceit fly far aside  And wild Caprice confounding false and just  Would'ft thou have said as I struck dumb with fear  Tremblingly pointed out my humble bower  Haply Tranquility and Peace are there  For them I scorn the gawdy farce of Power  O thou sincerest how shall I repay  The endless debt of gratitude I owe  Quickly my Fair point out to me the way  And shew the path for thou alone canst shew  Tho silent is thy tongue thy speaking eye  The modest blushes o'er thy cheeks which rove  That deepdrawn breath that panting breast reply  The sole return is tenderness and love  Will this suffice and dost thou ask no more  What the spontaneous feelings needs must give  Oh let me lavish on thee all my store  Nor cease to love thee till I cease to live  For ever rivetted within my heart  Thy dear unsullied image shall remain  When from that seat I bid it to depart  May I by some tremendous stroke be slain  No common death I shall deserve to die  To pine by inches on a barren strand  Scorch'd by the vengeful Sun's severest eye  Nor by one sportive wandering Zephyr fann'd  To freeze on some bleak rock to glut the rage  Of howling beasts within the dreary waste  Or live in youth despis'd in helpless age  Th' extremities of want and woe to taste  To walk a moving plague among mankind  Shunn'd hated and refused the alms I crave  Refused Despair's last only wish to find  A still retirement in the peaceful grave  In that fond hope to be deceived to hear  With soul yet conscious in the churchyard way  The fierce invective cast upon my bier  And scornful Laughter dancing o'er my clay  All this and more I shall deserve to prove  When led by changeful Fancy's wanton eye  I turn a faithless truant to thy love  And on the wings of vagrant Falsehood fly  ELEGY  AH whence my Thespia can that anguish flow  That silent anguish of expressive woe  That sigh which from thy struggling bosom stole  That look which pierces to thy inmost soul  Ah say my Thespia I conjure thee say  To  me  the hidden cause thou  mayst  display  Half of thyself I claim my lawful share  Yet would to Heaven that I the whole might bear▪  Unveil thy thoughts in confidence to me  And trust a bosom fraught with sympathy  From thee would I my labouring heart confine  And are not all its deepest secrets thine  Wretch that I am am I who thee from pain  To shield would pour out life at every vein  Am I the cause and couldst thou ever spy  A look of coldness glancing from my eye  To thee a cold blank look Oh too refined  And subtile errour of thy feeling mind  A delicacy apt too deep to dive  To each nice touch to tenderly alive  Though I esteem it as a blessing sent  As the more polish'd mind's chief ornament  A sacred spark kindled by Heaven's own ray  Yet let not Sensibility betray  Thou weep'st where did my tongue profanely rove  How could I blame thee 'twas excess of Love  O let me circle thee with strict embrace  Warm breast to breast and glowing face to face  My fixed lips while speechless rapture ties  Imbibe the lucid moisture of thine eyes  Thy melting spirit in each breath inhale  Gaze on thee till the nerves of vision fail  And quite o'erpower'd by Love's imperious sway  Feel all my fainting soul dissolve away  ELEGY  WHAT have I done what crime in me is found  What secret evil lurking in my breast  That while all Nature else is smiling round  Heaven has on me it's heaviest stroke impress'd  Have I e'er dropp'd a wish of other's harm  Or done an ill tho ne'er to be reveal'd  Have I not always breath'd th' emotion warm  On the chaste lip of Social Virtue seal'd  Ah is it not enough that far away  From my own native happy fields I rove  Far from each friendly name condemn'd to stray  And torn by cruel force from her I love  But must thro her the barbed steel be sent  Which piercing with severest torture wounds  Shall she I love convey the punishment  Which Justice must confess exceeds its bounds  On me rain all your woes ye righteous Powers  Though hard I'll strive the misery to bear  View Sickness steal away my lingering hours  On tainted wing nor drop a pining tear  But ah the gentle Virgin's tender frame  O Brighthair'd Chastity O Angel Truth  If ye are aught beyond an empty name  Save save in pity Innocence and Youth  Shield shield me from the racking thought I spy  From her cold cheeks the bland suffusion fled  Dead is the piercing magick of her eye  The lustredarting beam of sense is dead  She calls on meOh snatch the last embrace▪  Woods rivers mountains countries intervene  Oh curse of curses ne'er that lovely face  Again shall I behold e'en the last scene  Some dreary satisfaction might afford  Some solace to the madness of Despair  Gloating in secret on his gloomy hoard  With eye intorted viewing what is there  AMYNTAS  An ELEGIAC POEM  THE strains of young Amyntas when disease  Prey'd on his frame and hopeless of relief  With anxious soul He struck the solemn lyre  I give to those whose feelings like his own  Unwarp'd by dissipation or the touch  Of morbid sensibility are true  To genuine pity who like him retired  Far from the world but not with him condemn'd  To share the bitter cup still love the tones  Pleasingly sad which Nature prompts to flow  Nor selfish from affliction turn their eye  Nor scorn th' impassion'd Muse's hallow'd lay  Thus in his secret haunts He struck the lyre  And thus in solemn note the strains began  Hail ye sequester'd rocks ye pines which shed  Your melancholy horrors o'er my head  Ye scenes where Solitude unfolds her wings  And silence still as death around her flings  Not that I invocate your darkening glade  To pour upon my mind a deeper shade  Superfluous were your help to wake the strain  Of grief when feeling nature bids complain  When stern reflection speeds her arrow keen  And piercing tells me "thus thou once hast been"  No in the regal dome of festive pride  Where luxury expands her banners wide  Where noisy riot and unthinking mirth  And the whole brood of folly take their birth  Cheerless would sit the wretch o'erwhelm'd with pain  And e'en a Siren's note would charm in vain  Yet hail for here I may without controul  Indulge the sad emotions of my soul  Into this lonely place th' insulting eye  Of curious impudence will fail to pry  From the false voice of harlot pity free  Here I may give a loose to misery  Here I may drag my languid seet and slow  Here I may lay my drooping limbs full low  On the cold ground in wild diffusion spread  Nerveless my arms and unsustain'd my head  Why was I born or why did I not come  A blasted Embryo from my mother's womb  Curst be the moment when the midwife smiled  And hail'd her parent of a living child  Yet I accuse not Heaven I lived I grew  And seem'd as nurst by it's descending dew  With joy and health thro childhood's paths I ran  With joy and health thro youth rose up to man  Yes in the strength of rosy health array'd  I've trod with active feet the verdant mead  Elate and conscious of her genial glow  With active feet have climb'd the mountain's brow  When the highmettled blood with loosen'd reins  Fiery and hot rush'd bounding thro the veins  When every nerve with quick sensation fraught  Each touch sound sight to the warm seat of thought  Bore swiftly and with pleasing stamp impress'd  When sweet content selfnurtured in my breast  Fix'd her abode from whom goodnature sprung  She tuned each gentle accent of my tongue  Spread o'er my cheeks her mild complacent air  My forehead smoothed and laugh'd at angry care  Rather be curst the day when in the pride  Of youth and prodigal of strength I tried  My limbs beyond what prudent nature gave  When I with foolish emulation brave  Tortured each tendon every nerve to gain  A bootless victory on the grassy plain  Not used to share the wrestler's hardy deed  Not form'd to bear away th' athletic meed  Thence the cold sweat which now bedews my limbs  Thence the damp mist before my eyes which swims  The hoarse weak voice and interrupted breath  Each anxious presage of approaching death  Which terrifies my mind it's powers decay'd  No longer in it's wonted robes array'd  Of constancy of firmness ere I die  Reason seems dead and dull fatuity  Threatens her vacant throne Oh dreadful thought  Better have never been better be nought  Than just with sense enough to see and rue  The dismal change to drag on life and view  Blighted by sickness' harsh and wintery frown  Each intellectual blossom falling down  Each intellectual fruit which late so fair  Put forth by health and youth the balmy air  Promised to ripen to look round in vain  For gay imagination's vivid train  The quickwing'd thought which gathering knowledge flew  From Earth to the blue arch of Heaven or drew  Whene'er She pleased from her own secret store  Sweet entertainment ope'd the hidden door  Most difficult to open and beheld  Herself in naked entity reveal'd  What tho the lustre of these eyes is gone  These eyes which once could gaze upon the sun  When in the centre of his noontide height  He pour'd redundant his strong beams of light  What tho these nerves thro which in gladsome tide  I felt the genial happy spirits glide  With cold obstruction pine I had not cared  If firm my mental eye if my soul shared  It's pristine warmth nor should corporeal pain  Howe'er tormenting urge me to complain  Yes worse than racks or fire it is to find  Erased the loved ideas of the mind  Yet still surviving o'er God's earth to stray  A mere mechanic piece of moving clay  Tho even this perchance I might have borne  Had not from out my suffering breast been torn  Her generous offspring wisdom of the head  Had not the virtues of the heart been dead  I might have spared But where alas is now  That instantaneous sympathising glow  Which when another's sudden good was known  I felt like lightning o'er my bosom thrown  Oh I remember at the tale of grief  My loaded heart in tears hath found relief  In purest drops from pity's genuine source  Now self engrosses all now self by force  Weighs down the nobler passions in their stead  Suspicion peevishness and gloom succeed  Fain would I fly from their detested sway  Tho oft rebellious still I must obey  My soul is harrass'd out with anxious care  And each unfriendly passion harbours there  Ye Maids of Memory who benignly bright  Ope'd your gay visions to my youthful sight  Led by whose retrospective power I stray'd  Thro darksome shade or sunny lawn and play'd  With wildeyed Fancy while at her command  A thousand wing'd ideas rose and fann'd  With light capricious plume my glowing face  Ye Maids of Memory wrapt in whose embrace  I've spent all day and all the livelong night  Nor wish'd so ravishing was the delight  Return of morn as o'er your sacred page  I hung enamour'd while with eager rage  I swallow'd as it were your magic lay  Ye Maids of Memory to whom I pay  E'en now faint adoration for no more  Is left to pay each rapturous thought is o'er  The blaze of love which kindled in my breast  When to my wond'ring eyes you stood confest  Witness ye Maids of Memory how my soul  Expatiated then no mean controul  Shackled elastic thought no straiten'd sphere  It's efforts circumscribed was even air  Allpiercing air more free then did I live  Then could I pleasure take then pleasure give  Then dwelt I with the gay or with the grave  But now my soul is an imprison'd slave  She strives indeed for freedom but in vain  So dark the dungeon and so strong the chain  With thee too God of wine and of delight  Attentive to the voice and happy flight  Of inexpressive humour I with joy  Have often sate not thee with vile alloy  Of frontless ribaldry debased but thee  Where on each side of genuine liberty  Stood the fair forms of decency and sense  They order'd social gayety dispense  Her blessings widen'd friendship's raptured heart  Bade into life each generous feeling start  Awaken'd native genius all around  Sincere colloquial intercourse was found  Communion sweet of souls Alas the hour  Is come when I no longer own thy power  Mirth what art Thou to me an empty name  I own it tho I blush a crimson shame  Society I hate I shun the way  Of converse as if there infection lay  Far at a distance by myself I go  For loneliness well fits the soul of woe  Nor can I bear to be despised when seen  Conscious I am not what I once have been  The world must know the same I feel I feel  Contempt more piercing than the sharpest steel  Her everrankling wound no balm can cure  The pain no mortal flesh can long endure  I have not been despised the listening ear  Hath wish'd again my ended speech to hear  Not that I ask'd respectful awe to find  But more had gain'd the love of humankind▪  By those who fully knew me most carest  By those who knew the secrets of my breast  I have not been despised the partial eye  Of beauty hath on me been cast the sigh  Hath heaved the bosom of the pitying maid  When I the sufferings of my heart display'd  The hidden grief which prey'd upon my frame  The secret fears and illdissembled flame  Ah why was there to me a soul just Heaven  Susceptible of tender passion given  Why did my eyes which scorn'd the pomp of gold  Enraptur'd beauty's angel form behold  Catch the quick glance imbibe the gentle smart  And pour the grateful frenzy o'er my heart  While still my mind with higher notions fraught  And a more noble dignity of thought  Spurn'd each base impulse nor to gain alone  Corporeal charms desired but to be one  One soul with her I loved t' immingle there  This this I cried is only love sincere  When wishes passions sentiments agree  For such as these ethereal harmony  Starts from her sphere and ravisht at the sight  Dwells in their presence with supreme delight  The joys these only know these only prove  The feelings worthy the blest name of love  Thus while I spake around my youthful head  Delusive hope her flattering pinions spread  Sprinkled her magic dust before my eyes  And bade as true the airy visions rise  Each soft domestic bliss methought was mine  For me did cordial amity entwine  Her everflorid wreathe O vainly blind  Now I perceive the folly of my mind  To plan down aught in this uncertain state  Yet who could trace the mazy steps of fate  No for me ne'er shall burn the nuptial fire  No prattling infant e'er shall call me sire  While sitting on my knee my warm cheeks glow  And my fond eyes with tenderness o'erflow  A solitary being to the tomb  I must descend snatcht in life's early bloom  A solitary wretch nor shall a tear  Of wife or child wash my funereal bier  Nor when time's mellowing hand shall bring relief  And lenient years have soothed the pangs of grief  With pleasing melancholy shall reflect  Upon my words my actions recollect  And keep my memory in their hearts awake  With "thus my Husband did our Father spake"  Alas why flow these murmurs from my mind  When fair Religion whispers be resign'd  Resign'd I will be for resign I must  But till these limbs are mingled with the dust  Till my soul takes it's flight and cold and dead  This corpse is with it's brother reptiles laid  Nor is that time far off with listless pain  The wasting evil creeps thro every vein  Till I'm no more within my faithful breast  The stamp by nature's cunning hand imprest  Will still prevail if I were so inclined  I can't forget that I'm of humankind  Still must look back and idly wish to stay  Still must look forward shuddering with dismay  Still must regret that I in vain was born  And weep that I must sink in early morn  Like a young oak in all his towering pride  Scathed by the lightning on the mountainside  What art thou Death whose horrors can appall  The daring wicked and the virtuous soul  Can terrify the coward and the brave  Fear'd by the free man fear'd too by the slave  If by thy aid when bursting from it's clay  The soul soars upward to perennial day  Mixes with angels in the blest abode  Hymning Heaven's King itself a Demigod  Why doth not Nature gladly view thy face  And yield with pleasure to thy kind embrace  Why arm'd with an imaginary sting  Shrinks She beneath thy overshadowing wing  Why thanks not her deliverer from strife  And hails thee Death the Harbinger of life  Ah why thou thinking Substance if thy flame  From Heaven and Earth's immortal Father came  Equal in kind tho not so in degree  Particle of th' eternal Deity  Art thou to this vile mould so closely tied  In chains of such strict unity allied  As if on it thou solely didst depend  It's birth thy origin it's death thy end  As grow it's members thy sensations grow  As flow it's juices so thy spirits flow  By age or sickness as it's nerves decay  Thou seem'st to languish fade and die away▪  An inmate of a cott joyous and strong  While gentle gales the summer hours prolong  But when the stormy gust and wintry flaw  Pierce thro the crazy door and roof of straw  Shivering and cold and sad confined at home  Able nor willing o'er the fields to roam  And when a whirlwind's rage or torrent's fall  Shakes o'er thy trembling head the ruin'd wall  O'erwhelm'd thou liest or by the furious stream  Swept clean away like a forgotten dream  Ah hold I stand upon a mountain's brow  And dark and deep is the abyss below  Reason recoils and upward casts her eye  Where cherub Hope sails thro the azure sky  Transparent is her vest and from her wings  Strongbeaming rays of steady light She flings  Join'd hand in hand with Faith She flys along  Faith ever blooming ever fair and young  Than fabled Hebe She more blooming far  Her graceful head with a re  p  endent star  Majestically crown'd aloft they fly  The lovely pair nor can my dazzled eye  Pursue them farther than to where it's sight  Is overpower'd by th' effulgent light  Of heavenly radiance issuing from above  Yet sacred strains of rapture and of love  Break on my ear and the sweet thrilling sounds  Soothe my sad soul and ease her smarting wounds  Help me ye Powers from out that soul to tear  Each mean each groveling thought which harbours there  To mount on high your shining track pursue  Till Heaven unbounded bursts upon my view▪  By you upborne oh teach me to despise  Life's real evils and imagined joys  Look down with pity on the human race  Then view myself and blush at what I was  Oh give me Patience give me to enfold  The virgin in my arms give me to hold  Forever hold her feast on each sweet grace  Inherent in her neverfrowning face  Her steady eye ne'er moved with grief or pain  Her rosy lips ne'er open'd to complain  Support me meek firm Excellence inspire  Into my fainting breast thy passive fire  Which tho deprest yet

cumbrous load of hateful clay  A dark thick cloud is cast before my sight  Plunged headlong down from my presumptuous height  Above mortality no man can go  To do his best is all that He can do  Come

the northern parts of Europe After having carried on his depredations with success for many years he was at length taken prisoner by Ella King of Northumberland whose coasts He had invaded and put to death by Him being as was reported cast into a dungeon full of serpents His melancholy  fate stimulated his Son Ivar to avenge it and on this occasion the famous standard of the Raven is said to have been embroidered by his Sisters and consecrated with such magic rites as insured victory to those before whom it was borne Under this standard Ivar made a descent on the territories of Ella fought with vanquished and put Him to death in his turn  The following Poem if we may credit tradition was composed by Ragnar in his horrid place of confinement It is apparent however that it must have been the work of some Scald or Bard probably to do honour to to the memory of his deceased King to place before the eyes of his subjects his heroic atchievements and urge them and his Son or Sons according to the Poem itself to revenge  It is preserved by Olaus Wormius in his book de Literaturâ Runicâ While the frequent return of the same images and expressions shews the Author's unacquaintance with the nicer rules of composition He exhibits a species of  savage greatness a fierce and wild kind of sublimity and a noble contempt of danger and death If for no other reason this Epicedium is valuable as it doubtless affords a lively picture of the manners and sentiments of the northern nations  The DEATH SONG OF RAGNAR LODBRACH  I  WITH our sword's resistless might  We have thinn'd the ranks of fight  In early life his volumed train  The crested serpent roll'd in vain  Thora's charms the matchless prize  Gothland saw my fame arise  Thronging crouds the monster scan  Shouts applausive hail me Man  All his fierceness prompt to try  The shaggy vestment cloath'd my thigh  Soon transpierced in death he lay  My falchion smote for splendid pay  From this first exploit as the story goes Ragnar obtained his sirname of Lodbrach i e rough or hairy breeches For the King of Got  land having promised his daughter Thora to the man who should kill a vast serpent which wasted the country Ragnar undertook the enterprize and dressing himself in the skins of beasts with the hairy side outermost throw water over them the cold to which He purposely exposed himself forming round him a suit as it were of frozen armour He met the serpent whose teeth had no effect on this impenetrable mail fixed him to the ground with his spear and ripping him up with his sword tore out his heart After the victory the King presented him his daughter and on account of his rough dress gave him the name above mentioned by which he was from that time distinguished  Olaus Magnus relates this adventure but says He fought with and killed two snakes That the King had taken them when young and bred them up as a guard for his daughter but as they increased in size they became a public terror and poisoned the country  Such is the fabulous beginning attributed by Bards and Historians to the actions of Ragnar Lodbrach His subsequent adventures seem however better founded and carry no marks of sable till we come to the last scene when the manner of his death is as wonderful and incredible as his first appearance  II  In prime of youth we steer our course  T'ward the morning's distant source  Thro the vast Oreonic flood  Torrents run of crimson blood  The yellowfooted bird we feast  Plenty fills the ravenous beast  Our steelstruck helms sublime resound  The sea is all one bleeding wound  Our foes lie weltering on the shore  Deep the raven wades in gore  III  Crown'd with twenty rolling years  High we raise our glittering spears  And deeds of glorious worth display  Wherever shines the lamp of day  The trembling East we still appall  Eight mighty chiefs at Dimen fall  We scorn with mean and niggard food  To treat the generous eagle brood  The wound it's ruddy sweat distills  The gaping ocean carnage fills  Their host is struck with dire dismay  It's strength of years dissolves away  IV  Copious are the deeds of death  When th' Helsingians yield their breath  Our stern command the vengeful goad  They rush t'ward Odin's deep abode  The Vistula beheld our course  Our navy stemm'd it's rapid force  Nought from the biting sword could save  One wound extensive glow'd the wave  It's shores the reeking current dyed  Our falchions mock'd their armour's pride  With echoing voices roar'd amain  And cleft their stubborn shields in twain  V  No warrior droop'd no warrior fled  Till on the deck Heraudus bled  A bolder Baron thro the main  Ne'er strove the distant port to gain  A bolder Baron on the tide  Ne'er saw his ships of battle ride  His heart impell'd by conscious might  With eager transport sought the fight  VI  Their shields aside each warrior threw  The spear on rapid pinion flew  Heroes it's deadly speed confest  It quiver'd in the dauntless breast  With hunger keen the trenchant sword  Wide the Scarfian rocks engored  His shield became of purple grain  E'er Rafno fell the king of men  Warm flow'd the sweat from every head  It's streams o'er every cuirass spread  VII  Round th' Indirian isles that day  The crows were surfeited with prey  Inglutted stood the ravenous beast  For full and plenteous was the feast  All fought as one no single name  Claim'd the distinguish'd mark of fame  When first appear'd day's flaming star  I saw the piercing darts of war  The barbed arrows took their flight  When first he streak'd the east with light  VIII  Our swords loudbellow'd o'er the slain  Till Eislin fell on Laneo's plain  Thence enrich'd with golden spoil  War to our routed foemen's soil  We bring where helmets throng'd the field  The falchion cut the pictured shield  Their necks deeppierced with must abound  It flows their cloven brains around  IX  Drench'd in blood our shields we rear  The oil of blood anoints our spear  In the Boringholmian bay  Making it's quick tempestuous way  The cloud of darts was onward borne  Our targets were in sunder torn  The bows their iron shower expell  In the fierce conflict Volnir fell  No king on earth could him exceed  In valour and heroic deed  Wide o'er the land the slaughter'd lay  The howling beasts embraced their prey  X  The battle raged with heighten'd lust  Ere princely Freyer bit the dust  His breastplate's golden mail of yore  The hard blue sword insteep'd in gore  Conflicting with our warrior host  Had hewn upon the Flandrian coast  The virgin struck with woe appears  When she that morning's carnage hears  A copious banquet we had given  To the fierce wolf and birds of heaven  XI  Gasping in death these eyes survey'd  An hundred times an hundred laid  In haste we sail'd a dreadful band  To combat on Aenglane's land  Six following days the rising sun  Beheld the strife of swords begun  And six succeedings evenings close  Till prostrate fall our vanquish'd foes  Urged by our steel to sink in fight  Valdiofur confess'd it's might  XII  The rain of blood our falchions pour  It smokes on Bardafyrde's shore  Doom'd to the hawks a pallid croud  The murmuring string was twang'd aloud  Then where in Odin's deathful fight  The greedy sword with eager bite  Devour'd the cuirass there the bow  The casque the morion swiftly flow  The bow with poison sharp to wound  With sanguine sweat besprinkled round  XIII  The sport of war intent to try  We rear our magic shields on high  In Hiadningia's echoing bay  First began th' heroic play  The vengeful swords whirl'd o'er the main  Their strongknit bucklers tear in twain  With mingled clash our arms resound  The helms of men to dust are ground  Not with more transport by his side  The lover clasps his beauteous bride  XIV  The thickraised storm our shields defy  In Northumbria's land they lye  Their gory carcases bestrew  The soil and taint the morning dew  Routed they fled with wild dismay  Their boasted warriors dared not stay  Where the sword with grim delight  Their helmet's polish'd plains would bite  The genial bed such rapture warms  Blest with the youthful widow's charms  XV  Herthiofe escaped our force  And widely sped his prosperous course  Where with rude rocks against the skies  The southern Orcades arise  While He who gave us to display  And shine in victory's bright array  Rogvald our glory and our pride  Compell'd by fate's stern mandate died  Plunged in the storm of arms He fell  Then mourn'd the Hawks with shrieking yell  For dreadful in the sport of war  The darts of blood He hurl'd afar  The sword of blood He well could wield  The shatter'd helms bestrew'd the field  XVI  Heaps piled on heaps the warriors lye  The hawk looks down with joyous eye  The pastime sees and clotted gore  Envying the eagle nor the boar  Together rush the shield and sword  Then fell Irlandia's haughty Lord  Marstan He floats in Vedra's bay  The hungry Raven's destined prey  XVII  Amid the weapon's strifeful scorn  Many a Hero in the morn  Of life and glory press'd the plain  My Son mature in fame was slain  Ripe in renown the dust He prest  The griding falchion rived his breast  By Egill dauntless Agner dies  He rends his arms the victor's prize  In Hamdus' corselet sounds the lance  Red lightnings from the standards glance  XVIII  Sparing of words the brave I view  Their foes they prodigally slew  Thrown to the wolves th' Endilian flood  For seven whole days was stain'd with blood  So looks the wine our handmaids bear  Died deep th' impurpled ships appear  The falchion raging mid th' alarms  And hoarse tumultuous din of arms  Gash'd many a mailed cuirass bright  In Scioldungia's fatal fight  XIX  I saw the widow's darling joy  I saw the virgin's fairhair'd boy  Saw them in morning beauty gay  Saw set in death their youthful ray  Warm with many a glowing stream  Ila's ruddy billows gleam  As by circling Nymphs supplied  The fervid bath in copious tide  From the vine's nectareous hoard  Floats around the social board  Ere Orn expired with frequent stroke  I saw his bloodstain'd buckler broke  By strong necessity controul'd  Inverted life forsakes the bold  XX  The game of slaughtering swords we haste  Where Lind frowns o'er the watery waste  With three contending Kings to try  How few escape rejoiced to fly  The wild beasts gnarring throng the strand  The hawk and wolf commingled stand  Tear them with goading hunger's fire  Nor till with carnage cramm'd retire  While fierce we smote th' Hybernian's blood  With copious torrents swell'd the flood  XXI  The steel's sharp fang and bite severe  The buckler proved the whizzing spear  Speeding to it's direction true  The breastplate chafed of golden hue  Onlugs will mark for many an age  The traces of that battle's rage  There march'd the Kings with eager feet  Intent the sport of swords to meet  The crimson'd isle on all it's coast  Saw the red foaming billows tost  Ar from the desperate fight rebounds  A flying dragon full of wounds  XXII  The brave with ardour yield their breath  Nor heed the sure approach of death  The thought of death their bosom warms▪  They meet it in the storm of arms  He oft deplores this fickle state  Who never dared the frowns of fate  Lured by the check of pallid fear  The joyful eagle hovers near  The coward to himself a pest  Forbids the shield to guard his breast  XXIII  This I establish just and right  That hurrying on to closest fight  Youth against youth with fervent heat  Should rush nor man from man retreat  Long time was this the Hero's pride  And all who by the virgin's side  Aspire to lye and taste her charms  Should nobly stem the roar of arms  XXIV  Doubtless the fates our actions lead  Beyond their limits none can tread  Little of yore did I foresee  That  lla would my death decree  When halfexpiring with my wound  Anxious I threw my garb around  Conceal'd it from the warrior train  And launch'd my vessels on the main  Then over all the Scotian flood  We gave the beasts of prey their food  XXV  Hence springing in my thoughtful mind  A neverfailing joy I find  For well I know superbly graced  For me the lofty seat is placed  For me the generous mead shall foam  In father Balder's festal dome  From goblets pour'd it's copious tide  By skulls of recreant foes supplied  The brave shall ne'er lament their death  In Odin's splendid courts beneath  No clamours vain I thither bear  No sickly murmurs of despair  XXVI  Aslauga's Sons would soon draw nigh  With utmost swiftness hither fly  And arm'd with falchions gleaming bright  Prepare the bitter deeds of fight  If told or could they but divine  What woe what dire mischance is mine  How many serpents round me hang  And tear my flesh with poisonous fang  A mother to my sons I gave  With native worth who stamp'd them brave  XXVII  Fast to th' hereditary end  To my allotted goal I tend  Fixt is the viper's mortal harm  Within my heart his mansion warm  In the recesses of my breast  The writhing snake hath form'd his nest  Yet Odin may in vengeance spread  The bloody scourge o'er Ella's head  My Son's fierce anger at the tale  Shall change to red from deadly pale  The fiery youths at my decease  Shall starting shun the seat of peace  XXVIII  Full fifty times I trod the field  My standard rear'd and poised my shield  War's willing guest nor deem'd the force  Of human hand would check my course  Panting to gain a matchless name  And soar o'er every King in fame  For well in earliest years I taught  My sword to drink the crimson draught  The Sisters now my steps invite  Unmoved I quit the realms of light  XXIX  Warn'd from withinbreak off the lay  Th' inviting Sisters chide my stay  By Odin sent I hear their call  They bid me to his festal hall  With them highthron'd the circling bowl  Of foaming mead shall cheer my soul  With joy I yield my vital breath  And laugh in the last pangs of death  ODE  ENVY  I  WHEN in Creation's early morn  Merit Virtue's child was born  Malevolence and bloated Pride  With hostile frown her beauties spied  In a darkling glen where grew  No other tree but noxious yew  No trace was mark'd of cheerful green  They by fated union led  Press'd their baneful nuptial bed  And Envy rose to light their progeny obscene  II  Her birth the Furies hail with joy  For her their utmost cares employ  O'er her limbs and on her head  Stygian venom copious shed  Give her blooddrencht robes to wear  Steel her heart to pity's tear  Arm her tongue with falshood's stings  Muttering spells imbue her breath  With vapours from the cave of death  Plume with revenge her crest with terror imp her wings  III  Forth She flies with direful rage  Immortal war prepared to wage  Where'er with wreathe celestial crown'd  Haply Merit may be found  Nature views her course aghast  Sudden struck with sickening blast  The verdant plants and blooming flowers  Their heads decline the fruits decay  The feather'd songsters cease their lay  And glory's laurels shrink and beauty's roseate bowers  IV  Offspring of Heaven's dread King alone  Firm assessor of his throne  Truth the spreading ruin spies  Glowing with indignant eyes  In radiant panoply draws near  In her hands the shield and spear  Gift of allo'erruling Jove  When She first assay'd her might  In the fierce Titanic fight  And down to lowest hell the base Pretenders drove  V  She o'er Merit lifts her shield  Yield thou Fiend O Envy yield  Pierced She falls again to rise  Rancorous Envy never dies  Truth disclaims her warrior art  But implants in Merit's heart  Breathing fortitude divine  Conscious Honour undismay'd  Stands the selfprotected maid  Thro all her frame within unclouded glories shine  VI  To Greece my varying notes belong  Exhaustless fount of sacred song  Transfixt by Phoebus' orient beam  Tho Python fell by Nilus' stream  In Lerne's marsh the Hydra stood  Till by Alcides' might subdued  Yet then survived her latent power  'Twas Envy's poison'd garb he wore  Distain'd with Nessus' fabled gore  Which with severest pangs o'erwhelm'd his dying hour  VII  But genuine Worth each toil o'erpast  Will gain th' Olympian dome at last  Whose path thro life with thickwove cloud  The mists of black Avernus shroud  Till Time assists despairing Truth  And weds him to unfading youth  To Fame which lovelier blooms by years▪  The Hebe she in blest abodes  Who pours forth nectar for the Gods  And to their raptured lips the sparkling goblet bears▪  VIII  Perish the Slaves whom no desire  Of her unrivall'd charms can fire  Whom Envy's threatening voice dismays  Far from the haunts which lead to praise  Whom Calumny forbids to rise  Who dare not view the distant skies  Who abject on life's transient day  For all their sum of good rely  Flattery's vain breath gold's vainer ray  The gawds of futile pomp and nauseous pageantry  IX  Had not untired th' heroic soul  With Envy struggling reach'd the goal  No Bard had tuned the deathless strain  No Patriot crush'd a Tyrant's reign  By wisdom taught with generous mind  No Sage had civilized mankind  Blank lethargy had still prevail'd  If piercing not beyond the tomb  The stedfast sight of Hope had fail'd  To view Renown's pure orb irradiating the gloom  ODE TO CONTENT  I  WHERE stands Content thy mansion pure  The gaudy scenes of power  Tho strew'd with many a flower  Her paths th' unwary guest allure  Odious to thee appear  Thou seest the viper lurking there  II  'Tis thine with grateful look to view  Young morning's blushing cheek  Then quit thy pallat meek  And range the lawn impearl'd with dew  Or from the swelling mound  Survey the verdant landscape round  III  Health t'ward thee comes and smiling greets  Her best her favourite child  While Innocence strays wild  Intent to cull the verdant sweets  A beauteous wreathe to twine  And deck thy placid brow divine  IV  O Nymph serene where'er I rove  Do Thou above my head  Thy hand propitious spread  o care and sullen grief shall prove  Too powerless to annoy  Nor blast the waving crest of joy  V  So tho by wayward fortune driven  To mingle with the train  Fantastic base and vain  Thou shalt be near Elect of Heaven  To soothe life's pointed sting  And shield me with thy peaceful wing  ODE TO VENGEANCE  I  O Sprung from Heaven's immortal Sire  From whose stern eye the living fire  Darts thrillant horror when thy hand  Hurls the dread bolt at his command  Whose plagues transfix the guilty crew  Whom mid the secret haunts of night  Or flying on with wild affright  Thy eager steps pursue  II  Tho better pleased majestic Queen  To sit with aweful brow serene  To sit and bend thy listening ear  To Innocence thy loved Compeer  Or round her trembling form to spread  Thy plumed wing upon thy breast  To bid her lull her fears to rest  And lay her sacred head  III  Conscious of thee when all alone  Or seated on his splendid throne  The Tyrant's cheek grows pale He hears  A nation's groan invade his ears  Th' ideal dagger He espies  With thick short gasp He draws his breath  And knowing He deserves his death  Each hour in fancy dies  IV  Say hast Thou left th' ethereal height  I see thee thro the clouds of night  Beneath the yew tree's mournful gloom  Hanging o'er yonder newraised tomb  Attentive to the Father's prayer  Who there laments th' illfated maid  By oaths of perjured lust betray'd  A victim to despair  V  He calls on Thee Oh steel his nerves  Only thy potent aid preserves  Him too from death Bring face to face  Him and the cause of his disgrace  Oh give him force or righteous art  Give what the partial law denies  Ere He of grief or frenzy dies  To stab th' Assassin's heart  VI  To thee the Generous and the Good  Yield homage precious is the food  By thee to the great soul supplied  When pondering deep with virtuous pride  O'er heartfelt wrongs his innate worth  No sigh affords but on his prey  From the dark den at close of day  The Lion rushes forth  VII  Tremble ye Base affect to scorn  The man with nobler passions born  Who drinks not of your bigot draught  But know that while with justice fraught  He dares excite the blackwing'd storm  Know that the meansoul'd injuries  He dares with vigour to chastise  He never dares perform  ODE  The DEATH of HAROLD  FLY ye Base at William's call  Abject seek his crouded hall  Thyra weeps her Harold slain  Who with Thyra dares remain  Beauteous Editha is there  With neck of swan and raven hair  Mangled by the spear and sword  Well She knew her muchloved Lord  Stripp'd amid the vulgar crew  She her muchlov'd Harold knew  Waltham sees his tomb arise  Waltham marks her echoing sighs  Down her cheeks the pearly tear  Drops from sorrow's spring sincere  Who with her will mourn the slain  Who with misery dares remain  Near her generous Algar stands  He detests the selfish bands  Slaves who when misfortune lowers  Fly to pleasure's rosy bowers  Minstrel He of liberal soul  Oft had tasted Harold's bowl  In the Abbey's darkling cells  Now with her and Thyra dwells  Pour thy praises on his herse  Pour for him th' emphatic verse  Let the strain of music flow  Soothe a Wife's a Mother's woe  O'er the harp his fingers stray  Thus the Bard attunes his lay  While the Sun enthroned on high  Matchless ruler of the sky  Shakes his radiant locks unbound  Darting streams of brightness round  While the purest rays are shed  On our Harold's sacred head  While beneath his feet arise  Flowerets of a thousand dies  While the laurel shades his brow  While his willing subjects bow  Proud his mandates to obey  Freedom join'd with kingly sway  Why those mists of pitchy night  Rolling horrid to my sight  Why with dreadful force upsprings  The gloomy storm on Dragon wings  From yonder coast the clouds ascend  Hither hither lo they bend  Wreathe involving wreathe they sweep  Aweful o'er the groaning deep  Widedisclosed at once their womb  Navies numerous navies come  Fraught with war with fury dire  Treachery close and raging ire  Shouts and clashing arms I hear  Shrilling trumpets pierce my ear  Lances bristling thick I view  Swords and bows of toughest yew  Warriors samed for prowest deeds  Spearmen bold and fiery steeds  Fierce with hope with grasping mind  Europe's various realms combined  Speed their Legions o'er the sea  This devoted Isle their prey  Who directs the battle's tide  Norman William's lawless pride  Oh holy Father could'st Thou see  How ill his thoughts and words agree  His murmuring conscience could'st Thou hear  Did his treason dark appear  Thy standard would not

The flaming falchion high to wield  And litigate th' uncertain field  The Norman trembles thus to view  The cloud distent with sanguine dew  The tempest fraught with death He dreads  Terrific gathering o'er their heads  I saw the barbed arrows fly  Innumerous thro the darken'd sky  The closer war He dared not wage  Nor tempt again the Lion's rage  Curst be the Bender of the bow  Which laid undaunted Harold low  And curst the shaft athirst for blood  Which slew the young the brave the good  With him I saw extinct her fire  Deepwounded Liberty expire  I saw th' Usurper's rigid smile

progeny of hell  Each Shade obscene which wants a name  The Moat which burns with sulphurous flame  VI  Now  Odin  's regal form behold  His beaming arms and throne of gold  The vivid lightnings round him play  His potent voice sorbids dismay  Sudden the  runic rhyme  I hear  And orgies of th' enfrenzied Seer  His strains prophetic nerve the soul  The tides of war tumultuous roll  VII  Rapt to  Biarmia  's freezing skies  What new portentous visions rise  Valdandi Skulda  burst the ground  The icy pillars tremble round  In Arthur's shape and burnisht mail  Aloft impetuous on the gale  The  cloudform'd car  their Hero bears  His bosom every terror dares  VIII  What  beauteous Maid  in purest white  Now steals upon my ravisht sight  Her brow with golden wreathe entwined  Her tresses floating on the wind  'Tis  Inogen  with joy and love  Resound the bowers and vocal grove  Ambrosial blossoms deck each spray  The streams o'er lucid marble play  IX  Deaf to the tones of modern art  To song like this I ope my heart  And tho abstracted from the Muse  Cannot the Lyric Note refuse  For as I read th' enchantment thrills  And every sense with pleasure fills  Or in attention fixt I stand  As struck by  Merlin  's powerful wand  ODE  To LIEUT COL SIMCOE  I  THO hovering o'er the fatal plains  Where Civil Slaughter grimly reigns  Her face celestial Glory shrouds  Wrapt in a veil of circling clouds  Yet Simcoe in her airy flight  Piercing the gloom with eye benign▪  On thee She beam'd a ray of light  Gilding the laurel which around  Thy youthful forehead Valour bound  And darted thro thy breast her energy divine  II  Tho with the classic story fired  Not such the fields thy soul desired  Not such the Grecian standard shone  With patriot blaze at Marathon  Not thus Plataea's trophies rose  Brightdazzling to remotest times  Tho destined with fraternal foes  Necessity's dire war to wage  While kindred bosoms mutual rage  And wrathful Heaven impell'd in vengeance for our crimes  III  Tho Britain sunk an helpless prey  To Discord's mean and selfish sway  Which quench'd with indecorous strife  The fostering breath of public life  Mid scenes where active warmth was chain'd  Th' unsteady line where error drew  Where indolence the sword restrain'd  And counsels weak invited shame  Applausive Honour hail'd thy name  And Justice listening stood and own'd her praises true  IV  For thine was Bravery's nervous deed  And enterprize with fiery speed  By unimpassion'd calmness taught  Nor stain'd by one ferocious thought  America beheld with awe  Thy march for rapid fight design'd  Eluding e'en her vaunted art  Yet could esteem thy liberal heart  And victory's proudest gem thy warmlyfeeling mind  V  Had'st thou in Britain's vigorous morn  To wars of other climes been born  When Marlborough with resistless force  Sped t'ward th' affrighted Seine his course  Or in her noonday hour elate  When Ferdinand with conscious might  Held at his will the Gallic fate  Thy garlands might have bloom'd more fair  Cherisht by th' uninvidious air  But not in reason's eye and fixt impartial sight  VI  While from her pure unruffled seat  Passion and prejudice retreat  The Bard who shuddering heard th' alarms  When first th' Atlantic gleam'd with arms  With horror saw the madd'ning Croud  Indignant heard their clamorous sound  The sword coercive urging loud  Can military worth survey  And dare distinguish in his lay  Nor shuns selecting thee the bloodimpurpled ground  VII  The Son of peace shall pour for thee  His numbers but from warfare free  Hold not Thou dalliance with the Muse  Her tempting blandishments refuse  Nor sit in ease or languor down  Where towers the beech or oak on high  On Fancy's wreathe insidious frown  Contemning Party's abject train  The Senate's dome aspire to gain  And watchful o'er the state each inbred pest defy  VIII  Those magic arms again be sought  Which erst thy admiration caught  Those arms which like a pointed spear  Aemathia's Tyrant struck with fear  Those arms which Anthony dismay'd  Than the bright falchion's edge more keen  Thus bold Prerogative invade  The Democratic host oppose  And banded Great if freedom's foes  Beneath the mimic mask they hope to skulk unseen  IX  Thus while tumultuous Factions strive  May patriot ardour still survive  The scepter'd laws alone command  Their power unviolated stand  May Liberty and generous Fame  No sordid shackles e'er controul  Essential Beings not a name  Oh may a civic crown be thine  It's lustre undiminisht shine  And thy own thoughts approve thy independent soul  X  So worshipt from thy early youth  Integrity and spotless Truth  Shall mark thy firm consistent plan  And more than Hero stamp thee Man  When fades war's emulative fire  With strong enthusiastic glow  With all the fervour of desire  Thy country viewing may thy mind  No sad reverse of passion find  Nor for ideal good the solid bliss sorego  ODE TO LORD HOOD  I  WHILE with undaunted soul afar  The Hero meets the storm of war  While braving it's terrific bands  His native coast unshaken stands  Shall not beneath the myrtle bowers  Where Leisure sheds her balmy showers  Science and Eloquence combine  The wreathe of fragrant praise to twine  Shall not the Muses tune their sweetest song  And Gratitude with joy the choral notes prolong  II  Nor Thou O Hood disdain the lyre  Enkindler of the Poet's fire  When Greece beheld in days of old  Crown'd with success her warriors bold▪  When Rome with gladsome shouts survey'd  Her Sons in victory array'd  Surpassing every trophy won  The golden verse smoothpolisht shone  The splendid triumph moved ungraced and vain  If Rapture prompted not the warm enthusiast strain  III  Nor shall th' harmonious meed of fame  On thee corrival of their name  Be unbestow'd For liberal choice  Not party's interested voice  The Bard directs who scorns to wrest  The plumage from another's crest  T' embellish thine nor t'ward the goal  Of glory opening to thy soul  Would so depress thy own elastic force  Impede thy vigorous aim and free unsullied course  IV  These boast perchance impetuous might  And Those consummate skill in fight  In both transcendent where around  Yon waving sweets o'ershade the ground  Where high yon verdant palms arise  Bending on thee his conscious eyes  The Antillean Genius smiles  And owns amid his clustering isles  No Chief superior conduct e'er display'd  Or adverse hosts arranged with braver deeds dismay'd  V  While on her cheeks the blush is spread  While low she stoops her baffled head  To thee reluctant Gallia pays  The tribute of extorted praise  Destined her numbers to deride  At will to pass repass the tide  Securely gain the sheltering bay  Securely cross the liquid way  Check her ambitious wings her hopes repell  And arm'd in sure defence her dreams of empire quell  VI  When changed from friends to bitterest foes  Britannia's progeny arose  When Belgia when Iberia lower'd  When France her force collected pour'd  When all the Naval World conspired  By Russia's treacherous counsels fired  When Faction on her vitals prey'd  To thee thy Country look'd for aid  Nor didst thou fail in her afflicted hour  To prove with guardian arm th' extent of human power  VII  Envy may strive to wound thy heart  But blunted is her venom'd dart  Which takes its ineffectual flight  Opposed by Virtue's armour bright  Oh listening to her voice divine  Upon the lap of peace recline  Whose olive ne'er so rich is seen  As when adorned with laurels green  There by reflection blest without alloy  Each merited reward each just acclaim enjoy  VIII  Transmitting to thy Race above  All titles all a Monarch's love  Whatever wealth or power can boast  Or earthborn grandeur values most  Pure honour valour's ardent flame  And the true Patriot's real name  While History's pen from age to age  Recording in her sacred page  The last of Britons thy renown shall save  Among th' illustrious few from cold obliviou's grave  IX  And e'en the Land which saw with fear  Thy sails and crimson flag appear  Which struggling with her Parent State  Hath but obey'd the will of fate  Shall point thee out to future times  When issuing from unwonted climes  New Fleets shall throng th' Atlantic plain  Comtemning Europe's old domain  Shall bid her Heroes thy example see  Form the sagacious plan and rule the war like Thee  THE LAND OF▪ THE MUSES  A POEM in the Manner of SPENSER  This Poem is reprinted in it's original form to comply with a suggestion that some Readers might be better pleased or with to compare it with the altered Copy  THE LAND OF THE MUSES  A POEM in the Manner of SPENSER  As if to be inserted in the Second Book of the FAIRY QUEEN between the Eleventh and Twelfth Cantos  ARGUMENT  The  Prince  nigh cured of mortal stowers  Alma  to entertain  Shows him  Dan Phoebus▪  magick bowers  Where the  Nine Ladies  reign  I  FOOLS they who vainly ween that  Temperaunce  Her joyous sweet amenities denies  To human kind or looks with sight ascaunce  Whan they with liberal delights devise  Their ears to feed or gratify their eyes  Nothing she bids witholden that behoves  Him to ensue who nould be dempt unwise  All sports and rational pleasaunce she loves  But hateth idle  Lust  who ay at random roves  II  When as the  Prince  by fairest  Alma  's care  Was nigh recured of his woundez sore  Which he in hardy conflict had whilee'er  Endur'd as gainst thilke felon arms he bare  But him subdued withouten sword or spear  As prudent Leaches all in this agree  That mind and body are conjoined near  Ne one without the other can be free  She bent her thought to keep his mind in goodly gree  III  So seated by his side unto his ear  She framed her discourse in words most meet  At times of chevisaunce and warlike geer  And warrior knights who underneath their feet  Did trample death immortal fame to greet  Tho sagely would she change her talk and ply  His list'ning sense with speech so honey'd sweet  And moral thews of wise philosophy  That he was rapt and inly ravished thereby  IV  And ever and anon wou'd  PraiseDesire  Open her rubin lips and featly sing  Her pensive notes but such as mought inspire  Calm moods of tranquil stedfastness and bring  To truest test and justest tempering  Ye would have sworn one of the heav'nly throng  Was slid to earth upon melodious wing  Sich silver sounds weft the mild air along  And sich the blandishment of her slowditted song  V  And eke  Shamefacedness  with mellow lute  Her strains harmonious accompanied  For she her instrument full well could suit  Ne wanted in welldoing comely pride  The Prince his secret pleasure ne mought hide  But smit with love of glorious emprise  Felt his spright mov'd past utterance and sigh'd  The living fire flasht from his gazing eyes  And drench'd in bliss unknown to vulgar soul he lies  VI  It chaunced out one evening as these sour  Did walk by thilke same river's winding side  From whence Sir  Guyon  launch'd which there did pour  His bounteous stream watering the country wide  The  Prince  the coast which them opposed spied  Woods and fair hills in beautiful array  And lawns which now the setting Phoebus eyed  Beaming the  ast remains of golden day  He saw and ask'd what land that was which yonder lay  VII  That is the land the gentlest  Alma  said▪  In which  Apollo  and the  Muses  dwell  On which their blessings with great bountihed  They cast abroad there by the living well  Of  Hippocrene  they fix their happy sell  There wonne at distaunce from the profane world  With whose affairs they never mind to mell  Als  Jovisaunce  is there with face unfurl'd  And care and grief and carking pain far off are hurl'd  VIII  And thousand dainty shapes inhabit there  And unimagin'd forms by common mind  To every single one of which a peer  In other place on earth may no man find  Of purest nature and aethereal kind  By the three  Graces  seemingly bedight  For in that realm their girdes the  Graces  bind  And  Liberty  ay sporteth in their sight  And there the  Virtues  stray yrob'd in stoles of white  IX  How may said then the  Prince  a straunger gain  Thilke place which thou descriven hast to see  Perdy most rarely brave is that domain  Ne speak I out of vaunting surquedry  And lofty vain conceit yet is in me  A heart in which good nurture fix'd the thew  And love of seemly liberality  Not as a faytour false or spy I sue  These Bonnibels and fair depeinten Imps to view  X  To me O Briton Prince she said is given  Alma  then smil'd and smil'd those other twain  Free enteraunce into that earth'y heav'n  By young Apollo's self who there doth reign▪  Als he to me hath ordered to restrain  And keepen back by force the rascal rout  Of noisy  Riotise  his drunken train  But never the ingenuous mind to flout  Ne wight of fair demeanour ever shutten out  XI  But now is well nigh time hence to be gone  And supper ended take ourselves to rest  Now wakeful man wends by himself alone  For bird and beast by  Somnus  are yblest  All but the beast of prey which is addrest  To cruel slaughter on the helpless crew  And Philomela who with woe imprest  Her dolorous fate wails in sad measure due  But softer than descent of night's fastfalling dew  XII  Early the morn we will forth yede yfere  And in a gondelay to yonder shore  Across the intervening ferry steer  There on the many delices to pore  Of which 'twere tedious to recount the store  Thanks render'd tho the Prince in manner'd wise  For he was skill'd in every courtly lore  That night did sleep scant close his wakeful eyes  And in the morn he rose with the bright sun's uprise  XIII  Alma  prepared he already found  For never she indulg'd in slothful bed  But when the lark soar'd upward from the ground  She ay wou'd bid adieu to drowsihed  Tho forth they issued from that goodly sted  And in due season to the ferry came  Fast by its brink the gondelay moored  They see and eke the wight who steer'd the same  Of most welllooked mien  GoodCulture  was his name  XIV  The  Knight  and  Lady  he with joy on board  Did take then pushed with strong arm away  And launch'd the vessel far into the ford  Tho he his painted canvas did display  While kind gales in its swelling bosom play  With speed they cut the stream as chrystal clear  Or as the brighteyed Titan's piercing ray  For not the smallest stain or spot was there  But tho the waves were deep the bottom did appear  XV  When as they did that shore approachen near  Girt with the cestus of eternal spring  Its ever virid banks th' ambrosial air  Odours most exquisitely sweet did bring  For  Zephyrus  there ever fann'd his wing  And there did  Flora  plentifully strew  The ground with flowers which fragrance round them fling  Sweetscented flowers of every various hue  That whilom in  Adonis'  happy gardens grew  XVI  Now bin they landed in that pleasaunt place  And now along the lilied shore proceed  Far as their eyne the widestretch'd coast can trace  The blithsome scenery they in silence read  The  Prince  in wonder lost gave fixed heed  At every turn at every turn amaze  Sat on his cheek delightsome awe and dreed  Well might that prospect frailer wight have daz'd  He gaz'd and thought that there he could for ay have gaz'd  XVII  His fair Conductress bade him cast his eyes  To waken him from out his rapturous traunce  To where before the path they took crosswise  Over a velvet meadow did advaunce  Two beings of most pleasing amenaunce  Upon their foreheads gayety did sit  Their joyous girlonds in the wind did daunce  Their cheeks were blooming red their feet were flit  And treading the soft turf did leave no print on it  XVIII  The one yclep'd was  Youth  the down began  His features to aguise with decent pride  Ne mought he older wax ne grow to man  Yet was that other giv'n him for his bride  Of whom he got a son who by his side  Renning in merry mood for ay did smile  Hygeia  did his spouse the name betide  With her he took no note of time the while  It passed by so well each hour she could beguile  XIX  That tender Imp he guided by the hand  With face speaking his heart so airy light  He hath benempt  Content  tho he be scann'd  A boy great power dwelleth with that wight  For whomsoe'er he looketh on his spright  Is with complacence sill'd and jocund glee  An infant babe  Simplicity  behight  The mother bore of lovely hue to see  Stretching his little arms and telling his tale free  XX  Then  Alma  gracefully ybording said  Tell me ye gentle pair if ye have seen  Where widely your enchaunted feet have stray'd  Emong the mazes of this flowery green  Where  Fancy  wonneth now for well I ween  She hath no certain bidingplace of rest  But now the shade she seeketh now the sheen  Now flitteth north now south now east now west  All pleasure she doth love variety the best  XXI  To her with count'nance blithe did  Youth  reply  The words from his quick tongue ydropping fast  If  Fancy  you do seek fair dame perdy  In yonder glen with high rocks overcast  From whence a tumbling torrent forth hath brast  I saw her even now so louting low  He with his bellamour away did haste  Right onward  Alma  and the Prince did go  Then why she  Fancy  sought he fain of her would know  XXII  Without her aid O  Prince  said  Alma  fair  To travel thro this coast were endless stower▪  Ne without her direction would I dare  Convoy thee as behoves a single hour  Besides she builded hath a wond'rous tow'r  Which hence thou seest high in the air ypight  From whence is view'd distinctly dell and bower  And rock and stream and every living wight  And every goodly thing with which these realms are dight▪  XXIII  Unto the which if thee she will convey  In portion small of time she can unfold  What else would take up many a weary day  And many a sleepless night for to behold  Ne ever so at last you prosper would  But after muchell labour and sojourn  Some forest dark your wilder'd feet would hold  Or ye would sink crossing some roaring b ourn  Or to the whence ye came ye idly would return  XXIV  Soon mought they now behold that  Maid divine  Upon a craggy cliff she took her stand  Above her head spread a broad branching pine  Which sent a dark shade round on either hand  Down many a thousand yarde of rising land  From rock to rock a strong stream so c'd its way  Which there was blent in one accoiled band  She joyant stood over the foaming bay  And bath'd her forehead in the floating dewy spray  XXV  When as the tread of stranger feet she heard  Eftsoons her eyes she thitherwards enhaunc'd  Which as the glitterand sunbeam bright appear'd  And quicker than the quivering levin glaunc'd  And strait toward them with light step advaunc'd  Her goldentendrill'd locks down from her head  Hung loosely wav'ring as to them bechaunc'd  She never them confin'd in tye or brede  But they most comely seem'd whan most dishevelled  XXVI  In thin habiliment she was bedight  Of cunningly inwoven goss'mer twin'd  Most curious was that garment to the sight  And on the lap of the soft dalliaunt wind  Which it sustain'd disported far behind  Its colour was of every various dye  Which in the glorious bow of heaven we find  And every intermingled shade the eye  Could ever ken was there in vast complexity  XXVII  In that retired vale oftimes she sate  Where  Nature  strayed wild by  Art  not found  But not therein immewed was her state  Nor yet ypent in any fixed bound  Free and at large she raung'd creation round  Or breaking thro the brazen gyre would steer  Her flight with cheek not blanch'd nor heart astound  The din of  Chaos  and  Confusion  hear  Ne all the everbickering elements would fear  XXVIII  There if she will'd new worldes of her own  She would create and them impeople too  And in the midst upbuild her splendent throne  Exacting from her subjects homage due  Tho in a moment's space these worldes new  And each thing in them would annihilate  Her pregnant will she ever would pursue  For she alone most wond'rous to relate  Except highreigning  God  was uncontroul'd by fate  XXIX  Oft to the heav'n of heav'ns she would ascend  And thro th' impenetrable blaze would try  Boldly her peering vision to extend  And into the mysterious Godhead pry  Where far above the staryflaming sky  His seat is circled deep with glory bright  "In his trinal triplicity  "Trinal triplicity" alludes to the three times three i e nine orders of Angels which were supposed to stand before the throne of God forever praising and magnifying him  on high"  But never could she pass that lustrous light  Highreigning  God  alone escap'd her thrillant sight  XXX  Yet sich her sway that she to earth could bring  From their eternal steds  Angelic Quires  Who round about her gently hovering  Tun'd at her will their goldenstringed lyres  Or maugre dernful  Pluto  's grisly fires  Would cleave the earth and rowse to upper air  The  Furies  with their whips of iron wires  And snakes loud hissing in their troubled hair  And  Hecate  at her call would her dread front uprear  XXXI  With them all ills would rise that shun the light  Sternlook'd  Revenge Hate  by wild frenzy torn  And each abhorred child of ugly  Night  Lust  ever restless  Jealousy  o'erworn  Mean  Murder  of each generous mind the scorn  And pining  Care  which in her sickly plume  Inshrouds while yet aliv  the wretch forlorn  And  Woe  whose heart by inches does consume  Hanging with face all pale o'er her dead lovers tomb  XXXII  And she would call th' unbodied  Ghosts  around  With shrieking note utt'ring their dolorous wail  And  Witchcraft  mumbling forth her rites profound  Might make the stoutest living wight to quail  And conscious  Fear  who secretly doth steal  Keeping close watch beside the murderer's bed  And when  Sleep  gins his tired lids to veil  And wrap the poppied pursle o'er his head  Rings her alarum wild and rends his soul with dread  XXXIII  Yet nothing was there fearful in her face  Or terrible to the beholders view  But in her was an amiable grace  A lovely and a modest blushing hue  Which mingled with respect love's passion drew  And winning smiles her features freed from scorn  And ye might read her straying veins quite through  Her alabaster skin and so adorn  She looked like the eldest daughter of the  Morn  XXXIV  Now she the gentlest  Alma  first addrest  Welcome fair virgin to these blissful bowers  Then tenderly did clasp her to her breast  And hail to thee  Sir Knight  can aught the pow'rs  Who here inherit aught the winged  Hours  The  Graces  and the  Virtues  thee to please  For thee to please belov'd of heaven no stow'rs  They would refuse  Apollo  's self would seize  Th' occasion and myself thy servant am always  XXXV  O passing fair  Alma  to her replied  This gentle  Knight  the  Knight  full low did bend  No Impe of  Riotise  or boastful  Pride  I to thy favour strenuously commend  My strong deliverer and stedsast friend  O bear him to thy tow'r ypight on high  Or with him through these dainty regions wend  That he the d  ft inhabitants may sp    And feed with wonderment his knowledgesearching eye  XXXVI  She answer'd not but with most sweet aspect  Taking the Prince and Lady by the honde  Eftsoons she did them from the ground erect  And thro the air swift as the LevinBronde  Or if than it can swifter thing be conn'd  Darted upright ne did she stop ne stay  Till on her lofty espial they did stonde  Whence they the girding heavens might survev  And earth and occan wide which low unneath them lay  XXXVII  It was a noble work for to behold  For neither was it built of stone ne lime  Ne was there ir'n ne brass ne lead ne gold  Ne  Roman  cement ne  Asphaltile  slime  To bind the parts and knit withouten rime  But it was all one piece of lucent glass  And edifyed by her in shortest time  Yet though both thin and seeming frail it was  No work on earth could it in lastingness surpass  XXXVIII  With rare imagin'd portraicts it was strow'd  Landscapes and histories by her design'd  For  what  she saw when raunging far abroad  She took her flight and left thilke tow'r behind  That  from the store house of her heedful mind  She would display before a painter fair  Who every form with skilful hand defin'd  And fetisely bedight with colours rare  Description  was her name a virgin debonair  XXXIX  Her pencil was most delicately fine  And light and strong the sketches which it drew  And beautifully did her colours shine  For the clouds chequer'd tints she in them threw  And the first drops of pearly morning dew  Aurora  's blush too when she first did wake  From  Venus'  smiles from  Cynthia  's silver hue  From  Flora  's mantle from the greensea lake  And all Dame  Nature  's works she did her colours take  XL  A reverend  Eld  the palette there did hold  And every colour set in proper place  His piersent eye his perfect senses told  The wrinkles did become his auntient face  And eke his hoary beard hung down with grace  Judgement  he hight his precept she obey'd  For he could teach her every stroke to trace  Full many a time her youthful hand he stay'd  When wantonly or when thro' carelessness it stray'd  XLI  The  Briton Prince  with curious regard  The labours of these busied twain did see  Till  Fancy  calling him away debarr'd  His eyne intent on that imagery  Forthwith to her his step he hasted free  Tho he and  Alma  seated by her side  On a high battlement's extremity  She wav'd her hand then bid them throwen wide  Their looks toward the right and see the country's pride  XLII  They looked and beheld a country rare  The laughing meadows were with flow'rs bespread  The rose their shining Queen the lily fair  The cowslip drooping down his fainting head  The pink and tulip gay embroidered  Daisies and violets and all the crew  Which sweet impunging smells odorous bred  Or  Nature  with bright staines did imbrue  There 'sdaining touch of  Art  uncultivated grew  XLIII  And here and there did murm'ring rivers stray  Flowing entrailed in meanders clear  Now all so smoothly making gentle way  With dimpling surface that though placed near  The swain their progress onward ne mought hear▪  Now broke by mossy stones did hoarsly brawl  And prisoner took the willing thralled ear  Or bounding o'er a ragged rocky wall  From rift to rift in many a cascade did fall  XLIV  And up and down were many tufty groves  Lifting their heads in glory flourishing  Around whose trunks the honeysuckle roves  And scented jessamine is wandering  And purple grapes hung thickly clustering  And thousand thousand feather'd songsters lay  Concealed and melodiously did sing  While every bough and every treeen spray  Wav'd their consenting leaves and gladlier seem'd to play  XLV  And on the flowery meads and plains they spy▪  Fair flocks of sheep nibbling the tender green  Or ruminating as adown they lye  Or wanton sporting in the sunny sheen  And where or rock or rising hill is seen  The frisking goats their antick gambols made  And jolly keepers both did keep from teen  Who in the open sun or secret shade  Tuning uneven pipes their amorous descants play'd  XLVI  Soon did they see where from a grove issued  The goatfoot  Pan  playing a merry fit  Pleasaunt it was but rather rustic rude  Him follow'd dancing trimly to that dit  A croud of  Fawns  and  Satyrs  who with flit  And active giambeaux beat the hollow ground  While with them hand in hand their partners knit  The looselyrobed  Dryades  rebound  Their hair with oaken wreaths and palm and ivy crown'd  XLVII  They passed on and next most pleasing sight  The  God of Love  borne on a gentle lamb  Not he who armed dire by savage  Spite  And taught those cursed arts which sure I am  Have with disgraces shent his cruel  Dam  And als himself and crouds of wretches slain  With whose sad carcases the grave to cram  And crouds of wretches who alive remain  Have mur'd up with  Despair  and evergnarring  Pain  XLVIII  This  Winged Boy  a gentle mind did bear  As gentle as the beast which him upbore  Ne could he see th' unhappy drop a tear  But it would make his breast with pity sore  And he himself would weep and grieve therefore  He was not blind and from his looks did fly  The horrid face of  Lust  emboss'd with gore  And groveling mean  Deceit  and  Calumny  And by his side did wonne the maid  Sincerity  XLIX  Before her breast she bore a chrystal vase  In which her inmost thoughts were all pourtray'd  That ye each hidden sentiment mought trace  With this she oft hath  Villainy  warray'd  And made him stooping hide his felon head  Guarded with this she fears no secret harms  But walks secure as tho she were array'd  In strong defence by force of magick charms  Or girded firm with coat of mail and scaled arms  L  On t'other side holding a rosy band  With which that lamb she guided in the way▪  Or when his rider list him still to stand  Did softly check his pace and mildly sway  Wended fair  Innocence  her to survey  The angels would from heav'n on balmy wing  Gliding in mortal air their limbs embay  In t'other hand a serpent with fell sting  She held which lick'd her face ne any scathe did bring  LI  The next a nymph her countenaunce display'd  Blithe was her look unequal was her air  Her lineaments mought no one ever read  Ne yet the colour of her garb declare  Both of them every moment chaunging were  That fickle nymph had  Novelty  to name  Of  Admiration  she the loved feare  Her frequent chaunge did his light heart inflàme  And looking on her greedily he onward came  LII  Behind them one twisting with all his might  A skein of silk which in his hand he bore  Yet tho he alway strained it full tight  No single thread would yield or break therefore  A swain who  Friendship  hight in human lore  And by his side another goodly swain  Call'd  SansSelflove  of mind most firm and sure▪  For he that other to secure from pain  Would naked rush on spears or plunge into the main  LIII  And now advanc'd the wight whom first they met  And with her babe that spouse so fair to see  To him full firmly bound in wedlock's net  And eke that other pledge of mutual gree  And close behind was virgin  Chastity  Bearing in her cold hands a lump of snow  Which though the warm west winds around her flee  Received no impuritie or flaw  Ne ever lost its white ne ever would it thaw  LIV  Long time she had betrothed bin I ween  Unto a comely youth of mickle praise  Fidelity  full steady was his mien  His eyes on her engrafted were always  Yet sich their look they ne mought her displease  This hand a golden sunflower did sustain  Still turning to the sun her constant rays  That a cameleon in a diamond chain  Which him in's native hue for ever did restrain  LV  And many more whom time to tell would fail  The  Prince  and  Alma  from their airy height  Might see with thilke same bevy fair to fail  There passed by the sister  Graces  bright  And  Liberty  unveil'd her peerless light  Benevolence  and  Gratitude  ysere  Beauty  all over lovely to the sight  There heartfelt  Ease  and  Leisure  ever dear  And happy  Indolence  and  Peace  brought up the rear  LVI  Then  Fancy  wav'd her hand but oh how strange  What at that potent motion ensued  Alack a day how sudden was the change  Black was the sky the blust'ring wind blew rude  Instead of company was solitude  Instead of gladsome sights a doleful glade  In which no chearful vision might intrude  For luckless Plaint as it beseemed made  Ah woe is me so soon all human glories fade  LVII  Forth came an hundred  Nymphs  with solemn tread  And flaming tedes in hand and then a  Queen  As seemed by the crown upon her head  Of beaten gold and her right royal mien  Her eyes with aweful dignity gave sheen  Her crimson vestment flow'd in stately pride  Which likest Scythian  Tomyr  was seen  When stain'd with Persian blood she  Cyrus  eyed  Or bold  Boud  a  when in Roman slaughter died  LVIII  Her left hand held a bowl with poison fraught  Which working quick dispatch was sure to kill  Her right a dreadful dagger sharply wrought  Which to the wight who list his blood to spill  She gave and bade him execute his will  Or if the bowl he chose to end his days  She stoop'd it down and told him drink his fill  Impurpled buskins on her legs she wore  Which with a golden clasp yclasped were before  LIX  Behind her was a wretch with garments rent  Hollow his cheeks and pale his dreary face  He mov'd as tho with weakness all forespent  Yet not uncomely was his weary pace  And his eyes gleamed with a languid grace  Misfortune  hight him in a brazen chain  Adversity  most cruelly did brace  And tho he seemed faint and well nigh slain  She nould him ever spare but dragg'd him on amain  LX  And ever and anon her arm on high  She would uplift which with an iron whip  Adaw'd and scowl on him with threat'ning eye  And oftimes would his cloaths with fury strip  And to the bones the skin therewith would rip  That he poor man would miserably groan  Yet not an evil word would he let slip  His virtue she not heeded nor his moan  Her heart hand long ygo transmewed bin to stone  LXI  Behind him came with sweet aspect and bland  The fairest and the loveliest maid I ween  That ever yet on earthly mold did stand  Or ever was by mortal eyesight seen  When as she view'd that miser's doleful teen  O God how did she lift the heavy sigh  What would she give he mought relieved been  For him she could almost with pity die  So feeling was the soul of tender  Sympathy  LXII  Her beauty shew'd more lovely for the tears  Which all besprinkled had her face most meek  As for that wight beset with cruel fears  In vain they ren down o'er her heav'nly cheek  And blushing  Pudency  sat mantling there  Darting her beams the pearled moisture through  So seemingly enshrin'd as does appear  Through a thin cloud  Aurora  to the view  Or a sweet rosy bud thro the clear ambient dew  LXIII  Two little  Cherubs  did afore her fly  One in his hand a golden censer bare  Which underneath her face he did apply  And therein latched every precious tear  Which fill'd he gave up to the other's care  Who to the throne of all o'erswaying  Jove  Plying his purple plumes aloft did steer  He thilke same offering receiv'd with love  And shook with gracious sign his nectar'd locks above  LXIV  Next came  Remorse  his haggard eyes down bent  In ghastly silence glar'd upon the ground  But soon inflected inwardly were sent  As if to perse into his breast profound  There as tho tenting to the quick a wound  Would wring his hands in agony of pain  Or wildly toss them in the air around  Ah foredone wight thou but turmoilst in vain  The sore full deep hath fret and ever shall remain  LXV  Now  Indignation  with his eyen on fire  Welding a glitterand faulchion o'er his head  His red cheeks blushing with becoming ire  His stern brow frowning with a comely dread  For ay he was by  Reason  maistered  He with that faulchion fain would do to die  A snaky monster foul illfavoured  Guilt  who distraught with fear away did fly  Nor tho at distaunce got dar'd turn her craven eye  LXVI  Next  Horrour  harrows in his hand he bore  With which he felly harrowed up the soul  And all her finer senses rent and tore  So that his ravin she might not controul  But he there reigned King and Kesar sole  And  Hopeless Love  a shaft quite thro her heart  Had pass'd the wound she wrapped in her stole  Still struggling to conceal her deadly smart  And like a stricken deer pined away apart  LXVII  And many more attendant on that Queen  Their resience in thilke dark glade did keep  There wonn'd  Suspect  her face all sickly green  Excess of Grief  from whom no tears could creep  Vengeance  who both his hands in blood did steep  Envy  to her own mind the kestrel slave  Dissemblaunce  who like crocodile could weep  Madness  as wild as the enchauffed wave  And  Melancholy  silent as the midnight grave  LXVIII  There too was  Brave Disdain of deed that's base  And there of tried spirit  Conscious Pride  And  Emulation  which no second place  Would graunt and  Mercy  to the gods allied  And  Stoic Rigour  which all vice defied  And  Seemly Zeal  by  True Religion  drest  And  Wedded Love  which death cannot divide  And  Justice  wellspring pure of public rest  And  Filial Piety  with Heav'n's first promise blest  LXIX  All that mought rowse the soul of man was there  All that to goodness mought his bosom sway  And rescue him from Vice's per'lous meir  For  Virtue  marshall'd all in just array  That  Queen  herself does her behests obey  To her from first her origin she owes  Ne without her could reign a single day  By her she order from confusion draws  And all that diverse  Croud  acts as she gives them laws▪  LXX  And now at  Fancy  's bid gan disappear  The darksome dreriness which erst had blent  The sun of heav'n and hid his beamez clear  And with it all that forseen  Many  went  While he his chearing rays more clear outsent  And now a public road before them lay  It seemed as there was some city near  For many a goodly troop pass'd by that way  Some rode some laughing walk'd some sung and some did play  LXXI  Close by the road an  Archer  took his stand  His lowering brow announced vengeful ire  Two female forms were seen on either hand  Who him restrain'd within a certain gyre  With sober counsel smothering his fire  Candour  and  Truth  but he was  Satire  hight  They taught him against whom he war should stire  And when they pointed out the destin'd wight  He drew his bow and him imperst with arrow bright  LXXII  Those whom he so amerc'd with rigorous wound  By an old beldam had been bred a pest  Ycl  ped  Vice  some in disguises found  Others more openly that road t' infest  And unsuspecting passengers molest  But now did halt with limping pace along  While  Infamy  sat grinning on their crest  They joined not in daunce or jovial song  But shun'd and hated skulk'd at distaunce from the throng  LXXIII  Nathless when as his two companions cast  Their eyne aside he would with motion sly  A shaft from forth his quiver snatch in haste  And with insatiable cruelty  At travellers of goodly grace let fly  Which rueful scathe when as the  Virgins  scann'd  To their assistance renning hastily  They pour'd in oil and balm with healing hand  But him with threats affray'd and bitter reprimand  LXXIV  Onward a little space there wonn'd a  Dame  Behind a vizor she aguis'd her face  Socks on her feet she had as her became  And her loose garb fell down with easy grace  Always attending constant on her pace  A selcouth hag a flaming brond who bore  Her name was  Secret Knowledge of Disgrace  A dwarf hight  Ridicule  was plac'd before  Who a large burnish'd mirrour stead of target wore  LXXV  Into thilke mirrour led by  Vanity  And  Folly  vain their semblaunces to view  Most of the silly croud who passed by  With idle mirth and wantonness nigh drew  But so deformed did they therein shew  They nould confess themselves to be the same  Until that  Hag  sprong from her hidden mew  Who dasht into their cheeks her brond of flame  And they retreated thence all covered with shame  LXXVI  But oh what tongue what language may suffice  With ample spirit fitly to express  The scenes that Potent Queen now bid arise  My simple numbers cannot aptly dress  In meet array ne yet their glory guess  When she the Briton Prince and eke his guide  With liberal kindness bounteously to bless  Unfolded to their sight ne yet envied  The regions where the lofty  Epic  doth reside  LXXVII  As though by pow'r past human from his bed  In nightly sleep a wight should snatched be  And cross the sounding seas be hurried  Then waking in the morn with wonder see  Himself in an unknown and strange country  Afore the  Amazons  huge floud latefound  Beyond an open realm uprising free  By the vast towering  Cordilleras  bound  And on the other side th'  Atlantic  waste profound  LXXVIII  So in amaze the Briton Prince was lost  For now down deepsunk vallies rough and steep  Huge rapid streams rolling his vision cross'd  Now without meir an ocean wide and deep  On which the lingering winds did seem to sleep  But soon with angry mood a whirlwind blew  No longer mought it now its calmness keep  But all with foamy wrath enraged grew  And from the fould'ring clouds the levin gaunt outflew  LXXIX  Now on the champion ground he might behold  Castles which seated were in pleasaunt site  And single  Knights  armed in glist'ring gold  With  Ladies  by their sides of beauty bright  To whom they told fair tales of love's delight  Or else for their protection combating  With monsters fell courageously did sight  Or in round lists each other conquering  To them the trophies of their victory did bring  LXXX  Now heard he braying trumpets numberless  The martial blast did his bold bosom thrill  Eftsoons two large enraunged  armies  press  The plain they shout they join they fight they kill  And the engorged earth with carnage fill  Tho saw he where the mountains rose on high  Striding from rock to rock from hill to hill  A giant form whose head arraught the sky  Emong the stars empight his name  Sublimity  LXXXI  These doen away a cloud of blazing sheen  Floating upon a forked hill appear'd  The brightness well nigh blent his feeble eyen  And from behind sich music was there heard  He thought himself to heaven's height uprear'd  And the great weight of pleasure scarce could bear  Ne wonder was't that he sich rapture shar'd  Whan  Jove  himself would often stoop his ear  From high  Olympus'  top thilke harmony to hear  LXXXII  Where the thin edges of that cloud did reach  He might as 'twere part of a temple see  But though he strain'd his eyes to th' utmost stretch  They nould its shape distinguish perfectly  Yet it most gorgeous seemed for to be  But thro the middle of that cloud so bright  From whence issued the dulcet melody  He could by no means cast at all his sight  The oftener he look'd the stronger blaz'd the light  LXXXIII  And now said she O Prince what to thy view  I might disclose thine eyes have briefly seen  So much was to thy fair conductress due  To perse that dazling cloud thou see'st I ween  Thou must all over have besprinkled been  When thou wert born with dews of  Castaly  And thrice three times been dipp'd in  Hippocrene  There on his throne  Apollo  now I see  And there the  Muses  sit each in their just degree  LXXXIV  Yet even these thou shalt behold in time  But first thou many hardy fights must wage  And travel over many various clime  And with thy country's deadly foes engage  And curb the  Saxons  haught with strong menage  Tho they themselves shall take thee by the hand  And to that building with safe tutelage  Conducted thou in  Glory's Fane  shalt stand  And thy renowned name be read in every land▪  LXXXV  This saying she a privy door unbarr'd  Which led a winding passage to the ground  For though to climb up to that tow'r was hard  Down to descend was always easy found  When they now touch'd the bottom of the mound  Many great thanks gave  Alma  to that Dame  And eke the  Prince  with humbless most profound  She upward shot like to an arrowy flame  They back returned by the way in which they came  GLOSSARY  Amenaunce  carriage gesture  Aguise  cover  Als  also  Adaw'd  terrified  Amerc'd
