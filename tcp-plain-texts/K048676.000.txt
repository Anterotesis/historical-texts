 THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  A POEM  THE PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  A POEM IN THREE BOOKS  EPICT apud Arrian II  sculp  LONDON  Printed for R DODSLEY at  Tully  's  Head  in  PallMall  MDCCXLIV  The DESIGN  THERE are certain powers in human nature which seem to hold a middle place between the organs of bodily sense and the faculties of moral perception They have been call'd by a very general name THE POWERS OF IMAGINATION Like the external senses they relate to matter and motion and at the same time give the mind ideas analogous to those of moral approbation and dislike As they are the inlets of some of the most exquisite pleasures we are acquainted with men of warm and sensible tempers have sought means to recall the delightful perceptions they afford independent of the objects which originally produc'd them This gave rise to the imitative or designing arts some of which as painting and sculpture directly copy the external appearances which were admir'd in nature others as music and poetry bring them back to remembrance by signs universally establish'd and understood  But these arts as they grew more correct and deliberate were naturally led to extend their imitation beyond the peculiar objects of the imaginative powers especially poetry which making use of language as the instrument by which it imitates is consequently become an unlimited representative of every species and mode of being Yet as their primary intention was only to express the objects of imagination and as they still abound chiefly in ideas of that class they of course retain their original character and all the different pleasures they excite are term'd in general PLEASURES OF IMAGINATION  The Design of the following poem is to give a view of  these  in the largest acceptation of the term  so that whatever our imagination feels from the agreeable appearances of nature and all the various entertainment we meet with either in poetry painting music or any of the elegant arts might be deducible from one or other of those principles in the constitution of the human mind which are here establish'd and explain'd  In executing this general plan it was necessary first of all to distinguish the imagination from our other faculties and then to characterize those original forms or properties of being about which it is conversant and which are by nature adapted to it as light is to the eyes or truth to the understanding These properties Mr  Addison  had reduc'd to the three general classes of greatness novelty and beauty and into these we may analyse every object however complex which properly speaking is delightful to the imagination But such an object may also include many other sources of pleasure and its beauty or novelty or grandeur will make a stronger impression by reason of this concurrence Besides this the imitative arts especially poetry owe much of their effect to a  similar  exhibition of properties quite  foreign  to the imagination insomuch that in every line of the most applauded poems we meet with either ideas drawn from the external senses or truths discover'd to the understanding or illustrations of contrivance and final causes or above all the rest with circumstances proper to awaken and ingage the passions It was therefore necessary to enumerate and exemplify these different species of pleasure especially that from the passions which as it is supreme in the noblest works of human genius so being in some particulars not a little surprizing gave an opportunity to inliven the didactic turn of the poem by introducing a piece of machinery to account for the appearance  After these parts of the subject which hold chiefly of admiration or naturally warm and interest the mind a pleasure of a very different nature that which arises from ridicule came next to be consider'd As this is the foundation of the comic manner in all the arts and has been but very imperfectly treated by moral writers it was thought proper to give it a particular illustration and to distinguish the general sources from which the ridicule of characters is deriv'd Here too a change of stile became necessary such a one as might yet be consistent if possible with the general taste of composition in the serious parts of the subject nor is it an easy task to give any tolerable force to images of this kind without running either into the gigantic expressions of the mockheroic or the familiar and pointed raillery of profess'd satire neither of which would have been proper here  The materials of all imitation being thus laid open nothing now remain'd but to illustrate some particular pleasures which arise either from the relations of different objects one to another or from the nature of imitation itself Of the first kind is that various and complicated resemblance existing between several parts of the material and immaterial  worlds which is the foundation of metaphor and wit As it seems in a great measure to depend on the early associations of our ideas and as this habit of associating is the source of many pleasures and pains in life and on that account bears a great share in the influence of poetry and the other arts it is therefore mention'd here and its effects describ'd Then follows a general account of the production of these elegant arts and the secondary pleasure as it is call'd arising from the resemblance of their imitations to the original appearances of nature After which the design is clos'd with some reflections on the general conduct of the powers of imagination and on their natural and moral usefulness in life  Concerning the manner or turn of composition which prevails in this piece little can be said with propriety by the author He had two models that antient and simple one of the first  Graecian  poets as it is refin'd by  Virgil  in the  Georgics  and the familiar epistolary way of  Horace  This latter has several advantages It admits of a greater variety of stile it more readily ingages the generality of readers as partaking more of the air of conversation and especially with the assistance of rhyme leads to a closer and more concise expression Add to this the example of the most perfect of modern poets who has so happily applied this manner to the noblest parts of philosophy that the public taste is in a great measure form'd to it alone Yet after all the subject before us tending almost constantly to admiration and enthusiasm seem'd rather to demand a more open pathetic and figur'd stile This too appear'd more natural as the author's aim was not so much to give formal precepts or enter into the way of direct argumentation as by exhibiting the most ingaging prospects of nature to enlarge and harmonize the imagination and by that means insensibly dispose the minds of men to the same dignity of taste in religion morals and civil life 'Tis on this account that he is so careful to point out the benevolent intention of the author of nature in every principle of the human constitution here insisted on and also to unite the moral excellencies of life in the same point of view with the meer external objects of good taste thus recommending them in common to our natural propenstiy for admiring what is beautiful and lovely The same views have also led him to introduce some sentiments which may perhaps be look'd upon as not quite direct to the subject but since they bear an obvious relation to it the authority of  Virgil  the faultless model of didactic poetry will best support him in this particular For the sentiments themselves he makes no apology  ARGUMENT of the FIRST BOOK  THE subject propos'd  verse  to Difficulty of treating it poetically  v  The ideas of the divine mind the origin of every quality pleasing to the imagination  v

touches the consenting hearts  Of mortal men and what the pleasing stores  Which beauteous imitation thence derives  To deck the poet's or the painter's toil  My verse unfolds Attend ye gentle POW'RS  OF MUSICAL DELIGHT and while I sing  Your gifts your honours dance around my strain  Thou smiling queen of every tuneful breast  Indulgent FANCY from the fruitful banks  Of Avon whence thy rosy fingers cull  Fresh flow'rs and dews to sprinkle on the turf  Where  Shakespeare  lies be present and with thee  Let FICTION come upon her vagrant wings  Wafting ten thousand colours thro' the air  And by the glances of her magic eye  Combining each in endless fairy forms  Her wild creation Goddess of the lyre  Which rules the accents of the moving sphere  Wilt thou eternal HARMONY descend  And join this festive train for with thee comes  The guide the guardian of their lovely sports  Majestic TRUTH and where TRUTH deigns to come  Her sister LIBERTY will not be far  Be present all ye GENII who conduct  The wand'ring footsteps of the youthful bard  New to your springs and shades who touch his ear  With finer sounds who heighten to his eye  The bloom of nature and before him turn  The gayest happiest attitudes of things  Oft have the laws of each poetic strain  The criticverse imploy'd yet still unsung  Lay this prime subject tho' importing most  A poet's name for fruitless is th' attempt  By dull obedience and the curb of rules  For creeping toil to climb the hard ascent  Of high Parnassus Nature's kindling breath  Must fire the chosen genius nature's hand  Must point the path and imp his eaglewings  Exulting o'er the painful steep to soar  High as the summit there to breathe at large  Aethereal air with bards and sages old  Immortal sons of praise These flatt'ring scenes  To this neglected labour court my song  Yet not unconscious what a doubtful task  Yet not unconscious  Lucret l v  Nec me animi fallit quam sint obscura sed acri  Percussit thyrso laudis spes magna meum cor  Et simul incussit suavem mi in pectus amorem  Musarum quo nunc instinctus mente vigenti  Avia Piëridum peragro loca nullius ante  Trita solo juvat integros accedere fonteis  Atque haurire juvatque novos discerpere flores  Insignem meo capiti petere inde coronam  Unde prius nulli velarint tempora Musae  To paint the finest features of the mind  And to the most subtile and mysterious things  Give colour strength and motion But the love  Of nature and the muses bids explore  Thro' secret paths erewhile untrod by man  The fair poetic region to detect  Untasted springs to drink inspiring draughts  And shade my temples with unfading flow'rs  Cull'd from the laureate vale's profound recess  Where never poet gain'd a wreath before  From heav'n my strains begin from heaven descends  The flame of genius to the human breast  And love and beauty and poetic joy  And inspiration Ere the radiant sun  Sprung from the east or 'mid the vault of night  The moon suspended her serener lamp  Ere mountains woods or streams adorn'd the globe  Or wisdom taught the sons of men her lore  Then liv'd th' eternal ONE then deepretir'd  In his unfathom'd essence view'd at large  The uncreated images of things  The radiant sun the moon's nocturnal lamp  The mountains woods and streams the rolling globe  And wisdom's form coelestial From the first  Of days on them his love divine he fix'd  His admiration till in time compleat  What he admir'd and lov'd his vital smile  Unfolded into being Hence the breath  Of life informing each organic frame  Hence the green earth and wild resounding waves  Hence light and shade alternate warmth and cold  And clear autumnal skies and vernal show'rs  And all the fair variety of things  But not alike to every mortal eye  Is this great scene unveil'd For since the claims  Of social life to diff'rent labours urge  The active pow'rs of man with wise intent  The hand of nature on peculiar minds  Imprints a diff'rent byass and to each  Decrees its province in the common toil  To some she taught the fabric of the sphere  The changeful moon the circuit of the starrs  The golden zones of heav'n to some she gave  To weigh the moment of eternal things  Of time and space and fate's unbroken chain  And will's quick impulse others by the hand  She led o'er vales and mountains to explore  What healing virtue swells the tender veins  Of herbs and flow'rs or what the beams of morn  Draw forth distilling from the clifted rind  In balmy tears But some to higher hopes  Were destin'd some within a finer mould  She wrought and temper'd with a purer flame  To these the sire omnipotent unfolds  The world's harmonious volume there to read  The transcript of himself On every part  They trace the bright impressions of his hand  In earth or air the meadow's purple stores  The moon's mild radiance or the virgin's form  Blooming with rosy smiles they see portray'd  That uncreated beauty which delights  The mind supreme  They  also feel her charms  Enamour'd  they  partake th' eternal joy  As Memnon's marble harp renown'd of old  As Memnon's marble harp  The statue of  Memnon  so famous in antiquity stood in the temple of  Serapis  at  Thebes  one of the great cities of old  Egypt  It was of a very hard ironlike stone and according to  Juvenal  held in its hand a lyre which being touch'd by the sunbeams emitted a distinct and agreeable sound  Tacitus  mentions it as one of the principal curiosities which  Germanicus  took notice of in his journey through  Egypt  and  Strabo  affirms that he with many others heard it  By fabling Nilus to the quivering touch  Of Titan's ray with each repulsive string  Consenting sounded thro' the warbling air  Unbidden strains ev'n so did nature's hand  To certain species of external things  Attune the finer organs of the mind  So the glad impulse of congenial pow'rs  Or of sweet sound or fairproportion'd form  The grace of motion or the bloom of light  Thrills thro' imagination's tender frame  From nerve to nerve all naked and alive  They catch the spreading rays till now the soul  At length discloses every tuneful spring  To that harmonious movement from without  Responsive Then the inexpressive strain  Diffuses its inchantment fancy dreams  Of sacred fountains and Elysian groves  And vales of bliss the intellectual pow'r  Bends from his awful throne a wond'ring ear  And smiles the passions gently sooth'd away  Sink to divine repose and love and joy  Alone are waking love and joy serene  As airs that fan the summer O attend  Whoe'er thou art whom these delights can touch  Whose candid bosom the refining love  Of nature warms O listen to my song  And I will guide thee to her fav'rite walks  And teach thy solitude her voice to hear  And point her loveliest features to thy view  Know then whate'er of nature's pregnant stores  Whate'er of mimic art's reflected forms  With love and admiration thus inflame  The pow'rs of fancy her delighted sons  To three illustrious orders have referr'd  Three sistergraces whom the painter's hand  The poet's tongue confesses the  sublime    The  wonderful  the  fair  I see them dawn  I see the radiant visions where they rise  More lovely than when Lucifer displays  His beaming forehead thro' the gates of morn  To lead the train of Phoebus and the spring  Say why was man so eminently rais'd  Say why was man  c    In apologizing for the frequent negligence of the sublimest authors of  Greece    Those godlike geniuses  says  Longinus    were wellassured that nature had not intended man for a lowspirited or ignoble being but bringing us into life and the midst of this wide universe as before a multitude assembled at some heroic solemnity that we might be spectators of all her magnificence and candidates high in emulation for the prize of glory she has therefore implanted in our souls an inextinguishable love of every thing great and exalted of every thing which appears divine beyond our comprehension Whence it comes to pass that even the whole world is not an object sufficient for the depth and rapidity of human imagination which often sallies forth beyond the limits of all that surrounds us Let any man cast his eye through the whole circle of our existence and consider how especially it abounds in excellent and grand objects he will soon acknowledge for what injoyments and pursuits we were destined Thus by the very propensity of nature we are led to admire not little springs or shallow rivulets however clear and delicious but the Nile the Rhine the Danube and much more than all the ocean  c  Dionys Longin de Sublim § xxxiv  Amid the vast creation why ordain'd  Thro' life and death to dart his piercing eye  With thoughts beyond the limit of his frame  But that th' Omnipotent might send him forth  In sight of mortal and immortal pow'rs  As on a boundless theatre to run  The great career of justice to exalt  His gen'rous aim to all diviner deeds  To shake each partial purpose from his breast  And thro' the mists of passion and of sense  And thro' the tossing tide of chance and pain  To hold his course unfalt'ring while the voice  Of truth and virtue up the steep ascent  Of nature calls him to his high reward  Th' applauding smile of heav'n Else wherefore burns  In mortal bosoms this unquenched hope  That breathes from day to day sublimer things  And mocks possession wherefore darts the mind  With such resistless ardor to embrace  Majestic forms impatient to be free  Spurning the gross controul of wilful might  Proud of the strong contention of her toils  Proud to be daring Who but rather turns  To heav'n's broad fire his unconstrained view  Than to the glimm'ring of a waxen flame  Who that from Alpine heights his lab'ring eye  Shoots round the wide horizon to survey  The Nile or Ganges rowl his wasteful tide  Thro' mountains plains thro' empires black with shade  And continents of sand will turn his gaze  To mark the windings of a scanty rill  That murmurs at his feet The highborn soul  Disdains to rest her heav'naspiring wing  Beneath its native quarry Tir'd of earth  And this diurnal scene she springs aloft  Thro' fields of air pursues the flying storm  Rides on the volley'd lightning thro' the heav'ns  Or yok'd with whirlwinds and the northern blast  Sweeps the long tract of day Then high she soars  The blue profound and hovering o'er the sun  Beholds him pouring the redundant stream  Of light beholds his unrelenting sway  Bend the reluctant planets to absolve  The fated rounds of time Thence far effus'd  She darts her swiftness up the long career  Of devious comets thro' its burning signs  Exulting circles the perennial wheel  Of nature and looks back on all the starrs  Whose blended light as with a milky zone  Invests the orient Now amaz'd she views  Th' empyreal waste where happy spirits hold  Th' empyreal waste  Ne se peutil point qu'il y a un grand espace audelà de la region des etoiles Que ce soit le ciel empyreé ou non toûjours cet espace immense qui environne toute cette region pourra être rempli de bonheur de gloire Il pourre être conçu comme l'ocean où se rendent les fleuves de toutes les

have had time to reach us even from the creation of the world to this day  Has travell'd the profound six thousand years  Nor yet arrives in sight of mortal things  Ev'n on the barriers of the world untir'd  She meditates th' eternal depth below  Till half recoiling down the headlong steep  She plunges soon o'erwhelm'd and swallow'd up  In that immense of being There her hopes  Rest at the fated goal For from the birth  Of mortal man the sov'reign Maker said  That not in humble or in brief delight  Not in the fading echoes of renown  Pow'rs purple robes or pleasure's flow'ry lap  The soul should find injoyment but from these  Turning disdainful to an equal good  Thro' all th' ascent of things inlarge her view  Till every bound at length should disappear  And infinite perfection close the scene  Call now to mind what high capacious pow'rs  Lie folded up in man how far beyond  The praise of mortals may th' eternal growth  Of nature to perfection half divine  Expand the blooming soul What pity then  Should sloth's unkindly fogs depress to earth  Her tender blossom choak the streams of life  And blast her spring Far otherwise design'd  Almighty wisdom nature's happy cares  Th'obedient heart far otherwise incline  Witness the sprightly joy when aught unknown  Strikes the quick sense and wakes each active pow'r  To brisker measures witness the neglect  Of all familiar prospects tho' beheld  the neglect  Of all familiar prospects  c    It is here said that in consequence of the love of novelty objects which at first were highly delightful to the mind lose that effect by repeated attention to them But the instance of  habit  is oppos'd to this observation for  there  objects at first distasteful are in time render'd intirely agreeable by repeated attention  The difficulty in this case will be remov'd if we consider that when objects at first agreeable lose that influence by frequently recurring the mind is wholly  passive  and the perception  involuntary  but habit on the other hand generally supposes  choice  and  activity  accompanying it so that the pleasure arises here not from the object but from the mind's  conscious  determination of its own activity and consequently increases in proportion to the frequency of that determination  It will still be urged perhaps that a familiarity with disagreeable objects renders them at length acceptable even when there is no room for the mind to  resolve  or  act  at all In this case the appearance must be accounted for one of these ways  The pleasure from habit may be meerly negative The object at first gave uneasiness this uneasinest gradually wears off as the object grows familiar and the mind finding it at last intirely removed reckons its situation really pleasurable compar'd with what it had experienced before  The dislike conceiv'd of the object at first might be owing to prejudice or want of attention Consequently the mind being necessitated to review it often may at length perceive its own mistake and be reconcil'd to what it had look'd on with aversion In which case a sort of instinctive justice naturally leads it to make amends for the injury by running toward th e other extreme of fondness and attachment  Or lastly tho' the object itself should always continue disagreeable yet circumstances of pleasure or good fortune may occur along with it Thus an association may arise in the mind and the object never be remember'd without those pleasing circumstances attending it by which means the disagreeable impression it at first occasion'd will in time be quite obliterated  With transport once the fond attentive gaze  Of young astonishment the sober zeal  Of age commenting on prodigious things  For such the bounteous providence of heav'n  In every breast implanting this desire  Of objects new and strange to urge us on  this desire  Of objects  new  and  strange    These two ideas are oft confounded tho' it is evident the meer  novelty  of an object makes it agreeable even where the mind is not affected with the least degree of  wonder  whereas  wonder  indeed always implies  novelty  being never excited by common or wellknown appearances But the pleasure in both cases is explicable from the same final cause the acquisition of knowledge and inlargement of our views of nature and on this account it is natural to treat of them together  With unremitted labour to pursue  Those sacred stores that wait the ripening soul  In truth's exhaustless bosom What need words  To paint its pow'r For this the daring youth  Breaks from his weeping mother's anxious arms  In foreign climes to rove the pensive sage  Heedless of sleep or midnight's harmful damp  Hangs o'er the sickly taper and untir'd  The virgin follows with inchanted step  The mazes of some wild and wond'rous tale  From morn to eve unmindful of her form  Unmindful of the happy dress that stole  The wishes of the youth when every maid  With envy pin'd Hence finally by night  The villagematron round the blazing hearth  Suspends the infantaudience with her tales  Breathing astonishment of witching rhymes  And evil spirits of the deathbed call  To him who robb'd the widow and devour'd  The orphan's portion of unquiet souls  Ris'n from the grave to ease the heavy guilt  Of deeds in life conceal'd of shapes that walk  At dead of night and clank their chains and wave  The torch of hell around the murd'rer's bed  At every solemn pause the croud recoil  Gazing each other speechless and congeal'd  With shiv'ring sighs till eager for th' event  Around the beldame all arrect they hang  Each trembling heart with grateful terrors quell'd  But lo disclos'd in all her smiling pomp  Where BEAUTY onward moving claims the verse  Her charms inspire the freelyflowing verse  In thy immortal praise O form divine  Smooths her mellifluent stream Thee BEAUTY thee  The regal dome and thy enlivening ray  The mossy roofs adore thou better sun  For ever beamest on th' inchanted heart  Love and harmonious wonder and delight  Poetic Brightest progeny of heav'n  How shall I trace thy features where select  The roseate hues to emulate thy bloom  Haste then my song thro' nature's wide expanse  Haste then and gather all her comeliest wealth  Whate'er bright spoils the florid earth contains  Whate'er the waters or the liquid air  To deck thy lovely labour Wilt thou fly  With laughing Autumn to th'Atlantic isles  Atlantic isles  By these islands which were also called  the Fortunate  the ancients are now generally supposed to have meant the  Canaries  They were celebrated by the poets for the mildness and fertility of the climate for the gardens of the daughters of  Hesperus  the brother of  Atlas  and the dragon which constantly watched their golden fruit till it was slain by the  Tyrian Hercules  And range with him th'Hesperian field and see  Where'er his fingers touch the fruitful grove  The branches shoot with gold where'er his step  Marks the glad soil the tender clusters glow  With purple ripeness and invest each hill  As with the blushes of an evening sky  Or wilt thou rather stoop thy vagrant plume  Where gliding thro' his daughter's honour'd shades  Where gliding thro' his daughter's honour'd shades  Daphne  the daughter of  Penéus  transformed into a laurel  The smooth Penéus from his glassy flood  Reflects purpureal Tempe's pleasant scene  Fair Tempe haunt belov'd of fylvan pow'rs  Of nymphs and fauns where in the golden age  They play'd in secret on the shady brink  With ancient Pan while round their choral steps  Young hours and genial gales with constant hand  Show'r'd blossoms odours show'r'd ambrosial dews  And spring's Elysian bloom Her flow'ry store  To thee nor Tempe shall refuse nor watch  Of winged Hydra guard Hesperian fruits  From thy free spoil O bear then unreprov'd  Thy smiling treasures to the green recess  Where young Dione stays With sweetest airs  Intice her forth to lend her angelform  For beauty's honour'd image Hither turn  Thy graceful footsteps hither gentle maid  Incline thy polish'd forehead let thy eyes  Effuse the mildness of their azure dawn  And may the fanning breezes waft aside  Thy radiant locks disclosing as it bends  With airy softness from the marble neck  The cheek fairblooming and the rosy lip  Where winning smiles and pleasure sweet as love  With sanctity and wisdom temp'ring blend  Their soft allurement Then the pleasing force  Of nature and her kind parental care  Worthier I'd sing then all th' enamour'd youth  With each admiring virgin to my lyre  Should throng attentive while I point on high  Where beauty's living image like the morn  That wakes in Zephyr's arms the blushing May  Moves onward or as Venus when she stood  Effulgent on the pearly car and smil'd  Fresh from the deep and conscious of her form  To see the Tritons tune their vocal shells  And each coerulean sister of the flood  With fond acclaim attend her o'er the waves  To seek th' Idalian bow'r Ye smiling band  Of youths and virgins who thro' all the maze  Of young desire with rivalsteps pursue  This charm of beauty if the pleasing toil  Can yield a moment's respite hither turn  Your favourable ear and trust my words  I do not mean to wake the gloomy form  Of superstition drest in wisdom's garb  To damp your tender hopes I do not mean  To bid the jealous thund'rer fire the heav'ns  Or shapes infernal rend the groaning earth  To fright you from your joys my chearful song  With better omens calls you to the field  Pleas'd with your gen'rous ardour in the chace  And warm as you Then tell me for you know  Does beauty ever deign to dwell where health  And active use are strangers Is her charm  Confess'd in aught whose most peculiar ends  Are lame and fruitless Or did nature mean  This awful stamp the herald of a lye  To hide the shame of discord and disease  And catch with fair hypocrisy the heart  Of idle faith O no with better cares  Th' indulgent mother conscious how infirm  Her offspring tread the paths of good and ill  By this illustrious image in each kind  Still most illustrious where the object holds  Its native pow'rs most perfect she by this  Illumes the headlong impulse of desire  And sanctifies his choice The generous glebe  Whose bosom smiles with verdure the clear tract  Of streams delicious to the thirsty soul  The bloom of nectar'd fruitage ripe to sense  And every charm of animated things  Are only pledges of a state sincere  Th' integrity and order of their frame  When all is well within and every end  Accomplish'd Thus was beauty sent from heav'n  The lovely ministress of truth and good  In this dark world for truth and good are one  And beauty dwells in them and they in her  Truth and good are one  And beauty dwells in them  c    Do you imagine  says  Socrates  to his libertine disciple  that what is good is not also beautiful Have you not observ'd that these appearances always coincide Virtue for instance in the same respect as to which we call it good is ever acknowledg'd to be beautiful also In the characters of men we always  This the  Athenians  did in a peculiar manner by the words    join the two denominations together The beauty of human bodies corresponds in like manner with that oeconomy of parts which constitutes them good and in all the circumstances which occurr in life the same object is constantly accounted both beautiful and good inasmuch as it answers the purposes for which it was design'd  Xenophont memorab Socrat c  This excellent observation has been illustrated and extended by the noble restorer of ancient philosophy  see the Characteristicks  vol p vol p And his most ingenious disciple has particularly shewn that it holds in the general laws of nature in the works of art and the conduct of the sciences  Inquiry into the original of our ideas of beauty and virtue    Treat  § As to the connection between  beauty  and  truth  there are two opinions concerning it Some philosophers assert an independent and invariable law in nature in consequence of which  all rational beings must alike perceive beauty in some certain proportions and deformity in the contrary  And this necessity being supposed the same with that which commands the assent or dissent of the understanding it follows of course that  beauty  is founded on the universal and unchangeable law of  truth  But others there are who believe  beauty  to be meerly a relative and arbitrary thing that indeed it was a benevolent design in nature to annex so delightful a sensation to those objects which are  best and most perfect in themselves  that so we might be ingaged to the choice of them at once and without staying to infer their  usefulness  from their structure and effects but that it is not impossible in a physical sense that two beings of equal capacities for  truth  should perceive one of them  beauty  and the other  deformity  in the same relations And upon this supposition by that  truth  which is always connected with  beauty  nothing more can be meant than the conformity of any object to those proportions upon which after careful examination the beauty of that species is found to depend  Polycletus  for instance the famous sculptor of  Sicyon  from an accurate mensuration of the several parts of the most perfect human bodies deduced a canon or system of proportions which was the rule of all succeeding artists Suppose a statue modell'd according to this canon A man of meer natural taste upon looking at it without entering into its proportions confesses and admires its  beauty  whereas a professor of the art applies his measures to the head the neck or the hand and without attending to its beauty pronounces the workmanship to be  just  and  true  With like participation Wherefore then  O sons of earth would you dissolve the tye  O wherefore with a rash imperfect aim  Seek you those flow'ry joys with which the hand  Of lavish fancy paints each flatt'ring scene  Where beauty seems to dwell nor once inquire  Where is the sanction of eternal truth  Or where the seal of undeceitful good  To save your search from folly Wanting these  Lo beauty withers in your void imbrace  And with the glitt'ring of an idiot's toy  Did fancy mock your vows Nor let the gleam  Of youthful hope that shines upon your hearts  Be chill'd or clouded at this awful task  To learn the lore of undeceitful good  And truth eternal Tho' the pois'nous charms  Of baleful superstition guide the feet  Of servile numbers thro' a dreary way  To their abode thro' desarts thorns and mire  And leave the wretched pilgrim all forlorn  To muse at last amid the ghostly gloom  Of graves and hoary vaults and cloister'd cells  To walk with spectres thro' the midnight shade  And to the screaming owl's accursed song  Attune the dreadful workings of his heart  Yet be not you dismay'd A gentler star  Your lovely search illumines From the grove  Where wisdom talk'd with her Athenian sons  Could my ambitious hand intwine a wreath  Of PLATO'S olive with the Mantuan bay  Then should my pow'rful voice at once dispel  These monkish horrors then in light divine  Disclose th' Elysian prospect where the steps  Of those whom nature charms thro' blooming walks  Thro' fragrant mountains and poetic streams  Amid the train of sages heroes bards  Led by their winged Genius and the choir  Of laurell'd science and harmonious art  Proceed exulting to th' eternal shrine  Where truth inthron'd with her coelestial twins  The undivided part'ners of her sway  With good and beauty reigns O let not us  Lull'd by luxurious pleasure's languid strain  Or crouching to the frowns of bigotrage  O let not us a moment pause to join  The godlike band And if the gracious pow'r  That first awaken'd my untutor'd song  Will to my invocation breathe anew  The tuneful spirit then thro' all our paths  Ne'er shall the sound of this devoted lyre  Be wanting whether on the rosy mead  When summer smiles to warn the melting heart  Of luxury's allurement whether firm  Against the torrent and the stubborn hill  To urge bold virtue's unremitted nerve  And wake the strong divinity of soul  That conquers chance and fate or whether struck  For sounds of triumph to proclaim her toils  Upon the lofty summit round her brow  To twine the wreathe of incorruptive praise  To trace her hallow'd light thro' future worlds  And bless heav'n's image in the heart of man  Thus with a faithful aim have we presum'd  Advent'rous to delineate nature's form  Whether in vast majestic pomp array'd  Or drest for pleasing wonder or serene  In beauty's rosy smile It now remains  Thro' various being's fairproportion'd scale  To trace the rising lustre of her charms  From their first twilight shining forth at length  To full meridian splendour Of degree  The least and lowliest in th'effusive warmth  Of colours mingling with a random blaze  Doth beauty dwell Then higher in the line  And variation of determin'd shape  Where truth's eternal measures mark the bound  Of circle cube or sphere The third ascent  Unites this varied symmetry of parts  With colour's bland allurement as the pearl  Shines in the concave of its azure bed  And painted shells indent their speckled wreathe  Then more attractive rise the blooming forms  Thro' which the breath of nature has infus'd  Her genial pow'r to draw with pregnant veins  Nutritious moisture from the bounteous earth  In fruit and seed prolific thus the flow'rs  Their purple honours with the spring resume  And such the stately tree which autumn bends  With blushing treasures But more lovely still  Is nature's charm where to the full consent  Of complicated members to the bloom  Of colour and the vital change of growth  Life's holy flame and piercing sense are giv'n  And active motion speaks the temper'd soul  So moves the bird of Juno so the steed  With rival ardour beats the dusty plain  And faithful dogs with eager airs of joy  Salute their fellows Thus doth beauty dwell  There most conspicuous ev'n in outward shape  Where dawns the high expression of a mind  By steps conducting our inraptur'd search  To that eternal origin whose pow'r  Thro' all th' unbounded symmetry of things  Like rays effulging from the parent sun  This endless mixture of her charms diffus'd  MIND MIND alone bear witness earth and heav'n  The living fountains in itself contains  Of beauteous and sublime here hand in hand  Sit paramount the Graces here inthron'd  Coelestial Venus with divinest airs  Invites the soul to neverfading joy  Looks then abroad thro' nature to the range  Of planets suns and adamantine spheres  Wheeling unshaken thro' the void immense  And speak O man does this capacious scene  With half that kindling majesty dilate  Thy strong conception as when Brutus rose  As when Brutus rose  c    Cicero  himself describes this fact  Caesare interfectostatim cruentum altè extollens M Brutus pugionem Ciceronem nominatim

guilt brings down the thunder call'd aloud  On Tully's name and shook his crimson steel  And bade the father of his country hail  For lo the tyrant prostrate on the dust  And Rome again is freeIs aught so fair  In all the dewy landscapes of the spring  In the bright eye of Hesper or the morn  In nature's fairest forms is aught so fair  As virtuous friendship as the candid blush  Of him who strives with fortune to be just  The graceful tear that streams for other's woes  Or the mild majesty of private life  Where peace with everblooming olive crowns  The gate where honour's liberal hands effuse  Unenvy'd treasures and the snowy wings  Of innocence and love protect the scene  Once more search undismay'd the dark profound  Where nature works in secret view the beds  Of min'ral treasure and th' eternal vault  That bounds the hoary ocean trace the forms  Of atoms moving with incessant change  Their elemental round behold the seeds  Of being and the energy of life  Kindling the mass with everactive flame  Then to the secrets of the working mind  Attentive turn from dim oblivion call  Her fleet ideal band and bid them go  Break thro' time's barrier and o'ertake the hour  That saw the heav'ns created then declare  If aught were found in those external scenes  To move thy wonder now For what are all  The forms which brute unconscious matter wears  Greatness of bulk or symmetry of parts  Not reaching to the heart soon feeble grows  The superficial impulse dull their charms  And satiate soon and pall the languid eye  Not so the moral species or the pow'rs  Of genius and design th' ambitious mind  There sees herself by these congenial forms  Touch'd and awaken'd with intenser act  She bends each nerve and meditates wellpleas'd  Her features in the mirror For of all  Th' inhabitants of earth to man alone  Creative wisdom gave to lift his eye  To truth's eternal measures thence to frame  The sacred laws of action and of will  Discerning justice from unequal deeds  And temperance from folly But beyond  This energy of truth whose dictates bind  Assenting reason the benignant  ire  To deck the honour'd paths of just and good  Has added bright imagination's rays  Where virtue rising from the awful depth  Of truth's mysterious bosom doth forsake  Where virtue rising from the awful depth  Of truth's mysterious bosom  c    According to the opinion of those who assert  moral obligation  to be founded on an immutable and universal law and that pathetic feeling which is usually call'd the moral sense to be determin'd by the peculiar temper of the imagination and the earliest associations of ideas  The unadorn'd condition of her birth  And dress'd by fancy in ten thousand hues  Assumes a various feature to attract  With charms responsive to each gazer's eye  The hearts of men Amid his rural walk  Th' ingenuous youth whom solitude inspires  With purest wishes from the pensive shade  Beholds her moving like a virginmuse  That wakes her lyre to some indulgent theme  Of harmony and wonder while among  The herd of servile minds her strenuous form  Indignant flashes on the patriot's eye  And thro' the rolls of memory appeals  To ancient honour or in

WHEN shall the laurel and the vocal string  Resume their honours When shall we behold  The tuneful tongue the Promethéan hand  Aspire to ancient praise Alas how faint  How slow the dawn of beauty and of truth  Breaks the reluctant shades of Gothic night  Which yet involve the nations Long they groan'd  Beneath the furies of rapacious force  Oft as the gloomy north with ironswarms  Tempestuous pouring from her frozen caves  Blasted th' Italian shore and swept the works  Of liberty and wisdom down the gulph  Of alldevouring night As long immur'd  In noontide darkness by th' glimm'ring lamp  Each muse and each fair science pin'd away  The sordid hours while foul barbarian hands  Their mysteries profan'd unstrung the lyre  And chain'd the soaring pinion down to earth  At last the Muses rose and spurn'd their bonds  At last the Muses rose  c    About the age of  Hugh Capet  the founder of the third race of  French  kings the poets of  Provence  were in high reputation a sort of stroling bards or rhapsodists who went about the courts of princes and noblemen entertaining them at festivals with music and poetry They attempted both the epic ode and satire and abounded in a wild and fantastic vein of fable partly allegorical and partly founded on traditionary legends of the  Saracen  wars These were the rudiments of the  Italian  poetry But their taste and composition must have been extremely barbarous as we may judge by those who followed the turn of their fable in much politer times such as  Boiardo    Bernardo Tasso    Ariosto  c  And wildly warbling scatter'd as they flew  Their blooming wreaths from fair Valclusa's  Valclusa  The famous retreat of  Francesco Petrarcha  the father of  Italian  poetry and his mistress  Laura  a lady of  Avignon  bow'rs  To Arno's  Arno  The river which runs by  Florence  the birthplace of  Dante  and  Boccacio  myrtle border from the shore  Of soft Parthenope  Parthenope  Or  Naples  the birthplace of  Sannazaro  The great  Torquato Tasso  was born at  Sorrento  in the kingdom of  Naples  But still the rage  Of dire ambition and gigantic pow'r  the rage  Of dire ambition  c    This relates to the cruel wars among the republics of  Italy  and the abominable politics of its little princes about the the fifteenth century These at last in conjunction with the papal power intirely extinguished the spirit of liberty in that country and establish'd that abuse of the fine arts which has since been propagated over all  Europe  From public aims and from the busy walk  Of civil commerce drove the bolder train  Of penetrating science to the cells  Where studious ease consumes the silent hour  In shadowy searches and unfruitful care  Thus from their guardians torn the tender arts  Thus from their guardians torn the tender arts  c    Nor were they only losers by the separation For philosophy itself to use the words of a noble philosopher  being thus sever'd from the sprightly arts and sciences must consequently grow dronish insipid pedantic useless and directly opposite to the real knowledge and practice of the world  Insomuch that  a gentleman  says another excellent writer  cannot easily bring himself to like so austere and ungainly a form so greatly is it changed from what was once the delight of the finest gentlemen of antiquity and their recreation after the hurry of public affairs  From this condition it cannot be recovered but by uniting it once more with the works of imagination and we have had the pleasure of observing a very great progress made towards their union in  England  within these few years It is hardly possible to conceive them at a greater distance from each other than at the revolution when  Locke  stood at the head of one party and  Dryden  of the other But the general spirit of liberty which has ever since been growing naturally invited our men of wit and genius to improve that influence which the arts of persuasion give them with the people by applying them to subjects of importance to society Thus poetry and eloquence became considerable and philosophy is now of course obliged to borrow of their imbellishments in order even to gain audience with the public  Of mimic fancy and harmonious joy  To priestly domination and the lust  Of lawless courts their amiable toil  For three inglorious ages have resign'd  In vain reluctant and Torquato's tongue  Was tun'd for slavish paeans at the throne  Of tinsel pomp and Raphael's magic hand  Effus'd its fair creation to inchant  The fond adoring herd in Latian fanes  To bind belief while on their prostrate necks  The sable tyrant plants his heel secure  But now behold the radiant aera dawns  When freedom's ample fabric fix'd at length  For endless years on Albion's happy shore  In full proportion once more shall extend  To all the kindred pow'rs of social bliss  A common mansion a parental roof  There shall the Virtues there shall Wisdom's train  Their longlost friends rejoining as of old  Imbrace the smiling family of arts  The Muses and the Graces Then no more  Shall vice distracting their delicious gifts  To aims abhorr'd with high distaste and scorn  Turn from their charms the philosophic eye  The patriotbosom then no more the paths  Of public care or intellectual toil  Alone by footsteps haughty and severe  In gloomy state be trod th' harmonious Muse  And her persuasive sisters then shall plant  Their sheltring laurels o'er the bleak ascent  And shed their flow'rs along the rugged way  Arm'd with the lyre already have we dar'd  To pierce divine philosophy's retreats  And teach the Muse her lore already strove  Their longdivided honours to unite  While temp'ring this deep argument we sang  Of truth and beauty Now the same task  Impends now urging our ambitious toil  We hasten to recount the various springs  Of adventitious pleasure which adjoin  Their grateful influence to the prime effect  Of objects grand or beauteous and inlarge  The complicated joy The sweets of sense  Do they not oft with kind accession flow  To raise harmonious fancy's native charm  So while we taste the fragrance of the rose  Glows not her blush the fairer While we view  Amid the noontide walk a limpid rill  Gush thro' the trickling herbage to the thirst  Of summer yielding the delicious draught  Of cool refreshment o'er the mossy brink  Shines not the surface clearer and the waves  With sweeter music murmur as they flow  Nor this alone the various lot of life  Oft from external circumstance assumes  A moment's disposition to rejoice  In those delights which at a different hour  Would pass unheeded Fair the face of spring  When rural songs and odours wake the morn  To every eye but how much more to his  Round whom the bed of sickness long diffus'd  Its melancholy gloom how doubly fair  When first with freshborn vigour  he  inhales  The balmy breeze and feels the blessed sun  Warm at his bosom from the springs of life  Chasing oppressive damps and languid pain  Or shall I mention where coelestial truth  Her awful light discloses to effuse  A more majestic pomp on beauty's frame  For man loves knowledge and the beams of truth  More welcome touch his understanding's eye  Than all the blandishments of sound his ear  Than all of taste his tongue Nor ever yet  The melting rainbow's vernaltinctur'd hues  To me have shone so pleasing as when first  The hand of science pointed out the path  In which the sunbeams gleaming from the west  Fall on the watry cloud whose darksome veil  Involves the orient and that trickling show'r  Piercing thro' every crystalline convex  Of clust'ring dewdrops to their flight oppos'd  Recoil at length where concave all behind  Th' internal surface of each glassy orb  Repells their forward passage into air  That thence direct they seek the radiant goal  From which their course began and as they strike  In diff'rent lines the gazer's obvious eye  Assume a diff'rent lustre thro' the brede  Of colours changing from the splendid rose  To the pale violet's dejected hue  Or shall we touch that kind access of joy  That springs to each fair object while we trace  Thro' all its fabric wisdom's artful aim  Disposing every part and gaining still  By means proportion'd her benignant end  Speak ye the pure delight whose favour'd steps  The lamp of science thro' the jealous maze  Of nature guides when haply you reveal  Her secret honours whether in the sky  The beauteous laws of light the central pow'rs  That wheel the pensile planets round the year  Whether in wonders of the rowling deep  Or smiling fruits of pleasurepregnant earth  Or fineadjusted springs of life and sense  You scan the counsels of their author's hand  What when to raise the meditated scene  The flame of passion thro' the struggling soul  Deepkindled shows across that sudden blaze  The object of its rapture vast of size  With fiercer colours and a night of shade  What like a storm from their capacious bed  The sounding seas o'erwhelming when the might  Of these eruptions working from the depth  Of man's strong apprehension shakes his frame  Ev'n to the base from every naked sense  Of pain or pleasure dissipating all  Opinion's feeble cov'rings and the veil  Spun from the cobwebfashion of the times  To hide the feeling heart Then nature speaks  Her genuine language and the words of men  Big with the very motion of their souls  Declare with what accumulated force  Th' impetuous nerve of passion urges on  The native weight and energy of things  Yet more her honours where nor beauty claims  Nor shews of good the thirsty sense allure  From passion's pow'r alone our nature holds  From passion's power alone  c    This very mysterious kind of pleasure which is often found in the exercise of passions generally counted painful has been taken taken notice of by several authors  Lucretius  resolves it into selflove  Suave mari magno  c  lib II  As if a man was never pleas'd in being moved at the distress of a tragedy without a cool reflection that tho' these fictitious personages were so unhappy yet he himself was perfectly at ease and in safety The ingenious and candid author of the  reflexions critiques sur la poesie sur la peinture  accounts for it by the general delight which the mind takes in its own activity and the abhorrence it feels of an indolent and unattentive state And this join'd with the moral applause of its own temper which attends these emotions when natural and just is certainly the true foundation of the pleasure which as it is the origin and basis of tragedy and epic deserved a very particular consideration in this poem  Essential pleasure Passion's fierce illapse  Rouzes the mind's whole fabric with supplies  Of daily impulse keeps th' elastic pow'rs  Intensely poiz'd and polishes anew  By that collision all the fine machine  Else rust would rise and foulness by degrees  Incumb'ring choak at last what heav'n design'd  For ceaseless motion and a round of toil  But say does every passion men endure  Thus minister delight That name indeed  Becomes the rosy breath of love becomes  The radiant smiles of joy th' applauding hand  Of admiration but the bitter show'r  That sorrow sheds upon a brother's grave  But the dumb palsy of nocturnal fear  Or those consuming fires that gnaw the heart  Of panting indignation find we there  To move delightThen listen while my tongue  Th' unalter'd will of heav'n with faithful awe  Reveals what old Harmodious wont to teach  My early age Harmodius who had weigh'd  Within his learned mind whate'er the schools  Of wisdom or thy lonelywhisp'ring voice  O faithful nature dictate of the laws  Which govern and support this mighty frame  Of universal being Oft the hours  From morn to eve have stole unmark'd away  While mute attention hung upon his lips  As thus the sage his awful tale began  'Twas in the windings of an ancient wood  When spotless youth with solitude resigns  To sweet philosophy the studious day  What time pale autumn shades the silent eve  Musing I rov'd Of good and evil much  And much of mortal man my thought revolv'd  When starting full on fancy's gushing eye  The mournful image of Parthenia's fate  That hour O long belov'd and long deplor'd  When blooming youth nor gentlest wisdom's arts  Nor Hymen's honours gather'd for thy brow  Nor all thy lover's all thy father's tears  Avail'd to snatch thee from the cruel grave  Thy agonizing looks thy last farewel  Struck to the inmost feeling of my soul  As with the hand death At once the shade  More horrid nodded o'er me and the winds  With hoarser murm'ring shook the branches Dark  As midnight storms the scene of human things  Appear'd before me desarts burning sands  Where the parch'd adder dies the frozen south  And desolation blasting all the west  With rapine and with murder tyrantpow'r  Here sits inthron'd in blood the baleful charms  Of superstition there infect the skies  And turn the sun to horror Gracious heav'n  What is the life of man Or cannot these  Not these portents thy awful will suffice  That propagated thus beyond their scope  They rise to act their cruelties anew  In my afflicted bosom thus decreed  The universal sensitive of pain  The wretched heir of evils not its own  Thus I impatient when at once effus'd  A flashing torrent of coelestial day  Burst thro' the shadowy void With slow descent  A purple cloud came floating thro' the sky  And pois'd at length within the circling trees  Hung obvious to my view till opening wide  Its lucid orb a more than human form  Emerging lean'd majestic o'er my head  And instant thunder shook the conscious grove  Then melted into air the liquid cloud  And all the shining vision stood reveal'd  A wreath of palm his ample forehead bound  And o'er his shoulder mantling to his knee  Flow'd the transparent robe around his waist  Collected with a radiant zone of gold  Aethereal there in mystic signs ingrav'd  I read his office high and sacred name  Genius of human kind Appall'd I gaz'd  The godlike presence for athwart his brow  Displeasure temper'd with a mild concern  Look'd down reluctant on me and his words  Like distant thunders broke the murm'ring air  Vain are thy thoughts O child of mortal birth  And impotent thy tongue Is thy short span  Capacious of this universal frame  Thy wisdom allsufficient Thou alas  Dost thou aspire to judge between the lord  Of nature and his works to lift thy voice  Against the sov'reign order he decreed  All good and lovely to blaspheme the bands  Of tenderness innate and social love  Holiest of things by which the general orb  Of being as with adamantine links  Was drawn to perfect union and sustain'd  From everlasting Hast thou felt the pangs  Of soft'ning sorrow of indignant zeal  So grievous to the soul as thence to wish  The ties of nature broken from thy frame  That so thy selfish unrelenting heart  May cease to mourn its lot no longer then  The wretched heir of evils not its own  O fair benevolence of gen'rous minds  O man by nature form'd for all mankind  He spoke abash'd and silent I remain'd  As conscious of my lips' offence and aw'd  Before his presence tho' my secret soul  Disdain'd the imputation On the ground  I fix'd my eyes till from his airy couch  He stoop'd sublime and touching with his hand  My dazzled forehead Raise thy sight he cry'd  And let thy sense convince thy erring tongue  I look'd and lo the former scene was chang'd  For verdant alleys and surrounding trees  A solitary prospect wide and wild  Rush'd on my senses 'Twas a horrid pile  Of hills with many a shaggy forest mix'd  With many a sable cliff and glitt'ring stream  Aloft recumbent o'er the hanging ridge  The brown woods wav'd while evertrickling springs  Wash'd from the naked roots of oak and pine  The crumbling soil and still at every fall  Down the steep windings of the channel'd rock  Remurm'ring rush'd the congregated floods  With hoarser inundation till at last  They reach'd a grassy plain which from the skirts  Of that high desart spread her verdant lap  And drank the gushing moisture where confin'd  In one smooth current o'er the lilied vale  Clearer than glass it flow'd Autumnal spoils  Luxuriant spreading to the rays of morn  Blush'd o'er the cliffs whose halfincircling mound  As in a sylvan theatre inclos'd  That flow'ry level On the river's brink  I spy'd a fair pavilion which diffus'd  Its floating umbrage 'mid the silver shade  Of osiers Now the western sun reveal'd  Between two parting cliffs his golden orb  And pour'd across the shadow of the hills  On rocks and floods a yellow stream of light  That chear'd the solemn scene My list'ning pow'rs  Were aw'd and every thought in silence hung  And wond'ring expectation Then the voice  Of that coelestial pow'r the mystic show  Declaring thus my deep attention call'd  Inhabitant of earth to whom is giv'n  Inhabitant of earth  c    The account of the oeconomy of providence here introduced as the most proper to calm and satisfy the mind when under the compunction of private evils seems to have come originally from the  Pythagorean  school but of all the ancient philosophers  Plato  has most largely insisted upon it has established it with all the strength of his capacious understanding and ennobled it with all the magnificence of his divine imagination He has one passage so full and clear on the head that I am persuaded the reader will be pleased to see it here tho' somewhat long Addressing himself to such as are not satisfied concerning divine providence  The being who presides over the whole  says he  has dispos'd and complicated all things for the happiness and virtue of the whole every part of which according to the extent of its influence does and suffers what is fit and proper One of these parts is yours O unhappy man which tho' in itself most inconsiderable and minute yet being connected with the universe ever seeks to cooperate with that supreme order You in the mean time are ignorant of the very end for which all particular natures are brought into existence that the allcomprehending nature of the whole may be perfect and happy existing as it does not for your sake but the cause and reason of your existence which as in the symmetry of every artificial work must of necessity concur with the general design of the artist and be subservient to the whole of which it is a part Your complaint therefore is ignorant and groundless since according to the various energy of creation and the common laws of nature there is a constant provision of that which is best at the same time for you and for the wholeFor the governing intelligence clearly beholding all the actions of animated and selfmoving creatures and that mixture of good and evil which diversifies them considering first of all by what disposition of things and what situation of each individual in the general system vice might be depressed and subdued and virtue made secure of victory and happiness with the greatest facility and in the highest degree possible In this manner he order'd thro' the entire circle of being the internal constitution of every mind where should be its station in the universal fabric and thro' what variety of circumstances it should proceed in the whole tenour of its existence  He goes on in his sublime manner to assert a future state of retribution  as well for those who by the exercise of good dispositions being harmonized and assimilated to the divine virtue are consequently removed to a place of unblemish'd sanctity and happiness as of those who by the most flagitious arts have arisen from contemptible beginnings to the greatest affluence and power and whom therefore you look upon as unanswerable instances of negligence in the Gods because you are ignorant of the purposes to which they are subservient and in what manner they contribute to that supreme intention of good to the whole  Plato de Leg x  This theory has been deliver'd of late especially abroad in a manner which subverts the freedom of human actions whereas  Plato  appears very careful to preserve it and has been in that respect imitated by the best of his followers  The gracious ways of providence to learn  Receive my sayings with a stedfast ear  Know then the sov'reign spirit of the world  Tho' selfcollected from eternal time  Within his own deep essence he beheld  The circling bounds of happiness unite  Yet by immense benignity inclin'd  To spread around him that primaeval joy  Which fill'd himself he rais'd his plastic arm  And sounded thro' the hollow depth of space  The strong creative mandate Strait arose  These heav'nly orbs the glad abodes of life  Effusive kindled by his breath divine  Thro' endless forms of being Each inhal'd  From him its portion of the vital flame  In measure such that from the wide complex  Of coexistent orders  one  might rise  One  order allinvolving and intire  one might rise  One order  c    See the meditations of  Antoninus  and the characteristics passim  He too beholding in the sacred light  Of his essential reason all the shapes  Of swift contingence all successives ties  Of action propagated thro' the sum  Of possible existence he at once  Down the long series of eventful time  So fix'd the dates of being so dispos'd  To every living soul of every kind  The field of motion and the hour of rest  That all conspir'd to his supreme design  To universal good with full accord  Answ'ring the mighty model he had chose  The best and fairest of unnumber'd worlds  The best and fairest  c    This opinion is so old that  Timaeus Locrus  calls the supreme being    the artificer of that which is best  and represents him as resolving in the beginning to produce the most excellent work and as copying the world most exactly from his own intelligible and essential idea  so that it yet remains as it was at first perfect in beauty and will never stand in need of any correction or improvement  There is no room for a cauiton here to understand these expressions not of any particular circumstances of human life separately consider'd but of the sum or universal system of life and being See also the vision at the end of the  Theodicée  of  Leibnitz  That lay from everlasting in the store  Of his divine conceptions Nor content  By  one  exertion of creating pow'r  His goodness to reveal thro' every age  Thro' every moment up the tract of time  His parenthand with evernew increase  Of happiness and virtue has adorn'd  The vast harmonious frame his parenthand  From mute shellfish gasping on the shore  To men to angels to coelestial minds  For ever leads the generations on  To higher scenes of being while supply'd  From day to day by his enlivening breath  Inferior orders in succession rise  To fill the void below As flame ascends  As flame ascends  c    This opinion tho' not held by  Plato  or any of the ancients is yet a very natural consequence of his principles But the disquisition is too complex and extensive to be enter'd upon here  As bodies to their proper center move  As the poiz'd ocean to th' attracting moon  Obedient swells and every headlong stream  Devolves its winding waters to the main  So all things which have life aspire to GOD  The sun of being boundless unimpair'd  Center of souls Nor does the faithful voice  Of nature cease to prompt their eager steps  Aright nor is the care of heav'n witheld  From granting to the task proportion'd aid  That in their stations all may persevere  To climb th' ascent of being and approach  For ever nearer to the life divine  That rocky pile thou see'st that verdant lawn  Freshwater'd from the mountains Let the scene  Paint in thy fancy the primaeval seat  Of man and where the will supreme ordain'd  His mansion that pavilion fairdiffus'd  Along the shady brink in this recess  To wear th' appointed season of his youth  Till riper hours should open to his toil  The high communion of superior minds  Of consecrated heroes and of gods  Nor did the sire omnipotent forget  His tender bloom to cherish nor witheld  Coelestial footsteps from his green abode  Oft from the radiant honours of his throne  He sent whom most he lov'd the sov'reign fair  The effluence of his glory whom he plac'd  Before his eyes for ever to behold  The goddess from whose inspiration flows  The toil of patriots the delight of friends  Without whose work divine in heav'n or earth  Nought lovely nought propitious comes to pass  Nor hope nor praise nor honour Her the sire  Gave it in charge to rear the blooming mind  The folded pow'rs to open to direct  The growth luxuriant of his young desires  And from the laws of this majestic world  To teach him what was good As thus the nymph  Her daily care attended by her side  With constant steps her gay companion stay'd  The fair Euphrosyné the gentle queen  Of smiles and graceful gladness and delights  That chear alike the hearts of mortal men  And pow'rs immortal See the shining pair  Behold where from his dwelling now disclos'd  They quit their youthful charge and seek the skies  I look'd and on the flow'ry turf there stood  Between two radiant forms a smiling youth  Whose tender cheeks display'd the vernal flow'r  Of beauty sweetest innocence illum'd  His bashful eyes and on his polish'd brow  Sate young simplicity With fond regard  He view'd th' associates as their steps they mov'd  The younger chief his ardent eyes detain'd  With mild regret invoking her return  Bright as the star of evening she appear'd  Amid the dusky scene Eternal youth  O'er all her form its glowing honours breath'd  And smiles eternal from her candid eyes  Flow'd like the dewy lustre of the morn  Effusive trembling on the placid waves  The spring of heav'n had shed its blushing spoils  To bind her sable tresses full diffus'd  Her yellow mantle floated in the breeze  And in her hand she wav'd a living branch  Rich with immortal fruits of pow'r to calm  The wrathful heart and from the bright'ning eyes  To chase the cloud of sadness More sublime  The heav'nly part'ner mov'd The prime of age  Compos'd her steps The presence of a god  High on the circle of her brow inthron'd  From each majestic motion darted awe  Devoted awe till cherish'd by her looks  Benevolent and meek confiding love  To filial rapture soften'd all the soul  Free in her graceful hand she poiz'd the sword  Of chaste dominion An heroic crown  Display'd the old simplicity of pomp  Around her honour'd head A matron's robe  White as the sunshine streams thro' vernal clouds  Her stately form invested Hand in hand  Th' immortal pair forsook th' enamell'd green  Ascending slowly Rays of limpid light  Gleam'd round their path coelestial sounds were heard  And thro' the fragrant air aethereal dews  Distill'd around them till at once the clouds  Disparting wide in midway sky withdrew  Their airy veil and left a bright expanse  Of empyréan flame where spent and drown'd  Afflicted vision plung'd in vain to scan  What object it involv'd My feeble eyes  Indur'd not Bending down to earth I stood  With dumb attention Soon a female voice  As watry murmurs sweet or warbling shades  With sacred invocation thus began  Father of gods and mortals whose right arm  With reins eternal guides the moving heav'ns  Bend thy propitious ear Behold wellpleas'd  I seek to finish thy divine decree  With frequent steps I visit yonder seat  Of man thy offspring from the tender seeds  Of justice and of wisdom to evolve  The latent honours of his generous frame  Till thy conducting hand shall raise his lot  From earth's dim scene to these aethereal walks  The temple of thy glory But not me  Not my directing voice he oft requires  Or hears delighted this inchanting maid  Th' associate thou hast giv'n me her alone  He loves O father absent her he craves  And but for her glad presence ever join'd  Rejoices not in mine that all my hopes  This thy benignant purpose to fulfil  I deem uncertain and my daily cares  Unfruitful all and vain unless by thee  Still farther aided in the work divine  She ceas'd a voice more awful thus reply'd  O thou in whom for ever I delight  Fairer than all th' inhabitants of heaven  Best image of thy author far from thee  Be disappointment or distaste or blame  Who soon or late shalt every work fulfil  And no resistance find Is man refuse  To hearken to thy dictates or allur'd  By meaner joys to any other pow'r  Transfer the honours due to thee alone  That joy which he pursues he ne'er shall taste  That pow'r in whom delighteth ne'er behold  Go then once more and happy be thy toil  Go then but let not this thy smiling friend  Partake thy footsteps In her stead behold  With thee the son of Nemesis I send  The fiend abhorr'd whose vengeance takes account  Of sacred order's violated laws  See where he calls thee burning to be gone  Fierce to exhaust the tempest of his wrath  On yon devoted head But thou my child  Controul his cruel frenzy and protect  Thy tender charge That when despair shall grasp  His agonizing bosom he may learn  Then he may learn to love the gracious hand  Alone sufficient in that hour of ill  To save his feeble spirit then confess  Thy genuine honours O excelling fair  When all the plagues that wait the deadly will  Of this avenging daemon all the storms  Of night infernal serve but to display  The energy of thy superior charms  With mildest awe triumphant o'er his rage  And shining clearer in the horrid gloom  Here ceas'd that awful voice and soon I felt  The cloudy curtain of refreshing eve  Was clos'd once more from that immortal fire  Shelt'ring my eyelids Looking up I view'd  A vast gigantic spectre striding on  Thro' murm'ring thunders and a waste of clouds  With dreadful action Black as night his brow  Relentless frowns involv'd His savage limbs  With sharp impatience violent he writh'd  As thro' convulsive anguish and his hand  Arm'd with a scorpionlash full oft he rais'd  In madness to his bosom while his eyes  Rain'd bitter tears and bellowing loud he shook  The void with horror Silent by his side  The virgin came No discomposure stirr'd  Her features From the glooms which hung around  No stain of darkness mingled with the beam  Of her divine effulgence Now they stoop  Upon the riverbank and now to hail  His wonted guests with eager steps advanc'd  The unsuspecting inmate of the shade  As when a famish'd wolf that all night long  Had rang'd the Alpine snows by chance at morn  Sees from a cliff incumbent o'er the smoke  Of some lone village a neglected kid  That strays along the wild for herb or spring  Down from the winding ridge he sweeps amain  And thinks he tears him so with tenfold rage  The monster sprung remorseless on his prey  Amaz'd the stripling stood with panting breast  Feebly he pour'd the lamentable wail  Of helpless consternation struck at once  And rooted to the ground The queen beheld  His terror and with looks of tend'rest care  Advanc'd to save him Soon the tyrant felt  Her awful pow'r His keen tempestuous arm  Hung nerveless nor descended where his rage  Had aim'd the deadly blow then dumb retir'd  With sullen rancour Lo the sov'reign maid  Folds with a mother's arms the fainting boy  Till life rekindles in his rosy cheek  Then grasps his hand and chears him with her tongue  O wake thee rouze thy spirit Shall the spite  Of yon tormentor thus appall thy heart  While I thy friend and guardian am at hand  To rescue and to heal O let thy soul  Remember what the will of heav'n ordains  Is ever good for all and if for all  Then good for thee Nor only by the warmth  And soothing sunshine of delightful things  Do minds grow up and flourish Oft misled  By that blind light the young unpractis'd views  Of reason wander thro' a fatal road  Far from their native aim as if to lye  Inglorious in the fragrant shade and wait  The soft access of evercircling joys  Were all the end of being Ask thyself  This pleasing error did it never lull  Thy wishes Has thy constant heart refus'd  The silken fetters of delicious ease  Or when divine Euphrosyné appear'd  Within this dwelling did not thy desires  Hang far below that measure of thy fate  Which I reveal'd before thee and thy eyes  Impatient of my counsels turn away  To drink the soft effusion of her smiles  Know then for this the everlasting  ire  Deprives thee of her presence and instead  O wise and still benevolent ordains  This horrid visage hither to pursue  My steps that so thy nature may discern  Its real good and what alone can save  Thy feeble spirit in this hour of ill  From folly and despair O yet belov'd  Let not this headlong terror quite o'erwhelm  Thy scatter'd pow'rs nor fatal deem the rage  Of this tormentor nor his proud assault  While I am here to vindicate thy toil  Above the generous question of thy arm  Brave by thy fears and in thy weakness strong  This hour he triumphs but confront his might  And dare him to the combat then with ease  Disarm'd and quell'd his fierceness he resigns  To bondage and to scorn while thus inur'd  By watchful danger by unceasing toil  Th' immortal mind superior to his fate  Amid the outrage of external things  Firm as the solid base of this great world  Rests on his own foundations Blow ye winds  Ye waves ye thunders rowl your tempest on  Shake ye old pillars of the marble sky  Till all its orbs and all its worlds of fire  Be loosen'd from their seats yet still serene  Th' unconquer'd mind looks down upon the wreck  And ever stronger as the storms advance  Firm thro' the closing ruin holds his way  Where nature calls him to the destin'd goal  So spake the goddess while thro' all her frame  Coelestial raptures flow'd in every word  In ev'ry motion kindling wrath divine  To seize who listen'd Vehement and swift  As light'ning fires the aromatic shade  In Aethiopian fields the stripling felt  Her inspiration catch his fervid soul  And starting from his languor thus exclaim'd  Then let the trial come and witness thou  If terror be upon me if I shrink  To meet the storm or faulter in my strength  When hardest it besets me Do not think  That I am fearful and infirm of soul  As late thy eyes beheld for thou hast chang'd  My nature thy commanding voice has wak'd  My languid pow'rs to bear me boldly on  Where'er the will divine my path ordains  Thro' toil or peril only do not thou  Forsake me O be thou for ever near  That I may listen to thy sacred voice  And guide by thy decrees my constant feet  But say for ever are my eyes bereft  Say shall the fair Euphrosyné not once  Appear again to charm me Thou in heav'n  O thou eternal arbiter of things  Be thy great bidding done for who am I  To question thy appointment Let the frowns  Of this avenger every morn o'ercast  The chearful dawn and every evening damp  With double night my dwelling I will learn  To hail them both and unrepining bear  His hateful presence but permit my tongue  One glad request and if my deeds may find  Thy awful eye propitious O restore  The rosyfeatur'd maid again to chear  This lonely seat and bless me with her smiles  He spoke when instant thro' the sable glooms  With which that furious presence had involv'd  The ambient air a flood of radiance came  Swift as the light'ningflash the melting clouds  Flew diverse and amid the blue serene  Euphrosyné appear'd With sprightly step  The nymph alighted on th' irriguous lawn  And to her wond'ring audience thus begun  Lo I am here to answer to your vows  And be the meeting fortunate I come  With joyful tidings we shall part no more  Hark how the gentle Echo from her cell  Talks thro' the cliffs and murm'ring o'er the stream  Repeats the accent we shall part no more  O my delightful friends wellpleas'd on high  The father has beheld you while the might  Of that stern foe with bitter trial prov'd  Your equal doings then for ever spake  The high decree that thou coelestial maid  Howe'er that griesly phantom on thy steps  May sometimes dare intrude yet never more  Shalt thou descending to th' abode of man  Alone indure the rancour of his arm  Or leave thy lov'd Euphrosyné behind  She ended and the whole romantic scene  Immediate vanish'd rocks and woods and rills  The mantling tent and each mysterious form  Flew like the pictures of a morning dream  When sunshine fills the bed A while I stood  Perplex'd and giddy till the radiant pow'r  Who bade the visionary landscape rise  As up to him I turn'd with gentlest looks  Preventing my inquiry thus began  There let thy soul acknowledge its complaint  How blind how impious There behold the ways  Of heav'n's eternal destiny to man  For ever just benevolent and wise  That VIRTUE'S awful steps howe'er pursued  By vexing fortune and intrusive PAIN  Should never be divided from her chast  Her fair attendant PLEASURE Need I urge  Thy tardy thought thro' all the

below  The cruel winds have hurl'd upon the coast  Some helpless bark while sacred pity melts  The general eye or terror's icy hand  Smites their distorted limbs and horrent hair  While every mother closer to her breast  Catches her child and pointing where the waves  Foam thro' the shatter'd vessel shrieks aloud  As one poor wretch that spreads his piteous arms  For succour swallow'd by the roaring surge  As now another dash'd against the rock  Drops lifeless down O deemest thou indeed  No kind indearment here by nature giv'n  To mutual terror and compassion's tears  No sweetlymelting softness which attracts  O'er all that edge of pain the social pow'rs  To this their proper action and their end  Ask thy own heart when at the midnight hour  Slow thro' that studious gloom thy

glut the cowardrage  Of regal envy strew the public way  With hallow'd ruins when the muse's haunt  The marble porch where wisdom wont to talk  With Socrates or Tully hears no more  Save the hoarse jargon of contentious monks  Or female superstition's midnight pray'r  When ruthless rapine from the hand of time  Tears the destroying scythe with surer blow  To sweep the works of glory from their base  Till desolation o'er the grassgrown street  Expands his ravenwings and up the wall  Where senates once the price of monarchs doom'd  Hisses the gliding snake thro' hoary weeds  That clasp the

the THIRD  WHAT wonder therefore since th'indearing ties  Of passion link the universal kind  Of man so close what wonder if to search  This common nature thro' the various change  Of sex and age and fortune and the frame  Of each peculiar draw the busy mind  With unresisted charms The spacious west  And all the teeming regions of the south  Hold not a quarry to the curious flight  Of knowledge half so tempting or so fair  As man to man Nor only where the smiles  Of love invite nor only where th' applause  Of cordial honour turns th' attentive eye  On virtue's graceful deeds For since the course  Of things external acts in different ways  On human apprehensions as the hand  Of nature temper'd to a different frame  Peculiar minds so haply where the pow'rs  Of fancy neither lessen nor enlarge  where the pow'rs  Of fancy  c    The influence of the imagination on the conduct of life is one of the most important points in moral philosophy It were easy by an induction of facts to prove that the imagination directs almost all the passions and mixes with almost every circumstance of action or pleasure Let any man even of the coldest head and soberest industry analyse the idea of what he calls his interest he will find that it consists chiefly of certain images of decency beauty and order variously combined into one system the idol which he seeks to injoy by labour hazard and selfdenial It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good otherwise the imagination by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the laws of the moral order  If it be objected that this account of things supposes the passions to be merely accidental whereas there appears in some a natural and hereditary disposition to certain passions prior to all circumstances of education or fortune it may be answer'd that tho' no man is born  ambitious  or a  miser  yet he may inherit from his parents a peculiar temper or complexion of mind which shall render his imagination more liable to be struck with some particular objects consequently dispose him to form opinions of good and ill and entertain passions of a particular turn Some men for instance by the original frame of their minds are more delighted with the vast and magnificent others on the contrary with the elegant and gentle aspects of nature And it is very remarkable that the disposition of the moral powers is always similar to this of the imagination that those who are most inclin'd to admire prodigious and sublime objects in the physical world are also most inclin'd to applaud examples of fortitude and heroic virtue in the moral While those who are charm'd rather with the  delicacy  and  sweetness  of colours and forms and sounds never fail in like manner to yield the preference to the softer scenes of virtue and the sympathies of a domestic life And this is sufficient to account for the objection  Among the ancient philosophers tho' we have several hints concerning this influence of the imagination upon morals among the remains of the  Socratic  school yet the  Stoics  were the first who paid it a due attention  Zeno  their founder thought it impossible to preserve any tolerable regularity in life without frequently inspecting those pictures or appearances of things which the imagination offers to the mind  Diog Laert l  vii The meditations of  M Aurelius  and the discourses of  Epictetus  are full of the same sentiments insomuch that this latter makes the  or  right management of the fancys  the only thing for which we are accountable to providence and without which a man is no other than stupid or frantic  Arrian l  i  c    l  ii  c  See also the Characteristics vol from p to p where this  Stoical  doctrine is embellished with all the eloquence and graces of  Plato  The images of things but paint in all  Their genuine hues the features which they wore  In nature there opinion will be true  And action right For action treads the path  In which opinion says he follows good  Or flies from evil and opinion gives  Report of good or evil as the scene  Was drawn by fancy lovely or deform'd  Thus her report can never there be true  Where fancy cheats the intellectual eye  With glaring colours and distorted lines  Is there a man who at the sound of death  Sees ghastly shapes of terror conjur'd up  And black before him nought but deathbed groans  And fearful pray'rs and plunging from the brink  Of light and being down the gloomy air  An unknown depth Alas in such a mind  If no bright forms of excellence attend  The image of his country nor the pomp  Of sacred senates nor the guardian voice  Of justice on her throne nor aught that wakes  The conscious bosom with a patriot's flame  Will not opinion tell him that to die  Or stand the hazard is a greater ill  Than to  betray  his country And in act  Will he not chuse to be a wretch and live  Here vice begins then From th' inchanting cup  Which fancy holds to all th' unwary thirst  Of youth oft swallows a Circaean draught  That sheds a baleful tincture o'er the eye  Of reason till no longer he discerns  And only guides to err Then revel forth  A furious band that spurn him from the throne  And all is uproar Thus ambition grasps  The empire of the soul thus pale revenge  Unsheaths her murd'rous dagger and the hands  Of lust and rapine with unholy arts  Watch to o'erturn the barrier of the laws  That keeps them from their prey thus all the plagues  The wicked bear or o'er the trembling scene  The tragic muse discloses under shapes  Of honour safety pleasure ease or pomp  Stole first into the mind Yet not by all  Those lying forms which fancy in the brain  Engenders are the kindling passions driv'n  To guilty deeds nor reason bound in chains  That vice alone may lord it oft adorn'd  With solemn pageants folly mounts his throne  And plays her ideotanticks like a queen  A thousand garbs she wears a thousand ways  She wheels her giddy empireLo thus far  With bold adventure to the Mantuan lyre  I sing of nature's charms and touch wellpleas'd  A stricter note now haply must my song  Unbend her serious measure and reveal  In lighter strains how folly's aukward arts  how folly's aukward arts  c    Notwithstanding the general influence of  ridicule  on private and civil life as well as on learning and the sciences it has been almost constantly neglected or misrepresented by divines especially The manner of treating these subjects in the science of human nature should be precisely the same as in natural philosophy from particular facts to investigate the stated order in which they appear and then apply the general law thus discovered to the explication of other appearances and the improvement of useful arts  Excite impetuous laughter's gay rebuke  The sportive province of the comic muse  See in what crouds the uncouth forms advance  Each would outstrip the other each prevent  Our careful search and offer to your gaze  Unask'd his motley features Wait awhile  My curious friends and let us first arrange  In proper orders your promiscuous throng  Behold the foremost band of slender thought  Behold the foremost band  c    The first and most general source of ridicule in the characters of men is vanity or selfapplause for some desirable quality or possession which evidently does not belong to those who assume it  And easy faith whom flatt'ring fancy sooths  With lying spectres in themselves to view  Illustrious forms of excellence and good  That scorn the mansion With exulting hearts  They spread their spurious treasures to the sun  And bid the world admire but chief the glance  Of wishful envy draws their joybright eyes  And lists with selfapplause each lordly brow  In number boundless as the blooms of spring  Behold their glaring idols empty shades  By fancy gilded o'er and then set up  For adoration Some in learning's garb  With formal band and sablecinctur'd gown  And rags of mouldy volumes Some elate  With martial splendour steely pikes and swords  Of costly frame and gay Phoenician robes  Inwrought with flow'ring gold assume the port  Of stately valour list'ning by his side  There stands a female form to her with looks  Of earnest import pregnant with amaze  He talks of deadly deeds of breaches storms  And sulph'rous mines and ambush then at once  Breaks off and smiles to see her look so pale  And asks some wond'ring question of her fears  Others of graver mien behold adorn'd  With holy ensigns how sublime they move  And bending oft their sanctimonious eyes  Take homage of the simpleminded throng  Ambassadors of heav'n Nor much unlike  Is he whose visage in the lazy mist  That mantles every feature hides a brood  Of politic conceits of whispers nods  And hints deepomen'd with unwieldy schemes  And dark portents of state Ten thousand more  Prodigious habits and tumultuous tongues  Pour dauntless in and swell the boastful band  Then comes the second order all who seek  Then comes the second order  c    Ridicule from the same vanity where tho' the possession be real yet no merit can arise from it because of some particular circumstances which tho' obvious to the spectator are yet overlook'd by the ridiculous character  The debt of praise where watchful unbelief  Darts thro' the thin pretence her squinting eye  On some retir'd appearance which belies  The boasted virtue or annulls th' applause  That justice else would pay Here side by side  I see two leaders of the solemn train  Approaching one a female old and grey  With eyes demure and wrinklefurrow'd brow  Pale as the cheeks of death yet still she stuns  The sickning audience with a nauseous tale  How many youths her myrtle chains have worn  How many virgins at her triumphs pin'd  Yet how resolv'd she guards her cautious heart  Such is her terror at the risques of love  And man's seducing tongue The other seems  A bearded sage ungentle in his mien  And sordid all his habit peevish want  Grins at his heels while down the gazing throng  He stalks resounding in magnific phrase  The vanity of riches the contempt  Of pomp and pow'r Be prudent in your zeal  Ye grave associates let the silent grace  Of her who blushes at the fond regard  Her charms inspire more eloquent unfold  The praise of spotless honour let the man  Whose eye regards not his illustrious pomp  And ample store but as indulgent streams  To chear the barren soil and spread the fruits  Of joy let him by juster measure fix  The price of riches and the end of pow'r  Another tribe succeeds deluded long  Another tribe succeeds  c    Ridicule from a notion of excellence in particular objects disproportion'd to their intrinsic value and inconsistent with the order of nature  By fancy's dazzling optics these behold  The images of some peculiar things  With brighter hues resplendent and portray'd  With features nobler far than e'er adorn'd  Their genuine objects Hence the fever'd heart  Pants with delirious hope for tinsel charms  Hence oft obtrusive on the eye of scorn  Untimely zeal her witless pride betrays  And serious manhood from the tow'ring aim  Of wisdom stoops to emulate the boast  Of childish toil Behold yon mystic form  Bedeck'd with feathers insects weeds and shells  Not with intenser brow the Samian sage  Bent his fix'd eye on heav'n's eternal fires  When first the order of that radiant scene  Swell'd his exulting thought than this surveys  A muckworm's entrails or a spider's fang  Next him a youth with flow'rs and myrtles crown'd  Attends that virgin form and blushing kneels  With fondest gesture and a suppliant's tongue  To win her coy regard adieu for him  The dull ingagements of the bustling world  Adieu the sick impertinence of praise  And hope and action for with her alone  By streams and shades to steal the sighing hours  Is all he asks and all that fate can give  Thee too facetious Momion wandring here  Thee dreaded censor oft have I beheld  Bewilder'd unawares alas too long  Flush'd with thy comic triumphs and the spoils  Of sly derision till on every side  Hurling thy random bolts offended truth  Assign'd thee here thy station with the slaves  Of folly Thy once formidable name  Shall grace her humble records and be heard  In scoffs and mock'ry bandied from the lips  Of all the vengeful brotherhood around  So oft the patient victims of thy scorn  But now ye gay to whom indulgent fate  But now ye gay  c    Ridicule from a notion of excellence where the object is absolutely odious or contemptible This is the highest degree of the ridiculous as in the affectation of diseases or vices  Of all the muse's empire hath assign'd  The fields of folly hither each advance  Your sickles here the teeming soil affords  Its richest growth A fav'rite brood appears  In whom the daemon with a mother's joy  Views all her charms reflected all her cares  At full repay'd Ye most illustrious band  Who scorning reason's tame pedantic rules  And order's vulgar bondage never meant  For souls sublime as yours with generous zeal  Pay vice the rev'rence virtue long usurp'd  And yield deformity the fond applause  Which beauty wont to claim forgive my song  That for the blushing diffidence of youth  It shuns the unequal province of your praise  Thus far triumphant in the pleasing guile  Thus far triumphant  c    Ridicule from false shame or groundless fear  Of bland imagination folly's train  Have dar'd our search but now a dastardkind  Advance reluctant and with fault'ring feet  Shrink from the gazer's eye infeebled hearts  Whom fancy chills with visionary fears  Or bends to servile tameness with conceits  Of shame of evil or of base defect  Fantastic and delusive Here the slave  Who droops abash'd when sullen pomp surveys  His humbler habit here the trembling wretch  Unnerv'd and froze with terror's icy bolts  Spent in weak wailings drown'd in shameful tears  At every dream of danger here subdued  By frontless laughter and the hardy scorn  Of old unfeeling vice the abject soul  Who blushing half resigns the candid praise  Of temperance and honour half disowns  A freeman's hatred of tyrannic pride  And hears with sickly smiles the venal mouth  With foulest licence mock the patriot's name  Last of the motley bands on whom the pow'r  Last of the  c  Ridicule from the ignorance of such things as our circumstances require us to know  Of gay derision bends her hostile aim  Is that where shameful ignorance presides  Beneath her sordid banners lo they march  Like blind and lame Whate'er their doubtful hands  Attempt confusion strait appears behind  And troubles all the work Thro' many a maze  Perplex'd they struggle changing every path  O'erturning every purpose then at last  Sit down dismay'd and leave th'entangled scene  For scorn to sport with Such then is th'abode  Of folly in the mind and such the shapes  In which she governs her obsequious train  Tho' every scene of ridicule in things  To lead the tenour of my devious lay  Thro' every swift occasion which the hand  Of laughter points at when the mirthful sting  Distends her sallying nerves and choaks her tongue  What were it but to count each crystal drop  Which morning's dewy fingers on the blooms  Of May distill Suffice it to have said  suffice it to have said  c    By comparing these general sources of ridicule with each other and examining the ridiculous in other objects we may obtain a general definition of it equally applicable to every species The most important circumstance of this definition is laid down in the lines referr'd to but others more minute we shall subjoin here  Aristotle  's account of the matter seems both imperfect and false  says he    the ridiculous is some certain fault or turpitude without pain and not destructive to its subject    Poetic c  v  For allowing it to be true as it is not that the ridiculous is never accompany'd with pain yet we might produce many instances of such a fault or turpitude which cannot with any tolerable propriety be called ridiculous So that the definition does not distinguish the thing defined Nay farther even when we perceive the turpitude tending to the destruction of its subject we may still be sensible of a ridiculous appearance till the ruin become imminent and the keener sensations of pity or terror banish the ludicrous apprehension from our minds For the sensation of ridicule is not a bare perception of the agreement or disagreement of ideas but a passion or emotion of the mind consequential to that perception So that the mind may perceive the agreement or disagreement and yet not feel the ridiculous because it is engrossed by a more violent emotion Thus it happens that some men think those objects ridiculous to which others cannot endure to apply the name because in them they excite a much intenser and more important feeling And this difference among other causes has brought a good deal of confusion into this question  That which makes objects ridiculous is some ground of admiration or esteem connected with other more general circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed or it is some circumstance of turpitude or deformity connected with what is in general excellent or beautiful the inconsistent properties existing either in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate belonging always to the same order or class of being implying sentiment or design and exciting no acute or vehement emotion of the heart  To prove the several parts of this definition  The appearance of excellence or beauty connected with a general condition comparatively sordid or deformed  is ridiculous for instance pompous pretensions to wisdom join'd with ignorance and folly in the  Socrates  of  Aristophanes  and the applause of military glory with cowardice and stupidity in the  Thraso  of  Terence  The appearance of deformity or turpitude in conjunction with what is in general excellent or venerable  is also ridiculous for instance the personal weaknesses of a magistrate appearing in the solemn and public functions of his station  The incongruous properties may either exist in the objects themselves or in the apprehension of the person to whom they relate  in the lastmention'd instances they both exist in the objects in the instance from  Aristophanes  and  Terence  one of them is objective and real the other only founded in the apprehension of the ridiculous character  The inconsistent properties must belong to the same order or class of being  A coxcomb in fine cloaths bedaubed by accident in foul weather is a ridiculous object because his general apprehension of excellence and esteem is referr'd to the splendour and expence of his dress A man of sense and merit in the same circumstances is not counted ridiculous because the general ground of excellence and esteem in him is both in fact and in his own apprehension of a very different species  Every ridiculous object implies sentiment or design  A column placed by an architect without a capital or base is laugh'd at the same column in a ruin causes a very different sensation  And lastly  the occurrence must excite no acute or vehement emotion of the heart  such as terror pity or indignation for in that case as was observ'd above the mind is not at leisure to contemplate the ridiculous  Whether any appearance not ridiculous be involved in this description and whether it comprehend every species and form of the ridiculous must be determined by repeated applications of it to particular instances  Where'er the pow'r of ridicule displays  Her quaintey'd visage some incongruous form  Some stubborn dissonance of things combin'd  Strikes on the quick observer whether pomp  Or praise or beauty mix their partial claim  Where sordid fashions where ignoble deeds  Where foul deformity are wont to dwell  Or whether these with violation loath'd  Invade resplendent pomp's imperious mien  The charms of beauty or the boast of praise  Ask we for what fair end  Ask we for what fair end  c    Since it is beyond all contradiction evident that we have a  natural  sense or feeling of the ridiculous and since so good a reason may be assign'd to justify the supreme being for bestowing it one cannot without astonishment reflect on the conduct of those men who imagine it is for the service of true religion to vilify and blacken it without distinction and endeavour to persuade us that it is never applied but in a bad cause Ridicule is not concerned with meer speculative truth or falsehood It is not in abstract propositions or theorems but in actions and passions good and evil beauty and deformity that we find materials for it and all these terms are  relative  implying approbation or blame To ask then  whether ridicule be a test of truth  is in other words to ask whether that which is ridiculous can be  morally true  can be just and becoming or whether that which is just and becoming can be ridiculous A question that does not deserve a serious answer For it is most evident that as in a metaphysical proposition offer'd to the understanding for its assent the faculty of reason examines the terms of the proposition and finding one idea which was supposed equal to another to be in fact unequal of consequence rejects the proposition as a falsehood so in objects offer'd to the mind for its esteem or applause the faculty of ridicule feeling an incongruity in the claim urges the mind to reject it with laughter and contempt When therefore we observe such a claim obtruded upon mankind and the inconsistent circumstances carefully concealed from the eye of public it is our business if the matter be of importance to society to drag out those latent circumstances and by setting them full in view convince the world how ridiculous the claim is and thus a double advantage is gained for we both detect the  moral falsehood  sooner than in the way of speculative inquiry and impress the minds of men with a stronger sense of the vanity and error of its authors And this and no more is meant by the application of ridicule  But it is said the practice is dangerous and may be inconsistent with the regard we owe to objects of real dignity and excellence I answer the practice fairly managed can never be dangerous men may be dishonest in obtruding circumstances foreign to the object and we may be inadvertent in allowing those circumstances to impose upon us but the sense of ridicule always judges right the  Socrates  of  Aristophanes  is as  truly  ridiculous a character as ever was drawnTrue but it is not the character of  Socrates  the divine moralist and father of ancient wisdom What then did the ridicule of the poet hinder the philosopher from detecting and disclaiming those foreign circumstances which he had falsely introduced into his character and thus rendering the satirist doubly ridiculous in his turn No but it nevertheless had an ill influence on the minds of the people And so has the reasoning of  Spinoza  made many atheists he has founded it indeed on suppositions utterly false but allow him these and his conclusions are unavoidably true And if we must reject the use of ridicule because by the imposition of false circumstances things may be made to seem ridiculous which are not so in themselves why we ought not in the same manner to reject the use of reason because by proceeding on false principles conclusions will appear true which are impossible in nature let the vehement and obstinate declaimers against ridicule determine  th' almighty sire  In mortal bosoms wakes this gay contempt  These grateful stings of laughter from disgust  Educing pleasure Wherefore but to aid  The tardy steps of reason and at once  By this prompt impulse urge us to depress  The giddy aims of folly Tho' the light  Of truth slowdawning on th' inquiring mind  At length unfolds thro' many a subtile tie  How these uncouth disorders end at last  In public evil yet benignant heav'n  Conscious how dim the dawn of truth appears  To thousands conscious what a scanty pause  From labours and from care the wider lot  Of humble life affords for studious thought  To scan the maze of nature therefore stampt  The glaring scenes with characters of scorn  As broad as obvious to the passing clown  As to the letter'd sage's curious eye  Such are the various aspects of the mind  Some heav'nly genius whose unclouded thoughts  Attain that secret harmony which blends  Th' aethereal spirit with its mold of clay  O teach me to reveal the grateful charm  That searchless nature o'er the sense of man  Diffuses to behold in lifeless things  The inexpressive semblance  The inexpressive semblance  c    This similitude is the foundation of almost all the ornaments of poetic diction  of himself  Of thought and passion Mark the sable woods  That shade sublime yon mountain's nodding brow  With what religious awe the solemn scene  Commands your steps as if the reverend form  Of Minos or of Numa should forsake  Th' Elysian seats and down th' imbow'ring glade  Move to your pausing eye Behold th' expanse  Of yon gay landscape where the silver clouds  Flit o'er the heav'ns before the sprightly breeze  Now their grey cincture skirts the doubtful sun  Now streams of splendor thro' their opening veil  Effulgent sweep from off the gilded lawn  Th' aerial shadows on the curling brook  And on the shady margin's quiv'ring leaves  With quickest lustre glancing while you view  The prospect say within your chearful breast  Plays not the lively sense of winning mirth  With clouds and sunshine chequer'd while the round  Of social converse to th' inspiring tongue  Of some gay nymph amid her subjecttrain  Moves all obsequious Whence is this effect  This kindred pow'r of such discordant things  Or flows their semblance from that mystic tone  To which the newborn mind's harmonious pow'rs  At first were strung Or rather from the links  Which artful custom twines around her frame  For when the diff'rent images of things  By chance combin'd have struck th' attentive soul  With deeper impulse or connected long  Have drawn her frequent eye howe'er distinct  Th' external scenes yet oft th' ideas gain  From that conjunction an eternal tie  And sympathy unbroken Let the mind  Recall one partner of the various league  Immediate lo the firm confed'rates rise  And each his former station strait resumes  One movement governs the consenting throng  And all at once with rosy pleasure shine  Or all are sadden'd with the glooms of care  'Twas thus if ancient fame the truth unfold  Two faithful needles from th' informing touch  Two faithful needles  c    See the elegant poem recited by Cardinal  Bembo  in the character of  Lucretius    Strada Prolus  vi  Academ    c    Of the same parentstone together drew  Its mystic virtue and at first conspir'd  With fatal impulse quiv'ring to the pole  Then tho' disjoin'd by kingdoms tho' the main  Rowl'd its broad surge betwixt and diff'rent stars  Beheld their wakeful motions yet preserv'd  The former friendship and remember'd still  Th' alliance of their birth whate'er the line  Which one possess'd nor pause nor quiet knew  The sure associate ere with trembling speed  He found its path and fix'd unerring there  Such is the secret union when we feel  A song a flow'r a name at once restore  Those longconnected scenes where first they mov'd  Th' attention backward thro' her mazy walks  Guiding the wanton fancy to her scope  To temples courts or fields with all the band  Of painted forms of passions and designs  Attendant whence if pleasing in itself  The prospect from that sweet accession gains  Redoubled influence o'er the list'ning mind  By these mysterious ties the busy pow'r  By these mysterious ties  c    The act of remembring seems almost wholly to depend on the association of ideas  Of mem'ry her ideal train preserves  Intire or when they would elude her watch  Reclaims their fleeting footsteps from the waste  Of dark oblivion thus collecting all  The various forms of being to present  Before the curious aim of mimic art  Their largest choice like spring's unfolded blooms  Exhaling sweetness that the skillful bee  May taste at will from their selected spoils  To work her dulcet food For not th' expanse  Of living lakes in summer's noontide calm  Reflects the bord'ring shade and sunbright heav'ns  With fairer semblance not the sculptur'd gold  More faithful keeps the graver's lively trace  Than he whose birth the sisterpow'rs of art  Propitious view'd and from his genial star  Shed influence to the seeds of fancy kind  Than his attemper'd bosom must preserve  The seal of nature There alone unchang'd  Her form remains The balmy walks of May  There breathe perennial sweets the trembling chord  Resounds for ever in th' abstracted ear  Melodious and the virgin's radiant eye  Superior to disease to grief and time  Shines with unbating lustre Thus at length  Indow'd with all that nature can bestow  The child of fancy oft in silence bends  O'er these mix'd treasures of his pregnant breast  With conscious pride From them he oft resolves  To frame he knows not what excelling things  And win he knows not what sublime reward  Of praise and wonder By degrees the mind  Feels her young nerves dilate the plastic pow'rs  Labour for action blind emotions heave  His bosom and with loveliest frenzy caught  From earth to heav'n he rolls his daring eye  From heav'n to earth Anon ten thousand shapes  Like spectres trooping to the wisard's call  Fleet swift before him From the womb of earth  From ocean's bed they come th' eternal heav'ns  Disclose their splendors and the dark abyss  Pours out her births unknown With fixed gaze  He marks the rising phantoms Now compares  Their diff'rent forms now blends them now divides  Inlarges and extenuates by turns  Opposes ranges in fantastic bands  And infinitely varies Hither now  Now thither fluctuates his inconstant aim  With endless choice perplex'd At length his plan  Begins to open Lucid order dawns  And as from Chaos old the jarring seeds  Of nature at the voice divine repair'd  Each to its place till rosy earth unveil'd  Her fragrant bosom and the joyful sun  Sprung up the blue serene by swift degrees  Thus disentangled his entire design  Emerges Colours mingle features join  And lines converge the fainter parts retire  The fairer eminent in light advance  And every image on its neighbour smiles  A while he stands and with a father's joy  Contemplates Then with Promethéan art  Into its proper vehicle he breathes  Into its proper vehicle  c    This relates to the different sorts of corporeal mediums by which the ideas of the artist are rendered palpable to the senses as by sounds in music by lines and shadows in painting by diction in poetry  c  The fair conception which imbodied thus  And permanent becomes to eyes or ears  An object ascertain'd while thus inform'd  The various organs of his mimic skill  The consonance of sounds the featur'd rock  The shadowy picture and impassion'd verse  Beyond their proper pow'rs attract the soul  By that expressive semblance while in sight  Of nature's great original we scan  The lively child of art while line by line  And feature after feature we refer  To that sublime exemplar whence it stole  Those animating charms Thus beauty's palm  Betwixt 'em wav'ring hangs applauding love  Doubts where to chuse and mortal man aspires  To tempt creative praise As when a cloud  Of gath'ring hail with limpid crusts of ice  Inclos'd and obvious to the beaming sun  Collects his large effulgence strait the heav'ns  With equal flames present on either hand  The radiant visage Persia stands at gaze  Appall'd and on the brink of Ganges waits  The snowyvested seer in Mithra's name  To which the fragrance of the south shall burn  To which his warbled orisons ascend  Such various bliss the welltun'd heart injoys  Favour'd of heav'n While plung'd in sordid cares  Th' unfeeling vulgar mocks the boon divine  And harsh austerity from whose rebuke  Young love and smiling wonder shrink away  Abash'd and chill of heart with sager frowns  Condemns the fair inchantment On my strain  Perhaps ev'n now some cold fastidious judge  Casts a disdainful eye and calls my toil  And calls the love and beauty which I sing  The dream of folly Thou grave censor say  Is beauty then a dream because the glooms  Of dullness hang too heavy on thy sense  To let her shine upon thee So the man  Whose eye ne'er open'd on the light of heav'n  Might smile with scorn while raptur'd vision tells  Of the gay colour'd radiance flushing bright  O'er all creation From the wise be far  Such gross unhallow'd pride nor needs my song  Descend so low but rather now unfold  If human thought could reach or words unfold  By what mysterious fabric of the mind  The deepfelt joys and harmony of sound  Result from airy motion and from shape  The lovely phantoms of sublime and fair  By what fine ties hath GOD connected things  When present in the mind which in themselves  Have no connection Sure the rising sun  O'er the caerulean convex of the sea  With equal brightness and with equal warmth  Might rowl his fiery orb nor yet the soul  Thus feel her frame expanded and her pow'rs  Exulting in the splendor she beholds  Like a young conqu'ror moving thro' the pomp  Of some triumphal day When join'd at eve  Softmurm'ring streams and gales of gentlest breath  Melodious Philomela's wakeful strain  Attemper could not man's discerning ear  Thro' all its tones the symphony pursue  Nor yet this breath divine of nameless joy  Steal thro' his veins and fan th'awaken'd heart  Mild as the breeze yet rapt'rous as the song  But were not nature still indow'd at large  With all which life requires tho' unadorn'd  With such inchantment Wherefore then her form  So exquisitely fair her breath perfum'd  With such aethereal sweetness Whence her voice  Inform'd at will to raise or to depress  Th' impassion'd soul and whence the robes of light  Which thus invest her with more lovely pomp  Than fancy can describe Whence but from thee  O source divine of everflowing love  And thy unmeasur'd goodness Not content  With every food of life to nourish man  By kind illusions of the wond'ring sense  Thou mak'st all nature beauty to his eye  Or music to his ear wellpleas'd he scans  The goodly prospect and with inward smiles  Treads the gay verdure of the painted plain  Beholds the azure canopy of heav'n  And living lamps that overarch his head  With more than regal splendor bends his ears  To the full choir of water air and earth  Nor heeds the pleasing error of his thought  Nor doubts the painted green or azure arch  Nor questions more the music's mingling sounds  Than space or motion or eternal time  So sweet he feels their influence to attract  The fixed soul to brighten the dull glooms  Of care and make the destin'd road of life  Delightful to his feet So fables tell  Th' advent'rous heroe bound on hard exploits  Beholds with glad surprize by secret spells  Of some kind sage the patron of his toils  A visionary paradise disclos'd  Amid the dubious wild with streams and shades  And airy songs th' enchanted landscape smiles  Chears his long labours and renews his frame  What then is taste but these internal pow'rs  Active and strong and feelingly alive  To each fine impulse a discerning sense  Of decent and sublime with quick disgust  From things deform'd or disarrang'd or gross  In species This nor gems nor stores of gold  Nor purple state nor culture can bestow  But GOD alone when first his active hand  Imprints the secret byass of the soul  He mighty parent wise and just in all  Free as the vital breeze or light of heav'n  Reveals the charms of nature Ask the swain  Who journeys homeward from a summer day's  Long labour why forgetful of his toils  And due repose he loiters to behold  The sunshine gleaming as thro' amber clouds  O'er all the western sky full soon I ween  His rude expression and untutor'd airs  Beyond the pow'r of language will unfold  The form of beauty smiling at his heart  How lovely how commanding But tho' heav'n  In every breast hath sown these early seeds  Of love and admiration yet in vain  Without fair culture's kind parental aid  Without inlivening suns and genial show'rs  And shelter from the blast in vain we hope  The tender plant should rear its blooming head  Or yield the harvest promis'd in its spring  Nor yet will every soil with equal stores  Repay the tiller's labour or attend  His will obsequious whether to produce  The olive or the laurel Diff'rent minds  Incline to different objects one pursues  The vast alone the wonderful the wild  One pursues  The vast alone  c    See the note to ver of this book  Another sighs for harmony and grace  And gentlest beauty Hence when lightning fires  The arch of heav'n and thunders rock the ground

blest of heav'n whom not the languid songs  Of luxury the Siren not the bribes  Of sordid wealth nor all the gaudy spoils  Of pageant honour can seduce to leave  Those everblooming sweets which from the store  Of nature fair imagination culls  To charm th' inliven'd soul What tho' not all  Of mortal offspring can attain the heights  Of envied life tho' only few possess  Patrician treasures or imperial state  Yet nature's care to all her children just  With richer treasures and an ampler state  Indows at large whatever happy man  Will deign to use them His the city's pomp  The rural honours

tribute from her wings  And still new beauties meet his lonely walk  And loves unfelt attract him Not a breeze  Not a breeze  c    That this account may not appear rather poetically extravagant than just in philosophy it may be proper to produce the sentiment of one of the greatest wisest and best of men on this article one so little to be suspected of partiality in the case that he reckons it among those favours for which he was especially thankful to the gods that they had not suffered him to make any great proficiency in the arts of eloquence and poetry lest by that means he should have been diverted from pursuits of more importance to his high station Speaking of the beauty of universal nature he observes that  there is a pleasing and graceful aspect in every object we perceive    when once we consider its connection with that general order He instances in many things which at first sight would be thought rather deformities and then adds  that a man who enjoys a sensibility of temper with a just comprehension of the universal orderwill discern many amiable things not credible to every mind but to those alone who have entered into an honourable familiarity with nature and her works  M Antonin iii  Flies o'er the meadow not a cloud imbibes  The setting sun's effulgence not a strain  From all the tenants of the warbling shade  Ascends but whence his bosom can partake  Fresh pleasure unreprov'd Nor thence partakes  Fresh pleasure only for th' attentive mind  By this harmonious action on her pow'rs  Becomes herself harmonious wont so long  In outward things to meditate the charm  Of sacred order soon she seeks at home  To find a kindred order to exert  Within herself this elegance of love  This fairinspir'd delight her temper'd pow'rs  Refine at length and every passion wears  A chaster milder more attractive mien  But if to ampler prospects if to gaze  On nature's form where negligent of all  These lesser graces she assumes the port  Of that eternal majesty that weigh'd  The world's foundations if to these the mind  Exalt her daring eye then mightier far  Will be the change and nobler Would the forms  Of servile custom cramp her generous pow'rs  Would sordid policies the barb'rous growth  Of ignorance and rapine bow her down  To tame pursuits to indolence and fear  Lo she appeals to nature to the winds  And rowling waves the sun's unwearied course  The elements and seasons all declare  For what th' eternal maker has ordain'd  The pow'rs of man we feel within ourselves  His energy divine he tells the heart  He meant he made us to behold and love  What he beholds and loves the general orb  Of life and being to be great like him  Beneficent and active Thus the men  Whom nature's works can charm with GOD himself  Hold converse grow
