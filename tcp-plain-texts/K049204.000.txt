 THE IMPARTIAL AN ADDRESS without FLATTERY BEING A POET's Free Thoughts ON THE Situation  of our  PUBLIC AFFAIRS ANNO  LONDON  Printed for M COOPER in  Paternoster Row  M DCC XLIV  TO THE GREAT ORIGINAL Of the Following PICTURE  MY LORD  _THAT I decline the Honour of attending with at least one  honest Address  is from some Hazard there might be of your mistaking the true Motive of it Free from all Ambition to make One among the Worshippers of your  Fortune  I present you and at Distance too a bare Confession of your  Virtues  TO know the Writer of this Piece can be of no Importance to your Lordship He lies too low to merit a great Minister's Inquiry It will please the Public better that he knows YOU rightly and that he does so he appeals to the Poem  HE is too well acquainted with the modern Turn of Sentiment in some who for a few Years must be  called  Great Men to look for any present Consequence from  Poetry  where even the Best finds more Contempt than due  Discernment  But at the same time he knows that this is One among the Faults of bad Administration which a Soul like Yours came qualified to think  worth mending  And we might have had more Certainty that you would do it had you been as pleased with your own Profit as the Public's since the clearest Interest is  His  in every Honour done the  Muses  who is born for Actions of a Pitch  above the Spirit  of cold Writers  I HAVE nothing more to trouble you with except the warm and just good Wishes of  Your  LORDSHIP  's  quondam  Schoolfellow And One of your sincerest Humble Servants  IGNOTUS  THE IMPARTIAL AN ADDRESS without FLATTERY  _ARE these the Marks then of our promis'd  Shame  Or did Detraction steal the Patriot's Name  Weak if we were how rose we now so strong  Or whence if pow'rful were we scorn'd so long  Burn sooty Slander burn thy blotted Scroll  Greatness is Greatness spite of Faction's  Soul  I GAZE astonish'd Kingdom o'er thy Face  And each weigh'd Wonder to its Fountain trace  Glory flows in where Infamy was spread  And longlost Triumph lifts her tow'ry Head  Warm o'er the icy  North  thy influent Awe  Bids hostile Leagues  dissolve  in friendly Thaw  Up  Rhine's  long Stream  Britannic  Thunders winde  And  Alpine  Mountains shakeand States behind  Austria's  plum'd Eagle beak'd and wing'd once more  Sees baffled  Bourbon  driv'n from Shore to Shore  Seashook  Ausonia  red

deserted and by Foes inclos'd  Fills the World's Eye dispels the  Doubter's  Care  Bids the Bold tremble and the Backward dare  High to the Nations points their  Guardian's  Throne  And acts and arbitrates and shines  alone  AND have such Fires inflam'd a patient Reign  Immortal Heav'n and must we still  complain  Still must we rail and blacken and suspect  At once curb Vigilance and  goad  Neglect  Deep let my Soul detest th'  adhesive  Pride  That changing Sentiment unchanges Side  True to Contempt of Truth repents within  Yet screens Conviction and  strains hard  to sin  SHAME on this Craft to  scare  this Toil to  seem  O Heart indignant fly th'unmanly Scheme  Blush for thy past Injustice shrink no more  But wakeand wonder thou wert dark before  Learn from  whose Hand  th'unlook'dfor Effluence came  And in the Teeth of Insult  sound his Name  WHAT tho' some Friend thou lov'st had narrower Sight  Truth knows no  Parties  and involves like  Light  Shadows and Names

Prejudice  has taught his Part  Born for a Slave wears Fetters on his  Heart  Sees undiscerning feels without his Touch  Judges too littleand decides too much  POETS have nobler Souls Fame's Paths
