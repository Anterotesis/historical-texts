 ANNA ST IVES  A NOVEL  BY THOMAS HOLCROFT  VOLUME I  LONDON PRINTED FOR SHEPPERSON AND REYNOLDS NO OXFORDSTREET  M DCC XCII  ANNA ST IVES  A NOVEL  LETTER I  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  WenbourneHill  HERE are we my dear girl in the very height of preparation We begin our journey southward at five tomorrow morning We shall make a short stay in London and then proceed to Paris Expectation is on tiptoe my busy fancy  has pictured to itself Calais Montreuil Abbeville in short every place which the book of post roads enumerates and some of which the divine Sterne has rendered so famous I expect to find nothing but mirth vivacity fancy and multitudes of people I have read so much of the populousness of France the gaiety of its inhabitants the magnificence of its buildings its fine climate fertility numerous cities superb roads rich plains and teeming vineyards that I already imagine myself journeying through an enchanted land  I have another pleasure in prospect Pray have you heard that your brother is soon to be at Paris on his return from ItalyMy father surprised me by informing me we should probably  meet him in that capital I suspect Sir Arthur of an implication which his words perhaps will not authorize but he asked me rather significantly if I had ever heard you talk of your brother and in less than five minutes wished to know whether I had any objections to marriage  My father is exceedingly busy with his head man his plotter his planner giving directions concerning still further improvements that are to be made in his grounds and park during our absence You know his mania Improvement is his disease I have before hinted to you that I do not like this factotum of his this Abimelech Henley The amiable qualities of his son more than compensate for the meanness of the father  whom I have long suspected to be and am indeed convinced that he is artful selfish and honest enough to seek his own profit were it at the expence of his employer's ruin He is continually insinuating new plans to my father whom he Sir Arthurs and Honours and Nobles at every word and then persuades him the hints and thoughts are all his own The illiterate fellow has a language peculiar to himself energetic but half unintelligible compounded of a few fine phrases and an inundation of proverbial wisdom and uncouth cant terms Of the scanty number of polite words which he has endeavoured to catch he is very bountiful to Sir Arthur  That's noble That's great your noble honour Well by my truly  that's an  elegunt ideer  But I always said your honour had more  nobler  and  elegunter ideers  than any other noble gentleman knight lord or dooke in every thing of what your honour calls the grand gusto  Pshaw It is ridiculous in me to imitate his language the cunning nonsense of which evaporates upon paper but is highly characteristic when delivered with all its attendant bows and cringes which like the accompaniments to a concerto enforce the character of the composition and give it full effect  I am in the very midst of bandboxes portmanteaus packingcases and travelling trunks I scarcely ever knew a mind so sluggish as not to feel a certain degree of rapture at the thoughts of  travelling It should seem as if the imagination frequently journeyed so fast as to enjoy a species of ecstasy when there are any hopes of dragging the cumbrous body after its flights  I cannot banish the hints of Sir Arthur from my busy fancyI must not I ought not to practise disguise with any one much less with my Louisa and I cannot but own that his questions suggested a plan of future happiness to my mind which if realized would be delightful The brother of my dear Louisa the chosen friend of my heart is to be at Paris I shall meet him there He cannot but resemble his sister He cannot but be all generosity love expansion mind soul I am determined to have a very sincere friendship for him  nay I am in danger of falling in love with him at first sight Louisa knows what I mean by falling in love Ah my dear friend if he be but half equal to you he is indeed a matchless youth Our souls are too intimately related to need any nearer kindred and yet since marry I must as you emphatically tell me it will some time be my duty to do I could almost wish Sir Arthur's questions to have the meaning I suspect and that it might be to the brother of my friend  Do not call me romantic if romance it be it originates in the supreme satisfaction I have taken in contemplating the powers and beauties of my Louisa's mind Our acquaintance has been but short yet our friendship appears as if it  had been eternal Our hearts understand each other and speak a language which alas we both have found to be unintelligible to the generality of the world  Once more adieu You shall hear from me again at London Direct to me as usual in Grosvenor Street  Ever and ever your A W ST IVES  P S  I am sorry to see poor Frank Henley look so dejected He has many good nay I am well persuaded many great qualities Perhaps he is disappointed at not being allowed to go with us for which I know he petitioned his father but was refused otherwise I  could easily have prevailed on Sir Arthur to have consented  I am determined to take King Pepin  A goldfinch which the young lady had so named  with me It is surely the most intelligent of all animals the unfeathered bipeds as the French wits call us twolegged mortals excepted But no wonder it was my Louisa's gift and kissing her lips imbibed a part of her spirit Were I to leave it behind me cats and other good for nothing creatures would teach it again to be shy and suspicious and the present charming exertion of its little faculties would decay The developement of mind even in a bird has something in it highly delightful  Why my Louisa my friend my sister ah why are not you with me Why do you not participate my pleasures catch with me the rising ideas and enjoy the raptures of novelty But I will forbear I have before in vain exhausted all my rhetoric You must not will not quit a languishing parent and I am obliged to approve your determination though I cannot but regret the consequence  LETTER II  LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES  Rose Bank  HEALTH joy and novelty attend the steps of my ever dear and charming Anna May the whirling of your chariot wheels bring a succession of thoughts as exhilarating as they are rapid May gladness hail you through the day and peace hush you to sleep at night May  the hills and valleys smile upon you as you roll over and beside them and may you meet festivity and fulness of content at every step  I too have my regrets My heart is onehalf with you nay my beloved my generous mamma has endeavoured to persuade me to quit her arguing that the inconvenience to her would be more than compensated by the benefit accruing to myself The dear lady I sincerely believe loves you if possible better than she does me and pleaded strenuously But did she not know it was impossible she should prevail She did If my cares can prolong a life so precious but half an hour is it not an age Do not her virtues and her wisdom communicate themselves to all around  her Are not her resignation her fortitude and her cheerfulness in pain lessons which I might traverse kingdoms and not find an opportunity like this of learning And affection out of the question having such high duties to perform must I fly from such an occasion afflicting though it be No Anna St Ives herself must not tempt me to that She is indeed too noble seriously to form such a wish Answer is she not  Oh that I may be deceived but I fear you expect too much from my brother Oh that he might be worthy of my Anna Not for my own sake for as she truly says we That is our fouls for I know of no other we We cannot be more akin but for his own  He is the son of my beloved mother and most devoutly do I wish he might be found deserving of her and you He would then be more deserving than any man at least any young man I have ever known Though brother and sister he and I may be said to have but little acquaintance He has always been either at school or at college or in town or on his travels or in some place where I did not happen to be except for short intervals I have told you that his person is not displeasing that his temper appears to be prompt and daring but gay and that his manners I doubt are of that free kind which our young gentlemen affect  To say the truth however I have heard much in favour of Coke Clifton  but then it has generally been either from persons whose good word was in my opinion no praise or from others who evidently meant to be civil to me or to the family by speaking well of my brother I believe him to have much pride some ambition a high sense of fashionable honour that he spurns at threats disdains reproof and that he does not want generosity or those accomplishments which would make him pass with the world for a man whose alliance would be desirable But the husband of my Anna you perceive I have caught your tone and use the word husband as familiarly as if there were any serious intention of such an event and as if it were any thing more than the sportive effusion of fancy or rather the momentary  expansion of friendship the husband of my Anna ought to be more infinitely more than what the world understands by such phrases if it can be said to understand anything Forgive the jingle but to pair with her he ought to be her peer And yet if she wait till time shall send her such a one and that one every way proper for her alliance in her father's opinion as well as in her own I am afraid her chance of marriage will be infinitely small  Were I but assured that Coke Clifton would be as kind and as worthy a husband to Anna St Ives as any other whom it were probable accident should ever throw in her way I should then indeed seriously wish such a thought might be something more than the transient  flight of fancy But enough You are on the wing to the city where you and he will probably meet Examine him well forget his sister be true to yourself and your own judgment and I have no fear that you should be deceived If he prove better even than a sister's hopes he will find in me more than a sister's love  I like Sir Arthur's favourite Abimelech Henley still less than you do My fears indeed are rather strong When once a taste for improvement I mean building and gardening improvement becomes a passion gaming itself is scarcely more ruinous I have no doubt that Sir Arthur's fortune has suffered and is suffering severely and that while that miserly wretch Abimelech is destroying  the fabric he is purloining and carrying off the best of the materials I doubt whether there be an acre of land in the occupation of Sir Arthur which has not cost ten times its intrinsic value to make it better It is astonishing how Sir Arthur can be pardon the expression my dear such a dupe I have before blamed and must again blame you for not exerting yourself sufficiently to shew him his folly It concerns the family it concerns yourself nearly Who can tell how far off the moment is when it may be too late My mamma has just heard of a new mortgage in procuring of which the worthy Abimelech acted or pretended to act as agent for I assure you I suspect he was really the principal During my last visit if I do not mistake I  several times saw the pride of wealth betraying itself and only subdued by the superior thirst of gain  Poor Frank Henley Is it not miraculous that such a father should have such a son I am tempted to give utterance to a strange thought Why should I not What is the opinion of the world what are its prejudices in the presence of truth Yet not to respect them is to entail upon ourselves I know not what load of acrimony contempt and misery I must speakI never yet met a youth whom I thought so deserving of Anna St Ives as Frank Henley The obstacles you will say are insurmountable Alas I fear they are And therefore 'tis fortunate that the same thought has not more strongly occurred  to you Perhaps my caution would have been greater but that I know your affections are free and yet I confess I wonder that they are so If it be the effect of your reason the praise you merit is infinite and I hope and believe it is for notwithstanding all the tales I have heard and read my mind is convinced of nothing more firmly than that the passion of love is as capable of being repressed and conquered as any other passion whatever and you know we have both agreed that the passions are all of them subject to reason when reason is sufficiently determined to exert its power  I have written a long letter but writing to you I never know when to end  Heaven bless my Anna St Ives  LOUISA CLIFTON  LETTER III  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  WenbourneHill  OLIVER I am wretched The feeble Frank Henley is a poor miserable being The sun shines the birds warble the flowers spring the buds are bursting into bloom all nature rejoices yet to me this mirth this universal joy seems mockeryWhy is this Why do  I suffer my mind thus to be pervaded by melancholy Why am I thus steeped in gloom  She is goingThursday morning is the time fixedAnd what is that to meMadman that I amWho am I Does she can she ought she to think of meAnd why not Am I not a man and is she more than mortalShe is She isShew me the mortal who presumes to be her equal  But what do I wish What would I have Is it my intention or my desire to make her wretched What Sink her whom I adore in the estimation of the world and render her the scoff of the foolish the vain and the malignantII make her wretchedI  Oliver she treats me with indifference  cold calm killing indifference Yet kind heavenly kind even in her coldness Her cheerful eye never turns from me nor ever seeks me To her I am a statueWould I were Why does she not hate me Openly and absolutely hate meAnd could I wish her to love Do I love Do I Dare I Have I the temerity so much as to suspect I loveWho am I The insignificant son of  And who is she The daughter of a BaronetPshaw What is a BaronetAway with such insolent such ridiculous distinctions She is herself Let Folly and Inferiority keep their distance  But ILow bred and vulgar let Pride and Error call me but not villain I the seducer of men's daughters Noble  men and still nobler daughters I Why would I be so very vile a thing Would I if I could  Yet who shall benumb the understanding chain up the fancy and freeze sensation Can I command myself deaf when she sings dead when she speaks or rush into idiotism to avoid her enchantments  Despise me Oliver if thou wilt but the deep sense I have of my own folly does but increase the distemper of my brain She herself pities me yet does not suspect my disease 'Tis evident she does not for her soul is above artifice She kindly askedwas I not well I owned I was not quite so cheerful as I could wish to be and wouldst thou think it was presumptuous enough to hint that  I thought the enlivening air of France might do me good Thou seest how frantic I am She answered with the utmost ease and without the most distant suspicion of my selfish my audacious motive that she would speak to Sir Arthur But I was obliged to request her to forbear till I had first tried to gain my father's consent of which indeed I had but feeble hopes  Every way miserable why am I obliged to think and speak of my father with so little respect Indeed he isWell wellHe is my fatherI am convinced he is become wealthy nay indeed he gives me to understand as much when he wishes to gain any purpose by endeavouring to excite avarice in me  which he hopes is and perhaps supposes must be mine and every man's ruling passion Yet no he cannot his complaints of me for the want of it are too heartfelt too bitter  He has kept me in ignorance as much as was in his power Reading writing and arithmetic is his grand system of education after which man has nothing more to learn except to get and to hoard money Had it not been for the few books I bought and the many I borrowed together with the essential instruction which thy excellent father's learning and philanthropy enabled and induced him to give me I should probably have been as illiterate as he could have wished A son after his own heart  One of his most frequent and most passionate reproaches is  the time I  waste  in reading  I scarcely need tell thee he was almost in a rage at my request to accompany Sir Arthur to France stating as I did that it ought to be and must be at his expence Otherwise he cares but little where I go being rather regarded by him as a spy on his actions than as his son Thou canst not conceive the contempt with which he treats me for my want of cunning He despises my sense of philanthropy honour and that severe probity to which no laws extend He spurns at the possibility of preferring the good of society to the good of selfBut once again he is my father  Prithee lend me thy Petrarch and  send it in return by Thomas I had nothing to say though I have written so much except to ask for this book and to burden thee with my complaints Remember me kindly to thy most worthy father and all the family Thine  F HENLEY  LETTER IV  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London Grosvenor Street  OH Louisa I have such a narrative Such accidents Such But you shall hear  We are arrived and thank God and good fortune are all alive which every thing considered is no small consolation The chaise was at the door punctually at  five on Thursday morning Abimelech Henley had been very busy with Sir Arthur over night and was in close conference with him again previous to our departure  Frank too was there as disconsolate and as attentive as ever active and watchful that every thing was as it should be How the difference between soul and soul discovers itself in such scenes I very much fear his father treats him unkindly and that he grieves more than he ought nay more than a person of his youth strong form and still stronger mind could be supposed to grieve I understand he very much laments the loss of a college education which the miser his father could very well have bestowed upon him had not  his heart been as contracted as the mouth of his purse  Mr Trenchard luckily for Frank early discovered his genius and gratuitously aided him in his studies Frank reveres him as a more than father and loves his son Oliver like a brother He is but too sensible that a true father feeds the mind and that he who only provides for the body is no better than a stepfather I have some fear that there is another cause for his dissatisfaction and that he has cherished some silly thoughts of an impossible nature If so an effort must be made which I hope will restore him to reason And yet what right have I to conclude that he reasons erroneously Have I sufficiently examined This is a question which has several times lately  forced itself upon my mind I am not insensible of his high worth it opens upon me daily What I am going to relate will picture that worth better than any praise of mine I will therefore continue my narrative  Every thing being adjusted off we went I Laura and Sir Arthur in the chaise and one footman only with us who was to ride before as our courier and prepare horses  I told you of my intention to take King Pepin with me but the morning of our departure was all hurry and it seldom happens that something is not forgotten amid the tumult into which the passions seem to plunge as it were with delight gratified with the confusion which themselves create I must own I  was vexed and offended with myself when I found that the something overlooked on this occasion was the gift of my Louisa Ingratitude with all its reproaches rose up to sting me and I immediately resolved to punish myself by informing my Louisa how unworthy I am of the gifts of such a friend It was at the first stage where we changed horses that I made this discovery One moment I was inclined to petition Sir Arthur to stay while a messenger should be sent but the next I determined that my fault should incur its due pains and penalties  Every thing was ready but just as we had seated ourselves in the chaise and were again proceeding on our journey one of the servants of the inn called  to Sir Arthur to stop for young Mr Henley was coming up full speed on the bay mare Frank and the bay mare are both famous through the whole country My father immediately prognosticated some bad accident and I began to be alarmed Our fears however were soon dissipated his only errand being to bring my charming favourite  I confess I was not a little moved by this mark of attention which indeed is but one among many as well as by the peculiarity of the youth's manner in delivering the bird He was fearful visibly fearful that his desire to oblige should be thought officious He attempted to apologize but knew not what to say I thanked him very sincerely and in the kindest manner I could  and seeing him booted the thought instantly struck me to request Sir Arthur's permission for him to accompany us to London which I imagined might give him pleasure  The request happened to coincide with some new project of alteration which Sir Arthur had conceived and which he said after having further digested he could better communicate to Frank than describe on paper The mare is said to be one of the best travellers in the kingdom and as she was very capable of performing the journey and the carriage being rather heavily loaded he accordingly kept pace with us  During the day we passed many delightful scenes and enjoyed the charming prospects which the rich cultivation  of England and the road we travelled afford Frank Henley was scarcely ever out of sight though he was rather watchfully assiduous than communicative  Sir Arthur for his part did not forget to point out to us what a charming park such and such grounds might be turned into how picturesque a temple or a church steeple would look in this place what a fine effect a sheet of water would have in that bottom and how nobly a clump of trees would embellish the hill by which it was overlooked  I believe I am a sad wicked girl Louisa I was once strangely tempted to tell him I was much afraid his father had mistaken the trade to which his genius was best adapted when he made him a baronet instead of a gardener  However I had the grace to bite my tongue and be silent He might have had the retort courteous upon me and have replied that gardening was much the most honourable trade of the two But he would never have thought of that answer  Thus the day as I tell you passed pleasantly and whimsically enough But the night OhThe nightYou shall hear  It was the dusk of evening when we were at Maidenhead We had then three stages to go and Sir Arthur began to be alarmed by the rumours of depredations which had lately been committed on the road I really do not know what to say to it but there appears to be something deeper in the doctrine of sympathies  than such silly girls as I can either account for or comprehend I endeavoured with all my might to oppose the sensation and yet I found my father's fears were catching Frank Henley indeed begged of me with great energy not to be alarmed for that he would die sooner than I should be insulted Upon my honour Louisa he is a gallant youthYou shall hearBut he is a brave a gallant youth  I cannot say but I wished I were a man though I am convinced it was a foolish wish and that it is a great mistake to suppose courage has any connexion with sex if we except as we ought the influence of education and habit My dear mother had not the bodily strength of Sir Arthur but with respect to cool  courage and active presence of mind I must say Louisa there was no comparison  We set off however Frank having first provided himself with a hanger and a pair of pistols and he now kept close to the chaisedoor without once quitting his station I believe Sir Arthur was heartily glad at being thus provided with a guard as it were unexpectedly and without any foresight of his own For not to mention gold watches and trinkets he had more money with him than he would have chosen to have lost fright out of the question  We proceeded thus without molestation as far as Brentford but not without receiving fresh hints that it was very possible we might be visited and then  though it began to be drawing toward midnight Sir Arthur thought the danger chiefly over As it happened he was mistaken He was indeed my dear I assure you I could tremble now with the thoughts of it but that my womanhood forbids I remember how valiant I have been in laughing at the pretty fears of pretty ladies with their salts hartshorn fits and burnt feathers Beside I would not have my Louisa think too meanly of me Yet I assure you it was a terrible night  We had just passed the broad part of Turnham Green as Frank has since told me and were near the end of a lane which strikes into the Uxbridge road when the postillion was stopped by one highwayman while almost at the same  instant another dashed his pistol through the sideglass into the chaise full in Sir Arthur's face  Frank was on my sideNotwithstanding the length of the journey he seemed to infuse his own ardour into the spirited animal on which he rode and was round instantaneouslyIt was really dreadfulThe highwayman saw or rather heard him coming for it was prodigiously dark and fired Poor Frank was shotIn the shoulderBut he says he did not feel it at firstHe returned the fire and the highwayman exclaimed with a shocking oath "I am a dead man" He rode away however full speed and his associate who stood to guard the postboy rode after him Frank imagines that owing to the darkness of the night  and his being so close under the chaise they had not perceived him when they came to the attack  But here let me tell you for I am sure I ought our protector our hero is not dangerously wounded He indeed makes very light of it but I am persuaded he would do that if he had lost an arm The moment the highwaymen were gone he rode round to me to intreat me not to be alarmed for that all was safe  Imagine whether I did not thank him and bless him at least in ejaculation Imagine what I felt after what I  had  heard at hearing him talk to me and at being convinced that he was actually alive I had not the least suspicion of his being wounded he spoke so cheerfully  yet I naturally enquired if he were hurt His answer was"No noNot  hurt"  But he spoke with an emphasis that immediately raised my apprehensions I repeated my question"Are you sure you are not hurt not wounded" He could not say no to that and therefore answered"He believed he felt a slight contusion in the shoulder but that he was convinced it was trifling"  I was now seized with a fit of terror much greater in effect than my former panic I fervently intreated Sir Arthur to let the servant take the bay mare and ride for help I begged urgently violently for God's sake that he would take my place in the chaise I would mount  the mare myself I would do any thing All the replies I could get were still more vehement intercessions from Frank Henley that I would not be alarmed assurances that there was not the least danger the most obstinate determination not to quit his post and notwithstanding the pain which he could not but feel a persisting to reload the discharged pistol and then to proceed  I know not myself how my fears were so far pacified as to yield to this except that his energy seemed to overpower mine Indeed I suffered dreadfully the rest of the way I knew the youth's generous spirit and my imagination was haunted with the idea that the blood was flowing every foot of the road and that  he would rather drop from the horse than be subdued It is impossible indeed it is to tell you what I felt  At last we arrived in Grosvenor Street and sure enough the poor fellow was faint with the loss of blood "My God"said I to Sir Arthur when the light was brought and I saw him"Send for a surgeon Good Heavens Run Somebody run for help"He still insisted he was but slightly hurt and began to resume all his earnestness to quiet me Sir Arthur did it more effectually by sending as I desired and by telling me that if I continued to agitate by contending with him so much I might very possibly throw him into a fever and make a wound which most probably was not in itself dangerous mortal  I said not another word except seriously and solemnly requesting him to calm his mind for his own sake if not for mine for that after being wounded in defence of me and my father to die by my fault were dreadful indeed He retired with more apparent satisfaction in his countenance than I think I ever saw before  I was resolved however not to go to bed till I had received some account from the surgeon He came the wound was examined and word was immediately sent me by the express command of Frank who had been told I was sitting up for that purpose that there was as he had assured me no danger The surgeon indeed thought proper to qualify it with no  great  danger It is an old remark  that surgeons are not prone to speak too lightly of the miracles they perform This short syllable great did not fail however to disturb me very considerably I waited till the ball was extracted and Would you believe it brought us for I insisted upon seeing it Sir Arthur called me a mad girl adding there was no ruling me I persisted in questioning and crossexamining the surgeon till I was convinced that as he said there was no  great  danger and I then retired to rest that is I retired to the same swimming motion which the chaise had communicated to my nerves or my brain or I know not what and to dreaming of swords pistols murdered men and all the horrid ramblings of the fancy under such impressions  To convince me how trifling the hurt was the gallant Frank insisted the next day on coming down to dinner though he was allowed to eat nothing but chicken broth and a light pudding I never saw him so lively His only present danger of death he said was by famine and complained jocularly of the hardship of fasting after a long journey I could almost have persuaded him to eat for indeed he is a brave a noble youth  I know I never need apologize to my Louisa for the length of my letters How can we enjoy equal pleasure to that of thus conversing in despite of distance and though separated by seas and mountains Indeed it is a kind of privation to end but end I mustthereforeAdieu  A W ST IVES  LETTER V  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  London Grosvenor Street  YOU did not expect dear Oliver to receive a letter from me dated at this distance By the luckiest accident in the world I have been allowed to accompany her thus far have ridden all day with my eye fixed upon her and at night have had the ecstatic pleasure to defend to fight for her Perhaps have  saved her life Have been wounded for herWould I had been killedWas there ever so foolish so wrong so romantic a wish And yet it has rushed involuntarily upon me fifty times To die for her seems to be a bliss which mortal man cannot merit Truth severe truth perhaps will not justify these effusions I will I do endeavour to resist themIndeed I am ashamed of myself for I find I am very feeble Yet let not thy fears be too violent for thy friend he will not lightly desert his duty  Let me tell thee before I proceed that my wound is slightWe were stopped by a couple of highwaymen Thou never wert a witness of such angelic sensibility as the divine creature discovered when she found I had received  some hurt She alarmed me beyond description by the excess of her feelings Oh She has a soul alive to all the throbs of humanity It shoots and shivers in every veinThen too when we arrived when candles were brought I had bled somewhat freely and I suppose looked rather pale thou hast no conception of it is impossible to conceive the energy with which she insisted on sending for the best and most immediate help  We had another battle of sensibility for I assure thee I was almost as much Did I not know her I should say more alarmed for her as she could be for me  Yet do not imagine I am fool enough to flatter myself with any false hopes  No it was humanity it was too deep a sense of a slight benefit received it was totally distinct from loveOh no Love added to such strong such acute sensations surely Oliver it would have shrieked would have fainted would have diedHer fears and feelings were powerful I grant but they were all social and would have been equally awakened for any creature whom she had known and had equal cause to esteem And she esteems all who hav but the smallest claims to such respect even meDid I tell thee it was she who petitioned Sir Arthur to lay his commands on me to attend them to London knowing I wished it and that this was in return for the trifling favour I had done her in galloping after her  with her favourite bird Oh She is all benignity All grace All angel  Never did I feel such raptures as since I have received this fortunate this happy woundYet whyIs not her heart exactly what it was It is I should be an idiot not to perceive it is Strange contradiction Hopeless yet happyBut it is a felicity of short duration  Would it were possible for me to accompany her to France My restless foreboding imagination has persuaded me she will be in danger the moment she is from under my protection Vain fool Who what am IBecause a couple of dastardly highwaymen have galloped away at the first report of a  pistol my inflated fancy has been busy in persuading me that I am her hero  Yet I wish I might go with her Tell me Oliver wouldst not thou wish so too Would not all the world wish the same Didst thou ever in thy life behold her without feelings unusual throbs doubts desires and fears wild incoherent yet deriving ecstasy from that divinity which irradiates her form and beams on every object around herDoThink me a poor raving lovesick blockhead And yet it is true All I have said of her and infinitely more is true Thou nor the world cannot disprove it Would I might go with her  I have seen the fellow with whom I had the rencounter His wound is much more severe than mine Sir Arthur sent information to the office in Bow Street Wouldst thou think a highwayman could be so foolish a coxcomb as to rob in a bright scarlet coat and to ride a light grey horse The bloodhunters I am sorry that our absurd our iniquitous laws oblige me to call them so the bloodhunters soon discovered the wounded man Forty pounds afforded a sufficient impulse They were almost ready to quarrel with me because I did not choose to swear as heartily as they thought proper to prompt Thou knowest how I abhor the taking away the life of man instead of seeking his reformation  After persisting that it was impossible for me to identify the person of the highwayman as indeed it really was and luckily prevailing on Sir Arthur to do the same though he like most folks who have any thing to lose was convinced it would be an excellent thing if all rogues could be instantly hanged like dogs out of the way I paid the poor wretch a visit privately and gave him such a lecture as I should hope he would not easily forget It was not all censure soothing reasoning and menace were mingled My greatest effort was to convince him of the folly of such crimes he had received fome proof of the danger He was in great pain and did not think his life quite secure He promised reformation with all the apparent  fervour of sincerity prayed for me blessed me very heartily and praised me for my bravery He says the Bow Street runners will leave nothing unattempted to secure the reward and take away his life I have therefore engaged to hire a lodging and bring a hackney coach for him myself at seven in the morning the hour least likely for him to be watched or traced I believe I was more earnest to prevent harm happening to him than he himself was for having met a man upon the stairs whose physiognomy dress and appearance led me to suspect him I questioned my penitent who owned it was his accomplice a determined fellow according to his account an Irish gambler whose daring character led  him after a run of ill luck to this desperate resource It was with some difficulty I could persuade him the fellow might betray him and join the Bow Street people The gambler as he says expects a supply and has promised him money But he has consented to leave his lodging and I think I have convinced him of the folly danger and guilt of such connections  I found he was poor and except a few shillings left him the trifle of money which I had endeavouring by every means to restore a lost wretch to virtue and society The fellow was not flint The tears gushed into his eyes and I own I came away with hopes that my efforts had not been wholly ineffectual  I have written by the first post that thou mayst know what is become of me Farewell  F HENLEY  LETTER VI  LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES  Rose Bank  I HAVE only time for a single line but I cannot forbear to tell you how great the emotions have been which I felt my dear Anna at reading your last Ten thousand thanks

Street  FRANK HENLEY's accident has necessarily delayed our journey for a fortnight nay it was within an ace of being delayed for ever and Would you think it possible by the artful remonstrances of this Abimelech Henley I have been obliged to exert all my influence and all my rhetoric upon Sir  Arthur or it would have been entirely given up Rapacious and narrow in his own plans this wretch this  honest Aby  as my father calls him would not willingly suffer a guinea to be spent except in improvements that is not a guinea which should not pass through his hands A letter from him to Sir Arthur has been the cause of this contest  I hope however my dear that Sir Arthur's affairs are not in so bad a train as your fears expressed in your letter of the third cause you to imagine Should they be so what will become of my brother A mere man of fashion Active in the whole etiquette of visiting dressing driving riding fencing dancing gaming writing cards of compliment  and all the frivolous follies of what by this class of people is called  the world  but indolent in or more properly incapable of all useful duties  I stand rather high in his opinion and he has done me the honour to consult me lately on a family affair The Edgemoor estate of eight hundred per annum is entailed on him as the heir of St Ives by my grandfather's will with right of possession at the age of twentyfour Sir Arthur I suppose does not find it convenient to abridge his income so materially and has been endeavouring to persuade him that it is his duty and interest not to insist upon possession at least for the present My brother is not pleased with the proposal and has complaisantly written to ask my  opinion with an evident determination to follow his own he having now almost completed his twentyfourth year My answer was an attempt I fear a vain one to call to his mind the true use of money and unless he should have found the art of employing it worthily I advised him to shew his filial affection and oblige Sir Arthur  I can prophesy however that he will have no forbearance Not to mention debts he has too many imaginary and impatient wants to submit to delay Neither have I any great desire that he should being convinced that the want of money is the only impediment that can put a stop to Sir Arthur's improvements  But this honest AbyThe same post that brought me your letter of the  eleventh  This and other letters are occasionally omitted as not containing any new information  brought one for Sir Arthur and while I was meditating on the contents of yours and not a little chagrined at the confirmation of your intelligence concerning the mortgageChagrined that my father should be the instrument the tool of such a fellow chagrined that his family should be in danger and himself made a jestwhile I was considering what were the best means if there were any of inducing Sir Arthur to abandon projects so foolish and so fatal Laura came running with the news that our journey to France was all over that orders to that effect had been given and that a chaise was to be  at the door in an hour to take Sir Arthur back to WenbourneHill  This incident in my then temper of mind produced its full effect I knew Sir Arthur's way I knew he would not willingly see me himself and immediately suspecting that his letter was from honest Aby I determined if possible he should not escape me He was in his own room and how to draw him out An hour would soon be gone I therefore employed an artifice which on after recollection I am convinced was wrong very wrong I went into the drawingroom and bade the footman go to him and announce Miss Wenbourne I have a maiden aunt of that name whom I was christened after who lives in London and whom I believe  you never saw The trick succeeded and Sir Arthur came into the drawingroom He looked disconcerted at seeing me and the following dialogue began  Heydey Anna Where is your aunt  Sir I am afraid I have done an unjustifiable thing My conscience then first smote me with a conviction that what I had persuaded myself was a defensible artifice was neither more nor less than a direct falsehood which of all crimes you know I think one of the most mean hateful and pernicious The just confusion I felt had nearly ruined my cause  WhyWhatWhat do you meanWhere is your aunt  She is not here sir It was I who wished to speak to you  You And send in your aunt's name  My name is Wenbourne sir  Your name is St Ives miss  I feel sir how exceedingly culpable I am and perhaps do not deserve that you should pardon me My father began to suspect the reason of my wishing to speak with him and did not know whether good nature or ill would serve his cause the best I perceived him cast an eye toward the door  This is extraordinaryVery extraordinary upon my soul  I saw it was time to recover my spirits I have heard something which I scarcely can believe to be true sir  What have you heard What have you heard  That you are going back to WenbourneHill  Well what then  And that you do not intend we should visit France  Who told you so  The servants have orders to that effect  The servants are a parcel of busy blockheads  What can have occasioned you sir to change your opinion so suddenly  My affairs He looked again toward the door but he felt it was too late and that he must now either defend or abandon his cause The journey will be too expensive  If sir the journey would in the least embarrass your affairs and if I did not daily see you entering into expences so  infinitely greater than this I would not answer a word to such an argument I think it my duty to be as careful of your property as you yourself could be and for that reason have often wished I could prevail on you in some measure to alter your plans  I have no doubt miss of your prodigious wisdom you remind me of it daily Your plans to be sure would as you say be infinitely better than mine When you are married or I am dead you may do as you please but in the mean time suffer me to act for myself I do not choose to be under tutelage  I am sorry my dear papa to see that I offend you but indeed I mean the very reverse Indeed I do It is my  zeal for your interest my love of you I ventured to take his hand that oblige me to speak  And plainly to tell me you do not approve of my proceedings  Plainly to tell you the truth because I believe it to be my duty  Upon my word A very dutiful daughter I thought the duty of children was to obey the wills of their parents  ObediencePardon my sincerity sirObedience must have limits Children should love and honour their parents for their virtues and should cheerfully and zealously do whatever they require of them which is not in itself wrong  Of which  children  are to judge  Yes sir of which children are to judge  A fine system of obedience truly  They cannot act without judging more or less be they obedient or disobedient and the better they judge the better will they perform their duty There may be and there have been mistaken parents who have commanded their children to be guilty even of crimes  And what is that to me Upon my word you are a very polite young lady A very extraordinarily polite miss  God forbid my dear papa that you should imagine I think you one of those parents  I really don't know nor don't care  madam what you think meMy plans indeedDisapproved by you  If I saw any person under a dangerous mistake misled wronged preyed upon by the selfinterested should I not be indolent or cowardly nay should I not be criminal if I did not endeavour to convince such a person of his error And what should I be if this person were my father  Upon my honour miss you take intolerable liberties The license of your tongue is terrible  It were better sir that I should subject myself to your displeasure and make you think unkindly of me than that others who pretend to be your servants and your humble but friendly advisers  should injureshouldI know not what We have often heard of stewards who have acted the mortgagee to their own masters This hint was a thunder stroke Sir Arthur was wholly disconcerted His mind apparently made several attempts to recover itself but they were all ineffectual  Well wellI II know what the meaning of all this is YouYou are vexed at being disappointed of your journeyBut make yourself easy child you shall go you shan't be disappointed  'Tis true sir I wish to visit Paris but not if it will be in the least inconvenient to you in money affairs Though I own I should indeed be vexed to see the small sum you had appropriated for  this journey wrested from you to throw up a hill or build a fantastic temple in some place where its very situation would render it ridiculous  Upon my wordWas ever the like of this heardDon't I tell you you shall go  Indeed sir going is but a small part of the subject there is another point which if I could but gain would give me infinitely more pleasure  Pshaw Girl I can't stay to argue points with you now I tell you you shall go I give you my word you shall go and so let's have no more of itDo you hear Anna I am too old to be schooled I don't like it Mind me I don't like it  I am very sorry sir that I cannot  find words to speak the truth which would be less offensive  I tell you again there is no truth to be spoken Have not I promised you shall go There's an end of the business You shall go  And away went Sir Arthur apparently happy to get rid both of me and himself that is of the disagreeable ideas which as he thought I had so impertinently raised You blamed me in your last for not exerting myself sufficiently to shew him his folly You see the sufficiently is still wanting Perhaps I have not discovered the true mode of addressing myself to Sir Arthur's passions For though my remonstrances have often made him uneasy I cannot perceive that they have ever produced  conviction And yet I should suppose that a certain degree of momentary conviction must be the result of such conversations But the fortitude to cast off old habits and assume new is beyond the strength of common mortals  Frank Henley is a favourite with you and very deservedly But in answer to the surprise in your former my dear that he has never engaged my affections as well as to the cautionary kind hints in your two last for so I understand them let me say that had I imagined love to be that unconquerable fatality of which I have been speaking I do not know what might have happened but having been early convinced that a union between him and me must be attended with I know not what scenes of wretchedness  in short knowing the thing in a certain sense to be impossible it has always been so considered by me and therefore I have no reason to think myself in any danger Doubts occasionally rise in my mind but in general soon disappear Should they return I will not conceal them  I remember it was a remark of yours that "Admiration is the mother of love" So it is of love such as I bear to my Louisa and of such perhaps as angels might be supposed to bear to angels I admire Frank Henley greatly ardently admire him yet I certainly do not love that is I certainly do not permit myself to feel any of those anxieties alarms hopes fears perturbations and endearments which we are told are inseparable from  that passion I extinguish I suffocate them in their birth  I am called for Adieu my ever dear Louisa  A W ST IVES  LETTER IX  SIR ARTHUR ST IVES TO ABIMELECH HENLEY  London Grosvenor Street  I HAVE received your letter good Abimelech and own your reasoning has its force Much is yet to be done to WenbourneHill Year after year I have said"This shall be the last we will now bring affairs to a finish" But improvement is my delight walking  talking sitting standing or lying waking or sleeping I can think of nothing else We live you know honest Aby only to amend so that instead of concluding I find more things to do at present than ever  I have the wilderness very much at heart but the soil is excellent and I scarcely know Aby how we shall make the land sufficiently barren Yet it would have a fine effect Yes that it certainly would and we will try our utmost The hermitage too at the far end The mossgrown cell Aby With a few scattered eglantines and wild roots We will plant ivy round the three old oaks and bring a colony of owls to breed Then at the bottom of all a grotto Oh it will be delicious  Shells will be expensive for we are not within forty miles of the sea But no matter it must and it shall be done for I have set my heart on it Nay from what you said to me honest Aby knowing you to be a careful thrifty fellow full of foresight I was so warm in the cause that I had determined to take your advice and renounce or defer the journey to France but the blabbing servants got a hint of the matter and it came to my daughter's ears So for peace and quietness sake I think I must e'en indulge her and take her a short trip to the continent But we will go no further than the neighbourhood of Paris Beside I wish for my own part to see how the country is laid out I am desirous to  know whether all France has any thing to equal WenbourneHill  And yet Aby I find it is impossible to please every body You know what continual improvements I have been making for these last twenty years for you have superintended them all I have planted one year and grubbed up the next built and pulled down dug and filled up again removed hills and sent them back to their old stations and all from a determination to do whatever could be done And now I believe there are no grounds in all England so wooded and shut in as those of WenbourneHill notwithstanding its situation on a very commanding eminence We are surrounded by coppices groves  espaliers and plantations We have excluded every vulgar view of distant hills intervening meadows and extensive fields with their insignificant green herbage yellow lands and the wearisome eternal waving of standing corn  And yet Aby after having done all this comes me Sir Alexander Evergreen and very freely tells me that we have spoiled WenbourneHill buried ourselves in gloom and darkness and shut out the finest prospects in all England Formerly the hall could be seen by travellers from the road and we ourselves had the village church in view all of which we have now planted out of sight Very true but instead of the parish steeple have we not steeples of our own in every direction And instead of  the road with the Gloucestershire hills and lessening clouds in perspective have we not the cedar quincunx Yet see the curse of obstinacy and want of taste Would you think it Aby Of this Sir Alexander complains  It is in vain to tell him that we are now all within ourselves that every body is surprised to see how snug we are and that nobody can suspect so many temples and groves and terraces and ascents and descents and clumps and shrubberies and vistas and glades and dells and canals and statues and rocks and ruins are in existence till they are in the very midst of them And then Oh how have I enjoyed their admiration Nothing is so great a pleasure to me as to bring a gentleman of taste who knows  how to be struck with what he sees and set him down in the middle of one of my great gravel walks For all the world allows Abimelech that our gravel walks at WenbourneHill are some of the broadest the straightest and the finest in the kingdom  Yet observe how men differ Abimeech Sir Alexander wants me to turf them over He says that where you may have the smooth verdure gravel walks are ridiculous and are only tolerable in common pathways where continual treading would wear away the greensward But I know what has given him such a love for the soft grass Sir Alexander is gouty and loves to tread on velvet  Beside he is a cynic He blames all  we have done and says he would render one of the deserts of Arabia the garden of Eden with the money we have wasted in improving WenbourneHill which he affirms before we touched it was one of the most beautiful spots in the three kingdoms  I confess Aby that if as I said I did not know him to be a cynic I should be heartily vexed But it either is or at any rate it shall be one of the most beautiful spots in the three kingdoms ay or in the whole world Of that I am resolved so go on with your work Abimelech Do not be idle The love of fame is a noble passion and the name of Arthur St Ives shall be remembered at WenbourneHill long after his remains are laid in their kindred clay as the poet says  I desired your son Frank to accompany us to London He is a spirited young fellow and behaved well on the road where he had an affair with a highwayman and got a slight wound but he is in no danger He is a fine fellow a brave fellow and an honour to you honest Aby  Some grounds which I saw on my journey with water purling meandering and occasionally dashing down a steep declivity or winding along a more gentle descent as it happened to be suggested an idea to me It came into my mind that as we lie high if we had but a lake sufficiently large on the top of the hill we could send the water down in rivulets on every side But then the difficulty struck me how to get it  up again Perhaps it may be overcome It would have a charming effect and we will think of it hereafter  When you have received my address at Paris do not fail to let me know once a week how every thing proceeds Be particular in your accounts and do not be afraid of wearying me My heart is in my grounds and my improvements and the more places and things you name the more pleasure you will give me Write to me too concerning my herd of deer my Spanish sheep my buffaloes my Chinese pheasants and all my foreign live stock  I will make my journey as short as possible it shall not be long before I will revisit my WenbourneHill To own the truth honest Aby after reading  your letter I had ordered the chaise to the door to come down again but Anna St Ives would not hear of it so I was obliged to yield But as I tell you my heart is with you WenbourneHill is never out of my mind  I could wish you to be cautious in your communications Abimelech concerning our money matters My daughter gave me a hint about the last mortgage which I did not half like Children think they have a right to pry into a father's expences and to curb and browbeat him if the money be not all spent in gratifying their whims Be more close Abimelech if you would oblige me  ARTHUR ST IVES  LETTER X  LOUISA CLIFTON TO ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES  RoseBank  I AM excessively angry with myself my dear Anna I have not treated you with the open confidence which you deserve because I have had improper fears of you I have doubted lest an excess of friendship and generosity should lead you into mistake and induce  you to think well of my brother rather for my sake than for his own But the more I reflect the more I am convinced that duplicity never can be virtue  Your last letter has brought me to a sense of this The noble sincerity with which you immediately accused yourself for having practised an artifice which I like you do not think was innocent because artifice cannot be innocent has taught me how I ought to act and Sir Arthur's caprice is an additional incitement  I have for some time known that it has been very much desired by my mamma to see you and Coke Clifton united She mentioned her wish to Sir Arthur and he seemed pleased with the idea She did me the honour to  consult me and I opposed precipitate proceedings and strenuously argued that all such events ought to take their natural course  This was the origin of your present journey to Paris and I consequently was enjoined secrecy of the propriety of which I doubted at the moment I am now convinced that secrets are always either foolish or pernicious things and that there ought to be none  The fickleness of Sir Arthur however relative to this journey both surprises and pains me It shews his weakness as well as the power of his favourite Abimelech to be greater than even I imagined and my former thoughts were not very favourable After having concerted this plan with my mamma and  after preparing and proceeding a part of the way I can scarcely imagine what excuse he would have made to her  His mentioning my brother to you likewise surprised me In conversing with my mamma I had told her that if such an event were to take place it were desirable that you and my brother should become acquainted before any hint or proposal ought to be made to you I at present believe this to have been wrong and weak advice but it prevailed and the arrangement was that my mamma should write to Coke Clifton to direct his route through Paris that he should be there at a fixed time to transact some pretended business for her that Sir Arthur and you should make a journey thither on a party of pleasure  which we all knew would be agreeable to you and that you and my brother should meet as if by accident But it appears that Sir Arthur when he has any favourite project in view can scarcely forbear being communicative not from principle but from incontinence  With respect to my brother having told you all that has passed I have only to add it is my earnest advice that you should be careful to put no deception on yourself but to see him as he is His being the brother of your friend cannot give him dignity of mind if he have it not already Were I a thousand times his sister I could not wish him another wife so deserving as my Anna But sister shall be no motive with me to make me desirous of seeing persons  united whose sentiments and souls may be dissimilar Had I not so much confidence in your discernment and truth to yourself I should not be without uneasiness My opinion is that the parties should themselves reciprocally discover those qualities which ought mutually to fit them for the friendship of marriage Is not that the very phrase Anna  the friendship of marriage  Surely if it be not friendship according to the best and highest sense in which that word is used marriage cannot but be something faulty and vicious  I know how readily you will forgive the wrong I have done you by this concealment because you will perceive I acted from well meant but mistaken sentiments I have told my mamma my  present thoughts and have shewed her all the former part of this letter which she approves Her affection for me makes her delight in every effort of my mind to rise superior to the prejudices that bring misery into the world and I often fear lest this affection should deprive her of that force and acumen which in other instances would be ready to detect error whenever it should make its appearance  I need not tell my Anna how tenderly she joins with me in wishing her a safe and pleasant journey All other matters she entirely commits to my Anna's penetration and discretion  Adieu  L CLIFTON  P S  My brother is not rich but has  great expectations This as I imagine occasioned Sir Arthur to receive the proposal with pleasure and my mamma tells me they had some talk of settlements He was exceedingly warm and active in contriving this journey for a few days after which I thought I observed his ardour abate And the probability is that Abimelech from the first had opposed the excursion but that further conversations with my mamma and the pleasure which the projected journey had given you kept Sir Arthur to his purpose I own I began to suspect that should such a match take place the recollection of parting with money which he would willingly have expended on improvements had influenced his conduct and it is some relief to  hope that he was rather acted upon than acting if he really did feel any wish to retract How far he may be or may have been acted upon in other instances as well as this is still a further question  I cannot shake off a doubt which hangs on my mind though I have been debating all morning whether I ought to mention it or be silent I suspect that you yourself have not solved it entirely to your own satisfaction Frank HenleyIt is I think indubitable that he loves youHe would make you happier than perhaps any other man could upon earth Be not swayed by your affection for me beware of any such weakness That you could love him if you would permit yourself nay that you  are obliged to exert your whole force not to love him I am convinced You are conscious of it yourselfIs your decision justIndeed it is a serious question What is the magnitude of the evil which would result from such a union and what the good EnquireI give no opinion There is a mist before my eyes and I dare not give any till I can see more distinctly Think be just and resolve Your own judgment ought to determine you  LETTER XI  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  London GrosvenorStreet  OLIVER what are we What is man What is virtue What is honourMy pride has received a wound much more acute than that which the ball of the highwayman inflicted on my bodyI have had money palmed upon meMoneyA man cannot behave as he  ought and as it would be contemptible not to behave but he must be paid His vices are paid His virtues are paidAll is mercenary I to be sure must be one of the numberA twenty pound bank note I tell thee forced upon me by Sir ArthurNo noNot by himHe never could have made me accept what I supposed falsely however as fact and reflection have since led me to suspect it was mean and degrading to accept She only could prevail She whose commands are irresistible and who condescended to entreatHer eye glistening with a tear which she with difficulty detained in its beauteous orbit she entreatedThere was no opposing such intercession Her eloquence was heavenly God be praised that it  was so For as it has happened I am persuaded it has preserved a poor distressed creature from phrensyHave patience and I will tell thee  I had removed my penitent and had been taking a short airing in the park and as I was returning I saw a crowd collected in a court Led by curiosity to enquire what was the matter I was told that two men had just been pursu+ing a third over the roofs of the neighbouring houses and that having been obliged to descend through a trapdoor they had followed him where it was supposed he had at last been taken I asked what his crime was but nobody knew Some believed him to be a thief some thought it was a pressgang and others conjectured they were bailiffs  It was not long however before a decent welllooking and indeed handsome young woman with a fine child in her arms came running up the court made her way through the crowd with terror in her countenance and with the most piercing cries demanded  Where is heWhere is my dear HarryWho has seen him Where is he  Some of the people pointed out the house She knocked violently continued her cries and lamentations and at last gained admittance  Her grief was so moving so sympathetic that it excited my compassion and made me determine to follow her Accordingly I elbowed my way though I felt that I rather disturbed the surgeon's dressing but that was a trifle  I followed her up stairs without ceremony With respect to her affection  masterless passion had swayed her to its mood  she was not to be repulsed  The prisoner and his pursuers had descended to the second floor in which the poor fugitive had endeavoured to seek refuge but not soon enough to find protection from the bailiffs as they proved and as he knew them to be Never didst thou see terror so strong nor affection so pathetic as this excellent young woman his wife discovered Excellent I am certain she is She wrung her hands she fell on her knees she held up her babe and finding these were ineffectual she screamed agonizing prayers to save her  Harry The idea she had conceived of the loss of liberty and the miseries of a prison must have been dreadful But tears and prayers and cries were vain she was pleading to the deaf or at least to the obdurate  As soon as the violence of her grief gave a momentary respite I enquired what the sum was for which he was in thraldom and found it to be sixteen pounds beside costs It was not a debt originally contracted by himself it was for a note in which he had joined to serve his wife's brother It seems they are a young couple who by their industry have collected a trifling sum with which they have taken a small shop I did not ask of what kind She serves her customers and he follows his trade  as a journeyman carpenter It did not a little please me to hear the young creature accuse her brother of being false to his friend while the husband defended him and affirmed it could be nothing but necessity I could perceive however that she grieved to think her brother was not so good as she could have wished him to be  The horros of a jail were so impressed so rooted in her fancy that she was willing to sell any thing every thing she would give them all she had so that her Harry might not be dragged to a damp foul dungeon to darkness bread and water and starving Thou canst not imagine the volubility with which her passions flowed and her terrors found utterance from the hope that it was not  possible for Christian hearts to know all this and not be moved to pity  I am well persuaded however that had I not been there those good Christians the bailiffs would have paid no other attention to her panic than to see how it might be turned to profit The miscreants talked of five guineas for the pretended risk they should run in giving him a fortnight to sell his effects to the best advantage They too could recommend a broker a very honest fellowBy what strange gradations Oliver can the heart of man become thus corrupt The harpies looked hatefully  Luckily I happened to have the twenty pound note which pride had bidden me reject with so much scorn in my pocket Thou I am certain wilt not  ask what I did with it I immediately tendered those same Christians I told thee of their money The rascals were disappointed and would have been surly but a single look silenced their insolence One of them was dispatched according to form to see that there were no detainers and being paid they then set their prisoner free  Now if thou thinkest Oliver thou canst truly figure to thyself the overflowing gratitude of the kind young creature the wife thou art egregiously mistaken She fell on her knees to me she blessed me prayed for me and said I was an angel from heaven sent to save her dear Harry from destruction she kissed him hugged God blessed and half smothered her heavenly infant as she truly called it  with kisses nay she kissed mein spirit OliverI could see she did ay and in spirit I returned her chaste caresses  She entreated me with so much humble love and gratitude to come and see her poor house which I had saved and to tell her my name that she might pray for me the longest day she had to live that I could not forbear gratifying her so far as to go with her As for my name I told her it was man The quick hussey understood me for she repliedNo it was angel  I found her house like her person neat and in order What is still better her Harry seems a kind good young man and alive to as well as deserving of her affection  Wouldst thou think it OliverThe pleasure I had communicated had reverberated back upon myself yet the fight of a couple thus happy gave birth to a thought of such exquisite pain that Something shot across my brainI know not whatBut it seemed to indicate I should never be so mated  Still this money OliverPrithee be at the trouble to examine the question and send me thy thoughts for I have not been able to satisfy myself What is the thing called property What are  meum  and  tuum  Under what circumstances may a man take money from another I would not be proud neither would I render myself despicable  Thou seest how I delight to impart my joys and griefs to thee Thou tellest me  thou partakest them and judging by myself I cannot but believe thee Tell me when thou art weary of me I have long and often been weary of myself  Yet she is very kind to me and so kind that I have lately been betrayed into hopes too flattering too ecstatic to be true Oh Should she ever think of me Were it only possible she ever should be mineThe pleasure is too exquisite It is insupportableLet me gaze and wonder at humble distance in silence and in aweDo not call me abjectYet if I am so do tell me all that ought to be told It is not before her rank that I bend and sink Being for being I am her equal but who is her equal in virtueHeavens What a smile did she bestow on me when I  took the money I mentioned to thee It has sunken deep deep in my heart Never can it be forgotten Never Never  Peace be with thee  F HENLEY  LETTER XII  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London GrosvenorStreet  MUST I be silent Must I not tell my Louisa how infinitely her candor and justice delight me With the voice of a warning angel she bids me enquire examine my heart and resolve I think I have resolved and from reasons which I believe are not to be overcome Yet I will confess my opinion strong as it is  receives violent attacks as Louisa you will be convinced when you have read the whole of this letter  My friend cautions me against being partial even in favour of her brother Such a friend is indeed worthy to advise and I will remember her precepts This brother may be a degenerate scion from a noble stock yet I can hardly think the thing possible That he may have fallen into many of the mistakes common to the world in which he has lived is indeed most likely But the very qualities which you describe in him speak an active and perhaps a dignified nature  We have duties to fulfil Few opportunities present themselves to a woman educated and restrained as women unfortunately  are of performing any thing eminently good One of our most frequent and obvious tasks seems to be that of restoring a great mind misled by error to its proper rank If the mind of Clifton should be such shall I cowardly decline what I believe it to be incumbent on me to perform Let him be only such as I expect and let me be fortunate enough to gain his affections and you shall see Louisa whether trifles shall make me desist  What high proofs of courage perseverance and of suffering do men continually give And shall we wholly renounce the dignity of emulation and willingly sign the unjust decree of prejudice that mind likewise has its sex and  that women are destitute of energy and fortitude  But Frank HenleyLet me not hide a thought from my Louisa He is indeed worthy of being loved every day more worthy I have a new story to tell which will be more effectual praise than any words of mine Like you I am persuaded he has some affection for me I am not insensible to his worth and virtues I ought not to be Were I to indulge the reveries into which I could easily fall I might be as much misled by passion as others who are so ready to complain and pity themselves for being in love But a wakeful sense of the consequences is my safeguard It cannot be I should render my father  my relations and friends miserable I should set a bad example to my sex I who aim at shewing them mind is superior to sex  Such are the thoughts that protect me from the danger His mental excellence perhaps I love as truly as heart could wish But as the lover who is to be the husband no I will not suffer my thoughts to glance in that direction I might but I will not Nothing but a conviction that my principles are wrong shall ever make me and that conviction I hold to be impossible  Do not imagine I am guilty of the mistake of supposing myself his superior Far the reverse The tale which I am now about to relate will inform you better of the true state of my feelings  You must know my dear that on our arrival in town Sir Arthur with my help prevailed on Frank Henley to accept a twenty pound bill that he might have the means of gratifying his inclinations and enjoying the pleasures which at his age it is natural he should wish to enjoy These means I had but too good reason to be convinced had been denied him by his father which I suspected to be and am now satisfied was the true reason that Frank refused to attend us on our journey  The youth has quite pride enough my dear he is desirous to confer but not to accept obligations is ready enough to give but not to receive As if he had not only a right to monopolize virtue but to be exempt from the wants  which are common to all and to supply which men form themselves into societies He seems to shrink with exquisite pain from the acceptance of money However I was determined to conquer and conquer I did Nor can I say considering them as I do that I was sorry to offend the false feelings even of Frank Henley for whom I have aninfinite esteem  After receiving this present he ac+companied me two or three times to those public places to which crowns and half guineas gain admittance and as you may imagine was far from appearing insensible of the powers of poetry and music Suddenly however he refused to be any more of such parties for which I own I could divine no reason  I knew he had been educated in habits of oeconomy and therefore could not suppose generous though I knew him to be that he had squandered away his pocketmoney in so short a time I endeavoured both to rally and to reason but in vain he was positive even to obstinacy and I rightly conjectured there must be some cause for it which I had not discovered  You have heard me speak I believe my dear of Mrs Clarke as of a careful good woman and a great favourite with my dear mamma when living She was then our housekeeper in the country but has lately been left in the town house because the furniture is too valuable to be entrusted to a less attentive person This Mrs Clarke had a  sister whose name was Webb and who left a son and a daughter who are both married The son as you will soon hear has been a wild and graceless fellow but the daughter is one of the most agreeable and engaging young creatures I think I ever saw  Yesterday my good Mrs Clarke and her niece were shut up together in close conversation for a considerable time and I perceived that their cheeks were swelled their eyes red and that they had been crying violently I almost revere Mrs Clarke as my mother because of the excellence of her heart and the soundness of her understanding I therefore could not forbear earnestly enquiring whether it were possible for me to remove her cause of grief for  grieved I told her I could plainly perceive she was She burst into tears again on my questioning her and endeavoured to express feelings that were too big for utterance Turning to her niece she said  I must inform my dear young lady  For God's sake don't For the Lord's sake don't  cried the terrified creature  I must  replied the aunt  It is proper  He will have no mercy shewn him He will be hanged  exclaimed the other in an agony  You do not know this lady  said the aunt  Indeed she does not  added I  if she supposes I would have any creature upon earth hanged  Retire Peggy  said the aunt  while I relate the vile the dreadful tale  No no For mercy's sake no  replied  the niece  I must stay and beg and pray and down on my knees for my brother He is a wild and a wicked young man but he is my brother  Pray let her stay  said I to the aunt  And fear nothing my kindhearted Peggy Be assured I will not hurt a hair of your brother's head I will do him good if I can but no injury  The God of Heaven bless and reward your angelic ladyship  cried the half frantic grateful Peggy  Mrs Clarke attempted to begin her story She was almost suffocated I never heard so heartrending a groan as she gave when she came to the fatal sentence Would you believe it Louisa This nephew of the worthy Mrs Clarke this brother of the good Peggy is the  very highwayman who shot Frank Henley  His benevolent aunt has been with him for he is still under the surgeon's hands and he has confessed to her I am angry with myself Louisa to find I wonder at it he has confessed that the brave the humane the nobleminded Frank has visited him several times and has set the folly of his wicked pursuits in so true and so strong a light that the man protests with the utmost vehemence if he can but escape punishment for the faults he has committed he will sooner perish than again be guilty of his former crimes  The first time Frank visited him he gave the poor wretch a guinea and went himself in search of another lodging  for him as well to remove him from the knowledge of his wicked companions as to protect him from the forty pound hunters The man wants to escape over to the continent and appears to be so sincere in his resolves of reformation that Frank has undertaken to furnish him with the means  You cannot imagine Louisa the heartfelt praises which the worthy Mrs Clarke bestowed on the youth And Peggy said that she hoped she should some time or another live to see him that she might fall down and kiss his footsteps But added she with great ardor I find indeed there are very good men in the world  Still there appeared something enigmatical to me between Frank and the  money account I could not conceive how he should want the means immediately to furnish such a sum as would have been sufficient for the poor fugitive And this again reminded me how assiduously Frank had lately avoided every occasion of expence  While we were in the midst of our discourse who should enter the room but Frank Never was I present at such a scene  Good God Almighty  exclaimed Peggy the moment she saw him  This is he This is the very blessed dear gentleman that saved my poor Harry from those terrible jailors  Is it possible  cried Mrs Clarke  It is it is he He himself  said the fullhearted Peggy falling down on her knees and catching the flap of his  coat which she kissed with inconceivable enthusiasm  Poor Frank did not know which way to look Good deeds are so uncommon and so much the cause of surprise that virtue blushes at being detected almost as deeply as vice I knew Frank had a noble heart and I own Louisa I was not much amazed when Peggy with abundance of kind expressions and a flow of simple eloquence related the manner in which Frank had saved her husband from the bailiffs by paying a debt which with costs amounted to upward of eighteen pounds  I did not however forbear severely to reprove myself for having dared so much as to imagine that a youth with  such high virtues could not in a city like London find opportunities of expending so small a sum as twenty pounds in acts of benevolence I ought at least to have supposed the thing probable yet it never once entered my mind  The thanks blessings and prayers of Peggy were endless Finding him not only to be what she knew the man who relieved her from the most poignant distress but likewise the vanquisher and the saviour of her brother she said and protested she was sure there was not such another angel upon earth She was sure there was not Frank was ashamed of and almost offended at her incessant praise It was so natural and so proper for him to act as he did that  he is surprised to find it can be matter of wonder  I must insist however upon seeing him reimbursed and I persuade myself there is one thought which will make him submit to it quietly I have but to remind him that the good of others requires that men who so well know the use of it should never be without money  Adieu I have not time to write more at presentYet I must for I ought to add that though I thought myself so fully convinced when I began this letter concerning Frank and the only right mode of acting doubts have several times intruded themselves upon me while I have been writing I will  think when the fancy is not so busy as at present and when I have thought do not fear my resolution  Ever most affectionately yours A W ST IVES  LETTER XIII  FRANK HENLEY TO OLIVER TRENCHARD  London GrosvenorStreet  IT is an intolerably strange thing Oliver that a man cannot perform the mere necessary duties of humanity without being supposed almost a prodigy Where is the common sense I will not say delicacy which should teach people that such suppositions are an insult not only to the person but to all mankind  I am young I grant and know but little of the barbarity which it is pretended is universal I cannot think the accusation true Or if it be I am convinced it must be the result of▪ some strange perversion of what may be called the natural propensities of man I own I have seen children wrangle for and endeavour to purloin or seize by force each others apples and cherries and this may be a beginning to future rapacity But I know the obvious course of nature would be to correct instead of to confirm such mistakes I know too that there are individual instances of cruelty and insensibility But these surely are the exceptions and not the rule  I visited a man whose vices that is  whose errors and passions were so violent as to be dangerous to society and still more dangerous to himself Was it not my duty I thought myself certain of convincing him of his folly and of bringing back a lost individual to the paths of utility and good sense What should I have been had I neglected such an opportunity I have really no patience to think that a thing which it would have been a crime to have left undone should possibly be supposed a work of supererogation  I saw an industrious rising family on the brink of ruin and in the agonies of despair which were the consequences of an act of virtue and I was not selfish enough to prefer my own whims which I might choose to call pleasures to the  preservation of this worthy this really excellent little family And for this I am to be adored For no word is strong enough to express the fooleries that have been acted to me They were well meant True They were the ebullitions of virtue I do not deny it But either they are an unjust satire upon the world in general or it is a vile world I half suspect indeed it is not quite what it ought to be  In addition to all this I have been obliged to receive a sum equal to that which I thought it my duty to bestow This is the second time and perhaps thou wilt tell me I am not difficult to persuade Read the following dialogue which passed between me and the most angelic of Heaven's creatures and judge  for thyself She is really a prodigy I never knew another mind of such uncommon powers So clear so collected so certain of choosing the side of truth and so secure of victory  I am an ass I am talking Arabic to thee I ought to have begun with informing thee of a circumstance which is in itself odd enough The highwayman and Peggy Pshaw The woman whose husband was arrested They are not only brother and sister but the nephew and niece of Mrs Clarke Think of that Oliver The nephew of so worthy a woman so audaciously wicked Well might the distressed Peggy express anger which I could perceive was heartfelt though she herself at that time knew not of this act But to my dialogue Listen to  the voice of my charmer and say whether she charm not wisely  You have made a generous and a noble use Frank of the small sum which you were so very unwilling to accept▪ She treats me with the most winning familiarity What does she mean Is it purposely to shew me how much she is at her ease with me and how impossible it is that any thing but civility should exist between us Or is it truly as kind as it seems Can it be Who can say Is it out of nature Wholly Surely surely not These bursting gleams of hope beget suspense more intolerable than all the blackness of despair itself  I acted naturally madam and I confess it gives me some pain to find it the subject of so much wonder  It is no subject of wonder to me Your inferiors in understanding I know would not act like you but the weak do not give law to the strong I own that I have been dull enough unjust enough not to suspect your true motive for refusing as you have done lately to accompany us to public places But this is a heavy penalty on you which an act of virtue ought not to incur  If it be a penalty madam I am sure it is one which you have too much generosity to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of paying  I understand your hint but I am not so generous as you think me for I am determined and you know what a positive girl I am to share both the penalty and the enjoyment with you  I beg your pardon madam but that cannot be  Oh But in spite of your serious and very emphatical air it must be  Excuse me madam I am certain you have too high a sense of justice to impose▪laws to which you yourself would not submit  Very true Prove me that and I am answered Nay so confident am I of the goodness of my cause that I will not require you to take up this Laying down another bank note of equal value with the former unless I can on the contrary prove it to be nothing but false pride or mistake which can induce you to refuse You perceive Frank I am not afraid of offending you by speaking the plain truth Pray tell me when  you saw the worthy couple whom you relieved in distress had you persisted in your refusal of the paltry bit of paper which I before prevailed on you to receive what would you have said to yourself what would have been your remorse when you found yourself unable to succour the unfortunate merely because you had been too proud to receive that which you wanted and which therefore you had no right to refuse You see Oliver she snatched my own sword from my side with which to dispatch me If thou art too dull to understand me consult my last letter You were ready to protect thought at the risk of your life those very persons at whose favours as they are falsely called your spirit is so equally ready to revolt Perhaps  in defending us you did no more than you ought but we cannot be ignorant how few are capable of doing so much And since you are thus prompt to perform all which the most austere morality can require so long as it shall be apparent to the world that your motives are not selfish proceed a step further disregard the world and every being in it that is disregard their mistakes and satisfied that your motives are pure defy the false interpretations to which any right action may subject you Neither while you are actually discharging the highest offices of humanity deny to others the right to fulfil some of the most trivial  I could not act otherwise than I did on both the occasions to which you allude  madam I believe it is our duty always to be guided by circumstances but not to be guilty of an impropriety because it is possible such circumstances may again occur  You are right We only differ concerning the meaning of the word Impropriety or propriety we shall come to presently You have promised your wounded penitent money to facilitate his escape and you have none  I have some trifling useless property madam  But you have a journey to make back to WenbourneHill according to your present intentions  Do you imagine madam I cannot fast for a day  Oh yes I doubt it not for a week  Frank to effect any great any laudable purpose But I must be plain with you It is ungenerous of you to wish to engross all virtue and sensibility Beside you have duties to perform to yourself which are as pressing as any you owe to society because they are to fit you for the social duties Hearken to the angel Oliver It is as much my duty at prefent to afford you the means which you want as it was yours to visit the wounded highwayman or aid the distressed Peggy You ought to suffer me to perform my duties both for my sake and your own You ought not to neglect while you are in London to seize on every opportunity which can tend to enlarge your faculties You have no common part to act and that you may act  it well you should study the beings with whom you are to associate You must not suffer any false feelings to unfit you for the high offices for the execution of which men like you are formed Didst thou ever hear such honeyed flattery Oliver Something moreYou must accompany us to France  MadamImpossible  Hear me Frank The journey will be of infinite service to you A mind like yours cannot visit a kingdom where the manners of the people are so distinct as those of the French must be from the English without receiving great benefit Your father is rich  That he denies madam  To you and you and I know why If your delicacy should object to a gift I  am sure it cannot with propriety to a loan Going with us your expences will in fact be only casual I can supply you with such money as you want which you may hereafter repay me when I may perhaps be glad that I have such a debtor  My father's property madam is of his own acquiring I have no legal claim upon it and it would be dishonest in me to spend that upon speculation which perhaps never may be mine  Yes to spend it in unworthy purposes would be dishonest But I again recur to your duties However since you are so tenacious on the subject I will become a usurer to pacify your feelings and you shall pay for risk Fifty pounds unless you meet with more Peggies  I dare say will bear you free It is twenty pounds more thou knowest than I asked of my father You shall give me eighty whenever you have a thousand pounds of your own  Madam  Well well You shall give me a hundredVery seriously It almost vexes me Frank to be refused so very slight a favour for I can read refusal and opposition in your eye But if you persist you will give me great pain for you will convince me that where your own passions are concerned you are not superior to the paltry prejudices by which the rest of the world are governed  I own madam my mind has had many struggles on the subject and I  am afraid as you say it has been too willing to indulge its prejudices and its pride But if you seriously think from your heart it is my duty to act in this case as you direct  I do seriously solemnly and from my heart think it is your duty  Then madam I submit  Why that's my kind Frank As noble in this instance as in every otherI could love you for it if you would let meIn a moment my heart was alarmed I could feel myself change colour I am certain she saw my agitation her manner told me so for she instantly added with a kind of affectionate significance which I know not how to interpret I would say as much to the  whole world but that it is a foolish world and wants the wit to conceive things truly as they are meant  She was gone in an instant smiling failing and her countenance brightening with heavenly radiance as she departed  What can this be Her words are continually resounding in my ears  She could love me if I would let her  HeavensLove meLet herLet herOh  It is a foolish world  She fears its censuresLove meIs it possibleTell me Oliver is it possible  It wants the wit to conceive things truly as they are meant  Was this forbidding me to hope or was it blaming the world's prejudicesI know notAh To what purpose warn the moth unless she could put  out the lightOh blasphemyLove me if I would let herI cannot forget it OliverI cannotOh I could weep like a child at my own conscious debility  Why should I despairWith a modern miss a fine lady I might but not with her She has a mind superior to the world and its mistakes And am I not convinced there ought to be no impediment to our union Why should I doubt of convincing her She dare do all that truth and justice can demandAnd she could love me if I would let herIs not my despondency absurdEven did I know her present thoughts and know them to be inimical to my passion what ought I to do Not to desert my own cause if it be a just one  and if it be the contrary there is no question I will make none Let me but be convinced of my error and it shall be renounced Yes Oliver I dare boldly averit shall But shall I forego a right so precious if it be mineNo Kingdoms shall not tempt meWhy is this timidity Why does my heart palpitate Why with inward whispers do I murmur thoughts which I dare not speak aloud Why do they rise quivering to my lips and there panting expire painfully struggling for birth but in vain Oh How poorly do I paint what so oppressively I feel  I would have thee read my whole heart I shudder to suppose it possible I should be a seducer Falsely to be thought so would trouble me but little  But tamely to yield up felicity so inestimable in compliance with the errors of mankind to renounce a union which might and ought to be productive of so much good is not this a crimeSpeak without fear Shew me what is right Convince me then blame me if I quail  And now Oliver it is probable thou wilt not see me for these three months Delicate as these money favours are become in the transactions of men contemptible as they often are in themselves and unwilling as I have been to subject myself to them I am glad that she has conquered I would not have hesitated a moment for obligation if obligation it were to her would be heaven but she has her own wants  her own mode of doing good These I was very desirous not to abridge But since I must either comply or remain behind I am glad to have been so honourably vanquished  My father I know is willing enough I should go to France or where I please so that I do not ask him for money Indeed he told me as much He thinks it matters not what becomes of a fellow so useless and so idle as he supposes me to be However I have written to inform him of my intention and once more to remind him though certainly in vain of the manner in which he ought to act  Ever thine F HENLEY  P S  Thou art an unwilling sluggish correspondent I have just received thine of the st I find I am in no danger of reproof from thee for the acceptance of these pecuniary obligations but I half suspect from the tenor of thy letter that thou wouldst bid me take all that any body is willing to give Be just to thyself and thy friend Oliver shrink not from wholesome severity Let not thy suavity of temper or thy partial kindness to me sway thee to the right or the left lest hereafter I should make the fearful demand of my lost principles or at least relaxed and enfeebled from thee Beware of the kindness of thy heart  Do not omit my most respectful and kind acknowledgments to thy father and family  LETTER XIV  ANNA WENBOURNE ST IVES TO LOUISA CLIFTON  London GrosvenorStreet  I HAVE had a strong contest my dear with our favourite youth to overcome what I believe I have convinced him is prejudice and I hope he is cured of false delicacy for the future He is to go with us to France and is no longer under the necessity of abstaining from  innocent and instructive amusements because he is possessed of sensibility and a high respect for virtue  But he had no sooner accepted this supply than away he was gone to his convert This I suspected For which reason I had previously dispatched Mrs Clarke to visit her nephew The good woman could not be prevailed on to receive any money for his relief urging that she was very capable of supplying him herself That being so I did not choose violently to contest the matter with her as I do not wish to encourage the most distant approaches to a spirit of avarice I only told her it would be unjust should she ever want money for useful and virtuous purposes if she did not apply to me and she with much  good sense answered she thought as I did and would certainly act accordingly She is a very worthy woman  She was with her nephew when Frank came in and the scene as described by her was affecting The poor culprit had been repeating all his obligations to the generous Frank praising his bravery and dwelling with a degree of conviction which gave Mrs Clarke great pleasure on the effects of goodness since it could render a man so undaunted so forgiving so humane and so much as he said like a saint You know my dear that saint in the language of such pèople does not mean an impostor who pretends to carry burning coals in his hands drive rusty nails into his legs adore a morsel of rotten wood or decayed  bone and pretend to work miracles or preach exclusive doctrines of faith and salvation A saint with them is a person more perfect in the discharge of the highest moral duties than they believe any other earthly being to be Let us accept their definition and enroll the name of Frank Henley in our calendar  Frank was disappointed and in some measure displeased that any person should offer his reformed friend as from the best of motives he called him money but himself and the reason he gave was not without its force This is a memorable epocha in the life of a mistaken man said he and no means which can move his mind to a better performance of his duties than he has hitherto attempted  should be left untried It is but natural that he should think more of me than of most other persons  I can think of no one else  Exclaimed the poor fellow with enthusiasm and the more cause he shall have to remember me with affection the more weight will the reasons have with him which I have urged  The culprit acknowledged that from ill advice vicious example and violent passions he had become very wicked But said he I must be wicked indeed if I could ever forget what this gentleman has said and done to save my family from shame and ruin and me from destruction and death  There is the greater reason to hope because Mrs Clarke says that he has  been what is called well educated his station in life considered and indeed of this I imagine she herself had taken care  Peggy came in and by her excess of gratitude and which is better of admiration for her hero she drove the over delicate Frank away This is one of his defects for which we must endeavour to find a remedy Men are not exposed to the fulsome praise which we unmarried females are calmly obliged to hear or be continually at war or Frank would be more patient Indeed he ought to be because in this instance the praises he receives are the effusions of persons who had never before seen virtue exert herself with so much ardour  Though the nephew be not an old or  hardened offender he has committed some depredations of the consequences of which were they proved upon him he himself is ignorant His accomplice has discovered his retreat another more private lodging has therefore been taken for him to which he is to remove with all possible caution And when he is sufficiently recovered which Mrs Clarke tells me will be soon he is then to depart for the continent and work at his trade which is that of a cabinetmaker English workmen are in high esteem abroad and he will easily find employment He is more than reconciled to labour he is eager to begin and as it appears does not want activity of mind of which the dangerous expedients to which he resorted are some proof  So much for the history of a highwayman which I think is at least as deserving of remembrance as that of many other depredators  I have been making some efforts to decide the question not of love but of duty Love must not be permitted till duty shall be known I have not satisfied myself so well as I could wish yet my former reasons seem invincible Ought my father and my family to be offended Ought I to set an example that might be pernicious Is it most probable that by opposing I should correct or increase the world's mistakes The path before me is direct and plain ought I to deviate  In vain I fear should I plead his extraordinary  merit Would the plea remove the load of affliction with which I should overwhelm those who love me best At present they think well nay highly of me I sometimes have the power to influence them to good What power shall I have when they imagine I have disgraced both myself and them  Who ever saw those treated with esteem who are themselves supposed to be the slaves of passion And could the world possibly be persuaded that a marriage between me and the son of my father's steward could ever originate on my part in honourable motives  Ought I to forget the influence of example Where is the young lady  being desirous to marry an adventurer or one whose mind might be as mean as his origin who would not suppose her favourite more than the equal of Frank For is not the power of discrimination lost when the passions are indulged And ought my name to be cited Ought they to be encouraged by any act of mine  Yet the opposing arguments are far from feeble His feelings are too strong to be concealed Perhaps the only weakness I can think him capable of is that of loving me For if love be contradictory to reason it is a weakness but should he answer that love and reason are inthis instance united we must come to proofs That he loves is too visible to admit of doubt I have seen the word  trembling as it were on his tongue I am almost certain that a silly thing which I said with a very different intention would have produced an avowal of his passion had I not added something to prevent it and hurried away  Well then Am I certain I am guilty of no injustice to him And why ought I not to be as just to him as to any other being on earth Who would be more just to me Who would be more tender more faithful more affectionate  I know not whether I ought to shrink from the vanity which seems annexed to the idea for I know not whether it be vanity but I cannot sometimes help asking myself whether the good that might result from the union of two strong minds mutually determined to exert  their powers for the welfare of society be not a reason superior even to all those I have enumerated  If this be so and if our minds really possess the strength which I am so ready to suppose I then know not what answer to give I reject the affectation of under estimating myself purposely that I may be called a modest humble young lady Humility I am persuaded though not so common is as much a vice as pride But while avoiding one extreme I must take care not to be guilty of another The question is embarrassing but I must not by delay suffer embarrassment to increase  With respect to your brother I can at present conclude nothing and can conjecture but little The idea which has  oftenest occurred and which I have before mentioned is the infinite pleasure of seeing an active mind in the full possession of its powers and of being instrumental in restoring that which mistake may have injured or in part destroyed It seems a duty pointed out to me attended perhaps with difficulty and it may be with danger but these increase its force And if so here is another argument to add to the heaviest scale  Yes It must be thus The more I examine and while I am writing perhaps I examine the best the more I am confirmed in my former decision  Pity for Frank ought not to be listened to It is always a false motive unless supported by justice Frank will never condescend to endeavour to incite  compassion it is not in his character He will rather assert his claims for so he ought I do not mean that a complaint will never escape him The best of us are not always so perfectly master of our thoughts as never to be inconsistent But his system will not be to win that by intercession which he could not obtain by fair and honourable barter The moment I have entirely satisfied and convinced myself I have no doubt of inducing him to behave as nobly on this as he has done on every other trying occasion  And now my dear Louisa for the present farewel I do not suppose I shall write again except a line to inform you of our safe arrival after having crossed the channel till we come to Paris I expect to  be amused by the journey Though I cannot but own I think that as far as amusement was concerned the good ladies under the reign of the Tudors who travelled twenty miles a day on a strong horse and a pillion that is when summer made the roads passable had much better opportunities for observation than we who shut up in our carriages with blinds to keep out the dust gallop further in two days and two nights than they could do in a month This hasty travelling when haste is necessary is a great convenience But nothing except the inordinate ardour of the mind to enjoy could induce people on a journey of pleasure to hurry as they do through villages towns and counties pass unnoticed the most magnificent  buildings and the most delightful prospects that forests rivers and mountains can afford and wilfully exclude themselves from all the riches of nature To look about us while thus surrounded seems to be a very natural wish And if so a portable closet or rather a flying watchbox is but a blundering contrivance  You know your Anna her busy brain will be meddling And perhaps she trusts too much to the pardoning affection of friendship  Once again adieu Yours ever and ever A W ST IVES  LETTER XV  FRANK HENLEY TO ABIMELECH HENLEY  SIR  London GrosvenorStreet  THAT I may not appear to neglect any filial duty all of which it has been my most earnest wish to fulfil I write to inform you that at the request of the family I am preparing to accompany Sir Arthur to France From our last conversation I understood you had no  objection to the journey except that of furnishing me with money for it was your pleasure to remind me that a man so idle as you suppose I am may be or go any where without the world suffering the least loss I own did I imagine the same of myself it would make me wretched indeed  You thought proper sir to refuse me the small sum which I requested of you for this purpose I do not wish to wrest what you are unwilling to give You understand your own reasonings best but to me they appear to be either erroneous or incomprehensible I wished to explain to you what my plan of life was but you refused to hear me I had no sooner said that  I thought it my duty to study how I could best serve society than you angrily told me I ought first to think how I could best serve myself From a recollection of the past I am convinced this is a point on which we shall never have the same opinion For this I am sincerely sorry but as I hope not to blame  Suffer me however once more to repeat sir that though my young lady has kindly offered to furnish me with money I still think it wrong that you should permit me to accept her offer having as I am well convinced the means to supply me liberally yourself I assure you sir I would forbear to go or to lay myself under the necessity  of asking you for money were I not fully persuaded of its propriety In order to perform my duty in the world I ought to understand its inhabitants its manners and principally its laws with the effects which the different legislation of different countries has produced I believe this to be the highest and most useful kind of knowledge  Could I fortunately induce you to think as I do you certainly would not refuse my request Thirty pounds to you would be but a trifle But from my late failure I have so little hope that I rather write to execute a duty than with any expectation of success  I submit this to your consideration and have the greatest desire to prove myself your dutiful and affectionate son  F HENLEY  LETTER XVI

where it will either find you or lie at the banker's till your arrival A packet accompanies it which contains the accounts of your late uncle with Monsieur de Chateauneuf by which it appears there is a considerable balance  in his favour which as you know by will devolves to me  I hope when you have settled this business you will be disposed to return to England and that I shall once again have the happiness to see you before I die Do not imagine I speak of death to attract any false pity But my state of health obliges me to consider this serious event as at no great distance though I do not think myself in immediate danger  Sir Arthur St Ives and his lovely daughter will soon be in Paris They requested letters from me and among others I thought I could not recommend them to any one with more propriety than to my son There is an intimacy between our families at present  which was first occasioned by an affection which your sister Louisa and Anna St Ives conceived for each other and which has continually increased very much indeed to my satisfaction For before I saw this young lady I never met with one whom I thought deserving of the friendship of your sister Louisa whose strength of mind if I do not mistake is very extraordinary for her years Yet even I her mother and liable enough to be partial have sometimes thought she must cede the palm to her friend the charming Anna  My reason for writing thus is that you may be guilty of no mistakes of character which indeed I think is very unlikely and that you will shew Sir Arthur all possible respect as well as his daughter  in justice to yourself and as the friends of the family Your sister writes under the same cover and I cannot doubt whenever you read her letters but that you must receive very great satisfaction to find you have such a sister  I scarcely need tell you Clifton that though you have resided but little with me I feel all the fond affection of a parent that I am earnestly desirous to hear of your happiness and to promote it and that no pleasure which the world could afford to me personally would equal that of seeing you become a good and great man You have studied you have travelled you have read both men and books every advantage which the most anxious desire to form your mind couldprocure has been yours I  own that a mother's fondness forms great expectations of you which when you read this be your faculties strong or weak you will very probably say you are capable of more than fulfilling The feeble hearing their worth or talents questioned are too apt to swell and assume and I have heard it said that the strong are too intimately acquainted with themselves to harbour doubt I believe it ought to be so I believe it to be better that we should act boldly and bring full conviction upon ourselves when mistaken than that a timid spirit should render us too cautious to do either good or harm I would not preach neither indeed at present could I A thousand ideas seemed crowding upon my mind but they have expelled each other as  quickly as they came and I scarcely know what to add My headachs disqualify me for long or consistent thinking and nothing I believe but habit keeps me from being half an idiot  One thing however I cannot forget which is that I am your mother Clifton and that I have the most ardent and unremitting desire to see you a virtuous and a happy man In which hope my blessing and love are most sincerely yours  M CLIFTON  LETTER XVIII  LOUISA CLIFTON TO HER BROTHER COKE CLIFTON  RoseBank  IT is long my dear brother since I received a letter from you and still longer since I had the pleasure to see you How many rivers seas valleys and mountains have you traversed since that time What various nations what numerous opposite and characteristic countenances  have you beheld From all and each of them I hope you have learned something I hope the succession of objects has not been so quick as to leave vacuity in the mind  My propensity to moralize used formerly And our formerlies you know brother are not of any long duration to tease and half put you out of temper Indulge me once more in hoping it will not do so at present for I believe I am more prone to this habit than ever What can I say to my brother Shall I tattle to him the scandal of the village were I mistress of it Shall I describe to him the fashion of a new cap or the charms of a dress that has lately travelled from Persia to Paris from Paris to London and from London to RoseBank  Or shall I recount the hopes and fears of a sister who has sometimes the temerity to think who would be so unfashionable as to love her brother not for the cut of his coat not for the French or Italian phrases with which he might interlard his discourse not for any recital of the delight which foreign ladies took in him and which he took in foreign ladies not for a loud tongue and a prodigious lack of wit not for any of the antics or impertinences which I have too frequently remarked in young men of fashion but for something directly the reverse of all these for welldigested principles an ardent desire of truth incessant struggles to shake off prejudices for emanations of soul bursts of thought and flashes of genius For such a brother  oh how eager would be my arms how open my heart  Do not think my dear Clifton I am unjust enough to mean any thing personal to satirize what I can scarcely be said to have seen or to condemn unheard No Your faculties were always lively You have seen much must have learned much and why may I not suppose you are become all that a sister's heart can desire Pardon me if I expect too much Do we not all admire and seek after excellence When we are told such a person is a man of genius do we not wish to enquire into the fact And if true are we not desirous of making him our intimate And do not the ties of blood doubly enforce such wishes in a brother's behalf From what you  were I have no doubt but that you are become an accomplished man But I hope you are also become something much better I hope that by the exertion of your talents acquirements and genius I shall see you the friend of man and the true citizen of the world  If you are all that I hope I think you will not be offended with these sisterly effusions If you are not or but in part you may imagine me vain and impertinent But still I should suppose you will forgive me because you are so seldom troubled with such grave epistles and one now and then if not intolerably long may be endured from an elder sister  Yet why do I say elder Neither age nor station have any just claim for  there can be none except the claims of truth and reason against which there is no appeal I am eighteen months older than my brother and up rises the claim of eldership Such are the habits the prejudices we have to counteract  My dear mamma has mentioned Sir Arthur St Ives in her letter and his lovely daughter Anna more lovely in mind even than in form and of the latter a single glance will enable you to judge I need not request you to be attentive and civil to her for it is impossible you should be otherwise Your own gratification will induce you to shew her the public places and render her every service in your power which will be more than overpaid by associating with her for it is indeed a delight to be  in her company For grace and beauty of person she has no equal and still less can she be equalled by any person of her age for the endowments of wit and understanding I am half angry with myself for pretending to recommend her when as you will see she can so much more effectually recommend herself  I have nothing to add except to say that when my dear brother has a moment's leisure I shall be glad to hear from him and that I remain his very affectionate sister  L CLIFTON  P S  On recollection I am convinced it is a false fear which has prevented me from mentioning another person very  eminently deserving of esteem and respect a fear of doing harm where I meant to do good We ought to do our duty and risk the consequences The absurd pride of ancestry occasions many of our young gentlemen to treat those whom they deem their inferiors by birth with haughtiness and often with something worse forgetting that by this means they immediately cut themselves off as it were from society for by contemning those who are a supposed step below them they encourage and incur contempt from the next immediately above them This is in some measure the practice and were it true that birth is any merit it would be a practice to which we ought to pay a still more strict attention The young gentleman however  whom I mean to recommend for his great and peculiar worth is Mr Frank Henley the son of a person who is gardener and steward to Sir Arthur or rather what the people among whom you are at present would call his  homme d'affaires  But I must leave my friends to speak for themselves which they will do more efficaciously than can be done by any words of mine  END OF VOLUME I
