BELL near  Exeter Change  in the  Strand  and C ETHERINGTON at  York  M DCC LXXI  DEDICATION TO  Sir Francis Delaval  Knight of the  Bath    SIR  YOUR taste for and critical knowledge of Dramatic Compositions deserve an offering of more worth than the following trifle however considered merely as a mode to convey my sense of obligation conferred I hope it will at least appear an excuseable tresspass of  SIR  Your most respectful and very obedient servant The AUTHOR  July    PROLOGUE Written and Spoken by Mr GENTLEMAN  BEN JOHNSON  's name in ev'ry ear of taste  Must with respect and countenance be graced  No pen the lines of nature better drew  No wit or satire ever higher flew  An early pillar of the English stage  His pieces were true pictures of the age  Timeworn they feel impairyet still must please  Nervous and just though void of modern ease  Fashions in characters as well as cloaths  Change though less oft as wav'ring fancy flows  Witches and fairies with their midnight train  No longer revel on the blasted plain  Now ev'ry simpleton of britain's isle  At such a fraud as  Alchymy  would smile  Yet being only chang'd in name and shapes  Scarce one in ten the gilded bait escapes  Haste to the hall where law is sold like ware  How many long rob'd alchymsts ply there  What hopes to gudgeon clients they unfold  While empty quibbles turn to solid gold  See swarming quacksso public folly wills  Convert to gold their healthdestroying pills  Change Alley viewthat scene of transmutation  That base alchemic bubble of the nation  See beauty's self resign its brightest charms  And turn to gold in age's frozen arms  Search all the world examine ev'ry part  You'll find each man an alchymist at heart  In ev'ry clime we find if truth be told  The universal deity is gold  Whate'er of merit you perceive this night  Grant your old bard as his undoubted right  My brain has labouredfeebly I confess  Only to furnish a more modern dress  My weak endeavours let your candor raise  They hope indulgence though they reach not praise  Dramatis Personae  Abel Drugger  Mr WESTON  Subtle  Mr GARDNER  Face  Mr ROBSON  Sir Epicure Mammon  Mr GENTLEMAN  Knowlife  Mr FEARON  Headlong  Mr VANDERMERE  Miss Rantipole  Mrs DIDIER  Doll Tricksy  Mrs GARDNER  ADVERTISEMENT  AS the PROLOGUE has in part apologized for this alteration from BEN JOHNSON nothing more need be added but that it was meant to give Mr WESTON's established merit in the character of  Abel Drugger  more frequent familiar and compact opportunity of shewing itself than the Old Play can possibly afford upon comparison it will be found that very little of the original is retained but a general idea and the part of  Abel Drugger  to which however some additions have been made  THE TOBACONIST  ACT THE FIRST  SCENE I  Enter  SUBTLE  followed by  FACE  Subtle  NAY nay though thy name be Face and thou hadst a face of brass thou shalt not outface me  Face  Then must I be unable to handle a most excellent subject tho' shame and thee have long since parted I will so anatomize that calf's head of thine  Subtle  Calf's head Blood of my life I have a mind to mark my resentment in such legible characters upon that Tyburn visage of thine as will put thy features in mourning  Face  Come on then see whose stomach will bear bruising best I'll tickle those pampered sides  Subtle  A poor ignorant impertinent ungrateful wretch whose life to my disgrace be it spoken I have savedvile emblem of an empty cask much sound no contents canst thou forget the mouldy crusts Suffolk cheese and dead small beer on which thou wert starving in common with bareribbed rats and limping mice  Face  Mighty well mighty well master Subtle  Subtle  Have I not made thee an occasional captain am I not filling thy pockets as well as thy belly have I not taught thee dull as thou art to converse with and impose on various degrees of mankind have I not from the stupidest slave that ever marred common sense sharpened thy wit smoothed thy tongue polished thy manners regulated thy features to make thee capable of thriving in life and this treatment my hopeful recompence  Face  Not so fast not so fast master glibtongue give eccho fair playI do indeed confess myself indebted to thee for being a thriving pupil in the noble science of knavery of which I admit thee an able professor but as motives constitute or destroy obligation I ask what were thine to strengthen and further thy own iniquitous designs and if thou  talk'st of favour I can bring a powerful balance on my side to silence your modest worship  Subtle  With contempt I defy thee  Face  Nay then my tongue shall so buffet thee that thou shalt think half Billingsgate the seat of thy education let loose about thy ears and shrink back that knave's face of thine like a snail into its shell  Subtle  Mighty fine  Face  Remember St Giles's Scapegrace where I found thee a compleat emblem of poverty resembling the fruit of a gibbet seven years exposed to wind and weather not a coat to thy back a stocking to thy legs nor a shoe to thy feet  Subtle  Very well go on sir  Face  Did I not find thee tatterdemallion with a beard two inches long not having wherewithal to pay a penny barber squallid cheeks furrowed brows sunk eyes and chattering teeth crawling by the doors of cookshops to feed upon the steam of baked ox heads and shins of beef  Subtle  Tremble audacious villian at thy insolencefear my rage  Face  Did I not put thee into some liking snatch thee from Jane Shore's fate and when thou had'st not as much linen about thee as would furnish a tinder box did I not like a guardian genius bring thee to this house  Subtle  Yes thy master's house which like a hungry mastiff thou wast left to guard and for a single bone would have let in any thief  Face  Did I not enable thee to carry on the deceptions of alchymy fortune telling and algebra your minerals your vegetals and animals to fleece the credulous vulgar have not I provided you with conjuror's robes stills glasses furnaces coals and all other materials to carry on thy profitable farce answer me knave have I not done all this  Subtle  And answer me

Enter Tricksy  Tric  How now my masters I thought high words struck my ears say what churlish point blows the  wind from to make such a gloomy appearance of foul weather  Subtle  Slave there is no name vile enough for thee  Face  Call me any thing but Subtle and I care not  Tric  What tantrums are these I trow I find my ears were right some fiend has spread this mischief between ye why ye look as black at each other as a dark Christmass  Subtle  The dog is more hateful to me than cheese  Face  And thou to me more detestable than the fulsome steam of a tallowchandler's workshop  Tric  For

without being such ourselves what bring our golden scheme to so fair a prospect and let it according to your jargon vanish in fumothe old dispute revived I suppose about honesty when you know in your consciences that there is not a grain in either of you or if there was you would starve by it  Face  Why it is all his fault Doll  Subtle  I deny it  Tric  'Tis both your faults you tinder temper'd knaves you sputter at one another and yet have as little courage as honesty I know your high words and big looks you spend your lungs to bawl and strain your limbs to stride without any meaning what am I a partner in all your undertakings your impostures and shall I waste my wit for nothing must I encourage fools of various shapes and assume as many different characters as Mr What d' ye Callum

tremble at my vengeance I'll blow yeget a genteel reward for apprehending such notorious bites turn honest myself  and make those necks and ears you talk so lightly of tremble at the approach of wooden and hempen collars  Face  Then let him leave off grumbling like a bear that he has the heaviest part of our plan to execute  Subtle  So I have above one half the work yet not above a third of the profit besides ill language  Tric  And who begins it old snarler don't we perform the parts allotted us chearfully if your's exceeds today our's may match it tomorrow s'death I have a good mind to pull you by the nose for this  Subtle  Nay but dear DollDoll the softDoll the gentle  Tric  No wheedling Mr Morose but swear  Subtle  What wouldst thou have me swear  Tric  To leave idle disputation

Doll thou hast almost as many admirers as Hellen  Tric  Admirers if the frames were not gilded the pictures would be intolerable as for instance Abel Drugger whose formality of phiz and shallowness of scull might for a few visits make even melancholly smile then my slinkhaired methodist preacher Bawlwell who wooes me in the stile of a saint to make me in reality a devil  Subtle  Ha ha ha well said little volatile  Tric  Third that cumbersome repository of lewd thoughts Sir Epicure who batters my ears with such pomposity of phrase that I should always have a dictionary at hand to understand him

MISS RANTIPOLE  Face  There Madam is the gentleman I presume you want  Rant  A droll figure I vowan admirable character for Mrs Cornelyswell Mr Conjuror as I am told you are very intimate with the stars I am inclined for a little conversation with you and that we may better understand one anotherthere are a few guineas  Subtle  There is no language the stars understand or like better than what these speak  Rant  You must know sir I am the happiest creature alive in number and choice of admirers I have a soldier of spirit who swears to me a smirking parson who prays to me a Puritan who cants to me a Jemmy wit who rallies a gamester who prefers me to the four Queens and a Patriot who offers to sacrifice even liberty to my smiles  Face  Upon my word madam you at least have the pleasure of varietybut you'll soon be like Alexander have no more to conquer  Rant  Oh its charming beyond expression and though a little troublesome when the rivals meet yet I would not be without a numerous suite of worshippers for the worldthe delightful envy it raises in your sex and the enchanting bustle it causes amongst the otherthen the amorous manoeuvres of a glance to one a nod to another a leer to a third a smile to a fourth a beck to a fifth a wink to a sixth a sigh to a seventh the tip of my little finger to an eighth caring for none and yet kind to all is so Jantee so  alamode  so every thing that I would not sacrifice my state of conquest to be the matrimonial property ofofno not a Nabob or an East India Governor hung round with diamondsHusbandinsipid drowsy odious title  Subtle  Give me leave madam as I see the charms of your person though with the dim eyes of age to enquire the beauties of your pocket as thence perhaps we may properly estimate the violent attachment of your numerous admirers  Rant  What fortune you mean that sir I am not ashamed to explain having had these twelvemonth past by the will of my good old grandfather twenty thousand pounds at my own disposal  Face  Nay madam it is not at all wonderful that you should have an admirer for every thousandbesides being at your own disposal the fatigue and  danger of a trip to Scotland are rendered unnecessary  Rant  True sirat the age of sixteen I was very near making that trip as you call itI was then at a boarding school and listened to the soft sighs of Jemmy Goosequil an Attorney's clerk fond as Pyramus and Thisbe we agreed to elopeI got over the garden wall on a sweet moonlight night and posted as far as the river of matrimonial liberty Tweed when my surly foxhunting papa who loves a long chase at any rate took me prisoner horsewhipped my poor gallant and brought me back as melancholly as a turtle separated from its cooing mate  Subtle  I imagine Miss you have since perceived that it is necessary for parents to thwart the precipitate inclinations of youth  Rant  Ay but not upon old gruff's principlesat sixteen indeed I was a fond foolish credulous creature and thought of nothing but flames darts constancy and dyingif a young fellow looked but graveheigho I pitied him but now as lady Fanny Flirtem says if an army of lovers was before me with pistols at their ears daggers at their breasts running nooses round their necks or poison at their mouths I could look on with the most immoveable composure the true unfeeling fashionable indifference  Face  This is rather philosophical than humane  Rant  Humane ha ha ha and pray what have fine ladies to do with humanitythough there is a young Baronet in my train who could occasion some flutter here if he was a little more polished but the teizing creature is so pettish and so jealous and so grave and so wisepray Mr Conjuror could not you put him under the influence of some fashionable star and teach him not to rail so much at inconstancy Sohosquare the Winter Ranelagh and every species of gay lifeicod now I talk of gay life I'll give you a song upon the subject written by my rhiming swain which I intended to sing at the next masquerade in the character ofmum we must not tell before hand  Subtle  Madam your musical compliment will oblige us  Rant  Sings  To do what we please and to taste ev'ry joy  To set at defiance the purple wing'd boy  To sneer at the grave and to laugh at the coy  Such Such are the sweets of gay life  With each glance of our eyes to send forth a keen dart  To conquer at will each fine gentleman's heart  To be perfect in Hoylehow delightful his art  Such such are the sweets of gay life  To deck out our persons with fashion and grace  To shine out with splendor in each public place  And shew to advantage each beautiful face  Such such are the sweets of gay life  Unincumber'd with business unruffled with care  Possessing each object that's costly and rare  As brilliant as sun shineunbounded as air  Such such are the joys of gay life  Who ever refinement of pleasure would know  To Cornely's must hasten with hearts in full glow  No Paradise surely can vie with Soho  Or deal out such sweets of gay life  What avail musty rules of the grave and the wise  They may be perhaps fitted well for the Skies  But taste on this earth must such nonsense despise  And stick to the sweets of gay life  Face  A very agreeable combination of spirit and harmony  Rant  Well Mr Conjuror if you can give my BaronetI'll send him to see youa little more taste and lessen his gravity after I have had my fling seen all the world heard all the pretty things that can be said fretted a score of lovers to death and am on the brink of becoming an old maid perhaps I may sink into a domestic
