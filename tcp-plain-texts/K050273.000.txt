 THE CASE of the War in  ITALY  STATED BEING A SERIOUS ENQUIRY HOW FAR  GREATBRITAIN  IS Engaged to Concern it Self in the Quarrel between the Emperor and the King of  Spain  Pax Quaeritur Bello  LONDON  Printed for  T Warner  at the  BlackBoy  in  Paternoster Row  Price  d  THE CASE of the War in  ITALY  STATED  c  THE Eyes of  Europe  seem at this time to be turn'd wholly upon the King of  Spain  's New Undertaking against the Emperor The Reasons of his making this Attempt his Catholick Majesty has published by his Ministers and the Memorials or Letters which they have given in to the several Courts of the Princes where they reside fully express the Pretension of the King of  Spain  and the Reasons why he takes this Occasion to break with the Emperor  These Memorials or Letters are first The Letter of Seignior  Grimaldi  Secretary of State to the King of  Spain  directed to the  Spanish  Ambassadors or Residents at  Foreign Courts Secondly The Memorial of the Marquis  Beretti Landi  Minister for the King of  Spain  to the States General and the Memorial of the Prince  de Cellamere  at  Paris  to the Regent of  France  all on the same Subject and all tending to justify the Conduct of the King of  Spain  in this Affair besides the declaration by word of Mouth from the Marquis  de Monteleone  the Ambassador of  Spain  to his  Britannick  Majesty  The sum of all these Memorials for they are too long to repeat here may be drawn up and abridg'd in the following Heads  viz    st  That the Emperor does not acknowledge King  Philip  to be King of  Spain  but gives him only the Title of Duke of  Anjou  assuming to himself the stile and Dignity of King of  Spain    Spanish  Majesty likewise all the Titles attending the Possession of the  Spanish  Monarchy that He the Emperor whom the King of  Spain  therefore calls only  Arch Duke  has Erected a Council at  Vienna  which he calls the Council of  Spain  That he Confers Titles and Honours such as Grandee of  Spain  as if he was really King of  Spain  in Possession and the like    dly  That these things are Evedences of his resolving to attack King  Philip  and Chace him out of  Spain  it self if he was able  or when he shall be so and in the mean time takes all Occasions to shew himself a mortal Enemy    dly  That the Emperor Broke the Terms of Peace and Neutrality even as soon as they were made  viz  That when his Imperial Majesty consented by Treaty to quit  Catalonia  where in a few Days more he must have been overcome and been reduced to the necessity of having fallen into the King of  Spain  's Hands yet he did not quit the Towns and Strengths as he ought to have done by Consigning them into the King of  Spain  's Hands to whom they were to be surrendred but gave them over to the Rebels the  Catalans  encouraging them to hold out against his  Spanish  Majesty by promising to return and assist them which occasion'd the shedding of much Blood and the Expense of an Infinite mass of Treasure to reduce those Places to Obedience    thly  That he not only encourag'd the Rebel  Majorkins  in their Rebellion against his  Spanish  Majesty but actually sent them Ships Men Money Arms Provisions Ammunition  c  to support them in their Rebellion against the King of  Spain  Exhorting them also to maintain their Rebellion in hopes of farther Assistance    thly  That the Imperial Governor of the  Milanese  has by order from the Emperor Arrested and put in Prison the Abbot  Molinez  a Person Sacred by his Character  of Grand Inquisitor Reverend by his Age and who ought to have been so by the Pasports which were given him at  Rome  from the Pope with Approbation of Count  Gallas  the Imperial Minister there and lastly who having given no Offence in Person to the Emperor is visibly Arrested as an Affront to his  Spanish  Majesty and an Insult upon his Government    thly  That his Imperial Majesty has himself broken the Neutrality of  Italy  by extorting Immense Sums of Money from the Princes of  Italy  on pretence of its being their just Due to pay towards the carrying on His War against the  Turks  And  Lastly  That this being a particular Conjuncture for the King of  Spain  's Purpose favourable for his Designs and the like his  Spanish  Majesty thinks he cannot let slip so fair an Occasion as well respecting the Troubles in  Hungary  as the general Discontent of the People of  Italy  and their readiness to enter into Measures for the effectual delivering themselves out of the Hands of the House of  Austria  These are the General Heads of the Charge as may be seen by the said Memorials or Manifestoes of the  Spanish  Ministers to which I refer they having all been made publick in the common Printed Papers of the Town as to the pretence of the Emperor using Artifices to secure to himself the Succession  to the Estates of the Grand Duke of  Tuscany  That I look upon as Trifling and without Foundation and therefore not worth naming among the rest  It is not our business to enquire here whether these Objections are just and whether what is Alledged can be made good in Fact  viz  That the Emperor has done so and so as above Nor is it the present Question whether if these Allegations are just they are a sufficient Argument for the King of  Spain  to take up Arms and begin a War in  Italy  But the Design of this Tract is to Enquire how these things respect the other Powers of Christendom and what Part it is probable they may take in the Quarrel and by other Powers here I am to be understood to mean in particular the  Dutch  the Kings of  France  and  Britain  the King of  Sicily  and the Cantons of  Swisserland  what share they are like to have in the Quarrel and whether they are bound by the Treaty of Neutrality to Concern themselves in a War for the keeping the Possession of  Italy  to the House of  Austria  yea or no  I begin with the King of  Sicily  To make short with his Story I shall look on him as one of the Princes of  Italy  for such he  is We see his Majesty acting a very subtle Part as indeed it stands him in stead at this time to do It is true the  Imperialists  threaten him and notwithstanding all his Protestations of being resolved to pursue the Neutrality they mistrust him and seem as resolv'd to fall on him in their Way nay some say they resolve to begin with him No Man will be so weak as to ask what is his  Sicilian  Majesty's Business if he is attack'd but the Question with him seems to be whether his Majesty having now a very great Army on Foot in a Readiness for Action and apprehending the Imperialists will certainly attack him ought not by way of Prevention to begin first having so clear an Advantage and an Opportunity which it is very probable may not be offer'd again I mean as that of joyning with  Spain  This is the Question which the Politicians who consider not what is right or what is wrong but what is fittest to be done respecting the Interest of the Party I shall in brief state what I think will be the Case here and as therein I give only one Opinion let others judge as they see Cause and let the Event determine In a Word I say I think it seems unavoidable and the King of  Sicily  cannot be unconcern'd in a War if it follows and that his Majesty will not fail to oyn his Arms with the  K of  Spain  only that this cannot be expected till the  Spaniards  have landed a considerable Body of Men on the Coast of  Italy  either in the Kingdom of  Naples  or perhaps higher up towards the King of  Sicily  's own Country which is more than probable by the  Spanish  General's demanding Passage of the State of  Genoa  for an Army into the  Parmesan  This therefore being so near a Decision and at present representing it self to our View as unavoidable I lay it down as a thing most certain either voluntarily of himself or forced by the Imperialists themselves will certainly joyn with  Spain  in this new Enterprize and I must tell the Imperial Ministers who talk so loudly of the Certainty of the King of  Sicily  's Ruin in such a Case and let the Event be what it will there is great Reason to believe many if not all the Princes of  Italy  seem to resolve to run the Venture of it if the  Spaniards  give them but a little more Encouragement What their Dependence and Encouragement are Time will not fail to discover  I will not say but these Princes may have their several Grievances and may have just Reasons to complain of the Violences and Oppressions of the House of  Austria  I am willing in Compliment to their Integrity to  suppose tho' not to grant the Imperial Governours have perhaps exceeded their Commissions or that even their Commissions have been in some things invasive of the Right of the several Powers complaining contrary to Justice and to a Treaty of Neutrality and I will give these Complaints their full Weight when I come to examine the grand Question  viz  Whether for this they ought to take up Arms and destroy the Neutrality in which the preserving their Rights is not the only Question but by which the Ballance of Power in  Europe  is preserv'd In which Ballance of Power most if not all the other Powers of  Europe  are concern'd at least those Powers are of whom I am more particularly to speak  In this Circumstance then I lay down the State of things in  Italy  at this time  viz  That the Princes of  Italy  are in a present Disposition to Revolt and that the King of  Sicily  is in the same Case and that they only want a powerful Protection of some other Potentate to support them and that therefore we may expect if the King of  Spain  appears thus able to protect them they will certainly joyn with him whenever a powerful Army appears  The King of  Spain  's Pretensions then and the Princes of  Italy  being thus stated the  Plot among them seems to be discover'd  viz  That the King of  Spain  on the Foundation of his own Grievances only shall begin the War and according to the Success his  Spanish  Majesty meets with the other Princes shall declare themselves so that if the King of  Spain  should not be able to carry on the Design they may all retreat to their Solemn Protestations of not being concern'd in the Quarrel of  Spain  and may make smooth Water with the Emperour when they find themselves unable to raise a Storm But on the contrary if the King of  Spain  can force his Way into  Italy  and dispossess the Imperialists so as to protect them then they will declare themselves  Upon this Foot I shall treat the Affair in general if I do any Wrong to the Princes of  Italy  it will be time to acknowledge it when the Wrong appears  But to proceed to the History of Fact The King of  Spain  according to this Scheme has begun the War and serving himself of the Emperor's being perfectly destitute of any Marine Power and of the unhappy Conjuncture of a furious War with the  Turks  he invades the Dominions of his Imperial Majesty in particular the Island of  Sardignia  which the  Spaniards  having a powerful Fleet and the Imperial Government not  three Men of War could no ways be reliev'd  Here we stop a while and make a Transition at once to the Courts of  GreatBritain  and the  Hague  The  Spaniards  were not so ignorant as not to know or so dull as not to think of it That the Powers or Courts above mentioned who had all severally so great a Share in making the Capitulation or Treaty for the Neutrality of  Italy  would interest themselves in this Affair as having charg'd themselves with the Guarantee of that Neutrality and therefore his  Spanish  Majesty caus'd not only the Letters and Memorials mentioned above to be presented in the Nature of Manifesto's to the said Courts but made often a repeated Proposal of stopping their Proceedings till time might be given to the pacifick Princes and Powers who he thus appply'd to by such Methods as they thought most proper to bring his Imperial Majesty to listen to Reason and to do Justice to his  Spanish  Majesty's Pretensions  These Proposals being taken  Ad Referendum  did indeed entitle the said Princes and Powers to make the needful Representations to the Emperor and to make use of all the good Offices they found for their Purpose to induce the Emperor to refer likewise the Matters in Dispute to their Mediation as the King of  Spain  likewise offer'd to do  By the way I must here observe as I go in order to make every thing clear to the Reader of this Enquiry That these Powers were more or less all of them engag'd before as Guarantees of the Treaty of Neutrality in  Italy  That tho' their being so Guarantees qualified them the better to be Mediators yet this Mediation if they had accepted it does not by any Means tye up their Hands from or lessen the Right they have to act as Guarantees of the Neutrality of  Italy  That we do not find in the Proposal any Conditions made with them that this Offer should subsist only in case they declar'd themselves accepting the said Mediation We do not find that the King of  GreatBritain  their High Mightinesses the States General and the Regent of  France  did actually engage in any such Mediation But that being willing to do all good Offices for the preserving the Peace and Tranquility of  Europe  they have concerned themselves in the most earnest Manner to his Imperial Majesty in what the King of  Spain  demands and to induce him to accept of the Proposals of his  Spanish  Majesty in Order to a Treaty  But while this is depending and before they have been able to obtain any Answer or enter into any Negociation on the Proposal we find  Spain  entirely regardless of the offer'd Suspension of her Conquests and  taking no Notice of the Engagements she had enter'd into with his  Britanncik  Majesty and other Powers as above I say we find  Spain  vigorously pushing on her Advantages making Preparations for new Enterprizes and even by her Ambassador the Prince  de Cellamare  at the Court of  France  declaring publickly that she intends to do so this last Declaration being indeed so inconsistent with those mentioned above deserves to be remark'd as follows  SIR  THE loose Rumours and the surprizing News which have been current some time since at this Court as well as in the other Courts of  Europe  that the King my Master designed for some secret Enterprize the Ships and Troops which he had assembled at  Barcelona  together with the Instances continual Representations and extraordinary Applicacations made at  Paris  and  London  by the  German  Ministers and their Friends who were alarm'd upon the first Advice of such an Enterprize out of a Remorse of their own Conscience have kept me to this time under an Uneasiness which your Excellency who knows sufficiently my Zeal for the Glory of the King my Master and how devoted I am to his Service may easily imagine as well as the extreme Agitation those Rumours have produc'd in  me but that Trouble was throughly calmed by a Letter which I received from Monsieur the Marquis  Grimaldo  whereof I have annexed a Copy to this Memorial which I have the Honour to deliver to your Excellency  I have the Satisfaction to see therein the Reasons that have induced the King my Master to undertake to recover  Sardignia  by Force of Arms set forth in such a manner as ought to perswade all the World of the Justice of this Expedition My Penetration tho' not very extensive had already afforded me a Glymspe of the Solidity of those Reasons which are grounded on the Infractions made by the Court of  Vienna  of the solemn Treaties for the Evacuation of  Catalonia  and  Majorca  and the Nonperformance of the Conditions on which the Suspension of the Arms in  Italy  had been concluded Such Contraventions can never be forgotten  I put therefore into the Hands of your Excellency a Copy of the Letter of M the Marquis  Grimaldo  that you may be entirely and fully porswaded of the Justice of the Arms of his Catholick Majesty and be able more exactly to acquaint the Regency therewith I cannot add any thing to that Letter but a Reflection  viz  That as the King my Master has forbore hitherto to attack the ArchDuke in the Dominions he has usurp'd from him upon  two Motives equally wise and important so he does not do it at present but at the utmost Extremity and after the Archduke has violated all the Regards due to Crowned Heads and after he has put upon him the Affront of seizing with Violence the Great Inquisitor of  Spain  The first Motive is that the King my Master whose Courage and Greatness of Soul are worthy of his Birth and his Throne resents much more what wounds his Dignity than the Enterprizes that are made chiefly against his Interest of which I am an unexceptionable Witness having seen to what a degree his generous Courage was provoked when he heard the unjust Violence and odious Usage suffer'd since the loss of the Kingdom of  Naples  in the Prisons of  Milan  on the Part of the  Germans  by the Viceroy the Marquis de  Villena  and the other General Officers who serv'd under him amongst whom I have the inestimable Glory to have been distinguished by a particular Attention of the Enemies of the King my Master to abuse me  Your Excellency will immediately perceive the scond Motive The last Affront offer'd by the Archduke to the King my Master at a time that he did not expect to receive a new one has had the effect of a new Weight put into a pair of Scales already full and has immediately turn'd the Ballance  His Majesty would have nevertheless made a Sacrifice of his Resentment to the Holy Maxims which are the Rule of his Conduct and would have given it up as a new Victim to the Good of Christendom if he had not seen that the Naval Forces of the  Venetians  and the Princes their Allies were Masters of the Sea in the  Levant  and lastly if he had not been fully convinc'd that he was under a necessity to make an Enterprize of great Moment in order to prevent new Outrages and confound the Pride of his Enemies who to satisfy the Pride of their Hatred and terrify People by their Wickedness have seized a Clergyman whom Old Age and Infirmities render'd an Object of Compassion trampling under foot by their cruel Usage against his Person the Laws of Nations and the Treaties which ought to have protected him against all Imprisonments and the rather because with the Consent of the Minister of the Archduke at  Rome  he took his Way thro' the  Milanese  with a Pass given him by the Pope The Archduke in violating that Pass has shewn little Respect to the Supream Head of that Church against whose Enemies he boasts so much to fight at this time  I pray God to preserve your Excellency as long as I wish it Sign'd  The Prince de CELLAMARE  Before I enter then upon the main Question of a War I think here occurs a particular or previous Question to be Considered  viz  Is this proceeding of  Spain  an Affront to the King of  GreatBritain  and to all the Powers to whom those pacifick Proposals were made and who so willingly began their good Offices with his Imperial Majesty or is it not Is it using his Majesty well or is it oftering the highest Contempt to his Person and to the Interposition of his Interest as is possible to be offer'd Is it not a Breach of Faith and Honour In a Word Is it not dealing Deceitfully and Dishonourably with His Majesty making use of his good Offices to Amuse and Deceive the Prince who they were proposed to serve and in a Word making a Property of the three most Potent Powers of  Europe  in order to advantage himself of their Civilities and as before he had Deceived  Europe  in the matter of his Armament by Sea on Petences and indeed Promisses of fitting out a Fleet for the Assistance of the  Venetians  against the  Turks  so now Deceiving the Emperor by the fraud of a specious Proposal which no Prince could have such mean thoughts of the King of  Spain  as to believe he was not sincere in It cannot be suggested that in this the King of  GreatBritain  is used well or used really as one Crown'd Head ought to use another nor can it be suggested but that when Occasion presents  and Circumstances concurs His Majesty knows very well how to Resent it and is not without the Means of making his  Spanish  Majesty sensible of it  But our question at home is it seems of another nature and indeed something of a new fashion  viz  whether we shall be willing the Honour of the  British  Throne shall be so far asserted as that His Majesty shall upon the single Point of being Affronted Engage in this matter or whether we shall leave the  British  Powers to be so far depreciated as to take no notice of such Usage and consequently to be Affronted on all occasions by all the Kings of the Earth  However for once and to gratify the Opposers far beyond their Expectations and to leave room for all their specious soft ways of covering these things over I shall give way to their Harangues upon the circumstances of the Nation  viz  That we have lately been involv'd in a heavy War which has brought an insupportable Burthen of Debt upon the whole Kingdom That we are but just entering upon Methods for working out of those things and have scarce tasted the sweet part of any one Article worth naming That all the Savings of the last Year have not eased the People of one Tax neither can they in some years yet  to come and that it will be a great many years before we can possibly give such Ease to the poor People as to bring their living and keeping their Families to be as Cheap to them as before and yet their Provisions are even dearer than in time of War That all neighbouring Countries are reducing their Expence and lessening their Debts and in a fair way to be out of Debt before us even tho' no new War should be Commenced But that every year brings with it some new load upon  Britain  to keep her low as for Example the Rebellion for one Year the  Swedish  Affair for another and if now we Engage in a War with  Spain  we are in a fair way to continue the Charge of all the Taxes and Funds that are upon us besides what new Demands may be necessary and so the Nation will for ever sink under a weight already own'd to be insupportable  To all these things they add the supposition of a War with  Spain  the Consequences of it to our Commerce which after a long Decay and suffering infinite Convulsions in the last War began to revive again in all parts of the World but will immediately be overwhelm'd in the most sensible parts of it such as the Trade to  Spain  it self the Assiento Contract the Trade to  Italy  and the like and perhaps the Effects of our Merchants and SouthSea Company  c  be seized by the  Spaniards  This is a long Detail of plausibles which indeed our People begin to fill their Mouths with in this Case and in some of the particular Cases they are not without weight It is true our Debts are many and great and the Nation wants a recess of Taxes it is true our  Spanish  Trade is Considerable and the Effects of our Merchants are Great Abroad and may be liable to be Confiscated by the  Spaniards  I'll add to this That we have Reason to believe from the Wisdom and the pacifick Disposition of His Majesty himself from the Prudence and Moderation of his Councils from the just Desire the King must necessarily have to restore the Tranquility of His Subjects and from a willingness once to Enjoy his new Dominions in Peace and see his People flourishing in Arts and Trade by which they are now in a fair prospect of making themselves more than ever the Greatest and most Opulent Nation in the World  But against all these Things doubtless there are other matters that weigh something in the Scale of this Question and which merit to be considered by themselves I shall fetch nothing remote to make good the deficiency for the Subject is but too fruitful of Argument and the Necessity will appear  even at first sight if we go back Historically but a little way into things past and compare them with the visible prospects of things to come  The Great and indeed the true Reason which was always alleg'd for the pushing on the late War at so vast an Expence and the continuing it thro' so many Difficulties as at first for many years obstructed the Success of it was the fixing the Ballance of Power in  Europe  It was for this That so many Powers of  Europe  Confederated to reduce the Exorbitant Power of  France  by whose Conquests and Ambitious Designs that Ballance was destroyed and the Nations of  Europe  in Danger of submitting at last to an Universal Tyranny in the Conqueror  It was for this that the Glorious King  William  fix'd the  Pyrenean  Treaty as the boundary of his Demands from  France  and declar'd if  Spain  went beyond those limits he would be then as much a  Frenchman  as he was then a  Spaniard  It was for this that such long Struggles were made to prevent the  Spanish  Monarchy falling into the Hands of the House of  Bourbon  It was for this we Complain'd so warmly of the Measures in the last Reign and of the Conditions of the late Peace as betraying the Confederacy and destroying the Great End of the War by giving up  Spain  to King  Philip  who at that time was entirely in the Interest of  France  It was for this all the Renunciations of the Treaty of  Ʋtrecht  were entred into and the weight of the Argument acknowledg'd even in those very things which were said Eventually to betray it and by those very People who have been so openly Charg'd with leaving it unprovided for or not sufficiently secur'd  It was on the Pretence of this being sufficiently secur'd that the People who made the Peace of  Ʋtrecht  justify themselves and tell us that it was a good Peace and that it fully answered the end of the War  It must then follow that even those very People ought to be the first to declare that what ever Prince breaks in upon that Ballance Destroys the Efficacy of the Peace and brings us into the same necessity of renewing a War that there was at that time for Beginning and Carrying it on  As the Ballance of Power was the Reason of the War so it is the only Basis of the Peace whatever Prince makes an attempt upon that Ballance declares War against all the rest as they are naturally Guarantees of the whole or else they tacitly declare that there was no just Reason at first from the Interruption of that Ballance to begin the former War much less to carry it on as they did which would Arraign all the Princes of the Confederacy and Charge them with Ambition Unjust Invasion and Blood  These Points carry their own Evidence with them and admit so little dispute that it would seem a meer spinning out our Discourse to go about proving or farther explaining any part of them all the publick Transactions Declarations of War Memorials and Treaties which were severally dispers'd thro'  Europe  in the Time when these things were done are full of it and may be all call'd up as Evidences to this one Great Principle of the Policies of  Europe    viz  That Preserving the Ballance of Power in  Europe  was the Reason of the War and the Grand Preliminary of the Peace  This then being laid down as a Fundamental to argue from it follows to enquire in few Words Is the dispossessing the House of  Austria  of their Dominions in  Italy  and  reuniting those Dominions to the  Spanish  Monarchy a Breach of this Ballance of Power or is it not  I need go no further for Arguments to set forth the Importance of those  Italian  Dominions than those made use of by the Gentlemen who magnified them as most mighty Additions to the  Austrian  Greatness when they would have perswaded us that giving those Parts to the Emperor would make him too great for the rest of the World and overthrow that Ballance they were given to preserve  If then those Dominions whose Dependencies and Influencies are indeed equal to their Power were scarce thought safe to be given to the Emperor and were not thought safe to remain to the King of  Spain  because of the Ballance which would thereby be in Danger How then can it consist with the Ballance to have them snatch'd out of the Emperor's Hands again and return back to the same Hand from whence they were taken  This Consideration alone obliges not  GreatBritain  only but even the whole Confederacy as one Man to Declare against this Invasion of the King of  Spain  and to oblige him to put a Stop to his Attempts  or make War upon him otherwise the End of the late War is defeated and the Effect of the late Peace is destroy'd  Nor is it sufficient to say the Emperor had those Dominions conquer'd for him and put into his Hands and he ought to take Care to maintain his Possession for if the Emperor is by any Incident of War  as the present War with the  Turks  for Example  expos'd to the Possibility of a Surprize it would shew a very ill Concern for the general Good of  Europe  to let his Dominions which we thought our selves so much concern'd to get for him be lost again because he the Emperor may not be able to prevent it  It was for our own Sakes and for the Publick Safety of  Europe  in which the whole Confederacy were concern'd that the War was carried on it was not to aggrandize the House of  Austria  that these Dominions were conquer'd but to weaken the opposing Enemies whose Power was too great and they were allotted to the Emperor not because his Arms had Conquer'd them for without the Help of the Confederates he neither did conquer them nor could have Conquer'd them but because it was meet in Order to preserve this great Article of the Ballance I say it was meet for the Good  of all  Europe  that the Emperor should have them  Likewise speaking of the present Conjuncture it is not meerly in Compliment to the Emperor whose immediate Interest or Family we have no Concern in that we are interested in this Affair but it is the common Interest of  Europe  the same which so many Years War was carried on for and the same which the Peace was or ought to have been made for For this common Interest it is meet that these Places these Dominions in  Italy  should remain to the House of  Austria  and they must remain to that House or that Ballance be so far destroy'd and the Ends of the Confederates are not answer'd  It remains then to judge whether  Great Britain  can quietly and unconcernedly look on and see the great Ends for which they laid out their Blood and Treasure with so much Chearfulness and for so many Years destroy'd at once and a Foundation laid for the same Necessity of Blood and Treasure to be laid out again Can we sit still and see Measures taken which have in themselves a direct Tendency to renew the War Those pacifick Gentlemen who plead so earnestly in Behalf of Peace should tell us the Meaning of the ancient well known  Maxim  Pax quaeretur Bello  and whether a timely Exerting the Strength which is now in our Hands may not be the only Way to establish Peace and prevent War  It is much easier to keep things in the Posture they are in than to restore them again after the Blow is given  Italy  is a large Country a Conjuncture offers to the ambitious Views of the King of  Spain  which perhaps may be in it self tempting enough the delicious Morsel seems as it were dropping into his Mouth the Discontents of the People there are represented as very great and perhaps they are so it may be the  Germans  have not treated them very kindly they have oppress'd them with heavy Taxes preferr'd Foreigners to the Places and Preferments which the Natives have claim'd a Right to carried away their Native Troops to serve the Emperor in his Wars in  Hungary  Extorted great Sums of Money and the like What can we say to this had they applied to any Foreign Princes to have interceeded for them to his Imperial Majesty none of the Confederates would have refus'd their good  Offices  as far as the Custom of Nations would admit one Prince to concern himself in the Government of another But that these Grievances should entitle them to Revolt and to go back to a Prince from whom  the whole Interest of  Europe  was concern'd to separate them This quite alters the Case And to say we must sit still and permit and suffer it as we have acted in the same kind our selves and from the Principles of Liberty we insist upon for our selves this is saying nothing to the purpose for our Views are in this the Liberties of  Europe  and not the Liberties of  Italy  the first we are Nationally concern'd in not the last Nay if they were together in one bottom we should no otherwise be concern'd in the Liberties of  Italy  than as they were on one bottom with those of  Europe  but when they are opposite to one another the Case is quite alter'd The particular Rights of the  Italian  Princes or People are quite out of the question the thing before the Confederates is the preserving that Ballance which is the Foundation of the Liberties of all  Europe  Nor can we say in this Case that the Confederacy is Dissolv'd and the Affair is now no more a Common Concern The Common Interest is the same and the Princes as I said even Natural Guarrantees for the preserving it  Much might be said here for the Nature of this War the Injustice of the manner as well as that of the pretences for it But  it is true these regard the Emperor rather than us However I shall collect the Particulars that we may view them and that the World may judge of what Honour what Equity is to be expected from those Powers who can satisfy themselves to give  Europe  Cause for such Complaints as these Some of them are to be found in the Pope's Letter to the King of  Spain  where his Holiness expostulates warmly and even almost calls it perfidious Treatment  viz  That his  Spanish  Majesty promises and engages his Royal Word to him the Pope that he would not offer any Disturbance to his Imperial Majesty's Dominions in  Italy  during his being thus engag'd in a War with the  Turks  That his  Spanish  Majesty engaged to his Holiness to send a powerful Fleet into the  Levant  in Aid of the Christian Princes against the  Turks  which Fleet was to joyn the  Venetians  and act in Conjunction with the other Auxiliaries whereas on the contrary this Fleet was not only not sent to the  Levant  against the  Turks  but has been employ'd against the Christian Emperor at the same time when his Imperial Majesty had employ'd his whole Force to resist the Enemy of the Christian Name and not only has been thus employ'd but the  Venetians  have been thereby abandon'd and left to struggle with the superior Force of their Enemies to  their great and unspeakable Loss and Disappointment and to the great Hazard of Christendom and the  Turks  being hereby left Masters of the Seas after two bloody Engagements which had the  Spanish  Fleet been joyn'd would either not have been fought or if they had the Christans might have obtain'd a most glorious Victory or at least the Triumphs of the Infidels had been prevented and the Effusion of the Christian Blood been saved That in order to this Equipment for the Service of Christendom his  Spanish  Majesty demanded of his Holiness a Brief for the raising a great Sum of Money from the Clergy of  Spain  which his Holiness granted Likewise a Hat was insisted for the Abbot now Cardinal  Alberoni  upon the granting which and the King of  Spain  's promises of sending the said Squadron with all Speed against the  Turks  was renewed yet all these Engagements were laid aside and the Power rais'd to fight with the Enemies of Christ turn'd against the Christian Emperor in a Manner so surprizing as to the Faith and Honour of his  Spanish  Majesty as is not to be express'd in better Terms than in the Pope's Letter abovesaid to which I particularly refer  It is true as I have observed that these Breaches of Faith and Honour do not in particular affect us or relate to  Britain  but the Reader may consider them and compare them with the Memomorials and Declarations of the Marquis  de Beretti Landi  in  Holland  and some the like here wherein his  Spanish  Majesty offers or promises to stop his Preparations and proceed no farther than the Conquest of  Sardignia  but leave the Matters in Dispute with the Emperor to the Mediation of his  Britannick  Majesty and their High Mightinesses the States General  c  And yet as all Advices now say and even the King of  Spain  's Minister in  France  acknowledges his  Spanish  Majesty resolves to push his Advantages to the utmost in Pursuit of his Quarrel with the Emperor  I am loth to make indecent Reflections upon Persons exalted to the Dignity of Sovereign Princes and always retain a Reverence to the Majesty of Crown'd Heads and therefore forbear all those Reflections which some People make upon his  Spanish  Majesty as a Branch of the House of  Bourbon  suggesting that such things as these seem to be Copying after the Pattern of  France  I wish his  Spanish  Majesty would adhere to the Maxims of  Honour so strictly adher'd to and so nobly practis'd by some of his glorious Ancestors on the Throne of the  Spanish  Monarchy rather than send us back to his particular Progenitors or to a Court where such things have formerly been too much practis'd and which I mention with the more Caution as the World seems to acknowledge the Court of  France  it self is acted now by other Principles and may be expected in a few Years to establish other Maxims as well of Policy as of Honour differing from those which brought it so eminently to the Gate of Destruction  I see nothing can be said then why the King of  Spain  should be suffer'd unopposed to push on his present Designs which are founded on such Trifling pretences and on such Dishonourable Measures unless we can say that we have no Concern in the General G  od of  Europe  and that we are not as much  oncern'd to keep any new Power from Growing too Formidable and Exorbitant in  Europe  as we shall be afterwards to pull it down and if it will be our Concern as most certainly it must to reduce every Exorbitance of Power in  Europe  and preserve the Ballance on which the Tranquility of  Europe  Depends it must be our  rudence to prevent the first rise of such Exorbitance  As to the disadvantages to our Commerce Abroad our inability to Engage in the Expence at Home our being in Debt and oppress'd with Taxes and the like they are all Granted and I make no doubt that as it is natural to infer from thence that we should by no Means Engage in any New Expence if it be possible to avoid it so I believe as is said above That His Majesty will not be prevail'd on to use Force in this Case if all possible Good Offices between the Parties can prevent it and if Reason will take place in a Word that His Majesty will not bring us into a War without an absolute and apparent Necessity  But let us not Depreciate our Country so much or lay our selves so low neither as to suggest that we cannot do what we cannot in Honour and Justice avoid that would be to say We are so weakned by the late War that we are not able even to resist an Enemy if we are Attack'd  If our Power is Contemn'd if the Honour of the  British  Crown is slighted if Princes come to think so meanly of  Britain  as not to think it worth while to keep their Words with us it is indeed attacking us They that will break their Promises with  Great Britain  How long do we think they would be before they would break the Peace  with his Majesty if they found it for their advantage to do it  To be Treated thus is to be attack'd in the worst manner and Great Princes have always resented the breach of Faith with them as the worst Affront that could be put upon them and I hope none will suggest in this Case that a Breach of Faith with the King is not a Breach of Faith with the Kingdom and that in a manner more particularly provoking  As to our Trade perhaps it may be true that the King of  Spain  may take some advantages against our Merchants but let such People who are frighted at those appearances remember what infinite Advantages our superiority at Sea gives our Subjects in War with  Spain  let them remember Queen  Elizabeth  's Reign when the whole Nation was visibly enrich'd by a War with  Spain  and to this let me add should we now heartily set about a War with  Spain    Spain  giving the Occasion it is no hard matter to shew how infinite Advantages may be made of it in the  Spanish WestIndies  Capable to make full Reparation for all the Damages our Trade can suffer But of that hereafter  Laslty  Let it be observ'd that this Discourse does not tend to an immediate Declaring War against the King of  Spain  it takes it for granted that Necessity obliges some Princes of  Europe  to joyn to preserve the Neutrality of  Italy  and as has been hinted to the  Spaniards  to act against those that would break that Neutrality if this leads us to act against the King of  Spain  it is not  Britain  but the King of  Spain  that leads us to it and if in doing this the King of  Spain  takes if for a Breach of the Peace it is his  Spanish  Majesty that begins the War and not the King of  Britain  and the Consequences must lye at their Door and not at ours  FINIS
