 THE EVIDENT APPROACH OF A WAR And Something of The NECESSITY of It In Order to Establish PEACE and Preserve TRADE  Pax Quaeritur Bello  To which is Added An Exact PLAN and DESCRIPTION of the BAY and CITY of GIBRALTAR  LONDON  Printed And Sold by J ROBERTS in  WarwickLane  and A DODD in the  Strand  Price  s    d    THE PREFACE  THREE Things in this Work seem to call for a Word or two of Preface but I shall be very Brief  The Unreasonableness of our Impatience to know the Certainty of things before our Governors thought fit to explain them call'd aloud for some Reproof  The Apprehensions some People were under or pretended to be under for our Publick Credit and for our Commerce in case of a War Neither of which seem to be in the least Danger call'd as loud for  ditto  The Officious Entring upon this Subject tho' ever so well intended seems to call for some Apology  The Author thinks the two first are sufficiently defended in the Manner of reproving them and adds nothing to it for that  Reason and for the Last as he has taken all possible Care to give no Offence and that the whole Tenour of the Work is evidently calculated for the Honour Interest and Service of His Majesty and the whole  British  Nation and perfectly abstracted from all private Views or Desires He humbly hopes no Slip of the Pen if such should be tho' he has with the utmost Care guarded against that also shall be misconstrued to his Prejudice  THE Evident  Approach  of a WAR c  CHAP I  A short Introduction with a Remark upon the Impatience of some People to know beforehand whether we shall have  Peace  or  War  The Reason of their uneasy Haste and something of Who the People are Also an Enquiry whether our Stocks and Publick Credit should not Rise rather than Fall upon the Prospect of a War  WHEN all the Politicians of the Town are consulting their Oracles upon this Important Subject and that the first Question in all Conversation is  Peace  or  War  I hope if I may not give my own Opinion I may be a little merry with those that do  Indeed if we go to the Merit of the Case I cannot see why every  British  Freeholder may not claim a Right to talk of it and enquire a little into it modestly and as becomes them since in most Cases that I meet with if any Body has a Right to enquire into the Rate of a Thing 'tis those who pay for it  War and Peace in  Great Britain  are notwithstanding all our Privileges in the Breast of the King 'tis a Branch of the Prerogative no Body disputes it and I suppose 'tis the Prerogative of most of the Kings of  Europe  also and so 'tis meet it should be  Let the Kings Name a' God make a War or a Peace  Let 'em Fight or give o'er as their Majesties please  Let's be anxious no more whatever's our Doom  Tho' we Fight all the World let's be Easy at Home  Leaving then the Superficials for the Superficial to refine upon let us see what it is the Town is so restless about For my Part I don't see the People I speak of half so much concern'd about the Thing it self as about their not knowing it  beforehand  a certain Hint of their Meaning which is in a Word that they want to make a Bubble of it and that before  it begins too Who may be bubbled by it when it comes is a Question by it self  And how unaccountable is this Imparience among us Why cannot the Town be easy and let things go on in the ordinary Course If a War is for our Advantage 'twill be good News when it comes if not bad News comes fast enough Let us have Patience we most hear of it in the End or Taxes must be lighter than usual in like Cases  But there is a Figure in all this Speech More intended than is express'd How happens it else that those People are most concerned to be at a Certainty about a War who are like to have the least Hand in it when it comes  Latet anguis in berba  If a War was just now Declared the People who are thus eager with their Enquiries may appear to have no manner of Concern in it one way or other  They are always most busy who have least to do  In a Word the present Haste we are in to know what shall be is not a meer Curiosity and Impatience but 'tis a Bite they want to be the first in the Secret and to know it before their Neighbours for Uses and Purposes and these Uses and Purposes are worth our Inquiry after  Some are of Opinion and I among the rest that the Curiosity of the Times should not be satisfy'd and that much is to be learnt tho' perhaps not so much to be got by the State of Uncertainty Men are in at this Time At least this is to be learnt that People  within Doors  see what Fools we are  without Doors  to think we understand them  Statesmen always gain by being secret If they have nothing at all upon the Anvil say nothing or mean nothing when they speak they always pass for Politicians when they are Private and we will have it that they are wise Men when they are doing nothing tho' it be only because they have nothing to do  But why are we  without Doors  so impatient to know what perhaps no Body here can tell us and why do we not enquire where it is to be known Is this the Place for the Question to be started in Or is  Madrid  and  Vienna  the proper Center of the Intelligence  Who do we ask And why do we talk of it here 'Tis plain his Majesty has resolved if possible to preserve the Peace If 'tis to be a War I think you should ask the King of  Spain  the Emperor the  Czarina  and those Heroes of War the  Poles  who talk of Fighting as if the World durst not look them in the Face Happy  Strangely Happy  is this Age that the only Nations that seem eager for a War are those that are  least able to carry it on and those that seem forwardest for Fighting are those that when they come to it have been always forwardest to run away  To hear the  Spaniards  talk of fitting out Ships of War and the  Poles  of raising Armies I must confess if I were to speak freely upon the Subject and any Man who I thought worth an Answer should ask me Whether we should have a War with these  Spaniards  and  Muscovites  I should answer  some little Articles excepted  I am afraid not  To hear the  Poles  threaten the King of  Prussia  talk of his doing Homage to them for Part of his Country reject the Memorials of the Protestants and order their Troops their Invincible Poltroons to march to the Frontiers methinks 'tis of a Piece with the Orders of their late Dyet to dispose of two Millions of  Polish  Florins when 'tis said they have but in their Exchequer  Then as I said to hear the  Spaniard  talk of fitting out Ships of War when all  Spain  is not able to furnish Seamen to hear of their furnishing the Emperor with three Millions  per Ann  by way of Subsidy when they can't bring home their Plate Fleet from Abroad for fear of eight Men of War and can hardly borrow Crowns in all their Seven Kingdoms at Home These are merry Things it must be allow'd and fit for little else in my Opinion but to be laugh'd at  To hear from the  Baltick  that the  Czarina  has order'd her Fleet to be fitted out Early in the Spring when she has lately let us see that if  English  Men of War appear they dare not look abroad And then for fitting them out EARLY that's another Jest too as if they could get out before we could get in or that they could Sail over the Ice and put to Sea when their Ports are frozen up For my Part I can hardly believe they talk so at  Petersburgh  I think they can never be so silly I am rather of Opinion our Newsmongers make it for them just as they did the other Day the  French  laying up great Magazines at  Luxemburgh  which is a City in the Hands of the Emperor one of the Barrier Towns The  Muscovites  can no more come out into the Ocean without our Leave or without fighting our Fleet and beating it too than their Ships can fly over the Mountains If they design such things as are talk'd of and to come into the Ocean with a Fleet they must change the Scene of their Marine Affairs and go and build Men of War at  ArchAngel  or in  Nova Zembla  and then they may indeed go to Sea without Interruption but 'till they do that they may cease concerning themselves in the Naval  Affairs of  Europe  and if they do it they will be little more than laugh'd at  These are the terrible People to whom we should go with our Important Question and of whom we should so submissively ask whether they please to give  Peace  or  War  to the so much weaker Kings of  France  and  Great Britain Why should we not ask of them that know  It is true they are scarce worth our Notice in the Case before us and that in my Opinion makes the Question about  Peace  and  War  the less Important and our Impatience about it seems the more Enigmatick What mighty Haste are we in and what great Stress do we lay upon a War with such People as Heaven knows are hardly worth the Question and who as the  Turks  said once to the  Muscovites hardly knew how to make War and were not worth making Peace with  But to bring all this home to our Selves and look into the Inside of Things with our Eyes open and the Mists of Art cleared a little up and so talk something gravely to it If the Enemies which we are like to have upon our Hands  supposing a War  are such as I have hinted at Why all this Concern about  Peace  or  War  with them Why so anxious to know things beforehand Why so much Noise about nothing There must be more in it of one Kind if there is not of another it cannot be all meer Curiosity meer  Athenianism  an Enquiry for meer Tittle Tattle and for the Pleasure of a Tale  The Case is plain all this Part is of a mean and scandalous Original hardly worth naming 'tis the ALLY and the JOBBERS that make the greatest Part of the Noise and they want to be answered only that they may know how to  Put  and  Refuse  how to  Sell out  or  Buy in  and to make a Bubble of the War before it begins  Now as this is in it self a Trifle not worth spending two Words about much less to ground such a Clamour upon a thing below Reproof too mean for Satyr has neither Jest or Earnest in it and circulates between the Fs and the Ks only beginning and ending within and among themselves so I had not dirty'd my Fingers with it here only to introduce a Superior Enquiry with it and which may be of some Use to us to speak of upon this Occasion and some others also that may follow  This more significant Enquiry is as follows  "Why should the Certainty of a War or of a Peace influence the Price of our Stocks that is to say the Publick Credit one way or other  'Tis indeed for the sake of this Question that I mention these People and begin my Discourse with what would otherwise look so trifling I must confess if the Question was put another way I could give a more direct Answer to it and support that Answer with better Reasons  I mean thus  If the Question was Whether the Certainty of a Peace or War ought to influence the Publick Credit and the Price of Stocks one way or other I say if this was the Question I should without the least Hesitation answer in the  Negative  it ought not any way to affect the Credit or the Funds no not in the least and 'tis unaccountably foolish that it should be otherwise  If I should incline to give it one way or other and say which way should the Publick Credit be most affected I should answer That a War should make Stocks rise not sink them and I should value my self much more upon my little Interest among them in Case of a War than in View of a Peace and I may come to give you my Reasons for this also in their Place  It is true it pass'd for a Maxim of War in the Time of  Julius Caesar  Never to despise an Enemy but 'tis as good a Maxim tho' not so Antient Not to  Overrate  an Enemy  He that is afraid before he fights will be sure to be beaten  To run down our Estates sink the Value of our Funds Sell out in a Hurry and abate the Publick Credit because of a War and such a War as this too What is it but Fear nay 'tis worse 'tis a Fright and without Despising our Enemy that may be 'tis Rating him much too high As  Spain  is not so Inconsiderable as not to be worth our Preparations so I am sure it is not so Considerable as to be worth our Apprehensions their Power seems but to make the War half a Jest and sure their Threatnings and Swagger ought to be far from turning it into Earnest  I cannot but think there is some Similitude between the  Spaniards  talking of a War and their late Prohibition of our Manufacturers they prepare for War without Money and they prohibit Trade without Clothes  The King of  Spain  they tell us forbids his People to wear any of the Manufactures of Wool or Silk made in other Countries and yet 'tis plain they can make none of their own so that 'tis a kind of a Proclamation for the People to go naked  Let them take away the Manufactures of  England France  and the Seventeen Provinces and tell us if they can what their People must wear the poor  Spaniards  may indeed be careful  notwithstanding the Scripture Prohibition about  wherewithal they shall be clothed  Not the Priests have a Cassock not the Nuns a Veil not the Gentlemen a Cloak or the Ladies a Robe I might have said a Smock but what are made of some foreign Manufacture They have not one Manufacture or Material to make it of in the whole Dominion which we now call  Spain  that can amount to the cloathing of the Inhabitants of one Province nay hardly of one City  They have Wool indeed but by it self 'tis too soft too fine and too tender to work nor will it make any Manufacture of Value unless they could get Wool of a coarser kind to mix with it They have a little Silk but no Quantity They have neither Hemp or Flax In a Word they prohibit the Commerce just as they seem to make War to show their Teeth or rather to show that they have no Teeth As they have no Manufactures to substitute in the room of those they prohibit so they have no Ships to defend the Trade they would exclude us from  Never Nation went to War in the Circumstances which the  Spaniards  must now if they do make a War of it and that makes me think sometimes they are not in earnest that it is all Grimace and a kind of  Quixotisme  For the  Spaniards  take them abstracted from their particular Resentments were always reckoned a wise considering Nation They have made War in former Ages and sometimes with Success as under those truly Great Princes the Emperor  Charles  V and  Philip  II and since that in Confederacy with some or other of the Powers of  Europe  that were in Condition to support them at Sea and we may say there was some Sense in that Part because their Weakness at Sea being supported they in some measure could preserve their  American  Correspondence receive Supplies of Treasure by their Plate Fleets and could have the Support of Troops if wanted either by Land or by Sea as was their Case in their late Wars against  France  and afterwards against the present Emperor when they were supported by  France  In the First the Confederates guarded their Flota's and convoyed their Ships by Sea in the Second the  French  marched powerful Armies to their Assistance by Land and yet in both those Wars  Spain  suffered sometimes prodigious Losses as in the First by the  French  in  America  when Monsieur  Pointy  took  Carthagena  and in the Last by the  English  at  Vigo  and the like  But now they have not an Allie that can help them by Land or by Sea no not one and yet they want to make a War 'Tis answered the Emperor is their Allie and his Armies  are powerful his Troops good his Generals the best of the Age that is to say being interpreted  some of the best  and that he will support them with all his Forces  As to the Imperial Support we shall have room to speak of it when we come to see how well the Emperor will support himself and his own Country but for the present as it relates to  Spain  I may take notice that perhaps the Emperor might support or at least assist the  Spaniards  if he knew how to come at them but which way will that be done and upon what Foundation does the Emperor propose to do it or the  Spaniards  to expect it  By Land it is impracticable unless the Imperial Troops appointed for it could first fight their way from  Italy  or  Alsatia  thro' the Heart of  France  and so enter  Spain  by Land for by Sea they cannot pretend to it the  British  and  Dutch  and perhaps  French  Squadrous lying directly in the Way to intercept them  At present  Spain  is surrounded on every Side by Land waylaid on every Side by Sea they can neither be succoured by Troops from their Friends or supplied with Money from their own Dominions and yet these are the People of whom we must enquire whether we shall have War or Peace and with whom if we have a War our Bubblemakers pretend the Stocks must fall and the publick Funds sink in their Value What Reasons they can give for it I must confess I am at a Loss to find  It is true there are Facts and Events which frequently offer to our View of which we can only say  they are  not why or for what Reason they exist as some  Phoenomena  appear in the Heavens which are strange and unaccountable and of which our best Astronomers can say  they are  rather than give any Account from whence or by what Powers in Nature they exist what their Motions and Revolutions are or how performed such as Comets surprising Meteors Balls of Fire and other Appearances in the Air  There must be some  Aenigma  some  Arcana  in the Councils of that part of the World and they must have some Dependances which we can see no room for and can make no probable Guesses at or else the  Spaniards  seem to be the most void of Council or their Council such as they are the most void of Sense of any People now acting as a Nation and in the Capacity of a Monarchy in the World I know nothing can be more wonderful in the Course of all the Politicks of  Europe  than their present Conduct nor in my Opinion can a greater Prodigy happen in the World unless it should be to see them  come well off at last which I would not Insure under  per  Cent  These things and the abundant Patience of His Majesty and the  British  Government waiting the ntmost Length of Time trying all pacifick Measures and offering beyond what the  Spaniards  have the least Reason to expect in order to prevail with them not to run into a War which they are in no Condition to carry on I say these are the only Reasons that would perswade me to think still that it would not be a War my Meaning is I cannot think the  Spaniards  are so entirely abandon'd so given up to their Piques and personal Resentments so blind against their own Interest and Safety so infatuated and resolved for their own Ruin as to run headlong into a War which in all human Probability must issue in their Loss if not in the utter Destruction of their Interest and perhaps of their very Government of which I shall say more in its order  And is this the War that must sink our Stocks Will any Man Sell out as they call it for the Apprehensions of such a War as this Let the  Bearskin Men  that build upon that Prospect depend upon it that whatever Use they make of the Word  War  which I know is a formidable Word and is of late made as we call it a Term of Art in their way to run down the Price of things and make their Game of among themselves yet upon the whole it will go but a little way and they themselves will buy their own Stock up again in a very few Days after they have Bubbled it out in a Fright without ground  The many frequent Occasions in which those People have been thus taken in their own Snares are not worth our Notice tho' they are very well worth theirs that they may learn to be wiser The Stocks which fall by this Art will never lie there but will ccertainly advance with the greater Reflux as soon as the first Judgment of such a War is pass'd and not to make the  Spaniards  seem meaner and more despicable than they are the little Reason there can be to lay any Stress upon their Part of the War or to raise any Pannicks among us from the Prospect of it the more ashamed these People will be of having sunk the Rate of things upon that Occasion  It seems if this Matter was examined that the Gentlemen who are now so impatient to have this secret Intelligence put much more Weight upon themselves than the World may think fit to put upon them believing that as they please to Rate their Stocks so the rest of the World should Rate the War  War is a terrible Word and were it circumstanced in any manner but as this with  Spain  seems to be there might be something of Foundation for it But Reason dictates that we should distinguish according to the particular People we are to engage with Now if any good Politician will tell us what Nation in the World it could be wish'd we should differ with rather than  Spain  then I'll allow they might suggest a Fall of Stocks upon the Rupture  But where is the Nation of the World that we can get more by and are likely to lose less by in case of a War In how many Places in the World are they exposed even to our Adventurers and LetterofMart Men where they cannot defend themselves against five hundred Men and yet have immense Riches to lose How easie is it not only to insult their  WestIndia  Colonies but even to dispossess them and to take from them the immense Riches of  Mexico  and  Peru  This adds to our Wonder in behalf of the  Spaniards  makes the Infatuation appear the more gross and seems to be still a Reason why we should think there can be no War that is to say that I think the  Spaniards  can never carry on the Jest so far People in their Senses never run great Hazards where they have much to lose and as we know His Majesty has taken all the wise Measures to preserve Peace we cannot suppose the  Spaniards  can come into a War unless they are fallen under some National Infatuation  For a Nation to quarrel that are not able to fight to make a War when they are sure to lose by it and have so much to lose too is a Token of insufferable Stupidity  For this Reason I would close the Account thus  viz No War  unless the  Spaniards  are mad 'tis next to impossible The  Spaniards  can never come into a War without a Blast upon their politick Sense and Understanding and 'tis still more irrational to think that a War with such a Nation can be any Foundation for the running down our Stocks and Funds  c  As to the Advantages of a War with  Spain  and the good Terms on which it might and probably may be carried on by  Great Britain  I shall take that into Consideration by it self when the Wisdom of the  Spaniards  and of their present Conduct may be farther illustrated as it deserves  CHAP II  That Some may be allowed to enquire and should if possible be informed of the Approach of a War before it is begun and that it is just in a Government to give them as much Information as they conveniently can  HAving thus touch'd gently the Grounds and Reasons of our present Impatience about Peace and War and how far some People make a Bubble of the Enquiry as they would do afterwards of the Discovery and of the Thing itself I must add that after all and abstracting the Thing from those jobbing Designs which we must acknowledge are mean and lowpriz'd enough yet there are some People in the World who are justly concern'd to enquire and anxious to know too what will be the Issue of these things and this upon a better Account and who have very honest Reasons for their Enquiries and it is on their Account that these Sheets are made publick    The Merchants abroad  are concerned to make a Judgment of things Many of these being settled in the Ports and Dominions of such Princes and Powers as may be or are like to be Enemies in case of a Rupture 'tis of Importance to them to have as early an Account of things as they can that they may secure their Persons and Effects in time from the Violences frequently made use of on such Occasions and this may be one Reason why our Letters from  Spain  and  Italy  and other Parts of the World are full of importuning Enquiries about it    The Insurers  who are far from being an inconsiderable Body among the Merchants at home have Reason to be concerned in the Enquiry for that being to underwrite Policies which are of very great Value and insure upon Ships and Cargoes going long Voyages 'tis of the last Importance to them to know what Risque they may run in order to know what Premio's to take saited to the Times that are to come  As things may happen many Ships may go out in Peace and come back in War or they may go out in Peace and a War break out before they arrive at the Port they are insured to so that the Insurer knows not what Hazard he runs or how to suit his Demand nor does the Insured know what Premio to give any more than the other knows what to ask  Trade should not be embarrassed with Uncertainties or with unforeseen Hazards The Merchant has in all Ages been much the Care of wise and just Governors they are a useful and valuable Part of the Commonwealth and their Interest should be regarded on all Occasions The Welfare of the Community very much depends upon the Safety of the Merchants and of their Effects By them the People are employed the Navigation encouraged Numbers of Sailors maintained and bred up the Revenue encreased and the great Article of Commerce carried on and continued in this Kingdom  They that venture their Estates and Persons abroad that establish Factories settle Houses and give Commissions for buying and selling in foreign Parts should not be kept in Ignorance and in the Dark 'till the very last Moment of a Rupture The Government will not leave them to the Mercy of the Enemies betray them into the hands of Violence or give them up at least without a due Concern for them and without giving them time to shift for themselves to secure their Effects and to avoid the impending Storm  In like case the  Merchants at home  shipping off daily large Quantities of Goods for foreign Parts it would look particularly unkind to expose them to ingulph themselves and their Fortunes in the publick Resentment if it may be avoided leaving them to push on their Trade in Security under the Protection of Peace while a War is in the very Embrio and as it were just breaking out in which case they would often find themselves on the sudden surprized their Estates confiscated and seized upon and their Factors abroad ruined and undone  It has been usual for Governments to give their Merchants private Hints in such Cases not only not to run farther Hazards not to launch out by continuing to ship off farther and greater Stocks of Goods but to take care in time of the Effects they have already abroad to dispose and secure them that they may not be exposed to the Enemies and when a Government does not do so 'tis reasonable to conclude there is really no Danger    Masters and Owners of Ships  are concerned and may justly be anxious to know whether Peace or War is in the View of the State they live under that they may man and arm their Ships in proportion to the Circumstances of things otherwise if they go out weak and a War breaks out they are made a Prey to Rovers and Privateers if they go out strong and the Peace continues they are at a needless Expence in  hiring more Men than they want and laying in greater Stores than they have Occasion for all which eats into or rather eats out the Profits of the Voyage  The  very Seamen themselves  are justly concern'd in the Enquiry for as in all such Cases the Rate of Seamens Wages bears a Proportion to the Risques they run and to the Dangers they may fall into so 'tis a Wrong to the poor Men to ship themselves at the ordinary Wages if a War is at hand and 'tis a Wrong to Trade to be obliged to pay advanced Wages and consequently Advance of Freight for Goods in view of a War if no War is intended    Tradesmen at home  are concern'd to know whether there is likely to be Peace or War that they may know what and when to buy or sell when to lay in Stocks and Stores of Goods and when not If a War be in View 'tis the Tradesman's Business to store himself with such Goods as are Imported from Abroad before the Price advances before the Hazards of War make them uncertain in their Arriving and as well in Time as in Quantity The  Vintner  lays in a Stock of Wines and buys freely that he may not be forc'd to buy in a Scarcity the  Dyer  lays in a Stock of Cocheneal and Indigo Gauls and Gums that he may work as cheap as before if possible and his Merchants not go from him to another the Country  Clothier  if he hears of a War lays in a Stock of Oil for his Carders and Combers and of  Spanish  Wool for his fine Clothes that if a War happens he may not be out of Goods for the carrying on his Business and be forc'd to buy Dearer than his Neighbours  Again if these Tradesmen buy if they lay in a Stock of Goods with a prospect of War and no War happens if the Seller uses Art to deceive them and perswade them that there will be a War  as is often done  and no War follows I say these Tradesmen are hurt extremely they are clog'd with Goods run out Stocks got deep into Debt and the Rate of their own Goods not at all raised so that they are irreparably weaken'd by the Disappointment and sometimes ruin'd  These things with many of the like justify the Enquiries of the Men of Business especially into the Posture of publick Affairs and whether they are likely to issue in Peace or War and it is in Consideration of these that I enter thus into the Enquiry As for our Friends of the  Jobbing  Business they are a Nation by themselves and we have nothing to do with them in the Case nor are they otherwise worth taking notice of except as before  Since then there are some People to whom it is reasonable we should give as much Light into things as we can Consistent with the Publick Interest let us for their Sakes enquire a little how things stand in the World and what we may reasonably expect as well from the face of things abroad as at home Perhaps they may take some Light from our Enquiries which they would not have before  As things now present themselves to our View there seems to be more rational Guesses to be made and a better Judgment to be form'd from Abroad than from at Home at least as far as we may judge from the Outsides and Appearances of Publick Affairs and as far as we are allow'd to search into them and pass our Judgment upon them  'Tis evident the Councils of  Great Britain  tend to Peace if to be obtain'd with just and honourable Conditions Peace if attended with the good Understanding of Princes and an agreeable Regard to the Treaties and Engagements already entered into and subsisting between the Nations to the Advantage of all Sides and with Support of the Laws Religion and Liberties of  Europe  The Government of  Great Britain  quarrels with no body we desire no War so that our Neighbours are not oppress'd our Commerce invaded new Trades and Correspondencies opened which were formerly by evident and exclusive Stipulations clos'd and shut up  Great Britain  is a Trading Nation and trading Nations never covet War Peace is a Friend of Commerce and Trade flourishes under the Banner of the general Tranquility  But the Government of  Great Britain  nor of its Allies who are generally trading Nations too must not be insulted must not be run down much less their Commerce invaded and supplanted Their Power is always exerted to protect their Trade 'tis their Business to keep the Seas open the Ports open and all the Doors of Commerce open for their Merchants and for their Ships and as I said before if this cannot be done by peaceable and quiet Means they must do it by Force and so they are as ready for War as other People  'Tis for this that these Nations keep up such a Military Force such Fleets and such Armies to protect their Trade to keep all the Backdoors open to clear the Seas of Pyrates and Privateers the SeaPorts from Prohibitions and Reprisals and to keep the SeaPorts of all Nations free and patent for their Ships and for their Merchants and if this be obstructed by Force they must use Force to repel it if this cannot be obtained without a War a War must be expected and to me seems to be unavoidable  Now the Question before us in the present Case is very short Do the combin'd Nations who seem now to oppose the Treaty of  Hanover  seek to invade the Commerce of  Great Britain  or do they not Do they seek to undermine and supplant us or no Do the  Ostend Company  under the Imperial Eagle invade our  EastIndia  Trade or do they not Do they fit our Ships for Parts which by several Treaties and Agreements they are obliged not to do and do not use to fit out Ships for Do they trade to Places whither they ought not even by Agreement to Trade and is this done by Force and with Menaces of a Continuance of such Trade and of resenting the least Opposition to it If this be so then I think no Man of Trade need to enquire whether we shall think fit to renew a War for the Recovery of the Trade seeing the War is begun already by these Aggressions and Invasions  All the Intervals of Peace which we seem to have had were obtained by the Sword The first War between  Holland  and  Spain  which held forty Years was closed by the Peace of  Munster  in which the Rights of Commerce as well as of Government were all adjusted settled and determin'd and have remained so peaceably ever since in most Parts on that side the World If these Rights of Commerce are invaded you need ask no Questions about it the War is begun there Besides this the several Treaties with  Spain  and between  Spain  and  France  have generally adjusted the Commerce as well as the Possession of the several Countries and the settling of Trade has been to these Nations as Essential as the settling of Peace and was always made a Part of it  The Conditions on which the  Netherlands  have been assigned to this or that Prince have been always settled and adjusted by the several Powers with suitable Reserves to Trade such as serv'd for a Guarantee of the Commerce on either Hand By these Treaties such and such Prohibitions have been taken off and laid on by which the Interests of Trade on either of their Boundaries have been preserv'd and taken care of  If the Faith of Treaties is to be preserv'd inviolable in Matters of Peace and War in Matters of Government and Dominion in the Rights of Possession and the Claims of Sovereignty and not in Matters of Trade why are the Affairs of Commerce and the free Intercourse of the Subjects one with another mention'd in these Treaties Why are the Liberties and Restrictions of Trade stipulated among other things in those Treaties They are not Articles made on purpose to be  broken there is no Reserve made against them no Exception 'tis no where said that the Breach of those Clauses shall not be taken for a Breach of the Peace  On the contrary those Articles of Commerce have all along been looked upon as Essential to the good Understanding between those reconciled Nations as any of the rest and the Breach of them is generally one of the first things complained of  Upon this Foot then I take the Liberty to say the War is begun already for the Enemy have invaded us and refused to put a stop to their Invasions I am told that the  Spaniards  and the  Muscovites  both complain of the  British  Nation's being Aggressors and that blocking up their Fleets whether for War or Trade is an actual Invasion that lying before their Ports is an act of Hostility and that in a word the War is begun on this Side  I am not to enter into a Justification of what they say but I ballance it with this Invasion of the Commerce is as much an act of Hostility strictly as Invasion of the Land the Liberties and exclusive Rights of Trade being as much a Part of the Peace as a Cessation of Hostilities and if our Trade be invaded contrary to express Stipulations the Peace is broken As for our Squadrons appearing ready to keep the Peace where apparent Preparations are made to break it it may be complain'd of and they do make some Noise about it but I cannot see how they can make that Part be called an Act of Hostility  If the  British  Squadron lay off of  Revel  or any where else on the  Russian  Coast demanding an Answer to the Enquiries made concerning their Preparations for War and that they would explain themselves upon the Subject of their fitting out a Fleet in time of profound Peace it is no more than what has been usual in all Ages when Princes and Powers make Preparations of War while their Neighbours are all at Peace with them For Example  When the  Dutch  in a time of profound Peace fitted out a Fleet of sixty Men of War for the Expedition of the then Prince of  Orange  into  England  the King of  France  ordered his Minister at the  Hague  to ask the Meaning of it and to threaten the  States  that if it was meant against the King of  England  he the King of  France  should take it as a Declaration of War against himself  Now if it be objected that this was done by an Ambassador not by a Fleet 'tis answer'd The  French  King indeed had not a Fleet at that time but he threatned them directly with  an immediate War which was the same thing and as soon as it appeared that the Design was against the King of  England  he drew his Armies down to the Frontiers of  Holland  and hovered about them the same thing as blocking up a Port and at last took the Field publickly and began an open War  I might give a great many more Examples of the like but this is sufficient The Preparations for War made by the Court of  Petersburg  their fitting out a Fleet and drawing down an Army to the Coast gave sufficient Reason to their Neighbours to ask the Meaning of it And to what Purpose was an Enquiry at such a Distance without a Force sufficient to act as Occasion should require and as the Answer that was to be receiv'd should direct  Had the Answer been Satisfactory 'tis probable the  British  Squadron had return'd sooner but as the Answer was not so Satisfactory the Fleet continued there waiting the Event and where's the act of Hostility in all this I see nothing but what is usual in the ordinary Practice of Princes much more was it necessary at this time on many Accounts too long to enter upon here  Nor is the Resentment which we hear of on the other Side the least Discovery of the good Effect of those Measures No doubt it was a Disappointment to the great Designs of the  Muscovite  Empress put a stop to the Enterprizes just ripe to be begun and has shut up all the secret Resolves of the  Russian  Cabinet so that we know nothing of the Scheme they had laid other than we are left to guess at by the Nature of the thing and by the Apprehensions and Jealousies which those Preparations raised in the Councils of their Neighbours Some of which had certainly before now been engaged in a War with the Empress of  Muscovy  or at least with the Duke of  Holstein  in whose Behalf all these Preparations seem to have been made  As to the  British  Squadron in the  WestIndies  who block up the  Spanish  PlateFleet at  Porto Bello  and which the Enemy complain of as an act of Hostility and upon which they pretend the War is begun on this Side the same Argument and the same Example fully answer it The blocking up the  Muscovite  Fleet with which it was aparent they designed to begin a War and blocking up the  Spaniard  's Money without which we know they are but ill able to begin much less to carry on a War seem to me to be the very same thing and that with no Difference at all except only the Variation of the Circumstance and calling the PlateFleet an Army  an Alliance and a Confederacy of Armies drawing together for a War all which they indeed are in Effect for Money appropriated for War is War in Embrio 'tis all that Fleets and Armies are or may be supposed to be in Design and it would soon show it self had the  Spaniards  those Sinews to strengthen their Councils with and to pursue the Measures which they have visibly engaged in  So that in all these things 'tis evident  Great Britain  has only acted by way of Prevention and has hitherto only held the Hands of the quarrelling Powers and said to them  'Ye shall not fall out if ye will make Peace be quiet and accommodate things reasonably well and good but quarrel you shall not and fight you shall not'  If this has been spoken something Magisterially and with an Air of Influence as if we had Power to command them to be quiet I say If it has I do not say it has 'tis our Felicity 'tis  Great Britain  's Glory that she is in a Condition to enforce her Proposals tho' of Peace with a hand of Power seeing still that Power is exerted but for the Good of Mankind and to keep the World quiet 'tis a kind of Imitation of Heaven who tho' its Pleasure is enforc'd as a Command yet it is so for the apparent Good of the World that they can find it no Grievance to obey  But our Enemies they say take this for an Act of Hostility that the War is begun by us and so conclude that they will carry it on as a War in other Places adding that we may depend it must be a War unless the Restraint upon their PlateFleet be taken off if so then the Question is answer'd for we see no room to believe the Restraint will be yet taken off nay I must grant that we can see no reason for it  This being the true State of the Case I think the People who I say should be inform'd need not wait for any further Information but may without any Breach of Prudence act as if a War was in View I will not say Inevitable because many things may intervene but Probable and that so probable that if they are deceived and run any Hazards on the contrary Presumption it must be their own Fault  CHAP III  Of the Parties who in Case of a War are like to form the several Interests and in particular the  Hanover  and  Vienna  Alliances  THE Probability of a Rupture somewhere or other being thus settled it will be very agreeable to the Age if we could determine where it is likely to happen and this is our next Work In order to which I shall endeavour to make some Judgment upon the foot of the common Observation only for I pretend to no Cabinet Informations  The truest way to state the Case is to cast up the Account of Strength on both Sides or in the Terms of our Vulgar  English See who and who's together  The Heads of the Parties seem to be collected under the ordinary Acceptation of the  Hanover  and the  Vienna  Treaties  On the Side of the  Hanover Treaty  I suppose the following Powers either actually or publickly engaged or expected to be so as for those who are still intriguing on either Side we shall let them alone 'till we hear farther  Declar'd  Great Britain  France  The  States  The Kings of  Denmark  Sweden  and  Sardinia  Expected and even depended upon as certain  The Government of  Hanover  and  Lunenburgh  c certain  The King of  Prussia  not certainly known  Neuter  Portugal  Lorrain  Venice  Genoa  Tuscany  On the Side of the  Vienna  Treaty  Declar'd  The  Emperor  The King of  Spain  Declar'd  The  Czarina  The King of  Poland  Expected and I suppose depended upon as above  The Electors of  Saxony  Bavaria  Palatinate  Cologn  Mentz  Tryers  Expected and as is reported actually come in  Expected  Duke of  Parma  Duke of  Modena  The King of  Prussia  as above not certainly known  Having thus stated the Powers it would be natural to examine a little the Occasion of the supposed Differences and which in case of a War may in some sense be called the Quarrel  As to any Private or Personal Piques and Resentment which may add to the Grounds of the Quarrel and may give Jealousies on either hand among the Princes concern'd tho' I might take notice of several almost among them all such as the sending home the  Infanta  of  Spain  espousing King  Stanislaus  the Affair of  Thorn  the espousing the Duke of  Holstein  the Succession of  Tuscany  with several others nearer Home which I could enter into the Debate of I purposely omit them here being as is said before resolved to give no Offence and as I am speaking without Doors I shall confine my self to such Things as Present to common Observation only  The secret and at that time surprizing Alliance clapt up on a sudden between the Courts of  Vienna  and of  Spain  and which is therefore call'd  the Treaty of Vienna  was the first thing that gave Umbrage to the Protestant Powers of  Europe  Particularly they seem'd to be alarm'd at some secret Articles which were not at first made Publick or communicated to them when the rest of the Treaty was notified by the Ministers of the Parties concern'd  Upon the publishing this Treaty and the said Powers of  Spain  and  Vienna  appearing busily employ'd to engage other Powers to come into it as an Alliance or Confederacy his  Britanick  Majesty being then in  Germany  thought it time also to  draw together the several Powers in other Interests to form an opposite League or Alliance which Alliance is said to be wholly Defensive and therefore entirely Pacific being form'd merely in order to balance the said Treaty of  Vienna  and this is called the Treaty of  Hanover  into which the Neighbouring Powers mention'd above were invited to join also  The first and most pointing Clause which appeared in this newconcerted Alliance or Treaty of  Vienna  and which gave Umbrage to the said opposite Powers was a conceded Liberty of Commerce granted by  Spain  to the Subjects of the Emperor to carry on a Trade to the  East  and  WestIndies  not only injurious to the several Nations of  Great Britain France  and the  StatesGeneral  but directly contrary to and inconsistent with several solemn Treaties and Conventions actually subsisting between those several Powers and on the Conditions of which the Emperor enjoys the Possession of the Country in which this Liberty of Commerce is made use of  This the Members of the said  Hanover  Alliance insist is an Invasion of their Rights and a manifest Breach of the said subsisting Treaties and Conventions and have not been wanting in all possible tho' yet peaceable Applications at the Court of  Vienna  in order to convince his Imperial Majesty that the said Commerce and particularly the  Ostend  Company erected and carried on in consequence of that conceded Liberty is a Breach of the Publick Faith engaged in those Treaties and an Invasion of the Rights and Properties of the said Powers and representing that they could not on any Terms consent to its being carried on  These Applications have been hitherto in vain or at least unsuccessful both the Courts of  Vienna  and  Spain  refusing to yield to the just Demands of the  Hanover  Allies they at the same time seeming rather to resent than comply with those Demands and to arm and draw together their Interests strengthning themselves by farther and farther Alliances and carrying on already a kind of War of Negotiation in order to appear formidable and to be really so in case of a Rupture menacing the Allies with their intended Attacks of some of the said  Hanover  Allies in  Flanders  in  Germany  or in the  Baltick  These things have justly moved the said  Hanover  Allies to Arm also both by Sea and Land and not only by powerful Fleets to appear at the several Ports where such Powers have been drawing together to carry on their Designs but have by the Awe of those Fleets kept the said Powers from  making any Attempt and from breaking the Peace by the Invasion of their Neighbours as they most certainly designed to do  On the other Hand a Squadron has been sent to the Coasts of  America  as well to bring off the Ships which are in the Faith of former Treaties Trading within the Dominions and in the Ports of  Spain  as to put a Stop for the present to the  Spanish  PlateFleet coming away And all in pursuit of the same Pacifick Measures that  Spain  seeing how impracticable it is for them to carry on that Important Commerce without a good Understanding with the more powerful Nations of  Great Britain France  and  Holland  may be prevail'd with if possible to continue their Peaceable Dispositions and preserve the General Tranquility of  Europe  How far these Steps which have been visibly taken to prevent a War not to Excite it have been Successful and how they are resented by the several Powers whose Designs are probably cross'd and defeated by them and whether those Powers being convinc'd of the Necessity of Hearkning to peaceable Proposals are likely to comply or whether pretending to be Insulted and Injured by those Measures they breathe out Resentment Revenge and War this is what lies before us to Enquire  And here as I profess to be speaking as  without Doors  only I must content my self to ground all the Reasonings and Inferences which I shall make use of in this Discourse from the publick received Reports of Things at least such as are Confirmed by repeated Advices are generally received for Truth and have not as yet been Contradicted or Disputed without pretending or indeed having any Occasion to pretend to Secret Intelligence Private Information or knowing any thing which should not be known  Nor in the Case before me is there any Occasion for enquiring into Secrets or looking farther than to what appears For to do Justice to the  Hanover Allies  they seem to be above all Disguises in the Case They are Acting above Board and the World is left to judge of the Reason and Justice of their Proceedings The Matter is Short and Open They desire Peace that is evident by the Measures they have already taken to preserve it They are content with every thing standing upon the ancient Foot They demand that the subsisting Treaties and Conventions be duly Executed and upon this they Insist If it be quietly comply'd with Peace is the Consequence If not  Pax Quaeritur Bello  And this is the Reason why as I said before this is not the Place for the Impatient People to have their Question answered If they ask us here Whether Peace or War We Answer with the Story in the Gospel The Emperor is of Age  Ask him  The King of  Spain  is of Age  Go and Ask him  They are to decide the Case for the Offer of Peace is to them And as they may accept it if they please they are the only People that can tell whether they will accept it  'till they are Box'd into it  or no  Not that this is like to be long the Case neither nor is it reasonable it should be so for if they stand out too long if they reject the Peace while it is a Peace subsisting and suffer or leave Things to come on to Extremities when once that Peace is broken and they have pull'd the House down upon their Heads they must get out of the Rubbish as they can The Allies are not oblig'd to give them the same Terms at last or to stand always Tendering and Offering the Peace when they may have been put to Five or Ten Millions  Sterling  Expence to beat them to it  But of this in its Place  I return to the Point in Hand  viz The Present Face of Things  as they appear to be and as by the uncontroverted Accounts from all Parts we believe them to be  The  British  Squadron under Sir  Charles Wager  have been in the  Baltick  they have pass'd by  Denmark  shewn themselves to  Sweden  and as it may be call'd have block'd up  Revel  and  Petersburgh  'till the Season for Action being over the  Muscovites  can do nothing on that Side  By this Aggression all the mighty Designs of the  Czarina  Empress of  Muscovy  which as Fame says were very Considerable and would have broken the Peace of Christendom have been Interrupted and Disappointed Her embarking an Army in Aid of the Duke of  Holstein  to recover his Dominions from the  Danes  Her sending or as some say Selling a Squadron of Men of War to the  Spaniards  to strengthen their Naval Power And her other Nameless Designs whatever they were have been all render'd Abortive Her Majesty's Navy however Formidable or talk'd up as if they were so have been Aw'd kept in Port and been able to do nothing no not so much as to go home again to  Cronslot  'till the  English  Fleet thought fit to come away the Season for Action as above being over All this we allow to be true in Fact and the Consequences have appeared as visible as the Thing it self For Peace in all those Parts of the World where the War was likely first to break  out has been Preserv'd the  Danes  are secur'd in the Interest of the  Hanover Treaty  and the  Swedes  brought off from the other Side when it was suppos'd they were just upon the Point of Engaging in the Treaty of  Vienna  or in an Alliance with the Emperor little better than the other  How the  Muscovites  will proceed in Consequence of this Transaction whether the  Czarina  made sensible how utterly uncapable she is to carry on any of her vast Design for disturbing the Peace of  Europe  will comply and come into the Pacifick Offers of the  Hanover Allies  Or whether her Majesty full of Resentment and Anger at being thus overpowered will struggle however vain to pursue her first Designs that remains to be discovered by Time And there as I said our impatient Enquirers must go with their Question about  Peace  or  War  Her  Czarian  Majesty  is of Age ask Her  I cannot but put one Speculation here into the Hands of our Politicians upon this Subject of the  Muscovite  Fleet and let them consider of it The late  Czar  had rais'd his Naval Power considering its Beginning and the few Years it has been in Being to a kind of a Prodigy  A  Muscovite  Fleet a Thing the World never heard of before seemed to appear in the  Baltick  like a Comet in the waste or Starry Spaces or like the new Star in  Cassiopeia  's Chair for all the World to wonder at That such a Thing was never heard of before is most certain The whole  Moscovite  Empire never were Masters of one Ship of War before no nor notwithstanding the vast Extent of their Dominions had the  Czar  or any of his Ancestors ever one Ship they could call their own in any Part of the World that I have ever heard or read of except at  ArchAngel  It was but in the late King  William  's Time that the  Czar  himself turn'd ShipCarpenter and work'd Journeywork for the  StatesGeneral  Having in Disguise so History assures us Enter'd himself in some of the Building Yards in that Country Work'd hard Earn'd his Pay and Receiv'd his Wages  There he bought the first Ship he ever had and now they talk of a Royal Navy Ships of to Guns and of bringing out Men of War of the Line In a Word neither the  Swede  or  Dane  are able to look them in the Face Nay 'tis doubted whether both together wou'd venture it if the  English  and  Dutch  were to stand and look on  And yet all this while which is the Thing I mention it for it is not yet tryed to this Day whether notwithstanding  all their Ships they dare Fight or no Nor do I find or can learn that whether Separately or Together they ever yet Fir'd one Broadside in Earnest since they had a Ship  That they were at first well Mann'd when the Ships were but few is very certain and they had Seamen of all Nations in their Pay Their Ships were Commanded by  Dutch  and  Scots  and  English  and most of their Officers were such also But now the Number of their Ships is increas'd and they have Seamen of their own such as they are But how they will behave or whether they have either Skill or Courage to Fight none yet knows And the World cannot but be a little Curious to know how it would be It is indeed my Opinion they would make but very sorry Work of it But 'tis strange that no Accident should happen in all this Time to give them an Occasion to show whether they can Fight or not and what may be expected of them Time alone must give us the Experiment and make the Discovery But this is a Digression  Another  British  Squadron under Admiral  Hosier  being dispatch'd in the very Critical Juncture of the  Spaniards  expecting their Galeons has been sent to the Gulph of  Mexico  and shewing themselves on the Side of  Cuba  and near the  Havana  stood over to the  Isthmus  of  America  and to  Porto Belo  Posting themselves at the Islands call'd the  Bastimento's  a Road which commands the Entrance into  Porto Belo  Here the Galeons were Unloading and here they were to take in Twentysix Millions of Pieces of Eight in Specie besides other Goods The said Galeons are still block'd up in that Port and cannot put to Sea to the inexpressible Mortification and Disappointment of the  Spaniards  who for want of that Treasure are in no Condition in  Old Spain  to carry on their secret Designs pay their promis'd Subsidies to the Emperor and in short kindle the Flame of War in  Europe May they be still so disabled  At the same Time a Third Squadron said to be intended to the  Mediterranean  Sea has been kept Cruising and Plying off and on upon the Coast of  Spain  and is now at  Gibraltar  ready to Intercept if it comes in their way the other Plate Fleet or the other Part of the Plate Fleet which coming from  La Vera Cruz  with Fifteen Millions of Silver more is arriv'd at the  Havana  But having Intelligence as we suppose from  Europe  have landed that Treasure there and laid by the Ships not thinking fit to venture any farther By both which Incidents the  Spaniards  are depriv'd of the Return of Forty Millions of Pieces of Eight in Bullion and  about Five or Six Millions in Merchandise And thus stand Affairs on the Side of the  Hanover Treaty  Let us now look a little on the other Side And how does the  Vienna Treaty  or Party proceed How do they take all these Disappointments And what are they like to do as to Peace or War upon the Resentment  In their Endeavours to strengthen themselves by other and farther Alliances they have not been Idle that must be granted they have not been wanting to themselves If we may believe what their own People acknowledge they have left no Stone unturn'd to draw off if possible the Court of  France  from the  Hanover Treaty  and to prevent the King of  Sardinia  joyning in with it but have miscarry'd in both The First of these seems to be the greatest and most essential Disappointment of all the rest and which abundantly shows how Impracticable it is to bring the Interests of  France  and the Empire or of  France  and  Spain  to Unite together No notwithstanding a Prince of the House of  Bourbon  enjoys the Crown of  Spain  uninterrupted and in full Peace  But that by the way  This Attempt as it was of the utmost Importance to the Imperial Court so I suppose I may obtain your Belief when I say the Popish Clergy have not been wanting to use their utmost Interest at the Court of  France  in favour of it and if possible to bring the Councils of  France  to favour the Happy Juncture as they call it of bringing about a Religious War and for bringing the two Treaties of  Hanover  and  Vienna  to be entirely a  Protestant  Alliance and a  Popish  that so the Article of Religion might have been brought in as the chief Matter to be Fought for  But they have not been able to do it tho' a Churchman fits at the Head of Affairs in  France  and a Cardinal is their Prime Minister So true is the modern Proverb in  France  That  All the  French  Fools are dead  So apparent is it that tho' the  French  are as a People not only  Papists  but have been Persecutors yet as a Government they are no Slaves to the Church  That the King of  Sardinia  is as good as lost to them also appears by the  Imperialists  Arming in the  Milanese  Fortifying  Novara  and ordering Men to be drawn together upon the first Notice which as they write from thence will advance as soon as they have a certain Account of the King's having Signed the Treaty of  Hanover  It might have been of Use here to take Notice How much it would be to the Advantage of the  Vienna Alliance  if they had been able to have drawn off the King of  Sardinia  But this is a Subject too tedious for this Tract I hear however that the Court of  Vienna  exclaim loudly at the great Ingratitude as they call it of that King who  they say  owes his Crown and particularly the Deliverance of his Capital City of  Turin  to the  Imperialists  that These travers'd the whole Breadth of  Italy  in that Glorious March of the Imperial Army to raise the Siege and gave the  French  the greatest Overthrow they ever receiv'd in all the War except  Blenheim  only and all to save Him from Imminent Destruction which had been otherwise Unavoidable But I shall reserve that Part to an Article by it self when I may have Occasion to speak of the Gratitude of Princes for Favours receiv'd and of  Imperial Gratitude  among the rest  Nor shall I enter here into the Measures taken by the Court of  Vienna  to bring off if possible a certain Powerful  Protestant  Prince from the Alliance of  Hanover  in which 'tis nois'd that they have had at least some Prospect of Success But this Part being not yet so publick or so perfectly known nor the Particulars of their Success whatever it is so Visible either in Fact or in Consequence as it is probable they may soon be I refer it to Time  That the  Imperialists  have engaged the Electors of  Bavaria  and  Cologn  and the Elector  Palatine  and are not in doubt of  Saxony  may for ought we yet see be true And the Alliance of those Princes especially of Two of them are not Inconsiderable But 'tis as certain that the Motions even of the best of those Princes if not of all the rest depend so much upon  Spanish  Money which seems at present very remote that the Success of those Things seems very Doubtful upon that Account And even the Emperor however Powerful may find it difficult to Act in a vigorous Manner for want of those Sinews of War which they expected from  Spain  Were all these Things duly Weigh'd and fairly and impartially Judg'd of common Reasoning would seem to tell us there could be  no War  in View that the  Imperial  and  Spanish  Councils could not be so Weak so Infatuated and so Blind to their true Interest as to run themselves into a War so surrounded with Difficulties and against Enemies so perfecty well Furnish'd with every Thing that these want so full of what they are so empty of and so ready for Action tho' so willing to have Peace  But What will not Pride and Passion drive Men to And how Deaf are even the Wisest Princes and States to the Importunities  of their own Circumstances when their Ambition and their particular Passions hurry them on  Under all the Pressures which 'tis apparent the Principal Branches of the  Vienna  Alliance are embarrass'd with and notwithstanding all the Difficulties they struggle with yet we see them Haughty Menacing the other Allies raising Forces Filling up their Regiments Storing Magazines Drawing Troops to the Frontiers and in a Word as it is usually express'd Talking of nothing but War  Their Generals are Named for the Command of their Armies in several Places where they are to Act as in  Flanders Italy  and as some say at  Gibraltar  The Emperor demands a new Levy of Men say some Accounts say others of the States of the Lower  Austria  and mentions the Occasion of it namely to Oppose the Designs of those that would disturb the Peace of his Dominions that is to say to maintain the  Ostend  Trade and the Alliance with  Spain  And thus stands the Case on the  Imperial  Part of the  Vienna Alliance  We shall see more of it presently  CHAP IV  Of the Adverse Powers falling upon the  British  Commerce That Invading our Trade is Invading our Property breaking the Peace And so the War may be properly said to be begun A Word or two how Weak and Foolish the Attempts this way are and how easy it is to Disappoint them  THE Politicks of the Powers mentioned above in Forming their Interests and Alliances have been mention'd and in that Part they may be said to Act with some Council If they had acted with the same Prudence in some other Parts of their Measures I am of Opinion we should indeed have had no Quarrel at all that is to say they would have given the Allies no Occasion of a War no notwithstanding their New  Vienna Treaty  But that which more particularly calls for our Attention in the Conduct of these Powers is their falling upon Trade and the  British  Commerce in particular And this tho' they  are able to do but little in it to any Purpose or at least have done but little in it yet I say this shows the reigning Disposition among them to insult injure and affront his Majesty and his Allies and wound their Interest in every Place where it is Valuable so if possible to retaliate what they call our Interrupting their Commerce at  Porto Belo  In Prosecution of this weak Project which seems indeed as foolish as it is forward they have mutually made some little Essays I shall mention the Facts first and then the Views of the Contrivers their Expectations from them and the Meaning of them so far as they may be allowed to have any Meaning which I think indeed will appear very Empty and Weak and unlikely to Succeed or answer their End  The first Step was made by the Emperor in Prohibiting the Sale of the  English  Manufactures at the Fair of  Messina  As to the generous Part of this Piece of Management it had indeed something very Extraordinary in it particularly that the Emperor that very Emperor for whose Service and Assistance his Majesty sent an  English  Squadron to drive away the  Spaniards  and to keep the Sea clear for his recovering the same City of  Messina  and that whole Island which  English  Squadron continuing in that Part of the World so long and at so great an Expence of the  British  Treasure made way for the Conquest of  Sicily  and without which the  Spaniards  would never have been Beaten out of it I say that the same Emperor should be the first of all the Princes of  Sicily  that should prohibit the  English  Commerce there and fall upon the Trade and Interest of his Benefactors  Nor could there be any Pretence of the Subjects Benefit in this Prohibition No  Sicilian  or  Italian  Manufacture had been substituted in the Room of the  English  or which the  English  could be said to be Injurious to Nor was any such Reason given or pretended to be given for it that I have yet met with or any Other only That such was his Imperial Majesty's Pleasure  On the contrary even the Subjects themselves Remonstrated against it as I have been Informed as prejudicial to their own Commerce  The farther Prohibition of the  English  Manufactures in the Imperial Hereditary Countries and Proclaimed by Sound of Trumpet at  Lintz  and  Vienna  tho' it has the specious Pretence of being done in Favour of their own Manufactures and at the Request of a Company Established by the Emperor for carrying on the Woollen Manufacture there yet it manifestly  pointed at the Commerce of  England  in general several Manufactures being mentioned in the same Prohibition which their own Company do not pretend to make or to make any other that can serve in their stead as appears by the Remonstrances of the Merchants and Tradesmen of the neighbouring Provinces in his Imperial Majesty's Dominion made publick with the other  But to leave these things which as I said are as weak and impotent as they appear to be piquant and as I might say malicious we come next to the King of  Spain  's Grant of a Trade to the Emperor's Subjects to the  East  and  WestIndies  a Trade which the  Spaniards  have 'till now been so jealous of that they have with great Strictness excluded all other Nations from it But now as an Introduction to this Trade they have set up an  EastIndia  Company at  Ostend  who have already carried on a Trade to  India  and even to  China  to the manifest Prejudice of the Allies and this in a Country conquered for the Emperor by the Arms of those very Nations which are now injured by it and which Trade is expresly contrary to and inconsistent with all the Treaties and Conventions upon the foot of which the Emperor enjoys the Dominion of those Countries and of the very Port of  Ostend  it self  Will any Man ask after this whether these Powers acting thus intend a War Invading our Commerce is invading our Property especially where the exclusive Right to that Commerce is expresly stipulated and invading a Nation's Property is a War begun As Treaties of Peace commence an Amity and Accord between Nations who were before at War so avowed Breaches of those Treaties put an end to that Amity and  ipso facto  commence a War  It is true in most Treaties of Peace and where a continued Amity is designed there is usually a Clause mentioning that if any casual Contravention of those Articles shall happen on either side on Complaint made Commissioners on both Sides shall meet to settle and adjust the Grievances and Satisfaction shall be made so that such Contravention shall not be deemed as a Breach of the Peace or any Reprisals be used unless the said Satisfaction be first deny'd  But have not frequent Representations Memorials and Complaints been made at the Courts of  Vienna  and  Madrid  against this open Infraction of a Treaty without being able to obtain any Redress but on the contrary several haughty Expressions been heard of as if the Emperor was at Liberty to invade any Part of the Commerce of his Neighbours and to break in upon the most solemn Treaties and  Conventions in what Manner and at what Time he pleases and as may be said take the Bread out of the Mouths not of private Persons only but even of Nations and incorporated Societies of Trade at whatever Expence and Hazard those Societies and Companies have been established  This Method seems to leave the Allies no other Remedy but that of Force Trading Nations are obliged to defend their Commerce If others pretend to interrupt it these think themselves engaged to enquire into those Interruptions and remove them If the Doors of our Commerce are shut we must open them if it is done by rigorous Usage of our Merchants new Impositions or Prohibitions the Government always has thought fit to espouse the Merchants preserve them from injurious Treatment and to concern themselves to obtain Right to be done and have as we may say made the Case of their Merchants their own  We had an Example of this lately in the present Reign when an  English  Merchant at  Lisbon  betrayed by his Agents and Servants there was seiz'd upon and his Goods confiscated or ordered to be so for a particular Affair of Exporting Money and tho' the Offence was indeed strictly speaking Capital by their Laws yet as many of the Effects of Merchants here in  England  who were innocent of the Fact were stopt among the rest and the Person there was a Man of Worth and Consideration and of a good Character and especially as it seemed to affect the whole Commerce His Majesty was pleased to interpose and procure the Enlargement of the Merchant and the discharging of the Effects And the King of  Portugal  listen'd to the powerful Intercession of the King and passed over the thing notwithstanding as I have said it was a real Offence  Much more in other Cases when the whole Commerce is struck at Trade loaded with new Burthens new Impositions and Difference made between the Subjects of one Nation and the Subjects of another The Governments whose Subjects are so distinguished in those Oppressions have always thought themselves concerned in the Invasions of their Trade and have espoused the Interests of their Merchants and of the Trade as a publick Concern  It is alledged in this Case that every Prince or Government has a Right to govern their own Commerce and make such Prohibitions or lay such Duties and Imposts upon their Importations as they think fit because such Prohibitions chiefly regard the Use and Wearing of such or such Goods by their own People and it is always the Right of any Government  to limit the Usages Habits Customs and Apparel of their own Subjects  The Answer to this is short and direct It is so where no former Stipulations Treaties and Conventions are made to the contrary but that Right is limited and ceases when the said Nation so loading the Commerce of any other Country have by Treaty oblig'd themselves expresly not to do it Then I say and in case of such Treaties the Case alters and their Hands are tied up and to do it afterward is an Infraction of the Treaty and a Breach of the Friendship and good Correspondence established between the two Nations  This was exactly the Case in the late Disputes which happen'd here about opening the Trade to  France  It was urged that it could not be that  England  could not take off the high Duties upon the Importation of Wines in particular from  France  unless a Proportion of the Duties upon the Wines of  Portugal  were also taken off so as that the Duty upon the  Portugal  Wines should be still so much less than the Duties on the Wines of  France  The Reason of this was because  England  was under Express Conditions to the contrary in the Treaty of Peace and Commerce then subsisting with  Portugal  and the Articles of the said Treaty of  Portugal  were produced wherein it was expresly stipulated as above that the Duties on  French  Wine should always be so and so limited and this being found to be true in fact was admitted as a sufficient Reason why the Commerce of  France  could not be opened as was proposed  All Breaches of Treaties are Breaches of Friendship whether they relate to the Peace or Commerce of the Nations and the Breach of Friendship between Nations is a kind of declaring War in many Respects and nothing but meer Force and Invasion can be a more manifest Breach of Friendship than stopping the Intercourse and Correspondence of the Merchants  Nor is this one of the least or less important Articles in most Treaties  viz  That there shall be a free Intercourse of Trade and Correspondence between the Subjects of either Nation as may be seen in almost all the Treaties of Peace which have been made among the Nations of  Europe  and it will be found so in a particular and extraordinary manner in all the Treaties made and now subsisting between  GreatBritain  and  Spain  and this Particular will be found in those Treaties which is modern and singular namely That the Subjects of  Britain  shall be used in all the Affairs relating to Commerce upon the same foot as the Nations which are most  favoured Which Article was inserted in regard to some Apprehensions that the  French  should be more especially and particularly favoured in the Affairs of Trade than the  English  and that they should be distinguished with a Partiality singular and to the Prejudice of the  British  Commerce  In case this Partiality should be afterward put in Practice in case this Correspondence Intercourse and Commerce be interrupted by the Governour of that Country with whom such a free Intercourse was stipulated and Prohibitions of the Trade set up the Peace is so far broken Suppose for Example the Importation of the  British  Manufactures in  Spain  is forbid and the Use or Wearing them prohibited which is the severest way of interrupting the Commerce is not this equally a Breach of the good Understanding and Commerce of the two Nations Is it not a Breach of the Friendship and free Intercourse between them and what is this less than a kind of declaring War  It was the Observation of a wise Man that the Peace and Friendship of two trading Nations seldom nay he said Never continued long where Commerce remained contraband 'Tis like two Men pretending to Friendship yet never speaking to or saluting or taking notice of one another upon any Occasion How long will that continue How long will such Friendship subsist  Our Interest is our Trade and our Trade is next to our Liberty and Religion one of our most valuable Liberties if our Neighbours pretend to shut the Door against our Commerce we must open it and that by Force if no other Means will procure it To invade our Commerce is to invade our Property and we may and must defend it and therefore I say to invade our Trade is to begin a War and will any Man then ask me whether we shall have  War  or  Peace  The Answer is Categorical if they please to leave our Commerce free and uninterrupted as they found it lay down their interloping Companies by which they have begun to invade it cease their Infractions of the solemn Treaties and leave our Commerce open then with some other Concessions all will be well and I believe we shall have no  War  On the other hand Do all those things go on shall they support their interloping  Ostend  Company forbid their Subjects wearing and using our Manufacture and interrupt our Commerce As  Jehu  said to the King of  Israel  when he met him and asked  Is it Peace Jehu  he replied  What Peace while the Whoredoms of thy Mother Jezabel and her Witchcrafts are so many  So I say What Peace when the Encroachments  on our Trade the Interruptions and Invasions of our Commerce are so many What Peace while the Leagues and private Confederacies are so many Leagues that are so apparently destructive of Peace and good Neighbourhood Leagues that threaten War and are an open consolidating of Interests in case of War Leagues that support Popery and Persecution and suppressing and murthering Protestant Subjects under Guarantee of Protestant Powers and Princes Leagues that are in their own Nature tacit Declarations of a warlike Intention What Peace can there be while this is the Case  We have seen frequent Examples upon many nay almost upon all such Occasions that when any Princes raise Forts or fortify Towns upon their Frontiers or refortify Towns which have been demolished by Treaties and Confederacies that such fortifying of Frontiers is taken for an Intimation of War or at least for a Testimony of unpeaceable and dangerous Designs and the neighbouring Princes generally take Umbrage at such things send Agents and Messages to enquire into the Reason of them declare their Dissatisfaction and threaten to use Force to put a stop to those Preparations Fortifications and repairing of demolished Places  If the Princes and Powers by whom those Fortifications are made do not give a peaceable and satisfactory Answer assign proper Reasons for what they do and give Assurances that they have no Design injurious to their Neighbours the Complainers they frequently draw together their Forces and appear resolved to oblige them by their Power to give over or demolish again the Works they had begun  Examples of this are many and recent in Memory as the Fortifications which the King of  Denmark  raised at  Husum  at  Heusden  and other Places on the Frontiers of  Holstein  which caused the  Swedes  and Princes of  Lunenburgh  to arm against him after in vain having desired his  Danish  Majesty to cease his Works and leave the Country open and this caused an Army of those Powers to assemble and march to the Frontiers in order to effect it by Force no other Method proving effectual upon which ensued the Treaty of  Trav  al  where the King of  Denmark  yielded and the F  immediately demolished  but more universally known and remembred w  the  French  attempting to fortify  Mardike  after the  hing of  Dunkirk  and to build a Port or Haven with P  s and Sluices there as before at  Dunkirk  It was certainly just and no Nation had any thing to do with it that the  French  might and ought to be at Liberty to build Piers and make Harbours Docks and other things for the Assistance of their Commerce and Navigation in any Part of their Dominions as much as the King of  England  has a Right to do it at  Dover  or the  Dutch  at  Sluys  But if his Majesty had stipulated by a solemn Treaty not to do it I cannot say it would be equally rightful or just to do it then So the  French  having positively engaged not to raise any Fortifications at  Dunkirk  or to restore that Harbour there or on any Part of the Coast near it as was the Case in the Treaty of  Utrecht  that Right to do it ceased and was anticipated and taken away by the Treaty for what any Prince or Power have bound themselves not to do they may be said to have no Right to do  There are many Examples of the like kind in several other Parts of the World but these are sufficient  I might bring this home to the Harbour of  Ostend  I am not sensible that any Treaty or Convention by which the Emperor enjoys that Port obliges him not to enlarge it deepen the Channel make Piers Basins or any thing else as shall appear for his Convenience and for the Security of his Merchants and of their Ships I say I do not know that the Emperor is under any Treaty or Obligation not to do this and so his ordering these Enlargements are no Contravention of any such Treaty nor any just Ground of Quarrel or Jealousy for why should not his Imperial Majesty do every just thing for the Good of his People the Encouragement of their Commerce the Security of their Ships and the like  But as these Works at  Ostend  are evidently design'd for the receiving and protecting the Ships encouraging the Trade and carrying on the new Company's Commerce to the  Indies  which Trade the Emperor is expresly bound even in the very Tenure of his Possession not to support or carry on or to suffer to be carried on then the Case differs exceedingly and even the fortifying  Ostend  deepening and enlarging the Harbour and the like as mentioned above is a just matter of Jealousy and however lawful in itself yet intimates plainly that the Emperor and his Subjects are resolved to continue and carry on that Trade how prejudicial soever to their Neighbours the  English  and  Dutch  and however it may appear to be inconsistent with the Treaties and Obligations which His Imperial Majesty is bound by and enjoys the Country by the Stipulation of  It evidently shews a resolved Temper a fixed Design and Disposition to continue that Commerce however injurious to us their Neighbours and that if it cannot be otherwise obtained instead of abating or laying it down as was expected and according to the Remonstrances of the Allies they resolve rather to maintain it by Force and menacing the Ally'd Powers with their formidable Resentments pretend to make War upon those that shall interrupt it as if they were able to Act in the same Hostile manner they talk of and as if their Power was equal to their Bluster on those Occasions  This is what in our vulgar way we call  Showing their Teeth  and could they do no more that way by Land than they can by Sea it would merit some vulgar Talking of it But as they seem to threaten the World with their mighty Forces and that those Forces are indeed Considerable at least are far from being Despicable this is that which tells me there seems to be a Necessity of a War  The  Flemings  talk big and say if the  Dutch  for Example date to touch their Ships and interrupt their Trade in and to the  Indies  the Emperor will attack them with all his Forces by Land That I call War and that is what I call the Necessity of a War For it seems not to be expected that Marine Trading Nations such as the  English  and  Dutch  whose Trade to the  Indies  is so considerable and which the Emperor is by Treaty bound not to Invade will sit still and see it Invaded and Insulted On the contrary I think they will not must not cannot do it  If then the  Dutch  c cannot must not and will not bear this Commerce and the Emperor will not cannot lay it down and give it over and threatens them if they offer to interrupt it What follows What is the necessary Consequence but a War Nay What are these Things but a War in Effect if not in all the Circumstances of it And where these things are Acted in this Manner how can any Man make a Question whether a War will happen or no  CHAP V  Whether in Point of Right and Wrong we ought or may conclude that a War ought to be the Consequence of the present Councils in  Europe  IT is not the most difficult Thing in the World to make a Judgment of what  may be  by  what is  The publick Conduct of Princes and States seldom so effectually disguises their Intentions but some Rational Observations may be made some Just Inferences drawn and some Probable Guesses be made of what will be the Issue of their Councils  The present Politicks of  Europe  are indeed more Intricate than ordinary And yet they are not without evident visible Marks of the Intention that several Princes and Powers have or had to Break the Peace of the World and invade the  Property  and  Commerce  of their Neighbours in order to begin a War  I have already mention'd that the  Czarina  or Empress of  Muscovy  had form'd a Resolution to begin a War and put and End to the Tranquility of  Europe  by an Attempt upon the King of  Denmark  in Favour of the Duke of  Holstein  I do not say positively it is so but who can make any Doubt of it To what Purpose were the Neighbours of that Princess alarm'd in that Manner And why was the  British  Squadron sent into the  Baltick  to prevent those Attempts if there was not such an apparent Design Nor as I am told did the Court of  Petersburgh  so much as endeavour to Conceal it but rather sollicited other Powers to Assist the said Duke in what they call'd Recovering his Inheritance  Again who can doubt the Resolutions of the  British  Court if possible to Preserve the Peace keep every one in the quiet Possession of what they held and tye up every Side to those Terms of Peace which they had already Consented to when they saw the  British  Fleet block up the Aggressors in their Ports and put an End to all the violent Measures resolv'd on A Testimony also that such Measures were resolv'd on  As to the Justice of the Duke of  Holstein  's Claim to the Possession of his Antient Dominions I have nothing to do with that here Be it Just or Unjust that they were taken from him and be it Right or Wrong that they are kept  from him that is not the Question to us But as the  Czarina  Aiding the Duke with a Powerful Army as was intended for the Recovery of those Dominions would necessarily have begun a War and perhaps embarked several Princes on both Sides in the Quarrel so far the Pacifick Powers were justly engag'd to prevent it and probably may exert themselves in the same or like manner to do the like for the future and that not only there but any where else where they find the like Occasion  Not that  Great Britain  should be always at the Yearly Expence of such a Fleet to keep the  Muscovite  Fleet within Bounds and to preserve the Peace of the  Baltick  But it is to be suppos'd that the  Swedish  and  Danish  Powers being United they may at length join their Fleets and be in a Condition to match the  Muscovite  Fleet and Command the Sea so as to keep them up within their Ports without the Assistance of their Neighbours  From thence let us consider the Preparations of the Imperialists Why should I not say that it is very probable they intend a War when we have the following Account published in one of our publick Papers said to be come from the Council of the  States General  Hague  Decemb N S  Some Days ago the Ministers of  Great Britain  and  France  were invited to a Solemn Conference with the  States General  where their High Mightiness's Deputies opened the Discourse with a Recapitulation of all the Resolutions taken by the States since their Accession to the Treaty of  Hanover  that regarded the Military Preparations to which they added That since there remained little or no Likelyhood that the Differences between the Contending Powers of  Europe  could be amicably Adjusted during the Winter the  States  had all the Reason in the World to fear that the Emperor would in Revenge for such their Accession begin Hostilities against the Republick either by Attacking it with open Force or by stopping the Payment of the Subsidies stipulated by the Barrier Treaty  The Reason of my quoting this Speech of the  States  Deputies is very plain as the Speech it self is very convincing in the Case before us If the  States  have all the Reason in the World to fear that the Emperor will begin Hostilities with them for their Acceding to the  Hanover Treaty  then we have the same Reason that is to say all the Reason in the World to believe a War will follow So that there you  have the Answer of the  States General  directly to this great Question about the War  Here is another Thing also advanc'd in that short Speech of the  Dutch  Deputies which affords us some Foundation for the Arguments already used where I seem to insist That the  War  is as it were already resolv'd on if not begun by the  Imperialists  and  Spaniards  and by their interrupting and invading our Commerce The Deputies say  "They have all the Reason in the World to fear that the Emperor will begin Hostilities against the Republick either by Attacking it with open Force or by stopping the Subsidies stipulated by the Barrier Treaty  Where  Stopping the Payment  of stipulated Subsidies to the  Dutch  Troops is call'd a Beginning of Hostilities And is not then stopping the Course of stipulated Commerce a Beginning of Hostilities I cannot refrain saying I think it is And  if so  then I think the Hostilities are begun as much as if the Armies were in the Field or the Fleets engag'd  But now as to the Question as it stands in Point of RIGHT that indeed differs exceedingly for 'tis one Thing to ask me Whether  I believe  the Emperor WILL begin a War and another Thing Whether HE OUGHT to do so or has a just Cause to do it  or no  As to the Question Whether the Emperor  ought  to begin a War I have two Reasons to give why I think not why I think the Emperor ought not to make a War as well in general as not in particular in this Case  Because  in general  no War ought to be made among Christians but upon just and unavoidable Occasion Had this War been entred upon only in Support of a Commerce set up upon unjust Foundations against express Stipulations and against the Tenor of Conditions on which the very Country came to the Emperor in which he carries it on he rather might be said to forfeit by this Encroachment the Right he had than have a new Right to push on Separate Interests in Prejudice of others  Because  in particular  he is under Special and Personal Obligations to the very Nations who are injured by this Commerce and that such as that to them he owes the very Possessions and Dominions which he enjoys as well in that as in several other Parts of the World The  Netherlands  may be said to be their Gift to him they were gain'd at their Cost at the Expence of their Blood and Treasure And tho' it might be call'd his Right yet 'tis very probable he had never had the Possession of that Right if they had not Powerfully  supported his Claim conquer'd the Country by their Armies put it into his Hand and obtained the Concession of  France  to it by the Treaty of Peace concluded at  Utrecht  GRATITUDE binds Princes as well as private Men Nations as well as particular Persons And such good Offices as these can never be too much acknowledg'd or too well requited To say Kings and Emperors are not bound by such Obligations is to say Kings and Emperors are not or can not be Good Men or Honest Men  GRATITUDE is a Branch of  Honesty  and it is very hard to say or even to think a Man can be Honest that is not Grateful for as  Gratitude  respects an Obligation past or a Kindness receiv'd so it is no more or less than paying a Debt and tho' the Debt be not such perhaps as can be demanded by Process if it were the Creditor could oblige the Debtor to Payment yet the Obligation is the stronger The Man of Honour always thinks himself bound faster by the generous Kindness of his Friend than by his own Bond and will more punctually pay a Debt of Honour than a Debt of Law  To say a Prince is above all Acknowledgment and all Returns of  Gratitude  is to say a Prince is not bound by Principles of  Honour  Nor can Reasons of State ballance this Principle of Honour or the Sense of Obligation in a Prince The late King  Charles  II and indeed the whole  English  Nation left a remarkable Testimony of their publick Regard to this Principle of Honour upon Record even in a National Capacity which I cannot but mention  After the Restoration the  English  Parliament thought it convenient for the Publick Good to make several strict Laws against Popish Recusants and especially against Popish Priests who were on the severest Penalties forbid residing here and particularly officiating as Priests  Yet not the King only but the Parliament it self in all their Acts made an Exception for Father  Huddleston  a Priest nay a  Jesuit  in perpetual Remembrance of and  Gratitude  for his Fidelity to the Person of the King in concealing his Majesty and assisting to his Escape even at the Hazard of his own Life and in Contempt of the Reward of  l  offered by the Enemy for the Discovery after the Defeat of the Royal Army at  Worcester  Here was a Testimony of a Nation's  Gratitude  and of a Prince's  Gratitude  and that even when the said Nation was under  the most powerful and just Apprehensions of the pernicions Practices of those very Priests for the perverting both Prince and People to Popery and when that Prince as it was said at last was influenced so far as to be secretly reconcil'd  c  But GRATITUDE never dyes and Obligation never ceases nothing can wear it out of the Mind where the Mind is once possess'd with Principles of Honour of Religion and of Justice A Man of Honour can no more be Ingrate than a Man of Honesty can Steal Ingratitude is hardly to be express'd by any Word worse than it self and therefore 'twas the Saying of a great Man  That to say a Man is Ingrate is to say All of him that is Evil  Ingratitude being a Complication of almost all Crimes 'Tis a cancelling all Obligations in the Mind and harbouring Mischief and Resentment instead of Affection and a Sense of Obligation  I have heard from some of our Moralizing Criticizing Friends who are fam'd for searching too nicely into Nature's  Arcana  that it is an Evil rooted in Mankind to have an Aversion instead of Affection where they are overloaded with Obilgation That Man thro' a certain secret Pride natural to him and introduced by the first Seeds of Degeneracy constantly hates to be Obliged beyond his Power to make Returns  That as long as he can balance Accounts and while he is upon the Square he will be an entire Friend and act as such upon every Occasion nay he will be pleased with the Occasion of overpaying the Debt But when he sees a Weight of Obligation flowing in too heavy for him to throw off that the Debt is too great to be paid and that he can never hope to balance the Account he grows sick of the Obligation and consequently throwing off all thoughts of Return Hatred comes in of Course for the Man hates to see the Person to whom he must be always making Acknowledgments  I will not say how far I am or am not of this Opinion in this Case but I must own that I can find out no other Way or at least no better Way to account for the Conduct of a certain Prince in the World I mean as to Obligations laid upon him Personally as well as in his Publick Capacity by the  British  Nation  I remember a small Book or Pamphlet published in the Year Entituled IMPERIAL GRATITUDE drawn from a modest View of the Conduct of the Emperor  Charles  VI and the King of  Spain Charles  III with Observations on the Difference  In this Book there is a large Account of Obligations laid on his Majesty  Charles  III then King of  Spain  by the late Queen and the  British  Nation and the GRATEFUL RETURNS made by his Imperial Majesty  Charles  VI The former taken principally from Acknowledgments under his Catholick Majesty's own Hand and the rest from the Votes and Orders of Parliament and other Authentick Vouchers a few of which may not be improper to be quoted in this Case because of some additional Articles which  Great Britain  is able to add to the Account since the Accession of His Majesty King  George  It is in every one's Memory how after the Death of  Charles  II King of  Spain  the House of  Austria  and the House of  Bourbon  severally claimed the Succession to that Crown and how the Emperor  Leopold  then living causing his eldest Son  Joseph  to Renounce who being then King of  Hungaria  and King of the  Romans  was presumptive Successor tho' in Election to the Empire declared his Second Son the then ArchDuke  Charles  King of  Spain  and made Application to the Confederates then in War against  France  for their Assistance and for placing him upon the Throne for None else could do it  Let us see in what humble Terms as to his Grandson the good old Emperor writes to the Allies and especially to the Queen of  England  Take it Word for Word from his Imperial Majesty's own Hand N B  The  Emperor  does not give the Title of  Majesty  but  Serenity  to any Kings or Queens  Our said Son would gladly signifie this to your Serenity and express our Joint  Gratitude  and  Acknowledgment  of it in Person But since the present Posture of the Common Affairs calls him further he will perform this in another Method at his Arrival But may it please your Serenity in the mean time to allow us since he is to leave us in a few Days wholly to deliver him over and to recommend him to your Serenity as to another MOTHER with Assurance on his Part That as long as  he Lives  he shall honour your Serenity with Filial Respect and that our Family shall ever be obliged to serve your Serenity in the strictest Manner and in perpetual Gratitude  Vienna  Sept  Signed LEOPOLD  'In consequence of this Recommendation says my Author the young King is sent by Land from  Vienna  to  Holland  and passing from thence to  England  we find him receiv'd  with all the Respect and magnificent Bounty that suited the first Steps taken for his Advancement  'He had his first Access to the Queen at  Windsor Dec  Her Majesty receiv'd him at the Head of the Stairs where his first Bow seemed by those that saw it to signify that he meant to kiss the Ground at her Majesty's Feet Then he made the Queen a becoming Compliment acknowledging his great Obligations to her  After this when the said King arriv'd at  Lisbon  being complimented by Mr  Methuen English  Ambassador to the King of  Portugal  says the same Author  'His Majesty receiv'd him very graciously and expressed in the most obliging Terms the great Respect and Veneration he hath for her Majesty and how sensible he is of the great and many Obligations he oweth her which he hopeth he should be so happy as to be able to return in such a manner as might shew the whole World the grateful Sense he should always retain of her Majesty's Kindness to him'  Here is Part of the Obligation acknowledged to the Queen Personally  Let us follow his Catholick Majesty into  Catalonia  and there we find him acknowledging the same Things to the whole  British  Nation and indeed with the same or greater Reason  He arriv'd at  Barcelona  in  Septemb  aided by the Confederate Forces he Lands takes  Barcelona Gironne Lerida  and  Tortosa  and in a Word the greatest Part of the whole Principality  In acknowledgment of the great Assistance he receiv'd from this Service he writes to the Queen a long Letter throughout which he expresses his Grateful Sense of it but in particular as it respects the whole Kingdom as well as the Queen he has among others this high Expression  I receive so great an Assistance from your Majesty and your GENEROUS NATION that I am overcome with your Goodness and in the greatest Confusion that I should be the Occasion of so great an Expence for the Supporting my Interest  And after other lofty Expressions his Majesty concludes thus  I am ever with the most sincere Affection Respect and Gratitude  Madam My Sister  Your most Affectionate Brother CHARLES  From the Camp at  Senia  before  Barcelona  Octob    No body can say but his Catholick Majesty expresses himself here like a Man of Honour and like a Prince that had on his Mind a deep Impression of what had been done  Nor can it be denied but that as these Obligations were laid on him not by the Queen only but by the whole  British  Nation the Debt descends with the Crown and the Gratitude becomes due to His present Majesty in Right of the  British  Nation and we shall see it still more plainly when I shall give you the Account of the Blood and Treasure expended by this Nation in particular for the Service of this very Prince where we shall find that it cost  England  the Blood of almost sixty thousand Soldiers and above eight Millions of Treasure to support his Cause in  Spain  only and that even his being elected Emperor was owing to the powerful Influence of the  British  Interest at that time all which are at large express'd in the Tract just now quoted  Pag    as follows  viz  An Account of Troops as well raised in  England  as in  Spain  and  Portugal  for the Service of King  Charles III  at the proper Expence and in the Pay of  England        Men  The First Shipping  Shipped from  England  with Duke  Schomburgh       Raised in  Portugal  at the  English  Expence      With the Earl of  Galway      With the Earl of  Peterborough       Ditto  from  Gibraltar       Recruits       More Regiments the same Year       Recruits      With the Earl  Rivers      This Year       Recruits      Sent to  Portugal            Besides these  England  Paid Hired Raised or Sent at their Proper Expence the following Troops        Men    Raised by King  Charles  in  Catalonia  and paid by the Queen of  GreatBritain       Form'd there after the Battel of  Almanza  in  English  Pay       Paid more from  Italy      Sent from  Italy  but paid by  GreatBritain      Ditto      Ditto                            So that in the whole here was ninety five thousand four hundred and five Men actually landed in  Portugal  and  Spain  or raised there and all paid at the Expence of  GreatBritain  Well might the King express himself under great Obligations to this GENEROUS NATION  Let us now see a Sketch of the Expence which  England  was at in particular for this Service and this we have in the same Tract  Page  taken from the appropriating Votes in the several Parliaments of those Years as follows  An Acount of the Expence of the War in  Spain  as it was published in a Book Entitled  Imperial Gratitude  c        l  s  d  The Alliance with  Portugal  in Behalf of King  Charles  III was in the Year  Money for the Service the first Year there being no Parliamentary Provision           More added to the same Year provided for by Parliament          Allowed by Parliament for the War with  Spain  in Defence of K  Charles  III           Expended more the same Year          Appointed by Parliament for the same Service          Ditto          Ditto          Ditto      ½    Ditto          Ditto          Not settl'd at the publishing that Book but the Author takes it by Proportion at           Total in Sterling Money      ½  These things says the Author would hardly seem creditable were not the Vouchers ready to confirm the Particulars and to prove every Part of them and he adds  'That after such an immense Expence of Blood and Treasure laid out in his Service it would have been very Grateful and Honourable and perhaps but Reasonable that His Majesty should have written one Letter more to assure Her Majesty He will think now of some Means to pay or secure the Payment of those immense Sums which the Queen had laid out to assist him  The same Book gives a particular Account of his Majesty's being besieged in the City of  Barcelona  and of the Distress he was reduced to gives Copies of the pressing Letters which the King wrote to Her Majesty for Succours and the Account of the timely Deliverance obtained by the Assistance of the  British  Fleet and Troops in raising the Siege and causing the  French  Army to retire with Disgrace which adds to the Account and heightens the Obligation that his Majesty acknowledged himself to be under before  After this the Death of the Emperor  Joseph  happen'd and then all the Confederates but  England  in particular made the most powerful Instances among the Princes of  Germany  to procure the Election of the King of  Spain  and carried it for his Majesty against all the Intrigues of the  French  Court and the particular Application of the Electors of  Bavaria  and  Cologn  This finished the Fortunes of his Catholick Majesty and advanced him to the highest Degree of Human Glory that this World can bestow  Let us cease here a little 'till the Accession of his present Majesty to the Throne of  GreatBritain  and besides all the Obligations laid on his Imperial Majesty of another kind of which I have no room to enlarge in this Place we may at once look into the Quadruple Alliance a Treaty which by the Interest and Influence of his  Britanick  Majesty was calculated for the particular Service of the Emperor the King of  France  was brought to assist by his Arms to bring the King of  Spain  to hearken to Reason and to come to the Terms of the Truce and  Spain  pressed by the Arms of  France  did consent to put an end to the War  Without the powerful Fleet of the King of  GreatBritain  opening the Sea to the Imperialists and shutting it up from the  Spaniards  defeating and taking their whole Fleet the Imperialists had never been able to have taken the Kingdom of  Sicily  So that it is to the glorious Arms of His Majesty  that the  Spaniards  were driven out of that Kingdom and the Emperor put in Possession of it  Now bring all this down to the present State of Things May we not civilly examine for which of all these Acts of generous Assistance of the  British  Nation I say for which of them it is that the Court of  Vienna  or the Emperor has prohibited the  English  Commerce at the Fair of  Messina  the very City King  George  may be said to have conquered for him for which of them he has invaded our  EastIndia  Trade and prohibited all our  English  Manufactures in the great Market of  Lintz  by Sound of Trumpet  May we not say Is this  Imperial Gratitude  Is this a suitable Return to His Majesty and to the powerful Efforts of a Generous Nation for the Interest and Honour of the Emperor Is it what His Majesty might reasonably expect or what the  British  Nation had Reason to look for Or is this the Way the Princes of that Part of the World pay their Debts of Honour and balance the great Obligations which they receive from one another We hope we might say this without Offence  Let the Language of His late Imperial Majesty's Letters to the late Queen to the Duke of  Marlborough  and to the States of  Holland  at the naming his Grandson to the Succession of  Spain  and after the Battel of  Blenheim  and the Language of His present Imperial Majesty when shut up in  Barcelona  and in Danger of being carried in Triumph to  Madrid  be all considered when he was every Hour expecting a general Assault and begged of Sir  George Rook  to come speedily to his Relief  I say let these which are at hand to produce and which had I room I could give you at large to illustrate this Part be considered May we not compare them with the Terms now used in Return to the frequent Memorials and Representations of the  British  and  Dutch  Ambassadors at  Madrid  claiming a just and friendly Performance not of Promises only and grateful Remembrances of generous and kind Actions done but of solemn Treaties and Leagues Treaties of Peace and Commerce Friendship and good Understanding wherein Limits of Trade as well as Dominion are settled and adjusted Let the haughty Answers and the Expostulations of Resentment which Fame says were returned by the Court of  V  to Memorials framed with the utmost Respect be all Duly considered and compared as above and what shall we conclude from it what can we say except that perhaps this is the Meaning of that hitherto Misunderstood Expression that difficult and doubtful Thing called IMPERIAL GRATITUDE  From all which however we may flatter our selves that for the future the  British  Nation and their generous Princes will consider very well how they oblige Emperors again beyond their Power of Requital and how they spend Eight Millions to set a Prince upon a Throne that shall turn the Arms of that very Power they gave him against the Interest of his Benefactors  But Heaven whose Impartial Justice the  British  Nation and their injur'd Sovereign appeal to in all this will no doubt soon discover its Sentiments of these things and the Power God has put into his Majesty's Hands can never be better employed than to humble the Insolence of such Powers as think themselves above the Natural Laws of Friendship and Gratitude and regard no Justice but as it conforms with their Interest and encreases their Power  CHAP VI  Of the  Spaniards  being Aggressors in the War their Pretences how trisling their Power how far from being formidable and of what the Consequences of a War may be as well to them as to us  IF we may judge by the Appearance of Things there are two Articles in this Forwardness of the  Spaniards  to Quarrel which make it very preposterous on their Side  First  That they are as ill able to manage a Quarrel with  England  especially as any Nation in  Europe  Secondly  They have as little Pretence to make a Quarrel of it  As to their Ability to manage a War with us I have spoken of it in particular already and lest I should be told 'tis time enough to boast  when we put our Armour off  I am content to stay 'till then and let the  Spaniards  count their Gain when they have had their Fill of a War so I say no more of that now  As to their Pretences or the Causes of Quarrel I can find but two that is to say all that I can meet with on their own Part or that they so much as pretend to may be reduced to two Heads  First  The Affair of the  British  Squadron lying before  Porto Belo  or as they commonly express it Blocking up their Ports and in it their PlateFleet  Secondly  The  English  refusing to restore  PortMahon  and  Gibraltar  As for the First they make a great Noise of it complain of its being an Insulting their Coast an open Violation of Friendship an Interruption of Commerce and an Act of Hostility with much more of that Kind and upon this we are now told they draw together their Armies Hover about  Gibraltar  tho' they are able to do very little to it talk of Building new Fortifications to incommode the Bay or Port buy Ships of War and in a word show by many weak Advances that they resolve upon a War  Certainly the  Spaniards  have very wrong Notions of their own Strength or else we are ill inform'd about it and particularly how ill able they are with all their Strength tho' it were double to what it is to annoy the  English  or defend themselves against us  That they are not equal by Sea is very evident 'tis no Boasting to say they cannot look us in the Face upon the Saltwater all the Naval Force of  Spain  were it brought together and had they the greatest Liberty given them they could desire to bring it together could not fight a Squadron of twenty  British Third Rates  and this I say is far from being a Bluster since it was proved at Cape  Passaro  where the  Spaniards  had the best Fleet and the biggest Ships that they have ever seen at Sea  of their Own  for a hundred Years past  What then are the  Spaniards  doing Do they reflect that  Great Britain France  and the  StatesGeneral  the three greatest Marine Powers in the World are in Alliance and may come to act in Conjunction in this War if there was any Occasion for it against one alas how Impotent fingle Power of  Spain  Have they considered what they are able to do against Three such Powers United the weakest of whom are able to blow all the Ships of  Spain  out of the Sea and make them not dare to stir out of their Ports What can the King of  Spain  or the Council of  Spain  think of such an unequal War and what Encouragement can their Officers and Seamen have to engage in their Service or embark in their Ships where they are so sure to be beaten  Have the  Spaniards  consider'd that they have a vast unguarded Coast for above a thousand Miles lying upon the Sea as well on the Side of the Ocean as in the  Mediterranean  from St  Sebastian  at the bottom of the Bay of  Biscay  to  Viana  on the Edge of  Galitia  and from the River  Guadiana  on the side of  Andalusia  to the Mouth of the  Straits  and thence to the Bay of  Roses  on the Frontiers of  Rousillon  in the Dominion of  France  The Length of this Coast is at least twelve hundred Miles Not all the Force of  Spain  nay scarce all the Men in  Spain  were they arm'd and form'd into Regiments could guard such an extended Coast so as that they could prevent its being continually harrass'd and insulted by an Enemy that is thus superior at Sea and who can appear now on this side now on that and whose Motions it is impossible any Troops on Shore can follow or observe  What strange Havock could the Allies thus arm'd and Superior at Sea make upon the Coast of  Spain  and whether they ever landed or no their very hovering upon the Coast is Alarm enough to keep the whole Country waking and hurry and fatigue their Soldiers to Death by hasty Marches in a hot Climate so that the Troops would be ruin'd as effectually as if they had been beaten in the Field  As to their blustering about  Gibraltar  and threatning to besiege it with twenty five thousand Men I may speak of it by it self But let us look a little off of their Military Part to that of their Commerce  The first Attack they have made upon us there for there also they are Aggressors is their publick prohibiting the wearing our Manufacture in their Country  Prohibiting the Importation follows of Course  How ill they are able to furnish Manufactures by the Industry of their own People to supply the Place of ours I have mention'd already but let me ask the  Spaniards  a few Trading Questions upon this Occasion  Trading Nations never prohibit the Exportation of their own Goods whether the Growth of their Country or the Labour of their People To Prohibit Trade with  England  is to prohibit the Exportation of their own Growth which by the way is the main Wealth of their Country I mean as to its home Product And can they live without the Trade with  England  Have they consider'd what they shall do if  England  finding the  Spaniards  refuse to take off their Cloths and Stuffs their Woollen Manufacture of all Kinds and their other needful Exports should refuse to take off their Wines Brandies Oil Raisins Oranges Lemons Almonds Soap  Spanish  Wool and if  France  should refuse their Wool and Iron and all their other Produce They need not perhaps forbid their Subjects the  wearing any Silks or Stuffs of  England  or  France  they would be naked enough for they would soon have no Money to buy them and must be glad to buy Blankets and Woadmill of the  Moors  of  Africk  to cover them  Xeres de la Fronteira  is a Place near the Coast in the Bay between  Cadiz  and  Sevil  that Country is full of Vines and they tell us that they make sixty thousand Pipes or Buts of Sherrey every Year and most of this is brought away by the  English Dutch  and  Hamburgers  but if the  English  and  Dutch  refuse it how will all that Country live how will the Vines run wild and be ruin'd the People starve and have no Employment and the Lands lye waste  The like is to be said of their Oil and Soap at  Sevil  of which the Quantity is exceeding great so that they have one Wood opposite to  Sevil  nine Leagues in Circuit all of OliveTrees from which they tell us they make sixteen thousand Quintals of Soap in a Year but unless they can sell off this Soap and the Oil to  England Holland  c all will be waste for the Quantity they can consume at home is next tonothing  The  Canary Islands  have no other considerable Market for their Wines but to  England  except what casual Ships take off going to  Africa  or  America  if the  English  forsake the Place and leave off the Trade those Islands are undone and the  Spaniards  themselves have always been so sensible of this that when there has been a War between the two Nations the King of  Spain  has always allow'd the  Canary  Trade to be open to  England  and to enjoy as it were a Neutrality that their Wines may be taken off  From thence let us go on to the South Coast of  Spain  in the  Mediterranean  and there is first  Malaga  a City flourishing and rich the Customs they say pay the King of  Spain  eighty thousand Pieces of Eight a Year for that one Port But with whom is their Trade I insist that five Parts of six of their whole Trade is with the  English  the Wines especially those we now call  white Mountain  call'd so because they grow on the Sides of the Hills on all the North Part of  Granada  who Buys them and where are they Drank The  French  buy no Wines the  Italians  buy no Wines the  Moors  are all  Mabometans  they drink none none but the  English  and perhaps one Ship or two at most to  Holland  Their Raisons called  Malaga  Raifins come almost all to  England  their Lemons go indeed to  Holland  and the Neighbouring Coasts but three times as many to  England  as to all other Places and what will the Loss of such a Trade be to them How will the Country be ruin'd and the People starv'd if they cannot put off their Wine and Fruit  The Trade at  Alicant  is much the same as at  Malaga  only their Wines are richer such as  Tent  and red  Alicant  bought usually to give Strength and Colour to other Wines Their Raifins are the best in the World and are Ship'd off yearly in a prodigious Quantity but all chiefly to  England  The same Trade continues a long way on the Coast of  Valentia  Upon the  Catalonian  Coast there is the same Trade for Wines  viz  at  Bene Carlo Barcellona  and other Ports but all for  England  also some Brandy is brought from thence and who will have the Loss if all these Wines are left upon their Hands  It must be the most ignorant thing in the World of its kind to have the  Spaniards  prohibit wearing our Manufactures when they have no other to wear and to stop the Trade to  England  when they have no other Market for their General Produce  But I return now to the Affair of a War What is  Spain  a doing They tell us they are drawing an Army together to attack  Gibraltar  but do the  Spaniards  consider two things  First  That  Gibraltar  is so situated that it cannot be attack'd Do they remember that the Marshal  de Tesse  sent the King of  France  Word that to continue the Siege of  Gibraltar  would but ruin the whole Infantry and that forty thousand Men could never take it by Land  Secondly  Do they know that as soon as they begin this Enterprize they may expect the  French  with two Armies upon their Frontiers one on the Side of  Catalonia  and the other on the Side of  Navarr  and that by drawing their Troops off to the remotest Angle of their vast Country of  Spain  they must leave their Frontiers open to the  French  and that it will be very hard to bring them back upon an Emergence when they are at least five hundred Miles off  But we are answered That 'tis a Mistake the King of  Spain  is not forming the Siege of  Gibraltar  he has only ordered a Fort or some Forts to be built in proper Places and upon his own Lands which is no Breach of the Peace for sure he may have the Liberty to do what he pleases upon his own Lands  We cannot give an Answer to this here because we do not know how far the Fact is true and we have it yet by Report only But this we may venture to say  If the  Spaniards  build or fortifie in the Neighbourhood of  Gibraltar  or on the Bay or Coast about it as it reported 'tis either to incommode the Town and Port of  Gibraltar  or it is not if it is not and there is no Reason to take umbrage at it or  complain of it then I suppose we shall not complain of it for  England  will certainly take no Offence where no Cause of Offence is given  But if this is done with Design either to Streighten and Block up the Town or to incommode the Navigation of the Port and the Commerce This is in a plain Sense an Act of Hostility and can be taken for no other and Force is not to be Complain'd of only but to be Repell'd  Not but that even in this the  Spaniards  seem to be rather showing their Teeth than any thing else Nor does it appear that they are able to do any considerable Injury to the Port and none at all to the Town of  Gibraltar  The Bay of  Gibraltar  is at least five Miles over at the Entrance that is from Cape to Cape and 'tis not less than three or four Miles over within the Bay opposite to the Town and where the old Town of  Gibraltar  stood  The Depth of Water is such that the largest Ships may ride almost any where and they have from to Fathom Water right against and near to the Entrance of the Mole and in the Offing they find no Ground at Fathom  as appears by the Plan  Whatever the  Spaniards  can pretend to do by Fortifying the opposite Shore I leave to the Judgment of the Publick as I do whether they ought to be allowed to Fortify there or no  As to any thing they can do by Land to  Gibraltar  I believe the Government are in no great Pain about it only that they will take Care to put such a Garrison into it as may give the  Spaniards  occasion to be more appehensive of Disturbance from the Town than the Town from them  The Town is a  Peninsula  'tis to be attack'd no way in Form but by that small Neck of Land which joyns it to the Continent of  Spain  and there the Access to it is Naturally so difficult and by the Addition of Art made so impracticable that I believe the Garrison are in no Pain about what the  Spaniards  can do that way Upon the Whole I may say of  Gibraltar  as the  French  formerly said of  Dunkirk  Il et une Place Terrible  For the farther Information of the Reader and to make what I have said be perfectly Intelligible I have here given a Plan of the Situation as well of the Bay as of the Town and of the opposite Coast by which the Reader will judge whether the  Spaniards  Act like Men in their Senses or no in pretending to attack the Place while at the same Time they know they are not Masters of the Sea or able to hinder its being relieved as often as there is Occasion  map of the bay of Gibraltar  The Bay of  Gibraltar  with a View of the Town c  A Entrance

CONCLUSION  HAVING thus observed the angry impotent Disposition of the Neighbouring Powers in the  Vienna Treaty  for a War it remains to inquire What our Share may be in it and what  England  has to be frighted and terrify'd at among all those Blusters and high Words  For my Part I have considered with all possible Gravity every Part of the Thing and I can see no Thunder in all these Clouds the gathering Vapours may portend some Storm but I don't see it can reach us I wish other People would examine it too  The utmost I can see in it all is that they may put us to some Expence and that is in its Kind a Grievance 'tis true but let the  Spaniards  look out sharp 'tis Ten to One but we may make our selves whole at their Expence one Way or other Now and then a Galeon or two falling in our Way may make us Amends for a whole Expedition and we must have worse Luck than ordinary if we chop upon none of them  In the first Place Their Privateering will not give us much Uneasiness in our Trade a Thing which was always our great Inconvenience in a War either with the  French  or  Dutch  There are but three Places which will be against us in this War where Privateers of any Note are usually fitted out  The Port of  Ostend  The  Biscayners  that is to say the Ports of St  Sebastian  and St  Andero  The  Majorkins  in the  Mediterranean  The First of these have been considerable in former Wars But will be now so surrounded all the Ports of  Great Britain France  and  Holland  being shut against them and all the Ships of those Powers being their Enemies that I do not see how they will dare to stir out or if they should take a Prize how they would be able to carry it home the utmost they could do would be to Cruise upon the Coast of  Spain  that they might have the Ports of  Galitia  or of  Andalusia  for their Retreat and that would not be so fatal to us but that we might venture them there But all our Channel Trade Coal Trade and Coast Trade would be very quiet and undisturb'd which three Articles were the great Sufferers in the  last Wars with  France  and are generally so in any War with the Marine Powers on this Side of the World  The  Biscayams  again have the same Restraint in its Degree for as the  French  are at their Door and our Trade lying so distant as the Mouth of the Channel they must go a great way for Purchase and have a long Run back again for Safety when they take a Prize in which Case 'tis great Odds but they may be met with by either  French  or  English  In the late War when they had all the  French  Coast to befriend them and could run into any of their Ports either in Stress of Weather or when chas'd or when favour'd with a good Prize then indeed their Risque was not so great and sometimes they made a good Hand of it But I am much mistaken if they will pretend to fit out many Privateers upon all the Coasts as the Case is like to stand with them now  The  Majorkins  then are the only People left and their Roving may be confined to the  Mediterranean  where there are three Things to be observed which makes our Trade pretty secure  The  Majorkin  Rovers are all small they never carry above Eight to Twelve and Sixteen Guns being rather Sloops and a kind of Galleybuilt Vessels than Ships made for nimble Sailing and Roving also and they dare not attack Ships of good Force  Most of our Ships Trading into those Seas are Ships of good Force and particularly in Case of a War will be so from Twentyfour to Thirtysix Guns and will seldom go without Convoy neither so that the  Majorkins  will very rarely venture upon them    Majorca  is so Situated between  Gibraltar  and  PortMahon  that they will find it very hard to keep the Seas without being intercepted by some of our Men of War who will be perfectly Masters of the Sea and be always Cruising between the Straits Mouth and that Island and also Westward between the Island and the Coast of  Italy  Thus I think we need not be very anxious for our Trade on Account of their Privateers Some few may indeed appear in the Bay of  Cadiz  fitted out at Port St  Mary Sevil  S L  and those Places and may Cruise off of the Southward Cape and the Coast of  Portugal  But 'tis hoped we may have so good a Lookout there for Galeons and such People that the Privateers will find but little Good upon that Coast  We are told indeed that the  Spaniards  will have Privateers and Cruisers among our Islands in the  WestIndies  in the Gulph of  Florida  and on the Coast of  Carolina  and  Virginia  these may indeed harbour at the  Havana  St  Augustine  and St  Domingo  and have several Skulking Places on the North Side of the Gulph of  Mexico  But as our Squadron in those Seas is already very strong and likely to be stronger it may be no difficult Matter to keep those Seas clear and perhaps the  Havana  may not always be a Retreat for them as strong as it is of which more may be said when a War if it is to be a War is actually begun  Having thus stated the Case as to Privateering let us examine the other great Articles in which the Enemy think they can wound us and they are I think but two  Prohibitions of Commerce  Alarms about the Pretender  Prohibitions of Commerce It is true every Prohibition of Commerce to a Trading Country as this is may in some particular Case or other be a Loss as it stops some of the Channels of our Trade by which our great Vent of Woollen Manufacture in particular is circulated and extended in the World But it is also the particular Happiness of our Woollen Manufacture that the several Countries where it is carried and sold are generally in as much want of the Goods or of the Sale and Consumption of those Goods which  England  takes in Return for them as we can be of the Sale of ours and in particular the King of  Spain  is eminent for both these Circumstances as has been mentioned already  The Consequence of this has always been that either by Connivance or by the Interposition of Neutral Nations Trade has always found private Channels of Conveyance and the Merchants find Ways and Means to furnish themselves on one Hand and dispose of their Product on the other so that such Prohibitions serve indeed to make Things sell for a better Price than ordinary but seldom put a full Stop to the Trade Were it so I dare venture to affirm  Spain  would be the greatest Loser by the Prohibition besides being far from the best able to bear it  What Lengths the  Imperialists  may go in Prohibitions of Commerce we yet do not see but should they do their utmost as I said above they would do their own Subjects much more Damage than they can do us And I appeal to the Experience of the Men of Commerce for Proof of the Fact  First  Suppose a Stop of Commerce with  Flanders  that is to say with the  Imperial Netherlands  which is what some People seem to apprehend  It is true they may stop the Importation of our Woollen Manufacture thither tho' with all their Prohibitions Trade will find Vents there too as well as it has done in  France  and other Countries and 'tis presum'd the Prohibition must be as universal as the War that is to say with  Holland France  and  Great Britain  all together and how the  Flemings  will find their Account in that is for them to judge not for me  But to speak to it only as to  England  Pray who will be the greatest Sufferers in such a Prohibition  England  for want of the Vent of some Woollen Manufacture tho' indeed not very considerable which are usually sent to  Flanders  Or the  Low Countries  for want of the Sale of their  Cambricks  and fine  Brussels  and  Mecblin  Lace of both which so exceeding a Demand is made here by the Humour and Fancy of our Ladies running into the Wear and Use of those two Articles and the Price of which is of late so extravagant that the Ballance of Trade between the two Countries is evidently to the Advantage of the  Flemings  and that in a prodigious Degree So that I cannot but say a Prohibition of Commerce between them would be at this Time one of the kindest Things the Emperor could do for us and we shall have no Reason to be sorry or anxious about it whenever it begins Our only Business at least I think so would be whenever they make the Prohibition on their Side to take care it be duly Executed on our Side  There is but one Part of the World more where the Emperor can make any considerable Prohibition of Commerce with us by Sea and that is in  Italy  and I am perswaded his Council if they are Men of Common Understanding in Business will never advise his Imperial Majesty to take such a Step Let us examine the Particulars briefly  This Prohibition can only extend to the Ports of the Kingdom of  Naples  in the West and South Side of  Italy  and the Ports of  Messina Palermo  c in  Sicily  In return for which he first of all stops the  English  taking off the Oil of  Gallipoli  and then the Thrown Silk of  Naples  and  Sicily  and at the same Time as he has not Power to prohibit the  English  Commerce at  Leghorn  the Manufacture of  Great Britain  will be only carried thither instead of being carried to  Messina  and  Naples  and the Merchants will send thither to buy them for we are assur'd they must and will have them  In a Word  Great Britain  laughs at their Prohibitions Nor can the War with which they threaten us be any way fatal to our Trade no not in any one Place  I might say something here to the Stop this War might seem to give to the Vent of  English  Manufactures in the  Spanish WestIndies  But if I should say on the other Hand that the  Spaniards  seem really not to know what they are doing in that Particular and that it is more likely if they don't consider it in time that  England  may open a Door there to the Commerce which it may never be in the  Spaniards  Power to shut up and that a direct Trade from  England  to  New Spain  may be a full Satisfaction to us for all their other Attempts upon our Trade that they either have made or can make to our Prejudice I should say nothing but what I could very effectually explain  As to their Menacing us with the Pretender the Damage to Trade being my present Subject I shall say little to it here It is so remote from them as well as from us they are so little able to do any thing in it and the Creature himself has so little in him to make him Formidable that I think it hardly worth naming  Yet one Thing I cannot but observe in this otherwise insignificant Thing call'd the Pretender  viz  That as it was in the Time of one of the greatest  English  Monarchs who ever wore the Crown I mean  Henry  VII that his Enemies whenever they had a Mind to make him uneasy always play'd one Impostor or other upon him such as  Simnel Perkin Warbeck  and the like so they would do now  Thus whenever any Foreign Power designs to raise Distractions among us and to Insult the King of  Great Britain  in any Quarter whatever they will always play the Pretender upon us If the King of  Spain  has the least View of Resentment depending against  England  presently the late Duke of  Ormond  comes to Court and has an Audience of his Catholick Majesty And the late Earl Marischal a  Scots  Refugee and who it seems is in Commission under the King of  Spain  is ordered to set aside his Journey to  Andalusia  and the like as if by these remove Motions  Great Britain  was to be Alarmed and that it was to be understood that something was doing or contriving to be done on that Side in Favour of that despicable Interest call'd Jacobitism  I remember we read in the Story of  Henry  VII That when that first Imposture was Que  ed and Si  who  was play'd upon that Prince as a Pretender fell into his Hand instead of putting him to Death as Justice indeed demanded the King to let his Enemies see how he contemned the Attempt took the poor miserable Thing and set him in the Royal Kitchin to turn the Spit and lick the Trenchers despising thereby not the Person only but the Party  The Inference I think is just  England  has so little to fear from the Pretender or from the Nest of Pretenders now in  Italy  for it seems there is a new Succession of Pretenders in the Hands of the Pope and his Priests I say  England  has so little to fear from them that the greatest Contempt is to be put upon all these little Motions and they ought to give us no other Alarm than only to take care to keep Jacobitism down at home to keep them in the same State of Mortification and Humiliation that they are already in and then not to fear their Agents from abroad  In a word it seems to be the Cafe as I have already said in  Spain  now tho' Jacobitism is not so inconsiderable as not to be worth our setting our Foot upon it yet 'tis far from being so considerable as to make us afraid of it No Thief is so inconsiderable as that we need not shut our Doors and bar our Windows when we go to Bed to keep them out but all the Thieves in the Nation are not so considerable but that when we have fastened our Doors and the Watch is set we can sleep in quiet and defy them  Again I must say it is a Piece of Kindness to the Jacobites themselves who as they are a Deluded and Imposed upon People call for some Pity from even the Government which they offend and the kindest thing the Government of  GreatBritain  can do for them is to take away all their Hopes foreclose their Expectations and show them how impossible the Resurrection of their Party is under the present Dispositions and how effectually every BackDoor is barred up against them that so their Hopes being entirely destroyed they may learn to despair and no more precipitate themselves into certain Ruin in attempting to revive a Cause that is not to be revived  Besides it is worth their while to reflect upon what Foot it is that these Foreign People bring their lost Cause into the Question  namely  for nothing but to play it upon the Nation if possible in the Nature of a Diversion or to give an Alarm reserving it always in  Petto  to give it up whenever they are reduc'd to the Necessity of making a Peace and that even  the greatest Prince that ever espoused them sacrificed their whole Interest when he found it needful to make a Peace at their Expence  I had purposed here to have enter'd into a useful and a serious Discourse concerning the Expedition to  Porto Belo  and the Posting the  British  Squadron under Admiral  Hosier  at the Islands call'd  Les Bastimento's  on the Coast of the  Ist  mus  of  America  and to have given a like Plan of the Situation of those Islands as I have here of  Gibraltar  and how they respect the Harbour of  Porto Belo  But as this would require also that I should consider the great Advantages which lye before us in a formal and further Prosecution of that Attempt and how  GreatBritain  in the carrying on this War may give a new Turn to the Commerce of that Part of the World infinitely to the Advantage of these Islands and yet without giving Umbrage to the Allies by making any Attempts to seize upon the Country it self and that I purpose to handle that Subject by it self as soon as the publick Affairs discover themselves so as to make it acceptable for that Reason and also because I have not room to speak effectually to it here I refer it to another Occasion  FINIS
