 A Fifth ESSAY At Removing  National Prejudices  WITH A REPLY TO  Some AUTHORS  Who have Printed their Objections against An Union with  England  Printed in the Year MDCVII  The PREFACE  I Confess the Occasions of my appearing in Print again upon this Subject are unexpected and as the writing a  Fifth Essay  is Contrary to my real Design and more so to my Inclination I cannot but say something by way of Introduction to it  The Management of this present Treaty I mean without Doors has something in it peculiarly odd and to me very surprizing Reason and Argument nay even Demonstration cannot reach it Men will argue against nay Banter and be Witty upon the several Branches yet at the end of the Discourse profess They do not Understand themThey will be silenc't and yet not at all Convinc't they wont believe when they cannot reply when they own they gain by it they are not pleased when they fancy they are Losers they are fond of Complaining and when they can't make it out rail on those that Endeavour to Confute them  Words can have no Effect on such Persons no Argument can touch them either they Can't or Won't Understand any thing but what they like Bitterness possesses their Souls and breaks out too much at their Tongues and I  must tell them I think I bear more than my Share of this from them too and that without Cause  'Tis hard Gentlemen that an Attempt calmly to remove Prejudices and I am sure I have done it both Calmly and Cautiously should fill any Body with Prejudices at the Author  Scotland  has been in some Reputation for Courtesy to Strangers I should be very sorry you should break in upon that part of your Character only with a Reconciler An Attempt to remove Prejudices can have nothing in it unless that the Truths spoken move the Spleen of some who would not be reconciled and therefore cannot bear the Demonstration  Nor would I be mistaken here I am far from being Concern'd at the Ribauldry of the Street calling my Name about to every Ballad making me the Author of Papers I never saw when Gentlemen lampoon one another calling it mine and the like this is an old Method taken with me and I am used to it  My Muse must be the Whore of Poetry  And all  Apollo  's Bastards laid to me  The Gentlemen are wellcome and the Mob of Writers by all their Witticisms shall only provoke me to Silence I remember and I wish some other Gentlemen here would take the hint as I doMy Lord  Rochester  advising  My Lordnot to reply to Satyr and Lampoon has these two Merry Lines  Fellows that ne'er were Heard or read of  If thou writ'st on will write thy head off  Others I am told are furnishing themselves with Scandal and Design to answer my Arguments with Personal Reflection  I thank GOD my Life however mixt with Misfortunes has not been such that I am asham'd to see it in Print Nor shall I offer any Capitulations with such Gentlemen only intreat them for their own Sakes to say nothing but what is trueand then to add at the Bottom of their Story what mighty Signification it has to the Argument in hand  When our Saviour had healed the Man born blind and he appearing before the Elders answered them with a Testimony to the Divinity of the Healer which they could not reply to  viz  That he must be GOD since nothing of a Man could ha' wrought such a CureTo answer the Conviction of his Reasoning they fall upon the Poor Man  Thou wer't altogether born in sin and doest thon teach usand they Cast him Out  and yet after all what the Poor Man said was very true  Now Gentlemen if what I say be true why will you not hear it if not true why will ye not answer it  Let the Author be never so Despicable or Mean in your Eyes he is in no Man's meaner than in his Own but Truth in the meanest Hand deserves your Regard Accept the Truth and use the Author as you like he is perfectly unconcern'd about that  But all this does not yet reach the Matter which I Complain of But I think it hardest when Gentlemen who pretend to answer what pinches them in Fact Charge me with Falsities wrong representing things the like to make it out give their own Assertions only without the least Proof either to make Good their own or Detect mine  When Gentlemen reflect on what I have wrote as not true and use me ill on that head at the same time contradicting it with nothing but what is manifestly false imposing upon the World their own Affirmative without Proof against Arguments which are and can be prov'd by Undoubted and undeniable Authority this I must own is using a Stranger very ill  I shall give but two or three Instances of this here and shall meet with the rest as I go    st  Here's a Gentleman tells me in Print That the small Beer in  England  does pay more than  sh    d per  Barrel if sold for above  sh per  Barrel that the Foreign Salt payes  sh per  Busbel Custom that there are Duties Restrictions on the Export of the  English  Woollen Manufacture and the like And this the Gentleman calls a Confuting my Fourth Essay  Now as this wants but a short Answer so that Answer will detect the Gentleman's Ignorance  first  and  then  his forwardness of Charging me vvithout Proof  'Tis true the Act of Parliament in  England  prescribes the Excise to only tvvo Denominations of Beer Small and Strong and that the Small Beer is strictly call'd  sh  Beer and I suppose in Charity to him that he looked no further than the Letter of the Act  But if he thinks fit to examine the Practice in  England  and the Nature of the thing he will find three things  That there is no Small Beer sold in  England  at Shillings  per  Barrel  That the Houshold Beer sold in  London  and Parts adjacent at  sh per  Barrel and some at  sh per  Barrel pays no more Excise than as Small Beer  viz    sh    d per  Barrel and of this I can bring him several Witnesses of People of both Nations now here  That by the Nature of the Act it can be no otherwise since the Act does not say all Beer above ss shall pay as Strong Beer but the word Strong Beer is governed by the Usage of Excise and is all sold as Ale from  sh per  Barrel to above  sh  If it is  asked  me Why the Act calls it  sh  Beer I  answer  Because that Act having been made above Year ago the Small Beer in those days was sold at that price and this Excise being but in two Heads or Denominations  as before the Term needed no Alteration tho' the price of Sale was risen since it follow'd by the Name of Small Beer that nothing could pay as Strong that had not the first Runnings of the Malt  I need enlarge no further to prove the justice of my Calculation or the unfairness of being Charg'd here with Imposing on the World  The  second  Case is in the same Gentleman's Paper who tells me the Duty on Foreign Salt is ss  per  Bushel and to insult me the more adds That 'tis  by them that know it as well as I  Now as this showes the Gentleman's Heat to run before his Discretion I must tell him there can be no just Comparison between any Man's Knowledge here since the Acts of Parl are plain in which the Taxes upon Salt are settled and that there may be no Dispute on the Difference of Measure the Bushel is Determined to weigh  l  weight  Avoir du pois  and if he pleases to search the said Acts and the  English  Book of Rates he will find the Duty stands thus  By the Act and  Will  and  Mary  Cap    d per  Gallon on Foreign Salt  and  William  III Cap  the Duty Continued  and  William  III Cap    d per  Gallon Added       d per  Gallon    d per  Gallon Gallon to the Bushel is  d  or sh  per  Bushel The Subsidies and Impost formerly laid amount to  d  ⅝  per  Bushel  ⅝  ⅝ or thereabout  Either I am Right or wrong if wrong let the Acts of Parliament decide that Controversy if I am Rightthen this Gentleman and his Author who he says  knows it as well as I  have something more to account for to the world than an homest Man cares to be charg'd with and if I had used him so I would frankly ask his Pardon  As to the Duties and Restrictions on the Woollen Manufacture in  England  on Export the Minute of Parliament has answered and confuted it for meI need say nothing in my own Vindication after such an Authority only recommend it to the Gentleman himself to consider whether he has used either me or his Country honestly  A Fifth ESSAY  c  IN the last Essay I went thro' a great many Branches of the Popular Objections raised in  Scotland  against the UnionI wish I could exactly distinguish between those that Men raise only to oppose the Thing in General and prevent the Uniting the Nations  on any Terms whatever  and those which are really offered from honest Scruple at the Particulars  However whether I can distinguish them in their Arguments or no I shall distinguish them as well as I can in the following Discourse in which I shall have all due regard to honest Reasoning and fair Argument but not so much to Cavil and Frivolous or Malicious Opposition  I little thought it had been possible that any  Scotsman  at least such as understand the Affairs here could say That  Scotland  does not gain by  England  in Trade much less that you do or can Trade abroad with equal Advantages to other Nations  I could not imagine any Man would offer that it is your Advantage to Trade with  France  where you bring back nothing but what drains you of Money and send little thither but what you ought to keep at Home  Less was it to be expected that Men should publish in Print that your Trade will be ruin'd by an Union with  England  Wherefore to all these Heads I shall say something as plain and Concise as I can if possible to remove the Prejudices which are form'd in the Heads of the Ignorant as if on Purpose to set them in the light of your future Advantages  But before I come to this I must say a Word or two to a mighty Champion that has undertaken from my own Writing in another Case to overthrow the very Foundation of the present Treaty and setting  D F  against  D F  Demonstrates as he thinks that the Parliament of  Scotland  has no Power to enter upon this Treaty nor go on with it without the Consent of their Constituents that Choose them  And to do this he Quotes a long Part of a Book wrote some time since in  England  Entitled  The Original Right of the Collective Body of the People of  England  Vindicated and Asserted  in Answer to Sir  Humphra Mackworth  's Book Called  A Vindication of the Commons of  England  c  In this Book I lay down Four Maxims of Government which this Gentleman Quotes at large  Now 'tis so strange a thing notwithstanding all this That these Gentlemen should bring this Quotation to prove the want of Power in the present Parliament of  Scotland  to enter upon the Ʋnion that I must own I never saw any thing fetcht so remote in Argument in my Life  If any Man therefore please but to Examine two things he will see thro' all this Cloud of Cavil and soon distinguish the Case  All that this long Quotation amounts to is sum'd up in this That ail Government being constituted for the Publick Good all the Parts of Government Ceasing to Act for the Publick Good cease from the same Publick Capacity in which they were Constituted the end of their Authority being Destroyed  This only then leads us to Examine whether the present Parliament of  Scotland  are Acting for the Publick Good or no and I shall be very glad to join Issue with any Body on that Head  The other Case quoted refers to Parliaments  making Laws against Reason Nature or the Divine Law  And had the Author here quoted me fairly he would have gone on and show'd an Instance I gave to explain the rest  Viz If the People of  England  find their Representatives going about to betray the Religion and Liberties of their Country  what the said People  by the Laws of Reason Nature and Religion ought to do  And to Illustrate this I gave Instances of the Parliament in  England  alternately Reestablishing to Day Popery to Morrow the Protestant Religion to Day one King to Morrow another to Day declaring Queen  Mary  Legitimate and Queen  Elisabeth  a Bastard to Morrow Queen  Elisabeth  a Legitimate and Queen  Mary  a Bastard and from thence I argued to the Subversion of Justice and Corruption of the Laws in these Cases I think all I have advanced there very Just and Plain and I never yet heard it objected against  But with Submission to this Gentleman's Understanding all this proves nothing in the Case before us unless it be also made appear That the Parliament of  Scotland  is acting something against the Laws of God Nature or Reason subverting the Laws Corrupting Justice Oppressing the People whom they should protect and betraying the Trust reposed in them by their Country and thus we are just where we were before  Indeed the Drift of my Author appearing plainly at last to Declare it self for a League with  France  and consequently a Restoring some body who  this Nation I believe had much  better be without  it requires no further Reply than this and therefore I leave it  I frankly own the Positions this Person Quotes  viz Of the People collectively considered having a Right to oppose any constituted Body of Government Suppressing and Betraying their Fundamental Right  But I do not see any thing infer'd from hence unless it be first proved That the Treaty now on foot  is a Betraying the Fundamentals of their Country Overthrowing and Subverting the Laws Perverting and Corrupting Justice and a General Enslaving the People  Much I know has been Talkt of to prove these things but with so little Reason and on such Weak Fundations that I think I need say no more to it till Mr  Hs  or some Body for him Refutes  The Scheme of the National Right of Parliament asserted in the last Tract  Wherein I have to the best of my Judgment Described it and shall willingly Recant it when I find it not able to consist with Justice and Reason  But before I dismiss this Article and that I may give this Gentleman full scope for his Argument I offer to prove That tho' the Fundation he lays down were Just  which 'tis plain is otherwise  yet the Inference would not hold in this Case  For Example suppose which yet I by no means grant That the People who are the Constituents of Parliament were so far Judges of the actions of Parliament as to have a Right to give them Instructions and as a Worthy Author has it among the rest of his wise Sayings to Address the Parliament  COMMANDING them not to proceed  c  Two things must necessarily follow upon this most Important Supposition  That these People so Limiting the Parliament must be such  and only such  as have a Right of Election for they only can Direct their Representatives who have a  Right to be Represented and they only have a Right to be Represented who have a Voice in the Election of a Representative  Thus there are all your  Glasgow  Armies Disbanded and turn'd Rebels at once and all your  Dumfries  Protestors with their Troops of Horse and Armies of Foot such only excepted as have a Right to Vote in an Election  Of those who have a Right of Voting in Election the Right of Contraveening the Actions of the Members must depend at least on the Majority of them  some are of the Opinion  it must have every Individual in an Action of such moment But this is certain it must have a Majority and this Majority must include the Nobility too who are not Represented but sit in Person and how shall it appear that this Majority are in the Persons now Addressing  Let us Examine the Probability of it for a certain Examination  I  believe impracticable now but as to Probability when shall we see it  Some of the Addresses have been Signed by some hands only to assist in the Clamour Are these the Majority of the Electors in the Shires or Towns some have more but 'tis where the Proportion is much greater  Let us take it in the Address of the Burghs which has been often calculated and take the Burghs that refused to Address and these that did not think it worth while to appear and the Majority against the Addressers is by the Proportion of  their Cess  as to Nay suppose all those that did not appear to be Affirmatives tho' that be altogether improbable and that they would have been for the Address yet the Proportion had been as to  But if  the Rate of the Cess  be not a just Estimate of the Value of the Burghs  tho I can prove it was the Original of their  Right of being Burghs  then I refer to any Man to calculate the Inhabitants and Number of Freemen in each Burgh and he will find the Burghs that refused to address have more Inhabitants in them than both the that address'd and the that were absent the City of  Edinburgh  excepted  And where now is the Majority and how shall a Parliament regulate themselves by this Method For here a Majority of the Shires  suppose it was so  addrest against the Union and a Majority of the Burghs are for it now take the Minor Part of the Freeholders and the Major Part of the Burroughs and draw a just Proportion of Members in the House I mean of Representatives and add these to the great Number of the Lords who are for the Union and who are not represented at all and I dare say the Majority would appear for the Union  To take it another way divide the Freeholders in  Scotland  and place the Numbers of either the Representing or the Represented by the Value of their Estates for the Original of all depends upon the Freehold I dare say including the Nobility two Thirds of the Freehold of  Scotland  belong to such as are for the Union  I care not to enter into Inviduous Comparisons  as the more exact Calculating such things as these must necessarily come to  I leave it to those that please to examine further into the Majority I am perswaded if these People will have the Majority of the Freeholders of  Scotland  be against the Union they must  as Mr  Hodges  does  draw the Ladies into the Party and if they are against it  as some say  the Reasons they give are too light for this Discourse  I think this Estimate of probable Majorities as just as may support my Arguments I'll submit them to any Man that can confute them  As to all the rest of the People of  Scotland  who have no Right to elect Representatives  I affirm  and think the nature of the thing demonstrates it They can have no Right to direct those who they have no part in constituting  And here all the People drawn in to sign Addresses to the Parliament against the Union so far as the Members are to be bound by these Addresses are meddling with what they have no Right to be meddling with nor are any way concerned in  But besides all this  suppose SOME RIGHT of limiting the Proceedings of Parliament by their Constituents  and the Majority in one Place addresses them against an Union and the Majority of other Places addressed for it or acquiesced which is the same thing What Confusions what intolerable Exigencies and Labyrinths must this run the Parliament into and when should any thing be resolved which tho of never so great Concern had so much Difficulty in it  I leave this here with this short Remark on it That I do not see  tho the Constituent had Power to restrain the House  that by any Estimate which can be yet made a Majority has yet appear'd willing to do so if there was a Majority it does not appear they had a Right to do it unless what the Parliament was doing was in it self destructive of the Laws Liberties Religion or Property of the People or subverting their Essential Privileges and therefore hitherto the Parliament have been Regular in their Proceedings and Wiser than to regard the Clamours of Tumultuous People not qualified to interrupt them  The further Designs of this Author discovers the more naked part of the Design  viz  Uniting or at least Confederating with Popish and  French  TyrannyAnd I cannot but observe here how those People are pleasing themselves with that small Advantage of Trade to  France  and magnifying  them to unusual Hights  tho 'tis plain the Returns from thence are all to your Dammage in general  and at the same time the Trade to  England  the Returns of which now are chiefly in Money and after the Union must be more so are disparag'd lessen'd and reduced to nothing  The Author of this Book is honest in this whatever he is in other things and owns his Drift is a Treaty not with  England  but with  France  I should have entred further into his Disputes of the much better Treaty with  France  than  England  if I had not been happily prevented by a Book which appears just while I am writing this entitled  The Advantages of  Scotland  by an Incorporate Ʋnion c  In which he is so fairly confuted and the Argument handled so clearly that it would be an Injustice to the Gentleman that wrote it tho I know not who he is not to acknowledge that he has done his Country Justice and the Argument too and I believe will not be replyed to in haste  After what has been there said I shall not so much as think my self able to say any thing fit to be added and shall always let the World see that whether I know when to speak or no I always know when to hold my Tongue  But I cannot quit this Discourse without drawing one Inference from all these things  viz  That in all these Debates and however different the Opinions of some People are from others in that matter of the Union  I  know not by what concurrence of Causes it happens but this seems to be the general Concession of all the contending Parties  viz  That  Scotland  is not in a condition to Subsist or at least to Flourish by Her selfThat She seems under some necessity to Unite or Confederate some whereAnd so the Debate is not whether She shall Unite with some body or no but whether She shall Unite with this or that with  England France Holland  or who  If I were a  Scots  Man or if you could bear with Plainness and Truth from a Stranger that strives to speak impartial Truth and has not one Shilling to gain or lose let it go which way it willI would ask some of these Gentlemen Whether they have considered their National Circumstances as to  England  and examin'd not how they could break with  England  For I am not a going to insult  Scotland  But in what Posture as to Trade  Scotland  would be upon an universal Prohibition between  England Ireland  and  Scotland  'Tis true there is a kind of Prohibition already as to  England  You have prohibited almost all the Manufactures and take nothing from them you can well be withoutBut they have not yet treated you so they have not return'd you  in kind  I would ask these Gentlemen How they would look and in what Condition as to Trade and ready Money  Scotland  would be if there were equal Prohibitions and an universal Stop of Trade between the Nations that neither your Cattle nor Linnen was admitted there the Return of which is now wholly in Cash  Some Gentlemen have said You can do without it and perhaps you may Come Gentlemen let us examine how  Why first these Gentlemen say  France  will take off your Wool Lead Salmond and HerringWell Gentlemen and what will they give you for itWine Brandy Fruit Silk Toys and Trinkets I won't engage here with the Gentlemen and disoblige the Men of the Bottle so far as to make a Calculation of the wondrous Advantages of Wine and Brandy and how much they contribute to the Wealth of the Nation and therefore I leave that Debate only this I must say That your Import every Year exceeds your Export and if this Trade is to encrease your Wealth and People it will still encrease your Consumption and you must pay  France  the Overplus in specie and so promote the Manufacture of  Drunkenness at the Price of the Consumption of your Bullion  But then as to Wool 'tis own'd  France  will take little Wool if any of your own Growth at least not without  English  Wool with itAnd if effectual Care is taken to prevent the Export of that Wool from  England  I suppose you will find a Decay thereAnd if you oblige  France  to take your Fish and cannot supply them with Wool you must make them Amends some other way as perhaps by filling their Armies with  Scots  Troops and sending your Gentlemen into their Service So exporting your  Scots  Blood by their Gallantry and Courage help  France  to pull down the Protestant Religion and enslave  Europe  of which Bondage you must at last come in for a share  But next to this says another Gentleman we may export our Linnen to  Spain  and our Beef to the  Canaries  and  Madera  For the first so you may if you please with an Union as well as now So that whatever you gain of Export to  England  is all as clear as it was before for you may make enough for both Trades if you please and consequently employ more People in the Work more Land in the Planting and so the Trade to  Spain  is just as it was and receives no manner of Alteration  For the sending Beef to the  Canaries  c I suppose the Gentlemen that have been so forward in that Argument have never been at or have never Traded to those Islands otherwise they would not offer such odd kind of Proposals And to shorten them I discreetly would revise their Calculations and compare them with the following Circumstances and then I perswade my self they will have Honour enough to change their Sentiments  st  England  in the Year took from  Scotland  in Trade and for which they paid ready Money  Head of Black Cattel  Sheep  Over and besides the Number of both sorts which are secretly convoyed over the Borders and which is impossible the Tract of Land being so great can by any Vigilance of Officers be prevented which some say amounts to as many more but all agree are a very great Quantity  Now I would be glad to know where the Gentlemen would export this Quantity of Cattel  As to the  Canaries  and  Madera  the Inhabitants are few the Flesh they eat little and if they were to have all the Beef they buy from  Scotland  they would not take off Bullocks or Beeves a year  They have  NewEngland  and  NewYork  from whence they are supplied with Pipestaves which ly so much nearer to them and from whom they are supplied with Beef and Pork so cheap that I wonder how these Gentlemen could think of those Places to sell thirty thousand Black Cattel a year in  If they could sell those Cattel where would they sell the Returns  Madera  Wine they could not dispose of any where and of  Canary  but a small Quantity without Help of  England  and Silver is not to be had in those Islands Which way they would either make their Returns or get Loading back for their Ships is a Mystery past any Man's Understanding  But were all these Difficulties over had those Islands no Flesh from the Continent of  America  had  Scotland  a vent at home for Ships Load of  Canary  and  Modera  Wine to secure their Ships a back FreightYet at last I say they could not Sell ten Barrels of Beef a year in either  Canaries  or  Madera  And I think the Reason is plain  The  Irish  Beef is so much Better so much Cheaper and their Shipping and Sailing so much Easier that they would  be able to outsell them there reckoning Value and Price above a hundred  per Cent  Now to make this out I shall not give the Reader the trouble of Calculations only let him know that the best  Irish  Beef Large and Fat not to make Comparison has been to be had at  Kinsale Cork  or  Galloway  for under  sh per  Hundred weight for some years past that is to say for very little more than half penny  Sterling per lib  and I leave the Calcule to any Body that please to make it  While this is so I must take leave to say neither  England  or  Scotland  nay nor  NewEngland  or  New York  can come into that Trade  Then the  Irish  Selling their Beef to  English  Merchants and sending it in  English  Bottoms can carry the  Madera  Wines to the Islands or bring the  Canarie  Wines to  England  in the same Ship this the  Scots  can never come up to  without an Ʋnion  and I appeal to all the World for the Truth of Fact in this particular  Where the Gentlemen then will dispose of to of Black Cattel to Ballance the  English  Trade I know not  I Recommend this Thought to those Gentlemen who are so very warm for Drawbacks upon Beef Exported for Sale and I would be glad they would tell us to what place of the World the whole Island of  Britain  sends Last of Beef in Seven Year for Sale and if so why they will Clog the Treaty with such Demands  I come next to the Linnen You have in the Publick account of the Exports of Linnen to  England  and other parts above Ells of Linnen carried out of  Scotland  in one year  This may be all sent to  Spain they say  suppose that were true  tho' as to quantity I question it  yet since the  English  as every body knows have sent none of this to  Spain  the War having Stopt that Trade then if the  Scots  can send so much to  Spain  they yet lose the Sale of so much more in  England  So that here is above Ells of Linnen Black Cattle and Sheep left on your hands by rejecting the  English  Trade and all the ready Money they bring with them now kept out of the Kingdom upon a breach with  England  I would be glad to see these Gentlemen offer some of their Equivalents for this for an Equivalent  as much as they banter that poor Word  must be had some where or else it will be worseAbove all I wait for their  French  Equivalent and the account of the Return they would make from  France  for their Fish Lead and WoolI suppose they will not expect to send Linnen to  France    While I am Writing this I am presented with a Book Intitled  A Letter concerning the Consequences of an Incorporating Ʋnion in relation to Trade  I  confess it is a wonderful Book partakes of the rest of the Miracles of this Age wherein Arguments are raised out of contradicting Systems to Prove and Disprove what Men please I must own  I  think the Author of this Book seems to be in a Plot for the Union and that by laying down Arguments that even the Gentlemen who have Declared against the Union have too much Sense than to make use of he would confound the Debate with Absurdities and Contradictions and argue People into it by showing them a heap of Ridiculous Arguments against it  I can not satisfie my self to waste either my own time or the Reader's with entering into his manifold weighty Reasons but I'll repeat a few of them  He tells us That all Trade is Exchanging one Commodity for another for the Convenience of Life and the supplying Nations with what their Neighbours have which they want  In prosecuting this he is merry on the  English  Trade and thinks he banters those who say 'tis Advantageous to  Scotland  since says he we shall only get one Commodity for another  Without running his length I shall bring it to a short head His notion of Trade by Exchanges is Right enough only that he forgot to say That where any Nation has more want of Foreign Goods than She has Goods of her own to purchase them with She must make up the Value in Money  On this turns the whole State of the Question and the Gentleman was in the right to forget it for it would have overthrown all his System  Money is an Intrinsick plac'd as a Medium in the Center of Trade to supply the differences in Value between the Export and Import of one Nation to and from another  This is what we call Ballance of Trade a thing many People talk of tho' few understand  That Nation only can be said to Gain by another who send more Value in its own Product to that other Nation than is receiv'd from it because the Ballance must be made good in this Intrinsick called  Specie  From hence 'tis a certain Maxim in Trade That what ever any Country can part with of its own Growth and Product is so much clear Gain to the publick Stock of that Nation  Whatever any Nation wants of the Growth and Product of another Nation is so much Dead Loss to the Public Stock of that Nation  And the Consequence is Natural that which a Nation partswith or wants most in those Terms Gains or Loses just so much in the General Ballance of Trade  These are things too plain to need Repetition and had not this Gentleman forgot this whether wilfully or no I do not determine he would have never said at first  That  Scotland  does not want the  English  Money  c I say every Nation wants to Export all the Product of their Country they can spare and all the Product of their Peoples Labour they can spare  and every Nation wants their Neighbours Money for their Product because every Nation wants  in the Language of Trade  to be Gainers  And therefore to Export the People instead of the Labour of the People is by the way letting out the LifeBlood of a Nation but of that by it self  It remains therefore for this Gentleman to tell us on a fair Examination not whether you want the  English  Trade or no now or after the Ʋnion but whether you gain Money by it or no let any one tell me whether you Gain by it or no I'll tell him whether you want it or no  To find out this I shall come to his own worthy Argument  Pag    'We shall Import into  England  says he all our Commodities as to the Word  free of Duttes  I ll speak to it by it self  But he goes on  We send Linnen Cloth into  England  What shall we get in return Why Woollen Cloth or what else the Persons that sell the Linnen think they can get most by at Home  And from hence this worthy Gentleman concludes  Here can be no Gain to  Scotland  Now I'll only state the Case on a Supposition which I think no Man can deny me  Suppose  Scotland  sends Linnen Cloth to  England  to the Vaue of  per Annum  and the Persons that sell it there can sell but  l  in the Woollen returnWhat must the Merchant bring Home And how must  England  pay for the LinnenMust it not be in Money and Who is the Gainer  From hence I leave it to the Reader to Calculate  Scotland  has sent Ells of Linnen to  England  Black Cattel Sheep in one Year Pray what returns have they fetcht for this Trade not VVoollen Goods I believe any Body will  grant Who then has been the Gainer in that Year of Trade  Scotland  or  England  The Objection that this is before the Ʋnion is not to the Purpose for after the Union your Export may be Double in Coal Salt Corn and Wool your Linnen double and the like  Then it will remain to ask How is it possible  Scotland  should consume a Quantity of Woollen Goods from  England  equal to this you having both Wool and Manufactures of your own proportioned 'tis impracticable and where then all the rest of your Export must be supplyed is another of this Author's Ʋnaccountables  But says he It is pretended  Scotland  must Export the  English  Goods again to the Plantations This makes Good what I said before That he offers this to Banter the Opposers of the Ʋnion and bring them in talking ridiculously on purpose to expose them  For no Body ever but himself pretended that  Scotland  should Trade to the Colonies with  English  Goods that were to make it a Trade and no Trade to them turn them into meer Pedlars or Secondhand Chapmen and to put a Banter upon the Colonies to think they should send to  Scotland  for  English  Manufacture when at the same time they Trade to  England  directly  And why pray cannot  Scotland  Trade to the Colonies with her own Product and the Labour of her own People Her Linnens her low priz'd Woollens are as vendible and as much wanted there as any  English  Goods what ever and she wants no quantity  Her Returns for these are  First  The imployment of her Shipping and Seamen  Secondly  The Product of the Plantations which she now buys in  England  and bringing which  from the Colonies will encrease the Ballance between  England  and  Scotland  still higher  But says the Author You cannot dispose of the Sugars and Tobacco and if you send them Abroad you get nothing but Linnen from  Holland  or Lace from  Flanders  or Naval Stores from the EastVery good Do you want these things or no If you do not you wont Import them if you do you will Import them and unless you can pay for them in Goods you must in Money So that still the Advantage of Exporting your Tobacco and Sugar is equal to Exporting your own Product because it either returns you directly in Money or saves you sending your own Money abroad which is letting the Nation blood in the Vitals  Thus with Submission to this Gentleman bringing things back to first Principles will unravel all this Clue of Knotty Argument and if I Mistake not will discover the Nakedness of it more than sufficiently to the World  The same Author to Answer an Objection of the  Scots  Working Cheaper than the  English  has this further Deep Consideration That either the  English  must come down to our low Wages or the  Scots  must come up to their high Wages and therefore the  Scots  Manufactures cannot be Cheaper than the  English  Now to make this out I desire he would be pleased then to reconcile the following Heads to his Maxim That  Scotland  shall not get by the Trade  First  He says The Workmen will certainly Live where they can get most for their Labour  That I grant him readily  Now If the  English  should be forced to be brought down to the low Wages in  Scotland  it must be that they see the  Scots  fall so heartily into their Manufactures Ʋndersel and  and Underwork them that if they do not sink the Price too they shall lose their Trade Or  Secondly  If the  Scots  come up to the high Wages of  England  the poor People will live here as well as they do in  England  and the Trade will be in Proportion Greater and I will be Content to hear which of these Consequences will be a Damnage to  Scotland  But now Gentlemen more Wonders are arriv'd and the Strangeness to me is very Great I Confess except that 'tis true that Miracles are not Ceased and this is very Particular  First  He says and introduces it with an  I AFFIRM  the  Scots  can be no Gainers by the Freedom of their Trade to the Plantations Nay if the  English  would give the  Scots  all their Plantations they would be no Advantage to them  Secondly  The  English  gain nothing by the Plantations themselves nor have they been ever any Gain to them  This wretched Stuff is follow'd by another That bringing home Naval Stores can be no Advantage to you because building or imploying Ships will be no Advantage only Dispeopleing your Country  I need but name these things to the World they are certainly done to Banter the Case the Man is certainly pleading for the Union it cannot be otherwise  But mark the Foundation on which all this is Built is  England  gains by no Foreign Trade only gains by her Manufactures  And how could we Gain by our Manufactures if there was not a Foreign Trade to Vent them  But we Gain nothing but what is returned in unperishable CommoditiesAllow that nowWhy then we have  Gain'd all the ready Money in  England  all the Plate all the Bullion all the Iron Brass Steel or Mettals imported  All the Moveable Stock of the Nation is clear Gain to it be it in Ships Buildings Furniture Stores Wares  c  How have they Gain'd all this it must be by Trade and the Personal Estates in  England  such as Houses Ships Goods Cattel Plate Jewels Money  c  are computed at much more than the Value of the Fee simple of all the Land at Years Purchase  But I'll tyre you no more with this Miserable Stuff pray Gentlemen pardon me the Freedom I take with this Author and do not think I imagine  Scotland  can be capable of such Nonsence I am very well assured this is another  English  Author and that this Book came from  England  it tastes both of the Spirit the Temper and Ʋnderstanding of some Gentlemen there who set up to Instruct you here in what you know better than they  But now Gentlemen to come Home to your own Trade with  England  either as it is or as it may be with or without an Ʋnion  If an Ʋnion go on 'tis alledg'd you shall have higher Customs than you have nowTo this the Resolution of your Committee is a full Reply in which they tell you how all the Customs of  England  which shall expire at being deducted your Customs Rated on the present Export and Import of  Scotland  shall be less than they are now by  l Scots per Annum  besides upwards of  l Scots  taken off from your Manufactures when Exported to  England  This I think has in a manner silenc'd the Gentlemen that throng'd the Town with their Calculs of Customs rising upon you as something else has done about the Repayment of the Equivalent  The Trade lying thus let me state it two ways  'Tis evident by the Report of the Persons employ'd by the Government to calculate this that your Exports to  England  now without an Union amount to lib Sterling  per Annum  No Man has yet ventur'd to say That you make any Returns from thence that bear a Proportion to thisall their Manufactures being prohibit But because I would give all reasonable Allowance I am content to suppose that you receive from  England  in Goods li  per Annum  I'll suppose that the Noblemen and Gentlemen of  Scotland  in their Expenses and the Fine Things they buy there spend lib more tho both these Sums exceedingly outdo the Probability of the thing  But this being allowed then 'tis yet true that  Scotland  gets lib  per Annum  in Money from  England  by Trade how she would make her self Amends for that Loss by a Trade to  France  I can see no room to find out And for a Trade to  Spain  She has it with the Trade to  England  and may enlarge it as she thinks fit and  England  will help not hinder Her to enlarge it  If then you get lib  per Annum  by  England  'tis a good Trade without an Union Let's now examine if the Union will make it greater or less and upon this the whole State of the Case will turn  First  We are told here that after the Union the  English  Woollen Manufactures will throng in upon  Scotland  And tho' I think 'tis your own Fault if you do not make all the same you do now and both better and cheaper yet for discourse sake suppose you to buy the  English  Woollen Goods pray what Goods shall you send to  England  then more than you do now  If then after the Union you shall send more Goods to  England  over and above the Quantity you now send than you  shall receive from thence over and above what you now receive you are still more Gainers than you were before  And first I am to suppose that all the Import of Tobacco Sugar Ginger Dye stuffs c which come from the  WestIndies  shall be taken off from the Debit of your Import from  England  since either you will have them directly from thence and in return for your own Manufactures and Money to boot or you must be much weaker in your pursuing your own Advantages than I take ye to he  If you imported lib  per Annum  in Goods from  England  I believe a full half of that Sum is made up by those kinds of Goods with which we are supplied from  England  To encrease this Trade to  England  I come to ask a few Questions which I would be glad to hear any Body answer  How many Coals shall go away yearly from the Firth of  Edinburgh  to  England  when  sh  and  d  Duty is taken off by the Union and they as cheap here as at  NewCastle  and sh  per  Chalder always above them at  London  I assure you when I have said it shall amount to Chalder I have been blam'd as not guessing above half the Quantity  How many Weigh of Salt of which some say Wey I am content to say half that Quantity and I dare say it shall not fall short of that  VVhat Quantity of Corn shall go to  England  yearly especially that we call  HorseCorn  such as  Oats Beans  and  Pease  which always yield a good Price at  London  and much more than in  Scotland  If this Article does not amount to  l per Annum  more  then I have no guess at what  Scotland  can part with of those Sorts  for I am free to say If they will send them to  England  they will always buy them there and at a good Price    The Wool  and now we come to a great  Question  What Amends will be made to  Scotland  for the loss of the Wool Trade and the difference of Price between the Wool after the Prohibition and what it is now when we Export it Abroad  To this I Answer  Sinking the Price indeed is the Immediate Consequence but the present Exporting it has several attending Circumstances which I conceive are not sufficiently considered by those who are so angry at this head  The present Price of Wool for which the  SheepMasters  claim a Satisfaction is not an Original the first Exporting the Wool  Raised it  and stopping that Export is only Checking the Exorbitant Gain they make now at the Price of their Country's Ruin and bringing them back  where they were before  'Tis a Trade Destructive to Industry Ruinous to Manufactures and tends to Robbing the Poor of their Imployment as is evident in your Exporting it to the  Baltick  and the North where if they had not  your Wool  they must Buy  your course Manufactures  and certainly Buy the less of the one by how much the more they get of the other  If you will not work your Wool at home tho' that is certainly your Advantage especially when you may then have  English  Wool freely to mix with itStill you may send it all to  England  who  opens their Doors  to all the Wool the whole World thinks fit to send them  If it be Objected they will not give the Price you get for it Abroad  I Answer  They will give what you had better take than the Foreign Price and what you shall get as much by  Suppose I have Packs of Wool at  Edinburgh  Packs I'll send to  France  or to  Sweden or where you like  and for that I'll get  s per  Stone I send to  England  and for that I get  but  s per  Stone yet I say I had better send to  England  than Abroad  For Example  First I run the Risque of the Sea  Onward  bound next the Risque of Factors and Buyers  Abroad  I pay Freight and Commission Abroad The Risque  is Repeated  back again on the SeaAnd  lastly  All this at least Imploys the Stock six Months in time  If I think fit to Trade to  England  for Wool I can always Sell it and always Sell it for Ready Money and may if I please make Returns of my Money in that Months time which I take in one Voyage the other way and in doing this I run no Risque at all and have my Money in my hand every time  If it be Objected The price to the WoolMaster is low I  Answer England  will give as much for yours as for their own in proportion to its GoodnessIf yours is not so good as some of theirs it is better than others and still you have Neighbours Fair and Right Dealing  I could run out here and not Unprofitably perhaps tell you That the Badness of your Wool in  Scotland  is not owing either to the  Climate  the  Soil  the Nature of the  Grass  or any of those Circumstances the Flegmatick Fancies of some People Suggest  which some  tho' they care not to hear other Folks Mention are forward enough to mention themselves  I could take the liberty to tell these Gentlemen  and perhaps make it out too  That the Courseness of the Wool here is owing to the ill Husbandry of the People not the Inclemencies of Nature and that they are too forward to Injure their own Country and load her with the Effects of their own Inexcusable Negligence and this both in the Missusing the Sheep that breed this Wool and spoiling the Wool with Tar Grease and horrible foolish Applications to it when it is on the Sheeps back  Indeed I avoid entring on this Matter here because I am preparing an Essay upon the Improvement of  Scotland  by it self which I design for the Publick Service in this very case but this I undertake to say  before hand  with respect to the Wool That whether by better Management your VVool might be made as Good as  English I do not affirm  tho' I believe itBut certainly by your Management there the  English  VVool might be brought to be every whit as bad as yours  Negligence and ill Husbandry will Spoil the best Country in the VVorld and the best Product in the VVorld and  tho' I am not for finding Fault  yet I must own the Conduct of the Gentlemen in  Scotland  with their Sheep and  not a little with their Land too  is one of the most Unaccountable things in the VVorldAnd if I have the Honour to Dictate some Methods of Rectification in these cases to their Advantage whether they make the Experiment or no I hope no Man will be angry with me or count me an Enemy to  Scotland  for showing the way to its Improvement  But  I proceed  to the Trade of  Scotland  and I cannot but enter a little here into a short Trifle of Trade call'd The Trade to  America  or the  WestIndies  and 'tis very Remarkable and well worth Observation what pains has been taken to render this as the most Contemptible thing in the VVorld a thing not worth  England  's granting or  Scotland  's accepting much less a thing that  England  ought to Value her self upon or so much as suggest that  Scotland  is beholding to her for  One Author has the face to say England  never got any thing by the Trade of the Colonies her self and if she would give them to  Scotland  it was not a Gift  worth Receiving  nor could  Scotland  be ever the better for it  I confess these are strange things  and 'tis hard to have to do with some kind of Gentlemen in Trade who give themselves  a liberty to say what they please without being Encumbred with or any way Subjecting themselves  to the Bondage  of speaking Truth  And yet this Monstruous Story as I am told comes from  England  from whence I only draw one Inference  viz That this Ignorance is not for want of an Opportunity of knowing better  But there are some Gentlemen there who have all along carefully furnisht the Town here with something which no Man durst say but such as are  out of Sight  as to Blushing and  out of Hearing  as to Reproach  The short  Scale of the Trade  from  Scotland  to the  WestIndies  consists in these Heads which when they are right stated I shall think 'tis easy for any body to Determine whether that Trade is to be carried on to the Advantage of  Scotland  yea or no  First  What you carry out is entirely  if you please  the Product of your own Land and the Labour of your own People    What you bring home  may at least ¾ parts of it be again Exported by you to Foreign parts and the Product by consequence return to you in Money and  if the remaining  ¼  part is expended at home  'tis expended in the room of those Goods of the same kind which you now buy with your Money in  England or with your Goods at a short Advance  and which would otherwise return you Money    What Goods you carry out  to the Colonies are generally Sold there at the extravagant Advance of  per Cent  Profit on the Continent and  if for Loss on the Islands  then great quantities of Bullion are return'd home for them in the return of which the Loss is less in Proportion  All this Trade shall be carried on  in your own Ships  furnished with  your own Provisions  Built if you please  in your own Ports  and Manned with your  own Seamen  Here is Published  A Letter from some Merchants of the  Scots  Nation Residing at  London where this Trade is Estimated to  per Annum  Profit to the Traders of  Scotland  and the  Guinea  Trade to  l per Annum  I confess in the length of the particulars they  Outdo me  and it must be some time before  Scotland  can carry it on to that hightIndeed I forbear Compting the Advantages of these things because I do not affect talking of Millions and great SumsBut look into these things Gentlemen  you that are to be convinc't by Demonstrations  take them to pieces your selves see if you can avoid  Confessing the Advantages  see if such a Trade can be driven without a prodigious Gain without incredible Fluxes of Wealth to the Nation  in General  as well as to the Merchants  in particular  To say you have no Manufactures fit for the Colonies or that you must  Buy them from  England is to say you have no  no Wool no FlaxOr to say you  will not  make use of them and certainly if you will not stir you shall always be poor He that will not Eat  must be Starv'd  there is no Remedy  But why should the Gentlemen that  talk you up so high  on one hand and threaten the great Things you can do another way  talk you down so low in this  as if you were a Nation that had netheir Hands to Work Heads to Direct or Understandings to close with Advantages of Commerce and Improvement when they were put into your Hands  I allow  Scotland  is  and has been  under Discouragement both as to Foreign Trade and Manufactures  I allow  your Poor are very low and your Rich Men backward to Launch outAnd any Man that takes me in the general scope will easily see this was the Intent and Meaning of my Arguing in  England  when I wrote  the second  of these Essays and Argued that  you should be Exempted for some years from the Taxes on  Malt  and  Salt  And I cannot but think that Noble Lord  asking his Lord ship  's  Pardon for this Freedom  who quoted my Arguments on this head in Parliament will do me that Justice that they were all concluded in this very thing and had his Lordship thought fit to have quoted but one Paragraph further it would have appear'd  Essay  II  P  That  Scotland  being very low  and the Poor Unable to  pay Taxes at all should  be Exempted from the Taxes of Malt and Salt for a certain term of years  Now If I first concluded the Poor unable to bear the Burthen of the Salt and Malt Tax at all why should I argue for Limited Exemption  But on this Supposition  That by the Increase of Trade Shipping Manufactures and Labour the Increase of Wages and bettering the way of the Poor's Living would be the Consequence and then the Taxes would not be equally Burthensome as now  In this if I may be allowed to plead any Merit with  Scotland  who am a Stranger was then in  England  and yet moved earnestly for Ease and Exemption for the Poor of this Kingdom till they should be enabled to pay Taxes I think I acted a part no Man here ought to blame me for and 'tis a little hard to draw an Argument from thence that therefore  they must never be charged at all  Without doubt if Trade in  Scotland  encreases Labour will encrease if Labour encreases Wages will encrease for a Demand of Work makes a Demand of Wages of Course  So that I think there remains only to prove that there will be an Encrease of Trade I think I have perform'd that in part I shall be glad to see some other more able Hand perfect my Generals into Particulars by Schemes of Profit and Advantage  on the Returns  to  Scotland  on the Advantages of  building Ships and consequently a great  Norway  and  Baltick  Trade for Fish out and Naval Stores home again on the Number of Families employ'd at home in Building Fitting and Furnishing Ships and lastly the Nursery of Sea men and employing them in your own Ships with the Consequences of such a Trade  Were due and just Schemes of these things laid down I cannot but believe the mouths of those People would for ever be stopt who lessen and misrepresent the Advantages of Trade which  Scotland  shall obtain  It is enough however to my purpose having not room here for Particulars to have laid down this general Scheme of a profitable Trade  That Trade only can be profitable which employing their own People carries out their own Growth or Product and does not consume all the Returns but draws in the Surplus to it self in Bullion and this you do here exactly To explain this  I would be glad any Man would state me the following Voyage suppose a thousand Pound  Sterling  in  Scots  Linnen and in Woollen Goods sent to  NewEngland New York  or  Virginia  in a  Scots  Ship and is there vested in Sugars Mellasses or Tobacco at the usual Rate of Advance in those Places which is too  per Cent  sometimes much more  If these Returns come safe home to  Scotland  and being not consumed here are again exported to  Amsterdam  in a  Scots  Vessel also and at last the Effects produce lib  Sterling  clear of all Charges which is no unusual nor extraordinary thing  What Profit does  Scotland  gain by this Voyage I say  Scotland  because we are to examine the Encrease to the Publick Stock as well as to the private Merchant in the Discourse we are now upon  First  Scotland  gains  all the Profit of the Labour of the People in the Manufactures that were exported for all the Wages any Person earns in  Scotland  by his Labour over and above what his Subsistance cost him during his Labour  is clear gain to the general Stock  Secondly  Scotland  gains  all the Profit of the Labour of every Person employ'd on Board the Ship for that Voyage and of the Labour of all the Artificers Labourers c employ'd in furnishing that Ship for that Voyage  Thirdly  All the Provisions expended in the Voyage and all the Stores carried out and not brought home are clear Gain to the Stock of the Nation  Fourthly  Scotland  gains  all the Particulars of the same kinds again on the Ship that carries the Goods away to  Holland  Lastly  Scotland  gains  the Profit on the foot of the Voyage to the Merchant and Owners  So that if the Merchant here clears but lib by his Voyage the National Publick Advantage may be lib more in the Freights and Furniture of the Ship and Cargo  From hence  'tis also worth note  That if such Ships a Year went out from  Scotland  it might very well be possible that the Merchant should not get a Farthing nay might lose by the Voyage and yet the Publick National Stock be Gainer at least lib  Sterl per Annum  If any Man will  after this  tell me That  Scotland  shall get nothing by the Plantation TradeI must own he is no Man for me to talk with I must leave him to his own Delusions  I shall conclude this Essay with only one Note about the Popular Objection  That after the Union  all your Places Preferments and Offices in the Customs Excises Taxes Army  and Navy will be at the Disposal of the  English  and  Englishmen  will be put upon you in all those Cases  It is not for me to determine who shall or shall not be put into Places of Trust  in this Nation  I make no question the Government will regard the Recommendation of the Council and of Honest Men here as it does now in  England  But I would have these Gentlemen consider two or three things  Why should the Government be more partial to  England  as to Places here  than at home in their own Country  where a  Scotsman  notwithstanding the separate Posture of the Nations is as capable of Preferment as an  Englishman  and promiscously preferr'd on all Occasions  Would these Gentlemen be content to retain that Mark of Distinction between the Nations that  Scotsmen  only should be preferr'd in  Scotland  and  Englishmen  in  England  And would not  Scotland  be vastly a Loser by it while many of Her Nation are now in Places of the greatest Honour and Trust in  England  Is it any Mark of  England  's Partiality to  Scotland  much less of any Distrust of the Nation That the only three strong Places in  England  the Keys of Her Wealth of Her Trade and of Her Navy have for above years past been committed to three Natives of  Scotland  viz  Tilbury  Fort the Guard of the River  Thames  and City of  London  to Colonel  Saint Clare Sheerness  Fort the Key of  Chatam  River and Guard of the Royal Navy to Colonel  Crawford  and  Portsmouth  the greatest Fortification and Magazin on the South of  Britain  to Sir  John Gibson  Besides innumerable Gentlemen of the  Scots  Nation now in Trust in the Service Admiral  Mitchel Wishart  and Comodore  Ker  in the Navy with or Captains in the Fleet besides Lieutenant General  Steuart Murray  and  Collier  the Lord  Portmore  his Grace the Duke of  Argyle  and several others I willingly omit in the Army  These trusts Gentlemen do not favour of Partiality and are as good Arguments to Ward against the Suggestion as I think need to be made use of On the other hand there is no Question but the Merit of the  Scots  Gentlemen will alwise render them valuable and useful to  Britain  and as they have alwise had their share of Advancement in all Publick Business so there is no Question they will be more likely to obtain it now  I foresee the Debate in the Parliament will have run its length before the Printer will be pleased to let these Sheets come into the World which makes me lay by what I had prepar'd to say about the keeping up or dissolving the  Scots Caledonia  Company  I Confess 'tis my Opinion as I have said already that your Company as it was at first Establish'd could never have been of any Use to  Scotland  unless by Force you had been able to have reduc'd  Spain  to a Necessity of establishing a Trade with your Colony in  America  and all the Prospect of a Trade to  India  by the SouthSeas or any other way without the Help of  England  could never have Answer'd for want of a Mercat for Goods the  Dutch  and  French  being otherwise supplyed  But I wave entering on those things here the present Enquiry is Why must we lose our Company Why must we give up all the Privileges of the Company  If I may be allow'd without Offence to speak a little plainly here perhaps it may touch the Point nearly enough  First  Who is this WE for it is necessary to distinguish  who speaks if it be We the Company or We the Nation  If you mean We the Company the Reason is Direct you ought to part with your Company and be thankful and take your Money and say you have made a good Voyage since you recover what you had lostYou get Principal and Interest in a Case where I know several of the Members would have been content to have lost all they had paid in to have been secur'd against paying in any more  Of all People in the World these are the most Unacountable who have Stocks there and can give very little Account what other things they could ever expect but the loss of these Stocks and yet are not for parting with their Company  All such People can say is That if an Union was to come on and the Company to stand they might fill it with  English  Subscriptions and make it a Rival Company in the Trade with the  English  And what would  Scotland  Gain by that the Trade would be entirely in  England  the whole Returns there and all the Consequence would be the pleasure of ruining both Companies as would have been the certain Case with the two Companies in  England  if the plain prospect of it had not made them both Wise enough to Unite  But  dly  Let us come to the other Case We the People of  Scotland  why should We part with the Company  First  Gentlemen any wise People will part with what would be their Destruction to keep  Secondly  You cannot Unite with  England  without parting with it two Companies being Intolerable in  Britain  As to the firstan  EastIndia  Company abstracted from  your Trade to  England  would be the Destruction of all your Commerce for two Reasons  You could export nothing but your ready Money  You would import what you could neither sell in  Scotland  nor carry Abroad to any Advantage  The  First  of these needs no Explication 'tis the Complaint in  England  and a Complaint not very easily answer'd and from whence some pretend to say The  EastIndia  Trade is a Grievance to  England tho I do not say I am of that Mind neither  But I am certain of this that  Scotland  could not bear the Export of their Bullion at least not now  As to the  Second  'tis evident the Import could not be vended here And as for Foreign Markets the  Dutch  are the great Stapleand what can be imagin'd you can get by them Some Particulars indeed might be sold in  Spain  and a little at  Hamburgh  but far short of enough to support the Trade The  English  uphold their Trade by the Strength of their Home Consumpt which is a vast Gulph of Trade and the Export again is but upon Circumstances and Trifles compar'd to the Gross and  Scotland  having no Home Consumpt an  EastIndia  Trade would be ruinous to them a  WestIndia  Trade would involve them in a War and a War which I think without reflecting at all upon  Scotland  She is very unfit to carry on having no Naval Force to cope with the  Spaniards  Thus either way She is in no National Capacity to carry on the Trade or to keep up the Company why then should She not part with it when good Conditions are to be had for the Exchange and all her Merchants are at liberty to Trade in the general Stock in  England  as much as any Merchant there  You cannot Unite with  England  without parting with this Company  The Reason for this is very plain Two Companies in  England  had not only almost destroyed one another but they bid fair for ruining the whole Nation by dividing all the Parties to one side or other and influencing all Publick Affairs to their Favour they became the very Center of all the National Divisions and all the Factions seem'd to be Incorporated into the two Companies  Thus the Nation began to be Stock jobb'd into Bargain and Sale and the Power of two such Rivals made even the King himself concern himself to bring them to Conditions and the whole Nation was made uneasy by the Agreement which by this time had the Breach continued might have embroil'd us all This is a Reason sufficient why  England  cannot Unite while two  EastIndia  Companies subsist  Well say some Gentlemen with all our Hearts we dont desire they should let them let it alone  Why truly there I believe much of the Case lyes they that Argue for the having the  African  Company kept up do it chiefly that if possible it might be a Cheque to the Ʋnion and so 'tis the Ʋnion not the Company they are Debating  As to the Ʋnion Gentlemen I avoid mentioning it as much as I can because some People are so Chary they will not bear to have it mentioned and I am loth to give any Body Offence  But in this Case it cannot be helpt  England  cannot Ʋnite with an open Trade to  India  She cannot come into the same Confusion as she was in under two Companies before it is Inconsistent with her Peace and with her Trade and in the End would be so to yours too  As to them that would not have her Ʋnite and therefore Argues about keeping the Company I have nothing to say  to their Ʋniting but never let them bring this as a Difficulty for let it go what way it will the Company can never be of any Benefit to  Scotland  nor shall it be ever true that by the Union  Scotland  shall not be vastly Gainer  Well but says another Gentleman What if all this be true must we needs Unite with you if we do get  per Annum  and all the things you talk of  We han't a mind to Ʋnite  And what then Why should we be forc'd to it  No by no means say I I abhor Force I am laying out the Advantages to Perswade if Force was to be used there could be no need of PerswadingGod forbid I should think much less talk of  Englands  Forcing  Scotland  to ƲniteAnd I have said my mind on that Head to your Advantage long before I thought of coming to these PartsNor should I expect any Good from such a Compulsion  But it is a Compulsion of Reasoning  Argument Constrains  and such a Force there will be indeed and you will notwithstanding all this Struggle whether you Ʋnite or no come to stoop your Reason to the Force of the Thing and hereafter not too late I hope own your selves Mistaken  If you wont Ʋnite Gentlemen I cannot help that but in the mean time do not pretend to Reason it out of your sight for all manner of Argument is against you And you can reject an Ʋnion upon no Foot but that of Acting against your own Light and the Invincible Power of your own Reason  FINIS  ADVERTISEMENT  These are to give Notice That the fourth Essay is to be had at the  Caledonia  CoffeeHouse over against the
