 THE RAMBLER  VOLUME THE SIXTH  Nullius addictus jurare in verba magistri  Quo me cunque rapit tempestas deferor hospes  HOR  LONDON  Printed for J PAYNE at POPE'SHEAD IN PATERNOSTERROW MDCCLII  THE RAMBLER  NUMB  TUESDAY  Nov    Quo Virtus quo ferat Error  HOR  AS any action or posture long continued will distort and disfigure the limbs so the mind likewise is crippled and contracted by perpetual application to the same set of ideas It is easy to guess the trade of an artizan by his knees his fingers or his shoulders and there are few among men of the more liberal professions whose minds do not carry the brand of their calling or whose conversation does not quickly discover to what class of the community they belong  THESE peculiarities have been of great use in the general hostility which every part of mankind exercises against the rest to furnish  insults and sarcasms Every art has its dialect uncouth and ungrateful to all whom custom has not reconciled to its sound and which therefore becomes ridiculous by a slight misapplication or unnecessary repetition  THE general reproach with which ignorance revenges the superciliousness of learning is that of pedantry a censure which every man incurs who has at any time the misfortune to talk to those who cannot understand him and by which the modest and timorous are sometimes frighted from the display of their acquisitions and the exertion of their powers  THE name of a pedant is so formidable to young men when they first fally from their colleges and is so liberally scattered by those who mean to boast their elegance of education easiness of manners and knowledge of the world that it seems to require particular consideration since perhaps if it were once understood many a heart might be freed from painful apprehensions and many a tongue delivered from restraint  PEDANTRY is the unseasonable ostentation of learning It may be discovered either in the choice of a subject or in the manner of treating it He is undoubtedly guilty of pedantry who when he has made himself master of some abstruse and uncultivated part of knowledge obtrudes his remarks and discoveries upon those whom he believes unable to judge of his proficiency and from whom as he cannot fear contradiction he cannot properly expect applause  TO this error the student is sometimes betrayed by the natural recurrence of the mind to its common employment by the pleasure which every man receives from the recollection of pleasing images and the desire of dwelling upon topicks on which he knows himself able to speak with justness But because we are seldom so far prejudiced in favour of each other as to search out for palliations of failings this deviation from politeness is imputed always to vanity and the harmless collegiate who perhaps intended entertainment and instruction or at worst only spoke without sufficient reflection upon the character of his  hearers is commonly censured as arrogant or overbearing and eager to extend the reputation of his own accomplishments in contempt of the convenience of society and the laws of conversation  ALL discourse of which others cannot partake is not only an irksome usurpation of the time devoted to pleasure and entertainment but what never fails to excite very keen resentment an insolent assertion of superiority and a triumph over less enlightened understandings The pedant is therefore not only heard with weariness but malignity and those who conceive themselves insulted by his knowledge never fail to tell with acrimony how injudiciously it was exerted  TO avoid this dangerous imputation and recommend themselves more effectually to the gay world scholars sometimes divest themselves with too much haste of their academical formality and in their endeavours to accommodate their notions and their stile to common conceptions talk rather of any thing than of that which they understand and sink  into insipidity of sentiment and meanness of expression  THERE prevails among men of letters an opinion that all appearance of science is particularly hateful to women and that therefore whoever desires to be well received in female assemblies must qualify himself by a total rejection of all that is serious rational or important must consider argument or criticism as perpetually interdicted and devote all his attention to trifles and all his eloquence to compliment  STUDENTS often form their notions of the present generation from the writings of the past and are not very early informed of those changes which the gradual diffusion of knowledge or the sudden caprice of fashion produces in the world Whatever might be the state of female literature in the last century there is now no longer any danger lest the scholar should want an adequate audience at the teatable and whoever thinks it necessary to regulate his conversation by antiquated  rules will be rather despised for his futility than caressed for his politeness  TO talk intentionally in a manner above the comprehension of those whom we address is unquestionable pedantry but surely complaisance requires that no man should without proof conclude his company incapable of following him to the highest elevation of his fancy or the utmost extent of his knowledge It is always safer to err in favour of others than of ourselves and therefore we seldom hazard much by endeavouring to excel  IT ought at least to be the care of learning when she quits her exaltation to descend with dignity Nothing is more despicable than the airiness and jocularity of a man bred to severe science and solitary meditation To trifle agreeably is a secret which schools cannot impart that gay negligence and vivacious levity which charm down resistance wherever they appear are never attainable by him who having spent his first years among the dust of libraries enters late into the living world with an unpliant attention and established habits  IT is observed in the panegyrick on  Fabricius  the mechanist that though forced by publick employments into mingled conversation he never lost the modesty and seriousness of the convent nor drew ridicule upon himself by an affected imitation of fashionable life To the same praise every man devoted to learning ought to aspire If he attempts the softer arts of pleasing and endeavours to learn the graceful bow and the familiar embrace the insinuating accent and the general smile he will lose the respect due to the character of learning without arriving at the envied honour of doing nothing with elegance and facility  THEOPHRASTUS  was discovered not to be a native of  Athens  by so strict an adherence to the  Attic  dialect as shewed that he had learned it not by custom but by rule A man not early formed to habitual elegance betrays in like manner the defects of his education by an unnecessary anxiety of behaviour It is possible to become pedantick by fear of pedantry as to be troublesome by illtimed  civility There is no kind of impertinence more justly censurable than his who is always labouring to level his thoughts to intellects higher than his own who apologizes for every word which his own narrowness of converse inclines him to think unusual keeps the exuberance of his faculties under visible restraint is solicitous to anticipate enquiries by needless explanations and endeavours to shade his own abilities lest weak eyes should be dazzled with their lustre  NUMB  SATURDAY  Nov    Foenum habet in cornu longe fuge dummodo risum  Excutiat sibi non hic cuiquam parcet amico  HOR  To the RAMBLER  Mr RAMBLER  THE laws of social benevolence require that every man should endeavour to assist others by his experience He that ha  at last escaped into port from the fluctuations of chance and the gusts of opposition ought to make some improvements in the chart of life by marking the rocks on which he has been dashed and the shallows where he has been stranded  THE error into which I was betrayed when custom first gave me up to my own direction is very frequently incident to the quick the sprightly the fearless and the gay to all whose ardour hurries them into precipitate execution of their designs and imprudent declaration of their opinions who seldom count the cost of pleasure or examine the distant consequences of any practice that flatters them with immediate gratification  I CAME forth into the crouded world with the usual juvenile ambition and desired nothing beyond the title of a wit Money I considered as below my care for I saw such multitudes grow rich without understanding that I could not forbear to look on wealth as an acquisition easy to industry directed by genius and therefore threw it aside as a secondary convenience to be procured when my  principal wish should be satisfied and my claim to intellectual excellence universally acknowledged  WITH this view I regulated my behaviour in publick and exercised my meditations in solitude My life was divided between the care of providing topicks for the entertainment of my company and that of collecting company worthy to be entertained for I soon found that wit like every other power has its boundaries that its success depends upon the aptitude of others to receive impressions and that as some bodies indissoluble by heat can set the furnace and crucible at defiance there are minds upon which the rays of fancy may be pointed without effect and which no fire of sentiment can agitate or exalt  IT was however not long before I sitted myself with a set of companions who knew how to laugh and to whom no other recommendation was necessary than the power of striking out a jest Among those I fixed my residence and for a time enjoyed the felicity of disturbing the neighbours every night with  the obstreperous applause which my sallies forced from the audience The reputation of our club every day increased and as my flights and remarks were circulated by my admirers every day brought new solicitations for admission into our society  TO support this perpetual fund of merriment I frequented every place of concourse cultivated the acquaintance of all the fashionable race and passed the day in a continual succession of visits in which I collected a treasure of pleasantry for the expences of the evening Whatever error of conduct I could discover whatever peculiarity of manner I could observe whatever weakness was betrayed by confidence whatever lapse was suffered by neglect all was drawn together for the diversion of my wild companions who when they had been taught the art of ridicule never failed to signalize themselves by a zealous imitation and filled the town on the ensuing day with scandal and vexation with merriment and shame  I CAN scarcely believe when I recollect my own practice that I could have been so far  deluded with trivial praise as to divulge the secrets of consultation and to expose the levities of frankness to waylay the walks of the cautious and surprize the security of the thoughtless Yet it is certain that for many years I heard nothing but with design to tell it and saw nothing with any other curiosity than after some failure that might furnish out a jest  MY heart indeed acquits me of deliberate malignity or interested insidiousness I had no other purpose than to heighten the pleasure of laughter by communication nor ever raised any pecuniary advantage from the calamities of others I led weakness and negligence into difficulties only that I might divert myself with their perplexities and distresses and violated every law of friendship with no other hope than that of gaining the reputation of smartness and waggery  I WOULD not be understood to charge myself with any crimes of the atrocious or destructive kind I never betrayed an heir to gamesters or a girl to debauchees never intercepted the kindness of a patron or sported  away the reputation of innocence My delight was only in petty mischief and momentary vexations and my acuteness was employed not upon fraud and oppression which it had been meritorious to detect but upon harmless ignorance or absurdity prejudice or mistake  THIS enquiry I pursued with so much diligence and sagacity that I was able to relate of every man whom I knew some blunder or miscarriage to betray the most circumspect of my friends into follies by a judicious flattery of his predominant passion or expose him to contempt by placing him in circumstances which put his prejudices into action brought to view his natural defects or drew the attention of the company on his airs of affectation  THE power had been possessed in vain if it had never been exerted and it was not my custom to let any arts of jocularity remain unemployed My impatience of applause brought me always early to the place of entertainment and I seldom failed to lay a  scheme with the small knot that first gathered round me by which some of those whom we expected might be made subservient to our sport Every man has some favourite topick of conversation on which by a feigned seriousness of attention he may be drawn to expatiate without end Every man has some habitual contortion of body or established mode of expression which never fails to raise mirth if it be pointed out to notice By premonitions of these particularities I secured our pleasantry Our companion entered with his usual gaiety and began to partake of our noisy chearfulness when the conversation was imperceptibly diverted to a subject which pressed upon his tender part and extorted the expected shrug the customary exclamation or the predicted remark A general clamour of joy then burst from all that were admitted to the stratagem Our mirth was often encreased by the triumph of him that occasioned it for as we do not hastily sorm conclusions against ourselves seldom any one suspected that he had exhilarated us otherwise than by his wit  YOU will hear I believe with very little surprize that by this conduct I had in a short time united mankind against me and that every tongue was diligent in prevention or revenge I soon perceived myself regarded with malevolence or distrust but wondered what had been discovered in me either terrible or hateful I had invaded no man's property I had rivalled no man's claims not had ever engaged in any of those attempts which provoke the jealousy of ambition or the rage of faction I had lived but to laugh and make others laugh and believed that I was loved by all who caressed and favoured by all who applauded me I never imagined that he who in the mirth of a nocturnal revel concurred in ridiculing his friend would consider in a cooler hour that the same trick might be played against himself or that even where there is no sense of danger the natural pride of human nature rises against him who by general censures lays claim to general superiority  I WAS convinced by a total desertion of the impropriety of my conduct every man avoided and cautioned others to avoid me Wherever I came I found silence and dejection coldness and terror No one would venture to speak lest he should lay himself open to unfavourable representations the company however numerous dropped off at my entrance upon various pretences and if I retired to avoid the shame of being left I heard confidence and mirth revive at my departure  IF those whom I had thus offended could have contented themselves with repaying one insult for another and kept up the war only by a reciprocation of sarcasms they might have perhaps vexed but would never much have hurt me for no man heartily hates him at whom he can laugh But these wounds which they give me as they fly are without cure this alarm which they spread by their solicitude to escape me excludes me from all friendship and from all pleasure I am condemned to pass a long interval of my life in solitude as a man suspected of infection is refused admission into cities and must linger  in obscurity till my conduct shall convince the world that I may be approached without hazard  I am c DICACULUS  NUMB  TUESDAY  Nov    Rari quippe boni numero vix sunt totidem quot  Thebarum  portae vel divitis ostia Nili  JUV  NONE of the axioms of wisdom which recommend the ancient sages to veneration seems to have required less extent of knowledge or perspicacity of penetration than the remark of  Bias  that    the majority are wicked  THE depravity of mankind is so easily discoverable that nothing but the desert or the cell can exclude it from notice The knowledge of crimes intrudes uncalled and undesired They whom their abstraction from  common occurrences hinders from seeing iniquity will quickly have their attention awakened by feeling it Even he who ventures not into the world may learn its corruption in his closet For what are treatises of morality but persuasives to the practice of duties for which no arguments would be necessary but that we are continually tempted to violate or neglect them What are all the records of history but narratives of successive villanies of treasons and usurpations massacres and wars  BUT perhaps the excellence of aphorisms consists not so much in the expression of some rare or abstruse sentiment as in the comprehension of some obvious and useful truth in a few words We frequently fall into error and folly not because the true principles of action are not known but because for a time they are not remembered and he may therefore be justly numbered among the benefactors of mankind who contracts the great rules of life into short sentences that may be easily impressed on the memory and taught by frequent recollection to recur habitually to the mind  HOWEVER those who have passed through half the life of man may now wonder that any should require to be cautioned against corruption they will find that they have themselves purchased their conviction by many disappointments and vexations which an earlier knowledge would have spared them and may see on every side some intangling themselves in perplexities and some sinking into ruin by ignorance or neglect of the maxim of  Bias  EVERY day sends out in quest of pleasure and distinction some heir fondled in ignorance and flattered into pride He comes forth with all the confidence of a spirit unacquainted with superiors and all the benevolence of a mind not yet irritated by opposition alarmed by fraud or imbittered by cruelty He loves all because he imagines himself the universal favourite Every exchange of salutation produces new acquaintance and every acquaintance kindles into friendship  EVERY season brings a new flight of beauties into the world who have hitherto heard  only of their own charms and imagine that the heart feels no passion but that of love They are soon surrounded by admirers whom they credit because they tell them only what is heard with delight Whoever gazes upon them is a lover and whoever forces a sigh is pining in despair  HE surely is an useful monitor who inculcates to these thoughtless strangers that the  majority are wicked  who informs them that the train which wealth and beauty draw after them is lured only by the scent of prey and that perhaps among all those who croud about them with professions and flatteries there is not one who does not hope for some opportunity to devour or betray them to glut himself by their destruction or to share their spoils with a stronger savage  VIRTUE presented singly to the imagination or the reason is so well recommended by its own graces and so strongly supported by arguments that a good man wonders how any can be bad and they who are yet ignorant of the force of passion and interest who never observed the arts of seduction the contagion  of example the gradual descent from one crime to another or the insensible depravation of the principles by loose conversation naturally expect to find integrity in every bosom and veracity on every tongue  IT is indeed impossible not to hear from those who have lived longer of wrongs and salshoods of violence and circumvention but such narratives are commonly regarded by the young the heady and the confident as nothing more than the murmurs of peevishness or the dreams of dotage and notwithstanding all the documents of hoary wisdom we commonly plunge into the world fearless and credulous without any foresight of danger or apprehension of deceit  I HAVE remarked in a former paper that credulity is the common failing of unexperienced virtue and that he who is spontaneously suspicious may be justly charged with radical corruption for if he has not known the preval  nce of dishonesty by information no  had  me to observe it with his own eyes whence can he take his measures of judgment but from himself  THEY who best deserve to escape the snares of artifice are most likely to be entangled He that endeavours to live for the good of others must always be exposed to the arts of them who live only for themselves unless he is taught by timely precepts the caution required in common transactions and shown at a distance the pitfals of treachery  TO youth therefore it should be carefully inculcated that to enter the road of life without caution or reserve in expectation of general fidelity and justice is to laucnh on the wide ocean without the instruments of steerage and to hope that every wind will be prosperous and that every coast will afford a harbour  TO ennumerate the various motives to deceit and injury would be to count all the desires that prevail among the sons of men since there is no ambition however petty no wish however absurd that by indulgence will not be enabled to overpower the influence of virtue Many there are who openly and almost professedly regulate all their conduct  by their love of money who have no reason for action or forbearance for compliance or refusal than that they hope to gain more by one than by the other These are indeed the meanest and cruelest of human beings a race with whom as with some pestiferous animals the whole creation seems to be at war but who however detested or scorned long continue to add heap to heap and when they have reduced one to beggary are still permitted to fasten on another  OTHERS yet less rationally wicked pass their lives in mischief because they cannot bear the sight of success and mark out every man for hatred whose same or fortune they believe encreasing  MANY who have not advanced to these degrees of guilt are yet wholly unqualified for friendship and unable to maintain any constant or regular course of kindness Happiness may be destroyed not only by union with the man who is apparently the slave of interest but with him whom a wild opinion of the dignity of perseverance in whatever  cause disposes to persue every injury with unwearied and perpetual resentment with him whose vanity inclines him to consider every man as a rival in every pretension with him whose airy negligence puts his friend's affairs or secrets in continual hazard and who thinks his forgetfulness of others excused by his inattention to himself or with him whose inconstancy ranges without any settled rule of choice through varieties of friendship and who adopts and dismisses favourites by the sudden impulse of caprice  THUS numerous are the difficulties to which the converse of mankind exposes us and which can be avoided only by prudent distrust He therefore that remembering this salutary maxim learns early to withold his fondness from fair appearances will have reason to pay some honours to  Bias  of  Priene  who enabled him to become wise without the cost of experience  NUMB  SATURDAY  Nov    Naso suspendere adunco  HOR  THERE are many vexatious accidents and uneasy situations which raise little compassion for the sufferer and which no man but those whom they immediately distress can regard with seriousness Petty mischiefs that have no influence on futurity nor extend their effects to the rest of life are always seen with a kind of malicious pleasure A mistake or embarrasment which for the present moment fills the face with blushes and the mind with confusion will have no other effect upon those who observe it than that of convulsing them with irresistible laughter Some circumstances of misery are so powerfully ridiculous that neither kindness nor duty can withstand them they bear down love interest and reverence and force the friend the dependent or the child to give way to instantaneous motions of merriment  AMONG the principal of comick calamities may be reckoned the pain which an author not yet hardened into insensibility feels at the onset of a furious critick whose age rank or fortune gives him confidence to speak without reserve who heaps one objection upon another and obtrudes his remarks and enforces his corrections without tenderness or awe  THE author full of the importance of his work alarmed at the danger of his character and anxious for the justification of every syllable starts and kindles at the slightest attack the critick eager to establish his superiority triumphing in every discovery of failure and zealous to impress the cogency of his arguments pursues him from line to line without cessation or remorse The critick who hazards little proceeds with vehemence impetuosity and fearlessness the author whose quiet and fame and life and immortality are involved in the controversy tries every art of subterfuge and defence maintains modestly what he resolves never to yield and yields unwillingly what  cannot be maintained The critick's purpose is to conquer the author only hopes to escape the critick therefore knits his brow and raises his voice and rejoyces whenever he perceives any tokens of pain excited by the pressure of his assertions or the point of his sarcasms The author whose endeavour is at once to mollify and elude his persecutor composes his features and softens his accent breaks the force of assault by retreat and rather steps aside than flies or advances  AS it very seldom happens that the rage of extemporary criticism inflicts fatal or lasting wounds I know not that the Laws of benevolence entitle this distress to much sympathy The diversion of baiting an author has the sanction of all ages and nations and is more lawful than the sport of teizing other animals because for the most part he comes voluntarily to the stake furnished as he imagines by the patron powers of literature with resistless weapons and impenetrable armour with the mail of the boar of  Erymanth  and the paws of the lion of  Nemea  BUT the works of genius are sometimes produced by other motives than vanity and he whom necessity or duty enforces to write is not always so well satisfied with himself as not to be discouraged by censorious impudence It may therefore be necessary to consider by what measures they whom the publication of their names lays open to the insults of such as their obscurity secures against reprisals may extricate themselves from unexpected encounters  VIDA  a man of considerable skill in the politicks of literature directs his pupil wholly to abandon his defence and even when he can irrefragably refute all objections to suffer tamely the exultations of his antagonist  THIS rule may perhaps be just when advice is asked and severity solicited because no man tells his opinion so freely as when he imagines it received with implicit veneration and critics ought never to be consulted but while errors may yet be rectified or insipidity suppressed But when the book has once been dismissed into the world and can  be no more retouched I know not whether a very different conduct should not be prescribed and whether firmness and spirit may not sometimes be of use to overpower arrogance and repel brutality Softness diffidence and moderation will often be mistaken for imbecillity and dejection they lure cowardice to the attack by the hopes of easy victory and it will soon be found that he whom every man thinks he can conquer shall never be at peace  THE animadversions of criticks are commonly such as may easily provoke the sedatest writer to some quickness of resentment and asperity of reply A man who by long consideration has familiarised a subject to his own mind carefully survey'd the series of his thoughts and planned all the parts of his composition into a regular dependance on each other will often start at the sinistrous interpretations or absurd remarks of haste and ignorance and wonder by what infatuation they have been led away from the obvious  sense and upon what peculiar principles of judgment they decide against him  THE eye of the intellect like that of the body is not equally perfect in all nor equally adapted in any to all objects the end of criticism is to supply its defects rules are the instruments of mental vision which may indeed assist our faculties when properly used but produce confusion and obscurity by unskilful application  SOME seem always to read with the microscope of criticism and employ their whole attention upon minute elegance or faults scarcely visible to common observation The dissonance of a syllable the recurrence of the same sound the repetition of a particle the smallest deviation from propriety the slightest defect in construction or arrangement swell before their eyes into enormities As they discern with great exactness they comprehend but a narrow compass and know nothing of the justness of the design the general spirit of the performance the artifice of connection  or the harmony of the parts they never conceive how small a proportion that which they are busy in contemplating bears to the whole or how the trivial inaccuracies with which they are offended are absorbed and lost in general excellence  OTHERS are furnished by criticism with a telescope They see with great clearness whatever is too remote to be discovered by the rest of mankind but are totally blind to all that lies immediately before them They discover in every passage some secret meaning some remote allusion some artful allegory or some occult imitation which no other reader ever suspected but they have no perception of the cogency of arguments the contexture of narrations the various colours of diction or the flowery embellishments of fancy of all that engages the attention of others they are totally insensible while they pry into worlds of conjecture and amuse themselves with phantoms in the clouds  IN criticism as in every other art we fail sometimes by our weakness but more  frequently by our fault We are sometimes bewildered by ignorance and sometimes by prejudice but we seldom deviate far from the right but when we deliver ourselves up to the direction of vanity  NUMB  TUESDAY  Nov    Turpe est difficiles haberc nugas  MART  To the RAMBLER  SIR  WHEN after the usual time spent at the university I was about to enter upon the profession to which my friends had destined me being summoned by the death of my father into the country I found myself master of an unexpected sum of money and of an estate which though not large was in my opinion sufficient to support me in a condition far preferable to the fatigue dependence and uncertainty of any gainful occupation I therefore resolved  to devote the rest of my life wholly to curiosity and without any confinement of my excursions or termination of my views to wander over the boundless regions of general knowledge  THIS scheme of life seemed pregnant with inexhaustible variety and therefore I could not forbear to congratulate myself upon the wisdom of my choice I furnish'd a large room with all conveniencies for study collected books of every kind quitted every science at the first perception of disgust returned to it again as soon as my former ardour happened to revive and having no rival to depress me by comparison nor any critic to alarm me with objections I spent day after day in profound tranquility with only so much complacence in my own improvements as served to excite and animate my application  THUS I lived for some years with complete acquiescence in my own plan of conduct rising early to read and dividing the latter part of the day between oeconomy exercise and reflection But in time I began  to find my mind contracted and stiffened by solitude My ease and elegance were sensibly impaired I was no longer able to accommodate myself with readiness to the accidental current of conversation my notions grew particular and paradoxical and my phraseology formal and unfashionable I spoke on common occasions the language of books My quickness of apprehension and celerity of reply had entirely deserted me When I delivered my opinion or detailed my knowledge I was bewildered by an unseasonable interrogatory disconcerted by any trivial objection and overwhelmed and lost in dejection when the smallest advantage was gained against me in dispute I became decisive and dogmatical impatient of contradiction perpetually jealous of my character insolent to such as acknowledged my superiority and sullen and malignant to all who refused to receive my dictates  THIS I soon discovered to be one of those intellectual diseases which a wise man should make haste to cure I therefore resolved for a time to shut my books and learn again the  art of conversation to defecate and clear my mind by brisker motions and stronger impulses and to unite myself once more to the living generation  FOR this purpose I hasted to  London  and entreated one of my academical acquaintances to introduce me into some of the little societies of literature which are formed in taverns and coffeehouses He was pleased with an opportunity of shewing me to his friends and soon obtained me admission among a select company of curious men who met once a week to exhilarate their studies and compare their acquisitions  THE eldest and most venerable of this society was  Hirsutus  who after the first civilities of my reception sound means to introduce the mention of his favourite studies by a severe censure of those who want the due regard for their native country He informed me that he had early withdrawn his attention from foreign trifles and that since he begun to addict his mind to serious and manly studies he had very carefully amassed all the  English  books that were printed in  the black character This search he had pursued so diligently that he was able to show the deficiencies of the best catalogues He had long since completed his  Caxton  had three sheets of  Treveris  unknown to the antiquaries and wanted to a perfect  Pynson  but two volumes of which one was promised him as a legacy by its present possessor and the other he was resolved to buy at whatever price when  Quisquilius  's library should be sold  Hirsutus  had no other reason for the valuing or slighting a book than that it was printed in the  Roman  or the  Gothick  letter nor any ideas but such as his favourite volumes had supplied when he was serious he expatiated on the narratives of  Johan de Trevisa  and when he was merry regaled us with a quotation from the  Shippe of Foles  WHILE I was listening to this hoary student  Ferratus  entered in a hurry and informed us with the abruptness of extasy that his set of halfpence was now complete he had just received in a handful of change the piece that he had so long been seeking  and could now defy mankind to outgo his collection of  English  copper  CHARTOPHYLAX  then observed how fatally human sagacity was sometimes baffled and how often the most valuable discoveries are made by chance He had employed himself and his emissaries seven years at great expence to perfect his series of  Gazettes  but had long wanted a single paper which when he despaired of obtaining it was sent him wrapped round a parcel of tobacco  CANTILENUS  turned all his thoughts upon old ballads for he considered them as the genuine records of the national taste He offered to shew me a copy of  The Children in the Wood  which he firmly believed to be of the first edition and by the help of which the text might be freed from several corruptions if this age of barbarity had any claim to such favours from him  MANY were admitted into this society as inferior members because they had collected old prints and neglected pamphlets or possessed some fragment of antiquity as the seal  of an antient corporation the charter of a religious house the genealogy of a family extinct or a letter written in the reign of  Elizabeth  EVERY one of these virtuosos looked on all his associates as wretches of depraved taste and narrow notions Their conversation was therefore fretful and waspish their behaviour brutal their merriment bluntly sarcastick and their seriousness gloomy and suspicious They were totally ignorant of all that passes or has lately passed in the world unable to discuss any question of religious political or military knowledge equally strangers to science and politer learning and without any wish to improve their minds or any other pleasure than that of displaying rarities of which they would not suffer others to make the proper use  HIRSUTUS  graciously informed me that the number of their society was limited but that I might sometimes attend as an auditor I was pleased to find myself in no danger of an honour which I could not have willingly accepted nor gracefully refused  and left them without any intention of returning for I soon found that the suppression of those habits with which I was vitiated required association with men very different from this solemn race  I am SIR c VIVACULUS  IT is natural to feel grief or indignation when any thing necessary or useful is wantonly wasted or negligently destroyed and therefore my correspondent cannot be blamed for looking with uneasiness on the waste of life Leisure and curiosity might soon make great advances in useful knowledge were they not diverted by trivial emulation and laborious trifles It may however somewhat mollisy his anger to reflect that perhaps none of the assembly which he describes was capable of any nobler employment and that he who does his best however little is always to be distinguished from  him who does nothing Whatever busies the mind without corrupting it has at least this use that it rescues the day from idleness and he that is never idle will not often be vitious  NUMB  SATURDAY  Nov    Pars Sanitatis velle sanari fuit  SENECA  PYTHAGORAS  is reported to have required from those whom he instructed in philosophy a probationary silence of five years Whether this prohibition of speech extended to all the parts of this time as seems generally to be supposed or was to be observed only in the school or in the presence of their master as is more probable it was sufficient to discover the pupil's disposition to try whether he was willing to pay the price of learning or whether he was one of those whose ardour was rather violent  than lasting and who expected to grow wise on other terms than those of patience and obedience  MANY of the blessings universally desired are very frequently wanted because most men when they should labour content themselves to complain and rather linger in a state in which they cannot be at rest than improve their condition by vigour and resolution  PROVIDENCE has fixed the limits of human enjoyment by immoveable boundaries and has set different gratifications at such a distance from each other that no art or power can bring them together This great law it is the business of every rational being to understand that life may not pass away in an attempt to make contradictions consistent to combine opposite qualities and to unite things which the nature of their being must always keep asunder  OF two objects tempting at a distance on contrary sides it is impossible to approach one  but by receding from the other by long deliberation and dilatory projects they may be both lost but can never be both gained It is therefore necessary to compare them and when we have determined the preference to withdraw our eyes and our thoughts at once from that which reason directs us to reject This is more necessary if that which we are forsaking has the power of delighting the senses or firing the fancy He that once turns aside to the allurements of unlawful pleasure can have no security that he shall ever regain the paths of virtue  THE philosophick goddess of  Boethius  having related the story of  Orpheus  who when he had recovered his wife from the dominions of death lost her again by looking back upon her in the consines of of light concludes with a very elegant and forcible application  Whoever you are that endeavour to elevate your minds to the illuminations of Heaven    consider yourselves as represented in this fable    for he that is once so far overcome as to turn back his eyes towards the  infernal caverns    loses at the first sight all that influence which attracted him on high  Vos haec fabula respicit  Quicunque in superum diem  Mentem ducere quaeritis  Nam qui  Tartareum  in specus  Victus lumina flexerit  Quidquid praecipuum trahit  Perdit dum videt inferos  IT may be observed in general that the future is purchased by the present It is not possible to secure distant or permanent happiness but by the forbearance of some immediate gratification This is so evidently true with regard to the whole of our existence that all the precepts of theology have no other tendency than to enforce a life of faith a life regulated not by our senses but our belief a life in which pleasures are to be refused for fear of invisible punishments and calamities sometimes to be fought and always endured in hope of rewards that shall be obtained in another state  EVEN if we take into our view only that particle of our duration which is terminated by the grave it will be found that we cannot enjoy one part of life beyond the common limitations of pleasure but by anticipating some of the satisfaction which should exhilarate the following years The heat of youth may spread happiness into wild luxuriance but the radical vigour requisite to make it perennial is exhausted and all that can be hoped afterwards is languor and sterility  THE reigning error of manking is that we are not content with the conditions on which the goods of life are granted No man is insensible of the value of knowledge the advantages of health or the convenience of plenty but every day shews us those on whom their conviction is without effect  KNOWLEDGE is praised and desired by multitudes whom her charms could never rouse from the couch of sloth whom the faintest invitation of pleasure draws away from their studies to whom any other method of wearing out the day is more eligible than the use of books and who are more  easily engaged by any conversation than such as may rectify their notions or enlarge their comprehension  EVERY man that has felt pain knows how little all other comforts can gladden him to whom health is denied Yet who is there does not sometimes hazard it for the enjoyment of an hour All assemblies of jollity all places of publick entertainment exhibit examples of strength wasting in riot and beauty withering in irregularity nor is it easy to enter a house in which part of the family is not groaning in repentance of past intemperance and part admitting discase by negligence or soliciting it by luxury  THERE is no pleasure which men of every age and sect have more generally agreed to mention with contempt than the gratifications of the palate an entertainment so far removed from intellectual happiness that scarcely the most shameless of the sensual herd have dared to defend it yet even to this the lowest of our delights to this though neither quick nor lasting is health with all its activity and sprightliness daily sacrificed and  for this are half the miseries endured which urge impatience to call on death  THE whole world is put in motion by the wish for riches and the dread of poverty Who then would not imagine that such conduct as will inevitably destroy what all are thus labouring to acquire must generally be avoided That he who spends more than he receives must in time become indigent cannot be doubted but how evident soever this consequence may appear the spendthrist moves in the whirl of pleasure with too much rapidity to keep it before his eyes and in the intoxication of gaiety grows every day poorer without any such sense of approaching ruin as is sufficient to wake him into caution  MANY complaints are made of the misery of life and indeed it must be confessed that we are subject to calamities by which the good and bad the diligent and slothful the vigilant and heedless are equally afflicted But surely though some indulgence may be allowed to groans extorted by inevitable misery no man has a right to repine at evils which against warning against experience  he deliberately and leisurely brings upon his own head or to consider himself as debarred from happiness by such obstacles as resolution may break or dexterity may put aside  GREAT numbers who quarrel with their condition have wanted not the power but the will to obtain a better state They have never contemplated the difference between good and  sufficiently to quicken aversion or invigorate desire they have indulged a drowsy thoughtlessness or giddy levity have committed the balance of choice to the management of caprice and when they have long accustomed themselves to receive all that chance offered them without examination lament at last that they find themselves deceived  NUMB  TUESDAY  Dec    Perpetuo risu pulmonem agitare solebat  JUV  EVERY man says  Tully  has two characters one which he partakes with all mankind and by which he is distinguished from brute animals another which discriminates him from the rest of his own species and impresses on him a manner and temper peculiar to himself this particular character if it be not repugnant to the laws of general humanity it is always his business to cultivate and preserve  EVERY hour furnishes some confirmation of  Tully  's precept It seldom happens that any assembly of pleasure is so happily selected but that some one finds admission with whom the rest are deservedly offended and it will appear on a close inspection that scarce any man becomes eminently disagreeable but by affectation by a departure from his real character  and an attempt at something for which nature or education have left him unqualified  IGNORANCE or dulness have indeed no power of affording delight but they never give disgust except when they assume the dignity of knowledge or ape the sprightliness of wit Aukwarkness and inelegance have none of those attractions by which ease and politeness take possession of the heart but ridicule and censure seldom rise against them unless they appear associated with that confidence which belongs only to long acquaintance with the modes of life and to consciousness of unfailing propriety of behaviou  ▪ Deformity itself is regarded with tenderne  rather than aversion when it does not attempt to deceive the sight by dress and decoration and to seize upon fictitious claims the prerogatives of beauty  HE that stands to contemplate the crouds that fill the streets of a populous city will see many  assengers whose air and motion it will be difficult to behold without contempt and laughter but if he examines what are  the appearances that thus powerfully excite his merriment he will find among them neither poverty nor disease nor any involuntary or painful defect The disposition to derision and insult is awakened by the softness of foppery the swell of insolence the liveliness of levity or the solemnity of grandeur by the sprightly trip the stately stalk the formal strut and the lofty mein by gestures intended to catch the eye and by looks ela+borately formed as evidences of importance  IT has I think been sometimes urged in favour of affectation that it is only a mis+take of the means to a good end and that the Intention with which it is practised is al+ways to please If all attempts to innovate the constitutional or habitual character have really proceeded from public spirit and from love of others the world has hitherto been sufficiently ungrateful since no return but aversion and scorn has yet been made to the most difficult of all enterprizes a contest with nature nor has any pity been shown to the fatigues of labour which never succeeded and the uneasiness of disguise by which nothing was concealed  IT seems to be determined by the general suffrage of mankind that he who decks himself in adscititious qualities rather purposes to command applause than impart pleasure and he is therefore treated as a man unreasonably ambitious of distinction who usurps a place in society to which he has no right Praise is seldom paid with willingness even to incontestable merit and it can be no wonder that he who calls for it without desert is repulsed with universal indignation  AFFECTATION naturally counterfeits those excellencies which are placed at the greatest distance from possibility of attainment We are conscious of our own defects and eagerly endeavour to supply them by counterfeited excellence nor would such efforts be wholly without excuse were they not often excited by ornamental trifles and unessential accomplishments which he that thus anxiously struggles for the reputation of possessing them would not have been thought to want had not his industry quickened observation  GELASIMUS  passed the first part of his life in academical privacy and rural retirement without any other conversation than that of scholars grave studious and abstracted as himself He cultivated the mathematical sciences with undesatigable diligence discovered many useful theorems discussed with great accuracy the resistance of fluids and though his priority was not generally acknowledged was the first who fully explained all the properties of the catenarian curve  LEARNING when it rises to eminence will be observed in time whatever mists may happen to surround it  Gelasimus  in his fortyninth year being distinguished by those who have the rewards of knowledge in their hands was called out of his obscurity to dis+play his acquisitions for the honour of his country and add dignity by his presence to phi+losophical assemblies As he did not suspect his unfitness for common affairs he felt no reluctance to obey the invitation and what he did not feel he had yet too much honesty to seign He entered into the world as a larger and more populous college where  his performances would be more public and his renown farther extended and imagined that he should find his reputation universally prevalent and the influence of learning every where the same  HIS merit introduced him to splendid tables and elegant acquaintance but he did not find himself always qualified to join in the conversation He was distressed by civilities which he knew not how to repay and entangled in many ceremonial perplexities from which his books and diagrams could not extricate him He was sometimes unluckily engaged in disputes with ladies with whom algebraick axioms had no great weight and saw many whose favour and esteem he could not but desire to whom he was very little recommended by his theories of the tides or his approximations to the quadrature of the circle  GELASIMUS  did not want penetration to discover that no charm was more generally irresistible than that of easy facetiousness and  flowing hilarity He saw that diversion was more frequently welcome than improvement that authority and seriousness were rather feared than loved and that the grave scholar was a kind of imperious ally hastily dismissed when his assistance was no longer necessary He therefore came to a sudden resolution of throwing off those cumbrous ornaments of learning which as he imagined hindred his reception and commenced a man of wit and jocularity Utterly unacquainted with every topic of merriment ignorant of the modes and follies the vices and virtues of mankind and unfurnished with any ideas but such as  Pappus  and  Archimedes  had given him he began to silence all enquiries with a jest instead of a solution extended his face with a grin which he mistook for a smile and in the place of a scientifick discourse retailed in a new language formed between the college and the tavern the intelligence of the newspaper  LAUGHTER he knew was a token of alacrity and therefore whatever he said  or heard he was careful not to fail in that great duty of a wit If he asked or told the hour of the day if he complained of heat or cold stirred the fire or filled a glass removed his chair or snuffed a candle he always found some occasion to laugh The jest was indeed generally a secret to all but himself but his habitual confidence in his own discernment hindered him from suspecting any weakness or mistake He wondered that his wit was so little understood but expected that his audience would comprehend it by degrees and persisted all his life to show by gross buffoonery how little the strongest faculties can perform beyond the limits of their own province  NUMB  SATURDAY  Dec    AUTOMEDOM  IT is somewhere related by  Le Clerc  that a wealthy trader of good understanding having the common ambition to breed his son a scholar carried him to an university resolving to make use of his own judgment in the choice of a tutor He had been taught by whatever intelligence the nearest way to the heart of an academick and soon after his arrival opened his purse with so little reserve and entertained all who came about him with such prosusion of plenty that the professors were lured by the smell of his table from their books and flocked round him with all the importunity of aukward complaisance This eagerness completely answered the merchant's purpose he glutted them with delicacies cheared them with wine and softened them with caresses till  by degrees he prevailed upon one after another to open his bosom and make a full discovery of his competitions jealousies and resentments After having thus learned each man's character partly from himself and partly from his acquaintances he at last resolved to find some other method of educating his son and went away fully convinced that a scholastic life has no other tendency than to vitiate the morals and contract the understanding Nor could he afterwards hear with patience the praises of the ancient authors being persuaded that scholars of all ages must have been the same and that  Xenophon  and  Cicero  were nothing more than professors of some former university and were therefore mean and selfish ignorant and servile like those whom he had lately visited and forsaken  ENVY curiosity and our sense of the imperfection of our present state inclines us always to estimate the advantages which are in the possession of others above their real value Every one must have remarked what powers and prerogatives the vulgar imagine to be conferred by learning A man  of science is expected to excel the unlettered and unenlightened even on occasions where literature is of no use and among weak minds loses part of his reverence by discovering no superiority in those parts of life in which all are unavoidably equal as when a monarch makes a progress to the remoter provinces the rusticks are said sometimes to wonder that they find him of the same size with themselves  THESE demands of prejudice and folly can never be satisfied and therefore many of the imputations which learning suffers from disappointed ignorance are without reproach Yet it cannot be denied that there are some failures to which men of study are peculiarly exposed Every condition has its disadvantages The circle of knowledge is too wide for the most active and diligent intellect and while science is persued with ardour other accomplishments of equal use are necessarily neglected as a small garrison must leave one part of an extensive fortress naked when an alarm calls them to another  THE learned however might generally support their dignity with more success if they suffered not themselves to be misled by the desire of superfluous attainments of qualification which few can understand or value and of skill which they may sink into the grave without any conspicuous opportunities of exerting  Raphael  in return to  Adam  's enquiries into the courses of the stars and the revolutions of heaven counsels him to withdraw his mind from idle speculations and instead of watching motions which he has no power to regulate to employ his faculties upon nearer and more interesting objects the survey of his own life the subjection of his passions the knowledge of duties which must daily be performed and the detection of dangers which must daily be incurred  THIS angelick counsel every man of letters should always have before him He that devotes himself wholly to retired study naturally sinks from omission to forgetfulness of social duties from which he must be sometimes awakened and recalled to the general condition of mankind  I AM far from any intention to limit curiosity or consine the labours of learning to arts of immediate and necessary use It is only from the various essays of experimental industry and the vague excursions of minds sent out upon discovery that any advancement of knowledge can be expected and though many must be disappointed in their labours yet they are not to be charged with having spent their time in vain their example contributed to inspire emulation and their miscarriages taught others the way to success  BUT the distant hope of being one day useful or eminent ought not to mislead us too far from that knowledge which is equally requisite to the great and mean to the celebrated and obscure the art of moderating the desires of repressing the appetites and of conciliating or retaining the favour of mankind  NO man can imagine the conduct of his own life unworthy his attention yet among the sons of learning many may be found who seem to have thought of every thing rather  than of themselves and have never condescended to observe what passes daily before their eyes Many who toil through the intricacy of complicated systems but are insuperably embarrassed with the least perplexity in common affairs and while they compare the actions and ascertain the characters of ancient heroes let their own days glide away without examination and suffer vicious habits to encroach upon their minds without resistance or detection  ONE of the most frequent reproaches of the scholastick race is the want of fortitude of fortitude not martial but philosophick Men bred in shades and silence taught to immure themselves at sunset and accustomed to no other weapon than syllogism may be allowed to feel terror at personal danger and to be disconcerted by tumult and alarm But why should he whose life is spent in contemplation and whose business is only to discover truth be unable to rectify the fallacies of imagination or contend successfully against prejudice and passion To what end has he read  and meditated if he gives up his understanding to false appearances and suffers himself at last like the meanest of the vulgar to be enslaved by fear of evils to which only folly or vanity can expose him or elated by advantages which can add nothing to a wise man and to which as they are equally conferred upon the good and bad no real dignity is annexed  SUCH however is the state of the world that the most obsequious of the slaves of pride the most raptuous of the gazers upon wealth the most officious of the whisperers of greatness are collected from seminaries appropriated to the study of wisdom and the contemplation of virtue where it was intended that appetite should learn to be content with little and that hope should aspire only to honours which no human power can give or take away  THE student when he comes forth into the world instead of congratulating himself upon his exemption from the errors and failures to which he sees those liable whose opinions have  been formed by accident or custom and who live without any certain principles of conduct is commonly in haste to shake from him all that distinguishes him from the rest of mankind to mingle on equal terms with the multitude and shew his sprightliness and ductility by an expeditious compliance with fashions pleasures or vices The first smile of a man whose rank or fortune gives him power to reward his dependents commonly enchants him beyond resistance the glare of equipage the sweets of luxury the liberality of general promises the softness of habitual affability strike his senses and fill his imagination and he soon ceases to have any other wish than to be well received or any measure of right and wrong but the opinion of his patron  A MAN flattered and obeyed soon learns to exact grosser adulation and enjoin lower submission Neither our virtues nor vices are all our own If there were no cowardice there would be little insolence a man cannot grow proud to any great degree but by the concurrence  of blandishment or the sufferance of tameness The wretch that would shrink and crouch before those that should dart their eyes upon him with the spirit of natural equality quickly becomes capricious and tyrannical when he sees himself approached with a downcast look and hears the soft address of awe and servility To the folly of those who are willing to purchase favour and preferment by cringes and compliance is to be imputed that general haughtiness of power that leaves nothing to be hoped by firmness and integrity  IF instead of wandering after the meteors of philosophy which fill the world with splendor for a while and then sink and are forgotten the candidates of learning would fix their eyes only upon the permanent and immutable lustre of moral and religious truth they would find a more certain direction to honour and happiness A little plausibility of discourse and a little acquaintance with unnecessary speculations is dearly purchased when it excludes those instructions which fortify the heart with resolution and exalt the spirit to independence  NUMB  TUESDAY  Dec    Neu fluitem dubiae spe pendulus horae  HOR  To the RAMBLER  SIR  AS I have passed much of my life in disquiet and suspense and lost many opportunities of advantage by a passion which I have reason to believe prevalent in different degrees over a great part of mankind I cannot but think myself well qualified to warn those who are yet uncaptivated of the danger which they incur by placing themselves within its influence  I SERVED an apprenticeship to a linendraper with uncommon reputation for diligence and fidelity and at the age of three and twenty opened a shop for myself with a large stock and such credit among all the merchants who were acquainted with my master that I could command whatever was imported curious or  valuable For five years I proceeded with success proportionate to close application and untainted integrity was a daring bidder at every sale always paid my notes before they were due and advanced so fast in commercial reputation that I was proverbially marked out as the model of young traders and every one expected that a few years would make me an alderman  IN this course of even prosperity I was one day persuaded to buy a ticket in the lottery The sum was inconsiderable the greater part was to be repaid though fortuen might fail to favour me and therefore my established maxims of frugality did not restrain me from so trifling an experiment The ticket lay almost forgotten till the time at which every man's fate was to be determined nor did the affair even then seem of any importance till I discovered by the publick papers that the number next to mine had conferred the great prize  MY heart leaped at the thought of such an approach to sudden riches which I considered  myself however contrarily to the laws of computation as having missed by a single chance and I could not forbear to revolve the consequences which such a bounteous allotment would have produced if it had happened to me This dream of felicity by degrees took possession of my imagination The great delight of my solitary hours was to purchase an estate and form plantations with money which once might have been mine and I never met my friends but I spoiled all their merriment by perpetual complaints of my ill luck  AT length another lottery was opened and I had now so heated my imagination with the prospect of a prize that I should have pressed among the first purchasers had not my ardour been withheld by deliberation upon the probability of success from one ticket rather than another I hesitated long between even and odd considered the square and cubick numbers through the lottery examined all those to which good luck had been hitherto annexed and at last fixed upon one which by some  secret relation to the events of my life I thought predestined to make me happy Delay in great affairs is often mischievous the ticket was sold and its possessor could not be found  IRETURNED to my conjectures and after many arts of prognostication fixed upon another chance but with less confidence Never did captive heir or lover feel so much vexation from the slow pace of time as I suffered between the purchase of my ticket and the distribution of the prizes I solaced my uneasiness as I could by frequent contemplations of approaching happiness when the sun rose I knew it would set and congratulated myself at night that I was so much nearer to my wishes At last the day came my ticket appeared and rewarded all my care and sagacity with a despicable prize of fifty pounds  MY friends who honestly rejoiced upon my success were very coldly received I hid myself a fortnight in the country that my chagrine might fume away without observation  and then returning to my shop began to listen after another lottery  WITH the news of a lottery I was soon gratified and having now found the vanity of conjecture and inefficacy of computation I resolved to take the prize by violence and therefore bought forty tickets not omitting however to divide them between the even and odd numbers that I might not miss the lucky class Many conclusions did I form and many experiments did I try to determine from which of those tickets I might most reasonably expect riches At last being unable to satisfy myself by any modes of reasoning I wrote the numbers upon dice and allotted five hours every day to the amusement of throwing them in a garret and examining the event by an exact register found on the evening before the lottery was drawn that one of my numbers had been turned up five times more than any of the rest in three hundred and thirty thousand throws  THIS experiment was fallacious the first day presented the hopeful ticket a detestable blank The rest came out with different fortune and in conclusion I lost thirty pounds by this great adventure  I HAD now wholly changed the cast of my behaviour and the conduct of my life The shop was for the most part abandoned to my servants and if I entered it my thoughts were so engrossed by my tickets that I scarcely heard or answered a question but considered every customer as an intruder upon my meditations whom I was in haste to dispatch I mistook the price of my goods committed blunders in my bills forgot to file my receipts and neglected to regulate my books My acquaintances by degrees began to fall away but I perceived the decline of my business with little emotion because whatever deficiency there might be in my gains I expected the next lottery to supply  MISCARRIAGE naturally produces diffidence I began now to seek assistance against  ill luck by an alliance with those that had been more successful I enquired diligently at what office any prize had been sold that I might purchase of a propitious vender solicited those who had been fortunate in former lotteries to partake with me in my new tickets and whenever I met with one that had in any event of his life been eminently prosperous I invited him to take a larger share I had by this rule of conduct so diffused my interest that I had a fourth part of fifteen tickets an eighth of forty and a sixteenth of ninety  I WAITED for the decision of my fate with my former palpitations and looked upon the business of my trade with the usual neglect The wheel at last was turned and its revolutions brought me a long succession of sorrows and disappointments I indeed often partook of a small prize and the loss of one day was generally balanced by the gain of the next but my desires yet remained unsatisfied and when one of my chances had failed all my expectation was suspended on those which  remained yet undetermined At last a prize of five thousand pounds was proclaimed I caught fire at the cry and enquiring the number found it to be one of my own tickets which I had divided among those on whose luck I depended and of which I had retained only a sixteenth part  YOU will easily judge with what detestation of himself a man thus intent upon gain reflected that he had sold a prize which was once in his possession It was to no purpose that I represented to my mind the impossibibility of recalling the past or the folly of condemning an act which only its event an event which no human intelligence could foresee proved to be wrong The prize which though put in my hands had been suffered to slip from me filled me with anguish and knowing that complaint would only expose me to ridicule I gave myself up silently to grief and lost by degrees my appetite and my rest  MY indisposition soon became visible I was visited by my friends and among them  by  Eumathes  a clergyman whose piety and learning gave him such an ascendant over me that I could not refuse to open my heart There are said he few minds sufficiently firm to be trusted in the hands of chance Whoever finds himself inclined to anticipate futurity and exalt possibility to certainty should avoid every kind of casual adventure since his grief must be always proportionate to his hope You have long wasted that time which by a proper application would have certainly though moderately encreased your fortune in a laborious and anxious persuit of a species of gain which no labour or anxiety no art or expedient can secure or promote You are now fretting away your life in repentance of an act against which repentance can give no caution but to avoid the occasion of committing it Rouse from this lazy dream of fortuitous riches which if obtained you could scarcely have enjoyed because they could confer no consciousness of desert return to rational and manly industry and consider the meer gift of luck as below the care of a wise man  NUMB  SATURDAY  Dec    Dives qui fieri vult  Et cito vult fieri  JUV  IT has been observed in a late paper that we are unreasonably desirous to separate the goods of life from those evils which providence has connected with them and to catch advantages without paying the price at which they are offered us Every man wishes to be rich but very few have the powers necessary to raise a sudden fortune by new discoveries or superiority of skill in any necessary employment and among lower understandings many want the firmness and industry requisite to regular gain and gradual acquisitions  FROM the hope of enjoying affluence by methods more compendious than those of labour and more generally practicable than those of genius proceeds the common inclination to experiment and hazard and that willingness to snatch all opportunities of  growing rich by chance which when it has once taken possession of the mind is seldom driven out either by time or argument but continues to waste life in perpetual delusion and generally ends in wretchedness and want  THE folly of untimely exultation and visionary prosperity is by no means peculiar to the purchasers of tickets there are multitudes whose life is nothing but a continual lottery who are always within a few months of plenty and happiness and how often soever they are mocked with blanks expect a prize from the next adventure  AMONG the most resolute and ardent of the votaries of chance may be numbered the mortals whose hope is to raise themselves by a wealthy match who lay out all their industry on the assiduities of courtship and sleep and wake with no other ideas than of treats compliments guardians and rivals  ONE of the most indefatigable of this class is my old friend  Leviculus  whom I have never known for thirty years without some matrimonial project of advantage  Leviculus  was bred under a merchant and by the graces of his person the sprightliness of his prattle and the neatness of his dress so much enamoured his master's second daughter a girl of sixteen that she declared her resolution to have no other husband Her father after having chidden her for undutifulness consented to the match not much to the satisfaction of  Leviculus  who was sufficiently elated with his conquest to think himself entitled to a larger fortune He was however soon rid of his perplexity for his mistress died before their marriage  LEVICULUS  was so well satisfied with his own accomplishments that he determined to commence fortunehunter and when his apprenticeship expired instead of beginning as was expected to walk the exchange with a face of importance or associating himself with those who were most eminent for their knowledge of the stocks he at once threw off the solemnity of the countinghouse equipped himself with a modish wig listned to wits in coffee houses passed his evenings behind the scenes in the theatres learned the names of beauties of quality hummed the  last stanzas of fashionable songs talked with familiarity of high play boasted of his atchievements upon drawers and coachmen was often brought to his lodgings at midnight in a chair told with negligence and jocularity of bilking a taylor and now and then let fly a shrewd jest at a sober citizen  THUS furnished with irresistible artillery he turned his batteries upon the female world and in the first warmth of selfapprobation proposed no less than the possession of riches and beauty united He therefore paid his civilities to  Flavilla  the only daughter of a wealthy merchant who not being accustomed to amorous blandishments or respectful addresses was delighted with the novelty of love and easily suffered him to conduct her to the play and to meet her where she visited  Leviculus  did not doubt but her father however offended by a clandestine marriage would soon be reconciled by the tears of his daughter and the merit of his soninlaw and was in haste to conclude the affair But the lady liked better to be courted than married and kept him three years in  uncertainty and attendance At last she fell in love with a young ensign at a ball and having danced with him all night married him in the morning  LEVICULUS  to avoid the ridicule of his companions took a journey to a small estate in the country where after his usual enquiries concerning the nymphs in the neighbourhood he found it proper to fall in love with  Altilia  a maiden lady twenty years older than himself for whose favour fifteen nephews and nieces were in perpetual contention They hovered round her with such jealous officiousness as scarcely left a moment vacant for a lover  Leviculus  nevertheless discovered his passion in a letter and  Altilia  could not withstand the pleasure of hearing vows and sighs and flatteries and protestations She admitted his visits enjoyed for five years the happiness of keeping all her expectants in perpetual alarms and amused herself with the various stratagems which were practised to disengage her affections Sometimes she was advised with great earnestness to travel for her health and sometimes entreated to keep her brother's  house Many stories were spread to the disadvantage of  Leviculus  by which she commonly seemed affected for a time but took care soon afterwards to express her conviction of their falshood But being at last satiated with this ludicrous tyranny she told her lover when he pressed for the reward of his services that she was very sensible of his merit but was resolved not to impoverish an ancient family  LEVICULUS  then returned to the town and soon after his arrival became acquainted with  Latronia  a lady distinguished by the elegance of her equipage and the regularity of her conduct Her wealth was evident in her magnificence and her prudence in her oeconomy and therefore  Leviculus  who had scarcely confidence to solicit her favour readily acquitted fortune of her former debts when he found himself distinguished by her with such marks of preference as a woman of modesty is allowed to give He now grew bolder and ventured to breathe out his impatience before her She heard him without resentment in time permitted him to hope for happiness and at last fixed the nuptial  day without any distrustful reserve of pinmoney or sordid stipulations for jointure and settlements  LEVICULUS  was triumphing on the eve of marriage when he heard on the stairs the voice of  Latronia  's maid whom frequent bribes had secured in his service She soon burst into his room and told him that she could not suffer him to be longer deceived that her mistress was now spending the last payment of her fortune and was only supported in her expence by the credit of his estate  Leviculus  shuddered to see himself so near a precipice and found that he was indebted for his escape to the resentment of the maid who having assisted  Latronia  to gain the conquest quarrelled with her at last about the plunder  LEVICULUS  was now hopeless and disconsolate till one sunday he saw a lady in the mall whom her dress declared a widow and whom by the jolting prance of her gait and the broad resplendence of her countenance he guessed to have lately buried some prosperous citizen He followed her home  and found her to be no less than the relict of  Prune  the grocer who having no children had bequeathed to her all his debts and dues and his estates real and personal No formality was necessary in addressing madam  Prune  and therefore  Leviculus  went next morning without an introductor His declaration was received with a loud laugh she then collected her countenance wondered at his impudence asked if he knew to whom he was talking then showed him the door and again laughed to find him confused  Leviculus  discovered that this coarseness was nothing more than the coquetry of  Cornhill  and next day returned to the attack He soon grew familiar to her dialect and in a few weeks heard without any emotion hints of gay cloaths with empty pockets concurred in many sage remarks on the regard due to people of property and agreed with her in detestation of the ladies at the other end of the town who pinched their bellies to buy fine laces and then pretended to laugh at the city  HE sometimes presumed to mention marriage but was always answered with a slap a hoot and a slounce At last he began to  press her closer and thought himself more favourably received but going one morning with a resolution to trifle no longer he found her gone to church with a young journeyman from the neighbouring shop of whom she had become enamoured at her window  IN these and a thousand intermediate adventures has  Leviculus  spent his time till he is now grown grey with age fatigue and disappointment He begins at last to find that success is not to be expected and being unfit for any employment that might improve his fortune and unfurnished with any arts that might amuse his leisure is condemned to wear out a tasteless life in narratives which few will hear and complaints which none will pity  NUMB  TUESDAY  Dec    Nulla fides regni sociis omnisque Potestas  Impatiens consortis erat  LUCAN  THE hostility perpetually exercised between one man and another is caused by the desire of many for that which only few can possess Every man would be rich powerful and famous yet same power and riches are only the names of relative conditions which imply the obscurity dependance and poverty of greater numbers  THIS universal and incessant competition produces injury and malice by two motives interest and envy the prospect of adding to our possessions what we can take from others and the hope of alleviating the sense of our disparity by lessening others though we gain nothing to ourselves  OF these two malignant and destructive powers it seems probable at the first view that interest has the strongest and most extensive  influence It is easy to conceive that opportunities to seize what has been long wanted may excite desires almost irresistible but surely the same eagerness cannot be kindled by an accidental power of destroying that which gives happiness to another It must be more natural to rob for gain than to ravage only for mischief  YET I am inclined to believe that the great law of mutual benevolence is oftener violated by envy than by interest and that most of the misery which the defamation of blameless actions or the obstruction of honest endeavours brings upon the world is inflicted by men that propose no advantage to themselves but the satisfaction of poisoning the banquet which they cannot taste and blasting the harvest which they have no right to reap  INTEREST can diffuse itself but to a narrow compass The number is never large of those who can hope to fill the posts of degraded power catch the fragments of shattered fortune or succeed to the honours of depreciated beauty But the empire of envy  has no limits as it requires to its influence very little help from external circumstances Envy may always be produced by idleness and pride and in what place will not they be found  INTEREST requires some qualities not universally bestowed The ruin of another will produce no profit to him who has not discernment to mark his advantage courage to seize and activity to pursue it but the cold malignity of envy may be exerted in a torpid and quiescent state amidst the gloom of stupidity in the coverts of cowardice He that falls by the attacks of interest is torn by hungry tigers he may discover and resist his enemies He that perishes in the ambushes of envy is destroyed by unknown and invisible assailants and dies like him who is suffocated by a poisonous vapour without knowledge of his danger or possibility of contest  INTEREST is seldom pursued but at some hazard He that hopes to gain much has commonly something to lose and when he ventures to attack superiority if he fails to conquer is irrecoverably crushed But envy  may act without expence or danger To spread suspicion to invent calumnies to propagate scandal requires neither labour nor courage It is easy for the author of a lye however malignant to escape detection and infamy needs very little industry to assist its circulation  ENVY is almost the only vice which is practicable at all times and in every place the only passion which can never lie quiet for want of irritation its effects therefore are every where discoverable and its attempts always to be dreaded  IT is impossible to mention a name which any advantageous distinction has made eminent but some latent animosity will burst out The wealthy trader however he may abstract himself from publick affairs will never want those who hint with  Shylock  that ships are but boards and that no man can properly be termed rich whose fortune is at the mercy of the winds The beauty adorned only with the unambitious graces of innocence and modesty provokes whenever she appears a thousand murmurs of detraction and whispers  of suspicion The genius even when he endeavours only to entertain with pleasing images of nature or instruct by uncontested principles of science yet suffers persecution from innumerable criticks whose acrimony is excited merely by the pain of seeing others pleased and of hearing applauses which another enjoys  THE frequency of envy makes it so familiar that it escapes our notice nor do we often reflect upon its turpitude or malignity till we happen to feel its influence When he that has given no provocation to malice but by attempting to excel in some useful art finds himself pursued by multitudes whom he never saw with all the implacability of personal resentment when he perceives clamour and malice let loose upon him as a publick enemy and incited by every stratagem of defamation when he hears the misfortunes of his family or the follies of his youth exposed to the world and every failure of conduct or desect of nature aggravated and ridiculed he then learns to abhor those artifices at which he only laughed before and discovers how much the happiness of life would be advanced  by the eradication of envy from the human heart  ENVY is indeed a stubborn weed of the mind and seldom yields to the culture of philosophy There are however considerations which if carefully implanted and diligently propagated might in time over power and repress it since no one can nurse it for the sake of pleasure as its effects are only shame anguish and perturbation  IT is above all other vices inconsistent with the character of a social being because it sacrifices truth and kindness to very weak temptations He that plunders a wealthy neighbour gains as much as he takes away and improves his own condition in the same proportion as he impairs another's but he that blasts a flourishing reputation must be content with a small dividend of additional fame so small as can afford very little consolation to balance the guilt by which it is obtained  I HAVE hitherto avoided that dangerous and empirical morality which cures one vice by means of another But envy is so base  and detestable so vile in its original and so pernicious in its effects that the predominance of almost any other quality is to be desired It is one of those lawless enemies of society against which poisoned arrows may honestly be used Let it therefore be constantly remembered that whoever envies another confesses his superiority and let those be reformed by their pride who have lost their virtue  IT is no slight aggravation of the injuries which envy incites that they are committed against those who have given no intentional provocation and that the sufferer is marked out for ruin not because he has failed in any duty but because he has dared to do more than was required  ALMOST every other crime is practised by the help of some quality which might have produced esteem or love if it had been well employed but envy is mere unmixed and genuine evil it pursues a hateful end by despicable means and desires not so much its own happiness as another's misery To avoid depravity like this it is not necessary that any  one should aspire to heroism or sanctity but only that he should resolve not to quit the rank which nature assigns him and wish to maintain the dignity of a human being  NUMB  SATURDAY  Dec    Permittes ipsis expendere Numinibus quid  Conveniat nobis Rebusque sit utile nostris  JUV  AS every scheme of life so every form of writing has its advantages and inconveniencies though not mingled in the same proportions The writer of essays escapes many embarrassments to which a large work would have exposed him he seldom harrasses his reason with long trains of consequence dims his eyes with the perusal of antiquated volumes or burthens his memory with great accumulations of preparatory knowledge A careless glance upon a favourite author or transient survey of the varieties of life is generally sufficient to supply  the first hint or seminal idea which enlarged by the gradual accretion of matter stored in the mind is by the warmth of fancy easily expanded into flowers and sometimes ripened into fruit  THE most frequent difficulty by which the authors of these petty compositions are distressed arises from the perpetual demand of novelty and change The compiler of a system of science lays his invention at rest and employs only his judgment the faculty exerted with least fatigue Even the relator of feigned adventures when once the principal characters are established and the great events regularly connected finds incidents and episodes crouding upon his mind every change opens new views and the latter part of the story grows without labour out of the former But he that attempts to entertain his reader with unconnected pieces finds the irksomeness of his task rather encreased than lessened by every production The day calls a fresh upon him for a new topick and he is again obliged to choose without any principle to regulate his choice  IT is indeed true that there is seldom any necessity of looking far or enquiring long for a proper subject Every diversity of art or nature every public blessing or calamity every domestick pain or gratification every sally of caprice blunder of absurdity or stratagem of affectation may supply matter to him whose only rule is to avoid uniformity But it often happens that plenty is the cause of penury the judgment is distracted with boundless multiplicity the imagination ranges from one design to another and the hours pass imperceptibly away till the composition can be no longer delayed and necessity enforces the use of those thoughts which then happen to be at hand The mind rejoicing at deliverance on any terms from perplexity and suspense applies herself vigorously to the work before her collects embellishments and illustrations and sometimes finishes with great elegance and happiness what in a state of ease and leisure she never had begun  IT is not commonly observed how much even of actions considered as particularly subject to choice is to be attributed to accident or some cause out of our own power by  whatever name it be distinguished To close tedious deliberations with hasty resolves and after long consultations with reason to refer the question to caprice is by no means peculiar to the essayist Let him that peruses this paper review the series of his life and enquire how he was placed in his present condition He will find that of the good or ill which he has experienced a great part came unexpected without any visible gradations of approach that every event has been influenced by causes acting without his intervention or concurrence and that whenever he pretended to the prerogative of foresight he was mortified with new conviction of the shortness of his views  THE busy the ambitious the inconstant and the adventurous may be said to throw themselves by design into the arms of fortune and voluntarily to quit the power of governing themselves they engage in a course of life in which little can be ascertained by previous measures the most enlightened wisdom must be satisfied with such obscure conjectures as the comparison of probabilities will afford nor is it any wonder that  their time is past between elation and despondency hope and disappointment  SOME there are who appear to walk the road of life with more circumspection and make no step till they think themselves secure from the hazard of a precipice when neither pleasure nor profit can tempt them from the beaten path who refuse to climb lest they should fall or to run lest they should stumble and move slowly forward without any compliance with those passions by which the heady and vehement are seduced and betrayed  YET even the timorous prudence of this judicious class is far from exempting them from the dominion of chance a subtle and insidious power who will intrude upon privacy and embarrass caution No course of life is so prescribed and limited but that many actions must result from arbitrary election Every one must form the general plan of his conduct by his own reflections he must resolve whether he will endeavour at riches or at content whether he will exercise private or publick virtues whether he will labour for the general benefit of mankind  or contract his beneficence to his family and dependents  THIS is a question which has long exercised the schools of philosophy but remains yet undecided and what hope is there that a young man unacquainted with the arguments on either side should determine his own destiny otherwise than by chance  WHEN chance has given him a partner of his bed whom he prefers to all other women without any proof of superior desert chance must again direct him in the education of his children for who was ever able to convince himself by arguments that he had chosen for his son that mode of instruction to which his understanding was best adapted or by which he would most easily be made wise or virtuous  WHOEVER shall enquire by what motives he was determined on these important occasions will find them such as his pride will scarcely suffer him to confess some sudden ardour of desire some uncertain glimpse of  advantage some trivial competition some inaccurate conclusion or some example implicitly reverenced Such are often the first causes of our resolves for it is necessary to act but impossible to know the consequences of action or to discuss all the reasons which offer themselves on every part to inquisitiveness and solicitude  SINCE life itself is uncertain nothing which has life for its basis can boast much stability Yet this is but a small part of our perplexity We set out on a tempestuous sea in quest of some port where we expect to find rest but where we are not sure of admission we are not only in danger of sinking in the way but of being misled by meteors mistaken for stars of being driven from our course by the changes of the wind and of losing it by unskilful steerage yet it sometimes happens that cross winds blow us to a safer coast that meteors draw us aside from whirlpools and that negligence or error contributes to our escape from mischiefs to which a direct course would have exposed us Of those that by precipitate conclusions involve themselves in calamities without  guilt very few however they may reproach themselves can be certain that other measures would have been more successful  IN this state of universal uncertainty where a thousand dangers hover about us and none can tell whether the good that he pursues is not evil in disguise or whether the next step will lead him to safety or destruction nothing can afford any rational tranquility but the conviction that however we amuse ourselves with unideal sounds nothing in reality is governed by chance but that the universe is under the perpetual superintendence of him who created it that our being is in the hands of omnipotent goodness by whom what appears casual to us is directed for ends ultimately kind and merciful and that nothing can finally hurt him who debars not himself from the divine favour  NUMB  TUESDAY  Dec    At vindicta bonum

than those which are complicated with an opinion of dignity and which we cannot dismiss without leaving in the hands of opposition some advantage iniquitously obtained or suffering from our own prejudices some imputation of pusillanimity  FOR this reason scarcely any law of our redeemer is more openly transgressed or more industriously evaded than that by which he commands his followers to forgive injuries and  prohibits under the sanction of eternal misery the gratification of the desire which every man feels to return pain upon him that inflicts it Many who could have conquered their anger are unable to combat against pride and pursue offences to extremity of vengeance lest they should be insulted by the triumph of an enemy  BUT certainly no precept could better become him at whose birth  peace  was proclaimed  to the earth  For what would so soon destroy all the order of society and deform life with violence and ravage as a permission to every one to judge his own cause and to apportion his own recompence for imagined injuries  IT is difficult for a man of the strictest justice not to favour himself too much in the calmest moments of solitary meditation Every one wishes for the distinctions for which thousands are wishing at the same time in their own opinion with better claims He that when his reason operates in its full force can thus by the mere prevalence of selflove prefer himself to his fellow beings is very  unlikely to judge equitably when his passions are agitated by a sense of wrong and his attention wholly engrossed by pain interest or danger Whoever arrogates to himself the right of vengeance shows how little he is qualified to decide his own claims since he certainly demands what he would think unfit to be granted to another  NOTHING is more apparent than that however injured or however provoked some must at last be contented to forgive For it can never be hoped that he who first commits an injury will contentedly acquiesce in the penalty required the same haughtiness of contempt and vehemence of desire that prompt the act of injustice will more strongly incite its justification and resentment can never so exactly balance the punishment with the fault but there will remain an overplus of vengeance which even he who condemns his first action will think himself entitled to retaliate What then can ensue but a continual exacerbation of hatred an unextinguishable feud and incessant reciprocation of mischief a mutual vigilance to entrap and eagerness to destroy  SINCE then the imaginary right of vengeance must be at last remitted because it is impossible to live in perpetual hostility and equally impossible that of two enemies either should first think himself obliged by justice to submission it is surely eligible to forgive early Every passion is more easily subdued before it has been long accustomed to possession of the heart every idea is obliterated with less difficulty as it has been more slightly impressed and less frequently renewed He who has often brooded over his wrongs pleased himself with schemes of malignity and glutted his pride with the fancied supplications of humbled enmity will not easily open his bosom to amity and reconciliation or indulge the gentle sentiments of benevolence and peace  IT is easiest to forgive while there is yet little to be forgiven A single injury may be soon dismissed from the memory but a long succession of ill offices by degrees associates itself with every idea a long contest involves so many circumstances that every place and action will recal it to the mind and fresh  remembrance of vexation must still enkindle rage and irritate revenge  A WISE man will make haste to forgive because he knows the true value of time and will not suffer it to pass away in unnecessary pain He that willingly suffers the corrosions of inveterate hatred and gives up his days and nights to the gloom of malice and perturbations of stratagem cannot surely be said to consult his ease Resentment is a union of sorrow with malignity a combination of a passion which all endeavour to avoid with a passion which all concur to detest The man who retires to meditate mischief and to exasperate his own rage whose thoughts are employed only on means of distress and contrivances of ruin whose mind never pauses from the remembrance of his own sufferings but to indulge some hope of enjoying the calamities of another may justly be numbered among the most miserable of human beings among those who are guilty without reward who have neither the gladness of prosperity nor the calm of innocence  WHOEVER considers the weakness both of himself and others will not long want persuasives to forgiveness We know not to what degree of malignity any injury is to be imputed or how much its guilt if we were to inspect the mind of him that committed it would be extenuated by mistake precipitance or negligence we cannot be certain how much more we feel than was intended to be inflicted or how much we encrease the mischief to ourselves by voluntary aggravations We may charge to design the effects of accident we may think the blow violent only because we have made ourselves delicate and tender we are on every side in danger of error and of guilt which we are certain to avoid only by speedy forgiveness  FROM this pacifick and harmless temper thus propitious to others and ourselves to domestick tranquility and to social happiness no man is withheld but by pride by the fear of being insulted by his adversary or despised by the world  IT may be laid down as an unfailing and universal axiom that "all pride is abject  and mean" It is always an ignorant lazy or cowardly acquiescence in a false appearance of excellence and proceeds not from consciousness of our attainments but insensibility of our wants  NOTHING can be great which is not right Nothing which reason condemns can be suitable to the dignity of the human mind To be driven by external motives from the path which our own heart approves to give way to any thing but conviction to suffer the opinion of others to rule our choice or overpower our resolves is to submit tamely to the lowest and most ignominious slavery and to resign the right of directing our own lives  THE utmost excellence at which humanity can arrive is a constant and determinate pursuit of virtue without regard to present dangers or advantage a continual reference of every action to the divine will an habitual appeal to everlasting justice and an unvaried elevation of the intellectual eye to the reward which perseverance only can obtain But that pride which many who presume to boast of generous sentiments allow to regulate  their measures has nothing nobler in view than the approbation of men of beings whose superiority we are under no obligation to acknowledge and who when we have courted them with the utmost assiduity can confer no valuable or permanent reward of beings who ignorantly judge of what they do not understand or partially determine what they never have examined and whose sentence is therefore of no weight till it has received the ratification of our own conscience  HE that can descend to bribe suffrages like these at the price of his innocence he that can suffer the delight of such acclamations to withhold his attention from the commands of the universal sovereign has little reason to congratulate himself upon the greatness of his mind whenever he awakes to seriousness and reflection he must become despicable in his own eyes and shrink with shame from the remembrance of his cowardice and folly  OF him that hopes to be forgiven it is indispensibly required that he forgive It is  therefore superfluous to urge any other motive On this great duty eternity is suspended and to him that refuses to practise it the throne of mercy is inaccessible and the SAVIOUR of the world has been born in vain  NUMB  SATURDAY  Dec    Pone me pigris ubi nulla campis  Arbor aestivâ recreatur Aurâ  Dulce ridentem Lalagen amabo  Dulce loquentem  HOR  OF the happiness and misery of our present state part arises from our sensations and part from our opinions part is distributed by nature and part is in a great measure apportioned by ourselves Positive pleasure we cannot always obtain and positive pain we often cannot remove No man can give to his own plantations the fragrance of the  Indian  groves nor will any precepts of philosophy enable him to withdraw his attention from wounds or diseases But the negative  infelicity which proceeds not from the pressure of sufferings but the absence of enjoyments will always yield to the remedies of reason  ONE of the great arts of escaping superfluous uneasiness is to free our minds from the habit of comparing our condition with that of others on whom the blessings of life are more bountifully bestowed or with imaginary states of delight and security perhaps unattainable by mortals Few are placed in a situation so gloomy and distresful as not to see every day beings yet more forlorn and miserable from whom they may learn to rejoice in their own lot  No inconvenience is less superable by art or diligence than the inclemency of climates and therefore none affords more proper exercise for this philosophical abstraction A native of  England  pinched with the frosts of  December  may lessen his affection for his own country by suffering his imagination to wander in the vales of  Asia  and sport among woods that are always green and streams that always murmur but if he turns his thoughts  towards the polar regions and considers the nations to whom a great portion of the year is darkness and who are condemned to pass weeks and months amidst mountains of snow he will soon recover his tranquility and while he stirs his fire or throws his cloak about him reflect how much he owes to providence that he is not placed in  Greenland  or  Siberia  THE barrenness of the earth and the severity of the skies in these dreary countries are such as might be expected to confine the mind wholly to the contemplation of necessity and distress so that the care of escaping death from cold and hunger should leave no room for those passions which in lands of plenty fluence conduct or diversify characters but the summer should be spent only in providing for the winter and the winter in longing for the summer  YET learned curiosity is known to have found its way into these abodes of poverty and gloom  Lapland  and  Iceland  have their historians their criticks and their poets and love that extends his dominion wherever humanity  can be found perhaps exerts the same power in the  Greenlander  's hut as in the palaces of eastern monarchs  IN one of the large caves to which the families of  Greenland  retire together to pass the cold months and which may be termed their villages or cities a youth and maid who came from different parts of the country were so much distinguished for their beauty that they were called by the rest of the inhabitants  Anningait  and  Ajut  from a supposed resemblance to their ancestors of the same names who had been transformed of old into the sun and moon  ANNINGAIT  for some time heard the praises of  Ajut  with little emotion but at last by frequent interviews became sensible of her charms and first made a discovery of his affection by inviting her with her parents to a feast where he placed before  Ajut  the tail of a whale  Ajut  seemed not much delighted by this gallantry yet however from that time was observed rarely to appear but in a vest made of the skin of a white deer she used frequently to renew the black dye upon her  hands and forehead to adorn her sleeves with coral and shells and to braid her hair with great exactness  THE elegance of her dress and the judicious disposition of her ornaments had such an effect upon  Anningait  that he could no longer be restrained from a declaration of his love He therefore composed a poem in her praise in which among other heroick and tender sentiments he protested that "She was beautiful as the vernal willow and fragrant as thyme upon the mountains that her fingers were white as the teeth of the morse and her smile grateful as the dissolution of the ice that he would pursue her though she should pass the snows of the midland cliffs or seek shelter in the caves of the eastern canibals that he would tear her from the embraces of the genius of the rocks snatch her from the paws of  Amarce  and rescue her from the ravine of  Hafgufa  " he concluded with a wish that "whoever shall attempt to hinder his union with  Ajut  might be buried without his bow and that in the land of souls his skull might serve for no other use  than to catch the droppings of the starry lamps"  THIS ode being universally applauded it was expected that  Ajut  would soon yield to such fervour and accomplishments but  Ajut  with the natural haughtiness of beauty expected the usual forms of courtship and before she would confess herself conquered the sun returned the ice broke and the season of labour called all to their employments  ANNINGAIT and  Ajut  for a time always went out in the same boat and divided whatever was caught  Anningait  in the sight of his mistress lost no opportunity of signalizing his courage he attacked the seahorses on the ice pursued the seals into the water and leaped upon the back of the whale while he was yet struggling with the remains of life Nor was his diligence less to accumulate all that could be necessary to make winter comfortable he dried the roe of fishes and the flesh of seals he entrapped deer and foxes and dressed their skins to adorn his  bride he feasted her with eggs from the rocks and strewed her tent with flowers  IT happened that a tempest drove the fish to a distant part of the coast before  Anningait  had compleated his store he therefore entreated  Ajut  that she would at last grant him her hand and accompany him to that part of the country whither he was now summoned by necessity  Ajut  thought him not yet entitled to such condescension but proposed as a trial of his constancy that he should return at the end of summer to the cavern where their acquaintance commenced and there expect the reward of his assiduities "O virgin beautiful as the sun shining on the water consider" said  Anningait  "what thou hast required How easily may my return be precluded by a sudden frost or unexpected fogs then must the night be past without my  Ajut  We live not my fair in those fabled countries which lying strangers so wantonly describe where the whole year is divided into short days and nights where the same habitation serves for summer and winter where they raise houses in rows above the ground dwell together from  year to year with flocks of tame animals grazing in the fields about them can travel at any time from one place to another through ways enclosed with trees or over walls raised upon the inland waters and direct their course through wide countries by the sight of green hills or scattered buildings Even in summer we have no means of crossing the mountains whose snows are never dissolved nor can remove to any distant residence but in our boats coasting the bays Consider  Ajut  a few summer days and a few winter nights and the life of man is at an end Night is the time of ease and festivity of revels and gaiety but what will be the flaming lamp the delicious seal or the soft oil without the smile of  Ajut  "  THE eloquence of  Anningait  was vain the maid continued inexorable and they parted with ardent promises to meet again before the night of winter  NUMB  TUESDAY  Dec    Non illum nostri possunt mutare Labores  Non si Frigoribus mediis Hebrumque bibamus  Sithoniasque Nives Hiemis subeamus aquosae  Omnia vincit Amor  VIRG  ANNINGAIT  however discomposed by the dilatory coyness of  Ajut  was yet resolved to omit no tokens of amorous respect and therefore presented her at his departure with the skins of seven white fawns of five swans and eleven seals with three marble lamps ten vessels of seal oil and a large kettle of brass which he had purchased from a ship at the price of half a whale and two horns of sea unicorns  AJUT  was so much affected by the fondness of her lover or so much overpowered by his magnificence that she followed him to the seaside and when she saw him enter the boat wished aloud that he might return with plenty of skins and oil that neither the mermaids might snatch him into the deeps  nor the spirits of the rocks confine him in their caverns  SHE stood a while to gaze upon the departing vessel and then returning to her hut silent and dejected laid aside from that hour her white deer skin suffered her hair to spread unbraided on her shoulders and forbore to mix in the dances of the maidens She endeavoured to divert her thoughts by continual application to feminine employments gathered moss for the winter lamps and dried grass to line the boots of  Anningait  Of the skins which he had bestowed upon her she made a fishing coat a small boat and tent all of exquisite manufacture and while she was thus busied solaced her labours with a song in which she prayed "that her lover might have hands stronger than the paws of the bear and feet swifter than the feet of the raindeer that his dart might never err and that his boat might never leak that he might never stumble on the ice nor faint in the water that the seal might rush on his harpoon and the wounded whale might dash the waves in vain"  THE large boats in which the  Greenlanders  transport their families are always rowed by women for a man will not debase himself by work which requires neither skill nor courage  Anningait  was therefore exposed by idleness to the ravages of passion He went thrice to the stern of the boat with an intent to leap into the water and swim back to his mistress but recollecting the misery which they must endure in the winter without oil for the lamp or skins for the bed he resolved to employ the weeks of absence in provision for a night of plenty and felicity He then composed his emotions as he could and expressed in wild numbers and uncouth images his hopes his sorrows and his fears "O life" says he "srail and uncertain where shall wretched man find thy resemblance but in ice floating on the ocean It towers on high it sparkles from afar while the storms drive and the waters beat it the sun melts it above and the rocks shatter it below What art thou deceitful pleasure but a sudden blaze streaming from the north which plays a moment on the eye mocks the traveller with the hopes of light and then vanishes forever What  love art thou but a whirlpool which we approach without knowledge of our danger drawn on by imperceptible degrees till we have lost all power of resistance and escape Till I fixed my eyes on the graces of  Ajut  while I had yet not called her to the banquet I was careless as the sleeping morse I was merry as the singers in the stars Why  Ajut  did I gaze upon thy graces why my fair did I call thee to the banquet Yet be faithful my love remember  Anningait  and meet my return with the smile of virginity I will chase the deer I will subdue the whale resistless as the frost of darkness and unwearied as the summer sun In a few weeks I shall return prosperous and wealthy then shall the rocfish and the porpoise feast thy kindred the fox and hare shall cover thy couch the tough hide of the seal shall shelter thee from cold and the fat of the whale illuminate thy dwelling"  ANNINGAIT  having with these sentiments consoled his grief and animated his industry found that they had now coasted the headland and saw the whales spouting at a  distance He therefore placed himself in his fishing boat called his associates to their several employments plied his oar and harpoon with incredible courage and dexterity and by dividing his time between the chace and fishery suspended the miseries of absence and suspicion  AJUT  in the mean time notwithstanding her neglected dress happened as she was drying some skins in the sun to catch the eye of  Norngsuk  on his return from hunting  Norngsuk  was of birth truly illustrious His mother had died in childbirth and his father the most expert fisher of  Greenland  had perished by too close pursuit of the whale His dignity was equalled by his riches he was master of four mens and two womens boats had ninety tubs of oil in his winter habitation and five and twenty seals buried in the snow against the season of darkness When he saw the beauty of  Ajut  he immediately threw over her the skin of a deer that he had taken and soon after presented her with a branch of coral  Ajut  refused his gifts and determined to admit no lover in the place of  Anningait  NORNGSUK  thus rejected had recourse to stratagem He knew that  Ajut  would consult an  Angekkok  or diviner concerning the fate of her lover and the felicity of her future life He therefore applied himself to the most celebrated  Angekkok  of that part of the country and by a present of two seals and a marble kettle obtained a promise that when  Ajut  should consult him he would declare that her lover was in the land of souls  Ajut  in a short time brought him a coat made by herself and enquired what events were to befal her with assurances of a much larger reward at the return of  Anningait  if the prediction should flatter her desires The  Angekkok  knew the way to riches and foretold that  Anningait  having already caught two whales would soon return home with a large boat laden with provisions  THIS prognostication she was ordered to keep secret and  Norngsuk  depending upon his artifice renewed his addresses with greater confidence but finding his suit still unsuccessful applied himself to her parents with gifts and promises The wealth of  Greenland  is too powerful for the virtue of a  Greenlander    they forgot the merit and the presents of  Anningait  and decreed  Ajut  to the embrace of  Norngsuk  She entreated she remonstrated she wept and raved but finding riches irresistible fled away into the uplands and lived in a cave upon such berries as she could gather and the birds or hares which she had the fortune to ensnare taking care at an hour when she was not likely to be found to view the sea every day that her lover might not miss her at his return  AT last she saw the great boat in which  Anningait  had departed stealing slow and heavy laden along the coast She ran with all the impatience of affection to catch her lover in her arms and relate her constancy and sufferings When the company reached the land they informed her that  Anningait  after the fishery was ended being unable to support the slow passage of the vessel of carriage had set out before them in his fishing boat and they expected at their arrival to have found him on shore  AJUT  distracted at this intelligence was about to fly again into the hills without  knowing why though she was now in the hands of her parents who forced her back to their own hut and endeavoured to comfort her but when at last they retired to rest  Ajut  went down to the beach where finding a fishing boat she entered it without hesitation and telling those who wondered at her rashness that she was going in search of  Anningait  rowed away with great swiftness and was seen no more  THE fate of these lovers gave occasion to various fictions and conjectures Some are of opinion that they were changed into stars others imagine that  Anningait  was seized in his passage by the genius of the rocks and that  Ajut  was transformed into a mermaid and still continues to seek her lover in the desarts of the sea But the general persuasion is that they are both in that part of the land of souls where the sun never sets where oil is always fresh and provisions always warm The virgins sometimes throw a thimble and a needle into the bay from which the hapless maid departed and when a  Greenlander  would praise any couple for virtuous affection he declares that they love like  Anningait  and  Ajut  NUMB  SATURDAY  Jan    Si te colo  Sexte  non amabo  MART  NONE of the desires dictated by vanity is more general or less blamable than that of being distinguished for the arts of conversation Other accomplishments may be possessed without opportunity of exerting them or wanted without danger that the desect can often be remarked but as no man can live otherwise than in an hermitage without hourly pleasure or vexation from the fondness or neglect of those about him the faculty of giving pleasure is of continual use Few are more frequently envied than those who have the power of forcing attention wherever they come whose entrance is considered as a promise of selicity and whose departure is lamented like the recess of the sun from northern climates as a privation of all that enlivens fancy or inspirits gaiety  IT is apparent that to excellence in this valuable art some peculiar qualifications are necessary for every one's experience will inform him that the pleasure which men are able to give in conversation holds no stated proportion to their knowledge or their virtue Many find their way to the tables and the parties of those who never consider them as of the least importance in any other place we have all at one time or other been content to love those whom we could not esteem and been persuaded to try the dangerous experiment of admitting him for a companion whom we knew to be too ignorant for a counsellor and too treacherous for a friend  I QUESTION whether some abatement of character is not almost necessary to general acceptance Few spend their time with much satisfaction under the eye of uncontested superiority and therefore among those who are received with universal welcome and whose presence is courted at assembles of jollity there are seldom  ound men eminently distinguished for powers of nature or acquisitions of study The wit whose vivacity condemns  lower tongues to silence the scholar  whose knowledge allows no man to fansy that he instructs him the critick who suffers no fallacy to pass undetected the reasoner who condemns

who has stored his memory with slight anecdotes private incidents and personal particularities seldom fails to find his audience favourable Almost every man listens with eagerness to contemporary history for almost every man has some real or imaginary  connection with a celebrated character some desire to advance or oppose a rising name Vanity often cooperates with curiosity He that is a hearer in one place qualifies himself to become a speaker in another for though he cannot comprehend a series of argument or transport the volatile spirit of wit with evaporation he yet thinks himself able to treasure up the various incidents of a story and pleases his hopes with the information which he shall give to some inferior society  NARRATIVES are for the most part heard without envy because they are not supposed to imply any intellectual qualities above the common rate To be acquainted with facts not yet ecchoed by plebeian mouths may happen to one man as well as to another and to relate them when they are known has in appearance so little difficulty that every one concludes himself equal to the task  BUT it is not easy and in some situations not possible to accumulate such a stock of materials as may support the expence of continual narration and it frequently happens that they who attempt this method of  ingratiating themselves please only at the first interview and for want of new supplies of intelligence wear out their stories by continual repetition  THERE would be therefore little hope of obtaining the praise of a good companion were it not to be gained by more compendious methods but such is the kindness of mankind to all except those who aspire to real merit and rational dignity that every understanding may find some way to benevolence and whoever is not envied may learn the art of procuring love We are willing to be pleased but we are not willing to admire we favour the mirth or officiousness that solicits our regard but oppose the worth or spirit that enforces it  THE first place among those that please because they desire only to please is due to the  merry fellow  whose laugh is loud and whose voice is strong who is ready to eccho every jest with obstreperous approbation and countenance every frolick with vociferations of applause It is not necessary to a merry  fellow to have in himself any fund of jocularity or force of conception it is sufficient that he always appears in the highest exaltation of gladness for the greater part of mankind are gay or serious by infection and follow without resistance the attraction of example  NEXT to the merry fellow is the  goodnatured man  a being generally without benevolence or any other virtue than such as indolence and insensibility confer The characteristick of a  goodnatured man  is to bear a joke to sit unmoved and unaffected amidst noise and turbulence profaneness and obscenity to hear every tale without contradiction to endure insult without reply and to follow the stream of folly whatever course it shall happen to take The goodnatured man is commonly the darling of the petty wits with whom they exercise themselves in the rudiments of raillery for he never takes advantage of failings nor disconcerts a puny satirist with unexpected sarcasms but while the glass continues to circulate contentedly bears the  expence of uninterrupted laughter and retires rejoicing at his own importance  THE  modest man  is a companion of a yet lower rank whose only power of giving pleasure is not to interrupt it The modest man satisfies himself with peaceful silence which all his companions are candid enough to consider as proceeding not from inability to speak but willingness to hear  MANY without being able to attain any general character of excellence have some single art of entertainment which serves them as a passport through the world One I have known for fifteen years the darling of a weekly club because every night precisely at eleven he begins his favourite song and during the vocal performance by correspondent motions of his hand chalks out a giant upon the wall Another has endeared himself to a long succession of acquaintances by sitting among them with his wig reversed another by contriving to smut the nose of any stranger who was to be initiated in the club another by purring like a cat and then pretending to be frighted and another by yelping like a  hound and calling to the drawers to drive out the dog  SUCH are the arts by which cheerfulness is promoted and sometimes friendship established arts which those who despise them should not rigorously blame except when they are practised at the expence of innocence for it is always necessary to be loved but not always necessary to be reverenced  NUMB  TUESDAY  Jan    Quod tam grande sophos clamat tibi Turba togata  Non tu  Pomponi  coena diserta tua est  MART  THE world scarcely affords opportunities of making any observation more frequently than on false claims to praise and reputation Almost every man wastes part of his life in attempts to display qualities which  he does not possess and to gain applause which he cannot keep nor is it possible to enter any assembly without seeing one part offended or diverted by the ostentation of the other  OF these pretenders it is fit to distinguish those who endeavour to deceive from them who are deceived those who by designed impostures promote their interest or gratify their pride from them who mean only to force into regard their latent excellencies and neglected virtues who believe themselves qualified to instruct or please and therefore invite the notice of mankind  THE artful and fraudulent usurpers of distinction deserve greater severities than ridicule and contempt since they are seldom content with empty praise but are instigated by passions more pernicious than vanity They consider the reputation which they endeavour to establish as necessary to the accomplishment of some subsequent design and value praise only as it may conduce to the success of avarice or ambition  THE commercial world is very frequently put into confusion by the bankrupcy of merchants that assumed the splendour of wealth only to obtain the privilege of trading with the stock of other men and of contracting debts which nothing but lucky casualties could enable them to pay till after having supported their appearance awhile by a tumultuary magnificence of boundless traffick they sink at once and drag down into poverty those whom their equipages had induced to trust them  AMONG wretches that place their happiness in the favour of beings whom only high titles or large estates set above themselves nothing is more common than to boast of confidence which they do not enjoy to sell promises which they know their interest unable to perform and to reimburse the tribute which they pay to some prosperous slave from the contributions of meaner dependents whom they can amuse with tales of their influence and hopes of their solicitation  YET among some too thoughtless or volatile for avarice or ambition may be found  a species of falshood more detestable than the levee or exchange can shew There are men that boast of debaucheries of which they never had address to be guilty ruin by lewd tales the characters of women to whom they are scarcely known or by whom they have been rejected destroy in a drunken frolick the happiness of families blast the bloom of beauty and intercept the reward of virtue  OTHER artifices of falshood though utterly unworthy of an ingenuous mind are yet not to be ranked with flagitious enormities nor is it necessary to incite the vengeance of sanguinary justice against them since they may be adequately punished by detection and laughter The traveller who describes cities which he has never seen the squire who at his return from  London  tells of his intimacy with nobles to whom he has only bowed in the park or coffeehouse the author who entertains his admirers with stories of the assistance which he gives to wits of a higher rank the city dame who is careful to introduce the mention of her visits at great houses where she happens to know the cookmaid  are surely such harmless animals as truth herself may be content to despise without desiring to hurt them  BUT of the multitudes who struggle in vain for distinction and display their own merits only to feel more acutely the sting of neglect a great part are wholly innocent of deceit and are betrayed by infatuation and credulity to that scorn with which the universal love of praise incites us all to drive feeble competitors out of our way  FEW men survey themselves with so much severity as not to admit prejudices in their own favour which an artful flatterer may gradually strengthen till wishes for a particular qualification are improved to hopes of attainment and hopes of attainment to belief of possession Such flatterers every one will find who has power to reward their assiduities Wherever there is wealth there will be dependance and expectation and wherever there is dependance there will be an emulation of servility  MANY of the follies which provoke general censure are the effects of such vanity as however it might have wantoned in the imagination would scarcely have dared the publick eye had it not been animated and emboldened by flattery Whatever difficulty there may be in the knowledge of ourselves scarcely any one fails to suspect his own imperfections till he is elevated by others to confidence Almost every man is naturally modest and timorous but fear and shame are uneasy sensations and whosoever helps to remove them is received with kindness  TURPICULA  was born the heiress of a large estate and having lost her mother in her infancy was committed to the care of a governess whom misfortunes had reduced to accept any terms on which she could be decently supported The fondness of  Turpicula  's father would not suffer him to trust her at a publick school but he took care to hire domestick teachers and bestowed on her all the accomplishments which wealth could purchase But how many things are necessary to happiness which money cannot obtain Being by this scheme of education secluded  from all with whom she might converse on terms of equality she heard none of those intimations of her defects which envy petulance or anger produce among children where they are not afraid of telling what they think  TURPICULA  saw nothing but obsequiousness and heard nothing but commendations because few approached her who did not consider it as their interest to please None are so little acquainted with the ruling passions of the heart as not to know that woman's first wish is to be handsome and that consequently the readiest method of obtaining her kindness is to praise her beauty  Turpicula  had a distorted shape and a dark complexion yet the impudence of adulation ventured to tell her of the commanding dignity of her motion and the soft enchantment of her smile She was easily convinced that she was the delight or torment of every eye and that all who ventured to gaze upon her felt the fire of envy or love She therefore neglected the culture of an understanding which might have supplied the defects of her form and applied all her care to the decoration of  her person for she considered that more could judge of beauty than of wit and was like the rest of human beings in haste to be admired The desire of conquest naturally led her to the lists in which beauty signalizes her power She glittered at court fluttered in the park and talked loud in the frontbox but after a thousand experiments of her charms was at last convinced that she had been flattered and that her glass was honester than her maid

assist the counsels or conduct the wars of the posterity of  Timur  the first place was long held by  Morad  the son of  Hanuth Morad  having signalized himself in many battles and sieges  was rewarded with the government of a province from which the fame of his wisdom and moderation was wafted to the pinacles of  Agra  by the prayers of those whom his administration made happy The emperor called him into his presence and gave into his hand the keys of riches and the sabre of command The voice of  Morad  was heard from the cliffs of  Taurus  to the  Indian  ocean every tongue faultered in his presence and every eye was cast down before him  MORAD  lived many years in prosperity every day encreased his wealth and extended his influence The sages repeated his maxims the captains of thousands waited his commands Competition withdrew into the cavern of envy and discontent trembled at her own murmurs But human greatness is short and transitory as the odour of incense in the fire The sun grew weary of gilding the palaces of  Morad  the clouds of sorrow gathered round his head and the tempest of hatred roared about his dwelling  MORAD  saw ruin hastily approaching The first that forsook him were his poets  their example was followed by all those whom he had rewarded for contributing to his pleasures and only a few whose virtue had entitled them to favour were now to be seen in his hall or chambers He felt his danger and prostrated himself at the foot of the throne His accusers were confident and loud his friends stood contented with frigid neutrality and the voice of truth was overborn by clamour He was divested of his power deprived of his acquisitions and condemned to pass the rest of his life on his hereditary estate  MORAD  had been so long accustomed to crouds and business supplicants and flattery that he knew not how to fill up his hours in solitude he saw with regret the sun rise to force a new day on his eye for which he had no use and envied the savage that wanders in the desart because he has no time vacant from the calls of nature but is always chasing his prey or sleeping in his den  HIS discontent in time vitiated his constitution and a slow disease seized upon him  He refused physick neglected exercise and lay down on his couch peevish and restless rather afraid to dye than desirous to live His domesticks for a time redoubled their assiduities but finding that no officiousness could sooth nor exactness satisfy soon gave way to negligence and sloth and he that once commanded nations often languished in his chamber without an attendant  IN this melancholy state he commanded messengers to recal his eldest son  Abouzaid  from the army  Abouzaid  was alarmed at the account of his father's sickness and hasted by long journeys to his place of residence  Morad  was yet living and felt his strength return at the embraces of his son then commanding him to sit down at his bedside "  Abouzaid  " says he "thy father has no more to hope or fear from the inhabitants of the earth the cold hand of the angel of death is now upon him and the voracious grave howls for his prey Hear therefore the precepts of ancient experience let not my last instructions issue forth in vain Thou hast seen me happy and calamitous thou hast beheld my exaltation and my fall My power is  in the hands of my enemies my treasures have rewarded my accusers but my inheritance the clemency of the emperor has spared and my wisdom his anger could not take away Cast thine eyes round thee whatever thou beholdest will in a few hours be thine apply thine ear to my dictates and these possessions will promote thy happiness Aspire not to publick honours enter not the palaces of kings thy wealth will set thee above insult let thy moderation keep below envy Content thyself with private dignity diffuse thy riches among thy friends let every day extend thy beneficence and suffer not thy heart to be at rest till thou art loved by all to whom thou art known In the height of my power I said to defamation who will hear thee and to artifice what canst thou perform But my son despise not thou the malice of the weakest remember that venom supplies the want of strength and that the lion may perish by the puncture of an asp"  MORAD  expired in a few hours  Abouzaid  after the months of mourning determined  to regulate his conduct by his father's precepts and cultivate the love of mankind by every art of kindness and endearment He wisely considered that domestick happiness was first to be secured and that none have so much power of doing good or hurt as those who are present in the hour of negligence hear the bursts of thoughtless merriment and observe the  of unguarded passion He therefore augmented the pay of all his attendants and requited every exertion of uncommon diligence by supernumerary gratuities While he congratulated himself upon the fidelity and affection of his family he was in the night alarmed by robbers who being pursued and taken declared that they had been admitted by one of his servants the servant immediately confessed that he unbarred the door because another not more worthy of confidence was entrusted with the keys  ABOUZAID  was thus convinced that a dependant could not easily be made a friend and that while many were soliciting for the first rank of favour all those would be alienated whom he disappointed He therefore  resolved to associate with a few equal companions selected from among the chief men of the province With these he lived happily for a time till familiarity set them free from restraint and every man thought himself at liberty to indulge his own caprice and advance his own opinions They then disturbed each other with contrariety of inclinations and difference of sentiments and  Abouzaid  was necessitated to offend one party by concurrence or both by indifference  HE afterwards determined to avoid a close union with beings so discordant in their nature and to diffuse himself in a larger circle He practised the smile of universal courtesy and invited all to his table but admitted none to his retirements Many who had been rejected in his choice of friendship now refused to accept his acquaintance and of those whom plenty and magnificence drew to his table every one pressed forward toward intimacy thought himself overlooked in the croud and murmured because he was not distinguished above the rest By degrees all made advances and all resented repulse The table was then covered with delicacies in  vain the musick sounded in empty rooms and  Abouzaid  was left to form in solitude some new scheme of pleasure or security  RESOLVING now to try the force of gratitude he enquired for men of science whose merit was obscured by poverty His house was soon crouded with poets sculptors painters and designers who wantoned in unexperienced plenty and employed their powers in celebration of their patron But in a short time they forgot the distress from which they had been rescued and began to consider their deliverer as a wretch of narrow capacity who was growing great by works which he could not perform and whom they overpaid by condescending to accept his bounties  Abouzaid  heard their murmurs and dismissed them and from that hour continued blind to colours and deaf to panegyrick  AS the sons of art departed muttering threats of perpetual infamy  Abouzaid  who stood at the gate called to him  Hamet  the poet "  Hamet  " said he "thy ingratitude has put an end to my hopes and experiments I  have now learned the vanity of those labours which hope to be rewarded by human benevolence I shall henceforth do good and avoid evil without respect to the opinion of men and resolve to solicit only the approbation of that being whom alone we are sure to please by endeavouring to please him"  NUMB  TUESDAY  Jan    Cercus in Vitium flecti Monitoribus asper  HOR  To the RAMBLER  Dear Mr RAMBLER  I HAVE been four days confined to my chamber by a cold which has already kept me from three plays nine sales five shows and six cardtables and put me seventeen visits behind hand and the doctor tells my mamma that if I fret and cry it will settle in my head and I shall not be sit  to be seen these six weeks But dear Mr  Rambler  how can I help it at this very time  Melissa  is dancing with the prettiest gentlemanshe will breakfast with him tomorrow and then run to two auctions and hear compliments and have presents then she will be drest and visit and get a ticket to the play then go to cards and win and come home with two flambeaus before her chair Dear Mr  Rambler  who can bear it  MY aunt has just brought me a bundle of your papers for my amusement She says you are a philosopher and will teach me to moderate my desires and look upon the world with indifference But dear sir I do not wish nor intend to moderate my desires nor can I think it proper to look upon the world with indifference till the world looks with indifference on me I have been forced however to sit this morning a whole quarter of an hour with your paper before my face but just as my aunt came in  Phyllida  had brought me a letter from Mr  Trip  which I put within the leaves and read about  absence  and  inconsolableness  and  ardour  and  irresistible passion  and  eternal constancy  while my aunt  imagined that I was puzzling myself with your philosophy and often cried out when she saw me look confused "If there is any word that you do not understand child I will explain it"  DEAR soul how old people that think themselves wise may be imposed upon But it is fit that they should take their turn for I am sure while they can keep poor girls close in the nursery they tyrannise over our understanding in a very shameful manner and fill our imaginations with tales of terror only to make us live in quiet subjection and fansy that we can never be fase but by their protection  I HAVE a mamma and two aunts who have all been formerly celebrated for wit and beauty and are still generally admired by those that value themselves upon their understanding and love to talk of vice and virtue nature and simplicity and beauty and propriety but if there was not some hope of meeting me scarcely a creature would come near them that wears a fashionable coat These ladies Mr  Rambler  have had me under their government  fifteen years and a half and have all that time been endeavouring to deceive me by such representations of life as I cannot yet find to be true but which I knew not whether I ought to impute to ignorance or malice as it is possible the world may be much changed since they mingled in general conversation  BEING desirous that I should love books they told me that nothing but knowledge could make me an agreeable companion to men of sense or qualify me to distinguish the superficial glitter of vanity from the solid merit of understanding and that a habit of reading would enable me to fill up the vacuities of life without the help of trivial or dangerous amusements and preserve me from the snares of idleness and the inroads of temptation  BUT their principal intention seems to have been to make me afraid of men in which they succeeded so well for a time that I durst not look in their faces or be left alone with them in a parlour for they made me fansy that no man ever spoke but to deceive or looked but to allure that the  girl who suffered him that had once squeezed her hand to approach her a second time was on the brink of ruin and that she who answered a billet without consulting her relations gave love such power over her that she would certainly become either poor or infamous  FROM the time that my leadingstrings were taken off I scarce heard any mention of my beauty but from the milliner the mantuamaker and my own maid for my mamma never said more when she heard me commended but "The girl is very well" and then endeavoured to divert my attention by some enquiry after my needle or my book  IT is now three months since I have been suffered to pay and receive visits to dance at publick assemblies to have a place kept for me in the boxes and to play at lady  Racket  's rout and you may easily imagine what I think of those who have so long cheated me with false expectations disturbed me with sictitious terrors and concealed from me all that I have found to make the happiness of woman  I AM so far from perceiving the usefulness or necessity of books that if I had not dropped all pretensions to learning I should have lost Mr  Trip  whom I once frighted into another box by retailing some of  Dryden  's remarks upon a tragedy for Mr  Trip  declares that he hates nothing like hard words and I am sure there is not a better partner to be found his very walk is a dance I have talked once or twice among ladies about principles and ideas but they put their fans before their faces and told me I was too wise for them who for their part never pretended to read any thing but the playbill and then asked me the price of my best head  THOSE vacancies of time which are to be filled up with books I have never yet obtained for consider Mr  Rambler  I go to bed late and therefore cannot rise early as soon as I am up I dress for the gardens then walk in the park then always go to some sale or show or entertainment at the little theatre then must be dressed for dinner then must pay my visits then walk in the park then hurry to the play and from thence to the cardtable This is the general course of  the day when there happens nothing extraordinary but sometimes I ramble into the country and come back again to a ball sometimes I am engaged for a whole day and part of the night If at any time I can gain an hour by not being at home I have so many things to do so many orders to give to the milliner so many alterations to make in my cloaths so many visitants names to read over so many invitations to accept or refuse so many cards to write and so many fashions to consider that I am lost in confusion forced at last to let in company or step into my chair and leave half my affairs to the direction of my maid  THIS is the round of my day and when shall I either stop my course or so change it as to want a book I suppose it cannot be imagined that any of these diversions will be soon at an end There will always be gardens and a park and auctions and shows and playhouses and cards visits will always be paid and cloaths always be worn and how can I have time unemployed upon my hands  BUT I am most at a loss to guess for what purpose they related such tragick stories of the cruelty perfidy and artifices of men who if they ever were so malicious and destructive have certainly now reformed their manners I have not since my entrance into the world found one who does not profess himself devoted to my service and ready to live or die as I shall command him They are so far from intending to hurt me that their only contention is who shall be allowed most closely to attend and most frequently to treat me when different places of entertainment or schemes of pleasure are mentioned I can see the eyes sparkle and the cheeks glow of him whose proposals obtain my approbation he then leads me off in triumph adores my condescention and congratulates himself that he has lived to the hour of felicity Are these Mr  Rambler  creatures to be seared Is it likely that any injury will be done me by those who can enjoy life only while I favour them with my presence  AS little reason can I yet find to suspect them of stratagems and fraud When I play at cards they never take advantage of my  mistakes nor exact from me a rigorous observation of the laws of the game Even Mr  Shuffle  a grave gentleman who has daughters older than myself plays with me so negligently that I am sometimes inclined to believe he loses his money by design and yet he is so fond of play that he says he will one day take me to his house in the country that we may try by ourselves who can conquer I have not yet promised him but when the town grows a little empty I shall think upon it for I want some trinkets like  Letitia  's to my watch I do not doubt my luck but must study some means of amusing my relations  FOR all these distinctions I find myself indebted to that beauty which I was never suffered to hear praised and of which therefore I did not before know the full value This concealment was certainly an intentional fraud for my aunts have eyes like other people and I am every day told that nothing but blindness can escape the influence of my charms Their whole account of that world which they pretend to know so well has been only one fiction entangled with another  and though the modes of life oblige me to continue some appearances of respect I cannot think that they who have been so clearly detected in ignorance or imposture have any right to the esteem veneration or obedience of  SIR Yours BELLARIA  NUMB  SATURDAY  Jan    ANACREON  To the RAMBLER  SIR  I AM the son of a gentleman whose ancestors for many ages held the first rank in the county till at last one of them too  desirous of popularity set his house open to all that would enter it kept a table covered with continual profusion and distributed his beef and ale to such as chose rather to live upon the folly of others than their own labour with such thoughtless liberality that he left a third part of his estate mortgaged His successor a man of spirit scorned to impair his dignity by parsimonious retrenchments or to admit by a sale of his lands any participation of the rights of his manor he therefore made another mortgage to pay the interest of the former and pleased himself with the reflection that his son would have the hereditary estate without the diminution of an acre  NEARLY resembling this was the practice of my wise progenitors for many ages Every man boasted the antiquity of his family resolved to support the dignity of his birth and lived in splendor and plenty at the expence of his heir who sometimes by a wealthy marriage and sometimes by lucky legacies discharged part of the incumbrances and thought himself entitled to contract new debts and to leave to his children the same inheritance of embarrasment and distress  THUS the estate perpetually decayed the woods were felled by one the park ploughed by another the fishery let to farmers by a third at last the old hall was pulled down to spare the cost of reparation and part of the materials sold to build a small house with the rest We were now openly degraded from our original rank and my father's brother was allowed with less reluctance to serve an apprenticeship though we never reconciled ourselves heartily to the sound of haberdasher but always talked of warehouses and a merchant and when the wind happened to blow loud affected to pity the hazards of commerce and to sympathize with the solicitude of my poor uncle who had the true retailer's terror of adventure and never exposed himself or his property to any wider water than the  Thames  IN time however by continual profit and small expences he grew rich and began to turn his thoughts towards rank He hung the arms of the family over his parlourchimney pointed at a chariot decorated only with a cypher became of opinion that money could not make a gentleman resented the  petulance of upstarts told stories of alderman  Puff  's grandfather the porter wondered that there was no better method for regulating precedence wished for some dress peculiar to men of fashion and when his servant presented a letter always enquired whether it came from his brother the esquire  MY father was careful to send him game by every carrier which though the conveyance often cost more than the value was well received because it gave him an opportunity of calling his friends together describing the beauty of his brother's seat and lamenting his own folly whom no remonstrances could withhold from polluting his fingers with a shopbook  THE little presents which we sent were always returned with great munificence He was desirous of being the second founder of his family and could not bear that we should be any longer outshone by those whom we considered as climbers upon our ruins and usurpers of our fortune He furnished our house with all the elegance of fashionable expence and was careful to conceal his bounties  lest the poverty of his family should be suspected  AT length it happened that by misconduct like our own a large estate which had been purchased from us was again exposed to the best bidder My uncle delighted with an opportunity of reinstating the family in their possessions came down with treasures scarcely to be imagined in a place where commerce has not made large sums familiar and at once drove all the competitors away expedited the writings and took possession He now considered himself as superior to trade disposed of his stock and as soon as he had settled his oeconomy began to show his rural sovereignty by breaking the hedges of his tenants in hunting and seizing the guns or nets of those whose fortunes did not qualify them for sportsmen He soon afterwards solicited the office of sheriff from which all his neighbours were glad to be reprieved but which he regarded as a resumption of ancestral claims and a kind of restoration to blood after the attainder of a trade  MY uncle whose mind was so filled with this change of his condition that he found no want of domestick entertainment declared himself too old to marry and resolved to let the newly purchased estate fall into the regular channel of inheritance I was therefore considered as heir apparent and courted with officiousness and caresses by the gentlemen who had hitherto coldly allowed me that rank which they could not refuse depressed me with studied neglect and irritated me with ambiguous insults  I FELT not much pleasure from the civilities for which I knew myself indebted to my uncle's industry till by one of the invitations which every day now brought me I was induced to spend a week with  Lucius  whose daughter  Flavilla  I had often seen and admired like others without any thought of nearer approaches The inequality which had hitherto kept me at a distance being now levelled I was received with every evidence of respect  Lucius  told me the fortune which he intended for his favourite his lady detailed her virtues many odd accidents obliged us to be often together without company and I  soon began to find that they were spreading for me the nets of matrimony  FLAVILLA  was all softness and complaisance I who had been excluded by a narrow fortune from much acquaintance with the world and never been honoured before with the notice of so fine a lady was easily enamoured  Lucius  either perceived my passion or  Flavilla  betrayed it care was taken that our private meetings should be less frequent and my charmer confessed by her eyes how much pain she suffered from our restraint I renewed my visit upon every pretence but was not allowed one interview without witness at last I declared my passion to  Lucius  who received me as a lover worthy of his daughter and told me that nothing was wanting to his consent but that my uncle should settle his estate upon me I objected the indecency of encroaching on his life and the danger of provoking him by such an unseasonable demand  Lucius  seemed not to think decency of much importance but admitted the danger of displeasing and concluded that as he was now old and sickly we might without any inconvenience wait for his death  WITH this resolution I was better contented as it procured me the company of  Flavilla  in which the days passed away amidst continual rapture but in time I began to be ashamed of sitting idle in expectation of growing rich by the death of my benefactor and proposed to  Lucius  many schemes of raising my own fortune by such assistance as I knew my uncle willing to give me  Lucius  afraid lest I should change my affection in absence diverted me from my design by dissuasives to which my passion easily listened At last my uncle died and considering himself as neglected by me from the time that  Flavilla  took possession of my heart left his estate to my younger brother who was always hovering about his bed and relating stories of my pranks and extravagance my contempt of the commercial dialect and my impatience to be selling stock  MY condition was soon known and I was no longer admitted by the father of  Flavilla  I repeated the protestations of regard which had been formerly returned with so much ardour in a letter which she received privately but returned by her father's footman Contempt  has driven out my love and I am content to have purchased by the loss of fortune an escape from a harpy who has joined the artifices of age to the allurements of youth I am now going to pursue my former projects with a legacy which my uncle bequeathed me and if I succeed shall expect to hear of the repentance of  Flavilla  I am  SIR Yours c CONSTANTIUS  NUMB  TUESDAY  Jan    Laudis amore tumes sunt certa piacula quae te  Ter

prevalence of virtue or vice of wisdom or  folly Some will always mistake the degree of their own desert and some will desire that others may mistake it The cunning will have recourse to stratagem and the powerful to violence for the attainment of their wishes some will stoop to theft and others venture upon plunder  PRAISE is so pleasing to the mind of man that it is the original motive of almost all our actions The desire of commendation as of every thing else is varied indeed by innumerable differences of temper capacity and knowledge some have no higher wish than for the applause of a club some expect the acclamations of a county and some have hoped to fill the mouths of all ages and nations with their names Every man pants for the highest eminence within his view none however mean ever sinks below the hope of being distinguished by his fellowbeings and very few have by magnanimity or piety been so raised above it as to act wholly without regard to human censure or opinion  TO be praised therefore every man resolves but resolutions will not execute themselves  That which all think too parsimoniously distributed to their own claims they will not gratuitously squander upon others and some expedient must be tried by which praise may be gained before it can be enjoyed  AMONG the innumerable bidders for praise some are willing to purchase at the highest rate and offer ease and health fortune and life Yet even of these only a small part have gained what they so earnestly desired the student wastes away in meditation and the soldier perishes on the ramparts but unless some accidental advantage cooperates with merit neither perseverance nor adventure attract the attention of mankind and learning and bravery sink into the grave without honour or remembrance  BUT ambition and vanity generally expect to be gratified on easier terms It has been long observed that what is procured by skill or labour to the first possessor may be afterwards transferred for money and that the man of wealth may partake all the acquisitions of courage without hazard and all the  products of industry without fatigue It was easily discovered that riches would obtain praise among other conveniencies and that he whose pride was unluckily associated with laziness ignorance or cowardice needed only to pay the hire of a panegyrist and he might be regaled with periodical eulogies might determine at leisure what virtue or science he would be pleased to appropriate and be lulled in the evening with soothing ferenades or waked in the morning by sprightly gratulations  THE happiness which mortals receive from the celebration of beneficence which never relieved or eloquence which never persuaded dignity which never awed or elegance which never pleased ought not to be envied or disturbed when they are known honestly to pay for their entertainment But there are unmerciful exactors of adulation who withhold the wages of venality retain their encomiast from year to year by general promises and ambiguous blandishments and when he has run through the whole compass of flattery dismiss him with contempt because his vein of fiction is exhausted  A CONTINUAL feast of commendation is only to be obtained by merit or by wealth many are therefore obliged to content themselves with single morsels and recompense the infrequency of their enjoyment by excess and riot whenever fortune sets the banquet before them Hunger is never delicate they who are seldom gorged to the full with praise may be safely fed with gross compliments for the appetite must be satisfied before it is disgusted  IT is generally easy to find the moment at which vanity is eager for sustenance and all that impudence or servility can offer will be well received When any one complains of the want of what he is known to possess in an uncommon degree he certainly waits with impatience to be contradicted When the trader pretends anxiety about the payment of his bills or the beauty remarks how frightfully she looks then is the lucky moment to talk of riches or of charms of the death of lovers or the honour of a merchant  OTHERS there are yet more open and artless who instead of suborning a flatterer are content to supply his place and as some animals impregnate themselves swell with the praises which they hear from their own tongues  Recte is dicitur laudare sese cui nemo alius contigit laudator  "It is right says  Erasmus  that he whom no one else will commend should bestow commendations on himself" Of all the sons of vanity these are sure the happiest and greatest for what is greatness or happiness but independence on external influences exemption from hope or fear and the power of supplying every want from the common stores of nature which can neither be exhausted nor prohibited Such is the wise man of the stoicks such is the divinity of the epicureans and such is the flatterer of himself Every other enjoyment malice may destroy every other panegyrick envy may withhold but no human power can deprive the boaster of his own encomiums Infamy may hiss or contempt may growl the hirelings of the great may sollow fortune and the votaries of truth may attend on virtue but his pleasures still remain the same he can always listen with rapture to  himself and leave those who dare not repose upon their own attestation to be elated or depressed by chance and toil on in the hopeless task of fixing caprice and propitiating malice  THIS art of happiness has been long practised by periodical writers with little apparent violation of decency When we think our excellencies overlooked by the world or desire to recall the attention of the publick to some particular performance we sit down with great composure and write a letter to ourselves The correspondent whose character we assume always addresses us with the deference due to a superior intelligence proposes his doubts with a proper sense of his own inability offers an objection with trembling diffidence and at last has no other pretensions to our notice than his profundity of respect and sincerity of admiration his submission to our dictates and zeal for our success To such a reader it is impossible to refuse regard nor can it easily be imagined with how much alacrity we snatch up the pen which indignation or despair had condemned to inactivity  when we find such candour and judgment yet remaining in the world  A LETTER of this kind I had lately the honour of perusing in which though some of the periods were negligently closed and some expressions of familiarity were used which I thought might teach others to address me with too little reverence I was so much delighted with the passages in which mention was made ofuniversal learningunbounded geniussoul of  Homer    Pythagoras  and  Plato  solidity of thoughtaccuracy of distinctionelegance of combinationvigour of fancystrength of reasonand regularity of compositionthat I had once determined to lay it before the publick Three times I sent it to the printer and three times I fetched it back My modesty with which I had hitherto contended was on the point of yielding when reflecting that I was about to waste panegyricks on myself which might be more profitably reserved for my patron I locked it up for a better hour in compliance with the farmer's principle who never eats at home what he can carry to the market  NUMB  SATURDAY  Jan    Si damnosa Senem juvat alea ludit et Haeres  Bullatus parvoque eadem quatit arma Fritillo  JUV  To the RAMBLER  SIR  THAT vanity which keeps every man important in his own eyes inclines me to believe that neither you nor your readers have yet forgotten the name of  Eumathes  who sent you a few months ago an account of his arrival at  London  with a young nobleman his pupil I shall therefore continue my narrative without preface or recapitulation  MY pupil in a very short time by his mother's countenance and direction accomplished himself with all those qualifications which constitute puerile politeness He became in a few days a perfect master of his hat which with a careless nicety he could put off or on without any need to adjust it  by a second motion This was not attained but by frequent consultations with his dancingmaster and constant practice before the glass for he had some rustick habits to overcome but what will not time and industry perform A fortnight more furnished him with all the airs and forms of familiar and respectful salutation from the clap on the shoulder to the humble bow he practises the stare of strangeness and the smile of condescension the solemnity of promise and the graciousness of encouragement as if he had been nursed at a levee and pronounces with no less propriety than his father the monosyllables of coldness and sonorous periods of respectful profession  HE immediately lost the reserve and timidity which solitude and study are apt to impress upon the most courtly genius was able to enter a crouded room with airy civility to meet the glances of a hundred eyes without perturbation and address those whom he never saw before with ease and confidence In less than a month his mother declared her satisfaction at his proficiency by a triumphant  observation that she believed  nothing would make him blush  THE silence with which I was contented to hear my pupil's praises gave the lady reason to suspect me not much delighted with his acquisitions but she attributed my discontent to the diminution of my influence and my fears of losing the patronage of the family and though she thinks favourably of my learning and morals she considers me as wholly unacquainted with the customs of the polite part of mankind and therefore not qualified to form the manners of a young nobleman or communicate the knowledge of the world This knowledge she comprises in the rules of visiting the history of the present hour an early intelligence of the change of fashions an extensive acquaintance with the names and faces of persons of rank and a frequent appearance in places of resort  ALL this my pupil persues with great application He is twice a day in the mall where he studies the dress of every man splendid enough to attract his notice and never comes home without some observation upon  sleeves buttonholes and embroidery At his return from the theatre he can give an account of the gallantries glances whispers smiles sighs flirts and blushes of every box so much to his mother's satisfaction that when I attempted to resume my character by enquiring his opinion of the sentiments and diction of the tragedy she at once repressed my criticism by telling me that  she hoped he did not go to lose his time in attending to the creatures on the stage  BUT his acuteness was most eminently signalized at the masquerade where he discovered his acquaintance through their disguises with such wonderful facility as has afforded the family an inexhaustible topick of conversation Every new visitor is informed how one was detected by his gait and another by the swing of his arms a third by the toss of his head and another by his favourite phrase nor can you doubt but these performances receive their just applause and a genius thus hastening to maturity is promoted by every art of cultivation  SUCH have been his endeavours and such his assistances that every trace of literature was soon obliterated He has changed his language with his dress and instead of endeavouring at purity or propriety has no other care than to catch the reigning phrase and current exclamation till by copying whatever is peculiar in the talk of all whose birth or fortune entitle them to imitation he has collected every fashionable barbarism of the present winter and speaks a dialect not to be understood among those who form their stile by poring upon authors  TO this copiousness of ideas and felicity of language he has joined such eagerness to lead the conversation that he is celebrated among the ladies as the prettiest gentleman that the age can boast of except that some who love to talk themselves think him too forward and others lament that with so much wit and knowledge he is not taller  HIS mother listens to his observations with her eyes sparkling and her heart beating and can scarcely contain in the most numerous assemblies the expectations which she has  formed of his future eminence Women by whatever fate always judge absurdly of the intellects of boys That vivacity and confidence which attract female admiration are seldom produced in the early part of life but by ignorance at least if not by stupidity for they proceed not from confidence of right but fearlesness of wrong Whoever has a clear apprehension must have quick sensibility and where he has no sufficient reason to trust his own judgment will proceed with doubt and caution because he perpetually dreads the disgrace of error The pain of miscarriage is naturally proportionate to the defire of excellence and therefore till men are hardened by long familiarity with reproach or have attained by frequent struggles the art of concealing or suppressing their emotions diffidence is found the inseparable associate of understanding  BUT so little distrust has my pupil of his own abilities that he has for some time professed himself a wit and tortures his imagination all occasions for burlesque and jocularity How he supports a character which perhaps no man ever assumed without repentance  may be easily conjectured Wit you know is the unexpected copulation of ideas the discovery of some occult relation between images in appearance remote from each other an effusion of wit therefore presupposes an accumulation of knowledge a memory stored with notions which the imagination may cull out to compose new assemblages Whatever may be the native vigour of the mind she can never form many combinations from few ideas as many changes can never be rung upon a few bells Accident may indeed sometimes produce a luckly parallel or a striking contrast but these gifts of chance are not frequent and he that has nothing of his own and yet condemns himself to needless expences must live upon loans or theft  THE indulgence which his youth has hitherto obtained and the respect which his rank secures have hitherto supplied the want of intellectual qualifications and he imagines that all admire who applaud and that all who laugh are pleased He therefore returns every day to the charge with encrease of courage though not of strength and practises all the tricks by which wit is counterfeited He lays  trains for a quibble he contrives blunders for his footman he adapts old stories to present characters he mistakes the question that he may return a smart answer he anticipates the argument that he may plausibly object when he has nothing to reply he repeats the last words of his antagonist then says "your humble servant" and concludes with a laugh of triumph  THESE mistakes I have honestly attempted to correct but what can be expected from reason unsupported by fashion splendour or authority He hears me indeed or appears to hear me but is soon rescued from the lecture by more pleasing avocations and shows diversions and caresses drive my precepts from his remembrance  HE at last imagines himself qualified to enter the world and has met with adventures in his first sally which I shall by your paper communicate to the publick  I am c EUMATHES  NUMB  TUESDAY  Jan    Nescit equo rudis  Haerere ingenuus Puer  Venarique timet ludere doctior  Seu Graeco

He that long delays any story which he has promised and suffers his auditor to torment himself with expectation will seldom be able to recompense the uneasiness or equal the hope which he suffers to be raised  FOR this reason I have already sent you the continuation of my pupil's history which though it contains no events very uncommon may be of use to other young men who are in too much haste to trust their own prudence  and quit the wing of protection before they are able to shift for themselves  WHEN he first settled in  London  he was so much bewildered in the enormous extent of the town so confounded by incessant noise and crowds and hurry and so terrified by rural narratives of the arts of sharpers the rudeness of the populace malignity of porters and treachery of coachmen that he was afraid to go beyond the door without an attendant and imagined his life in danger if he was obliged to pass the streets at night in any vehicle but his mother's chair  HE was therefore contented for a time that I should accompany him in all his excursions But his fear abated as he grew more familiar with its objects and the contempt to which his rusticity exposed him from such of his companions as had accidentally known the town longer obliged him to dissemble his remaining terrors  HIS desire of liberty made him now willing to spare me the trouble of observing his motions but knowing how much his ignorance  exposed him to mischief I thought it cruel to abandon him to the fortune of the town We went together every day to a coffeehouse where he met wits heirs and fops airy ignorant and thoughtless as himself with whom he had become acquainted at card tables and whom he considered as the only beings to be envied or admired What were their topics of conversation I could never discover for so much was their vivacity depressed by my intrusive seriousness that they seldom proceeded beyond the exchange of nods and shrugs an arch grin or a broken hint except when they could retire while I was looking on the papers to a corner of the room where they seemed to disburden their imaginations and commonly vented the superfluity of their sprightliness in a peal of laughter When they had tittered themselves into negligence I could sometimes overhear a few syllables such assolemn rascalacademical airssmoke the tutorcompany for gentlemenand other broken phrases by which I did not suffer my quiet to be disturbed for they never proceeded to avowed indignities but contented themselves to murmur  in secret and whenever I turned my eye upon them shrunk into stilness  HE was however desirous of withdrawing from the subjection which he could not venture to break and made a secret appointment to assist his companions in the persecution of a play His footman privately procured him a catcal on which he practised in a backgarret for two hours in the afternoon At the proper time a chair was called he pretended an engagement at lady  Flutter  's and hastened to the place where his critical associates had assembled They hurried away to the theatre full of malignity and denunciations against a man whose name they had never heard and a performance which they could not understand for they were resolved to judge for themselves and would not suffer the town to be imposed upon by scribblers In the pit they exerted themselves with great spirit and vivacity called out for the tunes of obscene songs talked loudly at intervals of  Shakespear  and  Johnson  played on their catcals a short prelude of terror clamoured vehemently for the prologue and clapped with  great dexterity at the first entrance of the players  TWO scenes they heard without attempting interruption but being no longer able to restrain their impatience they then began to exert themselves in groans and hisses and plied their catcals with incessant diligence so that they were soon considered by the audience as disturbers of the house and some who sat near them either provoked at the obstruction of their entertainment or desirous to preserve the author from the mortification of seeing his hopes destroyed by children snatched away their instruments of criticism and by the seasonable vibration of a stick subdued them instantaneously to decency and silence  TO exhilarate themselves after this vexatious deseat they posted to a tavern where they recovered their alacrity and after two hours of obstreperous jollity burst out big with enterprize and panting for some occasion to signalize their prowess They proceeded vigorously through two streets and with very little opposition dispersed a rabble of drunkards less daring than themselves then  rolled two watchmen in the kennel and broke the windows of a tavern in which the fugitives took shelter At last it was determined to march up to a row of chairs and demolish them for standing on the pavement the chairmen formed a line of battle and blows were exchanged for a time with equal courage on both sides At last the assailants were overpowered and the chairmen when they knew their captives brought them home by force  THE young gentleman next morning hung his head and was so much ashamed of his outrages and defeat that perhaps he might have been checked in his first follies had not his mother partly in pity of his dejection and partly in approbation of his spirit relieved him from his perplexity by paying the damages privately and discouraging all animadversion and reproof  THIS indulgence could not wholly preserve him from the remembrance of his disgrace nor at once restore his confidence and elation He was for three days silent modest and compliant and thought himself neither too wise for instruction nor too manly for restraint  But his levity overcame this salutary sorrow he began to talk with his former raptures of masquerades taverns and frolicks blustered when his wig was not combed with exactness and threatened destruction to a taylor who had mistaken his directions about the pocket  I KNEW that he was now rising again above controul and that this inflation of spirits would burst out into some mischievous absurdity I therefore watched him with great attention but one evening having attended his mother at a visit he withdrew himself unsuspected while the company was engaged at cards His vivacity and officiousness were soon missed and his return impatiently expected supper was delayed and conversation suspended every coach that rattled through the street was expected to bring him and every servant that entered the room was examined concerning his departure At last the lady returned home and was with great difficulty preserved from fits by spirits and cordials The family was dispatched a thousand ways without success and the house was filled with distraction till as we were  deliberating what farther measures to take he returned from a petty gamingtable with his coat torn and his head broken without his sword snuffbox sleevebuttons and watch  OF this loss or robbery he gave little account but instead of sinking into his former shame endeavoured to support himself by surliness and asperity "He was not the first that had played away a few trifles and of what use were birth and fortune if they would not admit some sallies and expences" His mamma was so much provoked by the cost of this prank that she would neither palliate nor conceal it and his father after some threats of rustication which his fondness would not suffer him to execute reduced the allowance of his pocket that he might not be tempted by plenty to prosusion This method would have succeeded in a place where there are no pandars to folly and extravagance but was now likely to have produced pernicious consequences for we have discovered a treaty with a broker whose daughter he seems disposed to marry on condition that he shall be supplied with present  money for which he is to repay thrice the value at the death of his father  THERE was now no time to be lost A domestick consultation was immediately held and he was doomed to pass two years in the country but his mother touched with his tears declared that she thought him too much a man to be any longer confined to his book and he therefore begins his travels tomorrow under a  French  governor  I am c EUMATHES  NUMB  SATURDAY  Feb    Multa ferunt anni venientes commoda secum  Multa recedentes

disposed him to change  WHOEVER reviews the state of his own mind from the dawn of manhood to its decline and considers what he pursued or dreaded slighted or esteemed at different periods of his age will have no reason to imagine such changes of sentiment peculiar to any station or character Every man however careless and inattentive has conviction forced upon him the lectures of time obtrude themselves upon the most unwilling or dissipated auditor and by comparing our past with our present thoughts we perceive that we have changed our minds though perhaps we cannot discover when the alteration happened or by what causes it was produced  THIS revolution of sentiments occasions a perpetual contest between the old and young They who imagine themselves entitled to veneration and obedience by the prerogative of longer life are generally inclined to treat the notions of those whose conduct they superintend with superciliousness and contempt for want of considering that the future and the  past have different appearances that the disproportion will always be great between expectation and enjoyment between new possession and satiety that the truth of many maxims of age gives too little pleasure to be allowed till it is felt and that the miseries of life would be encreased beyond all human power of endurance if we were to enter the world with the same opinions as we carry from it  WE naturally indulge those ideas that please us Hope will predominate in every mind till it has been suppressed by frequent disappointments The youth who has not discovered how many evils are continually hovering about us when he is set free from the shackles of discipline looks abroad into the world with rapture he sees an elysian region open before him so variegated with beauty and so stored with pleasure that his care is rather to accumulate good than to shun evil he stands distracted by different forms of delight and has no other doubt than which path to follow of those which all lead equally to the bowers of happiness  HE who has seen only the superficies of life believes every thing to be what it appears and rarely suspects that external splendor conceals any latent sorrow or vexation He never imagines that there may be greatness without safety affluence without content jollity without friendship and solitude without peace He fancies himself permitted to cull the blessings of every condition and to leave its inconveniencies to the idle and the ignorant He is inclined to believe no man miserable but by his own fault and seldom looks with much pity upon failings or miscarriages because he thinks them willingly admitted or negligently incurred  IT is impossible without pity and contempt to hear a youth of generous sentiments and warm imagination declaring in the moment of openness and confidence his designs and expectations Because long life is possible he considers it as certain and therefore promises himself all the changes of happiness and provides gratifications for every desire He is for a time to give himself wholly to frolick and diversion to range the world in search of pleasure to delight every eye to gain every heart and to be celebrated equally for his  pleasing levities and solid attainments his deep reflections and his sparkling repartees He then elevates his views to nobler enjoyments and finds all the scattered excellencies of the female world united in a woman who prefers his addresses to wealth and titles he is afterwards to engage in business to dissipate difficulty and overpower opposition to climb by the mere force of merit to fame and greatness and reward all those who countenanced his rise or paid due regard to his early excellence At last he will retire in peace and honour contract his views to domestick pleasures form the manners of children like himself observe how every year expands the beauty of his daughters and how his sons catch ardour from their father's history he will give laws to the neighbourhood dictate axioms to posterity and leave the world an example of wisdom and of happiness  WITH hopes like these he sallies jocund into life to little purpose is he told that the condition of humanity admits no pure and unmingled happiness that the exuberant gaiety of youth ends in poverty or disease that uncommon qualifications and contrarieties of  excellence produce envy equally with applause that whatever admiration and fondness may promise him he must marry a wife like the wives of others with some virtues and some faults and be as often disgusted by her vices as delighted by her elegance that if he adventures into the circle of action he must expect to encounter men as artful as daring as resolute as himself that of his children some may be deformed and others vicious some may disgrace him by their follies some offend him by their insolence and some exhaust him by their profusion He hears all this with obstinate incredulity and wonders by what malignity old age is influenced that it cannot forbear to fill his ears with predictions of misery  AMONG other pleasing errors of young minds is the opinion of their own importance He that has not yet remarked how little attention his contemporaries can spare from their own affairs conceives all eyes turned upon himself and imagines every one that approaches him to be an enemy or a follower an admirer or a spy He therefore lives in perpetual constraint and considers  his fame as involved in the event of every action Many of the virtues and vices of youth proceed from this quick sense of reputation This it is that gives firmness and constancy fidelity and disinterestedness and it is this that kindles resentment for slight injuries and dictates all the principles of sanguinary honour  BUT as time brings him forward into the world he soon discovers that he only shares fame or reproach with innumerable partners that he is left unmarked in the obscurity of the croud and that what he does whether good or bad though it may produce a short commotion soon gives way to new objects of regard He then easily sets himself free from the anxieties of reputation and considers praise or censure as a transient breath which while he hears it is passing away without any lasting mischief or advantage  IN youth it is common to measure right and wrong by the opinion of the world and in age to act without any measure but interest and to lose shame without substituting virtue  SUCH is the condition of life that something is always wanting to happiness In youth we have warm hopes which are soon blasted by rashness and negligence and great designs which are defeated by inexperience In age we have knowledge and prudence without spirit to exert or motives to prompt them we are able to plan schemes and regulate measures but have not time remaining to bring them to completion  NUMB  TUESDAY  Feb    Cujus Vulturis hoc erit cadaver  MART  To the RAMBLER  SIR  I BELONG to an order of mankind considerable at least for their number to which your notice has never been formally extended though we seem equally entitled to regard with those triflers who have supplied  you with topicks of amusement or instruction I am Mr  Rambler  a legacyhunter and as every man is willing to think well of the tribe in which his name is registered you will forgive my vanity if I remind you that the legacyhunter however degraded by an illcompounded appellation in our barbarous language was known as I am told in ancient  Rome  by the sonorous titles of  Captator  and  Haeredipeta  MY father was an attorney in the country who married his master's daughter in hopes of a fortune which he did not obtain having been as he afterwards discovered chosen by her only because she had no better offer and was afraid of service I was the first offspring of a marriage thus reciprocally fraudulent and therefore could not be expected to inherit much dignity or generosity and if I had not from nature was not likely ever to attain them for in the years which I spent at home I never heard any reason for action or forbearance but that we should gain money or lose it nor was taught any other stile of commendation than that Mr  Sneaker  is a warm  man Mr  Gripe  has done his business and needs care for nobody  MY parents though otherwise not great philosophers knew the force of early education and took care that the blank of my understanding should be filled with impressions of the value of money My mother used upon all occasions to inculcate some salutary axioms such as might incite me  to keep what I had    and get what I could  she informed me that we were in a world where  all must catch that catch can  and as I grew up stored my memory with deeper observations restrained me from the usual puerile expences by remarking that  many a little made a mickle  and when I envied the finery of any of my neighbours told me that  brag was a good dog    but holdfast was a better  I WAS soon fagacious enough to discover that I was not born to great wealth and having heard no other name for happiness was sometimes inclined to repine at my condition But my mother always relieved me by saying that there was money enough in the family that  it was good to be of kin to  means  that I had nothing to do but to please my friends and I might come to hold up my head with the best squire in the country  THESE splendid expectations arose from our alliance to three persons of considerable fortune My mother's aunt had attended on a lady who when she died rewarded her officiousness and fidelity with a large legacy My father had two relations of whom one had broken his indentures and ran to sea from whence after an absence of thirty years he returned with ten thousand pounds and the other had lured an heiress out of a window who dying of her first child had left him her estate on which he lived without any other care than to collect his rents and preserve from poachers that game which he could not kill himself  THESE hoarders of money were visited and courted by all who had any pretence to approach them and received presents and compliments from cousins who could scarcely tell the degree of their relation But we had peculiar advantages which encouraged us to hope that we should by degrees easily supplant  our competitors My father by his profession made himself necessary in their affairs for the sailor and the chambermaid he enquired out mortgages and securities and wrote bonds and contracts and had endeared himself to the old woman who once rashly lent a hundred pounds without consulting him by informing her that her debtor was on the point of bankrupcy and posting so expeditiously with an execution that all the other creditors were defrauded  TO the squire he was a kind of steward and had distinguished himself in his office by his address in raising the rents his inflexibility in distressing the tardy tenants and his acuteness in fetting the parish free from burthensome inhabitants by shifting them off to some other settlement  BUSINESS made frequent attendance necessary trust soon produced intimacy and success gave a claim to kindness so that we had opportunity to practise all the arts of flattery and endearment My mother who could not support the thought of losing any thing determined that all their fortunes should center  in me and in the prosecution of her schemes took care to inform me that  nothing costs less than good words  and that it is comfortable to leap into an estate which another has got  SHE trained me by these precepts to the utmost ductility of obedience and the closest attention to profit At an age when other boys are sporting in the fields or murmuring in the school I was contriving some new method of paying my court enquiring the age of my future benefactors or considering how I should employ their legacies  IF our eagerness of money could have been satisfied with the possessions of any one of my relations they might perhaps have been obtained but as it was impossible to be always present with all three our competitors were busy to efface any trace of affection which we might have left behind and since there was not on any part such superiority of merit as could enforce a constant and unshaken preference whoever was the last that flattered or obliged had for a time the ascendant  MY relations maintained a regular exchange of courtesy took care to miss no occasion of condolence or congratulation and sent presents at stated times but had in their hearts not much esteem for one another The seaman looked with contempt upon the squire as a milksop and a landman who had lived without knowing the points of the compass or seeing any part of the world beyond the countytown and whenever they met would talk of longitude and latitude and circles and tropicks would scarcely tell him the hour without some mention of the horizon and meridian nor shew him the news without detecting his ignorance of the situation of other countries  THE squire considered the sailor as a rude uncultivated savage with little more of human than his form and diverted himself with his ignorance of all common objects and affairs when he could persuade him to go into the field he always exposed him to the sportsmen by sending him to look for game in improper places and once prevailed upon him to be present at the races only that he might show the gentlemen how a sailor sat upon a horse  THE old gentlewoman thought herself wiser than both for she lived with no servant but a maid and saved her money The others were indeed sufficiently frugal but the squire could not live without dogs and horses and the sailor never suffered the day to pass but over a bowl of punch to which as he was not critical in the choice of his company every man was welcome that could roar out a catch or tell a story  ALL these however I was to please an arduous task but what will not youth and avarice undertake I had an unresisting suppleness of temper and an insatiable wish for riches I was perpetually instigated by the ambition of my parents and assisted occasionally by their instructions What these advantages enabled me to perform shall be told in the next letter of  Yours c CAPTATOR  NUMB  SATURDAY  Feb    Nil mihi das vivus dicis post fata daturum  Si non insanis scis Maro quid cupiam  MART  To the RAMBLER  SIR  YOU who must have observed the inclination which almost every man however unactive or insignificant discovers of representing his life as distinguished by extraordinary eventswill not wonder that  Captator  thinks his narrative important enough to be continued Nothing is more common than for these to tease their companions with their history who have neither done nor suffered any thing that can excite curiosity or afford instruction  AS I was taught to flatter with the first essays of speech and had very early lost every other passion in the desire of money I began my pursuit with omens of success for  I  divided  my officiousness so judiciously among my relations that I was equally the favourite of all When any of them entered the door I went to welcome him with raptures when he went away I hung down my head and sometimes entreated to go with him with so much importunity that I very narrowly escaped a consent which I dreaded in my heart When at an annual entertainment they were all together I had a harder task but plied them so impartially with caresses that none could charge me with neglect and when they were wearied with my fondness and civilities I was always dismissed with money to buy playthings  LIFE cannot be kept at a stand the years of innocence and prattle were soon at an end and other qualifications were necessary to recommend me to continuance of kindness It luckily happened that none of my friends had high notions of booklearning The sailor hated to see tall boys shut up in a school when they might more properly be seeing the world and making their fortunes and was of opinion that when the first rules of arithmetick were known all that was necessary to make a  man complete might be learned on shipboard The squire only insisted that so much scholarship was indispensably necessary as might confer ability to draw a lease and read the courthands and the old chambermaid declared loudly her contempt of books and her opinion that they only took the head off the main chance  TO unite as well as we could all their systems I was bred at home Each was taught to believe that I followed his directions and I gained likewise as my mother observed this advantage that I was always in the way for she had known many favourite children sent to schools or academies and forgotten  AS I grew fitter to be trusted to my own discretion I was often dispatched upon various pretences to visit my relations which directions from my parents how to ingratiate myself and drive away competitors  I WAS from my infancy considered by the sailor as a promising genius because I liked punch better than wine and I took care to improve this prepossession by continual enquiries  about the art of navigation the degree of heat and cold in different climates the profits of trade and the dangers of shipwreck I admired the courage of the seamen and gained his heart by importuning him for a recital of his adventures and a sight of his foreign curiosities I listened with an appearance of close attention to stories which I could already repeat and at the close never failed to express my resolution to visit distant countries and my contempt of the cowards and drones that spend all their lives in their native parish though I had in reality no desire of any thing but money nor ever felt the stimulations of curiosity or ardour of adventure but would contentedly have passed the years of  Nestor  in receiving rents and lending upon mortgages  THE squire I was able to please with less hypocrisy for I really thought it pleasant enough to kill the game and eat it Some arts of falshood however the  hunger of gold  persuaded me to practise by which though no other mischief was produced the purity of my thoughts was vitiated and the reverence for truth gradually destroyed I sometimes purchased fish and pretended to have caught  them I hired the countrymen to show me partridges and then gave my uncle intelligence of their haunt I learned the seats of hares at night and discovered them in the morning with sagacity that raised the wonder and envy of old sportsmen One only obstruction to the advancement of my reputation I could never fully surmount I was naturally a coward and was therefore always left shamefully behind when there was a necessity to leap a hedge to swim a river or force the horses to their utmost speed but as these exigencies did not frequently happen I maintained my honour with sufficient success and was never left out of a hunting party  THE old chambermaid was not so certainly nor so easily pleased for she had no predominant passion but avarice and was therefore cold and inaccessible She had no conception of any virtue in a young man but that of saving his money When she heard of my exploits in the field she would shake her head and enquire how much I should be the richer for all my performances and lament that so much should be spent upon dogs and horses If the sailor told her of my inclination  to travel she was sure there was no place like  England  and could not imagine why any man that can live in his own country should leave it This sullen and frigid being I found means however to propitiate by frequent commendations of frugality and perpetual care to avoid expence  FROM the sailor was our first and most considerable expectation for he was richer than the chambermaid and older than the squire He was so aukward and bashful among women that we concluded him secure from matrimony and the noisy fondness with which he used to welcome me to his house made us imagine that he would look out for no other heir and that we had nothing to do but wait patiently for his death But in the midst of our triumph my uncle saluted us one morning with a cry of transport and clapping his hand hard on my shoulder told me I was a happy fellow to have a friend like him in the world for he came to fit me out for a voyage with one of his old acquaintances I turned pale and trembled my father told him that he believed my constitution not fitted to the sea and my mother bursting into tears cried out  that her heart would break if she lost me All this had no effect the sailor was wholly insusceptive of the softer passions and without regard to tears or arguments persisted in his resolution to make me a man  WE were obliged to comply in appearance and preparations were accordingly made I took leave of my friends with great alacrity proclaimed the beneficence of my uncle with the highest strains of gratitude and rejoiced at the opportunity now put into my hands of gratifying my thirst of knowledge But a week before the day appointed for my departure I fell sick by my mother's direction and refused all food but what she privately brought me whenever my uncle visited me I was lethargick or delirious but took care in my raving fits to talk incessantly of travel and merchandize The room was kept dark the table was filled with vials and gallipots my mother was with difficulty persuaded not to endanger her life with nocturnal attendance my father lamented the loss of the profits of the voyage and such superfluity of artifice was employed as perhaps might have discovered the cheat to a man  of penetration But the sailor unacquainted with subtilties and stratagems was easily deluded and as the ship could not stay for my recovery sold the cargo and left me to reestablish my health at leisure  I WAS sent to regain my flesh in a purer air lest it should appear never to have been wasted and in two months returned to deplore my disappointment My uncle pitied my dejection and bid me prepare myself against next year for no landlubber should ever touch his money  AREPRIEVE however was obtained and perhaps some new stratagem might have succeeded another spring but my uncle unhappily made amorous advances to my mother's maid who to promote so advantageous a match discovered the secret with which only she had been entrusted He stormed and raved and declaring that he would have heirs of his own and not give his substance to cheats and cowards married the girl in two days and has now four children  COWARDICE is always scorned and deceit universally detested I found my friends if not wholly alienated at least cooled in their affection the squire though he did not wholly discard me was less fond and often enquired when I would go to sea I was obliged to bear his insults and endeavoured to rekindle his kindness by assiduity and respect but all my care was vain he died without a will and the estate devolved to the legal heir  THUS has the folly of my parents condemned me to spend in flattery and attendance those years in which I might have been qualified to place myself above hope or fear I am arrived at manhood without any useful art or generous sentiment and if the old woman should likewise at last deceive me am in danger at once of beggary and ignorance  I am c CAPTATOR  NUMB

cynical as to deny the value or usefulness of natural philosophy or to have lived in this age of enquiry and experiment without any attention to the wonders every day produced by the pokers of magnetism and the wheels of electricity At least I may be allowed to hope that since nothing is more contrary to moral excellence than Envy you will not refuse to promote  the happiness of others merely because you cannot partake of their enjoyments  IN confidence therefore that your ignorance has not made you an enemy to knowledge I offer you the honour of introducing an adept to the notice of the publick an adept who having long laboured for the benefit of mankind is not willing like too many of his predecessors to conceal his secrets in the grave  MANY have signalized themselves by melting their estates in crucibles I was born to no fortune and therefore had only my mind and body to devote to knowledge and the gratitude of posterity will attest that neither mind nor body have been spared I have sat whole weeks without sleep by the side of an athanor to watch the moment of projection I have made the first experiment in nineteen diving engines of new construction I have fallen eleven times speechless under the shock of electricity I have twice dislocated my limbs and once fractured my skull in essaying to fly and four times endangered my life by submitting to the transfusion of blood  IN the first period of my studies I exerted the powers of my body more than those of my mind and was not without hopes that fame might be purchased by a few broken bones without the toil of thinking but having been shattered by some violent experiments and constrained to confine myself to my books I passed six and thirty years in searching the treasures of ancient wisdom but am at last amply recompensed for all my perseverance  THE curiosity of the present race of philosophers after having been long exercised upon electricity has been lately transferred to Magnetism the qualities of the loadstone have been investigated if not with much advantage yet with great applause and as the highest praise of art is to imitate nature I hope no man will think the makers of artificial magnets celebrated or reverenced above their deserts  I HAVE for some time employed myself in the same practice but with deeper knowledge and more extensive views While my contemporaries were touching needles and raising weights or busying themselves with  inclination and variation I have been examining those qualities of magnetism which may be applied to the accommodation and happiness of common life I have left to inferior Understandings the care of conducting the sailor through the hazards of the ocean and reserved to myself the more difficult and illustrious province of preserving the connubial compact from violation and setting mankind free for ever from the danger of supposititious children and from the torments of fruitless vigilance and anxious suspicion  TO defraud any man of his due praise is unworthy of a philosopher I shall therefore openly confess that I owe the first hint of this inestimable secret to the rabbi  Abraham Ben Hannase  who in his treatise of precious stones has left this account of the magnet  c "The calamita or loadstone that attracts iron produces many bad fantasies in man Women fly from this stone If therefore any husband be disturbed with jealousy and fear lest his wife converses with other men let him lay this stone upon her while she is asleep If she be pure she will when she wakes clasp  her husband fondly in her arms but if she be guilty she will fall out of bed and run away"  WHEN first I read this wonderful passage I could not easily conceive why it had remained hitherto unregarded in such a zealous competition for magnetical fame It would surely be unjust to suspect that any of the candidates are strangers to the name or works of rabbi  Abraham  or to conclude from a late edict of the royal society in favour of the  English  language that philosophy and literature are no longer to act in concert Yet how should a quality so useful escape promulgation but by the obscurity of the language in which it was delivered Why are footmen and chambermaids paid on every side for keeping secrets which no caution nor expence could secure from the allpenetrating magnet Or why are so many witnesses summoned and so many artifices practised to discover what so easy an experiment would infallibly reveal  FULL of this perplexity I read the lines of  Abraham  to a friend who advised me not to expose my life by a mad indulgence of the  love of fame he warned me by the fate of  Orpheus  what knowledge or genius could give no protection to the invader of female prerogatives assured me that neither the armour of  Achilles  nor the antidote of  Mithridates  would be able to preserve me and counselled me if I could not live without renown to attempt the acquisition of universal empire in which the honour would perhaps be equal and the danger certainly be less  I a solitary student pretend not to much knowledge of the world but am unwilling to think it so generally corrupt as that a scheme for the detection of incontinence should bring any danger upon its inventor My friend has indeed told me that all the women will be my enemies and that however I flatter myself with hopes of defence from the men I shall certainly find myself deserted in the hour of danger Of the young men said he some will be afraid of sharing the disgrace of their mothers and some the danger of their mistresses of those who are married part are already convinced of the falshood of their wives and part shut  their eyes to avoid conviction few ever sought for virtue in marriage and therefore few will try whether they have found it Almost every man is careless or timorous and to trust is safer than to examine  THESE observations discouraged me till I began to consider what reception I was likely to find among the ladies whom I have reviewed under the three classes of maids wives and widows and cannot but hope that I may obtain some countenance among them The single ladies I suppose universally ready to patronize my method by which connubial wickedness may be detected since no woman marries with a previous design to be unfaithful to her husband And to keep them steady in my cause I promise never to sell one of my magnets to a man who steals a girl from school marries a woman forty years younger than himself or employs the authority of parents to obtain a wife without her own consent  AMONG the married ladies notwithstanding the insinuations of slander I yet resolve to believe that the greater part are my  friends and am at least convinced that they who demand the test and appear on my side will supply by their spirit the deficiency of their numbers and that their enemies will shrink and quake at the sight of a magnet as the slaves of  Scythia  fled from the scourge  THE widows will be confederated in my favour by their curiosity if not by their virtue for it may be observed that women who have outlived their husbands always think themselves entitled to superintend the conduct of young wives and as they are themselves in no danger from this magnetick trial I shall expect them to be eminently and unanimously zealous in recommending it  WITH these hopes I shall in a short time offer to sale magnets armed with a particular metallick composition which concentrates their virtue and determines their agency It is known that the efficacy of the magnet in common operations depends much upon its armature and it cannot be imagined that a stone naked or cased only in the common manner will discover the virtues ascribed to it by rabbi  Abraham  The  secret of this metal I shall carefully conceal and therefore am not afraid of imitators nor shall trouble the offices with solicitations for a patent  I SHALL sell them of different sizes and various degrees of strength I have some of a bulk proper to be hung at the bed's head as scarecrows and some so small that they may be easily concealed Some I have ground into oval forms to be hung at watches and some for the curious I have set in weddingrings that ladies may never want an attestation of their innocence Some I can produce so sluggish and inert that they will not act before the third failure and others so vigorous and animated that they exert their influence against unlawful wishes if they have been willingly and deliberately indulged As it is my practice honestly to tell my customers the properties of my magnets I can judge by their choice of the delicacy of their sentiments Many have been contented to spare cost by purchasing only the lowest degree of efficacy and all have started with terror from those which operate upon the thoughts One young lady only sitted on a  ring of the strongest energy and declared that she scorned to separate her wishes from her acts or allow herself to think what she was forbidden to practise  I am c HERMETICUS  NUMB  SATURDAY  Feb    Nemo petit modicis quae mittebantur amicis  A Seneca quae Piso bonus quae Cotta solebat  Largiri nempe et titulis et fascibus

infirmity of many minds that when any affliction oppresses them they have immediate recourse  to lamentation and complaint which though it can only be allowed reasonable when evils admit of remedy and then only when addressed to those from whom the remedy is expected yet seems even in hopeless and incurable distresses to be natural since those by whom it is not indulged imagine that they give a proof of extraordinary fortitude by suppressing it  I AM one of those who with the  Sancho  of  Cervantes  leave to higher characters the merit of suffering in silence and give vent without scruple to any sorrow that swells in my heart It is therefore to me a severe aggravation of a calamity when it is such as in the common opinion will not justify the acerbity of exclamation or support the solemnity of vocal grief Yet many pains are incident to a man of delicacy which the unfeeling world cannot be persuaded to pity and which when they are separated from their peculiar and personal circumstances will never be considered as important enough to claim attention or deserve redress  OF this kind will appear to gross and vulgar apprehensions the miseries which I endured in a morning visit to  Prospero  a man lately raised by a lucky project to wealth and grandeur and too much intoxicated by sudden elevation or too little polished by thought and conversation to enjoy his present fortune with elegance and decency  WE set out in the world together and for a long time mutually assisted each other in our exigencies as either happened to have money or influence beyond his immediate necessities You know that nothing generally endears men so much as participation of dangers and misfortunes I therefore always considered  Prospero  as united with me in the strongest league of kindness and imagined that our friendship was only to be broken by the hand of death I felt at his sudden shoot of success an honest and disinterested joy but as I want no part of his superfluities am not willing to descend from that equality in which we hitherto have lived  OUR intimacy was regarded by me as a dispensation from ceremonial visits and it  was so long before I saw him at his new house that he gently complained of my neglect and obliged me to come on a day appointed I kept my promise but found that the impatience of my friend arose not from any desire to communicate his happiness but to enjoy his superiority  WHEN I told my name at the door the footman went to see if his master was at home and by the tardiness of his return gave me reason to suspect that time was taken to deliberate He then informed me that  Prospero  desired my company and showed the staircase carefully secured by mats from the pollution of my feet The best apartments were ostentatiously set open that I might have a distant view of the magnificence which I was not permitted to approach and my old friend receiving me with all the insolence of condescension at the top of the stairs conducted me to a back room where he told me he always breakfasted when he had not great company  ON the floor where we sat lay a carpet covered with a cloth of which  Prospero  ordered  his servant to lift up a corner that I might contemplate the brightness of the colours and the elegance of the texture and asked me whether I had ever seen any thing so fine before I did not gratify his folly with any outcries of admiration but coldly bad the footman let down the cloth  WE then sat down and I began to hope that pride was glutted with persecution when  Prospero  desired that I would give the servant leave to adjust the cover of my chair which was slipt a little aside to show the damask he informed me that he had bespoke ordinary chairs for common use but had been disappointed by his tradesman I put the chair aside with my foot and drew another so hastily that I was entreated not to rumple the carpet  BREAKFAST was at last set and as I was not willing to indulge the peevishness that began to seize me I commended the tea  Prospero  then told me that another time I should taste his sinest sort but that he had only a very small quantity remaining and reserved  it for those whom he thought himself obliged to treat with particular respect  WHILE we were conversing upon such subjects as imagination happened to suggest he frequently digressed into directions to the servant that waited or made a slight enquiry after the jeweller or silversmith and once as I was pursuing an argument with some degree of earnestness he started from his posture of attention and ordered that if lord  Lofty  called on him that morning he should be shewn into the best parlour  MY patience was not yet wholly subdued I was willing to promote his satisfaction and therefore observed that the figures on the china were eminently pretty  Prospero  had now an opportunity of calling for his  Dresden  china which says he I always associate with my chased teakettle The cups were brought I was once disposed not to have looked upon them but my curiosity prevailed When I had examined them a little  Prospero  desired me to set them down for they who were accustomed only to common dishes seldom handled china with much care You will  I hope commend my philosophy when I tell you that I did not dash his baubles to the ground  HE was now so much elevated with his own greatness that he thought some humility necessary to avert the glance of envy and therefore told me with an air of soft composure that I was not to estimate life by external appearance that all these shining acquisitions had added little to his happiness that he still remembered with pleasure the days in which he and I were upon the level and had often in the moment of reflection been doubtful whether he should lose much by changing his condition for mine  I BEGAN now to be afraid lest his pride should by silence and submission be emboldened to insults that could not easily be born and therefore cooly considered how I should repress it without such bitterness of repoof as I was yet unwilling to use But he interrupted my meditation by asking leave to be dressed and told me that he had promised to attend some ladies in the park and if I was going the same way would take me in his chariot  I had no inclination to any other favours and therefore left him without any intention of seeing him again unless some misfortune should restore his understanding  I am c ASPER  THOUGH I am not wholly insensible of the provocations which my correspondent has received I cannot altogether commend the keenness of his resentment nor encourage him to persist in his resolution of breaking off all commerce with his old acquaintance One of the golden precepts of  Pythagoras  directs that  a friend should not be hated for little faults  and surely he upon whom nothing worse can be charged than that he mats his stairs and covers his carpet and sets out his finery to show before those whom he does not admit to use it has yet committed nothing that should exclude him from common degrees of kindness Such improprieties often proceed rather from stupidity than malice Those who thus shine only to dazzle are influenced merely by custom and example and neither examine nor are qualified to examine  the motives of their own practice or to state the nice limits between elegance and ostentation They are often innocent of the pain which their vanity produces and insult others when they have no worse purpose than to please themselves  HE that too much refines his delicacy will always endanger his quiet Of those with whom nature and virtue oblige us to converse some are ignorant of the arts of pleasing and offend when they design to caress some are negligent and gratify themselves without regard to the quiet of another some perhaps are malicious and feel no greater satisfaction in prosperity than that of raising envy and trampling inferiority But whatever be the motive of insult it is always best to overlook

in the writings of  Boyle  that the excellency of manufactures and the facility of labour would be much promoted if the various expedients and contrivances which lie concealed in private hands were by reciprocal communications made generally known for there are few operations that are not performed by one or other with some peculiar advantages which though singly of little importance would by conjunction and concurrence open new inlets to knowledge and give new powers to diligence  THERE are in like manner several moral excellencies distributed among the various classes of mankind which he that converses in the world should endeavour to assemble in himself It was said by the learned  Cujacius  that he never read more than one book by  which he was not instructed and he that shall enquire after virtue with ardour and attention will seldom find a man by whose example or sentiments he may not be improved  EVERY profession has some effential and appropriate Virtue without which there can be no hope of honour or success and which as it is more or less cultivated confers within its sphere of activity different degrees of merit and reputation As the astrologers range the subdivisions of mankind under the planets which they suppose to influence their lives the moralist may distribute them according to the virtues which they necessarily practise and consider them as distinguished by prudence or fortitude diligence or patience  So much are the modes of excellence settled by time and place that men may be heard boasting in one street of that which they would anxiously conceal in another The grounds of scorn and esteem the topicks of praise and satire are varied according to the several virtues or vices which the course of our lives has disposed us to admire or abhor  but he who is solicitous for his own improvement must not suffer his endeavours to be limited by local reputation but select from every tribe of mortals their characteristical virtues and constellate in himself the scattered graces which shine single in other men  THE chief praise to which a trader generally aspires is that of punctuality or an exact and rigorous observance of commercial promises and engagements nor is there any vice of which he so much dreads the imputation as of negligence and instability This is a quality which the interest of mankind requires to be diffused through all the ranks of life but which however useful and valuable many seem content to want it is considered as a vulgar and ignoble virtue below the ambition of greatness or attention of wit scarcely requisite among men of gaiety and spirit and sold at its highest rate when it is sacrificed to a frolick or a jest  EVERY man has daily occasion to remark what vexations and inconveniences arise from this privilege of deceiving one another The active and vivacious have so long disdained  the restraints of truth that promises and appointments have lost their cogency and both parties neglect their stipulations because each concludes that they will be broken by the other  NEGLIGENCE is first admitted in trivial affairs and strengthened by petty indulgencies He that is not yet hardened by custom ventures not on the violation of important engagements but thinks himself bound by his word in cases of property or danger though he allows himself to forget at what time he is to meet ladies in the park or at what tavern his friends are expecting him  THIS laxity of honour would be more tolerable if it could be restrained to the playhouse the ballroom or the cardtable yet even there it is sufficiently troublesome and darkens those moments with expectation suspense uncertainty and resentment which are set aside for the softer pleasures of life and from which we naturally hope for unmingled enjoyment and total relaxation But he that suffers the slightest breach in his morality can seldom tell what shall enter it or  how wide it shall be made when a passage is

principles His curiosity incited him to range from place to place and try all the varieties of conversation his elegance of address and fertility of ideas gained him friends wherever he appeared or at least he found the general kindness of reception always shown to a young man whose birth and fortune give him a claim to notice and who has neither by vice or folly destroyed his privileges  Aliger  was pleased with this general smile of mankind and being naturally gentle and flexible was industrious to preserve it by compliance and officiousness but did not suffer his desire of pleasing to vitiate his integrity It was his established maxim that a promise is never to be broken nor was it without long reluctance that he once suffered himself to be drawn away from a festal engagement by the importunity of another company  HE spent the evening as is usual in the rudiments of vice with perturbation and imperfect enjoyment and met his disappointed friends in the morning with confusion and excuses His companions not accustomed to such scrupulous anxiety laughed at his uneasiness compounded the offence for a bottle gave him courage to break his word again and again levied the penalty He ventured the same experiment upon another society and found them equally ready to consider it as a venial fault always incident to a man of quickness and gaiety till by degrees he began to think himself at liberty to follow the last invitation and was no longer shocked at the turpitude of falshood He made no difficulty to promise his presence at distant places and if listlesness happened to creep upon him would sit at home with great tranquility and has often while he sunk to sleep in a chair held ten tables in continual expectations of his entrance  HE found it so pleasant to live in perpetual vacancy that he soon dismissed his attention as an useless incumbrance and resigned himself to carelesness and dissipation without any  regard to the future or the past or any other motive of action than the impulse of a sudden desire or the attraction of immediate pleasure The absent were immediately forgotten and the hopes or fears of others had no influence upon his conduct He was in speculation compleatly just but never kept his promise to a creditor he was benevolent but always deceived those friends whom he undertook to patronize or assist he was prudent but suffered his affairs to be embarrassed for want of settling his accounts at stated times He courted a young lady and when the settlements were drawn took a ramble into the country on the day appointed to sign them He resolved to travel and sent his chests on shipboard but delayed to follow them till he lost his passage He was summoned as an evidence in a cause of great importance and loitered on the way till the trial was past It is said that when he had with great expence formed an interest in a borough his opponent contrived by some agents who knew his temper to lure him away on the day of election  HIS benevolence draws him into the commission of a thousand crimes which others less kind or civil would escape His courtesy invites application his promises produce dependence he has his pockets filled with petitions which he intends some time to deliver and enforce and his table covered with letters of request with which he purposes to comply but time slips imperceptibly away while he is either idle or busy his friends lose their opportunities and charge upon him their miscarriages and calamities  THIS character however contemptible is not peculiar to  Aliger  They whose activity of imagination is often shifting the scenes of expectation are frequently subject to such sallies of caprice as make all their actions fortuitous destroy the value of their friendship obstruct the efficacy of their virtues and set them below the meanest of those that persist in their resolutions execute what they design and perform what they have promised  NUMB  SATURDAY  Feb    CALLIMACHUS  AMONG those who have endeavoured the promotion of learning and the rectification of judgment it has been long customary to complain of the abuse of words which are often admitted to signify things so different that instead of assisting the understanding as vehicles of knowledge they produce error dissention and perplexity because what is affirmed in one sense is received in another  IF this ambiguity sometimes embarrasses the most solemn controversies and obscures the demonstrations of science it may well be expected to infest the pompous periods of declaimers whose purpose is often only to amuse with fallacies and change the colours  of truth and falshood or the musical compositions of poets whose stile is professedly figurative and whose art is imagined to consist in distorting words from their original meaning  THERE are few words of which more readers believe themselves to know the import than of  poverty  yet whoever studies the poets and philosophers will find such an account of the condition expressed by that term as his experience or observation will not easily discover to be true Instead of the meanness distress complaint anxiety and dependance which have hitherto been combined in his ideas of poverty he will read of content innocence and chearfulness of health and safety tranquility and freedom of pleasures not known but to men unencumbered with possessions and of sleep that sheds his balsamick anodynes only on the cottage Such are the blessings to be obtained by the resignation of riches that kings might descend from their thrones and generals retire from a triumph only to slumber undisturbed in the clysium of poverty  IF these authors do not deceive us nothing can be more absurd than that perpetual contest for wealth which keeps the world in commotion and fills almost every mind with stratagems and competition nor can any complaints be more justly censured than those which proceed from want of the gifts of fortune which we are taught by the great masters of moral wisdom to consider as golden shackles by which the wearer is at once disabled and adorned as luscious poisons which may for a time please the palate but soon betray their malignity by languor and by pain  IT is the great privilege of poverty to be happy unenvied to be healthful without physic and secure without a guard to obtain from the bounty of nature what the great and wealthy are compelled to procure by the help of artists and attendants of flatterers and spies  BUT it will be found upon a nearer view that they who extol the happiness of poverty do not mean the same state with those who deplore its miseries Poets have their imaginations  filled with ideas of magnificence and being accustomed to contemplate the downfal of empires or to contrive forms of lamentation for monarchs in distress rank all the classes of mankind in a state of poverty who make no approaches to the dignity of crowns To be poor in the epick language is only not to command the wealth of nations not to have fleets and armies in pay  VANITY has perhaps contributed to this impropriety of stile He that wishes to become a philosopher at a cheap rate easily gratifies his ambition by submitting to poverty when he does not feel it and by boasting his contempt of riches when he has already more than he enjoys He who would show the extent of his views and grandeur of his conceptions or discover his acquaintance with splendor and magnificence may talk like  Cowley  of an humble station and quiet obscurity of the paucity of nature's wants and the inconveniencies of superfluity and at last like him limit his desires to five hundred pounds a year A fortune indeed not exuberant when we compare it with the expences of pride and luxury but to which it little becomes  a philosopher to affix the name of poverty since no man can with any propriety be termed poor who does not see the greater part of mankind richer than himself  AS little is the general condition of human life understood by panegyrists and historians who amuse us with accounts of the poverty of heroes and sages Riches are of no value in themselves their use is discovered only in that which they procure They are not coveted unless by a few narrow understandings which confound the means with the end but for the sake of power influence and esteem or by some of less elevated and refined sentiments as necessary to sensual enjoyment  THE pleasures of luxury many have without uncommon virtue been able to despise even when affluence and idleness have concurred to tempt them and therefore he who feels nothing from indigence but the want of gratifications which he could not in any other condition make consistent with innocence has given no proof of eminent patience Esteem and influence every man desires but they are equally pleasing and equally  valuable by whatever means they are obtained and whoever has found the art of securing them without the help of money ought in reality to be accounted rich since he has all that riches can purchase to a wise man  Cincinnatus  though he lived upon a few acres cultivated by his own hand was sufficiently removed from all the evils generally comprehended under the name of poverty when his reputation was such that the voice of his country called him from his farm to take absolute command into his hand nor was  Diogenes  much mortified by his residence in a tub where he was honoured with the visit of  Alexander  the great  THE same fallacy has conciliated veneration to the religious orders When we behold a man abdicating the hope of terrestrial possessions and precluding himself by an irrevocable vow from the pursuit and acquisition of all that his fellow beings consider as worthy of wishes and endeavours we are immediately struck with the purity abstraction and firmness of his mind and regard him as wholly employed in securing the interests of futurity and devoid of any other care  than to gain at whatever price the surest passage to eternal rest  YET what can the votary be justly said to have lost of his present happiness If he resides in a convent he converses only with men whose condition is the same with his own he has from the munificence of the founder all the necessaries of life and is safe from that  destitution    which  Hooker declares to be  such an impediment to virtue as    till it be removed    suffereth not the mind of man to admit any other care  All temptations to envy and competition are shut out from his retreat he is not pained with the sight of unattainable dignity nor insulted with the bluster of insolence or the smile of forced familiarity If he wanders abroad the sanctity of his character amply compensates all other distinctions he is never seen but with reverence nor heard but with obedience  IT has been remarked that death though often desied in the field seldom fails to terrify when it approaches the bed of sickness in its natural horror so poverty

or imagination with immediate enjoyment and we are forced to supply its deficiences by recollection or anticipation  EVERY one has so often detected the fallaciousness of hope and the inconvenience of teaching himself to expect what a thousand accidents may preclude that when time has abated the confidence with which youth rushes out to take possession of the world we endeavour  or wish to find entertainment in the review of life and to repose upon real facts and certain experience This is perhaps one reason among many why age delights in narratives  BUT so full is the world of calamity that every source of pleasure is polluted and every retirement of tranquillity disturbed When time has supplied us with events sufficient to employ our thoughts it has mingled them with so many disasters that we shrink from their remembrance dread their intrusion upon our minds and fly from them to company and diversions  No man past the middle point of life can sit down to feast upon the pleasures of youth without finding the banquet imbittered by the cup of sorrow Many days of harmless frolick or nights of honest festivity will perhaps recur he may revive lucky accidents and pleasing extravagancies or if he has been engaged in scenes of action and acquainted with affairs of difficulty and vicissitudes of fortune may enjoy the nobler pleasure of looking back upon distress firmly supported  danger resolutely encountered and opposition artfully defeated  Eneas  properly comforts his companions when after the horrors of a storm they have landed on an unknown and desolate country with the hope that their miseries will be at some distant time recounted with delight There are few higher gratifications than that of reflection on surmounted evils when they were not incurred nor protracted by our fault and neither reproached us with cowardice nor guilt  BUT this felicity is almost always abated by the reflection that they with whom we should be most pleased to share it are now in the grave A few years make such havock in human generations that we soon see ourselves deprived of those with whom we entered the world and whom the participation of pleasures or fatigues endeared to our remembrance The man of enterprise recounts his adventures and expedients but is forced at the close of the relation to pay a sign to the names of those that contributed to his success he that passes his life among the gayer part of mankind has quickly his remembrance stored with remarks and repartees of wits whose  sprightliness and merriment are now lost in perpetual silence the trader whose industry has supplied the want of inheritance when he sits down to enjoy his fortune repines in solitary plenty at the absence of companions with whom he had planned out amusements for his latter years and the scholar whose merit after a long series of efforts raises him from obscurity looks round in vain from his exaltation for his old friends or enemies whose applause or mortification would heighten his triumph  AMONG  Martial  's requisites to happiness is  Res non parta labore sed relicta  an estate not gained by industry but left by inheritance It is necessary to the completion of every good that it be timely obtained for whatever comes at the close of life will come too late to give much delight Yet all human happiness has its imperfections Of what we do not gain for ourselves we have only a faint and imperfect fruition because we cannot compare the difference between want and possession or at least can derive from it no conviction of our own abilities nor any encrease of self esteem what we acquire by  bravery or science by mental or corporeal diligence comes at last when we cannot communicate and therefore cannot enjoy it  THUS every period of life is obliged to borrow its happiness from the time to come In youth we have nothing past to entertain us and in age we derive little from retrospect but hopeless sorrow Yet the future likewise has its limits which the imagination dreads to approach but which we know to be not far distant The loss of our friends and companions impresses hourly upon us the necessity of our own departure We know that the schemes of man are quickly at an end that we must soon lie down in the grave with the forgotten multitudes of former ages and yield our place to others who like us shall be driven awhile by hope or fear about the surface of the earth and then like us be lost in the shades of death  BEYOND this termination of our corporeal existence we are therefore obliged to extend our hopes and almost every man indulges his imagination with something which is not to happen till he has changed his manner of existence  Some amuse themselves with entails and settlements provide for the encrease and perpetuation of families and honours or contrive to obviate the dissipation of the fortunes which it has been their business to accumulate Others more refined or exalted congratulate their own hearts upon the future extent of their reputation the reverence of distant nations and the gratitude of unprejudiced posterity  THEY whose souls are so chained down to coffers and tenements that they cannot conceive a state in which they shall look upon them with less solicitude are seldom attentive to remonstrance or flexible to arguments but the votaries of fame are capable of reflection and therefore may be fitly called to reconsider the probability of their expectations  WHETHER to be remembered in remote times be worthy of a wise man's wish has not yet been satisfactorily decided and indeed to be long remembered can happen to so small a number that the bulk of mankind has very little interest in the question There  is never room in the world for more than a certain quantity or measure of renown The necessary business of life the immediate pleasures or pains of every condition leave us not leisure beyond a fixed proportion for contemplations which do not forcibly influence our present welfare When this vacuity is filled no characters can be admitted into the circulation of fame but by occupying the place of some that must be thrust into oblivion The eye of the mind like that of the body can only extend its view to new objects by losing sight of those which are now before it  REPUTATION is therefore a meteor which blazes a while and disappears for ever and if we except a few transcendent and invincible names which no revolutions of opinion or length of time is able to suppress all those that engage our thoughts or diversify our conversation are every moment hasting to obscurity as new favourites are adopted by fashion  IT is not therefore from this world that any ray of comfort can procede to cheer the  gloom of the last hour But futurity has still its prospects there is yet happiness in reserve which if we transfer our attention to it will support us in the pains of disease and the languor of decay This happiness we may expect with confidence because it is out of the power of chance and may be attained by all that sincerely desire and earnestly pursue it On this therefore every mind ought finally to rest Hope is the chief blessing of man and that hope only is rational of which we are certain that it cannot deceive us  NUMB  SATURDAY  Feb    Nemo tam divos habuit faventes  Crastinum ut possit sibi polliceri  SENECA  SEGED  lord of  Ethiopia  to the inhabitants of the world To the sons of  presumption  humility and fear and to the daughters of  sorrow  content and acquiescence  THUS in the twentyseventh year of his reign spoke  Seged  the monarch of forty nations the distributer of the waters of the  Nile  "At length  Seged  thy toils are at an end thou hast reconciled disaffection thou hast suppressed rebellion thou hast pacified the jealousies of thy courtiers thou hast chased war from thy confines and erected fortresses in the lands of thy enemies All who have offended thee tremble in thy presence and wherever thy voice is heard it is obeyed Thy throne is surrounded by armies numerous as the locusts of the summer and resistless as the blasts of pestilence Thy magazines are stored with ammunition thy treasuries overflow with the tribute of conquered kingdoms Plenty waves upon thy fields and opulence glitters in thy cities Thy nod is as the earthquake that shakes the mountains and thy smile as the dawn of the vernal day In thy hand is the strength of thousands and thy health is the health of millions Thy palace is gladdened by the song of praise and thy path perfumed by the breath of benediction Thy subjects gaze upon thy greatness and think of danger or misery  no more Why  Seged  wilt not thou partake the blessings thou bestowest Why shouldst thou only forbear to rejoice in this general felicity Why should thy heart be heavy with fear or thy face clouded with anxiety when the meanest of those who call thee sovereign gives the day to festivity and the night to peace At length  Seged  reflect and be wise What is the gift of conquest but safety why are riches collected but to purchase happiness"  SEGED  then ordered his house of pleasure built in an island of the lake  Dambia  to be prepared for his reception "I will retire says he for ten days from tumult and care from counsels and decrees Long quiet is not the lot of the governors of nations but a cessation of ten days cannot be denied me This short interval of happiness may surely be secured from the interruption of fear or perplexity sorrow on disappointment I will exclude all trouble from my abode and remove from my thoughts whatever may confuse the harmony of the concert or abate the sweetness  of the banquet I will fill the whole capacity of my soul with enjoyment and try what it is to live without a wish unsatisfied"  IN a few days the orders were performed and  Seged  hasted to the palace of  Dambia  which stood in an island cultivated only for pleasure planted with every flower that spreads its colours to the sun and every shrub that sheds fragrance in the air In one part of this extensive garden were open walks for excursions in the morning in another thick groves and silent arbours and bubbling fountains for repose at noon All that could solace the sense or flatter the fancy all that industry could extort from nature or wealth furnish to art all that conquest could seize or beneficence attract was collected together and every perception of delight was excited and gratified  INTO this delicious region  Seged  summoned all the persons of his court who seemed eminently qualified to receive or communicate pleasure His call was readily obeyed the young the fair the vivacious and the witty  were all in haste to be sated with felicity They sailed jocund over the lake which seemed to smooth its surface before them Their passage was cheered with musick and their hearts dilated with expectation  SEGED  landing here with his band of pleasure determined from that hour to break off all acquaintance with discontent to give his heart for ten days to ease and jollity and then fall back to the common state of man and suffer his life to be diversified as before with joy and sorrow  HE immediately entered his chamber to consider where he should begin his circle of happiness He had all the artists of delight before him but knew not whom to call since he could not enjoy one but by delaying the performance of another He chose and rejected he resolved and changed his resolution till his faculties were harrassed and his thoughts confused then returned to the appartment where his presence was expected with languid eyes and clouded countenance and spread the infection of uneasiness over the whole assembly He observed their depression  and was offended for he found his vexation encreased by those whom he expected to dissipate and relieve it He retired again to his private chamber and sought for consolation in his own mind one thought flowed in upon another a long succession of images seized his attention the moments crept imperceptibly away through the gloom of pensiveness till having recovered his tranquility he lifted up his head and saw the lake brightened by the setting sun "Such said  Seged  sighing is the longer day of human existence Before we have learned to use it we find it at an end"  THE regret which he felt for the loss of so great a part of his first day took from him all inclination to enjoy the evening and after having endeavoured for the sake of his attendants to force an air of gaiety and excite that mirth which he could not share he resolved to refer his hopes to the next morning and lay down upon his bed to partake with the slaves of labour and poverty the blessing of sleep  HE rose early the second morning and resolved now to be happy He therefore fixed  upon the gate of the palace an edict importing that whoever during nine days should appear in the presence of the king with dejected countenance or utter any expression of discontent or sorrow should be driven for ever from the palace of  Dambia  THIS edict was immediately made known in every chamber of the court and bower of the gardens Mirth was frighted away and they who were before dancing in the lawns or singing in the shades were at once engaged in the care of regulating their looks that  Seged  might find his will punctually obeyed and see none among them liable to banishment  SEGED  now met every face settled in a smile but a smile that betrayed solicitude timidity and constraint He accosted his favourites with familiarity and softness but they durst not speak without premeditation lest they should be convicted of discontent or sorrow He proposed diversions to which no objection was made because objection would have implied uneasiness but they were regarded with indifference by the courtiers  who had no other desire than to signalize themselves by clamorous exultation He offered various topics of conversation but obtained only forced jests and laborious laughter and after many attempts to animate them to confidence and alacrity was obliged to confess to himself the impotence of command and resign another day to grief and disappointment  HE at last relieved his companions from their terrors and shut himself up in his chamber to ascertain by some different measures the felicity of the succeeding days At length he threw himself on the bed and closed his eyes but imagined in his sleep that his palace and gardens were overwhelmed by an inundation and waked with all the terrors of a man struggling in the water He composed himself again to rest but was disturbed by an imaginary irruption into his kingdom and striving as is usual in dreams without ability to move fancied himself betrayed to his enemies and again started up with horror and indignation  IT was now day and fear was so strongly impressed on his mind that he could sleep no more He rose but his thoughts were filled with the deluge and invasion nor was he able to disengage his attention or mingle with vacancy or ease in any amusement At length his perturbation gave way to reason and he resolved no longer to be harrassed by a dream but before this resolution could be completely formed half the day had elapsed He felt a new conviction of the uncertainty of all human schemes and could not forbear to bewail the frailty and weakness of that being whose quiet could be interrupted by vapours of the fancy Having been first disturbed by a dream he was afterwards grieved that a dream could disturb him He at last discovered that his terrors and grief were equally vain and that to lose the present in lamenting the past was voluntarily to protract a melancholy vision The third day was now declining and  Seged  again resolved to be happy on the morrow  NUMB  TUESDAY  March    Volat ambiguis  Mobilis alis hora nec ulli  Praestat velox Fortuna fidem  SEN  ON the fourth morning  Seged  rose early refreshed with sleep vigorous with health and eager with expectation He entered the garden attended by the princes and ladies of his court and seeing nothing about him but airy cheerfulness began to say to his heart "This day shall be a day of pleasure" The sun played upon the water the birds warbled in the groves and the gales quivered among the branches He roved from walk to walk as chance directed him and sometimes listened to the songs sometimes mingled with the dancers sometimes let loose his imagination in flights of merriment and sometimes uttered grave reflections and sententious maxims and feasted on the admiration with which they were received  THUS the day rolled on without any accident of vexation or intrusion of melancholy thoughts All that beheld him caught gladness from his looks and the sight of happiness conferred by himself filled his heart with satisfaction But having passed three hours in this harmless luxury he was alarmed on a sudden by an universal scream among the women and turning back saw the whole assembly flying in confusion A young crocodile had risen out of the lake and was ranging the garden in wantonness or hunger  Seged  beheld him with indignation as a disturber of his felicity and chased him back into the lake but could not persuade his retinue to stay or free their hearts from the terror which had seized upon them The princesses inclosed themselves in the palace and could yet scarcely believe themselves in safety Every attention was fixed upon the late danger and escape and no mind was any longer at leisure for gay sallies or careless prattle  SEGED  had now no other employment than to contemplate the innumerable casualties which lie in ambush on every side to intercept the happiness of man and break in  upon the hour of delight and tranquility He had however the consolation of thinking that he had not been now disappointed by his own fault and that the accident which had blasted the hopes of the day might easily be prevented by future caution  THAT he might provide for the pleasure of the next morning he resolved to repeal his penal edict since he had already found that discontent and melancholy were not to be frighted away by the threats of authority and that pleasure would only reside where she was exempted from control He therefore invited all the companions of his retreat to unbounded pleasantry by proposing prizes for those who should on the following day distinguish themselves by any festive performances the tables of the antichamber were covered with gold and pearls and robes and garlands decreed the rewards of those who could refine elegance or heighten pleasure  AT this display of riches every eye immediately sparkled and every tongue was busied in celebrating the bounty and magnificence of the emperor But when  Seged  entered in  hopes of uncommon entertainment from universal emulation he found that any passion too strongly agitated puts an end to that tranquility which is necessary to mirth and that the mind that is to be moved by the gentle ventilations of gaiety must be first smoothed by a total calm Whatever we ardently wish to gain we must in the same degree be afraid to lose and fear and pleasure cannot dwell together  ALL was now care and solicitude Nothing was done or spoken but with so visible an endeavour at perfection as always failed to delight though it sometimes forced admiration And  Seged  could not but observe with sorrow that his prizes had more influence than himself As the evening approached the contest grew more earnest and those who were forced to allow themselves excelled began to discover the malignity of defeat first by angry glances and at last by contemptuous murmurs  Seged  likewise shared the anxiety of the day for considering himself as obliged to distribute with exact justice the prizes which had been so zealously sought he durst never remit his attention but passed  his time in balancing different kinds of merit and adjusting the claims of all the competitors  AT last knowing that no exactness could fatisfy those whose hopes he should disappoint and thinking that on a day set apart for happiness it would be cruel to oppress any heart with sorrow he declared that all had pleased him alike and dismissed all with presents of equal value  SEGED  saw that his caution had not been able to avoid offence They who had believed themselves secure of the highest prizes were not pleased to be levelled with the crowd and though by the liberality of the king they received more than his promise had intitled them to expect they departed unsatisfied because they were honoured with no distinction and wanted an opportunity to triumph in the mortification of their opponents "Behold here said  Seged  the condition of him who places his happiness in the happiness of others" He then retired to meditate and while the courtiers were  repining at his distributions saw the fifth sun go down in discontent  THE next dawn renewed his resolution to be happy But having learned how little he could effect by settled schemes or preparatory measures he thought it best to give up one day entirely to chance and left every one to please and be pleased his own way  THIS relaxation of regularity diffused a general complacence through the whole court and the emporor imagined that he had at last found the secret of obtaining an interval of felicity But as he was roving in this careless assembly with equal carelessness he overheard one of his courtiers in a close arbour murmuring to himself "What merit has  Seged  above us that we should thus fear and obey him a man whom whatever he may have formerly performed his luxury now shews to have the same weakness with ourselves" This charge affected him the more as it was uttered by one whom he had always observed among the most abject of his flatterers At first his indignation prompted him to severity but reflecting that what  was spoken without intention to be heard was to be considered as only thought and was perhaps but the sudden burst of casual and temporary vexation he invented some decent pretence to send him away that his retreat might not be tainted with the breath of envy and after the struggle of deliberation was past and all desire of revenge utterly suppressed passed the evening not only with tranquillity but triumph though none but himself was conscious of the victory  THE remembrance of this clemency cheered the beginning of the seventh day and nothing happened to disturb the pleasure of  Seged  till looking on the tree that shaded him he recollected that under a tree of the same kind he had passed the night after his defeat in the kingdom of  Goiama  The reflection on his loss his dishonour and the miseries which his subjects suffered from the invader filled him with sadness At last he shook off the weight of sorrow and began to solace himself with his usual pleasures when his tranquillity was again disturbed by jealousies which the late contest for the prizes had produced and which having in vain tried to pacify  them by persuasion he was forced to silence by command  ON the eighth morning  Seged  was awakened early by an unusual hurry in the apartments and enquiring the cause was told that the princess  Balkis  was seized with sickness He rose and calling the physicians found that they had little hope of her recovery Here was an end of jollity All his thoughts were now upon his daughter whose eyes he closed on the tenth day  SUCH were the days which  Seged  of  Ethiopia  had appropriated to a short respiration from the fatigues of war and the cares of government This narrative he has bequeathed to future generations that no man hereafter may presume to say "This day shall be a day of happiness"  NUMB  SATURDAY  March    Propositi nondum pudet atque eadem est mens  Ut bona summa putes aliena vivere quadra  JUV  WHEN  Diogenes  was once asked what kind of wine he liked best He answered "That which is drunk at the cost of others"  THOUGH the character of  Diogenes  has never excited any general zeal of imitation there are many who resemble him in his taste of wine many who are frugal though not abstemious whose appetites though too powerful for reason are kept under restraint by avarice and to whom all delicacies lose their flavour when they cannot be obtained but at their own expence  NOTHING produces more singularity of manners and inconstancy of life than the conslict of opposite vices in the same mind  He that uniformly pursues any purpose whether good or bad has a settled principle of action and as he may always find associates who are travelling the same way is countenanced by example and sheltered in the multitude but he that is actuated at once by contrary desires must move in a direction peculiar to himself and suffer that reproach which we are naturally inclined to bestow on those who differ from the rest of the world even without enquiring whether they are worse or better  YET this conflict of desires sometimes produces wonderful efforts To riot in farsetch'd dishes or surfeit with unexhausted variety and yet practise the most rigid oeconomy is surely an art which may justly draw the eyes of mankind upon them whose industry or judgment has enabled them to attain it To him indeed who is content to break open the chests or mortgage the manors of his ancestors that he may hire the ministers of excess at the highest price gluttony is an easy science yet we often hear the votaries of luxury boasting of the elegance which they owe to the taste of others relating with rapture  the succession of dishes with which their cooks and caterers supply them and expecting their share of praise with the discoverers of arts and the civilizers of nations But to shorten the way to convivial happiness by eating without cost is a secret hitherto in few hands but which certainly deserves the curiosity of those whose principal enjoyment is their dinner and who see the sun rise with no other hope than that they shall fill their bellies before it sets  OF them that have within my knowledge attempted this scheme of happiness the greater part have been immediately obliged to desist and some whom their first attempts flattered with success were reduced by degrees to a few tables from which they were at last chased to make way for others and having long habituated themselves to superfluous plenty growled away their latter years in discontented competence  NONE enter the regions of luxury with higher expectations than men of wit who imagine that they shall never want a welcome to that company whose ideas they can  enlarge or whose imaginations they can elevate and believe themselves able to pay for their wine with the mirth which it qualifies them to produce Full of this opinion they crowd with little invitation wherever the smell of a feast allures them but are seldom encouraged to repeat their visits being dreaded by the pert as rivals and hated by the dull as disturbers of the company  No man has been so happy in gaining and keeping the privilege of living at luxurious houses as  Gulosulus  who after thirty years of continual revelry I as now established by uncontroverted prescription his claim to partake of every entertainment and whose presence they who aspire to the praise of a sumptuous table are careful to procure on a day of importance by sending the invitation a fortnight before  GULOSULUS  entered the world without any eminent degree of merit but was careful to frequent houses where persons of rank resorted By being often seen he became in time known and from sitting in the same room was suffered to mix in idle conversation  or assisted to fill up a vacant hour when better amusement was not readily to be had From the coffeehouse he was sometimes taken away to dinner and as no man refuses the acquaintance of him whom he sees admitted to familiarity by others of equal dignity when he had been met at a few tables he with less difficulty found the way to more till at last he was regularly expected to appear wherever preparations are made for a feast within the circuit of his acquaintance  WHEN he was thus by accident initiated in luxury he felt in himself no inclination to retire from a life of so much pleasure and therefore very seriously considered how he might continue it Great qualities or uncommon accomplishments he did not find necessary to his design for he had already seen that they whose merit is allowed rather enforce respect than attract fondness and as he thought no folly greater than that of losing a dinner for any other gratification he often congratulated himself that he had none of that disgusting excellence which impresses awe upon greatness and condemns its possessors  to the society of those who are wise or brave and indigent as themselves  GULOSULUS  having never allotted much of his time to books or meditation had no opinion in philosophy or politicks and was not in danger of injuring his interest by dogmatical positions or violent contradiction If a dispute arose he took care to listen with earnest attention and when either speaker grew vehement and loud turned towards him with eager quickness and uttered a short phrase of admiration as if surprised by such cogency of argument as he had never known before By this silent concession he generally preserved in either controvertist such a conviction of his own superiority as inclined him rather to pity than irritate his adversary and prevented those outrages which are sometimes produced by the rage of defeat or petulance of triumph  GULOSULUS  was never embarrassed but when he was required to declare his sentiments before he had been able to discover to which side the master of the house inclined  for it was his invariable rule to adopt the notions of those that invited him  IT sometimes happens that the insolence of wealth breaks into contemptuousness or the turbulence of wine requires a vent and  Gulosulus  seldom fails of being singled out on such emergencies as one on whom any experiment of ribaldry may be safely tryed Sometimes his lordship finds himself inclined to exhibit a specimen of raillery for the diversion of his guests and  Gulosulus  always supplies him with a subject of merriment But he has learned to consider rudeness and indignities as familiarities that entitle him to greater freedom He comforts himself that those who treat and insult him pay for their laughter and observes that he keeps his money and they enjoy their jest  HIS chief policy consists in selecting some dish from every course and recommending it to the company with an air so decisive that no one ventures to contradict him By this practice he acquires at a feast a kind of dictatorial authority his taste becomes the standard of pickles and seasoning and he is venerated by the professors of epicurism as the only man who understands the niceties of cookery  WHENEVER a new sauce is imported or any innovation made in the culinary system he procures the earliest intelligence and the most authentick receipt and by communicating his knowledge under proper injunctions of secrecy gains a right of tasting his own dish whenever it is prepared that he may tell whether his directions have been fully understood  BY this method of life  Gulosulus  has so impressed on his imagination the dignity of feasting that he has no other topic of talk or subject of meditation Others may prate of tropicks and the zodiac his calendar is a bill of fare he measures the year by successive dainties The only common places of his memory are his meals and if you ask him at what time an event happened he considers whether he heard it after a dinner of turbot or venison He knows indeed that those who value themselves upon sense learning or piety speak of him with contempt but he considers them as wretches envious or ignorant who do not know his happiness or wish to supplant him and declares to his friends that he is fully satisfied with his own conduct since he has fed every day on twenty dishes and yet doubled his estate  NUMB  TUESDAY  March    Solve senescentem mature sanus equum ne  Peccet

the  Greek  epigrammatist on marriage may be applied to every other course of life that its two days of happiness are the first and the last  FEW moments are more pleasing than those in which the mind is concerting measures for a new undertaking From the first hint that wakens the fancy to the hour of actual execution all is improvement and progress triumph and felicity Every hour brings additions to the original scheme suggests some new expedient to secure success or discovers consequential advantages not hitherto foreseen While preparations are made and materials accumulated day glides after day through elysian prospects and the heart dances to the song of hope  SUCH is the pleasure of projecting that many content themselves with a succession of  visionary schemes and wear out their allotted time in the calm amusement of contriving what they never attempt or hope to execute  OTHERS not able to feast their imagination with pure ideas advance somewhat nearer to the grossness of action with great diligence collect whatever is requisite to their design and after a thousand researches and consultations are snatched away by death as they stand  in procinctu  waiting for a proper opportunity to begin  IF there were no other end of life than to find some adequate solace for every day I know not whether any condition could be preferred to that of the man who involves himself in his own thoughts and never suffers experience to shew him the vanity of speculation for no sooner are notions reduced to practice than tranquility and confidence forsake the breast every day brings its task and often without bringing abilities to perform it Difficulties embarrass uncertainty perplexes opposition retards censure exasperates or neglect depresses We proceed because we have begun we complete our design that the labour already spent may not be vain but as expectation gradually dies away the gay smile of  alacrity disappears we are necessitated to implore severer powers and trust the event to patience and constancy  WHEN once our labour has begun the comfort that enables us to endure it is the prospect of its end for though in every long work there are some joyous intervals of selfapplause when the attention is recreated by unexpected facility and the imagination soothed by incidental excellencies not comprised in the first plan yet the toil with which performance struggles after idea is so irksome and disgusting and so frequent is the necessity of resting below that perfection which we imagined within our reach that seldom any man obtains more from his endeavours than a painful conviction of his defects and a continual resuscitation of desires which he feels himself unable to gratify  SO certainly is weariness and vexation the concomitant of our undertakings that every man in whatever he is engaged consoles himself with the hope of change He that has made his way by assiduity and vigilance to publick employment talks among his friends of nothing but the delight of retirement He whom the necessity of solitary application secludes  from the world listens with a beating heart to its distant noises longs to mingle with living beings and resolves when he can regulate his hours by his own choice to take his fill of merriment and diversions or to display his abilities on the universal theatre and enjoy the pleasure of distinction and applause  EVERY desire however innocent or natural grows dangerous as by long indulgence it becomes ascendent in the mind When we have been much accustomed to consider any thing as capable of giving happiness it is not easy to restrain our ardour or to forbear some precipitation in our advances and irregularity in our persuits He that has long cultivated the tree watched the swelling bud and opening blossom and pleased himself with computing how much every sun and shower added to its growth scarcely stays till the fruit has obtained its maturity but defeats his own cares by eagerness to reward them When we have diligently laboured for any purpose we are willing to believe that we have attained it and because we have already done much too suddenly conclude that no more is to be done  ALL attraction is encreased by the approach of the attracting body We never find ourselves  so desirous to finish as in the latter part of our work or so impatient of delay as when we know that delay cannot be long Part of this unseasonable importunity of discontent may be justly imputed to languor and weariness which must always oppress us more as our toil has been longer continued but the greater part usually proceeds from frequent contemplation of that ease which we now consider as near and certain and which when it has once flattered our hopes we cannot suffer to be longer withheld  THE criticks remark that in some of the noblest compositions of with the conclusion falls below the vigour and spirit of the first books and as a genius is not to be degraded by the imputation of human failings the cause of this declension is commonly sought in the structure of the work and plausible reasons are given why in the defective part less ornament was necessary or less could be admitted But perhaps if the author had been consulted he would have confessed that his fancy was tired and his perseverance broken that he knew his design to be unfinished but that when he saw the end so near he could no longer refuse to be at rest  AGAINST the instillations of this frigid opiate it is necessary to secure the heart by all the considerations which once concurred to kindle the ardour of enterprise Whatever motive first incited action has still greater force to stimulate resolution since he that might have lain still at first in blameless obscurity cannot afterwards desist but with infamy and reproach He whom a doubtful promise of distant good could encourage to set difficulties at defiance ought not to remit his vigour when he has almost obtained his recompence To faint or loiter when only the last efforts are required is to steer the ship through tempests and abandon it to the winds in sight of land it is to break the ground and scatter the seed and at last to neglect the harvest  THE masters of rhetorick direct that the most forcible arguments be produced in the latter part of an oration lest they should be effaced or perplexed by supervenient images This precept may be justly extended to the series of life Nothing is ended with honour which does not conclude better than it begun It is not sufficient to maintain the first vigour for excellence loses its effect upon the mind by custom as light after a time ceases to dazzle  Admiration must be continued by that novelty which first produced it and how much soever is given there must always be reason to imagine that more remains  WE not only are naturally most sensible of the last impressions but such is the unwillingness of mankind to admit supereminent and transcendent merit that though it be difficult to obliterate the reproach of faults or miscarriages by any subsequent atchievement however illustrious or any course of virtue however uniform yet the reputation which a long course of success has contributed to raise may be finally ruined by a single failure for weakness or error will be always remembered by that malice vanity and envy which it gratifies  FOR the prevention of that disgrace which lassitude and negligence may bring at last upon the greatest performances it is necessary to proportion carefully our labour to our strength If the design consists of many parts equally essential and therefore not to be separated the only time for caution is before we engage we must then impartially estimate our powers and remember that not to complete our plan is not to have begun it and that nothing is done while any thing is omitted  BUT if the task consists in the repetition of single acts no one of which derives its efficacy from the rest it may be attempted with less scruple because there is always opportunity to retreat with honour The danger is only lest we may expect from the world the indulgence with which most are disposed to treat themselves and in the hour of listlessness imagine that the diligence of one day will attone for the idleness of another and that applause begun by approbation will be continued by habit  HE that is himself weary will soon weary the public Let him therefore

the anxious employment of a periodical writer and multiplied my essays to six volumes I have now determined to desist  THE reasons of this resolution it is of little importance to declare since justification is unnecessary when no objection is made I am far from supposing that the cessation of my performances will raise any inquiry for I have never been much a favourite of the publick nor can boast that in the progress of my undertaking I have been animated by the rewards of the liberal the caresses of the great or the praises of the eminent  I HAVE however no intention to gratify pride by submission or malice by lamentation nor think it reasonable to complain of neglect  from those whose regard I never solicited If I have not been distinguished by the distributers of literary honours I have seldom descended to the arts by which favour is obtained I have seen the meteros of fashion rise and fall without any attempt to add a moment to their duration I have never complied with temporary curiosity nor enabled my readers to discuss the topic of the day I have rarely exemplified my assertions by living characters so that in my papers no man could look either for censures of his enemies or praises of himself and they only were expected to peruse them whose passions left them leisure for the contemplation of abstracted truth and whom virtue could please by her native dignity  TO some however I am indebted for encouragement and to others for assistance the number of my friends was never great but they have been such as would not suffer me to think that I was writing in vain and I therefore felt little dejection from the want of popularity  MY obligations having not been frequent my acknowledgements may be soon dispatched I can restore to all my correspondents their productions with little diminution of the bulk  of my volumes though not without the loss of some pieces to which particular honours have been paid  THE parts from which I claim no other praise than that of having given them an opportunity of appearing are the four billets in the tenth paper the second letter in the fifteenth the thirtieth the fortyfourth the ninetyseventh and the hundredth papers and the second letter in the hundred and seventh  HAVING thus deprived myself of many excuses which candor might have admitted for the inequality of my compositions being no longer able to allege the necessity of gratifying correspondents the importunity with which publication was solicited or obstinacy with which correction was rejected I must remain accountable for all my faults and submit without subterfuge to the censures of criticism which however I shall not endeavour to soften by a formal deprecation or to overbear by the influence of a patron The supplications of an author never yet reprieved him a moment from oblivion and though greatness has sometimes sheltered guilt it can afford no protection to ignorance or dulness Having hitherto attempted only the propagation of truth I will  not at last violate it by the confession of terrors which I do not feel Having laboured to maintain the dignity of virtue I will not now degrade it by the meanness of dedication  THE seeming vanity with which I have sometimes spoken of myself would perhaps require an apology were it not extenuated by the example of those who have published essays before me and by the privilege which a nameless writer has been hitherto allowed "A mask" says  Castiglione  "confers a right of acting and speaking with less restraint even when the wearer happens to be known" He that is discovered without his own consent may claim some indulgence and cannot be rigorously called to justify those sallies or frolicks which his disguise may prove him desirous to conceal  BUT I have been cautious lest this offence should be frequently or grossly committed for as one of the philosophers directs us to live with a friend as with one that is sometime to become an enemy I have always thought it the duty of an anonymous author to write if he expected to be hereafter known  I AM willing to flatter my self with hopes that by collecting these papers I am not preparing  for my future life either shame or repentance That all are happily imagined or accurately polished that the same sentiments will not sometimes recur or the same expressions be too frequently repeated I have not confidence in my abilities sufficient to promise He that condemns himself to compose on a stated day will often bring to his task an attention dissipated a memory overwhelmed an imagination embarrassed a mind distracted with anxieties a body languishing with disease He will sometimes labour on a barren topic till it is too late to change it and sometimes in the ardour of invention diffuse his thoughts into wild exuberance which the pressing hour of publication cannot suffer judgment to examine or reduce  WHATEVER shall be the final sentence of mankind I have at least endeavoured to deserve their kindness I have laboured to refine our language to grammatical purity and to clear it from colloquial barbarisms licentious idioms and irregular combinations Something perhaps I have added to the elegance of its construction and something to the harmony of its cadence When common words were less pleasing to the ear or less distinct in their signification I have familiarized the terms  of philosophy by applying them to known objects and popular ideas but have rarely admitted any word not authorized by former writers for I believe that whoever knows the  English  tongue in its present extent will be able to express his thoughts without farther help from other nations  AS it has been my principal design to inculcate wisdom or piety I have allotted few papers to the idle sports of imagination and though some perhaps may be found of which the highest excellence is harmless merriment yet scarcely any man is so steadily serious as not rather to complain that the severity of dictatorial instruction is too seldom relieved and that he has been often driven by the sternness of my philosophy to more chearful and airy companions  NEXT to the excursions of fancy are the disquisitions of criticism which in my opinion is only to be ranked among the subordinate and instrumental arts Arbitrary decision and general exclamation I have carefully avoided by asserting nothing without a reason and establishing all my principles of judgment on unalterable and evident truth  IN the pictures of life I have never been so studious of novelty or surprize as to depart  wholly from all resemblance a fault which writers deservedly celebrated frequently commit that they may raise as the occasion requires either mirth or abhorrence Some enlargement may be allowed to declamation and some exaggeration to burlesque but as they deviate farther from reality they become less useful because their lessons will fail of application The mind of the reader is carried away from the contemplation of his own manners he finds in himself no likeness to the phantom before him and though he laughs or rages is not reformed  THE essays professedly serious if I have been able to execute my own intentions will be found exactly conformable to the precepts of christianity without any accommodation to the licentiousness and levity of the present age I therefore look back on this part of my work with pleasure which no blame or praise of man shall diminish or augment I shall never envy the honours which wit and learning obtain in any other cause if I can be numbered among the writers who have given ardour to virtue and confidence to truth  FINIS  CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  NUMB Difficulty of the first address Practice of the epic poets

head  Yet dauntless still the adverse flood he braves  And still indignant bounds above the waves  Tir'd by the tides his knees relax with toil  Wash'd from beneath him slides the slimy soil  POPE  His bloody hand  Snatch'd two unhappy of my martial band  And dash'd like dogs against the stony floor  The pavement swims with brains and mingled gore  POPE  Tremendous  Gorgon  frown'd upon its

sound a picture of the sense  The correspondent words exactly frame  The look the features and the mien the same  With rapid feet and wings without delay  This swiftly flies and smoothly skims away  This blooms with youth and beauty in his face  And  Venus  breathes on ev'ry limb a grace  That of rude form his uncouth members shows  Looks horrible and frowns with his rough brows  His monstrous tail in many a fold and wind  Voluminous and vast curls up behind  At once the image and the lines appear  Rude to the eye and frightful to the ear  Lo when the sailors steer the pond'rous ships  And plough with brazen beaks the foamy deeps  Incumbent on the main that roars around  Beneath the lab'ring oars the waves resound  The prows wideecchoing thro' the dark profound  To the loud call each distant rock replies  Tost by the storm the tow'ring surges rise  While the hoarse ocean beats the sounding shore  Dash'd from the strand the flying waters roar  Flash at the shock and gath'ring in a heap  The liquid mountains rise and overhand the deep  But when blue  Neptune  from his car surveys  And calms at one regard the raging seas  Stretch'd like a peaceful lake the deep subsides  And the pitch'd vessel o'er the surface glides  When things are small the terms should still be so  For low words please us when the theme is low  But when some giant horrible and grim  Enormous in his gait and vast in ev'ry limb  Stalks tow'ring on the swelling words must rise  In just proportion to the monster's size  If some large weight his huge arms strive to shove  The verse too labours the throng'd words scarce move  When each stiff clod beneath the pond'rous plough  Crumbles and breaks th' encumber'd lines must flow  Nor less when pilots catch the friendly gales  Unfurl their shrouds and hoist the widestretch'd sails  But if the poem suffers from delay  Let the lines fly precipitate away  And when the viper issues from the brake  Be quick with stones and brands and fire attack  His rising crest and drive the serpent back  When night descends or stun'd by num'rous strokes  And groaning to the earth drops the vast ox  The line too sinks with correspondent sound  Flat with the steer and headlong to the ground  When the wild waves subside and tempests cease  And hush the roarings of the sea to peace  So oft we see the interrupted strain  Stop'd in the midstand with the silent main  Pause for a spaceat last it glides again  When  Priam  strains his aged arms to throw  His unavailing jav'lin at the foe  His blood congeal'd and ev'ry nerve unstrung  Then with the theme complies the artful song  Like him the solitary numbers flow  Weak trembling melancholy stiff and slow  Not so young  Pyrrhus  who with rapid force  Beats down embattled armies in his course  The raging youth on trembling  Ilionfalls    Bursts her strong gates and shakes her lofty walls  Provokes his flying courser to the speed  In full career to charge the warlike steed  He piles the field with mountains of the slain  He pours he storms he thunders thro' the plain  PITT  NUMB  More safely truth to urge her claim presumes  On names now found alone on books and tombs  NUMB  Perpetual magistrate is he  Who keeps strict justice full in sight  Who bids the crowd at awful distance gaze  And virtue's arms victoriously displays  FRANCIS  Here sacred pomp and genial feast delight  And solemn dance and hymeneal rite  Along the street the new made brides are led  With torches flaming to the nuptial bed  The youthful dancers in a circle bound  To the soft flute and cittern's silver
