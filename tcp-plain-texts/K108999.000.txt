 AN ESSAY ON THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE  AN ESSAY ON THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE ADDRESSED TO JOSEPH CRADOCK  Esq  THE SECOND EDITION WITH LARGE ADDITIONS  BY RICHARD FARMER B D Fellow of EMMANUELCOLLEGE CAMBRIDGE AND OF The Society of ANTIQUARIES LONDON  CAMBRIDGE Printed by J ARCHDEACON Printer to the UNIVERSITY For J WOODYER in  Cambridge  and Sold by J BEECROFT in PaternosterRow J DODSLEY in PallMall T CADELL in the Strand and M HINGESTON near Temple Bar  London  MDCCLXVII  PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION  THE AUTHOR of the following ESSAY was sollicitous only for the honour of  Shakespeare  he hath however in  his own  capacity little reason to complain of  occasional  Criticks or Criticks  by profession  The very FEW who have been pleased to controvert any part of his Doctrine have favoured him with better manners than arguments and claim his thanks for a further opportunity of demonstrating the futility of  Theoretick  reasoning against  Matter of Fact  It is indeed strange that any  real  Friends of our immortal POET should be still willing to force him into a situation which is not tenable treat him as a  learned  Man and what shall excuse the most gross violations of History Chronology and Geography  is the Motto of every  Polemick  like his Brethren at the  Amphitheatre  he holds it a merit to  die hard  and will not say  Enough  though the Battle be decided "Were it shewn says some one that the old Bard borrowed  all  his allusions from  English  books then published our  Essayist  might have possibly established his System"  In good time This had scarcely been attempted by  Peter Burman  himself with the Library of  Shakespeare  before him "Truly as Mr  Dogberry  says for  mine own  part if I were as tedious as a King I could find in my heart to bestow it all on this Subject" but where should I meet with a Reader When the main Pillars are taken away the whole Building falls in course Nothing hath been or can be pointed out which is not easily removed or rather which was not  virtually  removed before a very little  Analogy  will do the business I shall therefore have no occasion to trouble myself any further and may venture to call my Pamphlet in the words of a pleasant Declaimer against  Sermons on the thirtieth of January  "an Answer to every thing that shall hereafter be written on the Subject"  But "this method of reasoning will prove any one ignorant of the Languages who hath written when Translations were extant"  Shade  of  Burgersdicius  does it follow because  Shakespeare's  early life was incompatible with a course of Educationwhose Contemporaries Friends and Foes nay and himself likewise agree in his want of what is usually called  Literature  whose mistakes from equivocal Translations and even typographical Errors cannot possibly be accounted for otherwise that  Locke  to whom not one of these circumstances is applicable understood no  Greek  I suspect  Rollin's  Opinion of our Philosopher was not founded on this argument  Shakespeare  wanted not the Stilts of Languages to raise him above all other men The quotation from  Lilly  in the  Taming of the Shrew  if indeed it be his strongly proves the extent of his reading had he known  Terence  he would not have quoted erroneously  from his  Grammar  Every one hath met with men in common life who according to the language of the  Waterpoet  "got only from  Possum  to  Posset"  and yet will throw out a line occasionally from their  Accidence  or their  Cato de Moribus  with tolerable propriety If however the old Editions be trusted in this passage our Author's memory somewhat failed him in point of  Concord  The rage of  Parallelisms  is almost over and in truth nothing can be more absurd "THIS was stolen from  one  Classick THAT from  another  " and had I not stept in to his rescue poor  Shakespeare  had been stript as naked of ornament as when he first  held Horses  at the door of the Playhouse  The late ingenious and modest Mr  Dodsley  declared himself  "Untutor'd in the lore of  Greece  or  Rome"  Yet let us take a passage at a venture from any of his performances and a thousand to one it is stolen Suppose it be his celebrated Compliment to the  Ladies  in one of his earliest pieces  The Toyshop  "A good Wife makes the cares of the World sit easy and adds a sweetness to its pleasures she is a Man's best Companion in Prosperity and his only Friend in Adversity the carefullest preserver of his Health and the kindest Attendant in his Sickness a faithful Adviser in Distress a Comforter in Affliction and a prudent Manager in all his domestic Affairs"  Plainly  from a fragment of  Euripides  preserved by  Stobaeus  "    "  Par  to  Malvolio  in the  TwelfthNight  of  Shakespeare  hath some expressions very similar to  Alnaschar  in the  Arabian Tales  which perhaps may be sufficient for  some  Criticks to prove his acquaintance with  Arabic  It seems however at last that  "Taste  should determine the matter" This as  Bardolph  expresses it is a  word of exceeding good command  but I am willing that the Standard itself be somewhat better ascertained before it be opposed to demonstrative Evidence Upon the whole I may consider myself as the  Pioneer  of the  Commentators  I have removed a deal of  learned Rubbish  and pointed out to them  Shakespeare's  track in the everpleasing  Paths of Nature  This was necessarily a previous Inquiry and I hope I may assume with some confidence what one of the first Criticks of the Age was pleased to declare on reading the former Edition that "The Question is  now  for ever decided"  I may just remark lest they be mistaken for  Errata  that the word  Catherine  in the th page is written according to the old Orthography for  Catherine  and that the passage in the st page is copied from  Upton  who improperly calls  Horatio  and  Marcellus  in  Hamlet  "the  Centinels"  In p l for  had probably  read  might have  c  AN ESSAY ON THE LEARNING OF SHAKESPEARE ADDRESSED TO JOSEPH CRADOCK  Esq  "SHAKESPEARE says a Brother of the  Craft  Mr  Seward  in his Preface to  Beaumont  and  Fletcher  Vol vo  is a vast garden of criticism" and certainly no one can be favoured with more weeders  gratis  But how often my dear Sir are weeds and flowers torn up indiscriminately the ravaged spot is replanted in a moment and a profusion of critical thorns thrown over it for security  "A prudent man therefore would not venture his fingers amongst them"  Be however in little pain for your friend who regards himself sufficiently to be cautiousyet he asserts with confidence that no improvement can be expected whilst the natural soil is mistaken for a hotbed and the Natives of the banks of  Avon  are scientifically choked with the culture of exoticks  Thus much for metaphor it is contrary to the  Statute  to fly out so early but who can tell whether it may not be demonstrated by some critick or other that a deviation from rule is peculiarly happy in an Essay of  Shakespeare  You have long known my opinion concerning the literary acquisitions of our immortal Dramatist and remember how I congratulated myself on my coincidence with the last and best of his Editors I told you however that his  small Latin and less Greek  This passage of  Ben Jonson  so often quoted is given us in the admirable preface to the late Edition with a various reading "small Latin and  no  Greek" which hath been held up to the Publick for a modern sophistication yet whether an error or not it was adopted above a Century ago by  W Towers  in a Panegyrick on  Cartwright  His Eulogy with more than fifty others on this now forgotten Poet was prefixed to the Edit  would still be litigated and you see very assuredly that I was not mistaken The trumpet hath been sounded against "the darling project of representing  Shakespeare  as one of the illiterate vulgar" and indeed to so good purpose that I would by all means recommend the performer to the army of  the  braying Faction  recorded by  Cervantes  The testimony of his contemporaries is again disputed constant tradition is opposed by flimsy arguments and nothing is heard but confusion and nonsense One could scarcely imagine this a topick very likely to inflame the passions it is asserted by  Dryden  that "those who accuse him to have wanted learning give him the greatest commendation" yet an attack upon an article of faith hath been usually received with more temper and complacence than the unfortunate opinion which I am about to defend  But let us previously lament with every lover of  Shakespeare  that the Question was not fully discussed by Mr  Johnson  himself what he sees intuitively others must arrive at by a series of proofs and I have not time to  teach  with precision be contented therefore with a few cursory observations as they may happen to arise from the Chaos of Papers you have so often laughed at "a stock sufficient to set up an  Editor in form"  I am convinced of the strength of my cause and superior to any little advantage from sophistical arrangements  General positions without proofs will probably have no great weight on either side yet it may not seem fair to suppress them take them therefore as their authors occur to me and we will afterward proceed to particulars  The testimony of  Ben  stands foremost and  some have held it sufficient to decide the controversy in the warmest Panegyrick that ever was written he apologizes  "Though  thou hadst  small Latin  c"  for what  he  supposed the only defect in his "beloved friend  Soul of the age  Th' applause delight the wonder of our stage  whose memory he honoured almost to idolatry" and conscious of the worth of ancient literature like any other man on the same occasion he rather carries his acquirements  above  than  below  the truth "Jealousy cries Mr  Upton  People will allow others any qualities but those upon which they highly value  themselves"  Yes where there  is  a competition and the competitor formidable but I think this Critick himself hath scarcely set in opposition the learning of  Shakespeare  and  Jonson  When a superiority is universally granted it by no means appears a man's literary interest to depress the reputation of his Antagonist  In truth the received opinion of the pride and malignity of  Jonson  at least in the earlier part of life is absolutely groundless at this time scarce a play or a poem appeared without  Ben's  encomium from the original  Shakespeare  to the translator of  Du Bartas  But  Jonson  is by no means our only authority  Drayton  the countryman and acquaintance of  Shakespeare  determines his excellence to the  naturall Braine  In his Elegie on Poets and Poesie p Fol  only  Digges  a wit of the town before our Poet left the stage is very strong to the purpose  "Nature only helpt him for looke thorow  This whole book thou shalt find he doth not borow  One phrase from Greekes not Latines imitate  Nor once from vulgar Languages translate"  From his Poem "upon Master  William Shakespeare"  intended to have been prefixed with the other of his composition to the Folio of and afterward printed in several miscellaneous Collections particularly the spurious Edition of  Shakespeare's  Poems Some account of him may be met with in  Wood's Athenae  Suckling  opposes his  easier strain  to the  sweat of learned Jonson Denham  assures us that all he had was from  old Motherwit His native woodnotes wild  every one remembers to be celebrated by  Milton Dryden  observes prettily enough that "he wanted not the spectacles of books to read Nature" He came out of her hand as some one else expresses it like  Pallas  out of  Jove's  head at full growth and mature  The ever memorable  Hales  of  Eton  who notwithstanding his Epithet is I fear almost forgotten had too great a knowledge both of  Shakespeare  and the  Ancients to allow much acquaintance between them and urged very justly on the part of Genius in opposition to Pedantry That "if he had not  read  the Classicks he had likewise not  stolen  from them and if any Topick was produced from a Poet of antiquity he would undertake to show somewhat on the same subject at least as well written by  Shakespeare"  Fuller  a diligent and equal searcher after truth and quibbles declares positively that "his learning was very little  Nature  was all the  Art  used upon him as  he himself  if alive would confess" And may we not say he did confess it when he apologized for his  untutored lines  to his noble patron the Earl of  Southampton  this list of witnesses might be easily enlarged but I flatter myself I shall stand in no need of such evidence  One of the first and most vehement assertors of the learning of  Shakespeare  was the Editor of his Poems the wellknown Mr  Gildon    Hence perhaps the  illstar'd rage  between this Critick and his elder Brother  John Dennis  so pathetically lamented in the  Dunciad  Whilst the former was persuaded that "the man who doubts of the Learning of  Shakespeare  hath none of his own" the latter above regarding the attack in his  private  capacity declares with great patriotic vehemence that "he who allows  Shakespeare  had Learning and a familiar acquaintance with the Ancients ought to be looked upon as a detractor from the Glory of  Great Britain" Dennis  was expelled his College for attempting to stab a man in the dark  Pope  would have been glad of this anecdote  and his steps  were most punctually taken by a subsequent labourer in the same department Dr  Sewel  Mr  Pope  supposed "little ground for the common opinion of his want of learning" once indeed he made a proper distinction between  learning  and  languages  as I would be understood to do in my Titlepage but unfortunately he forgot it in the course of his disquisition and endeavoured to persuade himself that  Shakespeare's  acquaintance with the Ancients might be actually proved by the same medium as  Jonson's  Mr  Theobald  is "very unwilling to allow him so poor a scholar as many have laboured to represent him" and yet is "cautious of declaring too positively on the other side the question"  Dr  Warburton  hath exposed the weakness of some arguments from  suspected  imitations and yet offers others which I doubt not he could as easily have refuted  Mr  Upton  wonders "with what kind of reasoning any one could be so far imposed upon as to imagine that  Shakespeare  had no learning" and lashes with much zeal and satisfaction "the pride and pertness of dunces who under such a name would gladly shelter their own idleness and ignorance"  He like the learned Knight at every anomaly in grammar or metre  "Hath hard words ready to shew why  And tell what  Rule  he did it by"  How would the old Bard have been astonished to have found that he had very skilfully given the  trochaic dimeter brachycatalectic  COMMONLY called the  ithyphallic  measure to the Witches in  Macheth  and that now and then a halting Verse afforded a most beautiful instance of the  Pes proceleusmaticus  "But continues Mr  Upton  it was a learned age  Roger Ascham  assures us that Queen  Elizabeth  read more  Greek  every day than some  Dignitaries  of the Church did  Latin  in a whole week" This appears very probable and a pleasant proof it is of the general learning of the times and of  Shakespeare  in particular I wonder he did not corroborate it with an extract from her injunctions to her Clergy that "such as were but  mean Readers  should peruse over before once or twice the Chapters and Homilies to the intent they might read to the better understanding of the people"  Dr  Grey  declares that  Shakespeare's  knowledge in the  Greek  and  Latin  tongues cannot  reasonably  be called in question Dr  Dodd  supposes it  proved  that he was not such a novice in learning and antiquity as  some people  would pretend And to close the whole for I suspect you to be tired of quotation Mr  Whalley  the ingenious Editor of  Jonson  hath written a piece expressly on this side the question perhaps from a very excusable partiality he was willing to draw  Shakespeare  from the field of Nature to classick ground where alone he knew his Author could possibly cope with him  These criticks and many others their coadjutors have supposed themselves able to trace  Shakespeare  in the writings of the Ancients and have sometimes persuaded us of their own learning whatever became of their Author's Plagiarisms have been discovered in every natural description and every moral sentiment Indeed by the kind assistance of the various  Excerpta Sententiae  and  Flores  this business may be effected with very little expense of time or sagacity as  Addison  hath demonstrated in his Comment on  Chevychace  and  Wagstaff  on  Tom Thumb  and I myself will engage to give you quotations from the elder  English  writers for to own the truth I was once idle enough to collect such which shall carry with them at least an equal degree of similarity But there can be no occasion of wasting any future time in this department the world is now in possession of the  Marks of Imitation  "Shakespeare  however hath frequent allusions to the  facts  and  fables  of antiquity" Grantedand as  Mat Prior  says to save the effusion of more Christian ink I will endeavour to shew how they came to his acquaintance  It is notorious that much of his  matter of fact  knowledge is deduced from  Plutarch  but in what language he read him hath yet been the question Mr  Upton  is pretty confident of his skill in the Original and corrects accordingly the  Errors of his Copyists  by the  Greek  standard Take a few instances which will elucidate this matter sufficiently  In the third act of  Anthony  and  Cleopatra Octavius  represents to his Courtiers the imperial pomp of those illustrious lovers and the arrangement of their dominion  "Unto her  He gave the 'stablishment of Egypt made her  Of lower Syria Cyprus  Lydia  Absolute Queen"  Read  Libya  says the critick  authoritatively  as is plain from  Plutarch    This is very true Mr  Heath  It is extraordinary that this Gentleman should attempt so voluminous a work as the  Revisal of Shakespeare's Text  when he tells us in his Preface "he was not so fortunate as to be furnished with either of the  Folio  Editions much less any of the ancient  Quarto's"  and even "Sir  Thomas Hanmer's  performance was known to him only by Mr  Warburton's  representation"  accedes to the correction and Mr  Johnson  admits it into the Text but turn to the translation from the French of  Amyot  by  Thomas North  in  Folio    I find the character of this work pretty early delineated  "'Twas  Greek  at first that  Greek  was  Latin  made  That  Latin French  that  French  to  English  straid  Thus 'twixt one  Plutarch  there's more difference  Than i'th' same  Englishman  return'd from  France"  and you will at once see the origin of the mistake  "First of all he did establish  Cleopatra  Queene of Aegypt of Cyprus of  Lydia  and the lower Syria"  Again in the Fourth Act  "My messenger  He hath whipt with rods dares me to personal combat  Caesar  to  Anthony  Let th' old Ruffian know  I have many other ways to die mean time  Laugh at his challenge"  "What a reply is this cries Mr  Upton  'tis acknowledging he should fall under the unequal combat But if we read  "Let th' old Ruffian know  He  hath many other ways to die mean time  I  laugh at his challenge"  We have the poignancy and the very repartee of  Caesar  in  Plutarch"  This correction was first made by Sir  Thomas Hanmer  and Mr  Johnson  hath received it Most indisputably it is the sense of  Plutarch  and given so in the modern translations but  Shakespeare  was misled by the ambiguity of the old one  "Antonius  sent again  to challenge  Caesar  to fight him  Caesar  answered That  he  had many other ways to die than so"  In the Third Act of  Julius Caesar Anthony  in his wellknown harangue to the people repeats a part of the Emperor's will  "To every Roman citizen he gives  To every sev'ral man seventy five drachma's  Moreover he hath left you all his walks  His private arbours and newplanted orchards  On  this  side Tyber"  "Our Author certainly wrote says Mr  Theobald  On  that  side Tyber  Travs  Tiberimprope Caesaris hortos  And  Plutarch  whom  Shakespeare  very diligently  studied  expressly declares that he left the publick his gardens and walks    beyond  the  Tyber"  This emendation likewise hath been adopted by the subsequent Editors but hear again the old Translation where  Shakespeare's study  lay "He bequeathed unto every citizen of Rome seventyfive drachmas a man and he left his gardens and arbours unto the people which he had on  this  side of the river of Tyber" I could furnish you with many more instances but these are as good as a thousand  Hence had our author his characteristick knowledge of  Brutus  and  Anthony  upon which much argumentation for his learning hath been founded and  hence  literatim  the Epitaph on  Timon  which it was once presumed he had corrected from the blunders of the Latin version by his own superior knowledge of the Original  See  Theobald's  Preface to K  Richard  d vo  I cannot however omit a passage of Mr  Pope  "The  speeches  copy'd from  Plutarch  in  Coriolanus  may I think be as well made an instance of the learning of  Shakespeare  as those copy'd from  Cicero  in  Catiline  of  Ben Jonson's"  Let us inquire into this matter and transcribe a  speech  for a specimen Take the famous one of  Volumnia  "Should we be silent and not speak our raiment  And state of bodies would bewray what life  We've led since thy Exile Think with thyself  How more unfortunate than all living women  Are we come hither since thy sight which should  Make our eyes flow with joy hearts dance with comforts  Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow  Making the mother wife and child to see  The son the husband and the father tearing  His Country's bowels out and to poor we  Thy enmity's most capital thou barr'st us  Our prayers to the Gods which is a comfort  That all but we enjoy For how can we  Alas how can we for our Country pray  Whereto we're bound together with thy Victory  Whereto we're bound Alack or we must of lose  The Country our dear nurse or else thy Person  Our comfort in the Country We must find  An eminent calamity tho' we had  Our wish which side shou'd win For either thou  Must as a foreign Recreant be led  With manacles thorough our streets or else  Triumphantly tread on thy Country's ruin  And bear the palm for having bravely shed  Thy wife and children's blood For myself son  I purpose not to wait on Fortune 'till  These wars determine if I can't persuade thee  Rather to shew a noble grace to both parts  Than seek the end of one thou shalt no sooner  March to assault thy Country than to tread  Trust to't thou shalt not on thy mother's womb  That brought thee to this world"  I will now give you the old Translation which shall effectually confute Mr  Pope  for our Author hath done little more than thrown the very words of  North  into blank verse  "If we helde our peace my sonne and determined not to speake the state of our poore bodies and present sight of our rayment would easely bewray to thee what life we haue led at home since thy exile and abode abroad But thinke now with thy selfe howe much more unfortunately then all the women liuinge we are come hether considering that the  sight which should be most pleasaunt to all other to beholde spitefull fortune hath made most fearfull to us making my selfe to see my sonne and my daughter here her husband besieging the walles of his natiue countrie So as that which is the only comfort to all other in their adversitie and miserie to pray unto the goddes and to call to them for aide is the onely thinge which plongeth us into most deepe perplexitie For we cannot alas together pray both for victorie for our countrie and for safety of thy life also but a worlde of grievous curses yea more then any mortall enemie can heape uppon us are forcibly wrapt up in our prayers For the bitter soppe of most harde choyce is offered thy wife and children to forgoe the one of the two either to lose the persone of thy selfe or the nurse of their natiue contrie For my selfe my sonne I am determined not to tarrie till fortune in my life time doe make an ende of this warre For if I cannot persuade thee rather to doe good unto both parties then to ouerthrowe and destroye the one preferring loue and nature before the malice and calamitie of warres thou shalt see my sonne and trust unto it thou shalt no soner marche forward to assault thy countrie but thy foote shall tread upon thy mother's wombe that brought thee first into this world"  The length of this quotation will be excused for  it's curiosity and it happily wants not the assistance of a Comment But matters may not always be so easily manageda plagiarism from  Anacreon  hath been detected  "The Sun's a thief and with his great attraction  Robs the vast Sea The Moon's an arrant thief  And her pale fire she snatches from the Sun  The Sea's a thief whose liquid surge resolves  The Moon into salt tears The Earth's a thief  That feeds and breeds by a composture stol'n  From gen'ral excrements each thing's a thief"  "This says Dr  Dodd  is a good deal in the manner of the celebrated  drinking Ode  too well known to be inserted" Yet it may be alleged by those who imagine  Shakespeare  to have been generally able to think for himself that the topicks are obvious and their application is differentBut for argument's sake let the Parody be granted and "our Author says some one may be puzzled to prove that there was a  Latin  translation of  Anacreon  at the time  Shakespeare  wrote his  Timon of Athens"  This challenge is peculiarly unhappy for I do not at present recollect any  other Classick  if indeed with great deference to  Mynheer De Pauw Anacreon  may be numbered amongst them that was  originally  published with  two Latin  By  Henry Stephens  and  Elias Andreas Par  to ten years before the birth of  Shakespeare  The former Version hath been ascribed without reason to  John Dorat  Many other Translators appeared before the end of the Century and particularly the Ode in question was made popular by  Buchanan  whose pieces were soon to be met with in almost every modern language  translations  But this is not all  Puttenham  in his  Arte of English Poesie  quotes some one of a "reasonable good facilitie in translation who finding  certaine  of  Anacreon's  Odes very well translated by  Ronsard  the French poet comes our Minion and translates the same out of  French  into  English"  and his strictures upon him evince the publication Now this identical Ode is to be met with in  Ronsard  and as his works are in few hands I will take the liberty of transcribing it  "La terre les eaux va boivant  L' arbre la boit par sa racine  La mer salee boit le vent  Et le Soleil boit la marine  Le Soleil est beu de la Lune  Tout boit soit en haut ou en bas  Suivant ceste reigle commune  Pourquoy donc ne boironsnous pas"  Edit Fol p  I know not whether an observation of two relative to our Author's acquaintance with  Homer  be worth our investigation The ingenious Mrs  Lenox  observes on a passage of  Troilus and Cressida  where  Achilles  is roused to battle by the death of  Patroclus  that  Shakespeare  must  here  have had the  Iliad  in view as "the old Story  It was originally  drawn into Englishe  by  Caxton  under the name of the  Recuyel of the Historyes of Troy  from the  French  of the  ryght venerable Person and worshipfull man Raoul le Feure  and  fynyshed in the holy citye of Colen the    day of Septembre the yere of our Lord God a thousand foure hundred sixty and enleuen Wynken de Worde  printed an Edit Fol and there have been several subsequent ones  which in many places he hath faithfully copied is absolutely silent with respect to this circumstance"  And Mr  Upton  is positive that the  sweet oblivious Antidote  inquired after by  Macbeth  could be nothing but the  Nepenthe  described in the  Odyssey  "  "  I will not insist upon the Translations by  Chapman  as the first Editions are without date and it may be difficult to ascertain the exact time of their publication But the  former  circumstance might have been learned from  Alexander Barclay    "Who list thistory of  Patroclus  to reade c"  Ship of Fooles  p  and the  latter  more fully from  Spenser  Nepenthe is a drinck of soueragne grace  Deuized by the Gods for to asswage  Harts grief and bitter gall away to chace  In stead thereof sweet peace and quietage  It doth establish in the troubled mynd c"  Faerie Queene  B C St  than from  Homer  himself  "But  Shakespeare  persists Mr  Upton  hath some  Greek Expressions"  Indeed "We have one in  Coriolanus  "It is held  That valour is the chiefest Virtue and  Most dignifies the  Haver"    and another in  Macbeth  where  Banquo  addresses the  WeïrdSisters  "My noble Partner  You greet with present grace and great prediction  Of noble  Having"    Gr  and  to the  Haver"  This was the common language of  Shakespeare's  time "Lye in a waterbearer's house says Master  Mathew  of  Bobadil  a Gentleman of his  Havings"  Thus likewise  John Davies  in his  Pleasant Descant upon English Proverbs  printed with his  Scourge of Folly  about  "Do well and have well  neyther so still  For some are good  Doers  whose  Havings  are ill"  and  Daniel  the Historian uses it frequently  Having  seems to be synonymous with  Behaviour  in  Gawin Douglas  It is very remarkable that the Bishop is called by his Countryman Sir  David Lindsey  in his  Complaint of our Souerane Lordis Papingo  "In  our Inglische  Rethorick the Rose"  And  Dunbar  hath a similar expression in his beautiful Poem of  The Goldin Terge  and the elder Scotch writers  Haver  in the sense of  Possessor  is every where met with tho' unfortunately the  of  Sophocles  produced as an authority for it is suspected by  Kuster  Aristophanis  Comoediae undecim Gr Lat  Amst  Fol p  as good a critick in these matters to have absolutely a different meaning  But what shall we say to the learning of the  Clown  in  Hamlet  "Ay tell me that and  unyoke"  alluding to the  of the  Greeks  and  Homer  and his Scholiast are quoted accordingly  If it be not sufficient to say with Dr  Warburton  that the phrase might be taken from Husbandry without much depth of reading we may produce it from a  Dittie  of the workmen of  Dover  preserved in the additions to  Holingshed  p  "My bow is broke I would  unyoke  My foot is sore I can worke no more"  An expression of my Dame  Quickly  is next fastened upon which you may look for in vain in the modern text she calls some of the pretended Fairies in the  Merry Wives of Windsor    "Orphan  Dr  Warburton  corrects  Orphan  to  Ouphen  and not without plausibility as the word  Ouphes  occurs both before and afterward But I fancy in acquiescence to the vulgar doctrine the address in this line is to apart of the  Troop  as Mortals by birth but adopted by the Fairies  Orphans  with respect to their  real  Parents and now only dependant on  Destiny  herself A few lines from  Spenser  will sufficiently illustrate the passage  "The man whom  heauens  have  ordaynd  to bee  The spouse of  Britomart  is  Arthegall  He wonneth in the land of  Fayeree  Yet is no  Fary  borne ne sib at all  To Elfes but sprong of seed terrestriall  And whilome by false  Faries  stolen away  Whyles yet in infant cradle he did crall c"  Edit B C St  Heirs of fixed Destiny"  and how elegant is this quoth Mr  Upton  supposing the word to be used as a  Grecian  would have used it  ab  acting in darkness and obscurity"  Mr  Heath  assures us that the bare mention of such an interpretation is a sufficient refutation of it and his critical word will be rather taken in  Greek  than in  English  in the same hands therefore I will venture to leave all our author's knowledge of the  Old Comedy  and his etymological learning in the word  Desdemona  Revisal  p  Surely poor Mr  Upton  was very little acquainted with  Fairies  notwithstanding his laborious study of  Spenser  The last authentick account of them is from our countryman  William Lilly    History of his Life and Times p preserved by his Dupe Mr  Ashmole  and it by no means agrees with the  learned  interpretation for the  angelical  Creatures  appeared in his  Hurst  wood in a  most illustrious Glory  "and indeed says the Sage it is not given to very many persons to endure their  glorious aspects"  The only use of transcribing these things is to shew what absurdities men for ever run into when they lay down an Hypothesis and afterward seek for arguments in the support of it What else could induce this man by no means a bad scholar to doubt whether  Truepenny  might not be derived from  and quote upon us with much parade an old Scholiast on  Aristophanes  I will not stop to confute him nor take any notice of two or three more Expressions in which he was pleased to suppose some learned meaning or other all which he might have found in every Writer of the time or still more easily in the vulgar Translation of the Bible by consulting the Concordance of  Alexander Cruden  But whence have we the Plot of  Timon  except from the  Greek  of  Lucian  The Editors and Criticks have been never at a greater loss than in their inquiries of this sort and the source of a Tale hath been often in vain sought abroad which might easily have been found at home My good friend the very ingenious Editor of the  Reliques of ancient English Poetry  hath shewn our Author to have been sometimes contented with a legendary  Ballad  The Story of the  Misanthrope  is told in almost every Collection of the time and particulary in two books with which  Shakespeare  was intimately acquainted the  Palace of Pleasure  and the  English Plutarch  Indeed from a passage in an old Play called  Jack Drums Entertainement  I conjecture that he had before made his appearance on the Stage  Were this a proper place for such a disquisition I could give you many cases of this kind We are sent for instance to  Cinthio  for the Plot of  Measure for Measure  and  Shakespeare's  judgement hath been attacked for some deviations from him in the conduct of it when probably all he knew of the matter was from Madam  Isabella  in the  Heptameron  of  Whetstone  Lond to She  reports  in the fourth dayes exercise the rare  Historie  of  Promos and Cassandra  A marginal note informs us that  Whetstone  was the Author of the  Commedie  on that subject which likewise had probably fallen into the hands of  Shakespeare  Ariosto  is continually quoted for the Fable of  Much ado about Nothing  but I suspect our Poet to have been satisfied with the  Geneura  of  Turberville  "The tale is a pretie comicall matter and hath bin written in  English  verse some few years past learnedly and with good grace by M  George Turberuil" Harrington's Ariosto  Fol p  As you like it  was  certainly borrowed  if we believe Dr  Grey  and Mr  Upton  from the  Coke's Tale of Gamelyn  which by  the way was not  printed  'till a century afterward when in truth the old Bard who was no hunter of MSS contented himself solely with  Lodge's Rosalynd  or  Euphues' Golden Legacye  to The Story of  All's well that ends well  or as I suppose it to have been sometimes called  Love's labour wonne  See  Meres's Wits Treasury  p  is originally indeed the property of  Boccace  Our ancient Poets are under greater obligations to  Boccace  than is generally imagined Who would suspect that  Chaucer  hath borrowed from an  Italian  the facetious Tale of the  Miller of Trumpington  Mr  Dryden  observes on the Epic performance  Palamon and Arcite  a poem little inferior in his opinion to the  Iliad  or the  Aeneid  that the name of it's Author is wholly lost and  Chaucer  is now become the Original But he is mistaken this too was the work of  Boccace  and printed at  Ferrara  in Folio  con il commento di Andrea Bassi  I have seen a copy of it and a Translation into modern  Greek  in the noble Library of the very learned and communicative Dr  Askew  It is likewise to be met with in old  French  under the Title of  La Theseide  de  Jean Boccace  contenant les belles chastes amours de deux jeunes Chevaliers Thebains  Arcite Palemon  but it came immediately to  Shakespeare  from  Painter's Giletta  of  Narbon  In the first Vol of the  Palace of Pleasure  to  Mr  Langbaine  could not conceive whence the Story of  Pericles  could be taken "not meeting in History with any such  Prince of Tyre"  yet his legend  may be found at large in old  Gower  under the name of  Appolynus  Confessio Amantis  printed by  T Berthelet  Fol p c  Pericles  is one of the Plays omitted in the later Editions as well as the early Folio's and not improperly tho' it was published many years before the death of  Shakespeare  with his name in the Titlepage  Aulus Gellius  informs us that some Plays are ascribed absolutely to  Plautus  which he only  retouched  and  polished  and this is undoubtedly the case with our Author likewise The revival of this performance which  Ben Jonson  calls  stale  and  mouldy  was probably his earliest attempt in the Drama I know that another of these discarded pieces the  Yorkshire Tragedy  hath been frequently called so but most certainly it was not written by our Poet at all nor indeed was it printed in his lifetime The Fact on which it is built was perpetrated no sooner than  "William Caluerley  of  Caluerley  in  Yorkshire  Esquire murdered two of his owne children in his owne house then stabde his wife into the body with full intent to haue killed her and then instantlie with like fury went from his house to haue slaine his yongest childe at nurse but was preuented Hee was prest to death in  Yorke  the of  August  "  Edm Howes'  Continuation of  John Stowe's  Summarie vo p The Story appeared before in a to Pamphlet it is ommitted in the  Folio  Chronicle  much too late for so mean a performance from the hand of  Shakespeare  Sometimes a very little matter detects a forgery You may remember a Play called the  Double Falshood  which Mr  Theobald  was desirous of palming upon the world for a posthumous one of  Shakespeare  and I see it is classed as such in the last Edition of the  Bodleian  Catalogue Mr  Pope  himself after all the strictures of  Scriblerus  These however he assures Mr  Hill  were the property of Dr  Arbuthnot  in a Letter to  Aaron Hill  supposes it of that age but a mistaken accent determines it to have been written since the middle of the last century  "This late example  Of base Henriquez bleeding in me now  From each good  Aspect  takes away my trust"  And in another place  "You have an  Aspect  Sir of wondrous wisdom"  The word  Aspect  you perceive is here accented on the  first  Syllable which I am confident in  any  sense of it was never the case in the time of  Shakespeare  though it may sometimes appear to be so when we do not observe a preceding  Elision  Thus a line in  Hamlet's  description of the  Player  should be printed as in the old Folio's  "Tears in his eyes distraction in's aspéct"  agreeably to the accent in a hundred other places  Some of the professed Imitators of our old Poets have not attended to this and many other  Minutiae  I could point out to you several performances in the respective  Styles  of  Chaucer Spenser  and  Shakespeare  which the  imitated  Bard could not possibly have either read or construed  This very accent hath troubled the Annotators on  Milton  Dr  Bentley  observes it to be "a  tone  different from the present use" Mr  Manwaring  in his  Treatise of Harmony and Numbers  very solemnly informs us that "this Verse is defective both in Accent and Quantity B V  "His words here ended but his meek  Aspéct  Silent yet spake"  Here says he a syllable is  acuted  and  long  whereas it should be  short  and  graved"  And a still more extraordinary Gentleman one  Green  who published a Specimen of a  new Version  of the  Paradise Lost  into BLANK verse "by which that amazing Work is brought somewhat nearer the Summit of Perfection" begins with correcting a blunder in the fourth book V  "The setting Sun  Slowly defended and with right  Aspéct    Levell'd his evening rays"  Not so  in the  New Version  "Meanwhile the setting Sun descending slow  Level'd with  áspect  right his ev'ning rays"  Enough of such CommentatorsThe celebrated  Dr  Dee  had a  Spirit  who would sometimes condescend to correct him when peccant in  Quantity  and it had been kind of him to have a little assisted the  Wights  abovementioned  Milton  affected the  Antique  but it may seem more extraordinary that the old Accent should be adopted in  Hudibras  After all the  Double Falshood  is superior to  Theobald  One passage and one only in the whole Play he pretended to have written  "Strike up my Masters  "But touch the Strings with a religious softness  "Teach sound to languish thro' the Night's dull Ear  "'Till Melancholy start from her lazy Couch  "And Carelessness grow Convert to Attention"  These lines were particularly admired and his vanity could not resist the opportunity of claiming them but his claim had been more easily allowed to  any other  part of the performance  To whom then shall we ascribe it Somebody hath told us who should seem to be a  Nostrummonger  by his argument that let  Accents  be how they will it is called  an original Play of William Shakespeare  in the  King's Patent  prefixed to Mr  Theobald's  Edition and consequently there  could  be no fraud in the matter Whilff on the contrary the  Irish  Laureat Mr  Victor  remarks and were it true it would be certainly decisive that the  Plot is borrowed from a Novel of  Cervantes  not published 'till the year after  Shakespeare's  death But unluckily the same Novel appears in a part of  Don Quixote  which was printed in  Spanish  and in  English  by  Shelton  The same reasoning however which exculpated our Author from the  Yorkshire Tragedy  may be applied on the present occasion  But you want  my  opinion and from every mark of Style and Manner I make no doubt of ascribing it to  Shirley  Mr  Langbaine  informs us that he left some Plays in MS These were written about the time of the  Restoration  when the  Accent  in question was more generally altered  Perhaps the mistake arose from an  abbreviation  of the name Mr  Dodsley  knew not that the Tragedy of  Andromana  was  Shirley's  from the very same cause Thus a whole stream of Biographers tell us that  Marston's  Plays were printed at  London  "by the care of  William Shakespeare  the famous Comedian"Here again I suppose in some Transcript the real Publisher's name  William Sheares  was  abbreviated  No one hath protracted the life of  Shakespeare  beyond except Mr  Hume  who is pleased to add a year to it in contradiction to all manner of evidence  Shirley  is spoken of with contempt in  Mac Flecknoe    but his Imagination is sometimes fine to an extraordinary degree I recollect a passage in the fourth book of the  Paradise Lost  which hath been suspected of  Imitation  as a  prettiness  below the Genius of  Milton  I mean where  Uriel  glides  backward and forward  to Heaven on a  Sunbeam  Dr  Newton  informs us that this might possibly be hinted by a Picture of  Annibal Carracci  in the King of  France's  Cabinet but I am apt to believe that  Milton  had been struck with a Portrait in  Shirley Fernando  in the Comedy of the  Brothers  describes  Jacinta  at  Vespers  "Her eye did seem to labour with a tear  Which suddenly took birth but overweigh'd  With it's own swelling drop'd upon her bosome  Which by reflexion of her light appear'd  As nature meant her sorrow for an ornament  After her looks grew chearfull and I saw  A smile shoot gracefull upward from her eyes  As if they had gain'd a victory o'er grief  And with it many  beams  twisted themselves  Upon whose  golden threads  the  Angels  walk  To and again from Heaven"  Middleton  in an obscure Play called  A Game at Chesse  hath some very pleasing lines on a similar occasion  "Upon those lips the sweete fresh buds of youth  The holy dew of prayer lies like pearle  Dropt from the opening eyelids of the morne  Upon the bashfull Rose"    You must not think me infected with the spirit of  Lauder  if I give you another of  Milton's  Imitations  "The Swan  with arched neck  "Between her white wings mantling proudly rows  "Her state with oary feet"  B V c  "The ancient Poets says Mr  Richardson  have not hit upon this beauty so lavish as they have been in their descriptions of the  Swan Homer  calls the Swan  longnecked  but how much more  pittoresque  if he had  arched  this length of neck"  For  this beauty  however  Milton  was beholden to  Donne  whose name I believe at present is better known than his writings  "Like a Ship in her full trim  A  Swan  so white that you may unto him  Compare all whitenesse but himselfe to none  Glided along and as he glided watch'd  And with his  arched neck  this poore fish catch'd"  Progresse of the Soul  St  Those highly finished Landscapes the  Seasons  are indeed copied from Nature but  Thomson  sometimes recollected the hand of his Master  "The stately sailing Swan  Gives out his snowy plumage to the gale  And arching proud his Neck with oary feet  Bears forward fierce and guards his osier Isle  Protective of his young"  But  to return  as we say on other occasions Perhaps the Advocates for  Shakespeare's  knowledge of the  Latin  language may be more successful Mr  Gildon  takes the Van "It is plain that He was acquainted with the  Fables  of antiquity very well that some of the Arrows of  Cupid  are pointed with Lead and others with Gold he found in  Ovid  and what he speaks of  Dido  in  Virgil  nor do I know any translation of these Poets so ancient as  Shakespeare's  time" The passages on which these sagacious remarks are made occur in the  Midsummer Night's Dream  and exhibit we see a clear proof of acquaintance with the  Latin  Classicks But we are not answerable for Mr  Gildon's  ignorance he might have been told of  Caxton  and  Douglas  of  Surrey  and  Stanyhurst  of  Phaer  and  Twyne  of  Fleming  and  Golding  of  Turberville  and  Churchyard  but these  Fables  were easily known without the help of either the originals or the translations The Fate of  Dido  had been sung very early by  Gower Chaucer  and  Lydgate Marloe  had even already introduced her to the Stage and  Cupid's  arrows appear with their characteristick differences in  Surrey  in  Sidney  in  Spenser  and every Sonetteer of the time Nay their very names were exhibited long before in the  Romaunt of the Rose  a work you may venture to look into notwithstanding Master  Prynne  hath so positively assured us on  the word of  John Gerson  that the Author is most certainly damned if he did not care for a serious repentance  Had our zealous Puritan been acquainted with the real crime of  De Mehun  he would not have joined in the clamour against him Poor  Jehan  it seems had raised the expectations of a Monastery in  France  by the Legacy of a great Chest and the weighty Contents of it but it proved to be filled with nothing better than  Vetches  The Friars enraged at the ridicule and disappointment would not suffer him to have Christian burial See the Hon Mr  Barrington's  very learned and curious  Observations on the Statutes  to p From the  Annales d' Acquytayne Par    Our Author had his full share in distressing the Spirit of this restless man "Some Playbooks are grown from  Quarto  into  Folio  which yet bear so good a price and sale that I cannot but with griefe relate it  Shackspeers Plaies  are printed in the best Crownepaper far better than most  Bibles"  Mr  Whalley  argues in the same manner and with the same success He thinks a passage in the  Tempest  "High Queen of State  Great  Juno  comes I know her by her  Gait"  a remarkable instance of  Shakespeare's  knowledge of ancient Poetick story and that the hint was furnished by the  Divûm incedo Regina  of  Virgil  Others would give up this passage for the  Vera incessu patuit Dea  but I am not able to see any improvement in the matter even supposing the Poet had been speaking of  Juno  and no previous Translation were extant  You know honest  John Taylor  the  Waterpoet  declares that  he never learned his Accidence  and that  Latin and French  were to him  HeathenGreek  yet by the help of Mr  Whalley's  argument I will prove him a  learned  Man in spite of every thing he may say to the contrary for thus he makes a  Gallant  address his  Lady  "Most inestimable Magazine of Beauty in whom  the Port and Majesty of Juno  the Wisdom of  Jove's  brainebred Girle and the Feature of  Cytherea  This passage recalls to my memory a very extraordinary fact A few years ago at a great Court on the Continent a Countryman of our's of high rank and character Sir  C H W  exhibited with many other Candidates his complimental Epigram on the Birthday and carried the prize in triumph  "O Regina orbis prima pulcherrima ridens  Es Venus incedens Juno Minerva loquens"  Literally  stolen from  Angerianus  "Tres quondam nudas vidit Priameius heros  Luce deas video tres quoque luce deas  Hoc majus tres uno in corpore  Coelia ridens  Est Venus incedens Juno Minerva loquens"  Delitiae Ital Poet by  Gruter  under the anagrammatic Name of  Ranutius Gherus  V p  Perhaps the  latter part  of the Epigram was met with in a whimsical book which had it's day of Fame  Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy  Fol th Edit p  have their domestical habitation"  In the  Merchant of Venice  we have an oath "By  twoheaded Janus  " and here says Dr  Warburton Shakespeare  shews his knowledge in the Antique and  so again does the  Waterpoet  who describes  Fortune  "Like a  Janus  with a  doubleface"  But  Shakespeare  hath somewhere at  Latin Motto  quoth Dr  Sewel  and so hath  John Taylor  and a whole Poem upon it into the bargain  You perceive my dear Sir how vague and indeterminate such arguments must be for in fact this  sweet Swan of Thames  as Mr  Pope  calls him hath more scraps of  Latin  and allusions to antiquity than are any where to be met with in the writings of  Shakespeare  I am sorry to trouble you with trifles yet what must be done when grave men insist upon them  It should seem to be the opinion of some modern criticks that the personages of classick land began only to be known in  England  in the time of  Shakespeare  or rather that he particularly had the honour of introducing them to the notice of his countrymen  For instance  Rumour painted full of tongues  gives us a Prologue to one of the parts of  Henry the Fourth  and says Dr  Dodd Shakespeare  had doubtless a view to either  Virgil  or  Ovid  in their description of  Fame  But why so  Stephen Hawes  in his  Pastime of Pleasure  had long before exhibited her in the same manner  "A goodly Lady envyroned about  With  tongues  of fyre"  Cap to    and so had Sir  Thomas More  in one of his  Pageants  Amongst "the things which Mayster  More  wrote in his youth for his pastime" prefixed to his  Workes  Fol  "Fame  I am called mervayle you nothing  Though with  tonges  I am compassed all rounde"  not to mention her elaborate Portrait by  Chaucer  in the  Boke of Fame  and by  John Higgins  one of the Assistants in the  Mirour for Magistrates  in his Legend of King  Albanacte  A very liberal Writer on the  Beauties of Poetry  who hath been more conversant in the ancient Literature of other Countries than his own "cannot but wonder that a Poet whose classical Images are composed of the finest parts and breath the very spirit of ancient Mythology should pass for being illiterate"  "See what a grace was seated on his brow  Hyperion's  curls the front of  Jove  himself  An eye like  Mars  to threaten and command  A station like the herald  Mercury  New lighted on a heavenkissing hill"  Hamlet  Illiterate  is an ambiguous term the question is whether Poetick History could be only known by an Adept in  Languages  It is no reflection on this ingenious Gentleman when I say that I use on this occasion the words of a  better  Critick who yet was not willing to carry the  illiteracy  of our Poet  too far    "They who are in such astonishment at the  learning  of  Shakespeare  forget that the Pagan Imagery was familiar to all the Poets of his time and that abundance of this sort of learning was to be picked up from almost every  English  book that he could take into his hands" For not to insist upon  Stephen Bateman's  Golden booke of the leaden Goddes and several other laborious compilations on the subject all this and much more Mythology might as perfectly have been learned from the  Testament of Creseide  Printed amongst the Works of  Chaucer  but really written by  Robert Henderson  and the  Fairy Queen  It is observable that  Hyperion  is used by  Spenser  with the same error in  quantity  as from a regular  Pantheon  or  Polymetis  himself  Mr  Upton  not contented with  Heathen  learning when he finds it in the text must necessarily superadd it when it appears to be wanting because  Shakespeare  most certainly hath lost it by accident  In  Much ado about Nothing  Don  Pedro  says of the insensible  Benedict  "He hath twice or thrice cut  Cupid's  bowstring and the little  Hangman  dare not shoot at him"  This mythology is not recollected in the Ancients and therefore the critick hath no doubt but his Author wrote  "Henchmana Page Pusio  and  this  word seeming too hard for the Printer he translated the  little Urchin into a  Hangman  a character no way belonging to him"  But this character was not borrowed from the Ancients it came from the  Arcadia  of Sir  Philip Sidney  "Millions of yeares this old drivell  Cupid  lives  While still more wretch more wicked he doth prove  Till now at length that  Jove  him office gives  At  Juno's  suite who much did  Argus  love  In this our world a  Hangman  for to be  Of all those fooles that will have all they see"  B Ch  I know it may be objected on the authority of such Biographers as  Theophilus Cibber  and the Writer of the Life of Sir  Philip  prefixed to the modern Editions that the  Arcadia  was not published before and consequently too late for this imitation but I have a Copy in my own possession printed for  W Ponsonbie  to which hath escaped the notice of the industrious  Ames  and the rest of our typographical Antiquaries  Thus likewise every word of antiquity is to be cut down to the classical standard  In a Note on the Prologue to  Troilus  and  Cressida  which by the way is not met with in the  Quarto  Mr  Theobald  informs us that the very  names  of the gates of  Troy  have been barbarously demolished by the Editors and a deal of learned dust he makes in  setting them right again much however to Mr  Heath's  satisfaction Indeed the learning is modestly withdrawn from the later Editions and we are quietly instructed to read  "Dardan  and  Thymbria Ilia Scaea Troian  And  Antenorides"  But had he looked into the  Troye boke  of  Lydgate  instead of puzzling himself with  Dares Phrygius  he would have found the horrid demolition to have been neither the work of  Shakespeare  nor his Editors  "Therto his cyte compassed enuyrowne  Hadde gates VI to entre into the towne  The firste of all and strengest eke with all  Largest also and moste pryncypall  Of myghty byldyng alone pereless  Was by the kynge called  Dardanydes    And in storye lyke as it is founde  Tymbria  was named the seconde  And the thyrde called  Helyas  The fourthe gate hyghte also  Cetheas    The fyfthe  Trojana  the syxth  Anthonydes  Stronge and myghty both in werre and pes"  The  Troye Boke  was somewhat modernized and reduced into regular Stanza's about the beginning of the last century under the name of the  "Life and Death of Hector  who fought a hundred mayne Battailes in open field against the  Grecians  wherein there were slaine on both sides  Fourteene Hundred and Sixe Thousand Fourscore and Sixe men" Fol no date  This work Dr  Fuller  and several other criticks have erroneously quoted as the  Original  and observe in consequence that "if  Chaucer's Coin  were of  greater weight  for  deeper learning Lydgate's  were of a more  refined standard  for  purer language  so that one might mistake him for a modern Writer"  Let me here make an observation for the benefit of the next Editor of  Chaucer  Mr  Urry  probably misled by his predecessor  Speght  was determined  Procrusteslike  to  force  every line in the  Canterbury Tales  to the same Standard but a precise number of Syllables was not the Object of our old Poets  Lydgate  after the example of his Master very fairly acknowledges  "Well wot I moche thing is wronge  Falsely metryd both of short and longe"  and  Chaucer  himself was persuaded that the  Rime  might possibly be  "Somewhat agreáble  Though some Verse faile in a Sylláble"  In short the attention was directed to the  Caesural pause  as the  Grammarians  call it which is carefully  marked  in every line of  Lydgate  and  Gascoigne  in his  Certayne notes of Instruction concerning the making of Verse  observes very truly of  Chaucer  "Whosoeuer do peruse and well consider his workes he shall find that although his lines are not alwayes of one selfe same number of Syllables yet beyng redde by one that hath understanding the longest verse and that which hath most syllables in it will fall to the Eare correspondent unto that which hath fewest syllables in it and likewise that whiche hath in it fewest syllables shall be founde yet to consist of wordes that have suche naturall sounde as may seeme equall in length to a verse which hath many moe syllables of lighter accents" to  Lond empr by  R Pynson  Fol B Ch  Our excellent friend Mr  Hurd  hath born a noble testimony on our side of the question  "Shakespeare  says this true Critick owed the felicity of freedom from the bondage of classical superstition to the  want  of what is called the  advantage  of a learned EducationThis as well as a vast superiority of Genius hath contributed to lift this astonishing man to the glory of being esteemed the most original  thinker  and  speaker  since the times of  Homer"  And hence indisputably the amazing Variety of Style and Manner unknown to all other Writers an argument of  itself  sufficient to emancipate  Shakespeare  from the supposition of a  Classical training  Yet to be honest  one  Imitation is  fastened  on our Poet which hath been insisted upon likewise by Mr  Upton  and Mr  Whalley  You remember it in the famous Speech of  Claudio  in  Measure for Measure  "Ay but to die and go we know not where c"  Most certainly the Ideas of a "Spirit bathing in fiery floods" of residing "in thrilling regions of thickribbed ice" or of being "imprisoned in the viewless winds" are not  original  in our Author but I am not sure that they came from the  Platonick Hell  of  Virgil  "Aliae panduntur inanes  Suspensae ad ventos aliis sub gurgite vasto  Infectum eluitur scelus aut exuritur igni"  The Monks also had their hot and their cold Hell "the fyrste is fyre that ever brenneth  and never gyveth lighte says an old Homily  At the ende of the  Festyuall  drawen oute of  Legenda aurea  to it was first printed by  Caxton  "in helpe of such Clerkes who excuse theym for defaute of bokes and also by symplenes of connynge"  The seconde is passyng colde that yf a grete hylle of fyre were casten therin it sholde torne to yce" One of their Legends well remembered in the time of  Shakespeare  gives us a Dialogue between a Bishop and a Soul tormented in a piece of ice which was brought to cure  a grete brenning heate  in his foot  On all soules daye  p  take care you do not interpret this the  Gout  for I remember  M Menage  quotes a  Canon  upon us  "Si quis dixerit Episcopum PODAGRA laborare Anathema sit"  Another tells us of the Soul of a Monk fastened to a Rock which the winds were to blow about for a twelvemonth and purge of it's Enormities Indeed this doctrine was before now introduced into poetick fiction as you may see in a Poem "where the Lover declareth his pains to exceed far the pains of Hell" among the many miscellaneous ones subjoined to the Works of  Surrey  Nay a very learned and inquisitive BrotherAntiquary our  Greek  Professor hath observed to me on the authority of  Blefkenius  that this was the ancient opinion of the inhabitants  of  Iceland    Islandiae  Descript  Lugd Bat  p  who were certainly very little read either in the  Poet  or the  Philosopher  After all  Shakespeare's  curiosity might lead him to  Translations Gawin Douglas  really changes the  Platonick Hell  into the "punytion of Saulis in Purgatory" and it is observable that when the  Ghost  informs  Hamlet  of his Doom there  "Till the foul crimes done in his days of nature  Are  burnt and purg'd away"    the Expression is very similar to the Bishop's I will give you his Version as concisely as I can "It is a nedeful thyng to suffer panis and torment Sum in the wyndis Sum under the watter and in the fire uthir Sum thus the mony Vices  "Contrakkit in the corpis be  done away  And purgit"    Sixte Booke of Eneados  Fol p  It seems however that  "Shakespeare himself  in the  Tempest  hath translated some expressions of  Virgil  witness the  O Dea certe"  I presume we are here directed to the passage where  Ferdinand  says of  Miranda  after hearing the Songs of  Ariel  "Most sure the Goddess  On whom these airs attend"  and so  very small Latin  is sufficient for this formidable translation that if it be thought any honour to our  Poet I am loth to deprive him of it but his honour is not built on such a sandy foundation Let us turn to a  real Translator  and examine whether the Idea might not be fully comprehended by an  English  reader  supposing  it necessarily borrowed from  Virgil Hexameters  in our own language are almost forgotten we will quote therefore this time from  Stanyhurst  "O to thee fayre Virgin what terme may rightly be fitted  Thy tongue thy visage no mortal frayltie resembleth  No doubt a Godesse"  Edit  Gabriel Harvey  desired only to be  "Epitaph'd  the Inventor of the  English Hexameter"  and for a while every one would be  halting on Roman feet  but the ridicule of our Fellow Collegian  Hall  in one of his  Satires  and the reasoning of  Daniel  in his  Defence of Rhyme  against  Campion  presently reduced us to our original  Gothic  But to come nearer the purpose what will you say if I can shew you that  Shakespeare  when in the favourite phrase he had a  Latin  Poet  in his Eye  most assuredly made use of a Translation  Prospero  in the  Tempest  begins the Address to his attendant  Spirits  "Ye Elves of Hills of standing Lakes and Groves"  This speech Dr  Warburton  rightly observes to be borrowed from  Medea  in  Ovid  and "it proves says  Mr  Holt  In some Remarks on the  Tempest  published under the quaint Title of "An attempte to rescue that aunciente English Poet and Playwrighte Maister  Williaume Shakespeare  from the many Errours faulsely charged upon him by certaine newfangled Wittes"  Lond  vo p  beyond contradiction that  Shakespeare  was perfectly acquainted with the Sentiments of the Ancients on the Subject of Inchantments" The original lines are these  "Auraeque venti montesque amnesque lacusque  Diique omnes nemorum diique omnes noctis adeste"  It happens however that the translation by  Arthur Golding  His work is dedicated to the Earl of  Leicester  in a long Epistle in verse from  Berwicke  Apr  is by no means literal and  Shakespeare  hath closely followed it  "Ye Ayres and Winds  Ye Elves of Hills  of Brookes of Woods alone  Of standing Lakes  and of the Night approche ye everych one"  I think it is unnecessary to pursue this any further especially as more powerful arguments await us  In the  Merchant of Venice  the  Jew  as an apology for his cruelty to  Anthonio  rehearses many  Sympathies  and  Antipathies  for which  no reason can be rendered  "Some love not a gaping Pig  And others when a  Bagpipe  sings i'th' nose  Cannot contain their urine for  affection"  This incident Dr  Warburton  supposes to be taken from a passage in  Scaliger's Exercitations  against  Cardan  "Narrabo tibi jocosam Sympathiam  Reguli Vasconis  Equitis Is dum viveret audito  Phormingis  sono urinam illico facere cogebatur" And proceeds the  Doctor  to make this jocular story still more ridiculous  Shakespeare  I suppose translated  Phorminx  by  Bagpipes  Here we seem fairly caught for  Scaliger's  work was never as the term goes  done into English  But luckily in an old translation from the  French  of  Peter Le Loier  entitled  A treatise of Specters or straunge Sights Visions and Apparitions appearing sensibly unto men  we have this identical Story from  Scaliger  and what is still more a marginal Note gives us in all probability the very fact alluded to as well as the word of  Shakespeare  "Another Gentleman of this quality liued of late in Deuon neere Excester who could not endure the playing on a  Bagpipe"  M  Bayle  hath delineated the singular character of our  fantastical  Author His work was originally translated by one  Zacharie Jones  My Edit is in to with an anonymous Dedication to the King the  Devonshire  Story was therefore well known in the time of  Shakespeare  The passage from  Scaliger  is likewise to be met with in  The Optick Glasse of Humors  written I believe by  T Wombwell  and in several other places  We may just add as some observation hath been made upon it that  Affection  in the sense of  Sympathy  was  formerly  technical  and so used by Lord  Bacon  Sir  Kenelm Digby  and many other Writers  A single word in Queen  Catherine's  Character of  Wolsey  in  Henry  the th is brought by the  Doctor  as another argument for the learning of  Shakespeare  "He was a man  Of an unbounded Stomach ever ranking  Himself with Princes one that by  Suggestion  Ty'd all the kingdom Simony was fair play  His own opinion was his law i'th' presence  He would say untruths and be ever double  Both in his words and meaning He was never  But where he meant to ruin pitiful  His promises were as he then was mighty  But his performance as he now is nothing  Of his own body he was ill and gave  The Clergy ill example"  The word  Suggestion  says the Critick is here used with great propriety and  seeming  knowledge of the Latin tongue and he proceeds to settle the sense of it from  the late Roman writers and their glossers  But  Shakespeare's  knowledge was from  Holingshed  whom he follows  verbatim  "This Cardinal was of a great stomach for he compted himself equal with princes and by craftie  Suggestion  got into his hands innumerable treasure he forced little on simonie and was not pitifull and  stood affectionate in his own opinion in open presence he would lie and seie untruth and was double both in speech and meaning he would promise much and performe little he was vicious of his bodie and gaue the clergie euil example" Edit p  Perhaps after this quotation you may not think that Sir  Thomas Hanmer  who reads  Tyth'd  instead of  Ty'd all the kingdom  deserves quite so much of Dr  Warburton's  severity Indisputably the passage like every other in the Speech is intended to express the meaning of the parallel one in the Chronicle it cannot therefore be credited that any man when the  Original  was produced should still chuse to defend a  cant  acceptation and inform us perhaps  seriously  that in  gaming  language from I know not what practice to  tye  is to  equal  A sense of the word as far as I have yet found  unknown  to our old Writers and if  known  would not surely have been used in  this  place by our Author  But let us turn from conjecture to  Shakespeare's  authorities  Hall  from whom the above description is copied by  Holingshed  is very explicit in the demands of the  Cardinal  who having insolently told the  Lord Mayor  and  Aldermen  "For sothe I thinke that  halfe  your substaunce were to litle" assures them by way of comfort at the end of his harangue that  upon an average  the  tythe  should be sufficient "Sers speake not to breake that thyng that is concluded for  some  shal not paie the  tenth  parte and  some  more" And again "Thei saied the Cardinall by Visitacions makyng of Abbottes probates of testamentes graunting of faculties licences and other pollyngs in his Courtes legantines had made his  threasore egall with the kynges"  Edit p and  Skelton  His Poems are printed with the title of "Pithy Pleasaunt and Profitable Workes of Maister  Skelton Poete Laureate"  But says Mr  Cibber  after several other Writers "how or by what Interest he was made  Laureat  or whether it was a title he assumed to himself cannot be determined" This is an error pretty generally received and it may be worth our while to remove it  A facetious Author says somewhere that a  Poet Laureat  in the modern Idea is a Gentleman who hath an annual Stipend for reminding us of the  Neva Year  and the  Birthday  but formerly a  Poet Laureat  was a real  University Graduate  "Skelton  wore the Lawrell wreath  And past in  schoels  ye knoe"  says  Churchyarde  in the Poem prefixed to his Works And Master  Caxton  in his Preface to  The boke of Eneydos  hath a passage which well deserves to be quoted without abridgment "I praye mayster  John Skelton late created poete laureate in the unyversite of Oxenforde  to oversee and correcte thys sayd booke and taddresse and expowne whereas shall be founde faulte to theym that shall requyre it for hym I knowe for suffycyent to expowne and Englysshe every dyfficulte that is therein for he hath late translated the epystles of  Tulle  and the book of  Dyodorus Syculus  and diverse other workes out of  Latyn  into  Englisshe  not in rude and old langage but in polyshed and ornate termes craftely as he that hath redde  Vyrgyle Ouyde Tullye  and all the other noble poets and oratours to me unknowen and also he hath redde the IX muses and understands their musicalle scyences and to whom of them eche scyence is appropred I suppose he hath dronken of  Elycons  well"  I find from Mr  Baker's  MSS that our  Laureat  was admitted  ad eundem  at  Cambridge  "An Dom Hen nono Conceditur  Jobī Skelton  Poete in partibus transmarinis atque  Oxon  Laureâ ornato ut apud nos eâdem decoraretur" And afterward "An Conceditur  Jobī Skelton  Poetae Laureat quod possit stare eodem gradu hic quo stetit  Oxoniis  quod possit uti habitu sibi concesso à Principe"  See likewise Dr  Knight's  Life of  Colet  p And  Recherches  sur les  Poetes couronnez  par M l' Abbé  du Resnel  in the  Memoires de Litterature  Vol  Paris  to I  in his  Why come ye not to Court  gives us  after his rambling manner a curious character of  Wolsey  "By and by  He will drynke us so dry  And sucke us so nye  That men shall scantly  Haue penny or halpennye  God saue hys noble grace  And graunt him a place  Endlesse to dwel  With the deuill of hel  For and he were there  We nead neuer feare  Of the feendes blacke  For I undertake  He wold so brag and crake  That he wold than make  The deuils to quake  To shudder and to shake  Lyke a fier drake  And with a cole rake  Bruse them on a brake  And binde them to a stake  And set hel on fyre  At his owne desire  He is such a grym syre"  Edit  Mr  Upton  and some other Criticks have thought it very  scholarlike  in  Hamlet  to swear the Centinels on a  Sword  but this is for ever met with For instance in the  Passus primus  of  Pierce Plowman  "Dauid  in his daies dubbed knightes  And did hem  swere on her sword  to serue truth euer"  And in  Hieronymo  the common Butt of our Author and the Wits of the time says  Lorenzo  to  Pedringano  "Swear on this cross that what thou sayst is true  But if I prove thee perjured and unjust  This very  sword  whereon thou took'st thine oath  Shall be the worker of thy Tragedy"  We have therefore no occasion to go with Mr  Garrick  as far as the  French  of  Brantôme  to illustrate this  ceremony  Mr  Johnson's  Edit V p  a  Gentleman  who will be always allowed the  first Commentator  on  Shakespeare  when he does not carry us beyond  himself  Mr  Upton  however in the next place produces a passage from  Henry the sixth  whence he argues it to be very plain that our Author had not only  read Cicero's Offices  but even more  critically  than many of the Editors  "This Villain here  Being Captain of a  Pinnace  threatens more  Than  Bargulus  the strong  Illyrian  Pirate"  So the  Wight  he observes with great exultation is named by  Cicero  in the Editions of  Shakespeare's  time "  Bargulus Illyrius  latro" tho' the modern Editors have chosen to call him  Bardylis  "and  thus  I found it in  two  MSS" And  thus  he might have found it in  two  Translations before  Shakespeare  was born  Robert Whytinton  calls him  "Bargulus  a Pirate upon the see of  Illiry  " and  Nicholas Grimald  about twenty years afterward  "Bargulus  the  Illyrian  Robber"  I have met with a Writer who tells us that a Translation of the  Offices  was printed by  Caxton  in the year but such a book never existed It is a mistake for  "Tullius of olde age"  by  John Tiptoft  Earl of  Worcester  But it had been easy to have checked Mr  Upton's  exultation by observing that  Bargulus  does not appear in the  Quarto  Which also is the case with  some fragments of  Latin  verses in the different  Parts  of this  doubtful  performance  It is scarcely worth mentioning that two or three more  Latin  passages which are met with in our Author are immediately transcribed from the Story or Chronicle before him Thus in  Henry the fifth  whose right to the kingdom of  France  is copiously demonstrated by the  Archbishop  "There is no bar  To make against your Highness' claim to  France  But this which they produce from  Pharamond  In terram  Salicam  mulieres nè succedant  No Woman shall succeed in  Salike  land  Which  Salike  land the  French  unjustly gloze  To be the realm of  France  and  Pharamond  The founder of this law and female bar  Yet their own authors faithfully affirm  That the land  Salike  lies in  Germany  Between the floods of  Sala  and of  Elve  c"  Archbishop  Chichelie  says  Holingshed  "did much inueie against the surmised and false fained law  Salike  which the  Frenchmen  alledge euer against the kings of  England  in barre of their just title to the crowne of  France  The very words of that supposed law are these In terram  Salicam  mulieres nè succedant that is to saie Into the  Salike  land let not women succeed which the  French  glossers expound to be the realm of  France  and that this law was made by King  Pharamond  whereas yet their owne authors affirme that the land  Salike  is in  Germanie  between the rivers of  Elbe  and  Sala  c" p  It hath lately been repeated from Mr  Guthrie's  "Essay upon  English  Tragedy" that the  Portrait  of  Macbeth's Wife  is copied from  Buchanan  "whose spirit as well as words is translated into the Play of  Shakespeare  and it had signified nothing to have pored only on  Holingshed  for  Facts"  "Animus etiam per se ferox prope quotidianis conviciis uxoris quae omnium consiliorum ei erat conscia stimulabatur" This is the whole that  Buchanan  says of the  Lady  and truly I see no more  spirit  in the  Scotch  than in the  English  Chronicler "The wordes of the three weird Sisters also greatly encouraged him to the Murder of  Duncan  but specially his wife lay sore upon him to attempt the thing as she that was very ambitious brenning in unquenchable desire to beare the name of a Queene" Edit p  This part of  Holingshed  is an Abridgment of  Johne Bellenden's  translation of the  noble clerk Hector Boece imprinted  at  Edingburgh  in  Fol  I will give the passage as it is found there "His wyfe impacient of lang tary  as all wemen ar  specially quhare they ar desirus of ony purpos gaif hym gret artation to pursew the thrid weird that sche micht be ane  quene calland hym oft tymis febyl cowart and nocht desyrus of honouris sen he durst not assailze the thing with manheid and curage quhilk is offerit to hym be beniuolence of fortoun Howbeit sindry otheris hes assailzeit sic thinges afore with maist terribyl jeopardyis quhen thay had not sic sickernes to succeid in the end of thair laubouris as he had" p  But we can  demonstrate  that  Shakespeare  had not the Story from  Buchanan  According to  him  the WeïrdSisters salute  Macbeth  "Una  Angusiae  Thanum altera  Moraviae  tertia  Regem"  Thane of  Angus  and of  Murray c  but according to  Holingshed  immediately from  Bellenden  as it stands in  Shakespeare  "The first of them spake and sayde All hayle  Makbeth  Thane of  Glammis  the second of them said Hayle  Makbeth  Thane of  Cawder  but the third sayde All hayle  Makbeth  that hereafter shall be  king of Scotland"  p  "  Witch  All hail  Macbeth  Hail to thee  Thane  of  Glamis    Witch  All hail  Macbeth  Hail to thee Thane of  Cawdor    Witch  All hail  Macbeth  that shalt be  King  hereafter"  Here too our Poet found the equivocal Predictions on which his Hero so fatally depended "He had learned of certain wysards how that he ought to  take heede of  Macduffe  and surely hereupon had he put  Macduffe  to death but a certaine witch whom he had in great trust had tolde that he should neuer be slain with  man borne of any woman  nor vanquished till the Wood of  Bernane  came to the Castell of  Dunsinane"  p And the Scene between  Malcolm  and  Macduff  in the fourth act is almost literally taken from the  Chronicle  Macheth  was certainly one of  Shakespeare's  latest Productions and it might possibly have been suggested to him by a little performance on the same subject at  Oxford  before King  James  I will transcribe my notice of it from  Wake's Rex Platonicus  "Fabulae ansam dedit antiqua de Regiâ prosapiâ historiola apud  ScotoBritannos  celebrata quae narrat tres olim Sibyllas occurrisse duobus  Scotiae  proceribus  Macbetho    Banchoni  illum praedixisse Regem futurum sed Regem nullum geniturum hunc Regem non futurum sed Reges geniturum multos Vaticinii veritatem rerum eventus comprobavit  Banchonis  enim è stirpe Potentissimus  Jacobus  oriundus" p  A stronger argument hath been brought from the Plot of  Hamlet  Dr  Grey  and Mr  Whalley  assure us that for  this Shakespeare must  have read  Saxo Grammaticus  in  Latin  for no translation hath been made into any modern Language But the truth is he did not take it from  Saxo  at all a Novel called the  Hystorie of Hamblet  was his original a fragment of which in  black Letter  I have been favoured with by a very curious and intelligent Gentleman to whom the lovers of  Shakespeare  will some time or other owe great obligations  It hath indeed been said that "IF  such an history exists  it is almost impossible that any poet unacquainted with the  Latin  language supposing his perceptive faculties to have been ever so acute could have caught the characteristical madness of  Hamlet  described by  Saxo Grammaticus  "Falsitatis enim  Hamlethus  alienus haberi cupidus ita astutiam veriloquio permiscebat ut nec dictis veracitas deesset nec acuminis modus verorum judicio proderetur" This is quoted as it had been before in Mr  Guthrie's  Essay on Tragedy with a  small  variation from the  Original  See Edit  Fol  p  so happily as it is delineated by  Shakespeare"  Very luckily our Fragment gives us a part of  Hamlet's  Speech to his  Mother  which sufficiently replies to this observation "It was not without cause and juste occasion that my gestures countenances and words seeme to proceed from a madman and that I desire to haue all men esteeme mee wholy depriued of sence and reasonable understanding bycause I am well assured that he that hath made no conscience to kill his owne brother accustomed to murthers and allured with desire of gouernement without  controll in his treasons will not spare to saue himselfe with the like crueltie in the blood and flesh of the loyns of his brother by him massacred and therefore it is better for me to fayne madnesse then to use my right sences as nature hath bestowed them upon me The bright shining clearnes therof I am forced to hide vnder this shadow of dissimulation as the sun doth hir beams vnder some great cloud when the wether in summer time ouercasteth the face of a mad man serueth to couer my gallant countenance and the gestures of a fool are fit for me to the end that guiding my self wisely therin I may preserue my life for the  Danes  and the memory of my late deceased father for that the desire of reuenging his death is so ingrauen in my heart that if I dye not shortly I hope to take such and so great vengeance that these Countryes shall for euer speake thereof Neuerthelesse I must stay the time meanes and occasion lest by making ouer great hast I be now the cause of of mine owne sodaine ruine and ouerthrow and by that meanes end before I beginne to effect my hearts desire hee that hath to doe with a wicked disloyall cruell and discourteous man must vse craft and politike inuentions such as a fine witte can best imagine not to discouer his interprise for seeing that by force I cannot effect my desire reason alloweth me by dissimulation subtiltie and secret practises to proceed therein"  But to put the matter out of all question my communicative Friend abovementioned Mr  Capell  for why should I not give myself the credit of his name hath been fortunate enough to procure from the Collection of the Duke of  Newcastle  a  complete  Copy of the  Hystorie of Hamblet  which proves to be a translation from the  French  of  Belleforest  and he tells me that "all the chief incidents of the Play and all the capital Characters are there in  embryo  after a rude and barbarous manner sentiments indeed there are none that  Shakespeare  could borrow nor any expression but  one  which is where  Hamlet  kills  Polonius  behind the arras in doing which he is made to cry out as in the Play  "a rat a rat"  So much for  Saxo Grammaticus  It is scarcely conceivable how industriously the puritanical Zeal of the last age exerted itself in destroying amongst better things the innocent amusements of the former Numberless  Tales  and  Poems  are alluded to in old Books which are now perhaps no where to be found Mr  Capell  informs me and he is in these matters the most able of all men to give information that our Author appears to have been beholden to some  Novels  which he hath yet only seen in  French  or  Italian  but he adds "to say they are not in some  English  dress prosaic or metrical and perhaps with circumstances nearer to his stories  is what I will not take upon me to do nor indeed is it what I believe but rather the contrary and that time and accident will bring some of them to light if not all"  W Painter  at the conclusion of the second  Tome  of his  Palace of Pleasure    advertises  the Reader "bicause sodaynly contrary to expectation this Volume is risen to greater heape of leaues I doe omit for this present time  sundry Novels  of mery devise reseruing the same to be joyned with the rest of an other part wherein shall succeede the remnant of  Bandello  specially sutch suffrable as the learned French man  François de Belleforrest  hath selected and the choysest done in the  Italian  Some also out of  Erizzo Ser Giouanni Florentine Parabosco Cynthio Straparole Sansouino  and the best liked out of the Queene of  Nauarre  and other Authors Take these in good part with those that haue and shall come forth"But I am not able to find that a  third Tome  was ever published and it is very probable that the Interest of his Booksellers and more especially the prevailing Mode of the time might lead him afterward to print his  sundry Novels  separately If this were the case it is no wonder that such  fugitive Pieces  are recovered with difficulty when the  two Tomes  which  Tom Rawlinson  would have called  justa Volumina  are almost annihilated Mr  Ames  who searched after books of this sort with the utmost avidity most certainly had not seen them when he published his  Typographical Antiquities  as appears from his blunders about them and possibly I myself might have remained in the fame predicament had I not been favoured with a Copy by my generous Friend Mr  Lort  Mr  Colman  in the Preface to his elegant Translation of  Terence  hath offered some arguments for the Learning of  Shakespeare  which have been retailed with much confidence since the appearance of Mr  Johnson's  Edition  "Besides the resemblance of particular passages scattered up and down in different plays it is well known that the  Comedy of Errors  is in great measure founded on the  Menaechmi  of  Plautus  but I do not recollect ever to have seen it observed that the disguise of the  Pedant  in the  Taming of the Shrew  and his assuming the name and character of  Vincentio  seem to be evidently taken from the disguise of the  Sycophanta  in the  Trinummus  of the said Author  This observation of Mr  Colman  is quoted by his very ingenious Colleague Mr  Thornton  in his Translation of this Play who further remarks in another part of it that a passage in  Romeo and Juliet  where  Shakespeare  speaks of the  contradiction  in the nature of  Love  is very much in the manner of his Author  "Amor mores hominum moros morosos efficit  Minus placet quod suadetur quod disuadetur placet  Quom inopia'st cupias quando ejus copia'st tum non velis c"  Which he translates with ease and elegance  "Love makes a man a fool  Hard to be pleas'd What you'd persuade him to  He likes not and embraces that from which  You would dissuade him What there is a lack of  That will he covet when 'tis in his power  He'll none on't"  Act    Scene    Let us now turn to the passage in  Shakespeare  "O brawling Love O loving hate  O heavy lightness serious vanity  Misshapen Chaos of wellseeming forms  Feather of lead bright smoke cold fire sick health  Stillwaking Sleep that is not what it is"  Shakespeare  I am sure in the opinion of Mr  Thornton  did not want a  Plautus  to teach him the workings of Nature nor are his  Parallelisms  produced with any such implication but I suppose a peculiarity appears here in the manner of expression which however was extremely the humour of the Age Every  Sonetteer  characterises  Love  by contrarieties  Watson  begins one of his  Canzonets  "Love is a sowre delight a sugred griefe  A living death an euerdying life c"  Turberville  makes  Reason  harangue against it in the same manner  "A fierie Frost a Flame that frozen is with Ise  A heavie Burden light to beare a Vertue fraught with Vice c"  Immediately from the  Romaunt of the Rose  "Loue it is an hatefull pees  A free acquitaunce without reles  An heavie burthen light to beare  A wicked wawe awaie to weare  And health full of maladie  And charitie full of envie  A laughter that is weping aie  Rest that trauaileth night and daie c"  This kind of  Antithesis  was very much the taste of the  Provençal  and  Italian  Poets perhaps it might be hinted by the Ode of  Sappho  preserved by  Longinus Petrarch  is full of it  "Pace non trovo non hó da far guerra  Et temo spero ardo son un ghiaccio  Et volo sopra'l cielo ghiaccio in terra  Et nulla stringo tuttol mondo abbraccio c"  Sonetto    Sir  Thomas Wyat  gives a translation of this Sonnet without any notice of the  Original  under the title of "Description of the contrarious passions in a Louer" Amongst the  Songes and Sonettes  by the Earle of  Surrey  and Others  and  there is a quotation from the  Eunuch  of  Terence  also so familiarly introduced into the Dialogue of the  Taming of the Shrew  that I think it puts the question of  Shakespeare's  having read the Roman Comick Poets in the  original  language out of all doubt  Redime te captum quam queas minimo"  With respect to  resemblances  I shall not trouble you any furtherThat the  Comedy of Errors  is founded on the  Menaechmi  it is notorious nor is it less so that a Translation of it by W W perhaps  William Warner  the Author of  Albions England  was extant in the time of  Shakespeare    It was published in to The Printer of  Langbaine  p hath accidently given the date which hath been copied implicitly by  Gildon Theobald Cooke  and several others  Warner  is now almost forgotten yet the old Criticks esteemed him one of "our chiefe heroical  Makers"Meres  informs us that he had "heard him termed of the best wits of both our Universities our  English Homer"  tho' Mr  Upton  and some other advocates for his learning have cautiously dropt the mention of it Besides this if indeed it were different in the  Gesta Grayorum  the Christmas Revels of the  Gray'sInn  Gentlemen "a  Comedy of Errors  like to  Plautus  his  Menechmus  was played by the Players" And the same hath been suspected to be the Subject of the  goodlie Comedie of Plautus  acted at  Greenwich  before the King and Queen in as we learn from  Hall  and  Holingshed Riccoboni  highly compliments the  English  on opening their stage so well but unfortunately  Cavendish  in his Life of  Wolsey  calls it an  excellent Interlude in Latine  About the same time it was exhibited in  German  at  Nuremburgh  by the celebrated  Hanssach  the  Shoemaker  "But a character in the  Taming of the Shrew  is borrowed from the  Trinummus  and no translation of  that  was extant"  Mr  Colman  indeed hath been better employ'd but if he had met with an old Comedy called  Supposes  translated from  Ariosto  by  George Gascoigne  His works were first collected under the singular title of "A hundreth sundrie Flowres bounde up in one small Poesie Gathered partly by translation in the fyne outlandish Gardins of  Euripides Ouid Petrarke Ariosto  and others and partly by inuention out of our owne fruitefull Orchardes in  Englande  yelding sundrie sweete sauours of Tragical Comical and Morall Discourses bothe pleasaunt and profitable to the well smellyng noses of learned Readers"  Black Letter  to no date  he certainly  would not have appealed to  Plautus  Thence  Shakespeare  borrowed this part of the Plot as well as some of the phraseology though  Theobald  pronounces it his own invention there likewise he found the quaint name of  Petruchio  My young Master and his Man exchange habits and characters and persuade a  Scenaese  as he is called to personate the  Father  exactly as in the  Taming of the Shrew  by the pretended danger of his coming from  Sienna  to  Ferrara  contrary to the order of the government  Still  Shakespeare  quotes a line from the  Eunuch  of  Terence  by memory too and what is more "purposely alters it in order to bring the sense within the compass of one line"This remark was previous to Mr  Johnsons  or indisputably it would not have been made at all "Our Author had this line from  Lilly  which I mention that it may not be brought as an argument of his learning"  But how cries an unprovoked Antagonist can you take upon you to say that he had it from  Lilly  and not from  Terence  W Kenrick's  Review of Dr  Johnson's  Edit of  Shakespeare  vo p  I will answer for Mr  Johnson  who is above answering for himself Because it is quoted as it appears in the  Grammarian  and not as it appears in the  Poet  And thus we have done with the  purposed  alteration  Udall  likewise in his  "Floures for Latin speaking  gathered oute of  Terence  " reduces the passage to a single line and subjoins a Translation  We have hitherto supposed  Shakespeare  the Author of the  Taming of the Shrew  but his property in it is extremely disputable I will give you my opinion and the reasons on which it is founded I suppose then the present Play not  originally  the work of  Shakespeare  but restored by him to the Stage with the whole  Induction  of the  Tinker  and some other occasional improvements especially in the Character of  Petruchio  It is very obvious that the  Induction  and the  Play  were either the works of different hands or written at a great interval of time the former is in our Author's  best  manner and the greater part of the  latter  in his  worst  or even below it Dr  Warburton  declares it to be  certainly  spurious and without doubt  supposing  it to have been written by  Shakespeare  it must have been one of his  earliest  productions yet it is not mentioned in the List of his Works by  Meres  in  I have met with a facetious piece of Sir  John Harrington  printed in and possibly there may be an earlier Edition called  The Metamorphosis of Ajax  where I suspect an allusion to the old Play "Read the  booke  of  Taming a Shrew  which hath made a number of us so perfect that  now  every one can rule a Shrew in our Countrey save he that hath hir" I am aware a  modern  Linguist may object that the word  Book  does not at present seem  dramatick  but it was once almost  technically  so  Gosson  in his Schoole of Abuse contayning a pleasaunt inuective against  Poets Pipers Players Jesters  and such like  Caterpillars  of a Commonwealth mentions "twoo prose  Bookes  plaied at the  Belsauage  " and  Hearne  tells us in a Note at the end of  William of Worcester  that he had seen a MS in the nature of a  Play  or  Interlude  intitled the  Booke  of Sir  Thomas Moore"  I know indeed there is extant a very old Poem in  black Letter  to which it might have been supposed Sir  John Harrington  alluded had he not spoken of the Discovery as a  new  one and recommended it as worthy the notice of his Countrymen I am persuaded the method in the old Bard will not be thought  either  At the end of the sixth Volume of  Leland's Itinerary  we are  favoured  by Mr  Hearne  with a  Macaronic  Poem on a Battle at  Oxford  between the Scholars and the Townsmen on a line of which  "Invadunt aulas  bycheson cum forth  geminantes"  our Commentator very wisely and gravely remarks  "Bycheson  id est  Son  of a  Byche  ut è Codice  Rawlinsoniano  edidi Eo nempe modo quo et olim  Whorson  dixerunt pro  Son of a Whore  Exempla habemus cum alibi tum in libello quodam lepido antiquo inter Codices  Seldenianos  in Bibl  Bodl  qui inscribitur  The Wife lapped in Morels Skyn or the Taming of a Shrew  Ubi pag sic legimus  "They wrestled togyther thus they two  So long that the clothes asunder went  And to the ground he threwe her tho  That cleane from the backe her smock he rent  In every hand a rod he gate  And layd upon her a right good pace  Asking of her what game was that  And she cried out  Horeson  alas alas"  Et pag  Come downe now in this seller so deepe  And Morels skin there shall you see  With many a rod that hath made me to weepe  When the blood ranne downe fast by my knee  The Mother this beheld and cryed out alas  And ran out of the seller as she had been wood  She came to the table where the company was  And sayd out  Horeson  I will see thy harte blood"  And in fact there is such an old  anonymous  Play in Mr  Pope's  List "A pleasant conceited History called  The Taming of a Shrew  sundry times acted by the Earl of  Pembroke  his Servants" Which seems to have been republished by the Remains of that Company in when  Shakespeare's  copy appeared at the  BlackFriars  or the  Globe  Nor let this seem derogatory from the character of our Poet There is no reason to believe that he wanted to claim the Play as his own it was not even printed 'till some  years after his death but he merely revived it on his Stage as a  Manager Ravenscroft  assures us that this was really the case with  Titus Andronicus  which it may be observed hath not  Shakespeare's  name on the Titlepage of the only Edition published in his lifetime Indeed from every internal mark I have not the least doubt but this  horrible  Piece was originally written by the Author of the  Lines  thrown into the mouth of the  Player  in  Hamlet  and of the  Tragedy of Locrine  which likewise from some assistance perhaps given to his Friend hath been unjustly and ignorantly charged upon  Shakespeare  But the  sheetanchor  holds fast  Shakespeare  himself hath left some Translations from  Ovid  The Epistles says One of  Paris  and  Helen  give a sufficient proof of his acquaintance with  that  poet and it may be concluded says Another that he was a competent judge of  other  Authors who wrote in the same language  This hath been the universal cry from Mr  Pope  himself to the Criticks of yesterday Possibly however the Gentlemen will hesitate a moment if we tell them that  Shakespeare  was  not  the Author of these Translations Let them turn to a forgotten book by  Thomas Heywood  called  Britaines Troy  printed by  W Jaggard  in  Fol  and they will find these identical Epistles "which being so  pertinent to our Historie says  Heywood I  thought necessarie to translate"How then came they ascribed to  Shakespeare  We will tell them that likewise The same voluminous Writer published an  Apology for Actors  to and in an Appendix directed to his new Printer  Nic Okes  he accuses his old One  Jaggard  of "taking the two Epistles of  Paris  to  Helen  and  Helen  to  Paris  and printing them in a less volume under the name of  Another  but  he  was much offended with Master  Jaggard  that altogether unknowne to him he had presumed to make so bold with his Name"  It may seem little matter of wonder that the name of  Shakespeare  should be borrowed for the benefit of the Bookseller and by the way as probably for a  Play  as a  Poem  but modern Criticks may be surprised perhaps at the complaint of  John Hall  that "certayne Chapters of the  Proverbes  translated by him into  English  metre had before been untruely  entituled  to be the doyngs of Mayster  Thomas Sternhold"  In the same work of  Heywood  are all the other Translations which have been printed in the modern Editions of the Poems of  Shakespeare  You now hope for land We have seen through little matters but what must be done with a whole bookIn was reprinted "A compendious or briefe examination of certayne ordinary complaints of diuers of our Countrymen in these our days which although they are in some parte unjust and friuolous yet are they all by way of Dialogue  throughly debated and discussed by  William Shakespeare  Gentleman" vo  This extraordinary piece was originally published in to and dedicated by the Author "To the most vertuous and learned Lady his most deare and soveraigne Princesse  Elizabeth  being inforced by her Majesties late and singular clemency in pardoning certayne his unduetifull misdemeanour" And by the modern Editors to the late King as "a Treatise composed by the most extensive and fertile Genius that ever any age or nation produced"  Here we join issue with the Writers of that excellent tho' very unequal work the  Biographia Britannica  I must however correct a remark in the  Life  of  Spenser  which is impotently levelled at the first Criticks of the age It is observed from the correspondence of  Spenser  and  Gabriel Harvey  that the Plan of the  Fairy Queen  was laid and part of it executed in  three  years before the  Gierusalemme Liberata  was printed "hence appears the impertinence of all the apologies for his choice of  Ariosto's  manner in preference to  Tasso's"  But the fact is not true with respect to  Tasso Manso  and  Niceron  inform us that his Poem was published though imperfectly in and I myself can assure the Biographer that I have met with at least  six  other Editions preceding his date for it's first publication I suspect that  Baillet  is accountable for this mistake who in the  Jugemens des Savans  Tom p mentions no Edition previous to the to  Venice    It is a question of long standing whether a part of the  Fairy Queen  hath been  lost  or whether the work was left  unfinished  which may effectually be answered by a single quotation  William Browne  published some Poems in  Fol  under the name of  Britannia's Pastorals  "esteemed  then  says  Wood  to be written in a sublime strain and for subject  amorous  and  very pleasing"  In one of which  Book    Song  he thus speaks of  Spenser  "He sung th' heroicke Knights of Faiery land  In lines so elegant of such command  That had the  Thracian  plaid but halfe so well  He had not left  Eurydice  in hell  But  e're he ended his melodious Song  An host of  Angels  flew the clouds among  And rapt this Swan from his attentive mates  To make him one of their associates  In heauens faire Quire where now he sings the praise  Of him that is the  First and Last of Dayes"  It appears that  Browne  was intimate with  Drayton Jonson  and  Selden  by their poems prefixed to his Book he had therefore good opportunities of being acquainted with the fact abovementioned Many of his Poems remain in MS We have in our Library at  Emmanuel  a Masque of his presented at the Inner Temple  Jan  The subject is the Story of  Ulysses and Circe  if say they this piece could be written by  our Poet it would be absolutely decisive in the dispute about his learning for many quotations appear in it from the  Greek  and  Latin  Classicks  The concurring circumstances of the  Name  and the  Misdemeanor  which is supposed to be the old Story of  Deerstealing  seem fairly to challenge our Poet for the Author but they hesitate His claim may appear to be confuted by the date when  Shakespeare  was only  Seventeen  and the  long  experience  which the Writer talks of But I will not keep you in suspense the book was  not  written by  Shakespeare  Strype  in his  Annals  calls the Author SOME  learned Man  and this gave me the first suspicion I knew very well that honest  John  to use the language of Sir  Thomas Bodley  did not waste his time with such  baggage books  as  Plays  and  Poems  yet I must suppose that he had  heard  of the name of  Shakespeare  After a while I met with the original Edition Here in the Titlepage and at the end of the Dedication appear only the Initials W S Gent and presently I was informed by  Anthony Wood  that the book in question was written not by  William Shakespeare  but by  William Stafford  Gentleman  Fasti  d Edit V It will be seen on turning to the former Edition that the latter part of the Paragraph belongs to another  Stafford  I have since observed that  Wood  is not the first who hath given us the true Author of the Pamphlet  which at once accounted for the  Misdemeanour  in the Dedication For  Stafford  had been concerned at that time and was indeed afterward as  Camden  and the other Annalists inform us with some of the conspirators against  Elizabeth  which he properly calls his  unduetifull  behaviour  I hope by this time that any One open to conviction may be nearly satisfied and I will promise to give you on this head very little more trouble  The justly celebrated Mr  Warton  hath favoured us in his  Life of  Dr  Bathurst  with some  hearsay  particulars concerning  Shakespeare  from the papers of  Aubrey  which had been in the hands of  Wood  and I ought not to suppress them as the  last  seems to make against my doctrine They came originally I find on consulting the MS from one Mr  Beeston  and I am sure Mr  Warton  whom I have the honour to call my Friend and an Associate in the question will be in no pain about their credit  "William Shakespeare's  Father was a Butcher while he was a Boy be exercised his Father's trade but when he killed a Calf he would do it in a high stile and make a speech This  William  being inclined  naturally  to Poetry and Acting came to  London  I guess about  eighteen  and was an Actor in one of the Playhouses and did act  exceedingly well  He began  early  to make Essays in dramatique Poetry The humour of the  Constable  in the  Midsummer Night's Dream  he happen'd to take at  Crendon  It was observed in the former Edition that this place is not met with in  Spelman's Villare  or in  Adam's Index  nor it might have been added in the  first  and the  last  performance of this sort  Speed's Tables  and  Whatley's Gazetteer  perhaps however it may be meant under the name of  Crandon  but the inquiry is of no importance It should I think be written  Credendon  tho' better Antiquaries than  Aubrey  have acquiesced in the vulgar corruption  in  Bucks  I  think I have been told that he left near three hundred pounds to a  Sister He understood Latin pretty well  FOR  he had been in his younger yeares a Schoolmaster in the Country"  I will be short in my animadversions and take them in their order  The account of the  Trade  of the Family is not only contrary to all other Tradition but as it may seem to the instrument from the Herald's office so frequently reprinted  Shakespeare  most certainly went to  London  and commenced Actor thro' necessity not natural inclination Nor have we any reason to suppose that he did act  exceedingly well Rowe  tells us from the information of  Betterton  who was inquisitive into this point and had very early opportunities of Inquiry from Sir  W Davenant  that he was no  extraordinary Actor  and that the top of his performance was the Ghost in his own  Hamlet  Yet this  Chef d' Oeuvre  did not please I will give you an original stroke at it Dr  Lodge  who was for ever pestering the town with Pamphlets published in the year  Wits miserie and the Worlds madnesse discovering the Devils incarnat of this Age  to One of these Devils is  Hatevirtue  or  Sorrow for another mans good successe  who says the Doctor is  "a foule lubber  and looks as pale as the Visard  of the  Ghost  which cried so miserably at the Theatre like an Oisterwife  Hamlet revenge"  Thus you see Mr  Holt's  supposed  proof  in the Appendix to the late Edition that  Hamlet  was written after or perhaps will by no means hold good whatever might be the case of the particular passage on which it is founded  Nor does it appear that  Shakespeare  did begin  early  to make  Essays in Dramatique Poetry  the  Arraignment of Paris  which hath so often been ascribed to him on the credit of  Kirkman  and  Winstanley  These people who were the  Curls  of the last age ascribe likewise to our Author those miserable Performances  Mucidorus  and the  Merry Devil of Edmonton  was written by  George Peele  and  Shakespeare  is not met with even as an  Assistant  'till at least seven years afterward  Mr  Pope  asserts "The troublesome Raigne of King  John"  in parts to have been written by  Shakespeare  and  Rowley  which Edition is a mere Copy of another in  black Letter  But I find his assertion is somewhat to be doubted for the old Edition hath no name of  Author  at all and that of the Initials only  W Sh  in the Titlepage    Nash  in his Epistle to the Gentlemen Students of both Universities prefixed to  Greene's Arcadia  to  black Letter  recommends his Friend  Peele  "as the chiefe supporter of pleasance now living the  Atlas  of Poetrie and  primus Verborum artifex  whose first increase the  Arraignment of Paris  might plead to their  opinions his pregnant dexteritie of wit and manifold varietie of inuention"  Peele  seems to have been taken into the patronage of the Earl of  Northumberland  about to whom he dedicates in that year  "The Honour ofthe Garter  a Poem Gratulatorie the  Firstling  consecrated to his noble name" "He was esteemed says  Anthony Wood  a most noted Poet but when or where he died I cannot tell for  so it is  and always  hath been  that most POETS die  poor  and consequently obscurely and a hard matter it is to trace them to their Graves  Claruit  "  Ath Oxon  Vol p  We had lately in a periodical Pamphlet called  The Theatrical Review  a very  curious  Letter under the name of  George Peele  to one Master  Henrie Mark  relative to a dispute between  Shakespeare  and  Alleyn  which was compromised by  Ben Jonson  "I never longed for thy companye more than last night we were all verie merrie at the  Globe  when  Ned Alleyn  did not scruple to affyrme pleasauntly to thy friende  Will  that he had stolen hys speeche about the excellencie of acting in  Hamlet  hys Tragedye from conversaytions manifold whych had passed between them and opinions gyven by  Alleyn  touchyng that subjecte  Shakespeare  did not take this talk in good sorte but  Jonson  did put an end to the stryfe wyth wittielie saying thys affaire needeth no contentione you stole it from  Ned  no doubte do not marvel haue you not seene hym acte tymes out of number This is pretended to be printed from the original MS dated which agrees well enough with  Wood's Claruit  but unluckily  Peele  was dead at least two years before "As  Anacreon  died by the  Pot  says  Meres  so  George Peele  by the  Pox" Wit's Treasury  p  In the next place unfortunately there is neither such a Character as a  Constable  in the  Midsummer  Night's Dream  nor was the  three hundred pounds  Legacy to a Sister but a Daughter  And to close the whole it is not possible according to  Aubrey  himself that  Shakespeare  could have been some  years a Schoolmaster in the Country  on which circumstance only the supposition of his learning is professedly founded He was not surely  very  young when he was employed to  kill Calves  and he commenced Player about  Eighteen  The truth is that he left his Father for a Wife a year sooner and had at least two Children born at  Stratford  before he retired from thence to  London  It is therefore sufficiently clear that poor  Anthony  had too much reason for his character of  Aubrey  You will find it in his own Account of his Life published by  Hearne  which I would earnestly recommend to any Hypochondriack  "A pretender to Antiquities roving magotieheaded and sometimes little better than crased and being exceedingly credulous would stuff his many Letters sent to A W with  folliries  and misinformations" p  Thus much for the Learning of  Shakespeare  with respect to the ancient languages indulge me with an observation or two on his supposed knowledge of the modern ones and I will promise to release you  "It is  evident  we have been told that he was not unacquainted with the  Italian"  but let us inquire into the  Evidence  Certainly some  Italian  words and phrases appear in the Works of  Shakespeare  yet if we had nothing else to observe their Orthography might lead us to suspect them to be not of the  Writer's  importation But we can go further and prove this  When  Pistol  "chears up himself with ends of verse" he is only a copy of  Hanniball Gonsaga  who ranted on yielding himself a Prisoner to an  English  Captain in the  Low Countries  as you may read in an old Collection of Tales called  Wits Fits and Fancies  By one  Anthony Copley  to  black Letter  it seems to have had many Editions perhaps the last was in The first piece of this sort that I have met with was printed by  T Berthelet  tho' not mention'd by  Ames  called "Tales and quicke answeres very mery and pleasant to rede" to no date  "Si Fortuna me tormenta  Il speranza me contenta"  And Sir  Richard Hawkins  in his Voyage to the SouthSea throws out the same jingling Distich on the loss of his Pinnace  "Master  Page  sit good Master  Page  sit  Proface  What you want in meat we'll have in drink" says Justice  Shallow's Fac totum Davy  in the d Part of  Henry  the th  Proface  Sir  Thomas Hanmer  observes to be  Italian  from  profaccia much good may it do you  Mr  Johnson  rather thinks it a mistake for  perforce  Sir  Thomas  however is right yet it is no argument for his Author's  Italian  knowledge  Old  Heywood  the Epigrammatist addressed his Readers long before  "Readers reade this thus for Preface  Proface  Much good do it you the poore repast here c"  Woorkes  Lond to  And  Dekker  in his Play  If it be not good the Diuel is in it  which is certainly true for it is full of Devils makes  Shacklesoule  in the character of  Friar Rush  tempt his Brethren with "choice of dishes"  "To which  proface  with blythe lookes sit yee"  Nor hath it escaped the quibbling manner of the  Waterpoet  in the title of a Poem prefixed to his  Praise of Hempseed  "A Preamble Preatrot Preagallop Preapace or Preface and  Proface  my Masters if your Stomacks serve"  But the Editors are not contented without coining  Italian "Rivo says the Drunkard"  is an Expression of the  madcap  prince of  Wales  which Sir  Thomas Hanmer  corrects to  Ribi Drink away  or  again  as it should rather be translated Dr  Warburton  accedes to this and Mr  Johnson  hath admitted it into his Text but with an observation that  Rivo  might possibly be the cant of  English  Taverns And so indeed it was it occurs frequently in  Marston  Take a quotation from his Comedy of  What you will    "Musicke Tobacco Sacke and Sleepe  The Tide of Sorrow backward keep  If thou art sad at others fate  Rivo  drink deep give care the mate"  In  Love's Labour lost Boyet  calls Don  Armado  "A Spaniard that keeps here in Court  A Phantasme a  Monarcho"    Here too Sir  Thomas  is willing to palm  Italian  upon us We should read it seems  Mammuccio  a Mammet or Puppet Ital  Mammuccia  But the allusion is to a fantastical  Character  of the time "Popular applause says  Meres  dooth nourish some neither do they gape after any other thing but vaine praise and glorie as in our age  Peter Shakerlye  of  Paules  and MONARCHO that liued about the Court" p  I fancy you will be satisfied with one more instance  "Baccare  You are marvellous forward quoth  Gremio  to  Petruchio  in the  Taming of the Shrew  "But not so  forward  says Mr  Theobald  as our Editors are  indolent  This is a stupid corruption of the press that none of them have dived into We must read  Baccalare  as Mr  Warburton  acutely observed to me by which the  Italians  mean Thou ignorant presumptuous Man" "Properly indeed adds Mr  Heath  a  graduated  Scholar but ironically and sarcastically a  pretender  to Scholarship"  This is admitted by the Editors and Criticks of  every Denomination Yet the word is neither wrong nor  Italian  it was an old proverbial one used frequently by  John Heywood  who hath made what he pleases to call  Epigrams  upon it  Take two of them such as they are  "Backare  quoth  Mortimer  to his Sow  "Went that Sow  backe  at that biddyng trowe you"  "Backare  quoth  Mortimer  to his sow se  Mortimers  sow speakth as good  latin  as he"  Howel  takes this from  Heywood  in his  Old Sawes and Adages  and  Philpot  introduces it into the Proverbs collected by  Camden  We have but few observations concerning  Shakespeare's  knowledge of the  Spanish  tongue Dr  Grey  indeed is willing to suppose that the Plot of  Romeo and Juliet  may be borrowed from a COMEDY of  Lopes de Vega  But the  Spaniard  who was certainly acquainted with  Bandello  hath not only changed the Catastrophe but the names of the Characters Neither  Romeo  nor  Juliet  neither  Montague  nor  Capulet  appears in this performance and how came they to the knowledge of  Shakespeare  Nothing is more certain than that he chiefly followed the Translation by  Painter  from the  French  of  Boisteau  and hence arise the Deviations from  Bandello's  original  Italian  It is remarked that  "Paris  tho' in one place called  Earl  is most commonly stiled the  Countie  in this Play  Shakespeare  seems to have preferred for some reason or other the  Italian Conte  to our  Count  perhaps he took it from the old  English  Novel from which he is said to have taken his Plot" He certainly did so  Paris  is there first stiled  a young Earle  and afterward  Counte Countee  and  County  according to the unsettled Orthography of the time  The word however is frequently met with in other Writers particularly in  Fairfax  "As when a Captaine doth besiege some hold  Set in a marish or high on a hill  And trieth waies and wiles a thousand fold  To bring the piece subjected to his will  So far'd the  Countie  with the Pagan bold c"  Godfrey of Bulloigne  Book St  "Fairfax  says Mr  Hume  hath translated  Tasso  with an elegance and ease and at the same time with an exactness which for that age are surprising Each line in the original is faithfully rendered by a correspondent line in the translation" The former part of this character is extremely true but the latter not quite so In the  Book  abovequoted  Tasso  and  Fairfax  do not even agree in the Number of  Stanza's  It seems however from a passage in  Ames's  Typographical Antiquities that  Painter  was not the only Translator of this popular Story and it is possible therefore that  Shakespeare  might have other assistance  In the Induction to the  Taming of the Shrew  the Tinker attempts to talk  Spanish  and  consequently  the Author himself was acquainted with it  "Paucus pallabris  let the World slide  Sessa"  But this is a burlesque on  Hieronymo  the piece of Bombast that I have mentioned to you before  "What new device have they devised trow  Pocas pallabras  c  Mr  Whalley  tells us "the Author of this piece hath the happiness to be at this time unknown the remembrance of him having perished with himself"  Philips  and others ascribe it to one  William Smith  but I take this opportunity of informing him that it was written by  Thomas Kyd  if he will accept the authority of his Contemporary  Heywood  More hath been said concerning  Shakespeare's  acquaintance with the  French  language In the Play of  Henry the fifth  we have a whole Scene in it and in other places it occurs familiarly in the Dialogue  We may observe in general that the early Editions have not half the quantity and every sentence or rather every word most ridiculously blundered These for several reasons could not possibly be published by the Author  Every writer on  Shakespeare  hath expressed his astonishment that his author was not solicitous to secure his Fame by a correct Edition of his performances This matter is not understood When a Poet was connected with a particular Playhouse he constantly sold his Works to the  Company  and it was their interest to keep them from a number of Rivals A favourite Piece as  Heywood  informs us only got into print when it was copied  by the ear  "for a double sale would bring on a supicion of honestie"  Shakespeare  therefore himself published nothing in the  Drama  when he left the Stage his copies remained with his FellowManagers  Heminge  and  Condell  who at their own retirement about seven years after the death of the Author gave the world the Edition now known by the name of the  first Folio  and call the previous publications "stolne and surreptitious maimed and deformed by the frauds and stealths of injurious impostors" But  this  was printed from the Playhouse Copies which in a series of years had been frequently altered thro' convenience caprice or ignorance We have a sufficient instance of the liberties taken by the Actors in an old pamphlet by  Nash  called  Lenten Stuffe with the Prayse of the red Herring  to where he assures us that in a Play of his called the  Isle of Dogs "foure acts  without his consent or the least guesse of his drift or scope were supplied by the Players"  This however was not his first quarrel with them In the Epistle prefixed to  Greene's Arcadia  which I have quoted before  Tom  hath a lash at some "vaine glorious Tragedians" and very plainly at  Shakespeare  in particular which will serve for an answer to an observation of Mr  Pope  that had almost been forgotten "It was thought a praise to  Shakespeare  that he scarce ever blotted a line I believe the common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better ground This too might be thought a  praise  by some" But hear  Nash  who was far from  praising  "I leaue all these to the mercy of their  Mothertongue  that feed on nought but the crums that fall from the  Translator's  trencher That could scarcely  Latinize  their neck verse if they should haue neede yet  English Seneca  read by Candlelight yeelds many good sentences hee will affoord you whole  Hamlets  I should say  Handfuls  of tragicall speeches" I cannot determine exactly when this  Epistle  was first published but I fancy it will carry the original  Hamlet  somewhat further back than we have hitherto done and it may be observed that the oldest Copy now extant is said to be "Enlarged to almost as much againe as it was"  Gabriel Harvey  printed at the end of the year "Foure Letters and certaine Sonnetts especially touching  Robert Greene"  in one of which his  Arcadia  is mentioned Now  Nash's  Epistle must have been previous to these as  Gabriel  is quoted in it with applause and the  Foure Letters  were the beginning of a quarrel  Nash  replied in "Strange newes of the intercepting certaine Letters and a Convoy of Verses as they were going  privilie  to victuall the  Low Countries  "  Harvey  rejoined the same year in  "Pierce's  Supererogation or a new praise of the old Asse" And  Nash  again in "Have with you to  Saffronwalden  or  Gabriell Harvey's  hunt is up containing a full answer to the eldest Sonne of the haltermaker "  Dr  Lodge  calls  Nash  our  true English Aretine  and  John Taylor  in his  Kicksey Winsey or a Lerry Cometwang  even makes an oath "by sweet Satyricke  Nash  his urne" He died before as appears from an old Comedy called "The return from  Parnassus"  and it is extremely probable  that the  French  ribaldry was at first inserted by a different hand as the many additions most certainly were after he had left the Stage Indeed every  friend to his memory will not easily believe that he was acquainted with the Scene between  Catharine  and the  old Gentlewoman  or surely he would not have admitted such obscenity and nonsense  Mr  Hawkins  in the Appendix to Mr  Johnson's  Edition hath an ingenious observation to prove that  Shakespeare  supposing the  French  to be his had very little knowledge of the language  "Estil impossible d'eschapper la force de ton  Bras"  says a  Frenchman    "Brass  cur" replies  Pistol  "Almost any one knows that the French word  Bras  is pronounced  Brau  and what resemblance of sound does this bear to  Brass"    Mr  Johnson  makes a doubt whether the pronunciation of the French language may not be changed since  Shakespeare's  time "if not says he it may be suspected that some other man wrote the  French  scenes" but this does not appear to be the case at least in this termination from the rules of the Grammarians or the practice of the Poets I am certain of the former from the  French Alphabeth  of  De la Mothe  Lond  vo  and the  Orthoepia Gallica  of  John Eliot    Lond  to  Eliot  is almost the only  witty  Grammarian that I have had the fortune to meet with In his Epistle prefatory to the  Gentle Doctors of Gaule  he cries out for persecution very like  Jack  in that most poignant of Satires the  Tale of a Tub  "I pray you be readie quickly to cauill at my booke I beseech you heartily calumniate my doings with speede I request you humbly controll my method as soone as you may I earnestly entreat you hisse at my inventions c"  and of the latter from the Rhymes of  Marot Ronsard  and  Du Bartas  Connections of this kind were very common  Shakespeare  himself assisted  Ben Jonson  in his  Sejanus  as it was originally written and  Fletcher  in his  Two noble Kinsmen  But what if the  French  scene were occasionally introduced into every Play on this Subject and perhaps  there were more than one before our Poet's In  Pierce Penilesse his Supplication to the Diuell  to which it seems from the Epistle to the Printer was not the first Edition the Author  Nash  exclaims "What a glorious thing it is to have  Henry the fifth  represented on the Stage leading the  French King  prisoner and forcing both him and the  Dolphin  to sweare fealty" And it appears from the Jests of the famous Comedian  Tarlton  to that he had been particularly celebrated in the Part of the  Clown  in  Henry the fifth  but no such Character exists in the Play of  Shakespeare Henry the sixth  hath ever been doubted and a passage in the abovequoted piece of  Nash  may give us reason to believe it was previous to our Author "How would it haue joyed braue  Talbot  the terror of the  French  to thinke that after he had lyen two hundred yeare in his Toomb he should triumph again on the Stage and haue his bones new embalmed with the teares of ten thousand spectators at least at seuerall times who in the Tragedian that represents his person imagine they behold him fresh bleeding"I have no doubt but  Henry the sixth  had the same Author with  Edward the third  which hath been recovered to the world in Mr  Capell's Prolusions  It hath been observed that the  Giant  of  Rabelais  is sometimes alluded to by  Shakespeare  and in  his  time no translation was extant But the Story was in every one's hand  In a Letter by one  Laneham  or  Langham  for the name is written differently  It is indeed of no importance but I suspect the former to be right as I find it corrupted afterward to  Lanam  and  Lanum  concerning the Entertainment at  Killingwoorth Castle  printed we have a list of the vulgar Romances of the age "King  Arthurz  book  Huon  of  Burdeaus  Friar  Rous Howleglass  and GARGANTUA  Meres  This Author by a pleasant mistake in some sensible  Conjectures on Shakespeare  lately printed at  Oxford  is quoted by the name of  Maister  Perhaps the Titlepage was imperfect it runs thus "Palladis Tamia Wits Treasury Being the second part of Wits Commonwealth By  Francis Meres Maister  of Artes of both Universities"  I am glad out of gratitude to this man who hath been of frequent service to me that I am enabled to perfect  Wood's  account of him from the assistance of our  Master  's very accurate List of Graduates which it would do honour to the University to print at the publick expense and the kind information of a Friend from the Register of his Parish He was originally of  PembrokeHall  B A in and M A About he became Rector of  Wing  in  Rutland  and died there in the st year of his Age  mentions him as equally hurtful to young minds with the  Four Sons  of  Aymon  and the  Seven Champions  And  John Taylor  hath him likewise in his catalogue of  Authors  prefixed to Sir  Gregory Nonsence  I have quoted many pieces of  John Taylor  but it was impossible to give their original dates He may be traced as an Author for more than half a Century His  Works  were collected in  Folio  but many were printed afterward I will mention one for the Humour of the Title "Drinke and welcome or the famous History of the most part of Drinkes in use in  Greate Britain  and  Ireland  with an especial Declaration of the Potency Vertue and Operation of our  English  Ale with a description of all sorts of  Waters  from the  Ocean Sea  to the  Tears of a Woman  to " In  Wits Merriment or Lusty Drollery  we have an "Epitaph on  John Taylor  who was born in the City of  Glocester  and died in  Phoenix Alley  in the yeare of his age you may find him if the worms have not devoured him in  Covent Garden  Churchyard" p He died about two years before  But to come to a conclusion I will give you an irrefragable argument that  Shakespeare  did  not  understand  two  very common words in the  French  and  Latin  languages  According to the Articles of agreement between the Conqueror  Henry  and the King of  France  the latter was to stile the former in the corrected  French  of the modern Editions "Nostre  tres cher  filz  Henry  Roy d'  Angleterre  and in  Latin Praeclarissimus  Filius c" What says Dr  Warburton  is  tres cher  in  French praeclarissimus  in  Latin  we should read  praecarissimus  This appears to be exceedingly true but how came the blunder it is a typographical one  in  Holingshed  which  Shakespeare  copied but must indisputably have corrected had he been acquainted with the languages "Our said Father during his life shall name call and write us in  French  in this maner Nostre  tres chier  filz  Henry  Roy d'  Engleterre  and in  Latine  in this maner  Praeclarissimus  filius noster" Edit p  To corroborate this instance let me observe to you though it be nothing further to the purpose that another error of the same kind hath been the source of a mistake in an historical passage of our Author which hath ridiculously troubled the Criticks  Richard the third  Some inquiry hath been made for the first Performers of the capital Characters in  Shakespeare  We learn that  Burbage  the  alter Roscius  of  Camden  was the original  Richard  from a passage in the Poems of Bishop  Corbet  who introduces his Host at  Bosworth  describing the Battle  "But when he would have said King  Richard  died  And call'd  a Horse a Horse  he  Burbage  cried"  The Play on this subject mentioned by Sir  John Harrington  in his  Apologie for Poetrie  and sometimes mistaken for  Shakespeare's  was a  Latin  one written by Dr  Legge  and acted at  St John's  in our University some years before the date of the Copy in the  Museum  This appears from a better MS in our Library at  Emmanuel  with the names of the original Performers  It is evident from a passage in  Camden's Annals  that there was an old Play likewise on the subject of  Richard the second  but I know not in what language Sir  Gelley Merrick  who was concerned in the harebrained business of the Earl of  Essex  and was hanged for it with the ingenious  Cuffe  in is accused amongst other things "quod  exoletam  Tragoediam de tragicâ abdicatione Regis  Ricardi secundi  in publico Theatro coram Conjuratis datâ pecuniâ agi curasset"  harangues his army before the Battle of  Bosworth  "Remember whom ye are to cope withal  A sort of vagabonds of rascals runaways  And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow  Long kept in  Britaine  at  our Mother's  cost  A milksop c"  "Our  Mother" Mr  Theobald  perceives to be wrong and  Henry  was somewhere secreted on the  Continent  he reads therefore and all the Editors after him  "Long kept in  Bretague  at  his  mother's cost"  But give me leave to transcribe a few more lines from  Holingshed  and you will find at once that  Shakespeare  had been there before me "Ye see further how a companie of traitors theeves outlaws and runnagates be aiders and partakers of his feat and enterprise And to begin with the erle of Richmond captaine of this rebellion he is a Welsh milksop brought up by  my Moother's  meanes and mine like a captive in a close cage in the court of  Francis  duke of  Britaine"  p  Holingshed  copies this  verbatim  from his Brother Chronicler  Hall  Edit  fol  but his Printer  hath given us by accident the word  Moother  instead of  Brother  as it is in the Original and ought to be in  Shakespeare  I cannot take my leave of  Holingshed  without clearing up a difficulty which hath puzzled his Biographers  Nicholson  and other Writers have  supposed  him a  Clergyman Tanner  goes further and tells us that he was educated at  Cambridge  and actually took the Degree of M A in Yet it appears by his Will printed by  Hearne  that at the end of life he was only a  Steward  or a  Servant  in some capacity or other to  Thomas Burdett  Esq  of  Bromcote  in  Warwickshire  These things Dr  Campbell  could not reconcile The truth is we have no claim to the education of the  Chronicler  the M A in was not  Raphael  but one  Ottiwell Holingshed  who was afterward named by the Founder one of the first Fellows of  Trinity College  I hope my good Friend you have by this time acquitted our great Poet of all piratical depredations on the Ancients and are ready to receive my  Conclusion  He remembered perhaps enough of his  schoolboy  learning to put the  Hig hag hog  into the mouth of Sir  Hugh Evans  and might pick up in the Writers of the time  Ascham  in the Epistle prefixed to his  Toxophilus  observes of them that "Manye  Englishe  writers usinge straunge wordes as  Lattine Frenche  and  Italian  do make all thinges darke and harde Ones says he I communed with a man which reasoned the  Englishe  tongue to be enriched and encreased thereby sayinge Who will not prayse that feast where a man shall drincke at a dinner both wyne ale and beere Truly quoth I they be al good euery one taken by himselfe alone but if you put Malmesye and sacke redde wyne and white ale and beere and al in one pot you shall make a drinke neither easye to be knowen nor yet holsome for the bodye"  or the course of his conversation  a familiar phrase or two of  French  or  Italian  but his  Studies  were most demonstratively confined to  Nature  and  his own Language  In the course of this disquisition you have often smiled at "all such reading as was never read" and possibly I may have indulged it too far but it is the reading necessary for a Comment on  Shakespeare  Those who apply solely to the Ancients for this purpose may with equal wisdom study the TALMUD for an Exposition of TRISTRAM SHANDY Nothing but an intimate acquaintance with the Writers of the time who are frequently of no other value can point out his allusions and ascertain his Phraseology The Reformers of his Text are for ever equally positive and equally wrong The Cant of the Age a provincial Expression an obscure Proverb an obsolete Custom a Hint at a Person or a Fact no longer remembered hath continually defeated the best of our  Guessers  You must not suppose me to speak at random when I assure you that from some forgotten book or other I can demonstrate this to you in many hundred Places and I almost wish that I had not been persuaded into a different Employment  Tho' I have as much of the  Natale Solum  about me as any man whatsoever yet I own the  Primrose Path  is still more pleasing than the  Fosse  or the  Watling Street  "Age cannot wither it nor custom stale  It's infinite variety"  And when I am fairly rid of the Dust of topographical Antiquity which hath continued much longer about me than I expected you may very probably be troubled again with the ever fruitful Subject of SHAKESPEARE and his COMMENTATORS  FINIS
