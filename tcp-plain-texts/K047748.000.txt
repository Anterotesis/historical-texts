 AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT and GENEROUS ACTIONS OF  James Butler    Duke of  Ormond    Dedicated to the Famous UNIVERSITY of  OXFORD  LONDON  Printed for  J MOORE  near St  Paul  's and sold by the Booksellers  Price Sixpence  An Humble DEDICATION TO THE University of  Oxford  c  CLARISSIMI DOCTISSIMI  _THE Famous University of  Oxford  having been of all the Universities in  Europe  the most Ancient and for many Ages the most celebrated Fountain of Learning the Seat of the Muses the Honour of the Protestant World and the particular Glory of  Great Britain  The Author of these Sheets comes prepar'd to lay this Tract at her Feet with all the Decency and  Respect that the most affectionate Duty of an Admirer of Virtue and Literature can oblige him to  For this Reason and from the Sense of Justice to so Learned and Excellent a Society he grounds this Dedication upon an Assurance next to a Demonstration that nothing like what common Fame has slanderously loaded this famous Body with can be her Due that it is not possible without the most manifest Injustice to fix such things upon the University as are at this Time wickedly alledg'd by her enrag'd Enemies and that therefore it is every honest Man's Duty to assist in her Vindication  As nothing is more certain so nothing is more pleasing to those who honour and wish well to the University of  Oxford  than to hear that the said University has always been a constant Asserter of loyal Principles and a deep Sufferer for her steddy Adherence in Practice to those Principles always distinguishing herself by her Loyalty to her Sovereign in the worst of Times History is full of the Particulars there we read with Pleasure how she has frequently strip'd her self of her Ornaments  to supply the Necessities of her Princes and suffered several Sieges and various Distresses in Defence of the Monarchy in the Times of Rebellion and Usurpation  Her Churches and the several Chappels of her Colleges have constantly resounded with the learned Discourses of the Heads of Houses Fellows Graduates  c  in Defence of those ancient and orthodox Doctrines of Submission to our lawful Sovereigns being subject to the higher Powers for Conscience sake and of their Abhorrence of that damnable Position  That it is lawful upon any Pretence whatsoever to take up Arms against the King  Nor can it be pleaded against her without great Injustice as I hear it is now that this was the Usage in  Oxford  several Years ago but that she has intermitted the same and profest other Principles since on the contrary it is affirm'd that she never deviated from the  Profession  of a due absolute Subjection to her Kings and we cannot believe that she can have forgot to practise conformable to the said Profession and therefore it seems the more reasonable to expose at this Time  the Attempts which some People make to lay Reproach and Scandal upon her as if she or any of her Body had avowedly acted undutifully to our present Sovereign raised Tumults Mobbs and Rebellion Things so inconsistent with the Christian Rule so directly opposite to the Principles of the Protestant Religion and particularly of the Church of  England  to all which the University of  Oxford  has been and is still esteemed so great an Ornament that it cannot without great want of Charity be suggested that the said University has any Ways been concerned that way  Permit therefore Reverend and Learned that an humble Advocate for your injur'd Reputation should expostulate with your Enemies on the Injustice they offer you when they propagate such scandalous things as are daily suggested against you and against the Honour and Reputation of your University  AS IF you were now less loyal and less submissive to the higher Powers than formerly  AS IF you had forgotten your profest Principles of Obedience or could  dispence with the Conformity of your Practice to your Profession  AS IF the University was capable of being corrrupted with Faction or were less loyal and dutiful to King  George  than they were to Queen  Anne  AS IF it were possible the Contagion of  Jacobitism  which is Perjury could infect the University or that the Sons of the Prophets could thus commence Children of Disobedience  AS IF it were possible that the University of  Oxford  could be tainted with Rellellion  which is as the Sin of Witchcraft  These things I am satisfy'd can never be it cannot consist with common Charity to think much less to prompt others to think so absurdly of so glorious a Body of Men illuminated with the sublimest Knowledge divine and humane instructed by a Succession of Learned Pious and truly Reverend Divines and openly professing Principles diametrically opposite to what they are now charg'd with  And therefore  Excellent and Venerable  permit the Author in this Dedication briefly to enter into the Particulars  from whence these Suggestions are maliciously drawn and from thence how easy will it be to shew the Improbability there is that the University should be in the least concern'd in or guilty of the Facts laid to her Charge  As first  The black Charge of Riots and Tumults in the Streets of the University breaking the King's Peace and turning the usual Assembly of the learned Members of the University such as Students Graduates  c  into a Rabble a Rout a rebellious and tumultuous Mobb  Such is the good Government of the University in general such the rigorous Execution of their private and statutary Laws such the Honesty and Vigilance of the Reverend the  ViceChancellor  such the Fidelity and Diligence of the UnderOfficers of the University all concurring as well to restrain as to resent that it is well known how impracticable such a thing is that it cannot be that the Power of the said  ViceChancellor  is such in causing the Doors of the Colleges to be kept shut and a strict Account to be taken of all the Students both  of the Egress and Regress that it is not possible for any to be absent or if any are they may be publickly and severely call'd to an Account for the same Seeing then that on all the most strict Enquiries which have been made so few have been found out and punish'd for being absent from their Chambers at the Time of the said Riot it must certainly follow  undeniably follow  that if there was any such Riot and Tumult in the Streets of  Oxford  it must be made by and made up of the Rabbles and People of the Town the  Canaille  and the Crowds of the Villages adjacent and the like and that not one Scholar of the Town was among them for if there had it cannot be doubted but the  ViceChancellor  by his known Vigilance and Diligence and his irresistible Authority COULD have detected them and have  rusticated  or otherwise expos'd them all as they deserved  It is then farther alledg'd that the Persons of whom these riotous Assemblies were compos'd committed divers Sorts of Violences such as breaking Windows pulling down Bonefires  built up for publick Rejoicings on the Day of the King's Birth Accession or Coronation or on Days appointed for Thanksgiving for such things as those and after this to march in an arm'd and violent Manner and pull down and demolish the  MeetingHouse  or Place of religious Worship belonging to the  Dissenters  Alas how do Men give themselves a Liberty to fall upon and to asperse the most innocent and inoffensive of their Brethren Can it be rational to believe that a Body of Gentlemen many of them of Quality most of them of good Families and all of them of good Proficiency in Breeding and Manners entred into particular Societies for Learning for polishing their Understandings for adorning their Souls with Principles of Religion and Virtue with Rules for good Manners to qualify them for Gentlemen and for Instructors of others Is it possible I say that these can be guilty of the  StreetMadness  here talked of and can deviate into Mobbs and Rabbles It cannot be It is not rational to suggest it of them Again when we call to mind that the Students of the University are generally  made up of such as have set their Faces towards  Jerusalem  who have the Temple and the Altar in their View and are learning the divine Stile of the Pulpit that are to serve at the Altar and minister in holy Things is it reasonable to imagine that these can sink into Clamour and Tumult and dishonour their Dignity so far as to herd in with the Disturbers of the Civil Peace It can never be we cannot we must not believe it  It is well known that the most pure Doctrine of the Church of  England  preach'd upon all Occasions by her most Reverend Divines and practis'd in Times of the greatest Extremity by her most sincere Disciples is a sacred Pattern of Obedience to the Civil Magistrate as to the Power which is ordained of God and the breaking out into Riot and Tumult  which is Rebellion  is as inconsistent with the said Doctrine of the Church that the Church herself has in all Ages held such in Abomination who have thought fit to break into such unchristian Courses maintaining with her utmost Endeavour that blessed ScriptureRule lest upon Record by St  Paul    Let every  Soul be subject to the higher Powers  This then having been the avowed Principle of Obedience profess'd in and own'd by the Church of  England  we humbly appeal to you Excellent and Learned the Heads Fellows Graduates and Students of the famous University of  Oxford  whether we ought in Justice or Charity to believe that any Members of your Body especially of those who are preparing themselves for the Service of the holy Altar can be guilty of such scandalous Crimes as those of Rabble Tumult breaking the Peace  c  or that if they were those Offences would not meet with the utmost Resentment and severest Punishment from those whose Duty it is to take Cognizance thereof  It cannot but be grateful to the University of  Oxford  to remind the Reader of these Sheets that within those sacred Walls have for many Ages been professed preached and to the immortal Glory of the University been practis'd those most Christian and Heavenly Doctrines of  NonResistance  and  Passive Obedience  and that in their full and most extended Sense and Meaning and it would be  the absurdest thing in the World for us to suggest that the Professors of those sublime Principles can be guilty of any thing so diametrically opposite thereto as is the mobbing together against Law and against the Power of the Legal Magistrate which is indeed no less than against the King himself and therefore we can by no means think any other but that all the Reports we have had of these things are meer Forgeries and fictitious Stories contrived by the Enemies of our holy Mother the Church of  England  to brand her most obedient Sons with the most hateful of Crimes and which are most repugnant to her Establishment and profest Doctrine  Furthermore as the Charge descends to yet greater and greater Offences so much stronger are the Arguments against our entertaining any Suspicion of their being true Even as  Lycurgus  in his  Spartan  Constitution omitted Laws against certain Crimes as what he would not suppose it possible his Citizens could commit with what Face can the Enemies of your most Reverend Body pretend to make mention of the Extravagancies of the  common People in falling upon their Brethren and Neighbours meerly for their professing to serve God in some manner differing from the Establish'd Rites and with Violence and the rudest kind of Persecution pull down and demolish their Chappel or MeetingHouse notwithstanding the same are allow'd to them by the Law and are legally qualify'd that the poor ignorant deluded and abused People the  Plebeii  of the City and the adjacent Villages might in the Heat of an enrag'd Multitude and perhaps intoxicated by Liquor run upon things so extravagant and unchristian I will not dispute but to be sure not one Member of the  famous Ʋniversity of OXFORD  could be so weak so ignorant or so wicked as to be found in the Streets at that Time  It is impossible Heaven forbid so uncharitable a Thought should be harbour'd in any Man's Breast that calls himself a Christian Good God What Men of Religion to demolish Places of Worship Men breeding up for the Pulpit to make a Bonefire of Pulpits Men set apart to serve at the Altar to pull down Altars It is impossible  What the Sons of the Prophets thus become Sons of  Belial  It can never be Sure no Christian can believe it without Breach of the great Rule of Christian Charity and that in an unusual Manner when I say it is impossible to believe these things and it cannot be true and we can by no means entertain such thoughts it must be understood that it is impossible  c  without at the same Time branding the University with the blackest Mark of Infamy and believing her degenerated to all that is vile and contemptible believing the best constituted Foundations to be converted into a Rabble of Licentiousness and the most excellent CollegeGovernment to be deviated into the worst kind of Confusion supposing the Beauty and Comeliness of that most excellent Seminary of Learning to be defac'd all the Order and Oeconomy of the respective Houses inverted and overwhelm'd their Pretences to Religion shamefully abandoned their Claim to a wellorder'd Society given up their Discipline neglected and in a Word the whole University descended to a Crowd Government dissolv'd Subordination  which is the very Fabrick of Order blended with Superiority and both together sunk into the worst Disorder the Church of  England  turn'd Rebels Protestants turn'd Persecutors and the most famous Seminary of Religion turn'd a Nest of Phanaticks  Pardon me Excellent and Reverend that some Warmth most naturally attends such a Thought as this it is only by the liveliest Description of what these Crimes would produce to evince the Truth of what I have advanc'd in your Defence and to shew how reasonable it is that we should not in any kind give Credit to the scandalous Stories which your Enemies suggest against you  I come now to the most malicious of all the Reflections yet made and this is their fathering the Voice of the Rabble upon the University making the learned Students of your Colleges join in with the Shouts of the  Peasants  and  Boors  and fouling their Mouths with the course Jargon of the Street crying an  Ormond  an  Ormond  no  King George    HighChurch  c and the like  I should not care to repeat Words so ungrateful to loyal Ears were I not well satisfy'd that the Members of your Honourable Society were not capable of being so far demented not capable of uttering Words so inconsistent with common Sense as well as with common Manners and that I may the more effectually vindicate the  Ʋniversity  from the Suggestion I need do no more than to enquire into the Rationality of these Exclamations for if I prove the Words to have neither Consistency Honesty or Meaning I hope no Body will contend about the  Ʋniversity  's being in the least concern'd in them  It is to be observ'd first That in the very Connection of the Words a certain Opposition is plac'd between the Center and the two Extremes  Ormond    Ormond  no  King George  Take them the other Way  No King  George  HighChurch  So that in short King  George  is placed in direct Opposition to  Ormond  and in direct Opposition to  HighChurch  and which is still more extraordinary  Ormond  and  HighChurch  are both plac'd in Opposition to King  George  Now we all know that this is no University Language the Learned and Reverend Members of your several Colleges use quite another Dialect King  George  being legally enthron'd crown'd by the lawful Authority of the Kingdom is now become the Lord's Anointed as much and as effectually as any of his Predecessors and as such has been recogniz'd by the University and now to cry  No King GEORGE  is to make their Loyalty a meer  Witch  's Prayer ring their Bells backward and raise Rebellion against their only lawful Sovereign  Now it can never be thought that the University of  Oxford  can do thus unless we shall own she is turn'd  Phanatick  has embrac'd the  Presbyterian  Principles of and is actually engag'd in Rebellion to depose the Lord's Anointed and bring their lawful Sovereign to Destruction for we have always allow'd that to raise War against our Sovereign and to kill murther and destroy the Sovereign differ not at all in the Treason and have no other specifick Difference than there is between the Endeavour which is Treason in the overtAct  and the Perpetration which is Treason compleated  Sure it cannot be call'd a Compliment to the University to believe she cannot be guilty of any thing so unnatural as this so contrary to her avow'd Principles and steddy Practice for many Ages  As to the Name of  Ormond  which has been the Catchword of the Rabble in the several Streettumults which have of late so much disturb'd the Nation there is so much incongruous Nonsense in the Cry that it has help'd to make those Mobbs odious and hateful to the Country and has shewn the People that they have none to look to beyond the King upon the Throne for why do they cry an  Ormond  an  Ormond  they will not pretend that the Duke of  Ormond  makes any Claim to the Crown if then they have any one to talk of next to the King why do they not name him This they dare not do because that would be to own fairly what they mean  the Pretender  and this openly profest would open the Peoples Eyes too soon for did they openly and avowedly cry out  the Pretender    the  Pretender    no King GEORGE    no Hanover  I say would they cry thus their own Mobb would forsake them and therefore having nothing else to say they cry  Ormond    Ormond  whether with a Meaning or without a Meaning that they may have something to fill the Mouths of the People with for to have a Mobb and no  Halloo  would be a Mobb and no Mobb and would signify nothing for Rabbles are always rais'd by Murmur and kept alive by Shouts Noise is as essential to a Mobb as Ammunition is to an Army they could do nothing without  But certainly this can never be the University of  Oxford  We all know the Veneration the University has for  Ormond  and how entirely they are in his personal Interest and they cannot be ignorant of his late Grace's present Circumstances and the Mischief such Use made of his Name would be to him how it would suppose him either to be for the  Pretender  or to have the Vanity to accept of this Elevation of his Name by the Mobb in Opposition to the King and so to set up for a Pretender himself which would be equally ridiculous and in the End equally  fatal to him Nor can the University be ignorant how this would expose him to the superiour Power of his Enemies and put the Government to the Necessity of prosecuting him for those other Things in which they were before enclin'd to shew him Favour how it seems to set a Subject in Competition with his Sovereign and make it absolutely necessary to crush him for that dangerous Popularity which other Men put upon him whether it be with his Consent or no Now the University of  Oxford  who have so entire an Affection for the Person of their late  Chancellor  cannot without great Injustice be suppos'd so unconcern'd for his Safety and so little interested in him as to expose him to so just a Reproach as this would bring upon him  On the other Hand to do the late Duke a piece of Justice which he so much stands in need of at this Time I have been credibly inform'd that he received the Account of these things with a just Indignation that he disown'd it in every Part that he potested openly it was what he abhorr'd and was so far from approving that he  hop'd all his Friends would clear him of having any Concern in it and above all that he express'd himself particularly pleas'd and satisfy'd when it was told him that the University was not in the least to be suppos'd to be concern'd in it and that his Grace's Opinion was the same as ours is and as all others must be who are Friends to the University  viz  That the University could not be so distracted it was impossible  But to leave his Grace to protest against it thus mobbing his Name in the Streets and entituling him to a Crime worse than the greatest of those for which he already stands impeach'd I cannot but engage a little in Behalf of the University as to the other Cry  No Hanover    no King GEORGE    HighChurch    HighChurch  What the Meaning of the Words  HighChurch    HighChurch  is in the Original with the various Readings thereof and more particularly how they are to be understood as plac'd by Way of  Antithesis  against  Hanover  and King  George  I leave to the Decision of the University to be determined in full Convocation for doubtless the University  would give the true Etimology of them as they are now made use of nor would it a little contribute to the enlightening the World in that Matter on this eminent Occasion and especially to vindicate the University her self from many wicked and malicious Calumnies by which her Enemies think to charge her with being in the Interest of the  Pretender  Now whether the Words  HIGH CHƲRCH  as now used are synonimous to the Words  Popery    right Line    indefeasible    hereditary Right  and so are to be understood that  HighChurch  are for the  Pretender  or whether they are otherwise to be understood and how is it possible they should be otherwise understood These are the Questions and indeed they are Questions worthy the publick Decision of the University by either explaining or exploding which the University would bring to her self immortal Fame of one sort or other  To leave therefore the Discourse of this Nature and leave the ridiculous Jargon of the Mobb to the just Censure of the University it remains only to mention the said Tumults with the same just Abhorrence that the said  University look on them with and having thus cleared the University of being any Way guilty either of abetting or encouraging such preposterous Things I come next by Way of an humble Address to the University to recommend to them the Necessity there seems to be of their giving the World such Testimony as to their great Wisdom shall seem meet of their utter Dislike and Detestation of these wicked and pernicious Practices with necessary Assurances that not the Colleges no nor any Members thereof had the least Concern therein  This seems necessary at this Time because as it was a Misfortune to the University to have these Riots and Tumults approach so near them as to be within the Walls of the same City where they reside so other People being made to believe however falsly that the University have some Way or other directly or indirectly been concern'd in or Assistant and encouraging to the said rebellious doings have taken Encouragement from hence to soment the like in many Parts of his Majesty's Dominions and have given the Example of  Oxford  as their Precedent  Now although some are as the Author hereof professes to be well assured that the University has had no Confederacy in this wicked Affair nor that any of her Reverend Members could reasonably be imagined to show themselves among the said Rabbles on those unhappy Occasions yet for the sakes of some who have not the same Charity having been deluded by evildisposed Persons whose Actions required to have such a Cover for them and who have therefore believed that Abundance of the Students Graduates Fellows and even of the Reverend and Excellent Superiours of the University have given Countenance to the Rabbles and have even appear'd in the Streets of the City of  Oxford  in the said rebellious Tumults for these Reasons and for ever to establish the Reputation of the famous University in the Opinion of all good Men it is most humbly represented how necessary it would be to have the University declare themselves on these Heads  This would do more than all the Vindications of their Friends can pretend to this would perhaps do more  to prevent future Riots and Tumults in other Parts of the Kingdom even than Horse and Dragoons  On the other Hand  IF the University  is willing  the Slanders of her Enemies should take Place  IF she is  contented  that it should be believ'd both by Natives at Home and by Foreigners Abroad that she has forsaken the Loyalty of her Principles abandon'd the ancient Doctrines of the Church of  England  and the Profession made by her Learned and Pious Predecessors  IF she is  desirous  to have it believed that the University of  Oxford  is a Pattern of Rebellion and that she has imbib'd the  fanatick  Principles of  IF she would be thought to have declar'd War against King  GEORGE  and openly to have espoused the Interest of the  Pretender  IF she desires that the Rabbles and Tumults lately raised in her Streets should be called by her Name and should as in her Name be recommended to the rest of the distracted People of this Nation In a Word  IF the University glories in the first Violence offered to the peaceable Establishment of the House of  Hanover  and a glorious Protestant Race of Princes and declares her self to be for the forcible Introductoin of a  Popish    Frenchbred  thoroughly provok'd resolv'd to be reveng'd  Pretender  she has no more to do than to sit still and take no Notice of this Address her Silence being all the Favour that is asked by those who she desires should take it all in the Affirmative  AN ACCOUNT c  _IF illustrious Ancestors high Birth a capital Fortune glorious Titles and the true Merit of a long Race of Men belov'd by their Princes and by their Country were the things by which the Character of his Grace the Duke of  Ormond  was now to be set forth our Business would be to look into the History not of the Duke himself but of his noble and illustrious House and to lay down not only a Line of their noble Descent but a long Detail of their glorious Actions in which it must in Justice be own'd that the present Duke has as much to value himself upon as most Families of the Nobility can boast of  But as this kind of Honour has been for some Ages pretty much out of Fashion with wise Men and that now personal Merit seems something necessary to qualify Men of Quality for the Esteem of the Age wherein they live we must be content to wave all the Pretences which may be justly made to the Honour of the Family now before us to bury the Trophies of Ancestors and begin our History with the personal Conduct the Bravery the generous Principles the great Actions the Fidelity the Prudence Policy Gallantry and other distinguishing Vertues of the Person of his Grace the Duke of  Ormond  for which he has been so justly belov'd by the  English  Nation And from hence if a faithful Account be drawn we shall soon see whether the People of these Nations have not with great Reason so much distinguish'd his Grace in their Affections in these Days of his declining Circumstances and thus we shall if true Merit appears build his Grace the most lasting Monument of Glory because founded upon his own Personal Merit according to that of  Juvenal    English'd  by Mr  Dryden  Ergo ut miremur te nec tua primum aliquid da  Juven Sat VIII  That we may therefore you not yours admire  First Sir some Honour of your own acquire  And first to the Honour of his first Appearance in the Field we find his Grace the Duke of  Ormond  one of the first of the  English  Nobility who appear'd Volunteer in the Field in the first War against the  French  where he made his first Campaign under the trulyGlorious King  William  If the Example of such a King and His Majesty's special Affection to the Duke inspir'd his Soul with vigorous Principles and his natural Courage join'd to them prompted him to great Actions nothing is more certain than that this Virtue had its early Reward in the Distinction with which His Majesty treated the Duke upon all Occasions the Favour he shew'd him and that particular Affection which the King shew'd to him in several remarkable Cases  I know it has been suggested that the King who all Men know was a politick Prince and found out the Inside  of Men as soon as any Prince in the World could do did not shew his Grace so much Favour singly upon his own Account but that finding but few of the Nobility at that Time enclin'd to a Military Life and being very desirous by any Means to invite and encourage them to come into the Field he put the Duke in such a Posture and Figure in his Camp as was enough to move any Man of Honour to love the War for his sake wherein the King seem'd as they said to treat the Duke as if he had been the Representative of the Nobility and that they might see with what Distinction an  Englishman  would be used in the Army for said they the King was not so ill read in Men as not to know that there were many who might lay as great a Claim to his Favour on Account of Merit as the Duke  During the first Year therefore of the War the greatest Part of the  Duke  's Fame consisted in those Favours which the King did him and the Honours which he receiv'd from Foreigners on that Account for whom the King honour'd it was no Wonder at all to see honour'd by others  The Duke was but a young Man when he went into the Army which was in the Year when he went over to  Ireland  And we read of him at the Battle of the  Boyn  but all we have of him in that Action terminates in this that the Day after the Battle he was sent with some Troops to take Possession of  Dublin  and though this was as is noted but to take Possession for the Citizens of  Dublin  had already taken Arms and turn'd out the  Irish  and sent to the King to receive them into his Protection yet was Monsieur  Overkirk  sent with the Troops so that the Duke had no Command but was sent with them as being a Person by Name honour'd in  Ireland  for his Family and for the great Estate which he possest in that Kingdom so that hitherto the Duke'  s  History began principally on the Fame of his Birth and no Merit of his own other than that he was a brisk promising young Gentleman and having the Advantage of such a Tutor as the King gave Hopes that in Time if his Understanding prov'd equal to his Courage he would be a very great Man in the mean Time he was made one of  the Privy Council in  Ireland  an Honour every one knows was the Consequence of his Birth and of the Rank which he bore among the Nobility of that Kingdom in which if my Memory fails me not there was not any Man of the Rank of a Duke but himself at least who embrac'd King  William  's Party  The next Time we hear of his Grace was in  Holland  for we do not find any thing of him in the Campaign of  Limerick  or that he quitted the Court to go any more into the Field But the King having appointed the next Year that famous Congress of Princes at the  Hague  the like of which the World has not seen for many Ages his Grace and the late Duke of  Norfolk  were the only two  English  Dukes who appear'd at Court on that Occasion in which all that we read of his Grace the Duke of  Ormond  amounts to this That he made the greatest Show of any of the  English  Nobility and even beyond some Sovereign Princes that appear'd there That at the great Feast which the King made  Au Maison du Bois  at the  Hague  his Grace had a Cushion given him and  sat at Table with the King next to the Elector of  Brandenburg  and on the King's Right Hand and that the Elector of  Brandenburg  drank to his Grace and not to any other of the  English  Noblemen  These were his Grace's first Campaigns for these Honours and such like may well be said to take up the first three Year of his Grace's being abroad with the King But the War coming on apace and the Service being like to be very warm he that was thus honoured to be near the King at his Table could not expect but in the Field where it was well known His Majesty never spar'd himself he must be equally expos'd and that nothing but the utmost Gallantry and Love of Action could recommend him to his Majesty and as the Gallantry of the Duke had not yet been try'd but promis'd fair his Grace prepar'd himself for the Field with a Resolution to venture his Life with the King in the Quality of such an Officer as Time and the Favour of his Prince should offer him  The King who was a known Encourager as well as Rewarder of generous and gallant Spirits soon found the Duke was Master of as much personal Gallantry as was requisite for a General Officer and rather strove upon all Occasions to add a due Proportion of Phlegm to the great Quantity of Fire that Nature and his high Birth had given this young Duke that so he might by weighing and by restraining his Forwardness bring him to act with Temper as well as Feat and procure him that necessary Qualification of a General  viz  a cool Head to a warm Heart how far his Majesty went in this Part and with what Success Time has shewn  The first Appearance however that his late Grace made in the Army was very particular that is for its extraordinary Magnificence his Grace affecting to make his Quarters the general Rendezvous of the  English  Officers where he kept a Table like a Prince feasted all that came to him and liv'd at an Expence superior not only to all the other Generals but even to the King himself His Majesty though  he never affected that Part himself nor did at that Time much approve of it as what tended rather to effeminate his Men than to qualify them for the Fatigues of the Campaign yet was pleased to indulge this popular Humour in the Duke and to make him a particular Allowance to support the Charge what the Effects of that Allowance was every one who was present on those Occasions knows  viz  That the Duke was so far from letting that Allowance be an Assistance or Relief to his private Fortunes that it only serv'd to encrease the luxuriant Expence and he fail'd not to run out with such a boundless Profusion as consum'd all his Majesty's Allowance and all that his own Estate could supply also and not only that but to contract immenso Debts such as it may be fear'd the Creditors would gladly know now how to have secur'd to them  It cannot be forgotten that some People took so much Offence at this Excess as to speak to the King of it more than once and even to suggest that it seem'd so much to affect Popularity in the Army that it might  be of dangerous Consequence in the End but that his Majesty was always pleased to put it by and to express himself in Favour of the Duke's Honesty more than in Favour of his Understanding intimating that he was a Man  without Design  This however is noted for the Reader's observation and whereby he may see that the Popularity of this great Man seems to have its Rise and Beginning rather in the Profusion of his Expences his Contempt of Money and an unwary Extravagance than in the Glory and Merit of his Actions and if such a monstrous Extravagance can entitle a Person to the Affection so as to set him above the National Justice then is the Reward of Vice greater than the Reward of Virtue  But be that as it will the Way of living above naturally brought to the Duke a Multitude of Hangers on and by Consequence just so many Flatterers who made it their Business to trumpet Praises and fulsome Things of their Benefactor and were requited again with the Bounty and Beneficence of the General on all Occasions  and what Wonder if this Behaviour in an Army full of needy Persons and Men of Fortune and that by this and a general Affability and Condescending even to a Familiarity to the Soldiery he became exceedingly beloved by the Army  It is not for this short Discourse to enter into an Enquiry how far a true Fame can be raised upon Actions really not justifiable in themselves and whether a Person being to an Excess profuse as well of his own as of other Mens shall be esteemed an inimitable Virtue I remember it was objected by some satyrical People in this City against a Reverend Prelate of our Church that his Charity was carry'd up to such a Height that it became criminal and that he would borrow Money though he knew himself unable to repay it and that when borrow'd he would give it away to relieve the Poor Clergy and this the censorious Part of the World reproach'd him with calling it  Robbery for Burnt Offering  But much more would this have been criminal had it been borrow'd to keep a profuse Table and to spend in luxurious  Treats What offers in his Favour is that it was the meer Effect of the generous Bounty of his Temper without any Design of evil to any one and that though he impair'd his Estate by it yet his Grace was always ready to yield to reasonable Retrenchments at Home and even to alienate his Estate for the Satisfaction of his just Debts and that he has testify'd this by particular Examples more than once  If this should be granted it will go far indeed to recommend the generous Spirit of the Duke in doing just things at last but it will be hard even for the University of  Oxford  it self to convince the World that such a thoughtless Bounty which should reduce a Man of such a Figure not only to expend the greatest Allowance any King of  England  ever made to a General but to a Necessity of alienating his Inheritance and beggering his Posterity I say that such a thoughtless Bounty should entitle a Man to a popular Reputation and erect him in the Thoughts of the People as a Person qualify'd to be cry'd up even against the King himself  But perhaps this is not all for who indeed can think it should Let us look farther into his History and the next thing we hear of the Duke of  Ormond  is that when the great Battle of  Landen  was fought the Duke who commanded the Troops of the  English  Houshold and was by this Time a LieutenantGeneral was taken Prisoner by the  French  and carry'd to  Namure  where to his great good Fortune he was immediately exchanged for the Duke of  Berwick  who was taken by the King's Army after which he serv'd with a due Applause for all will allow him to be personally brave and to be able to act under another General with as much Vigor as can be desir'd  No sooner was the late Queen come to the Crown and the War renewed against  France  with this Addition that  Spain  was now against us as it had been before for us But Her Majesty having resolv'd upon an Expedition against  Spain  where Hopes were given that the  Spaniards  would by the Help of the  Almirante de Castile  declare against King  Philip  on Sight of an  English  Fleet and Army  But Her Majesty had made choice of the Duke of  Ormond  to command in that Expedition  How his Grace brought the Army to the Bay of  Cadiz  landed at Port St  Mary  's and how for want of his Grace's being a less goodnatur'd Man and more a General that rich Town was entirely sack'd and plunder'd and the innocent  Spanish  Merchants Houses miserably plundered of an immense Treasure contrary to the QUEEN's Design and indeed by a base Violence of inferior Generals presuming on the Easiness and good Temper of their General This is well known to most Men as well as it is that the  Spaniards  were so far from being brought to favour the Design of the  English  after that as was expected that they for ever after hated us and omitted no Occasion of shewing the most implacable Aversion to the  English  Nation and even to King  Charles  III for our sakes as was possible and which never abated till the Battle of  Almanza  where they paid us Home for it neither did it abate then insomuch that it was thought fit afterwards to act in  Catalonia  rather with  Germans    or indeed with any Nation's Troops than with  English  This was what we may call the Effect of what some call a goodnatur'd Gentleman which in a Soldier may sometimes be fatal and deserve a meaner Title  It is true Fortune remembred the Duke in the same Voyage and kindly made him a Present of the  Vigo  Fleet with the Conquest of which coming fresh grown with Laurels the People who thought he had brought much more Money than he did shouted him through the Streets with infinite Acclamations and indeed had his Grace had more Soldiers and fewer Thieves in his Army that had been a happy Voyage for  England  equal to that of Sir  Francis Drake  But alas never was so much lost and so little got as by that Voyage the great Disaster whereof is by some said to be owing to the easy Temper of the General who having no Value for Money himself seem'd almost entirely to forget of what Use it was to his Country or that there were some at Home who knew how to employ it though perhaps he did not  From this Time his late Gra  appear'd very little in the Field b  enjoy'd the full Benefits of Peace  the midst of a bloody War having the Profits heap'd upon him of many advantageous Posts such as that of the first Troop of HorseGuards Lord Lieutenant of  Ireland  and the like all which his natural Profusion remaining to him have been so ill able to supply him that added to his own Estate they have been far from preserving him from an immense Debt which it is believ'd exceeds all that any  English  Nobleman has contracted within the Memory of Man the old Duke of  Buckingham  only excepted  It is not my Design to load the Person of the late Duke with Reflections at a Time when he is already under the Resentment of the Parliament and People of  Great Britain  fled his Country and attainted of Treason and for this Reason I forbear to enter into any Part of his History during his late general Command of the Army under the Queen nor is it needful the Application of the present Discourse turning upon another Point and rather respecting  the People of  Great Britain  than the Duke of  Ormond  and the Question which occurs from all that has been said is properly directed to them to enquire what there has been in all the History of this late Noble Person that entitles him to the Affection of the common People or that should make him be beloved much less that should set him up to be the Idol of the Mob and to have his Health drunk in a Sort of Opposition to the King's as the weak and unthinking People have been taught to do  And it is very well worth Observation that if you ask one of the best informed among the common People What it is they admire the late Duke of  Ormond  for What are his Virtues what have been the Particulars of his Life They have little to say nothing but that he is a good natur'd generous freehearted Man so that in a few Words to spend a Man's Estate without Forecast without Bounds and in a Manner which no prudent Man can do is the true Way to be admir'd and the most egregious Folly the Foundation of Popularity  But is it a Virtue to squander away immense Sums of Money Is spending a great Estate a valuable thing and fit to recommend a Man to the Esteem of the People of  England  Why then none but Beggars must be the Peoples Favourites and to have a great Multitude of Creditors is to become truly popular I cannot see upon what Foundation such Men can claim the Favour of the People but what the Inhabitants of the  Fleet  and  Mint  have as good a Title to in their Proportion and it is a most unanswerable Reflexion upon the Judgment of our People and the Methods they take to place their particular Favours that they are guided by those Accomplishments in the Persons admired which only tend to Vice and Degeneracy and that they are best pleased with that which ought to destroy not attract their Affection It is true that generous Principles and a bountiful open Hand justly recommends a noble Person to our good Opinion especially when selfish narrow Principles are grown so general in the World but in my Opinion a Man ceases to be generous that is open to Profusion and he that  can set no Bounds to his Bounty instead of being a wise Man may rather be said to squander away his Money like a Fool a Man of Honour ought to know the Value of what he bestows and of what he expends otherwise he becomes bountiful to a Vice and throws away his Money not for want of Avarice but for want of Understanding  And for what can this be said to recommend him unless he shall be said to become popular meerly on the same Account that the People fall into Rabbles and Tumults not because they are wise but because they are mad  It is Time for the People of  England  then to consider the particular Case and if they will not remove their Acclamations and Cry of Tumult from the Person of the Duke yet for their own Reputation let them remove it from his Vice and find out some of his Virtues to fix it upon for certainly a meer making Ducks and Drakes of his Money cannot recommend him or if it does it  must be only to those who can give no Reason for what they do  It has been alledged by some that this Popularity of the Duke's has risen from the Accident of Circumstances and that it has not been at all of the Duke's seeking or desiring or from any greater Esteem than was before shewn him but because the Party who have of late shewn themselves Opposers of the Government and of the House of  Hanover  had no Body else to name to the Mobb who they durst mention in publick  If this should be true the Duke has very little Obligation to those People and moreover it is the severest Satyr upon the  Jacobite  Interest that it could be possible to mention being a clear Testimony that their  Pretender  has no Share in the Affections of the People and that they could hope for no Favour among the Commons if they did so much as name him  Upon the whole it appears That first as the Duke has no peculiar Accomplishments of his own which can be said to recommend him to the  Mobb so all that has been done to render him popular has been done not only without any personal Merit of his own but which is worse from a private Piece of Policy making him a Cover to their  Jacobite  Design and no better than a meer Tool for the  Pretender  FINIS
