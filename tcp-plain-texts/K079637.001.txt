  VOL I  By WILLIAM GILPIN A M PREBENDARY OF SALISBURY AND VICAR OF BOLDRE IN NEWFOREST NEAR LYMINGTON  LONDON PRINTED FOR R BLAMIRE STRAND  MDCCXCI  TO William Mitford Esq LIEUT COL OF THE SOUTHERN BATTALION OF HAMPSHIREMILITIA AND ONE OF THE VERDERORS OF NEWFOREST  Vicar'shill  March  DEAR SIR  WHEN your friendship fixed me in this pleasing retreat within the precincts of Newforest I had little intention of wandering farther among it's scenes than the bounds of my own parish or of amusing myself  any more with writing on pic∣turesque subjects But one scene drew me on to another till at length I had traversed the whole forest The subject was new to me I had been much among lakes and mountains but I had never lived in a forest I knew little of it's scenery Every thing caught my attention and as I generally had a memorandumbook in my hand I made minutes of what I observed throwing my remarks under the two heads of  forestscenery in general  and  the scenery of particular places  Thus as small things lead to greater an evening walk or ride became the foundation of a volume  In methodizing my remarks I divided them into three books In the first I have considered trees which are the foundation of all scenery as  single objects  I have endeavoured to investigate their general picturesque quali∣tiesin their several kindsand in the specific character of each concluding the book with a short account of some of the most cele∣brated trees which have been noticed  The second book considers trees under their various modes of  composition  from the clump to the forest It considers them likewise under the several picturesque cir∣cumstances  of  permanent  and  acci∣dental  beauty in which we often find them As the first book con∣cluded with an account of distin∣guished trees the second concludes with a short view of foresthistory and of the several forests that may be traced in Great Britain  This leads me directly to Newforest which is the subject of the third book It opens with a few observations on this cele∣brated tract of country The scenery of it is next described in a series of journeys through it's several divisions and lastly the modes and habits of life are re∣marked  of such animals as in∣habit and embellish it  It is now my dear Sir above ten years since you first saw this work in MS during which time it has received frequent revisal and much addition as new occur∣rences and observations arose To many of my friends likewise I owe obligations who have assisted me with their criticisms and to you in particular who are so well acquainted with these scenes and have furnished me with many ju∣dicious remarks and entertaining forestanecdotesI am desirous you see to engage you with me in this work You are as fond of  these amusements as I am and when we trifle we like to have the sanction of those we esteem to trifle with usI hope how∣ever that while you shewing the world how Herodotus and Thucy∣dides would have written in Eng∣lish are throwing the colours of truth on the crimes of antiquity and while I am humbly endeavour∣ing to point out as my profession leads that greater advantages should be attended with more virtuous conductthe world will not be so cynical as to find fault with our amusements which tho certainly innocent and rational I believe neither of us considers as the prin∣cipal employment of our lives  How far the following work may be an amusement to others I know not You will I am sure accept it with indulgence and as a mark of that esteem affection and friendship with which I am my dear Sir  Your very sincere And obliged humble servant WILLIAM GILPIN  TRANSLATION OF QUOTATIONS in the First Volume  VOL I  Page  Deep in the bowels of the earth the oak  With hardy effort drives his vigorous root  And rears his head as high No winterstorm  Can touch a trunk so founded Years revolve  The puny generations of mankind  Each after each expire yet firm he stands  And stretching far and wide his sinewy arms  With comprehensive span and sweep of shade  O'er spreads a district  Page The ash is the most beautiful of all the trees of the wood  Page As the letters of our names increase on the bark so shall our love  Page Under the shelter of a spreading beech  Page The light metal crackled in the wind  Page The maple stained with various hues  Page  No greater beauty can adorn  The hamlet than a grove of ancient oak  Ah how unlike their sires of elder times  The sons of Gallia now They in each tree  Dreading some unknown power dared not to lift  An axe tho scant of soil they rather sought  For distant herbage than molest their groves  Now all is spoil and violence Where now  Exists an oak whose venerable stem  Has seen three centuries unless some steep  To human footstep inaccessible  Defend a favoured plant Now if some fire  Leave to his heir a forestscene that heir  With graceless hands hews down each awful trunk  Worthy of Druid reverence there he rears  A paltry copse destined each twentieth year  To blaze inglorious on the hearth Hence woods  Which sheltered once the stag and grisly boar  Scarce to the timorous hare sure refuge lend  Farewell each rural virtue with the love  Of rural scenes Sage Contemplation wings  Her flight No more from burning suns she seeks  A cool retreat No more the poet sings  Amid reechoing groves his moral lay  Page My guide shewed me here what I can call only the shell or bark of a chesnuttree but of such amazing circumference that one of the shepherds of the country used it as a fold for a large flock of sheep  Page Even the very gods inhabited groves  Page The grove used as a temple  Page  He shewed  A grove which Romulus in aftertimes  Made an asylum Near it rose a rock  Bedewed with weeping springs sacred to Pan  And once more sacred to the injured shade  Of murdered Argiletus Then he called  The gods to witness that his soul abhorred  The impious deed To the Tarpeian rock  He led the hero next where now in pomp  The capitol upheaves it's splendid towers  Then but a thicket interwoven close  With nature's wildest products Yet e'en then  A superstitious awe and holy fear  O'erspread the scene Doubtless some god what god  We know not holds his sacred residence  Upon the wooded crest of yon dark grove  Oft when the storm with brooding darkness o'er  That wood arises the Arcadians see  Or think they see the mighty Jove himself  Rolling his thunder and with bare right arm  Flashing his lightnings on a guilty land  Page  These woods the fawns and nymphs once held  Here too a hardy race of men subsist  Unversed in all the arts of life they know  Nor how to yoke the ox nor turn the glebe  Content with the bare produce of the woods  And what the chace affords  Page Almost the third part of England is uncul∣tivated and possessed only by stags deer or wildgoats which last are found chiefly in the northern parts Rabbits too abound every  where You every where meet with vast forests where these wildbeasts range at large or with parks secured by pales Hunting is the principal amusement of all the people of distinction  OBSERVATIONS ON FOREST SCENERY BOOK I  SECTION I  IT is no exaggerated praise to call a tree the  grandest  and most  beautiful  of all the pro∣ductions of the earth In the former of these epithets nothing contends with it for we consider rocks and mountains as part of the earth itself And tho among inferior plants shrubs and flowers there is great beauty yet when we consider that these minuter pro∣ductions are chiefly beautiful as  individuals  and are not adapted to form the arrangement of  composition in landscape  nor to receive the  effects of light and shade  they must give place in point of  beauty  of  picturesque beauty  at least which we are here consideringto the form and foliage and ramification of the tree  Thus the splendid tints of the insect how∣ever beautiful must yield to the elegance and proportion of animals which range in a higher class  With animal life I should not set the tree in competition The shape the differentcoloured fur the varied and spirited attitudes the character and motion which strike us in the animal creation are certainly beyond stilllife in its most pleasing appearance I should only observe with regard to trees that nature has been kinder to them in point of  variety  than even to its  living forms  Tho every animal is distinguished from its fellow by some little variation of colour character or shape yet in all the  larger parts  in the body and limbs the resemblance is generally exact In trees it is just the reverse the  smaller parts  the spray the leaves the blos∣som and the seed are the same in all trees of the same kind while the larger parts from which the  most beautiful varieties  result are wholly different You never see two oaks with an equal number of limbs the same kind of head and twisted in the same form However as  variety  is not alone sufficient to give superiority to the tree we give the pre∣ference on the whole to animal life  SECT II  TREES when young like striplings shoot into taper forms There is a lightness and an airiness in them which is pleasing but they do not spread and receive their just proportions till they have attained their full growth  There is as much difference too in trees I mean in trees of the same kind in point of beauty as there is in human figures The limbs of some are set on awkwardly their trunks are disproportioned and their whole form is unpleasing The same rules which establish elegance in other objects establish it in these There must be the same harmony of parts the same sweeping line the same contrast the same ease and freedom A bough indeed may issue from the trunk at rightangles and yet elegantly as it frequently does in the oak but it must immediately form some  contrasting sweep or the junction will be awkward  All forms that are  unnatural  displease A tree lopped into a maypole as you generally see in the hedgerows of Surry and some other countries is disgusting Clipped yews lime hedges and pollards are for the same reason disagreeable and yet I have sometimes seen a pollard produce a good effect when nature has been suffered for some years to bring it again into form but I never saw a good effect pro∣duced by a pollard on which some single stem was left to grow into a tree The stem is of a different growth it is disproportioned and always unites awkwardly with the trunk  Not only all forms that are unnatural displease but even natural forms when they bear a resemblance to art unless indeed these forms are characteristic of the species A cypress pleases in a conic form but an oak or an elm trimmed into that appearance would disgust In the cypress nature adapts the spray and branches to the form of the tree In the oak and elm the spray and branches form a different character  Lightness  also is a characteristic of beauty in a tree for tho there are beautiful trees of a heavy as well as of a light form yet their extremities must in some parts be separated and hang with a degree of looseness from the fulness of the foliage which occupies the middle of the tree or the whole will only be a large bush From position indeed and contrast heaviness tho in itself a deformity may be of singular use in the composition both of natural and of artificial landscape  A tree also must be  wellbalanced  to be beautiful It may have form and it may have lightness and yet lose all its effect by wanting a proper poise The bole must appear to support the branches We do not desire to see it supporting it's burden with the per∣pendicular firmness of a column An easy sweep is always agreeable but at the same time it should not be such a sweep as dis∣covers one side plainly overbalanced  On bleak seacoasts trees generally take an unbalanced form and indeed in general some  foreign cause must operate to occasion it for nature working freely is as much inclined to balance a tree upon it's trunk as an animal upon it's legs  And yet in some circumstances I have seen beauty arise even from an unbalanced tree but it must arise from some peculiar situation which gives it a local propriety A tree for instance hanging from a rock tho totally unpoised may be beautiful or it may have a good effect when we see it bending over a road because it corresponds with it's peculiar situation We do not in these cases admire it as a tree but as the adjunct of an effect the beauty of which does not give the eye leisure to attend to the deformity of the instru∣ment through which the effect is produced  Without these requisites therefore  form lightness  and a  proper balance  no tree can have that  species of beauty  which we call  picturesque  SECT III  BESIDES these requisites of beauty in a tree there are other things of an  adven∣titious kind  which often add great beauty to it And here I cannot help lamenting the capricious nature of  picturesque ideas  In many instances they run counter to  utility  and in nothing more than in the adventitious beauties ascribed to trees Many of these are derived from the injuries the tree receives or the diseases to which it is subject Mr Lawson a naturalist of the last age thus enu∣merates them "How many forests and woods says he have we wherein you shall have for one lively thriving tree four nay sometimes twentyfour evil thriving rotten and dying trees what rottenness what hol∣lowness what dead arms withered tops curtailed trunks what loads of mosses droop∣ing  boughs and dying branches shall you see every where"  See Lawson's Orchard  Now all these maladies which our dis∣tressed naturalist bemoans with so much feeling are often capital sources of picturesque beauty both in the wild scenes of nature and in arti∣ficial landscape  What is more beautiful for instance on a rugged foreground than an old tree with a  hollow trunk  or with a  dead arm  a  drooping bough  or a  dying branch  all which phrases I apprehend are nearly synonymous  From the  withered top  also great use and beauty may result in the composition of land∣scape when we wish to break the regularity of some continued line which we would not intirely hide  By the  curtailed trunk  I suppose Mr Lawson means a tree whose principal stem has been shattered by winds or some other accident while the lower part of it is left in vigour This is also a beautiful circumstance and it's application equally useful in landscape The  withered top  just breaks the lines of an  eminence the  curtailed trunk  discovers the whole while the lateral branches which are vigorous and healthy in both hide any part of the lower landscape which wanting variety is better veiled  For the use and beauty of the  withered top  and  curtailed trunk  we need only appeal to the works of Salvator Rosa in many of which we find them of great use Salvator had often occasion for an object on his fore∣grounds as large as the trunk of a tree when the whole tree together in it's full state of grandeur would have been an incumbrance to him A young tree or a bush might probably have served his purpose with regard to  composition  but such dwarfs and striplings could not have preserved the dignity of his subject like the ruins of a noble tree These splendid remnants of decaying grandeur speak to the imagination in a stile of eloquence which the stripling cannot reach they record the history of some storm some blast of lightening or other great event which trans∣fers it's grand ideas to the landscape and in the representation of elevated subjects assists the sublime  Whether these maladies in trees ever produce beauty in  adorned nature  I much doubt Kent was hardy enough even  to plant a withered tree  but the error was too glaring for imitation Objects in every mode of composition should harmonize and all we venture to assert is that these maladies are then only sources of beauty either in the wild scenes of nature or in artificial landscape when they are the ap∣pendages of  some particular mode of composition  The last and most beautiful of those diseases which Mr Lawson ascribes to trees is  moss  This it is true is one of nature's minutiae and in painting touches not the great parts  composition  and  effect  Nor is it of use in mere drawing But in coloured landscape it is surely a very beautiful object of imitationThe variety of mossesthe green which tinges the trunk of the beech the brimstone co∣loured and black which stain the oak and the yellow which is frequently found on the elm and ash are among the most beautiful of those tints which embellish the bark of trees  I have often stood with admiration before an old forestoak examining the various tints which have enriched it's furrowed stem The  genuine bark of an oak is of an ashcolour tho it is difficult to distinguish any part of it from the mosses that overspread it for no oak I suppose was ever without a greater or a less proportion of these picturesque ap∣pendages The lower parts about the roots are often possessed by that green velvet moss which in a still greater degree commonly oc∣cupies the bole of the beech tho the beauty and brilliancy of it lose much when in decay As the trunk rises you see the brimstone colour taking possession in patches Of this there are two principal kinds a smooth sort which spreads like a scurf over the bark and a rougher sort which hangs in little rich knots and fringes I call it a brimstone hue by way of general distinction but it some∣times inclines to an olive and sometimes to a light green Intermixed with these mosses you often find a species perfectly white Be∣fore I was acquainted with it I have some∣times thought the tree whitewashed Here and there a touch of it gives a lustre to the trunk and has it's effect yet on the whole it is a nuisance for as it generally begins to thrive when the other mosses begin to wither as if the  decaying  bark were it's  proper nutriment it is rarely accompanied with any of the more beautiful species of it's kind and when thus unsupported it always disgusts This white moss by the way is esteemed a certain mark of age and when it prevails in any degree is a clear indication that the vigour of the tree is declining We find also another species of moss of a dark brown colour inclining nearly to black another of an ashy colour and another of a dingy yellow We may observe also touches of red and sometimes but rarely a bright yellow which is like a gleam of sunshine and in many trees you will see one species growing upon another the knotted brimstonecoloured fringe clinging to a lighter species or the black softening into redStrictly speaking many of these excrescences which I have mentioned under the general name of  mosses  should have been distinguished by other names All those particularly which cling close to the bark of trees and have a leprous scabby appearance are classed I believe by botanists under the name of  lychens  others are called  liverworts  But all these excre∣scences under whatever names distinguished add a great richness to trees and when they  are blended harmoniously as is generally the case the rough and furrowed trunk of an old oak adorned with these pleasing appen∣dages is an object which will long detain the picturesque eye  But besides the appearance of moss upon the trunks of trees it creeps among the branches and sometimes takes possession not only of the larger boughs but even of the smaller spray In winter this has often a fine effect when the whole tree turned into a beautiful piece of strawcoloured coral appears against a dark wood or some other back∣ground which gives it relief In a strong sunshine too it is beautiful when the light strawcoloured tints contrast with the shadows formed by the twisting of the boughs which are sometimes still further deepened by some of the darker mosses  Thus the maladies of trees are greatly sub∣servient to the uses of the pencil The foliage is the dress and these are the ornaments Even the poet will sometimes deign to array his tree with these picturesque ornaments I am always glad of his authority when I can have it and I have seen a poetical oak gar∣nished in a way that the painter might copy  from In general however the poet is not like the painter  uniform  in his admiration of these pleasing appendages If at one time he admires them with the painter and ranks them among the picturesque beauties of na∣ture at another he sides with the woodman and brushes them away Nay I have known him conjure up some mighty agent as guar∣dian of his woods who cries out  From Jove I am the Power  Of this fair wood and live in oaken bower  I nurse my saplins tall and cleanse their rind  From vegetating filth of every kind  And all my plants I save from nightly ill  Of noisome winds and blasting vapours chill  Besides Mr Lawson's catalogue of maladies we might enumerate others which are equally the sources of beauty The  blasted tree  has often a fine effect both in natural and in arti∣ficial landscape In some scenes it is almost essential When the dreary heath is spread before the eye and ideas of wildness and desolation are required what more suitable accompaniment can be imagined than the blasted oak ragged scathed and leafless shooting it's peeled white branches athwart the gathering blackness of some rising storm  Ivy  is another mischief incident to trees which has a good effect It gives great rich∣ness to an old trunk both by it's stem which often winds round it in thick hairy irregular volumes and by it's leaf which either decks the furrowed bark or creeps among the branches or hangs carelessly from them In all these circumstances it unites with the mosses and other furniture of the tree in adorning and enriching it But when it gathers into a heavy body which is often the case it becomes rather a deformity In summer indeed it's bushiness is lost in the foliage of the tree but in winter  naked branches  make a disagreeable appearance staring from a  thick bush  And yet in autumn I have seen a beautiful contrast between a bush of ivy which had completely invested the head of a pollardoak and the dark brown tint of the withered leaves which still held possession of the branches But this was a mere accidental effect for you may see many pollardoaks with withered leaves and covered with ivy and yet not see the tints so happily arranged as to produce an effect  In the spring also we sometimes have a pleasing appearance of a similar kind About the end of April when the foliage of the oak  is just beginning to expand it's varied tints are often delightfully contrasted with the deep green of an ivy bush which has overspread the body and larger limbs of the tree and the contrast has been still more beautiful when the limbs are covered as we sometimes see them with tufts of brimstonecoloured moss  All these plants are  parasitical  as the botanist expressively calls them The tribes of mosses lychens and liverworts make no pretence to independence They are absolute retainers Not one of them gets his own livelihood nor takes the least step towards it The ivy in∣deed is less dependent He has a root of his own and draws nourishment from the ground but his character is misrepresented if his little feelers have not other purposes than merely that of shewing an attachment to his potent neighbour Shakespear roundly asserts he makes a property of him  He was  The ivy which had hid my princely trunk  And suck'd my verdure out  Besides this parasitical tribe the painter ad∣mires another class of humble plants which  live entirely on their own means yet spreading out their little tendrils beg merely the pro∣tection of the great whom if they encumber as they certainly do in a degree they enrich with a variety of beautiful flowers and scarlet berries Many of these tho classed among weeds have great beauty Among them the black and white brionies are distinguished The berries also of many of these little plants are variously coloured in the different states of their growth yellow red and orange All these rich touches however small produce their effect There is another elegant climber called  traveller's joy  which produces indeed no berries but it's feathered seeds are orna∣mental The wild honeysuckle also comes within this class and tho in winding it's spiral coil it may compress the young tree too tightly and in some degree injure it's circulation yet it fully compensates the injury by the beauty and fragrancy of it's flowers  With clasping tendrils it invests the branch  Else unadorned with many a gay festoon  And fragrant chaplet recompensing well  The strength it borrows with the grace it lends  Under warm suns where vines are the offspring of nature nothing can be more beau∣tiful  than the forest tree adorned with their twisting branches hanging from bough to bough and laden with fruit  the clusters clear  Half through the foliage seen  Among the most beautiful appendages of this hanging kind which we have in England is the hop In cultivation it is disagreeable but in it's rude natural state twisting carelessly round the branches of trees I know not whe∣ther it is not as beautiful as the vine It's leaf is similar and tho the bunches of hop beau∣tiful as they are and fragrant are not equal to the clusters of the vine yet it is a more accommodating plant hangs more loosely and is less extravagant in it's growth  In artificial landscape indeed where the subject is sublime these appendages are of little value Such trifling ornaments the scene rejects The rough oak in the dignity of it's simple form adorns the foreground better But in festive or Bacchanalian subjects if such subjects are ever proper for description when the sportive nymphs and satyrs take their repose at noon or gambol in the shade of evening nothing can more beautifully adorn  their retreat or more characteristically mark it than these pendent plants particularly the mantling vine hanging as I have here de∣scribed it in rich festoons from bough to bough  The rooting also of trees is a circumstance on which their beauty greatly depends I know not whether it is reckoned among the maladies of a tree to heave his root above the soil Old trees generally do But whether it be a malady or not it is certainly very picturesque The more they raise the ground around them and the greater number of ra∣dical knobs they heave up the firmer they seem to establish their footing upon the earth and the more dignity they assume An  old tree  rising tamely from a  smooth surface  as we often find it covered with earth in arti∣ficial ground loses half it's effect it does not appear as the lord of the soil but to be stuck into it and would have a still worse effect on canvas than it has in nature  Pliny gives us an account of the roots of certain ancient oaks in the Hercynian forest which appears rather extravagant but which  I can easily conceive may be true These roots he says heave the ground upwards in many places into lofty mounts and in other parts where the earth does not follow them the bare roots rise as high as the lower branches and twisting round form in many places portals so wide that a man and horse may ride upright through them  Nat hist Book xvi chap  This indeed is somewhat higher than picturesque beauty requires it borders rather on the fan∣tastic In  general  however the higher the roots are the more picturesque they appear  To the adventitious beauties of trees we may add their  susceptibility of motion  which is ca∣pable at least of being a considerable source of beauty The waving heads of some and the undulation of others give a continual variety to their forms In nature the motion of trees is certainly a circumstance of great beauty Shakespear formerly made the observation  Things in motion sooner catch the eye  Than what stirs not  To the painter also the  moving tree  affords often a piece of useful machinery when he wishes to express the agitation of air In this light it may even be considered as an objection to trees of firmer branches as the oak that their resistance to every breath of air deprives them at least of one source of beauty and subjects them to be sooner  gotten by heart  if I may so phrase it than other trees which yielding to the pressure are every instant as∣suming new modifications  From the motion of the tree we have also the pleasing circumstance of the  chequered shade  formed under it by the dancing of the sunbeams among it's playing leaves This circumstance tho not so much calculated for picturesque use as it's beauty arises chiefly from it's motion is yet very amusing in nature and may also be introduced in painting when the tree is at rest But it is one of those cir∣cumstances which requires a very artful pen∣cil In it's very nature it opposes the grand principle of massing light and shade How∣ever if it be brought in properly and not suffered to glare it may have it's beauty But whatever becomes of this circumstance in  painting it is very capable of being pleasingly wrought up in poetry  The chequered earth seems restless as a flood  Brushed by the winds So sportive is the light  Shot through the boughs it dances as they dance  Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick  And dark'ning and enlightening as the leaves  Play wanton every part  SECT IV  HAVING thus examined trees in a  general view  I shall now particularize and endeavour to explain the beauties and defects of their  several kinds  as they regard  landscape  I shall first consider them as  individuals  and afterwards in  composition  Trees range under two general heads  deci∣duous  and  evergreen  In this order I shall take them confining my remarks to those only of both kinds which are of English growth whether native or naturalized  Among deciduous trees the  oak  presents itself first It is a happiness to the lovers of the picturesque that this noble plant is as useful as it is beautiful From the utility of the oak they derive this advantage that it is every where found In the choice indeed of it's soil it is rather delicate For tho it  is rather undistinguishing during it's early growth while it's horizontal fibres straggle about the surface of the earth yet when it's taproot begins to enter the depths of the soil perhaps no tree is nicer in it's discrimi∣nations If it's constitution be not suited here it may multiply it's progeny indeed and pro∣duce a thriving copse but the puny race will never rise to lordly dignity in the forest nor furnish navies to command the ocean  The particular and most valued qualities of the oak are  hardness  and  toughness  Shake∣spear uses two epithets to express these qualities which are perhaps stronger than any we can find  Thou rather with thy sharp and sulph'rous bolt  Split'st the  unwedgeable  and  gnarled  oak  Than the soft myrtle  Many kinds of wood are  harder  as box and ebony many kinds are  tougher  as yew and ash but it is supposed that no species of wood at least no species of timber is possessed of both these qualities together in so great a degree as British oak Almost all arts and manufactures are indebted to it but in shipbuilding and bearing burdens it's elasticity  and strength are applied to most advantage I mention these  mechanic uses  only because some of it's  chief beauties  are connected with them Thus it is not the erect stately tree that is always the most useful in shipbuilding but more often the crooked one forming short turns and elbows which the shipwrights and carpenters commonly call  kneetimber  This too is generally the most picturesqueNor is it the strait tall stem whose fibres run in pa∣rallel lines that is the most useful in bearing burdens but that whose sinews are twisted and spirally combined This too is the most picturesque Trees under these circumstances generally take the most pleasing forms  Now the oak perhaps acquires these dif∣ferent modes of growth from the different strata through which it passes In deep rich soils where the root meets no obstruction the stem we suppose grows stately and erect but when the root meets with a rocky stratum a hard and gravelly bed or any other difficulty through which it is obliged in a zigzag course to pick it's way and struggle for a passage the sympathetic stem feeling every motion pursues the same indirect course above which the root does below and thus the sturdy plant  through the means of these subterraneous in∣counters and hardy conflicts assumes form and character and becomes in a due course of centuries a picturesque tree  Virgil has given us the picture of an oak in which it's principal characteristics are well touched  Esculus imprimis quae quantum vertice ad auras  Aethereas tantum radice in Tartara tendit  Ergo non hiemes illam non flabra neque imbres  Convellunt immota manet multosque per annos  Multa virûm volvens durando secula vincit  Tum fortes late ramos et brachia tendens  Huc illuc media ipsa ingentem sustinet umbram  Georg II    I shall not enter into a criticism on the word  esculus  which cannot on any good authority I think signify the beech and Pliny's autho∣rity which I insert below  Pliny speaking of the different kinds of trees which were dedicated to different deities tells us Jovi esculus Apolloni laurus c Lib xii c Now we know that the oak was Jupiter's tree On this point I need only quote Phaedrus  Olim quas vellent esse in tutela sua  Divi legerunt arbores quercus Jovi  Et myrtus Veneri placuit  Pliny also in another place Lib xvi c plainly distinguishes between the  fagus  and the  esculus  "Fagi glans triangula cute includitur Folium tenue populo simile celerrime flavescens c Glandem quae proprie intelligitur ferunt robur quercus esculus Continetur hispido calyce Folia sinuosa lateribus nec cum cadunt flavescentia ut fagi Glans optima in quercu et grandissima mox esculo" From this quotation it is plain that Pliny considers the  esculus  as a variety of the  oak  may be decisive  in favour of it's being the oak But were it not so Virgil's description is so strongly marked with the characters of the oak that it seems to put the matter out of dispute and I introduce the quotation merely to bring together in few words the most obvious qua∣lities of this noble plant in one point of view  The first characteristic which Virgil men∣tions is it's  firmness  or the power and strength with which it takes hold of the ground driving it's taproot in the poet's language even  into the infernal regions  No tree resists the blast so steadily We seldom see the oak like other trees take a twisted form from the winds  Media ipsa ingentem sustinet umbrum  that is I apprehend it pre∣serves it's balance which we have seen is one of the grand picturesque beauties of every tree The oak no doubt like other trees shrinks from the seaair But this indicates no weak∣ness  The seaair like a pestilential disease attacks the strongest constitutions  A second characteristic of the oak of which Virgil takes notice is the  stoutness of it's limbs  it's  fortes ramos  We know no tree except perhaps the cedar of Lebanon so remarkable in this respect The limbs of most trees  spring  from the trunk In the oak they may be rather said to  divide  from it for they generally carry with them a great share of the substance of the stem You hardly know which is stem and which is branch and towards the top the stem is entirely lost in the branches This gives particular propriety to the epithet  fortes  in characterizing the branches of the oak and hence it's sinewy elbows are of such peculiar use in shipbuilding Whoever there∣fore does not mark the  fortes ramos  of the oak might as well in painting a Hercules omit his muscles But I speak only of the hardy veterans of the forest In the effeminate nurs∣lings of the grove we have not this appearance There the tree is all stem drawn up into height When we characterize a tree we consider it in it's natural state insulated and without any lateral pressure In a forest trees naturally grow in that manner The seniors  depress all the juniors that attempt to rise near them But in a  planted  grove all grow up together and none can exert any power over another  The next characteristic of the oak taken notice of by the poet is the  twisting  of it's branches  brachia tendit huc illuc  Examine the ash the elm the beech or almost any other tree and you may observe in what direct and strait lines the branches in each shoot from the stem Whereas the limbs of an oak are continually twisting  huc illuc  in various contortions and like the course of a river sport and play in every possible di∣rection sometimes in long reaches and sometimes in shorter elbows There is not a characteristic more peculiar to the oak than this  Another peculiarity of which Virgil takes notice in the oak is it's  expansive spread  Media ipsa ingentem sustinet umbram  By  ingentem umbram  I do not suppose the poet means a thick compact closewoven foliage like that of the beech which the oak seldom exhibits In general except in very luxuriant soils the foliage of the oak is light  and thin I should therefore suppose that instead of a  closewoven  shade the poet means an  extended  one which indeed is implied in the expression just before used  ramos late tendens  This indeed is a just characteristic of the oak for it's boughs however twisted continually take a horizontal direction and overshadow a large space of ground Indeed where it is fond of it's situation and has room to spread it extends itself beyond any other tree and like a monarch takes possession of the soil  The last Virgilian characteristic of the oak is it's  longevity  which extends I suppose beyond that of any other tree  Multa virûm volvens durando secula vincit  Perhaps the yew may be an exception I men∣tion the circumstance of it's longevity as it is of a nature singularly picturesque It is through age that the oak acquires it's greatest beauty which often continues increasing even into de∣cay if any proportion exists between the stem and the branches When the branches rot away and the forlorn trunk is left alone the tree is in his decrepitudethe last stage of life and all beauty is gone  Spenser has given us a good picture of an oak just verging towards it's last state of decay  A huge oak dry and dead  Sill clad with reliques of it's trophies old  Lifting to heaven it's aged hoary head  Whose foot on earth hath got but feeble hold  And half disbowelled stands above the ground  With wreathed roots and naked arms  And trunk all rotten and unsound  I have dwelt the longer on the oak as it is confessedly both the most picturesque tree in itself and the most accommodating in compo∣sition It refuses no subject either in natural or in artificial landscape It is suited to the grandest and may with propriety be intro∣duced into the most pastoral It adds new dignity to the ruined tower and Gothic arch by stretching it's wild mossgrown branches athwart their ivyed walls it gives them a kind of majesty coeval with itself at the same time it's propriety is still preserved if it throw it's arms over the purling brook or the mantling pool where it beholds  It's reverend image in the expanse below  Milton introduces it happily even in the lowest scene  Hard by a cottage chimney smokes  From between two aged oaks  After the oak let us examine the ash This tree in point of utility is little inferior to the oak It's uses are infinite To the ashen spear the heroes of antiquity were in∣debted for half their prowess In the arts of peace as well as of war in architecture tillage and manufactures the ash objects to business of no kind while even it's very refuse spars are accounted the best fuel in the forest  In some parts of the continent of Europe the ashen billet sells for one half more than any other wood except beech  The ashen billet produces a steady bright lambent flame and as Mr Evelin tells us may be reckoned among the  fuel with little smoke  I have sometimes heard the oak called the Hercules of the forest and the ash the Venus The comparison is not amiss for the oak joins the idea of strength to beauty while the ash rather joins the ideas of beauty and elegance Virgil marks the character of the ash as particularly beautiful  Fraxinus in sylvis pulcherrima  The ash generally carries it's principal stem higher than the oak and rises in an easy flowing line But it's chief beauty consists in the lightness of it's whole appearance It's branches at first keep close to the trunk and form acute angles with it but as they begin to lengthen they generally take an easy sweep and the looseness of the leaves corresponding with the lightness of the spray the whole forms an elegant depending foliage Nothing can have a better effect than an old ash hanging from the corner of a wood and bring∣ing off the heaviness of the other foliage with it's loose pendent branches And yet in some soils I have seen the ash lose much of it's beauty in the decline of age It's foliage becomes rare and meagre and it's branches instead of hanging loosely often start away in disagreeable forms In short the ash often loses that grandeur and beauty in old age which the generality of trees and particularly the oak preserve till a late period of their existence  The ash also on another account falls under the displeasure of the picturesque eye It's leaf is much tenderer than that of the oak and sooner receives impression from the  winds and frost Instead of contributing it's tint therefore in the wane of the year among the manycoloured offspring of the woods it shrinks from the blast drops it's leaf and in each scene where it predominates leaves wide blanks of desolated boughs amidst foliage yet fresh and verdant Before it's decay we sometimes see it's leaf tinged with a fine yellow well contrasted with the neighbouring greens But this is one of nature's casual beauties Much oftener it's leaf decays in a dark muddy unpleasing tint And yet sometimes notwith∣standing this early loss of it's foliage we see the ash in a sheltered situation when the rains have been abundant and the season mild retain it's green a light pleasant green when the oak and the elm in it's neighbourhood have put on their autumnal attire  Another disagreeable circumstance attends the ash which is indeed it's misfortune rather than it's fault It's leaf and rind are nutritrive to deer and much used in browzing them in summer The keepers of the forest there∣fore seek out all the ashtrees they can find which are for this purpose mangled and de∣formed  One thing more I should mention with regard to the ash as it is of a picturesque nature and that is the beauty of it's roots which are often finely veined and will take a good polish Dr Plot in his natural history of Oxfordshire  Chap vi sec  speaks of certain knotty ex∣crescences in the ash called the  brusca  and  mollusca  which when cut and polished are very beautiful He particularly mentions a dining table made of the latter which repre∣sents the exact figure of a fish  With regard to these  exact figures  of animals and other objects which we meet with both in stone and wood I cannot say I should value them much as objects of beauty They may be whimsical and curious but in my opinion the roots and veins of wood and stone are much more beautiful when they are wreathed in different fantastic forms than when they  seem to aim  at any  exact figures  In the former case they leave the imagination at liberty to play among them which is always a pleasing exercise to it in the latter they are at best awkward and  unnatural likenesses which often disgust the picturesque eye and always please it less than following it's own fancy and picking out resemblances of it's own  Another curiosity in the ash which is likewise of the picturesque kind is a sort of excrescence which is sometimes found on a leading branch called a  wreathed fascia  The fasciated branch is twisted and curled in a very beautiful form which form it probably takes as Dr Plot supposes from too quick an ascent of the sap  See Nat hist Oxf ch vi sec  or as other naturalists imagine from the puncture of some insect in the tender twig which diverts the sap from it's usual channel and makes the branch monstrous The wreathed fascia is sometimes found in other wood in the willow parti∣cularly and in the holly but most com∣monly is an excrescence of the ash I have a fasciated branch of ash found in the woods of Beaulieu in newforest which is most elegantly twisted in the form of a crozier I have seen a holly also twisted like a ram's  horn We have this appearance sometimes in asparagus  It is not uncommon for the seeds of trees and particularly of the ash to seize on some faulty part of a neighbouring trunk and there strike root Dr Plot  See Nat hist Oxf ch vi sec  speaks of a piece of vegetable violence of this kind which is rather extraordinary An ashkey rooting itself on a decayed willow and finding as it increased a deficiency of nourish∣ment in the mother plant it began to insinuate it's fibres by degrees through the trunk of the willow into the earth There receiving an additional recruit it began to thrive and expand itself to such a size that it burst the willow in pieces which fell away from it and what was before the root of the ash being now exposed to the air became the solid trunk of a vigorous tree  As a beautiful variety of the tree we are now examining the  mountainash  often called the  roan tree  should be mentioned It's name denotes the place of it's usual residence Inured to cold and rugged scenes it is the  hardy inhabitant of the northern parts of this island Sometimes it is found in softer climes but there it generally discovers by it's stunted growth that it does not occupy the situation it loves  In ancient days when superstition held that place in society which dissipation and impiety now hold the mountainash was considered as an object of great veneration Often at this day a stump of it is found in some old burying place or near the circle of a Druid temple whose rites it formerly invested with it's sacred shade It's chief merit now consists in being the ornament of landscape In the Scotish highlands it becomes a considerable tree There on some rocky mountain covered with dark pines and waving birch which cast a solemn gloom over the lake below a few mountainashes joining in a clump and mixing with them have a fine effect In summer the light green tint of their foliage and in autumn the glowing berries which hang clustering upon them contrast beauti∣fully with the deeper green of the pines and if they are happily blended and not in too large a proportion they add some of the most picturesque furniture with which  the sides of those rugged mountains are in∣vested  After the oak and ash we examine the elm The oak and the ash have each a distinct character The massy form of the one di∣viding into abrupt twisting irregular limbs yet compact in it's foliage and the easy sweep of the other the simplicity of it's branches and the looseness of it's hanging leaves cha∣racterize both these trees with so much pre∣cision that at any distance at which the eye can distinguish the form it may also distin∣guish the difference The elm has not so dis∣tinct a character It partakes so much of the oak that when it is rough and old it may easily at a little distance be mistaken for one tho the oak I mean such an oak as is strongly marked with it's peculiar cha∣racter can never be mistaken for the elm This is certainly a defect in the elm for strong characters are a great source of pic∣turesque beauty  This defect however appears chiefly in the skeleton of the elm In full foliage it's character is better marked No tree is better  adapted to receive grand masses of light In this respect it is superior both to the oak and the ash Nor is it's foliage shadowing as it is of the heavy kind It's leaves are small and this gives it a natural lightness it commonly hangs loosely and is in general very picturesque  The elm naturally grows upright and when it meets with a soil it loves rises higher than the generality of trees and after it has assumed the dignity and hoary roughness of age few of it's forestbrethren tho properly speaking it is not a forester excel it in gran∣deur and beauty  The elm is the first tree that salutes the early spring with it's light and cheerful green a tint which contrasts agreeably with the oak whose early leaf has generally more of the olivecast We see them sometimes in fine harmony together about the end of april and the beginning of may We often also see the elm planted with the Scotch fir In the spring it's light green is very discordant with the gloomy hue of it's companion but as the year advances the elmleaf takes a darker tint and unites in harmony with the firIn autumn also the yellow leaf of  the elm mixes as kindly with the orange of the beech the ocher of the oak and many of the other fading hues of the wood  A species of this tree called the wichelm is perhaps generally more picturesque than the common sort as it hangs more negligently tho at the same time with this negligence it loses in a good degree that happy surface for catching masses of light which we admire in the common elm We observe also when we see this tree in company with the common elm that it's bark is some∣what of a lighter hue The wichelm is a native of Scotland where it is found not only in the plains and vallies of the low∣lands but is hardy enough to climb the steeps and flourish in the remotest highlands tho it does not attain in those climates the size which it attains in England Naturalists suppose the wichelm to be the only species of this tree which is indigenous to our island  There is another variety also of this tree called the weeping elm Whether it's timber is less useful or it is propagated with greater difficulty I know not but I have rarely met with it The finest of this species I have seen grow in St John's walks at Cambridge An  eye accustomed to the tree will easily perceive that it's branches are more pensile and it's leaves of smaller dimensions than those of the common elm  An old elm which grew formerly in the grove at Magdalen college in Oxford was by some accident disbarked entirely round A malady of this kind is generally reckoned fatal to all the vegetable race But this tree flourished after it as well as any tree in the grove The probable reasons of this uncom∣mon appearance are given us by the learned author of the natural history of Oxfordshire in a long philosophical enquiry which may be found in the th page of that work I have heard also but I know not on what authority of another disbarked elm growing at this time vigorously at Kensington  The oak the ash and the elm are com∣monly dignified in our English woods as a distinct class by the title of  timbertrees  But the picturesque eye scorns the narrow concep∣tions of a timbermerchant and with equal complacency takes in the whole offspring of the wood tho it must be owned the three  species already characterized are both the most useful and the most picturesque We esteem it fortunate when the idea of picturesque beauty coincides with that of utility The two ideas are often at variance When they are so we cannot help it but must feel it with regret  After timber trees the beech deserves our notice Some indeed rank the beech among timbertrees but I believe in general it does not find that respect as it's wood is of a soft spungy nature sappy and alluring to the worm  In point of picturesque beauty I am not inclined to rank the beech much higher than in point of utility It's skeleton compared with that of the trees we have just examined is very deficient It's trunk we allow is often highly picturesque It is studded with bold knobs and projections and has sometimes a sort of irregular fluting about it which is very characteristic It has another peculiarity also which is sometimes pleasing that of a number of stems arising from the root The bark too wears often a pleasant hue It is naturally of a dingy olive but it is always overspread in patches with a variety of  mosses and lychens which are commonly of a lighter tint in the upper parts and of a deep velvetgreen towards the root It's smoothness also contrasts agreeably with these rougher appendages No bark tempts the lover so much to make it the depository of his mistress's name It conveys a happy emblem  crescent illae crescetis amores  But having praised the trunk we can praise no other part of the skeleton The branches are fantastically wreathed and disproportioned twining awkwardly among each other and running often into long unvaried lines without any of that strength and firmness which we admire in the oak or of that easy simplicity which pleases in the ash in short we rarely see a beech well ramified In full leaf it is equally unpleasing it has the appearance of an overgrown bush Virgil indeed was right in chusing the beech for it's shade No tree forms so complete a roof If you wish either for shade or shelter you will find it best  patulae sub tegmine fagi  This bushiness gives a great heaviness to the tree which is always a deformity What  lightness it has disgusts You will some∣times see a light branch issuing from a heavy mass and tho such pendent branches are often beautiful in themselves they are seldom in harmony with the tree They distinguish however it's character which will be seen best by comparing it with the elm The elm forms a rounder the beech a more pointed foliage But the former is always in harmony with itself  Sometimes however we see in beeches of happy composition the foliage falling in large flocks or layers elegantly determined between which the shadows have a very forcible effect especially when the tree is strongly illumined On the whole however the massy fullgrown luxuriant beech is rather a displeasing tree It is made up of littlenesses seldom exhibiting those tufted cups or hollow dark recesses which dispart the several grand branches of the more beautiful kinds of trees  Contrary to the general nature of trees the beech is most pleasing in it's juvenile state as it has not yet acquired that heaviness which is it's most faulty distinction A light airy young beech with it's spiry branches hang∣ing as I have just described them in easy  forms is often beautiful I have seen also the forestbeech in a dry hungry soil preserve the lightness of youth in the matu∣rity of age  After all however we mean not to repudiate even the heavy luxuriant beech in picturesque composition It has sometimes it's beauty and oftener it's use In distance it preserves the depth of the forest  We call the forest  deep  when we cannot see through it so that at a distance a thin wood of beeches will have the effect of a large one  and even on the spot in contrast it is frequently a choice accompaniment In the corner of a landscape when we want a thick heavy tree or part of one at least which is often necessary nothing answers our purpose like the beech But at present we are not considering the beech in composition but only as an individual and in this light it is in which we chiefly con∣ceive it as an object of disapprobation  We should not conclude our remarks on the beech without mentioning it's autumnal hues In this respect it is often beautiful Sometimes it is dressed in modest brown but generally in glowing orange and in both  dresses it's harmony with the grove is plea∣sing About the end of september when the leaf begins to change it makes a happy contrast with the oak whose foliage is yet verdant Some of the finest oppositions of tint which perhaps the forest can furnish arise from the union of oak and beech We often see a wonderful effect from this combi∣nation And yet accommodating as it's leaf is in landscape on handling it feels as if it were fabricated with metallic rigour In it's autumnal state it almost crackles  Leni crepitabat bractea vento  For this reason I suppose as it's rigour gives it an elastic quality the common people in France and Switzerland use it for their beds  I have dwelt the longer on the beech as notwithstanding my severity it is a tree of picturesque fame and I did not chuse to condemn without giving my reasons It has acquired it's reputation I suppose chiefly from it's having a peculiar character and this with all it's defects it certainly has I may add also that if objects receive merit from their associated as well as from their intrinsic qualities the dry soil and salubrious air in  which the beech generally flourishes give it a high degree of estimation  Very nearly allied to the beech in a pic∣turesque light is the hornbeam It grows like it when it is suffered to grow but it is generally seen only in clipped hedges where it is very obedient to the knife and with a little care will never presume to appear out of form It's wood is white tough and flexible  The deciduous trees which I have des∣cribed hold certainly the first rank I shall however touch on a few others which tho neither so beautiful nor so characteristic are however worth the notice of the picturesque eye  Among these the first place is due to two noble trees of the same kind both naturalized in Englandtho from different extremes of the globethe  occidental  and the  oriental  plane  The  occidental  plane is a native of America but has long been known in England where it attains a considerable growth tho inferior  no doubt to what it attains in it's native soil It's stem is very picturesque It is smooth and of a light ashcolour and has the pro∣perty of throwing off it's bark in scales thus naturally cleansing itself at least it's larger boughs from moss and other parasitical incumbrances This would be no recom∣mendation of it in a picturesque light if the removal of these incumbrances did not sub∣stitute as great a beauty in their room These scales are very irregular falling off sometimes in one part and sometimes in another and as the underbark is immediately after it's exco∣riation of a lighter hue than the upper it offers to the pencil those smart touches which have so much effect in painting These flakes however would be more beautiful if they fell off in a circular form instead of a perpendi∣cular one They would correspond and unite better with the circular form of the bole  No tree forms a more pleasing shade than the occidental plane It is fullleafed and it's leaf is large smooth of a fine texture and seldom injured by insects It's lower branches shooting horizontally soon take a direction to the ground and the spray seems more sedulous than that of any tree we have by twisting  about in various forms to fill up every little vacuity with shade At the same time it must be owned the twisting of it's branches is a disadvantage to this tree as we have just observed it is to the beech when it is stripped of it's leaves and reduced to a skeletonIt has not the natural appearance which the spray of the oak and that of many other trees discovers in winter Nor indeed does it's foliage from the largeness of the leaf and the mode of it's growth make the most picturesque appearance in summerOne of the finest occidental planes I am acquainted with stands in my own garden at Vicar'shill where it's boughs feathering to the ground form a canopy of above fifty feet in diameter  The  oriental  plane is a tree nearly of the same kind only it's leaf is more palmated nor has it so great a disposition to overshadow the ground as the occidental plane At least I never saw any in our climate form so noble a shade tho in the east it is esteemed among the most shady and most magnificent of trees Lady Craven speaks of some she saw in the Turkish dominions of a size so gigantic that  the largest trees we have in England placed near them would appear she says only like broomsticks  Letter    This tree I believe sheds it's bark like the occidental plane and the catkins of both are round spicated balls about the size of wal∣nuts and fastened together often in pairs like chainshot From this circumstance the occidental plane is called in America the buttontree It flourishes there commonly by the sides of creeks and rivers and is of quick growth The oriental plane I believe loves the same soil at least both trees in England are fond of moist ground  Kempfer tells us  See p  that at Jedo the capital of Japan he found a species of this tree the leaves of which were beautifully variegated like the tricolor with red green and yellow An appearance of this kind is so contrary to nature's usual mode of colouring the leaves of foresttrees that I should rather suspect Kempfer saw it either when the leaves were in the wane or blasted or in some other unnatural state  I may add with regard to the occidental plane and indeed I believe with regard to both the trees of this species that their sum∣mer leaf wears so light a hue as to mix ill with the foliage of the oak the elm and other trees I have seen them on the skirts of a plantation forming during the summer a disagreeable spot In autumn their leaves receive a mellow tint which harmonizes very well with the waning colour of the wood  The poplar tribe shall be considered next They are numerous and some of them I have thought picturesque They are at least stately trees but their thin quivering foliage is neither adapted to catch masses of light like that of the elm nor has it the hanging lightness of the ash It's chief use in landscape is to mix as a variety in contrast with other trees  Within these few years the Lombardypoplar which graces the banks of the Po has been much introduced in English planta∣tations It seems to like a British soil and it's youth is promising but I have never seen it in full maturity It's conic form as  a deciduous tree is peculiar Among ever∣greens we find the same character in the cy∣press and both trees in many situations have a good effect The cypress often among the ruins of ancient Rome breaks the re∣gularity of a wall or a pediment by it's conic form and the poplar on the banks of the Po no doubt has the same effect among it's deciduous brethren by forming the apex of a clump tho I have been told that in it's age it loses it's shape in some degree and spreads more into a head The oldest poplars of this kind I have seen are at Blenheim They are not old trees but are very tall and I believe still preserve their spiry form  One beauty the Italian poplar possesses which is almost peculiar to itself and that is the waving line it forms when agitated by wind Most trees in this circumstance are partially agitated One side is at rest while the other is in motion But the Italian poplar waves in one simple sweep from the top to the bottom like an ostrichfeather on a lady's head All the branches coin∣cide in the motion and the least blast makes an impression upon it when other  trees are at rest I have mentioned among the adventitious beauties of trees their  susceptibility of motion  See page  but in painting I know not that I should represent any kind of motion in a tree except that of a violent storm When the blast continues for some time when the black heavens are in unison with it and help to tell the story an oak straining in the wind is an object of picturesque beauty But when the gentle breeze pressing upon the quivering poplar bends it only in easy motion while a serene sky indicates the heavens to be at peace there is nothing to act in concert with the motion of the tree it seems to have taken it's form from the influence of a sea air or some other malign impression and exhibiting an unnatural ap∣pearance disgustsOne thing more I should mention with regard to the Italian poplar which is that altho it sometimes has a good effect when standing single it generally has a better when two or three are planted in a clump  The walnut is not an unpicturesque tree The warm russet hue of it's young foliage  makes a pleasing variety among the vivid green of other trees about the end of may and the same variety is maintained in summer by the contrast of it's yellowish hue when mixed in any quantity with trees of a darker tint but it opens it's leaves so late and drops them so early that it cannot long be in harmony with the grove It stands best alone and the early loss of it's foliage is of the less consequence as it's ramification is generally beautiful  The lime is an elegant tree where it is suffered to grow at large but we generally see it in strait bondage clipped into shape and forming the sides of avenues and vistas In it's best state however it is not very pic∣turesque It has a uniformity of surface without any of those breaks and hollows which the foliage of the most pictures∣que trees presents and which is always beautifulOne circumstance should recom∣mend the lime to all lovers of the imitative arts No wood is so easily formed under the carver's chissel It is the wood which the ingenious Gibbon used after making trial of  several kinds as the most proper for that curious sculpture which adorns some of the old houses of our nobility  The maple is an uncommon tree tho a common bush It's wood is of little value and it is therefore rarely suffered to increase We seldom see it employed in any nobler ser∣vice than in filling up it's part in a hedge in company with thorns and briars and other ditch trumpery Yet the ancients held it in great repute Pliny  See Plin Nat hist lib xvi ch  speaks as highly of the knobs and excrescences of this tree called the  brusca  and  mollusca  as Dr Plot does of those of the ash  See page see also Plin Nat hist lib xiii ch  The veins of these excrescences in the maple Pliny tells us were so variegated that they exceeded the beauty of any other wood even of the citron tho the citron was in such repute at Rome that Cicero who was neither rich nor expensive was tempted to give ten  thousand sesterces for a citron table The brusca and mollusca Pliny adds were rarely of size sufficient for the larger species of fur∣niture but in all smaller cabinet work they were inestimable But indeed the whole tree was esteemed by the ancients on account of it's variegated wood In Ovid we find it thus celebrated  acerque coloribus impar  Met lib x v    How far at this day it may be valued for cabinet work I know not I have here and there seen boxes and other little things made of it which I have thought very beautiful  In the few instances I have met with of this tree in a state of maturity it's form has appeared picturesque It is not unlike the oak only it is more bushy and it's branches closer and more compact One of the largest maples I have seen stands in the churchyard of Boldre in the Newforest but I have not met with specimens enough of this tree to form an opinion of it's general character  The great maple commonly called the  sycamore  is a grander and nobler tree than the smaller maple but it wants it's elegance it is coarse in proportion to it's bulk It forms however an impenetrable shade and often receives wellcontrasted masses of light It's bark has not the furrowed roughness of the oak but it has a species of roughness very picturesque In itself it is smooth but it peels off in large flakes like the planes to which in other respects it bears a near alliance leaving patches of different hues seams and cracks which are often pic∣turesque  The chesnut in maturity and perfection is a noble tree and grows not unlike the oak It's ramification is more straggling but it is easy and it's foliage loose This is the tree which graces the landscapes of Salvator Rosa In the mountains of Calabria where Salvator painted the chesnut flourished There he studied it in all it's forms breaking and dis∣posing it in a thousand beautiful shapes as  the exigences of his composition required I have heard indeed that it is naturally brittle and liable to be shattered by winds which might be one reason for Salvator's attachment to itBut altho I have many times seen the chesnut in England old enough to be in a fruitbearing state yet I have seldom seen it in a state of full picturesque maturity The best I have seen stand on the banks of the Tamer in Cornwall at an old house belong∣ing to the Edgecumbe family I have heard also that at Beechworthcastle in Surry there are not fewer than seventy or eighty chesnuts measuring from twelve to eighteen or twenty feet in girth and some of them of very pic∣turesque form but I saw them only at a distance In Kent also the chesnut is fre∣quently found  It is said indeed that this tree was once very common in England and that beams of it are often seen at this day in churches and old houses In the belfry particularly of the church at Sutton near Mitcham in Surry I have seen beams which are like oak yet plainly appear to be of a different kind of timber and are supposed to be chesnut I have often heard also that the timber of the  old houses of London was of the same kind Whether the chesnut was ever indigenous to this country seems to be matter of much specu∣lation As it's timber is said to be serviceable and as it's fruit tho rarely of perfect growth in this climate might however be of some use we are at a loss to conceive if it had once gotten footing amongst us how it should ever be as it now is almost totally extermi∣nated Some have endeavoured to account for this by shewing that it is not so good a timbertree as is supposed for it decays at the heart and will continue decaying till it become merely a shell and for this reason it has been less sought after and encouraged How far this may be true I know not I rather suspect it's truth Some years ago Mr Daines Barrington read a paper to the royal society in which he endeavoured to prove that the chesnut was not indigenous to this country Dr Ducarel answered him and alleged from ancient records and other evi∣denees that chesnut formerly abounded in many woody scenes in England and was certainly a native of this island Among the ancient records to which he appeals one is dated in the time of Henry II It is a deed  of gift from that prince to Flexley abbey of the tythe of all his chesnuts in the forest of Dean  See four letters on chesnuttrees read before the royal society    The horsechesnut is a heavy disagreeable tree It forms it's foliage generally in a round mass with little appearance of those breaks which we have so often admired and which contribute to give an airiness and lightness at least a richness and variety to the whole mass of foliage This tree is however chiefly admired for it's flower which  in itself  is beau∣tiful but the whole tree together in flower is a glaring object totally unharmonious and unpicturesque In some situations indeed and among a profusion of other wood a single chesnut or two in bloom may be beautiful As it forms an admirable shade it may be of use too in thickening distant scenery or in skreening an object at hand for there is no species of foliage however heavy nor any species of bloom however glaring which may  not be brought by some proper contrast to produce a good effect  The weeping willow is a very picturesque tree It is a perfect contrast to what we have just observed of the Lombardy poplar The light airy spray of the poplar rises perpendi∣cularly That of the weeping willow is pendent The shape of it's leaf is conformable to the pensile character of the tree and it's spray which is still lighter than that of the poplar is more easily put into motion by a breath of air The weeping willow however is not adapted to sublime subjects We wish it not to skreen the broken buttresses and Gothic windows of an abbey nor to overshadow the battlements of a ruined castle These offices it resigns to the oak whose dignity can support them The weeping willow seeks a humbler scenesome romantic footpath bridge which it half concealsor some glassy pool over which it hangs it's streaming foliage  and dip  It's pendent boughs stooping as if to drink  In these situations it appears in character and of course to advantageI have heard indeed that the weeping willow is not naturally an aquatic plant but it's being commonly be∣lieved to be so is ground enough to establish it as such in landscape at least tho not in botany  The weeping willow is the only one of it's tribe that is beautiful Botanists I believe enumerate sixteen species of the willow But tho I have seen some of them attain a very remarkable size yet in general they are trees of straggling ramification and without any of that elegant streaming form which we admire in the weep∣ing willow I should rarely therefore advise their use in artificial landscape except as pol∣lards to characterize a marshy country or to mark in a second distance the winding banks of a heavy lowsunk river which could not otherwise be noticed Some willows indeed I have thought beautiful and fit to appear in the decoration of any rural scene The kind I have most admired has a small narrow leaf and wears a pleasant light sea green tint which mixes agreeably with foliage of a deeper hue I am not acquainted with the botanical  name of this species but I believe the botanists call it the  salix alba  The withy or  salix fragilis  is the most inconsiderable of it's tribe Like others of it's kindred it will grow in any soil tho it loves a moist one It is of little value in landscape and yet there is something beauti∣ful in it's silvercoated catkins which open as the year advances into elegant hanging tufts and when the tree is large and in full bloom make a beautiful variety among the early productions of the spring  Nearly related to the willow tribe tho in nature rather than in form is the  alder  They both love a low moist soil and frequent the banks of rivers tho it may be alledged in favour of both that they will flourish in the poorest forest swamps where nothing else will grow The alder is however the more picturesque tree both in it's ramification and in it's foliage perhaps indeed it is the most picturesque of any of the aquatic tribe except the weeping willow He who would see the  alder in perfection must follow the banks of the Mole in Surry through the sweet vales of Dorking and Mickleham into the groves of Esher The Mole indeed is far from being a beautiful river it is a silent and sluggish stream But what beauty it has it owes greatly to the alder which every where fringes it's meadows and in many places forms very pleasing scenes especially in the vale between Boxhill and the high grounds of Norburypark  Some of the largest alders we have in England grow in the bishop of Durham's park at BishopAukland The generality of trees acquire picturesque beauty by age but it is not often that they are suffered to attain this picturesque period Some use is commonly found for them long before that time The oak falls for the greater purposes of man and the alder is ready to supply a variety of his smaller wants An old tree therefore of any kind is a curiosity and even an alder such as those at BishopAukland when dignified by age makes a respectable figure  The birch may have several varieties with which I am not acquainted The most com∣mon species of it in England are the black and the white The former is a native of Canada the latter of Britain Of the white birch there is a very beautiful variety some∣times called the ladybirch or the weepingbirch It's spray being slenderer and longer than the common sort forms an elegant pensile foliage like the weeping willow and like it is put in motion by the least breath of air When agitated it is well adapted to characterize a storm or to perform any office in landscape which is expected from the weeping willow  The stem of the birch is generally marked with brown yellow and silvery touches which are peculiarly picturesque as they are characteristic objects of imitation for the pencil and as they contrast agreeably with the dark green hue of the foliage But only the stem and larger branches have this varied colouring the spray is of a deep brown which is the colour too of the larger branches where the external rind is peeled off As  the birch grows old it's bark becomes rough and furrowed It loses all it's varied tints and assumes a uniform ferruginous hue  The bark of this tree has the property perhaps peculiar to itself of being more firm and durable than the wood it invests Of this the peasants of Sweden Lapland and other northern countries where birch grows in abundance take the advantage and shaping it like tiles cover their houses with itHow very durable it is we have a remarkable instance in Monsieur Maupertuis's travels When that philosopher traversed Lap∣land to measure a degree of latitude he was obliged to pass through vast forests consisting intirely of birch The soil in some parts of these wastes being very shallow or very loose the trees had not a sufficient footing for their roots and became an easy prey to winds In these places Maupertuis found as many trees blown down as standing He examined several of them and was surprized to see that in such as had lain long the sub∣tance of the wood was intirely gone but the bark remained a hollow trunk without any signs of decay  Among elegant pendent trees the acacia should not be forgotten tho the acacia which we have in England called by the botanist the  robinia  is perhaps only a poor substitute of this plant in it's greatest per∣fection And yet even ours when we have it full grown is often a very beautiful tree whether it feathers to the ground as it some∣times does or whether it is adorned with a light foliage hanging from the stem But it's beauty is very frail It is of all trees the least able to endure the blast In some sheltered spot it may ornament a garden but it is by no means qualified to adorn a country It's wood is of so brittle a texture especially when it is encumbered with a weight of foliage that you can never depend upon it's aid in filling up the part you wish The branch you admire today may be demolished to∣morrow The misfortune is the acacia is not one of those grand objects like the oak whose dignity is often increased by ruin It depends on it's  beauty  rather than on it's  grandeur  which is a quality much more liable to injuryI may add however in it's favour that if it be easily injured it repairs  the injury more quickly than any other tree Few trees make so rapid a growth  In one of the memoirs published by the agricultural society at Paris the virtues of this tree are highly extolled It's shade en∣courages the growth of grass It's roots are so tenacious of the soil and shoot up such groves of suckers that when planted on the banks of rivers it contributes exceedingly to fix them as barriers against the incursions of the stream Acaciastakes too are as durable as those of any wood In NorthAmerica this tree is much valued in proof of which the memorialist tells a story of a farmer in Longisland who planted an ordinary field of fourteen acres with suckers of this plant in the year of his marriage as a portion for his children His eldest son married at twentytwo On this occasion the farmer cut about three hundred pounds worth of timber out of his acacia wood which he gave his son to buy a settlement in Lancaster county Three years after he did as much for a daughter And thus he provided for his whole family the wood in the mean time repairing by suckers all the losses it received  I shall conclude my account of deciduous trees with the larch which is a kind of con∣necting species between them and the race of evergreens Tho it sheds it's leaf with the former it bears a cone is resinous and ramifies like the latter It claims the Alps and Apennines for it's native country where it thrives in higher regions of the air than any tree of it's consequence is known to do hanging over rocks and precipices which have never been visited by human feet Often it is felled by the alpine peasant and thrown athwart some yawning chasm where it affords a tremendous passage from cliff to cliff while the cataract roaring many fathoms below is seen only in surges of rising vapour  In ancient times the larch was employed in still more arduous service When Hannibal laid the cliffs bare and heaped up piles of timber to melt the rocks so Livy tells us the larch was his fuel it's unctuous sides soon spread the flame and as the gloom of evening came on the appendages of a nu∣merous host elephants and floating banners  and gleaming arms formed terrific images through the night while the lofty summits of the Alps were illumined far and wide  Strabo speaks of alpine trees which most probably were larches of a very great size Many of them he says would measure eight feet in diameter  Lib iv p  And at this day masts of single larches measuring from one hundred and ten to one hundred and twenty feet in length have been floated from Valais through the lake of Geneva and down the Rhone to Toulon tho I have heard they are in no great esteem among the contractors for the French dockyards  In the memoirs of the royal society of agriculture at Paris for the year there is an essay by M le President de la Tour d'Aigues on the culture of the larch in which it is celebrated as one of the most useful of all timbertrees He tells us that in his own garden he has rails which were put up in the year partly of oak and partly of larch The former he says have yielded to time but the latter are still  sound And in his castle of Tour d'Aigues he has larchen beams of twenty inches square which are sound tho above two hundred years old The finest trees he knows of this kind grow in some parts of Dauphiny and in the forest of Baye in Provence where there are larches he tells us which two men cannot fathomI have often heard that old dry larch will take such a polish as to become almost transparent and that in this state it may be wrought into very beautiful wain∣scotIn my encomium of the larch I must not omit that the old painters used it more than any other wood to paint on before the use of canvas became general Many of Raphael's pictures are painted on boards of larch  The larch we have in England compared with the larch of the Alps is a diminutive plant It is little more than the puny in∣habitant of a garden or the embellishment of some trifling artificial scene The cha∣racters of grand and noble seldom belong to it It is however an elegant tree tho in our soil at least too formal in it's growth Among it's native steeps it's form no doubt is fully picturesque when the storms  of many a century have shattered it's equal sides and given contrast and variety to it's boughs  From deciduous trees we proceed to ever∣greensOf these the cedar of Lebanon claims our first notice To it preeminence belongs not only on account of it's own dignity but on account of the respectable mention which is every where made of it in scripture Solomon spake of trees  from the cedar of Lebanon to the byssop that springeth out of the wall  that is from the greatest to the least The eastern writers are indeed the prin∣cipal sources from which we are to obtain the true character of the cedar as it is an eastern tree In the sacred writers particu∣larly we are presented with many noble images drawn from it's several qualities It is ge∣nerally employed by the prophets to express strength power and longevity The strength of the cedar is used as an emblem to express the power even of Jehovah  The voice of the Lord breaketh the cedars of Lebanon  David characterizes the palmtree and the cedar together both very strongly  The righteous  shall flourish like a palmtree and spread abroad like a cedar of Lebanon  The  flourishing  head of the palm and the  spreading abroad  of the cedar are equally characteristic  But the prophet Ezekiel hath given us the fullest description of the cedar  "Behold the Assyrian was a cedar in Lebanon with fair branches and with a shadowing shroud and of an high stature and his top was among the thick boughs His boughs were multiplied and his branches be∣came long The fir trees were not like his boughs nor the chesnut trees like his branches nor any tree in the garden of God like unto him in beauty"  Ezek xxxi  In this description two of the principal characteristics of the cedar are marked  The first is the multiplicity and length of his branches Few trees divide so many fair branches from the main stem or spread over so large a compass of ground  His boughs are multiplied  as Ezekiel says and  his branches became long  which David calls  spreading abroad  The second characteristic is what Ezekiel with great beauty and aptness calls his  sha∣dowing shroud  No tree in the forest is more remarkable than the cedar for it's closewoven leafy canopy  Ezekiel's cedar is marked as a tree of full and perfect growth from the circumstance of it's top being  among the thick boughs  Almost every young tree and particularly every young cedar has what is called a leading branch or two which continue spiring above the rest till the tree has at∣tained it's full size then the tree becomes in the language of the nurseryman  clumpheaded  but in the language of eastern sub∣limity it's top is among  the thick boughs  that is no distinction of any spiry head or leading branch appears the head and the branches are all mixed together This is generally in all trees the state in which they are most perfect and most beautiful  But tho Ezekiel hath given us this accurate description of the cedar he hath left it's strength which is it's chief characteristic untouched But the reason is evident The cedar is here introduced as an emblem of Assyria which tho vast and widespreading  and come to full maturity was in fact on the eve of destruction  Strength  therefore was the last idea which the prophet wished to suggest Strength is a relative term com∣pared with opposition The Assyrian was strong compared with the powers on earth but weak compared with the arm of pro∣vidence which brought him to destruction So his type the cedar was stronger than any of the trees of the forest but weak in comparison with the ax which cut him off and left him as the prophet expresses the vastness of his ruin  spread upon the mountains and in the vallies while the nations shook at the sound of his fall  Such is the grandeur and form of the cedar of Lebanon It's mantling foliage  or shadowing shroud  as Ezekiel calls it is it's greatest beauty which arises from the hori∣zontal growth of it's branches forming a kind of sweeping irregular penthouse And when to the idea of beauty that of strength is added by the piramidal form of the stem and the robustness of the limbs the tree is complete in all it's beauty and majesty  In these climates indeed we cannot expect to see the cedar in such perfection The  forest of Lebanon is perhaps the only part of the world where it's growth is perfect yet we may in some degree conceive it's beauty and majesty from the paltry resemblances of it at this distance from it's native soil In it's  youth  it is often with us a vigorous thriving plant and if the leading branch is not bound to a pole as many people deform their cedars but left to take it's natural course and guide the stem after it in some irregular waving line it is often an object of great beauty But in it's  maturer age  the beauty of the English cedar is generally gone it becomes shrivelled deformed and stunted it's body increases but it's limbs shrink and wither Thus it never gives us it's two leading qualities together In it's youth we have some idea of it's beauty without it's strength and in it's advanced age we have some idea of it's strength without it's beauty the imagination therefore by joining together the two different periods of it's age in this climate may form some conception of the grandeur of the cedar in it's own climate where it's strength and beauty are united The best specimen of this tree I ever saw in England was at Hillington near  Uxbridge The perpendicular height of it was fifty three feet it's horizontal expanse ninety six and it's girth fifteen and a half When I saw it in it was about one hundred and eighteen years of age and being then completely clumpheaded it was a very noble and picturesque treeIn the high winds about the beginning of the year this noble cedar was blown down It's stem when cut was five feet in diameter  After the cedar the stonepine deserves our notice It is not indigenous to our soil but like the cedar it is in some degree naturalized tho in England it is rarely more than a puny halfformed resemblance of the Italian pine The soft clime of Italy alone gives birth to the true picturesque pine There it always suggests ideas of broken por∣ticos Ionic pillars triumphal arches frag∣ments of old temples and a variety of classic ruins which in Italian landscape it commonly adorns  The stone pine promises little in it's in∣fancy in point of picturesque beauty It does  not like most of the firspecies give an early indication of it's future form In it's youth it is dwarfish and roundheaded with a short stem and has rather the shape of a fullgrown bush than of an increasing treeAs it grows older it does not soon deposit it's formal shape It is long a bush tho somewhat more irregular and with a longer stemBut as it attains maturity it's pic∣turesque form increases fast It's lengthening stem assumes commonly an easy sweep It seldom indeed deviates much from a strait line but that gentle deviation is very graceful and above all other lines difficult to imitate If accidentally either the stem or any of the larger branches take a larger sweep than usual that sweep seldom fails to be gracefulIt is also among the beauties of the stonepine that as the lateral branches decay they leave gene∣rally stumps which standing out in various parts of the stem break the continuity of it's lines  The bark is smoother than that of any other tree of the pinekind except the Wey∣mouth tho we do not esteem this among it's picturesque beauties It's hue however which is warm and reddish has a good effect  and it obtains a kind of roughness by peeling off in patches  The foliage of the stonepine is as beautiful as the stem It's colour is a deep warm green and it's form instead of breaking into acute angles like many of the pinerace is moulded into a flowing line by an assemblage of small masses  As age comes on it's round clumphead becomes more flat spreading itself into a canopy which is a form equally becoming And yet I doubt whether any resinous tree ever attains that picturesque beauty in age which we admire so much in the oak The oak continues long vigorous in his branches tho his trunk decays but the resinous tree I believe decays more equally through all it's parts and in age oftener presents the idea of vegetable decrepitude than of the stout remains of a vigorous constitution And yet in many circumstances even in this state it may be an object of picturesque notice  Thus we see in the form of the stonepine what beauty may result from a tree with a round head and without lateral branches which requires indeed a good example to prove When we look at an ash or an elm from  which the lateral branches have been stripped as is the practice in some countries we are apt to think that no tree with a head placed on a long stem can be beautiful yet in nature's hands which can mould so many forms of beauty it may easily be effected Nature herself however does not always follow the rules of picturesque beauty in the produc∣tion of this kind of object The cabbagetree I suppose is as ugly as the stone pine is picturesqueThe best specimen of the stonepine I ever saw grows in the botanical garden at Oxford  The most beautiful succedaneum of the stonepine which these climates afford is the pinaster The sweep of it's stem is similar it's broken lateral branches likewise and it's clumphead Both trees also are equally irregular in their growth but the pinaster is perhaps more picturesque in the roughness of it's darkgrey bark On no trees have I seen broader and better varied masses of light and shade but the closeness of the pinaster's foliage makes it's head sometimes too heavy  The cluster pine also is a beautiful tree and approaches perhaps as near the stonepine as the pinaster does But I scarce recollect ever to have seen it in a state of full maturity and perfection If we may judge however from a growth of thirty or forty years at which age I have often seen it it shoots in so wild and irregular a manner so thick rich and bushy that we may easily conceive how picturesque a plant it must be in a state of full perfection It's cones too which it bears in clusters from whence it derives it's name are a great ornament to it In com∣position indeed such minutiae are of little value but we are now considering trees as individuals  The Weymouthpine has very little pictu∣resque beauty to recommend it It is admired for it's polished bark The painter's eye pays little attention to so trivial a cir∣cumstance even when the tree is considered as a single object Nay it's polished bark rather depreciates it's value for the picturesque eye dwells with more pleasure on rough sur∣faces  than on smooth it sees more richness in them and more variety But we object chiefly to the Weymouthpine on account of the regularity of it's stem and the meagreness of it's foliage It's stem rises with perpen∣dicular exactness it rarely varies and it's branches issue with equal formality from it's sides It's foliage too is thin and wants both richness and effectIf I were speaking indeed of this tree in composition I might add that it may often appear to great advan∣tage in a plantation Contrast we know produces beauty even from deformity itself Opposed therefore to the wildness of other trees the regularity of the Weymouthpine may have it's beauty It's formality may be concealed A few of it's branches hang∣ing from a mass of heavier foliage may appear light and feathery while it's spiry head may often form an agreeable apex to a clump  Having thus considered the pinerace we next take a view of a tribe nearly allied to them that of firs In what the distinction between these two tribes consists tho I apprehend  it consists in little more than in that between genus and species the botanist will explain I profess myself an observer only of outward characters What we usually call the Scotch fir appears to me to approach nearer the pine in it's manner of growth than it does any of it's nominal class As this tree therefore seems to be of ambiguous nature at least as to it's form I shall place it herethat is imme∣diately after the pines and before the firs that it may with facility join one party or the other as the reader's botanical principles incline  The Scotch fir in perfection I think a very picturesque tree tho we have little idea of it's beauty It is generally treated with great contempt It is a hardy plant and therefore put to every servile office If you wish to skreen your house from the south west wind plant Scotch firs and plant them close and thick If you want to shelter a nursery of young trees plant Scotch firs and the phrase is you may afterwards  weed them out  as you please This is ignominious I wish not to rob society of these hardy ser∣vices from the Scotch fir nor do I mean to set it in competition with many of the  trees of the forest which in their infant state it is accustomed to shelter all I mean is to rescue it from the disgrace of being thought fit for nothing else and to establish it's cha∣racter as a picturesque tree For myself I admire it's foliage both the colour of the leaf and it's mode of growth It's ramifi∣cation too is irregular and beautiful and not unlike that of the stone pine which it resembles also in the easy sweep of it's stem and likewise in the colour of the bark which is commonly as it attains age of a rich reddish brown The Scotch fir indeed in it's stripling state is less an object of beauty It's pointed and spiry shoots during the first years of it's growth are formal and yet I have sometimes seen a good contrast pro∣duced between it's spiry points and the roundheaded oaks and elms in it's neigh∣bourhood When I speak however of the Scotch fir as a beautiful individual I conceive it when it has outgrown all the impro∣prieties of it's youthwhen it has compleated it's full ageand when like Ezekiel's cedar it has formed it's  head among the thick branches  I may be singular in my attachment to the Scotch fir I know it has many enemies  but my opinion will weigh only with the reasons I have given  The great contempt indeed in which the Scotch fir is commonly held arises I be∣lieve from two causes  People object first to it's colour It's dark murky hue is unpleasingWith regard to  colour in general  I think I speak the lan∣guage of painting when I assert that the picturesque eye makes little distinction in this matter It has no attachment to one colour in preference to another but considers the beauty of all colouring as resulting not from the colours themselves but almost intirely from their harmony with other colours in their neighbourhood So that as the firtree is supported combined or stationed it forms a beautiful umbrage or a murky spot  A second source of that contempt in which the Scotch fir is commonly held is our rarely seeing it in a picturesque state Scotch firs are seldom planted as  single trees  or in a  jud  cious group  but generally in  close com∣pact bodies  in thick array which suffocates or cramps them and if they ever get loose from this bondage they are already ruined Their lateral branches are gone and their  stems are drawn into poles on which their heads appear stuck as on a center Whereas if the tree had grown in it's natural state all mischief had been prevented It's stem would have taken an easy sweep and it's lateral branches which naturally grow with as much beautiful irregularity as those of deciduous trees would have hung loosely and negligently and the more so as there is something peculiarly light and feathery in it's foliage I mean not to assert that every Scotch fir tho in a natural state would pos∣sess these beauties but it would at least have the chance of other trees and I have seen it tho indeed but rarely in such a state as to equal in beauty the most elegant stonepine  All trees indeed crouded together naturally rise in perpendicular stems but the fir has this peculiar disadvantage that it's lateral branches once injured never shoot again A grove of crouded saplins elms beeches or almost of any deciduous trees when thinned will throw out new lateral branches and in time recover a state of beauty but if the education of the fir has been neglected he is lost for ever  Some of the most picturesque trees of this kind perhaps in England adorn Mr Lenthall's deserted and ruinous mansion of Basilsleigh in Berkshire The soil is a deep but rich sand which seems to be a soil adapted to them And as they are here at perfect liberty they not only become large and noble trees but they expand themselves likewise in all the careless forms of nature No man therefore has a right to depreciate the Scotch fir till he has seen it here or in some other place in a perfect state of nature  The spruce fir is generally esteemed a more beautiful and elegant tree than the Scotch fir and the reason I suppose is because it often feathers to the ground and grows in a more exact and regular shape But this is a principal objection to it It often wants both form and variety We admire it's floating foliage in which it sometimes exceeds all other trees but it is rather disagreeable to see a repetition of these feathery strata beautiful as they are reared tier above tier in regular order from the bottom of a tree to the top It's perpendicular stem  also which has seldom any lineal variety makes the appearance of the tree still more formal  It is not always however that the spruce fir grows with so much regularity Some∣times a lateral branch here and there taking the lead beyond the rest breaks somewhat through the order commonly observed and forms a few chasms which have a good effect When this is the case the spruce fir ranks among picturesque trees Sometimes it has as good an effect and in many cir∣cumstances a better when the contrast appears still strongerwhen the tree is shattered by some accident has lost many of it's branches and is scathed and ragged A feathery branch here and there among broken stumps has often an admirable effect but it must arise from some particular situation In all circumstances however the spruce fir appears best either as a single tree or unmixed with any of it's fellows for neither it nor any of the spearheaded race will ever form a beau∣tiful clump without the assistance of other trees  The silverfir has very little to boast in point of picturesque beauty It has all the regularity of the spruce but without it's floating foliage There is a sort of harsh stiff unbending formality in the stem the branches and in the whole economy of the tree which makes it disagreeable We rarely see it even in the happiest state assume a picturesque shape Assisted it may be in it's form when broken and shattered but it will rarely get rid of it's formality In old age it stands the best chance of attaining beauty We sometimes see it under that circumstance a noble shattered tree finely adorned with ivy and shooting out a few horizontal branches on which it's meagre foliage and tufted moss appear to advantageI may add that the silver fir is perhaps the hardiest of it's tribe It will outface the southwest wind it will bear without shrinking even the seaair so that one advantage at least attends a plantation of silver firs you may have it where you can have no other and a plantation of silver firs may be better than no plantation at all  I know of no other species of fir in England that is worth mentioning The hemlockspruce is a beautiful loose plant but it never I believe attains any size and the Newfoundland or black spruce is another dwarfish tree In that character however it is often beautiful and it's small red cones are an ornament to itIn the vast pineforests of NorthAmerica and in those which hang beetling over the cliffs of the Baltic the picturesque eye might pro∣bably see many a grand production of the fir kind which is hitherto little known or if known would appear there in so improved a character as to seem wholly new In the northern parts of Asia also and in the southern parts of Africa I doubt not but the fir may be found in great variety and perfection In Philip's voyage to Botanybay we are told of pines in Norfolkisland one hundred and eighty feet high as I recollect but I have not the book by me Strabo indeed tells us that the fir is wholly a European plantthat it is never to be met with in any part of Asiaand that it may even be considered in all those places where Europe and Asia border on each other as a distinguishing mark of European ground  On the Asiatic side of the Tanais he tells us it is never found tho on the European side it is so common that the Scythians who inhabit those parts use it always in making arrows He treats Eratosthenes with some contempt for asserting that when Alexander was in India he used fir in constructing his navy  See lib ii p edit Caus  Strabo's accuracy is generally much respected but in this instance his obser∣vations seem to have been confined There is little doubt I think that the fir abounded in many parts of Asia it was probably as much a native of mount Lebanon as the cedar itself  After all however it is probable that the word  which the Latins translate  abies  and we translate  fir  might appear to be somewhat very different from the tree which we call a fir if we had a Grecian botanist to consult    After the pine and fir tribes the yew deserves our notice The yew is a pure native of Britain and was formerly what the oak is now the basis of our strength Of it the old English yeoman made his longbow which he vaunted nobody but an English∣man  could bend In shooting he did not as in other nations keep his left hand steady and draw his bow with his right but keeping his right at rest upon the nerve he pressed the whole weight of his body into the horns of his bow Hence probably arose the English phrase of  bending a bow  and the French of  drawing one  Nor is the yew celebrated only for it's toughness and elasticity but also for it's durable nature Where your paling is most exposed either to winds or springs strengthen it with a post of old yew That hardy veteran fears neither storms above nor damps below It is a common saying amongst the inhabitants of Newforest that a post of yew will out∣last a post of iron  Thus much for the utility and dignity of the yew As to it's picturesque perfections I profess myself contrary I suppose to general opinion a great admirer of it's form and foliage The yew is of all other trees the most tonsile Hence all the indignities it suffers We every where see it cut and metamorphosed into such a variety of defor∣mities that we are hardly brought to conceive it has a natural shape or the power which  other trees have of hanging carelessly and negligently Yet it has this power in a very eminent degree and in a state of nature except in exposed situations is perhaps one of the most beautiful evergreens we have Indeed I know not whether all things con∣sidered it is not superior to the cedar of Lebanon itselfI mean to such meagre repre∣sentations of that noble plant as we have in England The same soil which cramps the cedar is congenial to the yew  It is but seldom however that we see the yew in perfection In Newforest it formerly abounded but it is now much scarcer It does not rank among timbertrees and being thus in a degree unprivileged and unpro∣tected by forestlaws it has often been made booty of by those who durst not lay violent hands on the oak or the ash But still in many parts of the forest some noble specimens of this tree are left One I have often visited which is a tree of peculiar beauty It imme∣diately divides into several massy limbs each of which hanging in grand loose foliage spreads over a large compass of ground and yet the whole tree forms a close compact body that is it's boughs are not so separated  as to break into distinct parts It cannot boast the size of the yewtree at Fotheringal near Taymouth in Scotland which measures fiftysix feet and an half in circumference nor indeed the size of many others on record but it has sufficient size for all the purposes of landscape and in point of picturesque beauty it probably equals any of them It stands not far from the banks of Lymington river on the left bank as you look towards the sea between Roydonfarm and Boldrechurch It occupies a small knoll surrounded with other trees some of which are yews but of inferior beauty A little stream washes the base of the knoll and winding round forms it into a peninsula If any one should have curiosity to visit it from this description and by the help of these landmarks I doubt not but he may find it at any time within the space of these two or three centuries in great perfection if it suffer no external injury If such trees were common they would recover the character of the yewtree among the admi∣rers of picturesque beauty  But tho we should be able to establish it's beauty with respect to form and foliage there remains one point still which we should  find it hard to combat It's colour unfortu∣nately gives offence It's dingy funerial hue people say makes it fit only for a church∣yard  This objection I hope I have already answered in defending the colour of the Scotch fir  See page  An attachment to colour as such seems to me an indication of false taste Hence arise the numerous absurdities of gaudy decoration In the same manner a dislike to any particular colour shews a squeamishness which should as little be encouraged Indeed when you have only one colour to deal with as in painting the wainscot of your room the eye properly enough gives a preference to some soft plea∣sant tint in opposition to a glaring bold one but when colours act in concert as is the case in all scenery red blue yellow light green or dingy green are all alike The virtue of each consists solely in it's agreement with it's neighbours  I have only to add in commendation of this tree that it's veins exceed in beauty those of most other trees Tables made of  yew when the grain is fine are much su∣perior to mahogany and it's root vies in beauty with the ancient citron  The ilex or evergreen oak presents a character very different from that of the yew The yew is a close bodied compact tree The ilex is generally thin and straggling tho we sometimes see it in soils which it likes form a thicker foliage Both the yew and the ilex are beautiful but in different ways As an individual the yew is greatly superior It is an object to admire The beauty of the ilex arises chiefly from situation and contrast  Under this head may be classed another oak nearly an evergreen a late production of singular origin called the Luccamoak from the person who raised it It was produced from an acorn of the common Turkeyoak from which all the Luccamoaks have been grafted as I understand the seed of acci∣dental varieties never produce the same plant I have heard much of the beauty of this tree and of the acquisition it will be to winterscenery by the introduction of a new  and beautiful evergreen It may be so It's growth I am told is rapid But from the few plants I have seen of this stock and those but young no judgment can well be formed  The holly can hardly be called a tree tho it is a large shrub It is a plant however of singular beauty Mr Evelin in his Sylva cries out with rapture "Is there under heaven a more glorious and refreshing ob∣ject of the kind than an impenetrable hedge of about four hundred feet in length nine feet high and five in diameter which I can shew in my gardens at Say'scourt at any time of the year glittering with it's armed and varnished leaves the taller standards at orderly distances blushing with their natural coralshorn and fashioned into columns and pilasters architectionally shaped at due dis∣tance"  Tho we cannot accord with the learned naturalist in the whole of this rapturous en∣comium on the hedge at Say'scourt yet in part we agree with him and admire as much as he does the holly  glittering  with it's armed and varnished leaves and blushing with it's natural coral  But we could wish to recommend it not in a hedge but in a forest where mixed with oak or ash or other trees of the wood it contributes to form the most beautiful scenes blending itself with the trunks and skeletons of the winter or with the varied greens of summer But in it's combined state we shall have occasion hereafter to mention it At present we shall only observe that as far as an in∣dividual bush can be beautiful the holly is extremely so It has besides to recommend it that it is among the hardiest and stoutest plants of English growth It thrives in all soils and in all situations At Dungeness in Kent I have heard it flourishes even among the pebbles of the beach  The hawthorn should not entirely be passed over amidst the minuter plants of the forest tho it has little claim to picturesque beauty In song indeed the shepherd may with propriety  tell his tale  Under the hawthorn in the dale  But when the scenes of nature are presented to the eye it is but a poor appendage It's shape is bad It does not taper and point like the holly but is rather a matted round heavy bush It's fragrance indeed is great but it's bloom which is the source of that fragrance is spread over it in too much profusion It becomes a mere white sheet a bright spot which is seldom found in har∣mony with the objects around it In autumn the hawthorn makes it's best appearance It's glowing berries produce a rich tint which often adds great beauty to the corner of a wood or the side of some crouded clump  SECT V  WE have thus endeavoured to mark the  principal characteristics  of picturesque beauty in the most common trees we have in England But to have a more accurate idea of their  nice peculiarities and distinctions  we should examine their smaller parts with a little more precisiontheir ramification in winter as well as the mass of foliage which they exhibit in summer  Their ramification in part we have already considered but it has only been that of the larger boughs which support the foliage and such as we commonly see under the masses of it when in full leaf Winter dis∣covers the nicer parts of the ramification the little tender spray on which the hang∣ing of the foliage and the peculiar character of the tree so much depend  The study is certainly useful It is true it has none of the larger parts of painting for it's objectcompositionor the massing of light and shade but we consider the spray as a kind of sylvan anatomy which is very necessary for those to understand who wish either to be acquainted with the par∣ticular character of each tree or to repre∣sent it's  general effect  with any degree of ex∣actness  Nor is it an unpleasing study There is much variety in the ramification of each species and much also in that of each indi∣vidual We see every where so many elegant lines so much opposition and rich in∣tersection among them that there are few more beautiful objects in nature than the ramification of a tree For myself I am in doubt whether an old rough interwoven oak merely as a  single object  has not as much beauty in winter as in summer In summer it has unquestionably more effect but in point of simple beauty and amuse∣ment I think I should almost prefer it in winter  If a man were disposed to moralize the ramification of a thriving tree affords a good theme Nothing gives a happier idea of busy life Industry and activity pervade every part Wherever an opening how minute soever appears there some little knot of busy adventurers push in and form a settle∣ment so that the whole is every where full and complete There too as is common in all communities are many little elbowings justlings thwartings and oppositions in which some gain and others lose  As a continuation of this moralizing strain the following short allegory ventures to appear in a note  Ut sylvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos  Prima cadunt ita  Debemur morti nos nostraque  As I sat carelessly at my window and threw my eyes upon a large acacia which grew before me I conceived it might aptly represent a country divided into provinces towns and families The larger branches might hold out the firstthe smaller branches connected with them the secondand those com∣binations of collateral leaves which specify the acacia might represent families composed of individualsIt was now late in the year and the autumnal tint had taken possession of great part of the tree  As I sat looking at it many of the yellow leaves which having been produced earlier decayed sooner were continually dropping into the lap of their great mother Here was an emblem of natural decaythe most obvious appearance of mortality  As I continued looking a gentle breeze rusled among the leaves Many fell which in a natural course might have enjoyed life longer Here malady was added to decay  The blast increased and every branch that presented itself bowed before it A shower of leaves covered the ground The cup of vengeance said I is poured out upon the people Pestilence shakes the land Nature sickens in the gale They fall by multitudes Whole families are cut off together  Among the branches was one intirely withered The leaves were shrivelled yet clinging to itHere was an emblem of famine The nutriment of life was stopped Existence was just supported but every form was emaciated and shrunk  In the neighbourhood stretched a branch not only shrivelled and withered but having been more exposed to winds was stripped almost intirely of it's leaves Here and there hung a solitary leaf just enough to shew that the whole had lately been alive Ah said I here is an emblem of depopulation Some violent cause hath laid waste the land Towns and villages as well as families are desolated Scarce ten are left to bemoan a thousand  How does every thing around us bring it's lesson to our minds Nature is the great book of God In every page is instruction to those who read Mortality must claim it's due Death in various shapes hovers round usThus far went the heathen moralist He had learned no other knowledge from these perishing forms of nature but that men like trees are subject to death  Ita  Debemur morti nos nostraque  Better instructed learn thou a nobler lesson Learn that that God who with the blast of winter shrivels the tree and with the breezes of spring restores it offers it to thee as an emblem of thy hopes The same God presides over the natural and moral world His works are uniform The truths which  nature  teaches as far as they go are the truths of  revelation  also It is written in both these books that that power which revives the tree will revive thee also like it with increasing perfection    In examining the spray of trees I shall confine myself to the oak the ash the elm and the beech It would be endless to run through the whole forest Nor is it neces∣sary  The examination of these few principal trees will shew how consequential a part the spray is in fixing the  character  of the tree There is as much difference in the spray as there is in the foliage or in any other par∣ticular At the same time if a painter be accurate in a  certain degree  in his delineation of some of the more capital trees in others his accuracy is of little consequence nay an endeavour at precision would be stiff and pedantic  In the spray of the four species of trees just mentioned and I doubt not in that of all other trees nature seems to observe one simple principle which is that the mode of growth in the spray corresponds exactly with that of the larger branches of which indeed the spray is the origin Thus the oak divides his boughs from the stem more hori∣zontally than most other deciduous trees The spray makes exactly in miniature the same appearance It breaks out in right an∣gles or in angles that are nearly so forming it's shoots commonly in short lines the second year's shoot usually taking some direc∣tion contrary to that of the first Thus the rudiments are laid of that abrupt mode of ramification for which the oak is so remark∣able When two shoots spring from the same knot they are commonly of unequal length and one with large strides generally takes the lead Very often also three shoots and sometimes four spring from the same knot Hence the spray of this tree becomes thick close and interwoven so that at a little distance it has a full rich appearance and  Spray of the Oak  Ramification of the Oak  Spray of the Ash  Ramification of the Ash  more of the picturesque roughness than we observe in the spray of any other tree The spray of the oak generally springs from the upper or the lateral parts of the bough and it is this which gives it's branches that horizontal appearance which they generally assume  The spray of the ash is very different As the boughs of the ash are less complex so is it's spray Instead of the thick intermingled bushiness which the spray of the oak exhibits that of the ash is much more simple running in a kind of irregular parallels The main stem holds it's course forming at the same time a beautiful sweep but the spray does not divide like that of the oak from the extremity of the last year's shoot but springs from the sides of it Two shoots spring out opposite to each other and each pair in a con∣trary direction Rarely however both the shoots of either side come to maturity one of them is commonly lost as the tree increases or at least makes no appearance in comparison with the other which takes the lead So that notwithstanding this natural regularity  of growth so injurious to the beauty of the spruce fir and some other trees the ash never contracts the least disgusting formality from it It may even receive great pictu∣resque beauty for sometimes the whole branch is lost as far as one of the lateral shoots and this occasions a kind of rectangular junction which forms a beautiful contrast with the other spray and gives an elegant mode of hanging to the tree  This points out another difference between the spray of the oak and that of the ash The spray of the oak we observed seldom shoots from the undersides of the larger branches and it is this together with the strength and firmness of the branches which keeps them in a horizontal form But the spray of the ash as often breaks out on the underside of the branch as on the upper and being of a texture weaker than that of the oak it generally as the bough increases depends below the larger branch and rising again forms in full grown trees especially very elegant pendent boughs  The branch of the elm hath neither the strength nor the various abrupt twistings of  Spray of the Elm  Spray of the Beech  Ramification of the Beech  the oak nor doth it shoot so much in hori∣zontal directions Such also is the spray It has a more regular appearance not starting off at right angles but forming it's shoots more acutely with the parent branch  Neither does the spray of the elm shoot like that of the ash in regular pairs from the same knot but in a kind of alternacy It has generally at first a flat appearance but as one year's shoot is added to another it has not strength to support itself and as the tree grows old it often becomes pendent also like the ash whereas the toughness and strength of the oak enables it to stretch out it's branches horizontally to the very last twig  The spray of the beech observes the same kind of alternacy as that of the elm but it shoots in angles still more acutethe distance between each twig is wider and it forms a kind of zigzag in it's course  We esteem the beech also in some degree a pendent tree as well as the ash but there is a wide difference between them The ash is a light airy tree and it's spray hangs in  elegant loose foliage But the hanging spray of the beech in old trees especially is often twisted and intermingled disagreeably and has a perplexed matted appearance The whole tree gives us something of the idea of an intangled head of bushy hair from which here and there hangs a disorderly lock while the spray of the ash like hair neither neglected nor finically nice has no∣thing squalid in it and yet hangs in loose and easy curls  The spray of trees puts on different ap∣pearances as the spring advances When their buds begin to swell most of them push out a bloom which overspreads them with great richness But of all others the ash presents the most singular and beautiful as∣pect About the end of march or the be∣ginning of april it throws out a knotty bloom which opening gradually not only inriches the spray but is in itself one of the most beautiful among the minuter appearances of nature The feminal stems are of an olive tint and each of them tipped with a black seedOften too the spray of the ash is  inriched by the ragged remnants of the keys and tongues of the last year which mixed with the bloom has a good effect  The elm too throws out a beautiful bloom in form of a spicated ball about the higness of a nutmeg of a dark crimson colour This bloom sometimes blows in such profusion as to thicken and inrich the spray exceedingly even to the fullness almost of foliage It is not however often seen in such perfection In the spring of the year it was more than commonly profuse Indeed the bloom of foresttrees in general is rarely annual it appears in profusion only every second or third year and even then seldom all the trees of the same kind bloom at once Thus when you look into a grove of oaks about the beginning of may you will suppose per∣haps that some are much forwarder in leaf than others whereas in fact this appearance chiefly arises from their being in bloom their little pensile catkins hanging in knots adorned with tufts of young leaves  Having thus made a few observations on the forms of trees their different modes of  growth and other peculiarities I should add that I am far from supposing nature to act always in  exact  conformity to the appear∣ances which I have here marked In the  general mode of growth  which each species observes no doubt she is uniform but in the  particular manner  in which the stem rises the branches shoot the foliage hangs and indeed if I may so speak in the specific character of each individual many circum∣stances will make a difference soils and climate especially These have the same effect on the form of trees which they have on the form of animals We not only see distant parts of the earth but even contiguous countries exhibit varieties in the same species of animals the English and Scotch horse are very different creatures and as climates and soils are still more connected with trees than with animals we may observe a greater difference produced in them within a smaller distance The oak of one country differs in form from the oak of another In one it carries commonly an erect stem for many yards from the ground in another it's branches begin very quickly to divide and straggle In the former situation the foliage  may be thick and interwoven in the latter it may be thin and meagre but in both situations you may easily distinguish it from the oak or the beech The observations therefore which we have made on the form of trees cannot in many minute circum∣stances be supposed to suit the  individuals  of every country tho I have endeavoured as well as I could to adapt them to the  species  They were chiefly made on the trees of Newforest in Hampshire the soil of which in general is a hungry gravel or a cold clay  SECT VI  I SHOULD now dismiss the subject of trees as  individuals  and hasten to consider them in a  combined state  in which they will appear to most advantage but as many trees as well as men have distinguished themselves in the world it seemed proper to dedicate a few pages to the particular mention of such celebrated characters before I conclude that part of my treatise which is professedly written to do honour to  single trees  But first it cannot be enough lamented by the lovers of landscape that we meet with so few of these noble characters Trees indeed sufficient for all the purposes of  dis∣tant scenery  we often find but a tree in full perfection as a grand object to grace  a  foreground  is rarely seen Wherever trees can be turned to profit they are commonly cut down long before they attain picturesque perfection The beauty of almost every species of tree increases after it's prime and unless it have the good fortune to stand in some place of difficult access or under the pro∣tection of some patron whose mansion it adorns we rarely see it in that gran∣deur and dignity which it would acquire by age  Some of the noblest oaks in England were at least formerly found in Sussex They re∣quired sometimes a score of oxen to draw them and were carried in a sort of wain which in that deep country is expressively called a  tugg  Two or three years was not an uncommon space of time for a tree to spend in performing it's journey to Chatham One tugg carried the load but a little way and left it for another tugg to take up If the rains set in it stirred no more that year and sometimes no part of the next summer was dry enough for the tugg to proceed So that the timber was generally  pretty well seasoned before it arrived at the king's yard I suppose the same mode of carriage still continues  In this fallen state alone it is true the tree becomes the basis of England's glory Tho we regret it's fall therefore we must not repine but address the children of the wood as the gallant oak on his removal from the forest is said to have addressed the scion by his side  Where thy great grandsire spread his awful shade  A holy druid mystic circles made  Myself a sapling when thy grandsire bore  Intrepid Edward to the Gallic shore  Me now my country calls Adieu my son  And as the circling years in order run  May'st thou renown'd the forest's boast and pride  Victorious in some future contest ride  Nobody that I know has more patheti∣cally lamented the fall of trees than the elegant Vanier Whoever has a taste for the subject will be gratified by the following quotation  Neque enim villis accedere major  Possit honos densâ quam nubilus arbore lucus  Sylvarum studiosa suos cum Gallia quondam  Vix aleret cives patriâ migrare relictâ  Atque peregrinos alio deferre penates  Maluit excisis victum quam quaerere sylvis  Haec ubi jam nemorum reverentia tanta bipennea  Ut teneat nostros ubi grandior ulla per agros  Quercus ad annosam ferri secura senectam  Durat inaccessis nisi consita montibus ipso  Se defensa loco tucatur si qua supersunt  A patribus nemora ad seros transmissa nepotes  Illa nec aestivo frondent impervia soli  Nobile nec coelo caput abdunt qualia quondam  Vulgus adorabat truncis procera verendis  Sed veteri de stirpe novo surgentia ramo  Et quatuor post

we can and consider them when found as matters of curiosity and pay them a due respect  And yet I should suppose they are not so frequently found in a state of nature as in more cultivated countries In the forests of America and other scenes where boundless woods have filled the plains from the begin∣ning of time and where they grow so close and cover the ground with so impervious a shade that even a weed can scarce rise beneath them the single tree is lost Unless it stand on the outskirts of the wood it is circum∣scribed and has not room to expand it's vast limbs as nature directs When we wish therefore to find the most sublime sylvan characterthe oak the elm or the ash in perfection we must not look for it in close thick woods but standing single independent of all connections as we sometimes find it in our own forests tho oftener in better pro∣tected places shooting it's head wildly into the clouds and spreading it's arms towards every wind of heaven  The oak  Thrives by the rude concussion of the storm  He seems indignant and to feel  The impression of the blast with proud disdain  But deeply earthed the unconscious monarch owes  His firm stability to what he scorns  More fixed below the more disturbed above  If I chose to lengthen my catalogue of celebrated trees I might produce an innu∣merable host of such as have been mentioned casually by historians and travellers in all ages as the planetree hanging over the temple of Delphos which Theophrastus sup∣poses was as ancient as the times of Agamemnon that also by which Socrates used to swear the olive tree at Linturnum planted by Scipio Africanusthe tilia of Basil under which the German emperors used to dinethe malus medica at the monastery of Fundi reverenced by Thomas Aquinasthe oak at Bruges which Francis the first immuredthe limetree in Sweden which gave name to the family of the celebrated Linnaeustrees which captain Cook found in the Western parts of California measuring sixty feet in circumference and rising to the height of one hundred and fifty feet without a single knotsolid trees which have been scooped into canoes capable of holding thirty or forty men particularly one on record at Congo which held two hun∣dred I might add also Arthur's table in the townhall of Winchester which has been  cut out of a tree of immense girth The Cheltenhamoak also might be introduced which as near it's roots as you can walk exceeds twenty paces roundthe Cawthorpe oak also which at the ground exceeded twentysix yardsthe Bentlyoak in Holtforest which at seven feet from the ground was thirtyfour feet in circumferencethe Swilteroak in Needwoodforest which I believe was equal to any of them  Many of these trees are mentioned by Mr Evelin and the rest are collected from the topographical remarks of travel∣lers and historians  With an innumerable list of this kind I might swell my page but I reject all such trees as have either been only casually mentionedor have had their value merely ascertained by a timbermerchant's rule And yet all these have been trees famous in their day some of them are still alive and if I were writing a biographical history of trees I should be glad to insert them having a reverence for them all Where one tree attains this noble growth and makes itself conspi∣cuous thousands and ten thousands reach only the ordinary size of nature The few pages however at present on my hands I  should wish to allot to such trees only as have somewhat more of history and anecdote an∣nexed to them  One of the most celebrated trees on ancient record was an oriental plane which grew in Phrygia It's dimensions are not handed down to us but from the following circumstances we may suppose them to have been very ample When Xerxes set out on his Grecian expedi∣tion his rout led him near this noble tree Xerxes it seems was a great admirer of trees Amidst all his devastations in an enemy's coun∣try it was his particular order to spare the groves This wonderful plane therefore struck his fancy He had seen nothing like it before and to the astonishment of all his officers ordered his mighty host to halt three days during which time he could not be drawn from the Phrygian plane His pavilion was spread under it and he enjoyed the luxury of it's delicious shade while the Greeks were taking measures to seize the pass at Thermopyle The story may not speak much in favour of the  prince but it is my business only to pay honour to the tree  This account is taken from Elian    In Arcadia at the foot of the mountains bounding the Stymphalian plains famous for one of the labours of Hercules stood the little town of Caphiae and just above it rose a fountain called the Menalaid fountain by the side of which Pausanias tells us  Paus Arcad c  grew a planetree of extraordinary size and beauty called the Menalaidplane It was generally believed in the country he tells us that Menelaus coming to Caphiae to raise forces for the Trojan war planted this tree with his own hands Pausanias travelled through Greece in the reign of Antoninus Pius who succeeded to the empire A D So that the age of the tree when Pausanias saw it must have been about one thousand three hundred years  I shall next exhibit another planetree of great celebrity which flourished in Lycia  during the reigns of the Roman Caesars From a vast stem it divided into several huge boughs every one of which had the conse∣quence of a large tree and at a distance the whole together exhibited the appearance of a grove It's branches still flourished while it's trunk decayed This in process of time moul∣dered away into an immense cave at least eighty feet in circumference around the sides of which were placed seats of pumice stone cushioned softly with moss This tree was first brought into repute by Licinius Mutianus governor of Lycia Licinius was a curious man and not unversed in natural history Pliny from whom we have the account of the tree has thought proper to quote him fre∣quently mentioning particularly his remarks on Egyptian paper  Lib xiii c  and also on that kind of wood of which the statue of Diana at Ephesus was made  Lib xvi c  With the Lycianplane Licinius was exceedingly pleased and often enjoyed the company of his friends under it's shade It was great luxury he would say to dine in it's trunk on a sultry summerday and to hear a heavy shower of rain descending  through the several stages of it's leaves As a naturalist he left it on record that himself and eighteen other persons dined commodi∣ously around the benches in the body of it  Caligula had a tree of the same kind at his villa near Velitrae But Caligula's tree appears to have been more complex than the Lycian plane It had not only a hollow cave in it's trunk which was capable of holding fifteen persons at dinner with a pro∣per suit of the emperor's attendants but if I understand Pliny rightly  Lib xii c  it had stories also probably artificial flooring in the boughs of the tree Caligula used to call it  his nest  From the same author we have an account of four holm trees  Lib xvi c  still existing in his time which were of great antiquity Three of them he says stood upon the site of the ancient Tybur which was a city older  than Rome and these trees were not only older than Tybur but were trees of con∣sequence in the days of Tiburtus who founded it For tradition assures us says Pliny they were the very trees on which that hero ob∣served an ominous flight of birds and was determined by them in the site of his town As Tiburtus was the son of Amphiareus who died at Thebes a hundred years before the Trojan war these trees at the lowest cal∣culation must have been fourteen or fifteen hundred years old in the time of Pliny Tho this is far from being incredible yet as it rests wholly on tradition we pay it the less attention What Pliny says in the favour of the fourth tree however has more weight This tree he tells us grew in the Vatican and had it's age inscribed in old Tuscan cha∣racters upon it's trunk from which inscrip∣tion it appeared that before the city of Rome had it's existence this holm was a celebrated tree  When Tiberius built his naumachia and had occasion for large beams in several parts of his work he endeavoured to collect them  from the various forests of the empire Among other massy pieces of timber which were brought to Rome on this occasion the trunk of a larch was of so prodigious a size that the emperor instead of using it in his works ordered it to be laid up as a curiosity It measured one hundred and twenty feet in length and carried a diameter of two feet to the very end  Plin Nat hist l xvi c    When this larch was alive with all the furniture of it's vast top and gigantic limbs in proportion to such a trunk it must have been an astonishing tree  The largest tree that ever was known to be brought into Britain formed the main mast of the Royal Sovereign in queen Ann's time It was ninety feet long and thirtyfive inches in diameter  Sylva p    Mr Evelin from whom we have this account mentions in the same place a still larger tree which formed the keel of the Crown a French ship of the last century  It was one hundred and twenty feet long which is the length of Tiberius's larch tho it had not probably the circumference of that tree  The masts of our ships of war at present are never made of single trees It is the method to lay two or three trees together and fitting them tight to each other to bind them close at proper distances with pitched ropes But a very noble fir was lately brought into England which was not spliced in the common mode but was con∣verted in it's full dimensions into the bowsprit of the Britannia a new ship of one hundred and ten guns in which capacity I have heard it serves at present This fir was ninetysix feet in length and had I believe the full diameter of Tiberius's larch  Maundrel tells us that when he travelled into the East a few of the old cedars of Lebanon were still left He found them among the snow near the highest part of the moun∣tain "I measured one of the largest of them says he and found it twelve yards six inches in girt and yet sound and thirtyseven  yards in the spread of it's boughs At about five or six yards from the ground it divided into five limbs each of which was a massy tree"  A later traveller Van Egmont who visited the scenes of mount Lebanon seems also to speak of the same trees which Maundrel mentions He observed them he says to be of very different ages The old standards had low stems growing like fruit trees Whereas the younger made a much more stately appearance not a little resembling pines Of the ancient trees he saw only eleven those of younger growth far exceeded that number Some of these old cedars were four or five fathoms in circumference Un∣der one of them was erected an altar where the clergy of Tripoly and the neighbouring convent of Massurki sometimes celebrated mass From this tree spread five limbs resembling substantial trees each being about an hundred feet in length and inserted into the main trunk about fourteen or fifteen feet from the ground  These are noble dimensions tho it is pro∣bable that the best of the trees now left upon mount Lebanon are only the refuse of  the ancient race as we may well suppose the best were occasionally taken first If Solomon's botanical works had still been preserved it is probable we should have met with trees of much larger dimensions than these which Maundrel and Van Egmont measured  One of the noblest trees on record is a chesnut upon mount Aetna called the  Cas∣tagna de cento cavalli  It is still alive but has lost much of it's original dignity Many travellers take notice of it Brydone was the last who saw it His account is dated about sixteen or seventeen years ago It had then the appearance of five distinct trees The space within them he was assured had once been filled with solid timber when the whole formed only one tree The possibility of this he could not at first conceive for the five trees together contained a space of two hundred and four feet in diameter At length however he was convinced not only by the testimony of the country and the accurate examination of the canon Recupero a learned naturalist in those parts but by the appear∣ance  of the trees themselves none of which had any bark on the inside This chesnut is of such renown that Brydone tells us he had seen it marked in an old map of Sicily published a hundred years ago  See Brydone's trav vol i p    Among other authors who mention this tree Kircher gives us the following account of it's condition in his day which might be about a century before Brydone saw it "Ostendit mihi viae dux unius castaniae corticem tantae magnitudinis ut intra eam integer pecorum grex a pastoribus tanquam in caula commodissima noctu intercluderetur" From this account one should imagine that in Kircher's days the five trees were  more united  than when Brydone saw them  At Newstadt in the duchy of Wirtemberg stood a lime which was for many ages so remarkable that the city frequently took it's denomination from it being often called  Newstadt ander grassen linden  or Newstadt near the great lime Scarce any person passed  near Newstadt without visiting this tree and many princes and great men did honour to it by building obelisks columns and monu∣ments of various kinds around it engraved with their arms and names to which the dates were added and often some device Mr Evelin  See Ev Sylva page  who procured copies of se∣veral of these monumental inscriptions tells us there were near two hundred of them The columns on which they were fixed served also to bear up the vast limbs of the tree which began through age to become unweildy Thus this mighty plant stood many years in great state the ornament of the town the admiration of the country and supported as it were by the princes of the empire At length it felt the effects of war Newstadt was surrounded by an enemy and the limbs of this venerable tree were mangled in wantonness by the besieging troops Whether it still exist I know not but long after these injuries it stood a noble ruin discovering by the foundations of the several monuments which formerly propped it's  spreading boughs how far it's limits had once extended  As a parallel to the lime of Newstadt I shall next celebrate the lime of Cleves This also was a tree of great magnificence It grew in an open plain just at the entrance of the city and was thought an object worthy to exercise the taste of magistracy The burgo∣master of his day had it surveyed with great accuracy and trimmed into eight broad pyramidal faces Each corner was supported by a handsome stone pillar and in the middle of the tree was cut a noble room which the vast space contained within easily suffered without injuring the regularity of any of the eight faces To crown all the top was curi∣ously clipped into some kind of head and adorned artificially but in what manner whe∣ther with the head of a lion or a stag a weather cock or a sundial we are not told It was something however in the highest stile of Dutch tasteThis tree was long the admiration and envy of all the states of Hol∣land and Mr Evelin from whom we have the relation seems to have thought it a piece  of excellent workmanship "I needed not says he have charged this paragraph with half these trees but to shew how much more the limetree seems disposed to be wrought into these arborious wonders than other trees of slower growth  Sylva p  "  The oaks of Chaucer are celebrated in the annals of poetry as the trees under which  the laughing sage  Carolled his moral song  They grew in the park at Donningtoncastle near Newbery where Chaucer spent his latter life in studious retirementThe largest of these trees was called the  king'soak  and carried an erect stem of fifty feet before it broke into branches and was cut into a beam five feet squareThe next in size was called the  queen'soak  and survived the calamities of the civil wars in king Charles's time tho Donningtoncastle and the country around it were so often the scenes of action and desola∣tion It's branches were very curious they  pushed out from the stem in several uncommon directions imitating the horns of a ram rather than the branches of an oak When it was felled it yielded a beam forty feet long without knot or blemish perfectly strait four feet square at the butend and near a yard at the topThe third of these oaks was called  Chaucer's  of which we have no parti∣culars in general only we are told that it was a noble tree tho inferior to either of the others  See Evelin's Sylva p  None of them I should suppose from this account was a tree of picturesque beauty A strait stem of forty or fifty feet let it's head be what it will can hardly pro∣duce a picturesque form When we admired the stonepine we supposed it's stem to take a sweeping line and to be broken also with stumps or decayed branches  Close by the gate of the waterwalk at Magdalen college in Oxford grew an oak which perhaps stood there a saplin when Alfred the great founded the university This period only includes a space of nine hundred  years which is no great age for an oak It is a difficult matter indeed to ascertain the age of a tree The age of a castle or abbey is the object of history Even a common house is recorded by the family that built it All these objects arrive at maturity in their youth if I may so speak But the tree gradually compleating it's growth is not worth record∣ing in the early part of it's existence It is then only a common tree and afterwards when it becomes remarkable for it's age all memory of it's youth is lost This tree how∣ever can almost produce historical evidence for the age assigned to it About five hundred years after the time of Alfred William of Wainfleet Dr Stukely tells us expressly ordered his college to be founded near the  great oak  Itiner curios  and an oak could not I think be less than five hundred years of age to merit that title together with the honour of fixing the site of a college When the magnificence of cardinal Wolsey erected that handsome tower which is so ornamental to the whole building this tree might probably be in the meridian  of it's glory or rather perhaps it had attained a green old age But it must have been mani∣festly in it's decline at that memorable aera when the tyranny of James gave the fellows of Magdalen so noble an opportunity of with∣standing bigotry and superstition It was afterwards much injured in Charles II's time when the present walks were laid out It's roots were disturbed and from that period it declined fast and became reduced by degrees to little more than a mere trunk The oldest members of the university can scarce recollect it in better plight But the faithful records of history  See Dr plot's hist of Oxf ch vi sect  have handed down it's ancient dimen∣sions Through a space of sixteen yards on every side from it's trunk it once flung it's boughs and under it's magnificent pavilion could have sheltered with ease three thousand men tho in it's decayed state it could for many years do little more than shelter some luckless individual whom the driving shower had overtaken in his evening walk In the summer of the year this magnificent ruin fell to the ground alarming the college  with it's rushing sound It then appeared how precariously it had stood for many years It's grand taproot was decayed and it had hold of the earth only by two or three roots of which none was more than a couple of inches in diameter From a part of it's ruins a chair has been made for the president of the college which will long continue it's memory  Near Worksop grew an oak which in respect both to it's own dignity and the dignity of it's situation deserves honourable mention In point of grandeur few trees equalled it It overspread a space of ninety feet from the extremities of it's opposite boughs These dimensions will produce an area capable on mathematical calculation of covering a squadron of two hundred and thirtyfive horse The dignity of it's station was equal to the dignity of the tree itself It stood on a point where Yorkshire Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire unite and spread it's shade over a portion of each From the honourable station of thus fixing the boundaries of three large counties it was equally respected through the domains of them all and was known far and  wide by the honourable distinction of the  shireoak  by which appellation it was marked among cities towns and rivers in all the larger maps of England  See Evelin's sylva p    In the garden at Tortworth in Glocester∣shire an old familyseat belonging to lord Ducie grows a Spanish chesnut of great age and dimensions Traditional accounts suppose it to have been a boundarytree in the time of king John and I have met with other accounts which place it in the same honour∣able station in the reign of king Stephen How much older it may be we know not Considerably older it probably was for we rarely make boundarytrees of saplins and offsets which are liable to a thousand ac∣cidents and are unable to maintain with proper dignity the station delegated to them This tree is at present in hands which justly value and protect it's age It was barely included within the gardenwall which bore hard upon it Lord Ducie removed the incumbrance and at the same time applied  fresh earth to the roots of the tree which seems to have inlivened it So late as in the year it produced great quantities of chesnuts which tho small were sweet and wellflavoured In the great chesnutcause mentioned a little above  See page  between Barrington and Ducarel this venerable tree was called upon as an evidence and gave a very respectable testimony in favour of the chesnuts  After mentioning this chesnut which has been celebrated so much I cannot forbear mentioning another which is equally remark∣able for having never been celebrated at all tho it is one of the largest trees that per∣haps ever existed in England If it had ever been noticed merely for it's bulk I should have passed it over among other gigantic plants that had nothing else to boast but as no historian or antiquarian so far as I have heard hath taken the least notice of it I thought it right from this very circumstance to make up the omission by giving it at least what little credit these papers could give  This chesnut grows at a place called Wimley near Hitchinpriory in Hertfordshire In the year at five feet above the ground it's girth was somewhat more than fourteen yards It's trunk was hollow and in part open But it's vegetation was still vigorous On one side it's vast arms shooting up in various forms some upright and others oblique were decayed and peeled at the extremities but issued from luxuriant foliage at their insertion in the trunk On the other side the foliage was still full and hid all decay  In a glade of Hainhaultforest in Essex about a mile from Barkingside stands an oak which has been known through many cen∣turies by the name of Fairlop The tradition of the country traces it half way up the Christian aera It is still a noble tree tho it has now suffered greatly from the depre∣dations of time About a yard from the ground where it's rough fluted stem is thirtysix feet in circumference it divides into eleven vast arms yet not in the horizontal manner of an oak but rather in that of a beech Beneath it's shade which overspreads an area  of three hundred feet in circuit an annual fair has long been held on the d of July and no booth is suffered to be erected beyond the extent of it's boughs But as their ex∣tremities are now become sapless and age is yearly curtailing their length the liberties of the fair seem to be in a very desponding condition The honour however is great But honours are often accompanied with inconveniences and Fairlop has suffered from it's honourable distinctions In the feasting that attends a fair fires are often necessary and no places seemed so proper to make them in as the hollow cavities formed by the heaving roots of the tree This practice has brought a speedier decay on Fairlop than it might otherwise have suffered  Not far from Blanford in Dorsetshire stood very lately a tree known by the name of Damory's oak About five or six cen∣turies ago it was probably in a state of maturity At the ground it's circumference was sixtyeight feet and seventeen feet above the ground it's diameter was four yards As this vast trunk decayed it became hollow  forming a cavity which was fifteen feet wide and seventeen feet high capable of holding twenty men During the civil wars and till after the restoration this cave was regularly inhabited by an old man who sold ale in it In the violent storm in the year it suffered greatly many of it's noblest limbs having been torn from it But it was still so grand a ruin above forty years after that some of it's branches were seventyfive feet high and extended seventytwo In the year when it was fit for nothing but firewood it was sold for fourteen pounds  See Hutchins's acc of Dorsetshire vol i with a print of it    In Torwood in the county of Sterling upon a little knoll stand at this time the ruins of an oak which is supposed to be the largest tree that ever grew in Scotland The trunk of it is now wholly decayed and hollow but it is evident from what remains that it's diameter could not have been less than eleven or twelve feetWhat it's age may be is matter only of conjecture but  from some circumstances it is probably a tree of great antiquity The little knoll it stands on is surrounded by a swamp over which a causeway leads to the tree or rather to a circle which seems to have run round it The vestiges of this circle as well as the causeway bear a plain resemblance to those works which are commonly attributed to the Druids So that it is probable this tree was a scene of worship belonging to those heathen priestsBut the credit of it does not depend on the dubious vestiges of Druid antiquity In a later scene of greater impor∣tance if tradition ever be the vehicle of truth it bore a great shareWhen that illustrious hero William Wallace roused the spirit of the Scotch nation to oppose the tyranny of Edward he often chose the soli∣tude of Torwood as a place of rendezvous for his army Here he concealed his num∣bers and his designs sallying out suddenly on the enemy's grrisons and retreating as suddenly when he feared to be overpowered While his army lay in those woods the oak which we are now commemorating was com∣monly his headquarters Here the hero generally slept it's hollow trunk being ca∣pacious  enough to afford shelter not only to himself but to several of his officers This tree has ever since been known by the name of  Wallacetree  by which name it may easily be found in Torwood to this day  See Nimmo's hist of Sterlingshire p    Among these celebrated trees we must not forget Hern's oak in Windsor forest Shake∣spear tells us  an old tale goes that Hern the hunter  Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest  Doth all the winter time at still of midnight  Walk round about this oak with ragged horns  And then he blasts the trees destroys the cattle  Makes the milchcow yield blood and shakes a chain  In hideous dreadful manner  This tree as far as we can pay credit to tradition and general opinion still exists In the little park at Windsor is a walk known by the name of Queen Elizabeth's walk It consists of elms among which is a single oak taken into the row as if particularly meant to be distinguished at the time when the  walk was laid out This tree is supposed to be Hern's oak It is a large tree measuring about twentyfour feet in circum∣ference and is still in great vigour which I think chiefly injures it's historical credit For tho it is evidently a tree in years and might well have existed in the time of Elizabeth it seems too strong and vigorous to have been a proper tree in that age for Hern the hunter to have danced round Fairies elves and that generation of people universally chose the most ancient and ve∣nerable trees they could find to gambol under and the poet who should describe them dancing under a saplin would shew little acquaintance with his subject That this tree could not be called a venerable tree two hundred years ago is evident because it hardly can assume that character even now And yet an oak in a soil it likes will continue so many years in a vigorous state that we must not lay more stress on this argument than it will fairly bearIt may be added however in it's favour that a pit or ditch is still shewn near the tree as Shakespear describes it which may have  been preserved with the same veneration as the tree itself  There is an oak in the grounds of Sir Gerrard Van Neck at Heveningham in Suffolk which carries us likewise into the times of Elizabeth But this tree brings it's evidence with itevidence which if necessary might carry it into Saxon times It is now falling fast into the decline of years and every year robs it more of it's honours But it's trunk which measures thirtyfive feet in circumference still retains it's grandeur tho the ornaments of it's boughs and foliage are much reduced But the grandeur of the trunk consists only in appearance It is a mere shell In Queen Elizabeth's time it was hollow and from this circumstance the tree derives the honour of being handed down to posterity That princess who from her earliest age loved masculine amusements used often it is said in her youth to take her stand in this tree and shoot the deer as they passed From that time it has been known by the name of Queen Elizabeth's oak  After celebrating the grandeur of these sons of the forest I should wish to introduce in due subordination two or three celebrated fruit trees  In the deanerygarden at Winchester stood lately so lately as the year an ancient figtree Through a succession of many deans it had been cased up and shielded from winds and frost The wall to which it was nailed was adorned with various inscriptions in Hebrew Greek and Latin alluding to such passages of the sacred writings as do honour to the figtree After having been presented with several texts of scripture the reader was informed by way of climax that  in the year    king James I tasted of the fruit of this figtree with great pleasure  At Lambeth likewise are two celebrated figtrees which on good grounds are sup∣posed to have been planted by cardinal Pole They are immense trees of the kind covering a space of wall fifty feet in height and forty in breadth The circumference of the stem  of one of them is twentyeight inches and of the other twentyone They are of the white Marseilles kind and have for many years fur∣nished the tables of the archbishops of Canterbury with very delicious fruit  Among other remarkable fruit trees may be reckoned a vine belonging to the late Sir Charles Raymond at Valentinehouse near Ilford in Essex It was planted a cutting in the year of the black Hambrugh sort and as this species will not easily bear the open air it was planted in the hothouse tho without any preparation of soil which is in those grounds a stiff loam or rather clay The hothouse is a very large one about seventy feet in front and the vine which I understand is not pruned in the common way extends two hundred feet part of it running along the south wall on the outside of the hothouse In the common mode of pruning this species of vine is no great bearer but managed as it is here it produces wonder∣fully Sir Charles Raymond on the death of his lady in left Valentinehouse at which time the gardener had the profits of the  vine It annually produces about four hundred weight of grapes which used formerly when the hothouse I suppose was kept warmer to ripen in march tho lately they have not ripened till june when they sell at four shillings a pound which produces about eighty pounds This account I had from Mr Eden himself the gardener who planted the vineWith regard to the profits of it I think it probable from the accounts I have had from other hands that when the grapes ripened earlier they produced much more than eighty pounds A gentleman of character informed me that he had it from Sir Charles Raymond himself that after supplying his own table he has made one hundred and twenty pounds a year of the grapes and the same gentleman who was curious inquired of the fruit dealers who told him that in some years they sup∣posed the profits have not amounted to less than three hundred pounds This does not contradict Mr Eden's account who said that the utmost he ever made of it that is I suppose when the grapes sold at four shillings a pound in june was eightyfour pounds At the lowest calculation the profits were pro∣digiousThe  stem of this vine was in the year thirteen inches in circumference  But the vine even as a timbertree hath it's place in history Mr Misson a traveller of whom Mr Addison speaks with particular respect tells us  See Misson's travels in Italy  that the gates of the great church at Ravenna in Italy were made of vine planks twelve feet long and fourteen or fifteen inches broad The vine from which these planks were taken must have been an enor∣mous vegetable of it's kind Indeed if the account had not been well attested it would have exceeded creditMisson adds that the soil about Ravenna on the side next the sea was remarkable for the enormous growth of vines and he supposes it was owing to the rich manure left by the sea For tho the town of Ravenna in his day stood a league from the Adriatic yet it is an undoubted fact that the sea formerly washed it's walls and that the present Ravenna occupies the site of the ancient Ravenna which we know was one  of the best ports the Romans had on the Adriatic  Having thus given the history of some of the most celebrated trees on record I cannot help subjoining an account of a few particular species which are remarkably singular  In the memoirs of the French academy we find a description of a very curious tree by Mr Adanson called the Boabab It is a native of Senegal and has been taken notice of by Prosper Alpinus and other botanists but Mr Adanson who spent several years in those parts seems to have had the best opportunities of being acquainted with itAs to it's botanical peculiarities which are great and it's physical uses which are many we enter not into them We have only to do with it's external form which is very singular It is supposed to be the largest of nature's vege∣table productionsthe behemoth of the forest From Mr Adanson's account one should sup∣pose the boabab to be a kind of natural pollard He tells us it's trunk seldom rises higher than twelve feet tho it's diameter exceeds seventy From this amazing trunk spring a number of  massy branches The center branch rises perpendicularly sixty or seventy feet the lateral branches shoot in angles less and less acute till the lowest series form right angles with the trunk and so become quite horizontal In this direction they stretch fifty or sixty feet till their weight brings them to the ground with which the extremities of many of them are in contact So that the whole tree has the appearance of a woody hemisphere whose radius including the thickness of the trunk must be about eighty or ninety feet Whatever may be said for the peculiarity of such a tree we cannot say much in favour of it's picturesque form It seems to be little more than a monstrous bush The bark of this tree is of an ashcoloured tint It's leaves are oval pointed at the end and about five inches longTho the boabab is a native of Africa yet a small one was found growing in the island of Martinico It is supposed however to have been brought thither by some of the negroeslaves among whom it is common to carry seeds of dif∣ferent kinds as charms and remedies and it is certain that many African plants have  been propagated in the WestIndies in this accidental manner  Mr Evelin gives us the description of another curious tree called the Arbor de Rays which is sound chiefly in the East Indies and is remarkable for the manner in which it propagates From the end of it's boughs it distills in a continued viscous thread a kind of gummy matter which increases like an icicle till it reach the ground where it takes root and becomes a stem putting forth new branches and propagating anew so that a single plant of this kind may in∣crease into a forest  Strabo describes an Indian tree which I should suppose was the same with Mr Evelin's arbor de Rays only Strabo accounts more simply for the mode of it's propagation It's branches he says grow horizontally about twelve cubits and then take a direc∣tion to the earth where they root themselves and when they have attained maturity con∣tinue to propagate in the same manner till the ground is covered with them for a con∣siderable space or as Strabo more expressively  describes it till the whole becomes  like a tent supported by many columns  p edit Caus  This seems to be the tree of which Milton speaks  Branching so broad and long that in the ground  The bended twigs take root and daughters grow  About the mother tree a pillared shade  High overarched with ecchoing walks between  There oft the Indian herdsman shunning heat  Shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds  At loopholes cut through thickest shade  Modern travellers  speak of an Indian tree like this the only tree of the kind they know which they call the Banian tree or Indian fig In it's mode of propagation it corresponds rather with Strabo's description than Evelin's We are informed however that altho common in India it is not very commonly found in that state of grandeur in which it is here described Nor indeed will it easily take that very regular form without some little assistance from art In∣stead of the  Indian herdsman  whom Milton introduces it is often at this day inhabited  by a Bramin who builds his little reed∣thatched shed against it's trunk and amuses his leisure by directing it's lengthening branches into proper places and forming each into a regular arch Here dressed in a long white tunic the habit of his order and adorned with a flowing beard he spends his solitary hours in wandering among the verdant allies of his tree scarce ever leaving it's limits The inhabitants of the district resort daily to him with the necessaries of life and receive in return his prayers and benedic∣tions  There is a tree in the island of Java called the Upas or poisontree which in the history of curious trees should not be omitted tho the accounts of it are so wonderful that some have esteemed them fabulous They are given to the public by a surgeon be∣longing to the Dutch EastIndia company of the name of Foersch who was stationed at Batavia in the year Surprizing however as these accounts may be they are accompanied with so many public facts and names of persons and places that it is  somewhat difficult to conceive them fabulous The abridged narrative of this strange production is this  The Upas grows about twentyseven leagues from Batavia in a plain surrounded by rocky mountains the whole of which plain con∣taining a circle of ten or twelve miles round the tree is totally barren Nothing that breathes or vegetates can live within it's influence The bird that flies over it drops down dead The beast that wanders into it expires The whole dreadful area is covered with sand over which lie scattered loose flints and whitening bonesThis tree may be called the emperor's great military magazine In a solution of the poisonous gum which exudes from it his arrows and offensive weapons are dipped The procuring there∣fore of this poisonous gum is a matter of as much attention as of difficulty Criminals only are employed in this dreadful service Of these several every year are sent with a promise of pardon and reward if they procure it Hooded in leathern cases with glass eyletholes and secured as much as possible from the full effluvia of the air they are to breathe they undertake this melancholy  journey travelling always with the wind About one in ten escapes and brings away a little box of this direful commodity  Of the dreadful and sudden effect of this poison the author saw many instances He mentions among others the execution of thirteen young ladies of the emperor's seraglio who having been convicted of infidelity to his bed were condemned to die by the poison of Upas which is considered in Java like the axe in England as an honourable in∣strument of death At eleven o'clock in the forenoon these unhappy victims were led into a court in the palace where a row of thirteen posts had been erected To these they were bound As they stood trembling they were obliged to confess the justice of their sentence which each of them did by laying one hand on the koran and the other on her breast When these confessions were finished and a few religious ceremonies on a sign given by the judge an executioner stepped forward who bared their breasts and amidst their cries and shrieks with a poisoned lancet made a slight incision in each The author says he stood by with his watch in his hand In five minutes they were seized with con∣vulsive  spasmsexcruciating agonies succeeded and in sixteen minutes they were all dead A frightful change came on From being objects of beauty they became spectacles of horror Livid spots broke out upon them Their faces swelled their cheeks became blue and their eyes yellow  The author says that on the coast of Macassar there are found trees very like the Upas of Java but not so malignant If so it is probable that all these trees are of the same kind only the JavaUpas has found a situation where it's poisonous qualities are more sublimed  Dr Darwin in his  Loves of the plants  has given us a picture of the situation of this dreadful tree the existence of which he seems to believe  Where seas of glass with gay reflections smile  Round the green coasts of Java's palmy isle  A spacious plain extends it's upland scene  Rocks rise on rocks and fountains gush between  Soft breathes the breeze eternal summers reign▪  And showers prolific bless the soilin vain  No spicy nutmeg scents the vernal gales  No towering plantain shades the midday vales  No grassy mantle hides the sable hills  No flowery chaplet crowns the trickling rills  No step retreating on the sand impressed  Invites the visit of a second guest  Fierce in dread silence on the blasted heath  Fell Upas sits  That I may connect this little biographical history of trees with the principal subject of my book I shall conclude it with an account of three celebrated trees from Newforest in Hampshire  The first I shall mention is that famous tree against which the arrow of Sir Walter Tyrrel glanced which killed William Rufus  Leland tells us and Camden  See Camden's account of Newforest  from him that the death of Rufus happened at a place in Newforest called Througham where a chapel was erected to his memory But I meet with no place of the name of Througham in Newforest and neither the remains nor the remembrance of any chapel It is pro∣bable that  Througham  might be what is now called  Fritham  where the tradition of the country seems to have fixed the  spot  with more credibility from  the tr  e  The chapel might only have been some little temporary oratory which having never been endowed  might speedily have fallen to decay but the tree it is probable would be noticed at the time by every body who lived near it and by strangers who came to see it and it is as probable that it could never be forgotten afterwards They who think a tree insufficient to record a fact of so ancient a date may be reminded that seven hundred years and it is not more since the death of Rufus make no extraordinary period in the existence of an oak About fifty years ago however this tree became so decayed and mutilated that in all pro∣bability the spot would have been forgotten if some other memorial had not been raised Before the stump therefore was eradicated a triangular stone was erected by the late lord Delaware who lived in one of the neigh∣bouring lodges on the three sides of which stone the following inscriptions are engraven  Here stood the oaktree on which an arrow shot by sir Walter Tyrrel at a stag glanced and struck king William II surnamed Rufus in the breast of which stroke he instantly died on the d of august  King William II being thus slain was laid on a cart belonging to one Purkess and  drawn from hence to Winchester and buried in the cathedral church of that city  That the spot where an event so memorable happened might not hereafter be unknown this stone was set up by John lord Delaware who has seen the tree growing in this place  Lord Delaware asserts plainly that he had seen the oaktree and as he lived much on the spot he had probably other grounds for the assertion besides the tradition of the country That matter however rests on his authority  The next tree I shall exhibit from Newforest is the  groaningtree  of Badesly a village about two miles from Lymington The history of the groaningtree is this About forty years ago a cottager who lived near the centre of the village heard frequently a strange noise behind his house like that of a person in extreme agony Soon after it caught the attention of his wife who was then confined to her bed She was a timorous woman and being greatly alarmed her hus∣band endeavoured to persuade her that the  noise she heard was only the bellowing of the stags in the forest By degrees however the neighbours on all sides heard it and the thing began to be much talked of It was by this time plainly discovered that the groaning noise proceeded from an elm which grew at the end of the garden It was a young vigorous tree and to all appearance perfectly sound  In a few weeks the fame of the groaning tree was spread far and wide and people from all parts flocked to hear it Among others it attracted the curiosity of the late prince and princess of Wales who resided at that time for the advantage of a seabath at Pilewell the seat of Sir James Worsley which stood within a quarter of a mile of the groaning tree  Tho the country people assigned many super∣stitious causes for this strange phenomenon the naturalist could assign no physical one that was in any degree satisfactory Some thought it was owing to the twisting and friction of the roots Others thought it pro∣ceeded from water which had collected in the body of the treeor perhaps from pent air But no cause that was alledged appeared equal to the effect In the mean time the tree  did not always groan sometimes disappoint∣ing it's visitants yet no cause could be as∣signed for it's temporary cessations either from seasons or weather If any difference was observed it was thought to groan least when the weather was wet and most when it was clear and frosty but the sound at all times seemed to arise from the root  Thus the groaning tree continued an object of astonishment during the space of eighteen or twenty months to all the country around and for the information of distant parts a pamphlet was drawn up containing a par∣ticular account of all the circumstances re∣lating to it  At length the owner of it a gentleman of the name of Forbes making too rash an experiment to discover the cause bored a hole in it's trunk After this it never groaned It was then rooted up with a further view to make a discovery but still nothing appeared which led to any investi∣gation of the cause It was universally how∣ever believed that there was no trick in the affair but that some natural cause really existed tho never understood  The last celebrated tree which I shall present to the reader from Newforest is the Cadenham oak which buds every year in the depth of winter Cadenham is a village about three miles from Lyndhurst on the Salisbury road  Having often heard of this oak I took a ride to see it on the th of december It was pointed out to me among several other oaks surrounded by a little forest stream winding round a knoll on which they stood It is a tall straight plant of no great age and apparently vigorous except that it's top has been injured from which several branches issue in the form of pollard shoots It was intirely bare of leaves as far as I could discern when I saw it and undistinguishable from the other oaks in it's neighbourhood except that it's bark seemed rather smoother occasioned I apprehended only by frequent climbing  Having had the account of it's  early budding  confirmed on the spot I engaged one Michael Lawrence who kept the white hart a small  alehouse in the neighbourhood to send me some of the leaves to Vicar's hill as soon as they should appear The man who had not the least doubt about the matter kept his word and sent me several twigs on the morning of the th of january a few hours after they had been gathered The leaves were fairly expanded and about an inch in length From some of the buds two leaves had unsheathed themselves but in general only one  Through what power in nature this strange premature vegetation is occasioned I believe no naturalist can explain I sent some of the leaves to one of the ablest botanists we have Mr Lightfoot author of the Flora Scotica and was in hopes of hearing something satis∣factory on the subject But he is one of those philosophers who is not ashamed of igno∣rance where attempts at knowledge are mere conjecture He assured me that he neither could account for it in any way nor did he know of any other instance of premature vegetation except the Glastonburythorn  The  philosophers of the forest  in the mean∣time account for the thing at once through the influence of old Christmasday univer∣sally  believing that the oak buds on that day and that only The same opinion is held with regard to the Glastonburythorn by the common people of the west of England But without doubt the germi∣nation there is gradual and forwarded or retarded by the mildness or severity of the weather One of it's progeny which grew in the gardens of the duchess dowager of Portland at Bulstrode had it's flowerbuds perfectly formed so early as the st of december which is fifteen days earlier than it ought to flower according to the vulgar prejudice  In the Salisbury journal january th the following paragraph appeared  In consequence of a report that has prevailed in this country for upwards of two centuries and which by many has been almost considered as a matter of faith that the oak at Caden∣ham in the Newforest shoots forth leaves on every old Christmasday and that no leaf is ever to be seen on it either before or after that day during the winter a lady who is now on a visit in this city and who is attentively curious in every thing relative to art or nature made a journey to Cadenham on monday the d instant purposely to enquire on the spot about the production of this famous tree On her arrival near it the usual guide was ready to attend her but on his being desired to climb the oak and to search whether there were any leaves then on it he said it would be to no purpose but that if she would come on the wednesday fol∣lowing Christmasday she might certainly see thousands However he was prevailed on to ascend and on the first branch which he gathered appeared several fair new leaves fresh sprouted from the buds and nearly an inch and a half in length It may be imagined that the guide was more amazed at this premature production than the lady for so strong was his belief in the truth of the whole tradition that he would have pledged his life that not a leaf was to have been discovered on any part of the tree before the usual hour  But tho the superstitious part of this ancient legend is hence confuted yet it must be allowed that there is something very uncommon and curious in an oak's constantly shooting forth leaves at this unseasonable time of the year and that the cause of it well deserves the philosophical attention of the botanist In some years there is no doubt but that this oak may shew it's  first  leaves on the Christmas morning as probably as on a few days before and this perhaps was the case in the last year when a gentleman of this neighbourhood a nice and critical observer strictly examined the branches not only on the Christmas morn but also on the day prior to it On the first day not a leaf was to be found but on the following every branch had it's complement tho they were then but just shooting from the buds none of them being more than a quarter of an inch long The latter part of the story may easily be credited that no leaves are to be seen on it after Christmasday as large parties yearly assemble about the oak on that morning and regularly strip every appearance of a leaf from it    This early spring however of the Cadenham oak is of very short duration The buds after unfolding themselves make no farther  progress but immediately shrink from the season and die The tree continues torpid like other deciduous trees during the re∣mainder of the winter and vegetates again in the spring at the usual season I have seen it in full leaf in the middle of summer when it appeared both in it's form and foliage exactly like other oaks  I have been informed that another tree with the same property of early germination has lately been found near the spot where Rufus's monument stands If this be the case it seems in some degree to authenticate the account which Camden  See Camden's account of Newforest  gives us of the scene of that prince's death for he speaks of the premature vegetation of that very tree on which the arrow of Tyrrel glanced and the tree I now speak of if it really exist tho I have no sufficient authority for it might have been a descendant of the old oak and have inherited it's virtues  It is very probable however there may be other oaks in the forest which may like∣wise have the property of early germination I have heard it often suspected that people  gather buds from other trees and carry them on old Christmasday to the oak at Cadenham from whence they pretended to pluck them For that tree is in such repute and resorted to annually by so many visitants that I think it could not easily supply all it's votaries without some foreign contri∣butionsSome have accounted for this phenomenon by supposing that leaves have been preserved over the year by being steeped in vinegar But I am well satisfied this is not the case Mr Lightfoot to whom I sent the leaves had no such suspicion  END OF THE FIRST BOOK  BOOK II  SECTION I  FROM considering trees as  individuals  we proceed next to consider them under their various  combinations  among which  clumps  are the simplest  What number of trees make a  clump  no rules of art prescribe The term has rather a  relative  meaningIn scenes brought near the eye we call three or four trees a clump But in distant and extensive scenery we scruple not to use the term for any smaller detached part of a wood tho it may consist of some hundredsBut tho the term admits not of exact definition I shall en∣deavour  by amplification to make the ideas contained under it as distinct as I can  We distinguish then two kinds of clumps the  smaller  and the  larger  confining the former chiefly to the  foreground  and con∣sidering the latter as the ornament of a  dis∣tance  With regard to the  smaller clump  the chief beauty we expect here arises from  contrast in the parts  We have seen that in  single trees  each must have it's characteristic beauty It has nothing else to depend on But in  combination  the beauty of the  individual  is not required the  whole clump together  must produce the effect  To enumerate all the sources of beautiful contrast which contribute to produce this effect might be difficult I shall cursorily suggest a few  In the first place the  relative  situation of trees with regard to  each other  should be considered Three trees or more standing in a line are formal In the natural wood you rarely see this formalityAnd yet even  three trees in a line  will be greatly assisted by  the lines of the several trunks taking different directions and by the various forms distances and growth of the trees  If three trees do not stand in a line they must of course stand in a triangle which pro∣duces a great variety of pleasing forms  If a fourth tree be added it stands beautifully near the middle of the triangle of whatever form the triangle may be If it be equilateral and the tree placed exactly in the middle there are three points as you walk round the triangle from which it will appear offensively regularRemarks however of this kind affect only young trees while their stems are tall and similar As they increase their different modes of growththe swelling of their roots the habits they contract from windtheir ramificationtheir lateral branches and other accidental circumstances introduce endless vari∣eties among them and blot out many of those little formalities which attend their youth tho after all the  artificial  clump will rarely attain the beauty of the  natural  one  If the  clump  consist of still more trees than four a greater variety among the stems will of course take placedouble triangles irregular quincunxes and other pleasing shapes which  may be seen exemplified in every wood of natural growth  The branches also are as much a source of contrast as the stem To be picturesque they must intermingle with each other without heavinessthey must hang loosely but yet with  varied looseness  on every sideand if there be one superior apex there may be two or three others that are subordinate according to the size of the clump  Different kinds of trees also in the same clump occasion often a beautiful contrast There are few trees which will not harmonize with trees of a different kind tho perhaps the most simple and beautiful contrasts arise from the various modes of growth in the same species We often see two or three oaks inter∣mingle their branches together in a very pleasing manner When the beech is full grown it is generally in a luxuriant soil at least so heavy that it rarely blends happily either with it's own kind or with any other The silverfir too we have observed is a very unaccommodating treeSo also are other firs indeed all that taper to a point Not so the pinerace They are clumpheaded and unite well in composition With these also  the Scotchfir leagues from little knots of which we often see beautiful contrasts arise When they are young and luxuriant especi∣ally if any number of them above four or five are planted together they generally form a heavy murky spot but as they acquire age this heaviness goes off the inner branches decay the outward branches hang loosely and negligently and the whole has often a good effect unless they have been planted too closely I am rather doubtful how far deci∣duous trees mix well in a clump with ever∣greens and yet we sometimes see a natural good effect of light and shade from the darkness of the fir contrasting agreeably with the sprightly green of a deciduous tree just coming into leaf In this however I am clear that if they are mixed they ought not to be planted as they often are alternately but each kind together  Contrasts again arise from the mixture of trees of unequal growthfrom a young tree united with an old onea stunted tree with a luxuriant oneand sometimes from two or three trees which in themselves are illshaped but when combined are pleasing Inequalities  of all these kinds are what chiefly give nature's planting a superiority over art  The form of the foliage is another source of contrast In one part where the branches intermingle the foliage will be interwoven and close in another where the boughs of each tree hang separately the appearance will be light and easy  But whatever beauty these  contrasts  exhibit the effect is totally lost unless the  clump  be  wellbalanced  This is as necessary in a  com∣bination of trees  as in a  single tree  See page  The clump is considered as  one  object and the support of the  whole  must depend on the several trunks and leading branches of which it is composed We do not expect the minu∣tiae of scale and weight if no side prepon∣derate so as to hurt the eye it is enough Unless however the clump have suffered some external injury it is seldom deficient in point of balance Nature always conducts the stems and branches in such easy forms wherever there is an opening and fills up all with so much nice contrivance and at the same time  with so much picturesque irregularity that we rarely wish for an amendment in her works So true indeed this is that nothing is so dangerous as to take away a tree from a clump You will infallibly destroy the balance which can never again be restored  Thus far we have considered a  clump  as a  single independent  objectas the object of a  foreground  consisting of such a confined num∣ber of trees as the eye can fairly include at once And when trees strike our fancy either in the wild scenes of nature or in the im∣provements of art they will ever be found in combinations similar to these  When the  clump  grows  larger  it becomes qualified only as a  remote object  combining with vast woods and forming a part of some extensive scene either as a first a second or a third distance  The great use of the  larger clump  is to lighten the heaviness of a  continued distant wood  and connect it gently with the plain that the transition may not be too abrupt All we wish to find in a clump of this kind is  proportion  and  general form  With respect to  proportion  the detached clump must not incroach too much on the dignity of the wood it aids but must observe a proper subordination A large tract of country covered with wood will admit several of these auxiliary clumps of different dimensions But if the wood be of a smaller size the clumps also must be smaller and fewer  With regard to the  general form  of the larger clump we observed that in a  single  tree we expected elegance in the  parts  In the  smaller clumps  this idea was relinquished and in it's room we expected a  general contrast  in trunks branches and foliage But as the clump becomes larger and recedes in the landscape all these pleasing contrasts are lost and we are satisfied with a  general form  No  regular  form is pleasing A clump on the side of a hill or in any situation where the eye can more easily investigate it's shape must be circumscribed by an irregular line in which it is required that the undulations both at the base and summit of the clump should be strongly marked as the eye probably has a distinct view of both But if it be seen only on the top of a hill or along the distant  horizon as in these situations the base is commonly lost in the varieties of the ground a little variation in the line which forms the summit so as to break any disagreeable regularity there will be sufficient  As a large tract of wood requires a few large clumps to connect it gently with the plain so these large clumps themselves require the same service from a single tree or a few trees according to their size  These observations respect chiefly the vast scenes of nature which are but little under the controul of art While they assist us however in judging of the natural scene they are in many respects applicable to the em∣bellished one To the painters use they are most adapted whose business it is to introduce his trees in the happiest manner whether he spread them over his canvas in vast woods or break them into  smaller  or  larger combi∣nations  SECT II  FROM  clumps  we naturally proceed to  parkscenery  which is generally composed of  combinations of clumps  interspersed with lawns It is seldom composed of any large district of wood which is the characteristic of forestscenery  The park which is a species of landscape little known except in England is one of the noblest appendages of a great house Nothing gives a mansion so much dignity as these home demeisns nor contributes more to mark it's consequence A great house in a course of years naturally acquires space around it A noble park therefore is the natural appendage of an ancient mansion  To the size and grandeur of the house the park should be proportioned  Blenheimcastle  with a paddock around it or a small  villa in the middle of Woodstockpark would be equally out of place  The house should stand nearly in the centre of the park that is it should have ample room about it on every side Petworthhouse one of the grandest piles in England loses much of it's grandeur from being placed at the extremity of the park where it is elbowed by a churchyard  The  exact spot  depends intirely on the ground There are grand situations of various kinds In general houses are built first and parks are added afterwards by the occasional removal of inclosures A great house stands most nobly on an elevated knoll from whence it may overlook the distant country while the woods of the park skreen the regularity of the intervening cultivation Or it stands well on the side of a valley which winds along it's front and is adorned with wood or a natural stream hiding and discovering itself among the clumps at the bottom of the vale Or it stands with dignity as Longleat does in the centre of demeisns which shelve gently down to it on every sideEven on a dead flat I have seen a house draw beauties around it At the seat of the late Mr Bilson Legge now  lord Stawel's in the middle of Holtforest a lawn unvaried by a single swell is yet varied with clumps of different forms receding behind each other in so pleasing a manner as to make an agreeable scene  By these observations I mean only to shew that in whatever part of a park a house may have been originally placed it can hardly have been placed so awkwardly but that in some way or other the scenery may be happily adapted to it There are some situations indeed so very untoward that scarce any remedy can be applied as when the front of a house immediately urges on a rising ground But such awkward situations are rare and in general the variety of landscape is such that it may almost always be brought in one form or other to serve the purposes of beauty The many improvements of the ingenious Mr Brown in various parts of England bear witness to the truth of these observations The beauty however of parkscenery is un∣doubtedly  best  displayed on a  varied surface  where the ground swells and fallswhere hanging lawns skreened with wood are con∣nected with valliesand where one part is continually playing in contrast with another  As the park is an appendage of the house it follows that it should participate of it's neatness and elegance Nature in all her great walks of landscape observes this accom∣modating rule She seldom passes abruptly from one mode of scenery to another but generally connects different species of landscape by some third species which participates of both A mountainous country rarely sinks immediately into a level one the swellings and heavings of the earth grow gradually less Thus as the house is connected with the country through the medium of the park the park should partake of the neatness of the one and of the wildness of the other  As the park is a scene either planted by art or if naturally woody artificially improved we expect a beauty and contrast in it's  clumps  which we do not look for in the wild scenes of nature We expect to see it's lawns and their appendages contrasted with each other in shape size and disposition from which a variety of artificial scenes will arise We expect that when trees are left standing as  individuals  they should be the most beautiful of their kind elegant and wellbalanced We expect that all offensive trumpery and all the  rough luxuriance of undergrowth should be removed unless where it is necessary to thicken or connect a scene or hide some staring boundary In the wild scenes of nature we have grander exhibitions but greater defor∣mities than are generally met with in the works of art As we seldom meet with these sublime passages in improved landscape it would be unpardonable if any thing disgusting should appear  In the parkscene we wish for no expensive ornament Temples Chinesebridges obe∣lisks and all the laboured works of art suggest inharmonious ideas If a bridge be necessary let it be elegantly plain If a deershed or a keeper's lodge be required let the fashion of each be as simple as it's use Let nothing appear with ostentation or paradeWithin restrictions however of this kind we mean not to include piles of  superior grandeur  Such a palace as Blenheimcastle distributes it's great∣ness far and wide There if the bridge be immense or the obelisk superb it is only what we naturally expect It is the chain of ideas properly carried on and  gradually lost  My remarks regard only such houses as may  be rich indeed and elegant but have nothing in them of  superior magnificence  One ornament of this kind I should be in∣clined to allow and that is a handsome gate at the entrance of the park but it should be proportioned in richness and elegance to the house and should also correspond with it in stile It should raise the first impression of what you are to expect Warwickcastle re∣quires a mode of entrance very different from lord Scarsdale's at Kettlestone and Burleighhouse very different from both The parkgate of Sionhouse is certainly elegant but it raises the idea of a stile of architecture which you must drop when you arrive at the house  The road also through the park should bear the same proportion It should be spacious or moderate like the house it approaches Let it wind but let it not take any deviation which is not well accounted for To have the convenience of winding along a valley or passing a commodious bridge or avoiding a wood or a piece of water any traveller would naturally wish to deviate a little and obstacles of this kind if necessary must be interposed Mr Brown was often very happy in creating these artificial obstructions  From every part of the approach and from the ridings and favourite walks about the park let all the boundaries be secreted A view of paling tho in some cases it may be picturesque is in general disgusting  If there be a  natural  river or a real ruin in the scene it may be a happy circumstance let the best use be made of it but I should be cautious in advising the  creation  of either At least I have rarely seen either ruins or rivers well manufactured Mr Brown I think has failed more in rivermaking than in any of his attempts An artificial lake has sometimes a good effect but neither pro∣priety nor beauty can arise from it unless the heads and extremities of it are perfectly well managed and concealed and after all the success is hazardous You must always sup∣pose it a portion of a larger piece of water and it is not easy to carry on the imposition If the house be magnificent it seldom receives much benefit from an artificial production of this kind Grandeur is rarely produced  Seldom art  Can emulate that magnitude sublime  Which spreads the native lake and failing there  Her works betray their character and name  And dwindle into pools  The most natural inhabitants of parks are fallow deer and very beautiful they are but flocks of sheep and herds of cattle are more useful and in my opinion more beautiful Sheep particularly are very ornamental in a park Their colour is just that dingy hue which contrasts with the verdure of the ground and the flakiness of their wool is rich and picturesque I should wish them however to wear their natural livery and not to be patched with letters and daubed over with redochre To see the side of a hill spread with groups of sheepor to see them through openings among the boles of trees at a little distance with a gleam of light falling upon them is very picturesque  As the garden or  pleasureground  as it is commonly called approaches nearer to the house than the park it takes of course a higher polish Here the lawns are shorn instead of being grazed The roughness of the road is changed into an elegant gravel walk and knots of flowers and flowering shrubs are introduced yet blended with clumps of foresttrees which connect it with the park Single trees also take their station here with  great propriety The spreading oak or elm are no disgrace to the most ornamented scene It is the property of these noble plants to harmonize with every species of landscape They equally become the forest and the lawn only here they should be beautiful in their kind and luxuriant in their growth Neither the scathed nor the unbalanced oak would suit a polished situation  Here too if the situation suits it the elegant temple may find a place But it is an expen∣sive a hazardous and often a useless decoration If more than one however be introduced in the same view they croud the scene unless it be very extensive More than two should in no case be admitted In the most polished land∣scape unless nature and simplicity lead the way the whole will be deformed  SECT III  FROM scenes of art let us hasten to the chief object of our pursuit the wild scenes of naturethe  wood  the  copse  the  glen  and  opengrove  Under the term  wood  we include every extensive combination of foresttrees in  a state of nature  All such combinations tho without the privilege of forests compose the same kind of scenery The description therefore of such scenes will come most properly under the head of  forestviews  on which we shall hereafter dwell at large At present let us examine the smaller combinations and first the  copse  The  copse  is a species of scenery composed commonly of foresttrees intermixed with brushwood which latter is periodically cut down in twelve thirteen or fourteen years In its dismantled state therefore nothing can be more  forlorn than the copse The area is covered with bare roots and knobs from which the brushwood has been cut while the foresttrees intermingled among them present their ragged stems despoiled of all their lateral branches which the luxuriance of the sur∣rounding thickets had choked  In a very short time however all this injury which the copse hath suffered is repaired One winter only sees its disgrace The next summer produces luxuriant shoots and two summers more restore it almost to perfect beauty  It matters little of what species of wood the copse is composed for as it seldom at best exhibits a scene of picturesque beauty we rarely expect more from it than a shady sequestered path which it generally furnishes in great perfection It is among the luxuries of nature to retreat into the cool recesses of the fullgrown copse from the severity of a meridian sun and to be serenaded by the hum∣ming insects of the shade whose continuous song has a more refreshing sound than the buzzing vagrant fly which wantons in the glare of day and as Milton expresses it  winds her sultry horn  In distant landscape the copse hath seldom any effect The beauty of wood in a distant view arises in some degree from it's tuftings which break and inrich the lightsbut chiefly from it's contrast with the plainand from the grand shapes and forms occasioned by the retiring and advancing parts of the forest which produce vast masses of light and shade and give effect to the whole  These beauties appear rarely in the copse Instead of that rich and tufted bed of foliage which the distant forest exhibits the copse presents a meagre and unaccommodating sur∣face It is age which gives the tree it's tufted form and the forest it's effect A nursery of saplings produce it not and the copse is little more Nor does the intermix∣ture of fullgrown trees assist the appearance Their clumpy heads blend ill with the spiry tops of the juniors Neither have they any connection with each other The woodman's judgment is shewn in leaving the timbertrees at proper intervals that they may neither hinder each other's growth nor the growth of the underwood But the woodman does not pretend to manage his trees with a view to picturesque beauty and from his manage∣ment  it is impossible they should produce a mass of light and shade  Besides the copse forms no contrast with the plain nor presents those beautiful pro∣jections and recesses which the skirts of the forest exhibit A copse is a plot of ground portioned off for the purpose of nurturing wood Of course it must be fenced from cattle and these fences which are in them∣selves disgusting generally form the copse into a square a rhomboid or some other regular figure so that we have not only a deformity but a want also of a connecting tye between the wood and the plain Instead of a softened undulating line we have a harsh fence  The best effect which the copse produces is on the lofty banks of a river I have the Wye particularly in my view In navigating such a river the deficiences of this mode of scenery as you view it upwards from a boat are lost and in almost every state it has a good effect While it inriches the bank it's un∣couth shape unless the fence is too much in view and all it's other unpleasant appearances are concealed  When a winding walk is carried through a copse which must necessarily in a course of  years even in point of picturesque beauty be given to the axeshall the whole be cut down together Or shall a border be left as is sometimes done on each side of the walk  This is a difficult question but I think all should go together Unless the border you leave be very broad it will have no effect even at present You will see through it it will appear meagre and will certainly never unite happily with the neighbouring parts when they begin to grow At least let it not stand longer than two years The rest of the copse will then be growing beautiful and the border may be dispensed with till it is replaced But the best way certainly is if you have courage to cut the whole down together In a little time as we observed above it will recover it's beauty  SECT IV  FROM the copse we proceed to the  glen  A wide open space between hills is called a  vale  If it be of smaller dimensions we call it a  valley  But when this space is contracted to a  chasm  it becomes a  glen  A glen therefore is most commonly the offspring of a mountainous country tho it is sometimes found elswhere with it's common accompa∣niments of woodybanks and a rivulet at the bottom These circumstances it is evident admit infinite variety The  glen  may be more or less contracted It may form one single sweep or it's deviations may be irregular The wood may consist of fullgrown trees or of underwood or of a mixture of both The path which winds through it may run along the upper part or the lower Or lastly the rivulet may foam among rocks or it may murmur  among pebbles or it may form transparent pools overhung with wood or which is often the case it may be totally invisible and an object only of the ear  The most beautiful circumstances that at∣tends the internal parts of a glen are the glades or openings which are found in it If the whole were a thicket like the  fullgrown copse  little beauty would result An agreeable shade alone in that case must satisfy our expecta∣tions But the glen whose furniture is com∣monly of more fortuitous growth than that of the copse and not so subject to periodical defalcations exhibits generally more beautiful scenery Particularly it abounds with frequent openings The eye is carried down from the higher grounds to a sweep of the riveror to a little gushing cascadeor to the face of a fractured rock garnished with hanging wood or perhaps to a cottage with it's scanty area of lawn falling to the river on one side and sheltered by a clump of oaks on the other while the smoke wreathing behind the trees disperses and loses itself as it gains the summit of the glen Or still more beautifully perhaps the eye breaks out at some opening into the country inriched with all the varieties of  distant landscapeplains and woods melting togethera winding riverblue mountains or perhaps some bay of the sea with a little harbour and shipping  As an object of distance also the woody glen has often a good effect climbing the sides of mountains breaking their lines and giving variety to their bleak and barren sides  In many places you see the glen under the hands of improvement and when you happen to have a scene of this kind near your house you cannot well have a more fortunate cir∣cumstance But great care should be taken not to load it with ornament Such scenes admit little art Their beauty consists in their natural wildness and the best rule is to add little but to be content with removing a few deformities and obstructions A good walk or a path there must be and the great art will consist in conducting it in the easiest and most natural way to the spot where the cascade the rock or any other object which the glen exhibits may be seen to the best advantage If a seat or two be thought neces∣sary let them be of the rudest materials and their situation no way forced I have often seen semicircular areas on these occasions  adapted to elegant seats which have been fixed either where openings happened to be presen∣ted or were purposely cut through the woods All this is awkward and disgusting Let no formal preparation introduce a view A parading preface always injures a story The eye receives more pleasure from the casual objects of it's own notice than from objects perhaps of more real beauty forced upon it with parade and ostentation  But tho we are averse to load these sweet recesses of nature with false ornaments yet if such scenes make a part of the  immediate environs  or  pleasure ground  of a house a proper degree of ornament will of course be required The walk must be more artificial it's borders may be spread here and there as in other decorated places with flowers and flowering shrubsthe seats may be more ele∣gant and a temple or other building may  perhaps  find a place but still the same chaste spirit must regulate here which presides over all other improvements To run into  excess in ornament  is one of the most obvious errors of false taste We frequently see the effect both of the  natural scene  and of the  artificial representation  destroyed merely by adorning  SECT V  AS the  glen  is sometimes found in the country we are about to describe it was necessary just to mention it as a distinct species of woodland scenery yet as it is not one of the common features of the country we shall dwell no longer upon it but hasten to the  open grove  The open grove is com∣posed of trees arising from a smooth area which may consist either of pines or of the deciduous race I have seen beautiful groves of both The pinegrove will always be dry as it is the peculiar quality of its leaves to suck up moisture but in lightness variety and general beauty the deciduousgrove excels If indeed you wish to compose your grove in the gloomy stile the pinerace will best serve your purpose  The opengrove seldom makes a picturesque appearance In  distant scenery  indeed it may have the effect of other woods for the trees of which it is formed need not be separated from each other as in the copse but being well massed together may receive beautiful effects of lightWhen we  enter its recesses  it is not so well calculated to please There it wants variety and that not only from the smoothness of the surface but from the uni∣formity of the furnitureat least if it be an artificial scene in which the trees having been planted in a nursery grow all alike with upright stems And yet a walk upon a velvet turf winding at pleasure among these natural columns whose twisting branches at least admit some variety with a spreading canopy of foliage over the head is pleasing and in hot weather refreshing Sometimes we find the opengrove of  natural growth  It is then more various and irregular and be∣comes of course a more pleasing scene And yet when woods of this kind continue as they sometimes do in unpeopled countries through half a province they become tiresome and prove that it is not wood but variety of landscape that delights the eye  Sometimes the grove in the neighbourhood of great houses demands a little embellishment and as it is naturally less rude than the glen it is therefore more patient of improvement A seat or a temple according to the size and situation of the place may here be a proper ornament But if the turf be neat tho we do not often find it so under trees or close grazed with sheep or deer no artificial walks are necessary If the scene command no distant landscape nor any view of consequence at hand it will require in itself a greater share of ornament But still simplicity must be the leading ideaOne thing is absolutely neces∣sary to compleat the idea of a grove which is that its boundaries should be concealed It is intended for a sequestered place and should answer that idea  I remember meeting with an ornamented scene of this kind which was very pleasing The grove extended along the brow of a gentle declivity and assumed from that circumstance a dark close gloomy appearance in its deeper recesses tho its opening on the lawn was light and airy and agreeably connected with the ground In the front of the grove stood a rude temple of Pan and the lawn being a  neat sheepwalk the whole tho highly po∣lished was characteristic harmonious and beautiful  The pleasing tranquility of groves hath ever been in high repute among the innocent and refined part of mankind  Groves were planted to console at noon  The pensive wanderer in their shades At eve  The moonbeam sliding softly in between  The sleeping leaves is all the light he wants  For meditation  Indeed no species of landscape is so fitted for meditation The forest attracts the attention by it's grandeur and the parkscene by it's beauty while the paths through copses dells and thickets are too close devious interrupted and often too beautiful to allow the mind to be at perfect rest But the uniform sameness of the grove leaves the eye disengaged and the feet wandering at pleasure where they are confined by no path want little direction The mind therefore undis∣turbed has only to retire within itself Hence the philosopher the devotee the poet all retreated to these quiet recesses and  from the world retired  Conversed with angels and immortal forms  In classic times the grove was the haunt of Gods  Habitarunt dii quoque sylvas  And in the days of nature before art had introduced a kind of combination against her man had no idea of worshipping God in  a temple made with hands  The  templum nemorale  was the only temple he knew  In the resounding wood  All vocal beings hymned their equal God  And to this idea indeed one of the earliest forms of the  artificial temple  seems to have been indebted Many learned men  See a note in Bp Warburton's edition of Pope's epist to lord Burlington  have thought the Gothic arch of our cathedralchurches was an imitation of the natural grove It arises from a lofty stem or from two or three stems if they be slender which being bound together and spreading in every direc∣tion cover the whole roof with their ramifi∣cation In the close recesses of the beechengrove  we find this idea the most compleat The lofty narrow ailethe pointed archthe clustered pillar whose parts separating without violence diverge gradually to form the fretted roof find there perhaps their earliest archetype  Groves too were the scenes of superstition as well as of religion Here the priests of Baal performed their prophane rites and here the backsliding Israelites used often to skreen their idolatries The strong ideas of superstition which these gloomy retreats impressed upon the ignorance of early ages are finely touched by Virgil The passage I allude to is in the eighth book where the story of Evander is introduced The whole country was then as unpeopled countries commonly are a mere forest and as the groves and woods presented themselves on every side the venerable chief describing each scene to his illustrious guest annexes to it some tale of horror or some cir∣cumstance of religious awe  Hinc lucum ingentem quem Romulus acer asylum  Rettulit et gelidâ monstrat sub rupe Lupercal  Parrhafio dictum Panos de more Lycaei  Nec non et sacri monstrat nemus

May give a useful lesson to the head  And learning wiser grow without it's books  Knowledge and wisdom far from being one  Have ofttimes no connection Knowledge dwells  In heads replete with thoughts

and rivulets and haunts of deer  And sheepwalks populous with bleating lambs  And groves in which the primrose e'er her time  Peeps through the moss that cloaths the hawthorn root  Deceive no student Wisdom there and truth  Not shy as in the world and to be won  By slow solicitation seize at once  The roving thought and fix it on themselves  SECT VI  HAVING thus considered various kinds of woody scenery and traced the peculiar beauties of each we proceed next to the  forest  which in a manner comprehends them all There are few extensive forests which do not contain in some part or other a specimen of every species of woodylandscape The wild forestview indeed differs essentially from the embellished one tho sometimes we find even the forestlawn in a polished state when browzed by deer into a fine turf and sur∣rounded by stately woods  Beauty  however is not the characteristic of the forest It's peculiar distinction is  grandeur  and  dignity  The scenes we have hitherto considered are all within the reach of art and in fact have all been the objects of improvement But the forest disdains all human culture On it the  hand of nature only is impressed The forest like other beautiful scenes  pleases the eye  but it's great effect is to  rouse the imagination  The word  forest  immediately suggests the idea of a  continued uninterrupted tract of woody country  But forests in general are much more varied They consist indeed of tracts of woody country but these tracts are at the same time intermixed with patches of pasturage which commonly bear the same proportion to the woods of the forest which lawns do to the clumps of a parkThese intermingled scenes of wood and pasturage are again divid∣ed from other intermixtures of the same kind by wide heaths which are sometimes bounded by a naked line of horizon but more fre∣quently skirted with wood This intermixture of wood and pasturage with large separations of heath give a variety to the forest which a boundless continuance of woody scenery could not exhibit tho it must be acknowledged that in many forests and especially in Newforest these tracts of heathy country are often larger than picturesque beauty requires  Having given this  general idea  of the species of country which I mean to treat of under  the idea of a  forest  I shall proceed to parti∣culars Let me just recall to the reader's memory what was observed before that all  great woods  diversified as forests are tho not properly denominated  forests  as not subject to  forestlaws  will however naturally fall under the description of forestscenery  See page    The forest under the division of  wood pas∣turage  and  heath  presents itself to us as a picturesque object in a double viewas the scenery of a  foreground  and as the scenery of a  distance  In both views it is equally an object of picturesque beauty but as it's effects are different in each I shall endeavour to deli∣neate their respective beauties  When we speak of forestscenery as a  foreground  we mean the appearance which it's woods present when we approach their skirts or invade their recesses Forests in their nature are woods  ab origine  not  newly planted  but  natural  woods  set apart  for the purposes of sheltering and securing game The trees  therefore of which these natural woods are composed consist of all ages and sizes from the ancient fathers of the forest to the scion and the seedling They grow also in that wild disordered manner which nature pre∣scribes as the root casually runs which throws up the scion or as the seed or acorn finds soil and room to establish itself and increase But tho the richness of the scenery depends greatly on this multifarious mixture which masses and fills up all the va∣rious combinations yet the most ancient trees of each species are the glory of sylvan landscape Young trees tho even in distant views inferior to old will however in that situation exhibit a better appearance than on the spot where no forestscenery can fill the eye without a proper assemblage of such trees as have seen ages pass over them These form those bold and rough exhibitions in which the pride and dignity of  forestviews  consist We have already observed that the wild and rough parts of nature produce the strongest effects on the imagination and we may add they are the only objects in landscape which please the picturesque eye Every thing trim and smooth and neat affects it coolly Pro∣priety  brings us to acquiesce in the elegant and welladapted embellishments of art but the painter who should introduce them on canvas would be characterized as a man void of taste and utterly unacquainted with the objects of picturesque selectionSuch are the great materials which we expect to find in the skirts and internal parts of the forest trees of every kind but particularly the oldest and roughest of eachWe examine next the  mode  of scenery which results from their combinations  In speaking of the glen  See page  we observed that the principal beauty of it arose from those little openings or glades with which it commonly abounds It is thus in the forestwoods The great beauty of these  close scenes  arise from the openings and recesses which we find among them  By these I do not mean the  lawns  and  pasturage  which I mentioned as one of the great divisions of forestscenery  See page  but merely those little openings among the trees which are produced by various circumstances A  sandy bank or a piece of rocky ground may prevent the contiguity of trees and so make an opening or a tree or two may have been blasted or have been cut down or what is the happiest of all circumstances a winding road may run along the woodThe simple idea which is varied through all these little recesses is the exhibition of a few trees just seen behind others The varieties of this mode of scenery simple as it is are infinite Nature is wonderfully fertile The invention of the painter may form a  composition  more agreeable to the rules of his art than nature commonly produces but no invention can reach the varieties of  particular objects  Swanewelt and Waterlo delighted in these  close forestscenes  They penetrated their re∣treats and when they found a little opening or recess that pleased them they fixed it on the spot They studied it's various forms how the bold portuberances of an old trunk received the light and shadehow easily the large boughs parted and how negligently the smaller were interwovenhow elegantly the foliage hung and what various shapes it's little tuftings exhibited All these things they observed and copied with exact attention  Their landscape bare of objects and of the simplest composition had little to recommend it but the observance of the minutiae of nature These they characterized with truth and these alone have given a value to their works This praise however is chiefly Waterlo's  On the other hand Claude Pousin Sal∣vator and other masters who exhibited nature  more at large  took greater liberties Their landscapes were generally carried into remote distance and the beauty of their extensive scenes depended more on  composition  and  general effect  than on the exact resemblance of  particular objects  But the scenery of the internal parts of a forest is not merely confined to trees There is often an opportunity of introducing a little more variety The sandy bank mentioned above the piece of rocky ground or the wind∣ing road are sometimes found in forests and are always introduced with good effect Some of the best of Waterlo's scenes are indebted to these circumstances for their beauty  A pool of water too is a lucky incident When it is shrouded with trees and reflects from it's deep black mirror the mossy branches of an oak or other objects in it's neighbour∣hood  which have received a strong touch of sunshine it never fails to please But it must receive it's black hue from clearness Where a pool is the principal part of a little landscape the least muddiness or stain from clay or filth of any kind robs it of it's beauty  The green mantle of the standing pool  as Shakespear calls it hurts the eye exceedingly from it's ambiguous texture It possesses nei∣ther the character of land nor of water  Nor is the cottage which is often found in the woody scenes of the forest a circumstance without it's effect In  nature  at least it pleases nor only as the embellishment of a scene but as it shews us a dwelling where happiness may reside unsupported by wealth as it shews us a resource where we may still continue to enjoy peace tho we should be deprived of all the favours of fortune Yet on  canvas  where the forestview is formally introduced the cottage is an improper deco∣ration In nature the eye sated with a profusion of rich forestscenes often seizes even the humblest circumstance as an object of  relief But when a forestscene is  simply  and  formally  introduced it ought to appear like itself with the appendages of greatness There are seasons when a monarch may hold converse with the meanest of his subjects without injuring his dignity but it is not the season when he is seated on his throne A forestscene introduced in picture is intro∣duced with distinction and calls for every appendage of grandeur to harmonize with it The cottage offends It should be a castle a bridge an aquaduct or some other object that suits it's dignity  With regard to aquaducts indeed the Romans never suffered wood to grow near them lest it's roots or seeds should insinuate themselves into the crannies of the stone and injure the work But there can be no im∣propriety at this day in the introduction of a ruined aquaduct in a woody scene as trees of any magnitude may be supposed to have grown up since it had fallen to decay The scenery about the celebrated ruins of PontduGard in Languedoc is woody and the immediate environs of it have all the rich furniture at least they had lately that a painter would desire  Besides the foresttrees in which the dig∣nity of woodland scenery consists it is in∣riched by a variety of humble plants which filling up the interstices mass and connect the whole These however rude we only wish to remove when they straggle too far from the clumps with which they are con∣nected and appear as spots in the area or middle space between different combinations  A long catalogue might be given of these humble plants which are so useful in this harmonizing work but it would lead me into tedious detail The holly however should be distinguished in a general muster  See page  In many situations it appears to great advantage but particularly growing round the stem as it often does of some noble oak on the fore∣ground and filling up all the space to his lower boughs In summer it is a fine ap∣pendage and in autumn it's brilliant leaf and scarlet berry make a pleasing mixture with the wrinkled bark and hoary moss and auburn leaves of the venerable tree which it incirclesThe hawthorn too preforms the same office with good effect Tho as  a  single bush  it is sometimes offensive  See page  yet intangled with an oak or mixing with other trees it may be beautiful  Nor are  shrubs  alone useful in harmonizing the forest the larger kinds of  weeds  and wild flowers have their effect in filling up the smaller vacances near the ground and add to the richness of the whole Among these the heath and broom with their purple and yellow tints the foxglove with it's palered pendent bells the widespreading dock and many of the thistletribe are very beautiful The hue of the furze too is pleasant but in bloom it's luxuriant yel∣low is too powerful Nothing can accompany it  But among all the minuter plants fern is the most picturesque I do not mean where it is spread in quantities but where it is sparingly and judiciously introduced In itself it is beautiful We admire the form of it's leafit's elegant mode of hangingand it's darkbrown polished stem As an accom∣paniment also nothing is better suited to  unite the higher plants with the ground while it's brightgreen hue in summer and it's ochertint in autumn join each season with it's correspondent tinge  The poet indeed who with all his cant is sometimes a truant to nature pays in general very little attention to these rougher objects of beauty  His  foregrounds are com∣monly adorned with the livelier tints of nature  each beauteous flower  Iris all hues roses and jessamin  Crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay  Broidering the ground  And if he deign to speak of ground embellished with these rough picturesque beauties he disdainfully calls it a place where  nothing teems  But hateful docks rough thistles kecksies burs  Losing both beauty and utility  Of all this undergrowth I know but one plant that is disagreeable and that is the bramble We sometimes see it with effect scrawling along the fragments of a rock or running among the rubbish of a ruin tho  even then it is a coarse appendage But as a  pendent plant  it has no beauty It does not hang carelessly twisting round every support like the hop and others of the creeping tribe but forms one stiff unpliant curve Nor has it any foliage to recommend it In other pendent plants the leaf is generally luxuriant and hangs loosely in rich festoons but in the suckers of a bramble the leaf is harsh shrivelled and discoloured In short it is a plant which one should almost wish to have totally exterminated from landscape it has neither beauty in itself nor harmonizes with any thing around it and may be characterized as the most insignificant of all vegetable reptiles  But however beautiful these minuter plants and wild flowers may be in the natural scene yet no painter would endeavour to represent them with exactness They are too common too undignified and too much below his subject Instead of gaining the character of an exact copier of nature by a nice representation of such trifles he would be esteemed puerile and pedantic Fern per∣haps or dock if his piece be large he might condescend to imitate but if he  wanted a few touches of red or blue or yellow to enliven and inrich any particular spot in his foreground instead of aiming at the exact representation of any natural plant he will more judiciously give the tint he wants in a few random general touches of something like nature and leave the spectator if he please to find out a resemblance Botanical precision may please us in the flowerpieces of Van Huysom but it would be paltry and affected in the landscapes of Claude or SalvatorThe fol∣lowing remark I found in a work of Dr Johnson's which I transcribe not only be∣cause it is judicious and may be introduced here in place but because it affords a new argument to shew the resemblance be∣tween poetry and painting Johnson was a critic in the former but I never heard that he was a judge of the latter His opinion therefore in a point of this kind was unbiassed "The business of a poet says he is to examinenot the individual but the species to remark general and large appearances He does not number the streaks of the tulip nor describe the different shades in the verdure of the forest He is to exhibit in his portraits  of nature such prominent and striking features as recall the original to every mind and must neglect the minuter discriminations which one may have remarked and another have ne∣glected for those characteristics which are alike obvious to attention and carelessness"  Pr of Abyssin p  SECT VII  HAVING thus taken a view of the inter∣nal parts of a forest which consist chiefly of  foregrounds  we shall now consider the forest in a light just the reverse as con∣sisting chiefly of  distances  In both lights it is greatly picturesque and only more or less so in either as the eye is more pleased with a close or a diffusive landscape  We skirt and penetrate the recesses of the woods for the  closer view  but we frequent the forestlawn and heath for the  distant one  The beauty of those scenes especially of the heath which is a large surface depends it is true in a great degree on the play and irre∣gularities of the ground but chiefly it depends on the surrounding woods  The forestlawn  in itself  is a mere field It is only when adorned with the furniture of surrounding woods that it produces it's effect  The forestheath also when it is level and bounded only by the horizon has no charms for the eye When it consists of wellmixed inequalities of ground it gains somewhat more upon us But when it is bounded by woods in various parts and interspersed here and there with clumps which gently unite it's woody boundaries with it's area it becomes an interesting scene Sometimes also a variety of furze fern and other wild plants stain it in many parts with beautiful tints Often too a winding road passes through it or different roads traversing each other Herds of cattle also of different kinds continually frequent it's open plains and when these circumstances happily unite the heath becomes one of the beautiful scenes of the forest  As it is distant wood however on which the forestlawn and especially the forestheath depend for their principal aid I shall dwell a little on this copious subject and shall con∣sider it's most pleasing circumstances under the two headsof such as are  permanent  and such as are  incidental  But before I enter on the subject it may not be amiss to remind the reader once more  See p  that as the vast scenes of extensive forests which we are now considering as  distances  are not subject to art the idea of suggesting rules to  alter  and  improve  them is absurd All we mean is to endeavour to teach the eye to admire justly and to apply to  artificial  land∣scape those observations which occur in  natural  for the source of beauty is the same in both  Are  stretching along the Horizon▪ If it had been nearer the unvaried line would have been disagreable  An irregular summit with a regular base  An irregular base forming  ays    The summit regularly varied▪  SECT VIII  THE  permanent  beauties of a distant woody scene arise first from it's  form  There is as much variety in the form of a  distant wood  as in that of a single tree We sometimes see continuous woods stretching along the horizon without any break All seems of equal growth and the summit of the wood is contained under one strait line This except in very remote distance is formal heavy and disgusting The shape of distant woods is then only picturesque when it is broken by a varied line This variation is in some degree occasioned by the different size of trees but as the size of trees where the distance is great has little effect it is chiefly and most essentially occasioned by the inequalities of the ground  A regular line at the  base  of a long range of woodyscenery is almost as disgusting as at  the  summit  of it The woods must in some parts approach nearer the eye and in other parts retire forming the appearance of bays and promontories At least this is the most beautiful shape in which they appear as they sometimes do when the distance or the ine∣qualities of the ground do not prevent the eye from seeing the  base  of the wood As the  base  is connected with the ground it is commonly much more obscured than the  summit  which ranges along the sky  All square round picked or other formal shapes in distant woods are disgusting  There should not only be breaks but contrast also between the several breaks of a distant forestscene A line  regularly varied  disgusts as much as an unvaried one  Among the  permanent  beauties of distant woods may be reckoned also the various kinds of trees of which they are often composed Unless the distance be great this mixture has it's effect in the variety it produces both in form and colour Large bodies of fir also and other species of pines have often a rich appearance in a distance among deciduous  trees but they must be Scotchsirs pinasters clusterpines or other clumpheaded trees The spiryheaded race the sprucefir the silverfir and the Weymouthpine have here too as well as in the clump a bad effect Single they are sometimes beautiful or two or three of them here and there by way of contrast in large plantations may be pictu∣resque but I think they are never so in large bodies In general however the picturesque eye is little curious with regard to the kind of trees which compose a distant scene for there are few kinds which do not harmonize together It matters more in this bold stile of landscape that the masses of each different kind should be large The opposition is then strongly marked and the contrast striking and beautiful If different trees are grouped in  small  bodies the effect is totally lost in distance  The last species of  permanent  beauty which we take notice of in distant forestscenery arises from  works of art  We mean not the  embellishments of art  but such  rude works  as may almost be stiled the works of nature  the productions of convenience rather than of taste We certainly fetch the most picturesque objects from the grand storehouse of nature tho we condescend to admit  artificial  objects also but when they are admitted in this class they must always be of the rough rather than of the polished kind  Such objects we often meet with in the wild scenes of the forest spires towers lodges bridges cattlesheds cottages winding pales and other things of the same kind which have often as beautiful an effect when seen at a  distance  as we have just observed they have when sparingly met with in the internal parts of a forest Only the nearer the object is we expect it's form must be the more pic∣turesque Distance no doubt hides many defects and many an object may appear well in a remove which brought nearer would disgust the eye  SECT IX  HAVING thus considered what may pro∣perly be called the  permanent beauties of distant forestscenery  we proceed to it's  incidental beauties  These arise principally from two causes the  weather  and the  sea∣sons  As both are changeable they both produce various appearances The former affects chiefly the  sky  the latter the  earth  The  weather  is a fruitful source of  in∣cidental beauty  and there are few states of it which do not impress some peculiar and picturesque character on landscape to which it gives the leading tintA country is chiefly affected by the weather when it is  hazy  and  misty  or when the sky is invested  with some  cold tint  or when the sun  rises  or when it  shines full  at noonor when it  sets  or lastly when the day is  stormy  Each of these different states of the weather admits much variation but as it would be endless to trace these variations into detail I shall take notice only of the  general effects  of each and of these merely as they affect the forest In other works of this kind I have touched upon these sources of incidental beauty as they affect lakes and moun∣tains  See observations on the lakes of Cumberland and High∣lands of Scotland    The calm overcast soft day such as these climates often produce in the beginning of autumn hazy mild and undisturbed affords a beautiful medium spreading over the woods a s  eet grey tint which is es∣pecially favourable to their distant appearances The internal parts of the forest receive little advantages from this hazy medium but the various tuftings of distant woods are won∣derfully sweetened by it and many a form and many a hue which in the full glare of sunshine would be harsh and discordant  are softened and melted together in harmony We often see the effects of this mode of atmosphere in various species of landscape but it has no where a better effect than on the woods of the forest Nothing appears through mist more beautiful than trees a little removed from the eye when they are opposed to trees at hand for as the foliage of a tree consists of a great number of parts the contrast is very pleasing between the varied surface of the tree at hand and the dead unvaried appearance of the removed one  The lightmist is only a greater degree of haziness It's object is a  nearer distance  as a  remote  one is totally obscured by it In this situation of the atmosphere not only all the strong tints of nature are obscured but all the  smaller  variations of  form  are lost We look only for a general mass of softened harmony and sober colouring unmarked by any strength of effect The vivid hues of autumn particularly appear to great advan∣tage through this mediumSometimes these mists are partial and if they happen to coincide with the composition of the landscape this partiality is attended with peculiar beauty  I have remarked in other works of this kind  See observations on Scotland v ii p  that when some huge promontory emerges from a spreading mist which hangs over one part of it it not only receives the advantage of  contrast  but it also becomes an object of  double grandeur  We often see the woods of the forest also with peculiar advantage emerging through a mist in the same stile of greatnessI have known like∣wise a  nearer distance strongly illumined  produce a good effect through a light drizzling shower  Nearly allied to mists is another incidental appearance that of smoke which is often attended with peculiar beauty in woody scenes When we see it spreading in the forest glade and forming a soft bluish background to the trees which intercept it it shews their foliage and ramification to great ad∣vantage  Sometimes also a good effect arises when the sky under the influence of a bleak northwind cold and overcast is hung with blue or purple clouds lowering over the horizon If under that part of the atmosphere the  distant forest happens to range it is overspread with a deep blue or a purple tint from the reflection of the clouds and makes a very picturesque appearanceAnd yet I should be cautious in advising the painter to introduce it with that full strength in which he may sometimes perhaps observe it The appear∣ance of  blue  and  purple trees  unless in very remote distance offends and tho the artist may have authority from nature for his prac∣tice yet the spectator who is not versed in such effects may be displeased Painting like poetry is intended to excite pleasure and tho the painter with this view should avoid such images as are trite and vulgar yet he should seize those only which are easy and intelligible Neither poetry nor painting is a proper vehicle for the depths of learning The painter therefore will do well to avoid every  uncommon appearance  in nature  Within this caution however he will spread the prevailing tint of the day over his land∣scapeover his  whole  landsape Nature tinges all  her  pictures in this harmonious manner It is the greyish tint or it is the blue or it is the purple or it is one of the vivid tints of illumination red or yellowwhat∣ever  it be it blends with  all  the lights and shadows of the piece This great principle of harmony which arises from the reflection of colour in some degree even when the air is diaphanous must be observed by every painter who wishes to procure an effect His picture must be painted from  one pallet  and one key as in music must prevail through his whole composition As the air however is the vehicle of all these tints it is evident that in distances in which we see through a deeper medium of tinged air they will prevail most and of course very little on foregrounds The painter must observe this rule of nature by bringing his tints regularly forward and his foregrounds he must com∣pose of such colours mute or vivid as accord best with the general hue of his landscape Yet still he will be cautious how he spreads even the prevailing tint too strongly Much error hath arisen from this source and some painters under the idea of harmonizing have given us blue and purple pictures I know not whether Poussin himself did not sometimes fall into this fault Nature's veil is always pure and transparent yet tho in itself hardly discoverable it will still give it's kindred  tinge to the features which are seen through it  We have now considered  incidental beauty  as arising from the  colder  modifications of the air We use the word  colder  not in a physical but in a picturesque sense as productive only of  sober colouring  unattended with any force of effectWe come now to a more illustrious family of tints the offspring of the sun These are fertile sources of  incidental beauty  among the woods of the forest The characteristic of them is  strong effect  Let us first examine the incident of a  rising sun  The first dawn of day exhibits a beautiful obscurityWhen the east begins just to brighten with the reflections only of effulgence a pleasing progressive light dubious and amusing is thrown over the face of things A single ray is able to assist the picturesque eye which by such slender aid creates a thousand imaginary forms if the scene be unknown and as the light steals gradually on is amused by correcting it's vague ideas by the real objects What in the confusion of twilight perhaps seemed a stretch of rising  ground broken into various parts becomes now vast masses of wood and an extent of forest  As the sun begins to appear above the hori∣zon another change takes place What was before only  form  being now inlightened begins to receive  effect  This effect depends on two circumstances the  catching lights  which touch the summits of every object and the  mistiness  in which the rising orb is commonly inveloped  The effect is often pleasing when the sun rises in  unsullied brightness  diffusing its ruddy light over the upper parts of objects which is contrasted by the deeper shadows below yet the effect is then only transcendent when he rises accompanied by a train of vapors in a misty atmosphere Among lakes and mountains this happy accompaniment often forms the most astonishing visions and yet in the forest it is nearly as great With what delightful effect do we sometimes see the sun's disk just appear above a woody hill or in Shakespear's language  stand tiptoe on the misty mountain's top  and dart his diverging rays through the rising vapour The radiance catching the tops of  the trees as they hang midway upon the shaggy steep and touching here and there a few other prominent objects imperceptibly mixes its ruddy tint with the surrounding mists setting on fire as it were their upper parts while their lower skirts are lost in a dark mass of varied confusion in which trees and ground and radiance and obscurity are all blended together When the eye is fortu∣nate enough to catch the glowing instant for it is always a vanishing scene it furnishes an idea worth treasuring among the choicest appearances of natureMistiness alone we have observed occasions a confusion in objects which is often picturesque but the glory of the vision depends on the glowing lights which are mingled with it  Landscapepainters in general pay too little attention to the discriminations of morning and evening We are often at a loss to dis∣tinguish in pictures the rising from the setting sun tho their characters are very different both in the lights and shadows The ruddy lights indeed of the evening are more easily distinguished but it is not perhaps always suf∣ficiently observed that the shadows of the evening are much less opaque than those of the morning  They may be brightened perhaps by the numberless rays floating in the atmosphere which are incessantly reverberated in every direction and may continue in action after the sun is set Whereas in the morning the rays of the preceding day having subsided no object receives any light but from the immediate lustre of the sun Whatever be∣comes of the theory the fact I believe is well ascertained  The  incidental beauties  which the  meridian sun  exhibits are much fewer than those of the  rising sun  In summer when he rides high at noon and sheds his  perpendicular  ray all is illumination there is no shadow to balance such a glare of light no contrast to oppose it The judicious artist therefore rarely represents his objects under a vertical sun And yet no species of landscape bears it so well as the scenes of the forest The tuftings of the treesthe recesses among themand the lighter foliage hanging over the darker may all have an effect under a meridian sun I speak chiefly however of the  internal scenes  of the forest which bear such  total brightness  better than any other as in them there is generally a  natural gloom  to balance it The  light obstructed by close intervening trees will rarely predominate Hence the effect is often fine A strong sunshine striking a wood through some fortunate chasm and reposing on the tuftings of a clump just removed from the eye and strengthened by the deep shadows of the trees behind appears to great advantage especially if some noble tree standing on the foreground in deep shadow flings athwart the sky it's dark branches here and there illumined with a splendid touch of light  In an  open country  the most fortunate cir∣cumstance that attends a meridian sun is  cloudy weather  which occasions  partial lights  Then it is that the distant forestscene is spread with lengthened gleams while the other parts of the landscape are in shadow The tuftings of trees are particularly adapted to catch this effect with advantage There is a richness in them from the strong opposition of light and shade which is wonderfully fine A distant forest thus illumined wants only a foreground to make it highly pictu∣resque  As the sun  descends  the effect of it's illumi∣nation becomes stronger It is a doubt  whether the rising or the setting sun is more picturesque The great beauty of both depends on the contrast between splendor and obscu∣rity But this contrast is produced by these different incidents in different ways The grandest effects of the rising sun are produced by the vapors which invelop it The setting sun rests it's glory on the gloom which often accompanies it's parting rays A depth of shadow hanging over the eastern hemisphere gives the beams of the settingsun such power∣ful effect that altho in fact they are by no means equal to the splendor of a meridian sun yet through force of contrast they appear superior  A distant forestscene under this brightened gloom is particularly rich and glows with double splendor The verdure of the summer leaf and the varied tints of the autumnal one are all lighted up with the most resplendent colours  The internal parts of the forest are not so happily disposed to catch the effects of a settingsun The meridian ray we have seen may dart through the openings at the top and produce a picture  See page  but the flanks of the  forest are generally too well guarded against it's horizontal beams Sometimes a recess fronting the west may receive a beautiful light spreading in a lengthened gleam amidst the gloom of the woods which surround it but this can only be had in the outskirts of the forest Sometimes also we find in it's internal parts tho hardly in it's deep recesses splendid lights here and there catching the foliage which tho in nature generally too scattered to produce an effect yet if judiciously col∣lected may be beautiful on canvas  We sometimes also see in a woody scene coruscations like a bright star occasioned by a sunbeam darting through an eyelethole among the leaves Many painters and espe∣cially Rubens have been fond of introducing this radiant spot in their landscapes But in painting it is one of those trifles which pro∣duces no  effect  nor can this  radiance  be given In poetry indeed it may produce a pleasing image Shakespear hath introduced it beautifully where speaking of the force of truth entring a guilty conscience he com∣pares it to the sun which  fires the proud tops of the eastern pines  And darts his light through every guilty hole  It is one of those circumstances which poetry may offer to the  imagination  but the pencil cannot well produce to the  eye  and if it could it were better omitted as it attracts the eye from what is more interesting  Under the sameness of Italian skies the beauties of a settingsun are hardly known There the radiant orb courses his way with equal splendor from one end of the hemisphere to the other Nothing refracts his beam To the vapours of grosser climates we owe those beautiful tints which accompany his whole journey through the skies but especi∣ally his parting ray  Thus far the sources of incidental beauty are all derived from  milder skies  But the turbu∣lence of the atmosphere is still a more fruitful source of picturesque effect in the forest as in other scenes Unaided indeed by sunshine the storm has little power But when the force of the tempest separates the clouds into large dark convex forms and the rays of the sun stream from behind them athwart a clear horizon if the objects correspond a very sublime picture is exhibited  No master was better acquainted with these circumstances than the younger Vandervelt In all his seastorms he avails himself of them and is remarkable for the grand masses of light and shade which he pro∣duces  The landstorm is equally a source of beauty When the tempest scowls over the forest as we traverse it's deep recesses what grandeur do the internal parts of it receive from the casual ray darting upon them Or when we view it as a distant object and see the storm blackening behind trees with what wonderful effect does the sun in an opposite direction strike their tufted heads But if that sun be setting while the tem∣pest is brewing over the hemisphere black towards the eastluridmore purpleand glowing with red as it advances towards the westthen it is that the utmost value is given to it's  effect  The castle the lake or the forestscene whether viewed in shadow against the ruddy light or illumined under the storm appear in full grandeur and we see all that light and shade in extreme contention yet fully harmonized can pro∣duce  Vain are the hopes by colouring to display  The bright effulgence of the noontide ray  Or paint the fullorbed ruler of the skies  With pencils dipt in dull terrestrial dies  But when mild evening sheds her golden light  When morn appears arrayed in modest white  When soft suffusions of the vernal shower  Dims the pale sun or at the thund'ring hour  When wrapt in crimson clouds he hides his head  Then catch the glow and on the canvas spread  I know no appearance indeed in nature that is more awfully grand than the con∣junction of a storm and a sunset on some noble mass of forestscenery We may easily conceive that ignorance and superstition might magnify such a resplend  nt gloom into some∣thing supernatural In a passage which I lately quoted from Virgil an idea of this kind is very picturesquely as well as poetically introduced It is in the interview between Aeneas and Evander when the old chief informs his noble guest that frequently in tempests the simple Arcadians believed they saw heavenly forms behind the groves of the Tarpeian rock  Hoc nemus hunc inquit frondoso vertice collem  Quis deus incertum est habitat deus Arcades ipsum  Credunt se vidisse Jovem  cum saepe nigrantem  Aegida concuteret dextra nimbosque cieret  As these great effects are certainly the most picturesque of all aerial appearances it is rather surprizing that landscapepainters in general make so little use of them It is much more common to see landscape painted under the uniform brightness of an equal light than to see it illumined by these grand circumstances of the atmosphere in which light and shade are so happily combined  The landscapepainter says that effects like these are uncommon and he chooses to paint nature as he generally sees her  The idea is good but certainly these effects are common enough to have been often the object of  every one's  observation He will not I suppose take the commonest  objects  as he finds them And if he select his  objects  why not the  most beautiful mode of exhibiting them  The great effects of morn∣ing and evening suns of mists and storms are not more uncommon than natural com∣binations of beautiful objectsBut the real truth seems to be that such effects are the most difficult to manage and require great  study and observation The artist therefore who paints for his bread rather than his character an evil attending the art which can never be removed chooses such an ex∣hibition of light and shade as is the most easy to himself and may likewise be most pleasing to the generality of his undistin∣guishing employers Hence we have so great a number of glaring landscapes which depend on nothing but the beauty and colouring of a few particular objects without any attention to those grand effects which make landscape by many degrees the most sublime and interesting  It is perhaps one of the great errors in painting as indeed it is in literary as well as in picturesque composition to be more attentive to the finishing of  parts  than to the production of a  whole  Whereas the master's great care should be first to contrive a  whole  and then to adapt the  parts  as artificially as he can I speak of  imaginary  landscape when he paints a  particular view  his management must be just the reverse He has the  parts  given him and he must form them into a  whole  as he can and this is often difficult  There is nothing however that tends so much to produce a whole as a proper dis∣tribution of light and shade which we best obtain when we can present our landscape under one of these grand effects of nature A common sunshine furnishes  lights  not  masses  It may throw a beautiful illumi∣nation on  particular objects  but the  grand effects of nature  furnish the best opportunities of forming the  masses of each  What gives the most grandeur to these effects is a  predominancy of shade  which has always more dignified ideas annexed to it than a  predominancy of light  And yet how little is this observed In the generality of pictures and prints you see the balance on the other side and are often offended with glaring spots of light which destroy the idea of a whole The painter should examine his piece therefore with great care He may put out one light after another and reviewing his work with a fresh eye may still find some glaring part to erase before he venture it abroad On this occasion he may apply with good sense and form into an adage a very nonsensical passage as it appears in Shakespear  Put out the lightand thenput out the light  If the artificial representation of  every  subject seems rather to require a balance of shade in  sublime subjects  it is still more required All writers on sublime subjects deal in shadows and obscurity  See Burke on the sublime  The grandeur of Jehovah is commonly represented by the Hebrew writers behind a cloud The imagination makes up deficiences by grander ideas than it is possible for the pencil to produce Many images owe much of their sublimity to their  indistinctness  and frequently what we call sublime is the effect of that heat and fermentation which ensues in the imagination from it's ineffectual efforts to conceive some dark obscure idea beyond it's grasp Bring the same within the compass of it's comprehension and it may continue  great  but it will cease to be  sublime  This speces of the  sublime  is oftener found in the composition of the poet than of the painter In general the poet has great ad∣vantages over the painter in the process of  sublimication  if the term may be allowed The business of the former is only to  excite ideas  that of the latter to  represent them  The advantage of excited over represented ideas is very great inasmuch as they are in some degree the reader's own production and are susceptible of those modifications which make them peculiarly acceptable to the mind in which they are raised Whereas the others being confined within a distinct and unal∣terable outline admit of none of the modi∣fications which flatter the particular taste of the spectator but must make their way by their own intrinsic force  SECT X  WE have now treated of the  incidental beauty  of forestscenery as arising from the  weather  we examine it next as arising from the  seasons  Each season hath beauties peculiar to itself  The early spring is not very favourable to the study of landscape Nature is yet unfold∣ing herself and is in her progress only to perfection The bloom of many trees gay and fantastic in it's colouring and form may be beautiful and curious in itself but is illadapted to harmonize and unite with other objects And yet we sometimes see tints which produce a pleasing effect The budding oak displays great variety Among neighbour∣ing oaks the bud of one is a tender green of another almost yellow of a third an osierbrown perhaps nearly inclining to red yet  each of these as it opens will probably accord harmoniously with the tint of it's neighbour But all trees have not the accommodating qualities of the oak the early shoots parti∣cularly of evergreens are seldom in harmony with the foliage of the parenttree  As summer advances the forest assumes a more determined and connected form The germs and leaves are all unfolded the hue of the foliage becomes harmonious the tuftings also of the trees are prepared as beds for masses of light to rest on which the spray and the bloom of early spring unconnected and un∣formed could not fully receive  So far we have gained by the progress of the year But the great objection to summer arises from the uniformity of it's hue The face of nature is covered with one unvaried mantle of green for tho the nicer eye may trace many shades in this general colour yet on the whole it is both too vivid and too uniform for the pencil  The reign of  summer  scarcely indures three months The leaves within that period begin to change their hue and give way to autumn which presents an appearance much more picturesque and indeed the most replete with  incidental beauty  of any season of the year This is so evident that painters have chosen the autumn with almost universal predilection as the season of landscape The leafy surface of the forest is at that time so varied and the masses of foliage are yet so full that they allow the artist great latitude in producing his tints without injuring the breadth of his lights  The fading manycoloured woods  Shade deepening over shade the country round  Imbrown a varied umbrage dusk and dun  Of every hue from wan declining green  To sooty dark  Yet the autumn in it's wane is not so pleasing It has too forlorn an aspect The leaves are withered and their tufts shrivelled and shapeless This remark however affects trees only at hand The homeplantation suffers where you walk so near the fading  tree as to see nature in decay but at a distance the withered effect is not easily discerned In the wane of autumn however there are other defects The ash and some other trees have deserted their station in the forest they have shed their leaves and left a cheerless blankBesides the verdure of the forest is too much wasted and the brown and yellow tints beautiful as they are become too predominant for the prevalence of these hues in autumn fatigues the eye no less than the prevalence of green in summer Only indeed the autumnal tints will ever be more varied But the intermediate time is the season of picturesque beauty when the greens and the browns and the yellows are blended together by a variety of  middle tints  which often create the most exquisite harmony  Of all the hues of autumn those of the oak are commonly the most harmonious As it's vernal tints are more varied than those of other trees so are it's autumnal In an oaken wood you see every variety of green and every variety of brown owing either to the different exposure of the tree it's different soil or it's different nature but it is not my business to enquire into causes  In the beechen grove you seek in vain for this variety In the early autumn indeed you see it when the extremities only of the tree are just tinged with ochre but as the year advances the eye is generally fatigued with one deep monotony of orange tho among all the hues of autumn it is in itself perhaps the most beautiful The painter imitates it the most happily by a touch of terra de Sienna But the eye is palled with beauty in profusion and calls for contrast  The same uniformity reigns tho of a dif∣ferent hue when ash or elm prevails No fading foliage indeed of any  one  kind that I know produces harmony except that of the oak  The hues however of the  distant forest  when most discordant are often harmonized by the intervening trees on the  foreground  We can bear the glow of the distant beechwood when it is contrasted at hand by a spreading oak whose foliage hath yet scarce lost it's summertintor by an elm or an ash whose fading leaves have assumed a yellowish hue  But after all the autumnal forest is an instrument easily untuned One frosty night or parching blast may introduce some  striking discord tho on the other hand it is true by softening some discordant tint it may as easily introduce a harmony which did not exist before Here art comes to the aid of nature The pencil fixes the scene in the happy moment and the fading tints of autumn become perennial  I have known some planters endeavour in their improvements to range their trees in such a manner as in the wane of the year to receive all the beauty of autumnal colouring The attempt is vain unless they could so command the weather as to check or produce at pleasure those tints which nature hath subjected to so many accidents A general direction is all that can be given Oak is rarely in discord but beech and elm can as rarely be depended on All must be left to chance and after the utmost that art can do the wild forest with it's casual discords and monotonies will present a thousand beauties which no skill of man can rival  Thus the beauties of the waning year are fixed rather by the weather than by the calendar We often see them vanish in octo∣ber and we sometimes see a fine autumnal effect in the beginning of november nay even later  we may trace the beauties of the declining year and  catch the last smile  Of autumn beaming o'er the yellow woods  Even when the beauty of the landscape is gone the charms of autumn may remain After the rage of summer is abated and before the rigours of winter are yet set in there are often days of such heavenly temperature that every mind must feel their effect Thompson to whom the beauties of nature were familiar thus describes a day of this kind  The morning shines  Serene in all it's dewy beauties bright  Unfolding fair the last autumnal day  O'er all the soul it's sacred influence breaths  Inflames imagination through the breast  Infuses every tenderness and far  Beyond dim earth exalts the swelling thought  To the picturesque beauties of autumn we may add that the sunsets at that season are commonly richer than when the days are of the same length in the spring or indeed at any other season  But the  leafy forest  is not solely the object of  incidental beauty  The picturesque eye finds  great amusement even in it's wintryscenes when it has thrown it's rich mantle aside and appears to the common eye naked and deformed  The hazy sunshine of a frosty morning is accompanied with an indistinctness peculiar to itself The common haziness of a sum∣merday spreads over the landscape one general grey tint and as we have had occasion to remark in different circumstances is often the source of great beauty But the effect we are here observing is of a different kind It is generally more partialmore richand mixing with streaks of different coloured clouds which often form behind it produces a very pleasing effect  Great beauty also arises from the different tints of the spray The dark brown spray of the birch for instance has a good effect among that of a lighter tinge and when the forest is deep all this little bushiness of ra∣mification hath in some degree the effect of foliage  The boles of trees likewise and all their larger limbs add a rich variety and contrast to the forest the smooth and the rough the light and the dark often beautifully op∣posing  each other In winter the  stem  pre∣dominates as the  leaf  in summer It is amusing in one season to see the branches losing and discovering themselves among the foliage and it is amusing also in the other to walk through the desolate forest and see the various combinations of stems the traversing of the branches across each other in so many beautiful directionsand the pains which nature takes in forming a  wood  as well as a  single tree  See page  She leaves no part unclosed but pushing in the branch or the spray as the opening allows she fills all vacant space by uniting the heads of the trees while every step we take presents us with some beautiful variety in her mode of forming the fretted roof under which we walk  In winter too the effect of evergreens is often pleasing The holly when it happens to be well combined and mixed in just proportion makes an agreeable contrast The ivy hanging round the oak if it be not too profuse we have already observed is a beau∣tiful  appendage to it's grandeur I have seen some parts of the forest where the stem of almost every tree was covered with it This indeed was not picturesque but it gave the wood a very odd appearance by exhibiting so total an inversion of nature In summer the tops of the trees are green and their stems commonly bare Here the tops were bare while the stems were in full leaf  In a light hoarfrost before the sun and air begin to shake the powder from the trees the wintry forest is often beautiful and almost exhibits the effect of tufted foliageAs single objects also trees under this circum∣stance are curious The black branches whose undersides are not covered with rime often make a singular contrast with the whitened spray Trees of minuter ramifi∣cation and foliage as the beech the elm and the fir appear under this circumstance to most advantage The ash the horsechesnut and other plants of coarser form have no great beautyTrees also thus covered with hoarfrost have sometimesif not a picturesqueat least an uncommon effect when they appear against a lurid cloud  especially when the sun shines strongly upon them  But altho many appearances in winter are beautiful and amusing and some of them even picturesque yet the judicious painter will rarely introduce them in landscape because he has choice of more beautiful effects when nature appears dressed to more advan∣tage  Picturesque pleasure arises from two sources from the  beauty and combination of the objects  represented and from the  exactness of the representation  Thus we are pleased with the picture of a noble landscape the composition of which is just and the lights welldisposed and yet a sort of pleasure arises from seeing a bright table a dealboard or a rasher of bacon naturally represented  Deceptions of this kind used frequently to be hung up in the exhibitionroom in London among the works of capital artists where indeed they were unworthy of a place  Since this passage was written I have met with the following excellent remark in one of Sir Joshua Reynold s notes on Mr Mason's translation of Fresnoy p "Deception which is so often recommended by writers on the theory of painting instead of advancing the art is in reality carrying it back to it's infant state The first essays of painting were certainly nothing but mere imitations of individual objects and when this amounted to a  deception  the artist had accomplished his purpose  But while the  former of these is the work of genius the latter is a mere mechanical knack The one therefore is admired by the man of tastethe other except for a moment only by the ig∣norant and uninformed  This is just the case before us The painter who chooses a wintersubject in ge∣neral gives up composition and effect to shew how naturally he can represent snow or hoarfrost It is almost impossible to pro∣duce a good effect with these appendages of winter they must naturally create false and glaring lights to which the painter generally makes his composition subservient  Among the sources of incidental beauty in a forest may be mentioned what perhaps may appear odd the felling of timber If you wish to fell trees with some particular view to improvement the intention is often frustrated It must be done very artfully or  in general your design will be apparent and disgusting to the eye The master of the scene himself who is always on the spot and examines it frequently from every stand if he be a man of taste will be the best improver and direct the felling axe with most judgment At the same time we fre∣quently see trees cut down carelessly for the purpose of utility which have opened greater beauties than any they possessed themselves when standing tho the preconceived loss of them was greatly lamented But this can only happen where trees abound  I shall conclude this enumeration of the incidental beauties belonging to forestscenery with an appendage which we frequently see in itthat of a timberwain an object of the most picturesque kind especially when drawn by oxen Here the tree when dead adorns again the landscape which it adorned when living A gilded chariot is an object which art has industriously tricked out and decorated It is of a piece therefore with all such artificial objects as are the most unlike nature Whereas the timberwain is  at least a piece of simple art and the rude∣ness of it's form and materials is a property which it has in common with the works of natureOxen too are more picturesque in themselves than horsesMuch of the beauty however of this incident arises from it's being adapted to the scene A wain of timber is much more beautiful in a forest than it would be in the streets of a town  Thus I have enumerated the most common sources of  permanent  and  incidental  beauty in forestlandscape I have insisted only on the most  common  sources An eye inquisitive in the scenes of nature will investigate many othersHaving detained the reader perhaps too long in this examination I shall endeavour to relieve him by a few general observations on  foresthistory  SECT XI  PERHAPS of all species of landscape there is none which so universally captivates mankind as forestscenery and our prepos∣session in favour of it appears in nothing more than in this that the inhabitants of bleak countries totally destitute of wood are gene∣rally considered from the natural feelings of mankind as the objects of pity  Pliny has given us a view of this kind which he tells us he took himself upon the spot It represents a bleak seacoast in Zea∣land before that country was embanked the inhabitants of which he speaks of as the most wretched of human beings It is true there are other wants besides that of scenery which enter into the idea of their wretched∣ness but I dare affirm that if Pliny had found the same people with all their wants  about them in a country richly furnished with wood he would have spoken of them in dif∣ferent languagePliny's picture is in itself so good and is likewise so excellent a contrast to the scenes which we have just examined that I think it worth inserting I shall rather give the general sense of the passage than an exact translation of it  "This coast says he lies so much lower than the ocean that the tides daily overflow it The inhabitants build their huts on little eminences which they either find or con∣struct on the shores and which serve to raise their dwellings just above the watermark These dwellings or rather cabins when the tide rises often seem like floating boats and when it retires the inhabitants appear like stranded mariners and their cottages like wrecks Their harvest is the ebbing of the sea during which they are every where seen running about in quest of fish and pursuing them in each little creek of the shore as the tide deserts it They have neither horse nor cow nor domestic animal of any kind and as to game they have not the least appearance of a bush to shelter it The whole employ∣ment of this wretched people is fishing They  make their nets of seaweed and dry a kind slimy mud for fuel Rainwater is their only drink which they preserve in ditches dug before their cabins  See Pliny's Nat hist book xvi cap  "  Such is Pliny's picture of this bleak and desolate country From the very feelings of nature we shudder at it Whereas the idea of the forest is pleasing to every one The case is tho there may be as much real misery amidst beautiful scenery yet beautiful scenery covers it Wretchedness is often felt under splendid apparel but it does not strike us in such attire as it does in rags  That man was originally a forestanimal appears from every page of his early history Trace the first accounts of any people and you will find them the inhabitants of woods if woods were to be found in the countries in which they lived Caves thickets and trunks of trees were their retreats and acorns their food with such beasts as they took in hunting which afforded them only a preca∣rious supply  Haec nemora indigenae Fauni nymphaeque tenebant  Gensque virum truncis et duro robore nata  Born and living in trunks of trees  as Ruaeus well explains it not  produced from them    Queis neque mos neque cultus erat nec jungere tauros  Aut componere opes norant ant parcere parto  Sed rami atque asper victu venatus alebat  If indeed they lived near a coast like the Zealanders described by Pliny they obtained a livelihood by fishing But with the savages of the coast we have nothing to do Our attention is only engaged by the savage of the woods  While man continued thus an inmate of the forest it is possible he might have sagacity to build himself a hut of boughs which he might cover with clods and yet it is more probable that while he continued the mere child of nature he was contented with the simple shelter which Virgil above supposes his common mother furnished the imbowering thicket or the hollow trunk as summer or winter led him to prefer an open or a closer cover Strabo speaks of certain Asiatics even so late in the history of mankind as the times of Pompey the great who harboured like  birds in the tops of trees  Lib xii p edit Casaub  And I think the savages about Botanybay are not represented by our late discoverers in a much more im∣proved condition  Man in this solitary state for scarcity of food forbad any inlarged ideas of society waged but unequal war with his brothersavages the brutes Most of them outstripped him in speed many of them contended with him in strength and some nearly equalled him in sagacity  The human savage thus finding himself hard put to it even to defend his own might look round for assistance The dog whose friendly manners  That there is something very harmonious between the human and canine nature is the observation of all naturalists Every other domestic animal is attached to his habitation the dog alone to his master Build a shed for horses or cows in any place and let them be well supplied with food and they are perfectly happy They know their keeper indeed but they are no way disturbed if his loss be supplied by another who feeds them as well Let a family leave a house and a new family occupy it the cat complains of nothing except the bustle of a remove But the dog carry him where you will and feed him with the most grateful food enjoys for a long time no happiness if he be deprived of his beloved master He forms new attachments in time but he never forgets an old friendship The friendship of a dog Homer has thought of consequence to introduce into an epic poem  might solicit his acquain∣tance  was probably one of his first associates in those countries where dogs were to be found This union made a powerful party in the forest The great object of it however was rather food than conquest The dog and his master were both carnivorous animals and they soon be∣gan to gratify their appetites at the expence of their fellowbrutes The one conducting and the other executing the plan few creatures could oppose them  But man from the beginning was an ambitious animal Having filled his belly he aspired after dominion For this purpose it was necessary for him to procure a better ally than that he had chosen He had yet but little connection with his fellow To join now and then in a huntingparty was all the intercourse he knew It was little more than such a league as is found among wolves jackalls and other animals that hunt in packs Ideas of society however by degrees took place The dawnings of social  compact appeared Man now threw off the brute and thought it good to leave his scat∣tered tenements and to assemble in hords The rudiments of law were traced and some rude sketch of subordination In earnest he began now to shew his dominion By fel∣lowship he had increased his strength The horse the bullock and other animals were reclaimed from the forest some for social assistance and others for a less precarious supply of food while the shaggy tenants of the forest which were hostile to his plans began every where to give way prowling only by night and skulking by day in such deep recesses as might best secure them from the formidable assocication which had taken place  But still his native forest was man's delight Here in some opening surrounded with woods the hord first settled Here the first attempts of architecture were made the krail was laid out by rule and line and the first draughts of regular defence were imagined Caesar with all his boasted conquests found the Gauls the Britons and the Germans scarce emerging from this state of barbarism His commentaries every where shew them to have  been forest people retreating before him into their fastnesses and impeding his march by felling timber in his way The Britons he expressly tells us  Oppidum Britanni vocant quum sylvas impeditas vallo atque fossa municrunt De Bell Gal Lib v  gave the name of a town to a part of a forest which they had fortified with a rampart and a ditch  But Caesar saw the British town only in time of war Strabo gives us a picture of one in time of peace "Forests says he were the only towns in use among them which were formed by cutting down a large circle of wood and erecting huts within it and sheds for cattle"  Lib vii p edit Casaub  The same author afterwards describing a town of this kind shews more exactly the mode of fortifying it It was the practice he tells us to intermix and weave together the branches of thorny trees and strengthen them with stakes  As the arts of civilization increased man began to feel that the forest could not afford him all the conveniences he wished Wants multiplied upon him which he could not  indulge amidst it's recesses He chose fertile situations for tillagethe neighbourhood of rivers for mills and manufacturesand de∣scended to the seacoast for commerce which he extended to the most distant parts  Thus genial intercourse and mutual aid  Cheered what were else an universal shade  Called nature from her ivymantled den  And softened human rockwork into men  When man became thus refined we leave him When he relinquished the forest we have no farther connection with him His haunts and habits are no longer the object of conjecture They become the subject of re∣corded history To the sage historian therefore we now consign him and return to the forest which at this day in most parts of the world where any forests remain is left in possession of the brute creation  Under the burning suns of Lybia in the forests of Zara and Bildulgerid the lordly lion reigns He harbours too in the woods of India but there he is an ignoble brute compared with the lion of Africa The  African lion is a beast of unrivalled prowess Nothing appalls him From his dark re∣cesses in the forest he sometimes eyes the numerous caravan consisting of men horses and camels marching slowly along the burning sands of Barca He lashes his tail collects his strength and bounding forward tho single attacks the whole He is received by a brigade of pointed spears and soon overpowered but in the bravery of his soul he dies without a wish to retreat  In the forests of Mallabar and Bengal the tyger roams Of this animal there are various kinds the largest and fiercest is called the royaltyger Of all the savages of the forest he is the most active the most in∣sidious and the most cruel  The forests of India are inhabited also by the gentle and inoffensive elephant This animal commonly marches in social bands The traveller hears them at a distance as they traverse the forest marking their rout by the crush and desolation of thickets and  intervening woods He listens without dis∣may and even waits to be a spectator of the unweildy procession as it moves along  The monkey inhabits the woods both of Africa and India and what is singular where he chooses to take possession he may be called the lord of the forest The lion himself gives way not being able to bear as travellers report the incessant tricking of that mischievous brute whose agility prevents correction But the human figure is of all others the object of his highest derision If such a phenomenon appear in his domains the whole society are called together by a whoop From curiosity they proceed to in∣solence chattering grinning and throwing drown fruit cones withered sticks or any thing their situation furnishes Firearms can scarce repress themIn some forests where the ape the baboon and other larger species of this disgusting tribe inhabit the traveller must be well guarded to pass in security  In southAmerica in the wide forests of Brazil and Paraguay along the banks of the Amazon the cougar a species of tyger is the most formidable animal Possessed of amphibious nature he plunges into the river and carries his devastations beyond that mighty stream Buffon relates that he has been known to cross the sea in large companies between the continent and the island of Cayenne and in the infancy of that colony to have kept it in constant alarms  In northAmerica the moosedeer seems intitled to the appellation of lord of the forest an animal represented by many travellers as high as an elephant and of a nature as gentle With stately tread he traverses the vast woods of fir and crops the cones and pinetops beyond the reach of any other animalWhen the forest is covered with snow and crusted over with frost the wild American marks him for certain destruction His feet sink deep in the faithless surface and his flight is impeded while his pursuers mounted on  snowshoes attack and retreat at pleasure assailing him with shot or arrows on every side and when he falls half a township is employed to drag him to their habitations where the noble carcase is received in triumph and at once suspends the effects of famine If food be plentiful he is hunted for his skin But tho his nature is gentle like many other animals he will turn upon his pursuer if he be wounded He fights with his forefeet We have a story well authenticated of a hunter on whom a wounded moosedeer turned He was found in the woods pounded into a jelly his very bones were broken in pieces and the deer having exhausted his fury was found lying dead beside him  The woods of Germany nourish the wild boar a beast by no means among the most ignoble of the forest His form the shape of his head his short erect ears his tusks his thick muscular shoulders adorned with bristles and the lightness of his hind quarters so contrary to the domestichog which is a round lump are all highly picturesque Such also are his colour a grisly brown and his  coat covered in many parts as well as his shoulders with long sweeping bristles Nor are his gait attitude and motion at all inferior to his formThis beast during the three first years of his life herds with the litter among which he was produced He is then called by foresters  a beast of company  In his fourth year he assumes the title of a  wild boar  ranges the forest alone becomes royal gameand at this day fur∣nishes the chief amusement of half the princes of the empire  From the forests of the Pyrennees when winter rages the famished wolves rush down in troops All the country is in arms and the utmost vigilance and force of men and dogs can scarce repress such a torrent of invasion  In the gloomy forests of Lapland where the pine is covered with black moss the hardy reindeer browzes If he descend into the plain his food differs only in hue With these two kinds of moss the black and the white the whole face of Lapland is disco∣loured  and when the diminutive native of the country sees the wastes around him abound with this semivegetable he blesses his stars and calls it luxury His reindeer supported by this cheerless pasturage supplies him with every thing that nature wants It gives him foodit gives him milkit gives him cloath∣ingand carries him wrapped in fur and seated in his sledge with amazing velocity from one desert to another  Thus most of the forests of the earth became the possession of the brute creation In the forests of Sumatra we are told that wildbeasts at this very day depopulate whole villages  See Marsden's hist of Sumatra  In other savage countries man and beast are still jointtenants yet in general even the barbarian is taught by example to leave the forest for a more convenient abode  SECT XII  BUT tho man had deserted the forest as a dwelling and had left it to be in∣habited by beasts it soon appeared that he had no intention of giving up his right of dominion over it In a course of ages as population increased he began to find it in his way In one part it occupied grounds fit for his plough in another for the pasturage of his domestic cattle and in some parts it afforded shelter for his enemies He soon shewed the beasts they were only tenants at will He began amain to lay about him with his axe The forest groaned and receded from it's ancient bounds It is amazing what ravages he made in his original habi∣tation through every quarter of the globe The fable was realized man begged of the forest a handle to his hatchet and when he  had obtained the boon he used it in felling the whole  In very early days this devastation began When Joshua divided the land of promise among the Israelites the children of Joseph made complaint that their lot was insufficient for their numbers "Get thee up to the woodcountry said Joshua and cut down for thyself there in the land of the Perizzites the mountain shall be thine for it is a wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine"  Josh xvii  The mighty forest of Lebanon which once found employment for eighty thousand hewers  Kings v  is now dwindled to a dozen trees The woods which covered the island of Delos had intirely disappeared even in the time of Herodotus In all the new peopled parts of America it was the sole employment of each colony to cut down wood and it is astonishing what devastation the woods of these countries have suffered during these two last centuries In the WestIndies the same havoc was made In Barbadoes which was  once covered with wood scarce a single tree can be found All the other WestIndia islands are more or less in the same con∣dition To prepare the ground for sugar∣canes the axe has continued to rage in them ever since the time of their dis∣covery  In the EastIndies we see the same scenes of desolation Wherever settlements have been made the woods have been cut down and indeed often unnecessarily In the island of Sumatra Mr Marsden tells us  See Marsden's hist of Sumatra  the inhabi∣tants have no settled land for their tillage but cut down every year a part of the ancient forests of the country and meliorate the soil by the ashes of the trees which they burn upon it "I could never says he behold this devastation without a strong sentiment of regret Perhaps the prejudices of a classical education taught me to respect those aged trees as the habitations of an order of sylvan deities who were now deprived of existence But without having recourse to superstition it is not difficult to account for such feelings at the  fight of a venerable wood old as the soil it stood on and beautiful beyond what the pencil can describe annihilated for the mere temporary use of the space it occupied  See Marsden's hist of Sumatra  "  In part the devastation of timber has been owing in some countries to other causes Among these it is well known what pro∣digious quantities of drifttimber are every year wrecked on the seacoast of Greenland Iceland Siberia Kamskatka and other north∣ern regions brought down as is supposed by the great rivers of Tartary and America and thrown by the setting of the currents on those shores In a voyage related by Purchas we are told that the Obi and the Jenisca fre∣quently when the frosts break and the snows dissolve overflow their banks and carry down with them vast mountains of ice which rol∣ling along through the forests crush down all the trees they meet with and will some∣times drive whole woods before them to the sea  Second part b iii ch    On the coasts of Spain and Portugal also drifttimber is frequently found At the siege of Gibraltar on the night of the th of december says captain Drinkwater in his history of that siege "we had a most violent rain with dreadful thunder and lightening The succeeding morning a vast quantity of wood was floating under our walls The rain had washed it from the banks of the Palmone and Guadaranque and it was wafted by the wind over to our side of the bay Fuel had long been a scarce article this supply was therefore considered as a miraculous instance of providence in our favour"In the EastIndies we have likewise accounts of the devastation of timber from the same cause This cause however operates only on the banks of large rivers or near the coasts of the sea  See Crantz's history of Greenland v i p Evelin's travels through Siberia v ii p Millar's collection of Russian transact viii Drinkwater's siege of Gibraltar page    But tho in all countries woods have been dismantled yet this devastation of timber hath raged with the greatest ardour in Europe France is almost intirely deprived of wood  All timber of such a size belonged to the king The consequence was nobody would suffer trees to attain that size In the internal parts of Spain and Germany some woody tracts still remain but the grandeur of those ancient forests which Hannibal and Caesar traversed is no where to be found Where shall we now hear of a forest that took a period of sixty days to pass through it  Hercynia sylva dierum sexaginta iter occupans  Pompon Mela l iii c  But if some woody scenery is still found in the  internal  parts of these countries yet along the  coasts  from the Baltic to the Rhine and from the Rhine to the streights of Gibraltar all is laid waste  In Italy too the same havoc has been made In Calabria indeed are still some tracts of wood but I believe in few other parts Those vast pineforests which had rooted themselves from the beginning of time on the ridges of the Appennines are now in most parts of that chain of mountains recorded only by a few scattered clumps  Even the bleak clime of Iceland is supposed to have been once covered with large forests  tho it is now almost totally bare of wood It is probable however that other causes besides that of making room for tillage of which there is but little in that island have contri∣buted to this event  See Troil's letters on Iceland p c    From these varied scenes of devastation the Turkish dominions I believe are the most exempted The Turks venerate trees and cherish them in all places where the soil is not absolutely required They may almost be said to live under them for they are continually reclining beneath their shade In Turkey it is common to see inferior buildings raised around the bole of a large plantain which rising through the roof covers the whole with it's expanded boughs We may suppose there∣fore what we sometimes hear is true that some of the most picturesque scenery in the world may be found among the islands of the Egean and along the shores of the Darda∣nells many of which are beautifully covered with woodThese woods account pro∣bably for an appearance which is singular to  a stranger navigating those narrow seas As the cornvessels sail through them in their way to Constantinople innumerable flights of pigeons which find shelter in these woody recesses hover round the boats demanding a sort of toll from each which the Turks never fail to pay them These domestic birds acquire the sagacity to distinguish the cornboat from every other species of navigation and settling upon it's deck they eat their dole at perfect ease As the vessel approaches Constantinople the tame pigeons of that capital and all it's suburbs scruple not if they choose it to take the same liberty Doves of every kind are sa∣cred in Turkey  SECT XIII  BRITAIN like other countries abounded once in wood When Cassibalan Ca∣ractacus and Boadicia defended their country's rights the country itself was a fortress An extensive plain was then as uncommon as a forest is now FitzStephen a monk of Canterbury in the time of Henry II tells us that a large forest lay round London "in which were woody groves in the covers whereof lurked bucks and does wild boars and bulls" To shelter beasts of the latter kind we know a forest must be of some magnificence These woods contiguous even to the capital continued close and thick many ages afterwards Even so late as Henry VII's time we are informed by Polidore Virgil that "Tertia propemodum Angliae pars pecori aut cervis damis capreolis nam et ii quoque  in ea parte sunt quae ad septentrionem est cuniculisve nutriendis relicta est inculta quippe passim sunt ejusmodi ferarum vivaria seu ro∣boraria quae lignis roboreis sunt clausa unde multa venatio qua se nobiles cum primis exercent"  In this passage the forest seems to be dis∣tinguished from the park which latter was fenced in those days with oak pales as it is now  As Britain became more cultivated it's woods of course receded They gave way as in other places to the plough to pas∣turage to shipbuilding to architecture and all other objects of human industry in which timber is the principal  material  obtaining for that reason among the Romans the pointed appellation of  materies  That our woods were often cut down merely for the sake of tillage and pasturage without any respect to the uses of timber seems to be evident from the great quantities of subterraneous trees dug up in various parts of England They are chiefly found in marshy grounds which abounded indeed  every where before the arts of draining were in use Nothing was necessary in such places to produce the future phenomenon of sub∣terraneous timber but to carry the trees upon the surface of the bog which might easily be done in dry summers Their own weight the ouzing of the springs and the swelling of the mossy ground would soon sink them as they were generally stripped of their branches which were probably burnt Dr Plot who had examined subterraneous timber with great exactness gives good rea∣sons for supposing it might have been bu∣ried in this way merely to make way for the plough and imagines that the English might begin to clear their woodlands for tillage as early as the times of Alfred the great  See Plot's hist of Oxfordshire chap sect  Others account for the phenomenon of sub∣terraneous timber from the havoc made in woods by the violence of storms In marshy grounds especially where trees take but feeble hold they would be most liable to this destructionBoth this hypothesis and Dr Plot's may be equally true  But notwithstanding this general extermi∣nation of timber for the purposes of human industry still many forests were left in the time of our ancestors in every part of the island under the denomination of royal chaces which our ancient kings preserved sacred for their amusementForests indeed have ever been in use in all parts and ages of the world as the appendages of royalty We read of them thus appropriated even in the times of sacred story When Nehemiah was in captivity in the court of Artaxerxes and had obtained leave of that prince to rebuild Jerusalem Artaxerxes granted him we read among other favours a letter to  Asaph the keeper of the king's forest  to supply him with timber  See Nehemiah ii    In England the royal appropriation of most of our forests seems to have been at least as early as the times of the heptarchy Every petty prince had then his royal de∣meisns Afterwards when one sovereign ob∣tained possession of the whole island he found himself the proprietor of a number of  these forests scattered over the different parts of it  In Scotland also several forests existed but whether they were in general the soverign's property or indeed any of them under the jurisdiction of forestlaw might be matter of inquiry Some of them undoubtedly belonged to private persons but on the whole the forests of England were both more numerous in proportion and more appropriated to the crown than the forests of Scotland How many of these districts existed between the forest of Englewood in Cumberland and Newforest in Hampshire may easily be supposed when we are assured that in the last named county alone there were an∣ciently at least a dozen tho we can scarce at this time trace above half that number  At present indeed even the vestiges of most of our English forests are obliterated Of a few of them we find the site marked in old maps but as to their sylvan honours scarce any of them hath the least remains to boast Some of the woods were destroyed in licen∣tious times and many have been suffered through mere negligence to waste awaythe pillage of a dishonest neighbourhood  The picturesque eye in the meantime is greatly hurt with the destruction of all these sylvan scenes Not that it delights in a continued forest nor wishes to have a whole country covered with wood It delights in the intermixture of wood and plain in which beauty consists It is not it's business to consider matters of utility It has nothing to do with the affairs of the plough and the spade but merely examines the face of nature as a beautiful object At the same time it is more than probable that if at least some of our ancient forests in different parts of the kingdom had been preserved the ends of public utility might have been answered as well as those of picturesque beauty This was at least the opinion of our enemies We are informed that in the intended invasion of the Spaniards among other mischief that was meditated had orders to cut down all the forests of England which they could meet with particularly the forest of Dean in Glocestershire John of Ghent indeed acted this part in Scotland when to revenge an inroad he set twentyfour thousand axes at work in the forest of Caledonia  Out of respect however to the noble scenes which the forests of Britain once presented I shall endeavour to preserve the remembrance of as many of them as I can I shall carry my reader first into the northern parts of Scotland and shall from thence proceed regularly through all the forests of which we have any know∣ledge to the southern parts of England  SECT XIV  THE character of the Scotchforest is very different from that of the English one It commonly extends over a mountainous country abounding with vallies rocks pre∣cipices torrents cataracts lakes and all the accompaniments of the wildest and grandest species of landscape It is chiefly composed of pines which give it a melancholy gloomy aspect In some parts this gloomy tinge is varied by birch and in other parts inlivened by the cheerful green and brilliant berries of the mountainash The pineforests often climb precipices of very towering height diminishing to the gazing eye when stationed at the bottom till the loftiest pines almost appear melting into air  The woods that rear themselves over the steeps of the Alps and Appennines often form  appearances of this kind but of a more cheer∣ful cast The following description is a beautiful contrast to the gloomy aspect of a Scotchforest tho I fancy the poet has drawn a more woody species of scenery than is at this time commonly to be found in Italy  Far to the right where Appennine ascends  Bright as the summer Italy extends  Woods over woods in gay theatric pride  Well massed yet varied deck the mountain's side  While towering oft amidst the tufted green  Some venerable ruin marks the scene  The animals which inhabit the Scotchforest are the roebuck the eagle and the falcon Heretofore it was frequented by the cock of the wood a noble bird dressed in splendid plumage of nearly the size of a turkey He was often seen amidst the dark foliage of the pine rearing his glossy crest and crowing at intervals but he is now seldom found The stag also sometimes shelters himself among the thickets of the forest but it is the heat only of a meridian sun that drives him thither The storm he values not but continues browzing in de∣fiance of it on the side of the bleakest  mountain on which it happens to overtake him  The English forest except in the northern counties which border on Scotland exhibits a very different species of landscape It is commonly composed of woodland views in∣terspersed as we have described them  See p  with extensive heaths and lawns It's trees are oak and beech whose lively green corres∣ponds better than the gloomy pine with the nature of the scene which seldom assumes the dignity of a mountain one but generally exhibits a cheerful landscape It aspires indeed to grandeur but it's grandeur does not depend like that of the Scottish forest on the  sublimity of the objects  but on the  vastness of the whole  the extent of it's woods and wideness of it's plainsIn it's inhabitants also the English forest differs from the Scotch Instead of the stag and the roebuck it is frequented by cattle and fallowdeer and exchanges the screams of the eagle and the falcon for the crowing of pheasants and the melody of nightingales The Scotchforest no doubt  is the sublimer scene and speaks to the ima∣gination in a loftier language than the English forest can reach This latter indeed often rouses the imagination but seldom in so great a degree being generally content with cap∣tivating the eye  The scenery too of the Scotchforest is better calculated to last through ages than that of the English The woods of both are almost destroyed but while the Englishforest hath lost all it's beauty with it's oaks and becomes only a desolate waste the rocks and the mountains the lakes and the torrents of the Scotchforest make it still an interesting scene  In Sutherland which is the most northern county in Scotland are found the forests of Derrymore and Derrymonach  In Rossshire in the district of Assynt lies the forest of Coygach and along the confines of Lochmari which is one of the most ex∣tensive lakes in Scotland runs another forest which bears the name of the lake  In the county of Murray are the forests of Abernethy and Rothimurcha winding along the banks of the Spey They both belong to the family of the Grants and make a part of the extensive demeisns of castleGrant which stands in their neighbourhood  In the shire of Inverness are the remains of several foreststhose of Lochloyn Glenmo∣riston Strathglass Lochgarrie Lochartrig and Kinlochleven  In the county of Bamff lies the forest of Glenmore which belongs to the duke of Gordon whose castle rises among the woods on the confines of it  On the banks of the Dee in the southern part of the county of Aberdeen lies the forest of Glentaner which belongs to Lord Aboyne and more to the west the forests of Braemar and Invercald  The former is a very romantic scene especi∣ally in the eastern parts Here we find in great perfection every species of the wildest and most awful country The beetling rock assumes no where a more tremendous form nor the pine bursting from it's fissures a more majestic station nor does the river in any place threw itself into more furious contortions This wild and extensive forest is much frequented by game of every kind which used formerly in the summer season to draw together a great resort of nobility and gentry from all parts of Scotland Their meeting had the appearance of a military expedition They wore a uniform and in∣camped together in temporary huts Their days were spent in the chace and their evenings in jollity Such meetings were com∣mon in Scotland and of great antiquity A huntingparty of this kind gave occasion to the celebrated ballad of Chevychace  The forest of Invercald is likewise a very romantic scene The pines which at this day grow in some parts of it are thought to be superior to any in Europe both in size and quality Many of them attain the height of eighty or ninety feet and measure  four feet and a half in diameter They are sold even in that country for five or six guineas a tree The timber which they yield is resinous heavy and of a darkred colour Considerable quantities of it are still carried into the lower parts of Scotland in floats down the Dee when that river hap∣pens to be swoln with rains The forests of Braemar and Invercald are supposed to be the remains of the ancient Caledonian wood  In the county of Athol is the forest of Lochrannoc and in that of Argyl the forest of Lochtulla where Mr Pennant tells us he saw the last pines which he supposed to be of spontaneous growth in Scotland  In the county of Stirling lies the forest of that name or Torwood as it is often called Here the country tho still abrupt and rough begins to assume a milder form Here too the oak begins to mix it's chearful verdure with the dark green tint of the  pineAs we approach nearer the English border it is probable the oak became still more frequent and occupied large tracts in those vast woods which on better evidence than that of balladhistory we believe ex∣isted formerly in the wilds of Tiviot and Cheviot  As we enter England the large county of Northumberland affords the remains only of two forests Rothbury in the middle of it and Lowes on the western side a little to the north of the Roman wall  In Cumberland we find five Nicol Knare∣dale Westwood Inglewood and Copeland all now desolate and naked scenes except where some of the lands have been culti∣vated  The wild county of Westmorland consisted formerly of little besides forests with the appendages of lakes and mountains Six are still traced in it On the north lies the  forest of Milburn in which rises one of the loftiest mountains in England that of Crossfell On the west lie the forests of Whin∣field Martindale and Thornthwait Mar∣tindale is bounded by the beautiful lake of Ullswater and Thornthwait by that of Broadwater On the eastern side of this rough county lie the forests of Stainmore and Mellerstang Stainmore is a wild scene noted only for being one of the great western passes into Scotland At the northern extremity of it is presented a grand piece of distant mountain sceneryOn the borders of Mel∣lerstang stand the ruins of Pendragoncastle the walls of which are full four yards in thickness Pendragoncastle gives Westmor∣land perhaps a better title to that celebrated hero Uter Pendragon than any the Welsh can boast It stands upon the river Eden and the tradition of the country is that the noble founder proposed to draw that great stream around it like a trench His enter∣prize miscarrying gave rise to the following adage applied to the attempting of an im∣possibility  Let Pendragon do what he can  Eden runs where Eden ran  This forest was likewise celebrated for being formerly the haunt of wildboars and a part of it to this day retains the name of Wild∣boarfell Here also stands the mountain of Mowil from whence three of the largest rivers in the north of England take their source the Eden the Ewer and the Swale  In the bishoprick of Durham we find only the forest of Langden or Teesdale which latter name it assumes from running along the banks of the Tees When the woods of this forest were in perfection they must have afforded a great variety of very picturesque scenery For the Tees is one of the most romantic rivers in England and forms many a furious eddy and many a foaming cascade in it's passage through the forest particularly that celebrated cataract which by way of emi∣nence is called the  fall of the Tees  In Lancashire we find three forestsLan∣casterforest which I suppose is the same  as WiresdaleBowland a little to the south and Simon'swood extending almost to Liverpool  In the northern parts of Yorkshire lie a clus∣ter of small forestsLimeApplegarth Swaledaleand Wenseleydale Whether each of these had a separate jurisdiction or whether their rights were intermingled would be dif∣ficult at this day to ascertain They must formerly however in their rude state have been delightful scenes Even now they con∣tain some of the most picturesque country we have in Englandriversvalliesrocksand woods in great prosusion tho intermingled and deformed with patches of human industry  On the Eastern side of Yorkshire lies the forest of Pickering extending itself almost to Scarborough This forest with that of Wires∣dale were royalties belonging to the duchy of Lancaster and in the time of John of Ghent the jurisdiction of forestlaw was maintained in both of them with so much exactness that the determinations of the courts of Lancaster and Pickering were always  esteemed sufficient precedents for all the other forest courts in England  See Manwood on forestlaw in various parts    In the middle of Yorkshire lies the wide forest of Knaresborough once a very romantic scene a little to the south lies Harewood and on the east lies Galtries still a woody district extending almost to the walls of York  Around Hallifax lies Hardwickeforest within the precincts of which Hallifaxlaw as it was called took place It was a very severe jurisdiction vested in the magistrates of the town to punish clothstealing The offender within the space of two or three marketdays was tried condemned and exe∣cuted The instrument of his execution was called a maiden It was a machine in which an axe was drawn up a considerable height between two posts and under the pressure of a heavy weight fell rapidly on the criminal's neck The axe is still shewn at Hallifax  There were probably many other forests in Yorkshire but we can only trace with any degree of certainty the site of one more which is Hatfieldchace and this might likewise  have been forgotten had it not been for a piece of history belonging to itthe death of Edwin king of Northumberland which hap∣pened in this forest together with the destruction of his army by Penda the pagan king of Mercia  In Cheshire we have the forests of Delamere and Macclesfield The former is an extensive district of ground rising as it approaches Chester and presenting at the extremity a grand view of the flat country below bounded by the mountains of Wales The castle of Beeston seated on a hill in the second dis∣tance appears to great advantage in the view In this forest Edelfleda a Mercian princess founded a little town for her retirement which obtained the title of the  happy city  The site is still known by the name of the  chamber in the forest  Besides these two forests in Cheshire there was formerly another of larger dimensions than either of them It occupied under the name of Wireallforest that whole peninsula which lies between the estuaries of the Mercey and the Dee  In the county of Nottingham is the cele∣brated forest of Sherwood which was formerly the frequent scene of royal amusement Mansfield a town in that forest was the seat of the king's residence on those occasions and it was here that he made an acquaintance with the miller of famous memoryThis forest was also the retreat of another personage equally celebrated in the chronicle of ballad the illustrious Robin Hood who with little John and the rest of his associates making the woody scenes of it his asylum laid the whole country under contributionSherwoodforest is at present a scene of great desolation tho it's woods in various parts are reviving under the auspices of several eminent patrons  The dukes of Norfolk Kingston Newcastle and Port∣land sir George Saville sir Charles Sedley and others have made large plantations in several parts  whose estates either lie within it or on it's confines  In Shropshire are the vestiges of at least four forests Huckstow King'swood Bridgenorth  and Clune Cluneforest deserves ever to be remembered in British annals as the scene where Caractacus is supposed  See Camden on Shropshire  to have made his last noble stand against the Romans Having resisted them nine years with various success and being now pushed to extremity he fortified himself on a hill in this forest Tacitus tells the story at length  See Tac annal lib xii chap  Ostorius led his legions against him The British camp was forced and through treachery the gallant chief was delivered to his conqueror At Rome says the historian the senate considered the triumph over Caractacus as splendid as those over Syphax and Perses  In the county of Stafford the forest of Need∣wood still affords a variety of pleasing country It is bounded by the Trent and the Dove and is in the neighbourhood of those romantic scenes in which the latter of these rivers makes so pleasing an appendage  On the confines of this forest stand the ruins of Tutburycastle where the princes of  the house of Lancaster formerly held their residence Their hospitality diversions and jovial housekeeping are not yet forgotten in the traditions of the country One instance called the  bullrunning  remains I believe to this day On the th of august a bull is turned loose and is the property of those who seize him This amusement which was formerly given to the duke of Lancaster's servants is now become the subject of great contention between the youth of Staffordshire and Der∣byshire who exercise their prowess on the occasion for the honour of their respective counties  The middle parts of Staffordshire are occu∣pied by a very extensive forest known by the name of Cankwood  In the southen parts of Leicestershire lies the wide forest of Charnwood in which the park of Beaumanour twenty miles in cir∣cumference was walled round by the lords of Beaumont and was thought to be one of the largest works of the kind in England In this county also lies the forest of Leicester on the borders of which is the celebrated  field of Bosworth where after so much blood∣shed in the contest between the two houses of York and Lancaster their quarrel was finally decided  In Rutlandshire is the forest of Lyfield still in some parts in it's original state and stocked with deer and in Hertfordshire are the remains of the forests of Bringwood Deerfield Hawood and Acornbury  Wireforest once famous for it's stately timber lies on the northwest of Worcester∣shire along the banks of the Severn In this county also we have the forest of Mal∣vern and Feckingham the former winds among the hills whose name it bears and and the latter is famous for it's salt springs in the boiling of which it's woods have been almost exterminated  More than half the county of Warwick was formerly a continued forestscene and was known by the name of  Arden  an old British  word which singnifies  a wood  Whether this vast district of woodland was divided into different jurisdictions would be difficult to ascertain There seems at least to have been one separate chace in it which belonged to the castle of Kenelworth and it is pro∣bable there might have been others  In the county of Northampton is the large forest of Rockingham which stretches along the river Welland almost to Stamford In this forest stands the castle of Rockingham formerly a pile of vast importance built by William the ConquerorIn Northamptonshire also there are three other forests Sacy Yardly and WhittleburyI have been assured that in the first and last of these forests Rock∣ingham and Whittlebury there remains at this day sufficient timber to build the navy of England twice over and as canals are now forming in those parts it may soon be no difficult matter to convey it from it's deep recesses to any of the king's yards These forests also particularly Whittlebury are in∣fested by the wildcat which the naturalists call the British tyger  Huntingdon takes it's name as etymologists suppose from being a country adapted to hunting  See Camden's Huntingdonshire  We may imagine therefore that in elder times when such beasts were hunted as required large covers a great part of the county was forest At present tho we have the vestiges of several woods we meet with no forest directly named but that of Wa∣bridge  In Glocestershire the forest of Dean has ever been esteemed one of the most celebrated forests in England It is of large extent not less than twenty miles in length and half as many in breadth stretching on the southeast along the Severn and on the northwest along the Wye the picturesque scenes of which latter river it greatly improves by often presenting it's woody distances The timber in this forest was formerly more in request than any other timber for the service  of the navy But it is at this time much diminished owing chiefly to the neighbour∣hood of several iron forges which it has long supplied with fuel There is however still more the appearance of a forest preserved here both in the scenery and in the juris∣diction than in almost any other part of England The courts are held in a large house which was built for this purpose in the middle of the forestIn the county of Gloucester also is the forest of Micklewood on the confines of which stands Berklycastle of celebrated antiquityKing'swood too is another forest in this county which being bounded by the Avon spreads itself almost to the walls of Bristol  In Oxfordshire we have only the single forest of Whichwood  In Buckinghamshire we have those of Bernwood and Clitern Bernwood runs along the hilly country from Aylesbury almost to to Oxford Clitern was formerly a very thick impervious wood and noted for being  the haunt of banditti who long infested the country till a publicspirited abbot of St Alban's broke their confederacy by bringing many of them to justice and destroying their retreats  In Essex are the two forests of Epping and Hainhault the latter of which it is probable was once an appendage to the former For Eppingforest was anciently a very extensive district and under the name of the forest of Essex included a great part of that county It afterwards took the name of Walthamforest but Epping being a place better known it now commonly takes that denomination  Wiltshire also was formerly a very woody county and once probably almost the whole of it was a forest Even at this day we find in it the vestiges of four forests Peevisham Blakemore Bradon and Savernack Bradon was a scene of dreadful bloodshed in the year when the Danes under Ethelred in∣vaded it and slaughtered all the inhabitants of it's environs among whom were a number  of women and children who had fled for refuge to it's recessesSavernackforest is still a woody scene and adorns a part of the road between Bath and London It belongs to the earl of Aylesbury and is almost the only privileged forest in England in the hands of a subject by whom in strict language a chase only is tenable This forest is about twelve miles in circuit and is still well stocked with deer and timber  In Berkshire is the celebrated forest of Windsor It was formerly the property of queen Emma and was afterwards distinguished by William the conquerer who built lodges in it and established forestlaw He himself used commonly after the chase to sleep at an abbey in the neighbourhood There is now little scenery left in any part of it Some of the finest of the old foresttrees still remain∣ing stand on the left of the road leading from the great park to Cranburnlodge The sce∣nery here chiefly from the ornament of the trees is beautifulThe most pleasing part of Windsorforest is the great park which tho in many places artificially and formally  planted contains great variety of ground The improvements of duke William of Cumberland were magnificent rather than in a stile suitable to a forest All formalities should have been as much as possible avoided and the whole formed into noble lawns and woods with views introduced where they could be into the country The great avenue to Windsorcastle tho in a stile of great formality is however in it's kind so noble a piece of scenery that we should not wish to see it destroyed Besides great numbers of red and fallowdeer this park was in the duke's time much fre∣quented by wild turkies the breed of which he encouraged It could hardly have had a more beautiful decoration Birds are among the most picturesque objects their forms and plumage are both picturesque yet they are ge∣nerally so diminutive that beautiful as they are they have little effect But the turkey is both a large bird and being gregarious forms groups which become objects of consequence It's shape also is picturesque and all it's actions It's colour also especially if it be of the bright copper varying in the sunbeam is more beautiful than the plumage of any other bird The peacock neither in form nor  in colour is equal to the turkey As this bird was reclaimed from the unbounded woods of America where it is still indigenous it's habits continue wilder than those of any domestic fowl It strays widely for it's food it flies well considering it's apparent inactivity and it perches and roosts on trees On all these accounts it is a proper inhabitant of parksWindsorforest is about thirty miles roundthe great park fourteenand the little park three  In Middlesex is the forest of Enfield After the death of Charles I it is said that Cromwell divided it into farms among his veterans but if they ever took possession they were dispos∣sessed at the restoration and deer it's ancient inhabitants were again settled in their room  Surry and Kent were formerly very woody counties of which we need no evidence besides that of Caesar when he invaded Bri∣tain There are no traces however of any nominal forest in either of them except the forest of Tunbridge Woods indeed there are  in various parts and much more the appea∣rance of a woody country is still left than in most of those countries in which forests are known to have existed  Sussex on the other hand which has ever been remarkable as one of the finest timber counties in England abounds at the same time with nominal forests It contains no fewer than seven St Leonard's Word Ashdown Waterdown Dallington Arun∣del and Charlton which last forest was settled on the dukes of Richmond Ridings through it have lately been cut and many plantations made but I never saw them  In Cornwall it does not appear that there has ever been any thing like a forest  In Devonshire there are two the forest of Dartmore which runs along the mountainous and barren country on both sides of the river Dart before it enters the southHams and the forest of Exmore which accompanies the river Ex till it enter the more fertile country about Dulverton  In Somersetshire there are likewise two Neroheforest which lies a little to the south of Taunton and Selwoodforest a little to the south of FroomThese scenes will ever be famous in British history while the remembrance continues of Alfred the great Frequent inundations of Danes and repeated losses had driven him from the management of affairs But he retired before the enemies of his country only to attack them with more advantage Seeing the time ripe for action he emerged from his retreat sent his emis∣saries around and called his friends together in the forest of Selwood which sheltered and concealed his numbers Here arranging his followers he burst from the forest like a torrent upon the Danes They gave way at once and suffered so terrible a defeat that they never again molested his repose  On the north of Dorsetshire lies Gilling∣hamforest remarkable also for a great defeat which Edmond Ironside gave the Danes on the confines of it A little to the east lies  Cranburnchase and on the west Black∣moreforest commonly called the forest of Whitehart from a celebrated stag which afforded great diversion to Henry IIIThe whole of the island of Purbeck was once a forest In the midst of it stands Corfcastle where Elsrida to open the throne for her son Ethelred murdered her soninlaw Edward when he called for refreshment at her castle after a toilsome chase  In Hampshire are the vestiges of five forests On the north near Sylchester lies Chuteforest through which passes the great southern Roman road still visible in many parts On the west lies the forest of Harewood which is still a woody scene tho it's larger trees are in general gone This place was formerly celebratad for the unfortunate loves of Athel∣wold and Elfrida Here Edgar slew his rival and the supposed place is traditionally marked by the name of deadman's plot The abbey of Whorwell which Elfrida founded on this occasion is not now to be traced except by a monumental stone which marks it's situation On the east of Hampshire  lies Holtforest more to the south the forest of Waltham which belongs to the Bishop of Winchester and near Tichfield the forest of Bere Some parts of these forests still afford remains of woody scenery  At the southwest extremity of Hampshire lies Newforest which as it hath given occasion to these remarks and is besides the noblest scene of the kind in England I shall in the following book consider more at large and endeavour to illustrate by it's scenes some of the observations which have already been made  To this account of the forests of England I shall only subjoin that Mr St John see his observations on the landrevenues of the crown p enumerates seventyseven of which Windsor Waltham Dean Rockingham Whittle∣wood Salcey Sherwood Which wood Newforest Bere and Walmer are the only forests he says which are reputed to have preserved their rights Of the rest indeed he gives the names many of which I meet with no where but in his catalogue He says however that several of them were dis∣forested and changed into private property by an act of Charles I which was wrested from him in consequence of his having revived the vexations of forestlaw at the beginning
