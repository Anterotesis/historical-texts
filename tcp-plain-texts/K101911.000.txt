likewise publickly declareth that he himself will be an adven'urer and will dare to undertake to compleat and also to finish the piece by partly supplying some hints whereby said painter may be forwarded in his work  To a certain nobleman on being told he had wished for the picture of a celebrated beauty  Fond swain I hear your wish is such  Some painter shou'd on canvass touch  The beauties of Monroe  But where's the adventurer will dare  The happy mixture to prepare  Her peerless charms to shew  Yet by those radiant beauties fir'd  And my ambitious muse inspir'd  Let me some hints supply  To Nature's stores then straight resort  Cull ev'ry tint the goddess court  This pice to dignity  First let the cheek with blushes glow  Just as when damask roses blow  Glist'ning with morning dew  Contrasted with the virgin white  With which the lily glads the sight  Blend them in lovely hue  And truly then that cheek to grace  Upon her flowing tresses place  The chesnut's auburn down  Her lips you may in sort depaint  By cherries ripe yet ah 'twere faint  Shou'd they with her's be shewn  Next let two eyes with lustre gleam  Even as the sun's reflected beam  Upon the glassy lake  Tinge it with dye of brilliant jet  Let it in milk be sweetly set  Each wand'ring heart to take  Let the transparent web of lawn  Be o'er the virgin bosom drawn  As fairyet cold as snow  That love may thro' the veil espy  What else were more than mortal eye  Cou'd view and safety know  But O to trace th' internal grace  That beams divinely in her face  How vain the muse wou'd soar  If e'er celestial cherub came  To bless thy sight in mystic dream  Snatch thatthe task is o'er  and Letty Gore  Their charms shall last in song divine  Like embryos preserved in wine  Your classic pencil finely traces  The beauties of the SISTER GRACES  The beauties of the  SISTER GRACES Three Miss Montgomeries on whom Howard wrote the following underwritten verses printed in these notes  On the absence and return of  THE THREE FAVOURITE SISTERS  Of late Love's Queen all in despair  Fled through each region of the air  Her graces were astray  To seek them Maia's winged son  From Pole to Pole with speed had run  It was a bustling day  Cupid who had to earth been sent  Return'd with haste and toil near spent  And vow'd he saw them there  That 'twas on fam'd Ierne's shore  Than which with beauties none shines more  On the terestral sphere  Straightway a troop of little Loves  Who tend their Queen where e'er she moves  And bask in her sweet eyes  Flew for the nymphs whom when they brought  Alack 'twas found the urchins caught  The three Montgomeries  Soon as their charms shone full to view  The Paphian Goddess jealous grew  She fear'd her future reign  Her boy she chid for his mistake  Nor wou'd forgive 'till he took back  The three to earth again  When in an easy vein you tell us  Of Love's mistake and Venus jealous  His sire his fortune to improve  To study law young Ovid drove  To study law young Ovid drove  Ovid otherwise called Naso a famous poet in the reign of Augustus He wrote several books of Metamorphosis or the changing of one thing into another Love Epistles and Fast Days he was not called to the bar nor ever practised as an attorney For further particulars see his works  In Usum Delphini  printed and sold by me in Parliamentstreet  He heeded naught but verse and love  The same

hearts  Oh how each breast with rapture glow'd  At your sublime Pindaric Ode  At your sublime Pindaric Ode  Howard wrote an Ode on his Majesty's Birthday which much resembleth Dryden's on the Feast of Alexander I have consulted sundry of the best critics judges and geniuses Mr Dexter who keepeth the FourCourts Marshalsea Mr Kavenagh attorney at law Mr Croker Ald Emerson at the Spinningwheel Castlestreet and others who all assure me they don't think Howard's Ode superior to Dryden's In my own opinion Dryden's is preferable  With your applause the Garden rings  With your applause the

family in Northamptonshire In order to give his countrymen of Ireland some more intimate knowledge of him no author's works having a better sale at my shop in Parliamentstreet I undertook a journey to London to collect materials for his life but after remaining there months for this purpose I could only learn that he was accustomed to sit in a big chair among the wits at Button's and this my friends telling me not being sufficient for a life of said poet I acordingly discontinued it  For who that Howard's Ode can taste  Will relish Alexander's Feast  Shou'd foolish George attempt to turn all  Your works to burlesque in his Journal  You'll make him of your wit the butt  And prove a deadlier foe than Foote  And prove a deâdlier foe than Foote  Samuel Foote  Esq  manager of the Theatre Royal in the Haymarket London He exposed Alderman Faulkner under the character of Peter Paragraph in one of his pieces acted upon Smockalley stage in Dublin He was prosecuted for said offence by Mr Faulkner and tried before Mr Justice Robinson who inveighed very eloquently against stageplayers and said he might be considered as rubbish or a dunghill and brought under the head of nuisancesThe learned council for the prosecutor also compared him unto Aristophanes and the alderman unto Socrates adding also that Socrates was not the worse for the comparison The playhouse would have run with blood on this occasion and many swords would have been drawn had not Mr Faulkner prevailed on his friends who were present every night of the representation to hear the piece out and let him take his remedy by law to which they very obligingly consented  N B  Said Foote hath with impunity exposed upon the stage some of the greatest men and greatest wits now living such as the late Duke of Newcastse Mr Glover the late Alderman Beckford Mr Langford the auctioneer Mr Peter Taylor and the rev Mr Whitfield He lost his leg by a providential fall from his horse in company with his late royal highness the Duke of York at the seat of the Earl of Mexborough He was taken up much bruised and the amputation was performed by Surgeon Bromfield  For tho' good natur'd all your life  Averse to calumny and strife  Yet Satire's sting you can impart  Tho' oft goodnature hides the dart  On thistles thus soft down we spy  Yet underneath sharp prickles lie  In vain the Freeman aid shall bring  "You're not a bee without a sting"  "You're not a bee without a sting"  There is a pecullar felicity as I am told in this comparison of Howard unto a bee although the Epistle sayeth that he "is not a bee" for whereas a bee never resteth upon one bud or flower but styeth about in wandering and uncertain angles from shrub to shrub and from Hollyhock to poppy and never is content until his bags be filled so Howard hath amassed an ample fortune by different occupations and also hath compleated a volume of apothegms from the divers rich spoils of learning which he hath happened to encounter in his poring over books many of which he hath had access to in my shop in Parliamentstreet  Tho' wisely ev'ry sweet you cull  Of which your apothegms are full  Of which your apothegms are full  Some of the greatest geniuses of antiquity and the moderns have taken particular delight in collecting all the wise sayings and brilliant proverbs of the cute observers upon men manners and thingsan exc llent collection of this sort is to be found in one of the last pages of Boyer's French Gentleman's Grammar But I am informed that the Lord Bacon Baron Verulam Viscount St Albins and Plutarch have been more industriouin this way than any of their contemporaries the moderns Howard in imitation of these supernatural wits is also the author of a compilation of an octavo volume under the title of Howard's

for turning up the earth were first invented by Triptolemus a near relation of the Goddess Ceres and afterwards much improved by Mr John Wynne Baker of the Dublin SocietyThe Irish formerly ploughed by

house myself Howard having nothing to say to it nor shall ever come within my doors unless it be to pay for advertisements in my Jonrnal or to buy medicines of my nephew ToddIt may be worth while to mention a very entertaining anecdote for the satisfaction of the curious relating thereunto When my house was building I happened to be out of the way one morning penning an advertisement for an agreeable companion to pay half the expence of a post chaise to see that stupendous curiosity of nature the Giant's Causeway about which 'tis still a doubt amongst the learned whether it be done in the common way by giants or whether it be an effort of spontaneous nature and my house was erected without any staircase whereby the upper stories were rendered useless unless by the communication of a ladder placed in the street But upon considering my misfortune in wanting my member and the carelesness of hackney coachmen who drive furiously through the streets at all hours in a state of drunkenness from spirituous liquors whereby the ladder might be shook or thrown down when I was ascending it I thought it better to rebuild my house and it has at present a staircase by which there is a convenient and elegant communication between all parts of said tenementIt is somewhat remarkable that my house in Essexstreet had no staircase whereby nature seemeth to point out that having but one leg I ought not to attempt climbing and should always remain on the ground floor  Who Vanburgh like claims double bays  Who Vanburgh like c  Sir John Vanburgh He was a great poet and architect I was not personally acquainted with him any farther than printing his works because he died before my time Being imprisoned in the Bastile and having no light nor pen or ink allowed him he amused himself with drawing divers plans of the Bastile which he hath since introduced into many buildings with great success particularly Blenheim which much resembleth the Bastile  For piling stones and writing

sent him to fight my nephew Todd in the way of proxy at the Fifteen Ac  es with pistols I could not fight myself because I am pledged to the public for my Journal three times a week and have the care of the city upon me in my capacity of an alderman My nephew was at first unwilling to accept the combat but upon my promising to leave him the Journal after my death and making him take two spoonfuls

from Killarney with the signature of POBLICOLA with a description and likewise a comparison of the Giant's Causeway whereunto he subjoineth an inscription for the tombstone of Dr Averel bishop of Limerick and uncle to the right hon Francis Andrews Provost of TrinityCollege Dublin who representeth the loyal city of Londonderry in parliament  N B  That Killarney is a small village of that name in the county of Kerry It is a market town but doth not send two members to parliament as most other boroughs do It is part of the estate of Lord Viscount Kenmare who hath forfeited his title he being a Catholic nobleman although very hospitable and keepeth a most plentiful table furnished with all the varieties the season affords I also had the honour to dine with him when I journeyed into these parts to see the beauties of this wonderous lake  To the printer of the  DUBLIN MERCURY  SIR  Killarney  Sept th    I have at length seen what I have long wisted to see this wonderous lake to attempt to describe it would require the ablest pen of the antient poets or of modern poets the famous painter of said lake wherefore I shall never attempt ityet notwithstanding all the beauties of the lake I cannot think it as a curiosity equal to the Giant's Causeway I have seen both I never saw any thing LIKE the first nor any thing EQUAL to the latter this distinction is agreed to by all I have mentioned it to But alas this lake has been the death of a man for whom the whole province here is in tears the late bishop of Limerick Dr Averel our countrymanTo sum up all shortly as I can I heard the people of Limerick where I was shortly after his death say that there has not been such a bishop since the time of the apoftles that the Romish clergy said they should not wonder had he lived any time if they had lost many of their flocksWhat obligations then are due to our Lord Lieutenant for having appointed such a man their pastor for though Heaven has pleased to take him away his successor will hear so much of him that he cannot but endeavour to imitate him I heard this acknowledged by several as also for his concurrence in appointing that well known friend to his country and their city especially speaker from these and many other like instances of his impartial conduct it is wished that we may never lose himand every day the advantage of a resident ViceRoy becomes more and more manifest that from this new mods of government there is far more likelihood that merit will be rewarded proper persons appointed to offices and the laws supported and executed A gentleman of your city happening to be at Limerick shortly after the interment of the bishop and hearing the prodigious great character of him from all persons wrote the following lines extempore as an inscription for a

attained her fiftythird year It certainly is not very genteel to ridicule this passion which is properly called allpowerful to shew that it spareth neither age nor condition station nor dignity not to mention the example of Anacreon who was choaked with a grapestone drinking the health of his mistress at the age of fourscore I am myself this instant a captive to the charms of a lady who has passed

kindred earth begone  What figure next confounds my fight  An Austrian Count an Irish Knight  Much German pride and Irish blunder  Much German pride and Irish blunder  The Germans are supposed in general to be a pround people Julius Caefar and Mr Nugent give them this character The Irish are very unjustly charged for a particular talent in blundering but it is well known that no people express themselves in their native tongue the English with more perspicuity and precision the Dean of St Patrick's who tho' born and bred in England always declared himself when sober to be an Irishman It will not I hope be considered as presumption that I add the authority of my Journal which is considered as a standard of our language whereas I have always consulted the particular propriety of diction and may be bold to challenge any author now extant for such a variety of tracts written in so unblemished a purity without any abbreviations of terminations and abounding in the best chosen epithets  Mark with what ease his brain creates  Speeches  ne'er  spoke  miscall'd Debates  'Till at the goddess Dulness' summons  He makes one Cll of the commons  He makes one Cll of the commons  Doubts having arisen how the deficient vowells are to be filled up I consulted several friends my nephew Todd imagineth it meaneth caudle a liquor drank by lyingin ladies as it is composed of several

with submission to better judgments that the word  dunghill  removeth all difficulties and corresponds exactly with the author's meaning and with every thing but the text  No brain but his cou'd e'er

remarkable apothecary and member of parliament He lived upon Ormondquay in Dublin at the sign of Boyle's Head who was a famous druggist He was banished from Ireland by a vote of the House of Commons which confined him to Newgate He returned to his native country by the special mercy of his Majesty whom he hath always continued to oppose for his good in two parliaments where he representeth the city of Dublin  He sings of beggars blind and dark  Like some old snuffling parish clerk  For stanzas vile he racks his brain  And vainly mimicks Howard's strain  He writes he hobbles bows and leers  To gain a seat among the peers  And ev'ry abject art he tries  To prove he's qualify'd to rise  With panegyric he bespatters  Degrading him he meanly slatters  Ah purblind knight thy arts misplac'd  Think better of a Townshend's taste  Fools only will such praise assume  As Hottentots think greasepersume  But whither Clio wou'dst thou rove  Fond thy descriptive pow'r to prove  Resume the theme

Thomas Todd has been so often mentioned in these notes that 'tis unnecessary to say an thing in his praise further than that he is an accute critic a great traveller and I have always found him very faithful and diligent in his duty as my foreman To him therefore this work is inscribed by  His sincere friend and paternal uncle GEORGE FAULKINER  Yet not one stanza of his own  Has made the poet's
