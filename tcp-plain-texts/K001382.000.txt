bargain  Don Ped  Certainlywe'll have the wedding tonight The young couple are so much in love they will be glad to dispense with ceremonyit really looks as if Heaven had a hand in this match for if young Felix had not died so commodioussy at Salamanca we could never have been brothersinlaw  Bora  Bless me your honour is poor Don Felix dead then he was a merry young gentlemanI'm sorry for it with all my soul  Don Ped  Ay he is dead as King Philip the Secondbut did you know Don Felix  Bora  As well as any hogshead in my cellarI kept a tavern three years at Salamanca and he was my constant customer I knew his sister too a brave mettled damsel that made no more of clapping on a pair of breeches and stradling a horseback than if she had never been laced in stays or encumber'd with a petticoat  Don Ped  to her frolics for she has no brother left to restrain her We sent for you Borachio to provide the wedding dinner Let things be as they should be  Bora  Never trouble your head about it I'll set you out such a repastthe first course shall be as substantial as the bridegroom and the second as delicate as the bridethen for wines and a desert I don't care if you ask all the Benedictines to sit in judgment upon their flavour and freshness  Enter a  Servant Maid  Maid  Sir there's a servant of a strange gentleman who has a message for you  Don Ped  What does he want with me  Maid  He will not tell his business to any one but your Worship He has been fooling with me till I am tired of him  Don Ped  Bid him come in  Exit Maid  Don San  Can you guess what business a stranger can have with you  Don Ped  Ay I suppose the old businesssome needy spendthrift who has lost his purse at the gamingtable and wants to try if I am fool enough to take a liking to him and lend him as much more upon  no  security  Enter  Lazarillo  and  Maid  Lazar  I have the honour to be gentlemen with the most profound respect your honour's most faithful obsequious and obedient humble servant  Don San  This fellow begins his speech like the conclusion of a letter  Don Ped  Have you any business with me friend  Lazar  May I take the liberty to ask your honour a question  Don Ped  Ay what is it  Lazar  Pray who may that pretty plump cherrycheeked roundhipped buxom genteel lightpastern'd blackeyed damsel be  Don Ped  What business is it of yours she's my daughter's maid  Lazar  I wish your honour much joy of her  Don Ped  What does the fellow mean To your business friendWho are you What do you want with me Who do you belong to  Lazar  Softly softly Sirthree questions in a breath are too much for a poor man like me to answer all at once  Don Ped  To Don San  I don't know what to make of this fellowI believe he's none of the wisest  Don San  I should rather suspect he was none of the honestest  Lazar  Are you married my pretty lass  Don Ped  What would the fellow be at What's your business I say  Lazar  Sir to answer your questionsin the first place I am my master's servant  To the Maid  And my pretty one as I was going to tell you if the Don had not interrupted me  Don Ped  Who the devil is your master  Lazar  He's a strange gentleman Sir who has a strong inclination to pay your Worship a visit  To the Maid  And now as to the little affair between us  Don Ped  Who is this strange gentleman What business has he with me  Lazar  Sir he is the noble Don Felix de Silva of Salamanca who waits below to have the supreme felicity of kissing your honour's hand and has sent me before to make his compliments to you  To the Maid  Well my dear have you thought of the proposal Do you think me shocking  Don Ped  Mind me fellowwhat is this you say  Lazar  Sir if you are curious to know particulars about me I am Lazarillo of Valencia as honest a little fellow tho' I say it that shou'd not say it as ever rode before a portmanteau  To the Maid  What I pride myself for more than my other good qualities  is that I am the adorer and faithful slave of your divine and insurmountable beauty  Don Ped  Turn this way boobyyou are either drunk or madWhy Don Felix of Salamanca is dead  Lazar  Dead  Don Ped  Dead ay dead and buried  Don San  You may get another master honest friend for poor Don Felix has no occasion for you  Lazar  This is strange newsIt must be a very sudden deathperhaps it was only his ghost that hired me but I never saw any thing so like a living creature he gave me a rap over the shoulders just now that I thought felt very natural If he is really a ghost he won't dare to pretend he's alive and tell a lie before so much good company  Exit  Don Ped  What do you think of this rascal Is he a knave or a fool  Don San  To my thinking he's compounded of both  Bora  To my poor thinking he's crazy  Don San  'Fore Heaven brotherinlaw that is to be if Don Felix should be alive we two should make but a silly figure  Reenter  Lazarillo  Lazar  Truly gentlemen this is but indifferent treatment for a stranger to tell a poor servant like me that his master was dead  Don Ped  So he is I say  Lazar  And I say that he is not only alive but in good health sound as a biscuit and sprightly as a bottle of champagneand at this moment is ready to come in and give you proof positive by your own eye sight  Don San  What Don Felix  Lazar  Ay Don Felix  Don Ped  De Silva  Lazar  Ay De Silva  Don San  Of Salamanca  Lazar  Ay of Salamanca  Don Ped  I would recommend to you friend to lose a little blood and have your head shavedyou are mad  Lazar  This is enough to make me soI say he is below at this moment waiting in the parlour  Don Ped  I'll break your head you rascal  Don San  Keep your temper Stay let us see this impostor who calls himself Don Felix Bid him walk up stairs  Don Ped  Ay ay you're rightlet's see this resurrection  Lazar  In a twinkling  To the Maid  We'll take another opportunity  Exit  Don San  This is some sham some cheat but I think we shan't be easily imposed upon  Don Ped  Let me alonelet me alonehe must rise early brother who makes a fool of Don Pedro  Enter  Donna Clara  in Man's Cloaths  Clara  Signior Don Pedro after the many polite letters I have received from you I could little expect such extraordinary treatment to be kept half an hour cooling my heels among Muleteers and Lacquies  Don Ped  Sir I humbly ask your pardon But may I take the liberty to crave your name or title  Clara  My name Sir is Don Felix de Silva  Don Ped  Of Salamanca  Clara  The same  Bora  Aside  Ha what's thiswhy this is Donna Clara the sister of Felixlet's see what will be the end of this  Don Ped  I'm struk dumb with amazementSir I rejoice to see you safe and soundwhich indeed is a little extraordinary considering we had heard you was dead and buried    Aside to  Don San  I wish with all my heart he was under ground  Clara  It was reported I know that I was dead but in fact I only received a flesh wound in a quarrel a fainting fit succeeded the loss of blood and gave occasion to the report of my deathbut the moment I recovered strength enough to travel I mounted my horse and set out to pay my respects and keep my engagement  Don Ped  I really don't know what to say to it you have the appearance of a gentleman but I have had such assurances that Don Felix was dead that unless I have some strong proofs to the contrary you'll pardon me Sir I mean no harm but truly in a matter of this consequence a little caution you know  Clara  Sir you're perfectly rightbut here are proofshere are no less than four lettersthis is from the Governor of the Bankyou know the hand and seal I suppose  Bora  To Clara  Sir will you permit me to congratulate you upon your recovery and your arrival in Grenada  Clara  Aside  Ha confusion my old host of Salamancahe'll certainly know and will discover me I think I recollect you friend  Bora  I believe you may your honourmy face is no stranger at SalamancaJoseph Borachio is as well known as the high road to Madrid  Clara  True true I know I was acquainted with youhark a worddon't betray me and this purse has a twinbrother as like it  aside to Borachio  Bora  Never fear Madamthere's something so engaging in your countenance and so persuasive in your manner that I would as soon pull down my sign as discover you  Aside to Clara  Aloud  I am for want of a better the master of the Eagle hardby and will be bold to say that for good treatment soft beds wholesome food and old wine Joseph Borachio will not give the wall to any publican in Grenada  Clara  Get your best apartments ready and I'll order my baggage there  Don Ped  Why certainly these letters are addressed to Don Felixbut there are ways you know of getting another man's lettersat the same time Sir  Clara  Nay Sir if you still doubthere's my old acquaintance Joseph Borachio he knows me I suppose you'll take his word tho' you seem a little suspicious of mine  Bora  Lord Sir I'll give my oath to him    Aside    I tell twenty lies every bill I bring up for half a dollar and the Devil's in my conscience if I can't tell one for a purse full of dubloons  Don Ped  Sir I ask a thousand pardons my doubts are vanishedyou certainly are Don Felix    To  Don San  What do you think of this brotherinlaw that was to be  Don San  Why I think 'tis a little unlucky that the dead should get out of their graves to prevent our being relations  Enter  Ferdinand  and  Leonora  Leonora  Did you send for me father  Don Ped  I did send for you my dearbut matters are a little changed within this half hour  Clara  Is that young Lady your daughter Don Pedro  Don Ped  Ay Sir that is my daughter  Clara  This then is the young lady I must pay my addresses toI hope Madam the consent of our families to my happiness has made no unfavourable impression against the person of your humble servant  Leon  What can I say to himYes SirNo Sir  Clara  An odd receptionYes SirNo Sir Pray Sir    To  Don Pedro  how am I to understand the Lady  Don Ped  She's a little bashful at presentshe'll be more intelligible by and byshe is not much acquainted with you yetshe'll come to presently  Clara  I hope soThis gentleman    to  Ferdinand  I suppose is a friend of the familya near relation  Ferd  A friend of the family certainly but no other way a relation than as I am to call this Lady my wife  Don San  Right stick to thatdon't give up your pretensionsmy boy has spiritthat young coxcomb won't carry it so swimmingly  Aside  Clara  How's this I don't understand you Siryour wifeWhat does that Lady intend to have two husbands  Don Ped  Young gentleman pray come with me here has been a small mistakeYour supposed deathbut I'll explain every thing to you within depend upon it I shall fulfil my engagements  Ferd  But hark'e SirI suppose you are a cavalier of honour and don't imagine that the affections of a young Lady are thrown into the bargain when the old folks are pleased to strike up a contract you'll ask Donna Leonora's consent I hope  Clara  I don't know that People of fashion never embarrass themselves with such vulgar ideas Lawyers do all that's necessary on such occasionsif the conveyances are right affection and that old stuff follow of course you know  Don San  This fellow ought to have been a Sovereign Prince by his notions of matrimony he'll take the wife let who will chuse the woman as Kings are obliged to wed for the good of their subjects this libertine takes a helpmate for the benefit of his creditors I suppose he'd marry a Mermaid if there was a good Fishing Bank entail'd upon her  Clara  Sir I have not been so unsuccessful in gallantry as to apprehend that the Lady will object to me  Ferd  Sir I perceive you have a very favourable opinion of yourself but it would be more to the purpose if you could persuade the Lady to have the same partiality But Sir a word in your ear You and I must talk of this matter in another place you understand me  Touches his sword and Exit  Don San  Bravo well saidhe's a chip of the old blockDon Pedro or brotherinlaw that was to be you and I must talk of this matter in another placeyou understand me  Touches his sword and Exit  Don Ped  Oh Lord Oh Lord  Clara  But charming Leonora these gallants are so warm they have not allowed you an opportunity to speak for yourself What do you say to me fair creature  Leon  I say that I look at you with horror and that my evil genius sent you here to destroy my happiness  Don Ped  What will become of me I shall have a quarrel with that old ruffian in spite of me I'll after him and try what can be done with my daughter by coaxingif that fails I must even have recourse to the old fatherly expedients of locking up and a diet of bread and water  Clara  Hold a momentfor Heaven's sake no harshness Leave your daughter to me a little time and my attention may perhaps bring her to reason But in the interim Sir as I have occasion for some ready cash and my letters of credit are upon you I must trouble you for pistoles  Don Ped  With pleasure Sir I have not so much cash about me but if you will take the trouble just to step to the next street  Clara  I am much oblig'd to you and will take the liberty to send my servant I can depend upon his honesty  Exeunt  SCENE  changes to the Hotel  Enter  Borachio  Bora  Well I know not how this will end for other folks but it has had a very promising beginning for me alreadya hundred pistoles for keeping a secret which I could not get a Maravedi for discovering Then there can be no fault found with my charges or my entertainment tho' I serve up Crows for Partridges and a delicate Ramcat for a fricasee of Rabbits But here comes my Adventurer  Enter to him  Clara  Clara  Borachio a word with you as you know who I am 'tis to no purpose to make a secret of any part of my history My brother you know is dead died at Salamanca but you don't yet understand why I have assumed his sex and character  Bora  I shall be glad to learn it my sweet young Lady especially if I can be of any service to you  Clara  My poor brother made too free with some choice wine at a vento near Salamanca Octavio my lover happen'd to be of the party a quarrel ensued between my brother's company and a set of strangers who had just arrived at the same place in the fray my brother was run thro' the body and left dead on the spotthe officers of justice had orders to search for and seize all who were present as principals in the murder to avoid the pursuit Octavio as I was informed fled hither and with the wardrobe credentials and the name of my brother here I have followed him  Bora  Ay Madam you was always a young Lady of spirit and egad I love spirit and tho' I was never to touch a pistole of the other purse you was pleased  to promise me I would no more tell your secret than I would tell my guests my own secret how I turn alicant into burgundy and sour cyder into champagne of the first growth of France  Clara  I rely upon youBut I wish to see my apartment pray inquire for my Servant and bid him come to me immediately I order'd him to wait for me near the Prado  Bora  May I ask where you pick'd up that fellow  Clara  I found him in my journey He's an odd mixture of simplicity and cunning but I have no reason to suspect his honesty and that's the quality for which at present I have most occasion  Exeunt  SCENE  A Hall in the Hotel  Lazarillo  alone  Lazar  My master desired me to wait for him in the street but I see no sign of him'tis twelve by the clock but by my guts at least four There is no watch clock or pendulum in the city that points to the dining hour with more certainty than the machinery of my bowels I feel a craving that must be satisfied Odzooks what a delicate flavour of roast boil'd and bak'd issues from these purlieus The very smell is enough to create an appetite Ay that way lies the kitchenI know it by the attraction of the odour I'll downbut hold not a sous by Fortunemy purse is as empty as my belly  Enter  Octavio  a drunken Porter following with a Portmanteau  Octa  Come along you drunken rascal  Porter  Not a step further without payment  Octa  Why scoundrel would you have your hire before you earn it  Porter  Ay that I wouldas I'd like to make sure of my straw before I was to sleep on itpay me directly or here I stick as fast as a mule up to the girths in the mire  Octa  Carry in the portmanteauthere's the door

beef in it    Goes up to the Porter    Why you drunken staggering  sputtering beast of burden with two legs and no conscience how dare you prate so saucily to a gentleman Reel off or I'll teach you manners  Beats off the Porter and then carries in the portmanteau  Porter  So I find I'm to have no payment The Corregidor shall hear of it  Exit  Octa  A good smart fellow thatlooks like a Servant if he has no Master I'll hire him  Reenter  Lazarillo  Come hither frienddo you know me  Lazar  No Sir I only know that you are a gentlemanthat is I don't know you are a gentleman but I have a strong suspicion of it You look for all the world as if you would not let a man who wanted his dinner and had an excellent stomach go without it  Octa  Are you acquainted with the tavern  Laza  I think I am very well acquainted with it The cellars are full of old wine the larder full of butcher's meat and poultrywould make a man's mouth water but to look at them Sir does your honour smell nothing  Octa  SmellNo  Lazar  Lord bless me Sir why there are such steams from savoury pies such a fumette from plump partridges and roastingpigs that I think I can distinguish them as easily as I know a rose from a pink or jonquiel from a colly flower  Octa  Are you at present in service have you any master  Lazar  Aside  I'll tell a bouncing lie and disown my master No Sir  Octa  You seem to be a ready intelligent fellowWill you be my servant  Lazar  Will I eat when I'm hungry Will I sleep when I'm weary Can your honour doubt it command me Sir from one extremity of the kingdom to the othergive me but as much as will keep cold air out of my stomach and I can never tire in your service Then as for wages to be sure my last master was a very princely sort of a gentlemanhe gave me Sir  Octa  No matter whatI shan't be more difficult to please or less generous to reward than he wasWhat's your name  Lazar  Lazarillo Sir  Octa  I will employ you immediately Go to the posthousetake this pistoleinquire if there are any letters for Don Octavio of Salamanca and bring them here to me  Octavio goes in  Lazarillo  alone  Well done Lazarillobetween two stools they say a certain part of a man comes to the ground but 'tis hard indeed if I don't take care of myself between two masters  Enter to him  Clara  and  Borachio  Clara  So my gentleman is this your attention to my commands I order'd you to wait for me at the PradoI might have look'd for you it seems till morning if by meer accident I had not found you here  Lazar  By your honour's leave I waited for you till my very bowels began to yearnsuch a craving came upon me that had pikes pistols and pettera  oes opposed my passage I cou'd not avoid entering the house in hopes of  Clara  No pratinggo directly order my baggage to be brought hither then run to the post and inquire if there are any letters for Don Felix or Donna Clara of Salamanca and bring them to me directly  Lazar  Here Sir  Clara  Yes here to this Hotel  Lazar  Aside  Zounds what shall I do with my other master  Bora  The postoffice is but in the next street if you shou'd miss your way returning inquire for me  Lazar  For you and pray who are you Sir  Bora  Joseph Borachio the master of the Eagle every body knows me  Lazar  So Sir you are the master of this house  Bora  I am  Lazar  Then you are a happy man I had a respect for the roundness of your belly and the illumination of your nose the first glimpse I had of you but now my respect is encreased to adoration If you leave money for masses for your soul take my advice get the Fathers instead of praying you out of Purgatory into Paradise to pray you back into your own kitchen In my opinion no Paradise can be superior to it  Clara  Lose no time with my baggage and my letters  Exit  Lazar  I fly Sir  Exit  Enter  Octavio  at an opposite door to  Borachio  Octa  If this be true that Felix is still alive I need conceal myself no longeryou say you saw him  Bora  Saw him yes Sir saw him and conversed with him  Octa  A very sudden recovery but since 'tis so  I have no business here I'll just send for my letters and then back to Salamanca Borachio  Bora  Sir  Octa  Let me have horses ready I shall set out this evening  Bora  This evening why your honour has had no time to refresh yourself Our roads of late are none of the safest after sunset Why Sir not above a week ago a calash of mine with a young cavalier and his new married bride were attacked on the highroad by six of the most desperate banditti that ever cried  stand  to a traveller  Octa  Indeed  Bora  Too true Sir two of my best mules were shot dead at the first discharge of their carbines they wounded the gentleman stunn'd my drivers and rifled the poor young lady in a terrible manner In truth your honour had better not think of venturing 'till morning when you have the day fairly before you  Octa  No hang it such fellows seldom attack single traveller besides if your horses are good I think I could outgallop them  Bora  I'll answer for the horses better never came out of Andalusiathey have straw up to their withers and barley they may bury their ears inpoor dumb beasts I take as much care of them and love them as well as if they were my fellow Christians  Octa  What noise is that Away landlord and order the horses  Exit Borachio  Enter  Lazarillo  with Porters following him  Lazar  This way this way my ladswhat the deuce my last master here still  To the porters  Fall back rascals and wait for me in the passage  Exit porters  Octa  Lazarillo  Lazar  Sir  Octa  I shall set out for Salamanca presently  Lazar  Before dinner Sir  Octa  Yes directly  Lazar  Mercy on me no pity on my stomach Truly Sir I am but a bad traveller on an empty bellyI get such whims and vertigoes the wind plays such vagaries in the hollow crannies of my entrails that you will have more trouble with me than if I was a sick baboon or a breeding lady of quality  Octa  I sent you to the post where are my letters quick quickwhat are you fumbling about  Lazar  Patience Sir a little patience I thought I put them into this pocketno they are not there then they must be in the other pocket  Aside  The letters are so unwilling to come out for fear they should be obliged to bear witness against meI have mixed the letters of both my masters and curse me if I know which I ought to give him  Octa  You tedious booby where are my letters  Lazar  Here Sir here are three of them but they are not all for your honour I'll tell you Sir how I came by them As I was going to the post I met an old fellow servant who happen'd to be in a great hurry upon another errand and he desired me to ask for his master's letters and keep them for him one of them belongs to him but which I don't know for to tell you the truth Sir my parents found I had such fine natural parts they would not throw away money in having me taught any thing so reading was left out among some other little accomplishments in my education  Octa  Let me see them I'll take my own and give you back what belongs to your friend's master    Takes  the letters    What's this To Donna ClaraClara in Granada  Lazar  Have you found the letter Sir that belongs to my comrade  Octa  Who is your comrade  Lazar  An old fellowservant of mine a very honest fellow I have known him from a boy when he was not this high please your honour  Octa  His name puppy  Lazar  His name Sirhis nameLopez Sir  Octa  Where does this Lopez live  Lazar  Starve me if I can tell Sir  Octa  How then could you know where to carry him the letter  Lazar  Oh for that matter Sir I'll tell your honour that in a moment  Octa  Well out with it  Lazar  Putting his hand to his cheek  Deuce take it I am stung to the bone I believe  Octa  What's the matter  Lazar  A Muskito Sir a little peevish whizzing bloodsucking vermin I wish Pharoah had banished them beyond the Red Sea with lice and locusts and all the venomous things of Jerusalem  Octa  Where I say were you to meet Lopez  Lazar  I ask pardon Sirin the Piazza  Octa  What am I to think of this  Lazar  Dear Fortune get me out of this puzzle  aside  Won't your honour give me my comrade's letter  Octa  No I have occasion for it I must open it  Lazar  Open another gentleman's letter Why Sir 'tis reckoned one of the most unmannerly pieces of friendship a gentleman can be guilty of  Octa  Peace I sayI am too much interested to mind forms at present  Reads  Madam  Your sudden departure from Salamanca has occasioned the greatest consternation among your friends They have made all possible enquiries and have discovered that you left this town in your brother's cloaths and the general opinion is that you are gone in pursuit of Octavio who was known to pay his addresses to you at Salamanca I shall not fail to communicate any further intelligence of your affairs which comes to my knowledge and I remain with great respect  MANUEL  Lazar  He little cares what may happen to me from his curiosity  Aside  Octa  Clara fled from Salamanca and in pursuit of me Find this Lopez instantly bring him here and I'll reward him for his intelligence  Lazar  Yes Sir give me the letter that belongs to him But how am I to account for its being open'd This may bring an imputation upon my honour about which I am amazingly punctilious  Octa  Your honour Mungrel say the letter was open'd by mistake and instantly find Lopez  Exit  Lazarillo  alone  Lazar  Find Lopez gad if I do I shall be a lucky fellow for I know no such person Lazarillo thou hast a headpiece never fails thee at a pinch if I could but read and write l'd turn author and invent tales and storybooks But what the duce shall I say about opening the letter let me see is there no way to disguise it I remember my mother used to make wafers with bread and water I have a few crumbs in my pocket and with a little mouthmoistening I don't see why it shou'd not answer here  goes for an experiment  Takes bread out of his pocket and chews it  Gadzooks it has slipp'd down my throatit would not go against nature My mouth's like the hole of a till whatever goes in falls to the bottom I'll take more care this time There it is  seals the letter  I think it will do After all what signifies how a letter's sealed provided he likes the contents of it  Enter  Clara  Clara  Was you at the post did you get my letter  Lazar  Yes Sirthere it is    gives the letter    Clara  Why this letter has been open'd  Lazar  Impossible  Clara  I say it has and here it has been patch'd up again with a piece of bread  Lazar  Agad that's very extraordinary  Clara  Confess villain what trick has been play'd with my letterthe truth instantly or    seizing him    Lazar  Hold Sir have a little patience and I'll tell the truth if you frighten me I shall never be able to tell it  Clara  Quick then this moment  Lazar  Then Sir it was I open'd it  Clara  Impudent varlet for what purpose  Lazar  A mistake nothing but a mistake as I am a Christian I thought it was directed to me and I open'd it  Clara  And read it  Lazar  No Sir no upon my veracity I read nothing but the first word and finding it was not for me I clapp'd in a wafer directly just as your honour sees it  Clara  You are sure no other person saw it  Lazar  Sure of it I'll take my oath As I am an honest man as I hope to die in my bedif your honour has a book about you I'll swear by it Any other person no no Lord Sir I was never so much grieved in my life as when it was open'd I gave myself a great knock in the head for vexation I believe you may see the mark of it here just over my left eyebrow  Clara reads the letter  Lazar  There's something in that letter does not please him I shall have enough to do to manage my two masters  Clara  There are the keys of my baggage get my things ready for dressing  Exit  Enter  Don Pedro  at an opposite door  Don Ped  Is your master at home  Lazar  No Sir  Don Ped  Do you expect him back to dinner  Lazar  O yes by all means Sir  Don Ped  Give him this purse when he returns with my complimentsthere are two hundred pistoles in it I shall wait upon him myself in the evening  Gives a purse to Lazarillo and Exit  Lazar  Yes Sirbut curse me if I know which of my masters tis intended for I'll offer it to the first of them I see and if it does not belong to him I suppose he won't take it  Enter  Octavio  Octa  Have you found Lopez  Lazar  No Sir not yet but I have found a better thing for you  Octa  A better thing what's that  Lazar  Only a pursefull of money I believe there are two hundred pistoles in it  Octa  I suppose it was left by my Banker  Lazar  You expected money Sir  Octa  Yes I left a letter of credit with him  Lazar  Oh then there can be no doubt it was left for you Sir Give it to your master says heyes Sir says I so there's the money  Octa  Hold lock up this money till I want ittake care put it up safely for I shall soon have occasion for it But go find Lopez and bring him to me immediately  Exit  Lazar Alone  Go find Lopez and bring him to me immediatelybut where I shall find him is another matterI'll go look for what I am sure of finding a good dinner What a fortunate fellow was I not to make any mistake about the moneyIf a man takes care in great matters small things will take care of themselvesor if they shou'd go wrong if the gusts of illlook shou'd make his vessel drive a little honesty is a sheetanchor and always brings him up to his birth again  Exit  END OF THE FIRST ACT  ACT II  SCENE I  Don Pedro's House  Enter  Clara  and  Leonora  Clara  I HAVE told you my story I rely upon your honouryou will not discover me  Leon  Don't fear me You have relieved me from such anxiety by your friendly confidence that I wou'd rather die than betray younay what is still more I wou'd rather lose my lover  Clara  Of that there can be no dangerlet matters proceed to the utmost the discovery of my sex puts an end at once to any impediment from my claim to you  Leon  But may I not tell Ferdinand  Clara  No Pray indulge me a secret burns in a single breast it is just possible that two may keep it but if 'tis known to a third I might as well tell it to the Cryer and have it proclaimed at the Great Door of every Church in Granada  Leon  Well you shall be obey'd depend upon it I will be faithful to you Men give themselves strange airs about our sex we are so unaccustom'd they say to be trusted that our vanity of a confidence shews we are unworthy of it  Cla  No matter what they say I think half of their superiority lies in their beards and their doublets Since I have worn man's apparel I find many strange inclinations coming upon me I begin to strut to swagger to look big to run my head into quarrels and the Lord knows what tho' I am at the bottom  as arrant a coward as a Turkeycockhe bristles and swells if you retreat from him but his crest falls and his tail drops if you advance one step to meet him  Don Ped  Within  Leonora  Leon  My father calls me farewell dear Clara shou'd you want my assistance you know you may command me  Exit  Enter  Ferdinand  Ferd  So Sir I have found you Do you know me Sir  Clara  I have so many acquaintances whom I should wish not to know that I don't like to answer that question suddenly  Ferd  Do you take me for a sharper youngster  Clara  Sharpers wear good cloaths  Ferd  And puppies wear long swords What means that piece of steel dangling there by thy effeminate side Is thy soft hand too weak to touch it Death to be rivall'd by a puppet by a thing made of cream Why thou compound of fringe lace and powder darest thou pretend to win a Lady's affections Answer stripling can'st thou fight for a Lady  Clara  Aside  He's a terrible fellow I quake every inch of me but I must put a good face upon it I'll try what

honour must prevent me without her permission  Exit  SCENE  changes to the Hotel  Two Doors are placed obliquely at opposite sides of the Stage as entrances to different Chambers  Enter  Lazarillo  Lazar  I have often heard that gentlemen that is fine gentlemen had no conscience but I believe the truth is they have no stomachs they seem to think of every thing but eating and for my part I think of nothing else But here comes one of my masters  Enter  Clara  with a Paper  Clara  Has Don Pedro been here to enquire for me  Lazar  Truly Sir I can't tell  Clara  Was he here  Lazar  Ay that he was certainly  Clara  Did he leave nothing with you for me  Lazar  Not that I know of  Clara  What no money  Lazar  Money  Clara  Ay moneyI expected a purse with pistoles  Lazar  I believe I have made a small mistake The purse belongs to this master and I gave it to the other  Aside  Are you certain you expected a purse with pistoles  Clara  Certainyeswhat does the fellow stare at  Lazar  You are sure they were not for another gentleman that shall be nameless  Clara  Is the booby drunk  Lazar  It must be with wind then Why Sir I did receive a purse with the sum you mention and from Don Pedro but whether it was intended for you is a point that requires some consideration  Clara  What did Don Pedro say to you  Lazar  I'll tell you Sir Friend says Don Pedro there are pistoles for your master  Clara  Well dolt head and who is your master  Lazar  There's the point nowthere's the puzzle Ah Sir there are many things you would not find it easy to explain though you was educated at Salamanca and are no doubt a great scholar  Clara  Give me the money fool and no more of your impertinence  Lazar  There it is Sir Heaven do you good with it I think I know some people who wou'd be glad of just than sum especially if they thought they had a right to it  Clara  No moreI expect Don Pedro bid Borachio get a good dinner and here take this letter of credit lock it up carefully I shall have occasion for a good deal of cash and this way 'tis most portable be careful of it and make no mistakes I expect dinner to be ready as soon as I return  Exit  Lazarillo  alone  You shall not wait a moment This is the pleasantest order I have yet received from either of my masters Here comes BorachioI'll try if my host understands any thing of a table  Enter  Borachio  Signior Borachio or Master Borachio or Don Joseph de Borachio you come most opportunely We must have a dinner immediately  Bora  Name your hour I am always prepared two hours hence an hour half an hourmy Cooks are the readiest fellows  Lazar  Ay but this must not be one of your every day dinners the first thing comes to hand toss'd up and warm'd over again neither hot nor cold like a day in the beginning of Aprilthat's villainous  Bora  Do you think I have kept the first tavern in the city so long not to know how to please a gentleman  Lazar  Some gentlemen are easily pleas'd other gentlemen are hard to be pleas'd now I'm of the latter order  Bora  Gentleman forsooth  Lazar  A gentleman's gentleman that is my master's master in most things but in the business of his eating absolute and uncontroulable  Bora  Very well Sir then let me know your orders  Lazar  Master Borachio learn to respect a man of science I liv'd two years with a Canon of the Estremadurathe greatest eater in all Portugal a churchman who did not eat to live but lived to eathe thought of nothing else dreamt of nothing else I have rode ten miles in a morning to get him a partridge that fed upon green corn and a black lobster with the pea in it What do you think he discharged me for  Bora  Good faith I know not  Lazar  For putting six pullets eggs into a venison pasty  Bora  Indeed  Lazar  If I had robb'd a Church and committed sacriledge he cou'd not have been more outrageous He call'd it blasphemy a crying sin against the first elements of cookery I see him this moment before mehis huge paunch blown up like a feather bed his gouty legs resting on two down pillows his eyes  sparkling his mouth watering the napkin tucked under his rosy gills and the whole pie devour'd in imagination before he had tasted a morsel of it but when it was uncovered when he saw the eggsAss Blockhead Villain cried he Eggs in a brown pie Eggs in a brown pie out of my sight and let me never see thee more  Bora  Was there no way to appease him  Lazar  I knew it was in vain so did not attempt itbut come Master Borachio let us have your idea of a dinner  Bora  To courses to be sure  Lazar  Two courses and a desert  Bora  Five in the first and seven in the second  Lazar  Good  Bora  Why in the middle I wou'd have a rich savoury soup  Lazar  Made with CrawfishGood  Bora  At the top two delicate white Trout just fresh from the river  Lazar  Good Excellent go on go on  Bora  At the bottom a roast Duck  Lazar  A scavanger an unclean bird a wadling glutton his bill is a shovel and his body but a dirtcart away with your Ducklet me have a roast Turkey plump and full breasted his craw full with marrow  Bora  You shall have it  Lazar  Now for the side dishes  Bora  At one side stew'd venison at the other an English plum pudding  Lazar  An English plum pudding That's a dish I am a stranger to How do you make it  Bora  You take a proper quantity of plums and raisins spice marrow and brandy crumbs of bread and flower mix them well together boil it and so serve it up to table  Lazar  It soulds like a recipe to an apothecary I'll try it The English are a good sort of a rich proud melancholy generous unreasonable seafaring sort of people fight too like their own mastiffs and bear taxes as an Elephant does palanquins and rice bags but I'm not very fond of their cookery Now Signior Borachio to your second course  Bora  Roast lamb at the top partridge at the bottom jelly and omlette on one side pig and ham at the other and Olla Podrida in the middle  Lazar  All wrong all wrongwhat shou'd be at the top you put at the bottom and two dishes of pork at the same side It won't doit will never do I tell you  Bora  How wou'd you have it I can order it no better  Lazar  It will never do Mind I don't find fault with the things the things are good enough very good but half the merit of a service consists in the manner in which you put it on the table Pig and ham at the same side Why you might as well put a Hebrew Jew into the same stall at Church with the Grand Inquisitor Mind me do but mind me see now suppose this floor was the table  Goes upon one knee and tears the bank note left him by his master  Here's the top and there's the bottomput your partridge here    places a piece of the bank note    your lamb there    another piece of the bank note    there's top and bottom Your jelly in the middle    another piece of the note    Olla Podrida and pig at this side together    two pieces of the note    and the omlette and ham at this    two pieces more of the note    There's a table laid our for you as it shou'd be    Looking at it with great satisfaction    Enter  Clara  and  Don Pedro  Clara  Hey day what are you about on your knees there  Lazar  Shewing mine host how to lay out your honour's dinner I'm no novice at these mattersI'll venture a wagerthere are the dishes  Clara  Get up puppyWhat's this as I live the letter of credit I left with him to put up for me all torn to pieces  Lazar  Oh the devil I was so full of the dinner every thing else slipp'd out of my memory  Aside  Upon my soul Sir I quite forgot it I was so taken up about the main chance I quite forgot the value of the paper  Clara  Dolt Ideot A letter of credit for no less than four hundred pistoleswhat amends can you make for such inconceivable stupidity  Bora  To Lazarillo  The merit of a dinner consists you know in the manner in which you put the things on the table This was a confounded dear dinner truly  Lazar  Plague upon it it was your fault and not mine it never wou'd have happen'd if you had served up the course properlypig and ham at the same side Such a blunder was never heard of  Clara  To Don Pedro  What can I do with this fellow  Don Ped  The mischief is not without remedy You must take up the pieces join them and paste them on a sheet of paper Your Bankers won't refuse it  Clara  Hear youdo you understand Don Pedro  Lazar  Perfectly But in truth Sir Borachio's stupidity was enough to drive every thing out of one's memory He wanted Sir  Clara  Silence take these fragments and join them  as Don Pedro directed you Make haste and attend at dinner  Lazar  Yes Sir They'll make twenty mistakes if I am not present to direct them  Exit  Don Ped  Really young gentleman nothing cou'd be more apropos than your arrival A day's delay longer had lost you your mistress and a good portion into the bargain Have you seen any thing of Ferdinand your rival since  Clara  Yes and was upon the point of a most desperate combat but your daughter stepp'd in and he ran to her for protection but I frightened him soundly  Don Ped  Indeed  Clara  It must be some very great some extraordinary provocation makes me draw but when once my sword is out I'm never tired of fighting 'tis as natural to me as the cloaths on my back  Don Ped  I don't doubt it I don't doubt it I was the same myself when I was young but what with a little gout and rheumatism in my arms and better than three score years over my head my appetite for the duello is somewhat abated so do you hear Felix when your hand's in if you wou'd frighten Sancho a little for me it wou'd not be amiss He left me when I saw him last with a menace and ever since I think I have him before my eyes flourishing a long toledo  Clara  Leave him to me I can manage him as easily as his son I wou'd as soon fight two as one of them  Don Ped  Don Sancho besides was bred a soldier Commerce and money dealing have been my business To take a man in his own trade is a great disadvantage I might as soon think of working miracles with St Jago or killing a man secundumartem with Doctor Fillgrave the first physician in Granada  Clara  Right Sir right leave it to me and you shall never hear more of it  Don Ped  'Tis not that I am afraid only being out of practice I am a little unwilling  Clara  I understand I understand I have felt just the same way more than once  Don Ped  To think at my time of life of fighting myself out of the world with cold iron when fur and flannel can hardly keep me warm in it wou'd be a very absurd piece of precipitation  Clara  You are perfectly right  Don Ped  Then do you consider how difficult it is to bring an old man up to my years As to your young people they die and are born every hour few of them come to maturity and no great matterbut a hale healthy stout old man as I am is invaluable Your young puny tender shrubs are not miss'd from a plantation but if the old tree falls think what a length of time it requires to replace him my eyes run over when I reflect upon it  Clara  No wonder there's something very melancholy in the idea  Don Ped  That all the care I took of myself shou'd be thrown awaynever exposing myself to the night air never fatiguing myself beyond a gentle perspiration so careful of my diet so regular in my hours so chaste in my amours and after all this in the evening of my days to have a long spado run through my guts and look like a bluebreech'd fly with a corking pin sticking in it  Clara  Say no more say no more depend upon it you shall come to no mischief  Don Ped  I am prodigiously oblig'd to you I feel as if a great weight was taken off me I really am prodigiously oblig'd to you  Enter  Borachio  Bora  Gentlemen your dinner will be ready in less than half an hour  Don Ped  Half an hour can't you get it sooner to say the truth I'm a little hungry  Bora  What was order'd for you can't be ready sooner  Clara  Let us have any thing that's ready Appetite's the best sauce What say you Don Pedro  Don Ped  Ay aybetter than all the cooks in France Let me have something soft that can be chew'd easily some spoonmeat for to tell the truth my teeth are none of the stoutest  Bora  Then be pleased to step into that room and you shall have something immediately  Clara    To  Don Pedro  I follow you pray no ceremony  Exeunt  Enter  Lazarillo  with a napkin under his arm  Lazar  Here waiters waiters what are the fellows deaf I knew nothing would be done 'till I got among them  Enter first Waiter with a dish    st Wait  Who calls here  Lazar  What have you got there where are you going    st Wait  To carry it to your master  Lazar  What is it    st Wait  I don't know the cook made it not I  Lazar  Put it down I'll carry it myself    Exit    st Waiter  It smells wellWhat is it I'll try  Takes a spoon  out of his pocket  Like a good soldier or a good surgeon I never go without my arms and my instruments  Tastes the dish  Excellent faithI'll try it againbetter and betterbut here it goes for my master  Octavio meets him as he is carrying out the dish  Lazar  Cursed ill luck here's my other master  Octa  Where are you going  Lazar  Going SirSir I was goingI was going to carry this in for your honour's dinner  Octa  Carry in my dinner before you knew I was come home  Lazar  Lord Sir I knew you was coming home I happen'd just now to pop my head out of the window and saw you walking down the street so I thought you wou'd like to have your dinner on the table the moment you came in  Octa  What have you got there  Lazar  'Tis a kind of a fricasee very good I promise you  Octa  Let me have soupwhat do you bring meat before soup you blockhead  Lazar  Lord Sir nothing so common In some parts of the world soup is the very last thing brought to the table  Octa  That's not my customcarry that back and order some soup immediately  Lazar  Yes Sir  Octa  How unfortunate to have search'd so much and to have heard nothing of Clara  Exit  Lazarillo  pretending to go down returns  Now I may carry this to my first master  Goes into Clara's chamber  Enter    d Waiter with a dish    d Wait  Where is this man Lazarillo  Lazar  Running out  Who calls here I am    d Wait  Carry this to your master  Exit Waiter  Lazar  That I willgive it to me I'll carry it to the first  Going towards Clara's chamber is called from Octavio's  What do you want here I am  Enter    st Waiter with a dish    st Wait  Here's a dish for your master  Lazar  You're an honest fellow Come stir stir get the soup as fast as possible  Exit Waiter  If I can have the good fortune to serve them both without being discover'd  Going towards Clara's chamber he is called from Octavio's  Octa  Within  Lazarillo  Lazar  Coming Coming  Enter    d Waiter with a dish    d Wait  Where is this strange fellow Lazarillo  Lazar  Who calls here I am    d Wait  Do you attend one table and we'll take care of the other  Lazar  Not all not at all I'll take care of them both    Exit    d Waiter  Clara  From within  Lazarillo  Lazar  Here  Octa  Within  Lazarillo  Lazar  Patience a little patience Coming  Enter    st Waiter with a dish    st Wait  Master what's your name here's a pudding  Lazar  A pudding What pudding    st Wait  An English plumpudding  Lazar  Lay it down lay it down  Exit Waiter  This is a stranger I must be civil to him He looks like a Mulatto in the small pox Let's try how he tastes  Takes out his spoon  Excellent Admirable rich as marrow and strong as brandy    Eats again    This is meat and drink no trusting outsides This Leopardlike pudding is most divine I can't part with it    Eats again and sits down    Enter  Clara  with a cane  Clara  I must get another servant This fellow minds nothing Where are you rascal    Sees him    There he is cramming himself instead of attending me  Octa  Within  Lazarillo  Lazar  Speaking with his mouth full  In a moment in a moment  Clara  What are you about there Don't you see me  Lazar  I was justtasting this pudding for youI promise you Siryou'll like it  Clara  Why 'tis all gone  Lazar  It slips down so fast Sir you can't tell the taste of it 'till you eat a good deal  Clara  Beats him  Taste that and that and that  Lazar  Hold hold Sir for Heaven's sake take care Sir you have no right to more than one half of me t'other half belongs to another gentlemanOh oh oh  Enter  Octavio  Octa  What's this beating my servant loose your hold Sir What right have you to strike my servant  Lazar  Confusion my second master I must be discover'd  Clara  Not observing Octavio  Your servant he's my servantbut if you have taken a fancy to him he's at your service  Octa  This must not end so young gentleman servants are under the protection of their masters a blow to the fellow who receives my wages is an affront to me You must account with me for this  Clara  Seeing Octavio  By all my hopes Octavio  Lazar  Aside  If this comes to a duel and one of them falls I am for the survivor  Octa  You look surpris'd Sir What is this doctrine new to you  Clara  I am not much accustomed to menaces from those lips do you not know me Octavio  Octa  Know you  Clara  Is my voice a stranger to you Must you have stronger proofs that I am Claraif so let this embrace convince you  Octa  O unexpected happiness Art thou indeed my Clara the same sincere faithful generous Clara I knew and loved at Salamanca  Clara  The same the very same except that as you lov'd me when my brother lived and I had little I can now reward your disinterested passion with my hand my heart and an estate large enough to gratify all our wishes and to relieve the necessities of all who may want our assistance  Octa  Words are too weak my life must thank you  Clara  We shall find time enough for protestation hereaster however we are both obliged to this fellow tho' his blundering only brought us together  Lazar  Very true Madam I served you both to the best of my power but as you were to be man and wife 'tis not strange you know that I shou'd not always be able to obey one without offending the other  Clara  O very wella sufficient apology but Don Pedro's in the next room I'll step and explain what has happened and send immediately for Leonora and Ferdinand  Exit  Lazar  May I take the liberty of offering my poor congratulations on this joyful occasion Will you believe it Sir I had a sort of an inkling a divining that something of this kind would happen for I dreamt all last night of cats and dogs and a spread eagle  Octa  Your dreams I hope go by contraries and you shall be a witness of our harmony for I intend to keep you in my service  Lazar  I will be bold to say Sir you never took a wiser resolution Mercy on me Sir you don't know half I can do to serve you I was Major Domo to the first Grandee of Arragon he was call'd Don Guzman Poderoso y Chilos y Figureroz y Palidos y Fu  dos y Dumpos he was a great man Sir and had a great many names  Octa  So I perceive  Lazar  He lost his only daughter a most beautiful young Lady who broke her heart for the death of her lover and a favourite Squirrel  Octa  A very susceptible Lady truly  Lazar  O yes Sir very surreptible A certain Duke a particular friend of my master's came to condole with him for poor Grandee he was quite uncomfortable and spying me wiping my eyes in an  outward room with a Barcelona handkerchief as he was taking leave of my master says he Don Dumpos I am sorry for your misfortune but be of good heart pray be comforted if you had lost your wife as well as your daughter I should hardly know how to pity you while you possess such a treasure in a servant as the incomparable Lazarillo    Meaning me Sir    Octa  You have a ready invention  Lazar  Invention Sir I have no more invention than an oister all memory and strict truth I protest to you  Enter  Clara Pedro Borachio Leonora Sancho  and  Ferdinand  Don Ped  Joy joy I give you joy this discovery has saved us all a great deal of perplexity Our only strife now shall be who will fill the greatest quantity of bumpers to the felicity of this double Gemini of Turtles  Don San  Brotherinlaw that  is  to be give me your hand we will presently drown all animosities in a bottle of honest Borachio's best burgundy  Ferd  To Clara  Madam your ingenuity has had already such ample revenge for the rude language I used to you that I hardly know how to offer an apology for the effects of my mistaken anger  Clara  I am afraid if any apology were necessary I ought to make it for I was certainly the offender but all unkindness must give way hereafter to esteem and friendship  Lazarillo  steps forward  Lazar  To serve two masters long I strove in vain  Hard words or blows were all my toils cou'd gain  But their displeasure now no more can move  If you  to the audience  my kinder masters but approve  FINIS
