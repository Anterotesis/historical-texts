simili frondescit Virga metallo  VIRG  _IT has for a long Time been an Objection to the Writer of Periodical Essays that every Subject is preoccupied that the  Spectator  the  Tatler  and the  Guardian  have cultivated every Field of Reflection and that there remains nothing at present to be gleaned by successive Adventurers Though I have all the Respect due to the Memory of the excellent Writers of the Performances just mentioned I am far from paying them a blind Adoration on the contrary amidst all that surprizing Emanation of Genius Wit and Humour which distinguishes many of their Writings I can sometimes descry a Subject carelesly treated without any of their usual Turns of Sentiment or Beauties of Diction I  have now and then gone through a Series of important Trifles and I have occasionally found them vague upon Subjects of Criticism indeterminate in their Expressions and loose in their Definitions If this happens to be the Case would it not be an erroneous Proceeding to suppress every other Attempt because Sir  Richard Steel  planned so many Years before Nay even if they were free from any of those Blemishes which arise either from Inadvertence or the Imbecillity of human Nature would it not be absurd to extinguish the Seeds of laudable Emulation Had the Rigour of this Sentence been carried into Execution the World would never have been favoured with the admirable Performances of the Author of the  Rambler  That the  English  Language has received from this Writer many additional Ornaments it is I believe universally felt by all Men of Taste Every Topic is by him treated with great Erudition and strong Sense enlivened with all the glowing Colourings of a warm Imagination and the whole carried on with a nervous clear and harmonious Stile If the Performance in general has not the Variety of the  Spectator  it is because Mr  Johnson  wrote singly and alone whereas the former was supported by several of eminent Abilities and therefore in the present Age there seems nothing wanting but a Coalition of Men of Parts to equal our Predecessors in all Manner of Periodical Writings  Certain it is there are many Topics in every branch of Science and in all the liberal Arts which may still receive new Lights and conduce both to the Entertainment and Instruction of the Public Since Mr  Addison  's Time a  Du Bos  has shone forth in  France  and a  Spence  in  England  and the late ingenious Editor of a Translation of  Virgil  is a convincing Proof that Rules for fine Writing and Precepts of critical Knowledge may be still enforced with great Elegance and Propriety though the Essays on  Milton  's  Paradise Lost  and  on the  Pleasures of Imagination  must be allowed to have all the masterly Strokes that can result from a delicate and refined Taste The Regions of Reflection are like a Champain Country in which different Objects present themselves in various Attitudes to the Eye and the Imagination is frequently caught by Parts of the Prospect which have escaped another's Observation each Person receiving different Sensations according as the Fancy is disposed for the Sublime the Wonderful or the Beautiful in the natural World  Besides the continual Fluctuation of Fashions Customs and Manners must always afford fresh Matter for the Satyrist of Wit and Humour The Tree of Folly is like the Tree mentioned by the Author of my Motto though many have plucked a Branch from it it is always quickly replaced by another and the new Growth shoots into Daylight with undiminished Fertility  Are there those who are pleased to indulge a delicate Vein of Raillery on the Foibles and Piccadillos of the Fair Never was there more ample room to display a Turn of Wit in this Way than what the present Times are so happy as to afford The Hoop has of late swelled to a wider Circumference than ever and by the Help of a few formidable Rows of Steel threatens Mischief to the whole Circle of Beaux who cannot now approach the Ladies in their Entrenchments without manifest Danger of fracturing a Shinbone hurting the Pan of the Knee or some such Disaster While this Fashion prevails the Ladies may be charged with carrying concealed Arms and making Use of masked Barteries for which by the Way they have no manner of Occasion as they seem at present to be in Possession of more Courage than any  Amazon  mentioned in History For whereas those Viragos used to encounter with ONLY ONE BREAST EXERTED the modern Ladies are not afraid of meeting the Men with both quite naked and displayed to View The Head is also  built up many Stories higher than it used to be and the Art of Painting is now arrived to such Perfection that it is absolutely impossible to know a female Acquaintance for any length of Time each lovely Fair having as many Faces and Complexions as Gloves Fans or Tippets Add to this that you may meet a Lady Today with an elegant Shape fine by Degrees and delicately less and Tomorrow she will appear as big round the Waist as if within a few Days of her Time Besides this  Cribbidge  has suppressed the Reign of Love and  Cupid  minds nothing now but cogging the Dice or procuring a PairRoyal at Brag and indeed the present happy Disposition for Luxury and every Vice Folly Whim Foible Humour and Extravagance seems to promise a very plentiful Crop every Year so that after a Survey of this Metropolis we may say with Mr  Addison  in his Prologue to the tender Husband  Here's still Encouragement for those that write  On this Account though I have now felt the Anxiety of a Writer for twelve Months past I have resolved with myself not to lay down my Pen until I am warned to do it by the Lassitude of an Author or what is worse the Lassitude of the Reader At present however I do not find any Symptoms of this Sort in my own Breast nor can I learn that my Paper declines with my Readers In my Rambles since last  Saturday  I did not meet with any Thing that made against me At  Sam  's Mr  Wood  informed me that his Customers hope I am not going to leave off Trade A Stationer at the  Chapter  Coffeehouse in St  Paul  's  Churchyard  call'd with some Earnestness for the  Gray'sInn Journal  and having Possession of it he moistened a Corner of it with the Tip of his Tongue and then holding it up to the Light "really says he its  a very good Paper"  At most Places in  Fleetstreet Joe Clare  with a Pinch of Snuff between his Fingers and the usual Flourish of his Arm  declared highly in my Favour At the  Bedford  I could guess from some Whispers which I casually overheard that I am as striking a Character as ever  Hushthat's hethat's  Ranger  "was you ever in Company with him"  NoI should like to spend an Evening with him  c  In the softer Climate of St  James  's Air I was told that my Bays are likely to flourish and I was particularly assured by a Gentleman who frequents the  Cocoa tree  in  Pallmall  that  Ranger  has gained Admittance there notwithstanding their Attachment to the ADVENTORER  Things standing thus I am determined to persevere in my Undertaking and I therefore take this Opportunity to renew my Application to all the Gentlemen Clergy and Freeholders of  Great Britain  In my first Number I declared myself a Candidate for their Favour and I beg a Continuance of their Votes and Interest until cogent Reaso is shall incline me to withdraw myself from their Service  N B  I was against the  Jew  Bill  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  From my RegisterOffice  Oct    IT is with great Pleasure that I begin to scent the Winter Air as I am informed by a very sensible Bookseller that an  R  in the Month is not only good for Oysters but also Writers of all Denominations The Season is now opening when all the Vices and Follies of this Metropolis will be carried on with fresh Alacrity which will undoubtedly afford Variety of Intelligence from all Quarters to collect which I shall not spare either Trouble or Expence though it must be allowed that a OneHorse Chaise during the SummerSeason and Twopence to be paid at the Bar of every Coffeehouse must in the End amount to a considerable Sum But this I shall pay very willingly and I  shall now begin to visit the several Academies of which I have formerly given an Account My Man TOM is somewhat like his Namesake in the  Conscious Lovers  and is perfectly acquainted with every  Phillis  in  London  so that I cannot fail through this Channel of receiving the car  iest Account of all Occurrences among the Ladies such as  who keeps most Card Tables who plays deepest at Whist who cheats with the best Grace who has the best Wash for the Complexion who has the handsomest Chair and many other Points of equal Moment  A notable Speaker at the  Robinhood  Society is to transmit me all the Discourses upon Religion and as to Politicks the Talkativeness of my Barber while he is dabbing his Fist about my Face and pulling my Nose into a thousand different Shapes will abundantly qualify me in that Branch and by these Means I flatter myself I shall greatly excel all my Brother Annalists and Historiographers whether they appear in daily Papers or Magazines  CoventGarden Theatre  The Tragedy of  Romeo  and  Juliet  was performed here on the  th Instant  Romeo  by Mr  Barry  and  Juliet  by Miss  Nossiter  being her first Appearance upon any Stage At her first Entrance the Delicacy of her Figure an her graceful Distress obtained for her the warmest Applause and as she grew more animated in the Progress she frequently surprized the House with the most alarming Attitudes The faultering of her Resolution whe  going to drink the composing Draught was finely marked the Fixure of her Eyes and Feebleness of her whole Person when coming forward from the Tomb and her Manner of holding her Lover's dead Body and looking at the Fryar when she cries out  you shall not tear him from me  were all happily imagined and to crown the whole her Action at stabbing  herself was a very fine and affecting Circumstance After this it may not be improper to observe that a Fondness for Attitudes may carry a Performer to an Extreme as perhaps was the Case in her standing with an uplifted Arm in act to strike when she says  as with a Club dash out their Brains  because that Position denotes an Intent to knock down another Be that as it may if this young Actress studies the Management of her Voice and attains a more simple Elocution she must prove an Acquisition to the Stage  NUMB  GRAY'sINN  Saturday Oct    Scimus inurbanum Lepido seponere dicto  HOR  _I Have in a former Paper delivered my Sentiments concerning the notable Art of Humbugging I shall this Day throw together some cursory Reflections upon the Practice of Raillery which in my Opinion it is the Interest of Society to explode from every Company  I am induced into this Way of thinking from an Observation that few People are properly qualified to exercise this Talent there being hardly any Thing which requires so fine an Understanding together with so much Delicacy in the Exertion of it But as Matters are generally managed there is nothing so coarse as the Attempts of those who are ambitious of shining in Conversation and are therefore determined to banter Mankind into an exalted Opinion of their Accomplishments The utmost that can be allowed to these Gentlemen is to join in the general Laugh and if Mirth should be going forward they may very properly be admitted to partake of the frolic Festivity without vainly pretending to take the Lead or to engross the Conversation  into their own Hands in like Manner as the uninformed Country Squire should not be suffered by the Master of the Ceremonies in a polite Assembly to come forward in a Minuet where the Graces of Movement are required though he may be tolerated to romp in a Country Dance and display all the Gambols of his unfashioned Agility  Nec cum sis caetera fossor  Tres tantum ad numeros Satyri moveare Bathylli  Were I to define Raillery I should call it a delicate Exertion of Pleasantry upon the Foibles or the slight Inadvertences which disclose themselves in the Actions of Men From this View of Matters it will appear that no Tincture of Illnature must be suffered to disfigure the Surface that only slight Errors must be the Ground on which the Colouring is laid and that good Manners must give a Polish to the Whole No Man has any Degree of Right to invade another's inward Peace and therefore a well turned Mind will always decline any Thing that comes home to the Bosom of any Person with whom he is willing to enter into Society Whatever may tend to create Disesteem in the Circle of our Acquaintance or to throw a ridiculous Light upon a Character whatever may excite uneasy Sensations by touching upon Circumstances about which it is possible a Person may have a tender Feeling though in their own Nature they are not of any material Importance in short all Topics but such as we are convinced the the Object of our Merriment will give up are carefully to be avoided and it will be always highly necessary so to glide gently over the affected Part that the Wound may appear to be probed by a skilful Hand I have somewhere read a Story of  Jack Ketch  's Wife which I think throws a Light on this Matter Any Body says that elegant Lady can tuck a Man up and stop his Breath but to do it with Dexterity and make  the Culprit die an easy pleasant Death is only the genteel Qualification of my Husband Thus it requires no very shining Abilities to inform our Neighbour of his Oddities and point out to him his slight Indiscretions but to open his Eyes and let in the Light without rendering it painful to him to give a Sense of the Foible without disturbing the natural Complacence with which every one is willing to behold himself is a Task which requires more Elegance and Refinement than happens to fall to the Share of every Individual And yet there is no going any where without meeting Pretenders in this Way every Quarter of the Town abounds with Men of Raillery and to all these it is necessary to render an Account of our Actions our Friends our Attachments our Cloaths our Walk and what not To all these notable Personages I would beg leave to recommend the following Story A Gentleman was one Day shaving himself in his Parlour to the great Admiration of  Otho  his Monkey who stood by him wonderfully pleased with the Turn of his Wrist and the Dexterity of every Stroke The Operation being finished and the Gentleman gone out without laying up his Utensils  Otho  mounts the Table fixes himself before the Glass and flourishes the Razor with mimic Skill till unfortunately he cut his Jaw across and then too late found the Danger of playing with Edge Tools  I have drawn up an allegorical Account of the Birth and Parentage of  Raillery  which I think may serve to lay before the Reader its several efficient Qualities  GOODSENSE and RIDICULE were joined in Wedlock the Offspring of their Marriage was HUMOUR who for a long Time roved about  Parnassus  placing the Follies and Whims of Mankind in such a Light as never failed to excite Mirth in the Synod of  Apollo  and the Muses At length happening to wander out of Bounds HUMOUR met upon the Borders of  Parnassus  just upon the Verge of worldly Commerce a  certain Lady known by the Name of ILLNATURE Drawn in by false Allurements and a glavering Smile which ILLNATURE always wore upon her Countenance HUMOUR offered Proposals of Marriage which were carried without Delay into Execution and in nine Months Time RAILING was ushered into the World With a small Mixture in his Composition of his Father's Qualities strongly blended with the complexional Habits of his Mother RAILING grew up in the Practice of exposing the infirmities of all who came in his Way Without Restraint he took unbecoming Liberties with private Families sowed the Seeds of Discontent in every Breast and in Time began to disturb the Harmony of the sacred Nine Whereupon  Thalia  conceived an Aversion to him and in order to mend the Breed preferred a Petition to  Apollo  to divorce HUMOUR from his Wife ILLNATURE  After a full hearing of the Cause  Apollo  issued out his Edict of Separation HUMOUR could not live single and in a short Time made another Match which as good Luck would have it turned out better than the former His second Wife's Name was WIT a Lady of great Vivacity and abounding in surprizing Turns in all her Conversation She hardly could see any Thing but her Way was instantly to compare it to some other Object in Nature and she frequently would make her Auditors laugh by pointing out a latent Resemblance in Things which seemed in their own Natures absolutely repugnant to each other Her principal Attention was to set off her Husband and though she was fond of great Variety in her Dress she would upon many Occasions lend her best Apparel to HUMOUR who never failed to look most engaging when WIT contributed her Ornaments HUMOUR in his Turn gave supernumerary Embellishments to his Wife and they both reflected a reciprocal Lustre upon each other They continued in a State of mutual Fondness and  their faithful Love was in Time rewarded with a tender Daughter who was immediately called with the general Consent by the Name of RAILERY The MUSES cherished her in their Bosoms and as she grew up she discovered a Propensity to her Father's Way of thinking but with a considerable Abatement of his Severity The Mother's Delicacy she possessed entire and whenever she touched upon any Thing like her she endeavoured to give it an agreeable Colouring In this Habit she was further confirmed by POLITENE  S a collateral Relation by the Mother's Side who took upon her the Care of her Manners and instructed her perfectly in all the secondary Qualities or lesser Morals which are commonly known by the Name of Goodbreeding Being confirmed in these Principles RAILLERY was at a mature Age trusted abroad into the World where she had not been long before she was caressed by the courtly  Horace  who took her Home to his own House introduced her to  Mecaenas  and found her of singular Service in all his Writings At the Demise of that Bard RAILLERY wandered a Vagrant up and down till at length she took it into her Head to visit  Boileau  in  Paris  from whence she came over to  England  and resided for many Years at  Twickenham  with the late Mr  Pope  from whose Retreat she would now and then make an Excursion to pass some Hours with Doctor  Young  and Mr  Addison  At present it is said that she is taken into Keeping by a certain noble Earl of whom she is so enamoured that it is confidently reported she will not quit his Company though he is now in Danger of becoming deaf and it is further said that she will stick by him to his last Breath but at that unhappy Juncture what will become of her no Body can pretend to determine  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  Oct    ON

Venus  Quintâ parte sui Nectaris imbuit  HOR  _THE following Letter came to Hand just as my Printer's Devil was at my Door to call to me for some Copy Upon Perusal it appeared to carry with it a Vein of Pleasantry not improper for my fair Readers If therefore it will serve for one half Hour to banish from their Company a certain Concomitant of the TeaEquipage called SCANDAL I shall think this Day's Paper subservient to a moral Use  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  SIR  THE  Exercise of the Fan  was proposed in the Days of the  Spectator  as a Study highly necessary to the Ladies of  Great Britain  and the Scheme offered to their Consideration included all the requisite Perfections in the Management of that pretty versatile Machine Though I must allow that Directions of this Nature were greatly conducive to a proper Display of many female Charms there is still a more useful System of Rules for the playing off Love's Artillery which I beg Leave through the Channel of your Paper to convey to the Notice of my beautiful Countrywomen The System of Rules which I here intend is the  Exercise of the Lips  and after mature Consideration I think the whole Secret may be comprized under the following Heads  Moisten your Lips  Bite your Lips  Open your Lips  Close your Lips  Pout your Lips  Rest your Lips  The Mouth being a leading Feature in the Countenance and the Seat of the Graces where all the winning Loves and each amiable Smile have planted their Allurements there cannot be too much Care employed by the Ladies to acquire a Pair of well disciplined Lips readily obedient to each of the Rules above established and capable with Quickness and Ease to perform every Branch of this delectable Exercise  With Regard to the first Word of Command a due Degree of Moisture gives a sparkling Lustre to the natural Vermillion of the Skin like Roses fresh besprinkled with the MorningDew it contributes likewise to hinder them from appearing dry and rough as is generally the Case with old Maids the least Suspicion of which the Ladies seem willing to avoid by the present Taste of extending the Shape beyond its just Proportion by a fashionable Enormity of the Stays  Biting the Lips  is attended with more Difficulty than the premised Rule because it is more complicated in its Nature and includes the Operation of the Passions There are always many Topics in Conversation upon which this Practice if well managed has a very expressive Significance When for Instance disagreeable Thoughts obtrude it serves to excite new Ideas in the Fancy it likewise prevents the unseasonable Eruption of a conscious Laugh when the Libertine Wit of  Congreve  or  Vanbrugh  provokes a betraying Simper not to mention that it helps to heighten the natural Redness of the Lip and raises a Degree of Anxiety in the Men for Fear the Delicacy of the Skin should suffer too much from too violent a Pressure  I do not doubt but it may seem perfectly easy to open the Lips but this also I take to be a Matter of no small Difficulty Very few it is observable open their Lips to any Purpose besides it should never be done with too great a Precipitance but always gradually and by due Degrees Should there happen to be drawn up within an elegant Row of beautiful white Teeth it will be sure to add greatly to the natural Bloom by exhibiting an agreeable Contrast like Ivory stained with a just Arrangement of crimson Colours On this Head it may not be improper to caution my pretty Readers against an indolent Custom of relaxing into a Yawn which distends the Mouth beyond its proper Size and generally occasions the witty Saying  Thank you for not swallowing me  Before the Lips are closed it is eligible to confer uppon them a new Refreshment of Moisture and to enliven the Colour If they were to undergo the Operation of Biting I should not think it amiss Shutting the Lips I have often remarked is extremely becoming in most Ladies and I think cannot be too much practised by old Maids Wives and indeed the Generality of Women In closing them however there are different Degrees of Pressure to be observed because in this also the Passions are concerned When they gently touch each other it gives a Variety to the Air of the Face by giving it an unusual Degree of Length but in this those who have naturally a long Visage are to be particularly cautious When somewhat compressed the Dimples in the Cheeks are displayed to Advantage and the whole Face is enlivened with a pleasing Serenity If squeezed close together it throws a beautiful Pensiveness into the Looks which is seldom acquired to any Degree of Perfection by the Generality of the Sex but when properly attained it carries with it an elegant Kind of dumb Eloquence which the  Critics have observed is often a great Beauty in Poetry and certainly has its Portion of Grace among the fair Sex I know a Gentleman who can read the Thoughts of any Lady whatever by observing the Adjustment of the Lips He tells me he has observed a Pair of Lips speak without any Motion for an Hour together and he has a List of Lips which he says are absolute Prudes others that are Rakes some that are amorous and some that are swelled with Pride and from a long Course of Enquiry he finds that they have more Electricity than any other Substance in Nature  But these Remarks belong more immediately to the following Head of  Pouting the Lips  which is more difficult than any Rule advanced as yet In doing this it will be always found expedient to moisten and bite them first that when prominent the Underlip may look as if pregnant with Delight The Passions of Scorn Indignation Contempt and the whole Family of Pride are finely marked by this Position I have known a pouted Lip to look down upon a Rival Beauty during an entire Tragedy and I have seen a Lady without uttering a single Word tell a Man that she thought him an unmannered Coxcomb by a forcible Exertion of this expressive Feature I must observe that this Practice becomes handsome Faces only to such it gives an Air of Elevation or a pretty Sullenness which throws a kind of amiable Severity over the whole Countenance Ugly Women seldom have this Art in any Perfection  The last Rule is to  Rest your Lips  and is the most neglected of any though highly essential in this beautiful Language Young Girls can never be brought to pay the least Attention to this Precept but were they sensible that when the Features are lest to display their own native Graces without Art their Charms are irresistible I am convinced this Word of Direction would be better observed This Rule is more extensive than  the foregoing because it is proper for all Ladies in general whereas the former should never be practised but by such of the Fair as are blessed with a blooming Complexion and a Delicacy of Features  The Bounds of Mr  Ranger  's Paper will not permit me to expatiate further I shall therefore at Maturity publish by Subscription an entire Book called the  Oeconomy of the Lips  in which I shall explain at large the Doctrine here delivered and I shall adapt each Article to the Make of the Countenance The whole shall be concluded with  an Essay on the Passions of the Female Lips  and to the Honour of this Part of the Face I shall prove that in these Days of  Atheism  all Religion is centered with them as what few Prayers are said at present

occasionally given vent in your  Saturday  's Compositions I have observed that there is not one of them but has some Degree of Tendency to the Instruction as well as Entertainment of your Readers On this Account I hope you will not refuse a Place in your Paper to a Correspondent who means to shew the Futility of a Maxim which has gained Credit with most People though extremely illgrounded as I think I can fairly evince from an experimental Knowledge of Mankind  You undoubtedly recollect that  Ovid  has in one of his Elegies the following Lines  Donec eris felix multos numerabis Amicos  Tempora si fuerint nubila solus eris  Now Sir it is so far from being true that a Man is surrounded with Friends in Prosperity and is left destitute under his Misfortunes that I will undertake to prove the very Reverse in doing this I flatter myself I shall serve the Purposes of Virtue and vindicate the Dignity of human Nature  You must know then that I came to this Town a few Years since with Intent to read the Law having just Fortune enough to support me in my Studies until I might fix myself in a tolerable Road of Business For this Purpose I lodged in one of the Inns of Court and  the Oeconomy which I was obliged to observe rendering it impossible for me to go much into Company I soon found out that I led a very muzzy Sort of a Life I therefore shifted the Scene and though in a short Time I found means to run out my little Fortune I cannot say that I was relinquished by the World on this Account It is true that some of my Acquaintance totally deserted me but it was the Occasion at the same Time that others were more earnestly attached than they would otherwise have been I remember the last Word my Aunt in the Country said to me was  Bob wherever you go be sure to make Friends for yourself  this Advice I will venture to say I have had the Address to conform to with great Success as will appear from the Sequel  Most of the Friendships of the World are Leagues in Debauchery and Intemperance made in the drawing of a Cork and often ended in the same Manner  Out of Sight out of Mind  is certainly true with Regard to the Generality of Connections but the Impressions I have made upon the Minds of my Friends are not so easily effaced On the contrary when it happens that I am seldom seen by them they are known to be in very great Solicitude about me are constantly very earnest in their Enquiries after me and the Discourse they usually have with each other is  Have you seen our old Friend latelyI can't think what's become of himI hope he is not gone out of TownI have not seen him for a long Timefaith I'm very uneasy about himI wish to God he would see and settle his AffairsHe's a very careless young Fellowa great deal too wild throws away his Money like DirtI have called upon him Morning after Morning but all to no PurposeI'd give a Bottle of Wine I could meet with himI'd rather that than my DinnerI never long'd so much to see any body  These are the general Expressions of Anxiety which my Friends express on my Account and there are  some of them who are not content to rest here Words cost nothing they carry the Thing to such a Length as to employ a Couple of Fellows who are daily in all Quarters of the Town hunting and prying about for me As there are few Instances of such earnest Friendship in the World I am sensible what I have said may have a romantic Appearance and Mr  Ranger  may suggest to himself that I am entertaining him all this Time with a Novel but Sir I must take Leave to assure you that every Word is literally true and what may perhaps raise your Idea still higher is not one of all these People has ever got a Shilling by me and I verily believe few of them ever will Having said thus much in the Praise of these my Wellwishers it will naturally be desired of me to inform the World who and what they are who are in such Concern about a Stranger Not to keep you any longer in Suspence I will now tell you that I have experienced all this Generosity from my CREDITORS  By this it will appear that the Pleasure of being in Debt though very common in Life is very little understood by the Generality of those who addict themselves to this Gratification The Art in all these Cases is to refine upon the Occurrences and Disappointments to which our State is liable and for my Part the Pleasure just mentioned is one of the most valuable Enjoyments of my Life My Morning  Levee  is as great as any Nobleman's whereas in the Days that that I could say I was in Possession of a Competence I never had any Visitor whatever except a Laundress to make my Bed in the  Temple  But now the Case is perfectly altered there is a constant Crowd of Attendants about my  oors and to those that are admitted I have the Pleasure of making as many Promises as a Minister of State besides a lofty Pride in keeping them much after the same Fashion Upon these Occasions it will now and then happen that they who best know  how to make their Court and have the Art of taking a pliant Hour sometimes prevail upon me to appoint a Day for the Completion of their Wishes As Things of Consequence cannot be done in a violent Hurry the Day agreed upon is generally very distant may be from six to nine or twelve Months during which Space of Time it is observable that their Goodnature never suffers the least Abatement but they remain as solicitous as ever frequently expressing the most tender Regard for my Welfare  My dear Sir do take a little Care of yourselfIt goes to my very Heart to hear you cough so hardWhy you'll not live three Months at this RateBe advised by me and put a Stocking about your Neck Tonight and take something to sweat you a little and ease your ChestYou should not drink so muchConsider it impairs both Constitution and PurseYou know it's for your Good I speakYou'd be a great Loss to your FriendsTake up a little Flesh and Blood can't hold it always  Thus Mr  Ranger  am I beloved and that for no other Reason but my Address in making Friends for myself and I am so closely watched by these generous Creatures that it is totally out of my Power to take any wrong Step that might be detrimental to my Affairs Of this I had a convincing Proof about a Year ago when the Interposition of my Taylor hindered me from committing a very inconsiderate Action I was going with a Friend to take a Trip to  Paris  by which Expedition I must certainly have been drained of all my ready Money but the Vigilance of my Friend contrived to have me stopped as I was just stepping into the PostChaise and I was thence conducted to a generous Bailiff's House in  Gray'sInn Lane  for the Sum of Three Hundred Pounds Here I remained confined till my Passion for Travel was perfectly cooled and when I was at length restored to my Liberty my abovementioned  Friends took particular Care not to leave me a single Shilling for Fear I should have the same unhappy Turn a second Time  While I thus enjoy the Assiduity and Benevolence of such a Number who are kind enough to interest themselves in my Affairs I must own there is a Species of Creditors who are an Exception to the general Rule for though all those of whom I have hitherto been speaking are upon every Occasion highly pleased to meet me this last Class detest the very Sight of me As I am not conscious that I have ever done any Thing to incur their Displeasure to so great a Degree their Aversion shocks me the more and notwithstanding all the Pains I have taken to soften them by Politeness they still remain inexorable Whenever I do not pay them what is due to them I endeavour to put them off with the handsomest Apology in my Power but all to no Purpose I have run too far in Arrears and they are not by any Means to be satisfied As I should be glad if you would give them a Word of Advice I will just hint to you that the Personages whom I mean are no other than GENTLEMEN'S SERVANTS The Cry among them all is What can a poor ServingMan do if he is robb'd of his just Vails by such Scoundrels They are all very unwilling to let me run further in their Debt and therefore it is I can hardly get any Thing out of their Hands If I call for Beer at Table they are sure not to hear me till their Master orders them to serve the Gentleman then I receive the Leavings of the Tankard just out of the Hands of the most capacious Swallow in the Company In short the Peevishness of these my Creditors is a great Discount upon my Happiness and I must confess there is no kind of Pleasure in being in Debt to them However I must endeavour to bear this Inconvenience and if you will be pleased to insert this Letter in the  Gray  's  Inn Journal  I shall be proud to get into your Books and shall have  the further Pleasure of being indebted to Mr  Ranger  for this Act of Civility which will always oblige me to be  Sir  Your most obedient Servant And sincere Wellwisher  ROBERT DUNSSCOPE  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford

GRAY'SINN  Saturday Nov    In omnes superbiâ quae crudelitate gravior est bonis grassatus  FLORUS  _A WRITER of periodical Essays is like one who goes coasting from Place to Place with Intent to lay down a Chart of the Course of the Country the Extent of the several Parts the Bearings Limits and Connections As the latter fails along every minute Object furnishes him with Matter of Contemplation and not a Hill lifts its Head whether cloathed with Verdure and imbowered with overhanging Wood or wild barren and craggy but he instantly treasures it in the Storehouse of Imagination Each Recess of the Land each Creek Rock and Harbour demand a particular Notice and he is frequently induced to pause in these Reflections heedless of the unbounded Prospect which the Ocean presents him In like Manner the Person who is engaged in a Course of Lucubrations to be published on a stated Day is constantly traversing about in order to delineate a just Representation of the different Scenes of Life and to gratify his Readers with particular Charts which may either serve to please the Fancy or contribute to the Purposes of Improvement and Utility In his Intercourse with Men and Manners every Occurrence attracts his Eye and in his Converse with Books he often meets with Passages which deserve to be minutely set down in the Account of his Voyage through this Sea of Troubles and they may serve as Lights or Landmarks to those who are bound upon the same Adventure  It is thus the best Essays are suggested and I must own I never yet perused a good Author but I thence deduced some Hint which afterwards unfolded several latent Reflections that might otherwise escape me The Classics are particularly useful in this Way They display upon all Occasions such bright Traces of a manly Way of Thinking and abound with so many excellent and close Remarks artfully interwoven with the Thread of their Poem or Narration that a Man conversant with their Productions will be always able to draw very amply from their Stores  In perusing a few Nights since  Florus  's  Compendium  of the  Roman  History I was greatly struck with an Observation in the Character of  Tarquin  which that Writer though no extraordinary Master of the Graces and Elegancies of Composition has found Means to insert with his usual Closeness  Tarquin  says  Florus  insulted all Mankind with an overbearing Pride which to an ingenuous Mind is worse than Cruelty  This short Observation most certainly carries with it a great Deal of Truth and deserves to be enforced with all the Strength of Reason and Eloquence  A witty Satirist has called Pride the universal Passion and indeed its Influence on Mankind is so manifest that there is too much Reason to believe the Maxim well founded The general Prevalence of Politeness suppresses in some Measure the Appearance of it among the  French  but any one who has been at  Versailles  may remember that after all the Attention and Deference of the embroidered Gentleman who undertakes the Office of shewing the Curiosities of the Place the Ceremony is always concluded with a Consciousness of their national Superiority which breaks out in a brisk Question with a Shrug of the Shoulder  Eh bien Monsieur avez vous  e pareille magnificence à Londres  Well Sir have you any Thing equal to this in  London  In  Italy Portugal  and  Spain  their Haughtiness is manifested by the frequent Use of the Stilleto upon every trivial Occasion Pride is there displayed by killing others and the People of  England  discover it by murdering themselves  The Notion of Independance with which a freeborn  Briton  is inflamed renders him untractable and refractory to all Laws  Religion  he makes a Joke of and he wonders at the Impertinence of the Parliament in attempting to restrain his unquestionable Right to dispose of his Person as he pleases  The famous  Montesquieu  imputes the Variety of Oddities which prevail in this Country to the general Infection of the Scurvy but if he had charged it upon our national Sturdiness I am inclinable to think he would have assigned a truer Cause though perhaps at the same Time black and sizy Blood may not a little contribute to aggravate the Distemper To speak with Precision Pride is to the Soul what the Scurvy is to the Body each in their separate Channels the Source of ill Humours Maladies and Disorders The fatal Effects of the corporal Indisposition just mentioned have been so severely felt for a long Time past that our common NewsPapers are filled with Advertisements of Chymical Drops to eradicate it entirely out of the Blood This certainly would have been a great Benefit to Society but I apprehend he would deserve still more who should devise a Cure for the Disease of the Mind On this Account I should be glad to see a Paragraph in the Papers to the following Effect  To Persons of either Sex afflicted with any Species of  PRIDE  NEVER were  Pride Arrogance  and  Haughtiness  so frequent as of late Years nor has any Remedy been found adequate to this pernicious Habit which occasioned a Physician of the Soul who employed  his Thoughts much concerning them to adapt a Medicine or Moral Elixir which is a sovereign Remedy against PRIDE and all the Variety of Symptoms by which it mimics by Turns almost all the Vices poor Mortals are afflicted with and have their Rise from a depraved Selfishness of Thinking vicious Ferments of Illnature and the Want of Selfknowledge whence proceed the supercilious Brow and surly Moroseness in the Men and Coquetry Airs Fidgets Tehees and Titters in the Women which totally destroy their Beauty and their Features and by a Consent of Parts affect their Heads and produce direful Views and terrible Apprehensions at other Times Fits flushing Heats Lowness and Sinking of the Spirits Palpitation of the Heart Twitchings of the Limbs with many convulsive Disorders which affect Numbers of both Sexes  The above Elixir is a wonderful Alterative occasions laudable Humility and as soon as taken makes the Patient goodhumoured chearful and affable to Admiration and is good for all Sorts of People to preserve as well as procure an even Temper of Mind  Whenever I meet with a proud Man I should be glad to know what he takes himself for and I have often imagined that if his inward State of Mind were detected to the Eye of the World it would afford a ridiculous Contrast between his several Foibles and his fancied Elevation above the rest of his Species For my Part it never fails to divert me in a most exquisite Manner when I observe a Man sit like his Grandsire cut in Alabaster as  Shakespear  has it in order to receive the Compliments of every one without any real Merit to deserve them and without that reciprocal Complacence which is always sure to procure Esteem I would have such a one made Emperor of the Moon or removed to some other Sphere fitted for his Reception  where Cruelty may pass for Courage Ostentation for Merit and Pride for Dignity  Nothing can so surely demonstrate a narrow Mind as an Attempt to degrade our FellowCreatures by an haughty Arrogance of Carriage  Hamlet  reckons the  Insolence of Office  and the  proud Man  's  Contumely  among those Instigations which might prompt injured Merit to a Deed of extreme Despair and this further enforces the Severity which is felt by him who is obliged to submit to it and the Cruelty of that human Brute who can think of putting it in Practice  I cannot dismiss this Paper without observing that there is a right Species of Pride to which every Man is entitled and that is a Spirit above Dependance above Flattery above an abject Deportment and above every Thing poor sordid and little There is a Pride which may serve to invigorate Honour to embolden Truth and to carry Virtue to an higher Pitch of Improvement than it might attain unassisted by this secondary Motive The Pleasures resulting from this Principle are manly and noble To enjoy the inward Consciousness of Honor and Honesty and to exult in the Conviction of a Person's own Integrity Probity and upright Intentions is just and laudable Thus much of Pride every one has a Right to and I know

undoubtedly receive great Instruction  NUMB  GRAY'sINN  Saturday Dec    Respicere Exemplar vitae morumque jubebo  Do  um Imitat  rem et veras hinc ducere Voces  HOR  _IN a former Essay I threw together a few Thoughts upon the  Profession  of an ACTOR as a Sequel to that Piece I shall this Day offer some loose Hints upon the  Art  and though this Subject may not be interesting to every Reader I yet persuade myself as the Drama is the most polite and rational of our Diversions that an Attempt to throw some Light upon the Matter will be received with Candour  The Precept which the judicious Author of my Motto has laid down for the good Writer is likewise the best Rule for an Actor for as both are Professors  of imitative Arts the same Rule is applicable to each "I would recommend" says  Horace  to the skilful Imitator a close and steady Observance of Men and Manners and from that Source I would have him draw an exact Resemblance and the true Language of Nature  This Advice short and simple as it is contains the whole Secret of succeeding with the Public and whoever artfully conforms to it will be sure of acquiring Applause from crowded Theatres The Actor in every Situation on the Stage is a Copyist from human Life the easy and genteel Deportment of Gentlemen is to be attained by an Intercourse and free Communication with People of that Class the DrawingRoom must be visited for a Knowledge of the Ease and Dignity of Men of Rank and by this Habitude the Performer will fashion himself into a Kind of mental Elegance which will not sail to inform his whole Person and set off every Action with a graceful Facility at the same Time that it will enable him to be upon all Occasions a more perfect Imitator  To these external Circumstances must be joined a close and intimate Knowledge of the human Heart its most secret Movements must be unfolded and the Actor must be thoroughly acquainted with their minutest Effects upon the human Body in what Proportion they agitate the Nerves and Muscles how they impress the Features with their respective Signatures elevate or contract the Brow brace or relax the Sinews and command the Attitude and Disposition of the whole Person There is not a Passion in the whole Train of those Feelings to which our Nature is subject but what has its own peculiar Adjuncts its own Air its own Look and its own proper Tone Sorrow unnerves the whole System sinks the Spirits and depresses the Voice into a plaintive Melancholy Anger on the other Hand contracts each Sinew sends the Spirits in a Blaze to the Eye and vents itself in precipitate and vehement Accents  In like Manner every Emotion of the Soul has a sympathetic Influence on the Structure of the Body and it is the immediate Business of the Performer who would aspire to Excellence in the Art to form to himself an exact Definition of each Passion with all its Characteristics otherwise it will be impossible for him to mark the Progress and Workings of the Mind awakened and excited by the Vehemence of their Impulse or to separate the tender Desire of a  Romeo  from the conjugal Affection of  Jaffier  After having thus distinguished the Nature and Boundaries of each Affection the next Step to be taken is to watch the various Shiftings and Veerings of the Soul and to observe how the several Passions rise and fall in quick Vicissitude The Mind of Man cannot dwell for any considerable Time upon one Object from whence it results that Love and Resentment Grief and Joy Despair and Hope Rage and Tenderness are perpetually taking their Turns in the Breast To perceive minutely the very Point where the first ceases and the succeeding one begins to rise requires a nice Discernment as in the well wrought Piece of some eminent Hand the Colours run so artfully into one another that their gradual Evanescence from the Sight and their growing by insensible Degrees into a full Glow is only to be discovered by the curious Eye If I do not mistake the Touch which so skilfully blends different Colours in this delicate Confederacy is called by the Painters the  Demitint  should not something like this be preserved in the Performances of a good Actor in order to render each Transition graceful and natural to melt the Audience by regular Essays into Tenderness or induce any other Impression with Justness and Propriety Whatever Passion has at any Time taken Possession of the Heart must abate by Degrees and the Traces of it must be almost effaced before a contrary Affection can gain Admittance and whoever is careful  to mark with Feeling the Ebbing out of the one and Flowing in of the other will be always sure to have an irresistible Command over his Audience  But the Matter does not rest here the Performer who is ambitious of distinguishing himself for masterly Touches in Scenes of Vehemence will find another latent Secret in the intellectual System which must never escape his Notice It must be remembered that there are frequent Occasions in which the Breast is distracted by two different Passions at once both working the Heartstrings in one mixed Emotion These complicated Agitations of the Mind are often imperceptible to all but the skilful Observer and therefore as the Actor's chief Difficulty lies in this Point a feeling Expression of it will always be a Proof of his Excellence and Strokes of this Nature well executed will impress on every Breast the liveliest Sensations  It often happens in mere descriptive Poetry that the Writer observing some surprizing Agreement between Things which in their Natures seem totally inconsistent with each other from thence takes occasion to reconcile Contrarieties in such an agreeable Assemblage that the tasteful Reader is entertained with a Picture which at once amuses his Fancy and satisfies his Judgment  Virgil  has many delicate Touches of this Nature and  Horace  who had Art enough for every poetic Embellishment has heightened his Odes with several Beauties of this Sort In this Class of Elegancies may be reckoned the following Passages  Urit grata Pro  ervitas  Pignusque direptum lacertis  Aut Digito malè pertinaci  Tityosque vultu  Risit invito  Milton  also who has every softer Delicacy in minute Descriptions as well as every lofty Image in the sublime  has inserted many beautiful Colourings of this Species in his  Paradise Lost  and his  grinned horrible a ghastly Smile  is an admirable Instance Mr  Addison  has given to Thoughts of this Nature the Title of  thwarting Ideas  and he adds that they are some of the finest Strokes in the whole Compass of Poetry If I might be allowed to carry this Hint further I should call all Strokes of this Kind where the Mind is worked into a Ferment by the Name of  thwarting Passions  and I will venture to say that they will be universally acknowledged much more beautiful than that mere Clash of Ideas which the eminent Critic just mentioned has so much insided upon because they not only surprize with a seeming Contrast but also interest the Heart which is the Perfection of Poetry The  Greek  and  Latin  Poets and indeed the fine Writers among the Moderns are full of these pathetic Representations of human Nature but among them all I do not remember a finer Instance than a Passage in Mr  Whitehead  's  Roman Father  when that Hero is reflecting on the Combat which is to decide the Fate of  Rome  Had I a thousand Sons in such a Cause  I could behold 'em bleeding at my Feet  And thank the Gods with Tears  To express these complicated Sensations where several Passions at once agitate the Soul requires such a Command of Countenance and Voice that it is certainly the greatest Perfection of an Actor and with a Kind of magic Power it always leads us into the most pleasing Distress  If the Bounds of my Paper would admit it I should here indulge myself in examining our present Performers with Regard to the three Divisions of the Passions above established To one I should perhaps ascribe the Merit of expressing with proper Enforcement  the Sentiments of haughty Anger and tyrannic Cruelty in another I should chiefly admire the graceful Transition from Rage to Tenderness and probably I should not hesitate to say of a third that he is excellent in all Vicissitudes of the Mind and that in mixed Sensations he penetrates to the very Soul of his Hearers and were I to add that in many Situations I have experienced the same from Mrs  Cibber  it would be but barely doing her that Justice which her excellent Art deserves  From what has been premised it will appear that to express the Emotions of the human Heart is the chief Business of an Actor and no Account is ever to be made of Figure Voice or any other external Circumstances unless it be when they combine with the Performer's Feelings to make deeper Impressions on an Audience I have known an Actor lengthen out the Tone of his Voice and if it sounded clearly imagine his Business finely executed when Nature and the Passions required that he should speak in another Key and in broken short and vehement Accents  Quinctilian  has a just Remark on this Head "as Poets" says he  profess to sing their Works Verse should be repeated in a Manner somewhat elevated above common Discourse with a Sweetness properly tempered by Discretion and not thrilling into a wanton Luxuriance of Sound as if the Throat had been gargled for the Purpose  I shall only add a lively Imagination is the Talent which an Actor should principally cultivate as it is that which excites those pathetic Feelings without which no Man will ever succeed on the Stage and with which it is hardly possible totally to fail  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Rainbow Coffeehouse  Dec    THE Board of  Priggism  met

imaginary Good and the next hating ourselves for all that Perplexity of Thought which our whimsical Desires occasioned in our Breasts How often are the soberest Understandings disturb'd by Agitations of Spirit about Things in themselves of no Kind of Moment or Importance and when once the Tumult has subsided how contemptible do we appear to ourselves for having been so weak as to yield to the Impression Every Period of Life is marked with this Inconstancy the Child has Perplexities which the Boy laughs at and ripened by a further Accession of Years into Manhood our previous Occupations become ridiculous 'till at length old Age thinks the whole a  Series of Follies insensible to its own Infirmities and little aware that the Passions operate at that Juncture with less Celerity not because Reason is grown strong but on Account of the enfeebled Tone of all the mental Powers like a Weather Cock which being grown rusty is not moved with every Breath of Wind but slowly veers from Point to Point I am inclined to think that the human Soul will be always in this Progression constantly making each Moment a Critic on the last and and that as soon as the Spirit shall be unbodied it will instantly smile at our wisest Employments in this World our deepest Reflections and our most serious Speculations I was engaged in this Train of Thought the other Night and having an Imagination which does not very soon detach itself from the Objects that have once possessed it the same Scenes of Reflection disclosed themselves to me in Sleep and formed a Prospect not unentertaining to my Fancy  I thought the Hemisphere on a sudden brightened with more than common Lustre a Flood of Glory diffusing itself through all Creation and from an Opening of the Heavens appeared high exalted on a Throne THE GENIUS OF HUMAN KIND After a Trumpet had sounded three Times the following Sounds were awfully pronounced  Let all those fleeting Spirits which formerly animated corporal Tenements forthwith appear from their several Mansions of Retribution and let those who now support a feverish Existence upon Earth instantly repair hither divested of their bodily Incumbrance and account before our dread Presence for the Use they have made of their Time during their State of Probation  The Edict was immediately obeyed and I fancied that I had no sooner emerged from my Tenement of Clay than every Thing wore another Appearance and new Faculties of Perception were assigned me Vanished were the original Colours concerning which  so many Volumes have been written Wit Taste Learning Philosophy Mathematics and even Money itself appeared an absolute Chimaera and several Personages beginning to address the Throne I was further confirm'd in my Opinion that all was Idleness Vanity and unavailing Vexation  Homer  declared his whole Poem to be the Rhapsody of an everweening Imagination He owned his celestial Councils and his Battle of the Gods to be a Jumble of Absurdities his boldest Flights of Fancy appeared quite contemptible and he wondered how he could ever employ his Faculties in stringing together such wild enthusiastic Reveries  Plato  owned that he knew nothing of the first  Good  first  Perfect  and first  Fair  and Lord  Shaftsbury  wished that instead of being guided by that Pagan Philosopher he had made use of the Light of Revelation which might have afforded him some faint dawning Ideas of that Truth of which he is now perfectly convinced He added that he did not know what he was about when he wrote his Rhapsody and many other Parts of his Performance and that he now looked back at them with Contempt  Aristotle  declared his System of Logic to be nothing but an idle Scheme of laboured Perplexities calculated to puzzle and bewilder Mankind  Pindar  smil'd at his Olympics and did not hesitate to say that he really believed he was mad when he wrote them and old  Euclid  who I believe never once laughed on Earth burst into a loud Expression of Mirth when he reflected upon his Endeavours to square the Circle and his several Triangles and Quadrangles which he owned do not contribute in any Degree to the Advancement of Virtue  Alexander  frankly confessed himself a Child for weeping  more Worlds  Caesar  declared he would as contentedly be the last in a Village as the first in  Rome  and  Pompey  had no longer an Aversion to an Equal  Cicero  without elaborating a Period of a Mile condemned his Pursuit of Fame as no more than the chasing an empty Bubble and he added that he never thought himself properly employed but when expatiating against the minute Philosophers  Virgil  still persisted that his whole  Aeneid  should be burned  Horace  and  Ovid  both laughed at the Duration of their Works which in their Days of Nature they flattered themselves would be indelible Monuments of their Fame  In short among all the celebrated Personages of Antiquity every one accused himself of Misapplication and even  Titus  complained that he had lost many Days  There were those who acknowledged that they never knew Uneasiness in Life but what was occasioned by the Success of others and that they were always completely happy or completely miserable by Comparison  Poets  laugh'd at all their Pains to tag a Rhyme and their Solicitude for Works which now appeared to them in a proper Light and  Criticks  acknowledged that they took too much unnecessary Trouble to destroy Productions of so perishable a Nature The Miser railed at  insolvent Gold  as it is finely called by the witty Doctor  Young  and his Heart expanded with Generosity and social Affection  The softer Sex presented themselves among the Rest on this Occasion but the Simper of SelfAdmiration no longer displayed itself They were not anxious aabout the Gloss of their Skin the Arrangement of a Curl or the Disposition of a Patch The snowy Breast ceased to heave with studied Carelessness and the Shape was not tortured a thousand Ways in order to look attractive in the Eye of Man The Labours of the Toilet were now despised and each Fairone wondered how Dress could make so great a Part of the Business of Life and how they could ever take so much Pride in perishable Clay however neatly moulded and however tinctured with a pleasing Hue They were now perswaded  that true Beauty dwells in the Mind Drums Routs and Cards were held in Contempt and as Mr  Pope  has it They viewed with Scorn two Pages and a Chair They were all ashamed of the Falsehoold of their Friendships their Tehees and Titters at a ruined Character their several Turns of Coquetry Dissimulation and all the Variety of female Artifice In short Mankind in general owned themselves distracted with Cares beneath a rational Creature and Envy Pride Selfishness Perfidy and Ambition swell'd the vast Account  From these Disturbers of our Happiness I was rejoyced to see my Fellow Creatures relieved and to perceive Love Joy and Benevolence effacing gradually all Traces of former Guilt gave me an inexpressible Delight But I soon found I was not in Reality launched into Eternity and therefore my Joy like all Things subject to Time and mortal Chance soon came to an End The Fumes of Sleep were dissipated and I awaked from my Dream Loose as it is the Reader may derive this Moral from it that there is nothing in human Life worth the Anxiety it creates and that it should be our Business at present to fix those Propensities and Habits in our Souls which we shall not have Occasion hereafter to wish totally effaced and which it is probable we shall be carrying to

Time the Tragedy of  Boadicia  with all the Advantages of Exhibition which new Scenery new Dresses and the excellent Performance of Mr  Garrick  Mrs  Cibber  and Mrs  Pritchard  could give it  It was certainly a bold Enterprize in Mr  Glover  after  Shakespear  has given us such a Taste for wild and savage Liberty to attempt a Piece conformable to the Rules and Simplicity of the  Stagyrite  and hence it arose that some Scenes were not found busy enough However the Fire of the Author glows intensely through the whole and all his Descriptions of the distant Battle and his Allusions to the hallowed Groves of the Druids are finely interwoven As this Composition is remarkable for an elegant Purity of Diction which instead of overcharging Nature sets her off in all the Graces and Embellishments of Poetry I am persuaded it will prove a good closet Companion and I shall only add that if  Voltaire  were to criticise this Production he would in Justice wave his favourite Phrases  barbarous monstrous Farces c  and would allow this Piece to be the Work of a very elegant finished Taste  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday Dec    Pictis bellantur Amazones armis  VIRG  _I PAID a Visit a few Days since to a Lady for whom I always entertained a very high Esteem on Account of a pleasing Turn of Conversation and many other good and agreeable Qualities which she is possessed of  Mrs  Millefont  for that is her Name was never known to have the least Propensity to Scandal or Detraction She does not concern herself with the impertinent Knowledge of who and who were together at the Masquerade who were seen to interchange a few fond Regards at the Theatre or who has lately had an  Ill run at Play Politeness Goodnature and Affability are her characteristic Perfections and she is ready to allow Wit and Beauty in others as well as in her own Daughters though in my Opinion it is a rare Thing to see them equalled by any of their Sex Both the young Ladies are tall and graceful elegant in Shape and delicate in their Features extremely like each other in the Turn of the Face and still each of them forming if I may be allowed to use the Phrase a different School of Beauty  Harriet  being two Years elder is rather more formed and higher in Bloom than her Sister but seems to be sensible of the approaching Eclipse which her Beauty must suffer very shortly when all the Charms which are at present budding forth in the Person of  Charlot  have attained their full Perfection Tho'  Harriet  is sensible of this she yet perceives it without any Proneness to Envy On the contrary she rallies herself with great Vivacity and will fairly own that she is upon the Lookout for a Man for herself before  Charlot  becomes so mischievous a Beauty as to engross the Attention of every Beholder and then says she  I shall lose all my Admirers and so I'm resolved to get married out of the Way  On this Account she at present throws the Dart like a Tyrant as the Poet phrases it though I am convinced when she resigns her Person her good Sense will then lead her to imitate the Gentleness and amiable Disposition of  Charlot  who does not aim at being so fierce a Beauty as  Harriet  but is chiefly desirous to be Mistress of willing Hearts She does not endeavour to kindle her Eyes into that Glare of Fire for which many others are remarkable but unambitiously she lets them shine in their own native Mildness and if the captivates every Heart it is without any premeditated Design In short the Difference between these two young Ladies is this  Charlot  's Charms have a constant Emanation and  Harriet  's Beauties are in a perpetual Exertion  I spent an Hour in the most agreeable Manner with this Family when  Harriet  in her giddy Manner gave a new Turn to the Conversation by asking me  Pray Mr  Ranger  can you tell me something about  Macklin  's new Scheme pray what is the Man about  To this I replied that I really was not sufficiently in the Secret that he has built two magnificent Rooms and intends to furnish them in an elegant Manner the Apartment on the GroundFloor to be a public CoffeeRoom and the other for the Reception of Gentlemen of Rank and Education but that however I was afraid he would share the common Fate of Projectors  Well I vow and protest says  Harriet  it's a vexatious Thing to see how these Men are always contriving Places for their own Accommodation without Troubling their Heads about the Women The odious Things are always herding with one another and the Ladies are sequestred from all the Joys of these convenient Meetings Does not one hear them eternally saying with an Air of Indifference Ma'am I must go the Coffee house and so saunter away with that janty careless Air that never fails to provoke me Well I wish the

agreeable Manner and insisted with all the Rhetoric of a Romp that I should propose her Scheme to the Public which I assured her I should take the first Opportunity to perform  I have ever been of Opinion that in the general Coffeehouses are not of such Advantage as is generally imagined most of these Places being frequented entirely by Bucks Bloods and Rakes of all Denominations from whom there is nothing to be acquired except a Swagger in the Gait a drunken Totter a noisy riotous Deportment a Volley of Oaths and a total Want of what is called Good Breeding Perhaps this Opportunity of detaching themselves from the Ladies in Coffeehouse Clubs is the Cause of that Aukwardness which is frequently remarkable in Persons who from their Fortunes and Situation in Life should be better accomplished and on this Account I am apprehensive that a Rendezvous of this Nature might have some ill Effect upon the Deportment of the Fair but should this Scheme be carried into Execution I must acknowledge that it will in many Respects set the Ladies upon a  Par  with the Men and the Convenience of meeting People of Fashion without the necessary Parade of going to their Houses will certainly

Correspondent abroad we are informed that when Monsieur  Voltaire  was arrested by order of the King of  Prussia  there were found among his Papers several Translations of different Passages in  Shakespear  done so extremely ill that it is conjectured he purposely made use of a frigid Languor of Expression in order to lessen the Poet's Reputation abroad in hopes that then himself might be set down as the greatest dramatic Poet in the World But to quiet this restless Ambition we must inform him that  Apollo  has long since issued out his Prohibition so that he may swell like the Frog in the Fable without ever coming near him  Non si te ruperis inquit par eris  The same Advices mention that there were also several abusive Paragraphs on the same immortal Bard very improper from the Pen of a Scholar and a Gentleman The following Libel was particularly remarkable  L'Action  Vide  the Letter prefixed to his Orphan of  China  de la piece Chinoise dure vingtcinq ans comme dans les farces monstreuses de Shakespear Lopez de Vega qu'on a nomme tragedies  The Action of the  Chinese  Play includes five and twenty Years as in the monstrous Farces of  Shakespear  and  Lopez de Vega  which have obtained the Name of Tragedies  Is it not invidious in Monsieur  Voltaire  to mention  Lopez de Vega  in Conjunction with a Poet whom in his Soul he cannot but reverence as a Genius superior to all the dramatic  Writers in the World and of whom he has frequently availed himself As Mr  Voltaire  is so rigid a Critic we shall one Day hold an Enquiry into his poetical Merit and therefore we think proper to publish the following  ADVERTISEMENT  Preparing for the Press a critical Enquiry into the poetical Merit of the celebrated  Voltaire  in which the Beauties and Defects of his Fables will be considered and the great Superiority which  Shakespear  boasts over him and all other Poets whatever in point of Sentiment Passion Character and Diction will be set forth in the clearest Light to conclude with an Account Current between  Voltaire  and the  English  Nation in which will appear on one Side the Abuse he has occasionally thrown out against our Poets and on the other Side the clandestine Use he has made of them in almost all his Plays  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday Dec    Haud facilè cinergunt quorum virtutibus obstat  Res angusta domi  JUV  Maxima debetur puero Reverentia

first Three Thousand Pounds than all the Rest of his immoderate Wealth This Apothegm may be said to comprize the whole Arcanum of rising in the World but as not one of the  Adepts in the Science has thought proper to discover the secret Art of putting this Rule in Practice it is to be apprehended the Indigent will find as many Difficulties as ever to retard their Progress and hinder them from emerging out of their Embarrassments The Author of my Motto has observed many Ages since that the most exalted Virtues and the rarest Accomplishments do not find it easy to extricate themselves out of Difficulties and the Course of human Contingencies has proved the Maxim true to this Day  There is perhaps hardly any Man but can point out in the Circle of his Acquaintance certain Personages of very extensive Capacities strong and quick Parts and a delicate Sense of Honour who are not however able to raise themselves to any conspicuous Point of Eminence merely because their Talents have not been called forth by Opportunity or animated by Success Genius wherever it subsists must be warmed and cherished otherwise it is apt to languish and decay the fine Sensations which are attendant on an enlightened Understanding occasion a certain Delicacy in the Possessor's Way of thinking which renders him liable to a Dejection of Spirits upon many Occasions in Life Refined Parts should be tenderly preserved or they are liable to be chilled by the Blasts of Adversity like those Fruits which would wither unripened in our cold northern Clime were they not carefully assisted in their Vegetation by the adventitious Use of hot Beds  The Circumstance which in my Opinion reflects the greatest Lustre upon the Character of Lord  Sommers  is the Encouragement he afforded to such a Genius as Mr  Addison  who might have remained in a less conspicuous Point of View without the Assistance of such a Patron His Vein of Humour which is now the genteelest in the World might have taken a Tincture from low Life his delicate Raillery might have subsided into coarse and vulgar Railing His Taste which  was finished by Travel and every other Advantage might have grown quite callous and indelicate for his Sentiments of Morality might have been substituted a Strain of Ribaldry to awaken the Blum of Confusion in that female Face which as Matters happened he took so much Pains to set off in the Smiles of native Innocence and unaffected Beauty and that Pen which entertained the Town with some of the most elegant Productions of human Wit might have been employed in Politics personal Invective and Partyrage But the kindly Protection of the Lord  Sommers  hindered him from sinking into Obscurity and from being compelled by Necessity to sully that fair Fame which is now the Reward of his excellent Performances The Assistance of so eminent a Person was a Kind of Demand upon him for all that elaborate Elegance which now distinguishes itself in his Writings  He from the Taste obscene refines our Youth  And sets the Passions on the Side of Truth  POPE  It has been the Fate of many endowed perhaps with Parts not very inferior to  Addison  to droop in Indigence their poetic Fires totally extinguished and I make no Manner of Doubt but in the present Age there are those who might become shining Ornaments of the Republic of Letters were there any Incitement to spur the Muses Steed But a Treatise on  Cribbidge  or a Calculation of the Chances at Whist is sure of being better received at present than the Odes of a  Collins  or any Performance of distinguished Genius While a  Smart  subsists among us I cannot help thinking it an indelible Reproach to the Age that he has not any where sound a  Mecaenas  and that he is suffered to draw his Pen in the Praises of his Maker without receiving any other Reward than a small Premium at  Cambridge  and that Portion of Fame which in Spight of Malice and Envy he will be always sure to enjoy  Wit is generally considered as an Object of Ridicule rather than an Accomplishment deserving Encouragement and Esteem and the Narrowness of Fortune in which most of the literary Tribe are situated is a standing Topic of Pleasantry and to call a Man a Poet is in most Companies a stroke of irresistible Humour The witty Doctor  Young  has ridiculed this with his usual Delicacy  These when their utmost Venom they would spit  Most barbarously tell you  "he's a Wit"  Poor Negrces thus to shew their burning Spite  To Cacodaemons say they're  Dev'lish White  There is hardly any Thing more affecting to a Man of real Merit than to find himself scorned by the Insolence of Pursepride People of Affluence should consider when they attempt to depreciate Men of superior Parts that they betray an unmanly Triumph over those who have still their Fortune to make But as Mr  Pope  finely observes the World in general is apt to form an Idea of a Man at the Time he is least able to make a proper Judgment for himself and from thence it results that we find many utterly ruined by slight Errors trivial Indiscretions and petty Inadvertencies while others owe their Elevation to Vices to headstrong Passions and a Series of selfish Views which are for the greater Part more successful than Modesty a sober Understanding and a Spirit above abject Flattery and mean Submission  They who sit smiling at the Goal of Fortune while others are running the hardy Course should reflect that it is possible for Perseverance and unremitted Application to reach the very Point in which they take so much Pride and then it is evident on which Side the Superiority will be found A well turned Spirit with the Advantages of a genteel Education and a competent Knowledge of the World must certainly receive  additional Lustre from an Accession of Wealth and the Accomplishments of such a one will in their Turn adorn and embellish Affluence On this Account  Juvenal  's Maxim is without Dispute highly just a great Respect says he is due to Youth The Practice of this Observation I would recommend to all Parents Uncles Guardians and all Ranks of People who have any Concern in the Education of the rising Generation as it is to be apprehended

arises from an internal View of his own mental Constitution To observe the various Association of Ideas combined with a Rapidity which scarcely leaves a Trace behind it to watch the subtile Movements of the Passions and thence to deduce the secret Source of many of our Sensations which are in Appearance extremely complicated and surprizing is a Task requiring the finest Perception in the Research and also productive of the most useful Knowledge we can boast and the highest Delight our Faculties are susceptible of  The Solution of a mathematical Problem may be agreeable to that Curiosity which is implanted in us  and the  Newtonian Philosophy  may expand the Imagination with stupendous Ideas of the Distances of heavenly Bodies but in these Occupations like  Swift  's Taylor it is possible we may mistake one Figure and then all our ingenious Labour evaporates into Air whereas in the Pursuit of Selfknowledge our Reasonings are from Feeling and all our Discoveries besides the Advantage of being as surprizing as in any other Science carry with them a further Accession of Pleasure as we are ourselves more immediately concerned in them In travelling through an open champain Country the Prospect on every Side may administer to the Pleasures of Imagination but a Man will certainly feel more lively Sensat ons when riding upon Land belonging to himself the Landskip of his own Estate will look more beautiful to the Eye the Lawn shall spread a more pleasing Verdure and the Discovery of a Mine or the secret Spring of a little Rill running through his Meadows aford him a Delight not to be equalled by the gayest Scenes that can be presented to him  The Study of the human Mind is therefore the most rational and pleasing Employment we are capable of for my Part I am always highly delighted when any accidental Circumstance throws me into this Tract of thinking and whether reading  Rabelais  's frolic Ravings or the sublime Enthusiasm of  Homer  I am sure ever and anon to lay aside the Volume in order to trace the Pleasure which I have received to its hidden Source and to account for the Appearance upon some Principle in our Constitution An Opportunity of gratifying this Turn occurred to me the other Day when casually turning over some of the most beautiful Passages in epic Poetry I could not help taking notice that I perused the Description of Thousands stretched upon the Field of Battle weltring in Blood agonizing with their Wounds and trampled under Horses Hoofs without feeling any of those Propensities to Compassion  which were frequently awakened in me by the Death of a single Person I could read with the greatest Composure and Serenity Lines which mention dying Groans of Numbers falling in one promiscuous Carnage broken Limbs of Warriors Men and Horses all mixed in one general Scene of Destruction  Tum vero gemitus morientum sanguine in alto  Armaque Corporaque permisti caede Virorum  Semianimes volvuntur Equi  A MusterRoll of Heroes who in one Line embraced their Fate did not move me to the least ténder Sensation  Chloreaque Sybarimque Daretaque Thersilocumque  Alcandrumque Haliumque Noëmonaque Prytanimque  The Mind is totally impassive in all these general Accounts of the Calamities of War but when the Poet thinks proper to distinguish a single Person from the Throng we melt in Pity of his Fate heedless of the general Devastation which is spread around him That this is the Case every Body that has read the  Aeneid  will be ready to acknowledge and yet it might be imagined that our Hearts should be more intensely agitated when Desolation sweeps whole Ranks of our FellowCreatures from the Face of the Earth than when we read the Fate of an Individual but such is our Disposition that we can go through all these Narratives without Emotion and when the epic Writer throws out but a short Reflection upon the Fall of one Man we are instantly fixed in Attention and our Hearts throb with Compassion for his untimely End  The Reason of this I take to be that in the former Case we are only told that so many embraced their Fate in Battle in which Circumstance there is nothing to excite Commiseration in a reasonable Being Death is one of the Conditions of human Life and we all  hold our Existence in this World upon the same precarious Tenure We therefore consider the Descriptions of  Homer  and  Virgil  as no more than a mere Bill of Mortality and when they inform us that such a Number perished upon the Spot we peruse it with as much Calmness as the Paragraph which tells us  Encreased in the Burials this Week five hundred  And further when they tell us that one receives an Arrow in the jugular Vein another has a Spear run through his Shoulder and is rivetted with his Body double to the Ground a third is wounded in the Mouth and has his Head split in two it may serve as the Critics observe to give Variety to the Battle but in Fact amounts to no more than what we read in a common News paper  Yesterday a Labourer fell from the Top of an House by which Accident he broke his Collar bone and instantly expired  An Account of bodily Pain has but a very slight Influence upon our Passions it is mental Distress that principally operates upon our Hearts and our Pity rises in Proportion to the Agitations of Mind which we perceive in the Person afflicted Besides this the Poet frequently finds collateral Avenues to our Souls by a Mention of FamilyConnections and to heighten our Sorrow he addresses himself to the moral Sense of his Reader and interests him still more in the Fate of his Hero by representing his amiable Qualities and the elegant Accomplishments which would have rendered him a deserving Member of Society By these Mears our tenderest Feelings are awakened and the Effect is not unlike what a Man may experience in a Churchyard where he sees a Multitude of different Graves in which the good the bad the old and young lie in promiscuous Silence and he therefore beholds the Scene without Emotion but as soon as the Tomb stone presents a Character of one distinguished from the Rest he then laments the generous Friend the tender Husband the indulgent  Father and mourns for him who acted agreeably to the Relations in which he stood to his Fellow Creatures Thus when we read of a dying Person that he was a Friend of the Muses and that Harmony was the Delight of his Soul we consider him in a different Light from those who as Mr  Addison  expresses it are celebrated for nothing but being knocked in the Head  Amicum Cretea Musis  Cretea Musarum Comitem cui Carmina semper  Et Citharae Cordi numerosque intendere Nervis  When we are told of another that his Death was lamented by his Friends in sundry Parts of his Country we cannot help joining in the general Grief  Te Nemus Agnitiae vitreâ te Fucinus undâ  Te liquidi flevere Lacus  The Number of Sufferers is encreased and our Passions encrease in Proportion to the Knowledge conveyed to us of their Affections their tender Friendships and their Schemes for future Happiness One falls in the Midst of his halffinished Projects him his blooming Mistress mourns with frantic Sorrow and all his Relations bewail his Loss Another receives his mortal Wound through the very Garment which his Mother worked for him with her own Hands  Trarsiit Parmam Mucro levia Arma minacis  Et Tunicam molli mater quam neveral Auro  Implevitque sinum sanguis  Besides these little Touches which the epic Writer occasionally makes use of to awaken and engage the Passions they are further obliged to diversify their Battles with Episodes or short Accounts of particular Adventures in order to secure our Attention and relieve us from that general Scene of Slaughter which they are conscious we peruse without any of those Sensations which it is the primary Excellence of Poetry to excite  Thus the Story of  Nisus  and  Euryalus  will always soften the  eader into Compassion when other Passages in one Line of which there is infinitely more Mischief done will be passed over with Indifference I should not think the worse of him that should calmly go thro' most of the Battles in epic Poetry but I hope there is not one of my Readers who would not yield to the tenderest Impressions at the Fall of  Pallas  and the Lamentation of  Aeneas  over his dead Body  The Use I would make of what has been premised is that as our Passion are worked up in Proportion to the many amiable Qualities of the Character in Distress and the Keeness of mental Sensation which we suppose it suffers our modern Writers of Tragedy should attach themselves to this Circumstance and consider that it is not the theatrical Apparatus the Bowl the Dagger the Dungeon or the Clink of Chains that can affect an Audience but a faithful Portrait of a Mind struggling with various Sensations If the Players would also consider the same Noise and Rant would be effectually banished and instead of aiming at Applause by the mere Effect of own sonorous Voices they would endeavour by every Look every Tone and every Attitude to mark the infelt Anguish of their Minds  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  Dec    THE following is a Copy of Mr

infamia terret  Quem nisi mendesum mendacem  HOR  _MY Readers will observe that I frequently select Mottos for my Papers from the Author whose Name I have prefixed to this Day's Essay the Reason of it is his Sense is so refined and the Turn of his Expression so peculiarly delicate that his Remarks are intermixed with my own ordinary Ideas in such a Manner that they recur to me upon almost every Occasion  Horace  is so sensibly and elegantly sententious not only in his Epistles and Satires which are professedly moral Discourses but also in his lighter Odes and his gayest Excursions of Fancy that I have often thought an excellent System of Morality might be extracted out of his Writings I have even carried this Hint so far as to think seriously of publishing a Translation of all his excellent ethic Observations which would in my Opinion be the best Collection of Thoughts on various Subjects that has ever been offered to the Public  The Passage which I have placed at the Head of this Paper contains a very beautiful Moral  Who is there  says the Bard  that can desire an Accession of false Honour who is not sensible of some inherent Defect and who can be alarmed at the Blasts of Calumny and Detraction who bears in his own Heart a Regard to Truth  This Sentence contains  such indelible Marks of a virtuous Disposition that it should be written in Letters of Gold and impressed in deep Characters on the Heart of every Man who would pass through Life with an honest and fair Fame as it suggests a just Contempt for all illgrounded Applause and furnishes the Man of upright Heart with the proper Weapons of a noble Disregard for the mean Designs of Slander and Malevolence  Hypocrisy is considered by all Moralists as the most despicable and infamous Disease of the Soul it discovers a Sense of the Grace and Beauty of a fair Character but generally carries with it a total Absence of all good Qualities It aims at Esteem by artfully concealing the latent Imperfections and exhibiting to the public Eye a glossy Appearance of something amiable and honest But unless the Mind is thoroughly weeded in spight of every artful Disguise the lurking Mischief will one Time or other break out and as  Perseus  expresses it like a wild  Figtree  force its Way through the very Liver  Quae semel intus  Ianata est rupto jecore exierit  Caprificus  Since I have mentioned this Satirist it coincides with my present Scope to observe that there is not in any Author ancient or modern a nobler Description of a Man of real Honour than what is found in two Lines of his Writing I shall transcribe his Words because the Passage is highly beautiful and for the Sake of the mere  English  Reader I shall add Mr  Dryden  's excellent Translation  Compositum jus fasque Animi sanctosque Recessus  Mentis incocium generoso Poetus honesto  A Soul where Laws both human and divine  In Practice more than Speculation shine  A genuine Honour of a vigorous Kind  Pure in the last Recesses of the Mind  Certain it is that for the Formation of a just Character it is requisite to have a perfect Knowledge of Right and Wrong settled in the Mind Virtue should be ledged in the Soul and the Heart should glow with generous Truth but as the World now goes there is more Art to acquire the popular Opinion than Merit to deserve it and the general Method by which People grasp at Fame consists in depreciating some Neighbour's Character Thus the female Beauty aims at being a general Toast by detracting from some other Fairone The Merchant endeavours to extend his own Credit and Correspondence by an artful Propagation of Suspicions to another's Disadvantage and the Quack after setting forth the unerring Efficacy of his Nostrum closes his Advertisement with  Beware of Counterfeits for such are abroad  Cicero  observes that for one Man to detract from another and to think of aggrandizing himself at the Expence of his Neighbour is more against Nature than Death than Grief or any other Calamity incident to human Life The Realms of Fame are not to be explored by  Doublings  and  Shiftings  and whenever any one would arrive at those Regions Honour Truth and Generosity must freight the Vessel the Breath of voluntary impartial Applause must swell the Sail and the Course must be direct bold and open to the Eye of the World  A Reputation otherwise obtained must certainly afford very little Satisfaction and it will still administer less when we consider that it is only as  Shakespear  calls it  HONOUR gained from the ignorant from the self  rested the mean and the contemptible  word sua munera c  rd    says a Writer already quoted let the Underlings of Mankind keep their Commendations to themselves for the Praise of such is beneath the Ambition of an honest Man and by Parity of Reason their Censure their Disapprobation  their Cabals their Intrigues their Tattles their daily Compotations and their Midnight Clubs are to be despised by every one whose Breast is impregnated with a Love of Truth and Virtue  To draw to a Conclusion the uncertain Tide of illusive Popularity is ever known to fluctuate to ebb and to subside and then the  Shallows

informed us that he had lately seen the Character of King  Lear  admirably performed by Mr  Garrick  and that he had since thrown together some Remarks upon that excellent Tragedy which he desired I would this Day communicate to the Readers of the  Gray  's  InnJournal  To be able to criticise a Poet with any Degree of Perspicuity it is requisite to consider the Nature of his Fable and the moral Use of the Work This being sketched we may then proceed to observe how he lays on his Colouring the Disposition of each Personage the Expression of the Passions and which is the capital Figure in the Piece  Lear  being examined in this Manner it will appear that the Author intended to exhibit in the most striking Colours the horrid Crime of Filial Ingratitude To enforce this he represents an old Monarch tired with the Cares of State and willing to distribute his Possessions among his Daughters in Proportion to their Affections towards his Person Accordingly the two that flatter him obtain all the third Sister being disinherited for her Sincerity and the King is at length driven by the Ingratitude of his two eldest Daughters to an extreme of Madness which produces the finest Tragic Distress ever seen on any Stage  As this is the Groundwork of the Play I am surprized that any Critic should impute the Madness of  Lear  to the Loss of Royalty The Behaviour of his  Children is always uppermost in his Thoughts and we perceive it working upon his Passions till at Length his Mind settles into a fixed Attention to that single Object This I think will appear in a critical Examination of the Play  Lear  in his first Scene shews himself susceptible of the most violent Emotions The Poet has drawn him impetuous to the greatest Degree proud haughty revengeful and tenderhearted In such a Mind it is not to be wondered that Illtreatment should excite the most uneasy Sensations He takes fire at an imaginary Appearance of Disaffection in  Cordelia  But goes thy Heart with this  So young and so untender  He is soon after alarmed with Suspicions of Disrespect from  Gonerill  "I will look further into't"He then is convinced of her contemptuous Disregard and the Effect it has upon him indicates a Mind impotent and liable to the worst Perturbations  D  Lear  walk thus speak thus where are his Eyes  Either his Notion weakens his Discernings  Are lethargy'd  His Reflections after this shew what is nearest to his Heart  Ingratitude thou marblehearted Fiend  More Lideous when thou shew'st thee in a Child  Than the SeaMonster  He observes that  Cordelia  's Fault was small and when even that made such an Impression on him what are we to expect from his fiery Disposition when rejected by those to whom he had given all His Imprecation though big with Horror is the natural Result of his Indignation and the Tenderness and Overflowings of Softness which melt him in the midst of his Vehemence produce a fine Conflict of Passions  Th'untented Woundings of a Father's Curse  Pierce ev'ry Sense about theeOld fond Eyes  Reweep this Cause again I'll pluck ye out  And cast ye with the Waters that you lose  To temper Clay  His Haughtiness then breaks out in a Menace to his Daughter  Thou shal't find  That I'll resume the Shape which thou dost think  I have cast off forever  His Address to  Regan  is extremely tender and pathetic  Thy tenderhested Nature shall not give  Thee o'er to Harshness  And a little after  Thou better know'st  The Offices of Nature Bond of Childhood  Effects of Courtesie Dues of Gratitude  Thy half o'th' Kingdom thou hast not forgot  Wherein I thee endow'd  There have been many Poets who were acquainted in general with the Passions of human Nature and accordingly we find them constantly describing their Effects but  Shakespear  's Art shows their Impulse and their Workings without the Aid of Definition or flowery Description Besides the general Survey of the Heart he was more intimately versed in the various Tempers of Mankind than any Poet whatever We always find that he makes the Passions of each Personage in his Drama operate according to his peculiar Habit and Frame of Mind and in the Tragedy in Question there are so many Strokes of this Nature that in my Opinion it is his MasterPiece In every Speech in  Lear  's Mouth there is such an artful Mixture of thwarting Passions that the Heartstrings of an Audience are torn on every  Side The frequent Transition and Shifting of Emotions is natural to every Breast but in  Lear  they are characteristical Marks of his Temper  I pr'ythee Daughter do not make me mad  I will not trouble thee my Child Farewel  We'll meet no moreno more see one another  But yet thou art my Flesh my Blood my Daughter  Or rather a Disease that's in my Flesh  c  But I'll not chide thee  Let Shame come when it will I do not call it  I do not bid the Thunder bearer shoot  Nor tell Tales of thee to high judging  Jove  In this Speech every Masterpassion in his Temper rises in Conflict his Pride his Revenge his quick Resentment and his Tenderness  Shakespear  has beautifully repeated Instances of this Nature in almost every Line and the following Passage has some of the finest Turns in the World  O let not Woman's Weapons WaterDrops  Stain my Man's Cheeksno ye unnatr'al Hags  I will have such Revenges on ye bothI'll do such Things  What they are I know notBut they shall be  The Terrors of the Earthyou think I'll weep  NoI'll not weepI have full Cause of weeping  This Heart shall break into a thousand Flaws  Or e'er I'll weepO Fool I shall go mad  Here the distressed Monarch leaves his Daughter's Roof and the next Time we see him he is on a wild Heath in a violent Storm where all his Reflections take a Tincture from the gloomy Colour of a Mind diseased with Anguish and we soon see what is the principal Object of his Attention  Thou allshaking Thunder  Crack Nature's Mould all Germins spill at once  That make  UNGRATEFUL MAN  And again  The Tempest in my Mind  Doth from my Senses take all Feeling else  Save what beats thereFilial Ingratitude  His sudden Apostrophe to his Daughters must draw Tears from every Eye  O Regan Gonerill  Your old kind Father whose frank Heart gave all  The breaking off has a fine Effect  O that Way Madness lieslet me shun that  No more of that  As yet the Perturbation of his Mind does not seem fixed to a Point he begins to moralize but still with a View to his own Afflictions until  Edgar  enters disguised like a Madman  Lear  's first Question is  have his Daughters brought him to this Pass couldst thou save nothing didst thou give them all  And this I take to be the first Touch of fixed Madness in the Play and might point out to any Man the Cause of his Destraction without thinking of the Resignation of his Sceptre or the mere Loss of regal Power  As our Hero is now out of his Senses a new Field opens itself to the Poet He had before display'd every Movement of the Heart and the human Understanding now becomes his Province in which we shall find he acquits himself with the most masterly Skill Mr  Locke  observes that  Madmen do not seem to have lost the Faculty of Reasoning but having joined together some Ideas very wrongly they mistake them for Truths and they err as Men do that argue right from wrong Principles For by the Violence of their Imaginations having mistaken their Fancies for Realities they make right Deductions from them  Agreeably to this Account  Lear  upon the Appearance of a Madman takes it for granted that it is owing to his Daughters illtreatment and when contradicted he replies  Death Traitor nothing could have subdued Nature to such a Lowness but his unkind Daughters  He next takes him for a Philosopher and agreeably to that Notion enquires  what is the Cause of Thunder  In his next Scene a Desire of revenging his Grievances actuates his Mind  To have a thousand with red burning Spits  Come hizzing in upon 'em  He then proceeds to arraign his Daughters in a Court of Justice  Arraign her first 'tis  Gonerill  I here take Oath before this honourable Assemblyshe kicked the poor King her FatherHere is another too whose warpt Looks proclaim what Store her Heart is made of  He still continues to dwell in Imagination upon the Crime of Ingratitude which appears to him so shocking that he exclaims  Let them anatomize  Regan  see what breeds about her HeartIs there any Cause in Nature for these hard Hearts  This last Stroke cannot fail to draw Tears from every Eye The Reader will please to observe that all this Time there is not a Word said of his Royalty on the contrary he says to  Edgar  You Sir I entertain for one of my Hundred only I do not like the Fashion of your Garment  c  which hundred was appointed after his Abdication  After this how was  Shakespear  to represent  Lear  again so as to keep up the Passions and heighten the Distress By taking Advantage of every Circumstance in  Lear  's Temper He had said that he would reassume the Shape he had cast off This then remained untouched and accordingly in the next Scene we perceive him actually putting it in Execution and his Fancy suggests to him that he is a King from which he reasons as  from every other Principle and always with an Eye to his Children "No" they cannot touch me for "coining I am the King himself"  There's my GauntletI'll prove it on a Giant  From this his Imagination wanders  Bring up the brown Bills O well flown Barb i'th' Clout i'th' Clout Hewgh give the Word  From this Rambling he soon returns and the habitual Ideas again take Possession of him  Ha  Regan Gonerill  they flattered me like a Dog  c  After this  Glo'ster  enquiring if it is not the King he catches at the Word and answers "Ay every Inch a King" And then he draws some more Inferences from that Notion till he reflects that  Glo'ster  's Bastard Son was kinder to his Father than his own Daughters got in lawful Sheets From this he digresses into an Invective against Women and continues raving till at length his Spirit of Revenge returns upon him  And when I've stolen upon these SONSINLAW then kill kill kill kill  It was  Shakespear  's Art to reserve his being crowned with Straw for the last Scene of his Madness as it is a Representation of human Nature reduced to the lowest Ebb Had he lost his Reason on Account of his abdicated Throne the Emotions of Pity would not be so intense as they now are when we see him drove to that Extreme by the Cruelty of his own Children Every Topic of parental Distress being exhausted and all the King's MasterPassions displayed in his Madness the Poet judiciously shews him gradually coming to himself in the next Scene and we see the Ideas dawning slowly on his Soul  Where have I beenwhere am Ifair Daylight  In this Recollection of his Reason he never once mentions the Loss of Royalty but again touches upon the Cause of his Distress in his Speech to  Cordelia  I know you do not love me for your Sisters  Have as I do remember done me wrong  You have some Cause they have not  So that before his Madness in it and after it  Lear  never loses Sight of the Ideas which had worn such Traces on his Brain and he must be unfeeling to the great Art

of of Mr  Ranger  I am persuaded needs little Apology especially when it goes from one who though a Stranger to you has a real Regard to your Reputation as an Author and having often received great Pleasure from your Weekly Essays takes this Liberty of throwing out his Thoughts to you on a Piece of Criticism in which he differs with you is Opinion  Your Paper of last  Saturday  an Examen of King  Lear  and you think many Critics have mistaken the principal Idea in the old King's Mind during his State of Madness After citing  Lear's  Exclamation on the Ingratitude of his Daughters you add  This might lead any Man to the Cause of  Lear  's Madness without thinking of the Resignation of his Sceptre  But certainly whoever considers  Lear  's Character with Attention will from the very Passage you quote beside an hundred others think there is much to be said on the other Side of the Question  I have read with great Pleasure several of the Remarks you make on the Speeches in  Lear  which are such as can arise only in the Mind of a Reader of Taste but I cannot agree that  He must be unfeeling to the great Art of our Poet who can look for any other Cause of Distress  in the Madness of the King than the Ingratitude of his Daughters  I know not in what Manner you may treat the Remarks I am about to make but I can sincerely assure you they are only intended as Hints to yourself on a Subject which I think of some Consequence to the Admirers of  Shakespear  The Critic in the  Adventurer  was somewhat wanting in Justice to the Poet by mentioning the Loss of Royalty as the sole Cause of  Lear  's Madness without taking Notice at the same Time of the forcible Idea he must have of the Ingratitude of his two Daughters and I think Mr  Ranger  also wrong in excluding intirely his Opinion What I purpose here is to point out  both the Ideas  working strongly in his Mind and what the Author intended as conducive to the Moral of his Play  No Critic on  Shakespear  can better explain the Characters he draws than the Poet himself does in every Speech we not only see what his Persons are during the Scene represented but we are also made acquainted by some nice Touches in each Play with their former Mode of thinking and acting and as no Poet ever understood  Nature better in the Operation of the Passions so he always makes them speak and act in the highest Conformity to their Characters In this Respect his Genius and Judgment is every where equal to  Horace  's Precept  Aetatis cujusque notandi sunt tibi Mores  Lear  's Deportment and Sentiments in regard to his Daughters in the first Act and what  Gonerill  says of him to  Regan  mark very plainly his Character which is that of  a haughty passionate inconstant weak old Man  He does not resign his Authority to his Daughters so much out of Love to them as to rid himself of the Cares of GovernmentHe retains the Name of King with a suitable Train of AttendantsHe still commands with his former Impetuosity of Temper and is jealous even of Trifles This the ill natured Character of the Daughters will not suffer and they are in Consultation in the most undutiful and unbecoming Manner to deprive him of his remaining Shew of Power Their Behaviour and Ingratitude soon appear in the most glaring Instances and make the old King sorely sensible that he had  given them  ALL  Nature was  Shakespear  's Guide he describes the Imagination affected by concurring Causes to pave the Way for a Scene of the highest Distress  Lear  as a King and Father feels with great Sensibility the Shocks of his Daughters Ingratitude and unnatural Treatment and exhibits a moving Picture of the Feelings of the Heart and the various Conflicts of Passions very expressive of his Character and Circumstances if the Poet had nothing more in view he might have been well content with the masterly Picture he has drawn of his Distress Grief and Rage in every Scene before the Loss of his Senses but he has crowned the Distress by making him at last fix his Imagination on his own Rashness and Folly in giving away his ALL and putting it out of his  Power to avenge himself And 'tis this Reflection chiefly drives him to Madness  The jesting of his Fool wholly turns upon his  unkinging himself  and retaining  nothing  which  Lear  minutely attends to and says "A bitter FoolAfter  Gonerill  's Proposal to reduce his Train he breaks out  "Woe that too late repents"  Then the Ingratitude of his Daughters and his own Folly deeply strike him  O Lear Lear Lear  Beat at this Gate that let thy Folly in  And thy dear Judgment out  Afterwards he says to  Gonerill  Thou shalt find  That I'll resume the Shape which thou dist think  I have cast off for ever  Gon  do you mark that  In the next Scene wrapt up in Thought he says  To TAKE 'T AGAIN PERFORCE  Monster Ingratitude  In this Line the two Ideas are strongly blended and the  Loss of Power  foremost for surely that was the obvious Reason of the Insults he had received if he had still been in Possession they would have continued to sprinkle him with  Court Holywater  The Fool whose Phrase the last is says  Fathers that wear Rags  Do make their Children blind  But Fathers that bear Bags  Shall see their Children kind  c  I must here take Notice of the different Colouring used by our Poet and all good Writers in distinguishing the Characters of Men seemingly agitated by the same Passions  Lear  's Idea of his Folly in divesting himself of his Authority is nicely and artfully distinguished by  Shakespear  from that Kind of Regret which an imperious Man of a different Character would feel from the Deprivation of PowerHe is full of the Loss of his Dignity only as it was the Occasion of the ill Treatment he met with and not from a Thirst of Rule  This Idea and that of the Ingratitude of his Daughters which he feels as the Consequence of it I cannot help thinking are as closely united in his Madness as two Twigs twisted together and growing out of the same Stem  When he exclaims and reproaches his Daughters in that heartpiercing Scene of Distress on the Heath he says  O Regan O Gonerill  Your old kind Father whose frank Heart  gave all  O that Way Madness liesLet me shun  THAT  No more of  THAT  On his Recollection that he  gave all  he breaks short and immediately subjoins "O that Way Madness lies let me shun  that  no more of  thati e  Let me not think that I have been guilty of so much Folly as to have given  all  to such ungrateful Wretchesthe Reflection will make me mad  I know it may be insisted on by you and perhaps by many others that  Lear  makes use of the Sentiment of  giving all  only to tax the Ingratitude of his Daughters in a higher Degree but tis possible you may be of a contrary Opinion if you can allow that the Moral of this Play does not expose the Ingratitude of Children more than the Folly of Parents  This same Folly of Parents  is also touched with great Judgment in the Underplot of  Glo'ster  and the Characters of  Lear  's two Daughters are finely contrasted with those of  Cordelia  and  Edgar  and the Poet's Design in marking out so strongly the Folly and illjudged Partiality of Parents is confirmed by the Behaviour of  Edmund    When  Lear  sees the Wretchedness of  Edgar  he pursues the same Train of Reasoning which before possest him and asks  Didst thou  GIVE ALL  to thy DaughtersAnd art thou to come to this  And immediately after  What Have his Daughters brought him to this Pass  Could'st thou  save nothing  did'st thou  give them all  This is agreeable to his CharacterAnd from all that we hear in common Life for there are many Stories of old weak Parents who have acted much in the Manner of  Lear  and to the Reproach of human Nature have met with Ingratitude and Disobedience these I say in their Feelinghours of Distress are reported to have reproached themselves with their Folly in GIVING ALL as well as exclaimed against the Ingratitude of their Children  There are many Characters I doubt not now in the World who retain a Heap of Treasure useless to themselves from their Children on no better Motives than to insure their Duty and Attention and some who carry the Moral of this Play to a ridiculous Height by denying their Children an Independance merely on the same Parity of Reasoning without considering the Difference between the Prudence of Parents and their Folly  I FORBEAR making any Quotations from  Lear  's Speeches in his Madness I think the Whole obvious enough and that our immortal Poet who had a perfect Knowledge of the Workings of the human Mind has drawn  both the Ideas  in  Lear  's Madness agreeable to the Representation he has made of him in the first Act  What I have hitherto said is entirely confined to the different Opinions of Mr  Ranger  and the  Adventurer  nor do I expect that you shall alter your's in Conformity to my JudgmentLet a diligent Examination of the Play determine you in the future Criticisms you intend to give the Public on this Subject  WHAT has often occurr'd to me in reading over the several Editions of our Poet and what has been said by you and many great Geniusses only serve to convince me of the Difficulty of any one Man's succeeding in a perfect Criticism on  Shakespear  at least I have Reason  to think so from what I have seen of the several Attempts that have been made by different Commentators from the Time of Mr  Rowe  to the mutilated Condition our Poet was thrown into by subsequent Editors  Several Persons have succeeded in illustrating many of the Characters he draws and have pointed out to public Notice many of his latent Beauties but I believe  there is scarce one Man alive  to speak in the Stile of a very extraordinary Address to a great Man in last  Saturday's Inspector who is even capable of calling all his Beauties by their proper Names  much less of  exhibiting them all with Advantage to the Public  whose Property  they now are if they will acquire a Taste to enjoy 'em  I can't forbear mentioning the Obligation which the Public has to the Genius of Mr  Garrick  who has exhibited with great Lustre many of the most shining Strokes of  Shakespear  's amazing Art and may be justly stiled as he was once called by you his best Commentator For 'tis certain he has done our Poet more Justice by his Manner of playing his principal Characters than any Editor has yet done by a Publication  I shall conclude with the same Freedom as I began by desiring you will consider my Manner of treating this Subject as the mere Hints

Tyriâ Sol jungit ab Urbe  VIRG  _THOUGH I have in my two last Papers entirely confined the Attention of my Readers to critical Enquiries I shall make no Apology for offering another Essay this Day upon a Subject nearly connected with those Matters the more especially as the Honour of our Country is in some Sort concerned in the present Lucubration against a  French  Writer upon whom I have formerly animadverted and who has taken in some Passages of his Works unbecoming Liberties with the  English  Nation  Prefixed to  Voltaire  's  Merope  we find a Letter to  Maffei  the Author of an  Italian  Tragedy on the same Subject in which that Writer after mentioning a faulty Piece which was performed on the  English  Stage delivers himself in the following Words  Elle fut sans doute mal reque mais n'est il pas bien etrange qu'on l'ait representie N'est ce pas une preuve que le Teatre  Angloise  n'est pas encore epuré Il semble que la méme cause qui prive les  Angloise  du Genie de la Painture de la Musique leur óte aussi celui de la Tragedie Cette Isle qui a produit les plus grand Philosophes de la Terre n'est pas aussi fertile pour les beaux Arts si les  Anglois  ne s'appliquent seriensement a suivre les Preceptes de leurs excellens Citoyens  Addison Pope  ils n'approcherent pas des autres Peuples en fait de Gout de Literature  The  English Merope  says  Voltaire  acted in the Year was not well  received but is it not surprising that it was exhibited at all May we not infer from thence that the  English  Stage has not as yet attained a due Degree of Refinement It looks as if the same Cause which has deprived the  English  of a Genius for Painting and Music has also withheld from them the Spirit of Dramatic Poetry That Island which has produced the greatest Philosophers in the World is not so happy with Regard to the polite Arts and unless they seriously attach themselves to the Precepts of their excellent Countrymen  Addison  and  Pope  they will be thrown at a Distance by other Nations in Point of Literature and Productions of Taste  Because the Managers of a Theatre suffered a bad Piece to be represented is it not unfair to derive from thence a Charge of Indelicacy upon a whole Nation more particularly when the Reception this Piece met with from the Public is rather an Indication of a correct and just Taste  What the Cause is which has deprived the  English  of a Genius for Painting and Music I am at a Loss to determine Certain it is those Arts flourished for a long Time in  Italy  before they came over the  Alps  to our northern Regions and it is certain that a Taste for them has prevailed many Years since in this Kingdom They have been cultivated here with the greatest Delicacy by several eminent Masters though we cannot boast as many exalted Geniusses as have adorned the softer Clime of  Italy  The Transfiguration by  Raphael  the Nativity by  Corregio  and the last Judgment by  Michael Angelo  will perhaps never be matched any where else but it is unfair to deduce a Conclusion from thence that we have no Genius for this excellent imitative Art in  England  PortraitPainting has been in as great a Degree of Perfection in this Country as in any other Part of the World Sir  Godfrey Kneller  found so much Taste among us that he made this his own Country and here  Lely  on animated Canvas stole  The sleepy Eye which spoke the melting Soul  But not to sneak from living worth to dead  as Mr  Pope  finely expresses it whoever has observed with Attention the Performances of  Hayman  must be convinced that  Voltaire  's Charge of a Want of Taste is perfectly groundless Every Thing is put out of Hand by this excellent Artist with the utmost Grace and Delicacy and his HistoryPieces have besides their beautiful Colouring the most lively Expression of Character  Hutson  's Rooms teem with mimic Life and  Hogarth  like a true Genius has formed a new School of Painting for himself He may be truly stiled the  Cervantes  of his Art as he has exhibited the ridiculous Follies of human Nature with the most exquisite Humour and he may be said to be the first who has wrote Comedy with his Pencil His  Harlot's Progress  and  Marriage Ala mode  are in my Opinion as well drawn as any Thing in  Moliere  and the Unity of Character which is the Perfection of Dramatic Poetry is so skilfully preserved that we are surprized to see the same Personage thinking agreeably to his complexional Habits in the many different Situations in which we afterwards perceive him The Frible the Bully the Politician the Lawyer the Miser and in short all the striking Characters in Life are by this Gentleman so admirably depicted upon Canvas that I am convinced  Voltaire  would be at a Loss to shew where he has been equalled by any of his Countrymen  We may also boast an equal Excellence in Music for though Mr  Handell  is not an  Englishman  it is however a convincing Proof of our national Taste that we have made it worth his while to fix his Residence among us and that we have shewn a due Sensibility to manly Melody where the Sound is expressive of the Sense and where no unnatural Divisions nor idle insignificant  Quirks mislead the Ear in a thrilling Maze of wild and and random Notes It is owing to the Encouragement we have afforded this Gentleman that we can now boast the noblest and most rational Music in the World Besides such a Genius as Doctor  Boyce  will be always sufficient to vindicate us from  Voltaire  's national Opprobrium and the Admirers of  Arne  have constantly celebrated him for his peculiar Talent at finding the most emphatic Expression in a Composition and discovering where the Passions are placed in every Piece of Poetry To these Passages he never fails to give their full Energy and like a ravishing Commentator he brings new Beauties into Light with such a Sweetness of Harmony that every Breast yields irresistibly to the melting Impression I am proud to have an Opportunity of saying that we are likely to have an  English  Opera set to Music by the last mentioned Gentleman which I persuade myself will do Honour to him and his Country  Since the Time when the above Essay was wrote Mr  Smith  a Pupil of Mr  Handell  's has displayed a noble Genius for musical Composition and the Success which his Opera called the  Fairies  met with on  DruryLane  Stage at once gives lustre to his Merit and is a Proof of the public Taste  With Regard to Dramatic Poetry our Advantage over every Nation in the known World is I think very apparent The best Critics have laid it down as a Rule that a Performance is to be judged by its Number of striking Beauties and not by some Inaccuracies and the Instances of occasional Conformity to the vicious Taste of the Times If  Shakespear  is viewed in this light he will certainly appear to any unprejudiced Reader infinitely superior to  Corneille Racine  and all the polished Writers of  France  and  Italy  I remember a Passage in  Voltaire  's Writings where he is at infinite Pains to bring together a String of Quotations from the best  French  Tragedies to evince their great Talents for the sublime in all he makes up about twenty or thirty at  most and the Beauties of  Shakespear  have of late been published in several Volumes Besides  Otway  has found Access to the Heart better than any  French Writer  whatever and the domestic Passions are touched by him with the greatest Elegance and Simplicity It is very common on the  French  Stage to hear a Personage of the Drama exclaiming perpetually  Helas  and  mon Dicu  and then formally acquainting the Audience that he feels such and such Sensations but our great Masters of the Passions make their Hearers feel by Sympathy the Agitations of their Hero's Breast without running into cold languid Declamation  The Dramatic Poetry of this Country is like our Constitution built upon the bold Easis of Liberty and though the latter has brought our King to the Block and the former admits Blood to be shed on the Stage these are Corruptions which have intruded and are as the Poets says  Effects unhappy from a noble Cause  Upon the whole we may apply what  Horace  has said to the  English  Nation  Spirat Tragicum satis feliciter audet  Sed turpem putat in Chartis metuitque lituram  Our Poets are sufficiently possessed of the Spirit of Tragedy but they are not attentive to the minute Rules of correct Taste and the Trouble of blotting It may be added that they have more real Fire sublimer Sentiments and Characters better marked than any Nation whatever and with regard to Painting and Music we can boast so many Masters in both as might have prevented the  French  Author from charging us with a Want of Genius and Taste for the fine Arts  I cannot dismiss this Paper without observing that it is a very particular Pleasure to me to find the Subject on which I have been hitherto offering some scattered Reflections touched upon with great Spirit by a Writer of acknowledged Genius  Mr  Gathric  In a Preface to  a Novel called the FRIENDS he has expressed himself with great Warmth and a noble national Jealousy After mentioning that  Voltaire  calls his Countrymen THE ABSOLUTE LEGISLATORS OF ALL THE FINE ARTS IN EUROPE "how shameless" says he  is this Assertion in the Face of a Country that gave Bread to  Holben  Dignities to  Reubens  and Encouragement to  Vandike  and that for Years before even by this Writer's own Acknowledgment the national Taste of  France  was formed While that Taste was barbarous  Johnson  enriched his native Tongue with Comedies wrought up to more than  Terentian  Regularity and Propriety in point of Conduct and while  France  was ignorant of almost every Order of Architecture  Inigo Jones  in  England  was rearing Houses and projecting Palaces which all the boasted Improvements of  France  in that Art have not yet equalled I shall forbear to urge the Examples of  Spencer  or  Shakespear  because I am firmly and seriously of Opinion that no  Frenchman  ever yet was able supposing him to understand  English  equally as  French  to taste the Beauties of either of these Poets For the Truth of this I appeal to every  Englishman  's Sense who has had the Misfortune to read the unwilling scanty starved and mistaken Encomiums that  Voltaire  has bestowed on  Shakespear  Is it not rather too charitable in the Author of the foregoing Passage to suppose Monsieur  Voltaire  's reserved Praises of  Shakespear  could arise only from an Inability of relishing his Beauties For my Part I must avow it the  French  Writer appears to me capable of feeling every Stroke of our great Poet but Envy and a vain Ambition of erecting himself into an imagined Superiority have rendered him open and explicit in his Abuses and hesitating and frigid in his Commendations But to conclude what  Virgil  has given away from his Countrymen we claim for ours None better shall inform the  breathing Brass or soften Marble into mimic Features none shall better plead or with equal Sagacity describe the Motions of the planetary System and the Laws of Nature and besides it shall be our further Praise to spare a vanquished Foe and to check the Encroachments of an intriguing faithless perfidious Enemy ever restless and aiming at an universal Monarchy which it is to be hoped the Councils and Arms of  Great Britain  will for ever hold from them  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  DruryLane  Jan    THE Tragedy of  Richard the Third  was performed here lately and as there were many Circumstances in the Battle which was fought in the fifth Act quite unknown to the Audience it may not be improper to give some Account of that Engagement The Theatrical Cock had done Salutation to the Morn and  Richard  had animated the Soldiery when the Attack was begun on the LeftWing under the Command of the Lord High  Constable Grey  This Impression was received by General  Raftor  who ordered the Woods to be scowered but the Enemy setting up the Warhoop he was repulsed into the GreenRoom where he rallied his Spirits and his Forces and again returned to the Charge Upon this the Fight was renewed with great Alacrity and continued very obstinate until a general Desolation stretched the greatest Part of the Combatants upon the Scene of Action Upon this occasion General  Raftor  fell greatly lamented and if we may be allowed to imitate  Sallust  the same Absence of Passion for which he was remarkable while living was legible in his Countenance Lord High Constable  Grey  was overpowered by Numbers and his Body was taken up far from his Friends among fallen Heaps of the Enemy still breathing short and clinching his Staff with the same Eagerness he had done all his  Life Lieutenant General  Mar  fell much lamented We cannot at present furnish an exact Account of the Loss on either Side but the MusterRoll which has been handed to us stands as follows  Wounded Carpenters  Scene Drawers  Dressers  Thunderers  Lighteningmakers  Barbers  Women scalped  ie  lost their Caps  This is all we can offer at present but it is expected that a perfect List will be

Ducere solicitae jucunda oblivia vitae  HOR  _I LATELY met with a Fable in a  French  Writer which I thought carried with it a great Deal of Propriety and though it was rather eked out as is sometimes the Case among the liveliest Geniusses of that Country beyond the just Limits prescribed by the Matter contained in it it was however conducted with such a Prettiness of Fancy and Expression that I was very much entertained with the Perusal of it Poetry says my Author is the Son of the God of  Ease  and the Goddess of  Meditation  He bears in his Appearance such a strong Resemblance to these his Parents that it is impossible to mistake the Marks of his Legitimacy and  therefore whenever these Proofs of his Birth are deficient we may with Reason conclude him to be of a spurious Breed  From his Father he derives his apparent Indolence his Serenity his graceful Elocution and his unlaboured Turn of Thought together with his elegant Felicity in all his Compositions a remarkable Neglect of the ordinary Uses of Life a Disregard for Riches and a total Absence of all worldly Ambition save what is inspired by Virtue and honest Fame are his distinguishing Characteristics From his Mother he possesses his Modesty which makes him not very fond of obtruding himself into Company his pensive Air which inclines him to be always enforcing some Precept of Morality or some Topic which may be subservient to the Use or Enjoyment of Life his Love of Solitude which induces him to shun Crowds and great Cities and leads him into rural Scenes where he may give free Scope to his Imagination undisturbed by the Cares and Anxieties of Life The same Disposition in his Temper renders him not very fond of being known by the Bulk of Mankind that he may prevent the Inconveniencies attendant on him when his Affairs require that he should make his Appearance in Public If he puts any thing abroad into the World and thinks proper to publish the Result of his contemplative Moments he does not like to be pointed at by the Multitude but chuses to receive the Tribute of Applause obtained by his Writings without being liable to the Sarcasms the Taunts and malevolent Jests which are always the sure Concomitants of Praise and which are generally a very great Discount upon his Happiness  From these Motives he is enamoured with Retirement and he is further confirmed in his sequestred State by a Consideration that the more he keeps himself at a  Distance from the Rest of Mankind the more Beauties they are willing to descry in his Productions in like Manner as the Hills and the remote Parts of a Prospect present a more vivid Green than when our Advances to them have brought the Scene more close to our Inspection and the Heath the craggy Rock and ploughed Land are familiarised to the naked Eye  This is the Substance of the Fable the Meaning that it inculcates is certainly very just and obvious The best Writers in all Ages have subscribed to it and the most applauded of the antient Poets are constantly offering warm Pictures of rural Imagery to our Imaginations they seem to be stifled with Dust and Smoke when they mention a CityLife and we frequently sind them expatiating with Rapture upon the Pleasures of a CountryLife which they look upon to be the Nurse of Thought and the only Sphere in which their Studies can be prosecuted with any Degree of Success  The same Observation will hold good with Regard to all Kinds of Writing unless it be those excellent Productions of the Press which make their Appearance under the various Shapes of  Newgate  Memoirs New'sPapers and political Pamphlets In Works that call for a long Train of Reasoning subtile Disquisitions and unwearied Application undoubtedly the proper Place to accomplish them is in those Regions where Riot and Debauchery are Strangers where Gaming Drinking and idle Amusements of all Sorts are unknown and where above all Health and Cheerfulness add new Lustre to the Face of Things  It may perhaps seem a Paradox if I should assert that among all the Gentlemen of the Quill there is not one to whom Solitude and Ease are more necessary than the periodical Writer but though his Compositions are generally comprized in a narrow Compass and though he does not for the most Part  pretend to search every Subject to the Bottom though it is not expected of him to lay before the Reader deep philosophical Speculations abstracted Reasonings and new Systems of Morality and Religion yet in my Apprehension it will be found upon an attentive Survey of his Situation that it is particularly incumbent on the Adventurer in this Way to withdraw himself from the Bustle of Mankind and to appear as seldom as possible in little Circles at Coffeehouses convivial Clubs at Taverns and the long Train of public Places which serve no other Purpose in this Metropolis than merely to kill Time as the Phrase is and to hurry a Person into a Course of Vanity and Dissipation  There is a Passage in Mr  Pope  which I have ever perused with Admiration because it shews him to have been a Man of the most prudent Understanding as well as the most finished Poet Two Adjuncts which are seldom found to coexist  I ne'er with Wits and Witlings pass'd my Days  To spread about the Itch of vulgar Praise  Nor like a Puppy daggl'd thro' the Town  To fetch and carry Singsong up and down  Nor at Rehearsals mouth'd and sweat and cry'd  With Handkerchief and Orange at my Side  I askt no Homage from the Race that write  But kept like Eastern Monarchs from their Sight  And sick of Fops and Poetry and Prate  To  Bufo  lest the whole  Castalian  State  Perhaps too great a Tincture of Pride runs through these Lines for any one else to make Application of them to himself  Pope  had Talents superior to almost all Mankind but if a more humble Writer cannot withdraw himself from our present TownSmarts and Critics like an Eastern Monarch he may at least accomplish it like  Juvenal  's Friend in his third Satire  who retired from  Rome  to avoid its Plagues and Inconveniencies  Atque unum civem donare Sibyllae  It is possible my Readers may think these Tenets inconsistent with the Character of  Ranger  but airy and gay as  Ranger  may appear he is now perfectly averse to the wild Sallies of his Namesake in the Play He would not chuse to stagger home from a Box and Dice in the Morning nor to get through a Window into an honest Gentleman's House at Night he cannot run after every white Apron he sees nor keep Company with a Set of Fellows whom he despises And yet there are Dissipations to which a Resident in Town is for ever liable add to these the Danger attendant on a Writer's making himself known in too many Quarters of the Town Prejudices are ever apt to arise against an Author who does not take care to conceal himself The Transition is so quick from the Performance to the Person who produced it that from the Moment a Man begins to publish he is enlisted into a State of Warfare with almost all the Critics and  Malevoli  of the Age  Some Readers have no Criterion by which to judge of a Production except the Rules of Physiognomy and if an Author appears younger than themselves they hold it absolutely impossible to receive any Instruction from him It is by the Way somewhat strange that this experienced Class will not allow a Man to be sit to entertain them until his Imagination begins to flag his Invention to close like Flowers at the Setting of the Sun his Memory to decay and his Wit if he have any Share of it to become slow and tardy This however is what is desired by the Man who would look an Author in the Teeth to know his Age and from thence make an Estimate of his Merit  Qui redit ad fastos virtutem estimat annis  There is another Set of People who make it their Business to pry into a Writer's Connections and thoroughly inform themselves of his Attachments his Friendships and his Resentments According as these coincide with their own Way of Thinking they blame or approve even though the Author is absolutely impartial in his Animadversions  There says one  Ranger  is right  O Dn  the Fellow was ever such a Position as thismy dear  Ranger  that won't pass upon usWe know you are ptejudiced in this Affair and there again You praise this Man because you are intimate with him Did I not see you walk Arm in Arm with him the other Night at the Coffeehouse  In this Manner is the Person judged who attempts to run the dangerous Career of Wit as  Boileau  expresses it  du bel Esprit la Carriere epineuse  and upon the whole I think it may be laid down as a Maxim that no periodical Writer should ever reside in this Metropolis that he may effectually evade the Censures of Prejudice the Blasts of Detraction the Envy of rival Wit and the several Avocations of a TownLife It may be added that it is absolutely necessary that an Author should never suffer himself to be known on Account of the Antipathy which will arise to his Person  Patroclus  conquered for a long Time in the Armour of  Achilles  but had he let the Secret escape abroad with double his Strength and Valour he would not have been able to atchieve any Thing

with all the Pomp of a superb Edition and as Part of them by being addressed to Mr  Pope  may be thought to coincide with his religious Tenets I have jugded it not improper to lay before my Readers some Particulars relating to this Matter which I lately met with in a Volume of the ingenious  Racine  That excellent  French  Author had it seems given vent to some Animadversions on Mr  Pope  's  Essay on Man  and the Consequence was that our great Poet uneasy at the Reflection resolved to assert his System in a Letter to the  French  Writer which he inclosed to the celebrated Chevalier  Ramsay  This Correspondence will throw a Light on  Pope  's Way of Thinking in religious Matters and will evidently shew that he was far from embracing  Bolingbroke  's Principles As the Sanction of so great a Genius would in all Probability greatly ferve the Purposes of the noble Writer it will in some Measure defeat that End and convince Mankind that Mr  Pope  thought the Imputation of Deism would blemish that fair Fame of which he was enamoured and it may prove entertaining to the meer  English  Reader to see what a polite Intercourse was carried on between two Geniusses of different Nations Strangers to each other and only connected by their Wit and Parts  A Letter from the Chevalier  RAMSAY  to M  RACINE  SIR  I WAS highly pleased and do not doubt but you will be pleased also at the Receipt of a Letter which Mr  Pope  has sent me to be forwarded to you You will perceive by the Contents that it was not without just Grounds I undertook in a former Letter to justify the Principles of my illustrious Countryman My Vindication of him might possibly be suspected to have its Source in Friendship and therefore lose greatly of its Strength But here Sir he pleads his own Defence his Letter will demonstrate to you his Zeal for Religion and it is to be hoped will silence his Accusers You will find it accompanied by a Defence of his System written by Mr  Warburton  a celebrated Clergyman of the Church of  England  Mr  Pope  by distributing this Performance amongst his Friends adopts the Doctrine approves the Sentiments and thereby gives to the whole an additional Value  The Opinion which you conceived of Mr  Pope  is on your Side very excusable You received the Impression from the Misrepresentations of his Enemies for many Enemies he has  Urit enim fulgero suo  c His superior Talents have excited a great deal of Envy towards his Person and his Connections with several eminent Personages all engaged in opposite Interests or attached to the Court have further served to inflame the Minds of Men against him But there are many evincing Proofs of his Probity and the Incorruptibility of his Principles  I have been informed that he was in Intimacy with several successive Ministers and often with many at the same Time Thus circumstanced it would have been easy for him to create a large Fortune had he availed himself of the Disgrace of one Party in order to recommend himself to the other But he possessed a Soul superior to such mean Artifices  My Intelligence adds further that the Queen who was an Admirer of his Genius expressed an Inclination to employ him without requiring any Thing further of him than a dissembled Conformity to the established Religion of his Country promising at the same Time to dispense with the Strictness of the Oath usually administered upon such Occasions But Mr  Pope  was inaccessible to Temptation which may serve to prove he was directed by other Principles than those of a Sceptic or a Deist  I must assure you Sir that I am not induced to this Task by supererogatory Friendship to Mr  Pope  nor am I willing to offer him the Incense of Adulation I mean solely to serve the Cause of Truth and Justice and am  Sir c

you impute several Principles to me which I abhor and detest My Uneafiness met some Alleviation from a Passage in  your Preface where you declare your Inability from a Want of Knowledge of the  English  Language to give your own Judgment on the  Essay on Man  you add that you do not controvert my Tenets but the evil Consequences deducible from them and the Drift of some Passages in my Poem which Persons of notable Sagacity imagine they have discovered This Declaration is a shining Proof of your Candor your Discretion and your Charity I must take Leave to assure you Sir that your Unacquaintance with the Original has not proved more fatal to me than the imperfect Conceptions of my Translators who have not sufficiently informed themselves of my real Sentiments Though the many additional Embellishments which my Piece has received from the elegant Version of  M D R  have done an Honour to the  Essay on Man  yet it has on the other Hand suffered a greater Injury from his frequent Misapprehension of the Principles it inculcates These Mistakes you will perceive are totally refuted in the  English  Piece which I have transmitted to you It is a critical and philosophic Commentary written by the learned Author of the  divine Legation of Moses  I flatter myself that the Chevalier  Ramsay  will from his Zeal for Truth take the Trouble to explain the Contents of it I shall then perswade myself that your Suspicions will be effaced and I shall have no Appeal from your Candor and Justice  In the mean Time I shall not hesitate to declare myself very cordially in Regard to some Particulars about which you have desired an Answer  I must avow then openly and sincerely that my Principles are diametrically opposite to the Sentiments of  Spinoza  and  Leibuitz  they are perfectly coincident with the Tenets of  M Paschal  and the Archbishop of  Cambray  and I shall always esteem it an Honour to me to imitate the Moderation with which the latter submitted his private Opinions to the Decisions of the  Church of which he professed himself to be a Member I have the Honour to be  Sir c  RACINE  's Answer to M  POPE  Paris  Oct    SIR  THE Mildness and Humility with which you justify yourself is a convincing Proof of your Religion the more so as you have done it to one on whom it is incumbent to make his own Apology for his rash Attack upon your Character Your Manner of pardoning me is the more delicate as it is done without any Mixture of Reproach but though you acquit me with so much Politeness I shall not so easily forgive myself  Certain it is a Precipitance of Zeal hurried me away As I had often heard Positions said to be yours or at least Consequences resulting from your Essay cited against certain Truths which I now find you respect as much as myself I thought I had a Right to enter the Lists with you The Passage in my Preface was extorted from me by a Degree of Remorse which I felt in writing against you This Remorse Sir was awakened in me by the Consideration that the greatest Men are always the most susceptible of the Truths of Revelation I was really grieved to think that Mr  Pope  should oppose a Religion whose Enemies have ever been contemptible and it appeared strange that in a Work which points out the Road to Happiness you should furnish Arms to those who are industrious to misguide us in the Research  Your Letter at the same Time that it does Honour to your Character must bring a Blush in my Face for having entertained unjust Suspicions but notwithstanding this I think myself obliged to make it public the Injury which I have done you was so the Reparation  should be the same I owe this to you I owe it to myself I owe it to Justice  Whatever may be urged in your Favour in the Commentary you have sent me it is now rendered unnecessary by your own Declaration The Respect which you avow for Religion is a sufficient Vindication of your Doctrine I will add that for the Future those among us who shall feel the laudable Ambition of making their Poetry subservient to Religion ought to take you for their Model and it should ever be remembred that the greatest Poet in  England  is one of the

a great Actress She is happy in a graceful Dignity of Deportment natural and sensible Elocution and in short the Character was so well sustained throughout the Play that she was allowed the most

otherwise if for the future they are only to marry among one another without any possible Means of improving the Breed by a Mixture of wholesome Flesh and Blood To what a wretched State  England  may

Preaching or Playing is of the greatest Service to a Christian Community Doctor SNAKEROOT thought proper to declare that though he had not seen the Inside of a Church any Time these fifteen Years past yet unless the Method of exhibiting was different from what it used to be when he was taken to those Places by his Grandmother he could not possibly conceive what could be the Advantage of frequenting them Doctor OPIUM not a little picqued at this Declaration thought proper on his Part to mention that he knew as little of what passed within the Walls of the Church as the  other but out of Respect to many reverend Dignitaries who were his extreme good Patients he could not help thinking that those Assemblies under proper Management might be rendered a tolerable instructive Amusement  I grant you replied  Snakeroot  if the Managers would pay some little Deference to the public Taste and in these Cases it ought to be consulted for it appears to me that Preaching and Playing had originally a pretty close Affinity Indeed I know nothing that can give a better Idea of the Simplicity of the antient Drama which without any Distinction of Scenes was divided into  three Acts  recited by one Person and each of them closed by a  Chorus  and they were generally presented upon some Festival instituted in Honour of the Deities and as a further Proof you know Sir continued he that in their Churches they still retain the Word  Pulpit  which the  Greek  Writers made use of to signify a Stage  Doctor OPIUM was going to reply when his Discourse was interrupted by the Appearance of Mr

Tranquillity being free from those sudden Alarms of Noise which are otherwise inevitable in any of the Inns of Court But my Repose has met with an Interruption of so pleasant a Kind that I have determined to acquaint my Readers with all the Particulars of the Incident  About ten Days since a Gentleman entered upon the Premises and ever since I have been frequently disturbed when at my Studies by such quick and unexpected Shocks that it was absolutely impossible for me to pursue the same Train of Thought with any Degree of Attention As I was YesterdayMorning perusing Mr  Hawkins Brown  's excellent Poem upon the Immortality of the Soul in which he has artfully combined in their full Force all the Arguments in Support of that important Article of our Belief suddenly I heard a violent Bounce over my Head the Cieling shook as if ready to come down and a Convulsion shook the whole House Deep Contemplation sometimes unbraces the Nerves to such a Degree that an unexpected Noise startles the whole Frame of the Body and throws the Spirits out of that placid State which is requisite in order to think with Calmness and Perspicuity This Discomposure I experienced upon so many Occasions and sometimes in  such quick Succession that I judged it proper to step up Stairs to the Gentleman to inform him of the Inconveniencies which I lay under and to beg of him to manage his Affairs for the future with less Turbulence  I knocked two or three Times at his Door but receiving no Answer and hearing him run about with great Violence of Exertion I made bold to walk in unbid You go into the DiningRoom through a GlassFoldingDoor which was at this Time shut but the Curtains undrawn Through the Window I saw the Gentleman pulling off his Cloaths with the utmost Vehemence and in an Instant he appeared in the Habit and Air of an old Woman delivering Doctor  Rock  's Bills upon  LudgateHill  Surprized at this Change I stopt short to observe the Actions of this extraordinary Personage and very shortly I was entertained with another Vicissitude of Appearance for quick as Lightening he shifted Cloaths and walked about the Room with a Basket and with an audible Voice pronounced  Muffins for Coffee and Tea Gentlemen and Ladies  This appeared extremely whimsical he then varied his Dress and with a Silver Pipe cried out  LondonEvening Post  After which he threw away his Bundle of Papers fall down upon his Knees laid his Hand on his Heart looked up with a great Expression of Joy and then rising indulged himself in all the whimsical Vagaries of a Man frantic with Sensations too exquisite to endure In this Way he continued for some Time and at length threw himself into an Attitude of Surprize after which he ran wild about the Room like one almost distracted with Despair looking up in vain to Heaven for Relief when to my great Amazement he unexpectedly mustered up his Spirits and with great Alacrity leaped through a small Aperture into the CoalHole After absconding there for a short Space of Time he came forth with a Sack of Coals upon his Shoulders which he emptied in the Middle of the Room calling with some Earnestness  "Below"  He had no sooner done this but he directed his Eyes sparkling with Joy to some imaginary Object with which his Fancy seemed to be highly pleased He then came forward and knocked at the Door where I had taken my Station which I then took an Opportunity to open and as I was advancing towards him he seized me by the Shoulder and twining me round with all his Strength sent me reeling into a Corner of his Room Upon this he walked into the outward Apartment slapping the Door after him and immediately opened a small Casement Window which was over the Door of his BedChamber From thence he stretched out his Neck and looking me full in the Face burst out into a loud Fit of Laughter then producing a Squirt he began to let fly at me in such a Manner that I was soon pretty well watered from Head to Foot The Exclamations which I vented upon this Occasion rung such a Peal in the Gentleman's Ears that he was brought to a Recollection of himself He came down very leisurely from his Post and with a modest Air and genteel Address he politely asked my Pardon and told me that he was so intent upon his Business that he really did not perceive that he was offering Indignities to a Stranger  Imagining that I was in the Hands of a Madman I was willing to acquiesce with his Apology but to satisfy my Curiosity I took the Liberty to enquire of him the Nature of his Business and what might be his Vocation  Sir said the Gentleman won't you please to be seated With regard to my Business Sir I am a Pantomime Poeta Pantomime Poet    Pray Sir what is a Pantomime Poet  To this Question my Friend answered with a Smile  a Writer of Pantomime Sir It is a Plan which I have determined to apply myself to having Reason to think that it is the only Way of succeeding in the present Age I was bred at  Eton  School from whence at a proper Time I was removed  to the University at both which Places I laid in a sufficient Store of  Greek  and  Latin  and always feeling a particular Turn for the Drama I applied my Genius principally to Tragedy and Comedy In each Species of Writing I have given the finishing Hand to some Pieces which have received the Approbation of a few Gentlemen of known Taste and perfectly versed in critical Matters Encouraged by their Opinion I came to Town and after a long tedious Application I find it impossible to get any of my Performances exhibited Mr  Garrick  has already like a provident General laid his Plan of Operations and Mr  Rich  is determined to bring on no new Pieces until we have such a Genius as  Tom Durfey  I wish Mr says he we had such another Writer now  On this Account I have taken a Resolution to cultivate a Species of the Drama which cannot fail of being profitable to all Parties and being agreeable to the public Taste will be brought on without Difficulty as soon as offered    Here I broke in upon the Thread of his Discourse by asking if he was determined to become Harlequin himself To this he answered me in the Negative but as it is a Rule in Writing to place yourself in the Situation of the Character for which you are to find suitable Dialogue he had judged it not improper to conform to this Precept and therefore in order the better to concert the sudden Escapes and Changes of Dress which have so pleasing an effect in this kind of Poetry he was practising over every striking Attitude and every unexpected Situation of the Harlequin that he might be the better able to form an Opinion of the Plot and the several Incidents of the Marvellous which he had found it necessary to introduce He proceeded to inform me that he purposed calling his first Piece HARLEQUIN TRIUMPHANT or POETRY IN THE SUDS In this Performance the whole Race of Authors are to be exposed  to the Derision of the Public and Harlequin is to crack a very great Number of facetious Jokes upon their shoulders with his wooden Sword A Poet is to be placed at a Table with a Beefstake laid before him to his inexpressible Joy when in an Instant by some curious Stroke of Art the solid Substance is to be changed into a modern Tragedy and  Calvert  's  Entire Butt  wafted away from his longing Eyes The Bard after this is to be ducked in a Well and then tossed dry in a Blanket while Mother  Dulness  enjoys the sprightly Vein of Mirth happy to see her Orders so faithfully executed In short the unhappy Poets are to undergo every Indignity that human Wit can invent and in Contrast to this Harlequin is to riot in Luxury the Spring is to pour fourth her freshest Verdure to charm his Eye Summer to ripen the various Fruits upon the loaded Boughs in order to regale his Palate Autumn must administer the circling Glass and Winter expand the frozen Surface of the Waters for him to skate with all his Dignity in Sight of the astonished Audience  Though this Plan appeared highly romantic to me at first Sight I could not help telling the Gentleman that I made no doubt but he would find his Account in it I told him that the surest Way to rise in the World was to gratify the Follies of the People and therefore commended this Scheme which I am convinced cannot fail of Success I just then hinted that if he could contrive to be less violent in his Studies I should take it as a Favour and after assuring him of my sincere Wishes for all the Encouragement his Project deserves I took my leave and am at present tolerably quiet in my Study not having above

inimitable Strain of Poetry which run through it I frequently read it with the most transporting Pleasure and after finishing it I cannot but look down very much upon the degenerate State of Poetry among the Moderns For the strong nervous Thought and natural Expression they have substituted pretty Conceit quaint Phrases Turns Strokes and I know not what tending to a general Depravity of Taste among us Filled with these Thoughts I lately retired to rest when  Queen Mab  immediately appeared to me and from the Mixture of Ideas fluctuating in my Mind she dressed up the following Scene to my Imagination  I thought she informed me that the intellectual Regions are divided into Districts similar to those of the Netherworld so admirably described by the Poet I then fansied that she commanded me to set out on a Journey through the Head of a modern Writer which I instantly agreed to and the Goddess accordingly took me in her Chariot In a short Time we arrived at the Apartment where the Bard sat  sicklied o'er with the pale Cast of Thought  At my first Approach towards the intellectual Regions a terrible Effluvium "proceeding" as  Shakespear  has it "from the Heatoppressed Brain" struck my Senses but I was soon diverted from that uneasy Sensation by a Personage who offered to be my Guide From a conscious Simper a careless Disposition of his Person and the Tenor of his Discourse I knew him to be VANITY and accepted the Compliment Our Way was through a thick Skull of which we at once took Possession and plunged into the Abyss  At our first Entrance a confused Noise assailed our Ears and we were instantly beset by a Number of Phantoms placed around the Portal The God  Somnus  lay stretched at full Length diffusing round him lethargic Vapours and stupid Insensibility a Group of wild  Dreams  and  Reveries  hovered over him and at a small Distance flowed the River of  animal Spirits  dull slow and lazy Numbers were gathered round the Banks begging a Passage into this gloomy World but the  Charon  of the Place a torpid decrepid Fellow known there by the Name of PERCEPTION gave a few of them a tardy Admittance and to the greater Part he was entirely deaf Among those whom he rejected I perceived a Train which I took for the nine  Muses  but was informed they never had attempted to pass that Way and upon a nearer View I found they were the amiable Band of  moral Virtues  who were highly desirous of gaining Admittance which was refused them with the  Addition of as much Insolence in the Denial as if they had been suing at a great Man's Door They gave me to understand that it is now become fashionable to discard them every where at which I could not help expressing great Uneasiness and I then advanced towards the Boatman PERCEPTION who with the Help of his Spectacles at Length descried me and received me into his Care  The River had a great many Turnings and Windings for  ductile Dullness new Maeanders takes  but after some Trouble we at Length reached the opposite Bank An uncultivated Tract lay before us dreary dark and gloomy no Ray of Light to break through the Mist impenetrable Obscurity involved the Scene and Vapours rolling over Vapours made every Thing an universal Blot I pursued my Journey with all possible Expedition and arrived at the  Repository of Ideas  as it is here called the Key of which was kept by MEMORY As I supposed this to be a Storehouse of universal Knowledge I begged to be favoured with a View of the several Acquisitions he had made I desired he would produce some  occult Qualities  of which I had no Manner of Notion and I called for several of the  metaphysical Train  too tedious to enumerate in  Divinity  I remembered several Things of which I never could attain a clear Conception and I have not Arithmetic enough to recount the Multitude of the  Mathematical  Species which I wanted the Debates which I have heard in  WestminsterHall  gave me occasion to enquire for many of the legal Band and I was curious after an infinite Multitude of the  Parnassian Tribe  mentioned in a pompous Stile in several modern Poets I longed to see an  envenomed Shaft taking its fatal Aim wind wafting Prayers on rosy Wings to Heaven  c I begged a Sight of  Colley Cibber  's old Friend BATTLE ARRAY and the many other Poetic Beings which he and others of his  Brethren of the Quill had created but all to no Purpose  The next Place we came to was the  Lugentes Campi  or the mournful Fields sacred to  Venus  I met with nothing here but  Cupid  's Darts consuming Fires and all the modern Train of Love's Artillery As I was sufficiently acquainted with these from a constant and unwearied Perusal of our modern Tragedies and other poetical Productions I hastened to the Seat where JUDGMENT presided  Judgment seldom made any Decisions of his own but was biassed in all his Decrees by several that surrounded him with so much Authority that I supposed they were in the Commission The Chief of these was PRIDE with a lofty Air and supercilious Brow which called to my Mind the excellent Remark in the Essay on Criticism  Of all the Causes which conspire to blind  Man's erring Judgment and misguide his Mind  Which the weak Head with surest Biass rules  Is  Pride  the neverfailing Vice of Fools  POPE  Next in Place was ILLNATURE callous and hardened to every gentle Sensation of Humanity and quite a Stranger to that Delicacy of elegant Minds which beholds the Merit of another with Pleasure but on the contrary every Thing shining with the smallest Degree of Lustre is the Object of his Aversion

Thing being ready to engage on either Side in Politicks to abuse a worthy Character in Satire or exalt a base one in dedicatory Panegyric  From these Principles I could easily imagine to myself what Kind of Opinions were likely to arise and therefore  hastened towards  Elysium  In my Way I perceived a desolate Tract which may be called the Region of Tortures Here I saw  Grief Despair Envy Revenge  and all the agonizing Cares that made this Place worse than what the Poets fable of their  Tartarus  In one Part was to be seen  Ambition  falling back like the Stone of  Sisyphus  in another Place  Hunger  was tantalized with the Hopes of a Supper but the worst of Fiends cruel  Want  forbids the Touch Here stood a Pillory with  Defamation  nailed to it by the Ears there a Blanket stretched out

Time admonished by my Guide that we were arrived at the Seat of Happiness Here we found  Invention  happy in a Review of all his airy Beings that were fluttering round him in a variegated Dress pressing and crowding upon each other as if to force a Passage into open Day I stood for a Time wondering at this mighty Bustle and then enquired what might be the Cause of it To which INVENTION  that bright Band which you behold so eagerly gathering about the Gates of Life are the chosen Few to whom  Apollo  has appointed a new Birth into the World and they are now impatiently waiting till proper

Repository of Ideas in the Care of MEMORY till in the various Course of human Contingencies they are again called forth and by my Skill arranged in proper Order for their Appearance among the Sons of Men  Thus having said he led me round the whole Extent of  Elysium  gave me a compleat View of all his intellectual Train and at Length dismissed me through the Ivory Gate to breath the vital Air to

these few Years a total Revolution and that Love is entirely banished from every Bosom The Men no longer mind how a Lady looks but how she plays instead of observing the Delicacy of her Shape the Turn

CensorialEnquiry  have been more numerous these last Sessions than happened to be the Case heretofore and as it is Matter of Moment that all the Transgressions which are there cognizable should as much as possible be obviated I shall devote the entire Papers of this and the ensuing  Saturday  to an Account of the several Hearings that have passed there this Week  The Proceedings of the Court of  CensorialEnquiry  on the Commission of  OYER  and  TERMINER  and general Goal Delivery held for the Cities of  London  and Westminster  About Nine o'Clock the Judges took their Seats and the Jury consisting of the following Persons were sworn and impannelled  Thomas Thimble  an EMINENT  Haberdasher of Smallware  John Rhubarb  an EMINENT  Apothecary  William Buckram  an EMINENT  Taylor  Joseph Bauble  an EMINENT  Toyman  Abel Drugger  an EMINENT  Tobacconist  John Candlewick  an EMINENT  allow chandler  Jeremiah Prim  an EMINENT  Mercer  Timothy Buck  an EMINENT  Breechesmaker  Joseph Instep  an EMINENT  Shoemaker  Robert Frizzle  an EMINENT  PerukeMaker  David Elzevir  an EMINENT  Bookseller  Isaac Birmingham  an EMINENT  HardwareMan  Jack Oakstick  was indicted for that he on  Saturday  Night the th of  February  went into the Middle Gallery  at  DruryLane  Playhouse and from thence one Apple Value a Farthing on the Stage did fling to the great Annoyance of the Actors and Disturbance of the Company The Fact was proved by two undeniable Evidences who being interrogated whether they had not the Freedom of the House severally answered that they had not and added that they did not even go in with an Order and that their only Motive for appearing on the Occasion was to bring to condign Punishment an Offender against the Respect and good Manners due to a public Assembly Whereupon the Prisoner being asked by the Court what he had to say for himself made Answer that he was drunk and as he hoped to be saved it was nothing but an innocent Frolick GUILTY upon which he was ordered to wait upon the Managers of the abovementioned Theatre to ask their Pardon for his Misbehaviour and he was sentenced to drink but a Pint of Wine after his Dinner for the future  Sir  Peter Jessamy  was indicted for standing between the Scenes in such a Manner as to hurt the most pathetic Situations of the Drama GUILTY but it appearing to the Court that it was not done with Malice prepense but only with intent to display his Cloaths to the Ladies he was dismissed without any other Punishment than a severe Reprimand and an Order that he should not be admitted behind the Scenes again without giving Security for his good Behaviour of which Mr  Varney  and Mr  Crudge  are to take proper Notice  Elizabeth  the Wife of  John Gayless  Esq  was indicted for that she not having the Love of her Husband before her Eyes hath for the Space of three Years past obstinately willfully and urged on by the Instigation of a certain Fury called GAMING addicted all her Attention to Cards to the great pecuniary Detriment of her Husband and the utter Extinction of all domestic Happiness  c  The Cause was opened by Counsellor  Manly  who urged in a long Harangue that it is an absolute Apostacy from all that can be counted elegant in the fair Sex to spend a Life over a Pack of Cards that such a Conduct can only serve to spoil their Complexions disturb their Tempers suppress the natural Affections which alone can create conjugal Felicity that it must inevitably put to flight the  Loves  and  Graces  which would otherwise hover round them and in their stead surround them with a Band of  Harpies  such as  Suspicion Mistrust Vexation Disappointment  c and that in short it must at last bring on such an Insensibility as to render a Woman capable of venturing a Daughter's Portion upon the turning up of a Die and oblige her to surrender her lovely Person in Case of Nonpayment upon an  Habeas Corpus  from the Court of  Venus  After this  Betty Minnikin  Chambermaid to the Prisoner was examined and she deposed as how her Mistress never went to Bed till Four or Five in the Morning and that she had often heard her say she actually thought the King of Clubs a much handsomer Man than her Husband  Cross Examined  Pray MistressRemember you're upon your OathHave you no Intrigue with your Master  Betty Minnikin  I'd have you to know Sirthat I scorn your WordsI've nothing to do with Fellows though to be sure in Tears he does use me barbarously and has taken no notice ever since he had his wicked Will of me  James Ditto Mercer  was sworn and deposed that he had served the Lady ever since her Marriage and that he knew no more of the Colour of her Money than of the real Colour of her Face though he was informed by her Husband and he verily believed the same to be true that she had been supplied occasionally with Money to discharge all her Bills  The Defence  The  Prisoner's Council  proved to the Court that their Client always preserved her Virtue and that no Instance of Infidelity to the MarriageBed could be charged against her even though she had been tempted by Lord  Trumpabout  who offered to remit a considerable gaming Debt for so small a Consideration as cuckolding her Husband and upon this they rested their Defence  To this it was replied by the Council for the Prosecution that it is not enough for a Woman to preserve her Virtue if she is insensible to Shame in every other Point agreeably to the  Statute th Young  Some modern Ladies think one Crime is all  Can Women then no Way but backwards fall  Lord  Townley  's Case was also cited by which it appeared a Matter of Indifference whether a Man be cuckolded by a  black Ace  or a powdered Beau Whereupon the Jury without withdrawing brought in their Verdict GUILTY and the Prisoner was ordered into the close Custody of her Husband to be by him carried into the Country for twelve Months there to read the  Spectator Tatler  and  Guardian  and never suffered to revisit  London  without proper Security for her good Behaviour  John Cockney  was indicted at the Suit of Mrs  Seesaw  for that he as a Servant to the said Mrs  Seesaw  behaved ill in his Place by several Misdemeanors such as not answering when called nor shutting the RoomDoor after him and when bid doing it in such a Manner as to shake the whole House  c  The Fact being proved the Prisoner was asked what he had to say in Mitigation of his Offence to which he replied  I does not want to live with the LadyI have often bid her discharge meShe keeps but seven CardTablesand what can a poor Servant do if he gets no more Vails nor thatIt is not the Pay of a Country CurateLord bless her she may get  some raw Boy to live with her but it won't do for me  Upon this the Jury declared him GUILTY and the Court directed Mrs  Seesaw  to discharge him without a Character giving her at the same Time an Hint to keep fewer Card Tables for the future  William Dactyle  was indicted for that he hath frequently been during the Winter Season at the  Bedford  Coffeehouse and then and there for a Dish of Coffee did call or for  red Tea  or  Capillaire  as his Fancy directed and did afterwards steal out of the BackDoor without paying for the same to the Prejudice of the House  c  Charles Price sworn  The Prisoner at the Par was at our House on  Suntay  Evening last ant hur gife hurself fery grate Airs as

I know Mr  Dactyle  perfectly well we both lay together upon a Flockbed in  Fleetstreet  when we translated  Juvenal  's Satyrs he was always in  a strong Glow when our Author declaimed against Vice and I did not think him capable of such an Action  John Rubric  I am a Bookseller I employed the Prisoner to write me an Account of lamentable Accidents I advanced him the whole Money being Fifteen Shillings and Six pence and he behaved very honestly  Court  What is his general Character  Rubric  A very pretty VersifyerI never heard an ill Thing of him before this  Guilty  d  NUMB  GRAY'sINN

not having the Fear of this Court before his Eyes but falsely vainly and inconsiderately tricked deluded and jilted several of his Majesty's most amiable Subjects and urged on by the Instigation of a most extraordinary Selfconceit hath continued for a long Time in this Practice to the great Disappointment of several young Ladies  c  Clerk of the Arraigns  John Vainlove  hold up your HandHow will you be tried  Prisoner  By this Court and my Country  Upon which the  Attorney General  of the Court opened the Cause in a long Speech setting forth that such Behaviour argues a depraved Mind insensible to Truth and wantonly derighting in giving Uneasiness to the  Fair Sex by making many of them imagine he had honourable Intentions when at the same Time he only meant in the End to break off to their Disappointment and Confusion  Miss  Saffron  sworn on her Pocket Looking Glass  I met the Prisoner at the Bar at  Enfield  Assembly where I danced with him till Two in the Morning he squeezed my Hand several Times called me his Angel and "I protest Miss  Saffron  " says he  you have the finest Neck in the World  I was so far misled by this Speech that I have ever since gone without an Handkerchief he visited me next Morning and gave me strong Reasons to expect Proposals for Marriage But instead of that I have been the  Laughingstock  of all my Acquaintances ever since for shewing the Yellowness of my Skin and I never saw the Prisoner since till now  Miss  Threadneedle  sworn on a Billedoux  I danced with the Prisoner at  Hamstead  Assembly I was at that Time upon a Treaty of Marriage with my Father's Prentice which I broke off on his Account and I have since rejected many very eligible Offers encouraged by the Prisoner's Promises in Consequence of which I bought me a new Gown at  Carr Ibson  's and  Bigg  's and now I find I'm not likely to be a bit the better for it  Widow  Liquorish  sworn on a small Box of Carmine  I had not been spoke to for several Years till I met the Prisoner at a Rout we played in the same Sett and he paid me so many Compliments and lost his Money with so much good Humour that I was sure he was in Love with me I had five CardTables at my Lodging since when the Prisoner promised to be one of our Party but I never saw him since till I heard he was taken up I am sure that is he I can swear to the Man  Prisoner's Defence  May it please this Honourable Court I am a Beau and in order to support that Character I thought it would not be amiss to have a few Treaties of Marriage depending though at the same Time I protest I have no Attachment to any one breathing except myself  Upon this the Prisoner rested his Cause and the Jury without retiring brought in their  Verdict a Male Jilt  and the Court adjudged upon the Statute of  Isaac Bickerstaff  that no Lady whatever should admit the Addresses of  John Vainlove  Esq  unless he could produce a Character from the Lady he last served testifying that  he behaved well in her Service  Lady  TittleTattle  was indicted for that she went frequently to one or other of the two Theatres and there placing herself in a SideBox as near the Stage as possible talked louder than the Actors even though a  Garrick  or a  Barry  a  Cibber  or a  Pritchard  were Principal in the Scene The Prisoner instead of denying the Fact insisted upon her Right to behave in that Manner alledging it was what she always did at Church and truly she could never be made to hold her Tongue in her Life Verdict GUILTY upon which the Court was going to pass Sentence that she should lose her Tongue but one of the Judges recollecting an Instance in  Ovid  where the remaining Roots and Fibres retain their Activity  Radix micat ultima linguae  objected to the Punishment insisting upon it that it would not cure the Disease and though no articulate Accents could be produced  nec vox nec verba sequuntur  yet such Sounds might issue as would still continue to annoy the Company she was therefore required to give Bail for her good Behaviour for the future which she found difficult to do as her Husband for Reasons best known to himself refused to be one at length Mr  Hoyle  became her Security he being in Possession of the only Charm which can for a while stop the female Tongue  Bob Riot  was indicted for that he in a full Gallery at  DruryLane  Playhouse cried out Fire The Fact being incontestibly proved but no one being able positively to swear to the Man the strongest Evidence amounting to no more than I believe it is he and I think it is the same Voice he was acquitted  William Quibble  was indicted for picking a Gentleman's Pocket of a Silk Handkerchief Value Three Shillings The Prosecutor deposed that he went into the  Bedford  CoffeeHouse and stood for some Time next to the Prisoner at the Bar and when he wanted his Pocket Handkerchief could not find it  Crose Examined  Pray Sir was you at the Play that Night  Answer  I was  Q  And did not you pass through the Mob that is generally gathered in the Piazza  Answer  I did  Q  Then might you not lose your Handkerchief thereWhat Reason have you for charging the Prisoner at the Bar  Answer  Because he made a Pun and every Body knows that a Man that will pun will also pick a Pocket  Acquitted of the  Hankerchief  but detained upon an Indictment for the  Pun  Joseph Indolent  was indicted for that he murdered all his Time every Evening at the  Bedford  CoffeeHouse It was plainly proved to the Court that the Prisoner generally took his Seat among the rest of the  Loungers  at the Middle Fire and there past all his Hours in dozing yawning telling long Stories listening to long Stories enquiring of every one that comes in have you been at  DruryLane  to Night"Yes"Great House I suppose"very great House'ay as usualhave you been at  Covent Garden  "I looked in"very thin I hear"about five People in the Boxes and  "half a Pit"ay as usual  c  Upon which the Jury without going out of Court brought in their Verdict WILFUL MURDER but the Prisoner seeming to have a very sensible Feeling of his Condition the Court in hopes he might by this be awakened into Reflection allowed him  Benefit of Clergy  which they assured him was the only Thing that could redeem him from Destruction and therefore they recommended to him to read four Hours every Day for the future  William Clumsy  was indicted for that he walked about the Room at the  Bedford  CoffeeHouse for near half an Hour every Evening and trod frequently upon Peoples Toes to the great Annoyance of Mrs  Michell  's Customers GUILTY upon which the Court ordered him to Mr  Hart  's Dancing Academy for grown Persons until the said Mr  Hart  shall think proper to trust him with the Use of his Limbs abroad  John Sceptic  was indicted for that he after reading the posthumous Works of the late Lord  Bolingbroke  did embrace the absurd Doctrine of  Scepticism  and is now an absolute Unbeliever in the most obvious Truths  Miss  Sweetlips sworn  I was going through  TavistockStreet  this was about Seven o Clock at Nightand I met the Prisoner at the Bar who led me to a Lamp and after looking me full in the Face kissed me with great Eagerness He then told me that I was a pretty Apparitionupon which I could not help saying I was as good Flesh and Blood as himselfhe then repeated the Word Apparition and brushed away  Abraham Buckram  I made Cloaths for the Prisoner at the Bar for many Years past and he never disputed Payment till I carried in my Bill the other Morningbeing obliged to make up a Sumand he told me they were only  imaginary Cloaths and that I must prove the Reality of Matter of which he said he doubted the Existence  Mary Spinster  I am a maiden Lady I let Lodgings in St  Martin  's  Lane  the Prisoner has had an Apartment in my House for nine Months and when I ask him for some Money he says he owes for no Lodging and that all is  Elysium  round him  Prisoner's Defence  I doubt the real Existence of every Thing I meet As for Instance I have often heard of  Honour  and  Honesty  and  Patriotism  and  Friendship  and I am sure there is no such Thing in Reality I therefore demur to the Jurisdiction of the Court because I doubt the Reality of it and of all these Appearances about me Verdict  guilty of wilful Scepticism  whereupon the Court adjudged the said posthumous Works of  Lord Bolingbroke  to be forfeited as a  Deodand  and allowed him  Benefit of Clergy  Copia Vera  CHARLES RANGER  The Court broke up till next Sessions  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday March    Ut omnis  Votivâ veluti pateat

Romans  and this Precept we find inculcated by each of them in Terms that come home to every Man's Breast Among the Moderns my Lord  Shastsbury  has more particularly enforced the Doctrine to the Race of Writers and has recommended this intuitive Intercourse to every Author by desiring him frequently to enter into a  Soliloquy  with himself by which Means he will probably stand informed whether he can boast that intellectual Harmony which is requisite for the Formation of a tasteful Mind whether he is sufficiently acquainted with the Progress of the human Understanding the secret Movements of the Heart the Grace of Character the Beauty of Virtue and all those elegant Refinements of Thinking without which it is impossible to reach any Degree of Excellence in a Composition We likewise find that  Boileau  the famous  French  Satyrist was aware of the Necessity of this spiritual Retreat if I may be allowed to call it so and accordingly he has entered into a Review of himself in his ninth Satire which is certainly as pleasant a Piece of Humour and Raillery as ever was produced by any Writer antient or modern The Poet addresses himself to his own Mind by saying  that he wants to hold a little private Conversation with that internal Agent whom he had too long encouraged in Whims and Frolicks by an indolent Indulgence and now that his Patience is provoked to the utmost he will once for all tell him his own  Cest à vous mon Esprit à qui je veux parler  Vous avez des defauts que je ne puis celer  Assez trop longtemps ma lache complaisance  De vos jeux criminels a nourri l'insolence  Mais puisque vous poussez ma patience à bout  Une fois en ma vie il fant vous dire tout  In Conformity to the Injunction of the noble Writer and in Imitation of the sensible and polite Satyrist just quoted I have lately divided myself into two Persons in order to examine my inward Frame the Motives of my Actions the secret Spring of my Writings and to attain a more int mate Knowledge of my several Foibles my various Humours and the whimsical Vicissitudes of my Passions The Dialogue was carried on with great Warmth on both Sides as if there was really an intestine War

private Conserence with you Pray what could put it into your Head to make me turn Writer  Soul  How can you ask me such a Question You know my original Motive was to make as much waste Paper as the Rest of the Scribblers of the Age The Town began early to take Notice of my Undertaking and so the Amusement of it and a Principle of Gratitude induced me to persevere  Ranger  Let me tell you that you are a busy pragmatical intermeddling foolish Kind of a Being and when once you take a Fancy into your Head there is no such Thing as reasoning with you Did not I represent to you that Writing is a State of Warfare upon Earth and that the most candid and unassuming Expression will not secure a Man from secret poisoned Arrows while Malice and Envy and Illnature are such predominant Vices in Mankind  Soul  True but did not I always answer you that the wise and good will not become Tools to a Party and that they will never condescend to do the dirty Work of Calumny and Detraction A public Writer who is attended with a Degree of Success must expect to be attacked by Scribblers and let me tell you Mr  Ranger  you are an errant Blockhead if you ever suffer any of them to ruffle your

unavoidably arise against a known Writer But you must go and consult with a few of your Friends before the Work was commenced and what was the Consequence Did they assist you They only whispered it about and in a Month's Time you were known every where I often told you you are of too open a Temper Observe how some People lock up their Minds in Company Snug's the Word not a Syllable from their

Don't be quite so precipitate and let us take Time to plan to alter to touch and retouch and I'll stake my Immortality that we go on with more Safety and Ease Or if you must take the Opinion of People ask it of those only who have both Inclination and Capacity to serve you Learn to distinguish between Men  Ranger  I have no sinister Intentions myself and I never suspect any Body else of harbouring ill Designs But do you intend to persevere in this Task  Soul  Most certainly while the Public continues favourable  Ranger  Gad its pleasant enough to see you assume the Air of a Dictator and take upon you to reform Men and Manners to correct vitiated Taste to offer your Criticisms on fine Writings give Rules for Style reprobate a Profusion of Metaphors and flowery Epithets and ridicule the Foibles of Mankind I tell you we are too young for the Task do you feel within you the Emotions of a sublime Spirit Have your pervading Eyes searched every Subject to the Bottom Had not  you better employ yourself in reading the best Authors ancient and modern than spinning out from yourself Has  Apollo  opened to you the Secrets of  Parnassus  And then don't I know your Method of Proceeding Don't you some Times defer Things to the last Day and don't you let Inaccuracies escape from you which a little Time would inform you want Correction  Soul  There I allow you hit me but the Nature of periodical Writings must admit some slight Inadvertencies The Dissipations of Pleasure and a thousand other Avocations must inevitably disconcert a Person at Times and then one is not always in the same Humour But why don't you take care to correct the Press When you should be attending to that necessary Trouble you are often running about the Town which is no Excuse to the Reader For my Part I flatter myself that the best Judges will allow for an youthful Enterprize and in a more advanced Period and at more Leisure I possibly may repay them for their present Indulgence  Ranger  I see you will have your own Way However I must tell you what I hear of you It is remarked that you are too fond of mentioning Players 'Sdeath if you pretend to any Genius can't you have more Pleasure in reading  Shakestear  than in hearing anyof them repeat from him  Soul  Why you are sensible that my Paper is calculated for a Multiplicity of Readers some like one Thing some another there is no pleasing all at once Besides there is a Performer on the Stage who has upon many Occasions surprized me with new Lights in Passages that were before obscure and who has often had an irresistible Power over my Passions  Ranger  Still harping on your favourite  Garrick  but what Occasion is there for it Every Body knows he is an universal Genius  Soul  Would you have me change my Style and say that there are others equal to him  Ranger  No that would be taken for Raillery they'd think you were laughing at them But to cut the Matter short this Itch of Scribbling is a dangerous Thing You'll never be cured of it till the Critics effectually damn you which between you and I  Soul  Hush blabbing again Hold your Peace Man  Ranger  Well well I will for Faith I am heartily tired of the Controversy

Apotheosis of an exalted Character Its Excellence consisted not in the due Government of the Passions but in extirpating them totally from the human Heart by which means the Seat of feeling and Source of every exquisite Pleasure as well as tender Pain was rendered quite callous and insensible and suffered to move only with the Flux and Reflux of the Blood without being agitated with any Kind of Sensation whatever Our excellent Poet has given us a very picturesque Description of this notable System of Philosophy  In lazy Apathy let Stoics boast  Their Virtue fix'd 'tis fix'd as in a Frost  Contracted all retiring to the Breast  But Strength of Mind is Exercise not Rest  How an absolute Repugnance to the Laws of Nature and the Want of those Feelings which are the best Ingredients in our Composition can in any Way constitute an exalted Character I am at a loss to determine  Vita secundum Naturam  a Life conformable to the Laws of Nature is  Tully  's Definition of a moral as well as an happy State Certain it is all Elegance of Mind  and Relish for Virtue must arise from those Sensations which Nature has implanted in us as Excitements to Action and Inlets for due Degrees of Pleasure and Pain Without these our most refined Gratifications must suffer a considerable Abatement the pleasing Anxieties of virtuous Friendship the grateful Solicitude of Love the melancholy Luxury of tender Compassion and the Delights which we derive from a wellwrought Scene of Distress in an affecting Tragedy must all lose their Influence and the Mind sink into a dull State of Insensibility For my Part I have always had a sovereign Contempt for the unfeeling pedantic Wisdom of those unnatural Followers of a brutal Philosophy nor could I ever admire their ridiculous Ostentation of a towering Superiority of Soul That this is also the Sense of the greater Part of Mankind is very visible from that soporific Awe with which they behold Personages of this Cast when interwoven into the Drama while Characters of a mixed Nature in whom the Passions are in a beautiful Struggle between Virtue and Vice are always sure to seize the Affections of an Audience and interest every Heart in the Fortunes of the Hero thus represented  Virgil  has transmitted to us a Picture of the Completion of that Happiness which was the exalted Boast of the Stoics In the Words of my Motto he tells us that the Person whom he describes in the Possession of true Felicity is never touched with popular Esteem or the dazling Splendor of the regal State that Difference between Brothers Conspiracies against his Country or the Decline of the Constitution never disturb his Breast nor is he ever made uneasy by Compassion for the Indigent or Envy towards the great This is a Character totally different from the amiable Sketch by his Brother Poet of the Man who considers the Relations in which he stands to Society and feels for all Mankind The negative Enjoyments above described can result  from nothing but an absolute Indifference to our FellowCreatures and is so far from being commendable that in my Opinion it is equalled by every Debauchee in Town I was lately in Company with one of this Class who appeared to me to be a very great Proficient in the Stoic Philosophy and to have carried into his Practice every Branch of the foregoing System and as a further Instance of the Excellence of the Stoic School I shall here present my Readers with a Character of a modern Stoic Philosopher  Jack Wildair  is possessed of a Fortune which might enable him to live with Splendor or to prosecute any Enterprize in the Service of his Country he has also the Advantages of Birth to render him reputable in the Eye of the World but like a true Philosopher he never placed any Value upon these happy Circumstances With a noble Contempt for Riches he squanders away his Substance in a Manner which shews him to be above the mean Ambition of popular Applause and instend of being arrogantly elated with the Thoughts of his high Birth he has been known to associate with the lowest of Mankind so superior is he to those little Sensations of Pride which might be apt to play about the Heart of a Man of worldly Vanity Contented in his own Mind he never condescended to court the Favour of his Countrymen at an Election for Member of Parliament The  populi Fasces  have never had any Attraction for  Jack Wildair  and so little is he touched with the Splendor of Majesty that he does not care for any King in  Europe  While all our Politicians have made the two  Brothers  the constant Object of their Attention he is little sollicitous whether there be a Difference between them or not The Fortifications of  Dunkirk  the Depredations of the  Spaniards  in the  WestIndies  upon our Merchantmen the Election of the King of the  Romans  the Equipment of  French  Fleets and all the other Points of Moment which engross the Thoughts  of our present Race of Patriots never once discomposed the Serenity of his Mind Liberty and Property are to him unideal Sounds and if  Magna Charta  were burned by the common Hangman it would not occasion the least Gloom in our Hero's Soul He can also behold the Distresses of the Indigent the corroding Anxieties of Poverty most Stoic like without a single Sigh  Nec doluit miserans inopem  and so far from being envious of another's Superiority in Life while he is easy himself he never was yet known to compare his own Situation with any Man above him though he has now and then condescended to cast a Look beneath him with no small Degree of Satisfaction  Nor does the Firmness of  Wildair  's Mind rest here He can visit all the Brothels in this Metropolis without feeling the least Degree of Uneasiness He can behold undisturbed by any of those tender Touches which might agitate weaker Breasts an elegant Form and the most beautiful Set of Features falling a Prey to  Insamy Diseases  and  Prostitution  and as the antient Worthies thought it a noble Atchievement totally to forget the Man in order to raise their philosophic Fame to an higher Degree of Eminence so our modern Stoic can fat press the natural Affections and in the Rake he can also forget the Man  Jack Wildair  is a very  Roman  in that Point he is an excellent Practitioner of  Horace  's golden Rule to admire nothing and if confined to the Ped of Sickness to repair the Waste made by Folly and Intemperance he is sure to spend his Time in a Series of moral Reflections He wisely observes that all Pleasure is fugitive that the Reversion of Pain falls to every Man's Lot and that the Condition of human Life is frail and uncertain When his Health returns he indulges in all the Sallies of his wild Imagination to shew that like  Aristippus  he can adapt himself to every Situation In short  Jack Wildair  has upon all Occasions a true Philosophical Turn and indeed in all Occurrences  of Life every Thing is sure to suggest to him those Reflections which are most conducive to secure his own Happiness to prevent the ruffled State arising from conflicting Passions to preserve the even Tenor of his Thoughts to reconcile him to himself and enable him to possess his Soul in Ease Tranquility and Chearfulness  This Character of a modern Town Philosopher contains in my Opinion all the Branches of the much boasted stoic System and all the leading Principles of Happiness which it inculcates are carried by our modern Academic to a much greater Height of Wisdom and Felicity than they ever were by the most rigid Follower of the stoic Academy in so much as the modern Hero grafts his Happiness on the Passions which he plays against one another and in that Sense may be said to live  secundum naturam  whereas the antient Stoic endeavoured to subvert the very Elements of our being and among that Sect he was the most exalted Worthy who was the most divested of Humanity  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  March    SINCE the Profession of  Buckism  is

Migravit ab Aure Voluptas  Omnis ad incertos Ocuios Gaudia vana  HOR  _THE pantomime Poet from whom I some Time ago felt a little Interruption in my Studies has remained in the Chambers over my Head ever since but the Fervour of his Enthusiasm being a good deal abated he has proved a very peaceable and quiet Neighbour For though he cannot entirely refrain from his peripatetic Lucubrations he is however careful to conduct them with a Degree of Temperance and he now proves a Companion of very singular and entertaining Oddities The other Morning he paid me a Visit and was contented in the Beginning to converse with me upon common and ordinary Topics upon which he discoursed with sufficient Sedateness At length he took occasion to introduce the Subject which was the Cause of his Visit and I observed that the Moment he touched upon his favourite Scheme of Thinking he betrayed several whimsical Gestures and an extraordinary Manner of Address  Sir says he I have taken the Liberty to intrude upon you this Morning in order to consult you in Relation to a Work which I have had in Hand for some Time past and which I think cannot fail to be of public Utility as it is one of the Desiderata in Literature and a Species of Criticism likely to be productive of singular Advantages to the learned World The Thing I mean Sir is THE ART OF PANTOMIME which I propose to publish by Subscription not noubting but I shall meet with suitable  Encouragement to prosecute so arduous a Task and if Mr  Ranger  will be kind enough to favour me with his Recommendation I shall for the future esteem him as a generous Promoter of the polite Arts  In order to be able to comply with my Friend's Request and to serve him as effectually as my small Abilities will permit me I desired him to explain to me at large the Plan of his Undertaking and the whole Method which he had chalked out to himself for so noble a Work Upon which I was informed that he intends to execute his Design in Imitation of  Aristotle  's  Art of Poetry  divided into as many Sections and as near as the Nature of the Subject will admit comprized under the same Heads His first Chapter is to set out with an Account of the imitative Arts in which Pantomime will be proved to be superior to all the Rest having the greatest Variety of Gesticulation and the most expressive Significance in all its Attitudes and Actions In the next Section it will appear what Sort of Persons and Things are proper for Imitation and that the Pantomime Poet must either attach himself to the Representation of Personages above the ordinary Race of human Nature such as Magicians Enchanters Genii Gods Imps and Monsters Devils Furies  c  or to the Exhibition of Characters to be met with in the ordinary Occurrences of Life such as we find introduced in  Harlequin Ranger  Then follows a Dissertation upon the proper Manner of imitating and Enquiry into the Origin of Pantomime tracing it from the Time of  Herace  down to the glorious Time of Mahomet  Carathra  After this our Author proceeds to examine into the Nature of  Farces  and shows how they differ from the  Pantomime  He then enters more minutely into the Laws of  Pantomime  and gives an Account of it's several Parts Among these the Fable is first considered and it is allowed it may be either simple or implex He does  not totally reject the former but insists principally upon the Beauties of the complicated Plot such as  Harlequin Sorcerer  or the Loves of  Pluto  and  Proserpine Harlequin Fortunatus  being of the simple Kind consisting of one Action only impeded or accelerated by several Incidents all tending in a direct Line to the Completion of the Whole  The refined Beauties of the Art offer themselves next and our Author exhausts all his Erudition all his Rhetoric and all his whole Stock of Criticism to point out the Advantages arising to a Piece from a well conducted  Peripetia  which he defines in these Words  The pantomimical  Peripetia  consists in sudden Changes of Fortune arising from a Concatenation of Incidents highly improbable in their Nature  Then the  Agnitio  is displayed at large and proved to be the liveliest Beauty in this Species of the Drama it being a sudden Recollection in the Personages of the Piece when after a long Absence they recognize and know each other again As when  Harlequin  finds Access to his  Colombine  in a disguised Appearance she by some Token discovers her Lover and is happy in his Embrace  After having enforced these striking Particulars he delivers Rules for the Excitement of Terror Pity and the Marvellous The two former he mentions but slightly not thinking them essential in these Compositions but in the Marvellous he observes consists the utmost Effort of human Genius and then enumerates the various Means by which it is excited such as flying Mercurys RopeDancers Kicking Straws Children playing on the Flute Storms of Rain Thunder and Lightening  c  The next Division of the Work relates to the Manners of each Personage of the Drama in which he recommends a serious Attention to Character in order the more forcibly to unfold Men and Manners and the Customs the Intrigues the Flights and Descents of the  Gods with the whole History of the Heathen Mythology In this Part of the Work he expatiates at large upon the Use of Machinery and I make no Doubt will greatly excel the celebrated  Bossu  in this Part of the Performance Having the Interests of the Theatre greatly at Heart our Author proves that no Playhouse can long subsist without a good Set of Carpenters an expeditious Band of SceneDrawers excellent CandleSnuffers FireEaters TrapDoorMen Ostriches Monkeys Serpents and the whole animal World besides a Race of Beings never seen upon the Face of the Earth  The Sentiment comes into Consideration in the following Chapter The several Modes of the Mind are explained in an ample Manner and Directions given to the Performer to render himself perfectly acquainted with the Operation of all the Passions on the whole Frame of the Body and it is laid down as a Rule that he must be careful to mark the different Actions of Begging Commanding Threatning Interrogating Answering that he may be able to impress a lively Idea of each upon the Minds of his Spectators  The Sentiment being established the Diction claims our next Regard Under this Head the several pretty Pieces of Poetry introduced into  Pantomimes  are criticised and proper Rules prescribed for Writing these Kind of NonsenseVerses To the whole Work is annexed a particular Examen of  Harlequin Fortunatus  in order to give a Specimen of the great Utility and Truth of the foregoing Rules I shall therefore conclude this Paper with an Abstract from this Part of the Work  There cannot says my Author be sound in any Pantomime Writer a better imagined Opening for the Drama than the first Incident in this Piece The Scene discovers a large Wood in which the poor forlorn Harlequin is wandering in a violent Storm of Rain Thunder and Lightening In a Fit of Desperation he throws  himself on the Ground and to heighten our Compassion poor Madam  Fortune  is introduced bemoaning her Condition in a very pathetic Strain of Poetry The amiable Character of  Fortunatus  is seen in his Readiness to assist the distressed and the Sequel conveys a fine Moral  viz  that Riches Riot and Debauchery are the most desirable Things in this World as the Piece ends with Harlequin's being in the full Enjoyment of all his Wishes The Farmer's Yard affords a pleasing Image of rural Happiness and the beautiful Incident of the Dog's biting the Clown conveys this Incident that a Dog's obeyed in Office and it serves further to enforce the Necessity of an Act of Parliament to lessen the Number of Dogs which overrun the Kingdom to the great Annoyance of his Majesty's loyal Subjects The frequent Remembrances between  Columbine  and her  Harlequin  make upon all Occasions an admirable  Agnitio  and the sudden Changes of their Fortunes form a very beautiful  Peripetia  Harlequin's Escape into the Oven his running up the Chimney and his Leap over the Gateway when his Enemies are in close Pursuit of him are all Touches of the highest Elevation and Genius and upon the whole we may say with Mr  Dennis  that this Piece is admirable for its fine Moralities its Universality and its Integrity  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  TheatreRoyal CoventGarden  April    ON  Monday  Evening last the Tragedy of  Othello  was performed here for the Benefit of Mr  Ryan Othello  by Mr  Barry  and  Iago  by

Question is mine and my Reason for proposing it is because I think we have Composers of our own who deserve the Encouragement of the Public  President  Do you chuse to speak SirYou Sir YouDoes any Gentleman on this Row chuse to speak Do you Sir  William Crosslegs a Taylor without Buttons to his Coat  Mr  President  I is for demolishing Operas because I be against all modern Harmony I believes

Persecution was  carried on in the very Bowels of this Land and a worse Persecution than what the Gentleman mentions who spoke lastthough he be methinks a  Frenchman  himself notwithstanding his Violence against  Frenchmen  and perhaps he is only come over for our Beef and Pudding but that's neither here nor thereI says Mr  President  when I think of Fires being lighted up in  Smithfield  and Men Women and Children consumed in the Flames when I think on this I can't sleep in my Bed I knew'd of thisQuestion a Week ago and I have spent all my Time in thinking of it and when I read in

considered the Question Mr  President  for this Week past as well as my Friend who spoke last and I fansy's I have come at the very  Soal  of it and I'll now lay my  All  before ye and as a Body may say you'll find I have taken right Measure of the Subject  President  Time SirMr  Profound  do you chuse to speak  Mr  Profound  Sir I have a Motion to make  Mr  Witwould  Sir you must at present speak to the Question  Mr  Profound  Sir do you know what I am going to say  Mr  Witwould  No Sir do you  President  Pray Gentlemen don't laughthe present Question must be militated before any other Question can be received  Mr  Profound  Mr  President  aI thinkI think aMr  President  that you have all been wrongheaded in this DebateI believe they have not read  Quintilian  and of Course have not correct Mindsa Mr  President  I never for my own Partlooked into the  Vitals  of the  dead  Languages but there is a  Gentleman who tells me what  Quintilian  says in the Beginning of a Chapter and then I can think with the Author if I hear but one Sentiment for I'll be dned if I have not more Imagination than I can dispose offIn the present Debate there is a  Trinity  of Circumstances

to read the Question  Question read  As to Operas Mr  President  I never was but at two in my born Days and the first of them I liked it as if Heaven and Earth was coming together but at the second I no more cared for it no no more nor an Oyster is like an Eggshell For my own Share on't I had rather hear  Ellinaroen  than all their Quivers and  Carolun  was a better Composer than any  Italian  of them all  President  Time Sir  Mr  Macflummery  What is it  President  Time Sir  Mr  Macslummery  Time What would you have one speak in  Time  like those sheFellows of Singers there  President  Pray Gentlemen don't laughpray be silent Gentlemenyour five Minutes are out Sir  Macsluummery  Is that all Give me that  Porter  there here's my Service to you and I'll tack a Sentiment to itHere's all honest Hearts and sound Bottoms  President  Pray Gentlemen don't laugh dobe silent GentlemenDoes any Gentleman there chuse to speakMr  Macpherson  it's with you  Mr  Macpherson  I do not know whether the Gentleman's rasoning be  reet  about Mr  Carolun  but this I cun say that one of  Ramsay  's Compositions set by the  Philharmonic  Society at  Dumferlin  would make muckle Entertainment and by fare exceed the squeaking of those Eunuchs who are in my Opinion a Disgrace to Society I remember Master  Deenis  in his Book has many Ideas on this Subject deleevered with muckle Oratory and I would rather at any Time see the Exhebeetion of the Dramatic Piece of the  Scotch  Ballad given in the  Haymarket  two Years elapsed since than have a dozen Operas exhebeeted for nothing  President  Time Sir  Mr  Macpherson  sits down and speaks the Highland Language which Mr  Macflummery  answers in  Irish  President  Pray Gentlemen be silent Gentlemen as to my Opinion on this Subject I has but little to offer and I hope that the Proposer of the Question will give us some Arguments against the Operas which will militate stronger than those which has been already offered Mr  Manly  it is now with you Sir  Mr  Manly  Sir I am against Operas for this capital Reason  viz  because most of them are composed by People ignorant of the first Principle of Composition which is  Counterpoint  or the Art of placing different Notes sounding together in true harmonic Order Musick Sir consists of  Melody  and  Harmony Melody  is the regular Progression of a single Part and  Harmony  of different Parts united Now the  Melody  of all the Songs in our late  Italian  Operas is extravagant and unnatural consequently unpleasing and sitter for Instruments than Voices Their Singers are constantly endeavouring to surprize by which Means their Songs are all Quirks and Divisions and the Performers are  sometimes squeaking like Cats at the Top of a House and sometimes growling like Dogs in a Cellar The Energy of the Words is totally neglected and the Passion is entirely lost and therefore I cannot help wondering that while we have  Handel Arne Boyce  and  Smith  c the  English  will lavish Sums upon a false and depraved Taste merely to be thought Judges of what they do not understand I shall finish Sir with asserting that an elegant  Drama  by a good Author and the Music composed by either of the Masters mentioned already might be a high and rational Entertainment it would certainly save an immense Sum to the Nation and would excite some new Genius's to study and excel all other Nations in manly sensible Compositions where the Sound would be an Echo to the Sense and the Passions would be agitated by the joint Power of Poetry and Harmony  President  Gentlemen it is now too late and so I wish you all a Goodnight  Adjourned  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday April    Mendici Mimi Balatrones hoc Genus omne  HOR  _THERE is not a Word in the whole Compass of the  English  Language more grosly abused than the Term  Friendship  which at present means no more than that Men eat together walk together game together und are grave and merry drunk and sober together without ever conceiving any real Regard for each others Happiness and Interest I believe every Day's Experience will point out many who are Dupes to this florid Outside  of Friendship In the Course of my Observation I have marked out a particular Character that falls more egregiously into this Error than the rest of Mankind The Character I mean is that of THE COMICAL FELLOW or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL or THE CURSED HIGH FELLOW or THE MAN OF INFINITE HUMOUR or THE GENIUS or by whatever Name for many Names will suit him you may please to distinguish the Person whom a cheerful Flow of Spirits and a quick Circulation of the Ideas that fall to his Share conspire to render an entertaining Companion  The COMICAL FELLOW is in high Request among all his Acquaintance and different Parties at the  Shakespear  the  BedfordArms  the  King'sArms  c are vying with each other to have him the Master of the Joke in their convivial Parties because he is without Doubt the finest Creature in the World to kill an Hour with the merry Droll has such Variety of Chat and such a deal of Humour in telling a Story But while this Son of Gaiety and Wit is thus happy in the Caresses of all the Lovers of Mirth this secret Misfortune attends him that he has not any where procured himself the least Degree of Esteem because it is too well known that he has not a single Virtue under the Sun that he would at any Time according to the common Saying rather lose his Friend than his Joke that no Obligation can bind him but that indiscriminately he lashes all alike and is constantly upon the look out for some Incident which by a Perversion of Circumstances or by a few Touches of Mimickry or some other adventitious Aid may be worked up into a Story for the Entertainment of the next Company he goes into On this Account THE AGREEABLE DEVIL is held in utter Contempt but the Vivacity of his Imagination will not afford him Leisure to attend to this his Vanity is fully gratified by the general Applause he meets with and he is constantly  exhausting his scanty Finances in keeping Company with a Set of People who are good humoured enough to be perpetually entertained with his Jokes  I will venture to affirm that few Evils are more epidemic than this Rage of being an HIGHFELLOW and I am apt to think that many of those Bankruptcies which fill the Columns of the  Gazette  are not entirely owing to Losses in Trade but to the pitiful Ambition of discovering a fine Vein of Humour When once the sober Cit becomes the Ringleader in Wit and frolick Festivity when once he has learned to  elevate and surprize  his Shop assumes a gloomy Aspect Bookkeeping is but a dull Employment unfit for Men of  ner Senfations and instantly his fervid Imagination conveys him to the  Gentleman and Porter  then he cracks each Joke over again and thrice he enjoys the Laugh and thrice repeats the Pun But in a little Time his Name is inserted in the  Gazette  with a WHEREAS his former Companions shake their Heads and are very sorry for it  he was a Wag a merry Man a COMICAL FELLOWbut Business is a serious Thing  Poor  Jack Spatter  He is at present the most remarkable of all THE AGREEABLE DEVILS I have ever known  Jack  does not want a Share of native Humour and he dresses up a Story at second hand with such additional Touches that a Man is frequently as much entertained as if he had never heard it before or if he himself had not told it to him the very Day besore For it is often the d'verting Rogues Way unwittingly to fasten with  something cursea High  upon the very Person who at first supplied him with the Subject And then THE GENIUS is such a MimickWell to be sure nothing can escape him A Cat a Dog a Monkey a Manager a  BurlettaGirl  a  Woodward  a  Garrick  all must undergo the Touches of his humouróus Imitation and mean while the Company Whores Waiters and all do so laugh and so shake their Side  that Life is quite flat and insipid without  Jack Spatter  But in this World where as  Moliere  says  on donne rien pour rien  where every Thing must be paid for it cannot but prove very expensive to be thus aspiring in Company But  Jack  's Vanity extends to Expence as well as Wit and Humour How many Shifts have I known him to make that he might display his Vivacity at the TavernA TurtleFeast was sometime since fixed at the  King  's  Arms  in  Cornhill  and  Spatter  was invited to make one "A Turtle Feast" says  Jack  very wellit can't be betterCitizens laugh heartily when their Bellies are fullI'll certainly go but how to pay my ReckoningThere's  Titlepage  the Booksellerhe likes a Touch of my Humourhe'll tip me two Guineas for an EpilogueI'll write him onelet me see what's here  Dryden  's  Miscellany  I'll transcribe one from this  No sooner said than done for  Jack  has quick Parts and away he sets out towards  Fleetstreet  meets his Friend  Humdrum  at  TempleBar  reads the Piece to him to shew what a COMICAL DEVIL he is  Humdrum  admires it  Jack  forgets that he stole it and admires it more touches Two Guineas from  Titlepage  and who but he at the TurtleFeast A  Masquerade  requires somewhat a larger Capital "Egad" say  Jack  I'll write a Pamphlet for that and touch Five Guineas  To work he falls and finishes his Piece in the Space of one Morning though it cost the Original Authors from whom he compiled it many nocturnal Vigils A Jant to  Tunbridge  in the Summer Season with some Lovers of Wit and Humour could not but be agreeable to Mr  Spatter  and so instantly he sets down and writes a Farce and because  Fielding  's  Coffechouse Politician  is not very likely to be acted again on either of our Stages what does the merry Wag do but he takes the Character gives it a new Name makes a little Alteration in the Scene where the  Politician  reads the NewsPapers and instantly  Genial Jacob and a warm third Day  as the Poet has it equips the GENIUS for  Tunbridge  Thus is the CURSED HIGH FELLOW the AMIABLE FRIPON perpetually spending the Income of his Brain and torturing his Invention in Endeavours to live with those who have Fortunes to supply their Expences and who do not entertain the least Symptom of Friendship towards their merry Companion What will become of him when he has played all his Tricks I tremble to think and as if his Misfortunes were now present I cannot help crying out  Alas poor  Yorick  I knew him a Fellow of infinite Jestwhere be your Gibes now Your Flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table on a roarQuite Chopfallen  But my Fancy has pictured this Scene of Distress so strongly to me that I could wish some Means could be devised to avert the impending Evil An Ingenious Gentleman whom I have the Pleasure of knowing proposed some Time since a Scheme for an HOSPITAL FOR DECAYED POLTS Suppose in Imitation of this laudable Design an Hospital were to be raised for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS For my Part I cannot but think the Plan should meet with general Encouragement and I will willingly give the Profits of this Paper N  o  towards carrying it into Execution Mr  Garrick  and Mr  Rich  will I dare say contribute on their Parts an annual Benefit towards this Charity the Objects of which may be admitted as follows  It being certified to us that the Bearer  AB  was an AGREEABLE DEVIL and entirely ruined himself by endeavouring to keep Company with Men of Fortune who countenanced him merely as their Jester you are hereby directed to admit the said unhappy pleasant Creature into the Hospital for DECAYED COMICAL FELLOWS  London    Signed by Two Directors  Should this Proposal take Effect I shall rejoice at being instrumental in the Redemption of so many diverting Creatures from utter Misery for surely it would be melancholy to reflect that he who often enlivened even the sprightly  Champain  might become miserably witty in an Alehouse or be a joking  Bootcatcher  at an Inn and tell your Honour a Story while he is divesting your Legs of their leathern Incumbrance I shall therefore hope that all true Lovers of Humour will promote the Scheme just hinted for the sake of those who ruin themselves for their Pleasure and I shall be highly

Defendant  upon an Action brought against the said  Shuter  for Damages suffered by the  Plantiffs  at a public Exhibition on  Wednesday  Evening last when they were all taken off as it is called with such lively Touches of Mimickery that the Audience was kept in a constant Burst of Laughter to the very great Uneasiness of the said  Plaintiffs  The Jury being impanelled Counseller  Blunderbuss  opened the Cause in a very vehement Speech He inveighed severely against  StagePlayers  and urged it was a very great Hardship that honest and worthy Characters should be converted into Ridicule by the Buffoonery of an impertinent Player For his Part he would take upon him to say that his Clients were Persons of known Integrity Probity and Honour and he  thought them more valuable Characters in

at  Comus  's Court and he was so diverting that I took two Tickers for myself and my Wise I could have swore as how it was our Watchman that was speaking and I also heard the  MuffinMan  very

we got in at alland when we did get in they placed us on the StageWell sure I never was so ashamed in all my born DaysI thought I looked as impudent as any Actress among themand at last the Prisoner came on the Stage and as he was passing by he said to me "you had better take off your Pat"tin's Miss" SaucyFellowand so be began to mimic  the  MuffinMan  and it was the very same Person that serves my Mistress with  Muffins  The Defence  Mr  Shuter  's Council owned the Fact but offered many Arguments in Mitigation They insisted it could not be of any material Detriment to the Plaintiffs even allowing that they were mimicked Why theresore then continued the Council "I cannot perceive Gentlemen of the Jury  that my Clientahasincurred so severe a Penalty because whyit was not done with an

Degrees short of the Purity and graceful Strength of the Original but such as it is it may in some Sort serve to inculcate the real Utility of a very pleasurable Occupation which is at present too much neglected by People of Condition of both Sexes Mr  Addison  wonders how Men of Sense can spend so many Hours together without receiving any other Ideas than what are suggested by an Arrangement of black  and red Spots But such is the prevailing Fashion of the Times that the  Book of Four Kings  is the only  Volume  at present perused with any Degree of Attention and I will venture to affirm the  Four motley Monarchs  are better beloved by several Persons of Condition than any  real King  in  Europe  A Friend of mine who has a Knock in conforming all his Compositions to the prevailing Taste of the Town tells me very seriously that he has often wondered how Men of Discernment can sit down to Performances which a little Experience Light inform them will never be read such as the

CardTable in Town I must however beg Leave to inform my pretty Readers that they are highly mistaken if they imagine that by dedicating a few Hours to litterary Amusements they endanger their lovely Features and run a Risque of dimming the sparkling Lustre of the Eye On the contrary a Page or two in a Morning may serve to adjust the Countenance and the Acquisition of a new Idea may give a more engaging Ornament to the Head than a new  Paris  Cap and the Eye will certainly beam with more Attention when directed by an active Principle within than when it swims round the Room in pretty giddy

Add to this that softening Quality which Letters have in all Cases of Adversity In the Day of Affliction the surest and most certain Relief the Mind can receive will be derived from the Habit of being conversant with Books If I remember right it is Mr  Locke  that observes in his  Conduct of the Understanding  that a Power of transferring our Thoughts from one Object to another is an Essential requisite in a wellformed Understanding And surely nothing can better help to prevent the Mind from dwelling too long upon any habitual Set of Ideas which may induce a settled  Form of Melancholy than

_NOT to admire is the golden Rule established by  Horace  for the Acquirement of inward Peace and Happiness and also for securing the Tenure of them when once obtained The same Precept may also be enforced as the surest Method to form a sound Understanding and to preserve the Judgment free and undistempered Mr  Pope  in his  Essay on Criticism  a Poem in which good Sense and Poetry are beautifully combined has given this Observation the Sanction of a Maxim  For Fools  ADMIRE but Men of Sense APPROVE  In our greener Years indeed when the young Affections are to use the Poet's Phrase  tremblingly alive all o'er  when every Object presents itself in some new and striking Attitude fond ADIMRATION may be then allowed to gaze and each Incident in the Scene of Life may call forth the juvenile Expressions of Wonder and Astonishment But surely when we become somewhat hackneyed in the Ways of Men when Habit has coated over that Quickness of Sensation which attends the raw and inexperienced Mind the elevated Brow of Amazement may be expected to subside to the sober Cast of Reflection and Knowledge I am at present acquainted with a Gentleman who has made so many sensible Animadversions on the various Occurrences of Life that I am convinced nothing can arrive to excite in his Breast any Emotions of Surprize and I have often heard him say very humorously  Lord I have already known so many unexpected Turns and Revolutions of Things that were I to see the MONUMENT walk down  Cheapside  and take out St  Paul  's Church to dance a Minuet it would make no Manner of Impression on my Spirits no more than when I read that it will be HighWater at  LondonBridge  at half past Ten  But in the general Mass of Life there is such a lamentable Inanity in the Minds of most People and the Gross of Mankind are so scantily furnished with Ideas that there are but few who when taken from their manual Occupations or their other Business do not fall into a sluggish Oscitancy for want of a Sufficiency of Matter to employ their intellectual Faculties Thus by an habitual Remissness in reviewing the ordinary Notices of Things the Power of arranging and comparing our Ideas in their manifold Relations to each other which we commonly call JUDGMENT lies indolently dormant and the Consequence is that upon every Emergence the idle Passions of Astonishment take  Possession of the Soul It is observable that this Disease is not always confined to the unenlightened Part of Mankind but we may sometimes perceive this mental Debility among those who from their Education and from their Intercourse with the World might be expected to be somewhat more solid There are perhaps in the Circle of my own Acquaintance at least half a score Persons possessed of Talents capable of extensive Discernment and of thinking very justly upon any ordinary Topics of Conversation and yet through an Habit of Inattention such a total Relaxation unstrings their intellectual Powers that they in Fact appear to have impotently pinned their Faith on other Mens Sleeves and to have lost all Kind of Capacity of judging for themselves It is among such People and such only that THE COMICAL FELLOW or THE AGREEABLE DEVIL whom I have described in a former Paper acquires his prodigious Reputation for Wit and Humour Sir  Andrew Wonderful  has for some Time past been esteemed a knowing one by his Neighbours in the Ward of  Farringdon without  and in his Business he is accounted a Man of very notable Dexterity but spend the Evening with Sir  Andrew  at any Tavern on the St  James  's Side of  TempleBar  and he is all Amazement from the Time he enters the Room until his old rumbling Coach conveys him back to the City If you mention to him the Lie of the Day that the Lady of a certain noble Lord was caught in Bed with a Lieutenant of the Guards  Good Law says Sir  Andrew  you dont say so  It's very true though and this Morning early a welldressed Man walking across  Lincoln  's  Inn Fields  fell down dead  Dear Heart says the Knight you surprize me  Late last Night a Game at  Whist  was played at  White  's Chocolatehouse on which upwards of three thousand Pounds depended  Three thousand Pounds I never heard of such a Thing in  my born Daysthree thousand PoundsGood LawThree thousand Pounds    Every Man who is actuated with the laudable Ambition of being a rational Creature should endeavour to fix within himself such Habits of thinking as will keep him collected and prevent his Thoughts from being scattered into wild Surprize upon every little Emergence that offers There should certainly be cherished in every Breast an honest Pride in preserving its own free Agency and maintaining an Independency of Understanding selfimpelled and selfdirected awakened into thinking by the Impressions of its own Ideas and adopting all its Principles and Maxims from the Suggestions of its own Judgment For surely there can not be any Thing more unmanly than leaving either the Faculties of the Soul or the Muscles of the Face to be played upon by the Will and Pleasure of another To have a Titter ready whenever the COMICAL FELLOW chuses to be facetious and to hold a Man's Belief at another's Disposal according as he chuses to decide upon any Subject most incontestibly indicates a weak and frivolous Understanding  I was led into this Tract of Thought by a Reflection on the Manner in which I spent an Evening this Week with three Gentlemen who had sollicited the Meeting with earnest Importunity During the last six Weeks I never met any one of them but he instantly began  Well my dear Boy when shall we have an Eveningyou know it is what we have long wished for  At length the  Rendezvous  was fixed and at the appointed Hour I met my Friends not without very high Expectations of a pleasant Evening A Bottle of  Allen  's in an Instant appeared on the Table and circulated with uncommon Celerity I then expected my Friends to open some Vein of Discourse but all continuing in determined Silence in order to break the Ice I began with an ordinary Topic and enquired about  Elizabeth Canning  I suppose said I the Government is resolved to let her see foreign Parts  That's  Humour  said one of the Gentleman to his next Neighbour and then they all burst into a loud Laugh I did not perceive the Joke but continued I  whether she is guilty or not it will do her no Prejudice to see the World  "  Humour  again" says the Gentleman who sat opposite to me  You're a fine young Fellow  says a second "This is high" says the third and then all three formed a Chorus of Laughter "The Captain who carries her abroad" added I  will have a good Contract of it for he need give her nothing but Crusts and Water for six and twenty Days and she'll subsist upon that  Another Touch  says my Friend over the Way  Admirable  cries his Neighbour and the Gentleman next to me alarming me with a Slap on the Shoulder roars out"Odzouns" and then  Laughter holding both his Sides  took possession of them for the Space of ten Minutes  Upon this I perceived that my Company held more of ADMIRATION than of JUDGMENT and I became heartily tired of the Party though were I inclined to SelfApprobation they omitted nothing that could administer to my Vanity the Gentleman opposite to me frequently testifying his Approbation with that's  Humour  the second repeating  you're a fine young Fellow  and my next Neighbour thundering in my Ear his rapturous  Odzouns  which extraordinary Interjections were absolutely the Sum total of all the Conversation that I heard from these three notable Blanks in the Creation I accordingly took occasion to break up the Meeting as soon as possible and upon retiring home to my Chambers could not help drawing up this loose Essay which I have ordered my Publisher to send to each of the Gentlemen in order if possible to cure them of their servile Admiration and inform them if they desire to be ranked  among FreeAgents that their only Title to it consists in thinking and judging for themselves  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  May    THE Board of Criticism sat late last Night upon the following Copy of Verses and by the

luxurious will you not awake  And rising from the Bed of Sloth enjoy  The cool the fragrant and the silent Hour  To Meditation due and sacred Song  Believe me Dear  Charles  the most jovial Three in

and seems to threaten I know not what prodigious Things every Object excites finer Feelings and more delicate Perceptions than can be suggested to the  heatoppressed Brain  as  Shakespear  phrases it  Prithee honest  Ranger  how long is it since you saw the Sun rise I dare believe not since we were together at  Eaton  But surely if this Phaenomenon had not very expansive Beauties the Poets would never have been so fond of seizing every Opportunity to describe it Since I have mentioned this Circumstance among the Poets I must observe that our great Dramatic Bard has in two Passages excelled all the Writers from the Days of  Homer  down to the present State of modern Poetry in their favourite Openings of the Morn The Saffrontinctured Fingers of  Aurora  the Sun rising from  Thetis  's Lap the Daughter of the Dawn coming from the Bed of  Tithonus  are in my Opinion all poor and ineffectual when compared with the more natural Description in  Romeo  and  Juliet  Jocund Day  Stands tiptoe on the misty Mountain's Top  I have compared this admirable Piece of Imagery for several successive Mornings with the real Object in Nature and I really am at a Loss which to admire most like the travelling  Persian  who when the Reflection of the solar Rays as happens sometimes in those Countries  have formed in a Cloud another imaginary Sun gazes at both with reverential Eyes in doubt with himself to which he shall offer his Morning Adoration The second Passage I mean is in the Tragedy of  Hamlet  where after seeing the Ghost of the deceased King  Horatio  breaks off with  But see the Morn in Russetmantle clad  Walks o'er the Dews of yon high eastern Hill  You know the Poets are fond of personalizing both physical and moral Qualities in order to give Animation to their Poetry and to throw Things as much as possible into Action and here surely we have that creative Figure in its high Perfection the whole Picture could not receive finer Colourings from the Hand of  Titian  the Drapery is beautiful and the Action in which this poetical Being is represented is admirably descriptive of the first Dawnings of the Day  My Dear  Ranger  come and let us criticise upon this Phenomenon let us enjoy that Delight which the Mind takes in comparing the Objects of Imitation with the Finishings of mimic Art Let me assure you that to see this gradual Expansion of the solar Influence on the Face of Nature will give such a calm Flow of Spirits for the ensuing Vocations of the Day as cannot be experienced in a City Life You will possibly say you had rather loiter in your

careless Limbs to lay  Under a plantane Shade and all the Day  With am'rous Airs my Fancy entertain  c  Or if inclined to diversify the Scene and ramble about in gentle Exercise what Place so fit as these very Gardens which afford all the Variety in Nature Do you delight in trim Hedges uniform Vistas smooth Pastures and studied Regularity Your Taste may here find enough to gratify it Or are you

suddenly surprized to find yourself upon a barren Heath lost to the World and nothing presents itself to View but the withered Shrub and the blasted Clump of Trees and Hares and Rabbits running

Groves Meadows the Woodland fertile Pastures Hills and Vales offer themselves to the Sight in mixed Variety The barren Heath and the Sunburnt craggy Soil appear with all those Softenings to the Eye

consider myself an unworthy Member as I have not of late attended them with proper Punctuality my Friend Captain  Gulliver  whom I formerly introduced to the Acquaintance of my Readers produced a Paper which he said he had brought with him from  Cairo  amongst several other Manuscripts of the same Nature After perusing it I judged it would make no improper Entertainment for my Readers and I therefore have ordered it a Place in this Day's Paper  In the Days when the Empire of  Bagdad  spread Terror round the Nations and their conquering Arms added a constant Accession of Honour and Wealth to the Califfs  Aboulcasem  a Youth of extensive Parts and boundless Ambition had the Address to raise himself to the first Honours of the State and in Process of Time he arrived to the Dignity of Vizier In this Office his Conduct was such as might be expected from a Person of his exalted Parts His Renown for Genius and a bright Understanding distinguished him above the Rest of the Ministers and the Name of  Aboulcasem  was wafted on the Wings of Fame through all the Regions of the Last  But amidst all the Effulgence of his Glory  Aboulcasem  was hurried away by the Violence of his Passions which were rapid as the Cataracts of the  Nile  and violent as the Whirlwinds in the Desart His Soul was apt to kindle into a Blaze at the Sight of Beauty and in the Height of his national Business he would  frequently sport away his Hours in wanton Dalliance with a  Circassian  Beauty with whom he would often betake himself to the Baths and there in amorous Dissipation write Letters upon Matters of the utmost Consequence to the  Califf  and the whole Empire of  Bagdad  and dispatch them to his Agents whom he had sent to other neighbouring Courts At length he was suspected to favour the Cause of the banished Prince  Abdallah  who was then wandering about the Desarts of  Arabia  and though no convincing Proofs could be alledged against him yet not being able to vindicate himself from the Imputation he was obliged to fly his Country  Aboulcasem  immediately betook himself to the Prince  Abdallah  and finding his Cause totally ruined without any Possibility of reinstating him he then exerted all his Industry to obtain Leave to return home As Things of this Nature cannot be compassed in a short Time in order to hinder his Mind in the mean Time from falling a Prey to Melancholy and all the Horrors of disappointed Ambition he applied himself to the Labours of the wise Men in order to relieve his Mind Here he penned his Thoughts upon Exile and many other important Points of speculative Morality He lived like an Hermit in the Desarts of  Arabia  and there illustriously hid he carried on his Researches into the Study of Nature History and all the Branches of human Learning which could adorn and enrich so accomplished a Mind  Thus furnished with all mental Embellishments  Aboulcasem  was in Time permitted to return but he was not restored to his Honours As Ambition is ever unrelenting he was no sooner fixed in his own Abode than he instantly became an implacable Enemy to the Vizier who had consented to recal him He drew from the Stores of Knowledge which he had formerly treasured up some of the severest Reflections which could be made upon the Minister's Administrations and  this in such a powerful Strain of nervous Eloquence that he may very justly be said to have had a great Share in his  ownfal  Aboulcasem  was so happy as to have accomplished this Business which was for a long Time the grand Object of his Intentions but it was no sooner done than he perceived himself as distant as ever from regaining his Prince's Ear He therefore betook himself to his CountryHouse at a small Distance from  Bagdad  where he employed himself in reading all the Moralists of  Arabia  and in short all the fine Eastern Writers In this Recess he cultivated an Acquaintance with two of the first Geniuses of his Time  Selim  and  Mirza  the former was remarkable among the Eastern Sages for elevated Strains of Poetry and the latter for those Oriental Tales which are generally called the  Tale of a Tub  and the Adventures of  Gulliver  the Merchant of  Bagdad  These two undertook the Defence of  Aboulcasem  's Character and spared no Pains to blazon his Fame to the World  Mean Time  Aboulcasem  pursued his Researches into all the Branches of human Wisdom the civil Polity of States was to him a Storehouse which disclosed a constant Fund of Supply he then turned his Eye inwards upon the Texture and Make of his own Mind he used to say that the Mind was a concealed Repository of Riches and that it behoved every Man to find out the Secrets of it this accordingly he did but he did not enjoy the secret selfish Gratification of many who when in Possession of a Treasure will never let it be seen by human Eyes on the contrary he was glad to have every Opportunity of displaying himself and this rather to a Degree of Ostentation from this Branch of Study  Aboulcasem  proceeded to examine into Matters of Religion the various Systems of the Eastern Sages were all to him perfectly well known he laughed at the  Keran  the System of Morality which  Confucius  taught  Aboulcasem  held in Contempt  Mahomet  's Paradise was  to him a mere  Chimaera  and he declaimed with a pompous Flow of sounding Eloquence against all these various Opinions the  Bramins  were always the Objects of his severest Contempt in the Dictates of natural Religion he would say we have no Occasion for such Guides and in the Explanation of established Forms they are highly dangerous he was an Enemy to all Forms of Worship offered in the Temple of the Prophet he endeavoured to subvert the Principles upon which this Worship was founded and to introduce a new Form of Thinking of his own Since  Aboulcasem  could have no Share in the Direction of StateAffairs he was determined to soar above sublunary Things and to have the Lead in Matters of higher Importance He was highly dogmatical in his Assertions and he carried his Extravagance so far as to advance that there was no Difference between the human Species and Brutes and that it was highly probable that Dogs and the rest of the animal Creation were endued with Souls as well as Mankind and in the general he asserted that all Souls were material  In the midst of these Disquisitions  Aboulcasem  was sitting one Night in his Study his Lamp burning before him when of a sudden Thunders rolled deep and awful over his Head the Mountains were shaken and they groaned keen Lightenings flashed athwart the Hemisphere the third Heaven was opened and a Flood of Radiance descended upon the Earth The Solemnity of the Scene appalled the Heart of  Aboulcasem  Trembling seized his Limbs he fell prostrate and adored the Messenger from God who now stood before him and spoke in Accents which chilled the Blood within him and made him stand convinced of his vain Philosophy  Aboulcasem  said he receive my Sayings with an Ear of Attention Know then that the Eye of him who is in the third Heaven hath beheld thee he hath  viewed thy Ways with Compassion and he hath made this Vision a Vehicle of Instruction unto thy Soul which is at present lost and bewildered in a Maze of idle and foolish Philosophy for thy Philosophy is not calculated to advance true Knowledge Virtue and Wisdom but has its Source in Ostentation Ostentation and Vainglory have induced thee to display thy imagined Superiority of Parts which pretends to pervade all Systems of Religion and thy Heart's Conceit will approve of none Thy Studies are ill directed and their Drist is only to alienate the Minds of Men from any settled Form of Worship which you are in the Wrong to disturb as your own Insufficiency cannot substitute a better than what is designed to keep Society in a due Sense of Resignation to a Supreme Being and to preserve the Bands of civil Compact religiously unbroken Cast but thine Eye upon yonder Vale behold what is there transacted There thou may'st see Men divested of all Forms of Worship and rendered perfectly conformable to thy vain Notions of Religion There thou may'st see what is the State of Man ungoverned by settled Forms of Devotion they have shaken off all Regard to the Prophet and behold them immersed in all Manner of vicious Practices Uncontrouled they invade each other's Rights they make War to gratify their Ambition freely without Restraint they proscribe whom they please the Bonds of Society are broken and the Contempt of divine Laws has introduced a Contempt for all human Institutions To promote this Scene of Confusion are thy Writings calculated but know and dread the Truth I am now to utter that it will better behove thee to pay Submission to the established Forms of Worship of thy Country than to disturb the Peace of the Faithful and thereby fill their Minds with Doubt with Jealousy  Mistrust Suspicion and all the Horrors of an overweening Imagination  At these Words the Radiance which spoke withdrew from his Eyes and left  Aboulcasem  in the utmost Consternation the Impression was however very soon effaced for notwithstanding this Admonition he persevered in his ill Designs but the Thread of his Days was cut short before he could vent them abroad into the World However his Intentions were not totally frustrated for the Hand of Death had no sooner smote him than his Compositions fell into the Hands of  Namahran  another Eastern Writer who sold them for a certain Number of Sequins of Gold and by those Means the Writings of  Aboulcasem  came into every Body's Hands and spread their baneful Influence on the Minds of all the Inhabitants of  Bagdad  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Haymarket  May    Last Night

ossibus  VIRG  _THE gloomy Month of  November  is distinguished by Foreigners as the Heighth of the Season for  Englishmen  to hang and drown themselves but from a diligent Observation I can venture to affirm that the Month of  May  is always attended with a larger Bill of Mortality than any other Part of the Year It is the SpringTime of Love when the Blood has received a Renovation of Warmth and young Minds are then more easily melted down in the amorous Fire A Bookseller whom I now and then chat with at his  Circulating Library  informs me that he can tell when the Poison of Love begins to rankle in the Breast that he can trace it in its Progress and knows exactly when it is become quite general in its Influence Romances he says in the Beginning are more and more call'd for as it encreases Lord  Grey  's Love Letters the Loves of  Octavia  and  Philander Abelard  and  Eloise  Letters from a  Nun to a Cavalier  c come into Play and when the Infection is grown Epidemic then the Tragedies of  Romeo and Juliet All for Love or the World well lost  Theodosius or the Force of Love  c cannot be supplied quick enough to answer the wonderful Demand for them My ingenious Friend will sometimes take me into his back Room and "Friend  Ranger  " says he  can't you touch us up some secret Memoirs or a LoveTale or something by Way of NovelIf green Peas come in fastthe Season for Peas is always favourable to lovesick MindsI can manage to put you off let me seeay about a couple of thousand by Midsummeryes thereaboutsI could getif you will put your Name to ita matter of fifteen hundred subscribed among the Tradehow will you make it endhappy or unhappyfor there will be a Difference in thatbut that must be determined by the Chapter of Accidentsa NorthEast Wind chills the amorous Heatin that Case you had better make them diebut if the southern Gale continues they may in the Conclusion be  conducted by the laughing Loves to the nuptial Bower  the Book will soon be in every Body's Hands at  Tunbridge Bath Scarborough c  Thus is this skilful Person in his Trade for taking Advantage of that Succession of Foibles which are constantly rising and falling in the most whimsical Vicissitude in this Metropolis The Truth of it is the Playhouses the Circulating Libraries the public Gardens about Town owe very much of their Success to the lovesick Minds of Boys and Girls It is this universal Passion which rolls so many of the Youth of both Sexes down the soft Declivity in  GreenwichPark  it is this which is so fond of taking cold at the Tin Cascade in  Vauxhall  Gardens and it is this which pours forth so many Groupes of Enamoratos along the Fields and Meadows about  London  every  Sunday  Evening  Notwithstanding the extensive Influence of this soft Infection it is somewhat surprizing that among all the Writers who have endeavoured to describe it very few  of them have succeeded in any tolerable Degree What Numbers of  English  Tragedies have been sunk into an insipid Languor by the ineffectual Whim of Episodic Love The Tragedy of  Romeo  and  Juliet  excepting now and then some glittering Conceits which we may suppose to be Transfusions from the  Italian Novellist  who furnished  Shakespear  with the Story affords a beautiful Representation of two young Minds touched with this tender Sympathy Many of the Tragedies of  Beaumont  and  Fletcher  though they are now too much neglected display the delicate Sensations of Love in all their native genuine Simplicity I am not clear whether the fine Interchange of Sentiments between  Jaffier  and  Belvidera  should come within the Precincts of Love because the Desire of Possession which fires the tender Imagination into a gentle Enthusiasm has then subsided into a sympathetic Friendship between Man and Wife and accordingly the most pathetic Touches are derived not from the Lover's fond Hope of mutual Bliss to come but from a Retrospect to those vanished Hours when  Jaffier  lay for three whole happy Years in his  Belvidera  's Arms and thus the Transition from their former Endearments to their present Misery excites those intense Emotions of Pity for their Fate Perhaps after the Writers just mentioned the Tragedy of  Tancred  and  Sigismunda  has the fairest Claim to any Degree of Reputation in this Piece the Love of the young Prince is manly and never dwindles into childish Conceit the Feelings of  Sigismunda  are delicate and sensible and through all the Scenes the Softness of their Passion is ennobled by Sentiments of Honour and moral Dignity But among all the Books which the enamoured of both Sexes are apt to call for at this Season of the Year there is none which can exhibit so lively a Picture of Love as the Fourth Book of  Dryden  's  Virgil  which I would recommend to my young Readers not by Way of adding Fuel to the Fire but to warn them  of the Dangers of the growing Flame as they will here perceive all the Vicissitudes of the Passion till at length it terminates in a melancholy Catastrophe  I shall conclude this Paper with an Extract from an unpublished Pamphlet written by an ingenious Gentleman who has given me Leave to make my own use of it It is called the History of  Rosamond  's  Pond for the Month of May  and though some of the Incidents are not the Effects of Love it will however shew many of the Disasters that attend that sweet but dangerous Sensation  The History of Rosamond's Pond for the Month of May  A young Lady of Fashion whose Name it is thought proper to suppress flung herself into the Pond because she had an Amour with  Thomas  the Footman she was taken up by the Centinel and only damaged a Gauze Capuchin  Miss  Betty Threadneedle  Milliner in the  NewExchange  threw herself in on account of Illusage from Monsieur  Capriole  a  French  FigureDancer at  DruryLane  Playhouse the Coroner's Inquest sat upon her Body and brought in their  Verdict Lunacy  William Ponderwell  was in Love with a celebrated Coquette and after paying an Attendance of several Months he was at length quite tired out and walked very demurely to the Brink of the Pond where he stood for some Time fixed in Thought then changed his Mind and walked home very cooly  Bob Dare Devil  having very passively received a Kicking from an Officer threw himself in the oblivious Lake that he might not survive the Loss of his Honour he was taken up and now lights your Honour across the Way about  DruryLane  Playhouse  John Henpeck  drowned himself after walking very soberly with a Friend in the  BirdCage  Walk There were found in

unruly Passion  Dick Wildfire  threw himself in about Six in the Evening which drew together a large Concourse of People but it being only a Frolick for a Wager he swam across and got out again  N B  He took cold and died in a few Days of a raging Fever  Sappbo  the famous Poetess fell in while she was refounding aloft an Ode of her own composing upon the new Building at the  HorseGuards  Freshcoloured Moll  was tired of the World and went to fling herself into the Pond but meeting a young  Templer  at the fatal Brink she adjourned with him to the little Island and instead of sending a Person out of the World it is considently said that in nine Months she ushered a Foundling into it  N B  She now fells Apples and picks Pockets in the Piazza of  Covent Garden  Monsieur  Languedoc  a

ducked him three Times  Mrs  Fretful  Wife of  John Fretful  threw herself in because her Sister was better married and kept more Card Tables than herselfUpon being taken out she said  There was no such Thing as bearing it and that she was the most unhappiest Woman in the World  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  June    LAST Night the Parliament of Criticism met here when Mr  Town  came

Actor to bring at least TWO new Parts into the Stock every Winter by Way of shewing how he passed his Time in his Recess from Business during the Summer and to several public and private Bills After which Mr  Town  made the following most gracious Speech  My Friends and Critics  As we are now come to the Conclusion of the critical Sessions I cannot dismiss you without returning you Thanks for that Peevishness and Petulance which you have manifested during this last Season It is with the utmost Pleasure I now let you know that several Pretenders to Poetry have wrote new Tragedies and Comedies and in such a Manner as will afford the highest Joy as they will all most infallibly be damned whenever they appear  Gentlemen of the City  Your clapping and hissing with implicit Deference to my Judgement at both Playhouses during this last Winter shews your Affection for me and my Cause  My Friends and Critics  It is with an unspeakable Regret I am now to tell you that Criticism does not agree with my Constitution and therefore I must retire from those weighty Cares until Providence shall please to restore my hissing Powers which are now somewhat impaired On this Account I must now dissolve the Parliament of Criticism and whenever you are summoned together again I hope  will adhere to the noble Principles of  Malevolism  which it has ever been my Study to inculcate  And the Parliament of Critictsm was dissolved accordingly  NUMB  GRAY'sINN  Saturday June    Veteres ita moratur laudatque Poetas  Indignor quidquam reprehendi non quia crasse  Scriptum ille pideve putetur sed quia nuper  HOR  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  SIR  _I Know the Importance of an Author to himself is so very great that he looks upon it as absolutely necessary that the Public should be informed of every particular Circumstance relating to his Body or Mind as for Instance at what Hour he goes to Bed on which Side he composed himself to Sleep whether his Slumbers were interrupted and above all the Purport of his Dreams  for Dreams descend from Jove  This Practice I believe is perfectly just but I hope Mr  Ranger  will not monopolize Dreaming and that he will give an occasional Writer the Liberty of communicating to the Public how he passed the Night My Hopes of succeeding in this Request are the more sanguine as the intellectual Scene of which I mean here to give some Account was occasioned by a Perusal of a Vision of your own in which you describe a  Sacrifice to the Graces  The Images which that Piece excited in my Fancy incorporated if I may so call it with the Ideas that have been uppermost in my waking Thoughts for some Time past and I imagined in my Sleep that there was a general Election in  Parnassus  for proper Members to represent  the Republic of Letters It seems  Apollo  was induced by frequent Murmurs and Complaints to dissolve his Parliament some Malcontents among the Moderns being of Opinion that the Antients had arbitrarily voted themselves perpetual Dictators in Wit whereas upon a free uninfluenced Election they believed themselves capable of returning a larger Number than the said Antients The Party for the Moderns was led on by Monsieur  De la Motte Perrault  and  Wotton  the two former were vigorously opposed by  Boileau  Madam  Dacier  and the latter by Mr  Pope  and Doctor  Swift Swift  ordered a new Edition of his Battle of the Books to be published forthwith and  Pope  took occasion to reprint his Essays and Criticisms upon  Homer  The  Old  and  New Interest  were the Words by which each Party signified their Attachments and Reams of  Lampoons Acrostics  and  Rebusses  were issued out by the Moderns which were all answered by Epigrams Fables and Burlesque Pieces written by the Friends of the Antients  At length the Writs were issued out to the proper Officers to chuse Representatives for the several Counties and BoroughTowns in  Parnassus  some Places by poetic Licence having Leave to return as many Members as could fairly prove a Qualification  Homer  and  Virgil  were declared for epic Poetry  Milton  was set up by the Encouragement of several Friends and they were all three accordingly chosen  Homer  had four and twenty upon the Poll and  Virgil  twelve  Milton  by an Assessment a little before the Election created two new Votes by which he also reached the Number twelve and  Virgil  was so modest that he made no Objection to it  Tasso  and Sir  Richard Blackmore  were declared Candidates but the former was proved to have bribed with  clinquant  and the latter could not make out a Qualification  In the Regions of Tragedy  Sophocles  and  Euripides  joined Interests and  Aristotle  undertook to canvass for them but  Shakespear  carried it by a great Majority  Corneille  and  Racine  stood next upon the List but a Scrutiny was demanded in Favour of the  Old Interest  upon a Suspicion that several  Copyholders  had polled for the Moderns and the  NewInterest  employed some  French  Critics to go through their Answer it was thought it will at last end in a double Return and it was further said that  Otway  and  Row  would be declared duly elected  Dryden  and  Lee  joined Interests and though many gay and flighty Persons were very warm in their Cause their Schemes were looked upon by the cool and judicious as rather too wild and romantic The  French  Critics threatened that at some future Election they should be able to make more Members being resolved to put up  Crebillon  and  Voltaire  even against  Shakespear  to which end several Libels against the last mentioned Genius were already drawn up by  Voltaire  In the comic Territories the Antients lost their Election by a very great Majority  Moliere Ben Johnson Congreve  and  Vanburgh  being declared duly elected  Shakespear  was made an honourary Member for this Quarter and was universally allowed to be a Representative of both Places  Dryden  found Means by the Assistance of a  Spanish  Friar to insinuate himself into this Place and it was given out that when  Colley Cibber  arrives here he will be put up as a Person duly qualified though it is apprehended that his Quarrel with  Pope  has deprived him of several Votes  The  New Interest  exulted greatly upon their Conquest in the last Election and in order to compleat their Triumph proceed further into the Regions of  Humour  and  Ridicule Homer  was here again put up by  Aristotle  who urged the  Margites  as a sufficient Claim but the Writings of that Estate being lost he was obliged to  decline the Poll After this an Advertisement was published desiring the Votes and Interest of all the true Sons of Merriment for  Aristophanes Menander Plautus  and  Terence  who had just lost their Election in another Place  Lucian  set up upon his own Interest The  Moderns  declared  Cervantes Rablais Swift  and  Butler  joint Candidates being all Gentlemen heartily attached to true Wit and Humour Votes were also sollicited for several other Personages Monsieur  la Sage Scarroon Marivaux  and  Addison  were strongly recommended but the latter being returned in Conjunction with  Terence  and  la Sage  for the Borough of POLITEMIRTH Sir  Richard Steel  appeared on the Hustings and withdrew his Friend's Name  Swift  mixed with the lower Sort of People joked with the Women about their Dressingrooms and republished his Account of the strange Man just arrived in Town  Rablais  contributed a good deal to the general Mirth  Cervantes  occasionally gave vent to a Vein of low Humour but  Lucian  could not make himself universally understood and many of his Turns did not allude to modernpractised Life  Scarroon  got together a Company of Strollers and exhibited Entertainments in Booths with great Success  Ward Concanon  and  Tom Brown  offered themselves on this Occasion but were rejected with Contempt At length the Books were closed and  Lucian Cervantes Butler  and  Swift  were declared duly elected At which the Managers for the  New Interest  were highly instamed they lodged a Petition in Favour of  Rablais  but such a Vein of Extravagance run through the Whole and some Passages were worked up into such a Strain of unintelligible Frolic that it was generally supposed it would be given against him However his Friends were determined to bring him in for an inferior Borough and  Scarron  and  Marivaux  were also assured of their Election Whenever  Fielding  shall arrive to his  Estate in this Part of  Parnassus  there is a Borough ready to elect him  To have so many Moderns chosen for the last Division was highly agreeable to the  New Interest  they were however a good Deal dejected at the Election for  History  for which the Contest was ineffectual  Thycidides Sallust Livy  and  Tacitus  being chosen by a great Majority  Faminianus Strada  endeavoured to hurt the Election of the last mentioned Writer in order as it was thought to substitute himself but  Peers  being allowed to appear at Elections in  Parnassus  Lord  Bolingbroke  gave all his Interest to  Tacitus  and assured him that his Works were of infinite Use in all his political Tracts  Sallust  recommended St  Real  an approved  French  Historian to a Borough  Julius Caesar  was put up without his Consent a literary Fame not being the Object of his Ambition Lord  Clarendon  was for a long

lacrymas iterum tentare precando  Cogitur supplex animos submiltere amori  VIRG  _MY Friend Mr  Candid  desires that he may discharge his Promise to give some further Animadversions on the Tragedy of King  Lear  as he has run into a long Essay I shall resign to him the entire Paper of this Day  Notwithstanding what is ingeniously urged by the Gentleman who obliged me with a Letter upon my former Criticism of King  Lear  I cannot after a Review of that Tragedy find any Reason to retract my Assertion that the aged Monarch's Madness is occasioned by the Ingratitude of his Daughters The Folly of a Parents putting himself in the Power of his Children must incidentally appear in a Play founded on such a Story as that of  Lear  but had those Children not proved ungrateful I apprehend there is no Reason to imagine the King's Mind would have taken the fatal Turn it did But the best Way of knowing with any Degree of Certainty the secret Causes of those Effects which disclose themselves in sundry Appearances in human Life is  by gaining an Insight into the private Tempers of Men  Lean  considered in this Manner soon discovers to us the latent Seeds which are likely to kindle into a Blaze upon the Revolt of his Daughters The Impression which  Cordelia  's artless Answer had upon him is described by himself  O most small Fault  How ugly didst thou in  Cordelia  shew  Which like an Engine wrench'd my Frame of Nature  From these a Place drew from my Heart all Love  And added to the Gail  This plainly evinces where the old Man's Passions were most accessible and how strong the Workings of them were likely to be when he should find a total Disaffection No wonder if then his Frame of Nature is wrench'd from the fix'd Place and indeed his Tendency that Way soon discovers itself when he breaks out into these Words  I will forget my Natureso  KIND  a Father    Were the Loss of Royalty uppermest in his Thoughts his Remarks would most assuredly take their Tincture from thence and he would rather blame himself as a WEAK  Father  who had given all to his Children But the Circumstance of his having given all is never mentioned unless it is to aggravate the Illusage he has met with and when he says to himself  To take't again perforce  it is plain that it is not merely for the sake of regaining lost Grandeur but to avenge his Wrongs and he immediately subjoins  Monster Ingratitude  and a little after  let me not be mad not mad sweet Heaven  The hool indeed taunts him with the Folly of his having divested himself of his Power and put the Rod as he calls it in his Childrens Hand These Ideas are so obvious that  Shakespear  knew they would strike even the most superficial Mind but we find it is no Consideration  with the Father who never dwells upon it though it is suggested to him so frequently On the other Hand how acute are his Feelings whenever he recurs to his Daughters want of filial Piety He that can read the following Lines without being softened into Tears must as Mr  Addison  has said upon another Occasion have either a very good or a very bad Head    Oh  Regan  she has tied  Sharptooth'd  UNKINDNESS  like a  VULTURE  here    I scarce can speak to theethoul't not believe  With how depraved a QualityOh  Regan  What a Picture of a Mind have we hereThe Strugglings with his Sorrows the Breaks of Passion the Attempt to speak and the instant Suppression of his Powers are the most natural and pathetic Touches Can the human Imagination in all her Treasury of Language find Words to express at once the detestable Crime of Disobedience to our Parents and the exquisite Feelings of an injured Father like the following Passage  She has struck me with her Tongue  Most Serpent like upon the very Heart  Who is there that does not instantaneously find himself in a Gush of Tears on reading these Lines And more particularly when a little afterwards he comes to the Speech which closes with  You think I'll weep  No I'll not weeptho' I have full Cause of weeping  This Heart shall break into a thousand Flaws  Or e'er I'll weepO Fool I shall go mad  The last Touch in this Speech is the finest close of a Climax of Passion that can be conceived and even then the old Monarch feels that his  Wits begin to turn  for which melancholy Situation  Shakespear  all along  finely prepares us by skilfully marking each Step the Mind takes in all its Workings towards that settled State of Grief  I have dwell'd thus long on the Cause of  Lear  's Distraction because the Arguments offered by my ingenious Correspondent in the Essay of the th of  January  carry some Degree of Plausibility but from what has been premised together with what I have urged in my former Paper there cannot I think remain any Doubt about it Those that are not satisfied with this reasoning are referred to the noblest Commentary this or any Poet ever had I mean Mr  Garrick  's Performance of  Lear  in which there is displayed so just a Knowledge of the human Mind under a State of Madness together with such exquisite Feelings of the various Shiftings of the Passions so finely at the same Time enseebled with the Debility of Age that I believe whenever this admirable Actor ceases to play this Part the unhappy Monarch will lose more than  fifty of his Followers at a Clap    Though our great Poet pays us very amply for all his Transgressions against the Laws of  Aristotle  yet I have frequently wished that the noble Wildness of his Genius had not rendered him so unbounded in his Fables Had this Tragedy been planned with more Art without an underplot to draw off our Affections from the principal Object it had been a Piece for all the united Efforts of  Greece  to envy However the Episode in which the  Bastard  is acting the same unnatural Part as  Lear  's legitimate Daughters is not entirely detached from the main Subject the Misfortunes of the good old  Gloster  who endeavours to assist the forlorn King must touch every Breast and the Character of  Edgar  must appear amiable in every Eye  The close of this Tragedy is full of Terror and Commiseration and our great Foet has here given us a Death which is not often to be found in the Playhouse  Bill of Mortality  viz  the Death of  Lear  without the Dagger or the Bowl But perhaps after all the Heartpiercing Sensations which we have before endured through the whole Piece it would be too much to see this actually performed on the Stage from the Actor whom I have already named I am sure it would though I should be glad to see the Experiment made convinced at the same Time that the Play as it is altered will always be most agreeable to an Audience as the Circumstances of  Lear  's Restoration and the virtuous  Edgar  's Alliance with the amiable  Cordelia  must always call forth those gushing Tears which are swelled and enobled by a virtuous Joy The Alteration is justified by another Reason which is that  Lear  was really restored to his Crown if we may believe  Spencer  who gives the following remarkable Narrative with which I shall close this Paper making no Doubt but it will afford great Entertainment to the Reader who has not before amused himself with the Comparison to see  Shakespear  's Story related by so great a Poet as  Spencer  in his tenth Canto of the  FairyQueen    NEXT him King  Lear  in happy Peace long reign'd  But had no Issue male him to succeed  But three fair Daughters which were well uptrain'd  In all that seemed fit for kingly Seed  'Mong whom his Realm he equally decreed  To have divided Tho' when feeble Age  Nigh to his utmost

been in a State of Fluctuation and we find this Complaint is constantly made by the sensible and judicious in every Age Tho' the Diction of the  Romans  is likely to endure as long as Time shall subsist yet we find that  Horace  in the Words of my Motto is aware of the Decay of Words and Phrases which die away and are constantly succeeded by a sudden Birth of new Terms and Modes of Phraseology In several other Passages of his Writings there are short Reflections upon this literary Phaenomenon in which he always delivers himself with Sorrow and Regret They fall says he like Leaves and are replaced by a new Product like young Persons they flourish for a short Time and then tend to Oblivion The Comparison is most certainly very just and as young Men in their Bloom and Vigour are said to be  upon Town  it is the same with Words they are also  upon Town  for a Time and then totally perish I have often thought that a  weekly Bill  of Words would not be unentertaining to Men of Letters and if there was a proper Register Office for the Purpose where their several Births and Burials might be recorded with Accuracy and Precision I should imagine it would furnish no disagreeable History A Distinction might be made between a Kind of Sex in Words according as they are appropriated to Men or Women as for Instance  Dn my Blood  is of male Extraction and  Pshaw Fiddlestick  I take to be female Upon this Plan the weekly Bill might stand in this Form  Born this Week  Males  Females    Buried  Males  Females    Decreased in the Burial of Words this Week  If for the Satisfaction on of the curious a List should be furnished of the several Terms that are born or that die away with a short Account of the Life and Character of each Phrase whether it be born of honest Parents in  England  or  Ireland  what Company it kept whether it was Whig or Tory Popish or Protestant it would in my Opinion be an agreeable Addition to this verbal History There might further be added an Account of such Expressions as might happen to be naturalized with the Objections of the Learned who should think proper to protest against such a Naturalization of Foreigners among the Natives of this Land Such a Procedure could not fail to yield Satisfaction to the curious and though it would not prevent the Instability of our Language it would at least display the gradual Steps towards Improvement or final Destruction For my Part I have ever looked upon the Permanency of our Language to be of greater Consequence than the Stocks of whatever Denomination and for that Reason I should be glad that some Mcans were devised to hinder  the Diction of our  Shakespear  and  Milton  from being obliterated and to suspend the Evils which Mr  Pope  threatens us with when he says  And such as  Chaucer  is shall  Dryden  be  The Dictionary which the Erudition of Mr  Johnson  is preparing for the Public may in some Measure answer this End and in Aid to that Design I have been for some Time past planning a Dictionary of such Words as appeared to me from a Concurrence of various Causes to be most likely to be totally forgot In order to forward this Undertaking I have annexed a Specimen of the Work not as yet reduced into alphabetical Order but drawn out in such a Manner as may serve to convey some Idea of the intended Work When the Whole is compleated it may serve as a proper Companion to the  Spectator  the  Tatler  and all the Works of Morality which have been published in this Country and it may be contributing to make our Posterity have some faint Notion of what is meant in many Places when the visible Tendency of our Manners to an entire Change from antient Simplicity has almost effaced the Ideas which the Author of the Times intended to express  A  Specimen  of an  English Dictionary  CREATURE A Term to shew our Contempt of any Person whom we dislike chiefly used by the Ladies  THING Very often used to imply our Dislike but chiefly used to signify our highest Approbation Thus it is said of a fine Lady "She's the very Thing" or of a young Fellow "O Ma'em he's the very Thing" and sometimes with Limitation as  yes very well but not the Thing  PATRIOT A Man who speaks against the Court till he gets a Place or Pension  HONEST This Term is derived from the  Latin  Word  Honestum  which among the  Romans  implied every  Thing that is honourable in a Character From thence  Pope  was induced to say  An honest Man's the noblest Work of God  This is the original Meaning of the Word in its consequential Sense it is strangely altered  Honest  now signifies Gaming Drinking and Debauchery of every Sort it being common to say of a Man who is addicted to all these fashionable Vices that he's an  Honest Fellow  GOODNATURE an old  English  Word used by our Ancestors it is plain that it carried with it some Allusion to the Customs and Manners of those Times but there is no tracing it to its Source  RELIGION an old  English  Word for the Worship of a Supreme Being and the Practice of social Duties to our Neighbours probably a Custom known to the antient Druids  HUMBUG A Lye  WORTH originally it meant laudable Qualities of the Mind at present tis solely confined to a Man's Fortune Thus a Scoundrel of fifty Thousand is a Man of  Worth  and an honest Man in Indigence is  worth  nothing  PARTY sormerly signified Divisions in the State at present it means a Jaunt to  Vauxhall Bedlam Church  or any Place of Diversion  TRAGEDY a Name by which  Shakespear Otway  and some others entitled their dramatic Writings the Moderns retain the Word but have totally lost the original Sense of it  COMEDY probably a Piece in which our rude Ancestors represented the Follies and Characters of the Age nothing of this Sort is at present known amongst us  DAMNED when Priestcraft prevailed in this Country the People were frightened with strange Ideas of  Hell  or a Place of Torture where the departed Spirits of bad Men were supposed to be confined At present it signifies the highest Praise we can confer Thus we say  A damned fine Woman a damned charming Creature a damned fine Fellow  c  DRUM an Instrument of warlike Music used at the March of an Army or in Time of Battle to animate the Soldiery Hence stiled by  Shakespear  the  Spirit stirring Drum  It has not been used to any Purpose by the  English  since the Days of the Duke of  Marlborough  In its metaphorical Sense it means a Party of Cards  Vide Rout  FRIENDSHIP an old  English  Word used by our Ancestors to signify the complex Idea of Affection and Esteem between two or more Persons founded upon a virtuous Sympathy of Tempers and congenial Habits of Virtue  for the Meaning of the Word  VIRTUE  see in its respective Place  This Custom was totally banished in the Reign of King  Charles  II and few or no Traces of it have been discovered ever since  GOD The antient  Druids  it is probable from all Historians imagined that a superior Being superintended the Direction of the Universe and the Term GOD it is not unlikely originally fignified this superior Being but since it has been happily found out that every Thing was made by  Chance  or that  Nature Vide  Nature  in its proper Place  produced every Thing we behold and since the Properties of Matter have been sufficiently detected by Lord  Bolingbroke  and others the Term  God  is totally exploded as merely expressive of some Chimaera which has no Existence  MODESTY alludes to some Custom among the antient  British  Ladies  EARTHQUAKE a Party at Cards Vide  Rout Drum  or  Hurricane    FASHION a polite Term of Excuse for all the Vices that can be thought of  NATURE Nothing at all it is often called  Plastic Nature universal Nature  c but the Idea is always the same  ROUT formerly signified the Defeat of an Army and when the Soldiers were all put to flight or to the Sword they were said to be routed The Ladies in order to preserve some Idea of  Cressi Poitiers Blenheim  c have agreed to call their Assemblies by the Name of  Routs  This it is thought they do with more Propriety as frequently at these Meetings whole Families are entirely  routed  out of House and Home  SOUI It was formerly believed that in each human Creature there existed something incorruptible which was not to perish with the Dissolution of our Bodies but to be removed to some other Part of the Universe and there to enjoy the Reward due to Virtue or suffer condign Punishment for all Transgressions while in this State of Probation But the happy Discovery of the Properties of Matter has also banished this absurd Doctrine which serves now to embellish the Fictions of Poets  IMMENSE an Epithet of Praise thus we say  an immense fine Woman  c  vide  Damned    VIRTUE The antient  Druids  made it a Rule to keep all their Passions in due Government by which Mean they were never known to prejudice their Neighbours or hurt their own Constitutions by Intemperance and this Practice it is probable was signified by the Word  Virtue  It is used by  Shakespear Spencer Milton Pope  and other Poets as a pretty Ornament for their romantic Performances Vide  Friendship  PITY This is also an old  English

of the Expression He did not understand how a bad Play could have fine Poetry and he has formed a Plan for a Set of Papers which may throw some Light on this Matter I shall this Day present my Readers with one which I think may serve as an Opening to the Design  In order to decide upon the Excellence or Imperfection of any Art it is necessary to know the original Intent and Aim of that Art and also the several Means by which it accomplishes its Designs The better to investigate this with regard to any Branch of Literature it will be expedient to trace all Manner of Composition to its Source and thence to pursue the several Rivulets which have streamed from it This has been done with great Perspicuity and Elegance by the Author of the Essays on the Characteristics who has very justly determined the three primary Branches of Composition to be  Poetry Eloquence  and  Argument  He adds that a just Coalition of the three forms the consummate Beauty of fine Writing and then continues  he  it would be perhaps both a new and pleasing Speculation to point out the Writers in their several Kinds who have been most remarkably excellent or defective with Regard to the just Union of these three Species of Cemposition At present it must suffice to have hinted such a Criticism which the Reader may easily prosecute  Such a Criticism might distinguish the respective Graces of all Kinds of Writing and furnish the Criterions by which to judge of the proper Beauties of each different Species I shall now beg Leave to offer a few cursory Reflections on this Subject and in order to proceed with the greater Perspicuity shall attempt a short Account of the Rise of the three Modes of Writing already mentioned  Man being a sociable Creature it was necessary that certain Signs universally agreed upon should be used for the reciprocal Conveyance of his Ideas Sounds which we call Words were the quickest Vehicles and therefore grew into general Use According as our Stock of Ideas enIarged itself the Demand for Words became more extensive and as Societies were framed and People assembled by civil Policy Intercourse begot further Acquisitions and thus Language was daily enlarged But it being impossible that every distinct Idea should be expressed by a Term appropriated to it the Mind naturally had Recourse to the Faculty of Reason which compares distinguishes and separates the Ideas which have passed through the Senses or have been formed into different Combinations by the Power of Imagination By these Means a Similitude was discovered between sundry various Images and thence it followed that Things were expressed by borrowed Names on account of a Resemblance existing between them The Term thus transferred was called a  Metaphor  and as it happens in the commercial Intercourse of Mankind what was at firist introduced out of Necessity became in Process of Time an absolute Luxury  This the Poets soon perceived and as it was their Business to lead uncultivated Multitudes from their Huts and Dens by seizing their Imaginations with their Songs and Ballads the Metaphor soon appeared to them to be an effectual Means of painting Things in warmer Colours to the Fancy which is ever greatly delighted when any new and unforeseen Assemblage is offered to its View The Epithet which denotes the Qualities inherent in all Objects lent its auxiliary Aid and Poetry with these adventitious Ornaments became the Delight of Mankind  But the Matter did not rest here as Cities were multiplied and as States enlarged themselves artificial Passions began to operate Ambition then began to grasp at Power and Preeminence and  Envy Jealousy Revenge  and  Malice  sowed the Seeds of Discord and mutual Distrust and thus while they were distracted with intestine Commotions the adjacent States desirous of extending their Possessions made Inroads upon them In these Emergencies there was not Time for the measured Writer to produce his poetic Composition an immediate Address was requisite to influence the Passions of the Multitude and therefore Men of Genius came forth and destitute of Number addressed the People in humble Prose But here still the Attention was to be fixed and therefore they could not divest themselves of all the Properties of Poetry but continued to address themselves to the Imagination of their Auditors and thus to influence their Passions and perswade them to their own Good As the least Appearance of a Design upon their Understandings on these Occasions would totally defeat itself it thence resulted that all those ambitious Ornaments and all those gaudy Colourings which Poetry spreads so lavishly on every Subject were here introduced with a more sparing Hand and the Imagination was only addressed as it affords various Accesses to the Passions In this Manner Eloquence  deduced its being and was only a less luxuriant Kind of Poetry which endeavoured to practise the Arts of Persuasion and to win over the Passions of the People to its own End and Use  In Proportion as Mankind became enlightened as Arts and Manufactures encreased and as Science extended itself it was not enough that  Poetry  charmed with its graceful Combinations and that  Eloquence  awakened and agitated the Passions  Reason  began then to exert its Influence to look for Utility and Truth in every Composition and stripping away the Luxuriances of lavish Description it began cooly and dispassionately to consider every Thing that was offered Hence sprung the  Didactic  or the Argumentative  Demosthenes  was obliged to proceed by fair Deductions and as much as possible to conceal his Art from a People who were so polished that they would have despised those Arts of Persuasion which  Tully  practised with Success upon Minds less artful and less informed than the  Greeks  In this Manner it appears to me these three primary Branches of Composition arose in the World each being plainly deducible from the very Principles of our Constitution For as the Imagination is the warmest Faculty of the Soul  Poetry  whose principal Intent is to please is particularly addressed to this Power of Perception  Eloquence  though more chaste and reserved in its Embellishments strikes chiefly at the Passions and as they are then most powerfully excited when Fancy pictures strong Appearances of Good or Evil  Eloquence  is obliged to have Recourse to the Regions of Imagination in order to render its Colourings stronger and more glowing and further as the Province of  Reason  is to compare its Ideas and to form various Affirmations or Negations relative to them the  Didactic  is principally confined to this Province There are not in human Nature any other Inlets of Perception or any other Faculties of Sensation to which  the Art of a Writer could apply and therefore the Imagination the Passions and Reason are justly the three Springs of Composition But Men of Refinement and Reflection perceiving what a powerful Influence any one of these Branches of Writing has upon the Mind have thence inferred that the joint Force of all three united must carry the Power of Genius to still a greater Degree of Perfection and therefore in whatever Way they were engaged they have made it their Business to make Excursions into their Neighbours Territories and borrow thence several Improvements to heighten their Productions As for Instance in like Manner as  Eloquence  has learned from  Poetry  to warm and enliven the Imagination  Poetry  has marked the Influence of  Eloquence  on the Passions and has endeavoured to glide to the Heart through the same Inlets and both have also found it necessary to recommend themselves to  Reason  and have occasionally strengthened themselves with Insertions of the  Didactic  The reasoning Faculty has in its Turn perceived that a mere Train of Deductions would be too dry and therefore it takes Occasion to adorn itself with the Flowers of Imagination and in some Speculations it even endeavours to awaken the Passions  Hence then it appears that a Concurrence of the primary Branches of Writing is requisite in all Works of Genius but as there is some Danger of running Riot and making too frequent and unjustifiable Progresses into each others Territories it was necessary to fix the Boundaries of each Kind and to determine how far any one of them may indulge itself in its Approaches towards the others in order to preserve the essential Difference in every Composition to observe the proper Qualities and the just Colourings of each or as  Horace  has it  D  nctas servare vices operumque colores  There are in Nature but few original Colours and it is from the Meltings and Softenings of these into each other that all other Appearances to the Eye derive their Origin It is the fame in Writing the several Species of it which are now practised are Modes of  Poetry Eloquence  and  Argument  differently blended How far the Union is just shall be occasionally examined in a few detached Essays and by these Means we shall see the peculiar Merit of an  Epic Poem  a  Tragedy  a  Comedy  c and the Reader may at his Leisure carry the Research into several subordinate

of her Age immediately upon her Accession she dissolved her Parliament turned out of her PrivyCouncil every Person of Sense and Discretion and introduced in their Room a  French  HairCutter two Milliners a Chambermaid and many other Personages of equal Rank and Condition By the Advice of these Assistants she reigned with despotic Sway She heard the Complaints of her Slaves without ever feeling the least Propensity to a Redress of their Grievances which occasioned violent Heartburnings and at Length called forth a Shoal of Writers against her Government as generally happens in all political States when the supreme Power is abused A Number of Sonnetteers Libellers and Epigrammatists who  daily poured forth Treason against her Beauty and pronounced her born to enslave Mankind She had a very particular Pleasure in signing metaphorical Death Warrants for her Votaries and she looked upon the whole Race of Mankind formed to flatter her Vanity and to pay her Adoration She exacted Tributes of Admiration at such an exorbitant Rate that at last an  Hambden  arose who disputed with her a Contribution of Incences which she insisted upon This Proceeding opened the Eyes of the rest of her Subjects who all conspired to dethrone her in the twentythird Year of her Age and then fell the Tyrant  Maria  without one to lament her Fall after a short Reign of five Years in which she conquered with so wild a Rage as the Poet has it that with the universal Joy succeeded to her the fair  Elizabeth  whose Reign commenced like a mild Evening after the violent Scorching of a hot

Et simul jucunda idonea dicere Vitae  HOR  Nee satis est pulchra esse Poemata dulcia sunto  Et quoeunque volent animum auditoris agunto  HOR  _THE Author of my Motto was one of the best Crities the World has ever produced and he has in the above Lines comprised the three principal Qualities of Poetry Its Aim says he is to afford at once Utility and Delight to offer what may be agreeable to the Fancy and also what may conduce to the Advantages of human Life He further adds it is not enough for a Poem to abound in Prettynesses it must also have a sweet Access to the Heart and should be able to agitate the Soul with what Passions it pleases This Description involves all the leading Requisites of Poetry and it is  remarkable includes the three primary Branches of Composition exhibited in a former Paper  viz  the Art of addressing our  Reason  in order to be useful the Imagination to be agreeable and the Passions in order to persuade and gain upon our Affections Here then we have  Poesy Eloquence  and  Argument  united and most assuredly that Performance will be found the most excellent in its Kind which is the most highly finished with Regard to these three Essentials  Epic  Poetry has always had the Preeminence and I suppose the Reason of this Determination is because it affords the freest and most ample Room for a Display of the three primary and original Species of Writing It is by observing how these friendly Colours mix and blend with each other that we are to deduce a Judgment upon the different Authors who have proved any Way eminent in the literary World refering to the first Principles being the only Criterion in every Art  Bossu  and other Critics have informed us that the epic Fable must involve one entire Action that this Action must have a Beginning a Middle and an End They have told us that the Poet must not take up the Thread of his Narrative too near the Clue but that he must hasten into the Midst of Things and occasionally give a Retrospect to such Things as are necessary to be known They have treated largely of the Machinery of the Time the Fable should include with many other Particulars which though proper to be explained do not any Way conduce to the Refinement of Taste or the Improvement of true Genius It is most certain by observing from what Principles in the human Frame each Art is deducible that any real or valuable Criticism can be formed  It is manifest then that the Epic Writer has free Latitude of inserting all the Graces of every Kind of Composition All Nature lies at his Command whereever  he casts his Eyes he is Lord of the Manor he can turn a Road by poetical Act of Parliament through Lawns and Groves and Scenes of Pasturage the four Seasons obey his Directions and he need never be at a Loss for agreeable Exhibitions of Nature to please the Imagination The whole System of Ethics is also his he may frequently take occasion to improve his Readers by short Sentences and transient Reflections on human Life and by these Means he may gain upon our Reason to approve his Performances The whole Art of Eloquence is likewise perfectly open to the Epic Author and from thence he may derive an irresistible Power over our Passions In this last mentioned Requisite the  Abbé du Bos  places the consummate Persection of fine Poetry Certain it is the Mind of Man never feels such intense Pleasure from any of the imitative Arts as when its Passions are awakened and it finds itself roused from an impassive State and unexpectedly agitated by the skilful Touches of a Masterpoet The Author just quoted ascribes this ideal Appearance to the Satisfaction which the Soul enjoys at the Perception of its own Activity May we not add to this what is suggested if I remember right by the Author of  The Pleasure of the Imaginations  "Our moral Sense receives on the Occasion an additional Delight to see that the social Affections are in Harmony' and Proportion and feelingly awake to the due Sensations of Humanity and this in Conjunction with the Gratifications which we are apt to take in comparing the Ideas which Reality has suggested with those excited by the Art of Imitation conspire to render a warm and wellexecuted Passage in Poetry so agreeable to all Mankind in general"  Were I to declare in which of the three Powers of the Mind already mentioned I think  Homer Virgil  and  Milton  to be most eminently shining I should ascribe  to  Homer  the strongest and most vigorous Efforts of Imagination and an amazing Faculty of alarming us with noble and amazing Descriptions of all the magnificent Objects in Nature As to our own  Milton  I should be inclined to declare him a Rival of the  Greek  Poet for a comprehensive Sublimity of Conception and  Virgil  's Excellence I should place in beautiful Touches of poetic Eloquence His whole fourth Book I take to be a Masterpiece in this Way The various Agitations of Mind which  Dido  endures her Love her Jealousy her Rage her Tenderness her many mixed Emotions are perhaps the finest Strokes in Poetry In his sixth Book also there are several Scenes of the most tender Nature and in the ninth Book the Grief of the Mother after the Death of  Nisus  and  Euryalus  and the Lamentations of  Evander  are all to be ranked in the same Class and in my Opinion afford a Pleasure not to be met with in either of the other Poets even though  Homer  has succeeded so well in  Hector  's last Scene with  Andromache  and though our great  Milton  has a great Deal of finely impassionated Dialogue in his justly celebrated Poem  Virgil  more frequently applies himself to the Passions of his Readers than the other two and notwithstaneing some pretty strong Improbabilities he does not so frequently shock our Reason as the  Grecian  Poet who certainly in some Particulars is extravagant to the highest Degree  Milton  has the Advantage of having founded his Story upon Traditions which our Religion has sanctified otherwise I should consider his fallen Angels and the War waged by them together with the Invention of Cannon and many other Circumstances highly chimerical even though they expand our Fancy with grand and surprizing Appearances  I shall take another Opportunity to consider how far Tragedy may dispute with the Epic for the Preference  and shall only add at present that I have ever been of Opinion that all the Writers of heroic Poesy have in general been too fond of the Marvellous By this I would not be understood to censure the Use of Machinery which when introduced with Sobriety and Discretion serves to present agreeable Scenery to the Mind and I could wish that the Correctness of Mr  Glover  's Judgment had not entirely excluded it from his Poem of  Leonidas  which certainly has many Passages of warm poetic Eloquence many Pieces of beautiful Imagery and several Strictures of useful and improving Morality artfully interwoven with the Groundwork of his Fable  I shall beg leave to conclude with an Observation which is not entirely foreign to the Purpose It is remarked by Mr  Addison  that  Virgil  has but one Conceit throughout his Poem and that says he is put into the Mouth of the young  Julus  when with a Kind of punning Ambiguity he observes that they are eating their Tables But surely the great Critic had forgot the Passage where the Poet tells us that  Aeneas  in runuing round a Tree after the flying  Turnus  follows the Man who follows him  Sequiturque sequentem  This tried by the Rule of  Bohours  appears to have Truth for its Foundation but it is so childish a Truth that I am sorry to find it intermixed with the Majesty of the  Aeneid  but perhaps it is like the Fly on the Picture which a minute Observer was going to brush away and then found it was placed there on purpose by the Hand of

Jeweller of  Cairo  and having at length by an amazing Parsimony got together a few Sequins of Gold he followed the Occupation of his Master Affairs thrived so well with him that in the Course of a few Years  Mirgehan  began to assume to himself the Pride of Wealth and his Countenance which formerly was humbled by Poverty and a Dejection of Spirits began to brighten into Gleams of SelfSatisfaction In order to extend his Interest and enlarge his Schemes for the Accumulation of Wealth  Mirgehan  now basking under the Sunshine of his Fortune resolved to remove to  Bafra  where he was soon distinguished as the most eminent Merchant of the Place As it is the Nature of Ambition to be ever restless and unsatisfied after having in the Course of six Years Residence amassed a very ample Fortune he determined with himself to change his Abode once more and settle himself with all his immense Wealth at  Bagdad  Mingehan  was no sooner fixed at  Bagdad  than the Reputation  of his Affluence spread itself abroad In all convivial Meetings among the rest of the Merchants as soon as his Lips seemed to open every Tongue was suspended with Silence every Eye gazed at him with Admiration and every Ear devoured the Periods of his Story with greedy Earnestness His Voice which naturally was as rough as the Sound occasioned by a Collision of Billows on the Ocean now seemed as fost as the fragrant Gale which pants upon the Leaves of the  Arabian  Trees  By this Time  Mirgehan  's Credit was become so extensive that People of all Ranks and Conditions deposited their Money with him and he had every Day a very great Number of Servants counting over the Sequins of Gold which he was either to receive or pay away for others In the Midst of all these Smiles of Fortune it happened that the Relict of a rich Merchant lately snatched away from the Face of the Earth by the Angel of Death attracted his Attention Her Name was  Dardanè  born in the City of  Damas  and now in the Possession of very great Wealth From the Habits which Education and Time had implanted in her she was in her Temper of a most greedy Avarice and a powerful Ambition to be counted richer than the rest of her Acquaintance urged by these Instigations she bestowed her lovely Form upon  Mirgehan  who in a short Time so contrived it that the Roses faded on her Cheek the Lilly appeared of a yellower Hue and by flow Degrees her Constitution received such severe Strokes from his Severity that she totally pined away and in a short Time lay breathless on her Bed  Mirgehan  was now happy in the Completion of his Wishes he had got rid of a Wife whom notwithstanding her exquisite Beauty his Soul ever abhorred and he exulted in the Review of the vast Accession to his Fortune which through her Means he had obtained  His Heatt now began to expand with greater Alacrity and he resolved to spend the Remainder of his Days in Ease in Elegance in Luxury and every delicate Enjoyment The Dainties of the East did not suffice to crown his Board he would send to the West for  Turtle  and every Corner of the Globe administred to his Gratifications Not far from  Bagdad  he purchased a most elegant and magnificent House where he determined to fix his country Retreat The Rooms eternally resounded with Singers and Minstrels Amber and Aloes contributed their rich Perfumes and his Tables were covered with Vases of Agate filled with the most delicious Liquors Painting and Sculpture concurred to adorn his Apartments  Mirgehan  was led into all this Profusion by an irresistible Vanity from which he derived many exquisite Sensations of Pleasure when he found his Wealth and his Possessions admired he the more readily suffered himself to be governed by this Turn of Mind from a Conviction that all his grand Appearance of Affluence served to extend his Reputation and that in Consequence of his extensive Credit he should have ample and frequent Opportunities of reimbursing himself by the Use he knew to make of the pecuniary Confidence which others reposed in him  Mirgehan  was now happy in all the Enjoyments which Riches could procure him his Heart danced to perpetual Tunes of Joy and the Meanness of his Birth he thought sufficiently compensated by the Lustre and Dignity of his present Way of Life And now to compleat his Elevation and to raise himself to that Point of Eminence from which he imagined he might look down upon most of his FellowCreatures Fortune who had for a Series of Years smiled propitiously upon all the Undertakings of  Mirgehan  at length presented an Opportunity  It happened that the Emperor of  Bagdad  had Occasion on a particular Emergence in his Affairs to call together an Assembly of the wisest and ablest Heads in his Territories in order to assist his Councils to help him in framing salutary Laws for the due Regulation of his Subjects and to point out proper Measures for him to levy the Monies necessary towards defraying the Expences of his Soldiers and other Contingences in Government The  Califf  resolved upon this Step with the Advice of his  Vizir  and in a few Days Mandates were dispatched to sundry different Parts commanding the Provinces and Towns to depute to the general Divan two Persons the most renowned for Sagacity and Judgment  Mirgehan  was at his CountrySeat when he heard this News and his Passions being violent as the eddying Sand during a Tempest he instantly conceived a Desire to be enrolled among the most distinguished Politicians of  Bagdad  Accordingly he forthwith set out upon this Expedition but he had not gone far from his own Habitation when travelling a solitary Road over a long extended Mountain the Heat of the Day together with the Fatigue he had undergone inclined him to stop under a shady Retreat and refresh his Senses with a gentle Slumber From this he was soon awakened by a Strain of Musick which thrilled so melodiously in his Ears that he thought Gleams of Paradise were opening to his dazled Sight He looked around and saw a reverend Form advance towards him  Mirgehan  arose from the Arbour in which he was reclined and instantly throwing himself on his Knees he worshipped the venerable Appearance which stood before him This Personage was an holy Hermit who long inhabited a small Mansion on the Side of a Rock which terminated the Prospect on the left Side of the Mountain Being endowed with a magic Power he called forth to his Sight such  beautiful Scenes as looked like a new Creation  Mirgehan  's Heart throbbed with holy Rapture At length the hoary Sage began  Mirgehan  I know thy Purpose I am acquainted with thy Design in this thy Journey But reflect O Man on the Obscurity of thy Birth and the Meanness of thy Education Canst thou confer Light to the Councils of the Wise Canst thou dispel the Mist from before their Eyes and let in powerful Irradiations of Truth upon their darkling Understandings Desist vain Man from thy illfounded Pursuits  At these Words the venerable Hermit waved his Wand and suddenly the Scene vanished like a MorningDream from  Mirgehan  's Eyes After having again raised his Arm  Now says he let the Objects that are placed before thee instruct thy Soul there behold how easily thou mightest have squandered away all those Possessions which thy Soul delights in for a mere empty Bubble There see an Election for two Persons to assist in the Debates for the Ease and Happiness of the Califf and his People see the Blind the Lame the Old the Infirm the Sick arriving in Caravans to vote for those who pay them highest See how they all solemnly vow by the holy Prophet that Money has no Influence upon them and yet behold how in private they grasp the Sequins of Gold Does not thy Heart which has fixed all its

ponit Athenis  HOR  _THERE is not a Species of Writing which has not had its particular Admirer and various Affirmations have been made concerning the Excellence of each The famous Doctor  South  was of Opinion that a complete Epigram is the Masterpiece of Composition and Mr  Addison  calls a  perfect Tragedy the noblest Production of Human Nature  The Truth of it is each Person has delivered his Sentiments agreeably to his own private Temper and his own peculiar Turn of Thinking Doctor  South  excelled in lively and surprizing Strokes of Wit every new Combination which he formed in the vivacious Sallies of his Imagination was Epigram in itself and we find all his Writings sown extremely thick with unexpected Assemblages and on  this Account we may suppose him inclinable to extol his own favourite Talent In like Manner Mr  Addison  had employed many of his Hours in planning his Tragedy of  Cato  and after it had received the most consummate Polish which his Skill could bestow upon it it was to be exhibited as the greatest Production of human Wit But the Assertions of great Men when they are unsustained by Argument are not to be considered as Decrees from which there can be no Appeal Tragedy most certainly can only claim the second Place because it is manifest that all the Powers of Genius  viz Imagination Eloquence  and  Reason  may be exerted in their full Force in the Epic Composition whereas in Tragedy they frequently suffer great Limitation The same Thing which on many Occasions makes Tragedy the most powerful Performance serves also to divest it of those Advantages which give great Brilliancy to heroic Poesy and that is its coming immediately before the Eye It is justly remarked by  Horace  that what is conveyed to our Notice through our Ears acts with a more feeble Impulse upon the Mind than Objects that pass through the Organs of Sight those faithful Evidences in a mental Court of Judicature  Segnius irritant animos demissa per Aurem  Quam quae sunt Oculis subjecta fidelibus quae  Ipse sibi tradit Spectator  For this Reason many Passages in which the Epic Wrietr warms and expands the Imagination of his Readers with the noblest Exhibitions of poetic Imagery are entirely excluded from the dramatic Scene the Eye will not suffer itself easily to be deluded and all the Amazement of Machinery is also for the same Reason totally superseded A God says the Critic should  not be introduced unless the Occasion should peremptorily require a supernatural Agent he had said better if he had absolutely interdicted the Appearance We may in reading suffer such an Incident to be imposed upon us but the Eye would be too much shocked with such Representations and of Course the Marvellous is entirely banished Besides Tragedy will not admit any extraordinary Display of  pure Poetry  or Description the heroic Poet for the most Part speaks in his own Person and it is expected of him to pay great Court to our Imagination but the Dialogue of Personages engaged in a Sphere of Action intended to interest the Auditors will not allow them to take up the Scene with florid Exhibitions of rural Imagery such as Brooks murmuring in scanty Rills through pebbled Channels  c  The following Lines in the Mouth of  Calista  in the  Fair Penitent  may be extremely picturesque if considered as pure Description but if considered with regard to the Situation of Character they are certainly very inartificial and undramatic  my sad Soul  Has form'd a dismal melancholy Scene  An unfrequented Vale o'er grown with Trees  Mossy and old within whose lonesome Shade  Ravens and Birds illomen'd only dwell  No Sound to break the Silence but a Brook  That bubbling winds among the Weeds  Hence then we find that in the Regions of Fancy the  Drama  must yield to the Epic and as this is a very considerable Part of Poesy I think it determines the Precedence In the Art of Eloquence and in all Applications to our Reason Tragedy can boast full Room for the most vigorous Exertion The  Drama  may be full as sentimental as any other Kind of Writings  nay its Excellence frequently consists in being so and with Regard to the Passions the Mode of Imitation renders its Influence more forcible and when we are deceived into a Notion that the Personages are actually suffering Distress before our Eyes the Performance assumes a Kind of Reality and more keen and intenser Sensations agitate our Breasts than in Pieces where the Description is left to operate upon us without any other Aid than that of lively and impassioned Expressions  Virgil  I apprehend was as skilful a Master of the Passions as any Writer ancient or modern and though the Passions of his  Dido  are drawn with as strong and glowing Colourings as Language can bestow though their various strugglings are all finely and closely marked though all their Vicissitudes Veerings and Doublings if I may so call them are finely touched yet I believe  Shakespear  's  Lear  and  Othello  have made much more lively and deep Impressions upon an Audience than ever the former has done upon his Admirers in the Closet  These Advantages however are derived to the tragic Queen from supernumerary Embellishments and from the Labours of another Art I mean that of acting which is in itself a Mode of Imitation and serves to render the Touches of the Writer more striking and more feelingly expressive This Superiority the Drama certainly has over the Epic and in Consequence of all its additional Aids it can boast a more powerful Command over the human Heart It imitates the very Voice of Nature and speaks the same simple and affecting Language All that Profusion of Figures which mere Poetry admits is discarded from the Stage When I mention Figures I must observe that Men of critical Knowledge have justly distinguished between Figures of Speech and Figures of the Sentiment the former  including Metaphor and all Transtations of Phrases and the latter consisting of such Breaks and Transitions in Discourse as the Mind is known to make when under the Compunction of warring Passions As for Instance when the Poet says of  Dido  that she is devoured by an inward Flame  Et caeco carpitur igne  He then expresses Love by a sigurative Expression but when he says  Ignoscenda  quidem scirent si  ignoscere  manes  The Repetition expresses the natural workings of the Mind when other Ideas are awakened and serve to excite a new Conflict of Passions The use of these kind of Figures in Tragedy should be as free and bold as possible and with Respect to Expression no other Regard is to be paid to it than to chuse such Words as may be most significantly picturesque in order to have the more lively Effect on the Imagination the Passions being then in a stronger Ferment when lively Images are presented to the Fancy  I believe our  Shakespear  is almost the only Poet who has excelled in a masterly Power of striking the  Imagination  the  Heart  and our  Reason  all at once but in him Poetry Sentiment and Passion are combined in the most agreeable Assemblage In his Tragedy of  Macbeth  there are several surprizing Strokes of this  Nature  Amidst a great Variety of Instances the following Lines are introduced with a Solemnity suitable to the Occasion and they carry with them a pleasing Kind of gloomy Imagery  E'er the Bat hath flown  His cl  sier'd Flight e'er to black  Hecate  's Summons  The Shardborn Beetle with his drouzy Hums  Hath rung Night's yawning Peal there shall be done  A Deed of dreadful Note  The Soliloquy in the TentScene of  Richard the Third  is also a further Instance of the same Beauty though by the Way it may not be improper to observe notwithstanding we must allow that Mr  Cibber  was in the right to transplant  Shakespear  's own Words that they are not perfectly suitable to the Character of  Richard  and I believe had our great Poet thought of shewing his Hero in this Situation he would have shewed  Richard  's Feelings quite otherwise on such an Occasion  To conclude  Aristotle  was certainly mistaken when he called the Fable the Life and Soul of Tragedy the Art of constructing the dramatic Story should always be subservient to the Exhibition of Character our great  Shakespear  has breathed another Soul into Tragedy which has found the Way of striking an Audience with Sentiment and Passion at the same Time

Constitution I have not met with any one that seems to be thoroughly acquainted with the Subject An ingenious Friend of mine who furnished me with an Essay some Time since reduces our present PartyDivisions into  Garrickeans  and  Barryists  but this is not going to the Bottom of Things The famous  Montesquien  has performed in my humble Apprehension as little towards a Detection of the Root of the Evil tho' he seems to perceive with a Kind of prophetic Spirit the Declension of  British  Liberty The great  Locke  who has treated in a very masterly Manner of Government does not any where give us a Clue to guide our Research and after glowing with  Bolingbroke  through a Number of Pages we are as much in the Dark as ever  England  can never be undone but by a Parliament says the excellent Author of  the Use and abuse of Parliaments  but even there we are again put upon a wrong Scent The Truth of the Matter is ENGLAND CAN NEVER BE UNDONE BUT BY THE MOB I am aware this may at first Sight appear a Paradox but a Retrospect to the Behaviour of that Body of People will convince every intelligent Mind of the Truth of this Assertion  The Generality of political Writers have wasted a great Deal of Paper in settling the various Forms of Government one say they is a Monocracy another is an Aristocracy a third is a Democracy and the  British  Constitution they inform us is of the mixed Species  consisting of a Coalition of all three But furely a little Observation will point out to us that they have all passed by unnoticed another Mode of civil Policy which cannot be called by a better Name than a  Mobocracy  under which this Country has been for many Years past and in all human Probability will continue so for a long Period still to come nay I will be bold to say until Monocracy Aristocracy and Democracy are all swallowed up by this alone  There is hardly ever a Bill brought before the honourable the House of Commons but the Scope of it is immediately canvassed in an Assembly of the  Mobocracy  where if it passes in the Negative a Deputation is forthwith sent by them to the ParliamentHouse where though their Remonstrances are not heard at the Bar they nevertheless enforce their Arguments with such a truly  British  Eloquence that they never fail to have a due Degree of Influence upon the Debates within Doors On these Occasions they generally make use of a Rule of Logick which indeed is not mentioned by  Aristotle  but which is always found of great Efficacy in all Disputes The Mode of Reasoning I mean is the  Argumentum Boculinum  a nervous Exertion of which accompanied with all the Force of the most vigorous Lungs has over ruled many an intended Act when it happens not to please in the Councils of the common People The  Mobecracy  have further the legislative and executive Part of their Laws in their own Hands and we find them very frequent in a diligent Attention to them For Instance though the common Law of  England  has provided a proper Punishment for Pickpockets The  Mobocracy  has reconsidered that Matter and after mature Deliberation have devised a Correction in their Opinion more adequate to the Offence and whenever any one is found to incur the Penalty of their Law they immediately proceed to Execution without Judge or Jury which in their Apprehension serve but to retard  the Course of Justice and therefore they seize the Delinquent and without Delay duck him in the River the Canal in St  James  's Park or the next Pool of Water On all these Occasions it is observable that they take infinite Delight in seeing the proper Punishment inflicted as may be observed from the Acclamations the Huzzas  c  wherewith their Burst of Joy rends the Air In like Manner the Pillory is some Times ordained by the Statute Law of  England  in order to expose such Transgressors as deserve to be set up the Marks of public Shame on every Occurrence of this Nature Wisdom is sure to cry out in the Streets and the award of the Judges is determined by a popular Circle to be just or unjust When once they have pronounced Sentence the Person doomed to make his Appearance is sure either to meet with their Protection or to call forth the utmost Indignation of an incensed Populace Nay it has been known that these perpetual Dictators have proceeded so far as to rescue Felons condemned to suffer Death from the Hands of the proper Officers and generously to have recalled the DeathWarrant In many Parts of  England  they have an implacable Aversion to Turnpikes and it is said they will never be at Rest until they have entirely demolished those disagreeable Passports I remember to have heard a Story of these People which I think may serve to give the Reader a tolerable Idea of their arbitrary Power Not very long since three  Indian  Kings came to visit this Metropolis and after they had seen most Places of Curiosity a Play was at length advertized by Command of their  Indian  Majesties The  Mobocracy  who have entirely exploded all Notions of the Right Divine of Kings and who in Fact consider crowned Heads as no more than common Men took care to attend at the TheatreRoyal in  DruryLane  in order to survey the swarthy Monarchs At length the Curtain drew up but in vain did the Players attempt to begin the Diversion of  the Night The  Mobocracy  who had Possession of the Upper Gallery declared that they came to see the Kings  and since we have said our Money the Kings we will have  Whereupon Mr  Wilks  who was then one of the Patentees came forth and assured them that the Kings were in the FrontBox to this the  Mobocracy  replied that they could not see them there and defired that they should be placed in a more conspicuous point of View  otherwise by Gd  Jack  there shall be no Play  Mr  Wilks  who was not in his Heart of Mobocratical Principles yet loved his own Interest so well that he always knew how to be an occasional Conformist assured them that he had nothing so much at Heart as their Happiness and accordingly got three Chairs and placed the Kings on the Stage to the no small Satisfaction of the  Mobocracy  with whom it is a Maxim to have as much as possible for their Money From hence it appears that the Power of the Multitude is perfectly Dictatorial and indeed in all Ages the Managers of Playhouses have acquiesced under the GalleryJurisdiction Mr  Garrick  I am credibly informed notwithstanding the submissive Bows he occasionally makes them is not entirely reconciled to their Government and it is said is very apt to quote certain treasonable Words from  Horace  implying that the Vulgar have no claim to Insallibility  Interdum Vulgus Rectum videt est ubi peccat  My Intelligence further adds that he has suppressed many Schemes for adding Novelty to the Amusements of the Public from a Fear he has conceived of the manyheaded Monster of the Gallery nay he will at Times carry Matters so far as to pronounce their Behaviour illegal arbitrary  c  and when they broke all the Windows of his DwellingHouse so discontented a Spirit possessed him that he would by no Means acknowledge the Justice of their Proceedings  Be that as it may it is certain one dissaffected Person cannot withstand the  Mobocratical  Power which it  is manifest has gained great Strength of late Years and I am persuaded will continue to flourish more and more every Day They have many wise Maxims by which they govern themselves such as "no wooden Shoes" "Liberty and Property and no Excise"  no  French  Dancers  "no Mounseers"Let every Man toast his own Cheese  c  such prudential Axioms founded on the soberest Sense must undoubtedly contribute to render their Administration both wise and prosperous It does not appear that they have made any great Progress in the modern Art of War on the contrary there is Reason to suppose that they all hold it in Contempt as it is certain that on many Occasions when our mixed Form of Government has endeavoured to oppose them by sending the Soldiery against them they have always laughed at the Military Force and repelled them from the Assault without their daring to Fire Their Military Discipline seems to be derived from the  Romans  they know no Use of Cannon FireArms  c  but proceed to Battle with Sticks Bludgeons setting up loud Shouts somewhat like the Warhoop of the  Indians  and hurling Stones Brickbats Bottles Glasses  c  with tremendous Force on the adverse Party They are likewise totally Strangers to all Resinements of modern Luxury Bread and Cheese and Porter being their chief Sustenance Gin being only used by them when they are lowspirited or are going to be hanged They do not paint their Bodies with Woad like the ancient  Britons  but generally with KennelDirt which lends them a formidable Air in Battle Thus enured to Danger it will be no wonder if the  Mobocracy  at length becomes Masters of this Kingdom which as I conceive it must shortly be the Case unless the Vices of People of Fashion should descend to them and retard them in their Progress Of this I must own I am inclined to cherish some Hopes as I am informed that in some Parts of the Town they drink  and game and swear and are full as wicked as the better Sort of People Particularly in  Hockly the Hole  I am told that they have a Place called  White  's Chocolatehouse that  clean Lodgings for

tanto  Plus oneris quanto est veniae minus  HOR  _A Ristotle  informs us that  Homer  wrote a ComicEpic Poem entitled  Margites  which to the no small Detriment of succeeding Ages is unfortunately lost To this Species of Poesy we may suppose Comedy has the same Reference that the Tragic bears to the Heroic For my Part I cannot conceive why a good Comedy has never been stiled by those who are fond of deciding literary Precedence the greatest Production of human Nature Certainly its consisting of known and familiar Ideas should not derogate from its Merit because on Account of that very Circumstance it meets with less Indulgence the Business of it coming more near to every Man's Breast and of Course the very Vulgar being in some Measure Judges of the Justness of the Imitation whereas in Tragedy frigid Declamation lulls florid Epithets amuse lofty Metaphors amaze and sonorous Expressions elevate and surprize  As Tragedy aims more particularly at an Excitement of the serious Passions so the chief Merit of  Comedy  consists in its Effect on the merry Affections of the human Mind the former principally awakening Sensations of Terro and Pity and the latter giving Emotions of a gay Contempt as it is elegantly called or in plainer  English  making us despise and laugh at an Object at the same Time To succeed in this last mentioned Mode of Writing it requires as fine and as lively  an Imagination as any of the other imitative Arts for as it is manifest that the Tragic Poet then excites in us the most intense Sensations when his Expressions convey the liveliest Images to the Fancy so the Comic Poet when he seizes the Imagination with a bright Assemblage of ludicrous Ideas is sure of agitating those Passions to which his Art directs him with an irresistible Power And therefore this Animadversion is sufficient to put an End to that idle Dispute which as we learn from  Horace  engaged the Learned  viz  Whether Comedy might be called Poetry or not  quidam Comoedia necne Poema  Esset quaesivere  It is manifest that it is an imitative Art and different Passions being the Objects of its Address it only makes use of Means different from the more elevated Species of Writing but surely it is full as hard a Task to paint ordinary Things as Objects of more Importance and in my Opinion  Virgil  's Line which describes an old Woman running across  Dido  's Apartment with officious Zeal  Illa gradum studio celerabat anili  Is as picturesque and has as much Merit as the Description of the ambrosial Locks of  Venus  Ambrosiaeque comae divinum vertice odorem  Spiravere  The Comic Writer as well as the Tragedian must derive his Force from the true primary Sources of Composition that is to say he must learn to seize our  Imaginations  with striking Pictures of human Life he must instruct our Reason by inserting sensible Observations on worldly Contingencies and he must also frequently apply himself to those Passions which it is the Merit of his Art to awaken In this last mentioned  Particular consists the real Merit of a well wrought Comedy in like Manner as the serious Drama must fill us with Ideas proper to excite Terror and Pity To obtain either Effect the Poet is to select such Circumstances in every Object in every Passion and in every Action as will be most conducive to his peculiar End and he is constantly to avail himself of such Expressions as will serve to convey the liveliest Images to the Fancy When this is rightly performed whether in the solemn or humourous Scene it is true Poetry and in either case it is by the Means of a Mode of Eloquence that the Art produces its desired Effect For Ridicule by which Comedy works is as much a Mode of Eloquence as the several Arts of Persuasion and the several Figures which Rhetoric has reduced into a System for the Excitement of the more serious Passions  The Dispute that subsisted among the Learned for a considerable Time and is perhaps not yet determined  viz  Whether Ridicule is a Test of Truth is in my humble Opinion extremely idle and frivolous the Faculty of Reason which compares our Ideas and fustains or rejects the various Affirmations concerning them being the sole Judge of Truth however complicated the Means may be by which it gains its End I have often wondered that neither  Aristotle Tully  nor  Quintilian  have given a just and adequate Desinition of Ridicule To say that it consists in raising our Laughter at some Turpitude is a very insufficient Account of the Matter Mr  Fulding  in his Preface to his  Joseph Andrews  has thrown some Light upon the Matter but as he places the Source of it in Affectation he appears to me not to have taken a comprehensive Survey of his Subject I apprehend the Ridiculous may be formed where there is no Affectation at the Bottom and his Parson  Adams  I take to be an Instance of this Assertion  The best and most accurate Desinition I have ever met with of the Ridiculous is in a Note of Doctor  Akenside  's to his excellent Poem  on the Pleasures of Imagination  That says he which makes Objects ridiculous is some Ground of Admiration or Esteem connected with other more general Circumstances comparatively worthless or deformed or it is some Circumstances of Turpitude or Deformity connected withwhat is in general excellent or beautiful the inconsistent Properties existing either in the Objects themselves or in the Apprehension of the Person to whom they relate implying Sentiment or Design and exciting no acute or vehement Emotion of the Heart  The Effect which the Circumstances thus specified have upon us he thus desines  the Sensation of Ridicule is not a bare Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement of Ideas but a Passion or Emotion of the Mind consequential to that Perception  The Emotions here intended are Laughter and Contempt and these it is the Business of Comedy to excite by making striking Exhibitions of inconsistent Circumstances blended together in such a thwarting Assemblage that a gay Contempt irressistibly shall take possession of us To perform this in all Objects which come before the Comic Muse in Men and Manners in all Actions and Passions requires a very delicate Hand and it frequently is necessary to have an almost microscopic Eye to perceive the latent Inconsistency in Circumstances seemingly fair and praiseworthy  Prion  has expressed this with his usual Delicacy  And tho' the Error may be such  As  Knaggs  and  Burgess  cannot hit  It yet may feel the nicer Touch  Of  Wycherly  or  Congreve'  s Wit  In producing Portraits of Mankind it is not enough to display Foibles and Oddities a fine Vein of Ridicule must run through the whole to urge the Mind to  frequent Emotions of Laughter otherwise there will be Danger of exhibiting disagreeable Characters without affording the proper Entertainment I think  Ben Johnson  extremely apt to err in this Point his  Morose  is a surly illnatured absurd Humourist whom we can hardly laugh at and he soon becomes very bad Company Many of  Johnson  's Characters are of the same Cast while in  Shakespear  's  Falstaff  the ridiculous Ideas are placed in such an artful Point of View that our Merriment can never be restrained whenever Sir  John  appears  Congreve  in my Opinion had a great Deal of the same Talent and what I have somewhere seen objected to him that many of his Characters are obvious in human Life is with me a strong Proof of his superior Genius An Old  Batchelor  for Instance is very common but he must pass through such an Imagination as  Congreve  's to support several Scenes in the Drama with the most exquisite Pleasantry tho' the Character was not new yet his Management of it has all the Graces of Novelty and the Situations in which we see him are all exquisitely ridiculous Personages of this Class unless artfully conducted may very soon tire an Audience but in this excellent Poet's Hands nothing suffers a Diminution The same I think appears in his Sir  Paul Plyant  in which Character there is perhaps as much Comic Force as in any one Piece on the Stage Sir  John Vanbrugh  was also a perfect Master of his Art in this Respect and of this his Sir  John Brute  is a remarkable Proof The Knight is constantly diverting us with an odd whimsical Way of Thinking which at once serves to display his own Foibles and entertains his Audience with a Pleasantry of which he seems all along totally unconscious himself  It is therefore by placing the Humours and Foibles of human Nature in a ridiculous Light that the true Comic Force is created The Author of  the Pleasures of Imagination  whom I have already quoted has judiciously  explained each Part of the Desinition cited above and has finely traced the several Sources from which true Ridicule springs Whoever chuses to consider the Matter will find Affectation to be but one Spring however diffusive the Streams of it may be To the Poem itself I beg leave to refer my Readers and I shall dismiss this Paper with observing that the whole Beauty of the Comic Diction consists in the Words and Phrases being so chosen as to give to the Mind the most lively Impression of known and familiar Images and at the same Time the strongest Marks of Character and each Person's peculiar Temper  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Bedford Coffeehouse  Aug    THOUGH the Barometer for Wit and

of Writing which on Account of some Affinity between them is often supposed to be the same with the Ridiculous and yet upon an attentive View of the Matter it appears to be a Mode of Composition introduced by Men of Genius in order to fall in with that Propensity to Laughter which prevails with all Mankind in general What I here intend is  Burlesque  to mark its Boundaries its Procedure and Extent will be no improper Subject among these Essays which only pretend now and then to glance so much Light upon Matters of this Nature as may serve to illustrate them to the Unlearned  It must be

to call forth this Inconsistency to public View and to shew the heterogeneous Assemblage in such a Manner as to provoke the Mind to laugh at it with Contempt is to exert the rare and excellent talent of  Ridicule  and as this when well executed is attended with fine consequential Effects the Lovers of  Burlesque  will not wait to discover a real Incongruity but by the Force of their own Imaginations they create it for themselves and by  obtruding Circumstances which perhaps do not belong to the Object they are frequently very successful in rendering Things apparently ridiculous which to an attentive Eye may not wear the motly Livery however it may serve the Purposes of Mirth to invest it with it In order to explain more fully what is here insisted on it may not be improper to lay before the Reader a few Instances of the  Ridiculous  and also of  Burlesque  which may in some Measure serve to render this Matter still more intelligible and clear  When  Fielding  's Parson  Adams  in Distress at an Inn retires very gravely with a  London  Bookseller to raise Money upon some Manuscript Sermons I believe the dissonant Circumstances in this Case strike very forcibly and our Laughter is still urged with greater Impetuosity when after having travelled a great many Miles from his own Place of Abode towards  London  with no other Business upon Earth but to dispose of these Sermons we hear the Parson not being able to find them very gravely say  I protest I believe I left them behind me  When the same Personage assures us that he is very rich and then adds that he does not say it by way of boasting or complying with worldly Vanity but to shew that he can live well on the Road and to confirm this produces half a Guinea the Difference between his Opinion and the small Value of the Piece and this too from a Clergyman a Scholar and in many Things a Man of excellent Understanding produces an Emotion of Laughter attended in this Instance with a Contempt for  Adams  's Want of Knowledge of the World In like manner when  Don Quixote  very gravely says that he has seen the Sea and that it is much larger than the River at  La Mancha  we cannot help laughing at a Man who has formed his Ideas of Things by what he has seen at his own native Place and to find an insignisicant River compared to the Sea  presents such a repugnant Conjunction of Images as must necessarily operate upon our risible Faculties  These Instances which have first among a Thousand offered themselves to my Memory are true Instances of the  Ridiculous  nothing here being obtruded upon our Imaginations but in  Burlesque  there are many adventitious Ideas called up in order to form a motly Concurrence of thwarting Images and so produce the same Effect with the really  Ridiculous  As for Instance if any Object which comes before the  Burlesque  Writer be low in its own Nature he immediately bethinks himself of conferring on it a mock Dignity in which it begins to look big like the Champion at a Coronation who boldly challenges all Mankind when he knows no Body will fight him I have ever been highly pleased with a Touch of this Kind in a Note to Mr  Fielding  's  Tom Thumb  where mentioning something of the Soul of Man he gravely tells us  Plato  is of this Opinion and so is Mr  Banks  The Stroke in the  Beggar  's  Opera  is of the same Nature  There is nothing so moving as a great Man in Distress  In this Case the great Disproportion between the two Objects strikes our Imagination and our Laughter bursts out at that which is without Foundation set in Competition In the following Passage of the Poet it seems to me there is a ridiculous Appearance intended by giving a mock Majesty to an Object in the general Opinion not so highly exalted  Oh could I view thro'  London  as I pass  Some broad Sir  Balaam  in  Corinthian  Brass  High on a  Pedestal  ye Freemen place  His magisterial Paunch and griping Face  Letter'd and gilt let him  adorn  Cheapside  And grant the  Tradesman  what a  King's  deny'd  Thus the ludicrous Assemblage is formed by an Association of Ideas which we are diverted to see joined  together The other Method of  Burlesque  is if an Object has any Thing respectable about it to join it with Images not only inferior but in themselves contemptible Mr  Pope  is very frequent in this Kind of Satyr throughout his  Dunciad  and  Boileau  is I think admirable in both Species of  Burlesque  in his  Lutrin  Our own  Garth  also has many beautiful Passages in his  Dispensary  where a Ridicule is thrown upon his Heroes by associating with them Images of Things to which some Kind of Turpitude is adherent thus a Set of  Physicians  quarrelling among themselves are finely placed in a ludicrous Light by the following humourous Simile  Thus often at the  Temple  Stairs we've seen  Two  Tritons  of a rough athletic Mien  Sourly dispate some Quarrel of the Flood  With Knuckles bruis'd and Face besmear'd with Blood  But at the first Appearance of a Fare  Both quit the Fray and to their Oars repair  Another very common Method of  Burlesque  is by making frequent Application of grand and sublime Passages in our best Poets to Things unworthy and mean  Bioleau  is in my Opinion the happiest of all modern Poets in this Particular As Passages of this Nature are frequently mistaken for an Intent to  burlesque  the Author from whom the Image is borrowed it may not be improper in this Place to observe that Parody does not always carry with it any Sneer at the Author parodied The best Lines in  Virgil  may be aptly applied to other Objects without his being burlesqued and we find that  Vida  in his elegant and beautiful Poem on the  Game of Chess  has almost in every Line surprized us with Expressions from the  Aeneid  by which means he gives Spirit and Life to his Poem animates his imaginary Warriours with human Passions and fills the Fancy with entertaining Ideas of mock heroic Majesty The Description  of the Havock at a Game of Chess is perfectly elegant  Sternitur omne solum buxo atque miserrima caedes  Exoritur confusa inter sese agmina caedunt  Implicitaeque ruunt albae nigraeque Phalanges  Sternuntur pedites corpora quadrupedantum  The Description of the Queen is also highly beautiful  At medias inter acies crudescit Amazon  Candida plena animis mediisque in millibus ardet  It is plain that Mr  Pope  in his Account of a Game at Cards in the  Rape of the Lock  has imitated this excellent Poet in his Manner of exalting inanimate Things which can never carry with it any Air of  Burlesque  because nothing can be ridiculous but when a free Agency is applied  But in  Burlesque  as in every other Kind of Writing Truth should be the Foundation otherwise the Superstructure must fall like  Arisiophanes  's Ridicule of  Socrates  which is now held in Contempt as will always be the Case with every Piece of illfounded Pleasantry because the Object thus attacked must be always exceptionable otherwise it can never be essentially hurt by a false Combination of adventitious Ideas As there is a strong Propensity in the Generality of People to this Kind of Humour Tragic Poets in particular should be cautious how by any Passage or Expression they excite ludicrous Images If once in the most serious Scene a wrong Association of Ideas be formed the Mind is apt to attach itself to the Object of its Mirth and thus a wellimagined Plece may be obstructed A very elegant Critic observes that the following Line of  Dryden  A Star light Morning and an Ev'ning fair  Has in it nothing improper and yet if any one recollects that a  Starlight Morning  is the Language of a  Watchman it may occasion some sprightly Raillery On this account in all the different species of Composition the Writer must carefully remember to keep within his proper Boundaries because the least Excursion too far may be highly prejudicial and give room to small Wits either to point incongruous Circumstances or to obtrude them upon the Reader's Imagination  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  From my own Apartment  Aug    THE Account which I gave lately of my Intentions to abdicate the Office of a public Writer has been the Occasion of my receiving several Letters from sundry Correspondents who have addressed me in a Stile responsive to their respective Feelings on the Occasion A great many Coffeehouses express their Satisfaction at the Thoughts of being eased of the weekly Expence of Twopence which my Lucubrations cost them a few of these hospitable Gentry declare themselves sorry for my approaching Silence the  Grays Inn Journal  being as they assure me the Life of their CoffeeRoom There are many Persons of such cool and serious Understandings that they cannot approve any Thing but what is strictly and literally true these an ingenious Friend of mine calls Matter of Fact Men and by one of this Class I am told in very plain Terms that he's glad I am going to lay down  a Pox on your true Intelligence there's never any thing of Consequence in it the grand Mogul may be dead the  Algerines  may make Peace the King of the  Romans  may be chosen  Dunkirk  may be refitted  Theodore  King of  Corsica  be held to Bail and Mr  Keen  may succeed in his Negociations without any body's being the wiser for you  A Person who insorms me that he is perfectly vers'd in the Secret of Authorship begs of me to recommend him to my Publisher  that he may carry on the Paper the ensuing Winter but in this Point I must desire to be excused as I should not chuse to have my Plan eked out beyond its proper Bounds and I therefore take this Opportunity to entreat that elegant Writer who has for some Time past assumed the Name of  Ranger  not to lay any of his Foundlings at my Door when once I shall have made my Bow to the Public Such a Procedure would be highly illiberal and I hope I need not say any thing further on this Head But to the soft the obliging the lovely the courtly the amiable  Clarissa  who calls me you agreeable Devil and you pleasant Creature you must go on what Answer shall I make The Honour of making Part every  Saturday  morning of a Fair one's TeaEquipage has certainly very powerful Instigations to persist But the Truth of it is my Muse and I have been like Man and Wife for some Time past our Affections are become extremely frigid and I have had so many Curtain Lectures from her that I long very earnestly to keep separate Beds to say a civil Thing to her once in a Year and like a true modern Husband to admire every Body's  Muse  better than my own even though she be but a battered Drab and though the World should agree that my  Thalia  is not entirely contemptible On this Account I am at present suing in the Court of  Parnassus  for a Divorce and as she has not brought me any Fortune to speak of I shall not be troubled to allow her a separate Maintenance I am aware that malicious Critics will give out that I was separated  causâ frigiditatis  but the Public is always equitable in its Decisions and to them I implicitly submit  CHARLES RANGER  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday Aug    Quod genus hoc hominum Quaeve hunc tam barbara Morem  Permittit Patria  VIRG  _IT is a general Complaint made by my fair Countrywomen that the Gentlemen regardless of that Respect and Attention which are at all Times due to their Charms shew a great Averseness to their Company I fear this Charge cannot be controverted and am sorry to see the Truth manisested in the constrained Deportment in elegant Address and uncouth Attempts at Politeness that almost universally characterize the Youth of this Island  Certain it is that a frequent liberal Intercourse with that more refined Part of our Species which is happily described by the Appellation of the  Beau Sex  so powerfully influences not only our Manner and Behaviour but our Way of thinking that from thence we acquire a certain Delicacy of Sentiment which extends itself even to the most minute Circumstances of Life And from hence it is that our Neighbours the  French  have established throughout  Europe  that Character of Politeness which we do not chuse to be at the Trouble of emulating as we find it much more easy to ridicule and laugh at it My Lord  Anglois  while the Profusion with which he disperses his Guineas creates Astonishment in the Mechanics of  Paris  conscious of a Desiciency in that Ease and elegant Freedom which he observes in every Man of Education whom he meets shuns all good Company and after reluctantly spending three Months between the  Hôtel  and the several Places of public Diversion returns to his native Soil strongly impressed  with the most contemptuous Idea of the  French  whom though he has but literally seen he takes the Liberty to describe as a superficial volatile Nation for no other Reason perhaps than that they are perfectly skilled in the most entertaining I had almost said useful Art that Invention can suggest which is to trisle agreeably  A  Frenchman  has no more Idea of a Party of Pleasure without Ladies than an  Englishman  can entertain the least Conception of enjoying himself until they retreat From those opposite Dispositions it arises that the first introduces himself with a becoming Unconcern into Company and Master of that  Bienseance  which distinguishes the Gentleman and performs all Offices of Life without the least Embarassment Whereas nothing is more common among us than to find Gentlemen of Family and Fortune who know nothing of the FairSex but what they have collected from the most abandoned Part of it and can scarce reckon a virtuous Family within the whole Scope of their Acquaintance It is not unpleasant to observe one of this Class when Chance or Necessity has brought him into a Room with Ladies of Reputation An aukward Restraint hangs about him and he is almost afraid to speak least he should inadvertently bolt out something which tho' extremely suitable to the Dialect of  CoventGarden  would be grosly offensive to those Females who had not received their Rudiments of Education in that Seminary The Gloom that hangs over an  English  Company while the Ladies remain and the reciprocal Restraint that each Sex seems to be upon the other has been frequently a Subject of ludicrous Observations to Foreigners and indeed the Fairones themselves  tho' Natives and to the Manner born  frequently express Astonishment what Mysteries the Men can have to celebrate so opposite to those of the  Bona Dea  that no Female must be present at the Ceremony I am not at Liberty to divulge  this important Secret but will for the Satisfaction of the Ladies assure them that they are not of a Nature vastly beyond their Apprehension nay on the contrary may be casily understood even by a Miss in HangingSleeves provided she has had the Happiness of a BoardingSchool Education  At the same Time that I condemn my Countrymen for separating themselves from those who have the Art of refining every Joy this World affords I am sorry to be obliged to observe that the Ladies themselves do in some Measure contribute to this great Evil The scandalcus Practice so prevalent at present of giving up their whole Thoughts as well as Time to Cards has made the Company of Women pardon the Expression extremely insipid to those who would willingly consider them as rational Creatures and do not depend upon superior Skill in the Game of Whist for a Subsistance Is it to be imagined that a Man whose Mind is the least raised above the Vulgar will devote that Time which he may employ in conversing agreeably either with the Dead or the Living to those Assemblies where no Ideas enter beyond the respective Excellencies of  Garrick  and  Barry  and the several possible Cases so profoundly calculated by the incomparable Mr  Hoyle  Yet from declining these Places I know many intimate Friends who have acquired the odious Character of Womenhaters tho' at the same Time they entertain the highest Esteem for that amiable Sex and sincerely regret that the Tyrant Fashion has put it out of their Power to enjoy more of their Company than a bare View of their Persons agitated by the various and uncertain Revolutions of Fortune's Wheel  Besides what I have already mentioned another Obstacle extremely pernicious to Society proceeds from the excessive Officiousness of the female World in cuting out Matches Mr  Pope  has observed that  every Women is at Heart a Rake  and I believe it is not less  true though I fear the Assertion will be much more offensive to the Virgins of  Britain  that  every Woman is a Fortunehunter  This Character is deservedly infamous in the male Part of the Creation and we detest the Man  though of an exceeding good Family in  Ireland who aided by the Friendship and Confidence of his Taylor makes a pompous Display of the Breadth of his Shoulders and the Firmness of his Calves but conceive no Indignation against the lovely Nymph who  undresses  herself in the same View with the most seducing Art and generously much too generously for her own Interest exhibits every Charm the happy Man will be possessed of who takes her to his Posom The Idea of entrapping somebody mixes so intimately with the general Cast of Thought in Women that they can never divest themselves of it and if a Gentleman pays that Compliment to their Beauty which female Pride would never Pardon if he had omitted they immediately flatter themselves that he must have a Design of Marriage This Notion once conceived a Convocation of Aunts old Maids discreet Friends prudent Neighbours  c  is assembled when every Circumstance must be discussedMiss intimates  He is very particular to mewhat can he meanHe looked at me all the Time he was hereSure he'll propose soonThen did you remark Aunt  Betty  when we talked of Marriage what he saidHe certainly means to have me  The Result of this Consultation is that Miss must carry it with a proper Reserve in order to compel the imaginary Lover to declare himself who if he be a Man of Experience in the Subtleties of Women instantly sees through the flimsy Artifice and discontinues his Visits I submit to the Candor of every female Reader whether I have here drawn an ideal PictureCan these angelic Beings reasonably expect then that a Man will chuse to visit them under the disagreeable alternative of behaving continually  with a ceremonious Distance or running the Risk of being driven to the Necessity of an aukward ExplanationNo while narrow Sentiments of this Kind prevail it will be impossible to introduce a truly social Converse between the Sexes which must be effected on the Part of the Ladies by an undesigning decent Freedom the inseparable Companion of real Virtue Let them assert their own Dignity and manifest a Consciousness that they were not created merely to be  umental in the Continuation of the Species but are endowed with intellectual Faculties that qualify them for the sweet Joys of Society Let them at length so far undeceive themselves as to think that a Man may like their Company admire their Virtues nay even their personal Charms and cherish the warmest Friendship for them without any Intention of addressing them on the Score of Love let them but offer this Violence to the natural Vanity of their Sex and I will undertake to promise that they will not long have Reason to complain of being neglectedMen of S  se will then seek their Company and what I hope may make some Impression on a semale Mind will then think of them as

dislike the Author's Face or that of the Bookseller who may have purchased the Copy  c  Being all severally asked they pleaded  Not Guilty  then the  Attorney General  of the Court opened the Prosecution with the following Speech  Gentlemen of the Jury  The several Misdemeanors of the PsendoCritics who now stand at the Bar of this honourable Court are of as glaring a Die as ever came under the Cognizance of a Seat of Judicature intended to be supplemental to the Laws of the Land It is observed by Mr  Pope  Less dangerous is th'Offence  To tire our Patience than mislead our Sense  Now I appeal to the impartial Opinion of every Reader who has thought it worth his while to turn over the Leaves of the  Monthly Review  whether more malicious false and illgrounded Criticisms were ever sent Abroad into the World since the Days of  Zoilus  down to the present  Aera  of these notable Reviewers I am persuaded Gentlemen of the Jury that a more gross Imposition was never offer'd to the Republick of Letters than for a Bookseller whose Sign is justly  emblematical  of his Authors  viz  the  Dunciad  to take upon him to dictate to the Public in a Work conducted by obscure  Hirelings Country Schoolmasters  c  Certain it is that a critical Performance under the Direction of Gentlemen and Scholars written with Taste Impartiality and Erudition might be highly serviceable to the Cause of Literature A Man for Instance who should give such an Account of Works of Taste as  Pere Brumoy  has of the  Greek  Dramatic Poets would deserve to be cherished by the Public and the Bookseller who should publish such a Performance would acquire Honour and Reputation in his Business But as Matters have been managed by the  Reviewers  it is manifest that the whole is a mere Job eternally swelled out with dull Extracts from dull Authors calculated to serve the Purposes of a few Publishers and to misguide the Public Taste The frequent Abuses of the Liturgy the Arguments for abolishing the  Athanasian  Creed and the scandalous Treatment of many Clergymen of the Church of  England  are strong Indications of the Hand of a Fanatic and the idle Strictures of natural History Fossils Minerals  c  are infallible Marks of a certain exploded Herbalist who has reduced himself to the lamentable Situation described by a great Genius when he says there is not a more miserable Figure than a Man who has wrote himself down It is therefore submitted to the common Sense of Mankind whether it is not the highest Presumption in a Set of Hirelings to impose on the Judgment of their unfortunate Readers by a gross Misrepresentation of all Compositions according as they are directed by a Spirit of Malevolence or Partiality to usurp the Seat of Criticism without declaring who and what they are without producing their Credentials to shew the World by what Authority they act and without previously giving undeniable Proofs of their own Ability and Taste according to the Statute of Mr  Pope  Let such teach others who themselves excel  And censure freely who have written well  That not one of the Authors of the  Review  have  written well  will appear in their Works if they are any where to be

rested the Counsel for the Prisoners produced a Commission from  Grubstreet  but it was over ruled by the Court who told them that no  Grubstreet  Commission could authorize a Rebellion against Candor Taste and Truth They then offered an Extract of a Letter from  Oxford  but upon strict Enquiry the said Letter was found to be a Forgery no Individual of that Learned Body being capable of holding an Intercourse with obscure hackney Scribblers who deal out Malice and Invective by the Sheet Whereupon the Council against the Prosecution declared they had nothing further to offer in Favour of their Clients and the Judge proceeded to give his Charge to the Jury declaring the  Monthly Review  to be an Insult on the Understandings of all the good People of  GreatBritain  calculated to serve the Purposes of Booksellers and gratify the Resentment of  bad Authors  who as Mr  Pope  observes are generally  bad Men  He declared the arbitrary Proceeding of the Prisoners at the Bar to be very like

Degeneracy of the Times Each Individual of Society charitably judging himself excepted from the general Reproach assumes a Privilege to inveigh against the Vices of the Age and the total Decline from those Virtues which immortalized the exalted Characters of Antiquity and enabled the Ancestors of the present Race of  Englishmen  to deliver down to Posterity a Constitution which still renders them the Envy of the World  This splenetic Humour of decrying the Moderns is become so universal that all Ranks and Orders of Men seem more or less infected by it The Divine pathetically bewails the shameful Neglect of Religion The Patriot laments that Venality and Corruption have irretrievably extinguished the genuine Spirit of Liberty The Philosopher sighs that Enthusiasm and Superstition should have usurped the Throne of free Enquiry and debased the intellectual Faculties The Fair complain that the dissolute Inclinations of the Men compel them to drag out an uncomfortable Life in Celibacy while the Men in their Turn pour out the most bitter Invectives against the Extravagance and Dissipation of the other Sex which they would have the World believe are risen to such an Excess that the Word Matrimony  carries with it the Idea of Bankruptcy and Ruin Nay so far has the Influence of this Infatuation reached that it is become very common for even Stockjobbers to assert  that Things are not now as they have beennothing is to be done nowthe Prokerage in and out runs away with all the Profit whereas in King  William  's Time when the Government was distressed for Money and necessitated to give six  per Cent  upon a Loan great Strokes were to be made  In order therefore to shew the Unreasonableness as well as Disingenuity of this epidemic Dissatisfaction with the Age in which I had the Happiness to be born I shall endeavour to demonstrate and I flatter myself I shall be able to do it beyond all Possibility of Doubt that the now exining Inhabitants of  GreatBritain  so far from being inferior to their illustrious Predecessors do at this Day surpass the Ancients in all the admired Virtues and Qualifications which the most enthusiastic Idolizer of Antiquity shall be able to point out  In the first Place  Socrates Plato Cicero  and some few others of remote Antiquity are frequently celebrated for that amazing Strength of Mind which enabled them to detect the Impostures of the Religion established in the Country where they were born and empowered them to break through the Impediments which Superstition and Priestcrast had placed in the Avenues to Truth But surely the insignificant Number of Instances that ancient History furnishes of those trulyphilosophic Characters however respectable the Names may be will little deserve our Attention when we consider how infinitely the present Age eclipses their Claim of Superiority in this Respect Is there a Gentleman at this Day any Way conversant in polite Life who does not entertain the greatest Contempt for the Prejudices or Faith as it is vulgarly called in which he was educated Are not the Coffeehouses  about  TempleBar  nay even in the City so many Seminaries where our Youth discuss the most important Questions of Philosophy and explode the Errors imposed on Mankind for so many Centuries Nor is this Knowledge as among the Ancients the Result of tedious Enquiry and Meditation but entirely intuitive being most eminent in those who are almost totally void of the least Acquisition in any Branch of Literature and indebted to Nature alone for their astonishing Discoveries  The Advocate for Antiquity will perhaps thunder out an Eulogium on the exalted Virtue and Patriotism of  Cato Brutus  and several other illustrious  Romans  who prodigal of Life disdained to survive the Liberties of their Country But certainly there can be no room to run a Parallel the Advantage is so obviously on the Side of the Moderns Those ingenious Historians the Daily NewsWriters in every Page of their Works afford us Examples of the noblest Disregard of Death The  Roman  voluntarily quits the World because he could not bear to be a Witness of the Slavery of his Country but the  Englishman  puts a Period to his Existence because the Fogs of  November  depress his Spirits and he scorns to be compelled to live longer than Life continues agreeable How noble is this Spirit of Freedom which is not confined to People of Birth and Education but extends itself to the lowest Mechanics insomuch that my Lord is not more ready to discharge a Pistol through his Brain than his Barber In short the Point is so extremely clear that it would be quite superfluous to labour at the Proof of it and I may venture to assert that no Nation of which History has preserved the least Record has any Pretension to dispute the Glory of Suicide with  England  I am aware that great Stress may be laid upon the literary Merit of the Ancients and expect to hear the Names of  Aristotle Longinus  and  Quintilian  thrown  out with an exulting Air of Triumph Far be it from me to attempt to derogate from the long established Fame of those great Men Undoubtedly they were very good Critics for the Times in which they lived but with all due Respect to those celebrated Geniusses we may take the Liberty to suppose that the Art of Criticism must be now much better understood than it possibly could be in their Days as it is much more universally studied Attorneys Clerks Mercers 'Apprentices and Merchants Bookkeepers in this Year  credite posteri  are thoroughly qualified to pronounce in the most decisive Manner upon the Merit of all literary Compositions particularly dramatic Poetry the noblest Province of polite Learning not to mention that we have found out the Absurdity and shook off the restraint of those Fetters which the Stagyrite would rivet on us and transferred them to our Gallic Neighbours a Nation inured to and patient of Slavery  Should any discontented or disappointed Politician after poring over  Livy  insinuate that Mankind are not now as they were in the Times of the  Roman  Republic when private Considerations always gave Way to the publick Good I would only desire such a phlegmatic Murmurer to look through the Kingdom and observe what a Number of Gentlemen have impaired their Estates and destroyed the Tranquillity and Happiness of their Families in order to procure a Seat in the RepresentativeAssembly of the Nation undoubtedly with no other View but that they might be watchful over the Liberties of their Country  Some mercantile Cynic dissatisfied with an unruly Son who finds more Charms within the Regions of  CoventGarden  than the CountingHouse will perhaps pay little Regard to what I have hitherto advanced and exclaim  that the Spirit of Industry is quite lost and People of this Age regard nothing but Pleasure  But the Injudice of this Censure would evidently appear  to this narrowminded Citizen if the next Time he went to the Pit at  DruryLane  with his Wife and Daughters on a  Saturday  he would take the Trouble to make Enquiry concerning the most gay and brilliant Personages in the Boxes He could then be informed that they are Gentlemen by Way of Eminence distinguished by the Appellation of  Knights of Industry  who without any visible Means of Subsistence enjoy all the Pleasures of this Metropolis in the most elegant Manner and run into Expences which few Men of  real  Fortune can support  Let us now turn our View to the amiable Sex and enter into a Comparison between the Females of ancient Times and the present Ladies of  Great Britain  In what an honourable Light will our CountryWomen appear In vain shall the Pedant who derives his Knowledge solely from Books harangue upon the conjugal Attachment of  Roman  Matrons while we can mention numberless  British  Wives who at this Day with unexampled Unanimity go Hand in Hand with their Husbands in pursuit of the grand Business of Life mean GAMING which Mr  Pope  in his usual emphatic Manner calls  the Nation's last great Trade  Nor should the Candor and Disinterestedness of the Virgins of this Island want that Encomium which Justice cannot refuse  Plutarch  insorms us that  Lycurgus  ordered the  Spartan  Nymphs to appear at the public Exercises in Garments made with artificial Openings in different Parts in order that the  Lacedaemonian  Youth might be captivated by a seemingly accidental Discovery of their Charms But our Fair ones disdaining so disingenuous a Proceeding and scorning to take Advantage of the Illusion of Imagination which inflamed by a transient Glympse is apt to form enthusiastic Ideas of hidden Beauty  shew Things as they really are  and by making a generous Display of all their Charms leave no room to their future Husbands to  complain that they were deceived in their Expectations  These Examples which I have brought in support of the Proposition I undertook to prove will sufficiently evince to every impartial Mind that the pretended Preeminence of  Greece  and  Rome  over  Britain  has no other Foundation than Prepossession and Envy and all unprejudiced Readers must acquiesce in the Truth of the Observation made with great Insight into human Nature by the elegant Historian from whom I have taken the Motto of this Paper  We are naturally more ready to do Justice to what we hear of than to what we see cotemporary Merit excites our Envy but that of ancient Times our Veneration We do not think curselves eclipsed by the latter but consider the former as a reproachful  ession to us  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  Court of Censorial Enquiry  Wednesday Sept    PUrsuant to Adjournment the Court met this Day when  William Quibble  was Indicted for that he without having the Fear of the God of Wit before his Eyes the  Bedford  Coffeehouse did enter and then and there several Puns did make to the great Annoyance of the Company  c  The Cause was opened by Counfellor  Truewit  who urged that Punning is the meanest Exercise of the human Faculties that though  Bohours  has established it for a Rule that the most brilliant Thought must upon Examination lose its Lustre unless Truth be the Foundation of it the Persons who have contracted this Imbecillity of Mind depend always upon some false Turn to recommend themselves and that therefore a Propensity to Punning is not only a Sign of the most flimsy Intellectuals but also an Affront to the Understanding of every Person to whom it is offered  Isaac Solid  I was setting at the  Bedford  Coffeehouse and I enquired what Time of the Day it might be and the Prisoner at the Bar answered me that his  Pastime  was  spoiled  William Sensible  I was at the  Bedford  Coffeehouse at the same Time and he was making his Brags that he had been in a  Fieldbed  with a young Lady whose Brother was present and being called to an Account about it he then said he meant it only in Joke that he happened to lie down in  Marybone  Fields when she was walking there and so was in a  Fieldbed  William Ashley  I am a Shoemaker and the Prisoner at the Bar desired me to let him have a  neat Pump  I neglected the Business of my other Customers and when I brought it Home on  Saturday  Night he told me he meant a  Waterpump  and offered me for my Trouble a Draft upon  Aldgatepump  and then fell a Laughing at me  Prisoner's Defence  I look upon a good Pun to be an agreeable Effort of the Mind but if it should appear to the Jury that I am guilty of any Transgression I hope this  piriful  Bench will take my Case into Consideration  GUILTY  Then the Judge ordered him to perform a  Quarantine  before he offered to enter into Society again and during the Time of his Penance he was commanded to study Mr  Locke  's Chapter upon Judgment which it was hoped might serve to give him a due Sense of his Error and a Relish for something more solid than the frivolous Amusement he had hitherto addicted himself to  Adjourned  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday Sept    Si Veteres ita miratur laudatquè  Ut nihil anteferat nihil illis comparet errat  HOR  To  CHARLES RANGER  Esq  SIR  _I Cannot but very much approve that Spirit of Patriotism which seems to have inspired the Essay of last  Saturday  The Generality of Mankind are slavishly attached to established Prejudices and it must be a strong and manly Genius that will dare to examine received Opinions and boldly assert the Truth against popular Sentiments and vulgar Error This Mr  Ranger  you have performed very eminently in your last Paper and as I entirely coincide with your Way of thinking I beg Leave to address this Letter to you as a Supplement to what you have there advanced  I must avow that I entirely agree with you that the Moderns have in every thing greatly exceeded the admired Ancients If the latter boast their  Plato  we have our Lord  Shaftsbury  and if the Death of  Cato  is justly stiled by the Poet  Catonis nobile Letum  because he would not survive the Loss of Liberty is it not much more heroic in a modern Cobler to dispatch himself for on other Reason but that he does not like the Weather or in a Nobleman to cut his Throat because he has lost the odd Trick at Whist In addition to this it must be considered that few Instances of this Sort of Fortitude are ecorded among the  Romans  whereas I am credibly informed  by a very sensible Man and one of the  Coroner  's  Inquest  that there does not pass by a single Day without his being called to Turvey the glorious Reliques of a selfdevoted Taylor Shoemaker  c  The same Person assures me at the same Time that not a tenth Part of those exalted Minds have the due Honours paid to their Memory by the public News papers but are permitted to remove themselves from human Life in the same Silence as if they had quietly pass'd through Nature to Eternity and never dared to fly in the Face of their Maker But to set this Matter in the clearest Point of View I shall here draw up a Catalogue of whatever may seem to give the Ancients a Claim to our Preference contrasted with a List of modern Improvements upon a fair Inspection of which I flatter myself the Laurel will by every impartial Reader be adjudged to the present Age  Ancient Catalogue    Aristotle    Hippocrates    Socrates    Tully    Cato Uticensis    Epictetus  's Morals  The  Stoics  the  Sceptics  the  Peripatetics  the  Acedemics  the  Epicureans c c    Dionysius Halicarnassensis Longinus Quintilian  A Secession of the  Romana  Plebs  The Eleusinian Mysteries    Balnea Romana  The Olympick Games    Plato  's  Symposion    Senatus Populusque Romanus  Modern Catalogue  Doctor  Hill  Doctor  Rock    Whitfield  Orator  Henley    Englishmen  that hang and drown themselves    Theo Cibber  's Dissertations  The  Theists Mandevillians Muggletonians Hutchinsonians  the  Robin Hood  Society  c  The Authors of the  Monthly Review  An  English  Mob  Free Masonry  The  Covent Garden  Bagnios    Newmarket  Races  The Club at  White  's  O the Roast Beef of  Old England  Without adding any supernumerary Articles I think it is marifest from the above State of the Case that the Moderns can easily balance the Scale with the so much celebrated Ancients But the Matter does not rest here Mr  Ranger  I am convinced we can throw in several Circumstances which will greatly entitle us to the Preeminence As for instance I do not find that they had an  Atheist  among them and surely the Character of an  Atheist  must in the Eyes of all Men of Sense do very great Honour to the present Age the Tenets of his Philosophy being entirely new and such as were not discover'd by  Plato Tully Socrates  or any of the ancient Philosophers That happy Discovery being reserved for the present Age so much enlightened as a great Genius says in all true Philosophy Add to this what has been already urged on a similar Occasion the Ancients were totally ignorant of the Laws of  England  and I believe it cannot be denied but the common Law of  England  is by many Degrees preferable to the Laws of  Solon  or any other Legislator as it is founded upon the sure Basis of common Sense intelligible to the meanest Capacity without much Study and full as easy in the Practice as in the Theory I must acknowledge that I have read in  Livy  and  Sallust  some random Accounts of the Contempt the Candidates had in  Rome  for Money upon all Elections for the Consulship the Tribuneship  c  this Procedure among them was stiled by the illnatured by the Name of  Ambitus  and by the rigid among the Moderns Bribery and Corruption but to divest Things of odious Appellations the public and benevolent Spirit of our Countrymen at a general Election cannot be parallelled any where in the  Roman  Page The Ancients occasionally  make a Murmur concerning a Matter which they call  nequissima faenora  but it will need no Force of Argument to prove that Usury has attained to a greater Degree of Profusion among the Moderns How many young Heirs are ruined with us before they come to Years of Discretion Not to mention that they had not the faintest Idea of the  Stocks Jonathan  's CoffeeHouse  Change Alley  the  SouthSeaHouse  the  IndiaHouse Rescounters Directors Brokers c  That the  Romans  were a very exponsive People is very well known to Mr  Ranger  and every one who has dipped into  Vertot  's Revolutions or the famous  Montesquieu  's Causes of the Declension of the  Roman  Empire notwithstanding this I have the Pleasure to congratulate my Countrymen on our owing so many Millions of Money and I persuade myself every one of my Readers will allow that the national Debt gives us a very great Advantage over the Ancients I am not ignorant that  Sallust  mentions  publicè Egestatem privatim Opulentiam public Penury  and  private Opulence  But Sir I appeal to you whether we have not both these more glaringly than appears any where in the  Roman  History Tho' I should be sorry to be guided by a national Partiality in this Matter yet I cannot but think our  national Debt  is as remarkable a Thing as I ever read of in History and as to private Wealth the infinite Sums of Money laid out in artificial Falls of Water artificial Canals and indeed in artificial Wine  c  most evidently evince our Superiority Moreover I apprehend the Ancients were entire Strangers to Routs and Drums not to mention two or three Hundred CardTables in one House I do not think that they seem to have the faintest Idea of an E O Table of  reversing  of  forcing  of  finessing  of  seesawing  and the many elegant Turns in the Game of Whist  Picquet Brag Backgammon Cribbidge  are not even mentioned in the slightest manner and I flatter myself I may say without the Danger of a Controversy that  the Discoveries made by Mr  Hoyle  in the Doctrine of  Chances  by far exceed their deepest Researches in the Mathematicks  To give the Argument another turn the Beauty the Elegance and Manners of our  British  Ladies give a surprizing Lustre to the present Age  Horace  informs us  Matronae praeter faciem nil cernere possis  Caetera ni Catia est demissâ veste tegentis  A Matron never shews any Part of her Person except her Face they being all studious unless it be  Catia  to cover the rest of their amiable bodies with a Garment  Catia  it seems then is a singular Instance but how different is the Conduct of the Matrons of the modern Times They have all happily emerged from the Ruff of Queen  Bess  and their chief Endeavour is to display all their Charms to full View Had this Fashion prevailed among the ancient Ladies I conceive a  naked Venus  would not have been so great a Rarity Indeed in  England  some Remains of this false Modesty prevailed not very long since in consequence of which Mr  Pope  has finely said  If  Queensbury  to strip there's no compelling  'Tis from a Handmaid we must take an  Helen  But happily future Painters will not be reduced to such Difficulties as the modern Ladies are daily stripping as fast as they can and the visible Approaches of the amiable Sex to a general Nakedness cannot fail to give a Lustre to my fair Countrywomen beyond all  Greek  and  Roman  Fame The Tendency to undressing is so strong at present that I make no doubt but the Time will come in a Period not far distant when Miss in her Teens will cry out  Lard Mamma I have been reading the  World  or the  Gray'sInn Journal  but they are so full of hard cramp Words I can't think what to make of 'emPray Mamma what can they mean by Stays  Really Child says Mamma I can't say for certain  but if one may conjecture I should imagine that in those Days the Women wore something about their Bodies as high from the Waist up as the Pit of their Stomach    He he he Mamma what a ridiculous Fashion that must be What has a Woman a fine Skin for but to shew it or if she has not a fine Skin what has she Paint for but to make a fine Skin And then Mamma what could the Petticoat be    Why Child it looks as if in those Days they wore a Covering for their Limbs down from the Waist as low as the Ankle    He he he says Miss what has a Woman Legs for but to shew 'em And then Mamma I suppose by Crownwhist that the People in those Days were so penurious and so pitiful and so careful as only to play for Crowns    Yes Child says Mamma that is pretty plain and keeping  Sundays  was then made a Crime and three Hundred CardTables was then counted a Thing of Consequence    Well Mamma I am as glad as any thing I was not born in those grave formal Times  This or something not unlike it will most assuredly be the Language of the rising Generation and if Improvements are made in other Branches such as the  national Debt Atheism c  I persuade myself that whatever the Admirers of the Antients may urge at present our Superiority will then be incontestible  Pleased with the Prospect of this happy Period I will here lay down my Pen and subscribe myself Mr  Ranger  's  Most Obedient and very Humble

by  Horace  that in a long Work an Author may very lawfully indulge himself with a Nap on this Account I shall make no Apology for having been occasionally caught nodding on the contrary I shall make an Account of the various Occurrences I lately met with in my Sleep the Subject of this Day's Paper  I dreamt that being on board a Merchantman upon a Voyage which indispensible Business obliged me to make we were drove by Distress of Weather far to the Southward in the  Great Pacific  Ocean and that in the NightTime we were suddenly thrown on the Shore of an Island totally unknown to the Ship's Crew While  they were next Morning all Hands at Work to get off the Ship I adventured farther up into the Country and had not journeyed far when I perceived myself to be in the Land of the  Houyhnhnms  mentioned by Capt  Gulliver  in his Travels and in a little Time methought I met with the same Master  Houyhnhnm  with whom that accurate Traveller so long conversed As he had before seen one of my Species I was freed from the disagreeable Circumstances of being stared at and shewed about in the Manner we do a tall Man or a short Woman in  England  The Master  Houynhnhnm  immediately took me into a private Apartment and began to question me concerning the State of  Europe  and that of  Great Britain  in particular He asked me whether the same Vices were still in fashion among us and more especially whether that List of Enormities which  Gulliver  had mentioned to him were still continued in Practice such as  Robbing Stealing Cheating Pimping Forswearing Flattering Suborning Forging Gaming Lying Fauning Hectoring Voting Scribbling Stargazing Poisoning Whoreing Canting Libelling Freethinking  and the like I told him they flourished with as much if not more Vigour than ever and that two of them  viz Gaming  and  Libelling  encreased and gathered Strength every Day that there are several in the Metropolis of  GreatBritain  who professedly live by them that in order to carry on the former  viz  Gaming with Alacrity there are several Societies formed where they meet with a Design upon one another's Pockets which was introductory of another Crime not mentioned by  Gulliver  viz  Suicide  this I took some Pains to explain and then he fetched a deep Groan at the Pride and Arrogance of human Nature I added that the  Female Yahoos  amongst us were all turned absolute Gamesters and kept Routs Drums Hurricanes  c  for the Purposes of Play I remember I had a very sensible Pleasure in calling the fair Gamesters by the  Name of  Female Yahoos  because I really think that Term very aptly appropriated to them when they relinquish their native Delicacy and become a Prey to all the tormenting Passions of Gaming I further informed the Master  Houyhnhnm  that Libelling is now in greater Vogue than ever and that a Society was formed for that Purpose by a Set of Scribblers who call themselves  Critical and Monthly Reviewers  and from their obscure Haunts attack the Reputation of every Man whom they dislike for no Motive except that strong Antipathy which Dullness and Malice always have to Genius and a fair Fame The worthy  Houyhnhnm  here fetched a second Groan hurt by a Reflection on the Baseness of human Nature He then enquired about his former Acquaintance Capt  Gulliver  and said he looked upon him to be exempt from all the mean fordid Vices of his Species Whereupon I informed him that  Gulliver  was only that celebrated Person's travelling Name that in  Europe  he was known by the immortal Name of Doctor  Swift  as I am particularly fond of the Writings of that great Genius and never travel without them I informed the  Houyhnhnm  that I had his Works in my Chest and if he would permit me to return to the Ship I would have the Honour of presenting them to him This Proposal was perfectly agreeable and in a little Space of Time I came back with that elegant Edition of  Swift  's Works lately publish'd by Mr  Hawksworth  In a few Days he read over the best Part of his Works and was delighted with most of them but more particularly with the faithful Account of the Conversation he formerly had with him which he said was set down without the least Deviation from Truth He added that the Account prefixed by Mr  Hawksworth  of the Author's Life was an admirable Composition  I observe said he that my old Acquaintance  Gulliver  or  Swift  was at once an Instance of the Dignity and the Imbecillity of human Nature and the Writer of his Life I am persuaded  must have both a clear Head and a good Heart because his Stile is properly concise and always clear strong and harmonious and it is with a very perceptible Regret that he speaks of the Infirmities of his Author he seems tenderly to fling them into Shades to soften away every thing unamiable and to place his good Qualities in the most glaring Light  Finding the worthy  Houyhnhnm  to be very much pleased with this Performance of Mr  Hawksworth  I made him a Present of the  Adventurer  in four Volumes which he received with a seeming Avidity and chancing to light upon the Eastern Story of  Carazan  the  Merchant of Bagdat  he confessed himself delighted with the Moral which it inculcates and amazed at his Warmth and Sublimity of Imagination  The  Houyhnhnm  observed when I presented the above Books to him that I dropt a Paper and in some Confusion hastily snatched it up This Paper was no other than Mr  Pons  's List of the Horses that run at  Newmarket  which I was desirous to conceal from him but being urged to show it he laughed at the Whimsicalness of the Conceit as he supposed it to be and he wondered Mr  Pons  would say the Thing which was not I assur'd him of the Veracity of the Account and told him however incredible it might appear that  Jockeys  rid Horses or  Houyhnhnms  at full speed for Wagers in many other Places in  England  and that even the first Noblemen would frequently ride their own Horses and appear at a great Meeting no better than  Jockeys  and  Grooms  To convince him further of the great Perfection we have attained in the Management of Horses I produced to him  A New System of Horsemanship from the  French  of Monsieur  Bourgela    By  Richard Berenger  Esq  He at first laughed at the Impracticability of the Scheme but upon my assuring him that the whole was sounded on the justest Observation he immediately sent for another  Houyhnhnm  and ordered me to mount him in order to shew him the  Efficacy of the Rules In vain I endeavoured to decline it by Apologies for my own Want of Dexterity to encourage me he bid the  Houyhnhnm  not do me a Mischief and I was obliged to vault into the Saddle where I fixed myself upon the  Twist with a proper Grasp or Hold  and  that too without employing any Strength but trusting entirely to the Balance of my Body I employed a quick and feeling Hand  and then made him advance go back turn to the right and lest according to my own Will and Pleasure The Master  Houyhnhnm  was surprized to see me have so absolute a Command the  Volte  the  Demivolte  the  Gallop  the several  Passades  the  TerreaTerre  the  Mezair  the  Curvet c  were Matters of Astonishment to him and when I alighted the  Houyhnhnm  which I rode declared that several Times his Pride being picqued he attempted to fling me but that by a quick Turn of the Wrist he found his Power totally taken away from him The Master again carried me into his Apartment and after expressing a due Degree of Astonishment  Surely said he the Person who can thus in so elegant and perspicuous a Manner put together a System of Rules for subduing the noble Race of  Houyhnhnms  must make great Attainments whenever he turns his Thoughts to other Matters  I answered that his Conjecture was perfectly just that the Author had published that Performance because Riding is his favourite Excercise and that it is to be hoped he will some Day handle other Topics with that Taste and Delicacy with which this Composition shews he can treat ordinary Things  No Doubt says the  Huyhnhnm  when he thus touches on what it seems in  England  is but the common Business of Life but he must display great Elegance when he discusses Matters of more Refinement I own I should be glad to converse with him tho' I consider him as a kind of Enemy and I hope he is a seafaring Man that I may have some Chance of seeing him here one time or other  Upon  hearing the Author was designed by Birth Genius and Education to shine in another Sphere he declar'd himself sorry and in Compliance with my Request gave me Leave to return to the Ship which was by this Time got off the Shore I therefore kissed his Hoof which he raised for me as he formerly did to  Gulliver  and after desiring his Compliments to the Editor of  Swift  's  Works  and the Author of the  System of Horsemanship  he dismissed me with a serious Admonition to avoid the Meannesses and the several fordid Vices of human Nature Whereupon I took my final Leave and returned to my Companions We sailed with a prosperous Wind and meeting but few Accidents in our Voyage in a short Time arrived at  Gravesend  My Joy at finding myself once more in  Old England  was so great that I expressed myself in the Language of the Country I came from and awakened out of my Sleep crying out HOUYHNHNM  TRUE INTELLIGENCE  From my own Apartment  Sept    AS this is the last Opportunity I shall have of giveing Articles of true Intelligence I have determined to give the Precedence in this Day's Paper to a succinct Account of the Proceedings at a Court of censorial Enquiry against the Author of this Paper I flatter myself that by these Means the Exceptions which may have been taken to these little Compositions will be stated in a fair Light and the Writer's Conduct throughout his Undertaking put beyond the Reach of Calumny or Detraction  Court of Censorial Enquiry  Wednesday Sept    This Day CHARLES RANGER  Esq  appeared at the Bar of this Court upon an Indictment found against him for that he wantonly and indiscreetly from Time to  Time in his  Gray  's  Inn Journal  made too free with Characters which had not offended him to the great Uneasiness of the Persons so attacked and against the Statute recorded by  Horace Sublato jure nocendi c  Ranger  objected to several who were summoned to be on the Jury offering various Reasons as Occasion required such as  Dulness Ignorance Prejudice c  At length this Point being adjusted the Cause was opened by Counsellor  Fester  who spared neither Elocution nor Eloquence to inflame the Mind of the Court and the Gentlemen impanelled against the Prisoner at the Bar Many Instances he insisted could be pointed out of personal Resentment and Malice prepense  c  After which several Passages of  Ranger  's Writings were read in Court and several Witnesses appeared to enforce the Charge exhibited against himAmong these were  Quinbus Flestrin  from the  Bedford  Coffee House  Bob Nankeen Nat Pigtail Harry Lappel Jack Oakstick Jemmy Scratch  from the City Mr  Mac Gregor  Mr  Broadbrim  Mr  Shallow c  from the Robinhood Society Mons  Bourguignon  Mons  Languedoc  Mons  Bernard  Mons  Soup meagre c  from  Tom  's in  Cornhill  and  Slaughter  's in  St Martin  's  Lane Moses Aminadab Selim Levi Rubens Shylock  c from  DukesPlace  and some others from various Parts of the Town all these deposed that the Prisoner had indulged himself in frequent Strokes of Pleasantry upon them and they therefore hoped the Jury would bring in a Verdict accordingly  Prisoner's Defence  May it please this honourable Court and you Gentlemen of the Jury  The Imputation of wantonly making free with Characters that had not given any personal Offence is a Point I must speak a few Words to because I think it a very fallacious Argument and  if it be supposed to carry any Weight it may be sufficient to tie up the Hands of every Satyrist It is not necessary that a ridiculous Character should tread upon an Author's Toe or offend him in some other Manner without that he is free Game for every Sportsman of the Qui'l and that this is Mr POPE'S Opinion appears from the following Lines  And must no Egg in  Japhet'  s Face be thrown  Because the Deed he forg'd was not my own  I must farther declare before this honourable Court that I never saw one of these Gentlemen who have appeared against me in my LifeTheir Faces their Persons their Characters are to me perfectly unknown and therefore I presume it may be fairly inferred that I never meant to give the least Annoyance to any one in particularThey were all Personages of my own Creation and something like them I imagined might exist in Nature and therefore I fansied I had a Right to lash or banter any Vice or Folly under imaginary Names without intending a personal Application in any one Instance Having said thus much I think it unnecessary in so plain a Cafe to take up the Time of the Court to whose equitable Decisions I implicitly resign myself  Hereupon the Jury withdrew and in a few Minutes brought in their Verdict NOT GUILTY to the great Satisfaction of  Ranger  and his Friends and the Disappointment of the Group of Witnesses mentioned above The Lord Chief Justice of the Court then broke his Staff declared his Commission to be annulled and the censorial Court was finally dismissed  NUMB  GRAY'SINN  Saturday

Passions like Flowers at the Setting Sun immediately are contracted the Spirits that expanded every Nerve sink in their Channels subside into Languor and Satiety takes Possession of the Mind I remember to have met with a Story of a prime Minister to  Pyrrhus  who seems to have had a shrewd Turn of Humour When the King happened in the full Rapture of Expedition and his Imagination dilated with Ideas of future Conquest to expatiate at large upon the various Incidents of his growing Enterprize  Pray Sir says he what does all this tend to Why cries the Monarch I shall add the neighbouring Nations to my DominionsWell and what then pray Why then I shall declare War against the adjacent  StatesAnd what then Sir I shall proceed in my Conquests and the next Province shall receive my YokeAnd what then Sir Why their Neighbours shall also pay Tribute This is very well my Liege and what nextThus I shall gradually extend my Victories till I become Master of the Globe And what thenThenwhythen I'll sit down and crack a Bottle with my Friends And pray Sir why not do so now  This Passage has always appeared to me to carry with it a very fine Stroke of Satyr and I am inclinable to think that if the greatest Hero of Antiquity were to make up the Account of his Happiness he would find it not one Jot more than is here implied  But among all the various Adventurers who must feel this Truth there is no Set of  Quixotes  who experience it more powerfully than the Race of Authors What Happiness does not the periodical Writer enjoy in the first dawning of a new PlanIn Proportion as one Idea awakens a new Train of pleasing Images and the Design opens to his View what Sensations unfelt before What Chearfulness what Fancy what luxuriant Wit And when a Sheet yet wet is sent him from the Press for his Inspection how his Heart bounds to see himself in printthe Fineness of the Paper How it pleases him The Elegance of the Type How its Symmetry strikes the Eye The Correctness of the CompositorHow just and how exact Flushed with these Ideas the Imagination expands itself and in the Fulness of SelfAdmiration he addresses himself in the Words of  Hamlet  "What a Piece of Work is Man How noble in Reason How infinite in Faculties"And yet pass but a few Hours and how changed is every Trace of Reflection The Critics gather round him and like the Harpies in the third  Aeneid  they break in upon his Meal and like them too they denounce Penury and Famine The  Learned meet his work by Chance they speak of it but not with sufficient Warmth because Men of Sense never admire and only approve He ther runs up and down among the Pamphlet Shops in many they have not heard of it he calls for it in CoffeeHouses "Sir we don't take it in"In Places where it is used he sees it twisted into a thousand different Shapes the Paper and Print neglected and the Stile unregarded the Waiters throw it among the common Lumber and Gentlemen keep Snuff in it These and many other Indignities arise to mortify an Author's Pride and besides all this the Novelty of the Performance will wear off with him as well as his Readers and even Fame supposing the good natured World allow him his full Portion will thrill by degrees with feebler Impulse to his HeartStrings and in the Conclusion I believe he will find that Hero like he cannot drink his Bottle with greater Pleasure than when he first set out  Add to this that there is a Concurrence of Circumstances which never sail to render the Profession of an Author more uneasy than any other Station in Life  The courtly  Roman  Satyrist has attacked with all the elegant Touches of his delicate Raillery that prevailing Spirit of Uneasiness which renders People discontented with their own Situation in Life and envious of the apparent Felicity of their Neighbours but in the Lift of MaleContents which he has produced I have often wondered that he has not thought proper to enrol the Race that write The Occasion of this might possibly be that Authors have more solid Reasons than any other Class of Beings to repine and murmur at their Occupation and to wish that Fate had assigned them an Employment in which they might partake more of the Ease and the Enjoyments of Life  And indeed considering the great Disproportion of Intenseness between the Labours of the Mind and those of the Body I do not know whether  Juvenal  's Advice  to be an Auctioneer rather than a Poet is not entirely eligible for it is certain that those nice Faculties of Perception of which the literary Enthusiast is possessed as they are the Inlets of our most refined intellectual Pleasures so they are also from the Quickness and Delicacy of their Feeling susceptible of the most acute Degrees of Pain and in the same Proportion that they administer to Happiness they may also improve and sharpen the Edge of Misery in like Manner as the String from which the skilful Artist elicits a delightful Strain of Music is also capable of returning the disagreeable Sounds of jarring Discord  Of this Truth I believe every Writer is convinced who is actuated by an honest Ambition to acquit himself with Honour in his Calling for I by no Means intend to speak at present of those vain Scribblers who are for ever happy in their own Self Admiration and who are intirely Strangers to the Agitations of Mind attendant on a Genius studious of correcting and polishing his Piece In fine Writing there are so many intricate Points which demand Attention that it must be with the utmost Solicit de the Task is ever accomplished Justness of Conception and Truth in every Turn of Wit are indispensible Requisites nothing can excuse the Want of Delicacy of Sentiment the Sallies of Imagination and the frolic Gambols of Invention must be restrained by Severity of Judgment and all must be expressed with Perspicu  ty and Strength of Diction Besides this a proper Arrangement of Periods following one another with graceful Variety must unite the whole into Harmony as the Painters express themselves when they give the last finishing Hand to their colouring and throw that general Glow upon their Piece which at the first Glance strikes the intelligent Spectator But the Truth of it is the Traces of a Mind which can think with Cl  arness and Vigour upon any Subject and pursue a Series of Ideas one emerging from another  and tending gradually to form an intire whole are so seldom discovered that there is Reason to think it an Accomplishment unattainable without the most assiduous Efforts of Study and many Moments of Care and Anxiety  An honest and fair Fame is among the Instigations which incite an Author to undergo all this mental Fatigue but even that very Inducement is of so unstable a Nature the Acquisition of it so uncertain and the Tenure so precarious that I believe what at first looked so inviting to the Imagination becomes at length the Writer's greatest Torment Add to this the great Hardship of pleasing that Multiplicity of Appetites with which Mankind abound and the still greater Difficulty which every Man of Genius experiences to please his own private Taste Mr  Pope  tells us in the general Preface to his Works that he never wrote up to his own Ideas of Poetry and  Boileau  who is second to no Man for sound Sense and Judgment observes that an Author of Elevation in his Conceptions is continually discontented with his Performances is pleasing to all the World except himself and while his Wit is every where admired that for his own inward Quiet he sincerely wishes he had never dipt his Pen in Ink  Mais un Esprit sublime en vain veut s'elever  Ace Dégré par fait qu'il tache de trouver  Et toûjours mécontent de ce qu'il vient de faire  Il plait à tout le Monde et ne sauroit se plaire  Et tel dont en tous Lieux Chacun vante Esprit  Voudroit pour son Repos n'avoir jamais ecrit  I have been led into this Tract of Thought by a Review of my own Sensations ever since I undertook the anxious Character of a public Writer which I have now sustained for the Space of two Years and having swelled these Essays to a sufficient Number I purpose next  Saturday  finally to take Leave of my Readers In doing this I must own that I perform a kind  of Selfdenial as I shall then break off an habitual Intercourse with the Public from which I have occasionally deduced a very sensible Pleasure as I have experienced that these Papers such as they are have from Time to Time conduced to the Entertainment of the Town On this Account I shall abdicate with Reluctance but the Line which I have quoted in my Motto from

now arrived to the conclusive Essay of the  Gray's Inn  Journal the Mask must be dropped and the assumed Character of the Gay  Charles Ranger  must at length dwindle into that of the real Author who begs Leave this Day to address his Readers in his own Name  I remember the Introductory Paper to this Undertaking embarrassed my Imagination more than any successive Composition as coming into Company is sometimes attended with uneasy Flutterings which are afterwards effaced by Habit As I am also desirous of going off with as good a Grace as possible I cannot but be a little solicitous about the Manner of my Exit In the social Intercourse of Life I know as little Ceremony should be used as the Nature of all Things will admit but the periodical Writer cannot withdraw without making his Bow to the Public  Two different Forms of writing have offered themselves to me upon this Occasion The first has been practised by several Gentlemen of the Quill and consists in a declamatory Stile against that degeneracy of Taste which has too fatally prevailed in the present Declension of Literature In Addition to this I might indulge myself in a Vein of Invective against the general Disposition to Gaming and many other unavailing Amusements which have called off the Attention of the better Sort of People from all literary Productions I might further expatiate in a Strain of Raillery on the Fair and might urge that Woman is very justly defined by the  Greek  Pholosopher  "An Animal delighting in Finery"  and that it is not in the Power of the best Writers of the Age to attract the Attention of that wandering Sex who are evermore entertained with the Chitchat which issues from their own pretty red Lips than with a Perusal of a Composition calculated to retrench their Follies to regulate their Fancy to improve their Intellectuals and to encourage them to the Acquisition of those mental Beauties such as Sweetness of Temper Affability and good Sense which will be always sure to confer upon them the most permanent Embellishments and will prove the best Wash for the Complexion and an infallible Preservative against the Encroachments made upon the Tincture of the Skin by Envy Malice Tea Scandal and painful Watchings at a GamingTable After this I might pompously declare that I now decline taking any further Trouble with those incorrigible Angels that I consign them entirely to their HairCutters their Dancing Masters and what is still worse to their own ungoverned fantastic Appetites But this Form of Composition is inconsistent with my present Purpose as I should be glad to lay down the Pen in the good Graces of all my Readers  The second Method of Address which occurred to me was that used by the excellent and humorous Author of the  Tale of a Tub  After his Example I have been tempted to return Thanks in the most solemn Manner to his Majesty's most honourable PrivyCouncil to the Lords spiritual and temporal to the honourable the House of Commons to the Gentlemen of the Royal Society to the Worshipful the Board of Aldermen to the Club at  White  's to the Cricies at the  Bedford  to the Conno'sseurs at  Sam  's to the Society of  Grubstrect  and in short to all Degrees and Ranks of People for the just and favourable Reception they have been pleased to afford to the most delectable humorous and instructive Lucubrations that we have publish'd in this our  Gray  's  Inn  Journal  which has been the Delight of the choice Spirits of the Age the Terror of all Offenders against Decency and GoodManners and which has ascertained to the Author an immortal Reputation  Jamquè opus exegi quod nec Jovis ira nec ignes  Nec poterit serrum nec edax abolere vetustas  But having considered this Matter with sufficient Deliberation I have judged it eligible to decline both the Species of Writing above exhibited The Truth of it is as on the one Hand I am not so selfsufficient as to arrogate to myself any extraordinary Pride from the Degree of Success I have met with so on the other I do not think I can reasonably find any Fault with the Disposition of the Public to the present Writer I have all along steered between the two Extremes of partial popular Applause and a general Neglect and I have therefore no colourable Pretence to express the least Degree of Discontent at Parting nor vaingloriously to exult at the Applause which has been occasionally allowed to me  I am too sensible that a small Portion of Fame can be attributed to the Productions of a young Author hurried down the Stream of Dissipation interrupted by Avocations of a thousand Sorts seldom enabled to write at Leisure frequently obliged to dismiss the uncorrected Sheet to the Press rarely happy enough to have written up even to his own Taste and often checked in his Career by the Timidity of an Adventurer who was always diffident of his own Abilities and was sensible how far so young a Writer must be from those strong Powers of Mind which when matured by Age and Application animate and embolden Genius give Authority to Criticism add Strength to Compositions of a graver Cast and inspire an Author with a due Degree of Confidence  in his Decisions upon all Occurrences in human Life as likewise upon all Topics of Taste and Erudition  Though unattended with these Advantages it is however some kind of Satisfaction that I have been able to procure myself an Audience once a Week for two Years together from perhaps several Thousands in  Great Britain  and on this Occasion I cannot help taking to myself a secret Pleasure from the Reflection that I have given a kind of Weekly Memorial of my Existence and force Sort of Proof that my Time has not been thrown  in a Manner totally unavailing  Salust  has a very fine Sentiment which has made a very deep Impression on me  Verum enimvero is demum mihi vivere frui animâ videtur qui aliquo negotio intentus praeclari sacinoris aut artis honae famam quaerit  He may be said to live says that excellent Writer and to enjoy the Functions of his Soul who engaged in a laudable Occupation endeavours to distinguish himself by some splendid Action or by the Acquisition of Fame in some liberal Art  That I have in the last Way made myself conspicuous I cannot persuade myself in my most most sanguine Moments but I shall always enjoy the pleasure easure of a well meant Endeavour and when I look back to the Commencement of this Undertaking and revieiew the Means by which I have kept my Paper alive  will not be so prudish as to conceal a Degree of SelfApprobation  The Plan on which I have wrote however f  ble the Execution of it may be I am inclined to believe is not void of Merit In the Essay there was room for all Lands of fine Writing and in the News there was am  room to entertain the Fancy with Touches of Hu  r upon the various Occurrences of human Life  this Scheme has not been better cultivated in all  arts must be imputed to my having wrote singly  and this Consideration will I hope ren  Inaccuracies more excusable  When I say that I have wrote alone I do not mean that I never received any Assistance On the contrary I think it incumbent on me to acknowledge that a particular Friend who must be nameless has furnished me occasionally with several humorous Paragraphs of News written with a Delicacy of Humour peculiar to himself and I will add that I never withdrew from his Conversation without some Hint for the Entertainment of my Readers To this Gentleman I am indebted for a Letter from an  Englishman  in  Paris  No for a Scene at  Jonathan  's  CoffeeHouse  No for an Essay on I heatrical Parties No for an Essay on the modern Fashion of visiting No for a second Scene at  Jonathan  's No and for the Essays in and That I have not received more from him I have often thought it both a Loss to the  Gray  's  Inn Journal  and the Public as he possesses an elegant Facility on every Subject I sincerely wish that I had been able to prevail upon him against his natural Indolence to afford me a great deal more of his Assistance  A Paper upon what may be called Imitation in Writing and an Essay towards the fixing the Standard of modern Criticism together with some occasional Strokes of Humour in the true Intelligence were the Contributions of another ingenious Gentleman whose Friendship I am convinced would have inclined him to do something toward raising the Estimation of this Paper much higher had not Avocations of more Consequence to himself and the Public demanded the Exertion of his excellent Abilities in another Way  I must take this Opportunity to thank the Author of a Letter occasioned by my Criticism on King  Lear  which  in the Warmth of Friendship and in my Opition was written also in the Warmth of Genius An ingerious Essay on  Physiognomy  was also a Present from the Author of  Phil  lea  the Letter No upon a  the Ladies Teeth  is a  Jeu d'Esprit  by a  Gentleman of a very elegant and lively Fancy And now and then in the News there are either Articles sent by unknown Hands or Paragraphs raised upon their Hints But of these the Number is extremely small for every Thing else  Ranger  himself must stand accountable  I have now I think faithfully mentioned all the Assistance I received in the Course of this Paper and upon this Appearance of Matters I believe it will be sound very short of the Advantages enjoyed by some of my Brother Writers I have not had the Happiness of being puff'd in any of our common News Papers or in that entertaining and truly useful Work as Mr  Griffiths  calls the  Monthly Review  I have never been able to entertain the Town with the Writings of People of Fashion nor to lay before them an  Essay written by a Person of Honour  I could never boast the Friendship of the Nobility nor has any Lord sent me a Paper and upon Publication bought up a thousand Copies to shew me how well his own Performances sell I must however own that I have always exerted my utmost Abilities and have put every thing out of hand with as much Care as the Nature of periodical Productions the Author's Spirits and other Circumstances would permit I have ever had as great a Respect for the Public as  Tully  professes for a  Roman  Assembly and I agree with him when he says  nihil huc nisi perfectum ingenio elaboratum industriâ afferri opportere  At the same Time I hope it will be considered what Mr  Pope  observes with great Propriety that the Public should not expect that an Author's whole Time should be spent in polishing and retouching for their Pleasures  Besides why may not a Person rather chuse an Air of bold Negligence than the obscure Diligence of Pedants and Writers of affected Phraseology For my Part I have always thought an easy Stile more eligible than a pompous Diction lifted up by Metaphor amplisied  by Epithet and dignisied by too frequent Insertions of the  Latin  Idiom I am therefore inclined to flatter myself that my Expression has been natural and unambitious and that my Arrangement has been grammatically just unperplexed and clear and that upon all Occasions I have written with some Degree of Purity  Upon the whole if I cannot boast of having produced edifying Strains of Morality Dissertations of uncontrovertible Criticism and Papers of exquisite Mirth and Humour I hope at least the whole Plan has been conducted with a strict Regard to Decency and without any Offence against Virtue or good Manners To this Circumstance I believe it in a great Measure owing that I have been so savourably received by the Town but be the Cause what it may I shall always retain a grateful Sense of their Indulgence and in whatever Way hereafter I may endeavour to entertain them I shall think they have a Demand upon me for the most vigorous Exertion of my Abilities and let my Successbe as it will I at least hope I shall have Judgment enough not entirely to mistake my Talents  Having avowed these Sentiments I shall conclude without any studied flourish of Period and I remain with great Respect to all my Readers in particular and to the Public in general  Their most obliged and most obedient Servant  ARTHUR MURPHY  Tavistockrow  Oct    FINIS
