 FEMALE EMPIRE OR WINTER  Celebrated at  LONDON  FEMALE EMPIRE OR WINTER  celebrated at  LONDON  E'en  Spring  displeases when  She  smiles not here  But blest with  Her  'tis Spring thro' all the Year  LONDON  Printed for M COOPER at the  Globe  in  Paternoster Row  M DCC XLVI  FEMALE EMPIRE OR WINTER  Celebrated at  LONDON  _WHERE proud  Augusta  Empire of the Great  Sees a whole World pay Tribute at her Feet  Where social Pleasure with indulgent Sway  Chears ev'ry Breast and bids e'en  Want  be gay  The Muse beginsYe  British  FairOnes smile  So shall your Favours recompense my Toil  So shall Mankind the Ear attentive lend  Since All the World admires what You commend  FOR You kind Nature shifts the restless Year  And varying Seasons roll to bless the Fair  To charm your Footsteps thro' the winding Maze  Unfolding Spring a thousand Sweets displays  For You with genial Heat the Summer glows  Smiles in the Fields and blushes in the Rose  Autumnal Suns to gratify your Taste  With Fruits and Plenty crown the long Repast  And shiv'ring Winter charms no less than these  If Change of Joys can boast the Pow'r to please  Tir'd with the midday Heat and Ev'ning Gale  The widestretch'd Prospect and the flow'ry Vale  The bubbling Fountain and the Linnet's Song  For who can bear e'en  Harmony  too long  Cynthia  the Passion of contending Swains  Flies to the Town and leaves the sylvan Scenes  Unhappy Scenes the Birds forgot to sing  And Nature mourn'd her till returning Spring  Ye airy Sylphs who hover round the Fair  With Aid invisible but always near  Assist your Poet while his daring Muse  Sings the Diversions that the Nymph pursues  When frozen Streams in lazy Currents run  And the big Cloud portentous hides the Sun  See sullen Night with tardy Step retires  And in the Lamp the glimm'ring Flame expires  On Roofs of Snow reflected SunBeams play  And early Business fills the strait'ned Way  With Cries of diff'rent Note resounds the Street  And Coaches roll and jostling Carmen meet  On his deepfurrow'd Brow the Broker wears  Schemes yet in Embryo and unwieldy Cares  While the grave Doctor from the Tumult free  Lolls in his Chariot and expects the Fee  The Fair still slept while Sleep to FairOnes kind  Bid visionary Scenes divert her Mind  Where shone the Circles of the Great and Gay  Who shar'd the Dance and pass'd the Hours at Play  Where arm'd with Gallantry the welldress'd Beau  In Slumber bid the Cheek with Blushes glow  Till early Footmen with untimely Noise  And op'ning LapDogs interrupt her Joys  Then fled the airy Sweets of calm Repose  And the unwilling Maid with Sighs arose  Perus'd the Morning's Billetdoux with Care  And next to Beauty's Queen preferr'd her Pray'r  "Oh Thou whose Pow'r supreme and gentle Sway  "Not Mortals only but the  Gods  obey  "Celestial  Venus  Guardian of the Fair  "Who lives unheeded if without thy Care  "Still may Mankind thy sov'reign Rule adore  "And Altars blaze till Time shall be no more  "But Oh with full Success my Wishes crown  "Long may I reign the Fav'rite of the Town  "Long may I boast th' unrivall'd Pow'r to  kill  "Joy more than  Life  belov'd beyond  Quadrille  "With ev'ry Grace my faultless Form supply  "Till Prudes in secret rack'd with Envy die  "And when I wed if such the Will of Fate  "May no learn'd Pedant be my future Mate  "No Wretch who Gold prefers to Joys like thine  "Nor Sot enamour'd with the Fumes of Wine  "All Cares but Love with Pleasure I forego  "And all my Wishes centre in a Beau"  So pray'd nor vainly the Heartconqu'ring Fair  Love's Goddess list'ned and approv'd the Pray'r  Then bid t' adorn the Nymph each smiling Grace  With more than mortal Beauty arm her Face  Call forth the latent Mischiefs of her Eyes  And give the Blush that with the Morning vies  To crown the Whole inventive Fancy came  And with the Pow'r of Dress improv'd the Dame  From ev'ry Clime some gaudy Tribute bore  And deck'd her with the Spoils of  India  's Shore  While Fashion as the Ocean unconfin'd  Dispos'd each Charm to captivate the Mind  And now with warmer Pow'r the SunBeams glow  And Kennels widen with dissolving Snow  In ev'ry Street officious ShoeBoys ply  And meagre Poverty prefers its Cry  Touch'd with the Ills that wait on pining Woe  With lib'ral Hand their Alms the Good bestow  E'en  Av'rice  stops affected with the Sight  And e'er he cheats the Orphan gives his Mite  'Tis Noon and Business dwells in ev'ry Face  Directs the Eye and animates the Pace  Big with the Prospect of some future Gain  The Merchant's Haste nor Winds nor Show'rs detain  With unloop'd Hat he dares th' inclement Day  Nor heeds the dashing Spout or miry Way  So bent on Riches on th' unfriendly Waves  Impending Death the bold Advent'rer braves  Bears  India  's scorching Suns and  Zembla  's Cold  And mocks all Dangers for the Charms of Gold  Now  LudgateHill  with rattling Coaches swarms  And thro' the Sash the gaudy Tissue charms  Here croud  Britannia  's Pride intent t' express  The Pow'r of Fancy by their Skill in Dress  Vers'd in the Rhet'rick that supports his Trade  The smoothtongu'd Mercer shews the rich Brocade  Expatiates on the Labours of the Loom  And sells for Foreign Patterns wrought at Home  Pleas'd with the Whole in Hesitation lost  The Nymph stands doubtful which she fancies most  Till struck by something New she buys at last  Pays the full Price and glories in her Taste  Nor with less Judgment or inferior Grace  The artful Milaner harangues on Lace  Describes each Fashion that allures the Eye  The Mobb  Venetian  Quoif or airy Fly  What Ribbands suit the Fresh and what the Wan  And dwells upon the Colours of a Fan  Improves each Hint and hangs on ev'ry Tale  And keeps Discourse alive with Lungs that never fail  Is there a Poet whose capacious Rhimes  Can range distinct the Fashions of the Times  Wheree'er he dwells ye Muses round him shine  A Task so arduous calls for all the Nine  His let it be to sing in lofty Lays  The Hoop's wide Circle and the Diamond's Blaze  Paint the gay Ornaments that deck the Fair  And praise the wavy Ringlets of her Hair  But Time rolls on impatient of Delay  And Hunger sends the Citizen away  To Halls wellfurnish'd Liv'rymen repair  And feast in Fancy on the Bill of Fare  Calmly they drown th' eternal Feuds of State  And bid e'en Business till Tomorrow wait  Homeward returning see the blooming Fair  Pleas'd with her Bargains and devoid of Care  No gloomy Thought her peaceful Mind annoys  Nor Spleen malevolent disturbs her Joys  In the gay Chariot rais'd she rolls along  Safe from the Hardships that affect the Throng  Exults amidst the Rigours of the Day  And hears the whistling Tempest round her play  The witless Fop unheedful of the Storm  Stands fixt and wonders at th' angelic Form  Ling'ring looks back in Admiration lost  Nor gains his Senses till he meets a Post  So on the faithless Waves the SyrenTrain  With melting Airs the Mariner detain  Heedless he sails along the dang'rous Seas  Enchanted with the Music of their Lays  Till bulg'd upon some Rock he mourns too late  His Stay and yields unwillingly to Fate  Now Plenty triumphs o'er the genial Board  And grateful Wines a gen'rous Warmth afford  While Mirth Effect of Innocence prevails  And wakes the social Laugh with welltold Tales  Lively in Years perhaps historic Age  With  Britain  's Glories past their Thoughts engage  Recounts the Wonders  Nassau  's Conquests wrought  "  PRIOR  How  Anne  commanded and how  Malbro'  fought"  Then paints the Joys that wait on  Brunswick  's Name  And dwells in Raptures on the fav'rite Theme  Hence shall our Sons when long in future Days  Chearful they sit around th' enliv'ning Blaze  Rouz'd at the Mem'ry of  Rebellion  vile  Hereditary Vice of  Scotia  's Soil  Tell how their Fathers join'd War's doubtful Chance  To conquer Faction and to humble  France  How  William  glorious Name the Traitors drove  His Cause our Country and his Guardian  Jove  But softer Things the Female Band amuse  Than Wars Ambition Politics and News  To hardier Breasts they trust the Martial Toil  Kill with a Frown and conquer with a Smile  Theirs is the Task o'er Fashions to preside  And fix the changing Ornaments of Pride  Recount the Arts that captivate the Mind  Subdue th' Inconstant and attract the Blind  Safe in their Charms admire the wellform'd Plan  And join their Sex's Pow'r to conquer Man  Subjects so copious ask a longer Day  And Themes so fruitful wear the Hours away  But Pleasure calls and Scenes instructive glow  With all the mournful Eloquence of Woe  Monimia  fainting on  Castalio  cries  And sad  Arpasia  with  Moneses  dies  Mad as the Sea  Othello  raves distrest  And PatriotZeal inspires a  Cato  's Breast  Here wild Ambition mourns her tott'ring State  And Envy sickens at the Tyrant's Fate  There sorrowing Virtue pains the gen'rous Mind  And Love unpity'd bids the Fair be kind  These were the Arts that pleas'd a former Age  When  Booth  majestic grac'd  Britannia  's Stage  When  Oldfield  skill'd to paint distressful Woe  Bid marble Breasts with fond Compassion glow  And still they flourish still the Town may boast  Names not inferior e'en to those it lost  Garrick  each Passion that he feigns can move  And  Cibber  softens all the Soul to Love  In these survives what matchless  Shakespear  writ  And still the World admires a  Congreve  's Wit  The youthful Hero views th' inspiring Scenes  And martial Ardour kindles in his Veins  While the fond Virgin on the Brink of Fate  Warn'd by  Calista  shuns the dang'rous Bait  Ye modern Wits who emulous of Fame  Build on the Comic Scene the deathless Name  Would ye excell With strictest Care restrain  The Jest immodest and the Phrase prophane  So shall the gen'ral Shout your Toil repay  And  Britain  's Fair attend the Poet's Day  The moral Tale shall please the virtuous Youth  And  Guilt  alone shall redden at the Truth  Thus chearful WinterEv'nings roll away  And gay Diversions crown the short'ned Day  Joys yet unsung t' amuse the Fair remain  And Skies inclement spend their Rage in vain  Attentive  Whist  Wisk  and courtly Visits call  And Pomp and Splendor animate the Ball  Days quickrevolving Change of Pleasures bring  And glad the Fancy till returning Spring  FINIS
