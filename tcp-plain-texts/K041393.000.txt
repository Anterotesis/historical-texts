 A PINDARIQUE ODE Humbly Offer'd to the QUEEN ON THE Victorious Progress of Her MAJESTY's Arms under the Conduct of the Duke of MARLBOROUGH  To which is prefix'd A DISCOURSE on the PINDARIQUE ODE  By Mr  CONGREVE  Operosa parvus  Carmina fingo  Hor Ode L  Tuque dum procedis Io triumphe  Non semel dicemus Io triumphe  Civitas omnis dabimus{que} Divis  Thura benignis  Ibid  LONDON  Printed for  Jacob Tonson  within  GraysInn  Gate next  GraysInn  Lane  A DISCOURSE ON THE PINDARIQUE ODE  THE following Ode is an Attempt towards restoring the Regularity of the Ancient Lyrick Poetry which seems to be altogether forgotten or unknown by our  English  Writers  There is nothing more frequent among us than a sort of Poems intituled Pindarique Odes pretending to be written in Imitation of the Manner and Stile of  Pindar  and yet I do not know that there is to this Day extant in our Language one Ode contriv'd after his Model What Idea can an  English  Reader have of  Pindar  to whose Mouth when a Child the Bees  Pausan Boeotic  brought their Honey in Omen of the future Sweetness and Melody of his Songs when he shall see such rumbling and grating Papers of Verses pretending to be Copies of his Works  The Character of these late Pindariques is a Bundle of rambling incoherent Thoughts express'd in a like parcel of irregular Stanza's which also consist of such another Complication of disproportion'd uncertain and perplex'd Verses and Rhimes And I appeal to any Reader if this is not the Condition in which these Titular Odes appear  On the contrary there is nothing more regular than the Odes of  Pindar  both as to the exact Observation of the Measures and Numbers of his Stanza's and Verses and the perpetual Coherence of his Thoughts For tho' his Digressions are frequent and his Transitions sudden yet is there ever some secret Connexion which tho' not always appearing to the Eye never fails to communicate it self to the Understanding of the Reader  The Liberty which he took in his Numbers and which has been so misunderstood and misapply'd by his pretended Imitators was only in varying the Stanza's in different Odes but in each particular Ode they are ever Correspondent one to another in their Turns and according to the Order of the Ode  All the Odes of  Pindar  are Songs of Triumph Victory or Success in the  Grecian  Games They were sung by a Chorus and adapted to the  Lyre  and sometimes  to the  Lyre  and  Pind Olym    Pipe  they consisted oftnest of Three Stanza's the first was call'd the  Strophé  from the Version or circular Motion of the Singers in that Stanza from the Right Hand to the Left  Or from the Left to the Right for the  Scholiasts  differ in that as may be seen in  Pind Schol Introduc ad Olymp  And  Alex ab Alexandro  L C speaking of the Ceremony of the Chorus says  Cursum auspicati a Laeva dextrorsum  ox a dextra Laevorsum  But the Learned  Schmidius  takes part with the first Opinion as more consistent with the Notions of the Ancients concerning the Motions of the Heavenly Spheres and agreeable to  Homer  there cited by him See  Eras Schmid Prolegom in Olymp de Carmin Lyric  The second Stanza was call'd the  Antistrophé  from the Contraversion of the  Chorus  the Singers in performing that turning from the Left Hand to the Right contrary always to their Motion in the  Strophé  The Third Stanza was call'd the  Epode  it may be as being the Aftersong which they sung in the middle neither turning to one Hand nor the other  What the Origin was of these different Motions and Stations in singing their Odes is not our present business to enquire Some have thought that by the Contrariety of the  Strophé  and  Antistrophé  they intended to represent the Contrarotation of the  Primum Mobile  in respect of the  Secunda Mobilia  and that by their standing still at the  Epode  they meant to signifie the Stability of the Earth  Pind Schol Schmid  ibid  Others ascribe the Institution to  Theseus  who thereby expressed the Windings and Turnings of the Labyrinth in celebrating his Return from thence  The Method observ'd in the Composition of these Odes was therefore as follows The Poet having made choice of a certain Number of Verses to constitute his  Strophé  or first  Stanza  was oblig'd to observe the same in his  Antistrophé  or second  Stanza  and which accordingly perpetually agreed whenever repeated both in number of Verses and quantity of Feet He was then again at liberty to make a new choice for his third  Stanza  or  Epode  where accordingly he diversify'd his Numbers as his Ear or Fancy led him composing that  Stanza  of more or fewer Verses than the former and those Verses of different Measures and Quantities for the greater Variety of Harmony and Entertainment of the Ear  But then this  Epode  being thus form'd he was strictly oblig'd to the same  Vid Jul Scal Poetic ad Fin Cap    l    Measure as often as he should repeat it in the order of his Ode so that every  Epode  in the same Ode is eternally the same in Measure and Quantity in respect to it self as is also every  Strophé  and  Antistrophé  in respect to each other  The  Lyrick  Poet  Stesichorus  whom  Longin de Sub c    Longinus  reckons amongst the ablest Imitators of  Homer  and of whom  Quint Inst l    c    Quintilian  says that if he could have kept within bounds he would have been nearest of any Body in Merit to  Homer  was if not the Inventer of this Order in the Ode yet so strict an Observer of it in his Compositions that the Three  Stanza  's of  Stesichorus  became a common Proverb to express a thing universally known    de vehementer indocto imperito dici solitum Erasm Adag  ne tria quidem Stesichori nosti  so that when any one had a mind to reproach another with  excessive Ignorance he could not do it more effectually than by telling him  he did not so much as know the Three Stanza's of  Stesichorus that is did not know that an Ode ought to consist of a  Strophé  an  Antistrophé  and an  Epode  If this was such a mark of Ignorance among them I am sure we have been pretty long liable to the same Reproof I mean in respect of our Imitations of the Odes of  Pindar  My Intention is not to make a long Preface to a short Ode nor to enter upon a Dissertation of Lyrick Poetry in general But thus much I thought proper to say for the Information of those Readers whose Course of Study has not led 'em into such Enquiries  I hope I shall not be so misunderstood as to have it thought that I pretend to give an exact Copy of  Pindar  in this ensuing Ode or that I look upon it as a Pattern for his Imitators for the future Far from such Thoughts I have only given an Instance of what is practicable and am sensible that I am as distant from the Force and Elevation of  Pindar  as others have hitherto been from the Harmony and Regularity of his Numbers  Again we having no  Chorus  to sing our Odes the Titles as well as Use of  Strophe Antistrophe  and  Epode  are Obsolete and Impertinent And certainly there may be very good  English  Odes without the Distinction of  Greek  Appellations to their Stanza's That I have mention'd 'em here and observ'd the Order of 'em in the ensuing Ode is therefore only the more intelligibly to explain the extraordinary Regularity of the Composition of those Odes which have been represented to us hitherto as the most confus'd Structures in Nature  However tho' there be no necessity that our Triumphal Odes should consist of the Three aforemention'd Stanza's yet if the Reader can observe that the great Variation of the Numbers in the Third Stanza call it  Epode  or what you please has a pleasing Effect in the Ode and makes him return to the First and Second Stanza's with more Appetite than he could do if always cloy'd with the same Quantities and Measures I cannot see why some Use may not be made of  Pindar  's Example to the great Improvement of the  English  Ode There is certainly a Pleasure in beholding any Thing that has Art and Difficulty in the Contrivance especially if it appears so carefully executed that the Difficulty does not shew it self 'till it is sought for and that the seeming Easiness of the Work first sets us upon the Enquiry Nothing can be call'd Beautiful without Proportion When Symmetry and Harmony are wanting neither the Eye nor the Ear can be pleas'd Therefore certainly  Poetry  which includes Painting and Musick should not be destitute of 'em and of all  Poetry  especially the  Ode  whose End and Essence is Harmony  Mr  Cowley  in his Preface to his Pindarique Odes speaking of the Musick of Numbers says  which sometimes especially in Songs and Odes almost without any thing else makes an Excellent Poet  Having mention'd Mr  Cowley  it may very well be expected that something should be said of him at a time when the Imitation of  Pindar  is the  Theme of our Discourse But there is that great Deference due to the Memory great Parts and Learning of that Gentleman that I think nothing should be objected to the Latitude he has taken in his Pindarique Odes The Beauty of his Verses are an Attonement for the Irregularity of his Stanza's and tho' he did not imitate  Pindar  in the Strictness of his Numbers he has very often happily copy'd him in the Force of his Figures and Sublimity of his Stile and Sentiments  Yet I must beg leave to add that I believe those irregular Odes of Mr  Cowley  may have been the principal tho' innocent Occasion of so many deformed Poems since which instead of being true Pictures of  Pindar  have to use the  Italian  Painters Term been only  Caricatura  's of him Resemblances that for the most part have been either Horrid or Ridiculous  For my own part I frankly own my Error in having heretofore miscall'd a few irregular  Stanza  's a Pindarique Ode and possibly if others who have been under the same Mistake would ingenuously confess the Truth they might own that never having consulted  Pindar  himself they took all his Irregularity upon trust and finding their Account in the great Ease with which they could produce Odes without being oblig'd either to Measure or Design remain'd satisfy'd and it may be were not altogether unwilling to neglect being undeceiv'd  Tho' there be little if any thing left of  Orpheus  but his Name yet if  Boeotic pag    Pausanias  was well inform'd we may be assur'd that  Brevity  was a Beauty which he most industriously labour'd to preserve in his  Hymns  notwithstanding as the same Author reports that they were but few in Number  The Shortness of the following Ode will I hope attone for the Length of the Preface and in some measure for the Defects which may be found in it It consists of the same Number of Stanza's with that beautiful Ode of  Pindar  which is the first of his  Pythicks  and tho' I was unable to imitate him in any other Beauty I resolv'd to endeavour to Copy his Brevity and take the Advantage of a Remark he has made in the last  Strophé  of the same Ode which take in the Paraphrase of  Sudorius  Qui multa paucis stringere Commode  Novere morsus hi facile invidos  Spernunt auris mens{que} pura  Omne supervacuum rejectat  ODE  I  DAughter of Memory

Arcadia  found a living Tortoise which he carried home with him to his Cradle and immediately compos'd a Harp of the Shell A little after he stole the Oxen of  Apollo  this caus'd some Difference between the Deities but the Matter being referr'd to  Jupiter  he order'd  Mercury  to return the Oxen to the right Owner on this there follow'd not only a Reconciliation but Friendship and  Apollo  expressing an extream Pleasure at the Invention of the Harp  Mercury  bestow'd it on him as a Pledge of his future Friendship Of this  Homer in his Hymn to  Mercury speaks at large Afterwards  Apollo  inventing another Instrument call'd the  Cithera  gave the  Lyra  to  Orpheus  The  Muses  after the Death of  Orpheus  Translated his  Harp  into Heav'n where it became a Constellation and is plac'd

Lucan  in his Third Book  V  gives it the indefinite Epithete of  Multifidi Istri  But  Ovid  Trist  Solus ad ingressus missus Septemplicis Istri  And  Sidonius Apollinaris  gives it the same Epithete on the like Occasion with this  Ode  when in his Panegyrick to  Majorianus Caesar  he tells him  Illicet aggrederis quod nullus tempore nostro  Augustus potuit rigidum Septemplicis Istri  Agmen in arma rapis  The Ancient Geographers differ'd very much in their Account of the Rise of this River so that on a double account the same Epithets may be appropriated to it as are usual to the  Nile  Sevenmouth'd  Ister  's secret Head  To save th' Imperial State Her hardy  Britons  led  II  Nor there thy Song should end tho' all the Nine  Might well their Harps and Heav'nly Voices join  To Sing
