Wretches so mean that they went on so silly an Errand as to  sift Mr  CURLL as Mr  Pope  in his Narrative informs the Public  _SINCE the Publication of the THIRD  Volume  of our  Literary Correspondence  I have not been pestered with the Impertinence of  Brocade  or  Tim Lancet  or any of your  Gang  However to redeem your Character in some Measure from its present  Contempt I will send ye on a much more reputable Embassy than Mr  Pope  has done in constituting ye his Examiners an Employ only fit for that Chindropping driveling cowardly Scribler of the BASTARD S***** by making a faithful Report to the Public of the Contents of this FOURTH  Volume  YE are first to observe that as the  Jesuits  deduce their Original from St IGNATIUS LOYALA in like Manner is Mr POPE the Founder of this Scheme of  Literary Correspondence  YE are next to assure all Persons who are so kind as to give you Audience that to prevent the least Suspicion of Spuriosity they may see every Letter I have ever printed of Mr  Pope  's in his  Own HandWriting  not copied either from  Twickenham  or  DoverStreet  MSS as Mr  Minshul  the late Librarian will in Justice to me assert  This Volume opens with the Promised Collection of  Historical Letters  from the  Revolution  to the Year  Next follow Original Letters of Bishop  Barlow  Bishop  Fleetwood  Bishop  Atterbury  his Character by Bishop  Smalridge  and a Defence of the  Newtonian  Philosophy by Mr Secretary  Addison  all which will subsist by their own Immortal Merit  A  LoveScene  from  Rome  succeeds being the Original Letters which

POSTSCRIPT  Pray with my  Respects  to Mr POPE tell him I am sorry that  Ill Health Ill Humour Ill Weather and the Want of a Coach  should all conspire to prevent his paying that Visit to LUCRETIA  A noted CastoffPunk of his pious  SaintJohn  Mrs  Griffith  alias  Butler  alias  Lucretia Lindo  who has several Letters of Mr  Pope  's not worth Printing  which she lately expected from Him and tho' she will not by any Means admit of the Term  Affectionate  he may subscribe Himself her  humble  Servant  The Lady is eloped from her last Lodging but  He  may hear of his  Deary  at the  Old Place  She hopes the Picture will please now the Painter has retouched it  'Tis strange that still our Bard the  Truth  will shun  For  Wrong  is  Wrong  whereever it be done  Adv  from  Hor  Historical Letters  LETTER I  June  SIR  YOU see the Upshot of the  Information  against the BISHOPS his Majesty was in the Camp at  Hounslow  the Soldiers huzza'd at the News as loudly as the Mob at  WestminsterHall  Mob did I say It was a Multitude of Nobility Gentry and Citizens of the best Note The King was terribly chagrin'd he ask'd what Noise was that They told him Nothing but the Soldiers rejoicing at the Acquittal of the Bishops Do you call that Nothing says he  Lord Chief Justice  Wright  is an excellent Chief the Most Christian King might find him a very useful Magistrate in  Languedoc  at this Time The Command of a Province in  Turkey  would admirably suit his Genius The Forms of the Law of  England  were a great Restraint upon his Zeal the Spirit of Tyranny in his Office and Adulation towards his Prince which generally go together had such an Ascendant over him that he broke thro' all Decency he could not converse with Mr Justice  Powell  upon the Points of Law without maltreating him He has such an Aversion to poor Sir  B Shower  and had at the same Time so little Command of his Temper that he insulted him tho' he was for the Prosecution This arbitrary Behaviour of great Magistrates in silencing Counsel whose Faces they do not like is of greater Consequence to the Public than People generally seem to apprehend But a fitter Opportunity of treating the Man ill could hardly be chosen for the Generality of the Audience were prejudic'd against him on Account of the Service he was engaged in and were therefore prepared to approve of all the ill Usage that could be offer'd to him On the other hand the King had little Occasion for him for the SollicitorGeneral was a Minion as scurrilous as  Billingsgate  as prostitute and impudent as  DruryLane  When this Tryal is printed I hope the odious Colours that the principal Characters will appear in both at the Bar and on the Bench will have a good Effect on the Gentlemen  of the Profession for the growing Generation as young  Spartans  were taught to hate Drunkenness by seeing the odious Effects of it upon their Slaves If Judges and Statesmen would only examine themselves by the Faults of those who stand condemned in History and ask Questions like these Am I  Hubert de Burgo  Am I  Tresilian  Am I  Sejanus  Am I  Villers  Am I guilty of the Crime for which this Man's Memory is justly hated I say were Men thus to reflect they would forget the TipStaves the Trainbearer and Collar of  SS  the Coronet and the Blue Ribbon They would not bear being branded Villains to Posterity and if true Philanthropy and Patriotism could not enter into every Breast there would at least be an Appearance of them Men would learn to be affable benign Lovers of Justice or to seem so there would be that Resemblance of the Virtues that Mankind would be deceived and satisfied Don't tell me of a Man's Eminence in his Profession or the high Post he fills in the State his Learning and Knowledge of the World have not enlarged his Mind he is still a little poor Wretch if he does not remember what a small Part he makes among the Current of Ages He looks about him and fancies the present Scene the only one of great Importance that  Time has produc'd and three to one esteems himself the most considerable Character exhibited in it Where was this Man bred Is he ignorant what a Racket the SchoolBoys make with  Alexander  and  Caesar  and  Sylla  with  Cato  and  Brutus  and  Aristides  But enough of this I suppose we shall have the Tryal printed in a Month In the mean while I send you Part of what Mr  Somers  said he was Junior Counsel for the Bishops he was very brief is much applauded for that little he did say but I suppose will not suddenly be made a Judge nor King's Counsel neither The Heat of Mens Minds at the Trial was violent on all Sides  The SollicitorGeneral  Williams  did not scruple to say that if the Bishops were commanded to do any Thing against their Consciences they should have acquiesced till the Meeting of the Parliament they should not have petitioned And this vile immodest Assertion was received with sufficient Indecency People hiss'd at him for that and for something else in his Speech as you would at a very bad Play Mr Justice  Powell  's Zeal on the other Side was so eager to settle the Point that the Petition was no Libel that he did not stick to affirm to the Jury that it could  not be a Libel unless it were false But this I fear is false Doctrine in our Law tho' 'tis to be wish'd it were true I only mention it to shew you what a Ferment the World is in Upon the Whole 'tis thought by some of the wisest and most loyal People in the Kingdom that we have but a dismal Prospect before us 'Tis evident that if the Grand Monarch don't effectually interpose and pinch the  Dutch  the Prince of  Orange  will speedily invade the Kingdom If he should succeed what loyal Breast can bear to think the Consequences Will he come here like a Hero in Romance only to mind other Peoples Business and then be gone again I tremble to reflect what is to become of sacred Majesty to recollect the shocking Fates of imprison'd  English  Kings our  Edward Richard  and the Royal Martyr his Adage was verified in them all On the other hand what if the Prince should be prevented or be defeated What Protestant Soul is not shaken in the midst of all its Loyalty to think of the Wonders that may be wrought both in Religion and Liberty by the Gentlemen at  Hounslow  'Tis true the Majority of them are Protestants at present and many of their Officers are Men of Quality and Fortune I am sorry for the King's sake I can only say Majority  but 'tis as true that if there be not Papists and Soliders of Fortune enough in  England  there are in  Scotland  and  Ireland  to shift out the Protestants and Men of Worth and then if the Cause of the Bishops or of  MagdalenCollege  should be brought before them they will do Business in a Stile yet more concise than  Wright  and  Allybone  or  Jefferies  and the Bishop of  Chester  can pretend to But should their Establishment be in Consequence of an Invasion and of a Victory obtain'd against the Invader then may we expect to see a standing Army made Part of the Constitution Whenever that happens Parliaments can't be longliv'd The Soldier will never starve while the Housholder has any Thing to eat How happy should we be if the King would content himself with or Masses aDay for the Good of his own Soul and permit his good Subjects to go to the Devil if they liked But we are come to this miserable Option  The King or the People must be ruin'd  and the Wonder is  The King himself makes the  Dilemma I forgot to tell you that Serjeant  Pemberton  in his Argument took Occasion to mention Popery and boldly said  'twas the very worst of all Religions  LETTER II  Sept  I Agree with you that Kings might benefit by reading History with Attention as much as their Ministers and Judges perhaps they might much more as the Sphere they move in is higher I wish ours had observ'd in the Life of his Grandfather  Henry  IV of  France  Father of Queen  HenriettaMaria  Wise of King  Charles  I  Henry  the Great or  Davila  's History of the  Holy League  that the wisest Hugonot in  France  advis'd the King to turn Papist or give up all Thoughts of the Crown The Parallel is natural The very Palace of  Whitehall  his Father's Statue at  CharingCross  ought to be effectual Memento's of the Rage of a jealous People who fear at once for Religion and Property If once our zealous  London  Herd break loose not all the Magic in the  Roman  Missal will be able to charm them not all the Thunder in the  Vatican  to frighten them And 'tis believed  Pope  Innocent  XI  that  Jupiter  would be a pleased Spectator of the Broil  The military Gentlemen are the only useful Folks on such Emergencies and they will hardly be persuaded to destroy  their own Religion There must be a Reform first and a Recruit from  Scotland  and  Ireland  Indeed if a King of  England  were only to desire to enslave his People an Army would make the Game sure No Matter how or on what Occasion they came together they naturally resolve to continue together for that is their very Life and Existence Like Bodies in the animal World they endeavour their own Preservation and that is by the Destruction of the Rights of Mankind Food as proper for them as Grass for Oxen having neither Liberty nor Property themselves they readily concur to destroy them in others that is only levelling but it ends better still for them for when they have enslaved the People they are rewarded with the easiest Chains the uppermost Rank among Slaves and often find out their own Strength and please themselves in chopping and changing their Masters I can't be particular on a sudden but I believe  Rome  and  Constantinople  afford forty or fifty Instances to this Purpose  But we have at present Religion mixed with our Politics and that puts us out of all Danger for who doubts the Religion of an Army Perhaps every one does not apprehend it but seriously Armies sometimes have Religion When  Henry  III of  France  was murder'd in his Camp his great Successor lost two Thirds of the Army in a Month by Desertion because of his Difference in Religion tho' they all ador'd him for many Royal Virtues Who denies Religion such as it was to our  British  Armies of Covenanters There was indeed one Army of  Roman  Catholicks in the last War in  Ireland  who prefer'd their Loyalty to one of the Tenets of their Religion The Pope's Nuncio excommunicated the Earl of  Clanrickard  and his Adherents for continuing steady in their Allegiance to King  Charles  and the Earl of  Clanrickard  at the Head of his Army excommunicated the Pope's Nuncio by Beat of Drum But as to our own Army let its Religion be what it will I wish the King had Impressions somewhat weaker than he has of Churchof  England  Loyalty Some overweening Doctors have persuaded him that we are all Saints but when we are brought to a severe Test the most of us will be found mere frail Sinners I wish those divine Gentlemen had mixed a moderate Proportion of human Prudence with their politic Theology that Principles might not be strain'd till they break His Confessors should consider what an unkingly an ungenerous Conclusion they inculcate  The Principles of the Church of  England  oblige  her Sons to endure every Thing therefore we will bruise them with a Rod of Iron  Are such Men fit to rule Kingdoms are they sit to govern a GrammarSchool  LETTER III  Octob  THE too near Neighbourhood of  Holland  has thrown our Administration into a violent Ague the hot Fit and the cold quickly succeed each other Publick Justice is in a fluctuating Condition it depends on the Winds and Weather like the Rate of Insurance of Ships on their Voyages By the Proceedings of the HighCommissionCourt we know which Way the Wind blows 'tis a mere Barometer with this Difference from the common Experiment with  Mercury  that the Credit and Power of that Court rise high with a Westerly Wind or a Storm an Easterly Gale sinks them down to nothing  An old Gentleman a Friend of mine determin'd to mount in Armour for his Majesty when first he heard of this Invasion he has an inveterate Enmity to the Whigs for cutting down his Timber in the Days of Sequestration But indeed this  last low little Shuffling between Grace and Oppression has brought him to have a very mean Opinion of the Royal Candour and Integrity as well as of the Wisdom and Honesty of the Counsellors And now my Friend is resolved to wait the Event of Affairs in a whole Skin an Alteration which I strongly suspect to have happen'd to many and even to some of the military People The Instability of our Councils is a sure Symptom of a languishing Cause A Soul by Turns so temerarious and pusillanimous as on every little Opportunity to fly out into Acts of Wrong and on every little Check shamefully to cry  Peccavi  Such a soul is only fit to animate the worst of Tyrants I think 'twas  Caligula  that would run and hide under the Bed when it thunder'd but could piss on the Statues of the Gods when he thought the Danger was over and it was he too that wish'd the People of  Rome  had but one Neck that he might destroy them at a Stroke Surely the Ministers design to pervert People from their Loyalty they could never else give such manifest Occasion for Defection A Verbose  Frenchman  told the Cardinal  de Richlieu  that God might rest the Government of the whole World on the Cardinal's Wisdom If this Compliment were true our Country might afford a tolerable  Contrast for we have got Statesmen equal to the Task if the Almighty in his Wrath should resolve to destroy the World by the Pravity of human Councils But he that brings Good out of Evil is yet able to save us  LETTER IV  Novemb  I Don't wonder you should suspect me to be almost a Whig for 'tis most certain I can't persuade myself to draw a Sword to destroy my Religion and Liberty And yet I wish a Temper could be found to save both Prince and People It is true that there are Dangers to be apprehended from the Invader and that must be the Case let who will draw the Sword for us I also agree with you that there is no natural Connection between Popery and Slavery that the Design of imposing both at once on this Nation is only accidental that a Protestant Prince may forge Chains for his People as well as a Popish one that Protestant  Danes  are Slaves and Popish  Switzers  Freemen But thus stands our particular Case Our Prince has avow'd a Design to govern without Law the Invader disclaims that  odious Project We are certain of our Ruin on the one Hand we have some reasonable Hopes of escaping on the other  It would not be easy for the Invader immediately to become absolute That would depend upon a StandingArmy The Power he brings won't be sufficient to effect his principal Enterprize without a large Concurrence of  Englishmen  and the Officers will be generally People of Families who will hardly on a sudden concur with Foreigners to enslave themselves And I think the Prince's Hands will be too full of Enemies both at home and abroad to hazard the Loss of his new Friends as soon as he has got them and to provoke the same People who invited him in to turn him out again No Ministers that he can employ will suddenly give such Advice Even Ministers don't love StandingArmies don't desire to see their Prince above Law unless they have had time enough to commit Crimes that make them afraid of Law and glad of the Refuge of an arbitrary Protection they approve of and advance an absolute Power to protect them only in Proportion to their own Necessities A Man who has acquir'd a good Fortune naturally wishes to secure his Property in it and to transmit that Property safe to his Posterity Nothing but the Terrors that attend on Guilt can  alter that Desire and they indeed can alter it If he knows that his injur'd Country has had Cause to demand Vengeance upon him he verifies the Devil's Observation  All that a Man hath will he give for his Life  LETTER V  Decemb  WE have it from the best Authority that  When a Man's Works please the Lord he maketh his Enemies to be at Peace with him  Since this is so 'tis plain the King's Works have not pleased the Lord for his Servants his intimate Confidants his very Children have deserted him From the Highest to the Lowest the Prince and Princess of  Denmark  the Lord  Churchill  the Magistrates the very Footmen and common Soldiers shift for themselves and avoid his ruin'd Fortune  The Royal Sovereign's sinking the very Rats as by Instinct have quit it  The Prince of  Orange  must devise a Motto more expressive of Success than  Veni Vidi Vici  for he has got a potent Kingdom without striking a Stroke And yet a Thousand of these Instances can't make weak Princes wise Had ours been less  happy on the first Day of his Reign he might perhaps have escaped his Errors and Misfortunes His Purse was full his People rich his Revenue so large that it hardly requir'd an Addition to maintain a great Army His Nobility and Gentry his Clergy and Universities his Counties and Boroughs professed their Loyalty in the most affectonate Terms and yet in less than four Years time to use them all so ill that Affection or Loyalty to him should hardly be found in the whole Nation 'Tis prodigious  H  who is particularly pleased with this Turn of Affairs says that  Waller  prophesied it in his Poem on the Marriage of the Prince and Princess of  Orange  he points out these Lines for that Purpose  Ten thousand Thanks the Nation owes  To him who does protect us all  For while he thus his Niece bestows  About our Isle he builds a Wall  Stronger than that which  Athens  had  By th'Oracle's Advice of Wood  Had theirs been such as  Charles  has made  Their mighty State till now had stood  But if  Waller  prophesied he prophesied unwittingly like  Caiaphas  the High Priest or perhaps like  Virgil  in his  Pollio  for he was too devoted to the Court and had too little Pain for his Country to dream of what has happen'd at this Day  LETTER VI  Decemb  I Don't suppose that the Country is in perfect Tranquillity Our Tumults in Town certainly equal those at  Constantinople  when they depose their Sultans I should not like at present to be mistaken for a Papist much less for a Jesuit in the Streets of  London  We must never more pretend to be a civilized People nor call the  Asiaticks  nor  Africans  Barbarous 'Tis a Reproach to the Nation that no Method is found to restrain the Licence of the raging Multitude Not content with hunting the Priests and Friars and demolishing their Popish Countrymen they have violated the Law of Nations the Character of Ambassadors has not been sacred to them  If one could be a mere Spectator of their Pranks without any Concern for the Reputation of our Country they have been exhibiting a Farce to us ridiculous enough  in Conscience they have by Mistake fallen upon their best Friend the  Spanish  Ambassador as Sir  Martin Marrall  often does upon his trusty Servant  Warner  They little know how devoted the  Don  is to their Party There are also great Numbers among them who rise to pillage and would be glad to plunder the Rich of both Parties  It is wonderful that those who are most deeply concerned were the last in the Kingdom to foresee these Calamities Surely Men are infatuated on these Occasions We hardly find in History a weak Prince who foresees his own Ruin a Month beforehand Nay they are generally more secure near the  Crisis  of their Fate than ever they were before as if  Solomon  's Observation were constantly to be verified  Pride cometh before Destruction and an haughty Spirit before a Fall  LETTER VII  February th  JActa est Alea  We have drawn the Sword and thrown away the Scabbard We have put it out of our Power to retreat Some thought that in Consequence  of laying aside the King the Birth of the Young Gentleman would naturally have been the next Enquiry and indeed if he had been left in the Kingdom it could not easily have been avoided But I suppose his Friends thought the Air of  London  bad for his Health for if you look into the Bills of Mortality you will find that abundance of Children drop off under two Years of Age Now since he is gone if the late King's Abdication I think that is the Word be right it will be also right to reject the Youth tho' his Birth should be ever so Royal for will not he have Education and  The Words in the Vote of Abdication  Advice from Priests and Jesuits and other wicked Persons of the Church of Rome  Not that the History of the WarmingPan is wholly to be lost Men of different Complexions are capable of different Reasonings and different Faiths One Man may renounce him for being the Son of King  James  and another for not being so  This new Word Abdicate has occasioned a great Display of Learning on the Debate of the Vote It seems our own Law which says  the King can do no Wrong  was too modest to supply a Word proper  for the present Purpose so that the Civilians were so kind as to lend us this Term of Art I believe I shall be able to send you the whole Debate in a little Time I shall therefore for the present only obviate a Mistake which some Gentlemen have fallen into as if by the Word Abdicate the King's Flight were only intended It would have been too severe to deprive him of his Crown for flying when it was not safe for him to stay And I am well informed that it stands in the Vote neither to mean his Flight nor any express Declaration of his but it will be best understood by comparing Mr  Somers  's Explanation of it with the Vote itself  A Man  says he  may Abdicate a Thing when he does an Act which is inconsistent with the retaining it tho' there be not an express Renunciation  Calvin  's Lexic Juridic Generum Abdicat qui sponsam Repudiat he that divorces his Wife abdicates his SoninLaw  I transcribe the Vote for you lest you should not have it by you  Resolved That King  James  the Second having endeavoured to subvert the Constitution of the Kingdom by breaking the Original Contract between King and People and by the Advice of Jesuits and other wicked Persons having violated the fundamental Law and withdrawn himself  out of the Kingdom hath Abdicated the Government and that the Throne is thereby Vacant  The other Vote for filling the Throne which sets the Prince on it as well as the Princess the executive Power to be in him is something like  Harry  the Seventh's Accession or rather stronger and more explicite for his Pretensions to an Hereditary Right were well known but he thought it prudent to leave the Matter complicated  There is nothing new in this whole Transaction nor more wonderful than what has happened heretofore in many other Kingdoms On such violent Concussions new Families have sometimes sprung up and sometimes Democracies Great Earthquakes change the Courses of Rivers level Mountains and raise the Vallies  LETTER VIII  THey tell us Wonders here of the  English  Colony of  Londonderry  in  Ireland  they fight and strave like the ancient  Saguntines  They deserve our early Care of them for if we have done  right I am sure they cannot be in the Wrong Their Grievances and their Dangers were much more importunate than our own I thought every Thing degenerated which was carried into that Country It seems I am mistaken or perhaps Oppression which makes a wise Man Mad can also make a Coward Valiant I fear we are generally too partial to our own Home and injuriously so with Regard to our Neighbours A truebred  English  Squire believes his Countrymen to be more powerful more valiant more wealthy more numerous more polite more learned more wise not ouly than any other Nation but than all the Nations on the Face of the Earth put together If we could look on other Countries with an impartial Eye we might see that they have Numbers of People and Sources of Wealth and that they can either think or fight as well as ourselves The old Aldermen in all our CountryBoroughs have learned from  Baker  's Chronicle the Successes of our  Edwards  and our  Henries  against  France  They also know enough of our Story to tell us that  Scotland  was not with us in those Days and that  Ireland  was of no Benefit to us but they forget that the best Provinces of modern  France  were then under Princes of their own mortal Enemies to that Crown  they do not perceive the intestine Disorders which made Way for the  English  Arms Nor how easy it was for a Neighbouring Prince who had their Royal Blood in his Veins to make Parties among a People of his own Religion and how impossible that Piece of Policy has been rendered by the Reformation Modern  France  has at least twenty Millions of People and the whole  British  Empire not half that Number The like Alteration has been produced in  Spain  long since our Black Prince made a Figure on that Part of the Continent That Country of many Kingdoms is become one So that tho our ancient Kings in the Holy War may have been as great and powerful as any of their Neighbours yet we have Reason to suspect that not even the Access of  Scotland  under the same Allegiance with us nor the Growth of  Ireland  in People in Civility and in Wealth have been able to make us keep Pace with the vast Increase of Power in the Crowns of  France  and  Spain  since the Times I mentioned And Heaven only knows what  Scotland  will do now  If we expect to be of Importance in  Europe  ought we not to make a Coalition with those who are both of our own Blood and our own Religion and not  force them by Hardships into a Spirit of Faction  Cromwell  in one of his Parliaments rejected many Boroughs and increased the Number of Representatives for Counties I have been told the late Lord  Clarendon  used to say  That this was an Amendment to be wished for in better  TIMES  Oliver  brought the Representatives of the Three Kingdoms to sit in one Parliament Is not this also an Alteration to be wished for at all Times It is a Proposition which indeed ought to be an Axiom in our Politicks that these Kingdoms can never make a great and happy Empire whilst the constituent Parts envy the Prosperity of each other whilst the Stronger oppresses the Weaker and the Weaker is tempted to wish for an Opportunity to chuse a milder Lord or even to set up for an Independency which we must never think a Thing impossible because in the last Century our GreatGrandfathers saw Seven little Districts break loose from the other Ten the whole being but a small Part of a mighty Empire and set up for themselves with such swift Success as in the same Generation to beat their old Soveraign off the Ocean and in the present Century have not our Fathers seen the Revolt of  Portugal  from the same extended Empire tho  Portugal  is a Country  neither spacious populous nor warlike not defended from  Spain  by the Dangers of boisterous Seas nor by the Difficulties of  Alps  or  Appenines  The People of  Ireland  cannot be supposed ignorant of their own Story and indeed it is hard to find out what has made them Slaves or to be considered as a conquered People especially if it be true that at least Nine Tenths of the LandEstate in that Kingdom is at present in the conquerors Hands and that this present War will probably make the like Division of the other Tenth and this by the Aid and Arms of the  English  Protestants of  Ireland  Do  Englishmen  become Slaves by Conquering These are Restrained ProvincialPoliticks Let us shew that a limited Monarchy can increase and thrive as well as an absolute one Let us only rival Foreigners but let us not depress one Country Province or Member of our own Empire in Hopes to raise another I suppose if the CommonCouncil of  London  could make Laws for all  England  we should have all the Manufactures of all the different Cities and Counties restrained to the Freemen of  London  only and only to be carried on within the Sound of  Bowbell Norwich  or  Taunton  might probably take as great a Liking to the Woollen Manufacture and  Birmingham  to the Monopoly of HardWare What Pity it is that such hopeful Schemes are not carried into Execution How rich would they render the Nation How powerful the Prince in Proportion to the other Kings of  Europe  How securely we should engross our Manufactures without any Danger of being undersold by our Neighbours Tho' we have no Occasion to extend the Limits of the  British  Empire yet we should pursue such Maxims as will make it flourish for Nature has done her Part for us Our Situation tells us that we have no Business on the Continent that if  France  or  Spain  should make a Present to us of a Dozen strong Towns in  Flanders  they would not be worth the Keeping and we should only have Occasion to resolve into what Hands to put them The common Experience of every Trader will tell us that our Manufactures must be made cheap if we would sell cheap and that if our Neighbours can undersell us we may leave off Trade We ought always to remember that the Woollen Manufacture came from  Flanders  and the Silk from  France  to  England  and both by the Means of Oppression no Matter whether Religious or Political tho I think  Grotius  insists that the  Netherlands  fought for Liberty not for Religion it should  therefore be our Care that in guarding against a Rival in Trade we do not mistake our Mark and that when we suppress the  Irish  whose whole Profits center with us and add to our Power we do not advance the  French  and strengthen the Hands of our most dangerous our Hereditary Enemy It would indeed be a grateful Return for the Present which they have wisely made us within these last twenty Years of a large Numbers of their industrious Artizans but I believe the most scrupulous  English  Casuist will be content to remain in their Debt on this Account  I shall not at present undertake to shew the Probability that letting  Ireland  into a full Trade and into an Union too would inrich and aggrandize this Kingdom I fear you would believe I had taken too many Paradoxes on my Hands at once but if I find you can digest Part of the Doctrines already advanced I shall take another Opportunity to shew that the true Scheme of National Trade is to disperse the Multitude of WorkingHands thro the cheapest Provinces and that then you will have  Gold as Brass and Silver as Stones in the Streets  of your Metropolis I would attempt to prove that nothing but a flourishing Trade supported by wise Treaties brought  Jerusalem  to that happy Condition in the Days of  Solomon  He raised  great but not heavy Taxes for his Wisdom had brought such a Balance of Trade to his Kingdom that his People were well able to bear them they never murmured at them till they got a weak Man for their King who expected to reap what he had not sown and I do not read tho  Jerusalem  was the Seat of Empire and  Solomon  was of the Tribe of  Judah  that there was any Difference made to the Prejudice of the Commerce of the rest of the Tribes I could wish to give you a Sketch of the  British  Isles united in one Interest and one Parliament then might we hope for the Dominion of all the Isles of the Bay of  Mexico  and of the Ocean A Dominion more open for us to acquire and more easy to retain than any the most inconsiderable Part of the Continent of  Europe  There is one Thing to be lamented in our Management of Foreign Acquisitions We get an uselels Access of Land at a great Expence of our People We hardly ever make a new Subject we do not naturalize and conciliate the Minds of the Natives where we come And we have been in all Ages in the same Temper We were near five hundred Years reducing  Ireland  We sent Soldiers thither and gave them Land They did not indeed settle methodically in great Numbers and make populous Colonies  but they built Castles every where in the Country made Alliances with the Natives and degenerated by thousands so that the Task of reclaiming degenerate  English  was formerly more difficult than that of civilizing the Natives And the Losses which  England  sustained from Age to Age by this bad Policy have been so large and so frequent that perhaps it might be affirmed with Truth that more  Englishmen  have from Time to Time been sent into  Ireland  than the present Number of its Inhabitants amount to Had we sent regular Colonies thither and transplanted good Numbers of their Natives especially their Children into the several Counties of  England  we should soon have found it a profitable Undertaking This was the Method of  Assyria  and  Rome  too and now is only practiced by the  Turk  He takes from  Christians  great Numbers of Children and makes them the most bigotted  Musselmen  They recruit his Armies and indeed without this Policy it were impossible he should have  Mahometan  Subjects Such has been the Profusion of Blood in the  Turkish  Wars and so numerous are the  Christians  within those Dominions  I have sometimes thought it bad Oeconomy that our  EastIndia  and  African  Companies do not by Degrees buy up and educate some hundreds of the Children of the Natives where their Settlements are and breed them Christians and Soldiers from Father to Son It is a fond Partiality to fancy they would have less Faith or less Courage than those who are sent from hence I am persuaded they would have the Advantage in both Respects they might easily know more Religion and less Vice than the People who generally take those Journies would better endure the Climates and as for Courage and Military Skill these are chiefly to be acquired The Nations have had and lost them in their Turns The Proprietors in these Companies are more than Tenants for Life their Stock goes to their Executors and if the Companies Estate advances in Value so does every Share of each Proprietor This ought to encourage them to provide for the future Nor would it be found a grievous Burthen on the common Stock to execute such a Scheme Food being cheap and but little Rayment necessary in all the Settlements the Expence might be defrayed by the Labour of the Children except the prime Cost of purchasing them  The Earl of  Shaftesbury  is allowed to have been the great Wheel of Affairs and has certainly contributed to bring about this  Revolution as much as Queen  Maria D'Este  or King  William  the Third but whether in the Spirit of  Rome  or  Geneva  is a nice Question Perhaps he was in  utrumque paratus  and as cunning Gamesters practice when he found he had made his Bets on the wrong Side was wise enough to move off betimes He now affects to be thought innocent of all the Blunders and lawless Acts of Power in the last Reign to have advised against them but constantly to have been overruled by the  Italian  and Spiritual Counsels coinciding with his Master's Bigottry  Credat Judaeus Apella  Can he who bowed his Knee to  Baal  who gave up his Redeemer for Idolatry to please his Prince be supposed incapable of giving up his Country into the Bargain  He stands at present under the Proscription of both Monarchs but which is in  iest  which in  earnest  as NewsMongers say  we must leave to Time to discover  Our  Henry  the Seventh used to make a stalking Horse of Mother Church and excommunicated his best Friends at St  Paul  's  Cross  when by his Command they offered their Service to  Perkin Warbeck  on purpose to betray him It is possible that the Earl may have precipitated his Master's Measures with a Design to bring about the  Revolution it is possible he may have on the contrary endeavoured to prevent the dangerous Steps which have been taken but he can never be justifyed in either Light He ought to have withdrawn from the Scene of Iniquity and not to have acted one of the most considerable Parts in it When Lord Chancellor  Finch  was commanded to put the great Seal to my Lord  Danby  's Pardon he represented it as Illegal and surrendered the Seal This should be the Behaviour of all honest Men on the like Occasion Nor had his Master who was a Man of fine Understanding the worse Opinion of his Chancellor  Whatever Figure our Earl may happen to make hereafter we should remember that a good Judge of Life has made it a Precept of Wisdom to wonder at nothing  Nil admirari prope res est una  HOR  And indeed human Nature is so fickle Fortune so Sportive and the World has already seen so much Variety that if we are moderately read in History  There is nothing can happen to deserve our Admiration  The Military Gentlemen have been under a Parliamentary Inspection They have as was very natural to them brought  upon us some of the crying Evils which afflicted the worst Part of the Reign of King  Charles  the  st  and this in spite of the Bill of Rights  We provide and pay for them all but the Colonel robs the inferior Officer the inferior Officer robs the common Soldier and the common Soldier must of Course extort free Quarter upon the unarmed Countryman They subtract the Soldier's Pay and send him to demand SubsistenceMoney from his Landlord I suppose these People have got these pretty Notions in  Flander  by conversing with out  German  Allies this freeQuarter with a new Name the very Bane of the Empire and what must in Process of Time establish the Dominion of  France  over the greatest Part of  Germany  Those Princes look on free Quarters as a more compendious Method of maintaining an Army than regular Payments and instead of taking a Part of the Farmer's Wealth they suffer him to be robbed of All  The  French  and even the  Turks  tho' they waste an Enemy's Country with Fire and Sword yet govern their Subjects with a milder Sway Hence it is that the People who have first experienced the  German  and afterwards either of the other two Soveraigns seldom care to return to  their old Allegiance And yet the  Parliament  cannot see this Tyranny has surely a great Mixture of Folly or Madness in its Composition  There are some of our Colonels who rob an Officer under Colour of Cloathing him They oblige him to take his Cloaths from whom and at what Rate they please suppose at twenty Pounds what is worth twelve at most As if there was any Difference between robbing a Man and forcing him to buy at your own Price The Officer thus plundered naturally seeks to reimburse himself  Torva Leaena Lupum sequitur Lupus ipse Capellam  The King has broke one of the Colonels for it And if one single Reason did not interpose I could be content that a King of  England  were as Absolute as the Grand Signior over the Officers of his Army or Revenue I am not afraid that he would be at a Loss for want of Colonels or Commissioners Captains or Collectors They would only be more tender of transgressing with an Halter about their Necks than they are now when the greatest Punishment that can befal them is to be turned out of Employment A Punishment which some of them may find it worth their While to undergo  The Objection against such a Regulation is only this that Officers who were to live under such Absolute Power would be apt to obey without Reserve and that blind Obedience might become fatal to the Liberties of their Country Since then the Crown is not to be trusted with doing summary Justice I think it would be well if the Parliament took it into their own Hands and had a standing Committee for that Purpose in which no Officer should sit  It were to be wished that every FieldOfficer and Captain too had a better Revenue in Land than the annual Value of his Commission and even then I would exclude him from Parliament and Parliamentary Elections because he should not have it in his Power to burthen the Subjects to fill his own Pockets But we have many Soldiers of Fortune in great Posts who take large Strides to raise Families at once What Wonder then to see a Country pillaged by FreeQuarter A Regiment cheated of its Cloathing or fraudulent Bargains driven for Bread or Forage when the Profit of a single Contract may be greater than the Value of the Post that may be lost by it  The publick Business has been at a Stand while we have been opening a new Scene tracing the secret Methods which are  sometimes pursued in procuring Bills to pass in Parliament It seems the  East India  Company have been placing Sums in proper Hands The Speaker and Mr  Hungerford  are expelled the Speaker's Bribe was one thousand Pounds Mr  Hungerford  's but poor thirty Guineas Surely he thought he was taking a Fee in  WestminsterHall  it is unhappy for us that such Instances are found in our Senate  Venalis Populus Venalis Curia Patrum  was the State of  Rome  sinking into Slavery it is a Symptom of a distempered Constitution and threatens our Destruction if we do not aid ourselves with brisk Remedies It casts the severest Blemish on the Age we live in that even a reasonable Bill shall meet with Rubs and perhaps miscarry if it do not purchase its Passage  I believe it was never doubted but the Corruption of Bribery alone has always been sufficient to ruin any free People among whom it grew predominant unless you will chuse to say that it never came alone It is attended with false Friendship Breach of Faith Perjury neglect of the publick Interest insatiable Avarice publick Poverty private Wealth boundless Luxury endless Extortion Fraud in all Offices Rapine and Oppression in all the Provinces It is no Wonder in such a Situation  that the People should wish for a Change of any Sort for like a sick Person in grievous bodily Pain they flatter themselves that any Alteration must happen for the better  And yet to get rid of this Army of Monsters I never can think it necessary to have Recourse to  Lycurgus  's Scheme to banish Gold and Silver and leave no better Money than Iron This Expedient might suit a Tract of Land about the Size of one of our Counties inhabited by ten or twenty thousand Families who lived upon their Labour and the Fruits of their own Soil but the World is not thus divided at this Day We could not set forth a  British  Fleet on such a Fund to keep what we have got abroad or even to maintain us in Possession of our Home  We need only go to  Holland  to observe that a People may love Money very well without having an Opportunity to sell Justice or their Country There will always be found a sufficient Number of honest Men to serve the State if you reduce the Value of the great Employments Ninety  per Cent  from Thousands to Hundreds  per Ann  A good Man will only desire to be indemnified as to the Expences of his Attendance Moderate Expences I mean Thus may the most considerable  Offices be filled with the worthiest Patriots unrivalled by the Mercenaries But instead of reducing great Employments to the Value of a competent Subsistence for the Possessors we can shew a single Post which half a Dozen People may enjoy at once and every one of them make a Fortune by it  The exorbitant Grants which have been made to some Favourites have justly roused the Spirit of the Commons of  England  The Earl of  Portland  particularly has so far exceeded all Bounds of Modesty that he has got little less than the Principality of  Wales  and the Lands and Lordships that should support the HeirApparent of  England  are given to this Lord The House has this Day unanimously addressed against this Grant and had a gracious Answer that it should be resumed They came into this Temper chiefly in Consequence of an incomparable Speech which Mr  Price  the Lawyer made on the Occasion It has that Eloquence and strong reasoning in it which are worthy the Character of a Man of Learning and Understanding and that bold Freedom which becomes an  English Patriot  in his Place in Parliament When great Men obtain Grants like these it is well they do not ask the Kingdom also I send  you an Extract of Mr  Price  's Speech  viz  This Petition  says he  tho' subscribed only by a few Hands has the Approbation of many Thousands who are not influenced by their own Interest but act for the Honour of the Crown and Welfare of the  British  Nation  If I could conceive how the Glory and Grandeur of  England  is or can be upheld by a poor landless Crown and a miserable necessitous People I might then be easily persuaded to believe that his Majesty is well advised to grant away all the Revenues of the Crown and that his Government will thereby be well secured and his People best protected when they have little or nothing left but I am sure they are not  English  but foreign Politicians who can revere the King and yet hate his People The Kings of  England  always reign best when they have the Affections of their Subjects of which they are secure when the People are sensible the King is entirely in their Interest and loves the  English  Soil as well as the People's Money  I must needs confess that my Thoughts are troubled with strange Apprehensions of our deplorable State We are in a Confederacy in War and some of those Confederates  our Enemies in Trade tho' planted amongst us some in the King's Council some in the Army and the Common Traders have possessed themselves of the Outskirts of this great City We find some of them Naturalized and others made Denizens In every Parliament we find Endeavours for a general Naturalization and that warmly sollicited from Court  We see our good Coin all gone and our Confederates openly coining  Dutch  Money of a base Alloy for us We see most Places of Power and Profit given to Foreigners We see our Confederates in Conjunction with the  Scots  to ruin our  English  Trade We see the Revenues of the Crown daily given away to one or other who make Sale of them and transmit their Estates elsewhere We do not find any of them buy Lands or Estates amongst us but what they can get from us they secure in their own Country How can we hope for happy Days in  England  when This great Lord and the Other Foreigners tho' Naturalized are in the  English  and also in the  Dutch  Councils If these Strangers tho' now Confederates should be of different Interests as most plainly they are in Point of Trade to which Interest is it to be supposed those great Foreign Counsellors and Favourites  would adhere So that I foresee that when we are reduced to extreme Poverty as now we are very near it we are to be supplanted by our Neighbours and become a Colony to the  Dutch  I shall make no severe Remarks on this great Man for his Greatness makes us Little and will make the Crown both poor and precarious and when GOD shall please to send us a Prince of  Wales  he may have such a Present of a Crown made him as a Pope did to King  John  who was Surnamed  SansTerre  and was by his Father King  Henry  the second made Lord of  Ireland  Which Grant was confirmed by the Pope who sent him a Crown of Peacock's Feathers in Derision of his Power and the Poverty of his Revenue  I would have us to consider that we are  Englishmen  and must like good Patriots stand by our Country and not suffer it to become tributary to Strangers We have rejoiced that we have beat out of this Kingdom Popery and Slavery and do now with as great Joy entertain Socinianism and Poverty and yet we see our Properties daily given away and our Liberties must soon follow  I desire Redress rather than Punishment therefore I shall neither move for an Impeachment against this noble Lord nor for  the Banishment of Him but shall only beg that he may have no Power over us nor we any Dependance upon Him  Then he concluded with a Motion for the Address  March    I remember it was always your Opinion and mine that Liberty might be in Danger as much under a  Protestant  Prince as under a  Papist  It seems the collective Wisdom of the Nation is of the same Judgment for they have resolved to send the Red Coats to learn the Arts of Peace in all the Counties and Boroughs of the Kingdom They make them in Effect free of all Corporations and have resolved that seven thousand Men here and twelve thousand in  Ireland  are a sufficient Land Force The Courtiers had a large Field to expatiate in concerning the embroiled Condition of  Europe  abroad notwithstanding the new Peace and the dangerous extensive Disaffection at Home But the Genius of  England  has prevailed We are not now to be Slaves His Majesty under whose Auspices we have learned to mortgage the Kingdom is graciously pleased to suffer us to see a Possibility of redeeming it The  Dutch  Guards stuck much with Him but they must also be gone He is too wise a Prince not to know that the Casuistry upon the Titles of contending Pretenders to the  Crown is but a Trifle in the Consideration of the Multitude it surmounts their Theory The true Ground and Reason of Loyalty or Disaffection in the Populace is nothing else but the Sense of their own present Happiness or Misery and let who will reign he can never have the Affections of a People whom he burthens with Taxes to pay for the Insurance of their own Slavery A Prince perhaps may have his Option whether he will govern a People by Force or found his Authority upon their Affections He has no Need of and I am much mistaken if he can have Both  The Courtiers have been very loud upon the Topick of our Obligation to the King for the Benefits we have received from him and in particular for this last Act of Condescention For my Part it gives me the Spleen to hear such Stuff Surely these Men would make us believe that we were born the Slaves of some Eastern Monarch that we enjoy our Liberties by a Gift revocable at Pleasure and that they are not our Birthright and Inheritance Men who advance Notions of this Tendency deserve the Gibbet equally with  Garnet  the Jesuit and  Oliver Cromwell  as being equally Traitors to their Country  The King indeed ran the Risque of conducting our Efforts for Liberty and Religion  we have succeeded we have paid the Expence of the Undertaking and raised him to the Throne for his Pains What is more to be done I hope I am a very good Protestant but I am sure I never did design to truck away all other Rights of an  Englishman  for a Deliverance only from King  James  's Ecclesiastical Tyranny Were our other Rights extinguished our Religion would be also precarious  Orthodox  with  Constantine  and  Arian  with  Constantius  Such a Deliverance would be Protestantism with a Witness It would bring us under a very lively Description of biggotted Madness which I shall not attempt to translate but here transcribe to save you the Trouble of turning to it  Jupiter ingentes qui das adimisque Dolores  Mater ait Pueri menses jam quinque cubantis  Frigida si Puerum Quartana reliquerit illo  Manè Die quo tu indicis jejunia nudus  In Tiberi stabit Casus Medicusve levârit  Aegrum in praecipiti mater delira necabit  In gelidâ fixum Ripâ febrimque reducet  Quonam Malo mentem concussa Timore Deorum  We are at last come to the several Resolutions which I send you inclosed about setling the Succession to the Crown a Point of the utmost importance to these Kingdoms and of no small Moment even to the most  considerable Powers in  Europe France Spain  the  Empire  and  Holland  are most particularly attentive to this critical Step for I believe it is by this Time well understood that the two late Kings were duped into the Measures of  France  and had no Concern to preserve the Balance of Power in  Europe  The Duchess of  Savoy  is as importunate to have her Birthright considered at this Juncture as the Duke's Minister was fulsome in his Compliment upon the Revolution yet surely they must have then foreseen their Pretensions would be prejudiced by that grand Event We have thrown the Popish Pedigrees out of the Question You see we do not meddle with the Prince's Birth if it could be proved supposititious that would not remove our Difficulties We insist on the Security of our Religion as well as our Laws we have seen how weak the Bonds of Duty of Promises and of Oaths are upon a Popish Prince and therefore we cannot scruple to exclude a Multitude of the Descendants of King  Charles  the st in Favour of his Sister's Children It is indeed a Wonder that this Work was not begun and persected many Years ago for the Occasion was little less than at present except the Chance of the Duke of  Gloucester  's Life  I fear you will observe some CobwebNets or Ropes of Sand in our Restrictions upon the Successors We say he shall not go out of the Kingdom without Consent of Parliament If he should not meet with Parliaments kind enough to consent  Gratis  and his Inclinations be very strong for a Tour abroad he may learn to buy Leave perhaps once for all by getting the Clause repealed And which is worse Corruptions of all kinds are in their Effects very like Fornication it frequently happens that Women  sin  the first Time without a Design to make a Practice of it their Desires draw them in only as they imagine to gratify themselves  pro illâ vice  but the like Appetite recurs on fresh Occasions frequent Acts grow into a Habit and the same Person who felt a quick Compunction for the first Fault now thinks it a Fault no longer and is insensible of Remorse and Shame And indeed I think that Restriction a very idle one Is it to be feared that the Elector of  Hanover  to put the Case stronger than that of the Dowager Duchess could attempt to make his Electorate the Seat of the  British  Empire could he think himself safe in the Possession of the Crown if he were to fall upon so ridiculous a Project A Prince of CommonSense has no Occasion for this Restriction and if  we had a Fool so absurd it were no Matter what became of him A brave a wise a good King may have Occasions to go abroad highly beneficial in their Consequences to this Kingdom and I think we may believe without taking any Security for it that  England  will continue the Seat of Empire till it falls under the Sway of a Soveraign who has another Dominion at least equal to it  But that Article which seems of most Importance in Favour of  England  and which would be truly valuable if it were possible duly to fulfil and obseve it will be found either  unjust  or  impossible  in the Execution It is that which providesWe shall not involve ourselves in the Quarrels or Defence of the Dominions on the Continent which may belong to the Successor With all due Loyalty to his Majesty and Deference to the Princess  Anne  and her Hopes of Issue let us suppose an Elector of  Hanover  on the Throne of  GreatBritain  and that he may have Occasion to quarrel for the Rights of these Kingdoms with any of his great Neighbours on the Continent as suppose the  Swede  the  Dane  the  Pole  the  Prussian  the  Saxon  or the  Austrian  Will they take a Bull by the Horns Will they attack him where he is strongest and chuse to fit out Fleets  to dispute it with  England  on the Seas where they are certain to be worsted Will they not rather with Fifty thousand Men come against his Ten thousand and overwhelm  Brunswick  as a Reprizal on the King of  GreatBritain  If this should at any Time be the Case would it be generous would it be just and honest to suffer it Would not our Coolness on such an Occasion tempt or provoke even a righteous Prince to make Treaties not quite so much to our Advantage as they ought to be for Fear of causing his innocent Dominion on the Continent to bear our Iniquities to be the ScapeGoat of his IslandEmpire  I believe nobody can doubt that the fine Webs of Politicks may be so intricately woven and the Affairs of  Europe  so much embarassed that private Gentlemen will prove but very indifferent Judges to determine this Question  viz  Whether it be only KnightErrantry or Necessary Justice in this Kingdom at such or such a Time to be at the Expence of protecting the Electorate or to know what is the true Foundation of the Present Quarrel  We should remember that notwithstanding all our Precautions on this Head the Power of making War and Peace will still reside in the Crown It is true the Right  of giving Money is in the Commons and they may refuse to provide for the Wantouness of Ambition I shall not presume to call the Separation of these Powers  of raising Armies  and  of raising Money  a Solecism in our Constitution nor say where I would have them reside if to be reposed in one Constituentpart of the Legislature but thus much I may observe because  Charles  II tho' an indolent Prince gave us a flagrant Proof of it in the  Dutch  Fleet at  Chatham  that if our King makes War without Money not he but we are to be the Sufferers and shall then find this Truth  delirant Reges plectuntur Achivi  I must make one further Observation of an Hardship the Electorate might endure for the Sake of  GreatBritain  Contrary to the Decisions of all the Schoolmen and Casuists it is settled as a Principle in the Law of Nations by the Practice of modern Politicians and their Masters that if your Neighbour is too powerful it is a just Cause of making War upon him Now perhaps there is hardly at this Day a little Prince in all  Germany  who would not exert himself in Defence of the Electorate as it stands alone But for the Reason given the Question would be widely different if the same Territory were only a small Part of the Dominions of an  English  King they  would then perhaps consider the Balance of Power in a new Light and the more jealous our Neighbours were grown of the Conjunction the more should we be concerned in Honour and common Sense to defend so near an Ally and to supply the Want of all other Confederates  I would not be understood on the whole to say that  England  would be the happier for such an Access of Dominion on the Continent under the same Prince I think quite otherwise and heartily wish that we would in Time attempt the only Means to obviate all Difficulties We might try to get it established by a Law in the Empire and certainly make it Part of the Act of Succession here that this Crown devolving on the Duke of  Brunswick  his Duchy and Electorate should  co instante  divest out of him in Favour of some Protestant of his Family I am not at all apprehensive of his rejecting the Crown on these Terms but if they be not previously made a Condition of the Succession it will be idle and unreasonable to expect a Compliment of that Importance afterwards Now is our Time while we have in our own Hands a Value abundantly more than equivalent to give for it It will be too late to make Bargains after we have made a Present of that Equivalent  But perhaps the Mistakes of this Age may be cured by Design or Chance in some future Generation A Prince may leave only Female Issue to inherit the Throne and then the  German  Dominion would go to collateral Males or it may be conquered And in the then subsequent Generation this Kingdom will regret the Loss of it as little as we now do that of  Bohemia  an hundred Years ago and of better Countries on the Continent which formerly paid Obedience to our Kings and which were but ill defended at the severe Expence of Deluges of  English  Blood and Treasure  These remote Speculations will probably be Realities with our GrandChildren they will be in earnest about them and to their Care I leave them For perhaps it is a general Happiness that many of us cannot have our Turns in the Disposal of the World Tho' I might mean very well and might fancy myself a Judge of Affairs yet to the Cost of my FellowCreatures I might in the Event be found as miserable a Bungler as or the Farmer in the Fable who obtained of  Jupiter  Leave to regulate the Weather within his own Grounds but had not Knowledge enough of the secret Springs of Action in the vegetable World to balance the Powers committed to his Care Heat and Cold Moist and Dry were too  many for him The politick World like the natural is composed of  Discordia semina rerum  and it requires great Penetration successfully to observe their Operations  LETTER IX  LAST  Sunday  the great Soul of our Soveraign quitted its decayed Tenement Had it been lodged in a Mansion firm as itself the World would have quickly seen new Instances of its Vigour He continued his usual Hunting till within four or five Days before his Death His Enemies give out that he died of an Hurt received by a Fall from his Horse the Horse is of a  Sorrel  Colour and the  Jacobites  drink his Health devoutly under that Denomination  The following Satire is handed about  Illustrious  Steed  who should the  Zodiac  grace  To thee the  Lyon  and the  Bull  give Place  Blest be the Dam that fed Thee blest the Earth  Which first receiv'd Thee and first gave the Birth  Did wrong'd  Hibernia  to revenge her Slain  Produce Thee or unhappy  Fenwick  's Strain  Or  Glencoe  's barbarously butcher'd Clax  Where'er Thou art be Thou for ever blest  And spend the Remnant of thy Days in Rest  No servile use thy noble Limbs profane  No Weight thy Back no Curb thy Mouth restrain  No more be Thou no more Mankind a Slave  But Both enjoy  that  Liberty you gave  It is true the King had a Fall and broke his Collar Bone But this was not the Cause of his Death His Exit about this time was unavoidable had he not fallen at all his Lungs were emaciated and inflamed and nothing but  Medea  's Kettle could have been of Service to him  He has left us under the Conduct of a Woman at the Beginning of a War probably the most raging and extensive that  Europe  has felt within these hundred Years And under the Protection of a Woman about a Century ago we happily sustained the most dangerous Shock that has been attempted to our Prejudice within these six hundred Years  I wish the  Dutch  and  Germans  would make good their Frontiers with the Assistance of the other Allies on the Continent and that we might furnish our whole Quota in Value upon the Seas where our most natural Strength lies and where we shall I doubt not be more than an Overmatch for  France  if our Friends behave as they ought to do upon  Terra Firma  These would in Consequence leave us in full Possession of the Maritime Empire for we being at the Pains of destroying the  French  Naval Force would at the same time have the Satisfaction to see the  Dutch  Ships of War neglected and go to Ruin  But it is too probable we shall partake in the Glory or Shame of what is to be executed by Land the Military Men and the young Nobility and Gentry who desire to be so will all make their strongest Interest to have a great Army and to carry on this War upon the Plan of the last and if we prove victorious we I mean the Nation in general shall get Glory and Poverty by it while a few great Officers and Persons concerned in Cloathing  c  make their Fortunes  There is no need of the Spirit of Prophecy to foretel that the Nation must in this Case be beggared in Favour of  Holland  and of those very Parts of  Flanders France  or  Germany  which may become the Seat of War This was our Case in the last  Irish  War which however was unavoidable We poured in more Money upon them than ever that Nation saw before which is now coming back by the Sale of the Forfeitures It was not indeed of very long Continuance therefore we did not greatly feel it till we added a  Flemish  Account to it and then with the Assistance also of  Dutch  Clippers of our Coin we found ourselves almost in a Condition to shut up Shop The  King  has left a motley Ministry a Change is expected  in Favour of the  Tories  But you shall never find any in the Sincerity with which  I am c  London  March th  LETTER X  Feb  I AM persuaded you have great Satisfaction in the News of the  Queen  's Gift of the First Fruits and Tenths to the poor Clergy as it is a strong Proof of her Zeal for our Established Religion The  Roman  Emperors who persecuted Christianity before the Days of  Julian  the Apostate  occiderunt Presbyteros  but he in Appearance more moderate tho' in Truth wilier and more malicious than his Predecessors  occidit Presbyterium  He spoiled the Churchmen of their Means of Living and by this Method had well nigh destroyed the Priesthood Starving is doubtless as effectual a Form for Death to assume as any other and perhaps one of the most terrible Forms it can assume  The  Queen  's Piety on this Occasion is the Contrast of  Julian  's Malice there is nothing wanting to compleat the Merit of the  Design but to substitute the Word Restitution instead of Bounty or Donation However it must be acknowledged that there was much to be said to justify the Right of the Crown to this Branch of ChurchRevenues which King  Henry  VIII laid his Hands on for this Revenue had been for Ages enjoyed by the  Pope  as Head of the Church therefore thevesting it in the Crown was but a natural Consequence of our throwing off the usurped Supremacy of  Rome  What farther enhances the Merit of this Gift is the present Exigency of Publick Affairs It is done at a Juncture when the Crown is not in a giving Condition It is to be hoped that late Posterity who shall enjoy the Benefit of it will revere the Memory of the pious Donor and that our succeeding Monarchs may be excited by this laudable Example to raise up the drooping Head of the  English  Church plundered and covered with Rags by an unbelieving Prince and his sacrilegious Creatures under the Veil of Reformation A Prince more dangerous to the Christian Religion than  Julian  or  Attila  because  he communed with it in the House of God as a Friend  His Title of Defender of the Faith gave him an Opportunity to destroy his Charge that Church  which is always in the Condition of a Minor  I am here induced to lament the Avarice of Ecclesiasticks who when they had an ample Dominion over the Minds of Men grasped at too great a Share of the good Things of this World they were not content with a competent Income they thought their Power their Revenues their Number could never be sufficiently augmented These Maxims joined to their Vows of Celibacy which took in both Sexes and their Care to conceal their Shame when they broke these Vows rendered them Enemies to Society to Human Nature And as Reformations are too apt to run into an Extream opposite to the Evil designed to be remedied the Church of  England  has dearly paid for the Avarice of that of  Rome  Men knowing that the Church had obtained too much easily took up a Notion that they could not leave her too little They knew that the Monks in dark Ages had importuned from the Fears of intimidated dying Sinners unreasonable Grants of great Estates and along with these the Reforming Generation made no Scruple to rob the Church of its Natural Inheritance which it had enjoyed from the Piety of purest Times in Imitation of a Pattern given by God himself  when he condescended to compile a Body of Laws both Civil and Ecclesiastical for the Government of his chosen People  The Land which had been given by superstitious Penitents to found or endow the Nurseries of Religious Idleness were perhaps very properly resumed in Favour of the Crown rather than of the Heirs of the Donors for had they been restored to the latter it would have produced such infinite Confusion among the Claimants as probably would have redounded less to their Benefit and the Nation's than the Method which was taken But does it also follow that there could be a Difficulty to ascertain the right Owners of the Parochial Tithes which were found in the Hands of the Monasteries It was easy to know that the Monasteries had taken them from the ParishPriests and by worse Means if possible than their Influence over the staggering Resolutions of dying Men They robbed the secular Clergy with a strong Hand by the Aid of the usurped arbitrary Power of the See of  Rome  which was wrought upon by Money to interpose in Favour of the Regulars not without an Eye to some political Maxims little less than Treasonable for the Allegiance of the Subject was divided by that Solecism in Politicks  imperium in  imperio  and frequent Experience told us that the Regulars knew no Soveraign but the  Pope  These Sufferings of the Parochial Clergy were not a Reason at the Reformation why they should not be restored to their own  Indeed if it shall happen that the Christian Temper of Posterity one way or other shall bring back the Tithes or an Equivalent for them to the Church I should never wish that it might be endowed with great Estates in Lands into the Bargain My only Desire is that Religion may not suffer by making the Clergy contemptible who will always be held in Contempt if they are obliged to live in Poverty  In the mean while there might be some other Expedients found out that would contribute to place them in a comfortable Condition to attend their great Charge the Care of Souls There are too many Parishes in  England  both in City and Country It is true there are some Parishes too large which ought to be divided but there are a great many more too small which would be better united Two or three insufficient Provisions for so many Pastors of little and ill attended Flocks may amount to a competent Maintainance for one able Minister who may  do his Duty with Satisfaction to a decent Congregation  Perhaps also it is not now necessary that the Revenues of Colleges should be as ample as formerly for the Education of Youth when the Nation is overstocked with Learning already and there are not Benefices sufficient to receive the Men who have gone thro' the Course of their Academical Studies I could therefore rejoice that we had fewer People educated on Charity to fill the Church not at all dreading the Want of a Supply from those of better Fortunes if we could contrive to advance the Benefices to a reasonable Value which would be much furthered by taking away some Superfluities of Schools and Colleges and bestowing them in the Endowment of the Church where they are most wanted I am far from thinking it for the Benefit of Religion or of the Nation to diminish the Number of Professors or Fellows in either University It will always be necessary to the Permanency of sound Learning that there should be a considerable Number of Men of good Parts and Education maintained at full Leisure to attend their Studies in every Branch of Literature But will this also prove that there is a National Advantage in bringing forward yearly at the publick  Expence an hundred Persons to the Degree of Batchelor of Arts who know not afterwards which Way to turn themselves and have Reason to wish that instead of reading  Ramus  and  Aristotle  they had been taught to throw the Shuttle or hold the Plough of their ForeFathers  A poor Man may be as honest as a rich one but it is not generally so easy to tempt the latter into mean and scandalous Actions The Necessities of some of the lowest of the Clergy are apt to lead them into Mistakes that cause a Clamour against the very Priesthood and do a real Disservice to Religion And yet these meanest of the People  who seek the Priest's Office that they may eat a Piece of Bread  are immediately ready to fancy themselves Gentlemen and that their Families are also advanced in Blood and Degree Hence it happens in their Oeconomy that during the Father's Lifetime the Son is bred at a Freeschool undoubtedly designed to be a Bishop at least the Father drops off and then the poor Youth is glad to find Employment as a Drawer in a Tavern or perhaps to wear a Livery and it is well if no worse happens As for the Daughter she learns to dance and play on Musical Instruments and because she is a Gentlewoman she scorns to do the Offices of a  Country Housewife at home or to go to Market along with the Wives and Daughters of the Neighbouring Farmers Her Education is like that which the unhappy Gentry of  Georgia  are said to give their Daughters to fit them for the Seraglios of the  Turkish  and  Persian  Grandees and the Event is often worse if possible The best Prospect after such an Education is an honest Servitude  Which of the Bishops if he has not made himself remarkable for Moroseness is not daily pestered with Ecclesiastical Beggars the pretended or real Widows and Orphans of indigent Clergymen besides Crouds of indigent Clergymen themselves I do not observe these Facts as believing it improper for Clergymen to marry but being of Opinion that those of them who marry and cannot save any thing for their Families should at least teach them to endure and work thro' that low State of Life they are born to And I also consider it as a Reason for augmenting the Value tho' we should considerably diminish the Number of Benefices in  England  I rejoice as an  Englishman  that our Clergy are rather ten thousand than an hundred thousand There are the fewer idle Hands in the Nation compared with its  Popish  Neighbours therefore our Wealth is the greater  I rejoice also that these ten thousand are not restrained from Marriage For this single Advantage will in a few Generations spread the  Protestant  Religion over  Europe  by our gradual Increase of People and the Decrease of the  Papists  unless the Almighty for his own secret Purposes shall send some more Kings to reign in  Protestant  Kingdoms like the present King of  Sweden  Were it not that  Cromwell  in too great Haste to settle that miserable Kingdom of  Ireland  gave vast Multitudes of the Natives to the  Spaniard  and that the late Revolution and some Laws which followed it relating to Religion and others concerning Trade have sent great Numbers of the same People to  France  all which have been replaced by the Natives of  Great Britain  besides our large Export to our  American  Colonies  France  and  Spain  before this must have felt more sensibly how burthensome their Religion is to the State And these our  British  Islands would have grown up by this Time as populous as the  United Netherlands  It cannot be pretended that the taking away the Funds from the Scholarships and Exhibitions in the FreeSchools and the Universities to apply them to the Augmentation  of poor Livings can work an Injury to any one it is true that whoever is in Possession of an Income of that Nature ought to enjoy his legal Estate in it but on the Vacancy no Individual having a Right the Publick may well and justly apply it to the most laudable Purpose and I believe it is hardly a Question in our Age and Country which is the more eligible Species of Charity the Education of poor Scholars or Maintainance of poor Ecclesiasticks with Cure of Souls To this I may add that many of the Estates which are in that unnecessary Method of Charity were for a like Reason taken from another useless People and given to the present Possessors whose Number is now become a Nuisance to the Nation  I would also propose that my Lords the Bishops would contribute to the Dignity and Sanctity of the Priesthood by approaching nearer to an Equality of Revenue among themselves with such Moderation that on the one Hand each might have sufficient to enable him with Decency to attend his Service in Parliament and on the other that their Behaviour there might not be so frequently suspected by the Laity as it has formerly been as if they were too ready to obey the Nod of a Minister of State and to hope to deserve  a sudden Promotion to a tenfold Revenue to take a speedy Flight from the Dreary Mountains of  Snowdon  to the warm old snug Palace of  Lambeth  What think you Sir would not Two thousand Pounds a Year be a decent Income for a Bishop some of them might have something more allotted to them as my Lord of  London  and others who have most Occasion to reside often in Town or in other expensive Parts of the Kingdom and would not Three thousand Pounds each be a tolerable Income for our two Metropolitans The rest of the Episcopal Revenues might be applied to the Support of their inferior Bretheren And without a Bill to prevent Translations a Bill which honest Men have sometimes been tempted to wish for we might live to see a certain Bench filled with Patriots and this without enduring that absurd Inconvenience which an Act against Translations would introduce For under such a Law if the Prince should have it in his View to advance to the Summit of Church Preferment the most deserving Priest in  England  when the worst Diocese becomes vacant he must not promote him because under such a Law it would put a Negative upon his farther Advancement so that a Man of the most cnosummate Merit might after many Years  Expectation die a private and poor Parson because he was designed to be Archbishop of  Canterbury  But this long Letter will pass with you for one of my Resveries especially my last Scheme For nothing like it can ever be executed unless the Temporal Lords should in some future Age happen to think as I do and attend in Parliament with Diligence to accomplish an Alteration  LETTER XI  July th  SIR  THE Union is at length as good as concluded it was hard or rather impossible to settle the Terms of it to every body's liking but the grand Design was always desirable to the Unprejudiced of both Nations and our late Blunders have made it more necessary to us than ever it was  Edinburgh  will doubtless suffer by the Loss of the Parliament there and of the Resort of their Nobility but in the main the Kingdom must grow richer upon being let into the  English  Trade instead of their late wretched Condition without any valuable Branch of Commerce or any rational  Prospect of obtaining one They are now to be Members of a flourishing Empire an Empire safer and happier  sua si bona nôrit  than the greatest on the Continent because in its Natural its Naval Strength it is much more powerful than any of its Neighbours  Scotland  used to be the Pensioner of  France  used to ravage two or three of our Northern Counties to burn our Houses and run away with our Cattle and often felt the Severity of our Reprizals But in one Generation that Border will grow enamoured with the Arts of Peace and such of their great Men as love Pensions may haply enjoy them with less Hazard than of old without the Danger of seeing their Country destroyed by Fire and Sword as a Reward for their mercenary Politicks As for our Parts it is no Trifle to remove for ever the Probability of being attacked in the Rear by Enemies far from being despicable in Point of Bravery and not to be despised because of their Poverty for their Poverty contributed to create our Danger That Poverty and that Bravery will for the future exalt our Hopes instead of creating our Fears Our People on this Side  Tweed  may well be spared to ply the Loom and Hammer while the Heroes of  Cathness  and  Sutherland    Disdaining servile Labours bear the Musket  The glorious Musket and enjoy their Leisure  Nor unrewarded bear it but the meed  Of six good Pence  per Diem  Wealth not known  To their great Ancestors they glad receive  And hail Flock Beds Wheat Bread and  Cheshire  Cheese  And bless that League which show'rs these Blessings down  We have some very worthy Men among us who are much disgusted at the Care that is taken of the Kirk the Preservation of which is a sundamental Article They alledge that  Episcopacy  was unfairly outed and that the Majority of the Nobility and Gentry of that Kingdom would if they could restore it at this Day But the Preservation of the Kirk is at present a Condition without which no Union can be had the Populace will not yet part with the  Mess Johns  That must be expected in a cooler Season and then the fundamental Article will be a Cobweb It is absurd to attempt to make irrevocable Laws for Posterity every Generation must of Necessity have a Right to chuse for itself This ridiculous Notion of immutable Laws was however a Maxim in Law among the  Medes  and  Persians  Observe the Consequence Their Emperor Today promulges an IMMUTABLE Edict to destroy all the  Jews  and on the Morrow sends forth another that they may take Arms for their Defence and that all his  loving Subjects shall assist them Can any common Lawyer or Civilian deny that there will be in the united Legislature of  GreatBritain  an unlimited Power over the whole Body and every Part of it or that they will have sufficient Authority to repeal any Law which either of the divided Kingdoms made What the  Sultan  is in  Turky  and the  Mogul  in  India  the Parliament of  GreatBritain  must necessarily be in the Plenitude of its Power  Another Complaint among us is that the Members which  Scotland  furnishes to both Houses amount to a tenth or a twelfth of the Parliament tho' they are not to pay above a thirtieth of the Taxes of the united Kingdom I do not fear being suspected as a Partizan for the  Scots  when I declare that I believe this to be still very equal for tho' we leave them an open Trade yet the Profits of that will be swallowed in the Rents of all their best Estates and must center in  London  and  Middlesex  It will be well enough if the publick Money raised among them suffices to answer all the publick Demands there Their great Men will live here and in a Generation or two will become mere  Englishmen  There is one Omission in the Articles of this Union with regard to the Perpetuity  of the  Scots  Peerage There are no new Peers to be made there and they are always to send sixteen to Parliament by Election I believe their Number is pretty large at present suppose one hundred and fifty but these will gradually decrease and be extinguished by one Accident or other for there are no perpetual Successions no Bishops among them I lately observed this to a very intelligent Gentleman of that Nation He looked on it as a remote Evil  For  says he  most of the Peerages there are inheritable by the Daughters when Sons fail  I allowed this for a Reason why Peerages should not easily be extinguished but I am convinced that thus they will more readily decrease by Unity of Possession occasioned by Marriages both among their own Nobility and ours which will have a quicker Effect than the Extinction of the MaleLines by the Course of Nature separate Maintenance and Venery Almost as often as a  Scots  Coronet devolves upon a Female it will consolidate that Peerage with some other so that in Effect there is a  Scots  Peerage merged for ever  There is another Way left open to diminish their Number for tho' a  Scots  Peer must not be made an  English  one yet his Son or Brother may and thus  upon the Fall of one Life there will be one Peer less on their List So it is likely they will hardly have sixteen Lords left in an hundred Years I have not been informed whether this Omission was by Mistake but it is really of little or no Consequence Since  Scots  are capable of being made Peers of  GreatBritain  it matters not from what Castles Towns or Villages they take their Titles nor whether North or South of  Tweed  It will only sound a little absurd to Posterity that the same Person who may be called to Parliament as Lord of  Hammersmith  shall be refused Admittance as Duke of  Edinburgh  For the rest the Locality of Titles happens not to be material for if this Kingdom preserves its Constitution Posterity shall always find most of its largest Fortunes and greatest Men in the House of Peers of  GreatBritain  But if for Our Sins or Theirs our Posterity shall bow the Knee before a Tyrant after the Manner of the Nations round about us and the Houses of Parliament in a Venal Generation concur to murder the Constitution it is a Matter of no Sort of Importance who shall be the Parricides  We might be content that the Numbers both of their Lords and Commons to sit in the UnitedParliament were to be double or  treble those agreed on Thus we should have more of their Wealth drawn hither and our Constitution would be safer from the Attempts of the Crown as it would be harder to manage or gratify so great a Number This is what we ought to attend to on all Occasions I design to make my Grandsons learn it along with their Prayers and their Creed That the  Liberties of England can only be destroyed by a Standing Army of her own Sons and that Parliamentary Bribery is the most proper Method to obtain such an Army  And yet it is strange that Men can sell themselves and Posterities for an Estate at Will You shall find in some foreign Countries a Man of Two Thousand Pounds a Year of Inhertance who for so small a Bribe as an Office or Pension of Five Hundred Pounds a Year during Pleasure shall give his Vote for a Law which in its Consequence renders his Inheritance as precarious as the Pension Is this being wise in our Generation is this to be justified even by the Wisdom of the Children of this World  What Age what Kingdom can shew an immediate Sucession of three good absolute Monarchs or in what Country have Liberty Corruption and a Standing Army gone Hand in Hand for forty Years together It is an idle Imagination to suppose that when a King designs to rule by his Will he must  do as the  Danes  did discard his States and rely upon his Troops That is indeed the shortest Way but not the safest When  Augustus  had established himself against all Opposers he did not covet a great Army he chose to keep a packed Senate in Pay he gulled the People with an Appearance of Liberty and the Administration of his Government was gentle But  Rome  was ruined it lost its Liberty and was as effectually enslaved under him as under  Nero  or  Domitian  Mollia vincla pati jussit at vincula passa est  Purpureum cultu insolito venerata Tyrannum  Thus while with Clemency  Augustus  reign'd  The Monarch was ador'd the city chain'd  But tho' this be the safest Method for a Prince to take who desires to be absolute yet it is the most burthensome to the People Their PensionSenate is a more extravagant Charge upon them than a great Army would be If I were to live in an Age and Country where the Representatives of the People had sold them to the Prince for Places and Pensions and given him a Military Force to ensure the Purchase I would concur in and promote a Petition that the Prince might assume the Legislative Authority exclusive of such prostitute Representatives and I think it is evident that in such  a Case whether a Prince were good or bad a Wise Man or a Fool the People could more easily pay for the Wants or the Wantonness of the Monarch alone than for those and the Wages of several hundreds of Parricides into the Bargain  Nor is a People the safer from such Attempts for having a Ruler of their own chusing The ambitious Man when he has climbed all the Rounds of the Ladder of Authority turns his Back to it and scorns the base Degrees by which he rose In all mixed Governments each constituent Part must be eternally on its Guard The Prince can easily take Care of his Prerogative because being but one he can always be true to and consistent with himself His Individuality gives him those Advantages and the  Praeexistent  Temptation of Ambition that Spur to make use of them that he ought never to be trusted with more than his own Rights if the Subjects would hold theirs I transcribe for you the Picture of a vigorous Prince riding a Nation after he had defeated its Enemies  Cervus equum pugnâ melior communibus herbis  Pellebat donec minor in certamine longo  Imploravit opes hominis frenumque recepit  Sed postquam victor violens discessit ab hoste  Non equitem dorso non frenum depulit ore  Since I am grown a little pedantick upon the Subject of Slavery I will put you in Mind of the ridiculous the miserable Figure which a MockSenate makes You have two beautiful Sketches of such Assembles in  Juvenal  proper to excite your Laughter and Indignation In one you have the Prime Minister destroyed at once on his Master's Letter the World agrees in an Opinion  Sejanus  was guilty but Justice would expect some Proof of it  Tiberuis  had too loyal a Senate to wait for any Evidence their Tyrant signified his Pleasure and that served for Demonstration to  that very Senate  which had voted Statues to  that very Prime Minister  The other Scene is the merry one where they take into Consideration the overgrown  Turbet  Nothing can be more fantastick than the blind Haranguer making a florid Speech in Praise of it and unfortunately turning his Face from it to the contrary Side of the Room in order to point out and descant upon its Beauties Such are the  Ardua Negotia Imperii  proper to be laid before a Parliament of Slaves Such are the  Arcana  fit for them to debate on  LETTER XII  Mar  IF Victory has not made us or our Allies too insolent it is impossible that the great Folks at  Gertruydenburgh  should fail to settle the Repose of  Europe  But if we overvalue ourselves and underrate our Grand Enemy we shall find that he is an absolute Prince and a proud one too and rather than stoop too low he will give us an Opportunity to buy more Laurels at too dear a Rate to purchase more costly Hangings for  WestminsterHall  But we have fought enough for Glory and for Profit too for we may make good Bargains now if we think fit after our surprizing Successes to make Peace Sword in Hand  The D of  M  has been rewarded for his glorious Victories in this War in a most extraordinary Manner as indeed he deserved but Envy will not let him injoy his Honours in Peace it is the usual Fate of superlative Merit  Comperit invidiam supremo fine domari  To be raised by the Smiles of their Prince above their Equals happens to several Favourites in every Court in every Generation But for a  British  Subject a Protestant  to have a Fief a Principality of the  Empire  conferred on him by a  Roman Catholick  Emperor of  Germany  and not only to be promoted to the highest Honours by his Soveraign that are in her Power to bestow but also to have his transcendent Merit proclaimed by the united Voice of the Legislature and transcendently rewarded by an ample Recital of his famous Exploits and by the Gift of a Princely Revenue and Royal Manor to him with an unusual Limitation of those and of his Honours in Favour of his Posterity these I say are Circumstances of human Grandeur which few Subjects in many Ages will be seen to attain to A Pinacle above which a Man of rational Desires would not endeavour to soar  All the little Sallies of Satire against him will be buried in Oblivion when the Statute that recites his Victories and intails a Royal Inheritance to reward them shall record his Glory to late Posterity There is nothing wanting to compleat his Character but this that he shall be as willing to let his Country enjoy the Fruits of his Victories as he has been able to gain them that he shew himself as grateful to  England  as She has been to him that he may judge a Princely Fortune a Fortune unrivalled by any other Subject to be sufficient for him  and his Family and that he may not desire to make a Trade of War because he profits by it tho' at the same time it consumes whole Nations and his Mother  Great Britain  among the rest  LETTER XIII  April  YOU rightly observe that this hotheaded Priest has cost both Houses more Time and Trouble than his Head is worth What matters it if he has been too peremptory in the Pulpit on a Subject he might better have let alone Some Parts of his Sermons are little better than Nonsense but the general Doctrine may be supported by the Authority of all our most eminent Divines and corresponds with that Maxim in Law that  the King can do no Wrong  I think the Doctor and his Prosecutors have split on the same Rock an extraordinary Case like the Revolution is quite out of the ordinary Rules of Law and not defined among the general Learning of the Casuists concerning the Obedience of Subjects to their Soveraign The Doctor ought not to have drawn the Revolution into the Debate nor ought we to fancy that the Maxims of the Laws of God  of Nature and of the Land are changed by that extraordinary Occasion and Event Tho' I am persuaded the same Tenet has been taught ever since our Reformation yet this Gentleman's Manner of teaching it is indiscreet and his Warmth has been singular several Years ago  Defoe  in his  Hymn to the Pillory  has long since justly celebrated the Doctor's intemperate Zeal against the Dissenters I think  Defoe  had been then exalted for writing  The shortest Way with the Dissenters  He wishes that all who merit equal Punishment might stand there along with him and then descending to Particulars says he  There wou'd the fam'd  Sachev'rel  stand  With Trumpet of Sedition in his Hand  Sounding the first Crusado in the Land  He from a  ChurchofEngland  Pulpit first  All his Dissenting Brethren curst  Doom'd them to Satan for a Prey  And first found out  The shortest Way  But the Consequence of this mighty Eclat is that most People are apt to consider a Sentence against this Preacher not as a Condemnation of this Temerity by instancing the Revolution upon an improper Occasion and of his unwarrantable pronouncing Damnation against the Dissenters  but as an Establishment of the Discretionary Resistance of the Subject and as a Degradation of Kingly Power in  England  to the Condition of the Consular in  Rome  controled by the Senate Tribunes and People and all this by a solemn Judgement of the Lords at the Demand of the Commons  Our Political Penmen who swarm in every Age will not fail hereafter to magnify every Mistake every Slip in every Administration and even to call Virtue Vice Sweet Bitter and Good Evil  Algernon Sidney  's Treatise of Government will pass upon many for the Law of the Land and those who approve most of the Revolution may live to see this latitudinarian Allegiance which the misguided People will be apt to learn become troublesome under the best Princes  I should think therefore this Prosecution cannot have been a very agreeable Entertainment to the Queen nor a pleasing Speculation to those who are in the Course of Succession to the Crown  In the mean time Conversation runs as low with us in Town as you describe it in the Country You can hardly find a rational Creature to talk to or a rational Topic to talk upon Go where you will you meet the  Doctor  Be it  pro  or  con  it is still the  Doctor  The devout Adherers  to the literal Construction of Holy Writ say that the sacred Volume is in Peril and ejaculate their Apprehensions in Metre One of their  Pasquins  closes thus  Tho' all the Fathers great and small  From good St  Austin  back to  Paul  Did justify the Criminal  Yet nothing cou'd acquit the Priest  Nor Father  Paul  nor  Jesus Christ  Look to your Doctrine  Paul  and  Jesus  Sachev'rel  's Sermons do not please us  He copy'd you was your Disciple  Next Turn is your's they'll burn the Bible  The Poet's Partiality in Favour of the Doctor is as extravagant as his Apprehension of the Danger of burning the Bible I give you this only as a Specimen or rather Symptom of the Fever of the Town for I assure you the Zealous of my Acquaintance who read these Lines are as fond of them as he can be that made them for my own Part I rather agree with Mr  Dryden  to count such Clergymen  The  Phaetons  of Mankind who fire that World  Which they were sent by preaching but to warm  The Alteration of the manyheaded Monster in Seventy yea in Thirty Years  is unaccountable  Pym  and his Fellows were idolized by the Multitude of this very City for the Reverse of this Doctrine and so were the Seven Bishops But now if any Man has a Doubt about it let him not divulge that Doubt in the Streets of  London  If the present Humour of the Town continues a little longer I shall be able to send you an whole Suit of Apparel or Set of Houshold Furniture sanctified with the goodly Image of the Doctor  LETTER XIII  August  IT is not doubted that this Treaty will end in Peace in Spite of all Opposers It is pretty unhappy for us that all the Nations engaged in War should not concur with us to wish heartily for the general Tranquillity of  Europe  Nor will I answer for our own Soldiers of Fortune The inferior Officers make a great Clamour against it in Coffeehouses and other Places of publick Resort and if you will take their Words they speak the Sense of the Nation but do not you believe a Word of that  The Emperor perhaps fancies that it is the Business of  GreatBritain  to raise the House of  Austria  on the Ruins of that of  Bourbon  and of  GreatBritain  together  the  Dutch  can never be tired of having the Subsistence Money of our Great Land Army circulate in their Country and the little Princes of  Germany  can afford to hire out Troops to us a good while longer if we can find Cash to pay for them this is a trade among them  Mancipiis locuples eget oeris Capadocum Rex  But  England  seems as well as  France  and  Spain  to have occasion for a Peace and for some of the same Reasons We have not been beaten often it is true we have gotten great Victories yet still we are Sufferers and must be so as the Scene has been laid What we conquer in  Flanders  is to be divided between the  Dutch  and the  Emperor  and  Spain  is also to be conquered for the latter As if the House of  Austria  might not Lord it over  Europe  as severely as that of  Bourbon  as if it were necessary to exhaust ourselves to bring a Moiety of  Europe  under a single Person lest a Moiety of  Europe  should at some Time or other hereafter which possibly may never happen fall under the Dominion of a single Person This is  ne moriare mori  with a Witness Nay it is worse it is giving boot where the Exchange at even hand would be a bad Bargain it is  paying our Blood and Treasure to set  Charles  on the  Spanish  Throne when we can leave  Philip  there without farther Expence and when of the two it is rather our Interest that  Philip  should fill it and the best of the Jest is that not one of them pretends to shew how  GreatBritain  is to be reimbursed a single Stiver whatever her Expence has been or may be hereafter This is a well chosen Game to play at where we may lose and cannot win We are told indeed that by carrying on the War we shall keep out the  Pretender  I fancy at this Time of Day  France  will readily agree to make us more secure against him by a Peace  It is to be hoped that the Outcry in CoffeeHouses of Red Coats who have the Fear of Breaking before their Eyes may be slighted that those who have made a Trade of War either abroad or at Home may have no Influence upon our Councils that our Ministers will sit down to treat in Temper and not in Spite thar they will rather imitate  Martin  's Behaviour in the  Tale of a Tub  than his Brother  Jack  's We must not pique ourselves on pulling down every thing which our Domestick Enemies have built  I can only  wish  that the Wings of  France  may be effectually clipped even to  the dismembering some of its Provinces if possible in Favour of  Savoy Lorain Bavaria  any body and that if we are to have the least Retribution for all our Labours Costs and Losses it may be allotted to us in Islands above all Places and above all Islands in those of  America  which produce Sugars and Cotton A small Portion in these would answer our Purposes better than twenty Capital Fortresses on the Continent of  Europe  They would be a Mine and not an Issue of Treasure As for any Fortress as  Dunkirk Gibraltar  or any other that may annoy our Traffick it would be convenient to reduce them to the Condition of  Tangiers  but not to think of holding them  I am strangely fond of those  American  Islands and think I can justify my Notion by a short Observation upon a well known Piece of History I frequently recollect that  Jamacia  was taken by mere Accident  Oliver  had formed a much greater Design which miscarried and when only  Jamacia  was the Prize his Commanders were called to a severe Account He was also Master of  Dunkirk  and King  Charles  the Second of  Tangier  in Dowry with his Queen These were monstrously expensive so as not to be tenable The People grumbled that the Crown did not keep  them but as long as they were kept they grumbled also at the great Expence of maintaining them These are gone for ever from  England  while the poor despicable Island of  Jamacia  has grown a flourishing Colony is become an inexhaustible Fund of Wealth to us and occasions the constant Employment of a considerable Fleet of  British  Merchants  The Dominion of the Seas is what we are able to maintain it maintains itself The more we have of it the less Danger we are in of being invaded in it by the envying World confederated against us It is one of the clearest Demonstrations it is Vulgar Arithmetick that if we carry a Million of Tuns of Goods each Year a thousands Leagues and our Neighbour carries but the tenth Part of that Quantity the like Voyage we shall maintain tenfold his Shipping tenfold his Seamen and in Consequence be able to meet ten such Neighbours as Enemies at once upon the Watry Plain  If our IslandColonies were very considerable in Number and Value we should find this great Convenience that they would require no Garisons because no Armament could appear upon the Seas sufficient to disturb them Nor ought we to oppress them nor suffer them to be oppressed  rapacious Governors But while our Neighbours are stronger in those Parts than we are both We are and the Colonies must be burthened with the Expence of an armed Force both by Sea and Land for their Security Were they ever so populous had they as many People among them as their Mother Country contains there would be no Danger of their Defection while we gave them no Cause to mourn the Want of Liberty Their Trade would all pass thro' our Hands protected by our Fleets while they lived at Ease and in as perfect Obedience as the several Parishes of  Middlesex  LETTER XIV  May  WE are under terrible Apprehensions here about no less than Church and State This has been the Devil of a Plot and it is proved by Means that must not be discovered for if a Plotter knows how a Decypherer found him out it seems he may grow so cunning in perplexing his Cypher that the Artist will not be able to follow him any longer Silly Traitors is it then possible to invent inextricable Cyphers and  you remain so indolent as to put your Lives and Fortunes on a Key as simple as  Julius Caesar  's which the Schoolboys have learned from  Suetonius  for these Sixteen hundred Years past  Treason is a paw Thing  a noisy Crime of State  as  Dryden  says I'll have none on't There's  Perkins  's Head on  TempleBar  like  Cymon  in  Dryden  's Fables  Whistles for want of Thought  From all Men of Common Sense Heaven avert the Omen  There is an  English  Bishop a  Spanish  Cardinal an  Irish  General a  British  Peer or twain a Brace of very small Nonjuring Priests but one of them has drowned himself I wish you were to see the Wall he got over you would judge how ingenious and nimble too he must have been all these and more are Personages in the  Drama  which has lately entertained the Town I say nothing of Proofs some People are very believing and others were mere Infidels The Doctrine of Transubstantiation has had full Credit with our Ancestors in Spite of their Senses And yet  Zeno  in another Age would not believe there was such a Thing as Motion  For my own Part I design as long as I live to be Courtly in my Political Creed  Want of Acknowledging that  a Cloud is like a Whale or very like a Weazel  Since  Plots true or false are necessary Things  why should we doubt of the Reality of this But for irrefragable Proofs of it peruse the Arguments of the SollicitorGeneral  c  Mr  Wynne  a young Lawyer is much applauded for the Defence The D of  W  has shone in his House on the Occasion he has taken abundance of Pains to observe upon the Evidence which makes his Speech much the longer it delighted many of the Hearers But the Masterpiece of Eloquence on this Occasion in my poor Opinion is Mr  K  's which you receive a Copy of it is indeed the most finished Performance of the greatest Orator our Island ever boasted There is nothing omitted that was necessary to be remembred there is not a superfluous Sentence not an illturned Period not an illchosen Expression in the whole There is that Strength of Reasoning in answering the Arguments of the Adversary and that Clearness of Diction to convey to us his own Sentiments that it is like a polished Diamond of the first Water and most excellent Workmanship It is impossible to say whether its Firmness or its Lustre be  most predominant or for which of those Merits in the highest Degree of Perfection all other Gems must yeild it the Prefertence  LETTER XV  May  YOUR Complaint is very just that by the Titles of Impeachments in Parliament a Man at a Distance off cannot guess what the Accusation is This against the Earl of  M**  consisted chiefly of two Branches one that he sold the Offices of the Masters in Chancery for very great Sums of Money which Offices are in some Degree judicial the Sale of them therefore must naturally introduce Corruption in the Officers according to the Adage He that buys Justice must sell Justice The other Branch is that to conceal this Sin as it commonly happens he fell into a greater Large Sums of Money belonging chiefly to Orphans had by the Authority of the Court been deposited in the Hands of these Masters some of them thought it a proper Opportunity to grow rich nor scrupled to adventure the Fortunes of their Neighbours they met with woeful Disappointments of their Expectations  there were great Deficiencies and the Chancellor to screen them was guilty of shameful Delays of Justice by putting off the Hearing of the Causes affected by these Losses  To the Wonder of the gazing World and maugre the zealous Endeavours of some most Noble Peers this corrupt Man is to continue a Judge upon his Honour of the Lives and Fortunes of  Englishmen  he is to continue to make our Laws and to interpret them He is condemned in thirty thousand Pounds it is true but  cui bono  Not to repair the suffering Suitors but as a Fine to the Crown which perhaps may remit it tho' the People have received the greatest Injury How then are the Sufferers to be repaired think ye Why truly it is rumoured by a Tax to be laid on the Suitors in that Court The innocent Suitors who may be esteemed sufficiently unfortunate in having Occasion to resort thither are to be punished for the Iniquities of the Chancellor  The House of Lords is not bound by the Forms of the Courts below Stairs and the Impeachments before them are managed pretty much in the Stile of the Civil Law it were to be wished in the Case of this Earl they had adopted a Form of that Law which is proper to produce a just and rational Sentence upon Crimes like  these they have lately censured The Criminal Process among the Civilians is frequently if not always in the Nature of an Action  Qui tam  c I have seen a Libel of theirs for Homicide which amounted to an Appeal as well as Indictment In a Case like this they would in the first Place have given Relief to the Injured out of his Estate and then have made a reasonable Confiscation to the Prince as a Punishment of his Crimes Thus they would have fulfilled the Dictates both of Commutative and Distributive Justice Restition was barely a Debt and Confiscation was a moderate Punishment  If a Sentence of Sir  George Oxenden  's who opened this Impeachment had been duly weighed we should hardly see the Innocent taxed for the Crimes of the solvent Guilty  See the Close of the XVIth Letter  But we have never been fond of changing our Laws no not even for the better the Lords in Parliament four hundred Years ago to reject a mischievous Ecclesiastical Proposal answered  Nolumus leges Angliae mutari  An answer highly laudable on that Occasion and ever since we have it trumped up to us as a Maxim without the least Attention to the Difference of the Matters in Question I will mention to you Two strong Instances instead of twenty of our supine Neglect  in amending our Laws The Landlord from all Antiquity might distrain his Tenant for Rent due and then the Distress must perish in his Hands if the Tenant could not pay for the Lord could not sell it till enabled by a Statute made in the Days of King  Charles  II This Piece of Common Law we sent to  Ireland  but they found the Remedy one hundred and fifty Years earlier than we did Another Instance is that the then Statute of Administrations which is but a Translation from the one hundred and eighteenth Novel was made in the latter End of the same Reign and no earlier and we are sure that our Law was a regular and flourishing Profession four hundred Years without it Perhaps it flourished the more for differing in many Points from common Sense  LETTER XVI  Feb  THERE is one of the Wonders of the World to be accomplished this Session the Salt Tax will be abolished It is a new Thing for the Crown to lose Ground in the Revenue Our History shews very few Instances of the kind Tho' the  Occasion was most urgent when the Tax was imposed and tho' the Grant of it was only temporary and for a very short Time too yet Pretences have been always found to continue the Burthen when the Necessity ceased Our Oracle in the Law and Records of Parliament observes that Tonnage and Poundage were granted first to King  Henry  the Fifth to enable Him to invade and conquer  France  but his unfortunate Son who lost that Acquisition back again enjoyed the same Revenue as did also Queen  Mary  the First who lost  Calais  the only Fragment of it that remained till her Time So forcible is a Possession in the Crown that People are apt to suffer it to turn to a Right But this Mistake cost King  Charles  the First dear it was the First Grievance of his Reign and disposed a knowing a resolute Generation of Freeman whose Spirits were not broken by Taxes and Standing Armies to examine every thing with Rigour Yet not all the Difficulties and Misfortunes of his Reign could deter his Son King  James  the Second tho' he did not want the Money from levying the same Revenue before it was given by Parliament I think we have one Instance in the  English  History of the Monarch's taking less than the Subject gave and that was in the Days  of Good Queen  Elizabeth  who chose to reign in the Hearts of her People who depressed Monopolies and particular Schemes of robbing the Publick and esteemed the Wealth and Honour of the Nation as her own  If Farmers in their Tillage and their Diet Merchants in Victualling their Ships Potters in their Manufacture but above all the Fishery that  Diu multumque desideratum  of  Great Britain  require such immense Quantities of Salt that it is impossible to maintain the Officers and to make any considerable Profit of that Revenue if we allow Drawbacks for all those Purposes not to speak of the frequent Frauds upon Exportation and as on the other Hand we would not have our Neighbours Till their Land Navigate their Ships Cure their Fish and even be able to sell an earthen Pitcher cheaper than we can it is really amazing to consider how this Tax came first to be granted in this Nation but it is much more astonishing that the Experience of its Michiefs had not long ago awakened the Legislature to redeem it It is not strange that the People should gladly embrace the Opportunity of Deliverance from this Oppression the Miracle is that a First Minister should give his Voice for so considerable a Reduction of his  Myrmidons should concur in abolishing a Tax which seems calculated to create Ministerial Dependencies and to corrupt Voices for Parliamentary Elections Perhaps like  Sylla  he knows he has so well convinced the World of his transcendent Ability for Mischief that he may retire in Safety with the Spoil of Nations and deserve the Thanks of Mankind for plaguing them no longer But if he designs to pursue the Plan which he has hitherto proceeded on the Trained Bands of the SaltDuty are an illjudged Reduction of his Forces He does not usually commit such Blunders in Domestick Politicks whatever his Enemies object to his Skill and Address in Foreign Treaties Taxes burthensome as This is make Standing Armies necessary and great Armies cannot be maintained without burthensome Taxes they are Bawd and Punk to each other but the poor Nation is always the Cully  It is a Proposition as demonstrable as any in  Euclid  that heavy Taxes must naturally destroy this or any other trading populous Nation which depends greatly on its own Manufactures Yet neither the small Vulgar nor the Great can comprehend this Truth If  France  can maintain her Manufacturer in proper Provinces at Ten Pounds  per Ann  when ours must cost Twenty and if the  Value of  l  in Wool will employ at least six Persons at a Medium  per Ann  the  English  Account will stand thus For Wool  l  for Work  l  Total  l  The  French  may be stated thus For Wool  l  for Work  l  Total  l  so that the  French  may sell Wares of equal Goodness at  l  which we shall not be able to sell under  l  and this upon a Supposition too that they pay  l  for one third Part of their Quantity of Wool which costs us only  l  Thus if we suppose that they use two thirds of their own Growth they can afford to give for what they buy from us or from  Ireland  double the Price of our Market and yet sell so much cheaper than we can as is already stated  Our Manufacturers make a Noise about the running of Wool and about that only as if this were their only Evil They are assisted in their Clamour and misled in their Reasoning by those whose Business it is to raise a Dust and to hide the true the principal Cause of the Declension of the  British  Trade that is of the  British  Grandeur This assigning  non causa pro causa  is when it can pass upon People the most dangerous kind of Sophistry the Principle being false the falfe Deductions from it may be numberless  If a Master Weaver who returns Twenty Thousand Pounds a Year in his Trade should complain that Wool is risen Ten  per Cent  by clandestine Exportation and that the Manufacturer is ruined by it it would be in vain to tell him that there is a single Evil that prejudices his Manufacture in a much greater Degree He would laugh at me as an ignorant Pretender to presume to be wiser than a Man in his own Trade And yet I may venture to say that the Duty on Soap and Candles is an heavier Clog on the Manufacture than any probable Advance in the Price of the unwrought Commodity can amount to But here is the Difference the Master knows when he pays an advanced Price for Wool but he forgets that he pays the CandleTax in the Wages of the Workman  I do not mean upon the Whole that  France  will be able to cut us out from every particular Branch or Article of the Woollen Manufacture I doubt not that we are in Possession of a Manufacture of some Sorts both of Cloths and Stuffs which they cannot equal especially without the Help of our Wool or that of  Ireland  But then this must be admitted that tho' we could totally cut of the clandestine Exportation yet the  French  would still be able to increase in the Manufacture of vast Quantities of coarse Goods and let us  remember that tho' a Yard of fine Cloth may be worth a Guinea yet the Proportion of that Export is but small It is the Cloathing of the Millions that makes Millions of Money and if the  French  are to supplant us in foreign Markets for the Sale of coarse Goods tho' perhaps the Fountain of our Wealth will not be quite exhausted yet I fear it will run miserably low It is idle to say that their coarse Manufactures will not be as good as ours if they sell at a lower Price that will more than compensate the Difference The Multitude do not affect the nicest Goods they are glad to be warm at a cheap Rate and I think our Merchants have said something like this in their Complaints of the  Irish  Trade to  Lisbon  They say that the  Irish  Goods are not comparable to ours but because they can undersell us they have a ready Market while ours lye unsold upon the Factors Hands  It would be proper to apply this Complaint against  Ireland  to  France  and to  Prussia  too for the  Prussian  has supplanted us very lately in our Trade to  Muscovy  to the Value of many Thousand Pounds a Year for coarse cloathing for the  Russian  Armies Does all this depend on the Running of Wool from home Has the Almighty given fleecy Sheep only to  England  and  Ireland  We may possibly hinder Foreigners from getting our Wool but what  Act of Parliament shall prevent their working up their own Why do not we make a Law to forbid their Grass to grow and to interrupt their Sunshine  Nothing but the true Foundation of the Growth of the Wealth of private Dealers can make a trading Nation flourish We must sell great Quantities and that cannot happen unless we sell at least as cheap as our Neighbours It is easy to see that we cannot effect this while we are plunged in Debt It is no Wonder that we are thus in Debt since after our devouring Land War we continue to support a great Army at home and abroad ever since and that by Taxes which were half devoured by those who collected them It is natural for People to flock out of the MortgagedKingdom to  America France  or  Holland  or any other Place where their Industry may feed and cloath them which it cannot at home And thus just as it happens in the Case of private Persons the Increase of the Nation's Debt occasions the Decrease of the Means of paying it The Loss of the Nation by maintaining a great Army is not yet sufficiently stated besides the positive Loss of paying them there is also a negative Loss of at least Two Hundred Thousand Pounds  per Ann  which they would and ought to get if they were left to labour for their Subsistence  I am c  Miscellaneous Letters  A Letter from Bishop BARLOW to his Honored Friend Mr  Edward Cooke  This Gentleman was one of the Benchers of the  Temple  and some time Licenser of the Press  at his House in  PlowYard  in  FetterLane  I Have received your Letter and the ingenuous book  A  Discourse  on the  Nature  of the  EnglishConstitution  Written by Mr  Cooke  you so kindly Sent me and this comes with my love and Service to bring my harty Thanks Though my businesses be many and my Infirmities more beinge now past the year of my Age yet I have read over your Booke with great content and satisfaction For I doe really believe that the many pertinent Records and profes which you have brought are sufficient to evince the truth of your positions You have done me a great honor in the Conclusion of your Booke which I wish I were worthy of You are  pleased to make use of the same words and chalenge to yours which I have made to my  See his Remains  Adversaries and I doubt not but you will and God willinge I shall when there is a just occasion be able to make good that chalenge Some of our late scriblers seeme to make the Kingdome of  England  rather Elective than Successive and Hereditary and that it is in the Power of the Parliament to depose and sett upp Kings or alter the Government which was fatally and traiterously put in practice to the horror and amazement of all good men by the late longe Parliament yet it is evident and in our laws and publique Acts of Parliament declared which you better know that this Kingdom ever was and for ever  Statut Jacob I Cap  ought to be hererditary and successive Nor did the Conqueror or any Kinge since ever acknowledge or pretend to any popular or Parliamentary Election But even those Kings who had not an undoubted immediate right of Succession did ever clame the Crowne as Heires and Successors to it Soe  William  the Conqueror as you have well proved so  Henry  the after the Deposition of  Richard  the did in fall Parliament challenge the Crowne  Jure Sanguinis  as legall Heire to it as appeare by our authentique Records  The Record is now in print amongst our Historians published by  Vide Historiae Anglicanae Scriptores Decem pag  lin    Cornelius Bee  who had that Record from me But I need not tell you what I believe you better know And  Henry  the as my Lord  Bacon  in his Life tells us as I remember when he was to be proclamed Kinge layed clame to it not onely as marryinge  Elizabeth  next Heire of the House of  Yorke  but by Inheritance and in right of the House of  Lancaster  They all know that the Kingdome of  England  was hereditary and successive and therefore they all had or pretended to that Title and not to any parliamentary or popular Election  I beg your pardon for this tedious and I fear impertinent scrible My love and Service with my thanks for your Civility and undeserved kindnes to me once more remembered you shall at this Time have noe farther trouble from  Your much obliged friend and servant Thomas Lincolne  Buckden  March  PS  Pray present my respects and service to my worthy friend and cossin Mr  William Petyt  of the Temple  LETTERS OF Bishop  FLEETWOOD  Containing His Sentiments of the PROCEEDINGS of the NEW MINISTRY during the Last Four Years Reign of Queen  ANNE  _WHEN that unhappy Change was made in the  Queen  's Measures which blasted all the Glories and Triumphs of the Eight preceding Years this good Bishop who was a steady Friend to the  Old Ministry  because he saw they had served their Country well and faithfully could not be drawn to give any Countenance to the Measures of the  New One  tho' Endeavours had been used and Intimations given by the Queen herself who had a great Value for him how pleasing his frequent coming to Court would be to her But his Sentiments will best appear from his own Words in a  Letter  to a FRIEND  viz    When my Duty to the Queen and the Good of my Country will permit it my Gratitude will never let me vote against my Friends when I have saved my Conscience I give myself up to what I call my Honour and therefore under all the Discouragements I can be I shall always be on the Side of the late Ministry because I know they served the Queen and Nation so well that I am morally assured they never will be served better and whenever they are I shall certainly be on their Side who do that Service I think I may be allowed to act as clear and disinterested a Part as any Man of our Order for sure if I could shift my Side I might be well accepted considering what Relation I have had to One  The Earl of  Rochester  who governs all and who is very civil to me upon all Occasions but the Measures we are in are by no Means pleasing to me as what will never do the Nation's Business and I foresee that all our Millions and our Blood spent for these twenty Years past will end in a despicable Peace which yet we must pitifully sue for too  About two Years after when he was again asked his Opinion of the Situation of our Public Affairs his Answer was as follows  I have been and am still in so ill Humour with relation to them that I  hardly can endure to think of them We were in the greatest Honour abroad of any Nation in the Earth we are now the Scorn of all People Our Friends hate us and our Enemies laugh at us We shall neither have a good Peace nor a good War  France  will not give us the first and we ourselves have cut off the Means of the last The Disgrace of the Duke of  Marlborough  was worth a Million at least and yet I do not hear we got a Farthing by it which I impute not to our Honesty and Virtue but to our Folly Malice Infatuation and the great Haste we are in to be undone The Parliament has passed such a Censure upon the Duke that I dare aver no equal Number of Men in all the World of what Nation or Religion soever would have done But the laying him aside is so strange a thing that People are put to all their Shifts to account for it and to make it go down with the World must invent exaggerate and say and do any thing to make him appear worthy of such Ʋsage but I expect it will turn to his Enemies Mischief as it certainly does to his Honour that after so keen and malicious an Inquisition into his Conduct their great Master should be able to accuse him of nothing but of doing what all Generals have done before him and what King  William  always did  In  May  he published FOUR  Sermons  on extraordinary Occasions  On the Death of Queen  Mary  On the Death of the D of  Glôster  On the Death of K  William  On the Accession of Q  Anne  with a PREFACE which was ordered to be burnt by a Vote of the Majority of the  House  of  Commons  Upon this most unjust Affront his Lordship wrote the following Letter to the Bishop of  Salisbury  TO The Bishop of  Salisbury  June  MY LORD  I Received the Favour of your Lordship's Letter and took it as I know it was intended very kindly The Manner of my receiving the Indignity put upon my Preface was neither like a Christian nor Philosopher but like a very worldly Man I knew the whole Process and knew it to be a Piece of  Revenge  For Printing a few Months before his excellent SERMON  against Those that Delight in War  Wherein he had set the ungenerous Treatment shewn the D of  Marlborough  in such a Light as will reflect everlasting Infamy upon his Persecutors the Professed Enemies of their Country  taken by a  wicked Party  that found themselves sorely stung  and it affected me accordingly  ie  very little I am not one that love to be the Talk of the Town and in this Part I confess I was uneasy although I think the Talk was very much in my Favour The Complaint was  made  by  Hungerford  A sneering trifling Wrangler and much more noted at the Bar for Noise and Clamour than a Knowledge of the Laws of his Country  and  seconded  by  Manley  A Tool of  Hungerford  's par Nobile Fratrum    People  that should indeed have been ordered to have burnt it and  thirded  by what we call the  Court  and carried by Numbers without a wise Word said against it Sir  Peter King  Sir  Joseph Jekyll  Mr  Lechmere  and others of the Robe were very strenuous Advocates in its Behalf and so were other Gentlemen but to no great Purpose for the  Court  divided and my Friends but If their Design was to intimidate me they have lost it utterly or if to suppress the Book it happens much otherwise for every Body's Curiosity is awakened by this Ʋsage and the Bookseller finds his Account in it above any one else The  Spectator  has conveyed above of them into other People's Hands that would otherwise have never seen or heard of it In a word  My Lord  when I consider that these Gentlemen have used me no worse  than I think they have used their own Country the  Emperour  the  States  the  House of Hanover  and all our Allies Abroad as well as all the  Bravest Wisest  and the  Honestest  Men we have at Home I am more inclined to become vain than any ways depress'd at what has befallen me and intend to set up for a Man of Merit upon this very Stock But Pleasantry apart my Heart is wounded within me when I consider seriously whereabouts we are and whither we are tending The CourtParty do now own publickly that except the Allies accept of the Conditions that are offered them King  Philip  is not to make any  Renunciation  and certainly the Allies cannot accept of those Conditions unless they are distressed to the last Degree We must and shall have a separate Peace in spite of all that can be said and that must be without a  Renunciation  on the Part of  France  and without a Guaranty from the Allies and what a Peace is that like to be It is now said that  England  is to constrain the King of  France  to content the  States  with a Barrier to their liking and that the rest will come in or stand out without any Danger but I am afraid  England  has lost all her constraining Power and that  France  thinks she has us in her Hands and may use us as  she pleases which I dare say will be as scurvily as we deserve What a Change has Two Years made Your Lordship may now imagine you are growing young again for we are fallen methinks into the very Dregs of  Charles the Second  's Politicks saving that then they were more reasonable because our Enemy was then in so full Power and Lustre as might both terrify and dazzle a poor luxurious Prince who would not be disturbed nor seemed to care much what became of  England  after he was gone The present Times may put you in Mind of those with this bad Difference still that now the ruinous Effects of those Advices seem to be taking Place after an Interval of five or six and twenty Years and after such an Interruption as one would have thought should have quite baffled and destroyed them I find  My Lord  upon reading my Letter that I have entred upon deep Matters which considering the Times and the  Spâ  Waters I have taken I ought not to have done You will I hope excuse me for methought I was talking with you who I believe favour me I have I thank God an intire Trust in his Goodness and know he has hitherto preserved us beyond all reasonable Hopes without and against all our Deservings but will he still go on to save us against  our Will and in the Midst of our Endeavours to destroy ourselves I hope He will for else I think we are a lost People I pray God to preserve your Lordship and all your Family  I am My Lord Your Lordship's most humble Servant W ASAPH  About Three Years after the writing of this  Letter  he had a true Sense of the great Blessing this Nation enjoyed by having both its Civil and Religious Rights fixed on such a sure and lasting Foundation as that of the  Protestant Succession  by the Arrival of King  George  I For  though neither You nor I  said this good Bishop to an intimate Friend  are to look for any Amendment of our Fortunes yet we have now the Satisfaction that we shall enjoy our little Properties in Quiet and Security and transmit them safe to our Children  Such was the great Tranquillity of his Mind He never aspired after or was sollicitous for a Change but yet his Deserts were justly and soon considered by his Majesty for on the Demise of Bishop  Moore  he was Translated to the See of  Ely  This Promotion he had enjoyed almost Nine Years when he Died  Anno    Bishop  Atterbury  to Mr  Dennis  SIR  _I Hear  one  of my  Adversaries  A certain Minister of State  has not considered duly

Neighbour informed me of your Return to  Paris  I resolved to see you as soon as I found myself able to stir abroad The Gout obliged me to defer that Happiness for some Time and when at length I hoped to enjoy it it was my Misfortune that you was not at home It remains therefore that I perform by Letter what I could not do by Word of Mouth and that I give you hearty Thanks for the many Favours you have conferred on me of which I shall always retain a grateful Remembrance  Those Presents of the Books which you have published of late Years are to me very valuable and do me abundance of Honour for most worthy Sir I greatly esteem you and every Thing of yours Every thing you write in that Kind of Learning is finely finished and I not only prefer you before all other Writers in that Way but esteem you as the most perfect Master both of Style and Sentiment And tho' I have spent some little Time and Pains myself in Pursuit of this very Study yet I freely own that when I read your Works over and over I learn not only those Things from you which I did not know but also many Things which I thought I had been Master of before Therefore you speak too modestly of your Persormance when you say it is only calculated for the Instruction of Youth Men who are well acquainted with this Branch of Learning may certainly read your Writings with Pleasure and with Profit You revive indeed to our Memories Facts that are ancient and well known but in reviveing them you illustrate and adorn them to the Old you add something New to the Works of Others something that is intirely your Own and by placing good Pictures in a good Light you bring it to pass that they give greater Pleasure and appear more  beautiful than ever even to those who have often seen them before  As you frequently turn over  Xenophon  you clearly seem to have borrowed from him both the Matter which you relate in many Places and the manner of relating it and you have not only imitated but have manifestly acquired the Perspicuity and neat Simplicity of his Style So that if  Xenophon  had understood  French  I am of Opinion he would have written in no other Words or Manner than you have done upon the same Subject  I say not these Things to flatter a Vice I am not at all liable to but from my real Sentiments and as you have inriched me with the choicest Gifts to which I know myself unable to make a suitable Return in the same or any other Kind of Learning I was at least desirous to shew a willing and grateful Mind to you and to make you some small Present  The Bishop sent Him his Sermons  tho' very unlike what I had received Go on most Learned and Reverend Sir to deserve well of the Republic of Letters in these Days too much neglected and despised Go on to form the Youth of  France  since you will acknowledge your self useful only to them by the best Precepts and Examples  Which that you may accomplish may God add many Years to your Life and may they be attended with Health and Tranquillity These Sir are the hearty Wishes of  Your most Obedient Servant FRANCIS ROCHESTER  PS  Our Friend your Neighbour told me you would dine with me after the Holydays When you have fixed your Day be

commendet quem Vos Patres maximè colendi pro tenerrima in Clerum affectu calculis vestris comproberis  Dr  SMALRIDGE  's SPEECH TO THE Upper House of  Convocation  This Version was made by Dr  Sewell  and approv'd by Dr  Smalridge  THE CLERGY  Most Reverend Father  Addressing Himself to Archbishop TENNISON  have in the usual manner with all Fidelity discharged the Duty You injoined them the Choice of a Man of Learning and Eloquence out of their own Body fit to undertake and equal to execute the Office of their PROLOCUTOR and they do this Day recommend to you  Venerable Fathers  by my Mouth this Excellent Person  Dr  Francis Atterbury  already by his great Merits to the Church sufficiently recommended to Our to Your and the general Esteem of all good Men a Person endowed with such  Talents that he deserves all manner of Praise so high in Fame and Reputation that he stands in need of none a Person so exactly suiting the Plan and Character which our Ancestors laid down for a PROLOCUTOR that he may well seem selected from among Us to this high Dignity not so much by our VOTES as by the Ancient Rules of CONVOCATIONS  For if a Store of exquisite Learning can be of any Assistance in the Discharge of this Office who can discharge it with greater Applause to himself or more Advantage to Us than One who is well acquainted with  all  Parts of Literature long and successfully exercised in  most  Arts and Studies most accomplished and perfect in those Sciences which admit of the greatest Perfection If lastly it is a peculiar part of the Character of a Complete PROLOCUTOR to express by his single Tongue the Sentiments of many Eloquent Men we have an Orator of so finished an Elegance that You Fathers need not fear that his Unskilfulness should diminish the Dignity of your Answers and we may justly hope that his Eloquence will add a considerable Weight and Advantage to Our Petitions If Goodwill has an Influence in reconciling Refentments Authority a great Force in  moderating Disputes whom we could rather wish to be a Judge in our Debates than one whose gentle Disposition renders him so popular that he may justly hope by the Sweetness of his Temper to allure all who have any share of Goodness or Humanity to the Study of Peace and Unity one whose Gravity is so free from Arrogance that should any Commotions happen to arise among us the very Dignity of his Presence must immediately suppress them Little therefore most  Sacred Fathers  had the Clergy answered your Expectations had they placed this weighty Burthen on any weaker Shoulders and at the same time they had proved themselves ungrateful and forgetful of the greatest Benefits had they not willingly offered any Honours that they could confer to one who had so highly deserved of them He certainly may rightfully claim the first Place in our SYNOD who by Divine Incitement strenuously endeavoured by Divine Favour happily effected this That SYNODS in this Nation are not altogether lost and dead nor intirely Speechless  Indulge me  Fathers  if I trace this matter something higher nothing shall I say to detract from your Dignity to which I bear the deepest and sincerest Veneration nothing to revive antient Differences to which I have the utmost Abhorrence  The Convention of the Bishops and Clergy had been now for some Years interrupted The Meetings of the States in Parliament for the Management of the Affairs of the  Commonwealth  were frequent all this time there were no Meetings of the  Bishops  and  their Clergy  for the Promotion of the Good of the Church I don't say I don't think that this was done with an evil Intent nay I am apt to believe that it proceeded from an Affection to the Church from a pious Fear of Differences and an ardent Desire for the Preservation of Peace But however many Persons who neither wanted Honesty nor Foresight thought that this Intermission of Convocations would one time or other prove of the greatest Disadvantage to the Church They were under great Apprehensions that what they knew was begun by the best of Princes and with the best Advice might by a worse  Prince  who had worse Designs be turned to the Destruction of the  Church  In the mean time many new monstrous Doctrines are daily Published many Heresies diffuse their poisonous Principles with Impunity Reproaches and Blasphemies shameful to utter and horrible to hear are freely vented against the Priesthood against things Sacred and the most Holy Name of GOD himself The  Authority of a Convocation had formerly given a proper and present Antidote against these Plagues All good Men implore this Assistance without this they think we must utterly despair of preserving and defending Religion in these Nations  Such was the State of Affairs when this very Learned  Person  thought it proper to place  The Rights Powers and Privileges of an English Convocation  The Title of Dr Atterbury's Book in Answer to Dr  Wake  's  State of the Church and Clergy of  England  fol    in an open and true Light and to strengthen them with all the Force they could receive from Laws and Custom With this View he searches carefully into the Antient Monuments of the Church then covered with Dust and obscurity rightly thinking that the Manner and Method of Convening the Rules and Laws of holding  Convocations  was not to be drawn from the modern Discourses of Men nor from the Memory of us or our Fathers but from the Commentaries of the Antients the Edicts of Kings and the Registers of Popes For this purpose he got into his Possession with great Labour and Cost many loose and scatter'd Manuscripts almost obliterated by Time which he carefully  read again and again By the Assistance of these he first ventured to tread a Way involved with Darkness covered with Thorns and perplexed with Intricacies without any Guide to conduct him without any Footsteps of former Travellers to direct him But he relying on the Strength and Powers of his Genius and inflamed with the Zeal for the Discovery of Truth unwound all these Mazes however difficult and perplexed Things in themselves obscure he brighten'd the doubtful reduced to Certainty and polished the unornamental He by drawing away the Veil exhibited to publick View and Admiration the antient Face of the  Church  In his Writings we with Joy behold her very Picture drawn in proper Colours and exactly agreeable to the true Features and Lineaments of the Original and how will that Joy and Veneration be increased when we shall view the Matron herself before us reviv'd as it were from the Dead breathing speaking Much should I injure one endeared to me by the strictest Rules of Friendship much esteemed from frequent Trials of his Integrity if I did not believe his frequent and solemn Asseverations that he did not engage in this Great Work out of any Desire of Innovations any private Resentments or meaner Views  of Interest but merely for the Good and Advantage of the  Church  Neither should I act the human faithful or just Part did I not endeavour to fix in the Minds of others that Character and Opinion of Him which is intirely rooted in my own and which I did not rashly take up from slight Conjectures but from an intimare Acquaintance and long Experience This Recommendation would be too invidious and more uneasy to Him than any one besides should I say that he never err'd never was mistaken in so long a Work never let some Words in the Heat of his Pen pass from him which he would not willingly have recalled upon cooler Reflections Should I say that he has not often nor grosly err'd nor willingly drawn others into Mistakes should I positively assert that there are many Things in these Writings that merit the highest Praise few that want any Allowances of Excuse none but what Men of Humanity might easily pardon I should in that utter my own Opinion and if I am not deceived by too great a Fondness of Friendship the Opinion of all impartial Judges too Be there then room left for Pardon for Praise for Gratitude If some sharp warm or free Expressions have escaped him a Reader of any Humanity will not attribute  them to Envy Resentment or Arrogance but to a Temper of itself too warm or perhaps to Passion easily pardonable in a Soldier who contended for all that is dear to Us in a Son endeavouring to rescue his Mother from Injury and Violence But if there is an Overballance of Beauties in his Writings if he has treated of things in themselves difficult useful pleasing if he has confirmed them by the strongest Arguments if he has imprinted them in the Minds of the Readers by a Purity and Perspicuity of Stile it is fit that he receive the Applause due to Learning from Men of Letters from the Eloquent the Honour due to Eloquence If he has bravely asserted the Privileges and Liberties of CONVOCATIONS at the Hazard of his own Fortune if he has preferr'd the publick Advantage to his private Interest let the CLERGY make some Returns at least to the Assertor of  The Rights of the Clergy  May this Man of equal Penetration and Diligence in the Management of Business receive this most proper Reward of his Services the Opportunity of acting in a larger Sphere where he may exert all his Powers of Arts and Genius in contriving promoting and confirming  the Peace of the Church  WITH what Applause has he often Preached before the People the Magistrates  the Clergy the Senate and the Court How often has the late Queen MARY now gathered to the Saints above been charmed with his Eloquence And what Address did he use in tempering the Soul of her  Sister  who still survives and by the Blessing of Heaven may she long do so when she was almost oppressed and overcome by her late Affliction  The Death of Prince GEORGE  As he has long supported with Dignity the different and distinct Offices of a Preacher Canon ArchDeacon and Dean so may he with the same Virtues the same Eloquence the same universal Approbation adorn this Chair as PROLOCUTOR who will if I prophecy right some time or other adorn one in a greater and more honourable Station  The present Sate of Affairs certainly promises Us every thing that is likely to redound to the Advantage and Glory of  The Church  of  England  from the Inclination of the People the Zeal of the Ministry the Piety of the best of QUEENS and the closest Agreement between the Civil and Ecclesiastical Powers There ever was a near Affinity between the  House of Commons  and the  Lower House of Convocation  a Resemblance such as is usual between  Sisters with some diversity But from this Time there will be a nearer Relation between them while  Mr  Bromley  and Dr  Atterbury  both of  ChristChurch Oxon  Two Persons educated together in the same College ever fruitful of the best Sciences under the same  Bishop  Fell  Prelate of blessed Memory happily instructed in the same Principles preside over these different Assemblies both of them of tried fixed unshaken Fidelity to their  Prince  their  Country  and their  Church  who both make us hope Great Things and who will still perform Greater The One a strenuous Assertor of the best constituted and happily tempered  Government  the Other of its  Church  He certainly was a proper Person for a SENATE to make choice of to preside over them that bore the deepest Veneration for their QUEEN and one fit to be confirmed by the Authority of a QUEEN who had the tenderest Affection for her People Neither is This Person unworthy to be recommended to you FATHERS by a  Clergy  most Dutiful and Respectful to the  Episcopal Order  nor undeserving that Approbation which you  Venerable Fathers  out of your tender Affection to that CLERGY shall vouchsafe to their Election  ORATION  Nova  PHILOSOPHIA  Veteri  praeferenda est  Vid THEATRI  Oxoniensis

Ʋniversity  how long shall we slavishly tread in the Steps of the Antients and be afraid of being wiser than our Ancestors How long shall we religiously worship the Triflings of Antiquity as some do Old Wives Stories It is indeed shameful when we survey the great Ornament of the present Age  Sir  Isaac Newton  to transfer our Applauses to the Ancients and to take Pains to search into Ages past for Persons deserving of Panegyric  The antient Philosophy has had more allowed than it could resonably pretend to How often has SHELDON's Theatre rung with Encomia on the  Stagyrite  Who greater than his own  Alexander  has long unopposed triumphed in our SchoolDesks and had the whole World for his Pupils At length arose CARTESIUS a happier Genius who has bravely asserted the Truth against the united Force of all Opposers and has brought on the Stage a new Method of Philosophizing But shall we stigmatize with the Name of Novelty that Philosophy which tho' but lately revived is more antient than the  Peripatetic  and as Old as the Matter from whence it is derived A great Man indeed He was and the only one we envy FRANCE He solved the Difficulties of the Universe almost as well as if he had been its Architect He destroyed those Orbs of Glass which the Whims of Antiquity had fixed above brought to light that Troop of Forms till then unknown and has almost extinguished the Element of Fire nay he with so much Clearness traced out the whole Mass of Matter as to leave no Occult Quality untouched This Philosopher scorned to be any longer bounded within the Streights and Chrystalline Walls of an  Aristotelic  World No his Delight is to  search the Regions above to discover new Suns and new Worlds which lay hid amongst the Stars his Satisfaction is to view that large Kingdom of Air amidst the unfixed Stars and Lands that pass the MilkyWay and more accurately measure this vast Machine a Machine fit for Mankind to philosophize on and worthy of the Deity who first framed it  Here we have not only New Heavens opened to us but we look down on our Earth this Philosophy affords us several Kinds of Animals where by the Help of the Microscope our Eyes are so far assisted that we may discern the Productions of the smallest Creatures while we consider with a curious Eye the animated Particles of Matter and behold with Astonishment the reptile Mountains of living Atoms Thus are our Eyes become more penetrating by modern Helps and even that Work which Nature boasts for her MasterPiece is rendered more correct and finished We no longer pay a blind Veneration to that barbarous  Peripatetic  Jingle those obscure Scholastic Terms of Art once held as Oracles but consult the Dictates of our own Senses and by late invented Engines force Nature herself to discover plainly her most valued Secrets her most hidden Recesses  By the Help of Instruments like these that Air which a bountiful Nature has indulged us we as often as we please by the Force of Art abridge other Animals of and keep them in our Pneumatick Pumps from its common Benefit What a Pleasure is it to see the fruitless Heavings of the Lights to exhaust their Lives and by a most artful Sort of Theft rob them of their Breath From this nothing is safe nothing so long lived which gradually does not languish and fall dead without a Wound A divine Piece of Art this and worthy its Author  The Honourable  Robert Boyle  Esq  who in the Conduct of his Life and the Force of his Arguments has so nobly honoured our Nation and the new Philosophy one who for this Reason too deserves never to want the Benefit of his own Air or that he who has so often deprived other Animals of their Life should ever breathe out his own  On no such Grounds as these has ARISTOTLE built his Philosophy who from his own Brain furnished out all his Rules of Arts and Sciences and left nothing untouched on nothing unregarded but  Truth  If therefore he precipitated himself into the River  Euripus  because he could not understand its Ebb and Flow by the same  Logick he might at his first Entrance on Philosophy have destroyed himself and we may fairly doubt in which of the Elements he ought to have perished  After ARISTOTLE's Fate amidst the Waves of  Euripus  a new Race of  Peripateticks  started up even worse than their Founder who handed their Philosophy to AfterAges in so thick an Obscurity that it has preserved it from the Satire and Ridicule of all Mankind as understood by very few Some there are to be found who spend their Time amidst the Rubbish which these Commentators have filled the World with and pore more than once on these godlike Treasures of Learning and stick to them to no other Purpose unless to shew the World the vast Pains they take to be deceived Can there be a more pleasant Sight than to see these wise Champions wrangling with each other The one armed with Propositions and Syllogisms attacks his Antagonist in the same Armour Both Bellweathers grow angry and storm fond of a Victory which is worth but a Trifle when obtained Each with all his Might darts out his Barbarisms at the other they entangle themselves in their Follies and as neither knows how to extricate himself they sound to a Retreat and when all the  Ammunition is spent on both Sides they think fit to keep Silence  Thus far  Gentlemen  and no farther launches out the antient Philosophy Let us therefore sentence for ever this Troop of Commentators to be tied up in Chains and Libraries Food only for Moths and Worms and there let them quietly grow Old free from the Sight of any Reader  Joseph Addison  A CHARACTER OF Mr  Edmund Curll  Bookseller  By Mr POPE  Before the Lords  Alone untaught to fear  Stood dauntless CURLL  and spoke to ev'ry Peer  He triumph'd Victor of the high wrought Day  DUNCIAD  _WE come now to a  Character  of much  Respect  Equal in Family Birth Education and  Respect  to Mr  Alexander Pope  that of Mr EDMUND CURLL As a plain Repetition of great Actions is the best Praise of them we shall only say of this eminent Man that he carried his Trade many Lengths beyond what it ever  before had arrived at  This Truth is agreed to by all who know Mr  Curll  and if he has  carried  the  Art  of  Bookselling  beyond all his Cotemporaries has not Mr  Pope  done the same by the  Art  of  Poetry  Mr  Dryden  had neither  Chariot  nor  Barge  of which Mr  Pope  makes his Boast but tells us he was  Unprofitably kept at Heav'ns Expence  And liv'd a RentCharge on its Providence  and that he was the Envy and Admiration of all his Profession  In this Instance also do the  Characters  of Mr  Curll  and Mr  Pope  exactly Tally  He possessed himself of a Command over all Authors whatever he caused them to write what he pleased  So will every Body who pays for what he bespeaks  they could not call their  very Names  their own  Mr  Pope  has often denied his own  very Name  and wrote under those of  Barnivelt  Dr  Norris  c  He was not only famous among these He was taken Notice of by the State the Church and the Law and received particular Marks of Distinction from each  These Favours Mr  Curll  has  enjoyed  and Mr  Pope  can only  expect  them in  Reversion  It will be owned that he is here  ie  in the  Dunciad  introduced with all possible  Dignity  And in Return Mr  Curll  in his Dedication of the SECOND VOLUME of  Literary Correspondence  has introduced Mr  Pope  with all possible  Ignominy  He speaks like the intrepid  Diomed  he runs like the swiftfooted  Achilles  if he falls it is like the beloved  Nisus  and what  Homer  makes to be the Chief of all Praises he is favoured of the Gods He says but three Words and his Prayer is heard  Homer  THERSITES sings and  Pope  a CURLL  a Goddess conveys it to the Seat of  Jupiter  tho' he loses the Prize he gains the Victory the great Mother herself comforts him she inspires him with Expedients she honours him with an immortal Present such as  Achilles  receives from  Thetis  and  Aeneas  from  Venus  at once instructive and prophetical After this he is unrivaled and triumphant  As to the Classical Mimicries herein alluded to I refer the Reader to that Colluvy or Sink of Scandal the  Dunciad  to encounter which would be like a Gentleman's boxing with a ChimneySweeper in the Habit of his Vocation  The Tribute our Author here pays him was a grateful Return for several unmerited Obligations Many weighty Animadversions on the Public Affairs and  many  excellent and diverting Pieces of private Persons had he given to his Name  This is false Mr  Pope  is defied to produce any  one  Instance of his Assertion  If ever he owed  two  Verses to any other he owed  Mr  Curll  some thousands  This Debt of Mr  Pope  's to Mr  Curll  acknowledged by  Scriblerus  will be discharged like those promised by Mr  Pope  in Advertisements by adding one  Falshood  to  another  CRYING came our Bard into the World but LYING it is greatly to be feared will he go out of it One Monument will suffice for the Remains of him and his Relatives  Ananias Saphyra Scriblerus  and  Will Cleland  He was every Day extending his Fame and enlarging his Writings Witness innumerable Instances but it shall suffice only to mention the  Court Poems  which he  How can Mr  Pope  tell what Mr  Curll meant  The Preface to the  Court Poems  only mentions the Public Voice that they were attributed to a  Lady  Mr  Gay  and Mr  Pope  but here  utrum horum  is left to every one's Choice Why does not Mr  Pope  name the true Writer  meant  to publish as the Work of the true Writer a  Lady of Quality  but being first  As to Mr  Pope  's first threatening and afterwards punishing Mr  Curll  it is our Opinion he has met with a  Rowland  for his  Oliver  Fas est vel ab hoste doceri  threatened and afterwards punished for it by Mr  Pope  he generously transferred it from  Her  to  Him  and has now printed it above  Eighteen  Years in his Name  And will continue so to do till Mr  Pope  thinks fit to tell the Truth Mr  Gay  has inserted  one  of them the  Toilette  among his Poems which is a full Detection of Mr  Pope  's Falshood in affirming that they were All of them the Performance of a  Lady of Quality  The single Time that ever he spoke to  Curll  was on that Affair and to that happy Incident  he owed all the Favours since received from him So true is the Saying of Dr  Sydenham  We allow the Verity of Dr  Sydenham  's Saying For Mr  Curll  has certainly been the better for Mr  Pope  's BAD Qualifications but not his GOOD ones   Probatum est  "That any One shall be at some Time or other the  better  or the  worse  for having but seen or spoken to a  good  or a  bad  Man"  Court Poems  to this Work are join'd  That All the World may see  Pope  's Falshoods

LETTER I  NB  The st d d th and th of these  LETTERS  are Translated  literally  from the  French  Originals  _MY Mistress and Friend I and my Heart put our selves in your Hands begging you to recommend us to your Favour and not to let Absence lessen your Affection to us For it were great Pity to increase our Pain which Absence alone does sufficiently and more than I could ever have thought bringing to my Mind a Point of Astronomy which is That the farther the  Moors  are from us the farther too is the Sun and yet his Heat is the more scorching so it is with our Love we are at a Distance from one another and yet it keeps its Fervency at least on my Side I hope the like on your Part assuring you that the Uneasiness of Absence is already too severe for me and  when I think of the Continuance of that which I must of Necessity suffer it would seem intolerable to me were it not for the firm Hope I have of your unchangeable Affection for me and now to put you sometimes in mind of it and seeing I cannot be present in Person with you I send you the nearest Thing to that possible that is my Picture set in Bracelets with the whole Device which you know already wishing my self in their Place when it shall please you This from the Hand of  Your Servant and Friend H Rex  LETTER II  To my MISTRESS  BECAUSE the Time seems to me very long since I have heard from you or concerning your Health the great Affection I have for you has obliged me to send this Bearer to be better informed both of your Health and Pleasure particularly because since my last parting with you I have been told that you have intirely changed the Opinion in which I left you and that you would neither come to Court with your Mother nor any other Way which Report if true I cannot enough wonder at  being persuaded in my own Mind that I have never committed any Offence against you and it seems a very small Return for the great Love I bear to you to be kept at a Distance from the Person and Presence of the Woman in the World that I value the most and if you love me with as much Affection as I hope you do I am sure the Distance of our Two Persons would be a little uneasy to you Tho' this does not belong so much to the Mistress as the Servant Consider well my Mistress how greatly your Absence grieves me I hope it is not your Will that it should be so but if I heard for certain that you your self desired it I could do no other than complain of my ill Fortune and by Degrees abate my great Folly And so for want of Time I make an End of my rude Letter desiring you to give Credit to this Bearer in all he will tell you from me Written by the Hand of your entire Servant  LETTER III  THE Uneasiness my Doubts about your Health gave me disturbed and frightned me extreamly and I should not have had any Quiet without hearing a certain Account But now since you have yet felt nothing I hope it is with you as with us  for when we were at  Walton  two Ushers two  Valets de Chambre  and your Brother Master Treasurer fell ill and are now quite well and since we are returned to your House at  Hundsdon  we have been perfectly well God be praised and have not at present one sick Person in the Family and I think if you would retire from the  Surrey  Side as we did you would escape all Danger There is another Thing that may comfort you which is that in Truth in this Distemper  The  SweatingSickness  few or no Women have been taken ill and besides no Person of our Court and few elsewhere have died of it For which Reasons I beg you my entirely beloved not to frighten your self nor to be too uneasy at our Absence For whereever I am I am yours and yet we must sometimes submit to our Misfortunes for whoever will struggle against Fate is generally but so much the farther from gaining his End Wherefore comfort your self and take Courage and make this Misfortune as easy to you as you can and I hope shortly to make you sing for Joy of your Recal No more at present for lack of Time but that I wish you in my Arms that I might a little dispel your unreasonable Thoughts Written by the Hand of him who is and always will be yours  My  H  Rex Lovely  LETTER IV  BY turning over in my Thoughts the Contents of your last Letters I have put my self into a great Agony not knowing how to understand them whether to my Disadvantage as I understood some others or not I beseech you now with the greatest Earnestness to let me know your whole Intention as to the Love between us two For I must of Necessity obtain this Answer of you having been above a whole Year struck with the Dart of Love and not yet sure whether I shall fail or find a Place in your Heart and Affection This Uncertainty has hindered me of late from naming you my Mistress since you only love me with an ordinary Affection but if you please to do the Duty of a True and Loyal Mistress and to give up your self Body and Heart to me who will be as I have been your most Loyal Servant if your Rigour does not forbid me I promise you that not only the Name shall be given you but also that I will take you for my Mistress casting off all others that are in Competition with you out of my Thoughts and Affection and serving you only I beg you to give an entire Answer to this my rude Letter that I may know on what and how far I may depend But if it does not please you to answer in Writing let me know some  Place where I may have it by Word of Mouth and I will go thither with all my Heart No more for fear of tiring you Written by the Hand of him who would willingly remain yours  H Rex  LETTER V  FOR a Present so valuable that nothing could be more considering the Whole of it I return you my most hearty Thanks not only on account of the costly Diamond and the Ship in which the solitary Damsel is tossed about but chiefly for the fine Interpretation and too humble Submission which your Goodness hath made to me For I think it would be very difficult for me to find an Occasion to deserve it if I was not assisted by your great Humanity and Favour which I have sought do seek and will always seek to preserve by all the Services in my Power and this is my firm Intention and Hope according to the Motto  Aut illic aut nullibi  Either Here or Nowhere  The Demonstrations of your Affection are such the fine Thoughts of your Letter so cordially expressed that they oblige me for ever to honour love and serve you sincerely beseeching you to continue in the same firm and constant Purpose  and assuring you that on my Part I will not only make you a suitable Return but outdo you in Loyalty of Heart if it be possible I desire you also that if at any Time before this I have in any Sort offended you you will give me the same Absolution which you ask assuring you That hereafter my Heart shall be dedicated to you alone I wish my Body were so too God can do it if he pleases to whom I pray once a Day for that End hoping that at length my Prayers will be heard I wish the Time may be short but I shall think it long till we shall see one another Written by the Hand of the Secretary who in Heart Body and Will is  Your Loyal and most Assured Servant  H  no other Heart  AB  seeks  Rex  LETTER VI  Original  THE Reasonable Requests of your last Letter with the Pleasure I also take to know them causes me to send you now this Newes The Legat  Campegio  which we most desire arrived at  Paris  on  Sunday  or  Monday  last past so that I trust by the next  Monday  to hear of his Arrival at  Calais  And then  I trust within a While after to enjoy that which I have so long longed for to God's Pleasure and both our Comforts No more to you at this present mine awne Darling for lake of Time but that I would you were in myne Arms or I in yours for I think it long since I kyst you Writen after the killing of an Hart at xi of the Clock Minding with God's Grace tomorrow mightily tymely to kill another by the Hand of him which I trust shortly shall be yours  Henry Rex  LETTER VII  Original  DArling tho' I have skant Leasure yet remembring my Promise I thought it convenient to certifie you breevly in what Case our Affaires stand As touching a Lodging for you we have gotten wone by my Lord Cardinal's Means the like whereof could not have been fond hereabouts for all Causes as this Bearer shall more shew yow As touching our other Affairs I ensure you there can be no more done nor more Diligence used nor all manner of Dangers better both foreseen and provided for so that I trust it shall be hereafter to both our Comforts the Speciallities whereof were both too long to be writen and hardly by Messenger to be declared Wherefor till you repaire hydder I  keep something in Store trusting it shall not be long too For I have caused my Lord your Father to make his Provisions with Speed And thus for lake of Tyme Darling I make an end of my Letter writen with the Hand of him which I would were yours  H Rex  LETTER VIII  Out of  French  ALTHO' it doth not belong to a Gentleman to take his Lady in the Place of a Servant however in following your Desires I willingly grant it that so you may be more agreeably in the Place that you yourself have chosen than you have been in that which I gave you I shall be heartily obliged to you if you please to have some Remembrance of me N R de R O M V E Z  Henry Rex  LETTER IX  Original  THE Cause of my Writeing at this time good Sweatheart is wonly to understand off your good Health and Prosperity whereof to know I would be as glad as in manner myne awne praying God that and it be his Pleasure to send us shortly togyder for I promise you I long for it howbeit  trust it shall not be long too and seeing my Darling is absent I can no less do than to send her some Fleshe representing my Name which is Hart'sFleshe for  Henry  prognosticating that hereafter God willing you must enjoy some of mine which if he pleased I wolde were now As touching your Sister's Matter I have caused  Walter Welche  to write to my Lord mine Minde therein whereby I trust that  Eve  shall not have Power to deceive  Adam  For surely whatsoever is said it cannot so stand with his Honour but that he must needs take her his natural Daughter now in her extreame Necessity No more to you at this tyme mine awne Darling but that with a Wishe I wolde we were togyder one Evening with the Hand of your  H Rex  LETTER X  Out of  French  ALthough My Mistress you have not been pleased to remember the Promise which you made me when I was last with you which was That I should hear News of you and have an Answer to my last Letter yet I think it belongs to a true Servant since otherwise he can know nothing to send to enquire of his Mistress's Health and to acquit my self of the Office of a True Servant I send you this Letter begging you  to give me an Account of the State you are in which I pray God may continue as long in Prosperity as I wish my own and that you may the oftner remember me I send you by this Bearer a Buck killed late last Night by my Hand hoping when you eat of it you will think on the Hunter and thus for want of more Room I will make an End of my Letter Written by the Hand of your Servant who often wishes you in your Brother's Room  H Rex  LETTER XI  Out of  French  THE Approach of the Time which I have so long expected rejoices me so much that it seems almost already come However the intire Accomplishment cannot be till the two Persons meet which Meeting is more desired by me than any Thing in this World for what Joy can be greater upon Earth than to have the Company of her who is my dearest Friend knowing likewise that she does the same on her Part the Thinking on which gives great Pleasure You may judge what an Effect the Presence of that Person must have on me whose Absence has made a greater Wound in my Heart than either Words or Writing can express and which nothing can Cure but her Return I  beg you dear Mistress to tell your Father from me That I desire him to hasten the Appointment by two Days that he may be in Court before the Old Term or at farthest on the Day prefixed for otherwise I shall think he will not do the Lover's Turn as he said he would nor answer my Expectation No more at present for want of Time hoping shortly that by Word of Mouth I shall tell you the rest of my Sufferings from your Absence Written by the Hand of the Secretary who wishes himself at present privately with you and who is and always will be  Your Loyal and most Assured Servant  H  no other Heart  AB  seeks  Rex  LETTER XII  Out of  French  THERE came to me in the Night the most afflicting News possible For I have reason to grieve upon three Accounts  First  Because I heard of the Sickness of my Mistress whom I esteem more than all the World whose Health I desire as much as my own and the Half of whose Sickness I would willingly bear to have her cured  Secondly  Because I fear I shall suffer yet longer that tedious Absence which has hitherto given me all possible Uneasiness and as far as I can judge is like to give me more I pray God he would deliver me from so troublesome a Tormentor  The Third Reason is  because the Physician in whom I trust most is absent at present when he could do me the greatest Pleasure For I should hope by him and his Means to obtain one of my principal Joys in this World that is my Mistress cured however in Default of him I send you the second and the only one left praying God that he may soon make you well and then I shall love him more than ever I beseech you to be governed by his Advice with relation to your Illness by your doing which I hope shortly to see you again which will be to me a greater Cordial than all the precious Stones in the World Written by the Secretary who is and always will be  Your Loyal and most Assured Servant  H

Servant of the Lord  Broke  that was and that not long ago Wherefor I would not for all the Gold in the World clog your Conscience nor mine to make her Ruler of a House which is of so ungodly Demeanour nor I trust you would not that neither for Brother nor Sister I should so destain mine Honour or Conscience And as touching the Pryoresse or Dame  Ellenor  's Eldest Sister tho' there is not any evident Case proved against them and that the Pryoresse is so Old that of many Years she could not be as she was named yet notwithstanding to do you Pleasure I have don that neither of them shall have it but that some other good and welldisposed Woman shall have it Whereby the House shall be the better reformed whereof  I ensure you it had much need and God much the better served As touching

Ease and more Quietnesse to my Minde than any other Thing in this World as with God's Grace shortly I trust shall be proved but not so soon as I would it were yet I will ensure you there shall be no

as I am most bound to pray for I do know the great Pains and Troubles that you have taken for me both Day and Night is never like to be recompenced on my Part but alonely in loving you next unto the King's Grace above all Creatures living And I do not doubt but the daily Proofs of my Deeds shall manifestly declare and affirm my Writing to be true and I do trust you do think the same My Lord I do assure you I do long to hear from you News of the Legate for I do hope an they come from you they shall be very good and I am sure you desire it as much as I and more an it were possible as I know it is not And thus remaining in a stedfast Hope I make an  End of my Letter written with the Hand of her that is most bound to be  Your Humble Servant Anne Boleyn  Postscript  by the KING  THE Writer of this Letter would not cease till she had caused me likewise to set to my Hand desiring you though it be short to take it in good Part I ensure you there is neither of us but that greatly desireth to see you and much more joyous to hear that you have scaped this Plague so well trusting the Fury thereof to be passed specially with them that keepeth good Diet as I trust you do The not hearing of the

Obedient Servant Anne Boleyn  Anne Boleyn's  Last  LETTER  to King  HENRY  See  Hist  of  Reform p    Vol  I This Letter was written after her Marriage with the King  SIR  YOUR Grace's Displeasure and my Imprisonment are Things so strange unto me as what to Write or to what to Excuse I am altogether ignorant Whereas you send unto me willing me to confess a Truth and so obtain your Favour by such an one whom you know to be mine antient professed Enemy I no sooner received this Message by him than I rightly conceived your Meaning and if as you say confessing a Truth indeed may procure my Safety I shall with all Willingness and Duty perform your Command  But let not your Grace ever imagine that your poor Wife will ever be brought to acknowledge a Fault where not so much as a Thought thereof preceded And to speak a Truth never Prince had Wife more Loyal in all Duty and in all true Affection than you have ever found in  Anne Boleyn  with which Name and Place I could willingly have contented  my self if God and your Grace's Pleasure had been so pleased Neither did I at any Time so far forget my self in my Exaltation or received Queenship but that I always looked for such an Alteration as now I find for the Ground of my Preferment being on no surer Foundation than you Grace's Fancy the least Alteration I knew was fit and sufficient to draw that Fancy to some other Subject You have chosen me from a low Estate to be your Queen and Companion far beyond my Desert or Desire If then you found me worthy of such Honour Good your Grace let not any light Fancy or bad Councel of mine Enemies withdraw your Princely Favour from me neither let that Stain that unworthy Stain of a Disloyal Heart towards your good Grace ever cast so soul a Blot on your most Dutiful Wife and the Infant Princess your Daughter Try me good King but let me have a Lawful Trial and let not my sworn Enemies sit as my Accusers and Judges yea let me receive an open Trial for my Truth shall fear no open Shame then shall you see either mine Innocency cleared your Suspicion and Conscience satisfied the Ignominy and Slander of the World stopped or my Guilt openly declared So that whatsoever God or You may determine of me your Grace may be freed from an open Censure and mine Offences being so lawfully proved your Grace is at  liberty both before God and Man not only to execute worthy Punishment on me as an unlawful Wife but to follow your Affection already settled on that Party for whose Sake I am now as I am whose Name I could some good While since have pointed unto Your Grace being not ignorant of my Suspicion therein  But if you have already determined of me and that not only my Death but an infamous Slander must bring you the enjoying of your desired Happiness then I desire of God that he will pardon your great Sin therein and likewise mine Enemies the Instruments thereof and that he will not call you to a strict Account for your unprincely and cruel Usage of me at his General JudgmentSeat where both You and Myself must shortly appear and in whose Judgment I doubt not whatsoever the World may think of me mine Innocence shall be openly known and sufficiently cleared  My last and only Request shall be That my self may only bear the Burthen of your Grace's Displeasure and that it may not touch the innocent Souls of those poor Gentlemen who as I understand are likewise in strait Imprisonment for my Sake If ever I have found Favour in your Sight if ever the Name of  Anne Boleyn  hath been pleasing in your Ears then let me obtain this Request and I will so leave to trouble your Grace  any longer with mine earnest Prayers to the Trinity to have your Grace in his good Keeping and to direct you in all your Actions From my doleful Prison in the  Tower  this th of  May  Your most Loyal and ever Faithful Wife Anne Boleyn  To Mr POPE  SIR  THE ORIGINALS of the foregoing LETTERS are in the  Vatican  Library at  Rome  where they are shewn as one of their greatest Curiosities  In the Year Dr FALL then Precentor of  York  took a Copy of Them from whence they are here exactly printed  The Cause and Occasion of the KING's Amour with  Anne Boleyn  may be fully seen in Bishop BURNET's  History  of the  Reformation  These  Letters  must in all Probability have been written immediately after the Lady's Dismission from Court which was done in so abrupt a Manner that she determined never more to return This made the King soon repent of his Severity towards  her and most earnestly press her to come back But his Majesty could not for a considerable Time nor without great Difficulty bring this about as appears by several Passages herein  The Time of her  Dismission  was in  May    In the  First  LETTER the  King  makes Excuses for the Necessity of their being asunder And in the  Second  complains of her Unwillingness to return to Court There is not in either of them the least mention of the  SweatingSickness  which raged violently in  June  and of which he speaks in his  Third Letter  adding that he had made many Observations from Experience Between this Letter which seems to have been written in  July  and the  Sixth  which mentions the Legate's Arrival at  Paris  must have been written in the Close of  September  and there are  Two  which by the Earnestness of the Business were plainly written within few Days one of another In the  Last  the King expresses  how much He is pleased with her Answer to his earnest Request made in the  First In the  Heat  of his  Royal Gratitude  he pays a Visit to his  Mistress  and They jointly wrote a Letter to Cardinal  Wolsey  wherein the  King  greatly admires at his not hearing of  Campegio  's Arrival He did not stay long with her after this for when  she had received  Wolsey  's Answer  She  wrote the Cardinal a  Second  Letter without any mention of the  King  expressing her  own  Impatience to hear of the Legate's comming of which his  Majesty  sent her the News soon after But to return to the  Fourth  LETTER which must in all Probability have been written in  August  it is the most important in all the Collection for it fixeth the exact Time of the Rise of his  Majesty's  Affection to this  Lady  He pathetically complaineth therein that  He had been above a whole Year struck with the Dart of Love and was not yet sure whether He should fail or find a Place in her Heart and Affection  He farther addeth that  long before  She  suspected  it  from his  first  seeing Her he felt a Passion for  Her  It cannot be doubted by any who read these  Letters  that King HENRY's Affection to  Anne Boleyn  was altogether upon honourable Terms There appears not the least Pretension to the  LastFavour  nor Aim towards it till the  Holy Legate  and  Mother Church  had paved the Way to Consummation and then  He Monsieur  Pope  Entendez vous bien    The  Last  of these  Letters  mentions the  Legate's  Illness as a Reason why he had not performed the Duties of his Function which makes it apparent that this  Royal Love Correspondence  ended in  May    when the Process began making up just one Year  You see Sir how readily I lay hold of every Opportunity to oblige you The  NewYear's  Gift I sent you was from  Paris  The  NewYear'sGift  I sent by a Special Messenger to Mr  Pope  at  Twickenham  was a little Book neaty Bound in  Red Turky  Leather Ruled and the Capital Letters illuminated with Gold and various Colours intitled "HEURES des PRIERRES Dedie à Madame la Duchesse de CHARTRES Avec les Sept Pseaumes Penitentieux à Paris " This Manual was likewise illustrated with  Four  beautiful Prints  One  in particular representing  David  prostrate in which Part of the Book upon a Label was wrote the following Lines  As Friends who of a Criminal take Leave  Pray the Almighty may his Soul receive  So I these Penitential Psalms have sent  Hoping like  David  you'll at length repent  One good Effect I find they have produced for you have recanted and razed out this  Distich  against the  Dutch  Then  first  the  Belgian  Morals were extoll'd  We their  Religion  had and they our Gold  Ess on Crit  You now say as these Lines  contain a National Reflection in your stricter Judgment  it is what you  cannot but disapprove on any People whatever  Were you not as sensible that this was a  National Reflection  when you wrote it as it is now  and this immaculate Intercourse of  Royal Affection  comes from  Rome  So that not in the least doubting but you will give an equal Reception to both Presents I now do and ever shall with the like Sincerity remain  Your humble Servant E CURLL  March  TO Sir BERKELEY LUCY Bart  SIR  IN farther Justice to the Memory of Mr  Collins  as well as to obviate some misrepresentations which have been

Behaviour of Mr  Collins  was conformable to the whole Tenour of his  Life  Herein is also detected a most notorious  Falshood  propagated with great Diligence throughout  the Town by some of the  Sucking Priesthood  That Mr  Collins  had  given  all his  Manuscripts  to Mr  DesMaizeaux  and That this Gentleman had been  corrupted  to  destroy  them  The  Article  relating to our dear Friend in  The Gen Hist and Crit Dict  contains a tolerable Account of his  Writings  but the silly Sarcasms spleneticly levelled against his Character That  he lent several Persons Books and directed them how to confute Himself  are to the last Degree contemptible  For ever will His  Light shine among Men  whilst to the latest Posterity the  Understandings  of his petulant  Antagonists  will be looked upon

All that I have to add is only a Word or two concerning their  Author  Upon Reading them over at St  James  's  CoffeeHouse  they were attributed by the General Voice to be the Productions of a  Lady of Quality  When I produced them at  Button  's the  Poetical Jury  there brought in a different Verdict and the  Foreman  strenuously insisted upon it that Mr  Gay  was the  Man  and declared that in Comparing the TOILETTE with that Gentleman's PASTORALS he found the  Stile  and  Turn of Thought  to be evidently the same  This is confirmed by Mr GAY's inserting this Piece in his Works  which confirmed him and his Brethren in the Sentence they had pronounced  Not content with these Two Decisions I was resolved to call in an Umpire and accordingly chose a Gentleman of distinguished Merit who lives not far from  Chelsea  Sir  Richard Blackmore  I sent him the Papers which he returned me the next Day with this Answer  SIR  Depend upon it these Lines could come from no other Hand than the  Laudable  Translator of  HOMER  Thus having impartially given the Sentiments of the  Town  I hope I may deserve Thanks for the Pains I have taken by endeavouring to find out the  Author  of these

to have received I most humbly beg Leave of Your GRACE to acknowledge my Gratitude hereby  The Favour I have to ask is that in the Perusal of these Letters Your GRACE will give Attention to the Truth they contain They were written to satisfy the Curiosity of an intimate Friend as the  French  Editor thus relates  viz  THE Public will doubtless says he be desirous to know by what Accident these  Letters  fell into my Hands and what induced me to publish them I do not question but many will be apt to blame my Temerity in daring to expose the  Foible  of so powerful a Nation To these Criticks I shall only answer that the Interest of all the rest of  Europe  has with me taken Place of every other Consideration Besides our Author says no more than the bare evident Truth And for my Part I shall think my Labour more than recompenc'd if the reading of these Letters may have the wish'dfor Effect to deter every Man of Worth from travelling into  Muscovy  where he would run the Risk of being exposed to the same Tragical Events our  Italian  here relates  It was by a very extraordinary Accident no less than that of a Shipwreck that these Letters fell into my Hands The Author of them was reserved for this new Misfortune which in all Probability was the last of his Life We may presume he did not survive this fatal Event and may therefore properly apply the following Words to his Case  Fortuna libera mors est  This Misfortune perhaps befell him in the Voyage which towards the Conclusion of his  last  Letter he says he was just upon the Point of undertaking But it is not very material when and where it happened Let it suffice that a Trunk which drove on Shoar falling into my Hands I observed a Paper pasted in the  Inside of the Lid which contained the following Inscription  Durae ac dirae Captivitatis  Apud barbaros  Muscovitas  satis fortit toleratae  Sarcinae  Successoribus servatae ac relictae  Cum monitu  Ne adeant ad istam inbumanam Nationem  Nisi farro igne eam depopulandam  Sed si talis non datur facultas  Saltem sequentes preces quotidie  Ex toto corde effundant  In MUSCOVITAS coelestia templa ruinent  Terraque se pedibus raptim subducat omnes  Inter per mistas Terrae Coelique ruinas  Corpora solventes abeant per inane profundum  Temporis stet puncto nibil extet reliquiarum  Desertum praeter spatium primordia caeca  The last four Lines of this Inscription are from  Lucretius  This Inscription excited my Curiosity and examining the Trunk in which I at first only saw some old Cloaths I discovered a Bundle of Papers which put a Stop to my Enquiry for the present I found them to be Letters but the Hand they were written in was almost illegible from whence I concluded they had been wrote in a great Hurry I made a Shift to read them tho' not without a great deal of Pains and was sensibly moved with the Author's Misfortunes I was before partly acquainted with what he writes of the  MUSCOVITE Government  their  Power Finances  and  Ministry  But I was an entire Stranger to all the rest and not a little surprized  to find that the Pains  PETER  I had taken to civilize this Nation were hitherto fruitless  It is astonishing that notwithstanding all which has been done for above a Century to bring these People off from their native Barbarity they to this Day retain the same Savage Customs and Manners as will appear from these Letters  What Idea then must we not form of the  Foreigners  who are at the Head of the Administration in that Country and who in the most flagrant Manner abused the Confidence reposed in them by the best of PRINCESSES Must they of Necessity as soon as they set Foot in the  Russian  Dominions become very  Muscovites  I was not entirely ignorant before of the Conduct of these Ministers But I could never have believed them capable of carrying Matters this Length I am assured from very good Hands that their whole Aim was to fill their own Coffers that they might be able to screen themselves against every suture Event and they are probably so far right For without any great Skill in Astrology I would venture to presage what will be their Fate whenever the Empress who is now their Support comes to die In the mean Time let them think their Measures ever so secure I very much question whether they will escape the Storm they are threatned with if every the Illustrious PRINCESS who has an incontestable Right to that Crown acceed to the Throne  The Manner in which she is treated by these Ministers cries aloud for Vengeance For instead of respecting her as the presumptive Heir  of a vast Empire They do not so much as allow her where withal to support her Dignity and to maintain her antient Domesticks who chuse rather to linger on in Misery than to quit her Service They have even the Cruelty to keep her in a Sort of Bondage which deters every one from making their Court to her and is the Occasion of her being abandoned by the whole World This is no Secret to those who travel into that Country and when they return they speak of it with the utmost Indignation But at the same Time they are too well acquainted with the excellent Qualities and Clemency of the present Empress to lay any Part of the Blame on her  The  Foreign Ministry  are the Authors of all this Evil and as they are not insensible how ill they have deserved there is Reason to believe they will employ all their Skill to keep the next Heir from the Throne However notwithstanding their utmost Efforts I very much doubt of their Success They are indeed at present absolute Masters and dispose of every Thing at their own Will But they may probably be divested of this Authority which they now abuse with Impunity whenever a Matter of that Importance in which all the Powers of  Europe  ought to concern themselves is brought upon the Carpet  The very same Reasons which necessarily prompt this  Foreign Ministry  to aim at the  Exclusion  of the PRINCESS will of course engage the Native  Muscovites  to give her their  Suffrages  And if the  latter  gain their Point I do not doubt but the  former  will meet the Fate they  have deserved By this Means the  Muscovites  may shake off the heavy Yoke which they now bear and I dare answer for them they will not let so favourable an Opportunity escape In this Case these  Foreign Gentlemen  will find themselves in great Danger I advise them to be early upon their Guard and I hope they will make a right Use of the charitable Advice I give them I likewise hope they will not take it amiss that I print these Letters nor will complain of my Conduct with Regard to them They will I flatter myself thank me for the Regard I have shewn for them in following my Author who is so candid to conceal the Names of all his most inveterate Enemies and only to mention those of the Persons to whom he was obliged  As I am perfectly acquainted with all the Intrigues of the  Muscovite  Ministry it would be no difficult Thing for me to give an exact Description of those who are at the Head of the Affairs of that Kingdom But as well out of Prudence as Caution I shall be contented with what I have already said  As for the  Muscovites  I shall not need to make any Excuse on their Account They are not a People to take Pet at so small a Matter and they will themselves find that what is advanced with Respect to them is nothing in Comparison of what might be said against them  After having satisfied my Curiosity with Regard to these Letters I with Eagerness returned to the  Trunk  which contained them to  examine more narrowly what was yet behind I there saw the famous  NightGown  which the Author wore to be taken Notice of by the Empress and her whole Court when they passed under the Window of his Prison There were yet the same Sheep'sskinPelt and the same Cap which were of so much Service to him in his Journey from  Casan  to  Petersburg  The  Trunk  was filled with tattered Cloaths a few Shirts and other Necessaries Besides these I opened a  Hamper  in which were some Bottles Earthen Plates and Wooden Forks I likewise found an Iron Fork much larger than the others which probably the same our Author mentions in several Parts of his Letters and which he imagined he might have made an advantageous Use of as a Weapon in Case of Need There was even the very Axe by the Help of which he so dextrously opened his  Trunk  At Length I was agreeably surprized with a Roll of Paper which I at first Sight took for a Manuscript But after having unfolded it with a great deal of Impatience hoping to find some important Secret inclosed I was amazed to see only a few blank Leaves on which some few Characters were perceivable I soon apprehended these to be the Papers he mentions to have writ upon with his Silver Pencil without Ink and which after the Misfortune he met with of falling into a Pit in  Courland  were become illegible  After having carefully examined whatever was in the  Trunk  I acquainted several Friends with my Resolution of publishing these Letters But I found their Opinions very various I shall  therefore only mention some of the principal Reflections that were made on this Account  One of the Events which among others greatly surprized us was that of the Attempt which our Author endeavours to prove was made to Poison him We carefully examined his Allegations and found them all well grounded Let any Man judge with what Horror we considered so black and so detestable an Action  Having enquired into this important Point the next Thing we fell upon was his Attempt to discover the Original of the  Muscovites  As Novelty never fails of pleasing this Passage entertained us some Time and every one was allowed to give his Opinion freely At first none would decide upon the Matter for Fear of being deceived some said the Thought was ingenious but had no Foundation Others looked upon it as a Thing demonstrated beyond all Contradiction  While we were thus in Suspence what to determine one of the Company proposed to look upon the Author's Opinion as a mere Conjecture This every one approved of and thereby an End was soon put to this Dispute This Person added that if we would indulge him a Moment he would set us right in several Circumstances which our Author had not mentioned either because they had escaped his Memory or perhaps because he never had an Opportunity of being informed of them The whole Company having expressed an eager Desire of hearing what he had farther to propose he related a Fact of which we were all ignorant tho' the Truth of it is incontestable  viz  That the third Expedition of the  Scythians  into  Asia  is fixed by the most able Chronologists to  AM  which is just Years before the  ChristianAera  This being premised our Author might with Reason say that the  Muscovites  would be in the wrong to complain of the Original he ascribes to them for if it be not one of the most illustrious it is at least one of the most antient He acquainted us farther that the City which he calls the  City of Slaves  is now known by the Name of  Clopigorod  and is situated in the very Country thro' which these wretched People made their Retreat These Illustrations put us to reflect upon the Fact in Question not only as probable but as an evident Truth  While we proceeded in the Perusal of these  Letters  every one gave their Opinions and some made very judicious and curious Reflections But the reading of the  last  Letter made us almost forget all that had been said on the foregoing The single Circumstance of the  Pass  given to our Author fixed the Attention of the whole Company This Procedure of the  Muscovites  by which they exposed him to be looked upon as the most base and vilest of Men excited a general Indignation in us Every one exclai med against this Piece of flagrant Injustice and the  Muscovites  were treated as they deserved Who could blame us Can they say any Thing in Justification of themselves for sullying the Reputation of a  Man of Honour  without any Cause and brand him with the Character of a Spy in a strange Country Was it not enough that they had detained him so long in a grievous Captivity wherein they had subjected him to a thousand  Evils A Man of Worth would much rather chuse to dye than to suffer such a Blemish on his Reputation  Just as we were going to part a Gentleman asked if there was not any one amongst us inclinable to take a Voyage to  Muscovy  in Hopes of making his Fortune This Proposal surprized us all so much that we could not but turn it into Ridicule and soon replied in the Negative alledging that we should expect the same Fate which our Author had undergone This says he is the very Answer I expected For these  Letters  I must own are a sufficient Warning to all Strangers  Felix quem faciunt  c how they trust to  Muscovite  Integrity For which Reason the publishing of these will be a Public Benefit I replied that in Regard to the favourable Judgment they had formed of these Letters I should not hesitate but would forthwith print them but begged Leave to make one Observation which escaped their Notice  viz  That the  Muscovites  themselves and even their  Foreign Ministry  under whose Rule they are so far from having Reason to complain of the Publication of these  Letters  might be greatly benefitted by them and could not but be thankful to us for it For we all know that the  Muscovites  bear a mortal Hatred to the  Foreigners  who are at the Head of their Affairs and wish nothing more than to be rid of them On the other Hand it is no less certain that the  Foreigners  who find they have Power enough to support their Cabal use all the Skill they are Masters of to keep other  Foreigners  from getting a Footing in that Court It is therefore doing considerable Service to Both to publish these  Letters  Since  it is not to be imagined that those who read them will ever think of seeking an Employ in  Muscovy  By this Means the  Muscovites  will have no Reason to complain of Interlopers and the  Foreigners  who are now employed need not be apprehensive of losing their Places or being emulated by Rivals  This Observation was approved by all who were present but then another Difficulty was at the same Time started It was objected that these  Letters  being written by an  Italian  who perhaps had never any Thoughts of their being published it would be absolutely necessary to revise them and to correct the Stile To which it was judiciously answered That a Work like this which was written with no other Intent but that of obliging a Friend ought to be given to the Publick without any Alteration and it is hoped their intrinsick Worth will deserve that they should be translated into all the  European  Languages and may return to  Muscovy  and prove a  Speculum  to those of  other  Nations now resident there I do not in the least doubt but the  Italians  in particular would in Vindication of their Countryman be the first to put their Hands to the Plough and other Nations doubtless will soon follow their Example The  Germans  are principally concerned in this Matter because a great Number of their Countrymen go daily into  Muscovy  to  seek their Fortune  The Example of some  false Brethren  ought not to hinder them from concurring in a Matter from whence so much Good may result But if I should even be deceived in my Hopes I will never forsake so just a Cause during Life but resolutely maintain it  Ipsum potius Acheronta movebo  Here the  French  Editor concludes his Account of these LETTERS and I will not presume to detain Your GRACE any longer than begging Leave to subscribe myself  Your GRACE's Most Dutiful And Most Obedient Humble Servant WM  MUSCOVIAN LETTERS  LETTER I  SIR  _YOUR generous Behaviour towards Me may hereafter serve as an Example to all who make Profession of Friendship You had all the Reason in the World to believe me lost to you and for ever and yet this did not hinder you from doing for me whatever could be done by those who are in a Condition to give daily Proofs of their Affection one to the other This may be stiled Friendship even to the Dead Among the Number of whom you could not but account me since you had no News from me and nothing but Death could be supposed to prevent my Writing I am more than convinced of all the Effects you say my first Letter had upon you and you will be as fully persuaded of those which yours could produce in me We know each other too well to need any farther Explication on this Head  You say you cannot forbear looking upon me as a Person risen from the Dead and you are so  far right I am not dead indeed because  Mors miseros fugit  but I may nevertheless be esteemed a Ghost since I am actually returned from another World where I have made no short Abode I learn every Day something new and surprizing and that almost with the same Pleasure a deaf Man would who should at once recover the Organs of Hearing The earnest Desire you express of having a circumstantial Account of my Adventures looks as if you expected something extraordinary and wonderful and therein you are not mistaken Had the same Things happened to another I my self should have been backward in believing them  Triste petit munus  But should I refuse to satisfy your Curiosity it would be the first Time you ever asked me any thing in vain I shall not therefore hesitate a Moment and the less as a renewed Friendship requires more Assiduity than that which has never been broken Ours may well be said to be renewed since it is come back from the other World What terrifies me is that Accuracy of Relation which you require of me For I am scrupulous enough with you to endeavour strictly to obey you Had it not been for an unhappy Shipwreck which I suffered at a Time when I might have thought my self least liable to a Misfortune of that Nature I should perhaps have been able to fulfil your Desires Some Memoirs which I had written in a very peculiar Manner would have been of great Service to my History But they are not at all legible I have indeed preserved a short Journal which now must supply every Thing Had any one but you made this Request I should have found more than one reasonable Excuse for a Denial It is not a bare Relation of my Fate will content you I must give you the History of a whole Nation its Manners and Government and describe it to you in such a Light as I found it  and not such as perhaps you and many others have believed it to be It is true since the Beginning of this Century we have had a more extensive Knowledge of this Nation than formerly and the great Reform which has been attempted in it has furnished ample Occasion for Discourse You will see how far it has succeeded and whether the Pains which have been taken and the Torrents of Blood which have been shed have answered Expectation It is generally said we must travel to know the Manners of People But to my Cost I have found that it is requisite to know them before we leave our own Home You will be the more convinced of this Truth the farther you proceed in the History of my Adventures  In my former Letter I advis'd you that after the Misfortune which obliged me to leave a Country I shall regret to the last Period of my Life transported by a just Despair I had no other Thoughts but of retiring to some Place where I might be entirely unknown but my evil Destiny continued to pursue me and directed my Choice to the only Part of the World where she could exercise her most cruel Tyranny upon me For I am persuaded there is no other Country in which I could have been exposed to the like Events I shall leave you to judge of these Matters be prepared only to give Attention to what I am about to relate You will find some Things to amuse and divert you and others which will justly raise your Indignation and compel you to allow that it is with Truth I say I am returned from another World  Being arrived at  Dantzick  where I made some Stay I resolved to conceal my self from the whole World under the Character of an  Italian  Merchant with the Name of  Roccaforte  My Imagination probably suggested this Name to my Mind  to encourage me to undergo all my Misfortunes with Constancy In the mean Time uneasy and tired as I was with a painful Journey by Land I was for trying if I could leave some Share of my Sorrows there and embarked in the Beginning of  May  on Board a small Vessel bound for St  Petersburg  whither my Inclinations led me  We departed from the Harbour the next Day with a tolerable good Wind but the Day following about the same Hour were again in the same Place having been obliged to return faster than we set out We hoisted Sail a second Time But the Inconstancy of the Weather and the Violence of the Winds drove us for the space of a Fortnight sometimes on the Coasts of  Pomerania  sometimes on those of  Denmark  now on the  Swedish  Coasts and then on the  Livonian  where a Sight of the Island of  Dagho  had like to have cost us dear by the Unskilfulness of our Pilot A Want of Provisions began to augment our Fears the Voyage from  Dantzick  to  Petersburg  being generally eight or ten Days whereas we had been already fifteen at Sea We were often in Sight of the Island of  Gothland  but with such stormy Weather as obliged us to keep the Sea At Length we happily gained the Eastern Coast of that Island where among a Number of Rocks we found a proper Anchorage It was with great Pleasure I went on Shoar where the first thing I observed was by certain Marks that the Sea was retired from that Place The next Day I was fully convinced of it and saw that it had left a good half League of dry Land We were so fortunate to find a House and whatever we wanted to revictual our Ship  During our Stay there which was three or four Days I diverted my self with taking long Walks and I found very pleasant ones all along the Shoar  with Situations very proper for the Abode of a Wretch like my self You will laugh at another Remark I made in this Island which is that of one Species of Birds common every where else at least in  Europe  and that small part of  Asia  I have travelled through I mean  Sparrows  not any are to be seen there If you ask me the Reason of it I shall ingenuously confess my Ignorance since there are many other Kinds of Birds I could gladly have staid some Days longer in this charming Solitude But the Time for our Departure was come and we were destined to be another Fortnight the Sport of the Winds which at length drove us into the Port of  Revel  These Accidents which happened to me in my Voyage were designed by Fate to give me a Foresight of what I was to expect when arrived in Port But I was not capable of Reflection my Thoughts were bent on nothing but carrying my Despair and Sorrows to a Place where they might not be seen or known by any one After having furnished ourselves with some Provisions at  Revel  we put to Sea again and not to tire your Patience any longer after a most unfortunate Voyage of six Weeks we arrived the th of  June  at  Petersburg  Ergo erat in fatis  Scythiam  quoque visere nostris  But before I suffer this Exclamation to carry me too far I must solemnly protest that being about to treat of the  Muscovite  Nation of which  Difficile est Satyram non scribere  I except the August SOVERAIGN who now rules it for whom I have the most profound Veneration I am acquainted with her extraordinary Qualities and especially her Religion and Piety I am not ignorant in what an excellent Manner she dispenses her Justice and Clemency but what is most admirable  is her extreme good Nature a Quality rarely to be met with on the Throne which however she possesses in the highest Degree of Perfection and extends to the utmost of her Power tho' always far short of her Inclination So that in many Cases we might justly make her speak the Language of  Iphigenia  Non ego crudelis juvenes ignoscite dixit  Sacra suo facio barbariora loco  In short to say every Thing in a few Words there is nothing wanting in her that can be desired but on the contrary what she might reasonably expect she is far from possessing Her Merits give her a Title to govern another Sort of People who might be capable of knowing and perceiving the Happiness they enjoy in her Person and to have another Kind of Subjects about her who might assist her in supporting the Burthen of so vast a Government  As for the Illustrious  Princess  the only Remains of the Family which now reigns they only who have not seen nor heard of her can be at a Loss to distinguish her from the rest of the Nation The Qualities of her Mind and Body are a Conjunction of whatever is excellent And if I should pretend to give you a Detail of what I have seen of one and heard of the other I should not be so soon able to give you Satisfaction with Regard to my self Let it then suffice that she possesses every Quality in such a Perfection  Quâ faemina nasci nulla potest  Having rendered  Quae sunt Caesaris Caesari  I return to my Voyage which we pursued up the  Nieva  till we came near a fine Bridge of Boats that crosses it I would gladly have landed immediately but the Officers who were put on Board our Vessel at  Cronstadt  would not suffer us to carry  the least Thing from the Ship I was therefore forced to stay on Board and it was three Days before our Master could get his Clearances which gave me not the best Idea of their Regulations with Regard to Trade In this Interval all I could do was to amuse my self with what came within my View The first Thing which offered was the Bridge which serves for a Communication of one Part of the Town with the other It is little frequented from whence I concluded the Place not populous and I was not deceived The Ships which are ranged on both Sides of the River in a Symetrical Order make a pretty agreable View but the rest is no way answerable to this Part of the Town which may be called fine Suffer me now to guess at your Desires I am persuaded that amidst the Accuracy of the Relations you desire from me they do not extend to a Description of Things that would be an Entertainment too gross for your refined Taste nor shall I want Matter without that to employ a good Part of your Time For being to give you an Account of a Captivity which lasted two whole Years Circumstances will offer of sufficient Importance to deserve not to be treated in a  Laconic  Manner  The first Person I became acquainted with at  Petersburg  was a Merchant whose Name is  Mariotti  a very honest Man and to whom I am highly obliged He assisted me in every Thing within his Sphere and I am persuaded he would have done more had it been in his Power I went to the  Roman Catholic  Church and visited the Fathers who officiated in it whither a pretty many People resorted I there used my best Endeavours to get Information of such Things as were most necessary on my Arrival in a Country where I proposed to settle I picked up my Intelligences some here some there and neglected no Opportunity to be instructed  Thus in a few Days I easily perceived this was no Country for my Purpose but I was advanced too far to retreat My Business was how to get into the Service I advised with Mr  Mariotti  about it But he laid so many Difficulties before me as threw me into an unusual Disorder  While my Thoughts where thus employed what Course to take I accidentally saw a Person who I believed might know me and besides met with a very singular Adventure which obliged me to take other Measures I formed the Resolution of going to  Persia  where I knew the Prince of  HesseHomburg  commanded and the Character I had heard of him gave me Room to hope that if I made my self known to him he would not refuse me the Honour of his Protection I but just hint at these Matters now because you will find a particular Account of them in a Petition I presented to the  Czarina  's CabinetCouncil But I must acquaint you with the chief Motive that put me upon going to  Persia  which I could not insert in that Piece as you yourself will judge Being continually inquisitive after a Knowledge of Things I likewise gathered all the News I could not only what was published in the  Gazettes  but what I could learn from the Persons I conversed with Among the latter was one who was perfectly acquainted with the Projects Designs and Preparations of the Court of  Petersburg  and who knew the Strength as well as the weak Side of this Power which now so much alarms  Europe  tho' I see no Reason for it By all I could learn I was convinced that the War in  Poland  was inevitable and that if I engaged in the  Russian  Service I should perhaps be obliged to draw my Sword against a Prince I respect and against a Nation I shall love with my latest Breath and to which I owe the little Knowledge I have in the Art of War You know me  so much a  Frenchman  at Heart to be intirely persuaded I should rather quit the Profession of a Soldier for ever than engage against the Interest of King  Stanislaus  and the Troops employed to support his lawful Rights The Declaration made by the  French  King to all the Ministers I had seen left me no Room to doubt but he would employ all his Force in so just a Cause for which the Honour of the  French  Name is so tenderly concerned I leave you to judge whether I could bear to be in the  Muscovite  Army in View of the Troops of  France  I detest the very Thoughts of it This was the true Motive which fixed my Resolution of going to  Persia  and you are by this Time sensible I could not insert it in the Petition mentioned above As soon as my Design was formed I spoke to my Friend  Mariotti  to look out for a Conveniency of going thither and in order to provide what was most necessary for my Journey I sold a good Part of my Equipage to raise Money My next Care was to get a Pass which is not to be obtained without Difficulty and at a great Expence especially if it be to go out of the  Russian  Dominions But as this was not my Case I got off for four or five Rubles  A  Russian  Coin about the Value of a Crown  A shameful Practice to oblige People to pay for a Pass What must a Person do who has but just enough to bear the Expences of his Journey Why truly he must remain there and submit to Slavery as has been the Case of many A Foreigner who has lived some Time among them finds it difficult to obtain his Dismission They are no sooner informed of his Intent than they raise Suspicions and carry their Jealousy and Distrust to an Excess Whoever has once got a Knowledge of their Affairs must never hope to leave the Country They imagine they have Reason to apprehend such a one would divulge their  Arcana  What more sensible Evidence  can there be of the Weakness of their Government  All I advance on this Head is but too wellgrounded and I could give a Number of Instances which would sufficiently evince this Truth But I shall confine myself to One that of an  Italian  who calls himself  Sava  and who has rendered the Empress such Services as put it out of the Power of this Princess to acknowledge them As his Case has been already made public I shall not detain you with a long Account of it And only add that this Man after having long served the State could not obtain Leave to pass the Rest of his Days with his Wife at  Venice  Does not this single Instance of  Muscovite  Politicks surprize you For my Part I think it the more shocking as the Person I am speaking of deserves a better Fate But to return to my own Concerns  Having procured a Pass I wanted nothing but a favourable Opportunity of departing and soon after one offered such I thought as my Heart could wish I embraced it with the greater Pleasure as I was convinced I should by this Means pursue my Journey with Safety and Delight It was not easy to foresee that such an Opportunity could ever be the Source of a grievous Captivity and of all my Misfortunes You without doubt know that the Emperor PETER I founded an Academy of Sciences which is yet in being but in so confused a State that the principal Members of it have desired their Dismission Perhaps likewise you have heard of an Expedition to the NorthEastern Parts of  Asia  to a Country call'd  Kamtschatki  in which the  Muscovites  have already settled some Colonies This Undertaking furnished me with the Opportunity I am speaking of Three Professors of the Academy one of Astrology a second of History and a third of Botany were to be sent to this Country  and they with several others formed a sort of Caravan Their Way lay through the Kingdom of  Casan  which was likewise my Road to  Persia  As soon as I was informed that these Gentlemen were preparing to depart I did what I could to be one of the Company I first enquired to whom I must make my Application for this End and was told to Mons  de l'Isle  Professor of Astronomy Brother of the late Mons  de l'Isle  the famous Geographer to his most  Christian  Majesty This Gentleman left  France  and went to  Petersburg  in the Time of  Peter  I who had desired him of the  French  King As I shall have frequent Occasion in the Sequel to mention him and his Spouse I must not omit making you acquainted with their Characters but I must previously tell you that their Merit infinitely surpasses whatever I can say of them Good Nature Generosity Candour and every other Quality which can render a Person amiable are perfectly united in them I may say in short they are an Honour to the  French  Nation A rare  Phenomenon  to preserve so many good Qualities among a People who hardly know one of them Nothing can be a more convincing Proof of it than what they did for me during my Captivity  When I waited on Mons  de l'Isle  to concert with him the Measures I had to take he received me with an unprecedented Politeness and gave me a most favourable Reception He told me that he was not to go the Journey himself but that it was his Brother Mons  de la Croyere  who without doubt would rejoice at having my Company I afterwards spoke of it to Mons  de la Croyere  and to the other Professors who readily granted my Desire Some Days after Mons  de la Croyere  desired me to come to his House in Order to depart the next Day But their last Dispatches not being ready our Journey was delayed  a good while longer During this Interval Mons and Madam  de l'Isle  compelled me to be with them and treated me as an intimate Friend There it was I got acquainted with Mons  du Vernoi  a very learned Professor of Anatomy and a Man of unquestionable Worth To whom I have great Obligations for Services done me And as I shall mention him farther in the Sequel of my History I thought it my Duty to make you acquainted with him As our whole Conversation at Mons  de l'Isle  's turned upon the Expedition to  Kamtschatki  I had some Inclination to go thither my self and it was compatible enough with my Resolution of being unknown I opened my Mind to Mons  de l'Isle  and we debated on it some Days But upon mature Enquiry finding neither Order nor Management in the Design I thought no more of it And indeed they were so ill prepared for it that on the very Day intended for our Departure we were obliged to put it off a Fortnight to regulate certain Matters which ought to have been provided for long before Such is the Custom of the Country Nothing is done there  Today  every Thing is put off till  Tomorrow  which I have too often experienced to my Cost and been forced to put up with those  Todays  and  Tomorrows  for three Months together  At length after many Delays on the most frivolous Accounts in the World we were upon the Point of departing But two of these Gentlemen having some Doubts I went before with a Servant Monsieur  de la Croyere  was so kind to give me We agreed upon a Place where we were all to meet and pursue our Journey afterwards together Monsieur  de l'Isle  and his Spouse not satisfied with the Civilities they had shewn me loaded me with such a Quantity of Provisions as  would have served me quite to  Persia  had I been allowed to pursue my intended Journey thither  The Day of my Departure was the th of  August  OS I embarked on board a small Vessel as customary and went up the River  Nieva  to the famous Canal of  Ladoga  This Canal is situate in a very marshy Soil and is of a vast Extent but I very much question whether the Advantages accruing from it answer the immense Sums it cost at first not to mention the prodigious Number of Lives sacrificed in that Undertaking I make little or no Doubt but it will insensibly fall to Decay because it is hardly possible to keep it in Repair without a considerable yearly Expence and on the other Hand the  Muscovites  are not enough inured to Labour to continue such painful Works long  From this Canal of  Ladoga  I entered the River  Wolkowa  in which there are Currents of an astonishing Rapidity and very difficult to stem The Violence of the Stream broke the Rope which drew my Barque but by good Fortune it happened at a Place where the Danger was not great and all the Damage I suffered was being carried some Distance back again However not to incur the like Danger again I took care always to land when I found myself exposed to it  These Currents or rather Cataracts of the  Ladoga  are a Hinderance to the Advantages proposed by this Canal The chief Aim of digging it was to facilitate the Communication of the  Wolga  with the  Baltick  and so far it has succeeded because by this River there is a very easy Passage even to the  Caspian  Sea It is likewise of great Service to the Transport from  Muscow  to  Petersburg  As for the Transport of Goods from  Petersburg  into the Country I look upon this Design as very difficult How is it possible Vessels heavy laden should  stem these Currents What Dangers would they not be exposed to And supposing it practicable how few Merchants would be at the Expence of an Undertaking of this Nature  Having passed these Currents I continued my Journey through a Country equally populous and well cultivated I traversed the great  Novogrod  which carried me into the Lake of  Imen  from thence into the River  Mista  which I was likewise obliged to go up as far as  Bronitz  the Rendezvous appointed by my Friend  de la Croyere  We both rejoiced at our happy Meèting and after having continued our Journey some Days by Land we embarked on the  Twersa  a little River which falls into the  Wolga  at  Twer  whither we repaired Here we were obliged to stay about ten Days to fit out a large Barque big enough for the whole Caravan I must confess this Delay was very tedious to me And I could not conceive how in an Undertaking of this Importance Measures could have been so ill concerted But thus as I observed before it is with every Thing in  Muscovy  an eternal Slowness rules in all their Actions and if any thing ever succeeds there it is generally the Effect of meer Hazard  All Things being ready for our Departure Monsieur  de la Croyere  would take me into the same Cabbin provided for himself I shall not give you any Account of my Remarks nor of what happened in my Journey from  Petersburg  to  Casan  I had kept a little Journal but the  Muscovites  thought fit to take away this and several other of my Papers This petty Larceny shews the Character of the People They were apprehensive the Use I should make of this Journal might not turn to their Honour and perhaps they were not mistaken This however is certain that Distrust is one of the evil Qualities of this Nation  I think I promised to say something of  Kamtschatki  and of the Expedition thither it is time I keep my Word and entertain you a Moment on that Head  It is certain that the NorthEast Part of  Asia  differs very much from what it has been long believed to be It was supposed to be bordered by the  Promontorium Glaciale  or Cape of  Swetenoes  But it is now discovered that at the End of this Cape there is a large Continent which stretches North and South for the Space of more than twenty Degrees and forms a sort of  Peninsula  joining to that Part of  Asia  only on the North On the Western Side of it is a Gulph which separates it from  Siberia  and on the Eastern Side is the Sea of  Japan  Towards the South it is bordered by a very narrow Streight full of Islands For this Discovery we are indebted to the People who inhabit the most Northern Parts of  Siberia  Some pretend it was made by Sea by doubling the Cape of  Swetenoes  Others that it was made on the Landside by advancing very far into the Country I shall not determine which is the right But however this be it is certain the Country is inhabited by divers Nations and that at this Time a great Number of  Russian  Colonies are settled there PETER I sent a  Danish  SeaOfficer thither called Captain  Berrin  who having undertaken the Journey by Land traversed  Siberia  advanced to this very Place and returned What Discoveries this Captain made I cannot pretend so justly to say But it is to be presumed that whatever Measures have been since taken are grounded on his Report The same Officer has now undertaken this second Journey thither by Order of the Empress who has intrusted the Direction of this Affair solely to him He departed some Months before us with a large Company especially  of Mariners and a great Number of Artificers who are to be employed in building several Vessels there The Professors hoped to overtake them at  Tobolski  the Capital of  Siberia  with the rest of the Caravan  This Project was formed with several Views The first is to establish a Trade with the  Japanese  The second to work at the Mines which are very rich and numerous in the Country already known And a third to attempt new Discoveries towards  America  which perhaps is not very far from thence since the Bounds of the Northern Part of  California  are not yet known It is even said that Captain  Berrin  has already discerned some Land on that Side We must allow that nothing has a more promising Appearance than all these Views and if they succeed great Advantages will ensue But I very much fear the Court of  Russia  will be deceived in their Expectations and am concerned for my Friend the Astronomer who has engaged so unwarily in the Design Their Measures have been hitherto so ill concerted that in all Appearance this Enterprize will never succeed The greater Part of those employed therein are unexperienced Persons who have no Talent nor have I observed either Discipline or Order among them Nevertheless a Scheme of this Nature if well executed would excite the Attention of all  Europe  and be an inexpressible Glory to the Sovereign under whose Reign it has been formed  I should be curious to know what the  Dutch  think of this Undertaking they who alone in  Europe  carry on a Trade to  Japan  They would not have much Reason to be concerned at it The  Muscovites  are not a very expeditious People to settle such a Commerce But it may be objected that the Face of Affairs may change in  Russia  The Inhabitants of it are not always the same And after all may not the Design which miscarried in the first Attempt succeed in a Second Vain Imagination A Change in the  Muscovites  is a  Phenomenon  which will not appear so soon and which I confess I look upon as impossible On the other Hand there are in the wise and mighty Republick of  Holland  Politicians too refined and Traders too knowing not to be watchful for the Security of their Commerce And if they find such a Settlement likely to take Place they will not want Means to prevent the Consequences of it The least Suspicions dextrously insinuated into the jealous Minds of the  Japanese  would alone suffice to overthrow all the Schemes of the  Muscovites  were they even concerted with more Prudence and Wisdom than they are  My Journey to  Kamtschatki  has been no less tedious than that from  Twer  to  Casan  We entered the little River of  Casanka  which begun to freeze and going up it arrived the th of  October  about Noon at  Casan  where I shall take some Days Repose Do you the same Sir expecting a second Letter in which I shall acquaint you only with what regards my self  Et quanquam luctus renoventur amari Perpetiar memorare tamen  Yours c  LETTER II  SIR  _I Take the Advantage of staying at  Casan  as well to recover my self from the Fatigues of my Journey as to retrieve if possible the Time I have lost But what Satisfaction can I make for having kept a profound Silence with regard to you for two whole Years together The more I think of it the more I am sensible of my Incapacity And indeed what Possibility is there of expressing the Obligations I lye under for what you have done in my Behalf No Sir I am convinced I shall never be in a Condition to make a Return adequate to your Goodness  Nec si Nestoreos compleam annos  My last informed you of our Arrival at  Casan  the th of  October  It then began to be so cold that the River was half frozen over I had so little Thoughts of making any stay there that my first Care was to inquire if there was any Vessel bound for  Astracan  But it was labour in vain the Season was too far advanced I had no Remedy but to hire a Barque to my self and all Necessaries for my Journey were soon provided My Friends were no sooner informed of my Design than they used their utmost Endeavours to dissuade me from it Mons  de la Croyere  in particular gave me such an Idea of the Difficulties and represented in such lively Colours the Dangers I was about to expose myself to that I at length determined to wait for an Opportunity of continuing my Journey by Land  It was next to impossible for me to resist the pressing Instances which were made me on this Account My Resolution being fixed a small Lodging was provided for me and as I foresaw my Abode there might be long I took care to buy those Things I should stand in need of The next Point was what Character I was to appear under After mature Consideration I concluded it would not become me to remain wholly under Disguise and as a Vagrant I did not in the least doubt but the Professors made mention of me But I was intirely at a Loss what Construction was put upon their Discourse Being informed that the Governor was a Person of Distinction who had travelled and spoke  French  and  Italian  I took that Resolution which to me seemed alone becoming a Man of Honour I paid him a Visit the th of  October  and opened my self to him in the following Words  "Sir tho I am persuaded it is allowable to deceive the Publick in Things which concern none but my self I am at the same Time convinced it will not become me to impose upon a Person of your Quality and Character My Pass you see describes me as a Merchant by a feigned Name But I must confess to you that I am a Soldier of some Distinction My Design is to go into  Persia  to offer my Service to the Prince of  HesseHomburg  to be employed under him in Her Majesty's Army I beg of you Sir to give me a Guard that I may continue my Journey in Safety"  I told him my real Name and the Reason which had induced me to conceal it He answered me courteously enough but with some Perplexity  "I am sorry said he for your Misfortunes and shall take care for your Departure with the first Opportunity"  Having thereupon made me repeat my true Name he took it down in Writing He continued his Discourse to me in the  most obliging Manner But perceiving his Countenance did not speak the same Language I replied  "Sir as you may have some Scruple with Respect to my Person I here offer you my Sword and am ready to surrender my self your Prisoner whenever you shall think proper 'till you know who I am and in what manner I have behaved"  To which he answered in these very Words  "Fear Nothing Sir I am convinced by your Carriage and your Discourse that you are the Person you say you are Let nothing disquiet you and be assured a Passage shall be provided for you in the first Ship that departs for  Astracan  "  Upon this I took my Leave without however knowing what Course to take The Surprize I had observed in his Looks was to me not the most auspicious Omen  When I left the Governour I went directly to Mons  de la Croyere  to acquaint him what had happened I had too much Obligation to conceal any Thing from him He had Company with him so I did not think it proper to speak of this Matter 'till he was alone I had hardly sat down when I saw the CityMajor come in at the Head of half a Dozen Soldiers with their Bayonets on the Muzzles of their Muskets He immediately demanded my Sword which I gave him without Hesitation telling him the Governour might have received it himself without taking this Step He did not understand me but behaved with much more Politeness than is usual in  Muscovy  I must do him the Justice to own that of all those I had any Concern with his Carriage was the most Gentlemanlike I could almost swear he is of  Tartarian  Race At least his Shape and Phisiognomy had very much the Resemblance of that Nation which has Nothing in common with the  Muscovite  He soon took Possession of the Room I was in and obliged Mons  de  la Croyere  with his Company to go out and then leaving me to the Care of a Corporal and six Soldiers who kept their Bayonets on the Muzzles of their Muskets he returned to give the Governour an Account of his Expedition I desired Mons  de la Croyere  when he left me not to be uneasy neither on his own Account nor mine assuring him that the Regard he had shewn for me could never be of any Prejudice to him The Major returned in about half an Hour and taking me in his Sled carried me to my Lodgings where all that belonged to me were examined with the greatest Exactness This was done by a young Man who had the Appearance of an Officer but whose Carriage bespoke him nothing less Not the least Thing in my whole Equipage could escape his Sight He unfolded my Shirts and folded them up again to see if he could find any thing concealed in them In short his Hands and Eyes were every where The Major who seemed pleased with his performing his Function with so much Care told him with a Sneer  Thou wouldst make an excellent  Valet de Chambre  none better  I took this young Man to be an Officer by his Dress But if he was so judge what sort of Officers there are in  Muscovy  After a nice Enquiry what was to be found they bundled up my Books and some Writings of no great Concern which they seized and carried off  Having thus disposed of my Effects the next Thing was to secure my Person They carried me to the  Corps de Garde  which is overagainst the Governour's House I was there shut up in the Officer's Room where a Soldier was placed to guard me within Sight with his Sword drawn I expected with Impatience that the Governour would either send for me or let me know what he designed to do with me It was already past Noon and I saw no Body but the Officer of the Guard  and the Soldiers who went out and in At length a very slender Dinner was brought for the Officer and another Person who was to dine with him They were so civil to invite me to take Part with them I returned them Thanks But enquiring of them by Signs if the Governour would not send me my Portion likewise they gave me to understand he would not In vain I desired to have somebody I could speak with I was told I was not to expect it Hunger in the mean time pressing and seeing nothing brought me I thought it was best to accept of their Offer I neither saw nor heard of any thing farther the whole Day and Night being come I was obliged to take up with a Bench instead of a Bed where however I slept pretty quietly after having taken a Knife out of my Pocket which was troublesome to me and which was stolen before Morning from the Table where I laid it  I met with no better Usage the Day following Having therefore expected my Destiny to no Purpose 'till Noon I desired to speak with the Officer to whom I gave to understand by Signs and pretty bluntly that I was ill used that he should go to the Governour and tell him I expected he should either send me an Interpreter or suffer me to speak to him my self This Officer highly surprized to see a Prisoner equally haughty in his Gesttures and threatning in the Tone of his Voice went immediately out of the Room but returned in a Moment to tell me the Governour was not at Home Tho this Answer gave me little Satisfaction I endeavoured to make him understand several other Things but to no Purpose He only perceived that I wanted to know whether I should have any Thing sent me to eat and to this he again answered in the Negative I plainly saw I was to be at my own Expence and therefore threw a Ruble on the Table and made Signs to have something provided for me  It may not be amiss to observe here that in the whole Kingdom of  Casan  a Ruble is a considerable Sum sufficient to maintain a Man elegantly for a whole Month As Money is extream scarce in this Country every thing is exceeding cheap A Sheep is not worth above ten Pence  I have translated the  French  Word  Sous  a Penny because we have no Denomination of Coin exactly adequate to it tho' otherwise it is not worth above two Thirds of a Penny  a Hen a Penny and Eggs the same For or Rubles you may buy the best Horse that is brought to Market and the best Bullock is not worth above Two You know without doubt that a Ruble is a Silver Coin of about the Value of Livres and a half  French  Money  They returned me my Change but I soon perceived that Stewards in  Muscovy  were no more troubled with Honesty than in other Countries I was however under a Necessity of being cheated in this Manner during the whole Time of my Captivity I thought my self happy when I met with People who were contented with a small Gain But this is a  Phenomenon  which rarely appears in  Muscovy  Pardon I beseech you a small Digression You may perhaps be curious to know my Bill of Fare It consisted only in Bread Beer and a large Piece of boiled Sturgeon I no sooner sat down to my short Meal than a Corporal who was in the Room came to offer me the Service of a Carver with the same Knife which was stolen from me the Night before I leave you to judge of my Surprize I fell a laughing and at the same Time laying hold of my Knife I gave him to understand I could dispense with his Office But finding he would not let go his Hold I began to talk big and hector My Guards were afraid and thought proper to send for their Officer He came in a great Fright and being informed of the Matter he offered me his Hand  and made me give him my Word that no Mischief should ensue Satisfied with my Promise he ordered my Knife to be given me but I was obliged to return it again after Dinner This short Scene let me see into what Hands I was fallen and by this I judged what Treatment I had to expect for the future  Me scivi in media vivere Barbaria  In the Afternoon my Cloaths were brought me of which I found they had stolen a good Part The Linnen I had given to wash they brought me quite wet And as they had seized among my other Papers my Laundress's Bill I suppose that was laid among the Rest before the Empress's CabinetCouncil As for the Receipt for my Rent which I had paid beforehand and several other Things I had bought they did not think fit to restore them nor was ever any farther Mention made of them In the mean time I still persisted in demanding an Interpreter or that I might be carried before the Governour but allIntreaties on thisHead were fruitless I then perceived I must prepare to return to  Petersburg  and consequently undergo the Fatigue of a Journey of or Leagues For this End I was desirous at least to buy Necessaries to screen me from the Cold But no Body could or would understand me and I was wholly ignorant what would be my Pate  The next Day a Man brought my printed Books which he lock'd up in my Trunk leaving only a  Russian  Almanack with a little Dictionary in my Disposal They likewise allowed me some Shirts but every Thing else was locked up and sealed About Four in the Afternoon I was carried by a Guard of a Serjeant and two Soldiers to one of the Suburbs of the City where I lay that Night in the House of a Peasant And here it was that I began  to bully in earnest I had delivered my Sword as I have observed above to the CityMajor and it had been kept in my Prison When they carried me away I bid the Serjeant take it with him But the Officer of the Guard who probably took a Liking to it refused it under Pretext as far as I could understand that the Major would send it after me After having waited for it some Time in vain I told the Serjeant I was resolved not to go away without my Sword I spoke to him of it with such an Air of Authority that he at length thought fit to go for it and brought it me in a Moment Happily for me the Woman of the House where I was had a Sheepskin Pelt quite new which she seemed very willing to part with because the Wool began to fall off We soon agreed for the Price and it was of great Service to me in the Sequel During my Stay at  Twer  I had likewise got a Cap made of a black  Fox  skin Muff which cost me a great deal of Money tho it was then of no Use to me I yet keep these two Pieces of Fur with the whole Furniture of my Captivity hoping one Time or other to divert you with a Sight of them  The next Day being appointed for my Departure they put me into the worst Sled they could find and it was the first Time in my Life I had ever crossed a River in a Sled This River is called the  Casana  and was then so frozen as to bear great Burdens But the Passage over the  Wolga  had like to have proved fatal to me This River is very broad at the Place where I was to go over it I believe I speak within Compass if I say it is at least half a League broad The Ice was pretty strong to some Distance from the Banks but when we came farther we met with large Pieces of floating Ice driving with the Stream In the Middle of the River lay a Barque which waited  for me But when we came within three or four hundred Paces of it there was no other Way to get at it but by jumping from one Flake of Ice to the other I was at first terrified with the Danger and thought it rash to attempt this Passage However after some Reflections I took Courage and resolved to run the Hazard of it I was willing to set an Example to three  Muscovites  who were to follow me There were several Persons more who designed to have gone over with us but who after having viewed the Danger they were like to expose themselves to wisely resolved to return  There remained only two  Tartars  and a  Muscovite  on the Banks Seven or eight Men offered me their Assistance with some Planks to be made use of in the most dangerous Places But upon second Thoughts I believed it adviseable to see first what Course the two  Tartars  would take to overcome these Difficulties I beheld them tho not without laughing leaping from one Piece of Ice to the other and soon after getting into the Boat without any Accident Encouraged by their Example I was not long in resolving to follow them Having pulled off my Cloak I ordered two Men to walk before me whom I followed Step for Step I thought there was less Danger in tracing their Footsteps than if I had taken any other Way The Walk seemed pretty tedious to me but at length I had the Pleasure to take my last Leap into the Barque My two  Tartars  expressed their Joy by Signs to see me with them and I no less rejoiced at having escaped so great a Danger Those who followed me had likewise the good Fortune to get into the Barque to us  The  Muscovite  more timorous than the rest would be the last and was near being lost He  was not half way when he sunk down between two Pieces of Ice which by good Fortune proved strong enough to bear him up by his two Arms One of the Passengers who happened to be near him came to his Assistance and helped him up on the Ice again when perceiving he was nearer the Shoar than the Bark he chose rather to go back than to expose himself to new Perils This Bark carried us over tho with great Difficulty For every Moment large Pieces of Ice came driving upon us without any Possibility of avoiding them  Being happily arrived on the other Shoar I ran towards some Houses which were not far off to screen my self from a very piercing Cold and a NorthWind which blew hard My Guards who were not yet recovered from the Fright which so dangerous a Passage had put them into and being besides taken up with getting my Goods on Shoar had forgot to keep an Eye upon me In the mean Time having found all the Houses shut I went into a little Church where I heartily thanked GOD for having delivered me from so apparent a Danger I staid there some Time with no other Design but to be screen'd from the Cold Our People at length having lost Sight of me were alarmed and ran with all their Might directly towards the Houses not doubting but I was got into one of them They were greatly surprized when they got thither and I who sawtheir Uneasiness took a Pleasure in leaving them in it However not to carry the Jest too far I appeared again a Moment afterwards and eased them of the Fears of my being escaped  We took up our Lodging at a House near the Place of our Landing being resolved to spend the Night there to rest from our great Fatigue Tho our Journey this Day had been but short it  might be reckoned one of the most severe we had to undergo Being come to our Quarters I endeavoured to convince the Serjeant who had Care of me that he might be very easy on my Account and I promised him to do nothing contrary to his Orders He understood me and taking me by the Hand expressed a Satisfaction in my Behaviour From this Time forwards I was no longer a Prisoner but my Guard became my Servants After a light Supper I laid my self down to rest The Night was long and I had Time enough to sleep and to think at Leisure on my unhappy Fate It may perhaps not be disagreable to you to know what were my Reflections on this Occasion  They chiefly ran upon my Adventures I first called to Mind all that  Peter  the  Great  had done the Pains he had taken and the Torrents of Blood he had shed to extricate his Subjects from that Barbarity and Ignorance into which they were plunged I then reflected on his Voyages Enquiries Labours and Establishments and I said to myself where are now the Effects of all the Pains this great Monarch took to reform his People Is it possible that his Subjects should be yet in the same State of Barbarity they were in long before his Reign Where are then the Fruits of his Labour I could not find that this Prince had changed the Genius of his Nation and I had but too much Experience of the contrary  Peter  I has been often heard to say That he had made Men of Beasts but that after his Death they would turn to Beasts again and the Author of these Letters seems to justify his Prophecy  From these Thoughts coming to the Usage I had met with the most injurious that could be imagined I began to make other Reflections The Government of  Casan  said I ought for several  Reasons to be looked upon as one of the principal Employments conferred by the  Russian  Court  The Kingdom of  Casan  is one of the ten Governments into which  Peter  I parcel'd out his vast  Empire  He first divided it into eight only of which the Kingdoms of  Casan  and  Astracan  together made one But upon enlarging his Conquests otwards  Persia  these two Kingdoms were separated and made two Governments which made them nine in all and he afterwards divided the two into three in Order to make ten Governments in Veneration to the Number Ten as it is said that Number being held sacred by the  Russians  Consequently the Person who now enjoys it should be esteemed one of the most worthy Subjects belonging to it And yet this Man who is stamped with such a Character behaves himself in the most unjustifiable Manner in the World He has neither Christianity nor even any Principle of Humanity He is the most vile and ungenerous of Men In a Word he is a very  Barbarian  Has not he shewn himself to be the most abandoned of the human Species with Regard to me Where is the Justice of imprisoning a Foreigner who relying upon the Laws of Nations travels under a feigned Name and in whom there does not appear the least Cause of Suspicion Is it a  Christian  Usage to force a Man to travel in a Season in which a  Muscovite  who is the most inured to Hardship is obliged to keep his Home Ought not he to have enquired whether I was provided with Necessaries to resist the Inclemencies of a hard Winter in a Climat I was no Ways accustomed to Was it not a Cruelty to abandon me in a Prison without ever informing himself if I had where withal to subsist He knew I was ignorant of the Language of the Country I was not capable of asking for what I stood most in need of Ought he not by his Orders to have prevented my being robbed of Part of what I had In short Sir would it not have excited your Compassion  passion to have seen me going over the  Wolga  And if I had perished in that Passage had not the Governour of  Casan  been the Cause of my Death I cannot but look upon this Event as the most dangerous I ever encountered with during the whole Course of my Life  But to go father To whom is it this Governour shews such unworthy Treatment Why to a Man of Quality one whom he himself has acknowledged to be so and pitied him in his Misfortunes A Person who with a sincere and open Heart throws himself into his Power and entreats his Protection That he might the better surprize and betray me he begins by giving me good Words he assures me I have nothing to fear and that he will procure me an Opportunity of pursuing my Journey in all Safety Weak ungenerous Action Tell me I beseech you was there no other Way to secure me but by Treachery In any other Country a little more civiliz'd a Governour of a Province would have behaved in a very different Manner He would have said  "Sir I am sorry I cannot grant you the Favour you ask the present Juncture and the positive Orders I have from Court oblige me indispensably to secure your Person However be assured I will do every thing that is in my Power to relieve you and make your Captivity easy"  Had the Governour of  Casan  treated me with such Language he would no less have executed the Orders of his Court supposing he had any And for me far from having Reason of Complaint I should certainly have acknowledged his Favours But this is not their Manner of Proceeding in  Muscovy  Their Way there is to seize a Person without any Cause without any Examination and without even alledging the least Pretext for it they treat him immediately as a  StateCriminal he is guarded within View and with Sword in Hand he is refused the Use of his Knife and Fork and his Equipage is rifled Can a People who behave in this Manner be called civilized And who then are  Barbarians  if they are not so Certainly if I had fallen into the Hands of  Mursa  the Chief of the  Tartars  who dwells in  Casan  I should never have met with such Treatment And yet these pass for  Barbarians  and no one has yet been at the Pains to undeceive the World in this Point There is an enormous Difference between them and the  Muscovites  but it consists in this that they are not guilty of the Vices the latter are so justly reproached with The very Sight of the  Tartars  inclines one to believe all that Fame tells us of those noble Enterprizes by Means of which they extended their Conquests throughout all  Asia  and a Part of  Europe  But at this Time by the greatest of all Misfortunes several Branches of this valiant Nation are brought under the  Muscovite  Yoke I must confess this surpasses my Understanding and I am at a Loss to comprehend it It is true the  Russians  shew a great Regard for them which is one Reason why they are so easy But as they are not born to creep to such Masters I hardly question but they will soon or late shake off their Yoke  You will judge Sir of the Length of the Night by that of my Reflections But at length Day appears and I must rise to pursue my Way to  Muscow  in a Season when the Ground is every where covered with Snow We had a pretty good Journey this Day chiefly thro Woods and Byways I was obliged to lie all along in my Sled to avoid the Branches of the Trees But then I was almost buried in the Snow which was every Moment falling upon me We came in  in the Evening to a Village the Houses of which appeared to me very different from those of the  Muscovites  Both Men and Women had other Habits and their Language bore no Analogy to the  Russian  Upon Enquiry I found I was among the  Scherimissian Tartars  and I rejoiced at it The Character I had heard of this Nation and what I had observed myself of them while at  Casan  gave me an advantageous Idea of them I took great Delight in viewing their Houses and Furniture but more especially the Dress of their Women which is very singular  While I was diverting myself in this Manner I had the Dissatisfaction to see my Guard scuffling with my Landlady These Rascals had their Views in taking this Way which is not the common Road The most brutal among them began to abuse the poor old Creature for no other Crime but endeavouring to secure her own I thought it my Duty to stand by this Woman I therefore wrested a large Pole out of the Hands of a Soldier who had seized it and what with Signs and Words had the good Fortune to appease him I found however that the poor  Scheremissi  had been obliged to treat these Soldiers and to furnish them with whatever they asked For my Part I was contented with a small Matter conformable to the Bill of Fare I had prescribed my self for the whole Journey It may be proper to inform you that in  Muscovy  there are no Houses of Entertainment where a Man may lodge and be boarded In the Publick Houses they have they only sell Beer and Brandy Having therefore thrown down some Money on the Table I made a Sign for them to get me some Eggs They took but one Penny for which they brought me thirty I began to laugh at seeing so large a Number for so little Money I picked out six of the freshest and gave the rest to my Landlady  One of my greedy Guard would have laid hold on them but I gave him to understand by a Sign that he was already well enough served My whole Supper consisted of these six Eggs and a little Brandy mixed with Water I might have had Beer but it was so bad there was no drinking it This was all my Food from  Casan  to  Muscow  and this Way of Living was so far from impairing my Health that I was perfectly well at my Arrival there My Bedding was as mean as my Food a Bench was the only Conveniency offer'd me and all a Traveller has to expect throughout whole  Muscovy  I had happily provided my self before my Departure with a good Mattrass which was of singular Use to me as well now as afterwards  We continued our Journey the next Morning My Guard whose chief Views were Pillage were for putting up at Noon I plainly saw their Design But did not know how to prevent it However considering how much this retarded my Journey I took the Serjeant aside and endeavoured by good Words to convince him that this Behaviour of his Men might be the Occasion of a Riot My Admonition produced no great Effect he alledged some poor Reasons in their Justification which I was obliged to put up with I had every Day the Mortification to see these Freebooters go from House to House and pillage the poor  Tartars  of what they pleased I thought nevertheless it was my Business to proceed warily in Case of any Tumult I had Reason to be apprehensive that the enraged  Tartars  might attempt to massacre my Guard together with their Prisoner I therefore concluded that if any Disturbance happened the most prudent Measures I could take would be to join with the strongest Party I never suffered my Sword which was my only Defence to be out of my Sight To gain the  Affection of the  Tartars  I never went into any House but I gave the Children Money and as I had made a large Provision of white Bread I was very free in distributing Pieces of it among them for which I always had their Thanks My Guard tho very stupid had Cunning enough to pass by the larger Villages that they might pillage with the less Danger  This Behaviour of theirs gave Occasion to many Reflections which I made during my Journey I could not forbear lamenting my Fate to be put into the Hands of these Robbers A thousand Times I cursed the Governor for committing me to the Care of such Wretches When I observed what miserable Discipline they were under I said to my self  Quid Domini sacient audent cum talia Servi  It was a melancholy State I was reduced to and I could not reflect upon it without extream Concern I found my self obliged to traverse a Country almost unknown drawn upon a Board in the midst of the Snow dressed like a Savage and destitute in this Desart of wherewithal to eat or drink The three Soldiers who were my Companions were Men without Manners or Humanity nor could I ever have any Conversation with them I sometimes however dispelled these gloomy Ideas with a  sic erat in satis  I must not omit informing you that in this Journey I once quarrelled with my Sleddriver  This small Adventure will contribute not a little to give you a just Idea of the  Muscovites  The Rascal for he deserves no better Name took a Delight in giving every one of the poor  Scheremissi  he met a good Lash with his Whip I thought at first it would suffice to let him know it displeased  me and that he would then leave it But my Admonitions were in vain and my Patience being at length quite spent I gave him a Blow with my Fist that beat him off the Sled In his Justification he pretended to convince me that these People were no  Christians  Here had been a good Opportunity to read him a Lesson of Morality But then on the one Hand I must have known how to explain my self to him and on the other he must have been indued with some Principles of Religion a Thing very rare among the  Muscovites  But since I am speaking of Religion you must know the  Muscovites  think they alone have a Title to the Name of  Christians  They look upon all other People the  Europeans  not excepted to be Idolaters who have no Knowledge of the true God  Qualibus in tenebris vitae  Wretches that they are They are not sensible of the profound Ignorance in which they themselves are immerged What a strange Worship is theirs How imperfect their Faith How loose their Manners I speak more especially of those who are in the highest Posts and who ought to set an Example to others But to conclude my Reflections on this Head suffer me only to enquire what their Monks are This Species of Men who swarm in every Province are generally Drunkards who live in a criminal Slothfulness giving themselves up to all Manner of Vices Superstition abounds no where more than in their Convents Their Vows of Continence are a Crime because they never live up to them They think of nothing but living at their Ease without Labour or Care and they immure themselves within the Walls of their Convents only to escape Famine or going to the Army When I have frequently asked to what End this Number of Sluggards the Answer has always been their Business is to pray to  God  This is the Character of the Monks and of the whole Body of the Clergy in  Muscovy  If these Hypocrites who pretend to Sanctity had any Zeal for Religion would they suffer idolatrous Nations as these  Scheremissi  are who inhabit the very Center of the  Russian  Empire to live among them It is true the Clergy would be obliged to change their Manners before they could pretend to preach the Gospel or they would run a great Hazard not to make a single Convert All these  Pagans  live in an honest Simplicity and conformable to those Laws which Nature has dictated to all Men And certainly they would be very little inclined to give Ear to Men who lead a Life perfectly scandalous I fear Sir you will think this Digression tedious But the Subject has carried me insensibly beyond the Bounds I had prescribed my self I might say a great deal more on this Head  Verum animo satis haec vestigia parva sagaci  Suppose me just arrived at a Village called  Sabaczar  which was formerly the Capital of the Province where having bought some Provisions with a Covering for my Sled and a Sack to put my Feet in  It is a Custom in these and other Northern Parts to travel with a large Sack lined with Furr into which they put their Legs and drawing it up tie it about their Middles It is of excellent Service to keep out the Cold and for those who cannot pay for these a Sack filled with Bran has the same or a better Effect  I travelled afterwards with a little more Ease The Persons I employed to buy these Things did not forget themselves Not satisfied with the Present I made them they kept Part of the Money I put into their Hands I accused them of the Theft but I might as well have spoken to deaf Men And besides it is not customary in  Muscovy  to return Change  It was some Comfort to me under my Afflictions that these People did me the Office of Servants I was more their Superior and Master than their Prisoner I had always the good Fortune to keep up a Sort of Authority over my Guard and all I had any Concern with from the Beginning to the End of my Captivity Upon some Occasions I treated them harshly and at other Times I was as gentle as a Lamb Happy for me that I began in Time to bring them under my Yoke I might otherwise have been doubly their Slave The  Muscovites  are naturally very brutal but at the same Time timorous and great Cowards who when they find any Resistance have not the Courage to go on Cowards are generally treacherous But to put it out of their Power the best Way is to keep them under  In the last  Northern  War after the Battle of  Gadebusch  when the  Muscovites  were in  Holstein  the poor  Boors  who had been harrassed by the  Swedes  as Enemies and by the  Muscovites Saxons  and  Danes  as Friends were wont to say If they might have their Choice they would desire the  Swedes  as Enemies rather than the  Muscovites  as Friends  But to return to my Journey  From  Sabaczar  we went to  Nisninovogorod  Nischnagorod  I believe it should be  and from thence to  Muscow  where we arrived the d of  November  You will imagine without Doubt that at my Arrival in the Metropolis of so vast an Empire the Face of Things must necessarily be changed with Regard to me That I met with another kind of Men and especially a Governour of better Understanding and more just and human than the Governour of  Casan  and consequently that I was soon discharged from my Confinement or at least treated in a Manner more becoming my Quality If these be your Thoughts Sir you are greatly mistaken A  Muscovite  is the same every where and you will find them at  Muscow  just such as you have seen them at  Casan  Imagine the Inhabitants of this great City to be a new Colony of  Laplanders Samojedes  and  Ostiacks  who are accounted the most stupid Nations of the North and then you may form at least some Idea of the Character of the People who dwell in this Capital Do not however suppose this Parallel just in every Part of it The  Muscovites  are infinitely beneath all these other Nations They are more barbarous more irrational and less human The Evidences I shall give you of this in the Sequel will put it beyond all Doubt I could wish to do it now But as it is Time to put an End to this Letter which is already but too long  Verbum non amplius addam  LETTER III  SIR  _THO the last Messenger brought me no Letter from you I must not omit writing as well to perform my Promise as to satisfy your Curiosity It is besides a singular Pleasure to me that I am able now to pay a Debt which I have contracted by a long Silence Be assured it is no small Satisfaction to me that I can converse with you by Letter 'till  Dextrae conjungere Dextram  Fas crit notas audire ac reddere voces  My last gave you an Account of my Arrival at  Muscow  I was first carried to the House of a Baker till the Serjeant and one of the Soliders went to give an Account of my being there The Soldier who was left instead of following his Orders to have a watchful Eye over me laid himself down upon an Oven and slept most profoundly You must know in  Muscovy  the Houses of the meaner Sort of People consist generally of one large Room only which serves them for Chamber Kitchen and every other Occasion In this Room you find an Oven in which they bake their Bread Meat and almost all their Eatables so that it is kept very hot all the Year round The Top of it is covered with a great Number of Boards which form a Sort of square Scaffold upon which the whole Family almost continually lives as well in Summer as Winter I have sometimes happened to lay my Hand upon it but found it so hot that I was soon obliged to take it away Some natural Philosophers of your Acquaintance who have made so many curious Experiments concerning  Salamanders  did not perhaps know that so peculiar a Species of them was to be found in  Muscovy  It is to be supposed that if they had made this Discovery they would have allowed those Animals the Property given them by the most early of the Ancients of living in Fire Pray assure those Gentlemen that the  Salamanders  in  Muscovy  not only pass almost all their Time but eat sleep and perform every Office of Life in that Element  Nothing would have been more easy than for me to have escaped while my  Salamander  was asleep on the Oven and could I have foreseen what was to ensue I assure you I should not have neglected the Opportunity In a City so full of Strangers as  Muscow  is I might easily have been concealed  in the Crowd and have freed my self from the Pursuit of my Enemies But I was so far from having the least Thought of it that I looked upon all that had happened to me till then as a Farce which would end with my Arrival at  Petersburg  The first Scene which was opened at  Muscow  was humorous enough but that which followed was as tragical But you shall be judge of them  As soon as the Serjeant returned I was conveyed to  Cremelin  Kreml  or  Cremmelin  is the innermost of the four Towns or Parts into which the City of  Muscow  is divided and incircle one another It contains the Palace of the  Czars  of  Muscovy  an ancient Building which is said to contain Apartments including Cellars and Magazines as likewise the Cathedral and five other Churches It is not the Palace of the  Czars  alone which is called  Cremmelin  as some Writers suppose but this whole Town or Division of which the Palace is but Part  the Residence of the  Czars  I was not uneasy that the first Scene was opened in a Place where such tragical Pieces have been represented This Building consists of several enormous Piles heaped upon one another without any Order I was carried into a large Hall which they call the Palace or Civil Court but is one of the most filthy Places in the World I there found a great Number of Clerks busied in dispatching a Crowd of People who were round about them My coming in put an immediate stop to their Labour and the Eyes of every one were turned upon me As the  Muscovites  are sworn Enemies to the rest of Mankind the Sight of a Foreign Prisoner was a Diversion to them and the Hall was soon frequented in a more than ordinary Manner  I was committed to the Care of an Officer a Corporal and six old Soldiers One of them stood always before me with his Sword drawn but he had not the most terrifying Countenance At length they brought some of my Goods but I saw neither my Sword nor my Trunk They shewed  me one Corner of the Hall which was destined for my Prison But I had no sooner begun to prepare my Lodging than a Person appeared at the Gate to inform my Guard that I had a Pair of Scissars about me They immediately set about to visit a little Bag into which I had put such Things as were most necessary on my Journey and upon my opposing them they called the Officer who told me he had Orders to visit every Thing I had I then opened the Bag my self and in a Moment they seized the Scissars which they found there I endeavoured to convince them that I could not do without them that I should make no ill Use of them and that they need not fear my making my self an Eunuch with them None of these Arguments had any Effect so I was obliged to give way to Force By good Fortune I had another Pair of Scissars which escaped their Notice I had likewise a large Fork which upon Occasion would have done the Service of a Dagger for the least terrifying Weapons are more than sufficient to affright a  Muscovite  So excellent a Beginning gave me Room to judge what I had to expect in the Sequel I therefore endeavoured to make my self easy under the State I was in My greatest Mortification was to see my self exposed as a Sight to Crowds of People who were continually flocking into the Hall I should have been very glad of an Interpreter but all the Application I made for that End was in vain nor could I with all my Entreaties prevail upon them to let me have a Barber DinnerTime approaching I made Signs for something to eat and was answered in the same Manner that I must open my Purse After long waiting and seeing nothing appear I was obliged to be content with a Morsel of Bread and some Scraps which I had yet left in my Hamper While I was at Dinner  they asked me for the Key of my Trunk which they had not thought fit to entrust to my Care I thought it something strange that they should ransack my Trunk out of my Sight however I gave them the Key tho with Reluctance At SupperTime I was obliged to have Recourse to my Pocket and upon this Occasion I found that Stewards at  Muscow  are greater Thieves than those of  Casan  You will not need to ask me what Sort of a Bed I had I believe I have already told you that they lye on Benches in  Muscovy  I was so happy to have Sheets and Coverlets of my own which did me good Service But what a Surprize appeared in my Guard when they saw me making my Bed They could not conceive what I was going to do with those BedCloaths  You see Sir I keep my Word with you It was your Command that I should inform you of the most minute Circumstances and you have no Cause to complain on that Score Since then you have a Taste that Way you shall know some Particulars of what happened the next Day I was disturbed very early at my Toilet by the same Troop of Clerks I mentioned above and a great Number of other People whom Curiosity or Business had drawn together in the Hall I continued exposed as a Sight to these Crowds who could not forbear fixing their Eyes upon me At Length I began to think of making Advantage of this Concourse of People When I saw any one come in who had a good Appearance or who seemed to be an Officer or Foreigner I immediately accosted him speaking in  Italian French  or  Latin  But it was all in vain I did not find one who could understand me My Guard in the mean Time offended at the Freedom I took pretended to impose Silence upon me but I gave them to understand by Signs that they must cut out my Tongue if they would debar me  the Use of it Two  Poles  coming in I addressed my self to them in  Latin  and they began to answer me but their Mouths were soon stopped Their Silence did not however hinder me from asking them if it was customary in  Muscovy  to treat Prisoners as the most abject Slaves If it was usual to let them perish for Hunger by denying them an Interpreter And finally if since  Peter  the  Great  had obliged the  Muscovites  Peter  I obliged all his Subjects by an Edict to cut off their Beards and to wear short Cloathing which Edict was the Occasion of a Rebellion in in the Kingdom of  Astracan  and the adjacent Countries  to cut off their Beards there was no such Thing as a Barber established in that City  While I was discoursing with these  Poles  the Man who had been so anctious about my Scissars came in and made me a Sign to follow him Being persuaded that he was to carry me before the Governour I readily obeyed for I longed for nothing more being in Hopes he might understand some of the Languages I knew I was carried into an Apartment not far from the Hall where I found one single Man only but soon after came in another with some Papers in his Hands This latter passed by me without saluting or so much as looking on me and sate down near a Table towards which I likewise advanced The Person I saw first did the same and having asked me if I spoke  Italian  I answered him it was natural for me to speak my Mother Tongue He then after having received the Instructions of the Person who was sitting asked me who I was But before I answered him I was inquisitive in my Turn who it was that was examining me I was told he was a Secretary I was not a little surprized to see a Secretary examining me sitting while I was standing but being apprehensive I might be sent back from  whence I came I told him my Name which he wrote down He asked me several other frivolous Questions by which I found my Examination was not like to be short I therefore took the Resolution to tell him that if he expected any farther Answer from me he must order me a Chair He lifted up his Head in a great Surprize and looking me in the Face continued his Interrogations All the Answer I gave was that I would not speak standing He seemed terribly perplexed and I found he had not been accustomed to such Replies he was obliged however to give Way to them Being seated I was forced to give Answer to a Number of the most impertinent Questions in the World And what was particular there were besides the Soldier who guarded me Sword in Hand twenty other Persons in the Room A peculiar Manner of examining Prisoners of State As soon as the Secretary let me know I might retire I bid the Interpreter tell him I desired to speak with the Governour and that I expected to be treated as Persons of Quality are treated throughout all  Europe  All the Answer he vouchsafed me was that he did not know whether I was so or not Enraged to the utmost at this Answer I told him he had very little Skill in Physiognomy and I would gladly have added that having a better Knowledge of Men than he I could foretel him that the Gallows would soon be his Fate He had indeed a very hanging Look and my Prophecy would hardly have been misplaced I leave you to judge whether he did not deserve at least that Fate by his Carriage to me  The next Day I was again obliged to appear before Mr Secretary who took Care to put it out of my Power to insist upon being seated by ordering all the Chairs to be conveyed out of the Room This was so far from exciting my Anger that it put me into a good Humour and I was very near  imitating the Person who for want of a Chair sate down upon his Cloak I no sooner came into the Room than the Interpreter read a Paper to me containing the Examination of the foregoing Day and I was directed to sign it I answered I would never set my Hand to a Writing in a Language I did not understand The Reply was it is the Custom of the Country if it be so said I it is a very scandalous one and indeed supposing I had been as criminal as they pretended it would have been contrary to all Law to condemn me on such an Evidence The Secretary insisted upon my signing it I opposed it for some Time alledging such Reasons as might have convinced him of his Ignorance and how little I valued these Proceedings However at length seeing no other Way to get out of his Clutches I consented I asked him if he had let the Governour know I desired to be admitted to his Presence he said he had I likewise desired him if I was to be detained any Time at  Muscow  that he would endeavour to procure me another Prison that in which I was being very unbeseeming a Prisoner of State he said he would speak about it To conclude at leaving him I let him know I should be very glad to have a Barber to which he replied it was Time enough for that an Answer worthy of a Secretary of  Muscovy  in Return for which I ought to have spit in his Face The  Muscovites  are still so enraged that  Peter  the  Great  obliged them to cut off their Beards that not daring to have them themselves they will oblige Strangers to let theirs grow It is likewise a Custom that as soon as a Man is accused of any Crime he does not touch his Beard afterwards but affects a suppliant Air to excite Compassion in his Judges Perhaps these Gentlemen thought to make me conform to this Custom and in one Respect they had there Will because I never could get a  Barber But they did not gain so much over me to make me appear before them as a Suppliant  I expected I should have been sent away that Day or the next for  Petersburg  but they are rarely so expeditious in  Muscovy  They let me pass the Remainder of the Day very peaceably without offering me any Thing to eat I was obliged to provide at my own Expence and to see my self robbed with Impunity by those whose Care it was to buy my Provisions I believe I have told you already Sir that the  Muscovites  are very great Thieves But I had almost forgot to let you know that at my Meals I was forced to be contented with two Spoons instead of a Knife and Fork This manner of treating Prisoners in  Muscovy  gave me often an Opportunity of jesting with the Soldiers and those who were about me tho I understood very little of their Language  The Governour did not desire to see me till the th and then more out of Curiosity than any other Motive When I was introduced to him he was sitting with two others at a great Table with his Back to the Door I came in at And when I drew near him he continued still in the same Posture being contented with turning his Head and looking at me over his Shoulder He immediately ordered the  Italian  Interpreter who was present to ask me several Questions As for his two Companions I could not perceive they so much as moved or once turned their Eyes towards me Having answered the Governour's Questions I bid the Interpreter tell him I could hardly believe it was with his Knowledge I was treated in a Manner so little becoming my Quality that I begged of him he would allot me another Prison for that I could have no Rest where I was and besides was exposed to be the Scoff of the whole Town Upon which he spoke to the Secretary but I could not understand  any thing he said To dismiss me he at length gave me a gracious Nod  It is plain our Author had not traveled much among the  Northern  Grandees who are so used to treat their Vassals in this Manner that they are very apt to forget themselves and treat others and sometimes their Equals with this familiar Nods And that not in  Muscovy  only  But as I did not seem to understand these apish Tricks he was constrained at length to tell me by the Mouth of the Interpreter that I must retire And thus ended this formal Appearance which I was forced to make before the Governour of the Great City of  Muscow  I do not doubt but you have seen the Play called  Arlichin finto Prencipe  Imagine you see me received much with the same Grimaces as  Harlequin  receives his People with and that the Discourse which passed was not much unlike that of the Illustrious Buffoon I have just mentioned The Farce which followed did not in the least deviate from the Absurdity of that which preceeded it But I must give you a Skitch of it  The same Evening they carried me to another Prison which was a Piece of antient Ruins that served as a Shelter for those People whose Business it was to break the Ice and to cleanse the Streets from Snow and Dirt In this Prison was a little Room which was allotted for me my Guard of or Soldiers and or Dust or rather Dirt men who had already taken Possession This Change which I was to take as a Favour too surprized me strangely but my Wonder soon ceased when I was informed that Signor  Harlequin  himself had ordered it I placed my self as conveniently as I could in a Corner where during the whole Time I was forced to stay there I was almost suffocated with Smoke and Heat While I was in this Dungeon a little Adventure happened to me which may make you laugh One Day not knowing how to employ my Time it came into my Head to clean my Teeth But as I had neglected it a long while I  could not do it without making my Gums bleed My Guard the most stupid of Human Species were very attentive to what I was doing but could not tell what to think of the Operation After having frequently asked one another what it meant they at length ventured to draw nearer and examine the Instruments I made use of As I had some SteelPens which probably they took for Launcets and they saw Blood they endeavoured to hinder me I laughed at their Stupidity but I was forced to make a great many Signs before I could prevail on them to let me go on One Scene more and then I shall shift the Decorations But unhappily for me I shall be obliged  induere Cothurnum  The th which if I mistake not is the Feast of St  Andrew  I had a Visit again from my Scissars Merchant in Company with another Person They made a long Speech in which I heard the Names of the Empress and the Governour mentioned But all that I could comprehend of it was that they came to make me a Present however he who was Chief in the Commission held it so close in his Hand and kept at such a Distance that it was impossible for me to distinguish what it consisted of At length drawing nearer towards him I suddenly seized his Hand and found a single Ruble in it Far from vouchsafing to accept of such a Present I only thanked them and said I never received Money of any body One of my Guards surprized to see me refuse so considerable a Present drew near and pushing me pretty roughly cried  Take it Take it Fool that thou art  They pressed me to accept of it but finding me obstinate in my Refusal they walked off with their Present  Could you ever have imagined I should be reduced to the Condition of having a Crown offered me And do you think it possible such a Present  should be made to a Person of my Birth in the Name of the Empress of  Russia  It would be ridiculous to believe this Offer was made me by Order from Her Majesty and if it came from the Governour I leave you to judge of his Character  The d of  December  two Hours before Day they came to tell me I must rise and depart immediately It was to no Purpose to consider they put me instantly into a Sled without giving me Time to recollect without any Regard to the Rigour of the Season and without allowing me to make necessary Provision for such a Journey I was guarded by three Rascals one of whom called himself a Sergeant and the other two Soldiers tho they had neither the Habit nor Arms nor any Thing else to distinguish them as such Before I went out I asked for my Sword which had disappeared and was told it was locked up in my Trunk Do not forget I beseech you this Circumstance Because it has some Relation to that of the Key of this same Trunk of which I shall have Occasion to speak hereafter  As we stopped in the  Slaboda  There are two large  Slabodas  or Suburbs without the MudWall which encloses all the four Towns or Divisions that together make the whole City of  Muscow  One of these is called the  German  the other the  Strelitz Slaboda  I took Care to furnish my self there with what was necessary that I should not have found elsewhere While I was thus employed one of my Soldiers who was upon Duty with a great Scimitar in his Hand had the Assurance to insult and talk saucily to me To punish him for his Insolence I immediately wrested a Stick out of the Hands of the Corporal and offered to strike him This Shew of chastizing him was sufficient to make him retreat ten Paces from me and this Coward was afterwards the most humble and the most submissive of my Guard The Brutality of the  Muscovites  ought always to be reproved  in this Manner Shew your Teeth to these Cowardly Wretches and you soon have them creeping at your Feet  When I left  Muscow  I was in perfect Health But two Days after I was seized with a Distemper which I thought would have laid me in the Grave It was a Sort of a Cholick in the Stomach attended with intolerable Pain convulsive Motions and a continual Propensity to vomit You may judge in what a melancholy State I was then in obliged to travel in a Sled in the Depth of Winter and destitute of all Relief The first Stage we came at I had immediate Recourse to some Remedies I carried with me I had  VeniceTreacle  some  Eaudes Carmes  and a certain Balsam which is accounted an excellent Remedy and is distributed by the Monks of St  Justin  to their Friends All these Remedies I applied in a Moment without the least Success My Distemper continued with an astonishing Violence and without the least Intermission From my Stomach the Pains descended into my Bowels my Convulsions became more violent and my Retchings to vomit increased every Moment In this sad Extremity instead of being quite dispirited I thought it expedient to double the Dose of my Medicines but still without receiving the least Benefit by them After having suffered inexpressible Torments for or Hours together I was seized with the most burning Thirst which obliged me to drink a prodigious Quantity of Water My Pain continued with the same Violence I had only a small Evacuation downwards  The miserable Condition I was in did not hinder my Guard from proposing to depart I was sorced to submit to my Destiny and throw my self into the Arms of Providence As I was devoured with Thirst I took several Bottles of Water before my Departure I was often obliged to stop by the  Way to ease Nature and I always observed that my Stools were of divers Colours and that I voided Blood To compleat the Misfortune we had like all to have perished in the most melancholy manner in the World One Night when we were crossing the River  Wolkowa  I suddenly heard a loud Voice repeating three Times  Keep back  Upon Enquiry what was the Matter we found that two Sleds and Horses laden with Money were just fallen in at the very Place where we were The Sled in which my Goods were run a great Hazard being the foremost of our Train but fortunately we had all Time to retreat and afterwards took another Way  But to return to my Illness give me leave to make some Conjectures on that Head which to me seem but too well grounded of which however I leave you to be the sole Judge My intent is to mark out to you the real Cause of so fatal a Distemper and I firmly believe it to have been the Effect of Poison given me I shall give you my Reasons for it in the Sequel in the mean Time I desire you to give some Attention to the following Reflections Before my Illness I was of a hail robust Constitution and at my Departure from  Muscow  I was in a State of perfect Health I did not know that I ever eat or drunk any Thing that could be the Cause of such Symptoms Nor is there any more Probability that any Species of Poison should have accidentally been mixed with my Food I cannot therefore be persuaded but that my Guard out of an execrable Design themselves endeavoured to take away my Life by Poison  In the Night between the th and th I arrived in a very piteous Condition at a large Suburb about a Quarter of a League's Distance from  Petersburg  The House where we took our Quarters had neither Eggs nor any Thing else to eat so I was  obliged to put up with a Piece of brown Bread which I found upon the Table I passed the whole Night under great Uneasiness and without any Rest my Distemper obliging me to get up every Moment  Thus ended my painful Journey from  Muscow  to  Petersburg  where I hope to find all the Assistance I stand in need of and in a short Time to see all my Misfortunes at an End These Hopes are so powerful that methinks I am already in some Measure eased of my Pain What is your Opinion of it Sir do you believe I shall find my self mistaken I must confess I do not esteem  Petersburg  as a City of  Muscovy  I look upon this Capital as the Residence of one of the most mighty Monarchs in the whole World crouded with Foreigners the greater Part of whom have the Direction of the most important Affairs I expect speedily to be lodged in a Palace which is opposite to that of the Sovereign and in which the wisest Ministers assemble I flatter my self with the Hopes of being treated there in such a Manner that I shall entirely lose the Remembrance of what is past Depend on it Sir I shall not delay giving you an Account of every Thing being persuaded that you will expect it with the utmost Impatience  Nam tibi sollicito nova res mollitur ad aures  Accidere et nova se species ostendere rerum  LETTER IV  SIR  _I Cannot but acknowledge with the utmost Gratitude the many Obligations you lay me under By your last I perceive that your Friendship to me encreases daily that you bemoan my Absence that you are sensibly affected with what ever befals me and in fine that you pity my Misfortunes which you wish to see speedily ended These lively Tokens of a Friendship the most sincere without Doubt merit a Retaliation from my Hands Be assured then that you are to me the dearest Person living and that nothing can afford me so much Comfort in my present unhappy State as the Hopes of embracing soon or late so valuable a Friend You are pleased to observe that neither my Imprisonment nor my Sufferings have made me forget the  Latin  Tongue and that you take a Pleasure in the Perusal of those Verses which I sometimes quote in that Language As you seem Sir to relish this Way of Writing I will not in the Sequel fail to give you that Satisfaction And am only sorry that I have not a Library at Command for then I should find it more easy to send you elegant  Latin  than bad  French  In the mean Time as I am lost to all Ambition so neither am I in a Humour to give my self the least Trouble either for the one or the other if therefore my Letters are written in a cold flagging Stile you may freely say  Didicit jam bona verba loqui  and if the Expressions are low and the Diction incorrect I must plead as an Excuse that I'm a Stranger to the Language I write in As you seem fond of  Latin  I must beg Leave to tell you that  De qua scribebam barbara terra fuit  I shall begin my Account of this Country by telling you that we made our Entry into  Petersburg  on the th of  December  A Thaw had made the Roads at that Time very deep and when we reached the River which we were to pass we were obliged to halt no one being suffered to cross it Guards were even placed at all the most frequented Passes to obstruct the Passage of Drunkards which Appellation is generally due to half and sometimes to the whole City After a stay of two Hours without knowing what my Fate would be I was ordered to pass the River and my Guard shewed me on the opposite Side a House called the SenateHouse whither I was to go I was really ashamed of the Condition I found my self in when I stepped out of my Sled and leave you to judge what a Figure I must have made after what I had undergone My Passage over this River seemed in Comparison with the Trial I had undergone in crossing the  Wolga  only a pleasant Step through the GravelWalks of a Garden or on an Arched Roof I was no sooner landed on the opposite Banks than the Soldiers who were posted there to stop up the Passes presented their Bayonets and enjoined me to return from whence I came But upon the pressing Instances of the Sergeant who had accompanied me I was at last permitted to pass  They conducted me immediately to the Hall of the SenateHouse which was crowded with Persons of all Ranks After having waited some Time  there I was led to another little Apartment where I could hardly stand upright and informed by Signs that I must take up my Habitation there At the Remonstrance of the Soldiers who were on Guard I was however directed to a Chamber where I found a Score of Clerks five or six Soldiers and Crowds of other People No sooner had I entered this Room than an Officer pointed to a Corner and said to me  There's thy Lodging  The manner with which he uttered these Words shewed he had a secret Pleasure in having an imprisoned Foreigner in his Custody He asked whether I had any Money for if I had none I should be supplyed with Beer and Bread If you was in my Case thought I with my self you would fare very hard  Being left to the Custody of a Soldier who guarded me Sword in Hand I lay down on my Mattress to take a little Rest I was so overwhelmed with Grief that I was hardly capable of reflecting on the Situation I was in Some Slaves brought at the same Time my Goods all but my Trunk and whatever else they thought proper to rob me of At noon every one retired and I was left only with my Guard who were of the Regiment of  Astracan  Soon after came in the Sergeant who gave some Orders to my Guard and I perceived I was to be under his Inspection I let him know I wanted somebody I could speak to having Occasion to buy some Victuals He promised to grant my Request the next Morning But as I found that the People of this Country seemed unacquainted with the Proverb  Venter non patitur dilationem  I gave Money to one of the Soldiers to fetch me Bread and Wine which he did Having some Sugar I made a Toast and sweetned the Wine which had been my greatest Relief during the whole Journey  At DayBreak the next Morning my Apartment was again crowded with Clerks and other People  The little Corner where I was streightned for want of Room was the AntiChamber of a Secretary who came in and having fixed his Eyes on me in an insolent Manner passed by without saluting me He went into his Office and returned instantly to order an Officer of the Guards then present not to suffer me to be at the Window or to go into the Secretary's Office He kept his Hat on whilst he gave these Orders to the Officer to whom he spoke with an Air of Superiority that surprized me This Carriage occasioned me to think that the Gentlemen who are at the Head of the  Muscovite  Troops are probably ignorant how they expose the Honour of their Regiments by subjecting them to the Injunctions of such Wretches  I waited in the mean Time with great Impatience for the Interpreter they had promised me I acquainted the Sergeant who came to see me with my Desire and he assured me that he would immediately send me one I met with the same Answer to my Demand for a Barber But notwithstanding these repeated Assurances I saw neither one nor t'other The Door of an adjoining Apartment being open and no one there my Curiosity induced me to go in but I was ordered to retire and I was obliged to obey I met with the same Order when I approached a Window but having little Regard to such Impertinences I gave them to understand that if they would hinder me from looking out at the Windows they must wall them up This Answer put a Stop to all further Uneasiness on that Head I passed the Night quietly enough but when I waked found myself benum'd from Head to Foot and not able to stir for some Time This Accident revived the Suspicion I entertained before of being poisoned Which mysterious Scene of Iniquity I shall explain to you more at large in the Sequel at present I must inform you of what passed at my Levee  I was hardly up when the Sergeant came into my Chamber and desired me to prepare for going out I was very soon ready and met at the Bottom of the Stairs a Secretary who made Signs to me to follow him This Officer was to conduct me to the Empress's Palace situate on the other Side of the River Notwithstanding that the Ice appeared to me very strong yet few were willing to pass over it But a large Number of Planks were laid upon it which rendered the Passage entirely safe When I came to the Palace I was carried into an AntiChamber crowded with People A LookingGlass which was in that Apartment gave me an Opportunity of seeing what a Figure I made But I was highly mortified to find my self so nearly resembling a Savage Another Object which at the same Time offered itself to my View soon dispelled this little Uneasiness I saw the Sergeant who had guarded me from  Moscow  to  Petersburg  in a much worse Condition than my self One would have thought this poor Wretch just come from the Rack I beg Sir you would not forget this Circumstance which I shall have Occasion to remind you of in the Sequel  Whilst my Mind was employed in forming Conjectures about what might have happened to my Sergeant I was sent for to a small Apartment where I saw two Lords sitting at a Table and at some Distance another Person likewise sitting on a low Stool The former were the two PrimeMinisters of her  Czarian  Majesty the one a Foreigner and the other a  Muscovite  and the third who sat at some Distance was the AttorneyGeneral I drew near to the Table as well as my Legs would let me for they were scarce in a Condition to obey my Orders  Sed vires animus dabat  The Foreign Minister who is a Man of a noble Appearance broke Silence and asked me in  French  who I was I acquainted him with my Name and told him at the same Time how much I was ashamed to appear before him in so mean a Condition He then asked some other insignificant Questions to which I answered as well as I could An Abstract of these Interrogations you will find in a Memorial which I shall take Care to send you  The  Muscovite  Minister kept a profound Silence during the Conversation I had with the other and did not so much as lift up his Eyes He is a Man of an enormous Size and wore a Peruke with a Bag as remarkably small The comical Figure this diminutive Peruke made on the Head of so big a Man was such that on any other Occasion I should unaavoidibly have burst out into Laughter and might justly have applyed to him these Words  Atque supercilio brevior comoe  As for the AttorneyGeneral his Function seemed to be no other than that of hearing what was said The PrimeMinister continued in the mean Time to examine me and enquired into the Motives that induced me to leave  France  I answered that it was to avoid a Marriage which I should have been obliged to contract had I made any longer Stay in that Country To this he answered that I must surely be more scrupulous than People generally are in  France  adding these very Words  Sir you might have married the Person you speak of and need not have been destitute of Means to rid your self of her afterwards  Notwithstanding my extream Weakness at these Words I retreated a Step or two backwards  hic vires indignatio dedit  He recollected himself when he saw the Surprize I was in and endeavoured to explain his Meaning He told me that I might have been divorced from this Wife in a legal Way very common especially in  France  and added several other Circumstances all tending to illustrate what he had before said I should be glad to know whether  he would have advised me to hang my self in hopes of somebody's coming to cut me down  After he had made some farther Enquiry into my Affairs to which I replyed in few Words I was ordered to go out and wait in the AntiChamber As in my Examination I had mentioned the Son of Count  de Munich  who I thought might know me having seen me in foreign Countries it was thought proper to send for him and when he came he was placed behind a Door through which he took a View of me A very necessary Caution certainly What Harm would it have been if they had let him come nearer that he might have seen and spoken to me It would have been much more easy to him to have known me in the Condition I was then in by my Voice than by my doleful Aspect My Beard was at that Time of two Months Growth I had a Peruke on combed in the  Turkish  Fashion and a very ragged Cloak Count  de Munich  's Son had to be sure never seen me in such an Equipage and consequently could not be supposed to know me After they had got what Information they thought necessary the same Minister who had all along discoursed with me drew nearer and asked the Name of the Person who had been the Cause of all my Misfortunes This Question highly surprized me and I wonder I had not answered  Et osi di viltà tentare Argante  I was however contented with replying with a disdainful Smile that I could not believe he expected I should answer him That he could not be ignorant of the Respect due to the Sex though they often might not deserve it I thought proper before I retired to beg he would take Notice of my infirm State of Health after so tedious a Sickness and of the strange Usage I had met with from the first Day of my Imprisonment He gave me no other Answer than this  It is your own Fault Sir we shall proceed as favourably as we can  Reflect I beseech you on this whole Procedure But in order to inform you rightly of the State of Things it will be necessary to acquaint you with what I could learn of the  Muscovite  Ministry It is certain that all the grand Affairs transacted at present at the Court of  Russia  are under the Direction of Ministers who are Foreigners and though out of Decency they are likewise communicated to two or three Natives of the Country it is nevertheless beyond all Doubt that the Power is only in the Hands of the Former And they are so jealous of their Authority and know so well how to support one another that the  Muscovites  are only looked on as Subalterns who dare not undertake any Thing without their previous Advice and Consent In all Consultations that Minister who examined me presides But tho he has a great Share in the Decision of important Matters yet I believe it does not appertain solely to him The others are Lords of the Court who assist at Councils Conferences Audiences of foreign Ministers and are consulted in all Concerns which are of any Moment As the  Muscovites  are naturally suspicious diffident and imagine that there is not a Person in the World whose Integrity can be relied on there is always some Overseer every where which is the Reason that even those Things which require the utmost Secrecy are treated of in the Presence of several Persons How far this is advantageous or prejudicial to the State is not my Province to determine All I know is that the wisest Man in  Muscovy  tho never so well inclined to serve his Country would find it difficult to succeed in any Attempt because the continual Suspicions and Diffidence he would meet with with Regard to himself must discourage him and make him lose that Freedom of Mind and Sentiments which is so necessary to terminate Affairs that require a ready Execution  Let me now inform you of what I have learned of the second Class of Ministers who are the Senators The Senate consists of  Muscovite  Noblemen of the first Rank and such as pass for Men of a great Genius and thorough Knowledge of Business Among these there are some who have served the State in the Quality of Ambassadors to foreign Courts others who have been Generals in the Army and some who have travelled through a great Part of  Europe  I cannot inform you of the exact Number of the Senators but am assured from good Hands it is but small I know six or seven of them with whom I have had some Concerns They have a great Number of Secretaries who are the most ignorant the most insolent and at the same Time the most presumptuous Animals the Earth ever bore These have under their Command a prodigious Troop of Clerks who seem to be always employed Add to this the Multitude of petty Officers who go indeed by the Name of Soldiers but may be placed among the lowest Dregs of the Vulgar and are the very Scum of the People Of all these consists that August Assembly called the Senate As for the respective Functions of each of these Officers they themselves are frequently so ignorant of them that it is no Wonder if a Stranger is so All I can say on that Head is that they generally meet four or five Hours a Day that they take a great deal of Pains themselves and give no less to others without advancing the Interests of the State The Custom of this Nation of deferring every Thing to the Morrow is the Occasion that most Affairs are not terminated till after many Delays This Remissness is a natural Consequence of the mutual Distrusts they entertain of each other for as they cannot venture to deliver their Opinions with an entire Freedom they are often necessitated to defer the most urgent Affairs to another Time The Door of  this illustrious  Areopagus  might be properly adorned with the following Device  Hic operose nihil agitur  But this is not all There is a third Order of Ministers if they may be allowed that Denomination who compose what they call the Colleges these Colleges are divided into different Classes There is the College of War that of Foreign Affairs those of Finances and Commerce and several others As I have had nothing to do with these Gentlemen I can hardly give you any Account of their several Functions I am nevertheless pretty confidently assured that all the Members of these Bodies as well that of the Senate as those who compose the Colleges are only regarded as bare Commissioners or Deputies under the Influence of the Ministers who are Foreigners and are esteemed their Oracles Nothing can be done without previously consulting or receiving the Orders of these and all the others live in the most servile Fear and Subjection The Governours of Provinces dare hardly ever undertake any Thing of their own Accord and are even ignorant how far their Authority and Jurisdiction extends Their natural Timidity and the entire Dependance they are always kept in occasion even Trifles to pass with them for Matters of the greatest Importance  This in a few Words is what I have been able to learn of the Form of Government established in  Muscovy  I thought it necessary to give you this Abstract  Per quae possis cognoscere caetera tuté  The Fate of the  Muscovites  would deserve our Pity had they any generous Passions or any Honour  at Heart In process of Time they may perhaps shake off the Yoke imposed on them by Foreigners and then perhaps we may see  Muscovian  Vespers as we have formerly seen  Sicilian  Vespers Their Hatred of Foreigners is so great that in this Case hardly one would escape with Life It would be the more easy to execute an Enterprize of this Kind as the Authority Foreigners have assumed is only founded on a slavish Fear into which the whole Nation is immerged  Peter  I who used his utmost Endeavours to draw his Subjects out of Barbarity having in his Travels in  France  at the Time of the Regency made Enquiries into the then Form of Government framed and in Part executed the Project of regulating his own after that Model He proposed by establishing so many Councils to employ in the Administration all those of his Subjects who should be most capable of it that in Time they might render themselves useful to their Prince and Country I know not what Idea to frame of such a Form of Government which seems not the most suitable to so despotick a State as that of  Muscovy  It will I fear in Time produce many Disorders and insensibly tinge the Commonalty with  Republican  Principles  We have already seen the Seeds of such Notions at the Death of  Peter  II for a Motion was then made to form the Government into a Commonwealth If this Project had taken Place we should have seen a Plan of Government very different from that of  Plato  A  Muscovian  Republick It would without doubt have been a MasterPiece But was  Peter  the  Great  with all his fine Schemes and Establishments sufficiently acquainted with the Genius of his Subjects I have great Room to doubt it and this is my Reason There is not to this Day a single  Muscovite  who is not  betrer pleased with his Village and his Oven than with the most eminent Post of Honour They would have been better pleas'd if  Peter  the Great instead of attempting to change Beasts as they were into Men had on the contrary labour'd to reduce them from a State of Humanity to that of Brutes All the Pains that Prince took have hardly had any Effect on his Subjects farther than the curtailing their Beards and a Change of their Habits Their favourite Idols are Fire and Laziness to which they are ready to sacrifice their All But I have said enough on this Article and shall now resume the Account of my own Adventures  At my Return to my Prison the Sergeant who accompany'd me thither offer'd me half a Ruble to furnish my self as he said with some Provisions I told him I had no Occasion for his Money and begg'd he would rather send me an Interpreter and a Barber He left me but I could not obtain what I ask'd for I wish'd for nothing so much in the Condition I was then in as to consult some Physician and to be lodg'd in a more commodious Prison where I might enjoy that Repose and Tranquility I stood in so great need of As my Distemper continued I begun to fear some fatal Event Though I was eased of the most virulent Pains and strove to support Nature with the best Diet I could yet I was still very weak I had entirely lost two of my Senses Taste and Smell A Thirst which nothing could allay prey'd upon me incessantly All these Symptoms did not put me under any Apprehensions of my Life but I was afflicted with others still more grievous A general Numbness seized all my Limbs after Sleep and when I awaked I found my self depriv'd of all Motion My Head was then troubled with an uncommon Heaviness My Sight likewise underwent a great Change for all Objects appeared to me double  These Symptoms disappeared insensibly after I had lain some Time in that deplorable Condition but then a kind of Restlessness ensued for which I could not assign any Cause I applied from Time to Time my own Medicines but tho I am well assured that 'tis to them I owe my Life yet could I not perceive that they produced any visible Effect  As I constantly reiterated my Entreaties for an Interpreter a young Man was at last brought to me who spoke  French  and was accompanied by the Sergeant and an Overseer which they always think requisite in the like Cases As it was my Design that he should give a faithful Account of what I had to say to him I desired him to take it down in Writing  viz  "That no one might have Cause to censure my Conduct I declared that when Money was offer'd me of which I should be ashamed to specify the Value I did not think fit to accept of it not knowing from whose Hands it came and being besides assured that Her Majesty would never offer me a Present so little agreable to Her great Generosity I doubted not but that if Her Majesty would be pleased to issue Her Orders to procure me the Sustenance I stood in Need of it would be in a Manner suitable to her Dignity and my Birth but should it be signified to me that whatever was offered was by Her Order I should always receive it with the greatest Deference All the Assistance which Her Majesty might in the mean Time vouchsafe to lend me would be of little Service to me unless I was removed from the Prison where I was as I could not enjoy any Rest there either by Day or by Night and unless I was in the mean while supplied with what was requisite for the Recovery of my Health which at that time was in so dangerous a Situation that I run the Hazard of  sinking very soon under the Weight of my Miseries Should these Precautions on my Behalf be neglected Her Majesty would lose an Opportunity of punishing me if I were a Criminal or on the other Hand if my Innocence were proved she would have the Regret of seeing a Man perish miserably under her Eyes who came into her Dominions with no other View but of devoting the Rest of his Days to her Service To conclude there was nothing I said but what I had Room to hope from Her Majesty's Justice and Clemency"  In this Memorandum I likewise particularised all those Things which I stood absolutely in Need of  viz  another Prison a Physician my Trunk and a Person who might on all Occasions serve me as an Interpreter My Clerk promised to give a faithful Account of all I had dictated to him I asked why they would not suffer me to be shaved to which he replied that they feared I might make an Attempt upon my own Life  My Memorandum had no farther Success but to procure the Change of my Prison three Days afterwards when I was removed into the Secretary's Apartment who was obliged to shift his Quarters this new Lodging gave me a little more Ease tho some Clerk or other was every Day running in and out for Papers which had been left there But on the other Hand I was tormented with a vast Number of every Kind of Insects that commonly frequent the most odious and filthy Places I had every Moment the Company of huge Rats that consumed whatever I could procure for myself and all the Furniture I had in this Secretary's Office which I might justly call a Nest of Rats was two Chairs and a Table without a Carpet  This Change of Prison did not therefore afford me the least Relief My Sickness encreased daily and I  saw no Hopes of any Succour I remember the th which was  ChristmasEve  being extreamly ill in my Bed the Sergeant brought me a very large Goose and a Fowl and gave me to understand that this Present was sent me by Her Imperial Majesty I answered that the Condition I was then in required other Succour and desired him to send me with all Speed a Physician and take his Present back with him But he left it notwithstanding all I could say and retired I gave them to my Guard to dispose of as they thought fit and make themselves merry but I found they durst not touch them The same Officer returned the next Morning and made a great Bustle because they had let those Provisions be spoiled instead of carrying them away I thought this a proper Time to make lively Expostulations with him about my Trunk where all my Linnen was which I stood the more in Need of as I was eat up with Vermin He took little Notice of what I said but walk'd off with the Goose and Fowl  The Refusal of my Trunk which I had so long and so pressingly desired was not without some Cause Several Circumstances made me suspect that they had robbed me of Part of what it contained and strove now to conceal it Theft is well known to be so common in  Muscovy  that no one is ashamed of it Great and Small Men and Women lay hold without any Scruple of the Property of another wherever they meet with it Hence it is that People are always upon their Guard and live in this Country in a continual Diffidence of each other  Peter  I was wont to say that if he was to hang all the Thieves in his Dominions he should be destitute of Subjects My Suspicions were still farther grounded by the Detention of the Key of my Trunk at  Muscow  and by my seeing the Sergeant who had conducted me  into the  Czarina  's Palace where he appeared like a Criminal on whom Sentence was just going to be pronounced These several Considerations induced me to believe that I had been robbed and that to conceal the Fact and avoid the Hands of Justice they had attempted to poison me Their Proceedings in Regard to me in the Sequel will give you very strong Proofs of what I here advance  You will without doubt be shocked at the Perusal of these Circumstances of my Adventures Had not my Courage supported me in the doleful Condition I was in I must have inevitably perished I should a thousand Times have sunk under the Load of my Calamities had I not preserved a perfect Peace of Mind amidst my greatest Distresses I perceived my self often at the Point of Death destitute of all Relief and of all Hopes of receiving any Nothing afflicted me more than the Reflection of being sacrific'd as I was to the Fury and unjust Resentments of a Savage Nation which having not the least Sense of Humanity treated me as the most abject of Slaves Nevertheless in the midst of these Perplexities  Neque ullam vocem protuli indignam viro neque cedentem calamitati  I leave you to judge after having weighed these Circumstances what Idea the World ought to form of this Nation which at present makes so much Noise in  Europe  whose Alliance is so earnestly sought for and which claims a Right to the Disposal of Kiugdoms  Spes improbissimas complectuntur insperata assecuti  LETTER V  SIR  _I must not omit begging your Excuse for the abrupt Manner with which I concluded my last My Head was at that Time filled with such melancholy Ideas and my Heart perplexed with Motions so extraordinary that I fancied my Hand was growing heavy and my Ink appeared more black than it really was These Symptoms made me resolve upon taking some Repose for whatever I write to you shall as far as possible be the Product of a Mind at Ease and by no Means of an impetuous Imagination Not that I am fearful of being too severe in my Censures of the  Muscovites  who certainly deserve no Mercy But as I engaged in this Correspondence with no other View than that of satisfying your Curiosity I am not so much intent on seeking Revenge for the Injuries done me by that Nation as on informing you of what you desire to know of my Adventures To continue my Narrative of them I must therefore tell you that after I had been left to struggle with Death for the Space of ten Days a Physician was at last brought me by the Sergeant and an Overseer This Physician happened unfortunately to speak nothing but  Latin  which gave me a great deal of Uneasiness For though I am pretty well versed in that Language yet I found it difficult to express my Thoughts as I had never made made Use of it in familiar Discourse I therefore immediately told my Physician that since I should hardly be able to give him the true Grounds of my  Disease I had Cause to fear he might not apply proper Medicines nor give me that Assistance I stood in Need of He replyed by this Axiom which he faid was unquestionable  Omnes Captivi infirmitatibus laborant  this unpromising Beginning exasperated me  indignatio dedit Linguam  I answered him in as Philosophical Manner  Non doleo de captivitate sed de modo captivitatis  I continued my Harangue in the same Tone but in a  Latin  Idiom as barbarous as the Country I was in The Doctor however not thinking me perhaps so tractable as blindly to submit to his Prescriptions thought fit to retire And this was all the Benefit I received from his Visit  An Accident happened some Time after which contributed not a little to confirm the Suspicions I had of my having been poisoned But give me leave to put you in mind of the following Circumstances before I inform you of what passed First the Key of my Trunk which was demanded and I was forced to surrender at  Muscow  In the second Place my Sword which was likewise taken from me at  Muscow  and locked up in the Trunk and lastly my Trunk itself which had been detained from the th of  December  the Day of my Arrival at  Petersburg  'till the th of  January  My Trunk was that Day brought into my Prison guarded by several petty Officers a Secretary some Clerks and an Overseer The Secretary having first saluted me with a smiling Countenance demanded the Key of the Trunk I answered that I had the same Demand upon him Seemingly surprized at this Answer he spoke to those who were present as if he was enquiring what was become of the Key  Several Questions and Answers ensued which tended only to delude and blind me till at last the Key appeared They begun then by unlocking  the Padlock but as it was sealed one of the Clerks addressing himself to the Secretary and by his Looks expressing his Surprize said  Sir here are two Seals Yes  replied the Secretary the better to conceal his Villany  there are two one of Casan and the other of Muscow  The Trunk was at last opened where I found every Thing in Disorder I took out my Pistols and my Sword which could not be there but by a very great Miracle as they must have been put in without taking off the Seal of  Casan  I told the Secretary that my Arms were useless to a Prisoner and would have put them into his Hands But he answered they must be left in the Trunk which he would shut himself It appeared to me somewhat extraordinary that I should be debarred the Use of my Cloaths for all I could obtain was three or four Shirts which I stood in great need of They even refused me with the utmost Barbarity some  Eau des Carmes  and other Medicines The Secretary having first locked the Trunk assured me that I should be supplied with common Necessaries by Orderm and at the Expence of her Majesty and then retired  These Circumstances duly weighed it will be easy to determine whether I was really poisoned or not I should even be glad if on this Subject you would consult all the Physicians and natural Philosophers of your Acquaintance who will not in a case so singular refuse to give you their Opinion For my Part I should be glad to have my Suspicions removed by a Demonstration that my Disease could be the Effect of any other Cause than Poison but beg you would first maturely and leisurely consider the following Circumstances  In my last you may remember I observed that the  Muscovites  are very prone to Theft and that it is a Vice common to the whole Nation Hence I may infer the Probability of their embracing the first  Opportuni y that offered of robbing me That this Conjecture comes nearly up to Truth is but too evident by the Key of my Trunk being taken from me at  Muscow  And I may reasonably ask what Occasion there was to search my Trunk at all It had already been looked into at  Casan  and was besides closely sealed Had Curiosity been their sole Inducemen sor viewing my Effects they might have gratified it in my Presence But there are still other Circumstances My Trunk was seized on my Arrival at  Peersburg  without any apparent Cause and the Sergeant who had brought me thither appeared at the  Czarina  's Palace in the Posture of a Criminal In Order to account for this Person's Fate you must know that my Trunk was opened as soon as it was brought to  Petersburg  and that after having compared the Contents with the Inventory sent from  Casan  Part of the Things specified in the last was sound to be wanting The Sergeant was immediately supposed to be the Thief or at least an Accomplice in the Robbery The Trunk was therefore to be detained till the Deficiency could be repaired and some one be instantly dispatched to Muscow to recover what was stolen It is certain the Sergeant himself was directly sent back thither For when some Days after my Arrival at  Petersburg  I asked what was become of my Sled they answered the Sergeant had taken it to return to  Muscow  In short my Trunk was not returned to me till the th of  January  twentyseven Days after my Arrival at  Petersburg  a Time sufficient to go to  Muscow  to discharge the Commission which the Sergeant was entrusted with and to return to  Petersburg  These are beyond all Contradiction Probabilities which on many Occasions might pass for evident Proofs but let us examine the Affair yet farther The Secretary demanded the Key of my  Trunk when it was brought to me and endeavoured to persuade me that it had been likewise sealed at  Casan  in order to insinuate that it had not been opened since Could any Thing be more ridiculous than to imagine I had such a Stock of Credulity as to be persuaded that they had neglected a thorough View of all my Effects They were too desirous of knowing who I was and of finding some Pretence whereby to justify their Proceedings with Regard to me to omit such a Search I should likewise be glad to know what they can alledge in Respect to my Sword which the Officer of the Guards at  Casan  seemed so much pleased with which I wore till I reached  Muscow  and which at length I found in my Trunk though they pretended it had not been opened either at  Muscow  or at  Petersburg  I am certainly highly obliged to the  Muscovites  if they have found out the Secret of imparting to my Sword some of those Qualities attributed to the ThunderBolt especially that of penetrating the most solid Bodies without leaving the least Mark for then I shall hereafter be armed as powerfully as  Jove  himself What could in fine induce them to refuse me my Cloaths and to shut the Trunk so abruptly without giving me Time to examine what was in it I should not I believe deviate very far from the Truth were I to say that they proceeded in this unaccountable Manner the better to conceal the Robbery they had committed on the greatest Part of my Equipage the Want of which I was forced to bear with during the whole Time of my Captivity As I have now averred the Theft I shall find it more easy to prove that I was poisoned You may perhaps ask who were the Authors of the former Villany For your Satisfaction let it suffice that I put you in Mind of my having cast the Nativity of the Secretary of  Muscow  when the Humour took me to tell him that the Gallows would soon be his Fate  And in Reality the whole Matter must fall upon that Secretary and his Accomplices  My Sickness became in the mean while so extream and I was reduced to so feeble a State that my Guard were obliged to carry me whenever I had occasion to ease Nature I was again afflicted with a Cholick accompanied with Pains so violent that I almost begun to fear I had been poisoned a second Time This new Paroxism was however of a short Duration it left me insensibly and I found my self in better Health than I had been before The incessant Requests I had long made for a Physician were at last complied with He was accompanied by the same Clerk who had played his Legerdemain Tricks with the two Seals at the opening of my Trunk The Doctor who spoke good  Italian  immediately enquired into the Nature of my Distemper I told him that to give him a true Idea of it I could not avoid entring into several Particulars which would necessarily require his Attention After having given him an Account of my Constitution I acquainted him what befel me at my Departure from  Muscow  My Physician was every Moment interrupted by the Clerk who was present and as he had Orders to write down this whole Consultation was teazing him to know what I said he even desired us in pressing Terms to hasten to a Conclusion The Physician who had his Instructions seemed to give Way to the Secretary's Instances and before he had Time to inform himself of my Disease advised me to take a Vomit and to be blooded To this I answered that I could not prevail upon my self to follow the Advice which he gave me without informing himself of my Disease That as for the Emetick I was resolved not to take it and though I might hope for some Relief from Bleeding yet I could not with any Probability expect a Surgeon since they had refused to send me a  Barber lest I should make away with my self I then informed him of the Treatment I had met with but all the Answer he made me was that I must conform to the Customs of the Country The Clerk likewise thought fit to give me his Advice and said that Grief being my Disease I must wait my Remedy from Time and Circumstances This stung me to the quick and put me in Mind of my former Physician's Axiom To convince him of this Mistake I told him in these very Terms  "Sir my Mind has no Share in the doleful Condition I am reduced to and give me leave to tell you that a Man tho a Prisoner may enjoy a perfect Freedom of Mind But the Case is this you have neither Orders nor Leisure to hear me speak and seem but little inclined to give me that Assistance I stand so much in Need of therefore not to detain you any longer you are at Liberty to be gone All the Favour I ask of you is to tell those Gentlemen who sent you that a Patient is not relieved by the bare Sight of a Physician and that no Remedy ought to be prescribed to me till I am allowed to tell my Case Your Visits will be always agreeable and may prove highly beneficial to me if you have so much Influence as to procure me that Permission but if it be thought improper to grant me that Favour to give your self any farther Trouble seems to me entirely needless"  Whether my Physician was pleased with this Compliment I know not but the contrary seems most probable for he instantly retired and gave himself no farther Trouble about me  I continued to fare very hard notwithstanding the repeated Promises made me several Days together that I should be maintained by the Order and at the Expence of Her Imperial Majesty and I saw no signs of any thing being sent me by that Princess  The Matter was I suppose deemed so very important that it required a Respite till the Morrow This Rule is generally observed by the  Muscovites  when the Point in Debate relates to Disbursements And they are certainly right for Money is not so scarce in any other Country in the World An Interpreter at last appeared after I had long waited for him accompanied by two or three Persons who came to tell me he had Orders to provide for my Sustenance I expressed my Satisfaction at this News and told him the sooner the better But how replied he do you expect to be served How said I Just as you think fit provided it be not after the  Muscovian  Manner for their Ragoos I am not accustomed to He then consulted with those who were present and said that I might have Money allowed me and asked how much would do This Question made me laugh and I desired to know in my turn if he took me for a Person that would accept of Money I ordered him to tell his Masters that I should always with the utmost Deference and Gratitude accept of whatever should be offered me by Her Majesty's Order This Reply gave Occasion to a fresh Consultation which being ended this weighty Affair was put off to the Morrow  The Necessity I lay under of making my Case known to some able Physician put me upon writing an exact Relation of all that had happened to me to send it to Mons  du Vernoi  AnatomyProfessor You may remember the Character I have already given you of him He is a Man of Merit and one to whom I am greatly obliged At the same Time I wrote a short Memorial to the Empress wherein I complained of the Manner in which I was treated I was told they should both be safely delivered but as neither of them produced the Effect I hoped they probably were both suppressed I was even treated with more Severity than before for after this notwithstanding  all my Remonstrances I never could obtain either Physician or Interpreter either Pen and Ink or my Cloaths  That these Gentlemen acted with the utmost Injustice with Regard to me is most certain and yet they may have had their Motives to palliate those Proceedings In order to unfold this Mystery I must put you in Mind of the Hatred which the  Muscovites  bear to all Strangers who are any Expence to them This undoubted Truth is one of the Motives which induce me to believe that the Gentlemen in the Administration at  Muscow  were resolved upon my Perdition at any Rate And indeed what Necessity could there be to detain me in that City eight or ten Days Why was I at my Arrival at  Petersberg  refused the immediate Benefit of a Physician since there are so many of the Profession in that Place At last indeed they sent me one but he spoke  Latin  only and the Conversation I had with him was besides so very short that he could not possibly be informed of my Case nor apply proper Remedies As they knew I was an  Italian  and there are three or four Physicians of that Nation in the Town why was I not permitted to speak to one of them They very well knew I was conversant in the  French  Tongue why was not some one of that Nation suffered to come to me The second Physician spoke I confess the  Italian  Tongue very well but the Orders which were given to interrupt our Conversation every Moment hindered me from making my Case known They feared and very justly too that had I given an exact Account of it the Physician would have discovered the real Cause of my Distemper What can be inferred from their Refusal of letting me make Use of the Medicines I had in my Trunk They were probably afraid that those Remedies might restore my Health which they did their utmost Endeavours  to prevent The Attempt they had made on my Life would they hoped be concealed from the World by my Death The Expedient they made Use of to silence my Complaints was very odd They allowed me to write to a Physician but at the same Time intercepted my Letter because the Perusal of it might disclose a Secret which it was too much their Interest to conceal Therefore to compass their iniquitous Scheme they could use no better Means than that of leaving me alone It would perhaps be difficult to discover how the Poison was conveyed to me and to name the principal Authors of so execrable an Attempt but that they did find Means to give it me and that every  Muscovite  is justly liable to be suspected thereof are most indisputable Truths  Ad te quisquis is es nostra querela redit  I now leave you to judge whether the Report spread throughout all  Europe  of the Death of the three last Sovereigns of  Muscovy  being owing to Poison was so very groundless They will certainly find it very difficult to clear themselves from an Imputation which is but too well founded They are already known by too many iniquitous Passages not to be thought capable of any Thing In all their Proceedings they are known to consult their private Interest only and the Project they have formed of extending their Dominions has induced them to commit all kinds of Injustice in Regard to their Neighbours They have invaded the finest Countries to open their Way into  Germany  They have long since aimed at the sole Dominion of the  Baltick  The whole World is sensible of the Tyranny they exercise in  Poland  after having sowed Discord in that Kingdom And  Europe  has Reason to fear their penetrating yet farther and kindling a Flame in  other Countries as they have done in  Poland  It is the Interest of more Potentates than one to set Bounds to their Ambition and to break their Measures and it were to be wished that a Method might be speedily found of driving them back into their Forests and lurking Holes where they lived whole Ages in Obscurity As they desire nothing more earnestly than to revive their antient Customs and to live unknown to the rest of Mankind nothing could be of greater Service to them They bear so great an Aversion to the Innovations which have been attempted to be introduced among them in the last forty Years that if they were left to themselves they would soon shake off the Yoke which they think is imposed on them This Nation is fit for nothing but to be kept in Bondage and Obscurity Is it not surprizing that notwithstanding the absolute Power of their Monarchs they have hitherto been so unsuccessful in their Endeavours to render this Country flourishing in Commerce and to establish Religion and Sciences among them  Whoever should undertake to enquire into the Origin of the  Muscovites  must be greatly perplexed by this their singular Character If I could prevail upon my self to believe that there were  Preadamites  I should almost have sworn that the  Muscovites  are their Descendants And they must certainly be allowed to owe their Extraction to a Set of Men very different from any we now meet with I have after many Reflections formed a Conjecture which appears to me entirely well grounded and will I am assured notwithstanding its Novelty meet with your Approbation You cannot be ignorant of the unanimous Consent of Historians in the mention they make of this Nation that no Traces can be found of its antient State and that the profound Ignorance in which it has been always involved has rendered all Enquiries into its Original entirely  fruitless This great Difficulty has kept all Historians in Suspence and deterred them from attempting any Decision on this Article But I will lead you into the Path they should have followed and which I my self have taken in making this signal Discovery  Whenever the Origin of a People is not discoverable by any Monuments of Antiquity we must of Necessity examine their Manners and Customs and compare them with those of other Nations and especially of their Neighbours This being premised I need only put you in Mind of a Piece of History which you are not ignorant of tho you may not know how so easily to fix it to any certain Period You may remember to have read that the  Scythians  at their Return from their third Expedition in  Asia  met on the Frontiers of their Country a numerous Army ready to oppose their Entrance Their own Wives being tired of so long a State of Viduity had all agreed to throw themselves into the Arms of their Slaves and had inspired those base Lover with sufficient Courage and Strength to take up Arms The  Scythians  informed of this Procedure consulted among themselves what Course to take They imagined that to employ their Arms against their Slaves would be to debase themselves They therefore armed themselves with Scourges only and in that Manner marched against the Rebels who awed by the Presence of their Masters were immediately seized with a Panick and endeavoured to save themselves by Flight These Wretches fearful of a Pursuit penetrated very far towards the  North  into a Country then un inhabited which their Descendants still possess  If you cast your Eyes upon a Map it will instantly appear to you that the Country into which these Slaves made their Retreat must necessarily be  the same which is now known by the Name of  Muscovy  It would be derogatory from the extensive Knowledge you have in History should I here attempt to prove this Fact which is attested by all Authors who have written of the  Scythians  and their Country This great Event is likewise confirmed by an authentick Monument which we to this Day meet with in  Muscovy  for the Place to which they at first retired is still known by the Name of  the City of Slaves  Such is the Original of the  Muscovites  which none but themselves ought to regard as a Mystery You need therefore no longer think it strange that a People descended from such Ancestors has strove to remain in Obscurity by neglecting to transmit to Posterity these Titles and all other Monuments which could lead us to the Knowledge of them The  Muscovites  would thereby have discovered themselves to be not only Slaves by Birth but likewise Traitors Cowards and Rebels All these fine Qualities are still discernable in that Nation and it is well known that Slavery has been handed down among them from Father to Son without any Interruption till the present Age The Assurance wherewith they boast themselves to be Descendants of the  Scythians  may therefore be pardoned provided they mean in the Manner I have here explained  To remove all Doubts that may be raised on this Head I beg leave to add a Word or two about those  Tartars  who are Neighbours of the  Muscovites  You know without Doubt that these People are the same  Scythians  of whom several Authors make Mention and whose Exploits were formerly famous throughout the whole World These are the People who possess to this Day besides great  Tartary  the two finest Empires in the World which are  China  and  Mogul  Notwithstanding  the vast Extent of the Countries this Nation is Master of there is not a single Tribe among them but is thoroughly acquainted not only with their common Origin but likewise in particular with their own Descent They can inform you with the utmost Accuracy what Branch they are descended from Whence proceeds then so great a Difference as we here observe between two Nations bordering on each other It may be very easily explained The  Tartars  are those famous  Scythians  who glory in their Origin and the  Muscovites  are those cowardly Slaves whose Descent and Extraction have rendered them infamous  Whatever Arguments the  Muscovites  advance with a View of persuading us that they are Descendants of the  Scythians  this single Observation may almost suffice to subvert But I cannot really perceive that they have any Thing in common with that Nation The greatest Part of the modern  Tartars  on the contrary seem to have an entire Resemblance with those ancient  Scythians Justin Herodotus  and some other Authors describe the Manners and relate the brave Exploits of those Conquerors and if you compare them with what we read of the  Mungals  and  Kalmucs  you will find a very great Resemblance between those People An intrepid Courage and a surprizing Magnanimity are Qualities which we observe in the  Tartars  here mentioned but the  Muscovites  distinguish themselves only by their Cowardice and Baseness You will not find it an easy Matter Sir to meet in History with Conjectures better founded than these about the Original of the  Muscovites  therefore  si tibi vera videntur dede manus  And with this I shall conclude my Letter reserving for the next a Subject more jocose and diverting You judge very rightly that to entertain you with Matters of this Kind which  ought always to be treated not only  corpore valido  but likewise  animo sereno  I must needs put a great Constraint on my self In the mean Time  Ut qui jocularia ridens  Percurram  LETTER VI  SIR  _THE Treatment I here meet with is certainly most extraordinary The  Muscovites  perceiving that my Sickness did not put an End to my Life endeavoured by all possible Means to effect it by Hunger This would certainly have been the Event of their Barbarity had I not received timely Assistance from Mr  de L'Isle  and his Wife I shall in the Sequel have frequent Occasion to mention them both and by what I shall say of them you'll find that Ministers Generals of Armies and Warriours are not the only Persons who promote the Honour of the  French  Nation In order to apprize you fully of what I have to say it will be proper to resume the Thread of my Relation  Though my Disease was become Chronical and in a Manner incurable it was nevertheless not so violent as before and I begun to be sensible of the Necessity I lay under of taking some solid nourishing Food which might support Nature and insensibly increase my Strength All the Provisions which my Guard brought me at my own Expence were so dear and at the same Time so very bad that I resolved at last to seek for other Diet The Gentleman and Lady before  mentioned were therefore to be applied to and I found it necessary to beg of them to send me some Wine and other Provisions which I stood most in Need of As I was neither permitted to speak nor to write to any one my greatest Difficulty was how to acquaint them with my Desires I found Means at last after having given my self a great deal of Trouble to put my Project in Execution by prevailing upon a Clerk to write down whatever I should dictate to him in the  Russian  Tongue You must not wonder to find me dictating a Letter in this Tongue for Necessity is the best Master of Languages  Ingenîque largitor venter  I had begun some Time before to understand the Language of the Country pretty well and knew enough to ask for what I stood in Need of  Mr  de L'Isle  no sooner received my Letter than he sent me much more than I desired I had no Room to doubt of his being apprized of my Adventures and of my Arrival at  Petersburg  because his Brother without Doubt had advised him of my Fate And besides as I named him in my Examination it is highly probable he was likewise interrogated I have even been since informed that he was placed behind a Door to see whether he knew me Having soon consumed the Provisions sent me by Mr  De L'Isle  and what I had provided at my own Expence as they had several Times promised I should be furnished with Necessaries by Order of the Court and I saw no Effect of this Promise I thought it my Duty to expostulate pretty warmly with the Officer on that Head He answered that since I had declared my Aversion to  Muscovite  Ragoos they were extreamly at a Loss what to provide for me Little satisfied with so poor a Pretence I spoke to him in such haughty Terms as terrified him from coming near me again in haste And so it is with  the  Muscovites  in general not excepting their Soldiers when they meet with any Opposition  It is pretty extraordinary that I could never learn what they call a Man of Courage in the  Russian  Tongue I am almost inclined to think that as there is not a Man among them who has the least Valour to boast of such a Term would be entirely useless to them This Cowardice and a certain brutish Disposition equally natural to them are Qualities which I cannot well reconcile  There does not seem to be much Difficulty in reconciling them for Bullies are always Cowards  They have a Law whereby all Subjects are forbid to draw their Swords and it has been so religiously observed throughout the whole Empire that there has not been one Instance of its being violated I know not whether they have any Laws to prevent Theft but if they have they are not much enforced What Inference may we draw from this Observation May we not justly say that they are naturally inclined to Pilfering and that their Pusillanimity is the Occasion that they never draw their Swords I leave you to decide this Question and doubt not but you will be of my Opinion  In the mean Time I gave my Guard to understand that as they continued to neglect bringing me any Provisions I should find Means of being admitted to the  Czarina's  Presence and that I should make my Complaints to Her Majesty of those who refused to execute her Orders I repeated these Menaces to the whole Body of Clerks who were in my AntiChamber and my Officer venturing at last to appear again I assured him I would break the Windows and entreat Relief of those who passed by in the Street These Threats produced their Effect for the next Morning the Corporal came with a Purse in his Hand and said  that I might order what I pleased I told him I wanted Bread Wine Sugar and Meat all which he soon after brought me I gave the same Orders the next Day but found it no longer complied with One of my Guard refused to take the Money I offered him to buy what I stood in Need of pretending he had received Orders not to concern himself with any of my Commissions I was not a little surprized to hear of such an Order but was obliged to put up with it and to make shift with the Remnants of the preceding Day After this I had but very little and sometimes nothing at all to eat for some Days When it was my Fate to fast one of the Soldiers took up a  Violin  and invited me to dance saying  French  Men could forget Hunger for a Jigg This Farce diverted me for a Time but my Patience being at length tired I was again so busy with my Threats that my Soldiers brought me the same Evening a fine Piece of roasted Meat some Bread and Wine And no less a Feast than this would have sufficed to allay my voracious Appetite When my Repast was ended folding up a Piece of Paper in which some Salt had been wrapped I accidentally saw some Writing upon it Curiosity inducing me to read it I perceived it contained only some Astronomical Calculations I immediately conceived that I was obliged to Mr  De L'Isle  and his Wife for my Supper and was so enraged at this Proceeding that I made use of the most bitter Invectives to reproach the Corporal I even threatened him Her Imperial Majesty should know how her Orders were executed being assured she would reward them all with a Halter He begun to excuse himself by the Difficulty he pretended there was in pleasing me but I was so loud with my Complaints that he retired in a Pannick  Were I to relate the many Scenes I passed thro on this Account I should never have done It may suffice to tell you that all the Food I had from the th of  January  to the th of  February  were sent me by Mr  De L'Isle  This Gentleman even gave my Guard some other Necessaries but those Villains thought fit as I afterwards found to keep them for their own Use I had been in great Danger of being starved in my Prison had I not been so kindly assisted by Mr  De L'Isle  The Impossibility the  Muscovites  lie under of maintaining their Prisoners whilst they have so large a Number of Foreigners on their Hands is the only Pretence that can justify their Conduct with Regard to me Could you ever have thought that the whole Revenue of this vast Empire does not amount to above ten or twelve Millions of Crowns Their Generosity cannot be very extensive out of so inconsiderable an Income But after all you may object Why was I not satisfied with what they gave me Was it not sufficient to be fed in the Manner they live themselves Black Bread Salt and often putrid Fish are the Victuals and Water the Drink they generally put up with in  Muscovy  Could a Prisoner as I was a Person unknown expect to meet with a better Treatment Had they vouchsafed me the Allowance given in other Countries to Prisoners of State I should alone have consumed as much as would have served half a Dozen of  Muscovite  Families The Scarceness of Money in this Country and the Misery the People are reduced to can hardly be imagined In the whole Extent of  Muscovy  there does not so much Money circulate during the Course of a Year as at  Paris London  and  Amsterdam  in a single Day I believe I should speak within Compass if I tell you that the daily Expence of a single Merchant at  London  far exceeds that of a  whole City in  Muscovy  This impossibility which they laboured under of maintaining me in the Manner I ought to have been treated was the Reason that they gladly left that Care to Mr  de L'Isle  and his Wife who were both as kind and generous to me as the People in  France  generally are to Strangers Tho I forbid my Guard going to ask for any Thing at Mr  de L'Isle  's yet they constantly went thither and not a Day passed that I did not receive some Tokens of their Benevolence I assure you his Generosity to me exceeded whatever I could expect from the best of my Friends I intend to let you know more on this Article on an other Occasion Permit me now to entertain you with an Account how I employed my Time in my Prison  I found Means to make a shift without Pen Paper or Ink as I was destitute of those Helps A Nail which by Chance I found in my Prison supplied the Place of a Pen and instead of Paper I made use of the Table from whence they had taken away the Carpet I had therefore no Occasion for Ink to write with I begun by engraving on the Edge of the Drawer these Words  Inter scribas et Pharisaeos innocens erat  After this I undertook to embroider all my Table and my first Attempt was an Encomium on the  Czarina  in the following Words  Anna della tue glorie al scriver pronto  Dell' ala della fama  Piuma stringer vorrei  Ma misero sol servo  Suelta dal Carcer mio penna di ferro  Having thus begun to take delight in Poetry I made these following Lines  Anna delle tue Lodi  Pur dir vorrei Ma alla materia vasta  Un sol foglio poseggo ed ei non basta  It would be difficult to account  ut sic repente Poeta prodirem  But however it happened my Table was in a few Days covered with wretched Verses The  Muscovites  understood nothing of the Matter nor indeed did I make them for their Use I resolved after having filled my Table to engrave on the Door of my Prison an Account of my most remarkable Adventures in  Muscovy  There you may read that I was refused a Barber lest I should make Use of his Razor to cut my own Throat and that they would not allow me a Physician because he might have cured me and saved my Life These two Incidents occasioned me to propose the Riddle of a Man who could neither live nor dye And I was in reality in the Case of that Person to whom a  Gascoon  said If you draw near I shall kill you and if you go back you are a dead Man This unhappy Man could in so great an Extremity no Way avoid the imminent Danger without becoming invisible which was likewise the Advice the  Gascoon  gave him As this Behaviour of the  Muscovites  in Regard to me was a very evident Proof of their Barbarity I resolved in order to perpetuate the Memory thereof to address the following Lines to their Secretaries  Signori Secretari  Che il Barbiero negate  Ed il Medico non date  Siete Cervelli rari  Voi dite Barbiere n    Che ucciderti vó  Ma il Medico Iol so  Perehe sanarmi può  Ocridicolo absurdo In fede mia  Ignorate esser forza questa Porta  Aperta o chiusa sia  It is a Phenomenon somewhat strange to be exposed to perish by Hunger and as this was my Case in  Muscovy  I thought an Occurrence of that kind deserved to be transmitted to Posterity These are the Verses I composed on that Subject  Signori Secretari dite un puoco  Per chi voi mi prendete  Se per uomo O per spirto se son tale  Guardate non vi faccia inspiritare  Ma se uomo son io date a mangeare  Forsi perche senza verun soccorso  Non mori di gran male  Mi credete immortale  Such was my Occupation in my Prison Any one besides my self would have taken Pains to broach Invectives against the  Muscovites  but to tell you the Truth I thought them unworthy of my Anger An Affair happened in the mean Time at which tho ludicrous enough I could not forbear expressing some Indignation The Matter was this  As my Confinement begun to be irksome to me not a Day passed that I did not make some serious Reflections on the Motives that could induce the  Muscovites  to keep me so long closed between four Walls I thought that they begun to forget me and resolved to seek some Method of making my self the Subject of Publick Discourse My Beard appeared most proper to awaken their Minds and to give the Alarm to my whole Guard It had  for some Time been of a frightful Length I daily observed the Clerks who came into my Chamber telling one another that I was not unlike a  Tartar  As I should rather choose to resemble a  Tartar  than a  Muscovite  this Comparison gave me no great Offence In order to convince them of my entire Indifference as to all their Railleries on my Beard I sometimes told them that if  Peter  I had met me in his Dominions I should have met but with a bad Reception I even made some Verses and engraved them on my Table by which I gave them to understand that my Beard was so far from rendering me dejected and giving me the Air of a Criminal that it added to my Courage and Resolution I frequently talked in this Strain and to confirm what I said the more I added these Words  Barbatum hoc crede Magistrum  Dicere  I took however the Resolution of cutting off my Beard and I even intended to give them Notice of it notwithstanding the Indifference I expressed about it You know I always wear on my Arm one of those Stones so famed in the Writings of the Learned which ought if I had been somewhat more credulous to have been in greater Esteem with me during the Course of my Adventures Having called my Corporal I shewed him the Stone protesting that if he did not instantly send me a Barber I would cause a Genius whom I pretended to have at Command and to keep inclosed there to come immediately and shave me At hearing these Words he seemed to be in a Maze and having alternatively cast his Eyes on me and my Stone trembling replied that he would carry my Message to his Officers and return immediately with their Answer At his return he told me I must  have a little more Patience and that it was still thought improper to grant my Request Dissatisfied with this repeated Refusal I directly resolved to perform the Office of a Barber my self No sooner were my Guard intent upon something else than I took my Scissars which supplied the want of a Razor and soon after shewed my self again to the Corporal without a Beard His Astonishment was beyond Expression he was in a perfect Rapture  I easily foresaw that I must arm my self with Courage against the Consequences which this Affair might produce and be prepared for all Events As nobody appeared all that Day I concluded it gave them little or no Concern But was told by my Guard the next Morning that my Beard had caused a great Disturbance and that they themselves expected to be punished for not observing my Actions more narrowly By their Discourse I perceived they had no thoughts of my having Scissars and that I should certainly be esteemed an arrant Sorcerer The Reluctance I had of passing for a Magician and seeing my Guard undeservedly lashed made me frankly own I had a Pair of Scissars and had made Use of them to cut off my Beard An universal Alarm ensued the Clerks in the AntiChamber made it the whole Subject of their Discourse and looked upon this Trifle as a Matter of the utmost Importance The Noise this Affair made gave me but little Uneasiness but I was highly surprized when the Sergeant of my Guard the Corporal and seven or eight Soldiers came with their Swords drawn into my Chamber The Sight of this effeminate Troop was nevertheless so far from terrifying me that I prepared for a vigorous Resistance in Case of an Attack  The Sergeant broke Silence and demanded my Scissars but all the Answer I gave him was that I  did not understand him I made the same Reply to the Corporal and Soldiers who likewise made the same Demand In vain they made various Signs for me to apprehend their Meaning and the Sergeant in particular put his Fingers to his Whiskers to signify that they desired to have the Scissars with which I had cut off my Beard They went out of my Room when I ordered them to fetch me an Interpreter but returned a quarter of an Hour after attended by a much larger Number of Soldiers They found me sitting and approaching me repeated their former Demand I desired them in plain Terms to retire and signified that I was not sufficiently versed in the  Russian  Tongue to make them any Answer The Drawer of my Table being half open one of these Men of War more bold than the rest very insolently put in his Hand I was going at the very Instant to shut the Drawer and pinch his Hand but he deprived me of this Pleasure by withdrawing it very seasonably I got up at the same Time somewhat hastily and having called my Guard made Signs to them immediately to rid me of this rascally Crew Thus ended the Uproar occasioned by my Scissars The  Italian  Comedians could I believe hardly present a Piece which would afford the  Czarina  more Pleasure than this and had that Princess known that there was a Theatre open so near her where her own Subjects acted such diverting Parts I am pretty well assured my Prison would have been honoured with Her Majesty's Presence You see Sir I am as good as my Word I promised you something ludicrous and you have no Reason to complain of any Want of it in this Letter I leave it to your Judgment after you have perused it As I have already entertained you with some Verses which I made when my Request for a Barber met with a Refusal it is but just I send you some others which I carved  on my Table when I was rid of my Beard They were conceived in these Words  Signori Secretari  Perche alla vostra Barba  Mi son fatta la Barba  Voi fate del rumore  Opetere del Cielo  E che quivi tra voi non è permesse  Ne pur strapparsi il pelo  But it's Time to conclude the Farce is already too long I begin to be tired with it and fear it will have the same Effect on you I ought rather to have recollected the Proverb  Li Jochi son belli quando son corti  To retaliate your Loss of Time in the Perusal of so many bad  Italian  Verses I shall conclude this Letter with a Line or two of good  Latin  and so bid you farewel  Tu tamen ô nobis usu junctissime longo  Pars desiderii maxima crede mei  Sis nostri memor  LETTER VII  SIR  _THIS is already my seventh Letter tho I am but come to the fourth Month of my Imprisonment If I go on thus I very much fear I shall be obliged  centuriam tibi dare  which will not only prove tedious to you but likewise far exceed my Reckoning But tell me dear Sir what Course can I take For I see no Possibility of being more concise You on the one Hand make pressing Demands for an exact and circumstantial Account of what befals me and the  Muscovites  on the other Side furnish me daily with fresh Adventures The following is a very singular one  Towards the End of  February  a Person came into my Prison who having saluted me in  French  with a Compliment from Mr  De L'Isle  and his Spouse laid a Parcel of Linnen with some Wine and several other Provisions upon my Table The Joy I felt at seeing a Person with whom I could converse was of a short Duration I had hardly Time to tell him how much I was obliged to that Gentleman and his Lady for the Kindnesses I received from them and that I was ashamed to see their Generosity so much trespassed upon The Case was this having given some Linnen to the Soldiers to get it washed and mended for me they had thought proper to carry it to this Lady who was so kind as to add thereto several other Things which she thought I might stand in Need of She had ordered one of her Servants to deliver the Parcel himself being sensible that if it  had fallen into other Hands I should have been robbed of a good Part of her Benevolence You will Sir undoubtedly be surprized that the Servant should be suffered to speak to me and to give me that Parcel which had not been visited either by a Secretary or by any of the Guard Was I then no longer the same Prisoner of State whose Steps were to be narrowly observed and who was to be guarded with the utmost Rigour Was I not the same Person whose Request for a Barber had been refused and who could not obtain the Liberty of using a Knife or Fork Yes I was the same but the grand Motive which induced the  Musco+vites  to act on this Occasion otherwise with Regard to me was this If these sordid Wretches had furnished these Provisions and caused my Linnen to be washed themselves it would have cost them very near the Value of a Ruble a Sum which to them appeared considerable enough  ut silerent leges  and they were willing to leave the Care of it to any one who would be at the Expence The Truth of what I here affirm is so very certain that when in the Sequel I desired any Thing that they thought too dear I was obliged to have Recourse to Mrs  De L'Isle  who never failed of sending her Servant immediately  This Instance may serve to give you an Idea of the Sordidness of the  Muscovites  and at the same Time will shew you the Necessity I lie under of descending to those Particulars to give you a perfect Insight into the Character of the Nation A different Inducement or rather a Sense of Gratitude prompts me to mention two small Birds which one of my Guard made me a Present of and no sooner had I them than I set them at Liberty to fly about my Room They soon grew familiar and convinced me that Man is not the only Creature endued with Reason With Submission to  the Gentlemen of the  Cartesian  Sect I could by no Means believe them to be meer Pieces of Machinery I discovered in them a Genius the Faculty of Reason and a certain engaging Carriage which Men are not Masters of I may justly say that I was charmed with their Company and that they gave me many agreeable Hours They were continually about me and made me a Thousand pretty Tenders of their Affection I may venture to affirm without being too profuse in their Praise that many  Muscovites  are their Inferiours I mean with regard to their Reason Manners and certain Passions which I may call humane and which I never had the good Fortune to experience in any one of my Guard This innocent Couple no longer able to see the Brutality of my Attendants quitted my Prison at last and left me alone in Captivity I loved them too well not to allow them a Place among my Poetical Compositions or to neglect their due Encomium but I omit it here to go on to another Subject  I have already told you that I carved my Verses on the Table and Door and that both were soon filled with Fragments of Poetry Weary of this Amusement I resolved to spend my Time somewhat more usefully I had as I observed above a  Muscovite  Almanack which is a Book of a pretty large Size and besides this I had a Pocket Book and a Silver Pencil My Almanack lay open before me one Day when by Chance I discovered a Leaf of blank Paper in it which I resolved to write upon with my Pencil I directly made a Trial and succeeded to my Wish I held my Paper to the Light whenever I desired to read what I had written and every Character appeared as distinct as if I had written them with Ink Thus may a Prison be sometimes the Mother of Invention My mistrustful Guard in the mean Time  being highly surprized to see me thus employed drew near from Time to Time to examine my Actions but as they saw Nothing but the Blank Paper and I had neither Pen nor Ink which were forbidden me they suffered me to go on without Interruption and I was so expeditious that all the Paper was soon filled There was a large Quantity in my Room But it was tied up and sealed according to the Custom of the Country and the Soldiers had Orders to take Care of it I found Means however to get some of it without being discovered and laid up so good a Store that I found I had sufficient to finish what I had begun A Shipwrack unfortunately deprived me of all these Memoirs which would have been excellent Materials for the History of my Adventures and hence it is that my Letters are so dull and written in so incorrect a Stile  But what will you think of my Temerity in stealing Paper and breaking open Seals which in  Muscovy  is looked upon as a capital Crime As for the Paper I thought my self entitled to it to repair the Loss I had sustained of my own which I had been robbed of at  Casan  and Part of my Cloaths which they had thought proper to deprive me of I confess that had I been discovered in breaking open the Seals it might have fared hard with me For in  Muscovy  you must know every Thing is sealed Houses Shops WareHouses Chambers Doors and Windows There is but one Thing which in this Country it is not customary to seal tho they do it in  Italy  where Jealousy is carried too great a Length I leave you to guess my Meaning The Manner of sealing up Papers in  Muscovy  is very singular They take a little Piece of yellow Wax between their Fingers which they apply to a twisted Piece of Packthread and then put a Seal to it on which it would be pretty difficult  to discern any Impression You find however People every where who are entrusted with the Care of those Papers thus negligently sealed are very watchful of them Nothing is more easy in spite of all these Precautions than to learn the Secrets of the State Should ever a fatal Star lead you to an Ambassy in  Muscovy  you need only previously consult me and may rely on my pointing out to you the necessary Means of being soon apprized of them I shall even instruct you how to get all the Writings out of the Secretary's Office and replace them without any Danger of being detected A Glass of Brandy or half a Ruble are Bribes sufficient to gain any Clerk in the Office  The Soldiers on Guard are seldom over careful in the Discharge of their Duty They are almost always snoring never acquainted with their Orders and ever ready to submit to the first that are given them by any one But what is yet worse these Wretches are incessantly Drunk which gives Occasion to continual Quarrels and to that Disorder which reigns among them I have frequently seen at one Time half a Dozen Clerks in Irons for Neglect of Duty which nevertheless could not put a stop to their indecent Mirth Iron is very cheap in  Muscovy  and for the least Neglect the guilty Person is so loaded with it that he cannot stir  In the mean Time I was buried in Oblivion and my Releasement seemed to be no longer thought of As I was determined to strive by all the Means I could invent to effect my Deliverance from this unhappy State I resolved to write a Petition to the Ministers For this I made use of a little Pen which I fixed at the End of my Pencil This happily succeeded without the Privity of my Guard and I may say that I often shewed them  Candida de nigris de candentibus atra  One need not be a Conjurer to impose on these People  In my Petition to the Ministers I humbly entreated them as I had been so long imprisoned without being able to conceive the Motives of so rigorous and tedious a Detention to allow me at least to draw up my Vindication in Writing If I was found guilty I willingly submitted to the Forfeiture of my Life but in Case I appeared innocent as I hoped to convince them I was I begged they would use their Interest with her Majesty for my Releasement The next Difficulty after I had drawn up this Petition was to convey it to the Hands of the Ministers which was no very easy Matter I knew not at that Time whether those Gentlemen must be directly applied to I had indeed often heard of Secretaries and Senators but I persisted still that my Affairs were only cognisable before Empress and her Ministers The Disdain I had on several Occasions expressed for the Senate did perhaps protract my Captivity But I could never prevail upon my self to change my Sentiments on that Head and even when my Misery drew towards a Crisis I implored the Protection of the  Czarina  only without making the least mention of the Senate or the Council  Tantum licentiae dabat innocentia  As I did not immediately meet with an Opportunity of presenting my Petition I prepared in the mean Time for the Execution of a fresh Project I had for some Time been troubled with a Rheum in my Head and as my  Eau des Carmes  was locked up in my Trunk I resolved to get it open in order to come at some The Matter at first appeared not very easy by reason of the Padlock and Seal neither of which I durst venture to touch Having in the mean Time narrowly viewed the Trunk it appeared to be made only of several  Planks joined together without Nails and that by the Help of a Piece of Iron I might easily take one of them off This therefore or something like it was my next Want which I supplied in the following Manner Seeing my Guard very busy one Day at making a Fire in the Stove and taking great Pains to cut little Pieces of Wood with their Swords I told them that an Ax would be much more convenient for that Purpose and that they should endeavour to procure one They had Sense enough on that Occasion to apprehend that I was in the right but replied that I must demand that Utensil of the Sergeant As I was not the best satisfied with this Officer who now never came near me I answered he was a Rascal and that I desired to have nothing to do with him I gave them at the same Time half a Ruble and ordered them to go and buy an Ax I was soon obeyed for they stick at nothing when Money is in the Case Be pleased likewise here to observe the Folly of my Guard I should without fail have met with a Refusal had I demanded a Knife or Fork and yet they buy an Ax and entrust it in my Hands without Difficulty You will perhaps ask whence proceeds this Difference Because the Ax was not specified in their Bederoll It was not one of those Things I had been denied the Use of and it was besides to be of Service to themselves But as the Fear of my cutting my Throat induced them to refuse me a Knife had they not the same Room to apprehend I might split my Scull with the Ax or employ it against them if an Opportunity offered Hence you may judge of the Perverseness of the  Muscovites  I shall now tell you in what Manner I executed both the Projects I had formed If I mistake not it was on the th of  March  But since I mention the th Day I must take Notice of an Observation  I made which appears to me pretty singular Have you not in the Perusal of my Letters found that all the remarkable Epochs of my Adventures happened precisely on that Day I was carried to the  Czarina's  Palace on the th of  December  It was the th of  January  when I was allowed to write and in the Sequel you will find that the most remarkable Adventures I met with always happened on the th Day of the Month I wish some one could account for this Phenomenon The Number has I know beeen formerly regarded by all Nations as a mysterious Number for which they have always had a great Veneration Whether our modern Cabalists are still of the same Opinion I know not but in Regard to the Number I never heard that it had any mysterious Meaning and assure you that to me the Discovery is entirely new Can you imagine this to be the bare Effect of Chance It will not be foreign to my Subject here to observe that the  Muscovites  who are superstitious even to an Excess have always endeavoured to improve the extravagant Fancies of the Ancients and hence it is that of two nines they have made one  The th of  March  was the Day on which I was ordered to be carried to another Prison As I feared this Removal would deprive me of an Opportunity of presenting my Petition in the Manner I had proposed the News of it gave me some Uneasiness My Departure was so very abrupt that they allowed me no Time to make many Reflections and I was obliged to take  Consilium in arena  I was escorted by a Troop of Soldiers and by my Guard headed by their Sergeant No sooner was I brought into a Chamber crowded with People than I pulled my Petition out of my Pocket and crying out aloud that every one might hear me gave it to the Sergeant of my Guard charging him to carry  it immediately to the  Czarina's  Council A superior Officer who was probably in some neighbouring Chamber terrified at the Noise instantly appeared and being informed of the Occasion took it and carried it into the Chamber where the Senate was assembled After my Petition was delivered I was for retiring but they forced was to wait a Quarter of an Hour longer and the Officer in the mean Time returning gave me my Papers back again and would force me to take them Enraged at the Fellow's Obstinacy and having before had Reason to be dissatisfied with him I gave him a Blow on the Hand which caused the Paper to fall on the Ground and then leaving the Place abruptly threatned him with Her Imperial Majesty's Displeasure if he refused to convey the Petition to her Hands  On my Arrival in my new Prison I set about the Project I had formed of opening my Trunk and taking from thence what I most wanted To succeed the better I gave my Guard some Employment and for my Part I was busied in making a Cage for my Birds Thus was I working Ax in Hand to cut a Plank which I had laid upon my Trunk You may easiy suppose that at Times I applied my Axe to my Trunk to open it and consequently that all my Blows were not spent on that Plank My Guard supplied me with what other Tools I still stood in Need of and with their Help I soon compassed my Ends Having thrown my CloakBag and some other Things on the Trunk I slid off the Plank which I had loosened and immediately took out the  Eau des Carmes  and whatever came first to Hand It happened very luckily that I could fix the Plank in the Manner it was in before and afterwards as easily loosen it again to take out of my Trunk whatever I wanted Thus was I restored to the Possession of my own and could even in Case of Necessity have  armed my self with a Sword and Pistols to procure my Liberty The People I had to do with had not Courage enough to defend themselves against me and my single Fork seemed to me sufficient to put three or four  Muscovites  to the Flight The World would have an Opinion very different from that which  Europe  has for some Time entertained of this Nation were they as well acquainted as I am of their Cowardice  Having thus delivered my Petition I waited impatiently for the Result of it No Answer was brought that Day nor the next but the Day after an Interpreter came into my Chamber with my Paper in his Hand and begged I would explain several Lines which they had not perfectly understood I soon complied with his Request and he promised to give a faithful Account of the Passages I had cleared up The same Man returned an Hour afterwards to ask what Means I us'd to write that Petition and whether I had corrupted my Guard either with Money or Brandy I answered that I had no Occasion to have Recourse to either of those Expedients that as I was in a Room where thirty or more Clerks were employed I had not found it difficult to procure Ink a Pen and some Paper without the Knowledge of my Guard and that they were not at all privy to it As the Account I gave met with but little Credit and I was apprehensive they might punish the innocent Soldiers I resolved to discover the whole Secret I therefore desired the Interpreter to let his Masters know that for a Fortnight together I had written with white Characters that I might be able to write black ones for one Quarter of an Hour The Interpreter seemed satisfied with my Answer and went away to make his Report He returned once more half an Hour afterwards to ask me how I had done to seal my Petition I shewed him for his  Satisfaction some Wax I had in my Pocket with the two Seals hanging at my Watch Notwithstanding my pressing Entreaties to speak to this Interpreter again I could never from that Time have the Pleasure of seeing him  The Addition which was now made to the Number of my Guard and the fresh Orders that were given to interrupt all my Proceedings occasioned me to think that after a Consultation was held on my Affairs it was thought necessary that my Actions should be more narrowly watched My only Comfort on this Occasion was that I could enjoy more Peace and had a larger Room for my Prison I could not however account for the Behaviour of the Ministers with regard to me I had now been confined four Months at  Petersburg  and my Enlargement was not yet thought of After many Reflections on the State of my Affairs I fancied that the Intention I had declared of serving in  Persia  under the Prince of  HesseHomburg  had perhaps given the Ministers Room for some Suspicions And as that Prince had no Thoughts himself of going into that Country till some Uneasiness put him upon it this Notion appeared to be the better grounded As on the other Hand the fundamental Maxim of the  Muscovite  Government consists in trusting nobody and in believing all Mankind to be capable of the most villainous Attempts I had Reason to suppose that they only detained me so long Prisoner to inform themselves of the real Motive of my Voyage Or perhaps in the present Juncture of Affairs in  Europe  they took me for an Emissary of  France  or of King  Stanislaus  I am however not conscious of having done or said any thing that could raise such a Suspicion and my Behaviour in  Muscovy  was very much unlike that of a Person entrusted with secret Commissions I was nevertheless some Time after informed that  I was taken for a Spy of King  Stanislaus  though I never had the Honour of knowing that Prince or being at all known to him But let us leave these Conjectures which may lead me too far And instead thereof let me inform you of what passed in my new Habitation  After having opened my Trunk and taken out of it what I thought necessary I resolved to make no longer Use of a wooden Fork which had been given me nor to be obliged to borrow a Knife to cut my Victuals but made a Shew of my great Fork and of a Knife which I had taken out of my Trunk My Guard seemed surprized at the Sight of these Things and I wondered no less to see them profoundly silent From thence I inferred that they no longer feared my cutting my Throat and that all their Care was to hinder me from writing again They gave me the Pleasure of seeing them every Day visit the Seals of my Trunk to know whether I had tried to open it By my frequent Representations how necessary it was to have a constant Eye on those Seals I even invited them to make that Visit Thus after I had tricked them they served for Objects of my Ridicule I was taken up with this Amusement one Part of the Day and spent the Remainder of my Time in looking over the  Muscovite  Almanack which was the only Book I had left I was one Day perusing the List of the Potentates of  Europe  and read with some Surprize the Name of  Augustus  III as King of  Poland  This News occasioned me to form various Conjectures and gave me a very eager Desire of knowing what had passed I no longer doubted but that the War was kindled in  Poland  and found at the same Time that the Person from whom I had received my chief Intelligence since my Arrival at  Petersburg  must be perfectly well acquainted with the Designs and Projects of the Court of  Russia  This Person whom I believe I mentioned before had not a little contributed to my taking the Resolution of going into  Persia  I had long before suspected that he resided at  Petersburg  on Account of some secret and important Affair which Suspicion was afterwards confirmed by fresh Proofs and such as suffered me no longer to doubt of the Truth of my Conjecture As he was well acquainted with whatever passed at the Court of  Russia  he appeared to me the more proper to discharge his Commission  Tho it was with Astonishment I heard that King  Augustus  had acceeded to the Throne of  Poland  yet I was not ignorant that the  Muscovites  would use their utmost Efforts to effect the Exclusion of King  Stanislaus  but I could hardly persuade my self they would ever have succeeded The great Influence the  Russian  Court at present has in the Affairs of  Europe  does really surprize me and is what I cannot sufficiently repeat to you The World has formed of this Monarchy a Notion of Power which exists only in the Fancies of those who have no Knowledge of it  Russia  is I must own of a vast Extent and I even believe that neither  Europe  nor the  Indies  nor any other Part of the World contains a Country in that Point equal to it You may judge of this by its Length if you consider the Distance between  Riga  and the  Eastern  Extremity of the Continent of  Kamtschatki  lately discovered and by the Latitude of it which extends from the Province of  Gilan  on the  Southern  Coasts of the  Caspian  Sea to the Streights of  Nassau  The prodigious Extent of this Empire must necessarily be a Burthen to it and renders it if I may be allowed the Expression heavy and unfit for Motion If on the other Hand we enter into a particular Account of the Parts of which it is composed we meet with immense Desarts  Marshes without End and very large Forests It will therefore upon an exact Calculation be found that  Germany  contains twice as many Inhabitants as  Muscovy  To this add the Pusillanimity of the  Muscovites  who are by no Means a People to be dreaded by other Nations  Nam si homines vix sunt homines hoc nomine digni  Were we to give Credit to what is inserted in certain Gazettes I know we should have Room to believe that the  Muscovites  have actually formidable Armies on foot consisting of regular Troops But believe me Sir those Reports are entirely groundless and only fit to seduce the unknowing Part of Mankind I wish they would shew me where all these Troops are In the Year I saw the State of the  Muscovite  Troops and if they amount at present to Men they must have been considerably augmented But supposing that there is actually at present that Number of regular Troops in  Muscovy  must they not necessarily be divided and distributed into several Places You are not ignorant of the indispensible Necessity they lye under of keeping always a pretty large Body in  Persia  and that a Removal of them from that Country even in Time of Peace would be attended with some Danger The  Persians  have of late been pretty well experienced in War and should they happen to make Peace with the  Turks Koulikan  would without doubt undertake the Conquest of those fine Provinces which the  Muscovites  have by Usurpation made themselves Masters of What ought we to think of this Behaviour of the  Muscovites  with Regard to the  Persians  Under the specious Pretence of lending their Aid to a King oppressed by a rebellious Subject they enter the Country where they are received like generous Friends and at the  same Time treacherously seize whatever they think most commodious for them  Besides the Body of Troops which the  Muscovites  cannot avoid maintaining in  Persia  they are obliged to keep another on Foot in the Kingdom of  Astracan  which is surrounded by  Tartars  who are Neighbours they have always Reason to be apprehensive of The Troubles that Kingdom was so lately involved in are still fresh in every one's Memory An handful of Men spread a general Confusion and made terrible Ravages there Another Motive that must induce the  Muscovites  to keep Troops in the Kingdom of  Astracan  is because the  Tartars  of  Baskir  and those of  Uffi  who were antient Possessors of this Country might otherwise rise in Rebellion some Time or other and revenge themselves on the  Russians  During my stay at  Casan  I had an Opportunity of seeing some of that Nation and if we may judge by their Phisiognomy they do not seem destined to bow their Necks long to the  Muscovite  Yoke But let us go back and stop at the River  Don  where the  Koban Tartars  who are not far distant from thence make frequent Incursions and very much molest the  Muscovites  If those People are not kept in awe they may certainly penetrate as far as  Weronezt  and venture at last on some important Enterprize to succour their Brethren the  CrimTartars  If we go on into the  Ukraine  we shall find that Country cannot remain long in the Hands of the  Russians  unless it be secured by a considerable Body of good Troops In those Parts the  Muscovites  must have a watchful Eye over the Motions of the  Turks  the  Crim  and  BudziackTartars  and even of the  Cosacks  who may soon or late rise in Arms and as they have formerly done withdraw their Allegiance  Thus you see that if the  Muscovites  maintain as they must do a Body of regular Troops in each  of those Places and especially in  Persia  and the  Ukraine  their Army of an hundred thousand Men will be reduced to a very small Number To these you may add the Troops which are actually in  Poland  Men which they are to send to the  Emperor  's Aid on the  Rhine  and lastly the numerous Garrisons which must necessarily be kept in most of those Places which have been taken from  Sweden  But supposing that the  Muscovites  had really as many Troops as they are said to have where will they find Money to pay them The Revenues of that vast Monarchy do not amount to above ten or twelve thousand Crowns How is it possible with a Sum so inconsiderable to maintain or Men by Land and besides this a formidable Fleet at Sea  These Particulars may serve to shew that I am not mistaken in exclaiming against the Rumour spread in  Europe  of the Power of this Nation The Gazetteers are excusable as they publish those Reports on a MisInformation but what Judgement can we form of the  Muscovites  who tho thoroughly acquainted with the State of their Affairs the Number and Quality of their Troops and the Weakness of their Finances dare to attempt the Execution of the Projects now on the Carpet Believe me Sir and give me leave to repeat it once more that they will never obtain the Ends they have in View  They seem however to bid very fair for it at this time  Spes improbissimas complectuntur insperata assecuti  What Projects the  Muscovites  may have formed for this Campaign I am wholly ignorant of but this I know that they were the last Year obliged for the Reinforcement of their Troops to draw all  had from their InlandCountries Insomuch that none but Invalids remained at  Muscow  tho a considerable Body always us'd to be kept on Footthere At  Petersburg  remained only the Guards and two Battalions of Peasants just taken from behind their Ovens hence it was that the Number of the ordinary Guards could not be compleated and that even mine was lessened for I was left in the Hands of three Men who were not relieved in near two Months  Their Manner of doing Duty in  Muscovy  is pretty singular Those who like me have been EyeWitnesses may have an Idea of the Troops of this Country and of the Officers who command them A Soldier on Duty never knows when he is to be relieved and as for the Officers they are generally ignorant of the first Rudiments of War which those of other Countries are so well acquainted with A Centinel very seldom executes the Orders he receives from his Sergeant They never hesitate at placing a drunken Soldier on Duty and frequently a whole Guard Officers as well as Soldiers are drunk and incapable of attending their Duty Nothing is more common than to see a mutinous Soldier fall to Blows with his Sergeant and the latter is often obliged to put up with them without daring to complain The Quarrels which happen every Day among the Officers or the Soldiers are never terminated otherways than by FistyCuffs or Cudgels for there is a Law in  Muscovy  as I observed in a former Letter whereby the Subjects are forbid to draw their Swords which Law is always most religiously observed The only Thing which appears laudable is that these Troops are never suffered to be idle and at  Petersburg  I remember to have seen fifteen Battalions employed at a Time and not a single Man remaining at the Corps de Garde Guards are placed every where  and there is not the least thing done without such a Security Foreign Ministers of what Rank soever they be never fail of being attended by some of them You may judge after this how safely their Money must be guarded in  Muscovy  I assure you that a Commissioner who has only a dozen Bags of CopperMoney in his Chest will at least have a Guard of six Men Such is the Employment of the greater Part of a large Garrison whilst the rest are continually occupied in cleaving and cutting Wood for their Fuel This they call keeping their Troops in Exercise and always ready for Battle and imagine they are performing Wonders  I could enlarge farther on this Subject but fear this Letter is already too long I must therefore conclude Sir tho I do it with Reluctance assuring you that I am and shall always be wholly Yours  Dum memor ipse mei dum spiritus hos regit artus  LETTER VIII  SIR  YOU very justly censure the Stile of my Letters the Faults are as visible to me as to you but I do not find it so easy to avoid them The Reasons I told you before which you cannot be ignorant of My Condition will not allow me to be very nice in the Choice of my Words nor to give a just Turn to my Periods  Animum non carmina jacto  In my last I informed you how I was apprized of the War being kindled in  Poland  and that King  Augustus  had acceeded to the Throne The same Person told me that the  Muscovites  had invested  Dantzick  and that King  Stanislaus  was block'd up in that City As I neglected no Opportunity of learning the publick News I heard that Count  Munich  was departed for the Camp before  Dantzick  that a large Body of Troops was ordered to march from  Poland  and that all who were at  Muscow  were to come to  Petersburg  Orders were even sent to my Guard to prepare for a March which I found they were not the best pleased with They were continually observing that a bloody War would soon ensue that a large Body of  French  Troops was already arrived in  Poland  and preparing to march directly to  Moscow  In vain I represented to them the Impossibility of it by Reason of the vast Distance the  French  are at they persisted this News was but too true and that I ought no longer to doubt it By their Discourse I perceived how much they were afraid of coming to blows with the  French  You must know the Warriors in  Muscovy  all equally wish for Peace and that no one here is a Soldier by Inclination They ingenuously confess their Aversion to War and that were they not forced to enter into military Service they would never do it voluntarily If the Officers themselves were allowed to do it they would certainly resign their Posts From hence you may judge what Opinion we ought to have of these Troops  The Intelligence I received from my Guard served only to encrease my Desire of hearing more News but nothing appeared so difficult as to find the Means of satisfying my Curiosity After many Reflections it came into my Head to send for Mr  De L'Isle  's Cook not doubting but that  he would give me a thorough Knowledge of every Thing In order to this I asked for several Things which I pretended to have urgent Occasion for and for which I knew my Guard would not disburse any Money This succeeded to my Wish They went immediately to Mr  De L'Isle  who instantly sent his Cook with all I asked for I acquainted this Man with my earnest Desire of seeing him to be informed of the Posture of Affairs in  Europe  and begged he would visit me frequently to impart to me all he might learn He promised faithfully to gratify my Desire and he was as good as his Word  By this Means I was informed of many Things some of which were agreeable while others gave me Uneasiness The Affection I always bore to Arms revived in me when I found War declared on all Hands and this at the same Time made me more sensibly feel the Weight of my Miseries But with Pleasure I heard that the  French  had distinguished themselves from the Beginning of the War and the Progress they had made did I must own far exceed my Hopes I remember to have said in a former Conversation with you that as the Enemies of  France  could not gain their Ends by a War they were endeavouring to subdue that Nation by a Peace My Conjectures were groundless and it is with Joy I find my self mistaken Who would ever have thought that what is the general Cause of the Decay and total Subversion of the most powerful States could never produce either of those fatal Effects in  France  Were Luxury and Indolence ever carried to so great an Excess in any Country in the Universe as in this very Kingdom The  French  in the mean Time so immerged in Voluptuousness those illustrious Youths so intent upon the Finery of their Attire and so attached to the Pursuit of their Pleasures have given the most evident Proofs of  their Valour and Bravery at the Battles of  Parina  and  Guastalla  and at the Siege of  Philipsburg  They may justly be said to have shewn a Prodigy of Valour and to have acted like Heroes This Phenomenon is extraordinary and perhaps without a Precedent The Reflections I have made on this Subject would lead me too far from my main Design should I undertake to communicate them all to you  My Thoughts were not however so wholly taken up with the News I heard in my Prison to hinder me from considering seriously how to procure my Liberty  A Month was now pass'd since I presented my Petition and I had as yet received no Answer I seemed to be buried in Oblivion and the Ministers appeared resolved to let me die in Slavery They continued to treat me with unprecedented Rigour and I could neither obtain an Interpreter nor Permission to speak to the Ministers Whatever Request I made was sure to meet with a Refusal I esteemed it a great Piece of Injustice that they so obstinately denied to see the Reasons I had to offer in my Justification  As I had some Room to think that the Gentlemen of the Senate had intercepted my Petition I resolved to draw up another The Execution of this Project was attended with some Difficulty by Reason of the Orders which had been given narrowly to watch my Motions and of the Number of my Guard which had been augmented This could not however discourage me from pursuing my Design I entrusted my Petition after I had sealed it to two Sergeants whom I charged to carry it instantly to the  Czarina  's Council An officious young Fellow who came almost every Minute into my Chamber to see whether my Guards had a strict Eye over me was greatly surprized when he saw that I had found Means of writing without being perceived by any one He swore and made a terrible Uproar threatning my Guard  that they should be punished for their Negligence They assured him with horrid Imprecations that they were not privy to it After a long Consultation they took my Petition at last and promised to execute the Commission faithfully The Sergeants returned notwithstanding this Promise in half an Hour and gave my Paper to the Soldier who was on Duty with a reiterated Charge not to suffer me to write any more This ill Success did not dishearten me My Guard on their Part doubled their Attention and even endeavoured to surprize me by Stratagems They pretended to be asleep and watched me through their Cloaks with which they cover'd their Heads  This Scene was comical enough and afforded me much Diversion I was extreamly delighted to see them fall from a feigned Sleep into a real and profound one I cannot conceive how they came to think of this Expedient For the  Muscovites  of all People are the most expert in the Art of Sleeping I may venture to say that of all the Nations I know not one is so subject to Sleep as the  Muscovites  are Not contented with the Night which in the WinterSeason is very long in their Country they take throughout the whole Year an Afternoon's Nap of several Hours This Custom is common to every  Muscovite  and 'tis that probably which makes them so stupid The whole Life of a Soldier is spent in Eating and Sleeping They even indulge themselves in the latter whilst they are on Duty The Time of their standing Centry which is for six Hours together is indeed too long When an Officer surprizes a Soldier asleep which I have frequently seen he does not make a Crime of it but only awakens him by saying How now Centry Are you asleep How the  Muscovite  Soldiers behave in the Field I know not but most certain it is that they can  never forbear slumbering if they are several Hours on Duty You need not therefore wonder if I could impose upon my Guard and find all the Time requisite to write a new Petition without their Knowledge After having drawn several Copies I sealed them and threw them out of the Window into a Place where I saw a great Thorowfare These Papers were directed to the Empress herself but I could never find that any Thing came of them This is common in  Muscovy  where it is difficult to obtain Justice  Hos scelerum ritus  I cannot with any Certainty impute this to any particular Person Shall I accuse the CabinetCouncil or the Members of the Senate I have Room to believe them all equally guilty and the Usage I have met with at their Hands but too plainly proves it The Reasons that induce me to attribute it to them are these The Petition which I sent my self as Prisoner of State to Her Imperial Majesty's Council was either intercepted or communicated to the Ministers If you suppose it to have fallen into their Hands may I not reasonably accuse them of the greatest Injustice as they would neither give Ear to my oral Remonstrances nor permit me to write But if my Petition was intercepted may I not conclude that the Ministry is under no fixed Regulation Since I was looked upon as a Person entrusted with some Commission dangerous to the State my Petition might be presumed to contain some Affairs of the greatest Importance It being on the other Hand directed to the Empress herself how durst they presume to open and intercept it A Proceeding of this Kind can never be in any Nation where all Laws divine and human are not trod under Foot In so unhappy a Situation my Uneasiness was beyond Expression Thus confined in a Prison where  I was used like the most vile of Men I knew not what Means to have Recourse to to procure my Releasement  Quoe res in se neque consilium neque modum habet ullum eam consilio regere non potes  As I was not so rigid a Stoic as to resolve upon spending the Remainder of my Days in a Prison a Desire after Liberty prompted me to think of new Expedients to free my self from Slavery I soon formed another Scheme the Execution of which appeared to me very easy This was to kill one of my Guard who always accompanied me alone to an Apartment whither I went to ease Nature I continued to think seriously of executing this Design as desperate as it was My Sword was as I mentioned before at my own Disposal and nothing seemed to me less difficult than to make my Escape from my Prison after having given the Blow The only Obstacle I saw was how to find a Place in the City to which I might safely retire I might in any other Country have relied on a Protection in the House of a foreign Minister in which I could securely have taken Refuge but I knew the  Muscovites  too well not to be acquainted how light they make of the Law of Nations I resolved however as I was destitute of any other Means to retire to the House of the  Prussian  Envoy where I proposed more Safety to my self than any where else All Matters were already disposed for an Enterprize so dangerous and so different from the many others I had in vain attempted when I begun seriously to reflect on the Action and upon second Thoughts resolved to delay it for some Time I was shocked at the bare Thought of killing a Man in cold Blood and protest that had not the Uneasiness caused in me by so long an Imprisonment and by the bad Treatment I met with from the  Muscovites  compelled me to it I should never have formed such a Design I therefore thought it my Duty patiently  to bear the Weight of my Miseries and to stay for some other Opportunity of recovering my Liberty without being obliged to commit a Crime and without running the Hazard I was going to expose my self to  I received in the mean Time frequent Intelligences of what passed at the Siege of  Dantzick  I was informed by my Guard that their Countrymen strove by all possible Means to make themselves Masters of that City and that they hoped to put an End to the War by seizing the Person of King  Stanislaus  I could not be prevailed on as I knew the  Muscovite  Troops to believe that they would ever bring about an Enterprize of that Kind I imagined besides that if the City should not be in a Condition of being defended it would infallibly be relieved with formidable Succours and thereby the  Muscovites  be obliged to retreat I was told that  Sweden  was equipping a considerable Fleet and that a large Body of Troops was forming in  Finland  This Step said to have been taken by  Sweden  appeared to me very reasonable and I had many Inducements to make me give Credit to these Intelligences And the  Swedes  could in Reality not meet with a more favourable Opportunity of retrieving the Losses they had sustained and revenging themselves on the  Muscovites  Nothing could in my Opinion at that Time be attended with less difficulty than the Execution of this Project The  Swedes  needed only to march directly to  Wibourg  and I am well assured that at the first Rumour of it at  Petersburg  that Capital would soon have been abandoned and the whole Court have retired to  Muscovy  What I here advance is pretty well founded and I even believe Sir it is the only and best Means that could be taken My Reasons are these The  Muscovites  had at the Time I am speaking of only  eight or ten Battalions and one Regiment of Cavalry to oppose the  Swedes  for herein consisted all that remained for the  Czarina  's Guard Had I not therefore Room to think that a Step like this ought to be taken by  Sweden  I had formed such pleasing Hopes of their succeeding therein that I had even projected to be one among them assoon as they should enter  Petersburg  The Execution of this Enterprize would not have been very difficult I might have cleared the Way for my self with my Sword and Pistols My Guard were not to be greatly feared and had I met with any Resistance from them I should soon have found Means of subduing them My Mind was during some Time wholly taken up with these pleasing Expectations I observed through the Windows of my Prison what passed in the City and when any one came into my Prison I could not dissemble my eager Desire of hearing News My Uneasinesses all vanished in Hopes of seeing this Grand Event Nothing could have pleased me more than to see the  Muscovites  upon the Point of quitting their Capital to avoid the Pursuits of an Enemy justly enraged With Pleasure I view'd the approaching Moment when they would be obliged to renounce all their great Enterprizes  My Conjectures Sir proved however groundless my Hopes were vain and the Event has but too plainly demonstrated how grosly I was mistaken You will undoubtedly say that my Imaginations were at that Time like those of a Person in the other World I confess I was deceived but who would ever have believed that the Affairs of  Poland  would have turned out to the Advantage of the  Russians  Am I the only one who entertained the Notions I then did What were your Thoughts Sir Could you ever have imagined that the City of  Dantzick  would surrender to the  Muscovites  That the  Swedes  would continue inactive And that all the other Potentates should not make the least Attempt to oppose the unjust Pretensions of the  Muscovites  I cannot but continue in my Surprize when I consider this general Inactivity of the Rest of the  Northern Princes  Are then the  Swedes  who were formerly so warlike a People now degenerated Could they ever have met with a more favourable Juncture to retrieve their Losses The  Muscovites  being still the very same as they were in the Times of  Charles  XII their declared Enemy they had nothing to fear from that Quarter Let them but recollect the famous Battle of  Narva  where a handful of valiant  Swedes  routed an Army of one Hundred Thousand  Russians  But you will perhaps ask is there no Difference between the present  Muscovite  Troops and those who fought the Battle of  Narva  There is I must own some but let us only examine wherein it consists The present  Russian  Soldiers are better cloathed and provided with better Arms than in the last War but they are in every other Respect still the same Men and have neither more Courage nor more Experience to boast of Believe me had the  Swedes  put it to the Trial the Perdition of the  Muscovites  would have been inevitable They were far from being in a Condition to oppose an Enemy by whom they had so often been conquered and at the same Time carry on a War with the  Poles  You will perhaps object that Part of the Troops employed at the Siege of  Dantzick  and some of those who were dispersed in  Poland  might have been recalled But Sir that Objection can be of no weight with you All the  Muscovite  Troops which are dispersed in  Poland  are highly necessary there and notwithstanding their large Number would have been few enough had not there been Divisions among the  Poles  themselves You may  again object they had another Body of Troops in the  Ukraine  which they might have recalled and placed in the Heart of the Empire But in this Case how would they have been safe against the  Turks  and  Tartars  who threatned them with an Invasion Let us even suppose that they had resolved to recall those Troops were they not too far distant from the Capital to arrive in Time and prevent its surrender to the Enemy All these Things induce me to believe that the  Muscovites  relied on the Faith of the Treaties subsisting between them and  Sweden  and that they had been assured that no Attempt should be made contrary to their Interests They seem nevertheless to have carried their Confidence too far and a strong Body of Troops sent to  Finland  would have contributed not a little to establish their Alliance with  Sweden  and to secure their Frontiers from any Insult But the  Muscovite  Ministry probably esteemed these Precautions needless and is undoubtedly ignorant that  Utcunque se res inclinat ita ambulant foedera  They are so elate on their Prosperity and their Vanity is so excited by a Success only owing to Chance that they forget their Interests in Matters of the greatest Importance  Melius pejus prosit obsit nil vident nisi quod lubet  I need not expatiate on the Event of this Affair but be that as it will it must be allowed that the  Muscovites  have on this Occasion exposed their Sovereign and the whole Nation to too great a Danger Had  Sweden  more narrowly watched her Interests  Petersburg  must have yielded to her superior Power and none of the great Projects formed by the  Muscovites  would have taken Place The Admiralty of  Petersburg  you know takes Charge of whatever relates to the  Russian  Maritime Assairs If therefore this Capital had fallen into the Hands of the  Swedes  of what Use would not  Cronstadt  with all the Ships which lye there have been to them The taking of this City only would I am well assured have been attended by the Loss of all the Conquests the  Muscovites  have made and consequently have driven them back within those Bounds to which it is the Interest of several Princes if not of all  Europe  to confine them Hence you may see what Danger the  Muscovites  have exposed themselves to by an unheard of Negligence and by not foreseeing a Storm which might have fallen upon and overwhelmed them Had the Administration of Affairs been in the Hands of the native  Muscovites  as it is of Foreigners so notorious a Blunder would not have surprized me and I could even have alledged the true Cause of such a Procedure  I believe I have already in some of my former Letters observed that the  Muscovites  could never approve of any of the Regulations made by  Peter  the Great their Sovereign and that the most honourable Employments are such a Burthen to them that they never accept of them but with the utmost Reluctance Most of them very loudly declare that the Obligation they are under of serving be it by Sea or Land is only an Addition to their Slavery In this Way of thinking which shews their Cowardice and Indolence they look on their Navy and all the Conquests they have made as the two principal Sources of all the Evils they labour under They wish for nothing so earnestly as a considerable Change in the State which may subvert all the Innovations and enable them to lead a lazy inactive Life Believe me what I here advance is far from being a Paradox for nothing would be easier to methan to evince the Truth of it I remember that during the Siege of  Dantzick  itwas a general Wish with every one that it might not be taken The Hatred they bear to the Foreigners  who formed this Project and especially to him who was entrusted with the Execution of it contributed not a little to their being so singular in their Wishes but the principal Object of their Desires was for ever to quit a Country which they greatly abhor and to return into their ancient native Country where they might offer themselves a Sacrifice to Fire and Laziness their favourite Idols  You may conclude Sir from what I have said how reasonably my Hopes were founded of receiving from the  Swedes  an Opportunity of recovering my Liberty My Disappointment must therefore be imputed to my evil Stars and to the Inactivity of the  Swedes  Whilst I was flattering my self with these vain Hopes I happened to think of an Expedient of causing my self to be taken Notice of and preventing my being buried in eternal Oblivion which you will think very odd As I was one Day leaning on my Window with my Mind employed on a thousand various Thoughts I saw the  Czarina  at a Distance with a large Number of Attendants passing through a Street which must necessarily lead her close by my Prison In order to shew my self to that Princess and to all her Court I leaned out of the Window as far as ever I could and threw up my Morning Gown which fell into Rags and could not but excite the Curiosity of those who saw it I know not whether the Empress perceived me as she was in her Coach but all her Attendants cast their Eyes on me and viewed me very attentively  This was the only Advantage I reaped from an Attempt of which I had formed great Hopes My Time I spent as usual in eating and drinking tho always very moderately in walking up and down my Chamber and sometimes in reflecting seriously on my Condition I was at the same Time exposed  to fresh Trials in which I stood in Need of all that Moderation which you have been frequently pleased to call Stupidity As the Regiments of  Astracan  and  Ingria  were on their March and only her Majesty's BodyGuards remained in the City they were obliged to send some Peasants to my Prison who were lately sent for from their Villages and whose rustick Deportment was highly disagreeable to me My Philosophy was on many Occasions of little or no Service and I was obliged sometimes to come to Blows to keep them within Bounds The Soldiers who were my Guard before and who were obliged to follow their Regiments were much more tractable and civilized but these Peasants were all barefaced Rascals ripe for any Villany Hence you may form an Idea of a great Part of the Rest of the Nation I have however observed some Disparity among the People of this vast Empire The Inhabitants of  Muscow  and those who live within fifty Leagues of that City are the most unsociable of Human Kind and hardly deserve the Name of Men As I removed from that Part of the Country I found by Degrees the People less Rustick more Humane and consequently more fit to be ranked among Men than the Inhabitants of  Muscow  and the adjacent Places The least barbarous of the  Russians  are those who live in the most remote Forests and are in their Actions guided by the mere Instinct of Nature  Besides the Inconveniencies I laboured under on Account of my new Guard I was at the same Time deprived of the kind Visits of Mr  De L'Isle  's Servant who was taken with a fit of Sickness which confined him at home This Accident hindered me a long Time from hearing any other News but what my Guard and my Stewards were pleased to impart to me Nothing afforded me greater Comfort in so doleful a Situation than the Liberty I  had of looking out at my Window where I could view the finest Part of the City On one Side of my Prison I had the Prospect of a large Garden and Palace which formerly belonged to the unfortunate Prince  Menzikoff  and which at present serves as an Academy for the Cadets I had every Day the Pleasure of seeing those young Persons perform their Exercises but have been since informed that the State entirely neglects to give them an Education becoming them and hence the Advantage expected from that Establishment is frustrated The  Muscovites  are grosly mistaken when they imagine that the only Qualification requisite to make a good Soldier and a Great Captain is the Art of performing the Exercises and knowing all the Motions of military Discipline All those who are arrived to any Perfection in the military Art have had Recourse to other Sources and learned Rudiments very different from those taught in  Muscovy  The Prime Ministers have never sufficiently weighed one Point which is that they have always been too hasty and endeavoured to run before they could creep in all their new Establishments and hence it is that they have frequently neglected the most essential Matters Instead of founding an Academy of Sciences and educating a Body of Cadets they ought to have established Colleges and Schools there to have taught the grand Principles of Religion and Morality There they should have begun the Reform they proposed and indeed if due Care is not taken in the Education of Youth how can the Nation possibly be extricated from that Barbarity in which it has been for so many Ages involved But I shall wave these Reflections which are a little too serious and perhaps not very pertinent  Such were the Objects that presented themselves to my View in one of the Chambers of my Prison I come now to the other from which I descried the  Admiralty and another very large Edifice intended for Her Imperial Majesty's Palace not finished but carrying on with great Assiduity I received the more Pleasure from the Prospect of these Buildings as I daily saw Crowds of People there and continual Changes in the Decorations Though so many different Objects diverted me for a Time yet I could not but make serious Reflections on the Causes of what I every Day beheld and was most struck with I was in the utmost Consternation at seeing the Admiralty when I begun to consider how a Nation like the  Russian  could equip and maintain so numerous a Fleet A single Man said I to my self may perform Wonders when his Genius is such as to qualify him for every undertaking and he enjoys at the same Time a sovereign Authority Such was  Peter  the Great who notwithstanding the insuperable Difficulties which he could not but foresee and actually met with was never discouraged but continued to pursue his Aim even to the last Moment of his Life His Successors have endeavoured to Walk in his Steps but with little Success The Aversion all  Muscovites  in general bear to the Sea has always been and ever will be one of the greatest Obstacles to the Accomplishment of so great a Work Those among them who have Employments in the Navy lament their Fate and look upon themselves as miserable Slaves condemned to the Gallies I leave you to judge whether the maritime Forces of this State can possibly subsist long I may perhaps be mistaken but I am persuaded their Navy will fall away to nothing It was some Time since on a Footing very different from what it is now All those fine Edifices which by that  Czar  's Order were built at  Cronstadt  have by an unpardonable Neglect already been suffered to dilapidate and this I my self have with some Indignation been an  EyeWitness of You will moreover upon an Examination of the Plan that great Prince formed for the Building of  Petersburg  find only Part of it duly executed He proposed in order to accustom his Subjects to Water to open a large Number of Canals through the City and this very thing has in several Places been neglected That glorious Emperor would during his Life never permit any Bridge to be laid across the River or his Subjects to make use of Oars in passing over By this they were laid under a Necessity of learning how to manage a Sail if they wanted to go from one Part of the City to the other These Regulations are now entirely abolished The Admiralty I have not seen but if I may give Credit to the Persons employed there every Thing is in a terrible Disorder A Report is however current in the Publick News that they levied several thousand Seamen for this Campaign The  Baltick  is not very large and we shall consequently soon know how they are to be employed I shall therefore give Credit to all that is said about them till we are better informed  As for another Fleet which is said to be intended for the  Caspian  Sea I much doubt of the Truth of that Report since there is not yet a single Vessel on that Sea I know that this Project was formed by  Peter  I and have my self seen five or six Ships at  Casan  of a particular Structure designed for those Seas but they are left on the Stocks and there probably they will still remain Besides the Seamen which were to be employed on that Occasion were recalled to  Petersburg  towards the Conclusion of and set out on their Journey at the same Time I did Be therefore assured Sir that if there are at present any Vessels on the  Caspian  Sea they are at best only some large Barks built after the Manner of the Country and made use of for the Traffick of private Persons To this I may add that  those Barks are so far from being fit to keep the Sea that I have strong Reasons to doubt whether any one of them ever sailed to  Astracan  Their Structure is very uncommon and I believe it will be somewhat new to you if I tell you that the Carriages in those Parts have two Poles and the Barks two Helms But this does not facilitate their Motion which I my self have but too much experienced  This may give you an Idea of the Fleet on the  Caspian  Sea A flourishing Commerce might I grant be established there But to bring about an Enterprize like that the  Muscovites  must be less stupid and the Ministry of that great Monarchy made up of abler Persons But nothing seems more surprizing than that as they are themselves incapable of carrying on such a Commerce they will not permit Foreigners to do it The  English  and  Dutch  it is well known have made several Attempts to establish a Trade in this Country but notwithstanding the considerable Advantages the  Muscovites  might have gained thereby those Endeavours have all been fruitless Be not therefore deluded the  Muscovites  have no such Fleet in  Asia  the Rumour is groundless and only published with a View of imposing upon the World But if they actually had such a Fleet I know not the least Benefit they could receive from it It cannot be said to be intended for Commerce since their Trade consists only in Salt Fish which is vended at  Astracan  Nor have we more Reason to believe that they propose to make Use of it in defending in Case of Necessity the Conquests they have made in  Persia  as they can neither land on the Coasts of the Province of  Kilan  nor on a great Part of those of  Schirvan  The Water is too shallow on the former and the Ground of the latter is by no Means fit for any Ship to Anchor in It would be more  advisable for the  Muscovites  to keep a good Army on Foot in those Parts than to have a Fleet there for unless they restore that Country voluntarily it is to be presumed that the former Possessors will not fail to surprize them and force them to return what they have made themselves Masters of contrary to the Laws of Nations  I had almost forgot to tell you that there is on the  Caspian  Sea a Kind of small Fleet mann'd by the Subjects of the  Muscovite  Empire I mean those bold and resolute Pirates the  Cosacks  of  Jaick  who during the Summer Season cruize with a large Number of Barks on the Eastern Coasts of that Sea They pillage and ransack whatever they meet with and as the Spoils these People make are their only Support they know neither Friend nor Ally where their Interest is concerned nay it frequently happens that they have no Regard for the  Muscovites  who fall into their Hands Perhaps it is to these Barks the  Muscovites  have given the Appellation of a Fleet and in that Case I cannot but agree with them that they have one I should only desire them to explain their Meaning more clearly when they publish News of that Kind and not endeavour to impose on the Publick  I did not intend Sir to detain you with so long Digressions and should be at a Loss to account for my being thus tedious Are not all these beautiful Objects which my ChamberWindows present to my View the Occasion of it But the Enquiry is hardly worth the Labour and besides  I am fessa labat mihi pondere cervix  LETTER IX  SIR  _I Should be glad to know what you think of my long Silence You have undoubtedly supposed me once more lost or at least that I have met with some fresh Adventure But be not uneasy Sir neither of these is the Case You need only recollect the deplorable State I have been reduc'd to and then you'll not find it difficult to guess at the Cause Whoever like me has had the Misfortune to swallow a large Dose of Poison cannot expect but to lead afterwards a lingring Life I still continue weak and am hardly able to apply my self to any Thing I was some Days ago seiz'd with so great a Heaviness that I thought I had lost the Use of all my Limbs My Mind seemed on that Occasion to receive Impressions from my Body and appeared as it were annihilated I cannot I assure you conceive the Cause of these Symptoms and very much doubt whether the most able Physicians can account for them But most certain it is that they must have been produced by some subtle Poison known only to the  Muscovites  But why do I tire you with this shocking Subject Let us mention it no more For I ought perhaps to think my self happy in feeling the Effects of it  In my last I informed you how I diverted my self in my Prison I spent my Time there as I  told you before sometimes in making serious Reflections on the State of my Affairs and sometimes in considering on Means whereby to deliver my self from my Captivity I was at a Loss what Course to take and knew not what to rely on when I received Orders to prepare to appear before the Senate This agreeable News I received on the th of  June  Be pleased Sir to take Notice of this Epoch which as I believe I have observed before is very remarkable Having been conducted to the SenateChamber I there saw an Assembly of seven or eight Lords all sitting round a Table and seeming to expect me with some Impatience I was so far from being intimidated at the Sight of these Gentlemen that it encouraged me to approach them without being dejected or expressing the least Submission They gave me a very cold Reception in a Manner seemingly perplexed They hardly dared to lift up their Eyes After a Moment's Silence one of them who had formerly been condemn'd to the Scaffold to leave his Head in the Hands of the Executioner was the first who spoke and accosting me told me in  Italian  that as they were informed that I demanded a Hearing they had sent for me to know what I had to alledge in my own Behalf I answered that as I saw no End of my Imprisonment nor could conceive the Motives of so tedious and insupportable a Captivity I had resolved three Months before to present a Petition whereby I desired to be heard what I had to say in my Justification That I now reiterated the same Demand and that the Justice of my Cause and the Equity of the Assembly removed all Doubts of not obtaining an immediate and entire Satisfaction But replied he what is your Design what is it you intend to write Nothing answered I but what is necessary to justify my Proceedings and  Conduct Could you not said he do this by Word of Mouth and what induces you to desire to do it in Writing I told him I was at that Instant ready to vindicate my self if they thought fit But that I believed I could represent Things to them in a clearer Light in Writing and that they might then make their Report of it to the  Czarina  from whom I had Reason to expect immediate Redress This they were obliged to put to the Vote and to consult among themselves what would be most proper in this Case After having made me wait a long Time they told me at last I should have Necessaries for Writing and that the next Morning they would receive my Plea I returned them Thanks and promised to begin it immediately and be ready for the appointed Hour Being asked by one of those Gentlemen whether I understood no other Language but the  Italian  I answered that I was likewise versed in the  French  whereupon he desired I would likewise draw up a Copy of my Representation in that Tongue  No sooner was I returned to my Prison than I was supplied with all Things requisite for writting and instantly begun to draw up my two Copies As I had not much Time to spare for the Completion of this Work I was obliged to be expeditious and the Length together with the Stile of it may give you Room to judge how great a Hurry I was in No one appeared the next Morning to fetch my Paper nor was it sent for till the Day following Such are the Proceedings of the  Muscovites  they act in every Thing with an unheard of Slowness and I thought my self well off to find that it was not postponed for several Weeks  I beg leave here to transcribe this Writing entire and to send it you very near the same as it was  presented to the Senate though you have in my preceding Letters already seen a Part of what was contained therein I shall be glad in the Sequel to know your Opinion of it and whether the Reasons I there alledge were not sufficient for my Justification  Fata volentem ducunt nolentem trahunt  Sed quo fata trahunt virtus secura sequetur  "I set out from  France  about the Beginning of the Year  sic jubente fata  All  Europe  was then in a profound Peace The principal Motive of my Departure from that Country was to avoid a Marriage which I should have been inevitably obliged to I travelled through  Germany  without being provided with any Pass or being ever asked for one in any Place whatsoever Being arrived at  Dantzick  I was forced to make some Stay there till I could meet with the Convenience of a Ship to carry me to  Petersburg  whither I intended to go I lodged at the House of an  Italian  named  Brunati  who then lived at  Dantzick  and continued there during my Stay in that City As I proposed to be there  incognito  I pretended to be an  Italian  Merchant and went by the Name of  Roccaforte  When I was just going to leave that Place I was told that I must provide my self with a Pass and that it was absolutely necessary as I designed for  Russia  I applied hereupon to the Magistracy of  Dantzick  and to the Person who is entrusted with the Direction of the Affairs of  Russia  in that City"  "Thus provided with two Passes I departed from  Dantzick  and arrived at  Petersburg  about the Middle of  June  My Landlord recommended me by Letter to the Acquaintance of Mr  Mariotti  To this Gentleman I freely opened my Mind and acquainted him with my Resolution of entring into military Service I told him that I was not a Merchant but a Soldier and a Person of Distinction As I was determined not to discover my real Name I took Care to pass by no other but that of  Roccaforte  Mr  Mariotti  apprized me of the great Difficulties I should meet with in the Execution of my Design but when I told him that Mr  Avolio  had offered me his Service he promised to send for him to his House and to treat with him on that Head We met all three at the appointed Hour and those Gentlemen being both of the same Opinion I was obliged to think of some other Expedient"  "I was soon fixed in my Choice and determined to go in Quest of Employment into  Persia  I had been informed that the Prince of  HesseHomburg  commanded there and as I was not ignorant of his many excellent Qualities I had Room to think that he would grant me his Protection This Resolution was confirmed by a singular Adventure which at the same Time caused me to hasten my Departure As her Majesty was one Day returning from a Review which had been taken on the Meadow on the side of her SummerPalace I was walking along the little Canal which separates the Meadow from the Garden and there I sat down with a Book in my Hand at the Root of a Tree Whilst my Mind was wholly intent on what I read Her Majesty accompanied by only three or four Persons came into a Walk of the Garden directly oposite to the Place where I sat without my perceiving her One of that Princess's Retinue came at the same Time to the Banks of the Canal and made Signs to me to rise telling me that Her Majesty was there I immediately  obeyed and after having made a very low Bow I retired some Steps backwards with a Design to depart The same Person who had spoken to me returned in the very Instant and asked me by her Majesty's Command whether I was an  Italian  I answered  Son Italiano  I am an  Italian  and instantly retired I was greatly amazed not being able to comprehend how the  Czarina  could take me for an  Italian  Had not the Canal hindered me from approaching that Princess I should perhaps have taken Advantage of so lucky an Incident and have thrown my self at her Feet to beg some Employment of her since I was in so great an Uncertainty of obtaining any elsewhere"  "I went after this Adventure to Mr  Mariotti  and begged of him to procure me an Opportunity of departing speedily I sold in the mean Time Part of my Equipage to have wherewithal to bear my Charges As I had Occasion for a fresh Pass I went my self to the College of Commerce to ask for one which they granted me by the same Name of  Roccaforte  Whilst I was employed in making Provisions for my Journey I was informed that some Professors of the Academy were preparing for an immediate Journey to  Casan  from whence they were to go to  Kamtschatki  This Opportunity was too favourable to be neglected I therefore made Enquiry directly to whom I must apply my self to be admitted into their Company I was recommended to Mr  De l'Isle  whom I thereupon visited This learned Professor gave me a very kind Reception He told me he was not to go the Journey himself but that his Brother was Having applied to him he approved of my Resolution and promised me all the Service in his Power The two other Professors received  me with equal Civility Having got every thing ready for my Journey Mr  Dela Croyere  sent me a Message to come to his House with all my Baggage in Order to depart the next Day Our Journey was nevertheless delay'd and Mr  De l'Isle  and his Wife took me in the mean Time in the most obliging Manner imaginable into their House I discovered to Mr  De l'Isle  in the Conversation I had with him my earnest Desire of undertaking the Journey to  Kamtschatki  but being informed that I must apply to the Senate for that Purpose I thought no more of it It would have been impossible to remain unknown as I desired to be if I had applied to the Senate Some other Difficulties occurring with Regard to my Journey with the Professors I resolved to set out before them with only one Servant whom  Mons de la Croyere  had been so kind as to give me"  "I met these Gentlemen at  Bronnits  from whence I continued my Journey with them to  Casan  At my Arrival I immediately made Enquiry whether any Ship was ready to fail for  Astracan  The Season being too far already advanced my Enquiries were in vain In this Juncture I thought of another Expedient and having met with a small Vessel which seemed to be convenient I had resolved to embark in it The imminent Danger I was going to expose my self to was so plainly represented to me by those to whom I communicated my Design that they at last prevailed upon me to alter my Mind After having well weighed the Matter I thought it more convenient to take the Journey by Land and to wait some Time longer As I had heard a very good Character of the Governour of  Casan  I thought it my Duty to pay my Respects to him When I accosted him I gave him my  Pass and acquainting him with my real Quality I told him that I was nothing less than a Merchant and that I thought it a Matter of little Importance to the Publick to know my real Name and Condition that I was determined to repair to  Persia  and to offer my self to the Prince of  Hesse Homburg  to serve under him in Her Majesty's Troops He bemoaned my Fate and at the same Time promised to procure me the first Opportunity for my Departure He desired to know my Name and took it down in Writing Having asked his Leave to visit him now and then he replied he should look upon it as an Honour and assured me I might rely on his Protection"  "Having taken this Step I went to  Mons de la Croyere  resolved to acquaint him with what had passed But I was hardly got into his Apartment when the Major of the Place came to arrest me by the Governor's Order and seized my Sword Nothing was found about me or in my Trunk which could give any Grounds for Suspicion In short after three Days I was carried to  Muscow  and from thence to  Petersburg  All these Circumstances being well averred and there being none of them which can admit of the least Doubt the next Enquiry is whether there was any Room to suppose me a Criminal or that I had any other Intention than that of being employed in Her Majesty's Service This Enquiry may be made in the following Manner which will at the same Time give sufficient Proofs for my Justification"  "I observed above that I quitted  France  at the Beginning of the Year at a Time when all  Europe  was in Peace This first Remark is an incontestable Proof that I could not be charged with any secret Commission from the  Court of  France  to the Prejudice of that of  Russia  But supposing even that I had not left  France  till after the Face of Affairs was changed in  Poland  by the Death of King  Augustus  can it be presumed that I should be made Choice of at so important a Juncture Ought I not on the other Hand to have taken other Measures than those which it is evident I did take and should I not have been more cautious and reserved in all my Proceedings My Behaviour was certainly not like that of a Person who endeavoured to impose upon others How can any one moreover be supposed to be an Emissary who is not in the least acquainted with the Language of that Country to which he is sent and neither provided with any Retinue nor even with an Interpreter Persons entrusted with the Management of StateAffairs are I believe seldom sent into a foreign Country without being furnished with Money or at least Credit But I came into  Muscovy  without either This last is a most convincing Proof and merits some Regard But let us go yet farther and examine all my Steps"  "The sole Motive of my Departure from  France  was to avoid a Marriage which I must otherwise have engaged in That I quitted upon no other but some such Inducement is sufficiently proved by the Manner wherein I retired from all the World from my most intimate Friends and from my Domesticks abandoning at the same Time all I possessed I know not whether any Enquiries have been made after me but if there has there can have been no other Answer but that I disappeared at the Beginning of and that none had since been able to get Information whither I was retired It is well known what Reply I made to the Question which was put to me at Her Majesty's Palace when I was  ordered to name the Person who was the Occasion of my Flight I told the Gentleman who was so inquisitive on that Head that the Sex claimed a particular Respect though it often merited not our least Regard I here beg leave to add that if a Declaration of that kind could even procure my Liberty or save my Life I should not consent to make it and were I to be guilty of so base an Action I should think my self deserving of the most rigorous Treatment from Her Majesty But what after all would a Confession of that Kind avail It would be needless for me to name the Person my self if the Affair is publickly known as others may be applied to for that Intelligence But if on the contrary this Adventure is not come to any one's Knowledge if I am the only Person acquainted with it I think my self obliged in Honour and Conscience to keep it secret But supposing I should name the Lady would my Confession be credited or would she herself be applied to to relate the Correspondence that had been between her and me Should the Boldness or Insolence be carried so far I believe the Attempt▪ would be fruitless and turn to the Confusion of him who should make it"  "It seems needless to make any Mention here of my Journey through  Germany  since most of the States through which I passed are her Majesty's Allies and Confederates I shall only take Notice of my Stay at  Dantzick  where I was known to the Gentleman who there administers the Affairs of  Russia  I led a very retired Life in that City and conversed to the best of my Knowledge with no other Person there but those of the House where I lodged I went a few Days after my Arrival to pay a Visit to  Her Majesty's Resident in that City I even had frequent Opportunities of seeing him afterwards and from him I received a Pass at my Departure If all these Proceedings be considered can it be inferred from hence that I was at that Time charged with any secret or dangerous Commission"  "Let my Behaviour at  Petersburg  be next examined I repaired on my Arrival into that Capital to Mr  Mariotti  to deliver a Letter which had been given me and begged at the same Time he would procure me a Lodging near his House I then according to the Custom of the Country carried my Pass to the Magistracy before I went to my Lodging when I went from thence to the CustomHouse to take out my Baggage I met with  Mons Avolio  who ossered me his Service As that Gentleman was not acquainted with me he immediately enquired what Profession I was of and whether I was not come to  Petersburg  with a View of following that of a FencingMaster I answered smiling that I knew how to use my Sword in my own Defence but was not a Person who would instruct others in that Art He then in very obliging Terms repeated his Offers of Service but I told him that I could not accept of them yet but should in the Sequel be glad of the Honour of a longer Conversation with him Let any one judge by these Circumstances whether I endeavoured at that Time to be concealed as was without Grounds intimated in the Examination I passed in Her Majesty's Palace But let us view what followed I took Mr  Mariotti  aside the next Morning and fully entrusted him with the Situation of my Affairs The only Secret I was unwilling to disclose to him was my real Name  As I was determined to enter into Her Majesty's Service I took his Advice how to proceed in that Case When he endeavoured to represent the great Difficulties I should meet with in my Design I told him that  Mons Avolio  had offered me his Service and that I doubted not but he would act in my Behalf in short in the Conference I had with these two Gentlemen they agreed in their Opinions that my Project could not succeed Hereupon I resolved to go into  Persia  and desire no other Favour of them but that of recommending me to their Friends Is any one of these Circumstances capable of grounding a Suspicion of my being an Emissary"  "During my Stay at  Petersburg  I own that I passed by a fictitious Name but did not however conceal my self from any one and every Body there might judge of every Step I took I frequented the House of Mr  Mariotti  with him I dieted and conversed familiarly with whomsoever I there met with I never failed being at the Catholick Church and visiting the Fathers who officiated there and this I did at Times when those Places were frequented by a great Concourse of People I discoursed indiscriminately with every one owned my self to be an  Italian  and my being come from  France  was concealed from none I walked through every Part of the City was present at all Reviews and a Spectator of all the Exercises performed by the Troops I was in fine so far from endeavouring to remain unknown that I even exposed my self to the Eyes of the  Czarina  All that can be inferred from these Things is that I concealed my Name and as I could not appear in a Manner suitable to my Birth kept within the Bounds to which the Situation of my Affairs had reduced me"  "When I sought for an Opportunity of departing from thence I was informed that the Professors were likewise preparing for a Journey to these Gentlemen I made pressing Instances to admit me into their Company which they granted I should without Doubt have carefully avoided being one of that Party had I intended to remain unknown Satisfied with what I thought I had obtained I retired to the House of Mr  De l'Isle  in Expectation of my Departure here I saw every one who came thither conversed with them and as our chief Discourse generally concerned  France  they might easily guess by what I said on that Subject my self that I was thoroughly acquainted with the  French  Court and had spent great Part of my Life in that Country My Consultation with Mr  De l'Isle  about the Journey to  Kamtschatki  was by no Means feigned and I was fully resolved to undertake it my only Aim at that Time being to retire into a Country where I might live unknown to every one Would a Person charged with any Commission have acted a Part like this I am plainly justified by the bare Consideration of these Facts"  "But to this it is objected that taking Passes in a fictitious Name manifestly proves my Guilt By a Regulation established throughout the whole Kingdom I could not obtain a fresh Pass without producing at the same Time that which I had brought from  Dantzick  Since therefore I was unwilling to be known by my real Name I was obliged to continue to pass for a Merchant and to retain the Name of  Rocceforte  This Accusation is certainly without Foundation and thus I reply to it"  "I could not in the Situation I was in and being so desirous of executing the Resolution I had taken of entring into the Service avoid a Discovery  of my real Quality and was obliged to profess my self a Soldier and to quit my Character of a Merchant Privileges of this Kind have been always allowed to Travellers the Law of Nations no ways oppose it there is no Law that forbids it it is authorized by the Custom of all  Europe  and in short Princes sometimes afford us Precedents of what I have done Unless a Traveller applies his Pass to a bad Purpose he has never been thought criminal for making use of a fictitious Name Can it be proved that I have made any Attempt to prejudice the State The publick Affairs are no ways concerned in the Change of my Name that is my Affair only"  "But it may be again objected what Occasion had I to take a Pass for  Muscow  when I designed to go else where This Accusation is no better grounded than the others for in the first Place when I required a Pass for  Muscow  I intended to take that Route and should actually have done it had not some new Difficulties which I could not foresee induced me to change my Resolution In the second Place when I produced my Pass I was told that it would be needless to take any other and that with this I should find an uninterrupted Passage throughout  Russia  and lastly as my first Pass had cost me five or six Rubles and I was not very flush of Money I thought I might dispense with purchasing at so dear a Rate what I had no Occasion for"  "I shall not enter into a Discussion of what pass'd on my Journey from  Petersburg  to  Casan  Whoever desires to know that need only peruse my Journal on that Head which may be found amongst my Papers There may be seen an Account of the most remarkable Adventures  I met with on that Journey none of which can give any one Room to think me a suspected Person"  "Before I conclude this State of my Case it will be proper to make some Enquiry into my Conduct at  Casan  and this Article likewise merits some Consideration No sooner was I arrived in this City than my Friends represented to me a thousand Difficulties which attended the Voyage I was going to undertake they remonstrated the bad Season of the Year the Dangers I was going to expose my self to the Want of convenient Boats and at last prevailed upon me to make a much longer Stay in that City than I had proposed Not thinking it in the mean Time proper to pass for an unknown Person I went to visit the Governor and opened my Mind to him I frankly told him who I was represented to him the Situation of my Affairs acquainted him with my Designs begged he would grant me some Persons to serve for Guides and that he might have no Room to doubt of my Sincerity offered him my Sword and told him that I was ready to be his Prisoner till he could be better informed of my Quality"  "This would certainly have been the most imprudent Step I ever made had I intended to engage in any Undertaking contrary to the Interests of  Russia  I was besides under no Obligation of going to pay my Respects to the Governor I might even have been at  Astracan  before that Time by only hiring a small Vessel in any of the Cities I passed through which would have carried me thither much sooner than by the Way of  Casan  where I was oblig'd to make a long Stay Nothing hinder'd me moreover from setting Sail immediately after my Arrival at  Casan  since I met with a  small Vessel and many People offered me their Service to conduct me either by Land or Water But instead of laying hold of these Conveniences I unfortunately went to visit the Governor who instantly caused me to be Arrested and afterwards to be cast into Prison Such was my Adventure at  Casan  and it was that occasioned my Detention"  "The last Thing I have to say in Vindication of my self is that had I known my self guilty of any Crime I could many ways have avoided being carried from  Casan  to  Petersburg  nothing could have been more easy For I may venture to say without injuring my Guard that they were willing to allow me a reasonable Liberty and placed an entire Confidence in the Promise I had given them not to endeavour making my Escape I regarded them rather as my Servants than as my Guard Their Arms and my Sword were always in my Sled and in Case of Necessity I could have made Use of them I was entirely at Liberty in the Nighttime which my Attendants always spent in a profound Sleep I might easily have taken my Flight whilst I was among the  ScheremissTartars  and have retired to a Place of Safety Besides had I been willing to offer Violence Courage would not have been wanting I might have easily routed my three Soldiers As for those who conducted me from  Muscow  to  Petersburg  they hardly deserve to be mentioned Let it suffice for their Character that they were Drunkards and notorious Thieves who robbed me of whatever they could As they were neither cloathed nor armed nor behaved in any other Respect like Soldiers I know not whether I may properly regard them as such If I was guarded by these Scoundrels on my Journey  to  Petersburg  it must be imputed to my own Willingness as they were undoubtedly incapable of keeping me Prisoner"  "The Justice of my Cause is so plainly demonstrated by these several Facts that I doubt not of obtaining my Liberty so soon as they are submitted to Her Majesty's Judgment The Piety Justice and Clemency of that Princess is so well known to me though a Stranger that I am assured she will never suffer a rigorous Imprisonment to be inflicted on a Person who came into her Dominions with no other Design than that of devoting the remaining Part of his Life to her Service Most certain it is that since the first Minute of my Captivity I have been treated with as much Severity as if I had acted openly to the Prejudice of the State"  This Sir is the History of my Captivity I leave you to judge upon this Account of the Justice of my Cause Declare your Opinion sincerely and tell me without Ceremony whether you think me guilty Ought I do you think to be detained in Prison to be sent into  Siberia  or to be restor'd to my Liberty I am so well assured of your Judgment and Equity and of the Evidence of the Reasons I here alledge that I doubt not of your deciding the Matter instantly in my Behalf I shall tell you in the Sequel the Event of this Memorial  As I expected soon to know my Fate after I had delivered this Writing my Thoughts in my Prison were wholly employed upon procuring some safe Retreat where I might pass my Time agreeably Retirement and Ease were now the only Objects of my Wishes I was in the mean Time greatly perplexed in making Choice of a Place for my future Abode  France  the finest Country in the Universe represented itself to me with most attracting Charms but the Adventure which  caused my Departure from that pleasant Abode suffered me not to satisfy my Inclination All I could hope for was to live there unknown in some retired Place till some fortunate Event could give another Turn to the State of my Affairs I should have formed a Project very different had I been in a better State of Health As I was not far distant from  Poland  I should have taken the Resolution to go thither in Quest of Employment O with what Pleasure should I then have embraced an Opportunity of bearing Arms against the  Muscovites  my greatest Enemies They have given me Provocations more than sufficient to prompt me to a Revenge of all the bad Usage I have received from their Hands But unhappily for me by reducing me to a Condition which leaves me no Room to hope ever being able to bear the Fatigues of War they have deprived me of that Satisfaction My Strength could not but be enervated and my Health entirely destroyed by the Uneasiness os Mind which they continually gave me by the Hunger which they obliged me to labour so long a Time under and by the Poison they gave me  I diverted my self with all these pleasing Hopes though I was not yet assured of obtaining my Liberty And I had really Reason to fear that they would propose to me to remain in  Muscovy  and to serve in the Army A Proposal of this Kind would I confess have involved me in a fresh Perplexity I should on the one Hand have never prevailed upon my self to pass my Time in  Muscovy  and a Refusal of their Offer might on the other have been very dangerous But lest I should be put to a Nonplus in Case they should make that Proposal I resolved to excuse my self on Account of the infirm State of my Health which disabled me from bearing Arms  This Resolution being taken I had nothing to do but to be easy and wait with Patience for whatever might befal me I shall send you many more Particulars by the first Courier but you must not yet expect to hear an End of my Misfortunes  Multa diuque tuli sed plura supersunt  LETTER X  SIR  _MY last without Doubt removed all your Uneasiness on my Account and gave you some Hopes of seeing me again very soon I told you at the same Time that nothing new had befallen me The Impatience and Concern you express for which I cannot but reprove you only augment my Distress and aggravate my Grief You remind me of all my former and present Sufferings in Terms so pathetick and so moving that I cannot but be greatly affected therewith All you say of the Pleasures we have formerly enjoyed together does not alleviate my present Misery Forbear I beseech you Sir to recall past Joys to my Mind and cease to expatiate on my Misfortunes and the doleful Circumstances of my Adventures  Cur me querelis exanimas tuis  Which of us two is the most to be pitied Which has most Cause to wish my Liberty The Absence of a Friend who always had and still retains a most tender regard for you is I must own afflicting But however doleful your Condition may  be mine is much more so You have at least the Comfort of being able to ease your Mind a thousand Ways but my Fate is very different from yours Confined in a narrow Prison I see no one to alleviate my Grief and am at this very Time uncertain whether I have more Grounds for Hope or Fear You desire to know the final Term of my Miseries as if it were in my Power to fix it I pleased my self indeed with the Hopes of seeing them speedily ended but an Accident which has just happened has in a Measure frustrated all my Designs Give me Leave to relate this Catastrophe and the Manner how it came to my Knowledge  The Desire I had of being thoroughly acquainted with the Publick Affairs was one Day revived when early in the Morning I several Times heard the Noise of Cannon I would not however have you think it uncommon to be entertained in this Country with that Kind of Harmony We are every Week diverted with several Discharges of the Artillery The Revielle and Taptow are always expressed by firing Cannon and the Time of repairing to Court is made known in the same Manner A surprizing Quantity of Powder is consumed in this City It is made use of on all Days of Rejoycing which are here very frequent on all Festivals and on innumerable other Occasions It may perhaps be intended to stifle the terrible Noise and Uproar made at those Times by Drunkards But let us leave this Conjecture and enquire into the Reasons of a Discharge of the Cannon so early As this was neither the Reveille nor the Taptow nor was it the Time of Resorting to Court I immediately concluded that some extraordinary Accident must have been the Occasion of it The Situation of the Affairs of  Poland  at that Time gave me directly some Suspicion and as I was highly concerned for those Matters I could not be  at Ease till I was farther informed Above all I feared this Event be what it would might prejudice my Affairs and at the same Time frustrate all my Hopes  The Sequel but too plainly proves how well my Fears were founded but I was not apprized of the Matter so soon as I wished to be In vain I asked my Guard and begged they would inform me of what had happened I found it impossible to get any Intelligence I prevailed upon one of them to go and enquire what it was but he soon returned as wise as he went I was very uneasy all that Day and spent it with an Impatience I am not accustomed to My Corporal who was my chief Steward came the next Day and told me with a smiling Countenance that the City of  Dantzick  was surrendered to the  Muscovites  I was thunderstruck at this News which I could never have expected it surprized me and gave me very uncommon Emotions Having however recovered my self a little and taken Time to consider I begun to doubt of the Truth of the Fact I asked my Corporal whether King  Stanislaus  was taken but of this he pretended to be intirely ignorant His Answer served only to encrease my Uneasiness Dubious of the Condition to which that Prince might be reduced I begun to bemoan his Fate I entreated the Corporal to go out immediately and to procure an exact Account of all the Circumstances of that great Event and give me a Relation of what he could learn In order to encourage him to a faithful Discharge of his Commission I gave him some Pieces of Silver and promised him more on his Return But neither this little Present nor my Promises were prevalent enough to make him more speedy he did not return till the next Day when he informed me that King  Stanislaus  had been taken out of a Cellar where he lay concealed This  ridiculous Circumstance made me not give Credit to his News And how could I with any Probability imagine that King  Stanislaus  would suffer himself to be seized in that Manner He added that several  French  Men had been taken Prisoners and would soon be brought to  Petersburg  Several other Circumstances he related seeming as improbable made me suspend my Judgment upon the rest But nothing convinced me more than a second Discharge of the Artillery which I took for a clear Demonstration I then no longer doubted of what had been told me I believed that King  Stanislaus  was really fallen into the Hands of the  Muscovites  and that the  French  were made Prisoners of War All this put me into so great a Disorder that my Guard began to perceive it You know how zealous I have been and always shall be for the Interest of  France  I feared on the other Hand that this Disaster of the  French  would give some fatal Turn to my Affairs and prove an Obstacle to my wished for Releasement I not only found that the  Swedes  were out of the Question but likewise that the Project which I had before formed of retiring to the House of some Foreign Minister could not be executed without great Danger and running the Hazard of being imprisoned for the rest of my Life I was well enough acquainted with the  Muscovites  to know to what Excess of Insolence one fortunate Event could carry them Whilst they are in Prosperity they neither regard the Laws of Nations nor publick Faith nor in short  Quoecunque Altaria tangunt  As I had given my Corporal a fresh Commission to enquire after all the publick News he informed me that the second Discharge of Artillery was as  well as the former on Account of the taking of  Dantzick  that the  French  Prisoners were arrived at  Cronstadt  that the Commander in chief and a large Number of Officers were already arrived at  Petersburg  and lastly that they were that Day to dine at Court He added that King  Stanislaus  was not taken but as it was certain that he was still in  Dantzick  he would not fail of being made Prisoner as the  French  were and that he could never find Means of escaping from the narrow Search that was made after him I had now no longer Room to doubt of the Truth of the greatest Part of these Circumstances tho they all appeared very strange to me How said I within my self could so strong a City as  Dantzick  a Place so well defended fall into the Hands of the  Russians  Is it possible that the  French  Troops could surrender themselves Prisoners of War and that King  Stanislaus  could neglect repairing to some Place of Safety  The Advice my Corporal had given me of the Arrival of the  French  Officers at  Petersburg  raised in me an exceeding great Desire of seeing them and to obtain this Satisfaction I placed my self constantly at my Windows in Hopes of seeing some one by Chance pass by my Prison In this I happened to succeed and saw the chief of them in Her Majesty's Coach I knew them even by their Aspect but could not possibly distinguish any one of my Acquaintance I met soon after with an Opportunity of satisfying my Curiosity Mrs  De l'Isle  's Cook being recovered from his Indisposition paid me a Visit I immediately asked him a Thousand Questions about the present State of Affairs and tho he was not able to satisfy me in every Point I enquired after yet he acquainted me thoroughly with many Things which I was before ignorant of and which I had not been able to learn either of my Guard or their Corporal He informed me that  King  Stanislaus  had fortunately made his Escape from  Dantzick  but that nobody yet knew what was become of him That the  French  Troops which were come to the Relief of  Dantzick  had been repulsed and obliged after several fruitless Attempts to capitulate they not being numerous enough to render their Enterprize successful I wished earnestly to know what Steps the  Swedes  had taken and what passed in other Parts of  Poland  but my Intelligencer could not satisfy my Curiosity on either of those Heads  He confirmed in a second Visit his former Advice that King  Stanislaus  was no longer at  Dantzick  and that he was thought to be in Safety in some Part of the King of  Prussia  's Dominions Tho the Situation of that Prince's Affairs appeared to me very melancholy I could not but esteem him happy in having delivered himself from so imminent a Danger and escaped all the Pursuits of the  Muscovites  I could hear nothing of the  Swedes  but that they continued very peaceable without determining in Favour of either Party or that any one could penetrate their real Designs He told me the Names of the  French  Officers who had been taken Prisoners and among others nam'd  Mons de la Motthe  who was at the Head of them and is an old Acquaintance of mine I leave you to jndge how much I lamented the Fate of those Gentlemen who are thus reduced to the Necessity of giving up their Swords into the Hands of the  Muscovites  Strange Fate that Soldiers so brave as they should be obliged to submit to Slaves so vile I cannot here omit the Recital of a Story which I have heard and appears to me very singular if we may venture to give Credit thereto In the first Interview the  French  Officers had with the  Muscovite  Generals the latter addressing themselves to  Mons de la Motthe  expressed a very great Surprize that the  French  should attack  their Intrenchments without a single Discharge of Cannon To this  Mons de la Motthe  is said to have replied that was a common Method with the  French  The  Muscovite  Generals if this Story be true must certainly know very little of the present Method of making an Attnck and for their better Instruction on that Head it might not be amiss to send them into  Poland  some of those  Carabiniers  who were at the Battle of  Guastalla  The Cook from whom I received my Intelligences informed me moreover that the Articles of Capitulation granted to the  French  Troops had been violated and that the  Marquis de Monti  had notwithstanding the sacred Character wherewith he was invested been put under Confinement Had any other Nation besides the  Muscovites  been accus'd of these Proceedings I readily confess I should not have so easily given Credit to the Report of them But I was thoroughly acquainted with the Conduct and Policy of those Gentlemen and not ignorant that nothing was to them either venerable or sacred Was not therefore my Censure just When I observed before that the  Muscovites Quaecunque Altaria tangunt  whilst flushed with Success This may be called a glorious Beginning of a War To break through the principal Articles of a Capitulation to arrest an Ambassador and to detain him so long under a rigorous Imprisonment Are not these Things without a Precedent in a civilized Nation Are they so very blind that they cannot perceive the Irregularity of their Conduct The Time may come when they will perhaps have Reason to repent of it Those in whose Hands the Administration of Affairs in that Country is ought in my Opinion to proceed with more Circumspection If they will have no Regard to the Honour of the Nation or its Interests they ought at least to have the Glory of their Sovereign at Heart and not  expose it in so flagrant a Manner They have prevailed on Her Majesty by their evil Counsels to commit an Act of Injustice not only unparalleled but wholly inconsistent with her natural Candour And what can be more vile than to treat a brave Officer who is only guilty by having served his Master with Fidelity in so worthless a Manner Have they any Thing to alledge against his Conduct And with what Views do they thus detain him If I may give Credit to what I have been told at  Dantzick  the Imprisonment of that Minister crys for Vengeance and this Action must be looked upon as the blackest and most unjust that can be perpetrated The Inhabitants of  Dantzick  inform me that he kept within the Bounds of his Ministry and ought he consequently not to meet with the Treatment prescribed in that Case by the Law of Nations But let us for a Moment suppose he actually had exceeded the Bounds of his Character must he for that be deprived of all Liberty He would in any other Country if he had required it have been set free on his Parole of Honour But the  Muscovites  do not act in this Manner they obstinately persist in the Practice of their barbarous Customs and little Regard what other Nations would do in a parallel Case It is accounted a Crime in the Marquis  De Monti  that he shewed so great a Zeal for the Service of his Master and was so firmly attached to the Prince to whom he was sent I should expatiate too much on this Affair were I to make all the Reflections it would admit of I proceed therefore to what relates to my self which I intend for the Subject of this Letter  After having exhausted my Intelligencer's whole Fund I drew from him a Promise to visit me oftner and give me an exact Account of whatever he could learn This honest Man did really exert himself  on this Occasion and was of great Service to me during the whole Time of my Captivity The Pleasure I received from hearing the publick News did not however abate the earnest Desire I had to recover my Liberty To my Sorrow I found that no Answer was made to my Representation tho it had been so long presented The first Mention I heard of it was by my Steward who told me a Report was current that I should soon be released This News I the more readily believed as I thought that after I had so clearly vindicated my self they had no farther Reason to detain me in Prison I was afterwards informed that my Memorial had been referred to the  Czarina  's Cabinet Council and that from thence I was to expect a final Determination The Members of the Senate as I think I observed before are regarded only as mere Underlings entirely under the Influence of the Ministers who are Foreigners These latter govern with an absolute Power all is under their Management and their Disposal and this gave me Room to think that from them I was to expect my Liberty  My Affairs were retarded by the  Czarina  's Departure into the Country for the SummerSeason Her Majesty was accompanied by the whole Court and the Ministers of the first Rank At this Time I was once more obliged to remove to another Prison I was carried to the very Place where the Senate assembles This removal occasioned me to remark in my Journal that I had been led  ab Herode ad Pilatum  I might have added  a Pilato ad Calvarium  For after all the Miseries I had undergone I had only this last Step to take The Motive that induced them to remove me from my former Prison very plainly demonstrates how little they were concerned for my Life The Members of the Senate being apprized that the House where they met was in a ruinous State thought proper to quit it and  to assemble in that wherein I was confined What think you Sir of this Expedient to rid themselves of a Man whom they had already obliged to pass  per ignem aquam  but both without Success They probably thought that after I had withstood Poison endured the Fatigue of a long and toilsome Journey laboured under Famine and all the Miseries I had been exposed to they had no other Means left of hastning my Death than by burying me alive under the Ruins of an old decayed Building Their black Design happily for me proved abortive for Providence which had hitherto almost miraculously preserved my Life continued still favourable to me and so disposed Matters that what was intended to be the Cause of my Perdition turned to my Advantage and served only to render my Confinement more agreeable  I soon found my self beset in my new Apartment by all kinds of Artificers Architects Joyners Carpenters Masons and other sorts of People who were continually going in and out of my Chamber With Pleasure I saw so great a Concourse of People which at any other Time would have been troublesome to me I made frequent Enquiries what Condition the Building was in and whether I was not in Danger of being crushed under the Ruins of it Thus I continued in constant Fear though I was told I might depend on my Safety I entertained no great Opinion of the  Muscovite  Architects and the Person to whose Direction this Work was entrusted appeared to me not the best qualified to judge of the Danger I was exposed to As he spoke  Italian  I was curious to know by what Means he learnt that Language He told me he had travelled into  Italy  and on his Return entered into the Service of an  Italian  Architect who had instructed him both in his Language and Art His Skill in the latter was not so great that I could depend  on his Word I therefore examined every Part of the Building my self and with a Plummet in Hand shewed my unexperienced Engineer those Places which were in the most ruinous Condition He complyed pretty readily with my Directions and it happened fortunately for me that he followed them in Regard to the Arched Roof of a large Hall which stood in Need of Shoring For had he executed his first Plan and neglected the Measures I pointed out to him that Roof would certainly have fallen and drawn after it the other Parts of the Building which were all in a tottering Condition  Employments of this kind on which I spent the best Part of my Time afforded me a very great Pleasure I may truly say that the  Muscovites  are very ignorant of any Thing relating to Edifices of Stone but must do them the Justice to acknowledge that they are very expert in whatever relates to Carpentry They know the Use of no other Instrument but the Axe and this they handle with so much Dexterity that not a single Nail is made use of in the Structure of their largest Houses These Buildings are made of large Pieces of Timber joined together in such Manner that in Case of Necessity they may without much Trouble be loosened and afterwards replaced as they were before Hence you may easily judge that all these Buildings are portable Whoever is minded to remove from one part of the City to the other immediately lays his House on Carts and transports it with little Expence wherever he thinks fit All Buildings in  Muscovy  are erected in this Manner excepting some Churches and most of the Convents of the Monks who always take Care to be the best accommodated every where I have even seen some fortified Cities the Walls of which are only made of Wood Houses of this Kind in so rigid a Climate as that of  Muscovy  may be thought to be as cold as IceHouses but I'm convinced by Experience of the direct contrary and can assure you that they are all very warm nay even hot to Excess  Muscovy  may in this Regard be esteemed not a cold Country as it is generally supposed but a Country abounding with Fire and Smoak There is hardly a House in  Russia  where the Heat is not intolerable in the Winter as well as the Summer We may therefore very reasonably conclude that this contributes not a little to render the  Muscovites  lazy and sluggish  You see Sir how little my Troubles hindered me from making Observations in  Muscovy  I might extend them yet farther on the Manners of the  Muscovites  as well as their Customs but I fear I shall engage in too many Subjects at once and thereby neglect the principal Occurrences of my Captivity Give me therefore leave to return to what more nearly concerns my self  Whilst I employed my self in Architecture my Steward informed me that my Releasement was now talked of in good Earnest and that I had nothing to do but to be of good Heart  Mons de L'Isle  and his Spouse sent me Word at the same Time that they thought my Affairs in a very good Situation and that they did not doubt of seeing speedily my Troubles at an End But the Joy I conceived at hearing this agreeable News was of a short Duration I was soon afterwards told that I must not hope for any Answer to my Memorial till her Majesty's Return I had enough to do to appease the first Transports into which this second News threw me but Reason at last got the better and gave me Resolution patiently to expect whatever might befal me  I received in the mean Time numerous Presents from Mrs  De L'Isle  who frequently sent me her Cook This generous Lady loaded me with  her Benefactions and used her utmost Efforts to alleviate the Burden of my Captivity Her Cook for his Part neglected nothing that might give me a clear Insight into the most important Transactions of  Europe  By his Means I learned that two notable Battles had been fought those of  Bitonto  and  Parma  and that the Surrender of  Philipsburg  was hourly expected Such Successes rejoiced me extreamly I could not however but secretly envy the immortal Glory acquired by so many brave Officers of my Acquaintance He likewise told me that King  Stanislaus  was in Safety at  Konigsberg  that the taking of  Dantzick  had neither weakened nor dejected his Party and that this City would be restored for a Sum of Money I never doubted but the  Muscovites  would exact exorbitant Sums from the Inhabitants of  Dantzick  which I knew to be the principal Object of their Enterprize I was informed moreover by the same Messenger that all the  French  Officers were set out for  Narva  where the Prisoners of War were guarded by two Battalions of  Muscovites  An accidental Thought came on this Occasion into my Head which you perhaps will regard as strange and whimsical I had been assured that the  French  Troops made a Body of about two thousand Men a Number little inferior to that of the  Muscovites  by whom they were guarded I was not unacquainted with the intrepid Courage of the former and too well convinc'd of the Cowardice of the latter and the bad Discipline they are under Having considered these Things I said within my self might not the  French  Prisoners find Means to cut off their Guard to disarm and massacre them and then to force themselves a Passage thro the Country I was not ignorant of the Difficulty which must needs attend the Execution of that Enterprize But the Place occupied by the  French  near  Narva  has always been fertile in extraordinary Events and I was confirmed in my Opinion by recollecting the Retreat of ten thousand  Greeks  under  Xenophon  The  Greeks  of those Days were certainly not more valorous than the  French  now and the Route these latter must take to arrive at a Place of Safety is not by far so long as that taken by the former The  French  would thereby have acquired immortal Glory and the Retreat would have gained as universal an Applause as the World to this Day gives to the ten thousand  Greeks  commanded by  Xenophon  Let me entreat you before you censure this Scheme as impractible to examine in the Maps whether the Route which the  French  must have taken to join the Troops of King  Stanislaus  would have rendered the Undertaking utterly impossible Had they exerted their Valour and undergone some Fatigues I am well assured they would soon have executed this important Enterprize As for the  Muscovites  by whom they were guarded nothing could have been more easy than to have got rid of them and was you as well acquainted with that Nation as I am you would be entirely of my Opinion But to convince you yet more of what I here advance permit me to add a Word or two more of the Military State of  Muscovy  As I suppose you to be already acquainted with their Battalions and Squadrons I shall not take Notice of either of them They consist of a large Number of Soldiers but of very few Officers All these Soldiers have of late been very well cloath'd and their Arms are pretty good excepting their Swords They retain notwithstanding this a certain Air which is by no Means to their Advantage and which none of them have ever been able to shake off They make a wretched Appearance and are far from being dextrous They are well enough made very robust and advantageously  shaped but they are if I may Use the Expression lifeless Bodies which are not put in Motion without great Difficulty As for their Discipline they are constantly exercised and handle their Arms pretty well But when they come to give Fire their Emulation only consists in endeavouring to make the most Noise without ever concerning themselves whether they hit the Mark or their Shot is lost  They have always appeared to me very much embarrassed when they perform their Evolutions  Nothing surprizes me more than to see what a Value they set upon their Grenadoes for not a Day of Exercise passes but they throw a prodigious Number of them and they take a particular Care to choose the most able Men for Grenadiers They have hardly any Regard for their Swords and all that I have seen in the Hands of my Guard during the whole Course of my Captivity are roundpointed I could not forbear smiling at the Manner whereby they account for this Those pointed Swords say they are useless as long as we have Bayonets Poor ignorant Wretches not yet to know what Use may be made of a Sword The  Swedes  have nevertheless formerly taught them the Benefit of this Weapon which I wonder to find they have so soon forgot It is not my Design here to censure this their Custom as 'tis not very material how they Act provided they know how to make an Attack and to defend themselves  But this is not all The  Muscovite  Troops discover neither Emulation Valour nor Conduct Qualities inseparable from a good Soldier Neither Officers nor Soldiers are ever seen to aim at distinguishing themselves by any conspicuous Action Neither one nor the other have any Motive for engaging in Military Service but that of obeying  the Orders of their Sovereign Thus have I shewn you in few Words what Idea we can have of the  Muscovite  Troops I have formerly told you their Number let us now therefore examine what regards their Maintenance  The Apparel of the  Muscovite  Troops is pretty good but their Pay is very bad Those who are garrisoned at  Petersburg  have only an Allowance of Bread and about fifteen  French Deniers per diem  Those who are in the Inland Countries are obliged to be contented with only seven or eight  Deniers  a very poor Pay indeed The Allowance of the Officers is likewise very moderate and far from being sufficient to enable them to keep a tolerable Table However trifling this their Pay may seem it suffices nevertheless for them and a larger Salary would be needless The  Muscovites  are content with a very little Their ordinary Food is only Bread with a little Salt and some Water When they have no Bread they eat Pease Beans or Vegetables They are out of Danger of being starved with Hunger for if they are destitute of Bread Meat and Pulse they can browse upon Grass and eat all kind of Roots without the least Inconvenience attending it Bodies so robust might form excellent Troops were it possible to inspire them with other Souls and other Minds The Horses in  Muscovy  are endued with very near the same Qualities as the Men for they feed upon whatever they meet with and are not the less vigorous  Hence you may judge how easily a good General at the Head of the  Muscovite  Troops might support his Army he would neither stand in need of Bread nor Cattle a few Pulse some Herbs and Roots would be more than sufficient and these Provisions may be had every where with little Trouble and Expence 'Tis happy for the neighbouring  Nations that those Troops will never be able to render themselves formidable and though their Fame in  Europe  is at present very great yet the Time will come when their Weakness and Impotence will be universally known There are not wanting those who for some Time past have entertain'd too favourable an Opinion of this Nation There was hardly a single  Muscovite  Soldier before the Siege of  Dantzick  who had ever seen a Musket fired and the World has nevertheless loaded them with Praises which they by no Means deserve People may entertain what Notion they please of these Soldiers but I should be glad to see their Performances in a Battle and till then I shall hardly be inclined to bestow any Encomiums on them I believe they may stand their Ground for a Time for they are sturdy enough but at the same Time it is more than probable they will not be for fighting  Peter  I after the Battle of  Narva  where all his Army was routed was thoughtful of an Expedient to hinder his Troops from taking to their Flight but could find no better than that of forming a kind of second Line behind each Battalion and Squadron whom he strictly enjoined to fire upon every one that should be so cowardly as to retreat This Precaution will in all Probability be still made Use of to force their Soldiers to stand their Ground and not be so easily broken When they see themselves between two Fires they may sometimes perhaps be obliged to make a Virtue of Necessity But can you imagine that Troops who stand in Need of such a Spur can ever fight with Courage and Vigour I much doubt or believe rather that these poor  Muscovites  seeing themselves between two Fires will rather submit to be massacred and cut to Pieces without making any great Resistance But instead of detaining you with  these Conjectures let us rather examine the great Exploits performed by these Troops since their coming into  Poland  In my Passage through  Dantzick  I was informed as I believe I told you before that the  Muscovites  had not distinguished themselves by any one conspicuous Action during the Siege of that City This is so true that in the Course of six or seven Months they could not even gain the Outworks of the Place though they are at some Distance from the Town and only fenced with Pallisedoes What valiant Deed have they rendered themselves famous by since the Surrender of that City They have pursued and endeavoured by Force to reduce the Troops who followed the Party of King  Stanislaus  but hitherto their Efforts have been fruitless The Troops of King  Stanislaus  which the  Muscovites  attempted to overthrow hardly deserve the Name of regular Troops The  Muscovites  on the contrary had in diverse Places several large Bodies of Troops in the Field which were more than sufficient for a greater Enterprize The Troops of King  Stanislaus  notwithstanding this keep their Ground in  Poland  traverse the whole Country in the very Sight of the  Russian  and  Saxon  Armies intercept their Convoys and have insulted and even beat their Enemies in several Skirmishes Hence you may judge what the Event would have been if a Body of about fifteen thousand  French  Foot had joined the  Polish  Cavalry The  Muscovites  would beyond all Doubt have soon be enrouted and the  Poles  might justly have said  Jam Scythoe laxo meditantur arcu  Cedere Campis  What I here assert would infallibly have happened and we should soon have seen the  Muscovites  under a Necessity of evacuating  Poland  A General who is but never so little acquainted with the  Russian  Troops would meet with no great Difficulty in subduing them He need only to attack and press upon them vigorously without giving them Time to recollect themselves and then harrass them by Marches and CounterMarches which would infallibly draw them into several Blunders Let them but be fatigued and tired out with continual Motion Day and Night for some Time and you may depend upon seeing these GrassEaters at other Times so vigorous lye sprawling on the Ground and giving way to allpowerful Sleep There is not a Nation in the World that require more frequent and longer Sleep than the  Muscovites  I am sure that if after they have been thus kept in Motion an Enemy should fall upon and surprize them he would find them all in a profound Sleep As they know their Infirmity in this Respect they commonly take Care to fortify their Entrenchments sufficiently or to gain some advantageous Post The Conduct of a General consists therefore in this Case in dislodging and decoying them into a Place where they may be attacked after which nothing farther is requisite than to advance towards them briskly with Sword in Hand to attack them vigorously and to fall upon them without regarding their first Fire And in this Manner they are certainly routed beyond a Possibility of rallying But I have detained you long enough on this Subject and I likewise hear a Discharge of Artillery which probably proclaims the  Czarina  's Arrival Rejoice with me who am on the Point of seeing my Miseries and my Adventures at an End My next Letter will bring you nothing but agreeable Tidings What a Happiness  it will be to me to quit a Country in which I have endured innumerable Troubles and Missortunes I now please my self with the Hopes of finding soon some agreeable Solitude where I may  Ducere sollicita jucunda oblivia vitoe  LETTER XI  SIR  _BEFORE I begun to write this Letter I intended only to advise you that I was freed from my Captivity and upon the Point of quitting  Muscovy  Upon second Thoughts I altered my Design and believed it proper to continue the History of my Captivity and to inform you of the Issue of my Adventures The Perusal of this last Letter will perhaps give you Cause to be surprized at the Constancy with which I have undergone so many different Trials as would perhaps have thrown any one but my self into Despair I have many a Time earnestly wished you an EyeWitness of the Evils I have struggled with and of the Heroick Courage with which I have born them I am not induced to speak in this Manner either out of Presumption or with any Design of attracting your Praises The Familiarity you Honour me with is such that I may tell you my Mind without any Disguise and you know me so well that you cannot think me capable of deceiving you I am not ignorant and I think it my Duty to acknowledge that the Hand  of the Almighty after having humbled me has graciously vouchsafed me Relief to prevent my total Fall 'Tis the same Hand that loosened my Chains after having suffered me to be bound with them and after a rigid Captivity has set me at Liberty that in fine after having led me to the very Brinkof the Grave has restored me as it were by a Miracle to my Health These Calamities which I have undergone seem by a providential Disposition to have been intended to recall me from my past Errors  Hinc omne Principium huc refer exitum  But to continue the Sequel of my Adventures and leave these Reflexions In my last I informed you that it had been signified to me I could not be released from Prison and obtain my entire Liberty till the  Czarina  's Return and that with the utmost Impatience I waited for the happy Moment This gave me Room to hope that my Liberty would then in good Earnest be thought of I found nevertheless maugre all these Promises no small Difficulty to bring my Affairs to an End I could not conceive how they could be so long put off after having been in the Hands of such eminent Ministers The Matter was not of so great Importance but they might have been concluded in one Day The only Points they had to examine were whether I was to be deemed a Criminal in  Muscovy  for having had an Adventure in  France  and whether I ought to be detained Prisoner for having travelled by a fictitious Name These were in Reality all the Crimes I could be accused of and for which I had been arrested  Whilst I was thus in Hopes every Minute of being set at Liberty I was seized with a fresh Distemper which was the more fatal as I had not then perfectly recovered my former Strength A certain kind of Wine which had been given me to drink without my perceiving immediately that it was damaged caused this Indisposition I was soon reduced  to a very pitiful State My Sickness was violent it increased daily and I had no Prospect of any Remedy Since they were so cruel as to refuse me a Physician at a Time when I stood yet more in Need of one I could not expect they would grant me that Favour now After having for some Days endured the most exquisite Pains I found my self at last necessitated to demand an Interpreter  I obtained one at Length after many Prayers and Intreaties who came to me on the th of  September  Take Notice I beseech you of this Epoch and recollect what I mentioned of it formerly I thought proper to acquaint this Person with my Condition I told him that I had Occasion for a Physician and should be glad if Mr  Du Vernoi  Professor of Anatomy might be permitted to visit me I had the Pleasure the next Day of seeing Mr  Du Vernoi  come into my Prison accompanied by my Interpreter I leave you to judge how much I rejoiced to see him I thought my self happy in being allowed to converse with a reasonable Creature a Satisfaction I had not enjoyed for a very long Time His Presence only was in Part my Cure But I represented my Case to him and he assured me that I should have all the Assistance I might stand in Need of The Interpreter who stayed with us whilst I discoursed with this Gentleman acquitted himself of his Commission with a most surprizing Dexterity He had doubtless been charged to hearken attentively to whatever was spoke in Order to make his Report of it afterwards For when I chanced to drop a few  Latin  Words which were unintelligible to him he desired to know what I said I satisfied his Curiosity and even added that I had no Secret to communicate to any one and that the only Thing I had long earnestly wished for was to inform the  Czarina  and her Ministers of all my Affairs Diffidence  is really carried to too great a Height in  Muscovy  even in Matters of the least Importance  Mr  Du Vernoi  retired after a pretty long Visit with a Promise to return and keep me Company all the next Day This Favour which I little expected occasioned me to think that I should now meet with different Treatment and not fail of being soon set at Liberty But these Hopes which appeared so well grounded were of a very short Duration Mr  Du Vernoi  who had promised to visit me the next Day never came and in vain I expected him the Day following in short I saw him no more during my Captivity I could never be apprized by any one what could be the Cause of this Disappointment Mr  Du Vernoi  was a Gentleman of too much Discretion to mention it to me but I could easily conceive the Motive As I was well assured that this celebrated Anatomist would have performed his Promise I soon conjectured that he had received an Order to the contrary of which I am persuaded for the following Reason In the Conversation I had with him I entered into a circumstantial Account of the Disease I had laboured under at my Departure from  Muscow  without however mentioning my Suspicion of having been poisoned The Interpreter who heard all I said may be presumed to have acquainted the Ministers therewith and they being apprehensive this Mystery of Iniquity would be detected enjoined Mr  Du Vernoi  to pay me no farther Visits To supply the Want of a Physician they sent me some Medicines by an unknown Person I resolved not to make Use of any of their Drugs but to wait for my Cure from the Strength of my Constitution only The Relief I every Day received from Mr  De L'Isle  and his Spouse and which sufficed for the best Part of my Necessities contributed not a little to the Recovery of my Health I may justly  say that to them I am indebted for my Life for had I not met with this Succour from their Hands I must infallibly have sunk under the Weight of my Miseries  The  Muscovites  not only refused me what was requisite for my Health as well as my Food but likewise suffered me to be almost naked This cruel Treatment obliged me once more to ask for an Interpreter My Request was complied with and I desired him to remonstrate to those Gentlemen that  "since the Proofs I had given of my Innocence appeared to them not sufficiently convincing for my Releasement and since the Motive of Christian Charity was not strong enough to induce them to grant me the Assistance requisite for my Health I hoped at least that they would so far regard the Glory of her Majesty's Name as not to reduce me to so miserable a Condition to be even destitute of wherewithal to cover my Nakedness and that in short they would order the Cloaths which were in my Trunk to be delivered to me for my Use"  This Interpreter returned the next Morning and in Answer to my Desire said that a Present of ten Rubles had been ordered for cloathing me Dissatisfied with this Answer I told him that I did not want their Money and that if they would not grant me my Cloaths I begged they would send me a Taylor whom I might order to make me what I stood in Need of The Interpreter retired and I saw after this neither a Taylor nor my Cloaths insomuch that I was obliged to remain in my Prison half naked tho the cold Season was already pretty far advanced  It may not be improper here to take Notice that nothing could be done without the precise Order of the Senate and that consequently it is they who have been the Cause of all the bad Treatment  I have met with These Gentlemen were at that same Time once more pleased to oblige me to shift my Prison and as they begun to feel the Cold in the new Apartment they were in removed to their former House which had been repaired and sent me to that which they left This last Change was no Inconvenience for I was in a larger Place where I enjoyed a greater Tranquility  I silently pass by a large Number of Occurrences of little Importance as I hope that this Letter will be the last which I shall write to you for I should never have done were I to attempt an accurate Account of every Circumstance of my Captivity I shall rather now entertain you with an Account of my Releasement and the Means that were made Use of to procure it I shall with much greater Pleasure relate these Circumstances and inform you of the happy Hour when I heard this good News than of the Calamities I have undergone since the Reginning of my Imprisonment  It was the th of  October  when Word was brought me that I should soon be set at Liberty This News which was certainly the most agreeable I ever received in my Life was communicated to me that Day very early by a  German  Secretary who was accompanied by an Interpreter He told me in the  Czarina  's Name that I was released and that a hundred Rubles had been granted for my Travelling Charges I returned these Gentlemen Thanks for the Trouble they had taken assuring them at the same Time that I should receive whatever should be offered me by Her Majesty's Order with a most profound Deference They asked me then whether I had any further Commands to which I replied that I desired nothing else but that they would prepare the necessary Passes for my speedy Departure This was all the Discourse I had with those Messengers But  I repeated my Entreaty to the Interpreter to procure me the Key of my Trunk in order to come at some Cloaths that I might pay a Visit to my Friends He promised instantly to comply with my Desire  Here I imagine I see you congratulating me with a smiling and satisfied Countenance on this happy Change but moderate I beseech you for some Time at least your Transports of Joy This News was still only an Amusement In vain I expected during the whole Day to see them come and open my Trunk and discharge my Guard I eat nothing but a Morsel of dry Bread for as I proposed to Dine with Mr  De L'Isle  I had provided nothing The next Day I saw none but my Steward who gave me some Victuals without telling me a Word of what had passed At Length on the th that remarkable Epoch I was honoured with a kind of Ambassy consisting of an Interpreter three or four Clerks and several other Persons The Interpreter broke Silence and said that he brought a hundred Rubles to give me as a Present from her Majesty I answered that I should receive them with a profound Respect and that he need only lay them on the Table This he refused to do under Pretence that I must first count them To this I replied that it would not become me to be so scrupulous in what I received as a free Gift But he having renewed his Instances and told me that he must have a Receipt I no longer hesitated at doing what he desired He then gave me the Key of my Trunk which I opened in his Presence shewing him that there were a Sword and two Pistols I would gladly have prevailed on him to discharge my Guard but he gave me to understand that he could not take so much upon himself having received no Orders for that Purpose He then asked me what Route I intended  to take when I departed and whether I chose to go to  Dantzick  or  Lubeck  I answered that my Design was not to repair to either of those Cities and that I should chuse to travel by Land not by Sea He told me that I would not be permitted to go by Land and that Orders had already been given for my imbarking  This Procedure appeared very singular and even extravagant upon which I told my Interpreter that I would write two or three Words to beg that this Order might be countermanded He told me that he could not take any Writing from my Hands I desire then said I you would tell those who sent you that I little value my Liberty if it cannot be granted me but on Condition of my going to Sea in the infirm State of Health I am reduced to and in so advanced a Season that my Life would be endangered by such a Voyage which I could never believe to be her Majesty's Intention Whilst I was thus discoursing with him he took Occasion to ask what induced me to refuse a Post in the  Russian  Army I perceived by the Manner wherein he asked this Question that it was only to pump me I therefore gave him no other Reply than that I did not desire any Employment and that my Sickness had rendered me incapable of Service This last Question gave me very great Uneasiness for I should have been very sorry to be obliged to remain in  Muscovy  But thus our Conversation ended  In this Manner I was set at Liberty as they called it though I was still accompanied by my Guard of whom one had always his Sword drawn My Steward came soon after the Interpreter was gone and told me that I must no longer expect to be dieted as I had been but must provide my self with all Necessaries I was at first concerned at this News but when I considered that Mr  De L'Isle  and his Lady would not fail to continue their kind Assistances I resolved to acquaint them with all that had passed and beg they would favour me with a Visit My Steward who undertook to carry this Message himself apprized them of my Desire and they soon came to see me  O qui complexus gaudia quanta fuere  This Interview made me forget all I had suffered in  Muscovy  I then recollected all the Tokens of Friendship I had received from those generous Persons in order to express my grateful Acknowledgments I was so touched with a Sense of their Benefactions that I could not forbear shedding some Tears They both answered the Protestations I made in Terms which still augmented my Tenderness After the first Transports of Joy which Hearts susceptible of a real Friendship always feel on the like Occasions Mrs  De L'Isle  was thoughtful of giving me fresh Marks of her Benevolence As she knew that I was on the Point of undertaking a long and fatiguing Journey she desired to see the few Cloaths they had left me and having found my Linnen in a frightful Condition she sent the greatest Part of it to her House to be mended that it might serve me during my Journey Could Friendship be carried to a greater Height But what farther Kindness did not she shew me even till the very Moment of my Departure She paid me many charitable Visits provided me with Diet and all other Necessaries and in short omitted Nothing wherein she could be in the least serviceable to me Having been informed that I eagerly wished to know what had passed in  Europe  during my Pilgrimage and Captivity to satisfy my Curiosity on that Head she found Means of conveying to me all the NewsPapers The Service she did me on  that Occasion was one of those of which I was most truly sensible  This first Visit was pretty long and they came the very next Day again accompanied by Mr  Du Vernoi  I told this Gentleman that I did not in the least doubt but he would have continued to visit me had he not been forbid and that I thought my self never the less oblig'd to him They spent great Part of that Day in my Chamber and nothing could be a greater Satisfaction to me than an Opportunity of conversing with so agreeable Company after having been during the Space of more than a Year as it were deaf and dumb I might then very justly say  Verba intermissa retento  Not a Day passed but they visited me and especially Mrs  De L'Isle  who gave me each Time some new Marks of her Benevolence  Nothing hindered the Completion of my Happiness but the Resolution that had been anew taken to oblige me to go away by Sea The Weather happened luckily for me to be very frosty at the Time of my intended Departure insomuch that those who had already laid out my Way were obliged to change their first Design and to grant what I had so earnestly desired The River was in a few Days frozen up and the Way to  Croonstad  which I was to have taken was no longer practicable Providence seemed designedly to frustrate all the wicked Designs of my Enemies and to perform continual Miracles in my Behalf  Nemo tam pater quàm Deus  Pleased with the Change which had happened I thought of nothing more than making the necessary Preparations for my Departure I only feared the  Muscovites  would find some Pretence or other for laying fresh Obstacles in my Way They had deceived me so often that I could no longer depend on their Word And indeed though it  had already been declared to me in her Majesty's Name that I was at Liberty and that to defray the Expence of my Journey the Sum of Rubles had been given me I was still confined in my Prison and continued to be under the Inspection of a Guard who watched all my Steps I could not I confess conceive the Cause of this Proceeding I was told on the one Hand that I was entirely released and my Guard on the other Side received strict Orders not to let me go out of their Sight I looked upon the Liberty they had given me to make use of my Sword and Pistols as a Snare laid for me to draw me into some Quarrel that they might have a fresh Pretence to detain me in Prison They sent besides many People into my Prison and especially my late Steward to persuade me to enter into Service in the  Czarina  's Troops These Persons I looked upon as so many Spies whom I had Reason to distrust However not to provoke their Rage I alledged the same Excuses which I had before made to the Interpreter without expressing the least Discontent at the Usage I had received They thought perhaps that since I came into  Muscovy  with a View of procuring some Post in the Army I should not refuse to accept of an advantageous Offer But these Gentlemen were grossly mistaken I should rather have chosen to spend the Residue of my Days in a Desart than to live among them This may perhaps be the Effect of Prejudice but I look upon  Muscovy  as a Place of Banishment where some few Foreigners are the only sociable Creatures that are to be met with  Such was the Situation of my Affairs when Mr  De L'Isle  and his Wife who still continued to visit me invited me to dine with them and spend a Day at their House They probably knew that Favour would not be denied me and that I should  obtain it without any Difficulty I therefore made the Request and found it immediately complied with My former Steward with several others were ordered the first Day of my going abroad narrowly to watch my Steps Just before I went out of my Prison I told him that I hoped I might now have a Barber and not be at the Trouble of shaving my self To this he replied that he knew not whether I could be allow'd one but that he would go and enquire At his Return he told me I might be shaved but must leave my Sword in my Chamber I obeyed and went to Mr  De L'Isle  's where I had the Pleasure of spending the rest of the Day  I cannot express the Joy with which I was received in that House where even the Servants endeavoured to outvie each other in rendring me their Services I had that Day no Cause to complain of the Behaviour of my Guard but they afterwards carried their Insolence to such an Excess that I resolved to go out no more At the same Time I acquainted the Ministers with all that had passed declaring that I chose rather to continue in my Prison than to be thus exposed to the abusive Treatment of my Guard who had not the least Regard for me and behaved as disrespectfully to the Persons to whose Houses I was invited As I received no Answer I chose to remain quietly in my Chamber 'till I could obtain Leave to go abroad alone Orders were a few Days after given to my Guard to sheath their Swords and to withdraw into my AntiChamber This was the first Time during a whole Year that I had been alone without any one to inspect my Actions It is somewhat uncommon that a Person confined to a narrow Prison should so ardently wish to be deprived of all Company But this was nevertheless my Case for an entire Solitude was to me much more agreeable  than to be always infested with the Company of those Animals  All necessary Preparations were in the mean Time made for my Journey and nothing farther was wanting for my Departure but the Passes they had promised me Some Papers which I had been robbed of at  Casan  were still in the Hands of the  Muscovites  But they were not so very momentous as to give me any Uneasiness I had already for several Days made pressing Instances for Leave to depart but having met with no Answer I wrote a short Memorial wherein  "I remonstrated to those Gentlemen that a longer Stay would put me to greater Expences and that I should be thereby reduced to a Want of Money for my Journey I likewise begged that they would procure me Passes from the Ministers of those Princes through whose Dominions I was to pass in Order to return to  Italy  I desired in the last Place that they would restore my Papers and if they thought that the short Journal from  Petersburg  to  Casan  contained any Thing mysterious they were welcome to keep it I said the same with Regard to another Paper in which I had made several Observations on the  Wolga  and told them that they were extracted from  Olearius  "  After I had finished this Memorial I would have given it to an Interpreter who came for a fresh Receipt for the Rubles which the  Czarina  had presented me with But he refused to receive it and I was obliged to tell him the Contents of it I was too well acquainted with the  Muscovites  to be in the least surprized at this Procedure I easily guessed at the Inducements they had not to hear me Give me Leave to acquaint you with this whole Affair which is of no great Honour to these Gentlemen  You may remember I told you before that I had been robbed of Part of those Cloaths and Effects which were locked up in my Trunk In order therefore to prevent my coming to any Expostulation on that Head they thought proper to forbid every Body to receive any Representation or Writing from my Hands They supposed without Doubt that the Sum given me was more than sufficient to make good the Loss I had sustained by what had been taken from me But they were strangely mistaken for the Damage was very considerable This Sir was the only Motive that induced them not to give Ear to me and to refuse the Acceptance of any Papers I might offer Such is the Treatment a Stranger is to expect in  Muscovy  where it is a very difficult Matter to procure Justice But I was their Pastime on many other Occasions and I may truly say that I was their Victim from the first Hour of my Captivity till the Moment of my Departure Besides the many Instances I have given you of this I beg leave to mention one more  More than a Month had passed since it had been signified to me that I was at Liberty and yet Icould not be permitted to quit the Country This Slowness of proceeding made me very uneasy and gave me some Suspicions I feared a Proposal of staying in  Muscovy  and was not ignorant of the Danger that would attend a Refusal of an Offer in their Troops  On the d of  November  it was at last told me I might set out directly This Message was brought me by my former Steward who at the same Time asked me how many Horses I would have I told him that I should have Occasion for four but was resolved not to go till I had received my Writings and the necessary Passes An Interpreter came the next Day to bring me Rubles  which he had been ordered to give me and assured me that the following Day was fixed upon for my Departure I answered that the Sum which the  Czarina  had already been pleas'd to send me was sufficient to defray the Expence of my Journey but when he replied that he offered me this farther Sum by Her Majesty's Order I could not but accept of it with Deference and give him a Receipt for it I had too great a Veneration for the Name of the  Czarina  not to receive most submissively whatever could be offered me by her Orders otherwise I assure you I should have flatly refus'd this Money as I was not destitute of wherewithal to supply all my Wants  As I no longer doubted of going the next Day after the Assurances I had just before received I gave immediate Notice thereof to Mr  De L 'Isle  and his Spouse who came directly with Mr  Du Vernoi  to spend the Day with me Though I had now Reason to think my self at the Height of my Wishes yet my parting from them very much affected me The Regret with which I left Mr  De L'Isle  and his Spouse was the greater as I had no Hopes of ever seeing them again nor of giving them any Tokens of my Friendship and Acknowledgement Mrs  De L'Isle  not satisfied with the Favours she had till then bestowed on me would again furnish me with a large Quantity of Provisions  Every Thing was ready for my Departure the next Day which was the th when a Messenger came and told me that I must still wait till the th which was to be the Day of my entire Deliverance My Papers were sent me at Ten in the Morning but they retained Part of them with the Journal I mentioned above I was then asked when I intended to set out and having answered the sooner the better they said they would go and fetch the Horses As for the Passes which I had  so often demanded they promised indeed that I should have them but never performed their Promise Was not this an Instance of crying Injustice thus to oblige a Man to travel without a Pass in the Situation which the Affairs of  Europe  were then in Their being themselves so scrupulous on that Head makes me the more astonished at it for if a Stranger happens unfortunately to come into their Country without being provided with one he is sure to be exposed to Slavery for several Years The only Pass I could obtain was in the  Muscovite  Language and you shall soon see what Terms it was conceived in But I must leave this Subject and proceed to an Account of my Journey  I set out from  Petersburg  at four o' Clock in a Sled and took the Road for  Narva  from whence having continued my Journey with Speed and Success I arrived at  Riga  on the third of  December  in the Afternoon The Person who had been appointed my Guide carried me to the House of General  Felkersham  That Gentleman gave me a very kind Reception and treated me in a Manner that shewed the Difference between a  German  and a  Muscovite  After the first Compliment he told me that I need only appoint the Time when I intended to continue my Journey and he would give the necessary Orders I replied that I was entirely dependant on his Pleasure but since he was so kind as to give me my Choice I begged he would let me depart as soon as possible He answered in the most obliging Terms that I might go instantly if I pleas'd but that he hoped I would at least honour him with my Company that Night I signified to him that I was not in a Condition to accept so kind an Offer and being very weary begged he would permit me to look out for a Lodging that I might immediately go to Rest After having renewed his Intreaties  he suffered me to go and by his Order I was lodg'd in a House near his where he sent me a very elegant Supper Every Thing was prepared for my Departure the next Morning As I had no Time to lose I repaired immediately to the General to take my Leave of him and to express my most grateful Acknowledgments He introduced me into his Lady's Apartment to drink a Dish of Tea I there found two very beautiful and accomplished Ladies which made me not a little ashamed to appear in their Presence in a Dress little better than that of a Savage After having breakfasted I I retired very well satisfied with the Reception I had met with  I then set out with a Secretary a wellbred Man who had Orders to accompany me as far as the Confines of  Livonia  So great a Thaw had happened that in crossing the  Dwina  I found the Water a Foot deep above the Ice insomuch that I travelled that Day more by Water than by Land I lay by that Night and when I was about to depart the next Morning Mr Secretary in a very polite Manner addressed himself to me and paid me a  Muscovite  Compliment which he had probably been charged with He delivered to me a  German  Pass and told me that by Her Majesty's Order he gave me Notice I was now entirely at Liberty but that I was forbid ever to set Foot in the  Muscovite  Dominions again At first this Compliment greatly enraged me but I had a sufficient Command over my Passion to moderate it and not to give him the Answer it deserved I only told him that they had Room to think such a Prohibition needless but since it had been thought necessary he might assure his Masters that the  Czarina  's Orders should be punctually observed  What think you Sir of this last Step Was this a Compliment to make to a Man whom they  had found as innocent as a Lamb I ought to have informed those Gentlemen that if it should ever be my Fate to come into their Country again it should be in so good Company that they would find it a little more difficult to seize my Sword than at my Arrival at  Casan  and that I never intended to appear again in  Muscovy  unless it was with Fire and Sword But am I not to blame to wish them Harm Was it not a great Favour to permit me thus to go out of their Country and did I not quit it at an easy Rate after having been in Danger of being shut up and buried there for Life For by the  Muscovite  Politicks a Man is to be irretrieveably undone after they have proceeded so far as to abuse him as they had done me without a just Pretence unless they would endeavour to detain him by such kind Treatment as might make him forget all that is past They have therefore not used me with that Rigour which is prescribed by their Politicks and I ought consequently to acknowledge my self obliged to them I am not less beholden to them for suffering me to depart For the Life I could have led in  Muscovy  I should have esteemed as a continual Death They probably thought that an  Italian  could never pardon them for the bad Usage he had received from their Hands and following the Maxims of a salutary Policy they chose rather to have an Enemy without Doors than in their own Country They judged it perhaps likewise improper to detain a Man who would not be governed by their Pleasure though a Slave and who might some Time or other find Access to a Person from whom they carefully conceal those Things which she ought to be best acquainted with To all these Motives may be added that the  Muscovites  are already burthened with many Strangers whom they mortally hate and that they are very unwilling to see any more settled  among them But be that as it will I am resolved to forget them and to abandon them to their own Remorse if they are capable of having any  Here I should conclude my Letter and the Recital of my Adventures for since the  Muscovites  will not be farther mentioned you must not expect to hear any Thing extraordinary or that may excite your Curiosity But  Restabat Fatis aliquid  of which I must give you an Account  After having left my Secretary I proceeded to  Mittau  the Capital of  Courland  where I was obliged to stop As I found it impossible to travel any farther in a Sled because of the Thaw I was necessitated there to hire a Wheelcarriage I got one made after the Manner of the Country to carry me as far as  Memmel  the first City in  Prussia  In this Journey I met with diverse Adventures The first of these appears somewhat Romantick but is nevertheless very true Being arrived the first Day towards the Evening at an Inn which was the only one in a vast Forest I was going instantly to Bed without my Supper the House not affording any Thing No sooner was I gone into my Chamber than I heard a great Noise at the Door of the House and fancied I heard somebody speak  French  I went out immediately and having asked whether I had not heard  French  spoken I was answered in the Affirmative I then addressed my self to these Strangers saying Come in Gentlemen this indeed is a very bad Inn you will find nothing to eat here but you will meet with a Person who will be very glad of your Company I saw at the same Time a Man of a graceful Aspect entring but as he had a large Cap on I could not well distinguish his Face When we paid each other our mutual Compliments of Civility I thought I heard a Voice well known to me and mine had the same Effect on him After  having view'd each other attentively we both recollected our selves and embraced one another not without being struck with Surprize at meeting in this Place This Accident seemed to give him some Disquiet for he had strong Reasons not to discover himself to any Body He begged I would entirely forget his Name after which we discoursed together and had many Subjects to entertain each other upon  I asked him several Questions very pressingly and he satisfied my Curiosity in many Points He happened fortunately for me to have some good Provisions which furnished us a comfortable Supper and then we went to Rest As he came from the same Country which I had just before left and intended to go the same Way which I took we set out together the next Morning and put up at the same Inn at Night When I however perceived that he could not recover from his first Uneasiness and found besides I was a Burden to him I resolved to wish him a good Journey and parted with him the more willingly as my Horses being not so good as his could hardly keep Pace with him  You expect perhaps some farther Account of this Adventure but I am tied down to Silence and will perform the Promise I made of inviolable Secrecy which if I should not I must unavoidably inform you of certain Matters which are still of too great Importance An Adventure very different from this will be better worth your Notice by which you may see what a Man must expect who has once begun to be unfortunate  The tenth Day a general Thaw ensued and the Roads were extreamly bad Having met with Places that appeared very dangerous I sent my Postilion to sound them and he found that they could not be passed with Safety We went a great  way about in Search of another Passage My Guide who thought he had found a good one led me into a kind of Pit the only one perhaps in the whole Country in which we were almost buried with our Horses and Carriage It was not without great Difficulty we got out and it was a singular good Fortune that we did not lose our Lives by this Accident To suffer Shipwreck by Sea to be cast away in a Lake or in a River are Things common Accidents of that Kind happen daily But to meet with that Misfortune by Land in the midst of arable Ground this can never happen to any one but him who  Minxit in patrios cineres  In this Condition I was obliged to travel four or five HoursJourney before we came to an Inn That we came to was tolerably good and I was obliged to stay there three Days to cleanse my self My Goods were all entirely spoiled and especially my Writings which I regretted more than all the rest I arrived however the th at  Memmel  where I was obliged to take a Sled to go to  Konigsburg  There could not possibly be a worse Way than this proved The Ice was in many Places cracked and sometimes so covered with Water that it was not possible to get forwards I never in my Life had so painful and fatiguing a Journey and I cannot better compare the Danger I was in than to that of being obliged to stand one's Ground against a Battery of wellplaced Cannon Nevertheless the same Supreme Being who for some Time had only laid a heavy Burden upon me with one Hand to relieve me with the other conducted me safe to  Konigsburg  the last Day of the Year  When I came into the City I found I was a Spectacle to every Body for I pretty much resembled either the Prodigal Son or some Fugitive Slave I was carried before General  Cat  who  doubtless perceived the Confusion I was in to appear before him in that Equipage and therefore was so good to dispatch me immediately I took my Lodging in the first Inn I came at and at my Entrance into it offered up my Prayers to Heaven to vouchsafe me some Rest from my Labour  Contenti nostris Di precor esto malis  Being arrived at  Konigsburg  I thought it was now out of the Power of the  Muscovites  to give me any new Uneasiness But I found my self mistaken and met with a fresh Instance of their Malice and Baseness The Case was this I have already told you that at my Departure from  Petersburg  I required several Passes which were refused me and that they only gave me one in the  Muscovite  Tongue At  Riga  they gave me another in  German  of which I understood as little as of the former When I came before General  Cat  at  Petersburg  I shewed him these Passes and notwithstanding the powerful Reasons which might have induced him to make me pass a strict Examination he took no Notice of the Passes but gave me Leave to go and repose my self  The next Morning I gave them to my Landlord who had Orders to demand them from me and to examine them What he did with them I know not but when he returned them he asked me if I knew their Contents upon which telling him I was wholly ignorant thereof he promised to get them translated for me He soon returned with the Translations but how great was my Surprize when casting an Eye upon them I found that the  Muscovites  not contented with having forbid me by the Mouth of their Secretary ever to setFoot into their Dominions again had even inserted the same Compliment in their Passes Tho' a long Captivity  and other ill Usage I had already met with in  Muscovy  had accustomed me to bear every Thing patiently it was impossible for me to put up quietly with this I had Reason to fear that General  Cat  after having seen the Contents of these Passes might take me for a Person who had been guilty of some enormous Crime in  Muscovy  and had been shamefully banished for it This lay the heavier upon me as I was very much tired and withal in Want of Money and therefore under a Necessity of making some Stay at  Konigsburg  All my Thoughts were taken up with this preposterous Event which struck at my Reputation From this Moment I forgot all the other Evils I had suffered the Dangers I had been exposed to the Captivity I had undergone the Indignities which had been offered me nay the very Prison it self which had brought me to the Brink of the Grave all this I say was as nothing to me in Comparison with the melancholly State I was now reduced to I want Terms to express the Vileness of this Action  With this extraordinary  Catastrophe  I shall finish the Narrative of my Adventures The Compliance which is due to the great Intimacy and Friendship that is between us has engaged me in it But for a fuller Account of them I must reserve it till I have the Happiness of embracing you I am now Dear Sir just upon my Departure to be with you since you invite and so earnestly press me to it I shall once more give my self up to the Mercy of an Element which seems to threaten me with new Misfortunes Heaven sure is provoked against me and I fear that  Fata mihi totum me sint agitanda per orbem  FINIS
