 M  hamet the Turkish Spy  A CONTINƲATION OF LETTERS Written by a  Turkish Spy  AT PARIS Giving an impartial Account to the Divan at  Constantinople  of the most Remarkable Transactions of  Europe  and discovering several Intrigues and Secrets of the Christian Courts especially of that of  France  continued from the Year to the Year  Written originally in  Arabick  Translated into  Italian  and from thence into  English  LONDON Printed for  W Taylor  at the Sign of the  Ship  in  PaterNosterRow    THE PREFACE  _IT was not so much the Success of the former Volumes of these Letters that has promoted their Continuance but the Excellence of the Subject the Beauty of the Manner and the delightful Variety they present us with convinc'd me that it was impossible but they should please  If it were possible to give the Reader in the Translation the same Ideas he would conceive were he to read the Original could I translate or indeed could our Language express the Story with the same Vivacity the fame Spirit and the same Energy of Words as the old exquisitely qualified  Arabian  delivered it how much superior would it be to what it now appears with what Pleasure with what Raptures and Extafies must it be received  But 'tis not to be done I may translate the Words and I have some Hopes the Reader will suggest that I have done my Duty but to render the sublime Flights of the incomparable  Mohmut  his bright Ideas his surprizing Turns of Wit and Flights of Fancy I say to render these exactly in our Language is as difficult as 'tis for a Painter to represent the Passions or a Carver to make his Figures speak  It is observ'd by the Curious that the most difficult thing in the Limners Art is to represent a Person singing suppose it be the Picture of a young Lady the utmost he can do is to shew her Countenance bright the Company listening and appearing pleased but alas towards the Sound towards the Charm of her Voice and the Beauty of her Judgment he can do no more than paint her with her Mouth open which is the meanest Posture she can with Decency be shewn in and unless the other Passions discover it she may as well be supposed to be swearing scolding sick or any thing else as well at singing  We can no more represent the Eloquence the Spirit the sprightly Turns and the happy Genius of our accomplish'd inimitable  Arabian  by the most laboured and studied Translation into  English  than a Limner can paint the Voice and give the Musick of the Song in the Gestures of the Lady  But when I have acknowledg'd this the Reader I hope will not find that all the Care has been taken to make old  Mahmut  speak  English  I say all the Care that consists with one very sollicitous to please and oblige as well as to divert and instruct  Above all I have followed that sure Rule in our Tongue and which were it observed  would I believe be acknowledged to be the best Rule in all Tongues  viz  to make the Language plain artless and honest suitable to the Story and in a Stile easie and free with as few exotick Phrases and obsolete Words as possible that the meanest Reader may meet with no Difficulty in the Reading and may have no Obstruction to his searching the History of things by their being obscurely represented  It was objected I know to the former Volumes of this Work that the  Turk  was brought in too much debasing the Christian Religion extolling  Mahomet  and speaking disrespectfully of Jesus Christ calling him the  Nazaren  and the Son of  Mary  and it is certain the Continuation must fall into the same Method but either  Mahmut  must be a  Turk  or no  Turk  either he must speak his own Language or other Peoples Language and how must we represent Words spoken by him in the first Person of invincible  Mahmut  the  Arabian  if we must not give his own Language and how can this Work be a Translation if we must not translate the very Stile of the Original  Let those who think they have Cause for any Observations of this Nature observe that all Care possible is taken to represent such Passages in Terms that may give no Offence and with this Caution to the Reader that when he reads those Parts he is desired to take them as the Words of the  Arabian  not the Words of the Translator and if any thing may be said to be left out of the Original it can only be such Places where  Mahmut  may  have taken more Liberties than might be proper for the Repetition of Christian Readers  On the other Hand it will be observed in Defence of the Translation and of the good Intention of the Translator that as honest  Mahmut  upon many Occasions speaks very honourably and even reverently of our Saviour and particularly of the perfect Laws and Rules of Faith and Doctrine and speaks with Detestation of the Apostacy of his Followers and of the unworthy Behaviour of those who profess to be his Disciples and Worshippers so the Translator has not fail'd to take all Occasions to do Justice to the Original in all those Cases in particular  It is true the Translator has some Letters on these Subjects which he has not thought fit to make publick because of the nice Palates of a censorious Age who will take all Advantages to insult the Publication of such a Stile while yet they concern not themselves to hear the Deity of our blessed Lord insulted every Day in publick by those who call themselves Believers and even the Being of a God denied by a much worse Infidelity than that of a  Mahometan  It is an Observation not unworthy the Remark of our  Arabian  and may be very useful to those that read him  viz  that the practical Atheism so rife in the World in this Age is a Sin engrossed among Christians that the  Mahometans  know nothing of it and that it is not heard of among the Mussulmans that any Man should arrive to that Degree of Hardness  in Crime as to deny the Being of a God whose Glory the Light of Nature so evidently reveals  These Letters are not only a Record of History through the Years they refer to and that not only respecting  France  but all the Parts of the Christian World but they are fruitful of improving Observations on many Subjects as well Religious as Moral  It is true our  Arabian  grows ancient and we find him casting his Thoughts upon the Pleasures of their  Mahometan  Futurity but as Christians should when they grow nearer a future State have their Minds ting'd with the Glories they expect so we find his Understanding so far from a Decay by his Years that he speaks of religious things with so much the more Relish and Taste as if he realliz'd on Earth the Heaven he expected  He must have very few Thoughts about him who cannot see that the older our Author grows the more profitable and instructing his Writings will be and yet we do not find his Fancy so confin'd but that he ranges through all the Regions of Science speaks of the Politicks of State and Progress of Armies with as true Deductions and as clear a Judgment as ever  If our Correspondent at  Vienna  to whom  Mahmut  committed his Papers and to whom they were faithfully delivered by his Successor does not deceive us we may expect a yet greater Variety towards the Conclusion of his Residence than has yet seen the Light and  perhaps some Remains of things omitted in the Time of former Publication which as they come to Hand shall be communicated with the greatest Exactness whether they may exactly correspond with the Chronology of former Publications or no and tho' there may seem a little Confusion in such a Retrospect yet I doubt not the Beauty of the Subject shall make full Amends for any Disorder in the Dates  This has been the Reason why even in this Volume some Letters especially of speculative Subjects may come a little out of the Order of Time which I think is a thing of so trifling a Nature compar'd to the Advantage of their Publication that it needs not the least Apology for it  A TABLE OF THE LETTERS and  Matters  contain'd in this Volume  VOL I  BOOK I

 and commandest me to write also to thy self approving as thou sayest my way of Informing my Friends of the State of Things in this Country It solaces my Soul in the midst of my languishing Distemper of which I inform'd the  Chaimacam  my late Friend and in which I had felt so much pain I say it solaces my Soul to find my performances approved by him to whom I owe my Commission and the being remembred after having been forty and eight Years as one buried alive among Infidels and Strangers  But in particular it gives Youth to my Spirits and fires my Soul with an inconceivable Joy that thou givest me the promise of sending me a Successor in this nice Employment thereby giving me hopes of being recalled that I may once more see my native Country in which lie the Bones of my Father and Brethren and where I shall be able to die as my Soul desires even at the Gates of the thrice happy and blessed  Mecca  where lie the Remains of our most holy Prophet ever miraculous and performing deeds of astonishment to the Eyes of all those who are allow'd to look three foot above the Ground on which they stand  I conjure thee happy  Saban  now thou art Exalted to the High Post of a publick Minister I say I conjure thee by the hoary Beard of thy Father and Grandfather by the Faith of a  Mussulman  and true Believer by the Fire that descended and drank up the River  Arath  that our Prophet might go over by the Moon and thirteen Stars which gave him light thro' the Desart of  Lybia  by the Blood of ten thousand  Jews  and Infidel Christians Sacrificed at his Interment and by the Tomb of  Mahomet  and all the  Emirs  and Pilgrims there attending with incessant Devotion that thou forget not thy banished  Mahmut  grown old in the Service of the Illustrious King of Emperors and Lord of Nations and wearing past the capacity of performing the Offices requir'd of me forget me not I say righteous  Musa  but procure my Release that  I may not die among Dogs and be blended in Earth with Infidels and Enemies of  Mahomet  It is time sage Counsellor of the Wise it is time and justice requires that a faithful Servant continued Years in the Exile of a Secret Employ and having with the utmost fidelity discharg'd my self even to the satisfaction or confusion of those who envied me this Trust should at last have liberty to come home and die in the Arms of my Friends and be deposited in the Dust with the Faithful  The Troubles of Life can have no greate Reward than to end in peace it is the great Victory over the vicissitudes of this World the great Triumph that Wise and Good Men hope for to lie down in the Grave and be gather'd to the invi sible Mansions in a State of Tranquillity and at the Door of the blessed Wherefore do millions travel in Pilgrimage to  Mecca  and desire to have the Felicity to die there but because they believe they shall from thence be immediately transported into Paradise in the view of our great and sublime  Mahomet  And what need have I of that difficulty who am a Native of  Arabia  justly styl'd the happy doubly so  viz  by the Clime and by the sacred Treasure reposed there I say who am a Native of  Arabia  and who in returning to my own Country shall be happily scituated even in sight of the miraculous Monument of our Prophet where I desire to end my Days in a manner suitable to one whose Life has been devoted to the Interest and Honour of my Country  Take it then into thy Power exalted  Musa  and think thy self fortunate that thou art able to make one Happy Man and to have one ancient Friend always blessing thy Charity and sending up incessant Prayers for thy Health and be not doubtful of finding a Successor equally quallified for this Employment however nice and if thou wilt have the Goodness to send the Person hither to me I will continue with him till I have shewn him the way of Conversing with Mankind in this Place so as to make this Jealous Nation easie in his Society open to his Enquiries and not suspicious of his Employment  Do this Generous  Saban  with a Friendship suitable to that thou bearest for me in former Years when thou and I were Equals and Camrades in the Oda's of the  Tekeh  at  Trapezond  and let not Fate which has exalted thee above thy Friend cause thee to forget that as thou art already full of Years as I also am so it is not many Days but we shall be levell'd in the Dust and be equal again till we meet in the Garden and rejoyce in the Royal Palace of  Eden  where not the highest in Human Glory but the most perfect in Vertue shall be receiv'd with the greatest Splendor into the Regions of Eternal Delight  Paris  th of the st Moon in the Year  LETTER II To  Hassan Ebio Mirza Zebir  Great Muffty or HighPriest of  Mahomet  ILLUSTRIOUS Reverend Resplendent Image of the blessed Lawgiver I kiss the dust of thy sacred Feet in reverence of that pure and unspotted Holiness that shines in thy Person and which is truly Hereditary to the Chair of thy Office I cannot sit here surrounded with the Pageantry of Devotion and see the ridiculous  mimicking  of these Infidels in what they call Religion without some Heavenly Meditations which I offer at thy Feet in Honour of the more pure Institutions of our Great Prophet  These Christians here finding the harsh and uncouth Model of their Religion consisting much in Celibacies restraint of Liberty Monastick Severities  c  which they had drawn their People into the practice of instead of Religion would not go down with the People or relish well with those who they knew even from the barrenness of the Principle they went upon could have no true tast of it  as Religious  I say these Christians in order to make amends for their other Fopperies are fain to bring as much Mirth as they can into their Worship that the common People may have something in Religion to tickle and please  them that so if they cannot hold them by the sublime they may by the sensitive part of their Worship as the Enthusiasms of certain Hereticks which I remember in  Arabia  which were animated by Fumes and smoak of Herbs of an intoxicating quality used on purpose by their Dervices to keep up the delusions of their Principles  There is no talking with these Men upon these Points for should I but ask one of them to be ingenuous and confess on what occasion they introduced so many antick Gestures such variety of Pictures such Adorations and above all such variety of Musical Instruments into their Mosques or Churches and ask whether it was not by the mechanism of those  addenda  to possess the Minds and move the Passions and Affections of their Proselytes they would presently start at me and cry our  I was a Heretick  and if I liv'd in some other parts of the Country I should be certainly sent to the Inquisition  This is a Devilish Ecclesiastick Judicature  where they pass Sentence upon those who they think are in the least apt to prye too much into the sacred Impostures of their Religion  Certainly venerable Patriarch of the pure and faithful  Musselmans  these  Nazareens  are the most detestable of all pretenders to Religion in the World for at the same time that they call themselves the Disciples of their Prophet  Jesus  they have brought into their forms of Worship so many Innovations and Traditional Corruptions which himself never directed that their Religion has now very little of the first Institution in it  It is without question true that this  Jesus  who they are denominated from was a very Holy Person indued with Heavenly Wisdom that he wrought innumerable Miracles and left them pure Doctrines in Writings taken from his Mouth and dictated to his Followers and tho' we do not allow him to be any ways like to our most divine  Mahomet  yet the Alchoran of this their Prophet  Jesus  contains innumerable and excellent Precepts which his Disciples for some Ages follow'd with great exactness and suffer'd inexpressible Torments from the  Roman  Emperors and Government in the defence of But their Successors degenerating from the purity and the rectitude of Principle which their said Ancestors retain'd have corrupted their Religion to that degree that it is now one of the greatest pieces of confusion and Buffoonry on Earth  It would have fill'd thee with Indignation Venerable and Holy  Mirza  hadst thou been here the other day when these  Nazareens  were paying their publick Thanks to their Prophet  Jesus  who thou knowest they pretend to say is even equal with God I went once into one of their Idolatrous Temples or Mosques to see the Pageantry of their Worship which Curiosity led me to observe very particularly because it was upon an occasion of Rejoycing or Thanksgiving as they call it for taking of  Philipsburg  a City of the Emperor on the  Rhine  when I was not only astonished at the ridiculous folly of such a polite Nation as this is but even provok'd with a holy rage and I curs'd them by  Mahomet  three times reserving  serving it farther to thee to confirm the  Anathema  's which they have reason to expect and fall under  Verily it is scarce to be imagin'd how they can pretend if they did believe the ineffable Glory of the Creator of Heaven and Earth and that their Sacrifices were offered to him that he would be Captivated by the noise of Fiddles and Bagpipes the shooting of Great Ordnance the beating of KettleDrums and the Clamour of Trumpets But thus it was for their great Rhapsody of Praise which they call  Te Deum  is thus managed Behold just before they began their Song in the Mosque pieces of Canon were fir'd without as if they intended to awaken their Prophet with the noise Immediately after this and just before the Door of the great Mosque I was surpriz'd with the confusion of KettleDrums five sets of Trumpets plac'd at proper Distances and Drummers of the King's Guards of Foot which for a quarter of an hour complimented their God with Tabor and Pipe  As soon as this was over an Anthem so they call their Idolatrous Song which they Sing on these Occasions began within the Mosque sung by the Voices of Eunuchs Boys and Women taught for those wicked Purposes Their Voices were indeed excellent and had they been employ'd on Occasions of Mirth and Delight not for the debauching the Mind with corrupt Ideas in Religion the Harmony of them was admirably fine▪ These Singers are placed in Stalls for that purpose in several gradations as their Voices rise then followed  the  Te Deum  which was sung with the like Voices but mixt with innumerable sorts of Instruments of Musick such as Fiddles BaseViols Hautboys Fifes Cymballs Timbrels Harps Organs  c  and continu'd about half an hour and then went off as it all begun with Drums Trumpets KettleDrums and pieces of Canon from without  Tell me sage Prophet who guides the Consciences of the faithful in paying their pure and unmix'd Devotions to one undivided Eternal Being the Great  ALLA  and directs them with simple and humble Devotion to send up Prayers five times a Day to his ineffable Throne Tell me what coherence can this have with the sacred thing called Religion or with the nature of Adoration and giving praise which ought to be perform'd by humble Creatures to the Creator of Heaven and Earth to whom they should rather appear as Penitent Offenders with Mortifications and Sacrifices of sorrowful Hearts trembling even in their Thanksgiving than with a noise of Musick and Voices of Triumph as if they were Inviting their great Prophet to a Festival or Masquerade  I think often when I reflect on these Infidels that they must certainly have very gross Conceptions of God and may well be said to think of him after the manner of Men that is that he acts after the manner of Men it is not possible that they can reverence his Divine Being in that awful and humble manner as the true Believers who washing their Bodies from outward defilement conceive of God  with perfect Ideas covering their Eyes and retreating with Heavenly Solitude into the inmost Soul to contemplate the Being who is the Sum and Substance of inconceivable Glory  The most which I meet with of Defence for the Barbarism of this Custom is drawn by their cunning Dervices from the practice of the  Jews  which they say was given them by their ancient Lawgiver  Moses  But this were it just in it self is most absurd in these  Nazareens  because as they themselves pretend to be Followers of their Prophet  Jesus  who they say is the Messiah which  Moses  himself foretold them was to come and to put an end to all his Institutions also they do declare that this  Jesus  has fulfilled all  Moses  's Law and abolish'd all those things which belong'd to that Ceremonious Worship setting up  a more sure word of Prophesie  or Directions for Worship and also that in all this their said Prophet's Directions which he left behind him there is not the least Precept Example or Direction for such monstrous things as Drums Trumpets  c  in Religious Worship But that on the contrary he scourged all Pageantry which they had set up out of their Great Mosque or Temple which was at  Jerusalem  declaring that from that time the Mosques where God would be Worshipped should be Houses of Prayer only  I say notwithstanding all this these designing Dervices and their Pontifical Muffti at  Rome  have introduc'd these incoherent Innovations and set their People on work to mock the Immoral God of Nature in such a manner as I have given thee an account of  With how much purer Devotion do the faithful Mussulmen prostrate their Souls in the humblest manner saying Prayers of a sublime nature to that one great  ALLA  the God of the Gods of all Nations where the religious Servants of our Holy Prophers perform the Mysteries of Religion by thy sublime Directions Inspir'd with these I am present by the power of Imagination every day and please my Soul in this my state of absence with fancying that I see thy venerable Person performing Divine Offices among the Faithful who prostrate at thy Feet reverence with thee God and his great Prophet  Mahomet  Wonder not Heavenly Saint if I am sometimes transported with these Ideas to a degree that may seem Enthusiastick Be assur'd my Dejections bear a proportion after the fire of my Imagination is abated and especially when I find my self embarras'd with Infidels and doom'd here to Business and Repentance  I kiss thy Feet with the most profound Veneration of an Humble Slave  Paris  the th of the th Moon in the Year of the  Nazareens    LETTER III To  Cicala Bassa Beglerbeg  of  Romania  I Direct these Letters to thee by the Command of the late  Hali Bassa Chaimacam  now in Paradise whose Blessing be upon us  As thou art by thy Title Lord of Lords and by thy Office the first and greatest  Beglerbeg  of the whole Mussulman Empire the Right Hand of the Invincible  Achmet  our mighty Emperor and art entrusted by his Command with the most eminent Affairs of his Government during the absence of the Vizier  Azem  now on his prosperous Expedition to the East  I know that thy Martial Genius as well as thy great Office presiding over all the  Ottoman  Dominions in  Europe  enclines thee to receive willingly an Account of the great Transactions in the  Nazareen  World so I may call this Part wherein I Sojourn for the good of thy great Master and the Service of the whole  Ottoman  Power  Thou art not ignorant Wise and Valiant  Cicala  of the great Overthrow of the mighty Emperor of the Islands call'd here slightly the King of  England  for know this haughty Court gives slight and mean Titles to all their Neighbouring Princes for this King of  England  is indeed a most powerful Prince and his Empire tho' not large in extent yet in Power and Strength is exceeding great principally founded  in the prodigious Wealth and the immense Riches of his Country and People He also possesses besides the great Islands of  Britain  and  Ireland  I say he possesses infinite Tracts of Land Islands and Colonies in the remotest parts of the World  Hali Bassa  the late happy  Chaimacam  of  Constantinople  thy Friend and mine Commanded me to write to him the History of the Fall of the King of that Country call'd  England  which I did at large with the Character of his Person for we now see him here taking Sanctuary in the Court of the King of  France  who is his great Friend and Protector But in Answer to this our Friend  Haly  sent me his Commands to inform him how it came to pass that the King of  France  or of the  Franks  in whose Country I reside who thou knowest is taken with us for the greatest King among the Nations of the  Messiah  should at the same time that he profess'd so sincere Friendship for the  English  King suffer that so mean and so weak a Person as the Prince of  Orange  and who had no assistance but that of the  Elutch  to Support him should Invade and attack his Friend and Allie the King of  England  when he knew at the same time that the Subjects of the said  English  King were Malecontents and enclin'd to Revolt and my Answer to these things he has wisely commanded me to send to thee knowing it seems or believing by Inspiration that the predestinated time of his Translation unto Bliss was approaching  Know then Illustrious and Valiant Leader of the faithful Host that true it is that the present King of  France  is the greatest of all the Kings of the Christian Nations abounding in Wealth and immense Treasures surrounded with Numerous and Victorious Armies and it is no more to be questioned but that he is and also then was a sincere Friend to the  English  King and would very willingly have prevented the Mischief which has since befallen him nay had he not been his Friend yet Prudence and Policy of State required that he would by no means have suffer'd the said  English  King to have been so Invaded seeing he knew perfectly well that the Prince of  Orange  was not only a Warlike Prince in himself but was also a profess'd Enemy to the Greatness and Ambition of  France  It is also true that this King of  France  is now and was at that time in the very Meridian of his Glory cloath'd with innumerable Triumphs and Trophies of Victory which are the Envy and Grief of all the Nations about him and that all those Nations would rejoyce to see the said  Prince of Orange  strengthned by the addition of the English Power that they might joyn in Confederacy with him to Bridle the the Exorbitance of the  French  Greatness which begins to be terrible to  Europe  Yet most true it is that nothing but the infatuation and unaccountable indolence of this great Monarch has next to the irresistable Decrees of Heaven brought this great Affair to pass and this doubtless was the Reason why the illustrious  Chaimacam  enjoyn'd me with  such earnestness to acquaint him with these things since to him as I doubt not it will to thee  who art as he was well acquainted with the state of things in these parts of the World  It seem'd very strange that the King of  France  should stand still and look on in a matter which so nearly concern'd his Friend and Allie and in effect himself and not prevent a mischief big with such dangerous Events  I must then acquaint thee that one false step in the King of  France  has been the Occasion of all this Disaster to his Friend the King of  England  and without which it had been impossible for the Prince of  Orange  to have brought any of his Designs to pass  viz  At the very juncture of the Preparations of the  Dutch  the  French  King as if he was Confederate with them resolving to push at the Emperor of  Germany  sends the Dauphine with a  French  Army of Men quite out of the way to the upper  Rhine  and causes him to sit down before  Phillipsburg  whereas had he caused Men to have advanc'd to the  Maes  and but hover'd over the  Dutch  Frontiers tho' without any attempt the  Dutch  could never have parted with their Troops to make the attempt in  England  These Measures they are now satisfied here were wrong and the most formidable Enemy they have is by this very step strengthned with the addition of those Kingdoms which alone are able to look the  French  Armies in the Face But the Opinion those People have of the invincible Power of their King is such that they value not the whole World which Confidence may  however be Fatal to them in the End Indeed his Armies are compos'd of excellent Troops but then it is to be consider'd that they are not all composed of his own Subjects nay those which are of his own Subjects are not esteem'd his best Troops but his Armies are composed of  Germans Swiss Irish Scots  and some  English  and whenever a strong Confederacy shall so attack him as that he shall not be able to make up the Loss of these with Men of the same Nations they will find the  French  Infantry inferior to any of the Neighbouring Nations  But this must be granted that the Officers of the  French  Troops are good and it is to their Conduct that the Glory of their Monarch is owing There is a Saying which is made use of when they talk of the  French  and  English  Nations by way of comparison  viz  that of the  French If the Soldiers will but follow the Officers will always lead  andthat of the  English If the Officers will but lead the Soldiers will always follow  so that by the way an Army of  English  Soldiers led by  French  Officers would be invincible  How glorious are the Troops of thy Illustrious Emperor in whose Cause both Soldiers and Officers equally emulous of Glory and of serving well the most invincible Monarch of the Universe are equally ready both to lead and to follow and to fix the glorious Crescent the Ensigns of our Great  Mahomet  upon the vanquish'd Frontiers of the  Sultan  's Enemies may thy ways be prosperous and thy Arms  Victorious in the Work of our mighty Master till the Crescent triumph over the Cross and the whole World becomes Tributary to thy Lord and Emperor  Paris  th of the st Moon  LETTER IV To the most Heavenly Pattern of Wisdom and Purity  Hassan Mirza Zebir  Prince of the Muftys  IF I were to salute thee Venerable Majestick Guide of Truth and Lover of the Faithful in the Language of these  Nazareens  when they address themselves to the great  Mufti  of their Religion I should give thee and more justly by far the Title of  Soveraign Pontiff  with the Addition of  your Holiness  and acknowledge an infallibillty in judging and determining all religious Controversies to be inherent to thy Office  How effectually do all these Particulars shine in thy Person and Character who art really holy and sublimely wise Titles which they presumptuously ascribe oftentimes to the Wickedest of Men for thou mayst know immortal  Zebir  that these  Soveraign Pontiff  's or  Mufty  's here who they address by the Stile of  his Holiness  as above are sometimes  the vilest Creatures in the Universe  nay they often are most wretchedly scandalous drunken perjur'd lewd and  in a Word turbulent bloody and superlatively wicked till the People themselves are ashamed of them and have been oblig'd to depose them either by the Help of the  German  Emperor or the  French  it would be too long to enter into the History of them  This shall be the Glory of our holy Prophet and shall eternize his Name  viz  that the great Prince of the Priests of  Mahomet  is a Pattern of just Men inimitable for all the Endowments of the Mind has a Soul equal to the highest Function upon Earth I mean the Heavenly Office of expounding infallibly the sublime Truths of our holy Alcoran and interpreting without Appeal all the Doctrines of  Mahomet  But to give thee a true Idea of the pretended infallible Guide of these deluded  Nazareens  the Story I am going to tell thee is recorded here even by themselves of one of their Popes being the same whose scandalous Conduct in the Sale of his imaginary forg'd Pardons and Benedictions to the People was the first Occasion of the Defection which  Luther  made among them that famous Dervice who as I formerly wrote thee was the Father of the Separation or Faction among the  Nazareens  This Pope or great Mufty gave a living Testimony to what we the true Believers hold concerning the whole System of their Religion  viz  that it is a Fiction of the Dervices contriv'd to delude the People and this horrid Creature was it seems not able to contain the Truth tho' it was so needful on his Side to be concealed the Occasion it seems was that seeing an immense and unexpected Sum of Money returned into his Treasury at  Rome  from his Missionary Dervices who he had sent Abroad to make Sale of Indulgences Relicks and other Frippery of the  Vatican  He was so surprized with the unlook'd for Heap of Gold that he cries out as in a Rapture  Heu quantum profuit hac fabula Christi  What prodigious Gain says he do we make of this Fable of Christ  Immortal  Mirza  if the Soveraign Pontiff the supreme Mufty of the  Nazareens  has declar'd the whole System of the Religion of their great Prophet to be but a religious Cheat a holy Fable what need we any further Testimony What greater Witness can the true Believers desire to confirm them in the Heavenly Way than the open Confession of the great  Papa  or Father of the Christians who has acknowledg'd that they are all Deceivers and that the Story of their great Prophet  Jesus  is but a Fable  Besides do they not own that this their great High Priest is infallible in all he says or does It is not many Moons ago since at their Annual Tribunal of the holy Inquisition so they call the most Hellish Constitution on Earth where they held what they call an  auto de fe  that is to say a general  Audit of the Faith  to give Judgment on those they call Hereticks they burnt alive without Mercy two Men for saying their great Mufty was not infallible  This we justly take hold of against them and prove then from the Mouth of their infallible Oracle that all the Scheme of their Religion is but a Fable a Cheat a Piece of Dervice Craft to get Money and in a Word illustrious  Mirza  that their supreme Mufty or high Priest is but a religious  Zavin  or  PickPocket  Heaven doubtless has infatuated these Infidels and given them up to dote on the grossest Absurdities other wise they could never swallow such open and notorious Impositions Conversing once with a Sect of the  Nazarenes  here whom they call  Hugonots  one of them 'told me their great Prophet  Jesus  did foretel that in the last Days of the World his Disciples should do thus  viz That they should be given up to strong Delusions and to believe Lies  That he was a Prophet of God that thou knowest we do believe though we believe him to be inferior to our most holy Prophet  Mahomet  But assuredly if he prophesied that his Followers should in the latter Days believe Lies and be given up to strong Delusions there is no Question but in that he has been a true Prophet  These  Hugonots  are by far an honester and wiser Sect of the  Nazareens  than those who are called  Catholicks  and therefore have been persecuted and even extirpated out of the Kingdom of  France  and they do not fail to expose daily when they are in Companies and Societies where they can do it freely the Cheats the Impositions and the Absurdities of the  Catholicks  There are divers Sects of these People who have broken off from the great Mufty and they are denominated either from the Countries where they live or the Patrons from whom they derive their Opinions as  Lutherans  from  Luther Calvinists  from  Calvin  and the like and though I look upon these to be as above the better Sort by far as to their Morality and as to their Principles yet they differ again one from another and separate even in  Charity and Affection as much as the  Ottomans  and  Persians  do about the Successors to our Great Prophet  Mahomet  Nay they have likewise proceeded to Persecution and even to Blood  If Love and Unity be the Band of Religion and the Pledge of a Title to Paradise questionless the Mussulmen enjoy the best Tokens of the Felicity which we look for in the Garden of God for no such Divisions are seen among them as reign in these Parts of the World where every Man sets up a Religion of his own and walks in the light of his own Vision thinking it his Duty to damn all the rest of Mankind to the Infernal Pit who are not of his Opinion and if I am not wrong there is a Man among these Christians who has given a Scheme or Plan which he calls  Heresyography  in which he gives an Account of the Dissentions of the several Sorts of Christians and I think he reckons up about threescore and fourteen Sects who all call themselves the Followers of their great Prophet So uncertain is the Light by which these Men are directed so imperfect the Rules and Doctrines which their great Prophet left them as the fundamental Law of their Obedience or rather so ill do they observe his Rules and obey his Dictates for we know that their Messiah left them excellent Rules as the Principles of Life to guide to the Celestial Paradise but so degenerated are these his Followers that albeit they are called by his Name yet very little of his first Institutes are found in the model of their Religion Nay they are daily fighting and shedding Blood  about the single Question of what it was their Prophet did command and what he did not and who shall or shall not interpret the Mind and Will of their Prophet  Blessed be the Dust of thy sacred Feet thou Lamp of Truth and Light of Believers whose Oracle the Faithful believe with Fear In thy most pure Explanations of our holy Law are no doubtful Reserves among thy obedient Hearers no Schisms or Separations but all listen with Attention to the Law of thy Lips speaking Words of Heavenly Solace and guiding to the Mystical Fields which surround the Gates of Paradise Sublime  Mirza  bless thy obedient faithful devout  Mahmut  and let Deceivers perish  Paris  th of the th Month in the year  LETTER V To  Hassan Amiel Zucharava  the Agae of the  Janisaries  THOU wouldest be in thy Element Great Captain of the innumerable Seminary of the Valiant Soldiers of the  East  thou wouldest I say be in thy Element if thou wert here just now where nothing is to be heard but the Noise of War and the daily Return of Couriers from the Armies in the Field bringing Accounts of Victories taking strong Cities and possessing new Conquests one in the Neck of another in such a Manner that the King of  France  who seems to be wondrous devout and is constant in causing Thanks to be given in the Mosques and Temples of their Prophet  Jesus  for every Advantage he gains is obliged now to put three or four Conquests into one Thanksgiving and discharge his Acknowledgments by wholesale which makes some People jest with the King and tell him that he does by his God as he does by the People make them take his Coin at what Price he pleases to put upon it  The Truth is these  Nazareens  make no Scruple to jest with the most sacred Things in their pretended Worship and banter one another about it which is to me a certain Sign that whatever seeming Formalities they may have in their Religion they believe little of the Thing themselves but rather have the same Opinion of it that we have  viz  that it is all a holy Cheat contrived to support the Priests who at first invented it and made Use of only to get Money  But to return to the Things which I say are in thy Element here thou mightest see one King preparing as I may very well say to go to War with all the Kings of the Earth in a Word the King of  France  is already engaged in a War with the ancient Enemy of the Mussulmen the Emperor of  Germany  and has made divers considerable Conquests on the Frontiers of his Dominions as I shall tell thee presently he has besides this attacked the Dominions of the King of  Spain  which lie on this Side and are called the  Low Countries  This will unavoidably end in a War with that King who is Lord indeed of great Dominions but has but a weak proud and pusillanimous People  Besides all this it is evident that he will bring a War upon himself from  England  and  Holland  in Conjunction as he espouses the Interest of the King of  England  who is fled to him for Assistance against the Invasion of the Prince of  Orange  of which thou hast heard some Time ago  This Prince of  Orange  is a Person of such Interest and Alliances among the  Northern  Princes of  Germany  that it is very probable when  France  breaks and declares War on that Side there will be engaged against him and in behalf of the Prince of  Orange  all the Princes of the House of  Lunenburgh  of  Saxony  and of  Brandenburgh  and perhaps also the Kings of  Denmark  and  Sweden  Thou wilt be earnest after this to enquire what this King of  France  is as well in Person as in Power know then that except the allpowerful Port the Center of Glory surrounded with innumerable Millions of Valiant Soldiers Lord of the inexhaustible Nurseries of the  Spahis Janizaries  and  Timariots  throughout  Asia Egypt  and  Aethiopia  I say except or next to this the King of  France  is the most powerful of all Princes He is in Person a most glorious Prince wise politick enterprising boundless in Ambition of Glory and Empire undaunted in his Attempts of the greatest Kind and never disappointed or to seek in his Measures  He is surrounded with three hundred thousand Veteran Soldiers led by the most experienced Officers in these Parts of the World he is absolute Master of his Councils and perfectly well serv'd in all his Commands to make the least Slip or Mistake in his Service is to lose the Honour of Serving I'll tell thee a brief Story to confirm this  An Officer of Note in his Armies the other Day being Governour of a Frontier Town that was threatned by the Enemy sent away his Pack of Hounds in which it seems he took great Delight and was heard afterwards two or three Times to curse the War which was like to deprive him of the Pleasure of the Hunting Season which was his darling Sport The King being informed of it sent for him and told him since he lik'd his Sport so much better than his Service he would oblige him in his own Way and so sent him into a great Forest where he made him GameKeeper with a very small Salary in a District of about Miles extent and ordered his Hounds to be sent down after him commanding him not to stir out of his Bounds which this poor Gentleman has been obliged to submit to nor have all his Friends or the Intercession of the great Officers of the Army been able to get him restored though he has a great Interest too  The King shews many Times such Testimonies of his Resentment upon his Officers when they do foolish Things but as to misbehaving in Action it is indeed seldom if ever seen here▪ it is impossible to describe to thee what a gene+ral Face of Joy there is here in the Count  +nances even of the whole Nation at the Prospe  of the War as if they were sure of Conque  in every Thing they go about tho' they are  this Time going as it were to engage with all t  World and be surrounded on every Side wit  the Points of their Enemies Swords  It is a strange Thing to see the Accounts which come in every Day from the  Rhine  the Frontiers of the  German  Empire where the  French  Armies have ranged unresisted both before and since the taking of  Phillipsburgh  They have several  Armies on that Side under several Generals though the Dauphine who commanded the Siege gives Orders to them all as Captain General and Commander in Chief The Marquis  de Boufflers  commands on one Side the Count  de Montall  an old Soldier on the other and the Marquis  de Uxelles  on a third and they extend themselves every Way The first of these has taken  Mayence Spire Worms  all  Imperial  Cities they have ravaged the whole  Palatinate  with Fire and Sword worse than a Hoord of  Tartars  do when they make an Inroad into  Muscovy  or  Poland  They have put Garrisons into  Creutznach Bacharach  and  Heidelburgh  the Dauphin has invested  Manheim  and the Marquis  de Boufflers  is gone down the  Rhine  as far as  Coblents  They have levyed Contribution even to the Frontiers of  Suabia  and  Franconia  and raised immense Sums of Money from the Princes of  Wirtembergh Baden Hesse  and others and from the  Imperial  Cities also  Franckfort  alone has been obliged to pay them an hundred thousand Crowns  Wirtembergh  two and the Circle of  Franconia  fix They have burnt six hundred Villages and Towns on both Sides the  Rhine  and laid entirely wast the most fruitful and pleasant Country of the  Palatinate  not sparing the fine Palaces of the Prince particularly that in the Castle of  Heidelburgh  which was the most beautiful in all  Germany  Nor do they spare even the Mosques or Temples of their Worship So that these  Nazareens  are the most barbarous of all Nations in the World for though they all profess the same Religion and worship the great crucifyed Messiah yet they permit their licentious Troops to destroy the Places set apart for his Service  The People here I confess do not seem to approve of this new Way of making War by burning and destroying of Cities and Towns which make no Resistance but the Court give this Answer that it is necessary at this Time to make the Arms of their King dreadful and to oblige the neighbouring  German  Princes to come in and pay the Contributions demanded which indeed they have done for Fear of the like Devastations for all this while there has appeared no considerable Body of  Germans  in the Field able either to attack the  French  or to protect their own People  Doubtless renowned  Hassan  the Effect of all this will be found to the Advantage of the Mussulmens Arms and to weaken the Forces of the Infidels of  Germany  in  Hungary  who dare to oppose thy Troops for the intestine Broils of these  Nazareen  Nations have always been and ever will be the Advancement of the glorious Ensigns of  Mahomet  May Victory attend those who fight under the Banner of the faithful

Kadeleskar of  Anatolia  I Cannot refrain laying at thy sacred Feet blessed Image of the Soveraign LawGiver what I meet with in this Part of the World suited to thy sublime Station and in particular  to that exalted Temper of thy Soul by which thou framest Instruction out of the evil Actions of wicked Men to the Advantage of the Just  Thou art to know then that the  French  Nation where I live have under the Conduct of a most furious and victorious Prince made War for two Years upon the Emperor of the  Nazareens  and that with great Success That in the Prosecution of this War and in Order as they say here to intimidate and terrify the  Germans  he has caused his Troops to make the most dreadful Ravages upon the Frontiers that can be imagin'd They set Fire to the Villages in a most fruitful and pleasant Country call'd the  Palatinate  in five Places at once  viz  on each Border of that Country and at one Place in the middle and suffered them to burn every Way till they all joined in one Flame It is not possible to describe to thee the Desolation made the Ruin of innumerable Families the Destruction of flourishing Cities fine Palaces the Murthers of Men ravishing of Women and all Manner of Desolations  But the Reason for which I give thee an Account of this Affair in particular is for what follows that the King of  France  after all these Cruelties and Inhumanities committed by his Command or at least by his Allowance has ordered a Day to be set apart for a  Biram  or Feast of Thanksgiving and to give Thanks to God in all the Frontier Towns on that Side of his Conquests for  compleating so glorious an Expedition  these are the very Words of his Orders The true Sense should have been for compleating the Ruin of the most flourishing Country in that Part of the World and scattering  an hundred thousand Families of miserable Inhabitants to seek their Bread besides the Murther Ravishments and inimitable Cruelties practised by the Soldiers in the Action  Surely these Infidels ought to be esteemed truly detestable for their Notions of the great ONE GOD who has created the World that they can think it acceptable to his divine Purity and to the Perfection of his Being to destroy his Creatures and depopulate his Creation or that he can accept Thanks offered up to him for Actions which it is most certain his Nature abhors I remember to have seen some Lines published in the  English  Tongue which it is said were thrown into a Mosque in the Capital City of the  English  Nation when they were giving Thanks to their  Nazareen  Prophet for the Discovery of a Plot for which some who had been found guilty of it were executed The Lines it was apparent were made by some who were of the other Side as follows  Ye Hypocrites leave off your Pranks  To murther Men and give God Thanks  Forbear for Shame proceed no further  For God accepts no Thanks for Murther  They must have very gross Conceptions of God I say who can presume to give him Thanks for the Devastation and Ruin of their Fellow Creatures and for the Rapine and Destruction which Men given up to the Fury of their Lust and Rage shall execute in the World if the righteous Power of Heaven concerns it self with any of the Actions of these Enemies of his Glory and has not resolv'd to give them entirely up to the Punishments of Hell he will certainly testify his Resentment not only for  the Crime of Blood and Destruction in the Fact it self but for that horrid Mockery of his Justice in entitling him by their praises to the Rapin which is in their Hands as if they were doing him an acceptable Service in sending thousands of Souls into the Regions of Darkness for the Caprice and Ambition of one Man  But that which is still more particular in this religious Mockery is that the  French  have obliged the very People of the Country it self to joyn in this Ceremony and have even prescrib'd to them a Text to preach upon being some Verse out of their ancient Writings thus  Come let us root them out that they be no more a Nation  This is the most horrible Imposition that ever I have met with of its kind and is indeed acknowledged by many to be very barbarous seeing these Men are all of one Religion professing to be all Followers of the Prophet  Jesus  the  Nazareen  their Messiah and Teacher  Sage Oracle of Heavenly Knowledge thou wilt read this History of  Nazareen  Hypocrisy with a just Detestation of Soul  Mahomet  has told us that God who is but one God will punish those with Fire who mock his Power and make a Jest of his righteous Government teaching Cruelty and Injustice for Truth and entituling God  who is gracious and merciful  to Robbery and Ravishment Injury and Blood  Paris  th Day of the th Moon in the Year  LETTER VII To the Kaimacham  FRANCE  has now pass'd the  Rubicon  she has declared War against  Spain  attack'd the Empire of  Germany  and made the most powerful Prince of the  Nazareen  's draw off his Troops from  Hungary  and bring Men into the Field against this one Aggressor and now to crown all She has broken with the Prince of  Orange  who is newly become King of  England  and with the  Dutch  who are his Allies and in short with all their Dependencies So that the King of  France  is like to have above Enemies in Arms against him by Sea and Land  As for the Affairs of  England  the King of  France  has furnished the old King with Men and Money and sent him to  Ireland  where he has so well ply'd his Time that he is Master of  Dublin  the Capital of that Kingdom and of the whole Island except one little City in the  North  Part called  LondonDerry  and that is besieged with Men and no Army in the Country to relieve it hence it must needs fall into his Hands so that King  William  so they call the Prince of  Orange  has his Hands full for some Time on that Side And we see the King of  France  baffling all the rest in so strange a Manner that if they do not concert their Measures better all the mighty Armies they have now ready against  France  will come to nothing  For in the very Beginning of this Year the  French  proceeding in their usual Method of ravaging the Country have actually burnt the Cities of  Spire Oppenheim Worms  and  Frankendale  to Ashes besides other smaller  Towns on that Side they say here that the  French  have been very merciful in the manner of their burning of these Cities  viz  in that they gave the People Notice some Days before to remove and they pretend now it was great Clemency that seeing the Inhabitants did not flie as they were ordered to do they did not turn them alive with their Houses  To withstand these Furies the Emperor has been obliged to recal the Duke of  Lorain  and of the best Troops they had in  Hungary  so that I make no doubt but the Grand Visier will have leisure this Summer to put the Resolutions of the sublime Council of Wisdom the  Divan  in Execution to extend the glorious Ensigns of the  Grand Seignior  to the Infamy of the Enemies of righteous  Mahomet  and to retake the Towns which have been lost the last three Years when the Success of the War for our Sins has seemed to go against us  These  Nazareens  Infidels Enemies to God and  Mahomet  are at this Time in a Word all together by the Ears and now invincible Man of Valour is the Time to gird on thy Sword and to appear to the Confusion of the Enemies of the

against the newcrown'd King of  England  but in this Declaration he is slyled the Usurper of  England  this new incident will probably produce great Events for the Prince of  Orange  is an implacable

Emperors and the most glorious Men on Earth yet happy only in thy Purity and Humility which originally advanced thee to the highest Pitch of humane Preferment for how much more glorious is it to thee to keep the venerable Dust of holy Men than to be Treasurer over all the Riches of the  Grand Seignior  or to have an hundred thousand Millions of Purses in thy Keeping  I think much of thy illustrious Office when I see here in the Mosques of this seemingly devout Infidel one called the Keeper of the Relicks surely there is not a greater Imposture on the Earth than this of Relicks is among the superstitious  Nazareens  in the Repositories of their Churches they have the Bones of any dead Carcase split into thousands of Pieces and set into Rings enchased with Gold surrounded with Diamonds one is called the Piece of the Scull of one Saint another is called a Splinter  taken out of the Finger of another when perhaps it is in Reality the Bone of a Dog or if of a Man or Woman perhaps it is of some infamous Creature broken on the Wheel or some Prostitute dissected by the Surgeon  These are worn about the Necks of Kings Queens Princes Ladies with Child Virgins  c  to preserve them from the Devil from frightful Dreams from Treason to keep the Women with Child from Miscarriage and the young Women from Fits Frenzies of the Matrix  c  and which indeed is the Intent and Meaning of all the holy Fraud they are sold for these Purposes by the Priests at an inestimable Price and the Juggle sometimes comes to Light  A Merchant of  Rochel  lately put an excellent Cheat upon the Dervices of a Convent or Cell of Religious near that City it seems the Merchant was in bad Circumstances as to his Estate and upon the Point of turning Bankrupt when a Ship coming into Port  Louis  from the  EastIndies  he forms a Letter as written from  Goa  by his Brother wherein he tells him of a most miraculous Relick of St  Thomas  being a Piece of the Scull of that blessed Apostle of their Religion which had done the most wonderful Cures in the most violent Distempers of the Head and Brain that it cured all manner of Lunacy and Distraction adding that he had Testimonials of the same from the Convent of Fryers of those they call  Jacobins  at  Goa  where his Brother had been and where all these miraculous Things were wrought and that in particular it restored the Memory in one who had quite lost all Sense of Things past for some Years by being put about the Neck the Jewel hanging behind in the Poll by the Hands of a Fryer of that Order and the like Having gotten  this Story put into Form and finding the Fathers very earnest to obtain this Jewel and willing to give a very great Price for it he accordingly obliges himself to write to his Brother to send it over by the next Ship taking a Contract from the Fathers for Crowns to be paid upon Delivery  Having obtained this Contract he goes to  Marseilles  with it where telling the Story as in Confidence to a Person there he acquaints the Bishop of that Place who being desirous to obtain so rich a Prize and viewing the authentick Contract of the Fryers of  Rochel  offers the Merchant Crowns for the holy Relick if he will bring it immediately to him The Merchant accordingly having all his Affairs ready and having a Piece of an old Scull made up in an Enchasement of Gold with the Date of the Year back about Years before the Time and the Names of two religious Men of  Goa  of the first planting that Colony whose Names he had learnt and the Work made so artfully as to appear very ancient I say Having all these Things ready he waits till an  EastIndia  Ship arriv'd at  Lisbon  from  Goa  which is a Colony of the  Portuguese  and then pretending to have received the Jewel writes to the Bishop who with great Solemnity received it and paid him his Money  This Story I do not avouch to thee of my own Knowledge the Fact if it were true having been done some Years before my Coming hither but many Cheats like this having been daily discover'd among them this is worth Credit Nothing is more strange to me than that a Nation so intelligent as this is should not long ago have been surfeited with these miraculous Fripperies and yet so  t is that they receive the grossest Impositions of this Kind every Day  I am told indeed it is by a  Hugonot  but one who gives such Testimony of it that it is not to be doubted That there are deposited as Relicks in several Places more Pieces of the Cross on which they say  Jesus  the Son of  Mary  was crucified than ten Yoke of Oxen could draw and yet we believe that he was not crucified at all but was received up into Heaven from the Judgment Hall of the  Roman  Governour and the  Jews  were obliged that the People might not enquire what was become of him to crucifie another Person in his Stead  Besides all this we have Reason to know that the whole Cross on which he was said to be crucified is miraculously preserved in a Vault arched over with Gold an hundred Eathom within the Earth under the Foundation of the great Mosque at the sublime Port which was formerly a Temple of the  Nazareens  dedicated as they call it to Saint  Sophia  so that all this Story of Relicks is no more than a Legend of Forgeries and Fables  And yet the great King of  France  who it must be own'd is a wise a sagacious a penetrating Man as well as a great King never lies down in his Bed without innumerable Relicks of Saints as they call them hanging about his Neck on the Curtains of his Bed and on the Locks of his Chamber Doors as Guardians and Preservatives to keep him from the Power of evil Spirits Nay there is no doubt but he has them upon him when he is solacing himself with his Concubines and Harlots of whom he has very many always attending his Pleasures  The Beams of eternal Peace shining from the Fire that burns over the Gate of Paradise be thy Protector from Evil Venerable  Morat  thou needest no Reliques near thee who art daily at the Gates of that blessed Repository to which all the faithful come in Pilgrimage from the Ends of the Earth  Paris  the d of the th Moon in the Year  LETTER IX To  Imanzani Mehemet  Kadilesker of  Romelia  IN all the World there is not a greater Impostor than this great Mufty or Soveraign Pontiff of the  Nazareens  whom they call the Pope the Chair they sit in and from whence they derive their pretended Infallibility has been defiled with more Monsters than the Idol of  Bassamene  in  Arabia  or the pretended Oracle of  Arsaballa  in the Desert of  Chusargha  sometimes indeed they obtain a Person of some Morals to fill that mysterious Seat of Wickedness  such was the late  Innocent XI This for ought I know may be permitted by the Subtilty of the Devil to keep up the Delusion that the People should not be so surfeited with the continual Crimes of the Pontiff as to abhor the Pontificate it self But even these Men of Morals have so much canting hypocritical Stuff mingled with their other Conduct and permit such Frauds such open Crimes among their Submufty's such as their Cardinals Bishops  Abbots and the various Orders of their  Dervices  or Clergy that certain it is and nothing more visible than that the whole Constitution is a stated universal Cheat  I have been curious to search into these Frauds for the Confirmation of the true Believers not but that we the true Mussulmen and Believers of the Verity know with a Certainty that permits us not to doubt that their whole System of this part of the Doctrine of the  Nazareens  is a Delusion and a meer Invention of their Dervices to establish an Ecclesiastick Tyranny in the World But it must needs confirm us all the more and add infinite Satisfaction to us to have this confessed and testified out of the Mouths of these Infidels themselves  I lately read some Tracts written by some of the most learned of this Nation of the  Franks  among whom I dwell wherein they speak with the utmost Detestation of this great Mufty called  Pope  and not so much concerning the Character or Morals of the Person tho' he who they have now elevated is but a very indifferent Person that Way but even of the Pontificate it self I mean the Authority exercised and the Principles professed by the See of  Rome  in general that is by the Pope Cardinals Bishops and all the cloistered Crew called the  Roman  Clergy  This Author whom they call Monsieur  Jeurieu  is one of those who are here call'd  Hugonots  of whom I have formerly written thee a large Account who have long since disown'd these People I speak of He is one of the most learned of these  Hugonots  and is now banished this Kingdom for his refusing to acknowledge the Pope but he is so far from complying that in  his Writings he offers to prove this Soveraign Pontiff not only not to be the true Follower of  Jesus  the Son of  Mary  their crucified Prophet and Messiah but an Apostate and that his Chair is the Seat of the Beast that his Power is not only not Christian but  Antichristian  that he is the great  FALSE PROPHET  spoken of in the Writings of the  Jewish Talmud  and in the Registers of their  Rabbies  which they call by the Name of Revelation Nay in one of his Books he calls the  Roman  Establishment which they call the Church the great  Scarlet Whore  producing sundry Predictions among the Writings of the Disciples of  Jesus  which give a very express and particular Character of the  Papal  Tyranny under such Denominations prophecying her Downfal at last under the Allusion of the Fall of the City of  Babylon  and that the Kings of the Earth shall hate her the Whore that is the  Papal Hierarchy  and shall burn her Flesh with Fire  Verily Great Apostle of the true Believers it seems to me that these Men whom they call  Hugonots  and who are the Followers of one  Calvin  who succeeded  Luther  in the first great Defection from the  Roman  Doctrines of Religion I say these  Hugonots  are a sober zealous People much more upright and devout than the Followers of the Pope and seem to me to have much the better of the Argument against them for albeit they acknowledge that the Church of  Rome  was originally the Church planted by the Followers of  Jesus  of  Nazareth  and continued faithful to the Institutions of the said  Jesus  as dictated to them by his said Followers yet they suggest that by the Corruption of many Ages and the assuming Disposition of the Popes and their Dervices or Clergy they have introduced  so many Innovations such Idolatrous Practices and so many detestable Additions to the first Doctrines left them by the Messiah that there remains nothing with them of the first Institution  It must be confessed  Jesus  of  Nazareth  laid down to his Followers and Disciples most pure and holy Rules both of Religion and of moral Vertue But it is true also that these Pontiffs and their Followers have filled them with so many horrible Impositions that the Originals are not now to be known especially that of their worshipping a Piece of Bread as a God suggesting that a few Words of a common Dervice can effectually transmutate the Species of Bread into the Substance of their crucified Messiah an Idolatry horrible and detestable  But I return to the Persons of their Popes to whose Crimes indeed all these Innovations in the Religion of the Messiah are owing I have formerly mentioned to thee and to thy happy Predecessor now rejoycing in the Garden of Pleasure the Story of a Woman counterfeit who was made a Pope but by being gotten with Child by one of her own Servants and deliver'd in the open Street in  Rome  exposed that Cheat to the World The  Nazareens  strive to reject it as a Falshood and charge it as an Invention of the  Hugonots  but besides that the Story is recorded long before  Luther  or any of those they call Reformers were heard of and is confessed by so many of their own Writers there is no Room to doubt of the Truth particularly one  Baptista Mantuanus  a famous Poet among them writing satyrically of Hell as if he was shewing a Stranger the Place and telling him where every great Person was to be found has it thus  Hic pendebat adhuc sexum mentita virilem  Foemina cui triplici Phrygiam diademata mitram  Extollebat Papix Pontificalis adulter  Vid  Pope Joan  p    The Sum of this shameful Story I find thus in another of their own Authors  Viz  that of Ravisius Textor in officina Lib  Scitum est ex Chronicis a majoribus scriptum Johannem Anglicum ab Ephebis sexum virulum simulasse tandem fatem nescio quo aut fortuna certè volente ad Pontificatum pervenisse in quo annos circiter duos federit post  Leonem IV  Neque priùs innotuerit facti veritus quam a quodam ex domesticis impregnata tandem emiserit partum  This is in a word That one  Joan English  having conceal'd her Sex from a Youth and appear'd as a Man and pass'd her Studies as another Author says as a Man was by we know not what destiny Elected Pope and sat as Pope two Years when being discover'd and gotten with Child by one of her Domesticks she was publickly deliver'd of it in the Street  It seems also she died in the Childbirth  But not to dwell on this Hellish Impostor the Characters of the whole Successions of those Infidels who they wickedly call  Holy Fathers  were it given thee at large from the beginning would astonish thee with their Abominations and Wickedness  Bless  Mahomet  and his true Followers who have been thy truly Virtuous and Holy Predecessors that the Chair of Sovereign and Sacred Jurisdiction in Matters Religious has never been tainted with the impure Lives of the Possessors but as thou art so have been  those before thee the bright Images of Virtue Patterns of Religion and exemplary Guides of Truth to the faithful  Paris  the viiith of the th Moon in the Year  LETTER X To the venerable sage Guide of Wisdom Prince of the Law of  Mahomet  Great  Muffti  and HighPriest of the  Mussulmans  I SEND thee bright Oracle of Truth and Virtue a piece of News confirm'd from all parts of the  Nazareen  Dominion  Viz  that the Great  Caliph  of the Christians Prince of the Dervices of the  Nazareen  Faith is Dead the Infallible Guide as they call him here the Mirror of Holiness is sunk into Earth as a common Man  If these Popes were really Persons of so much Perfection so infallible in their Decrees so replete with innate Holiness as Men here pretend and on the other Hand the deluded multitude did believe their  Messiah  had but as much interest in the Coelestial Paradise as we Mussulmans believe him to have he would never suffer any of their Popes to go into the Grave the common way of all Men but would certainly translate them directly into Paradise as  Enoch Elias  and himself were translated  But the Truth is they know all this whole System of the Pontificate to be a meer Dream  of the old deceitful Dervices who made a Trade of Religion to dive into the Purses of their Votaries and it appears because their most Holy Fathers or Popes are no more Immortal than they are Infallible from whence I infer that they are no more Infallible than they are Immortal  This deceased Pope was one of the honestest Men they have had in the Papal Chair this many Ages if it may be allowed to call a Father of Lyes an Impostor and the Head of a Cursed Imposture an honest Man But to give him his due he was honester than any of those whose Character I have heard of he was a just inoffensive Man in his Morals which very few of them are and as to the pious Cheat of his Office to give him his due he left it just where he found it Whether he had any Faith in the System or no I will not affirm but am of Opinion that he had not because he had too much Penetration to be imposed upon and yet I think he had too because he had too much Integrity to impose upon others But that which reconciles the two Extremes is that he was bred up in the Delusions and perhaps receiv'd the first impressions so deep when young that his Reason could not prevail over them afterwards And if it was so it was no strange thing in a Religion wherein one of the principal Rules of Faith is to have it follow those who went before them and value their Doctrine rather for its Antiquity than the intrinsick of its Principles  They called this Pope by the Name of  Innocent  XI The  Hugonots  and  Protestants  every where cried him up and he was called in general  The Protestant Pope  but this was principally on account of his Politicks not his Religion  in the first he was a Patron of Liberty in the last a Tyrant and Bigot But with this Explanation in his favour that in the first he acted Nature in the last he acted his Office  They tell us a good Story of him here which is an admirable proof of the generosity of his Nature and the goodness of his Disposition The Story says That an  English  Gentleman coming to  Rome  and being desirous to satisfie his Curiosity in seeing the Pope his Holiness as they call him having some intimation that he was a Man of Learning desir'd to talk with him and using very great freedom in his Discourse among the rest says the Pope if I mistake not I saw you yesterday at the solemn Mass at St  Peters  so they call the great Mosque at  Rome  where the Pope himself goes Your Holiness cannot mistake says the  English  Gentleman smiling The Pope understood him and found he had really committed a Mistake to say if I mistake not when he is called Infallible and that the Gentleman had touch't the Point in Repartee However being a Person full of good Humour he carried that off and turning to another Subject well says he you saw me in my Habits of Ceremony what do you think now of the Pope's being Antichrist The Gentleman was full of the Answer but loth to give offence and ask'd if his Holiness would give him leave to speak freely with all my Heart says the Pope I promise you I will not be offended  Why truly says he I will not affirm that the Pope is Antichrist but in my Country if there had been a HueandCry after Antichrist and I had met your Holiness in the Dress you were in yesterday I believe I should have apprehended you upon Suspicion  The Pope they say receiv'd the Jest with much good Temper but did not talk much with the Person after it and the  Hugonots  and  Protestants  make themselves very merry with the Story  They publish a Letter of Politicks in  England  which they say this Pope wrote to King  James  when he sought assistance from him against the Prince of  Orange  in which they say he blam'd him for offering to break thro' the Laws and Liberties of his Country on pretence of introducing the Romish Religion but the People here cannot bear to hear of that Doctrine which they say condemns the King in that very thing for which he ought to be Canoniz'd  In a word Pope  Innocent  was for every Nation enjoying their own Constitutions and carrying Religion on by Religious Methods not by Force Armies and Persecution but the Religion he call'd himself the Head of would not long subsist upon that Bottom  Paris  th Day of the th Moon in the Year  LETTER XI To the Illustrious Leader of the Armies of the invincible Emperor of the faithful  Mehemet Orchanes Ogli  Vizier  Azem  I Congratulate with an excess of Joy thy advancement to the high Command whereof thou art now possess'd and as no Man knows better than thy self how to execute the Office  of prime Minister in a State of such boundless Dominion so no Man knows more of thy Merit and Capacity for the Dignity than I who have been witness to the Greatness of thy Soul and thy indefatigable applications to Virtuous and Glorious Actions from thy Childhood It is now and at this distance that I foresee thy Valour and Conduct will curb the Insolencies of the Infidels and Enemies of  Mahomet  and restore to the  Ottoman  Empire those Towns which not the Valour of the  Germans  but the Negligence and want of Experience in former Officers have suffer'd to fall into their Hands  Wherefore is it that the Court of the Grand Seignior has known such Changes and that no less than seven Grand Viziers have been removed in five Years past But that Fate which has reserv'd the retrieving the Glory of the  Ottoman  Empire to a Hand and Head fitted by Nature for that Work might not only bring thee to this high Station but prepare for thee the Field of Victory and Peace  I am not caressing thee for Gain or swelling thy Vanity with words  Mahmut  knows not how to be a Hypocrite Flattery is the Sacrifice of Fools and a Gift that Wise and Great Souls abhor But it is reveal'd to me from the sacred Hills of  Besser Abba  and the Cave of Wonders  Mahomet  said  Amen  the Great Prophet joyn'd his Hands and shouted I heard the sound in Vision imperceptible the Oracle speaks by my Mouth CUPRIOLI  shall gloriously end this War the  Infidels  and  Nazareens  shall sue for Peace and it shall be given them  I live here in a Country of Enemies of  Mahomet  yet the King of  France  is both like thee in Glory and like thee happy in the most sublime  Undertakings he is unshaken in his Misfortunes and invincible in his Resolutions he receiv'd the last Year several Foils and Disappointments his Enemies in strong Confederacy took from him  Maynce  or  Mentz  an Imperial City and an impregnable Fortress  Keyserlauter  and  Bonn  also two very strong Towns and with them large Countries depending on them  But like  Anteus  who the Poets feign was the Son of  Terra  and had this benefit by his Birth that when he was in wrestling with  Hercules  thrown to the Earth he rose up seven times stronger than before so the King of  France  made more furious by his Losses makes such preparations for an offensive War this Year as the like is no where to be seen but at the stupendious Port where thou guidest the Helm of Empire and where all the Princes of the Earth do Homage  The Preparations here are incredible and the King resolves to take the Field in Person the Dauphine is to Command a second and separate Army and the Duke of  Orleans  the King's Brother a third Besides which he resolves to have a Fleet of Sultanas of the Line that is in the speech of the Sea in this part of the World of Men of War of Guns and upwards for no less Ships now fight in the Line of Battle  The Face of the whole Kingdom is cover'd with Troops and the Drums beat up in all parts all the Discourse is of Arms and Equipages and you would swear that all the People of  France  were to repair to the Borders to see the Fate of  Europe  decided The Great Cities and Towns are Tax'd at every one a Regiment of Soldiers or less according to their magnitude which they report will amount to  Regiments which shall bear their Names and be Cloathed by the said Towns and the Expence is to be repaid in three Years after the Wars shall be over or perhaps not at all for this King is not very nice in observing the Promises which he makes especially those to his own Subjects  Fear and Courage in War attend bad or good Success as the Rain and Heat do the thickness or clearness of the Air and the Hopes of Men rise and fall just as the Enemy they pursue rises or falls before them May early Successes crown thy illustrious Undertakings that the ancient Courage of the Mussulmans may revive in thy Glory and Victory may be the Handmaid of thy Wisdom and Valour  LETTER XII To the Aga of the  Janizaries  I Had no sooner heard of the Advancement of my old Friend Comerade and Acquaintance  Mehemet Ogli  to the illustrious Office of Grand Vizier but it foreboded to me that the Affairs of the Glorious Empire of the World would take a new turn Virtue and Magnanimity possest him from a Youth he was the delight of Wise Men and delighted in Valiant Men and is now the choice of Wisdom and Valour it self  As is the Man so are those under him his consummate Experience could not but dictate to him that for the accomplishment of his great Designs he must single out Instruments  qualified by their Virtue and Valiant Performances to undertake the greatest Actions  When I heard that thou wert singled out by him from among thy Fellows to be at the Head of the mighty Legions of the  GreenVest  and that the  Janizarics  were put under thy Command I expected no less than what I have since found to be the Consequence of such Conduct  viz  the Overthrow of the  Nazareens  I congratulate thy beginning of Success in this and the defeat of of their best Troops which I hear are the first Trophies of thy Conduct and will let the whole Mussulman Empire know what they are to expect from the New Vizier and those who fight under the Banners of  Mahomet  by his Example  Prostrate on the Earth I congratulate thy Lord in the success of thy faithful Services I will tell thee also in what manner the Infidels speak of this Action even among themselves for they have publish'd their own Shame from all parts  First thou mayst observe that in all other Battles they give false Accounts and relate such Actions not as they really are but as they would have them to be that they may buoy up the Hopes and Spirits of their People and keep up what they call the Reputation of their Arms but this late Action in  Servia  under thy Conduct has been so conspicuous that they have no false Colours sufficient to hide it and are bound to relate it in its true Circumstance Condoling with one another for the great Loss they have receiv'd I will give it thee in some of their own Words  'The Effects of the Great Changes at the  Ottoman  Court says one of those  Nazareen  Writers begin to shew themselves in a manner which justly alarms the  German  Court the new Vizier and the new Aga of the  Janizaries  both Men of a Martial Disposition and of great Experience in Military Affairs apply themselves to the Business of the War in a manner quite different from those unexperienc'd People who went before them In a word we have had a tast of their Conduct and it appears that suitable to the reputation of those two great Commanders the Courage of their Soldiery is reviv'd and the Hopes of the  Germans  in proportion declin'd  'He goes on to give good Advice indeed to the  German  Generals  Viz  to expect blows and to quicken their application to the War having a vigilant and valiant Enemy to deal with meaning the Vizier and thy self  'The Aga of the  Janizaries  says he not being able without indignation to see the  German  Troops insult the  Ottoman  Empire even almost at the Door of the Capital City and Seat of their Emperor resolv'd to attack the main Body of the Emperor's Forces consisting of Imperial Regiments of Foot of Men each and about Horse and Dragoons who were posted at  Nissa  and had ravaged the Country as far as  Uscopia  and Mount  Hemus  To this purpose ordering a Body of  Tartars  to pass the  Danube  about  Widin  the Aga advanc'd with a Body of  Janizaries  and  Sphais  and coming up within four Miles of  Nissa  joyn'd there with a Body of  Tartars  and with some  Hungarians  under Count  Tekely  and the next Morning attack'd the Imperial Troops Commanded by the D of  Holstein  The fight was very fierce and bloody the  Germans  defending themselves with great Bravery 'till  after an obstinate Battle of above four hours continuance in which a great many Men were kill'd on both sides the  German  Horse were oblig'd to give way and were put into some confusion and after some time more to a plain flight being pursued by the  Tartars  so closely that only about with the Duke of  Holstein  escaped to  Belgrade  the Duke himself very sorely wounded  'The Infantry being now forsaken of the Horse were surrounded and Charged in Front and Flank and in short were entirely cut in pieces by the  Janizaries  very few escaping and we hear since that the Duke of  Holstein  is dead of his Wounds  I send thee this Testimony to thy Conduct and to the Valour of thy Troops being made by the Enemies own acknowledgment and as an Earnest of what they ate to expect from the returning fortune of the  Ottoman  Troops  Heaven that always showers down Rewards upon the Faithful and Valiant give continued Successes to thy Arms 'till the Enemy vomit up their unjust Conquests and thou givest Peace to the Just in the Name of God and his Prophet  Paris  th of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER XIII To the most Perfect in Wisdom and Virtue the upright Instructor among the Faithful  Vahimi Effendi  Publisher of Truth and Teacher of Wise Sayings in the presence of the Grand Seignior  SURELY the Religion of these  Nazareens  as they manage it here among their Dervices or Priests of whom there are innumerable Sects is the most unaccountable mass of Contradiction that was ever heard of in the World And to do justice to the Lord of Truth and Righteousness who dwelleth in Unity the great One God who sent his Prophet the Son of  Mary  to instruct these Men in the way of right things I say to do justice to him it must be declar'd that they walk not in his Precepts as the true Mussulmen walk in the right Precepts of  Mahomet  It would offend thy Ears ennur'd to hear the Words of Justice and Wisdom should I give thee the detail of the Folly and Madness of these Hypocrites were their Prophet Jesus here now on Earth to see the Hypocritical behaviour of the several Sects of religious Thieves among them and how they sell Pardon of Sins for Money and send Souls into Torment or Bliss as their Friends are narrow or large in their Bounty to their Church he would scourge them out of the Mosques consecrated to his Name as he did the MoneyChangers out of the Temple for never was it so true as now that his House is made a Den of Thieves  But not only are the Religious among them a Crew of unsanctified Devotees but the manner with which they carry on their Fraud is in it self so ridiculous that nothing is more astonishing than that the People can be impos'd upon in such a manner and can take such Absurdities for Religion For Example  They Celebrate Yearly the Day of the Nativity of the Messiah Jesus But as if they were determined by Fate to be made ridiculous to all the Sons of  Adam  they cannot resolve among themselves when it was So tenacious also they are of their several Epocha's of Time and of the particular Accounts which one or other keep that each Country keep it according to their own way some ten Days sooner some ten Days later than one another and in the  Muscovire  Country I am told they have no less than several Accounts  In a word they know not when he was born And did not we know the certainty of these things by the unerring Revelation of our just Oracle the Alchoran which came from Heaven we might ask them how they knew he was Born at all or that there was such a Person upon Earth But we are able to give them a Truer Account of their own Prophet whose Pattern of Virtue we declare to them would make them perfect had they obey'd his Law with Sincerity and Faithfulness  Neither are they better instructed in the Nature and Reason of keeping  Biram  or a Feast on the Day of the Nativity of the Son of  Mary  for if they acknowledge him to be a Preacher of Righteousness then ought his Followers to practise according to his Example and when they Celebrate his Birth in whom they trust and believe should it not be to recommend  his Law to one another for the just observation of their People  On the contrary the Day of  Biram  or Feast observ'd for the Birth of their Prophet JESUS is a Day set apart for unbounded Licentious Vice as Gluttony Gaming excess of Wine and all manner of Liberty in those Crimes in which these Northern Nations surmount even the wickedness of the Luxurious  Egyptians  I Swear to thee by the holy Soul of my Father and Grandfather that there are not living in the Face of the Sun such a Generation of BellyGods as the Dervices of this part of the World who under pretence of Sanctity Abstinence and prosess'd Poverty wallow in Sensuality Gluttony and Wine and this is an aggravation of it that the Day appointed to thank God for the Birth of their Great Prophet is as it were set apart to provoke God to take from them the benefit for which their Prophet Jesus came among them  Nor is it in vain righteous Vengeance has filled them with their own ways and the Laws of Virtue and Truth which Jesus the Son of  Mary  left them to walk by when he was taken up into Heaven are lost to them being swallowed up in Hypocrisie and Innovation on one hand Ignorance and Immorality on the other  An instance of their Ignorance I shall give thee in another Case in which they are mockt by their own  eople and this relates to another Day whic  they keep as a Day of Devotion for the Crucifixion of their Messiah this they call  GoodFriday  but why it has that Name they cannot tell us neither is it known by one in five hundred amongst them what it is they  are to do on that Day or how to behave  viz  whether with Joy or Sorrow  It was yesterday that they Celebrated this Day in the Great Mosque of this City as also in all the lesser Mosques but I name the Great Mosque because when the People came to go into the Mosque or Church they found a Paper fix'd upon the Door with the following Lines in several Languages that all sorts of People might read it  Ye Hypocrites pull off the Sacred Masque  And of your selves this graver Question ask  Whether you are in Earnest or in Jest  Whether  GoodFriday  is a Fast or Feast  If as a Feast you keep the joyful Day  You joy that  Judas  did your Lord betray  If 'tis a Fast and all in Sorrow seem  You mourn that Jesus did the World Redeem  The People were so astonish'd at the Question which not any of them could answer that they read them with great attention and many took Copies of them so that it was to no purpose that the Bishop hearing of it afterwards sent his Officers to pull the Paper down for they were immediately made publick over the whole City and are repeated now in every Mouth with such pleasure that the Dervices are provok'd to the highest degree being banter'd and jested with about them in all Conversation Nay I am told the King himself could not forbear repeating them by way of Jest to his Confessor  But that which made the greatest Disturbance was that at the bottom of the Paper there were three other Lines upon the reading of which it was observ'd abundance of the more serious People began to consider whether they had best go into the Mosqe that Day or no and many of them really went back again The Lines were thus  Before you go to Church resolve the Doubt  That you may know what you go there about  And not go Wiser in than you come out  Had this happen'd in  Spain Portugal  or in  Italy  it is certain whoever had dar'd to take a Copy of them or to repeat them again especially by way of Jest upon the Clergy as they do here would have been clapt up in the Inquisition and never have come out but at an  auto de fe  with a  San Benitto  upon his Head But the  French  are a People of so much freedom in their general Conversation that they could never suffer the Yoke of the Inquisition among them  LETTER XIV To  Simeon Ben Habbakkuk  a Jew at  Salonicha

tell me are digested into Volumes in Folio to which he has with much Labour added all that he could reckon up or gather and perhaps invent and having Dedicated them to Cardinal  Mazarine  the Cardinal who perhaps knew more of the Cheat than Father  le Plesis  ask'd him to let him see the whole Work that he might cause them to be laid before the King and obtain for him some mark of his Majesty's Esteem the old Father tickled with this Compliment brought his Volumes in Manuscript curiously written to the Cardinal who took care of the Fryar indeed and made him an Abbay as we style them  Naki  Esscreff  or Chief of the  Emirs  I say he made him Abbay of a Monastry of Fryars  Benedictines  but never let him see his Books any more and I am told that after the Cardinal's Death they were found in his Library with this worthy remark upon them under the Cardinal's own Hand that they were a scandalous Medly of Ridiculous Tales and ought to be suppress'd  Be not angry grave  Simeon  if I think thou art studying and labouring spinning out thy Bowels and employing thy fruitless Years in a production which when thou hast finished will be of no profit either to thy self or any one else for as I have it from thy own Pen thou hast been this Years tracing Antiquity and the Learned Works of the Hebrew  Rabbins  to explain and come at the Original of the  Talmud  or Babylonian  Gemara  the  Misna  and the Lectures of the  Gaonim  and  Amoraim viz  the Expositors and Doctors of the Oral Law of  Moses  Alas  Simeon  I pity thy fruitless Labour thou hast gotten a Task endless as that of  Syssiphus  who was condemn'd to roll a great Stone up the Mountain  Aeger  which came back upon him immediately upon every lift he gave it and always left him just where he began  Miserable Man thou wouldst do well to transpose thy Studies from the subsequent to the antecedent and resolve first the previous Question Whether there was any such thing as an  Oral Law  committed to the Children of  Israel  by  Moses  yea or no and till thou dost this 'tis all but begging the Question to talk of the Authority of the  Misna  which in its pretence is a Body of Traditional Constitutions  But did ever Man of Learning spend his invaluable time in such a fruitless Study as this in which thou art sure to arrive at nothing but in a word to leave every thing more abstruse dark and difficult than you found it  I know it is in vain to urge to thee the words of Jesus the Son of  Mary  because thy thoughts of him are not the same as we  Mussulmen entertain for we believe him to be a Prophet sent from God but thou believest him to be an Impostor we believe he was Translated to Heaven as was  Enoch  and  Elias  thou that he was Crucified and that his Disciples the better to carry on the Religious Fraud doz'd the  Roman  Soldiers with an Opiate in some Wine and having cast them into a deep Sleep had stollen his Body away and gave out that he was risen from the Dead  But I say not to mention the preaching of this Jesus who expos'd sufficiently the folly and knavery of your Traditions and made even the Notion of an Oral Law ridiculous in it self I shall put thee upon this rational Enquiry  viz  Whether  Moses  left any such Oral Law or not and whether it does not appear rather to be the meer subtilty craft and knavery of the  Rabbins  pretending by suggesting such antient Institutions and undertaking to explain and expatiate upon them to gain reverence and respect among the People and indeed making themselves Lawgivers for it is evident that they have in the end given the same or a superior Sancti  n to the Tradition of the Elders  viz  the  Misna  the  Babylonian Gemara  c as was given to the written Law of God handed to them by the Ministry of  Moses  your great Prophet and Lawgiver  Now Sage  Simeon  what is the Evidence you have that  Moses  gave any Rules other than those which he left in Writing verily thou canst neither give Evidence of it or lay down any probable Scheme or Reason of it To give Evidence none will pretend nor do the most ancient Writers among the  Hebrews  go back to any time when it can be said by many hundred Years that any was alive who receiv'd  those Oral Laws from the Mouth of  Moses  the utmost Authority given by the Ancients and with which your People seem so well satisfied is this that they receiv'd it by Tradition  These Traditions are collected by  Rabbi Juda  a Learned Sage Man but he goes no farther back than  Simeon  the Just who by his acknowledgement liv'd not till above a thousand Years after the Death of  Moses  and knew nothing of what was left by  Moses  himself but what was upon Record in the Books called the  Pentateuch  except what was handed down to him by the Traditions that is in a word the Corruptions of the Elders  These Traditions then having no evidence of their Antiquity thou wouldest do well after the most curious search of Books to resolve them as  Gaffir Evilmouah  the Learned  Arabian  of  Medina  did long since into the corrupt Exposition of Dogmatick  Rabbies  presuming in Pride and Ostentation to impose their sence upon the Divine Institutions of  Moses  who also to add an Authority tho' surreptitious and assumed pretend that  Moses  was said to leave such Constitutions as explanations of the Laws of God as if  Moses  who was guided by the especial and particular Hand of Heaven and had the pattern of every thing given him in the Mount would not have been so just to the Children of  Israel  and so just to God himself as to have written for their farther Instruction every thing that had been necessary for their perfect understanding the Law of God if it had not been sufficiently explain'd in it self  Farther it seems a reproach to God himself if thou acknowledgest him to be a perfect Lawgiver that he should leave his Laws in so hidden and dark Expressions that  Moses  his Servant hidden  and by whom he promulgated the whole Tenour of his Will should be oblig'd to add to it an Oral Law as a Directory of its Obedience whereas in the rest there was not a stitch in the Curtains of the Tabernacle but what was particularly describ'd and directed from Heaven  But to carry it yet farther by the Translation as also by all the  Hebrew  Editions of the the  Pentateuch  which I have seen the last Chapters of the last of those Books contain a recapitulation by  Moses  to the People of all that God commanded him to say to them wherein he tells them the whole substance of the Command the plainness of it and particularly that it needs no Oral Exposition or Addition He makes indeed pressing Instances to them for their observance of the Law but does not say one word of its requiring an Interpreter or any Explanations Expositions or particular Directions On the other hand your Prophet  Moses  declared that there needed no such helps  Deut    For this Commandment which I command thee this Day is not hidden from thee neither is it far off It is not in Heaven that thou shouldest say Who shall go up for us to Heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it Neither is it beyond the Sea that thou shouldst say Who shall go over the Sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it But the Word is very nigh unto thee in thy Mouth and in thy Heart that thou mayest do it  The meaning is clear it is nigh to thee familiar to thy Understanding it is in thy Mouth that is in thy own Mouth thou needest no Teacher and in thy Heart thou needest no Explanation no Interpreter That thou mayest do it that is thou knowest it perfectly well and canst have no Excuse for not doing it  From hence it is observ'd in the Histories of the  Hebrew  Times that on all the publick Solemnities among the  Israelites  the Law was to be read to the People there was no occasion of Oral Expositions and Traditional Additions the Law was compleat it wanted nothing but to be read to the People it carried such Energy with it and was in all things so compleatly full so plain so intelligible and so convincing that to read it was sufficient  What then art thou doing O  Simeon  thou art but raking in Dunghils and searching the corrupt attempts of frail and erroneous Men to explain and expound the Law given in the most perfect form from Heaven by that God who cannot err and who exhibited his Commands in so perfect a form as needed no Explanations  Depend upon it Sage  Rabbi  thou art studying upon nothing but art surrounded with those cursed  Phaenomena  's of Human Inventions which for many Ages have been Darkning and Eclipsing not explaining the pure and unspotted Law of  Moses  your Lawgiver and your  Rabbins  have been now a thousand Years endeavouring to introduce their mean and debauch'd whymsies into the said Law as Institutions of God which is the worst sort of Idolatry just as the  Nazareens  here have done who by the pretended Authority of the Popes or Sovereign Pontiffs have introduced so many Oral Traditions into the Worship of their Prophet that they have very few of his first Institutions left among them  Be Wise in the conclusion of thy Days and leave off propagating Errors and imposing Human Inventions in the most pure Laws of the High One Eternal Being  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XV To the  Kaimacham  IF I judge rightly from what I have observ'd from the History of the Nations among whom I dwell I think the mighty Empire of the  Ottomans  is the only Kingdom or Government in the World which God has suffer'd to stand protected by his Great Prophet  Mahomet  without suffering the Revolutions common to these  European  Kingdoms This is a Testimony of the Divine Pleasure and may cause us to conclude the Empire of the Faithful to be the delight of Heaven  All the Kingdoms of  Europe  have either first or last suffer'd violent Convulsions Changes and Revolutions of Government as  Sweden Denmark Poland Muscovy Spain Portugal England  c But the Triumphant Empire of the  Ottomans  has from its first Founder continued under the same Government in the same Line and in a continual encrease like the growing Crescent the Ancient and Original Device of our great Prophet growing towards its full and has yet never suffer'd any Wain long may it encrease 'till it Triumph over all the Nations of the World and bring the haughty Empires of the  Perfians  and  Nazareens  to truckle to the Feet of the Grand Seignior  England  which among the Kingdoms of the  Nazareens  I just now named to thee to have already suffer'd Changes and Revolutions has suffer'd now about two Years ago a greater Change than any of those for Ages before for they have deposed their Rightful Lord and Emperor  and have by the assistance of a Dutch Prince called the  Prince of Orange  driven their King not only from his Throne but out of his Dominions and we see him here as a forsaken afflicted Man taking Sanctuary in the Court of his Neighbouring Monarch and soliciting him for Help  The King of  France  has always been vain of having his Court call'd the Asylum or Refuge of Distressed Princes and has often espoused the Cause of such to a degree which has been heavy upon himself and yet has so happily managed for such Princes that many of them first or last have been effectually restor'd as was the Case in the House of  Braganza  now the Royal House of  Portugal  several  Italian  and  German  Princes and others but he has had no luck with entertaining Kings of  England  For when he entertain'd once the Brother of this Prince many Years ago when Exil'd by his rebellious People he found himself oblig'd by the Usurper to desire him civilly to withdraw out of his Dominions again  But he has so effectually espous'd this Prince as to enter into a very terrible War in his behalf in which the Interest of the Person I mention'd who was  Prince of Orange  but is now solemnly Crown'd King of  England  has been such among the other Princes of  Europe  that the greatest part of Christendom  as they call it  is entred into a Confederacy against the  French  King and last Year it was thought would have bidden fair for his ruine  Not that I believe now they will all be able together to Master him especially if the Arms of the invincible Port do continue with Success to divert the Power of  Germany  from falling in with the rest for the Armies of  France  are infinitely  numerous and this Years Campaign has given a new turn to their Affairs their Cavalry which indeed must be esteem'd the best in these parts of  Europe  are exceeding fine and are led on by the most enterprizing daring Officers in these parts of the World and they again directed by Generals of the utmost Experience nor have they ever yet come to any decisive Battle wherein the  French  Troops have not gain'd both the Glory and the Field and that chiefly by help of their Horse  It is true the now King of  England  as they call him is a Prince that will never give it over and that by his Interest his Policy and his Alliances appears every Year stronger and stronger even after the most bloody Battles and Engagements  This will not be the Case in  France  for tho' the number of his Officers is inexhaustible and if a thousand Officers were kill'd in a Battle which has been the Case more than once yet there are such numbers of Gentlemen in his Army ready to supply their Places equal in Bravery and Experience to those that fall in the Battle that the Loss is not felt  Nay some have said that it is a Convenience to him that there may be room to gratifie the infinite numbers of depending Gentlemen whose Families expect to rise by the good Fortune of their Relations in the Army  But it is not the same with respect to the common Soldiers especially the Infantry for as most of the Infantry are Foreigners of all Nations especially  Germans English Irish  and  Scots  and all those Countries are now Leagued against  France  if these old Veterane Troops are once broken and destroy'd by long Service he cannot supply them again but  with Native  French  who tho' the Cavalry are good beyond compare yet the common People are small weak Bodies and not able to cope with the strong heavy Bodied Troops of the Northern Nations  Whoever therefore lives to see this War end if it holds on many Years as it is like to do will see the  French  Infantry grow worse and worse by Service whereas the Troops of other Nations grow better and better the Reason is because they cannot be recruited with Men of the same Nations and of the same Bravery and Ability as they were made up of before  But however as things are now stated the King of  France  seems to make himself terrible to all the Confederates grows upon them in every Campaign and is continually surprizing Towns and Countries from them by being earlier in the Field than their Armies can be gotten together so that he often forms a Seige in the beginning of the Year and takes the Place and lets his Army go into Quarters again before the Troops of the Confederates which are to be fetch'd from the several Countries where they are gone to Quarter can be in the Field  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XVI To  Mahumend Nassuff  formerly Bassa of  Caramania Reis Effendi  or Chief Secretary of State  SInce thy advancement to the Honour which thou now worthily art entrusted with of managing the Affairs of the happy fortunate Emperor of the World I have not written to thee but doubtless thou wilt find many of my Letters in the Cabinets of the  Bizraim  or in the  Oda  's of thy Predecessor whose Wishes are now consummated in Paradise the resting Place of the Faithful  Amurath Demir Ogli Omas Reis Effendi  to  Mahomet  IV under whose wise Dispositions I was continued twelve Years in this Post acted on this Politick Principle  viz  that it is always proper to a Minister of State to see with as many Eyes as he can for which reason he expected from me things of mean as well as of the greatest Consequence  But I shall furnish thee with Matters of weight only till I have thy farther Instructions Know then that this has been a Year of Blood among the Followers of the  Hebrew  Prophet and innumerable Armies have been mowed down by the Sword of Divine Vengeance in the Hands of Ambition and Revenge  Never did any Age since the beginning of the  Ottoman  Greatness offer so fair an Occasion for the glory of the Followers of  Mahomet  to extend it self over the whole World  The Animosity among these  Nazareens  is so great and they pursue one another with such implacable Fury that it looks as if they were firmly resolv'd never to have peace with one another any more but were to root those they quarrel with from the face of the Earth  The  French  are now at War with the  Germans  as the Grand Seignior also is and this War is carried on with such Cruelty and Rage that nothing is more grateful to them here than to hear of the Victories which the Mussulmans Armies get over the  Germans  and tho' Jesus the Son of  Mary  is their own Prophet too yet when thousands of his Followers are cut down by the Sword of  Mahomet  they Boast and rejoyce in the News albeit at other times they style the faithful Mussulmans their common Enemies  Last Year the  French  Power seem'd to be overmatch'd the Confederacy which is form'd against them was so formidable that they said it would be no dishonour to  Lewis  XIV to yield since no Man was born to fight all the World And yet this Year as if he coveted a War with Mankind he has engaged a new Enemy against him  Viz  the Duke of  Savoy  who calls for at least Men to be employ'd against him were it only to act upon the Defensive  It is however surprizing to see that with all these Enemies in Confederacy against him he has  even this Year  turn'd the Scale of Fortune on his Side in every part of the World On the  Rhine  his Generals have kept the Field and Encamp'd in their Enemies Country raising Contributions and causing his Army to subsist at the Expence of the Enemy In  Flanders  the  Dutch  Army has been defeated under Count  Waldeck  by the Duke of  Luxemburg  at the great Battle of  Fleuri  or  Flerus  Likewise at Sea the  French  Fleet has been superior both to the  English  and  Dutch  two Nations who in Distinction are called  The Maritime Powers  the  French  have brought into the Sea a Fleet of Sail of the Line a Number superiour to what ever yet was seen in the Channel and with this Fleet commanded by Monsieur  Tourville  they fairly fought both the  English  and  Dutch  Fleet united on the  English  Coast off of  Beachy  and got the Advantage having several Men of War of the  Dutch  burnt stranded or sunk and three taken  Only in  Ireland  the Prince of  Orange  has been victorious King  James  has had the Misfortune to be beaten at the  Boyn  and is come back into  France  for Shelter while the next Letters I may write may send thee an Account that he is so far from being successful that he has nothing of that personal Bravery which the World knows is necessary to a King for they all say here that tho' his Army retired the Loss was but small and he was under no Necessity of abandoning them by such a precipitant Flight  But to return to the  German  Empire  Doubtless the Advantages gained by the  Germans  over the Children of the Faithful for the last Years must be from the Anger of God upon the Mussulmans Empire for their Sins or must be the Effect of the ill Conduct of the  Grand Seignior  's Generals We shall see different Effects will follow different Conduct the new Grand Vizier is a Man who well knows how to rectifie the Mistakes of his Predecessors  and is far from being afraid to look his Enemies in the Face  Now is the Time to retrieve the Glory of the  Ottoman  Arms when a martial General is at the Head of the  Grand Seignior  's Armies and the  German  Empire is laid hard at on this Side so that they can neither spare the Troops or the Generals for the Defence of  Hungary  as they did before  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XVII To  Amurath Puelogli Chaious Bassa  his Brother's Son newly advanced to the Office of the Chief of the Messengers of State  WHEN I thought to have heard of the Proficiency of thy Studies and that thou wert qualifying thy self in the  Tetrehg  at the Holy City in Order to be one Day the Oracle of the Law of  Mahomet  and a Leader among the pure and unpolluted of thy Brethren those who open the Mouths of the Faithful in the Service of the ineffable Glory Behold how am I surprized to hear that thou art descended to the mean and servile State of a Courtier  Knowest thou that Heaven it self singles out in the secret Decrees of inscrutable Providence the Agents and Instruments of its own Work qualifying those Instruments for the Business and End in which they were decreed to be employ'd Knowest thou then my Kinsman and Son of my Blood that by thy accepting this secular Employment thou hast let us know that  Mahomet  has rejected thee as one not worthy to repeat the Holy Name of  Alla zeid mechet alla alla  sounded daily in his Ears by the faithful Dervices or to be the Interpreter of his Law  Canst thou who wert designed by thy pious Mother for the most sublime Office of the Great Mosque at the illustrious Gate of the  Seraglio  and mightest by thy promising Merit have been chosen of God for the HighPriest of  Mahomet  Canst thou quit the shining Glories of the Temple of the Faithful where thy daily Post had been to be surrounded with the Servants of God praying five Times a Day for the Health of thy Soul and to the Honour of our great Prophet and think thy self advanced with the gawdy Chain of a Minister of State and the Turban of a Bassa  I look upon thee as one fallen from the Pinnacle of Glory and placed by an evil Spirit upon the Precipice of Fate where it is a Million to one odds but thou droppest into the Abyss of Misery and art dash'd to Pieces upon the Rocks of thy own Ambition  Weak Man what art thou doing Knowest thou that Peace is the Glory of Life and that a Scene of serene Cogitation just Action and the Study of Wisdom is not only the most suited to the Happiness of an exalted Soul in the Station of Life but is an Emblem of Paradise and guides the Soul to the shining Gate of Bliss where thy Father's Fathers to a hundred Generations should have received thee with Musick and Dances and where all the happy Generations of thy Ancestors would have rejoyced over thee  Now I esteem thee as lost and if thou by thy Humiliation and the Prayers of  Mahomet  shouldest arrive at the Garden of Joy thou shalt nevertheless be received there as one who hadst cast thy self out by thy own Choice hadst rejected thy own Felicity and wast recovered by the compassionate Interposition of those more worthy than thy self and shalt have the lowest Place among the Blessed  Did ever wise Man who was by Nature and the Care of an indulgent Mother set apart for the superiour Blessedness of a religious Instructor of others so degenerate into Stupidity and Darkness of Mind as to damn himself to the empty Pleasures of a Life of Business and Repentances What

the Faithful  Morat Ebbuchebb  Kadilesker of  Salonicha  and the Isles  I Have been searching the Books of the ancient Doctors of our Law from  Omer  and  Osman  the first Writers of  Mahomet  's Institutes down to  Esad Mehummed Kalizecker  the great  Nakib Eschref  of the Emirs in the Hill of Admiration on the  Red Sea  I have examined the two hundred and seventy Mysteries and the Rules of Wisdom left written with a Pen of Emerald in the holy Mountain of  Ghazuan  in  Arabia  and I have not been without deep Contemplations from the Inspirations which our great Prophet  Mahomet  has afforded to my Prayers a Day which I used without ceasing for Months to know the Reason why the Infidels and cursed among the  Nazareens  are permitted to triumph over the Faithful and take from us Cities wherein Mosques have been built for the Prayers of the Mussulmans to God and his Prophet  I have first found and am assured that the Pilgrimages enjoyned by the first Commands of our Religion have not been performed so that our great Prophet not having been duly honoured by the Guides of the Faithful and the Servants of the mighty Emperor having  been permitted to transgress the Laws of their Fathers the Indignation of God is justly fallen upon them  I have likewise found that throughout the whole Mussulmans Empire the Commands of the One God have been transgressed in a Manner which has never been since the Alcoran came down from Heaven or since  Mahomet  took Possession of the Seat of Beauty in the Garden  I am inform'd by Inspiration from the three Spirits which sit on the Top of  Jathrib  on the Banks of the sacred River  Chahiber  that the Mussulmans are secretly addicted to Wine which is forbidden them by their Fathers and by the written Law  I swear to thee by the heary Scalp of thy Father  Aleb  and thy Grandfather  Raleb  belov'd by  Mahomet  and Favourites of Men as thou art Kadilesker and Judge of the Country round about thee if thou punish not severely the guilty Offenders the Christians who have already driven thee out of  Pcloponesus  for the Sins of the Mussulmans shall drive thee also out of  Macedonia  and thou shalt no longer preside over the Isles of the Arches  Put strictly in Execution the Laws of  Mahomet  IV the just and invincible Lawgiver and Emperor and cause not only the Cabarets or Taverns of the  Greeks  to be shut up but even destroy thou their Vineyards from whence the cursed Evaporation is drawn that the Laws of Sobriety be not broken under thy Government and the Offence be laid at thy Door when thou shalt come to the Gate of Paradise where thou wilt demand Entrance in vain if thou do not this Justice to thy great Prophet and to his chosen People  Let the  Germans Venetians  and others the Enemies of  Mahomet  and of his Law engross this Crime to their own particular Use let the Christians only be worthily esteemed the drunken Race let them drown in the Gusts of their wicked Desires and let it be said above that the Christians only are the Lovers of Wine and drink the Juice of the forbidden Fruit to Excess but let the Faithful abhor the Crime and let the guilty be punished with Severity  Then shall the Mussulmen be victorious over the Ensigns of the  Nazareens  and the Priests of  Mahomet  shall possess the Temples of Unbelievers  Paris  the th Day of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER XIX To the Kaimacham  I Wish thou wert to see as I do in this Place how the  French  esteem the  German  Troops which nevertheless they tell me are the Terror of the  Ottoman  Cavalry It grieves me to hear how those Infidels continually boast of defeating the  Spahis  and  Timariots  the ancient Cavalry of the Mussulman Empire invincible and terrible from the  East  to the  West  while the same  German  Regiments tho' arm'd with Curiasses fighting against the naked  French  Horse are cut in Pieces push'd into Rivers and Morasses and in a Word are made the Scorn of the World Believe me it cannot be the Vertue or Courage of the Men it must lie in the Ignorance and Want of Experience of the Officers  The new Vizier wants not that I should tell him how weak a Body the best Soliders in the World are in the Field if led on by unexperienced Officers if an Army of Hares with a Lion to their General was esteemed by the Ancients of more Use tham an Army of Lions with a Hare to their General then the placing unexperienced Officers at the Head of the best and bravest Cavalry of the  East  is nothing less or more than a sacrificing the bravest Men in the  East  to the Fury of their barbarous Enemies  The  German  Horse I assure thee are far from being terrible on this Side the World the  Gensdarmefrie  of the  French  King which  are Part of the Houshold Troops here as the  Spahis  or  Janizaries  are of the  Grand Seignior  's have frequently charged the Curiassiers of the Emperor Sword in Hand and not fir'd a Shot at them driving them out of the Field not valuing their Iron Caps Back and Breast  Indeed it is very seldom that the  Germans  ca  e to stand their Fury at the late Battle in  Flanders  fought on the Plains of  Fleuri  the Light Horse of the  French  Army called Carabineers broke Squadrons of  German  Horse called  Lunenburghers  and  Brandenburghers  by the meer Shock of their Charge and the good Management of their Horses and never fired upon them till they were in plain Rout  How comes it then that our  Spahis  who are the most exquisite Managers of their Horses and have the best Horses in the World are yet so often driven back by the Infidels I shall give thee one Piece of Advice in this Case which as thou hast a Martial Genius thou wilt not fail to accept for the  Grand Seignior  's Service The Horses of  Barbary Turcomania  and  Natolia  are of the finest Make the most beautiful in Shape full of Mettle and Courage of any in the  Otteman  Empire but they are not equal in Strength to the courser and heavier Horses of  Holstein  of  Saxony  and  Switzerland  of  Flanders  and of  England  from all which Places the  Germans  draw the heavy Horses they now use This Weight of Horseflesh is the Advantage in Battle as the Manner of Fighting is now used in these Parts  It was about the  second  Moon of the last Year called  February  that the King of  France  reviewed the Cavalry of his Houshold at  Compeigne  a Town on the Frontiers towards  Flanders  and as the King with the Duke of  Luxemburgh  caused the  Gens d' Arms  to march by his Coach he took Notice that many of their Officers were mounted upon the finest  Spanish  Jennets and Barbs that could be seen  It was usual every Year that the Troops were ordered to march immediately to  Flanders  from the Review in that Place but after this Review the King ordered them to Quarters which greatly surprized them but they understood it better when an Order came the next Day from the Mareschal  Boufflers  that the Officers of the  Gens d' Arms  should all change their Horses and should be all mounted upon stronger Horses and Days Time was given them to furnish themselves which was easily done in that Part of the Country and it was but two Months after when a Jest was put upon the Houshold Troops and the Guards  viz  That all the  Gens d' arms  were mounted upon Coach Horses  But they soon found the Advantage in Action for adding the Size of the Horses to the Courage and Bravery of the Men who are all chosen out of the best Soldiers in the Army they became a new Sort of People and it is seen now for no Troops can stand before them  Were the Grand Seignior's Cavalry thus mounted the  Germans  could not cope with them but as it is now they tell one another here that the  Spahis  are mounted to pursue not to sight if they had said to run away not to fight I could not contradict them for my Business is to hear and see and say nothing But I say would the Grand Vizier mount his Troops with the large heavy Horses of  Thracia  and  Macedonia  of  Trapesond  and the  Mountains of  Bosan  and  Mingrelia  tho' they seem fitter to draw the Cannon than mount the Troopers yet the Advantage of it would soon be found in the Field of Battle  Thou knowest I am no Man of War but as I see this Practice made use of here so much to Advantage by Men of Experience thou mayest find Reason to make use of the Advice as a Secret for the Service of the  Grand Seignior  Paris  the th Day of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XX To  Kara Humaizoth Ungwar  a Searcher of Ancient Knowledge a learned aged Emir of  Tacsebbassara  in  Arabia  IT is with inexpressible Joy I look back upon those few Days of my Youth which I spent in thy Arms thou who wert a Fountain of Wisdom and Instruction from thine Infancy the Knowledge not of the Language of the  Hebrew  so much as of the Learning of the  Hebrews  was thy first Study and I am not ignorant of the Perfection thou art arriv'd to in so many Years Application I know that no humane Understanding can reach what thou art Master of in the traditional Wisdom of the Prophets and Rabbies of ancient Times  How ignorant are the  Literati  of these Parts of the World in this particular that they think none of the Ages or Nations contemporary with  Moses  and the Elders were Partakers with them of sacred Knowledge or had communicated to them any Part of the divine Institutions which the  Jews  call the written Law  Is it possible that these Men should pass by the many Ages of Wisdom in which the  Arabians  who were for a thousand Years the wisest People upon Earth and from whom the  Egyptians  borrowed their Learning and Knowledge flourished as well in heavenly as in humane Studies We are not without Testimonies irrefragable that God revealed himself in diverse  Manners and thro' the Administration of divers Persons besides those Vocal Legislations and awful Appearances of Mount  Sinai  mentioned in the Writings of  Moses  called the  Pentateuch  Even the  Jews  themselves confess that their great Prophet  Moses  wandered forty Years in Foreign Countries from whence he returned fraught with Wisdom and Knowledge as well as with a Wife and a Stock of Sons with which he was blest in that Country which Country we know was on the Back of the Desert and inhabited by the Tribes of  Midian  all at that Time not only under the Subjection of the  Arabian  Power but Partakers with them in their Knowledge and Wisdom for which they were at that Time famous through all the Nations of the Earth  It is observable that even the  Jews  themselves when they would set forth the great Judgment and Understanding of their Lawgiver  Moses  they say he was learned in all the Wisdom of the  Egyptians  whereas we likewise know that the great Teachers of Science and Instructers of the Southsayers of  Egypt  were  Arabians  and that the Source of all their Knowledge came orginally from  Dh  arajara Gurbelhumar  and  Jabin Halfarecha  the most ancient Doctors of  Arabia  far elder than  Omer  and  Zebdanna  under the Teachings of whom the Soothsayers Magicians and other wise Men of  Egypt  had their Studies and went into the Southermost Parts of  Arabia Foelix  to hear and learn Instruction from them▪ So that for  Moses  to be learn'd in all the Wisdom of the  Egyptians  was neither less or more than to be a Pupil of the Pupils of the ancient most learned  Arabians  in whom the Perfections of  Knowledge in the first Ages of Time were treasured up and from them extended all over the World particularly from  Arabia  to  Egypt  by the Doctors and learned or wise Men of those Times from thence by the Learning of  Moses  to the  Jews  and by other Hands to the Sages of the  East  from whom the  Grecians  viz the Philosophers of  Athens  and of other  Grecian  Countries handed down and improv'd humane Knowledge to the  Romans  and to all the other Nations of the World  I cannot Sage Register of humane Knowledge pass over here the Confession of the  Jews  and the Testimony they give to the Truth I assert  viz  that the Wisdom and Knowledge as well divine as humane which was entrusted from Heaven with Mankind in those first  post diluvian  Ages as they are called was committed immediately and in a more than ordinary Portion to the  Arabians  above all the Nations of the World  This I say the  Jews  acknowledge in publishing to the World among the Books which they call Sacred The Book or Story of  Job  the patient This Book is not only graced with being written in the most sublime Stile that the  Hebrew  Language was ever written in and by which it appears that the ancient  Hebrew  was preserved in its highest Purity and Dignity of Expression but it gives undoubted Testimony to this great Principle  viz  that God revealed himself from Heaven to the  Arabians  for by the Confession of all the Geographers in the World  Job  and his three Friends were  Arabians  I say that God revealed himself from Heaven to the  Arabians  in the like and perhaps every Way as glorious a  Manner as he did afterwards to the other Posterity of  Abraham  the  Israelites  The whole Tenour of that Book which they call of  Job  intimates strongly a Supremacy of divine and natural Knowledge infinite Transcendencies of Wisdom shine in every Part of it all rational and supernatural Powers are exerted in the Significancy of Expression the Pungency of Replies the Beauty of Stile the Vivacity of Expression in the arguings of his Friends and the Sufferings of himself all generous Principles are urged acted and improv'd the most passionate Expostulations that can be conceived break out from the Mouth of the grave Patriarch under his strong Pressures as from a Spirit overwhelmed yet tyed down to the Principles of Humility Resignation Penitence and all the Graces of a religious Mind and all these appear in a resplendent Manner even unutterable in any Language since that time known in the World Nay even unutterable in the very same Language by any other Mouth  No Example like it can ever be produced thro' the whole History of Time among the  Jews  even by their own Confession Now  Job  by all the Descriptions that can be given was an Inhabitant of the Land of  UZ  This  UZ  is according to their own Doctors a Country denominated from  UZ  the Grandson of  Noah  by his Eldest Son  SHEM  whose Posterity multiplying after their coming out of the Ark extended themselves  Southward  into the most fruitful Countries of  Asia  such as  India Persia  and  Westward  into  Syria Damascus  and  Arabia  justly called the happy and their happy Posterity are seated to this Day abounding in Wisdom and Knowledge and consummated in the great Lawgiver  our sublime Prophet whose Remains rest in the shining Valley of Beatitudes and the blessed Shades of the Holy City  O might I obtain the Blessing of returning from among Infidels and the impure Nations of  Nazareens  Impostors who profane our Law and give to the Almighty One God a Partnership of Deities that my Ashes may rest in Peace among Believers and my Spirit pass from the pure Society of the faithful Mussulmans to the Regions of sublimated Pleasure and the inexpressible Joys of the Heavenly Garden more beautiful than that of  Eden  This would cause new Spirits to rush into all my Veins new Vigour into all my Limbs and aged as I am I could travel nay flie from this Exile and make the Holy Pilgrimage on my bare Feet from  Paris  to the City of Wonders the glorious  Medina Acheb  Whither am I transported While I speak of these Things I am wrapt up with inconceivable Pleasure and scarce know whether my Soul is embodyed or unembodyed Go on thou Man of Perfection continue to be the Oracle of Wisdom the Stream of Instruction the Wisdom of the wise Eyes to the blind and the Joy of the Faithful I shall speak more to thee of these Matters if the languishing Life I groan out here permits me Time  Paris  the th Day of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XXI To  Draout Zemaoglan  his near Kinsman ƲnderClark or Deputy to the  Reis Effendi  or Secretary of State  IS it not strange that while I am daily writing Letters to thy Master of the greatest Importance and giving him an Account of the Success of the great Enterprises which are undertaken and the Victories gained by the  French  over the  German  Emperor and his Allies I say is it not strange I should sit still here perfectly ignorant of either the Fate or the History of what is doing in my own Country and among my own Kindred  How cometh it to pass that thou who art the right Hand to him who is the right Hand of Councils and keeps the Secrets of the mighty Empire should not inform me at this Distance of the great Turns in the Administration since the last Year how the new Vizier has been exalted and how to shew himself illustrious and great in Action as in Council he has restored Victory to the Arms of the Grand Seignior by fighting the Battle of  Nissa  and cutting in Pieces above of the Infidel Troop  It is true I hear all this and am able to send thee Particulars which thou knowest not of but this is owing to the Intelligence I keep in the Courts and Councils of Princes who are Enemies to the Grand Seignior and therefore  cannot always prevail with themselves to speak the Truth  Besides hast thou no sympathetick Sense of the Joys or Griefs of an absent Parent That would be to suppose that thou hast none of the Blood of thy Father's Brother in thee or that He and I having the same Father and Mother thou hadst still no Part of us communicated by Generation tho' by the Laws of Nature which change not the volatile Particles of thy Blood maintain an invisible Correspondence with those of thy Father's Father who was my Father whereby thou inheritest the same Passions Temper Fire and Phlegm and shalt act in Consonance to the Humour and Constitution of us that went before thee even involuntarily and by a natural Force of sympathetick Powers which thou mayest not perceive  By the same Rule thou art of Necessity inspired with the generous Principles of thy Grandfather and canst not be unmindful of thy Father's Image who is now tho' thus distant and remote the nearest Parent to thee in Blood and in whose Affection thou hast so great a Share that by Sympathy it is impossible for us to be unconcern'd in the Griefs or Joys of one another which Griefs or Joys tho' unknown to either are communicated by the invisible Converse of Spirits  Whence else is it that involuntary Sadness seizes thy Heart at Times when perhaps thou seest nothing near thee but what is the Subject of Pleasure and Joy At that Moment doubt it not the Soul of thy dearest Parent  Mahmut  here at this vast Distance suffers Grief perhaps from Distempers of the Body  Torture of the Mind Disappointment Affliction or some latent Cause of Sorrow unknown to thee  By the same secret Influence I feel secret Impulses of Joy by a sudden Spring of Spirits thro' my Blood which lifts up the Soul above Grief above all the Reach of humane Accidents and above even my Power of expressing I conclude then thou or some yet nearer Relation perhaps my Mother thy Grandmother receive some Advancement some Smiles from the sublime Majesty of the Grand Seignior some uncommon Token of Prosperity which is thus communicated to me by the inconceivable Power of sympathetick Influence and the free Intercourse of Spirits Thou knowest not perhaps how to express this or at all Times to distinguish it but assure thy self if thou lissen vigilantly to the Voice of this silent Instruction thou shalt always find in thy self secret Intimations of all the good or evil that attends either thee or thy Family  I return to my first Complaint The invisible Correspondence of our Souls will communicate Things particular to our selves but there is not the same Conveyance of Things publick and affecting our Country for tho' Affection to our Country may carry us high yet there is no secret Sympathy nothing mutual between us there we are not of the same Species or modell'd in the same Mould of Nature with our Governours whereas the Channels of Blood in Relatives come from the same Spring partake of the same Temperament and receive Motion from the same Principles  I conjure thee by the Blood in thy Veins springing from the great Fountain of  Guebirava  in  Arabia  the Source of our Generation by the Graves of our Ancestors buried under the Hill  Abirjuvan  by the Head of thy Father and the right Hand of thy Mother that thou forget me not in this Exile but communicate to me of thy Welfare and of all the publick Affairs of the Mussulmans Empire to which may all Prosperity be given and may those who envy the Grand Seignior be brought bound to his Saftre and receive the Judgment of Rebels from his mighty Hand  Paris  the th Day of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XXII To the  Reis Effendi  or Secretary of State  IT is with an inexpressible Satisfaction that I see here the Accounts from the Frontiers of  Hungary  of the Progress by the victorious Arms of the Grand Vizier and the Consternation of the Infidels at the Success of the Faithful  The  French  partake of our Joy the War against the Emperor being of great Advantage to them It is by their Means that I have a true Account of the glorious Successes of the  Ottoman  Forces over the  Germans  they tell me the Grand Vizier has taken  Nissa  in Consequence of the Battle near that Place wherein the  Germans  lost seven Princes and Men of their best Troops that the Serasquier  Ibrahim  has taken the Fort of  Piroth  on the River  Moraw  and the Town of  Widin  on the  Danube  so that all the Province of  Servia  is cleared of the  Germans  who are driven to the Gates of  Belgrade  At the same Time that they were expecting Accounts of the farther Progress of the ever victorious Vizier they received an Account another Way of a yet more terrible Blow given the  Germans  by Count  Teck  li  the  Hungarian  Malecontent who assisted by a Body of the Grand Seignior's Troops attacked General  Heister  in his Camp near the Port  du fer  or the Iron Gate being a Pass through the Mountains  of  Transilvania  the  German  General had Foot and Horse of the  Imperial  Troops with Heydukes and  Transilvanian  Foot But were attacked with such Fury by Count  Teckeli  's Foot backed with a Body of  Janizaries  that they were entirely defeated and so compleat was the Victory that not of the  Germans  have escaped being cut in Pieces General  Heister  himself is taken and all the other General Officers kill'd or taken  These Things I do not write to thee to inform thee who hast without Dispute long ago the truest and first Account from the Grand Vizier himself and hast communicated the Joy of it with the whole Body of the Faithful But I write to let thee know also the Influence these Successes of the invincible  Ottomans  have on these Parts of the World the  French  rejoyce the Neutral Princes stand in a Kind of Surprize but the  Germans  are every where in the greatest Consternation imaginable not doubting but the victorious Crescents will spread like a Torrent and in a little Time regain the whole Kingdom of  Hungary  and unravel all the Conquests of their great Hero the Duke of  Lorain  nor would the Consternation be much greater if the Grand Seignior's Armies were at the Gates of  Vienna  than it will be if the Grand Vizier should take  Belgrade  which I will not doubt  Happy be the Days and prosperous the Hands of the Faithful may the vigilant and undaunted Leader of the  Imperial  Armies of  Mahomet  go on successfully to the End of his Wishes and fulfil all the Expectations of the Grand Seignior and of all that wish the Prosperity of the Mussulmans Empire  But give  Mahmut  Leave to expostulate with thee in this Part and to complain that I have  here no Information in these Things however important but what I receive from the Hands of Strangers and from the Publick Printed Papers handed about among the Infidels wherein such is the Spirit of Falshood that reigns among these Pretenders to Uprightness that they report every Thing their own Way and just as they would have it be  If a Victory is obtained by any of their Armies whether it be one Side or other they oftentimes on one Hand magnifie the Particulars and reckon up the Numbers of the kill'd and wounded to be more than the Party defeated really had in their Army and if you hear the Story again from those who were beaten you fail not to lessen the Number of the Armies and to give an Account of the Action as if very few were kill'd wounded or taken Prisoners so that oftentimes we find many more Prisoners to ransome by a great many than were really taken in the Fight  I that fail not always to supply the Office of Secretary of State with needful and full Intelligence of Things done in these remote Parts of the World ought not to be kept ignorant of our own Affairs or in what Manner to represent the Figure which our Illustrious Emperor makes in the History of the Times  It weakens me in the Judgment I am to make of Things when I know not how they go and I am not able to make just Representations or give true Ideas of Things to those I converse secretly with if I know not how Things go at the illustrious Port wherefore I intreat you let me be as at first fully informed of every Thing so shall I be enabled to give right Council and right Advices of all Matters  Paris  th of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER XXIII To  Solyman Hagzani Oglou  Aga of the  Janizaries  I Have received thy welcome Letter which is the more so because it signifies to me in so many Words that this Express is sent me by the particular Order of the Grand Seignior himself The Words were no sooner sounded by my Voice but without being able to read any farther I turned my Face towards the happy Shades of  Mecca  and blessed the Memory of our great Prophet  Mahomet  washing my self with Water and making my Prayers in Form as for the greatest Occasion that could befal me and which commanded Worship and Thanksgiving with the highest Reverence and Joy of a true Believer  Kings the mortal Gods on Earth acting by the same Methods of Justice and Benignity as the mighty Soveraign of the World tho' in a different Proportion command the same Reverence and Homage in a due Proportion likewise from those upon whom they please to shine  It is not a common Thankfulness which such Beams of Favour command from Subjects the Benignity is of a sacred Original the Homage partakes of the sublime and next to our Adoration of the One God Father of Life and the Rewarder of the true Believers our most perfect Submissions and most prostrate Affections are due to the shining Glory of our imperial  Benefactor Image of Glory and supream Fountain of Splendor upon Earth the Mirror of illustrious Light and the true Representative of inconceivable Brightness  This Duty I perform from my Soul I am exalted to a sublime Joy unequall'd by any thing on this Side the  lden Gates of Paradise I am lifted up in  rasies of inward Delights unexpressible and  m a Fountain flowing Streams of pure Affection Obedience and unbyass'd Duty to the Interest Service and Person of the great Lord of the Kings of the Globe the Emperor of the Faithful  'Tis a Heaven on this Side Paradise to serve so glorious a Master to die in his Service is to inherit the brightest Circle of  Eden  and to be transported immediately into the Garden of inexpressible Delight  Our immortal Sultan has not a more faithful Slave in the Extent of his unbounded Empire than  Mahmut  who has serv'd with an inviolable Fidelity almost fifty Years in a Station equally unhappy as unpleasant but it is more than a Reward to all those Services that I am at last favoured with having my Name mention'd by the Mouth of him who is clothed with Glory and overshadowed with the Light of the eternal Benediction  The Sum of Money thou hast likewise sent me by Bills upon the Banquier of the  French  Ambassador at the Port however great my Necessities are is in no Comparison equal to the Solace of thy Letter as being sent by Order of the Emperor of the World  I prostrate my self on the Ground and kiss the happy Dust at the Feet of our resplendent Emperor offering up ten Thousand Prayers for the eternal Felicity of the Beloved of God  and I demand of thee to do Justice to  Mahmut  in returning the most submissive Acknowledgments of a devoted Slave  But after all this had lifted up my Soul beyond the Power of its conceiving and I stood dumb and mute as one in a Trance dazled with the Glory of the great Sultan's Favour I was yet farther surpriz'd with the happy News of the Progress of the victorious Arms of our Emperor under the Leading of the Grand Vizier in  Hungaria  and the amazing Account of the Recovering the Fortress of  Belgrade  out of the Hands of the Infidel  Germans  So much good News together was too much for an old Man to bear and fainting under the Weight of exuberant Joy I made good that Saying of the Ancients  viz  That sudden Joys like Griefs confound at first  It has been a Pain to me illustrious and happy  Solyman  that I have been obliged to keep my Letters thus long in return to thine which came to me with such Expedition that I had contrary to all the Usage of such things the News of the taking of  Belgrade  from thy Hand before it arriv'd here by Expresses from  Vienna  The swift Chaioux who brought on the Wings of Joy the pleasing News to the Emperor brought a Blessing from  Mahomet  with the Report of a Victory fair Winds and a quick Passage join'd to disperse the Tidings to all the World the Vessel which brought the happy Account past with a surprizing Pace and perform'd in seven Days her Voyage from the happy Port the Centre of circling Commerce to  Marseilles  from whence the Post brought me thy Letters in nine Days more by Land I understand  since that the  English  Ship which carried the same News to  Smyrna  and  Alexandria  had so happy a Passage that she perform'd the first in four Days and the other in Eleven more scarce would the Air have handed on the Thunder of the Blast from  Belgrade  so far and so soon when the Magazines of Powder were blown up could the incessant Vibrations of Air have been continued to the Distance I speak of  Happy Blast that has transferred into the Hands of the Grand Seignior a City engrafted into his Empire in which were Nine and fifty Mosques consecrated to  Mahomet  and not longer by the whole Power of Earth to be detained out of the Possession of the Just  It is possible for thee to exceed my Joy in this Place because thou partakest of the Pleasures of the Serail and seest the Smiles of the illustrious Port upon this Occasion but it is impossible for thee to see and indeed to entertain any Idea of the Consternation which the Enemies of  Mahomet  and of the invincible Sultan are under upon this Occasion  They are not only astonish'd at the Loss but at the Manner of it how one Bomb directed by Heaven should fall so into one Magazine as not only to blow that particular Place up but from thence to communicate its Fire to the reserved Coverts of all the Magazines in the Place and transverse the whole City This amazes them and they see clearly that Heaven fightsagainst them that the faithful Mussulmen are predestinated to be Lords of the Universe and it is to no Purpose to lift up the Hand against the Beloved of Heaven  Paris  th of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER XXIV To  Morat Abdomozar Ephiesman Oglou  a Student in the Law of  Mahomet  THOU that hast spent thy Years in the Study of the mysterious Vision and art Master of the secret Interpretation tell me where will the Superstition of the  Nazareens  end who while they pretend to be the most devout among the Servants of the Messiah are the busiest People in the World to perswade themselves out of all Sense of Religion in the World  Where sleeps eternal Justice and how far may Nations strive with Heaven insult the Being of the God of Nature and call aloud for the just Retribution of their Crimes and yet slow Vengeance not be prevailed with to exert its Power and to destroy them no not at their own Request  What is the Punishment righteous  Morat  if any Mussulman should be so far degenerate as to deny the Being of the great One God what says our great Prophet whose Law teaches upright things  I know thou wilt answer as the Philosopher  Lycurgus  the Lawgiver of the  Grecians  did when it was ask'd him why he had appointed no Punishment for Parricide  viz  that it was a Crime not to be named among his Citizens and therefore needless to be enacted or provided against  Sure of all the Religions that were ever erected by the Wit of Men and of all the Gods that have been adored among the Heathen never any People deviated into these Disputes about them before all the idolatrous Nations in the World have retained this as a first Principle  Nulla Gens tam barbara quae nescit esse Deum  But the  Nazareens  the Worshipers of the Messiah have run such Divisions among themselves and rais'd so many Quarrels about Religion that they are at last willing to think they have been all along in the Dark and that there is no such thing as Religion in the World or any such thing as a God to be worshiped In a Word they have phylosophiz'd so long about their God and how to call him that they have quite lost him and are daily questioning among one another whether there really is any such thing or no in the World  Nothing is more certain than the Vanity and Perplexity of SchoolDisputes Men may distinguish themselves into and out of any Opinion or Religion in the World but among all the sorts of Infidels that ever infested the World these Christians as they would be called are arriv'd to the highest Pitch of Infidelity for they are now come to resolve all Religion to be a Politick Cheat Notions of a God to be a Craft of the Schoolmen and in a Word to deny the Beginning and End of all things  These Men are arrived to a Degree of Crime which Lucifer the great Angel and Prince of the dark abode never pretended to the extensive Knowledge of Devils forbids that they should once suggest to themselves the NonExistence of that Being whose Power they feel  in pungent Torture invincible and inconceivable nor are there any Atheists in the Islands of Perdition Those who have pass'd the Gulph into the Abyss of Plagues and Darkness are too well convinc'd by their Miseries of the Reality of that Being which they before denied  But 'tis in vain to talk to these Men who nothing but the Sables of Tophet can undeceive they laugh at the local Prisons despise being subject to Torment ridicule the Notions of a God a future State and all that which wise and good Men believe concerning Rewards and Punishments 'tis of no Force to tell them they outsin the Devil and that the King of the eternal Pit believes nay knows with Horror the Beatitudes which he is excluded from for they believe as little of a Hell as they do of a Heaven and own no Devil any more than they do a God  Divine  Morat  this is a Sin not to be nam'd or to be found among Mussulmen it is the just Distinction of the Righteous that they are Believers that they know there is One God that he is but One and that  Mahomet  is his Prophet  All the Celestial Chapters of the  Alcoran  that divine Oracle which came down from Heaven are introduced  in the Name of God Gracious and Merciful  We are therefore called the faithful Mussulmen because believing in One God to rase out the Name and Belief of God out of the Mind is to apostatize from our Faith and as it were to become a Christian for among them only are Atheists to be found among them alone are to be found Men vested with reasoning Powers and Faculties yet denying the Being  of him by whose Gift they enjoy those Powers  By  Mahomet  by the Graves of  Omar Ekkbutar  and the Forefathers of the holy  Mirza Muhamed  the Beginning and first Fruits of the Faithful  I swear  if these Men had been living in the Days of our great Prophet the  Alcoran  should have had Five Chapters of Curses and Execrations against the Wickedest of all Wickedness I mean this of denying the Being of a God a Crime against Nature against common Sense against Demonstration against invincible Testimony of Ages past in a Word against the secret Conviction of the Minds of those who are guilty scarce a Man of them being without such Testimonies of their own Consciences within in behalf of the eternal God that made them that in Spight of the most harden'd Resolution it reproaches them and when they suggest No God replies  THOU FOOL  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XXV To the Prince of the Servants of God Guide of the Faithful Mirror of Wisdom and Council the venerable  Esad  high in the Favour of the Grand Seignior and our great Prophet  Mahomet  THO' it is not the most agreeable Thing in the World to write to thee of War and of fighting who art the Lamp of Truth and the Guide to Peace yet the Story of daring Vertue taking Arms in their Hands for Truth and Right is so much within thy Sphere that I cannot doubt it will be pleasing to thee  The Duke of  Savoy  an enterprizing Prince and one who has too long fallen into the  French  Methods of Government or rather religious Tyranny over his Subjects had some Years ago banished an innocent inoffensive and gallant People out of his Dominions because of their refusing to comply with some of the Ceremonies and Formalities of the Worship of that Part of the  Nazareen  Profession call'd  Catholick  or  Roman  These People were Inhabitants of the Vallies scituate among the most inaccessible Parts of the  Alpine  Mountains those stupendious Hills do not like our  Caucasus  or Mount  Hemus  run on in a continued Ridge and Chain of Rocks but they often break off abrupt and standing  up in high Pyramidical Precipices and inaccessible Steeps leave Intervals of the deepest Valleys which being thus walled about by unpassable Hills are indeed natural Fortifications of themselves The Inlets into these are so difficult and in some Parts so impracticable that Men have been known to be able to defend one of them against ten thousand but when one is entered tho' the Hills and Mountains with which they are surrounded seem to touch the Stars yet the Valleys are the most agreeable pleasant fruitful and habitable Places imaginable  The People of these Valleys are a painful honest industrious People also daring and brave to the last Degree Subjects generally to the King of  France  or the Duke of  Savoy  till one comes further  North  when the Vales are larger and more populous being the Remainders of the ancient  Helvetians  conquer'd by  Julius Caesar  and now called the  Swiss Cantons  These  Vaudois  so they are call'd from the  Pais de Vaux  or Valleys are not only of the Sect of the  Nazareens  called  Protestants  but they boast that they embraced the Christian Religion from the pure and primitive Times of it when it must be confess'd the pure Doctrine of  Jesus  the Son of  Mary  was more sincerely adhered to than it has been since the Papal Hierarchy for since that it has been corrupted with Traditions Innovations and humane Inventions till it is quite degenerated into a Mass of Error and Superstition  The Duke of  Savoy  had as I said banished these People out of their Habitations taken from them their Substance Estates Habitations and even from some their Children driving  them to seek their Bread in Foreign Countries where the Charity of other People might support them In this Condition they fled to  Geneva  and the  Swiss Cantons  being the neighbouring  Helvetia  which I just now named where they were well receiv'd harbour'd reliev'd and permitted as well as assisted to settle nor had they any View of being restored especially while the  French  and  Savoyard  acted against the  Protestant  Interest in Concert with one another  But now seeing the World embarrassed in War and not so good an Understanding between the  French  and the Duke of  Savoy  as used to be but rather a Prospect of worse they form'd one of the most desperate and difficult Designs among themselves that for such a Handful of Men to undertake was ever heard of  viz  to force their Way back to their own Habitations Sword in Hand and to resolve to dwell there in Defiance of the Duke their Lord and Persecutor  The Duke had Notice of it and took all possible Precaution against it which added to the Difficulty for they had therefore in Consequence several Detachments of Forces to encounter in the Way besides the unsurmountable Difficulty of Want of Provisions Carriages Money or Troops and the exceeding Length and Roughnessof the Way  But all this did not discourage them from making the Attempt which they set on Foot with all the Secresie and executed with all the Vigour and Success imaginable so that the World are even surprized at the Relation of it which take as follows for it is well worth thy hearing  They had some Friends and the  Swiss  at least those Cantons professing the same Opinions in Religion wink'd at them if they did not assist them but the principal Encouragement they had was from the new King of  England  from whom it was said they received Livres to furnish them with Arms and Provisions encouraged with which Supplies and Hopes of greater Assistance they carryed on the Design with wonderful Secresie  The particular Number which was to have remov'd was actually three thousand as I have seen by their Lists but he that was to have paid their Money not having allowed them Time sufficient for such a Number there was not above half were ready against the Day prefixed for their Departure  Nevertheless the Design being blown Abroad about twelve hundred that were in a Posture to march resolved to stay no longer for Fear of meeting Obstacles in their Way To this Purpose they cross'd the Lake of  Geneva  in the Night unperceived by the  Savoyards  so that they had Time to get a Shoar to range themselves in Order of Battle and send four hundred Men to invest two Neighbouring Villages before they were discover'd upon this the  Savoyards  took the Alarm and were running to ring their Bells backward but being threatned with Fire and Sword they let them pass and furnished them with Necessaries for their Money they cross'd the River  Arva  without Molestation in regard they had been so wary as to send away a Detachment to make sure of the Pass but tho' they met with no Trouble at the Beginning they found enough  afterwards for the Courts of  Savoy  and  France  being informed of their Motion did all they could to stop them in several narrow and dangerous Passes thro' which they were obliged to force their Way however they surmounted all these Difficulties still cutting their Passage thro' their Enemies with the Edge of their Swords They endured the Brunt of four or five Skirmishes of which the sharpest was their Encounter with the Marquis of  Larre  who would needs put a Stop to them near a Place called  Salbertran  having along with him for that Purpose a Regiment of Dragoons and a good Number of the Militia nevertheless after a smart Conflict wherein they lost some Men they forc'd the Passage as they had done the rest the Marquis was mortally wounded several other Officers lost their Lives and above two hundred  French  Soldiers were slain Afterwards having vanquish'd all Opposition they arriv'd happily in their own Country from whence they chaced the old Catholicks but now Inhabitants and found great Plenty of all Things necessary for humane Support those of the Valley of  Pragelas  tho' Subjects of  France  and the new Converts received them with open Arms and now bring them whatever they stand in need of  After this several Bodies of them attempted to follow their Friends particularly one of Men but were so unfortunate as to be repulsed in several Skirmishes and obliged at last to retire  Sage Prince of sublime Thoughts thou wilt see here how far Zeal carries the Professors of any Religion whether true or false to push even to Desperation and Death according to a famous Expression of an  English  Writer who  was well known to have as much Wit and as little Religion as any of the modern Profligates of his Time as follows  Zeal makes Men fight like mad or drunk  For Dame Religion as for Punk  With how much purer Flame does the Zeal of the Faithful burn which carries them on the Wings of sage Councils to undertake the greatest Actions Bless by thy Smiles illustrious Prince of Wisdom the Steps of all that are guided in the right Way and ever direct the Zeal of true Believers to act with Vigour for the Honour of God and his great Prophet  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  The End of the FIRST BOOK  A

we can be capable of receiving the full Stream of the Joys of Paradise Believe me  Mustapha  the Soul as now contracted in an embody'd State is no more capable of the Joys of Paradise without a Change

of my approaching Bliss I am scarce able to know whether I am in a State of Life or a State of eternal Possession if the Extasie is so penetrating and so forcible that I sometimes know not whether I am awake or in Sleep embody'd or unembodied to what Height of Rapture may a farther Vision of the shining Vale carry me and why may not this Ferment of the Soul thrust it forcibly out of the Body as a Cask of Wine bursts the strongest Bands for want of Vent and tho' hoop'd with Iron cannot be kept within its former Limits or as dilated Air bursts even the fiercest Mountains on the fortuitous Meeting of the sulphurous and nitrous Particles in which it was imprisoned  Believe me  Mustapha  the Joy I conceive at my approaching Remove is often too great for me to contain sometimes it vents it self in Exclamations of Joy sometimes in the most frantick Gestures of a Lunatick sometimes it breaks out at the Eyes and abates its weighty Pressure in a Flood not Tears of Grief but of inexpressible Exultation It is impossible to describe to thee the waking Visions and the sleeping Discourses I have of these things I talk all the Night to the Angels of  Eden  to the Porter at the Gate of the wondrous Grotto and to the enlighten'd Spirits inhabiting the eternal Mansions of Paradise I durst not let any Servant of this Country sleep near me least he should hear me bless the exalted Prophet and praise the Gates of  Mecca  in my Nocturnal Transports  When I am awake I am still in Vision I dream walking every distant Prospect every remote View of the pleasant Hills which this Country abounds with represent Paradise the Hill of Joy the ascending Turrets of  Adonizuna  the Mountains surrounding the Plains of Blessedness and the Valley of unutterable Pleasure In a Word  Mustapha  I am all Rapture all Extasie and it is impossible for me to hold more Joy till  Mahomet  inspires me with new Capacities and forms my Soul into a new and more extended Mould  In the mean time I'll tell thee from Experience that 'tis the most unhappy Part of Life to be without a Friend to unbosome the Secrets of the Soul to Joy and Grief are in themselves Passions too strong for humane Nature to restrain the embodied Man is not equal to their Bulk and can hold but a small part of  them if he is oblig'd to keep them in the narrow Bounds of his own Thoughts and has no Liberty to give them vent by the Tongue they will stifle and overwhelm even Life it self must sink under the Weight and the Soul would hasten the nearest way thro' that Abyss to pass to the Regions of Light of which she her self is a Native  The Philosophers here entertain us with Scruples concerning the Soul's passing the infinite inconceivable Space which we call Abyss being the Gulph plac'd between Time and Eternity and from thence argue themselves into Notions as absurd in Philosophy as those they have in Religion and as that of a Plurality or Family of Gods after they have told us how far the celestial Constellations of Light move from one another that even the Planets are some of them to Millions of Miles from this lower Planet the Earth and that yet they are far nearer to us than they are to the lowest of the other fix'd Stars above them that those other fix'd Stars are still placed in advanced Stations above one another every Stage infinitely distant from one another in Space the Vacancies of which Abyss afford Space sufficient for the mighty Commets which moving in Parabolas and Excentrick uncertain or at least unknown Motions make Revolutions which 'tis difficult to ascertain and therefore fill the World with Terror at their Appearances and perhaps are reserved as the Instruments of the general Conflagration as some one or more of them certainly was of the general Inundation or Flood if such a thing may obtain our Belief of which  Moses  the Lawgiver of the  Jews  gives  the Story I say after they have told u these things they would start a doubt how the Souls of Men at their being dismiss'd from the Prison of the Body pass this infinite Abyss of Space how they are conveyed and how directed in their Journey where no Track can guide the way and in what Space of time they perform the celestial Journey seeing they tell us that the Distance is so great that a Velocity of Motion swift as a Ball from a Cannon would not perform the Labour in a Million of Ages  All these Enquiries and suggested measurings of Space Motion and Time have a Tincture of those horrid Crimes of Atheism and Scepticism for which these  Nazareens  are as eminent as infamous and in which they encrease every Day  To a Soul rightly grounded in Truth and unerring Doctrines it is easie to conceive that the Soul of Man being a divine Infusion is capable of inconceivable Transitions that its Motion swift as the Light or as Thought is no sooner broke loose from the Prison but it is enthroned in the Paradise of God and that without any Solicism in Philosophy or Imposition upon our Understandings  How this is perform'd illuminated sage Guide of the Faithful is as needless as it is impossible to know  Mahomet  shall at once teach us the full System and draw the Curtain of Darkness from our Eyes the Moment that we arrive at the Port of Bliss when we shall look back upon the immense Gulph we shall have pass'd and wonder no more that some things were concealed from us before which were more easie to be done than for us to conceive of  Partake of my Joy thou Mirror of Perfection and expect me at the appointed Time to accompany thee to the Gates of the holy City If our destinated Hour approaches before let us meet it with Joy as being the much shorter Step to the Banks of  Abathrea  the River of Solace where we shall commune of supernatural things for ever till then I embrace thy Shadow with Raptures inconceivable  Paris  th of the st Moon of the Year  LETTER II To  Mahomet Tershekkah  Vizier  Azem  INvincible illustrious Prince of the Viziers Bassa of the Bassaes Beglerbeg of the Beglerbegs Head of the Councils in the sublime Divan of the Grand Seignior Leader of the faithful Armies and Guide of the Empire of the Mussulmen I prostrate my self at the Feet of our Prophet  Mahomet  to obtain his Blessing and Prayers on all thy Undertakings and I congratulate thy Glory in thy early vigorous Conduct against the Enemies of the  Ottoman Sultan  whose Days be ever prosperous and his End happy  I send thee herewith an Account of the Fate of the Duke of  Lorrain  one of the greatest Enemies of the  Ottomans  and one to whom Heaven for our Sins gave leave to triumph over the Troops of thy great Predecessors  Hassan Kara  and  Ibrahim  on several Occasions which be for ever forgotten and the Memory of them blotted out of the Book of  Jatub  where are register'd the Wars of the Empire ever happy and in whose Place be recorded the Victories obtained by thy Sword fortunate and invincible  This Duke of  Lorrain  follow'd by great Armies and taking the Advantage of the Cloud of Displeasure which it was God's Will should for some Years hang over the Kingdoms of the Grand Seignior on the Side of the River  Danube  obtained some Advantages against the Faithful forsaken at that Time of the Protection of  Mahomet  and made his Name terrible among the Infidels by the taking from us howbeit not till after infinite Slaughter of his Men and a most glorious Defence the City of  Buda  which be recovered immediately by thy Hand  He was now drawn out of that War against us that he might with a Fury needful against an Enemy so dangerous defend the Dominions of the  German  Empire against the Attacks of the  French  who daily made Inrodes into the Country and threaten'd the Destruction of the whole This great Man for he really merited that Name among all the Leaders of Armies of whom none in this Part of the World came near him in Character or rather in Success for Success does not always follow the greatest Merit I say this great Man is at length laid level with his Inferiors in the Dust for the Grave knows no Dignity  Take the History of his Death in a few Words for it was brief Death used no Ceremonies with him He had for some time had a Defluxion or Rheum in his Breast occasioned by a violent Cold gotten in passing some Mountains in his Return from the Frontiers on the  Rhine  where he had been to take Care of the Emperor's Affairs and put all things in a Disposition for opening the Campaign or at least for opposing the  French  Armies who generally made their first and greatest Effort in the second or third or at least the fourth Moons before the  Germans  could be gotten in the Field  But it was needful for him to go back to  Vienna  to assist in the Councils of War and to  concert there more effectually the Operations of the War He was arrived within a few Leagues of the Emperor's Court namely at a Village called  Wells  near  Lintz  on the  Danube  when his Cold encreasing he found a Swelling in his Throat which grew so much as to impostumate and turn to what their Physicians here call a  Quinzy  and this came on him with such Violence that notwithstanding the Place was inconvenient and not capable of entertaining him he was obliged to stop not being able to stir a Step farther In a Word in that obscure Village he finish'd the Course of what vain Men here call a Life of Glory and Victory that is in plain Truth a Life of Blood and of the destroying his FellowCreatures for as War is the Plague of Heaven cast upon Men by the Displeasure of God These we foolishly call Heroes what are they but bloody Men commanded by the irrevocable Decree to fulfil what in Wrath has been predestinated to be inflicted upon the Nations of the Earth  But to return to the Duke he found his End draw on apace and herein he shewed more of the Hero than in the greatest Victories he gain'd for 'tis allowed on all Hands that he received the first Summons of Death with a Steadiness of Mind equal to those  Romans  of old who esteemed Death no other than a shaking Hands with the Gods In a Word glorious Prince this Duke wanted nothing in Life or in Death but to have been numbred among the Faithful to have been a true Believer in the everlasting Law and a Servant to the Grand Seignior  He met Death with an undaunted Heart and tho' the Distemper was so violent as to allow him very little Intervals from the Convulsions of Death and but a very few Moments of time having seized upon the Passages of the  Thorax  and deprived him of the Use even of his Lungs except with violent Heavings and insupportable Pangs for Breath yet he applyed himself immediately to the Point of dying with an unusual Alacrity He first sent for a Priest or Dervice whom they call here a Confessor for to such these  Nazareens  apply in such Cases and disburthening their Consciences as they call it confess to them all their Sins and then think these poor Creatures wicked like themselves can absolve and forgive them foolish Notion as if any but God against whom our Offences are committed could wipe out that Account which Souls must give to their Maker which if true then had those wicked Creatures Power to license the committing all manner of Crimes  When his Confessor came as above he found him silent for his Speech was stopt by the Bulk of the Impostumation so he took a Pen and Ink and wrote his Confession which he intended to make which the said Priest read aloud to him in private and then put into the Fire in his Presence for 'tis their Maxim that what is delivered in Confession is sacred and never to be divulged nay some have gone the Length as to say that if a Man in Confession declar'd he intended to assassinate his Prince the Priest must not divulge it no tho' doing so would save the Life of the Person For which devilish Doctrine one whole Society of these Dervices called Jesuits were expell'd  France  after the Murther of the two  Henries  The Duke having finished his Confession he in the next Place received the chymerick Absolution I have just now mentioned from the Hands of his Priest together with the Viaticum or the Sacrament  as they call it  of extreme Unction which in a Word they call here the last Office of the Church and making Peace with God This being over and perceiving his End hastily approaching he wrote a Letter to the Emperor wherein after he had testify'd his Sorrow for being no longer able to serve him he recommended his Wife and all his Family to his imperial Care He wrote another to the Princess his Lady to comfort her for her Loss which two Letters he gave to his Confessor with Orders to deliver 'em immediately after his Death After which the Imposthume that was in his Throat bursting within Side stifled him so that he expired in the Arms of his Confessor the  th  of the  th  Moon in the Evening  He was born in the Year at  Vienna  and was christen'd  Charles Leopold Nicolas Sixtus  He was born of  Francis Nicolas  who had been first a Cardinal but by a Dispensation from the Pope married  Claudia  of  Lorrain  his CousinGerman His Uncle  Charles  III had married  Claudia  's eldest Sister by whom he had no Children but while his first Wife lived who died not till the Year he contracted a second Marriage with  Beatrice d'Cusance  Widow of  Eugenius Leopold  Prince of  Cante Croix  by whom he had  Charles Henry  Prince of  Vaudemont  and  Anne  the Wife of  Julius  Count of  Lislebonna  the Duke of  Lorrain  of whom I  now speak married in the Year the ArchDutchess  Eleonora Maria d' Austria  the Emperor's Sister and Widow of  Michael  King of  Poland  by whom he had Children which being very young are not yet in a Condition of themselves to recover the Dutchy of  Lorrain  which is their lawful Inheritance  'Tis not yet known who will be declared Generalissimo of the Emperor's Forces but the Prince of  Baden  will return into  Hungary  to command the Imperialists unless his present Sickness hinders him  Every Body that considers the Consequences of this Duke's Death must acknowledge that the Emperor had better have lost Ten Thousand Men for how great a General soever he may have still remaining on that Side it may be said there is not one that has that Expertness that Experience that Authority that Credit and Love of the Soldiers which the Duke of  Lorrain  had insomuch that all the Princes of  Germany  willingly gave way to him and in Regard he was a Prince poor and distressed there was no Body jealous of him but they were still glad of the good Success which generally attended his Arms whereas on whomever else the Emperor cast his Eyes to confer upon him the Command of his Armies he cannot so well order it but that it must breed Jealousies among several of the Princes and the greatest Part of the rest of the Generals there is not any one that has Authority sufficient to make himself equally obey'd by so many different Nations as compose the imperial Army and who have every one their Chieftain that pretends to be independant and not obliged to receive Orders from any one whatever  Many and glorious be thy Days invincible and magnificent  Mehemet  many be thy Days and Peace be thy End be thy Felicities and Honours encreased and the Glory of the august Emperor of Monarchs and Lord of Princes be the Care of thy Head and prosper in thy Hand  Paris  th Day of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER III To  Amurath Zahabbezin  a proselyted  Jew  reconciled to the Doctrine of  Mahomet  THOU who hast been deliver'd from the Burthens of the apostate Nation must needs be also filled with just Indignation at the Superstitions and Heresies of thy People from whose Tabernacles thou hast taken thy Flight Verily  Amurath  it has never gone well with the  Jews  since they clogg'd the pure Law deliver'd to them by  Moses  and received by him from the Mouth of God with the Inventions and Delusions of Men  Prithee tell me enlighten'd  Morat  what hodge podge of a Constitution will the  Jews  bring their Religion to at last they have already blended the Explanations and Expositions of Men in such a gross manner with the positive Law of God that it is hard for any that have not critically studied the Constitutions of the Mount to know one from the other  I have read over very attentively the Pentateuch or Books wherein the Law of  Moses  is contained and must tell thee had the  Jews  adhered stedfastly to the Letter of that Law and not mixed with it their several Innovations which they would have call'd by the Name of Interpretations they had certainly been the People of God to this Day or until the  Shiloth  of old Father  Israel  had come and whether he  be already come or yet to come I find they are hard put to it to determine  But be the Messiah who is doubtless meant there by  Shiloh  and in other Places of their Prophet called by other Names come or not come about which I purpose to write to thee hereafter it is most certain that the  Jews  have in a most egregious Manner prophaned and corrupted the first Institution of their Law and there is no Wonder that when the Prophet of the Christians Jesus the Son of  Mary  came among them this was the great thing for which he reproached them and charged their Scribes and Pharisees with Hypocrisie It is certain that it was for this that they were implacably bent to destroy him and that they abhor his Name and Memory to this Day But also 'tis most certain that they were convinc'd that he had too much Reason on his Side to be opposed that they really had taught for Doctrines the Commandments of Men and had destroyed the Law by mixing with it their corrupt Traditions and Sayings of the Elders  Had not the  Jews  thus degenerated from the first Institutions of God's Law exhibited by  Moses  doubtless  Mahomet  and all the Empire of the faithful Mussulmen had been  Jews  to this Day The Caliphs of the  Arabian  Empire who were the justest and meekest Men upon Earth would have faithfully followed the Divine Influence and have worship'd God in that way which he so evidently delivered from Mount  Sinai  and as they had no Faith in the Messiah  f  he  Christians  as to his being the Person who the Writings of the Prophets had foretold should come they would most certainly have continued  king in all the Ways of God and of his Prophet  Moses  to this Day or till some Revelation  from Heaven of the true Messiah's being come should have wrought upon their Minds to know when the Promises made of him were fulfilled  But this Degeneracy of the  Jews  encreasing and besides having led them as Delusions naturally do to all manner of Neglect of the Commands of God has given Rise to all the Variety of Abominations which have appear'd among that profligate People to this Day  Hence the Doctrine of the  Nazareens  and hence the pure Rules of our glorious  Mahomet  have taken the Rise of their Epocha in the World for were we to suppose them or either of them not to be of divine Institution Heaven forbid such Prophaneness yet it might very reasonably be expected that when the People of the Nations round them saw the Laws of God thus confounded with the Devices of Men and the People by consequence deviated into all manner of Wickedness they would rightly conclude that either the Law was fulfill'd and the divine Institution terminated and so they ought to seek out the Ways of Truth as Heaven should direct them or that some terrible Judgment from Heaven would attend the People who had so degenerated that they would be removed from th  Face of the Earth and some new and gloriou  evelation would be given of the further Mind of God the great Legislator of the World  Both these Events are certainly come to pass and the  Jews  are manifestly cast out of the Fold as wicked and corrupted Creatures degenerated Plants having forfeited the Care of him who first watered and cultivated them who they have voluntarily rejected and despised  Happy be thy Days enlighten'd Convert who art broken loose from the Bondage of Hypocrites and hast detected the Fraud of electing an Oral Law in the Throne of the divine Revelation Thou art come into the Family of the Blessed even of those who first in the most effectual manner drew the Sword of Justice in the Cause of God against the manifest Delusions of Men set up in Rebellion to his Commands  For know thou that the Successors of our great Prophet  viz  the Saracenical Caliphs were the Men who in the Name of God drove the Rabbinical Impostors from  Babylon  the Seat of the  Jewish  Innovations where the Talmud and the Collections of their Innovations and Errors were first made and from whence the  Gemara  or great Mass of Traditions being a Comment upon the more ancient Misna which they would have called the Oral Law of  Moses  obtained the Name of  Babylonian  I say the  Arabian  Caliphs and  Saracen  Powers the immediate Successors of our great Prophet scattered these collected Mischiefs and the Blow given to the  Jewish  Impostures has never yet been recovered or ever will be while the World endures for God the Author of Truth abhors the Mixtures of humane Traditions with his divine Institutions much more when they are injuriously placed in a wicked Usurpation over his own Laws  From this Conquest of  Babylon  by  Abu Obeid  the great Captain of the  Saracens  the  Jews  may reckon the Epocha of their more effectual Desolation and of their being scattered over the whole World in which dispers'd Condition as it often happens they have neither preserv'd the Law no nor the Talmud it self from farther  and greater Innovations and Corruptions which by the way is agreeable to what these  Nazareens  say of them  viz  that they should be given up to strong Delusions to believe a Lye that they all may be damn'd  I salute thee humble  Morat  who in search after these things hast learned the Truth and delivered thy self from the Errors of wicked Men Peace be to them who cleave to Truth and prosperous be the Hands of those who build upon the Foundation of the Faithful  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER IV To  Mohamed Elmakem  Student in History at  Trapezond  THOU knowest little of the Scituation of Affairs on this Side of the World and less of my Circumstances in this Place that thou hast written to me to furnish thee with Materials for thy learned Enquiry into the Antiquities of the East and supply thee with Particulars for the History of the Empire of the  Saracens  which I understand thou art compiling  Hadst thou written to me to supply thee with the nicest and most particular Accounts of the  Roman  and  Grecian  Empires this is the fittest Place at this Time in the World for such an Enquiry the Learning of this Age applying themselves and that with a great and just Applause to those Studies to which also they find great Assistance among those Writers which they call the Classicks  But for the Eastern Learning tho' it is it self the Beauty of all Study and would furnish matter for innumerable Histories of the greatest Actions in the World much greater than furnished the Song of  Homer  or the Commentaries of  Julius Caesar  yet it is in it self so remote that the  Arabick  Tongue in which all those things are to be found is so sunk out of Knowledge in these Parts of the World and the getting the Tracts that are extant in it is so exceeding difficult that indeed the Enquiry after it is as good as dropt and Men  are backward to enter into a Study which seems lock'd up from humane Enquiries or at least fortified with so many Retreats and inaccessible Darknesses that it is scarce to be attempted  As the Wars of the  Arabians  are a Story filled with infinite Variety and that Nation had been for many Ages the bravest the most aspiring to and the best fitted for glorious Actions of any People in the World so Arts and Sciences and all sorts of Learning flourished in the  Arabian  Kingdoms even before the rest of the World had either learned the Methods of Instruction or had any Sense of the Blessing of it  Acquired Knowledge seems to have had its first Rise in that Country the Climate favoured by Heaven with all that could make a Country pleasant and agreeable deservedly gained for the Country the Title of  Felix  The Inhabitants breathed an Air that assisted Nature beyond Expression in forming a People for great things perfect Health invigorating Juices in the Fruits of the Earth and innumerable Helps from natural Causes prepared the People for the generous Principles the Fortitude and the Gallantry of true Heroes they seem'd fit to undertake things more than humane and yet appeared capable of every thing they undertook  In Study they outdid Nature they searched into her very Bowels and disclosed her most concealed Parts they master'd all kinds of Astronomical Mathematical Anatomical and Astrological Knowledge Wisdom seemed to be born of them and the most exquisite Accomplishments of the Soul became common and familiar as if it had been the natural  Genius of the Country As they had in their Temper the greatest Application to Learning so they had in their Minds the greatest Capacities to attain it They had the brightest Parts the clearest Heads and the devoutest Hearts of any Nation in the World  In their common Conduct they had the Beauties of Behaviour and the most correct Attachment to every moral Virtue and besides all this they had joined to the height of a martial Genius the softest meekest Dispositions in the World as they were in the Field all Fire so they were in the Family all Phlegm a manly Humility shone in the Characters of their greatest Caliphs and a generous Clemency was the very natural Produce of the highest Birth  From them the World learned Knowledge all liberal Arts all Studies of Science began with them they were the Men who gave Names to the Stars discover'd the Motions of the heavenly Bodies and which is yet a more sublime Study found out the Influences of the planetary World and how the heavenly Bodies govern this Globe and reign in all the particular Classes of vegetative sensitive and rational Life  From them the  Ptolomaian  Astronomers gathered the first Rudiments of their great System of Celestial Motions from them the  Aesculapian  deriv'd the Fundamentals of Physical and Anatomical Knowledge  Job  if the  Jews  have preserved an authentick Account of that eminent  Arabian  and the Book called by his Name which was found in the Archives of the Sons of  Isaac  may be depended upon surpassed all the Students in  Astronomy in Physicks or Metaphysicks which have since his Time been seen in the World  Even the  Jews  themselves the Rabbins and the greatest Men among them had but little Knowledge in any other sort of Science than the meer Study of their own Law and the Disquisitions of necessary things relating to their Sanhedrim and Court of Justice till they came to converse with the learned  Arabians  From them they received the first Introductions in Science and the Love of the most excellent Parts of Knowledge such as the Study of Philosophy the Mathematicks and especially the Study of Nature  It is true there is a great Variety of critical Study among those Rabbins and they discovered themselves to have among them Men of bright Parts aspiring Thoughts and clear and exquisite Judgments but as above it was wholly taken up in the Study of their own Law solving Difficulties in the Interpretation of their particular Cases of Judicature and settling Points of Conscience in the Conformity to Ceremonial Institutions  But even  Moses  himself when any thing is spoken of his Learning it speaks of it as borrowed He  was learned in all the Wisdom of the Aegyptians  and this Wisdom or Learning of the  Aegyptians  was also received from the  Arabians  with whom the most ancient Knowledge of the Sciences is to be found  Search then  my Friend  the ancient Libraries the Monuments and Records of the  Arabians  if thou wouldest learn any thing of the Eastern Antiquity with them even long before the coming of our Prophet was treasur'd up an infinite Variety of humane Wisdom and Knowledge and since the Time of  Mahomet  under the Caliphs and Princes of the  Saracens  the politest Learning of those Days has flourished in their Dominions their more ancient Conquests spread the glorious Light of heavenly Wisdom over the Eastern World and they afterwards brought the Rudiments of Philosophy into the  Grecian  and  Roman  Countries  Among them were found the innumerable Tracts of History and all kinds of Learning which compleated  Ptolomy  's Library in which it is said were to be found Seventy Thousand Volumes and from those Manuscripts innumerable Copies were handed continually forward into other Parts of the World till that glorious Collection was destroyed  Among the  Aegyptians  afterward the same Spirit of Magnanimity and Glory was preserved with the same Love of Litterature and the same Genius for Art and Sciences during the fortunate Government of the  Mamalukes  till they with the whole Eastern World sunk under the invincible Arm of  Sultan Selym  who God appointed to be Lord of the whole Earth  Here then apply thy self for Materials for thy well designed Collection Go to the Banks of  Cuthur  and to the Society of devout Emirs who dwell on the miraculous Plain they will lead thee to the Cave where are the Seven Hundred Tables of Brass on which are written with a Pen of Adamant with molten Gold the illustrious Histories of the  Arabian  Princes for Four and fifty Ages before the  H gyra  of  Mahomet  's going to Heaven began  There thou wilt find Materials for the brightest History that was ever extant in the World the Priests of  Mecca  who attend Day  and Night at the Tomb of our holy Prophet will let thee into the sacred Mysteries and inform thee of every thing meet to be known for the propagating thy Work and making it the Wonder of all the succeeding Ages of the World  Light and Joy attend thy diligent Enquiry into Truth and mayest thou be fully rewarded in the exalted Heights of Paradise where Knowledge is perfect and Happiness compleat  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER V To the Kadileskar of  Natolia  IT is very seldom that I propose any of these  Nazareens  for an Example to the true Believers because they are here the greatest Hypocrites in the World Religion is made a meer Guise of Deceit and the Outside they put on to appear devout has ever some holy Cheat in it to draw in Fools or to buoy up the Spirits of the Commons to support with more Alacrity the heavy Loads they are to lay upon them It is a proverbial Saying of their own  When the Fox preaches  Guardez les Poules  beware of the Gueese  However as an Example of a Hypocrite may be recommended because the Outside of it is guilded over with the Sanctity of an Angel and the vile Design with which it is performed is concealed so I recommend to the Faithful the Practice of Religion without the Hypocrisie the Guise without the Disguise  The People of  Paris  are every thing the King pleases and tho' in themselves and following the Dictates of their own Inclination they are the gayest profuse and most debauch'd People alive yet all on a sudden a Fit of Religion having possess'd them they are all turned Pharisees and Recluses  The Alteration has something dismal in it for instead of an Air of inexpressible Levity  which was the Habit even of the whole Nation instead of eternal Dancing and Singing even as they walk along the Streets and scarce restrained even in the Churches instead of all the Gallantry of Dress and the coquettry of Ribbons Patches and Paintings instead of innumerable Coaches in the Walks of the Thulleries the Grand Tour and the Park at  Versailles  instead of Songs new Tunes new Dances new Opera's and the constant Noise of Musick This City is all on a sudden turned into a Collection of Cells of Hermits or Houses of Recluses if the Women go abroad 'tis all  en des habille  mussled up as if they were veil'd and instead of the Tour to the Gardens of the  Loure  'tis only now away to the Mosque to say their Mattins and their Vespers and directly home again the Pages and Servants hurry up and down all over the Town to the Booksellers Shops to buy Books of Devotion and Religion so that they are scarce to be had and the Price exceedingly risen all other Writings may be turned to waste Paper for no Body buys them instead of singing and dancing as they go along Streets the Breast all unbutton'd the Hat under the Arm and the Face covered with Smiles and Joy the Beaus now walk with the Hat pull'd over their Eyes their Cloths button'd close up to the Chin and the Neckcloth tuckt close in to the Wastcoat or Vest they look grave walk softly talk seriously and study to be dull  The PublickHouses Cabarets or Taverns look as if they were broke the Opera's the MusickMeetings and the GamingOrdinaries are shut up nothing open but the Churches The fine Walks and Gardens at the King's  Houses in the City where the infinite Numbers of Coaches Ladies and Burghers Daughters used to be surprising now they are all empty the Women are all upon their Knees in the Churches and Chappels or performing their Hours as they call them in the Convents and religious Houses where they visit the Nuns and talk all of Religion As for Coaches Dress Servants fine Liveries and all gay things they are laid by and the People that made the shining Splendor of the  French  Court be the Glory and Envy of  Europe  live now all retir'd see no Company pay no Visits and talk of retreating from the World nay many of them go out of Town every Day to their CountrySeats tho' it be at the Time of Year that every Body uses to come to Town While the Gentry are in this State of Humiliation the inferior sort of People have a real Cause for it They mourn in earnest for Trade which is here in a manner wholly supported by the Luxury of the most extravagant People in the World is quite sunk in this Alteration The Perriwigmakers the Perfumers the ToyShops the Taverns the Assemblies for Play the Milleners the LaceShops the Weavers of Silks and Ribbons the Mercers the Drapers the Taylors and a Thousand Trades depending upon these alas they are all undone and they walk about their Shops wringing their Hands and tearing their Hair from their Heads  for they wear no Beards here  as Men undone and ruined their Trade being gone and their Livelihoods taken away all on a sudden their Wives sit behind the Counters all in Tears no Body comes to buy fine Cloths are all useless and of no Esteem no Body wears them if a Gentleman  should powder his Wig or a Lady appear in Dress it would look like a  Swiss  or like one that came a great way out of the Country to be sure it would be presently said they had no Business at Court they were People of no Fashion or they did not understand themselves In a Word the Countenance of the merriest Nation upon Earth is on a sudden chang'd into that of the mournfullest and heaviest Generation of Mankind and they look as if the City was just visited with the Pestilence and they afraid to speak to one another for Fear of Infection  One would think the old  Arabian  Prophet  Jonah  had been here on the same Errand that he was sent to  Nineveh  and having told them  Paris  should be destroyed within Forty Days the People were all upon their Penetentials for their Sins  And what's the Matter all this while Is it real Devotion Is the Humour of the Nation changed Are the People really become religious nothing like it 'Tis all a Mimick a meer Piece of Statemanagement The King led the Way and appeared devout and as it were shut up in his Closet which they say is upon the Occasion of the great Prospect of War and Devastation of Countries and Nations Burnings of Cities and shedding of Blood which as they pretended must fall as a Judgment from Heaven upon the King's Enemies the ensuing Year  It is true this is all grimace nor do the wiser sort pretend to talk much of that kind but they say the last Year having been a Year of Glory and Success to the King tho' surrounded with infinite Enemies it has all been procur'd by the exemplary Devotion  and Piety of the King who has for some time given himself up to Fastings Prayers innumerable Masses Works of Mortification Abstinence from Pleasures and the like and that therefore his best Subjects will follow the same Method and thereby secure a prosperous State of things for the Time to come  By the Tomb of  Mahomet  and all the holy Men whose Ashes surround the Entrance of the Circle of Sanctity in  Mecca  these  Nazareens  are the grossest Hypocrites in the Universe for at the same Time that this Mask of Humiliation is put on all the Intreagues imaginable are carried on to embroil in War all the Courts and Princes of  Europe  Thou art not ignorant sublime Judge of Equity and Uprightness what infinite Violences they commit in all Parts of the World at the same time that they pretend to weep and mourn for the Calamities of Mankind the History of these things lying daily in thy Sight thou canst not but see through the Mask of Devotion they put on  A flagrant Instance of it also is before thee in the daily Sollicitations of the  French  Ambassador at the Port to encourage the  Ottoman  Ministry to carry on the War against the  Nazareen  Emperor and prevent the Projects of Peace that were on Foot Thou art Witness there to the Intreagues they carry on and the Assistances they give for the  Ottoman  Forces of Engineers and Gunners and some Money if they do not belie their own Councils to hasten on the Preparations and make the Continuance of the War inevitable  On the other Hand I am Witness here to the secret Joy with which they entertain the News of the Grand Vizier's Successes on the Frontiers the Victory of  Nissa  and the taking the Town The surprizing Recovery of  Belgrade  and the like nay some People here suggest that the City of  Belgrade  was betray'd to us and the Count  Aspremont  a Native of  France  being Governour the Magazines were blown up by his secret Contrivance that the Mussulman's Army might enter Sword in Hand and the Conquest be secured and all this that it being a Blow which could not fail to put the imperial Affairs into the utmost Consternation might occasion a necessary Diversion of the  German  Troops as well from the Empire as from  Italy  where the King of  France  was resolved to push the Duke of  Savoy  with his utmost Strength and who if not supported by the  Germans  must at last be obliged to change Sides and submit to  France  While these Steps are taking while the King of  France  stoops to confederate secretly with the  Ottomans  who at the same Time they pretend to call the common Enemy of Christendom and who they make it a Piece of Conscience to act against upon all Occasions as Infidels and People who they ought not to wish Success to no not against the greatest of their Enemies I say while they profess such things as these and practise in secret the very Reverse of it what Sincerity can there be in all the Outside of their Humiliation and pretended Devotions  God who is one in the Unity of his Nature demands that we be one at all times in the Unity of our Practice The Faithful are  taught to know that God sees the Inside of our Imaginations and that he abhors the Mask of Devotion covering the Deceit of the Intention  Just Men act from just Principles and cannot meek the World with the Pageantry of Religion any more than they can mock the great One  Alla  the God of pure and perfect Uprightness with a double  Entendre  in their Services  We shall see this Fit of Devotion be all over in a little while and the Tyger will sit rampant upon the King of  France  's Councils when perhaps in the Beginning of the Campaign he shall give Orders for the Burning and destroying the fruitful Countries on the Frontiers on the Pretence of preventing his Enemies Armies subsisting there  Blessed be the righteous Desires of the Believers who walk in strait Paths doing Justice and keeping their Eyes to the Gates of  Eden  replenished with Joy and crowning the Pleasures of the Just  Paris  th of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER VI To  Morat Husain Abdeilomar  Caimacham of  Constantinople  IT belongs to thee happy  Morat  that keepest the Gates of the illustrious Port the City of Joy within whose Walls dwells the mighty the resplendent Mirror of Glory the King of Emperors whose Days be multiplied and his Felicity endless it belongs to thee I say to hear how the great Cities of the World behave when the prosperous Arms of their Princes bring Triumph to their Gates  Contrary to the Expectation of Enemies nay even to the Surprize of the Court it self every Patt of the  French  Frontiers has furnished some Subject of Triumph to the King of  France  this past Year they have been overwhelmed with Joy on all Sides which is indeed the more welcome because they were not without Apprehensions of the Superiority of their Enemies almost on all Sides  The first of the Year saluted them with a compleat Victory at  Fleuri  on the Banks of the  Sambre  the Month of  June  with a Victory at Sea The  French  Navy the most formidable that ever one single Power could boast of since the Use of Ships of War was known attack'd and defeated the united Fleets of  England  and  Holland  and burnt stranded and took Seven Men of War from to Guns each on the Coast of  England  After this they landed some Men on the same  Coast and burnt and plundered several Villages In  Italy  where it was thought the Duke of  Savoy  had been so well supported by his Allies that he would have been superior to the  French  he has been attack'd by the Mareschal  de Catinat  an old and experienc'd General and in a great Battle overthrown near  Sallusses  in  Piemont  of his Men slain Prisoners with all his Cannon Baggage and Colours taken and the Duke himself narrowly escaping  This Battle has been so important tho' the Action it self was not great that the Court are not able to conceal their Joy and the King himself was heard to say he valued it more than the two other Victories of the Year  viz  that of  Fleuri  and that at Sea  And he has Reason to do so for as the War in  Savoy  was more expensive to the King being at so great a Distance and carried on with more Resentment on either Side so the King was infinitely more desirous to bring it to a Conclusion that he might turn his Arms another way more to his Advantage and which was greater still the King had more to fear on that Side than on any other if his Enemies should get the Advantage of his Troops  But he has now effectually secur'd his Dominions on that Side and his Army continues to ravage the Country to deprive the Duke of  Savoy  of subsisting his Army they have also taken  Saluzzes Savigliane  and several other important Posts from the Duke of  Savoy  as the Consequences of that Victory and in Close of the Year all the Dutchy of  Savoy  except the Fortress of  Montmellian  and the Town of  Suza  fell into the Hands of the  French  so  that unless the Emperor supports the Duke of  Savoy  with a very strong Power he will be reduced to very narrow Circumstances in a little Time  On the  Rhine  the Confederates boasted of great Attempts to be made of breaking into the Heart of  France  and the like particularly it was said the Duke of  Bavaria  who commands the Army since the Death of the Duke of  Lorrain  would bring an Hundred Thousand Men into the Field but the  Dauphine  whose Army was never above Men has defended the Frontiers and in his Turn passed the  Rhine  and subsisted his Army in the Plains of  Stollhoffen  at the Expence of the Enemies and yet has drawn off without fighting which is in it self a Victory  Thus all things concur to make the King of  France  triumph over his Enemies and he lives in the continual Clamour of Joy the Guns are ever firing for the good News which comes in from one Quarter or another and I sit in my little Retreat and laugh at the Madness of these Infidels who thus weaken and destroy one another leaving thereby an open Door of Victory to the Arms of the Grand Seignior whose Ways be prosperous and his Triumphs uninterrupted  Fortunate  Morat  let no Opportunity slip to push the Interest of the illustrious high Port and fail not to take all the just Advantages that the Dissentions of the Powers of the  Nazarcens  offer to thee these are the Times appointed by Fate for the Recovery of all the Territories of the Grand Seignior lost by the unhappy Conduct of the Vizier  Azem  when he made that fatal Attempt against  Vienna  when  Mahomet  was displeased and God was  angry and the Faithful turned their Backs and fled from the Face of their Enemies  At the latter End of the Moon  Rebliah  the second called here  April  the Death of the  Dauphiness  Wife to the eldest Son of the King of  France  died which having thrown the whole Court into Black lessen'd much of the Lustre which would have been seen here on the Occasions of the Victories I have mentioned But their Joy is not the less for their mourning Outsides seeing this is a Nation that is not more eminent for any thing in the World than for seeming what they are not and being what they do not seem  Well be it with the true Believers who triumph in a Rectitude of Soul and always are bold to shew the Affection or Enmity which they entertain in their Breast whether it be Personal or National Dissimulation is the Effect of a Cowardice and Baseness of the Mind which renders it afraid to shew the Inside of the Heart God who abhors Hypocrisie can never be supposed without blasphemous Conceptions of his Nature to approve these  Nazareens  for Sincerity dwells not in them  May the Gates of Paradise stand open to thee and the Angel of the Vale receive thee with open Arms ready to transport thee to the Mount of Joy and open to thee the Mysteries of inconceivable Pleasure  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER VII To the Rutalier Aga chief Eunuch or Chief of the  Seraglio  THEY are greatly mistaken who think the Affairs of the Port have not their Influence on these Parts of the World where I dwell they who plac'd me here who are now shining in the Garden of Beauty had other Notions or they would not have obliged me to reside here so many Years  The happy Successes of the Grand Vizier in  Hungary  thereby opening a Way for farther Conquests to the Arms of the victorious  Ottomans  is acknowledg'd here to be the saving the King of  France  from the absolute Ruine which the Superiority of the  Germans  and their Confederates would have infallibly brought upon them and I infer from hence that whenever the perfect Wisdom of our mighty Emperor shall think fit to put an End to the Conquests he is making in  Hungaria  and consent to come to a Truce with these Infidels there is no Question but all the Powers of  Europe  who are now in Confederacy against  France  will put their helping Hand to such a Work and will join together their Endeavours to bring the Emperor of the  Nazareens  to yield to all the Demands of the Port that they may be at leisure to turn all their united Armies against this more dangerous Enemy the King of  France  who is now esteemed among them  as the common Enemy of what they call Christendom  In the mean Time the Language of the Infidels here is that the Mussulmen have once again gotten Fortune on their Side and perhaps  says one of their Authors here  may have found out the Secret to chain her so fast to their Vizier's Tent that she shall not make her Escape a second Time  I write these things to hint that ancient Maxim of  Caled  the great the first General to  Abbubeker Caliph  and immediate Successor to  Mahomet  in the Civil and Military Government I hint to thee his Maxim I say  viz That a Time of Victory is the Time to make Peace  The Reason is clear  for then  said he  you are sure to keep what you have gain'd and obtain what you ask  They talk here that the  English  and  Dutch  Ministers at the Port have Orders to concern themselves in the Names of their Masters to encline the Grand Seignior to Thoughts of Peace and offer to act as Mediators This is a Signal in deed  if true  of the weak Condition of the Emperor's Affairs 'tis no less than a white Flag hung out of a Town besieged to offer a Capitulation and surrender And I doubt not the Vizier will know how to make his Advantage of it  It is true  France  regarding her own Interest will oppose it with all her Might knowing that if the  Nazareen  Emperor concludes a Peace with the Port he will make no Peace with him But if I might be permitted to give my Judgment in so weighty a Case it is that the Port should weight her own Strength and Interest not forgetting to note that however the Port may regard  France  in carrying on the War  France  would  have no Regard to the Interest of the Grand Seignior if he was designing to clap up the War by a Peace but would rather assist the Emperor against the Mussulmen as they did at the Battle of  Raab  and as they did in the Case of the  Venetians  at the Siege of  Candia  things which the illustrious Port may happen to remember to them hereafter  Yeild to Peace then while Victory crowns thy Attempts O Man assisted by Heaven and let an End be put to shedding the Blood of the Faithful  Not that I fear for the Grand Vizier tho' they talk here loudly of the mighty Strength of the  Nazareen  Emperor and that he will have an Hundred Thousand disciplin'd Soldiers on Foot in  Hungary  this approaching Campaign but it cannot be rational to believe it If I may credit the vulgar Opinion in this Place Money is more difficult to be had in  Germany  than Men and the Emperor will be very sorely distress'd to raise Money for this double War if it holds another Campaign  His hereditary Dominions are terribly exhausted the Contingencies or Quota's of the Princes of the Empire which they call the  Roman  Months come in not only slowly but even not at all the smaller Princes only are those that pay any thing and the great ones nothing The first plead Poverty and the last Power giving trifling Reasons and haughty Answers without paying any Part of their Money to the military Chest or sending their Quota's of Men to the Army  Mighty Princes often think fit to put Bounds to their Conquests even when they have Power to extend them farther It is  sufficient that the Vizier has recovered to the  Ottoman  Empire the Banks of the  Sauve  and of the  Theiss  and that  Belgrade  and  Temeswaer  remain the invincible Barriers of our Empire As for the rest of  Hungary  it will be more an Expence than an Advantage to the  Nazareens  to keep it The  Hungarians  who hate the  Germans  being all Malecontents as well upon Religious as Political Accounts will be for ever raising Commotions weakening the Power and exhausting the Treasure of the Emperor till at length wasted by continual Factions that Kingdom will fall naturally into the Hands of the just Nation without fighting as it did before  Prosperous be the Days of the Emperor of the Just may his Head resplendent with Celestial Glory shine like the Stars and his Crown be a Constellation of Five Hundred Suns Joy be to thy exalted Soul dear  Achmethies  both here and in Paradise  Amen  Paris  th of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER VIII To the Kaimacham  I Have often given the Characters of the illustrious Men of these Parts of the World and have told thee that the King of  France  has the greatest and best Generals of the Age and it is most true the Duke of  Luxemburgh  in  Flanders  and Monsieur  Catinat  who acts against the Duke of  Savoy  are certainly two of the greatest Men this Age affords and Victory seems to attend every Action they take in Hand  But I am called off from such mean Characters if after what I have said of them they may be called mean I say I am called off from them to the rising Figure the new King of  England  makes in the World  I have often nam'd this Person to thee as  Prince of Orange  but being now stept up into the Chair of Majesty and mounted the  English  or rather  British  Throne his Power having thus encreased to an Equality with his martial Genius which indeed it was not before he begins to threaten  France  with such an Appearance in the Field as no Prince in  Europe  ever made before him  He has been in  Ireland  in Person where he pass'd a great River called the  Boyn  in the Face of a superior Army of the  French  and  Irish  and defeated them by plain fighting the Slaughter was not great but the Victory plain and confess'd by the Flight of that unfortunate Prince the Deposed King the d time to  France  who arrived here the latter End of the last Year  The victorious Prince pursuing the Course of his good Fortune has recover'd the most Part of the Kingdom of  Ireland  and leaving the rest to his Generals appears now at the  Hague  forming Alliances against  France  and his Designs seem to threaten the King of  France  that he will arm all the rest of  Europe  against him  It is incredible to hear how the Princes and States on all Sides caress him the Congress which he has formed at the  Hague  is what was  never seen in those Parts of the World He makes himself be adored by all the Powers of that Part of the World and tho' they dissemble their Apprehensions he is terribly feared by this Part  The haughty Spirit of the King indeed who knows not how to fear God or Man supports the  French  Nation and their natural Aptness to bluster makes them seemingly despise this Prince but it is easie to see the Consternation of their more reserv'd Thoughts They prepare for the War as if it was to be carried on after a differing Manner than it uses to be and in  Flanders  particularly as if they were to be more seriously attack'd there than elsewhere  They pick and cull their whole Army for the best Troops and the most active and enterprising Generals they new mount their Cavalry and do a Thousand things to encourage the Officers to behave well at the same time letting them know they are to expect hot Work that they must look for Blows and that nothing but superior Numbers and superior Courage will carry on the War on that Side  As for the King of  England  he is now at the  Hague  where as I have said he has form'd a Congress of the Princes of the Northern Parts of  Europe  who are arrived there in such Numbers either in Person or by their Ambassadors that it is worthy thy Remark the like not having happen'd in any Age where they concert a League or Alliance offensive as they call it of all their Powers against the single Power of  France  If this King of  France  can withstand this Confederacy  Europe  must be reduced under his Hand into one universal Monarchy  or Empire far exceeding that of  Charlemaign  It may be of use to thee and for the Service of our glorious Emperor the Grand Seignior to give thee some Account of this Congress There was assembled besides the King and Fourteen Noblemen of  Great Brittain  who he brought over with him for the Splendor of his new gained Dominions and besides the two Electors of  Bavaria  and  Brandenburgh  Five and Twenty Soveraign Princes having Estates and Dominions of their own such as the Landgrave of  Hesse Cassel  the Duke of  Brunswick Lunenburgh  the Duke of  Saxe Eysuach  the Duke of  Courland  and others of like Degree Fourteen Princes of great Houses but not themselves Soveraigns Generals all of them having Titles of Honour besides their military Character the  Dutch  high Admiral  Trump  the King of  Spain  's Governor of the  Spanish Netherlands viz  the Marquis  de Gastanaga  and the imperial General the Prince  de Commercy  Besides these there were a prodigious Train of Ambassadors Envoys Extraordinary and publick Ministers from other Princes States and Powers such as were too great or too remote to appear in Person and even from some that were present who were to remain when their Principals were gone The Account they give here of them is thus  Three from the Emperor Two from the King of  Spain  One from  Sweden  Two from  Denmark  Two from  Savoy  from the Electors of  Bavaria Brandenburgh Treves Mentz  and  Cologn  each Two from the Elector  Palatine  one from the Elector of  Saxony  one from the King and Republick of  Poland  one Two from the Landgrave of  Hesse Cassel  one from  the Bishop of  Munster  from the Dukes of  Hannover Lunenburgh Wolfembuttle  and  Zell  each one from the Duke of  Holstein  one and from the Cities of  Liege  and  Hamburgh  each one besides Agents from  Switzerland  the  Grisons Geneva  and  Neufchattel  I need not muster up to thee the Powers of these several Princes who art so well acquainted with the State of  Europe  but thou mayest understand that there being a general Unanimity in them all to unite against the growing Power of  France  every one of these entered into Measures and Agreements for some Proportion either in Money or Troops to support the Alliance and every one of them had some Pretensions upon  France  so that like the Assembly of the Birds they all pretended to pluck their respective Feathers out of the Plume wherewith the King of  France  has adorn'd himself  The Agreement of so great a Number of Princes and Powers will not be more wonderful to thee than it will be that  France  has gone on so long in a general Encroachment upon her Neighbours to such a Degree and for so long a Time till the whole World as we may say are aggrieved at her and yet never be opposed in a Body before The Reason is the Conduct of this Court has been so very subtle that the King has always found Means to disunite the Princes whom he had oppress'd and to break all the Measures laid at any time for concerting any Opposition to him so that he had them often in secret League with himself ready rather to oppose one another than to join in Measures to oppose him  Thou wilt doubtless expect to hear what the King of  France  is doing all this while and  what Prospect there is of his defending himself against so many powerful Adversaries As to the first as I hinted already they turn it all in publick to jest and ridicule They call the new King of  England Le Petit Prince d'Orange  and one of their scribbling Poets here has written a Satyr or Lampoon call'd the  Cavalcade  at the  Hague  wherein he pretends to give the Characters of all the Princes and great Persons of the Congress but his Work is so scurrilous and he treats Soveraign Princes with such Indecencies and such mean course Language that indeed the  French  Gentlemen themselves who to give them their due are a very mannerly Nation do not relish it  However at the same time that they treat the Notion of a grand Alliance against them with a Kind of Gayety and Contempt the King shews that he knows the Prince of  Orange  and that he is not in jest and accordingly he prepares to deal with him in earnest for his Army in  Flanders  will be in the whole the Garrisons included Men of which the Duke of  Luxemburg  who is to command them pretends on any Emergency he will be able to have Men in the Field ready for Battle  The Duke is a politick and a fortunate General but they say this of him that he never came but to one Battle with the Prince of  Orange  and then he was soundly beaten which was at the Battle of  Mons  at the Close of the last War with the  Dutch  of which I gave at that Time a full Account to  Solyman  thy illustrious Predecessor now an exalted Soldier of Praise in the Garden of Peace  Rejoice happy Prince in the Lustre of thy great Command and the Favour of the Sultan thy Lord the Mirror of humane Wisdom and the illustrious Emperor of the Faithful whose Days be fill'd with Joy and his End Triumph and inexpressible Glory  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER IX To  Hoganquin Zemel Atran  a Studier of Antiquity at  Zaabbachz  in  Arabia  THOU that art searching after ancient Knowledge how canst thou look into this Part of the World where Men know nothing but by a kind of Talmudical Knowledge receiving Error from their Fathers and handing it on to their Posterity with the loose Sanction only of their own Approbation so that all things are accepted as Truths because received from the past Generations  You ask me for a History of the ancient Gods whom the  Roman  Nations adored and how the Stars come to be sirnamed after the Deities they worship  I could give thee long Legends of Fables for the Original of the Gods some one way some  another as the Learning of the respective Ages those things were written in directed and as the several Authors who have written of such things have received them such as  Stephanus Philo Varro Arnobius Diodorus Siculus Plato  and many more too long to name  But if I may give thee my Opinion of these things it must be as I learnt them from the Leaves of the never fading Tree of  Aphelezma  on which the History of the World was written by the Angel of the Gate with a Pen of Adamant I say if I must give thee my Opinion it is that thou direct thy Prayers to  Mahomet  three Times a Day for Illumination and that thou shouldest be instructed in the everlasting Record that nothing past may be concealed from thee  Certainly the Introduction of Idols and Images to be worshiped by Men was begun by the evil Spirit of the Lake who to erase the Knowledge of the true One God built Houses and Families of Gods in Romance founded on Traditional Discoveries of things past  As this carried them back to the first Knowledge of things so it did also of Persons and as none could be more the Subject of their Inquiries than the first Men so upon the Fable of their Fame for Time makes mighty Stories dwindle into Romance they made no Scruple to form the Gods which they wanted to invent  From these Records which remain only in the sacred Repository of the Cave of Wonders I say from these Record of Traditions rise all the Gods they wanted they ascribed godlike things to Men gone before their  Memory and then conceiv'd of them as Gods on Account of their great Deeds  Thus they go back to the Beginning of Men and Saturn who is called the Father of all both Gods and Men was certainly no other than  Adam  the Primogenitor of the Creation to whom the whole Globe was given in Fee simple as Lord of the Soil  As  Adam  was the first  Saturn  so  Cain  appears to be the first  Jupiter Eve  was also called the Goddess  Rhea  and  Naamath Eve  's eldest Daughter and  Cain  's Wife was called  Venus Tubulcain  is the same they called  Vulcan  Nor is the Similitude of Sound yet worn quite out of the Words for taking away the Letters  Tu  from the Word and you find not much of any kind of Difference between  Bulcain  and  Vulcan  I know that succeeding Generations in Imitation of this first Nomination of Gods named also the Heroes of their own Ancestors by the same Names placing them in the Skies as Stars of Eminence and adored them as Gods but these are modern compared to the Original as above which I take to be the Work of the first Ages of Time  From the Tales which the  Antediluvians  as they call them here handed down to their Posterity came most of the Fables with which the Eastern Part of the World was so full some of which I find here in their ancient Poets and Historians such as  Homer Hesiod Ovid Cornelius Severus  and others for Example  From the building that great stupendious StairCase called the Tower of  Babel  the said Poets feigned the Story of  Pelion  upon  Ossa  or the Giants undertaking a War against the  Gods and throwing one Mountain upon another to assault Heaven which is admirably described by one of the said Poets thus  Tentavêre nefas olim detrudere mundo  Sydera Captivi{que}  Jovis  transferre Gigantes  Imperium victo leges imponere coelo  Cor Sev  Likewise from the authentick Histories of the Sons of  Noah  and their dividing the Earth among their Posterity came the Fable of dividing the World among the Three Brethren the Sons of  Saturn  The Fiction of the golden Fruit kept by the Dragon was taken from the Garden of  Eden  where was a forbidden Tree guarded by the divine Anathema  And as some tell us from the translating  Enoch  into Heaven was taken the Translation of Heroes and famous Men into Stars and celestial Signs and the like  Now if thou read the wondrous Manuscripts of the Ancients which thou wilt find treasured up in the miraculous Cave and collected with great Industry by the most ancient  Arabians  thou wilt find the full Confirmation of these Truths and just Reason to trace the Antiquity of the Heathen Fiction back to the first Age  Innumerable Similitudes will appear also if thou study  Moses  's written Law where thou wilt find the Custom of Kings and Conquerors making Leagues Covenants and Conventions confirmed by the Sanction of  Solomon  and mutual Sacrifices is borrowed from  Moses  who when he read the Covenant of God to the People sprinkled the Blood of the Sacrifice upon them  Wherefore then divine  Atran  doest thou turn thy Face this Way for the Intelligence of things ancient seeing the dispers'd Families of the Sons of  Noah  have not left the Eastern World without authentick Proofs of their Original and of the Customs of their Ancestors  I know the  Lybian  Fables take the original of the Gods of the  Greeks  from the  Africans  where  Uranus  they say first reigned a Name which signified  Heaven  and who for his Knowledge of the Stars his People honoured after his Death as a Star in Heaven  This  Uranus  they say was the Father of the Titanes or Giants his Wife also sirnamed  Titea  was canoniz'd for a Goddess her Name signifying Earth Thus Heaven and Earth married together their Son  Hyperion  marrying his Sister  Basilea  She bore him two Children called  Sun  and  Moon  The rest of these fictitious Tales are too long to trouble thee with and only serve to let thee know how ignorant of more ancient Truth those Nations were and that the more genuine and indeed only Fund of Antiquity is treasured up in the Archives of  Churuth  and the Repositories of the holy Mountain where if thou pray to  Mahomet  thou shalt have Wisdom and have the just Discoveries of retired Truth made known to thee  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER X To the Captain Bassa  I Should omit the Duty I owe to thy high Station in the Empire of the Faithful if I did not acquaint thee of the greatest Battle or Seafight which perhaps was ever fought in these Parts of the World whether we regard the Strength of the Fleets or the Vigour and Consequence of the Action  The Glory and Ambition of the King of  France  especially in his maritine Affairs thou hast been no Stranger to for many Years nor art thou ignorant that he was really arrived to a Greatness at Sea amazing to all those who knew the Circumstances he formerly stood in with respect to his Neighbours of  England  and  Holland  and how the former not only were superior to him in Naval Strength but pretended to forbid him encreasing that Power or building any more Ships whenever they thought fit  It was but the last Year but one that we saw the Fleet of  France  engaging those of  England  and  Holland  in the open Seas and being superior to them both as well in the Number of Ships as in the Force of those Ships we found the  English  and  Dutch  retreating from them declining the Fight and at length worsted  The next Year the Fleets of  France  were reckon'd Sail of capital Men of War of the Line  viz  from Guns upwards to  Guns and the  British  and  Dutch  Fleets were not so forward to engage them as was usual  But this Year by I know not what Fate whether the Vigilance and Diligence of the  British  Admiral or the Rashness and Pride of the  French  Admiral I know not but this Year I say has been fatal to the King of  France  in his Naval Affairs and in a great Battle at Sea his Fleet has been entirely overthrown and about of the biggest Men of War in his Navy and indeed some of them the biggest in the World have been burnt or destroyed a Loss which I foresee  France  will not be able to restore in many Years if at all  They came together upon the most natural Terms imaginable for Monsieur  Tourville  the  French  Admiral tho' he had not in his whole Fleet above Sail went boldly into the  British  Channel to seek out his Enemies who were near Sail Thou wilt reasonably conclude that when the weaker looks out for the stronger there will be little Difficulty to meet  The Fight was bloody and there is no doubt but had the  French  been equal in Number to the  British  and  Dutch  Fleets they would have had the better of them but a great Disproportion of Numbers left the  French  Room for nothing but to make the best of their way to their own Coast after an unequal Fight in which no Behaviour of the particular Captains and Officers could atone for the intollerable Rashness of the Admiral in attacking the Enemy when he might have declined it and easily saw the Disparity of Strength  The  French  say in Justification of the Admiral that he had positive and express Orders to fight the Confederates wherever he met  them but 'tis alledg'd in Reply that this was with a Supposition of a probable Advantage or at least a fair Cast for it not to fight at all Adventures two against three where they would be sure to have the worse  However it was the King who is the best Judge of his own Orders received the Admiral perfectly well spoke cheerfully to him and was very far from showing any Resentment against his Conduct as if he had not obeyed Orders  The Loss the  French  has sustained is inestimable of the finest Ships the World ever saw are burnt and destroyed in their own Harbours and in Sight of their own People besides others smaller a Sight so mortifying so dreadful and particularly so provoking to the Seamen who long'd for nothing more than to have fought it out Ship for Ship and Man for Man that they tore the very Hair from their Heads for Rage to see the Ships burnt in their own Ports  But there was no Remedy the  British  and  Dutch  Fleets were upon them the rest of their own Fleet was separated and fled through the Race of Alderney for  Brest  whereupon they set Fire to the Ships with their own Hands after having saved out of them whatever was portable and placed the Hulls so as the Guns might be easily weighed  Never was such a Blaze of Fire seen on Earth the Light was seen in the Air an Hundred Miles to the infinite Terror of the People  The Troops which were drawn up on the Shore prevented the  English  landing and by some Cannon planted on large Batteries kept off the Boats a great while which were sent in to burn the Ships and by those Batteries  they protected two Men of War which were not burnt  The Loss of Men has not been great the Account they give is about Men killed and wounded Nor have the Enemy lost much less but the Loss of the Ships is such as the  French  themselves do not pretend to be able to repair in many Years And since this Disaster they advise the King to spare the excessive Expences of fitting out so great a Fleet and employ the Seamen in small Cruisers to attack the Commerce of the Allies who abound in Numbers of MerchantShips in all Parts of the Sea  This had been good Advice had it been given before had the King of  France  laid up his great Fleet and encouraged his Subjects to sit out Privateers he had saved the Expence of thirty Millions a Year and wounded his Enemies in the most sensible Part  viz  their Trade by which they supported all the rest of their Power  But this is late Advice now and makes good a proverbial Saying of the most learned of the  Nazareens viz  that the  Italians  are wise beforehand the  Dutchmen  in the Action and the  French  after 'tis done  This Blow to the Naval Power of  France  may not be without its good Consequences to thy Affairs Our glorious Master the Grand Seignior knows what use to make of it to the exalting

victorious Pendants of the AdmiralGalley under the Awe of thy Sword and of the Grand Seignior's invincible Power  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XI To  Amurath Zahabbezin  a proselyted Jew of  Trapezond  THO' I believe thou art a true Musselman and hast forsaken the Errors of thy mistaken Brethren yet I find by thy Letters that thou art yet of the Rabbinical Principle and art a kind of  Mahometan  Pharisee for thou canst not refrain in all thy Notions of things to put a mighty Stress upon the Tradition of our Ancestors as if the Alcoran which thou knowest we believe came down from Heaven to our great Prophet needed any Explanations  It's evident to me that the Laws of God handed to  Israel  by the Ministration of  Moses  coming immediately from the divine Oracle spoken by the Mouth of God himself and written down by the Pen of  Moses  the faithful Collector of what God had spoken to him required no Explanations It is to me a sufficient  Objection against the  Jewish  Talmud the  Gemara  and all the Writings which are called the Collections of the Elders that they all differ from  Moses  's Law or the Writings of the Prophets in the Preface or Introduction of them all for that  Moses  introduces all his Precepts with  Thus saith the Lord The Lord spake all these Words and said The Word of the Lord came unto mesaying The Lord hath spoken  and the like  WHEREAS  in the Talmud and all the Collections of traditional Explanations it is said by way of Introduction  Rabbi Simeon  Says thus  Rabbi Juda  Says thus  Rabbi Eliezer  Says thus and the like  And wherefore seekest thou a cabbalistick Scheme or a Collection of traditional Explanations upon the perfect Law of  Mahomet  Art thou ignorant how the Alcoran was brought down from Heaven and given to our great Apostle  Mahomet  and that every Musselman believes that it requires no other Law to explain or enforce it  It is true that we have a  Sonnah  in which are said to be contained traditional Explanations of the Text of the  Alcoran  but the Principles of the Musselman's Belief are such so plain and so few that no  Sonnah  no traditional Precepts can add to or explain Our whole Faith being contained in these two great Fundamentals  viz  That God is but one God and that  Mahomet  is his Apostle or Prophet  The  SONNAH  or  MISNA  of our Law may explain the Precepts of  Mahomet  respecting the Conduct of his Disciples or Followers but the great Point denominating a true Musselman  viz  believing the Unity of Person and the Dignity of  Mahomet  admits  no Explanation neither is the  Sonnah  of our Emirs concern'd in such a blasphemous Attempt  Leave off then enlightened  Morat  thy old cabbalistick Notions and lessen thy Esteem for traditional Ideas believe that  God is One God  and that  Mahomet  is  his Prophet  and enjoys the Blessing of  Eden  the promised Pleasures of Paradise where Oceans of inexpressible Bliss flow down in Streams of Delight where Millions of shining Beauties attend the Faithful such as should one of them appear on Earth all Mankind would dye for the Love of her and sink into inconceivable Torment at the Loss of her  Give no Jealousies to thy Friends that thou art not thoroughly inform'd and hast not embraced the right Way with a perfect Mind  Perhaps it may be true that the Law of  Moses  may stand in need of Interpretations and the Solutions of learned and judicious Men in doubtful and difficult Cases about their sabbattical Observations legal Retributions  c  may be useful Precedents for the Judgment of the Elders in like Cases among the  Jews  to this Time  Tho' I confess I believe all those Traditions and Precedents have rather corrupted than informed their Posterity and have spread a Cloud or Veil of Darkness over their Law rather than cleared it up from any Difficulties that were in it before  But suppose it so for I know the Rabbinists who are the chief sort of  Jews  who I meet with in these Parts of the World do all strictly adhere to the Voice of the Elders and therefore the whole Study of their Doctors is employed upon the  Misna  which is the original  authentick Text of the  Jewish  Traditions or Opinions of the Elders  Yet what is all this to the true Musselmen who believe that  Mahomet  was a Prophet sent from God and that God gave him a Body of written Laws  viz  the Alcoran seeing we have no need of Rabbinical Authorities or traditional Institutes for the Understanding that Law  I am told here by some of the learned Fathers or Rabbies of the  Nazareens  that one  Nicholas Clenardus  a famous Man in the Study of the Laws of the Messiah and fill'd with Learning in all the Languages which were in use in these Parts of the World got a Passport about Years ago  viz  the Year from the King of  Morocco  for Leave to come to  Fez  in  Africa  the capital City of the Moores to study the  Arabick  Language which at that Time not scarce a Scholar in all the  Nazareen  World could read a Word of  It seems his Design was that he might then search and open a Door for others to search after him into the Fundamentals of our Principles examine the Alcoran read the Histories of our great Prophet study the  SONNAHS  of the ancient Emirs and of the sacred  Te  reh  and all the Collections of traditional Knowledge they could reach in order to put the People here into a Method to dispute successfully against the MusselmenDoctors and Dervices as Occasion might offer  But what did all the Study of this famous Man amount to for I hear he lived there eleven Years in which Time he made himself perfect Master of the Tongue and likewise enquired fully into the Laws of  Mahomet  but  with what Success may be seen by the rest of his Life He became afterwards a Professor of  Arabic  in the University of  Prague  and after that in several other Places and left so many Scholars who were Masters of the Language in divers Parts of  Europe  that the learned Men here have a tollerable Skill in the Tongue to this Day  But not one Dispute with any Musselman has ever that I have heard of been managed in consequence of this learned Man's elaborate Studies nor have they been able to enter into any one Argument against the one great Fundamental of  Mahomet  's Laws  viz  That there is but One God or that  GOD IS ONE  Wherefore then studiest thou learned  Morat  to bring us to the  Rabbinick  Method of Explanations in our Law such as the Traditions of our ancient Mufti's and Doctors in  Mahomet  's Law things of very little Use while the Precepts of  Mahomet  are explicit and plain fully directing the Faithful  Thou wilt labour in Light to bring forth Darkness for verily as the Traditions of the Elders have eclips'd the true Light of God's Law among the  Jews  so all the Studies of the most learned Men that are or that shall be hereafter will not add to the Light of the true Believers inspired by their great Prophet to choose the right Way  Nay as thou art already convinc'd that the Traditions of the  Jewish  Cabbala contain in them many things immoral and unjust and that therefore as thou hast well argued against the  Jews  from whom thou art happily for thee separated by the Light of Wisdom so thou mayest well conclude these Rabbinick Traditions infamous and to be rejected since  'tis inconsistent with the righteous and wise Nature of the One God to give to his Servants a holy written positive Law full of wise and just Commandments and then suffer Men to destroy the Intent and Meaning nay the very Foundation of the Law by subsequent humane Interpretations  This has exposed them to the  Nazareens  as a most contemptible Sect of self wise Men but who in Effect have rendered themselves Fools by taking upon them to correct the righteous Law of God and to enervate his Commands by their absurd and corrupt Glosses and Explanations teaching Men to understand the Law of God in a manner not at all agreeable to what he at first directed them to understand it  Be not thou like to them least thou bring thy self into Contempt but let thy Knowledge be improv'd to instruct Men to pray for divine Inspiration that Truth may be its own Interpreter in the Hearts of the Faithful The Blessing of the great Apostle be on all those that choose right things and let Error and Idolatry vanish from the Earth  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XII To the  Reis Effendi  or Secretary of State  THE Angels of Paradise surround the Dominions of thy Lord the Dew of  Hemus  the shining of  Aarathes  the Calms of  Maathaon  attend thy constant Labours in the Service of the happy Emperor of the World  The Empire of the  Franks  begins to suffer Convulsions which no Power on Earth has been ever able to bring her to before the Duke of  Savoy  a poor and contemptible Prince reduced the last Year to such Extremities that his Friends began to talk of his casting himself upon the Clemency of the  French King  has this Year appeared at the Head of an Army so superior to the  French  that disdaining to attack the Towns he had lost or so much as to attempt to recover his Dominions out of the Hands of the  French  he has boldly enter'd  France  with his Army and penetrated into the Province of  Dauphine  at the Head of Men  In this Attempt the  French  seem perfectly surprized they have no Force at hand able to make Head against him the Duke has taken  Guillestre Gap Ambrun  and have laid all the Country far and near under Contribution  This is what  France  has not felt for many Ages all the Power of the Nations by which the  French  have been so vigorously attack'd have not been able till now so much as to  set a Foot into her Dominions she has always carried the War into her Enemy's Country and maintained her Troops at the Expence of the Nations she has made War with  But now while the King of  France  triumphed as it were in the Ruine of this Prince had taken from him the Port of  Nice  and the City of  Villa Franca  with all the Country adjoining also the City of  Chamberry  the impregnable Fortress of  Montmelian  the Town and Citadel of  Suza  and the whole Dutchy of  Savoy  and gave out that they would attack  Turin  the Capital of his Dominions I say in this Poverty of his Circumstances the Duke receives a Supply of  Germans  in a Body also Men raised by the Assistance of the King of  England  and the  Dutch  and a great Sum of Money from the same Powers and making the Mareschal  Catinat  who was the Terror of the  Savoyard  before retreat to  Pignerol  he insults the Dominions of  France  and enters the Heart of the Province of  Dauphine  filling all Places with the Terror of an invasive War  This is a terrible Mortification to the King of  France  It must be a Blow to the Glory of a Man the most ambitious of Fame in the World and it is a greater Affliction as it is from a Hand which they despised so much that it would not more surprize thee to find the Dominions of the Grand Seignior invaded by the Knights of  Maltha  This Attack has rouz'd the Court from the Lethargy of their Pleasures The Statesmen are filled with Indignation at the Insult offer'd the King the Soldiery are eager to be put into a Condition to engage the  Savoyard  and make him pay dear for the Attempt but the  Truth is all Hands are employed the King has so many Broils upon his Hands that he is not able to apply a suitable Remedy to these Mischiefs In short there are no Troops tho' the King of  France  has Three Hundred Thousand Men in Pay yet he has such Embarrassments on his Hands that he knows not where to detach Ten Thousand Men to protect his own Dominions from an Invasion which it was below him so much as to think of without leaving himself open to some other Enemy ready to break in at the Gap which those Ten Thousand Men would make in his Defences  This shews the mistaken Arrogance of this Nation in general founded on the Flatteries of the Courtiers  viz  that  France  alone was able to make War against the whole united Powers of  Europe  They are however obliged to venture it and strong Detachments are ordered to be made from  Rousillon  from  French Comte  and from the upper  Rhine  who make long Matches to join Monsieur  Catinat  but it must be at least Forty Days March ere some of them can come up to him and what Conquests the Duke of  Savoy  may make in that Time we know not  They tremble at the very Gates of  Lyons  one of the greatest and richest Cities in  France  they repair the Fortifications at  Thoulon  and  Marseilles  as if they fear'd a Siege In a Word all  France  is in a Consternation to find Men entred into the Heart of the Country and no Forces ready or at least in Condition to oppose them  The King alone shews a Temper fitted for such a Surprize when every one else discover the Consternation they are in the King speaks  cheerfully smiles at the Mention of the Duke of  Savoy  and tells the Courtiers the Duke and he shall be good Friends for all this and he will go back again quietly  What the King means none knows but himself but as all the King says is received here as an Oracle the People take Heart at it without any other Foundation than that the King says it so true is it that it becomes Kings and Generals of Armies never to shew any Concern at whatever Dangers threaten them for the Eyes of the whole Nation are upon them and will be dejected or encouraged just as the Countenance of their King or General appears anxious or gay  Illustrious Counsellor of the Prince of Emperors how glorious is the  Ottoman  Throne

Hand of Government and the Terror of Infidels  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XIII To  Morat Ebn Allwazhhair  a learned Man studying Astronomy at  Hadramurt  in  Arabia  WHAT art thou doing thou retired Man and wherefore art thou buried alive these Five and Thirty Years being wrapt up among the Stars and beating thy Brains with innumerable Rolls of Figures for the Calculations of the Revolution of Commets and the Eclipses of the Planets in the Systems of the planetary Worlds not yet discovered  It is Fifteen Years ago since thou wrotest to me that thou hadst for twenty Years before spent thy whole Study in a fruitless Endeavour to support the old Philosophy and demonstrate the  Ptolomaian  System against the Objections of the Moderns and against the Notions of the  European  Philosophers being very loth those Infidels who had not Sense to embrace the same just Notions in Religion with thy self should be able to arrive to a Degree of Knowledge in Science superior to that which the ancient learned  Arabians  first dictated for from them  Ptolomey  received the Rudiments and Elements of the celestial Motions which he form'd into a Scheme and got the Honour of having it called by his Name  But after Twenty Years Study it seems thou art obliged to acknowledge the superior Excellence of the Copernican Scheme and the  farther Improvements and Additions of the new Philosophy and that accordingly thou hast sound Methods to solve all the difficult Phoenomena which so distracted  Aristotle  and the greatest Men of Knowledge in the  East  I am therefore to suppose thee now poring upon the Motions of the Planets in the solar System where thou hast set the Sun in the Center as is no Question its due being the Life the Guide the sovereign Director under God the great Director and in a Word the very Soul and Being of the whole System  It may be thou hast spent some time perhaps Years to draw the just Proportions of Gravitation by which the Distances and Magnitude of the Planets are only to be known and perhaps thou hast discover'd as I have done here by looking into the like Calculations in the Study of learned Men here that the Magnitude of the Sun and our Distance from it and likewise the Distance of all the other Planets from it and from one another are infinitely greater than they were supposed by our Ancestors to be and perhaps infinitely greater than we yet think them to be seeing every Calculation that has yet been justly and with good Judgment made carries the Sun farther and farther from us and adds to its Dimentions till from first supposing it to be times bigger than the Earth we are now come to know that it is no less than times bigger and that its Distance is in Proportion remov'd So that we now speak of the Earth's being above Millions of Miles and some say Millions of Geometrical Miles distant from the Sun  That all the Planets gravitate to the Sun and the Sun to them in just tho' differing Proportions and that all those Proportions are  known and calculated in a regular Manner by the Rules of Art I see no Room to question and I doubt not but when thou seest some of the Calculations of the present Masters in this noble Study which I send thee herewith thou wilt readily acknowledge that they are very accurate  The Improvements made here in the Study of these things are exceeding great the King gives all possible Encouragement to such Studies has built them an Observatory at a prodigious Expence and furnish'd them with Glasses for Observation of the best that can be found in the World and every Man who applies to this Study is allowed the Use of those Glasses by the Help of which it is wonderful to consider what new Discoveries in Nature Men daily make and to what Perfection in Art they are arriv'd  Happy  Morat  thou who receivest by the sublime Intellect a superior Instruction art not doubtfully inform'd of all these things and I congratulate the Advances which thou hast made in that yet more unsearchable Branch of Astronomical Knowledge  viz  the Revolutions Number Magnitude and Distance of the Comets Bodies altogether out of our reach as well as out of our Sight  This difficult Study if thou canst bring it to Perfection will put an End to all the enthusiastick Whimsies of these  Nazareens  who are continually poring upon and making Calculations of the general Point of Nature when Time shall finish its Circle and the Pulse of Nature beat no more  For if as we firmly believe the general Conflagration which is the End of all things shall be perform'd by the Flame of a Comet  which in its direct Motion shall at the appointed Hour of Nature come so near this Earth as to set both it and the Moon and perhaps all the Planets of our System on Fire so if thou canst arrive by a just Calculation at the Knowledge of the proper Revolution of this one Comet thou shalt be able without any other prophetick Inspiration to tell us to a Minute nay to one Second of Time when and in what manner the Conflagration of this Earth and in a Word the End of all things shall begin  This noble Study is worthy indeed of all thy Powers and as thou art already in the Garden of Knowledge and drinkest daily of the inspiring Streams of  Aroa jairoth  a Branch of the Brook of  Eden  either thou wilt attain this highest Pinnacle of Knowledge or I must conclude that God for wise and just Reasons has entirely concealed this Knowledge from Men perhaps until  Mahomet  shall be sent down again to bring supernatural Light into the World  However  Morat  as thou hast doubtless made infinite Discoveries in the Secrets of Nature and in the Motions Order and Oeconomy of the celestial Bodies why shouldst thou not communicate to others the Parts proper to be known that succeeding Time may enjoy the Advantage of thy Labours and Study  For thou knowest well divine  Morat  that so the Destination of righteous Power has appointed that Knowledge dies with Men and is not conveyed by Generation or bequeathed by Testament to our Heirs  It is sufficient and what we rejoice in that the  Capacities  of being instructed are  often  conveyed as the Consequences of a sublimer spirituous  Nature in the ordinary Course of Generation the Semen partaking of the extraordinary Vigor of its Ancestor prepares the Case which shall embody the subsequent Soul with dilated Organs and extended Parts adapted for the full Reception of a capacious Intellect and thus the Son often partakes of the natural Endowments of the Father but never of the acquir'd till by the same Erudition and Application he furnishes himself after the Example of his indefatigable Parent  Mark I say they are the Capacities of Nature which are thus convey'd by Generation and that tho' these are OFTEN so conveyed yet that it is not so  always  on the contrary we frequently find that as among the Kings of thy Nation a weak supine stupid  Rh  hoboam  succeeded a wise and incomparably knowing  Solomon  so Ideots and Fools are often the Production of generating Philosophers and Politicians But I return to thy particular Case  Since then all this Knowledge must die with thee and thou shalt carry from thy Children the whole Sum of Forty or Fifty Years Study with thee into Paradise there to delight thy self in the consummate Discovery and that all this shall prepare thee only for the superiour Delights of the Garden of Wisdom what Profit shall the World reap from thee if thou communicate not the Elements of thy Wisdom for Posterity to build upon  The Infidels among whom I dwell boasting of the Improvements they make in the sublimest Branches of humane Knowledge reproach the Musselmen of the Eastern World with being Enemies of Learning and perfectly void of the Advantages of Science living  like meer Animals as they say without the Study or Desire of Knowledge and Wisdom  They discover their own Ignorance and Injustice in this not having been acquainted with the numerous Retreats of the most knowing and most studious Searches after Wisdom in the World and which at this Day take up the happy Plains of  Hadrumurt  the Vallies of  Saada  and the golden Hills of  Oman  the most delicious Part of  Arabia Faelix  where the inspired Souls of wise Men are ravish'd with the Delights of Wisdom and where Knowledge it self takes Pleasure to dwell  But in this they might justly blame us if they were sensible where alone we are deficient that whereas the true Searchers after Knowledge find there infinite Discoveries beyond all that Nature has own'd her self to be furnish'd with in other Parts of the World yet the Proficients ravish'd with the inexpressible Joy of knowing whole Nature live out their Years in their silent Raptures without leaving behind them in laborious Volumes due Schemes of the Discoveries they make  I tell the People here if they would know perfectly the Secrets of Wisdom and have the reserved Treasures of Nature entirely opened to them they must go and dwell among the Fathers of Wisdom in the District of  Raled  and drink of the Waters of  Cazimurt  where Learning is inspired by that Breath of God the Air and Wisdom flows in a Stream like the River  But then I add that they will like them write no Books and the World will receive no Advantage from the Learning and Knowledge of their Forefathers  O  Morat  in this  only  I would have thee imitate the  Nazareens  and as thou hast made such Advances in humane Learning as the World never yet knew communicate thy Knowledge for the Good of Mankind and let these Infidels hereafter confess themselves beholding to a learned  Arab  for more Discoveries into celestial Nature than all the Tellescopes of  Europe  or the Studies of a Thousand Universities could supply  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  The End of the SECOND BOOK  A Continuation of LETTERS written by a Spye at  Paris  BOOK III  LETTER I To  Issuff Oglan  Bassa Teacher of the Exercises of Arms to the young Janizaries at  Constantinople  _I Know thy worth and thy Experience in martial Affairs thy Courage and the Wounds which thou hast received in thy faithful Services to the Grand Seignior I remember the Services of thy Father who lost one of his Arms with a CannonShot at the Battle of  Raab  I know how well thou meritest from the Grand Seignior who knowing very well thy worth has made thee Inspector of  that Body which is the Strength and Defence of the Empire  But as I flatter thee not at any time so much less can I withhold giving thee the needful Instructions which my Distance in this Place furnishes me with for the publick Good  In a Word faithful Servant of the Grand Seignior you must notwithstanding the Excellence of your present Methods for disciplining and exercising the Janizaries I say you must be content to vary as well the Exercise as the Weapons to which they are exercised so that as they excel all the Nations of Infidels in Prowess and Valour they may not be deficient in Knowledge and Experience and may be furnished with all those Additions and Helps to the valiant Hearts they are Masters of as may be sufficient to continue them in the Reputation which they have so long enjoyed of being the best Troops in the World  I need not argue with thee the Necessity and Usefulness of Art in the well disciplining of Soldiers why do we put Weapons into their Hands why do we call the War a Trade an Art why are the Courages of Men lifted up to a due Pitch by enuring them to Action and why do we form Troops into regular Bodies that they may support succour and encourage one another in Fight but because all Ways and Methods are to be studied which may add to the Terror of our Arms and make our Men superior to their Enemies in warlike Experience as well as in Number and Courage  As Weapons are put into the Hands of Men to defend themselves and offend their Enemies so all thy Predecessors in the  Oda  's of  the Janizaries have thought fit to alter and change those Weapons after the Manner of other Nations that they might find no Disadvantage in the Field against their Enemies but might be always equally armed and equally exercised in the Use of those Arms as the other Nations with whom they are to engage  That this has been the Usage I refer thee to the Rules of Discipline established in the Seraglio confirmed in the Divan in the Days of  Selym Ussan Cherger  Bassa Aga of the Janizaries in the Time of  Amurath  the first the glorious Conqueror of  Mahomet  's Enemies under whose Reign the Janizaries were first taught the Use of the Harquebuss or Gun and began to throw away their Javelines and Bows and Arrows where thou wilt find it said that whereas the Christians made use of certain Engines contrived to cast with great Force leaden Bullets point blank which they brought into the Ranks making thereby great Slaughter of their Enemies that therefore it was agreeable to the Law of  Mahomet  to repel Force with the like Force and that thence forward Powder should be made some renegade  Jews  having brought with them the Art of making it and also the Use of those Engines for Shooting Bullets called Harquebusses and that for the Time to come certain Numbers of the Janizaries of the most able Bodies should be armed therewith to annoy the In fidels in the same manner as they intended to annoy others  Sage Instructor of the valiant Youths the Flower and Pillar of the  Ottoman  Glory thou wilt learn from me that the Use of Arms the Exercise the additional Weapons are not only  many which they use now in fight but the manner of using them varies very much and the  French  are in this so dextrous that they are at this Time the Teachers of their Enemies and all the  Nazareens  borrow from them not only the Way of fighting encamping fortifying attacking  c  but even the Terms the Language of the Field is all  French  Think it not a useless Caution that I admonish thee think it not below thee to learn all the Improvements of the Art of War from Infidels and Enemies I'll tell thee wherein they can learn from thee they are not wanting every Step of thy excellent Discipline which they find useful they add to their own  Particularly as thou hast long ago taught the Janizaries to throw away that useless cumbersome Weapon the Pike and instead thereof to make all thy Soldiers able to fight offensively the  French  are taking the hint from thee and all the old Regiments are made now  as they call them here  Fuzileers having no Use of the Pike among them and this will no doubt become a Practice through all the Armies of the  Nazareens  But it shall remain upon Record to thy Praise that this Custom was taken first from thee and that thereby the Janizaries have been rendered the more terrible in fight for some Years particularly at the Defence of the Town of  Buda  and at the Battle of  Nissa  Now as they received this hint from thee O Man of martial Experience be content to take back in Exchange the Improvement they make here of arming their Musqueteers with a Hanjarr or Dagger which they call here a Bayonet which in Case of a close Engagement  with the Enemy and particularly with the Horse they place on the Muzzle of their FireArms and presenting the Point to the Enemy repulse thereby the most fierce Attacks of the Cavalry as well as of the Infantry  So that by this Method of fighting the ancient way of clubbing the Musquet and striking with the Stock or ButEnd of their Pieces is also quite laid aside the Point of the Bayonet being presented with double Force at the End of the Musquet being a much more terrible way of charging and doing much more Execution than the Stock of the Musquet  Take this hint from me founded upon an old Maxim among the Men of the Sword here  Paris  the th Day of the d Moon

tremendous Throne of the invincible Sultan  Achmet  on whose Head be eternal Benediction  TO whom but to thee enur'd to Glory and great Actions should I send an Account of the glorious Progress of Arms on this Side the World and the Conquest of a City impregnable in its Scituation made more so by Art and in a Word still made terrible by a numerous Garrison of resolute and experienced Soldiers  In a Word while the potent Confederacy of the  Germans Dutch English Scots Irish  and all the Powers of the  Northern  World were drawing together to fall upon the King of  France  as if they resolved to finish the War in one Campaign and that no humane Power was able to withstand them  While their numerous Troops were reckon'd up and the onlooking World was as it were amaz'd at the very Thoughts of what would be done by such a collected Power led on by such a martial Prince as the new King of  England  or rather as we call him here Prince of  Orange  While all Eyes were turned upon the Councils of  France  and every one wondred what course the King would take and what Dispositions of his Troops he would make to oppose such prodigious Forces as seemed to threaten his Dominions  I say while things were in this Posture we see all the World under some kind of Consternation except the King of  France  but of him it might be truly said that he alone made all these terrible things his Sport smiles continually covered his Face and he was ever gay he spent the Day among the fair ones and diverted himself with Balls Opera's Feasts and Shews as if the whole Kingdom had been in profound Peace  Now and then and as if it had been for his Diversions only he would steal away to his Divan or Chamber of Privy Counsellors where he would stay so little as to be hardly miss'd and return as unconcerned as one who was only born for Delight and swallowed up in Pleasures  When on a sudden without the least Noise or Disorder News came to  Paris  for we knew nothing of it before that  Namure  the strongest Town in  Flanders  was invested by Monsieur  de Boufflers  and that the Troops were all in full March from the Frontier Garrisons to form the Siege  Nor was this all but in two or three Days more we found the King's FieldEquipage preparing and were told that his Majesty resolved to command the Siege in Person  It is impossible to describe to thee what hurry and Confusion this real  Coup de Eclat  has  put the World into The Confederates drew together their Forces in such Numbers and with such Assurance of Success that People began to be very apprehensive of the Success of the Enterprize only the King and the Duke of  Luxemburg  pursue steddily the Measures they have taken and depend upon the Success  As the Confederates talk of having an Hundred Thousand Men to raise the Siege the King resolved to have as many to cover the Siege besides a sufficient Force to carry it on  The King having resolved to be there in Person all the Houshold Troops were ordered to march the  Gens de Arms  the Light Horse the Guards  de Corps  all went away before and the Duke of  Luxemburgh  saw himself surrounded with Thousand Men before the King came who brought with him about Men more  The siege in the mean time was carried on with such Vigor that the City surrendred upon Articles in less than Days the Batteries consisting of Pieces of Cannon and Mortars made such terrible Work and the  French  followed their Work so close with Attack upon Attack Storm upon Storm even from Morning to Night that nothing could withstand them  Upon the City having surrendred the  French  had this Advantage that their Lines took up less Circumference the Castle and a strong Fort which was lately built took up an Angle form'd by two Rivers the  Meuse  and the  Sambre  so that the  French  had nothing to do but to extend their Works from one River to the other exactly as the City of  Belgrade  is scituate in the Angle between the  Danube  and the  Sauve  The Castle and Fort made a stout Resistance the latter being defended by Monsieur  Cohorn  the Engineer who contrived and built it and after whose Name it was called the  Cohorn  Fort this Man is no less a Soldier than an Engineer and is one of the best Officers in this Part of the World both for Experience in Conduct as well as Courage in Action  The Vigour of this Defence gave the Prince of  Orange  Time to collect his Troops and being as good as his Word he approach'd the Leaguer with an Army of no less than Ninety Five Thousand Men and which was still more these Troops were thought to be all old experienc'd Regiments the Flower of the military Men in this Part of the World  Yet in Sight of this Army and as if they were come only to be Witnesses to the Glory of the  French  Power the King of  France  carried the Place the Duke of  Luxemburgh  covered the Siege with an Army at least equal to that of the Confederates but posted so with a River in his Front to Advantage entrenched all the Avenues to his Camp and fortified in such a Manner and those Trenches mounted with such an innumerable Number of Cannon that it was impossible for the Prince of  Orange  to attack him or so much as to pass the River tho' it was but a small one to approach his Entrenchments  It is true the Confederates made several Motions this Way and that to draw him out of that Scituation but it would not do and the River swelling at the same time with a hasty Rain gave them some Excuse for not attempting what they saw could not be done without hazarding the Ruin of their whole Army  In the mean time the King pushing on the Attacks against the Place the Works were continually storm'd Day and Night the Garrison was plied with incessant Batteries and Assaults so that all the Outworks being won the Garrison was obliged to capitulate after having lost above Men of their Number in the Siege  The Reputation this has given to the  French  Arms the Vigour it has put into their Measures and Councils at a Time when all  Europe  expected they would have been oppress'd with the Power of so many Enemies is not to be express'd nor is it to be equall'd by any thing in the World but thy glorious Enterprizes in  Hungaria  where thou hast retriev'd the Honour of the  Ottoman  Arms and curb'd the Insolence of the Enemies of thy Master's Glory in a manner surprizing to the whole World  Illustrious and fortunate General thou alone outshinest the Glories of the greatest Heroes may thy Name be terrible and thy Arm victorious till thou exaltest the Crescent of  Mahomet  upon the Spire of the great Mosque at  Vienna  from whence the triumphing  Nazareens  had the Insolence to take it down after it had been an Hundred and twenty Years a Testimony to the powerful Arms of the magnificent  Solyman  Emperor of the Musselmen  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER III To the Aga of the Janizaries  THE  Nazareens  the ancient Enemies of God and his great Prophet whose Champion thou art are universally involv'd in War The  German  Emperor Head of the Princes of the People believing in Jesus and of the Followers of the Messiah is engaged in a bloody and heavy War against the  French  Tho' his Power is great his Troops numerous and well disciplin'd and his Generals are Men of Gallantry and Experience yet the Vigilance and Velocity of the  French  Motions their subtilty in contriving their Attacks and Celerity in Execution of their Designs are such that the  Germans  are every where worsted and defeated  The King of  France  is devoured in Imagination but he always extricates himself by the admirable Vivacity of his Councils and the Vigour of his Generals he conquers on every Hand and his turning the Schemes of his Adversaries all upon themselves by being before them in every Action is the Astonishment of Mankind  The Nothern Powers have placed at the Head of their Confederacy a Prince politick in Council as  Tomombcius  the  Mamuluck  furious in Battle as  Scanderbeg  the  Epirot  warlike in Genius as  Isurael  the  Persian  but as all these were unfortunate and their Powers at last fell under the irresistible Hand of the  Ottoman  Power so the Prince of  Orange  is made glorious only by being defeated and the Greatness of his Soul seems rather illustrated by his equal Mind under his Misfortunes than by the Laurels and Triumphs of Victory  In the Beginning of the Year he had the Honour of seeing the King of  France  take the strongest Fortress on the Frontiers of the  Netherlands  while he look'd on at the Head of a Hundred Thousand Men but was not able to relieve it and now he has had the Misfortune of attacking the  French  Army at a Village called  Steenkirk  but has been beaten off with the Loss of above Men and some of his best Generals and has taken the Pains to bring the Duke of  Luxemburgh  a Victory to the very Lines of his Camp  In  Germany  the King of  France  gains every Campaign and this Year he has plundered the Frontiers of the Empire and in View of a superiour Army forced the  Germans  to repass the  Rhine  and at last tho' he refused to fight their whole Army has defeated a Body of Horse which he surprized at a Distance from their grand Army and cut them in Pieces almost to a Man  Thus this invincible Monarch tho' he struggles with innumerable Difficulties at home and tho' he has most powerful Enemies abroad even on every Side of him triumphs in their Disappointment and will in Time most certainly reduce them all one after another if some unexpected Blow does not intervene to disable him at once and even this there seems to be no Danger of where the Power is so great and the Prince so vigilant that it seems next to impossible to surprize him  The Fortune of this Man puts me in Mind of  Saladin  the famous Prince of the  Arabians  or of their Successors the  Saracens  who when overpower'd and surrounded with innumerable Armies of the  Nazareens  who blind Zeal inspired to make War upon the true Musselmen on pretence of recovering the Sepulchre of Jesus the Son of  Mary  this Prince by his Vigilance and Valour accompanied with a never wearied Application at length conquered them all and sent them home to instruct their Posterity how foolish an Enterprize their Fathers spent their Blood and Treasure upon  viz  to look for the Sepulchre of him who was taken up into Heaven  So may the Arms of the invincible Sultan  Achmet  thy glorious Master prosper in thy Hands till the  Germans  and other Nations of the  Nazareens  who have so long in vain lifted up the Sword against him may see and repent of their Folly and admonish their Posterity to avoid splitting on the same Rock  Valiant Aga wherefore is it that the Experience and Valour of the Janizaries has not yet convinc'd the grand Vizier of the Usefulness and Necessity of keeping up a larger Body of those gallant Troops suitable to the Greatness and Extent of the Dominions of  Mahomet  and proportioned to the growing Power of the  Nazareens  who by their Advantages over the true Believers are grown more powerful and more insolent than ever  Why are not the Oda's of the Janizaries encreased in every Beglerbeg or Government nay why are not all the Soldiers of the Grand Seignior made Janizaries  viz  taught Discipline enured to Hardships instructed in due  Subordination to their Officers and in a Word made good Soldiers  The Courage the Gallantry in Spirit the Strength and Agility of Body with which our People are endowed far exceeds the Nations they are engaged with what are the  French  the  Italians  the  Hungarians  they have neither the Constancy of Mind or Strength of Body as the  Bulgarian Thracian Georgian  and  Armenian  Janizaries the  French  common Soldiers are low and despicable their Limbs weak their Subsistence mean their Intemperance weakens and debilitates them and they seem capable of no Service yet we see them often by the excellent Conduct of their Officers and their own being enured to the War I say we see them often break the undisciplined Nations of other Countries nay even of the  Germans  themselves by their dextrous Use of their Arms and the Fire of their martial Disposition  Were the Subjects of the Grand Seignior thus bred to the Field were they daily and duly exercised as the Janizaries we know the martial Genius the undaunted Spirit the Constancy and Courage of the faithful Musselmen is such that they would cut the  Germans  in pieces the best Troops of these Infidel Nations could not stand before them if this is not done take  Mahmut  's Word the Art of War is so much improved the Methods of fighting so altered and the Engins and the Devices of the Generals so differing from what it was in our Forefathers Days that it will be impossible for any of the Grand Seignior's Troops but the Janizaries and Spahis to stand their Ground against their Enemies their Number must be encreased and  they must be encouraged equal to their Deserts and then the  Ottoman  Arms shall triumph as they have always done over Infidel Nations to the Day when the great Gates of  Eden  shall be opened and the Faithful shall with Swords of Flame destroy the Enemies of  Mahomet  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER IV To the  Aga  of the  Janisaries  IT was thought in the Beginning of this Year that the King of  France  's good Fortune began to leave him things went exceeding hard with him on every Side for tho' he had taken the usual Advantages of the Spring by being early in the Field as was always the Custom of  France  and by which they used to have the better Hand of the Confederates and had thereby taken  Namure  as I have written already to the Grand Vizier yet the ConfederateArmy harrass'd the  French  Frontiers in  Flanders  extremely after this and attack'd their whole Army in their Camp tho' without Success in the End  Two Blows have since that befallen  France  which are as two Stabs into the Vitals of a Body which before was struggling for Life  and it was thought had they been followed home the Glory of the King of  France  must have expired these were the Overthrow of their Fleet by the  English  and  Dutch  and the penetrating into the Bowels of  France  by the Duke of  Savoy  at the Head of Men where he committed most dreadful Ravages and burnt above a Hundred Towns of both which I have written fully to the Kaimacham who will doubtless communicate the Particulars to thee  The  French  Nation were so humbled by these two fatal Stroaks coming together to neither of which they were in a Condition to apply any immediate Remedy and especially being at the same Time threatened with a powerful Invasion or Descent of an Army from  England  that they fell to what they call here the last Remedy  viz  Prayers to their Messiah to this End a general Day of  Biram  was proclaimed by the great Mufti of  Paris  throughout his Districts and so by the other pontifical Mufti's in their respective Dominations with strict Orders that all the People should apply themselves to their Devotions and to call upon their God in the Name of the Son of  Mary  to deliver them  Whether it were that the Sins of the other  Nazareen  Nations were so great that Heaven did not think sit to chastise  France  by their Hands or whether their Prophet JESUS to whom the  French  were said they put up their Petitions did obtain Help for them I do not well know how to resolve for these  Nazareens  of  France  have so many Intercessors that it is hard to resolve who they will thank for their Deliverance or who they will acknowledge to have procured it for some pray  to God alone others to Jesus and some to his Mother some to this old Hermit some to another so that it is certain there are almost as many Idols as Worshipers  However it was this is certain that the whole Stream of Successes seems to be turned on a sudden and the Attempts of the Enemies of  France  however probable and however powerful have miscarried on every Side and the King of  France  is in a fair way to conclude the Year with a general Triumph over his Enemies  In Truth O thou fortunate Leader of the select Bands of the Faithful the Sword in the Hands of the Soldier is never in vain lifted up when the Eyes of those who fight are first lifted up to Heaven for whether God hears these Infidels or not in respect to their wrong and ill directed Worship yet he may give Ear to all his Creatures when they lift their Hands to him for Help against their Enemies and deliver them that they may de directed to seek the right way of applying themselves on farther Occasions  Hence it was without doubt that the more pure Prayers of the faithful Mussulmen in their great Pilgrimage or Procession to  Mecca  the Year before the last obtained the future Favour of our great Prophet who strengthened the Arms and sharpened the Scymaters of the Janizaries to hew down the Enemies of the Grand Seignior  It consists well with the Notions we entertain of the great  Alla  who guides the Affairs of Men whether private and personal or national that he sometimes hears even the Calamities of infidel Nations and turns the Scale of his Providence as they turn their  Eyes upwards tho' otherwise they may be impious Transgressors of his Law for Heaven never can be said to stand neuter in the Concerns of War and Peace between Nations tho' the contending Parties may be equally Infidels and Enemies to God but he delivers here and delivers up there as it best answers the great Ends of his Glory in the Earth  How much more then shall he hear the Prayers of his faithful People who choose the right Way and what Courage must this give to the Hands and Hearts of thy immortal Soldiers when they know the whole Choir of Believers five Times a Day make Prayers for their victorious Progress in the Field  But to do the King of  France  Justice after all this he took care to pray and fight whether it was that he had less Confidence in the Priest than in the Sword I will not determine but he applied himself with infinite Vigilance to every Attack that was made upon him and his Troops brought him unexpected Victories from several Quarters  At the same Time Heaven concurr'd and Two things more especially seemed to be the immediate Act of a supernatural Power for Example the Duke of  Savoy  in the Middle of his Success when he was entered the very Heart of the  Dauphinate  and promised to himself the Plunder of the Cities of  Briancon  and  Grenoble  nay as some said expected to pass the  Rhosne  and penetrate into  Languedoc  in the Middle of all this Triumph the Duke who was the Soul of the Enterprize was struck from Heaven with a loathsome Disease which they call here  les Petits Veroles  a Distemper not known in the happy Climate of  Arabia  where thou and I drew our serener Breath  They tell us a Story here and boast much of it tho' I tell thee beforehand I believe not one Word of it that the very Moment that the King of  France  was on his Knees in the Royal Chappel or Mosque of his Serail or Palace at  Versailles  praying to the image of  Mary  the Mother of their Prophet Jesus she struck the Duke of  Savoy  with the SmallPox If this were true the  French  would have much more Reason to worship that old Woman than any of us believe they have  But to leave these  Nazareens  to their Superstitions certain it is the Duke was taken so ill and was brought into so much Danger of his Life by this Distemper that it put a full Stop to all his Conquests and the Troops retired in the best manner they could quitted all the Places they had taken broke down the Bridges behind them and rather fled than march'd quite out of  France  and that faster than they came in and yet the  French  Army was not in any Posture to precipitate them at all neither did any one pursue them  Whether the King of  France  will acknowledge this to be the Hand of God or of the Woman  Mary  I know not but this I know that if he takes the Honour from the Hand that has really sav'd him in so remarkable a Manner and pays the Acknowledgment of it to the Image of that Woman it would be very righteous in the great Retalliator of just Sentences to make the same Hand of  Savoy  scourge him into a more rightly directed Devotion  But he has bad another Deliverance also immediately from Heaven for the  English  Army who were not only appointed but actually shipp'd and sail'd in order to make  a Descent upon the Kingdom of  France  and which it was apparent the  French  were in great Apprehensions of because they knew not where to look for them or provide against them are returned and relanded in  England  having given over the Design without its being possible to see any apparent Reason for their doing so  Being thus at once delivered from these two great and threatning Articles they were not only easie but at leisure to apply proper Remedies to the other Parts where they were weakest and first the Duke of  Luxemburg  having been attack'd by the King of  England  at  Steenkirk  in  Flanders  he repulst him after a very obstinate Fight with the Loss of near Men kill'd wounded and taken Prisoners and believing himself by this Victory able to stand his Ground with fewer Troops than before great Detatchments have been made to the  Rhïne  and to  Piedmont  of which I shall give thee a full Account in my next  Illustrious Aga as these bloody Wars destroy Multitudes of Men and the  Nazareens  are thus cutting one another in pieces let thy victorious Ensigns cheerfully advance secure of Conquest assisted by the Prayers of our great Prophet and thy unwearied Valour and Council  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER V To the venerable Mufti sage Mirror of celestial Wisdom the inlighten'd Prince of the Oracles of Virtue Guide of the true Believers to the Glories of Paradise and Keeper of the Garden of Pleasure  VERILY the Affairs of Religion in these Parts of the World tend apparently to the forgetting entirely that there is a Rule for Men on Earth or a God to judge in Heaven it would amaze thee venerable and wise Patron of Piety it would amaze thee  I say  to see how that Bawble called Religion is kick'd about here even among the Men pretending to Learning Understanding and the Height of humane Knowledge till it grows into Contempt and will in a little Time be entirely lost nay perhaps it may be no more remembred no not so much as the Name of it  It is true there is so much Gain made here by the Shew of it that for ought I know the Formalities of Religion may continue some time at least till the Pride Luxury and Lewdness of the Clergy provoke the common People to do themselves Justice upon the Priests which will certainly happen the first Occasion the Mob have to get so much Power into their Hands and then as the Substance of  Religion never was among them the Shadow will wear off with small Difficulty  Here was a Book publish'd a few Months ago by a Man who does not want Wit entituled  The Vanity of Religion and the Necessity of the Disguise of it being thrown off  He would insinuate that seeing the wicked Lives of the Clergy or Dervices makes it manifest to the World that there is no such thing as Religion really and at the Bottom of all their Schemes but that it is a meer Grimace and a Piece of Hypocrisie to get Money and Dominion one over another that therefore Men ought to deliver themselves from the insupportable Weight of the Disguise of Religion and make no farther Pretences to it in the World  Some People take this to be a Satyr only and pointed at the Hypocrisie and Cheats of the Clergy who under the Colour of religious Habits and Orders are the Protectors and Encouragers of all sorts of Wickedness but we as true Mussulmen join in the litteral Sense of the Words and believe they ought to throw off all the Disguise own the Cheat and pretend no more to any thing of that which they call Religion here embracing at the same time the most pure and perfect Rules of Blessedness from the Mouth of undisguised Truth owning and adhering to the everlasting Oracle and the Law of the great Prophet  Mahomet  Some time since I heard that the great Mufti of the  Nazareens  the Prince of Delusions and Patron of apostate Mysteries who calls himself the Head of the Followers of Jesus the Son of  Mary  the infallible Guide of the Law and Interpreter of the Faith and Doctrine  of the Christians was at the Point of Death  Upon this News it is scarce possible to describe to thee what running and posting what intreaguing and caballing there was among the Princes and Courts in this Part of the World to make an Interest for a new Election  France  is particularly concerned if possible to have a new Pope elected out of the Number of Cardinals who are in the  French  Interest and Couriers are dispatch'd to all the Cardinals that are so to set out immediately for  Rome  to be present at the new Election and take Care of the main Point in the Conclave It is worthy of thy self sublime Judge of venerable Truth to search into the Policies of those People and to have an Account of this Election faithfully laid before thee I shall take care to obtain as many Particulars as may be depended upon and lay them at thy sacred Feet as they go on  In the mean time I observe no Grief for the Loss of him that is going Of what Import say they is the Death of an old Man the Regard to the Person of the late Pope is all swallowed up in the politick Bustle they make for a new Election and in this Part  Spain  and the Emperor are the particular Opposers of the  French  Interest  This dead Pope has sat in the Chair of the Pontiff but fifteen Months and is no less than Eighty one Years of Age I call him dead because soon after an Express arrived with an Account of his Death the Particulars I have of it as published here by the Court are thus  He had been indisposed for four or five Days and having Reason on Account of his great Age to expect the first Shock would  carry him off he disposed himself for his Exit he discours'd much the  th  of the Moon called  January  to the Cardinals concerning the several Interests of  Europe  and his Endeavours to prevent the growing Mischiefs of the War which however he saw was impossible He passed some Bulls and declared against some Encroachments of the King of  France  upon the Church  The  th  he found himself very ill and the  st  much worse and his End drawing on which obliged the Cardinals and more especially his Favourites to keep near his Person next Morning being somewhat better he received the sacred Oil as they call it and the rest of the Seals of their Religion and discoursed a long Time with Cardinal  Colorede  his Confessor and other Ecclesiasticks upon Matters of Piety After which the Cardinals being brought to his Bed one after another he recommended it earnestly to their Care to cast their Eyes in the next Conclave upon a worthy Person to fill St  Peter  's Chair more especially considering the Consequence of the Election at such a Juncture of the Affairs of  Europe  he expired the Night of the same Day about Four of the Clock in the Morning aged fourscore and one Years after he had sat fifteen Months and twenty two Days being elected the  th  of the Moon which they call  October    The Meeting of the Conclave their manner of electing the Rules of their strict or rather mock Confinement during the Time of their electing this thou art fully acquainted with and I have no need to trouble thee with Repetitions  It is not yet known who shall succeed in the Pontificate of Idolaters neither is it of  much Consequence for tho' the Popes themselves labour very assiduously to make themselves considerable to the Princes of  Europe  yet the Princes on the other Hand oftentimes take occasion to mortifie the Popes and to let them see the Insignificancy of their Power when it comes in competition with temporal Interest I say this makes the whole System of the Papacy a meer Piece of political Pageantry carried on to support the Pride and Luxury of the Clergy and which is in it self nothing at all but a Bubble of Air and Emptiness when it comes to be tried with its Superiors the secular Powers of  Europe  The Conclave is met and the last Pope has left it full which has not been known in the Memory of Man This Pope was a Person of the least Signification of any that has sat in this Chair of Abomination for many Ages and can only have this said in his Favour that he has done neither Good nor Harm he has left little but his Name to put Posterity in mind that ever he was here He was superannuated when he came in and after a Stay only of One Year and three Moons left the Chair of the old Fisherman just where he found it  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER VI To  Ali  Bassa Chief of the Engineers and Seraskeir of the  Morea  I Cannot have a fairer Occasion to give thee an Account of something in thine own Way than what offers just now among the  Nazareens  The Castle of  Montmelian  is a Fortress in the Dutchy of  Savoy  which for many Ages has been thought impregnable as well by the Difficulty of its Scituation as the Addition of all the Fortifications that Art could invent or the best Engineers of this Country contrive to render it perfectly inaccessible  It is seated upon a monstrous Rock exceeding high steep and inaccessible except on one End where it runs out long narrow and sloping down till it gradually comes level to a little Plain from whence they pass to a little River with a Bridge over it called the  Isera  This is the only Passage into the Fort but is so taken up with Works innumerable one above another and one defending another that it is not to be conceived how Art should find its Way among such Opposition to work it self into the Town  It is commanded by one Rock which indeed overlooks this Part but there is no possible getting any Cannon up to that Rock except by Pullies and Engines and this must be done in the Face of the Fire of the Forts on the Hill of the Castle  Yet this impregnable Fortress has been taken by the  French  after a long Blockade in a few Days formal Siege and that in the most severe Season of the Year when the Mountains of which the whole Country is composed were all covered with Snow and the Cold so severe that every one thought it insupportable  This however surprizes no Body here whatever it may do in other Countries for  France  has always his Men ready to take the Field his Magazines and his Arsenals are always well furnished and he has such good Generals and such a great Number of Officers that they make it a Point of Honour to expose their Lives when it is for the Glory of the  French  Monarchy besides the Monarch himself little cares how he sacrifices his best Soldiers and being absolute exacts such vast Sums from his Subjects makes his Soldiers march all Seasons of the Year and takes his Time and his Measures so exactly that he may be said to play a sure Game whenever he has a Mind to make himself Master of any Place  Of this they that have to deal with  France  ought to be sensible in good earnest for so long as they are not vigilant and upon their Guard  France  will be always upon the Surprize with them 'tis in vain to trust in the Scituation of a Fortress if there be not Men in a Condition to be stirring at all times There are no Places now adays impregnable unless they be relieved in Time The Fortresses that are the highest raised are no less subject to the Destruction of the Bombs and Carcasses than to the Strokes of thundering Cannon so that all that great Guns can tear down must yield at length to a Conqueror that resolves  to spare neither Lives nor Limbs to make himself Master of a Place especially when unmolested from without since Artillery came in use there is nothing can resist the Force of it when the General that besieges has no Enemy to disturb him behind The Engines now adays made use of give the Besieged so little Time to look about 'em that many times they are taken when they think to make the stoutest Defence and therefore the surest Way is always to have Men lie ready near those Places which are most in Danger that in Case of Necessity they may be able to form a Body sufficient to encounter the Enemy  This Place was taken in two and thirty Days principally by the Power of battering and mining for there was not any one Attack made of any Consequence  The Besieged defended themselves without much use of either great Shot or small Shot and yet they kill'd the  French  a great many brave Men and some considerable Officers their chief Defence was countermining the Works of the Assailants and rolling great Stones upon them from the Tops and Ascents of the Rocks which coming so furiously and receiving additional Strength to the Motion from the Heights from whence they were cast were not to be resisted no not so much as the Shot of great Guns might have been resisted  The Garrison plied them with this Sort of Battery incessantly so that no sconer had the Assailants raised a Battery of Cannon or any Work to cover or lodge their Men but in one Night's Time it was overthrown and as it were buried with Stones and the vast Quantity  of Rubbish the Stones brought with them so that the Cannon were dismounted as it were in a Moment or perhaps broken and the Carriages clogg'd so as not to be stirred Stones of two or three Ton coming down continually upon them from the Summits of an immense Mountain  The Bombs however and Miners reduced the Place and a Bomb by Accident breaking into one of the Mines which the Garrison themselves had made to ruin the Approaches blew up the great Bastion of the Place at which Breach the  French  taking hold of the Occasion Six hundred Men immediately entered and the Garrison seeing themselves surprised beat a Parly  The Garrison were but Men and it is observed that they were so secured in the Retreats which they had in the Rock from the Shot and Bombs that tho' the  French  were not sparing of either one or other yet they lost very few Men within the Place I think less than whereas the  French  lost above Men without besides such as died by the Extremities of the Weather which were a great many  But that which is yet more strange than all this is that the King of  France  has given positive Orders to have the Place entirely demolished which some People think to be very ill Policy but I am of Opinion I confess that the King is in the Right for he concludes that on a Peace which he knew would sometime or other happen it must be restored and he is not willing it should cost him Men again if he should ever have an Occasion to lay another Siege to it and as the Fortifications before were made by the  French  he knows the Duke of  Savoy  cannot spare so much Money as it must cost to restore them to what they were before  For thy farther Improvement in the Art of Fortifications and Attacks of Towns and to acquaint thee with the noble Experiment daily made on these Occasions by this aspiring Infidel Nation I shall send thee several Plans and Drafts of the several Fortifications of the Places which have been attack'd by the  French  in this War and likewise Plans of the Approaches Batteries Circumvallations and Contravallations for the Security of their Camps and Works that thou mayest extract from thence whatsoever shall be useful to thee in the Conquests the Grand Seignior's Armies shall make upon the  Germans  The Wisdom of  Sephar  the Son of  Omar Caled  attend thy

sublime Plants of the perfum'd  Aourisna  the Lawrels of the Vale and the beautiful never fading Roses of the celestial Garden  Victory attend thy Undertakings let the Turrets of  Buda  and the impenetrable  Canisia  the strongest Fortresses in the  Nazareen  Empire sink under thy Attacks or be blown up into the Air by the Assistance of thy irresistible Art  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER VII To  Ibrahim Ebn Allhazar Reis Effendi  or Secretary of State  I Never doubted after I had heard that the Grand Seignior trusted to thy Judgment in the Choice of a Person to succeed me in this retired Piece of secret Service I say I never doubted but if there was one Man in the whole Empire fitter than another for the Work thou wouldest find him out  And yet it never entred into my Thoughts that thou shouldest send as far as  Algier  on the Borders of the Empire of  Morocco  for a Man who has for many Years had upon his Hands an Employment in its Nature the same tho' not so fill'd with Variety as this of mine  Morat Oglou  the Son of the late chaioux Bassa is a Person so well vers'd in the Courts and Affairs of the  Nazareens  that I know not a Man fitted like him for this Employment I remember very well the Errand he was sent upon to the  English  Court and how well he discharg'd himself during his Residence there for twelve Years and I have much wondred that such a Genius could be buried in Silence for so long time as he has been in  Africk  tho' I doubt not but he has employed his Hours in the most useful Manner and with the most Advantage possible to himself  I know he will come hither stored with Knowledge in the publick Affairs of the  Nazareen  Countries as well as with the Wisdom of the  Arabians  whose Language and Manners as well as Studies he is thoroughly Master of his Genius enclines him to all useful Studies he is a great Master of History and of natural Philosophy and as I have been told has for some Years among the  Moors  addicted himself to the Study of the heavenly Motions and is the most perfect Astronomer in that Country  I shall rejoice at his arriving here and shall not fail to dispatch the Orders I have receiv'd from thee to the  Jew  at  Florence  that he may give him Notice of the Grand Seignior's Pleasure  It will not a little contribute to our great Master's Service if he takes the nearest Passage by Sea to  Alicant  and travels through  Spain  and  Portugal  to bring with him some Account of things transacting in those Courts  I shall obey the Orders of the Divan who direct that I should assist a Year after his coming here to introduce him into the Methods of his Conduct proper for his Concealment and for his more effectual serving the Grand Seignior's Interest  Happy is  Mahmut  in thus effectually finishing the long Course of his Services and almost of his Life to the Satisfaction of the most glorious Emperor of the World the Lord of Sovereigns and King of Kings in the Earth  The remaining Moons will be but a gentle Slumber taken up entirely with the pleasant Contemplation of my Return and the soft Dreams of my Retirement into my native Country  I shall bear the small Delay without the least Reluctance when the Hours shall pass with the sweet Reflections that I am a releas'd Man that my Successor is arrived and I am as it were at the Gates of  Mecca  the highest of my Desires and to me the Perfection of Bliss on this Side the Mountain of Perfumes in the full Plain of  Eden  whither I shall in a few Moons more be transported in the Bosome of the bright Cloud of Glory always apparent without the first Gate of Paradise  There I shall wait thy coming illustrious  Alhazar  and shall be Witness to the Honour done to the most useful Servant of our great Prophet  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER VIII To the Aga of the Janizaries  I Have already written to thee an Account how the good Fortune of the King of  France  is returned to him and this Campaign which in one Part of it was most fatal to  France  and threatning to be still more so has appeared more to the Glory of the  French  Nation and particularly of the King than any since the War begun  The Beginning of the Season the Campaign was opened with the Siege of  Namure  a terrible Place for Strength and yet taken in the View of an Hundred Thousand Men and headed by the greatest and most formidable Enemy the King of  France  has in the World  viz  the King of  England  a Man whose Character rises in the World like a new Star in a Constellation never discovered before  After this the same King of  England  with that great Army warmly endeavoured to bring the Duke of  Luxemburgh  to a Battle but yet when he attempted to force him to it by attacking him at  Steenkirk  was repuls'd and oblig'd to retreat with very great Loss of his best Men several Generals of great Reputation have been kill'd in this Attempt with abundance of Officers and Six or Eight Thousand Soldiers  The Campaign on the  Rhine  seemed to be going off without Action but the Duke  de Lorge  the  French  General who commanded  there having received some Forces from  Flanders  followed the  Germans  so well and managed so subtilly that at length he trick'd them into a Separation and then turning short upon one Half of them before they could join again fell upon that Part of their Army which march'd under the Duke of  Wirtemberg  towards  Germany  defeated them entirely cut of them in pieces took Prisoners a great many Officers of Note and among them the Duke himself  After this pursuing the other Body who were commanded by the Landgrave of  Hesse  and had laid Siege to the strong Fortress of  Ebrenburgh  he obliged them to raise the Siege with great Precipitation and in the mean Time Monsieur  de Lorge  had ordered a Body of Troops to make the usual Havock of a Conqueror in the Duke of  Wirtemburg  's Country and the Circles adjacent where besides the Plunder they gain'd which was prodigious great they raised some Millions of Money for Contribution  The  Germans  have receiv'd this Blow as a just Return for their drawing so many of their Troops from the  Rhine  to fight against the faithful Mussulmen in  Hungaria  which they do upon a Supposition that the Princes of the Confederacy would supply them with other Troops in their stead how well they perform it this is an Example And I rather send thee this Account because thou mayest gather from it that the Emperor of the  Nazareens  has already sent for five  German  Regiments of Foot and four Regiments of Horse from  Hungary  the Foot making Men and the Horse and thou mayest depend that every Blow the Emperor receives upon the  Rhine  will be felt  in  Hungary  where the Troops of the Grand Seignior on whose Arms be the Lustre of Heaven will have so much the more Room to act with Success  In  Catalonia  the  French  General with the Assistance of a Squadron of Men of War from  Thoulon  has in less than twelve Days taken the strong Town and Port of  Roses  a Conquest the more considerable because of its being the best Harbour for shipping that the  Spaniards  have upon the whole Continent of their Dominions in the Mediterranean  The Method the Court of  France  takes when any Prisoners of Quality fall into their Hands is very singular and worth thy Observation in this Place as it recommends the Civility of the  French  Nation to all the World The Prince of  Wirtemberg  taken Prisoner as I have said by the Duke  de Lorge  is a Man of Arms a Lieutenant General in the Emperor's Army and a Prince of the Empire also tho' he was but Administrator at present of the Dutchy of  Wirtemberg  for the Heir his Nephew who is a Minor  Thou wilt observe in the Usage this Prince met with how well the  French  Soldiers know their Duty and what Respect their King and all his Generals by his Command shews to captiv'd Princes or Officers of Quality when he was taken Prisoner which it seems was by a Lieutenant of Horse he had not the least Violence offer'd him or any thing taken from him only the Officer desired some Token from him that he was the Person that gave him his Hand  that is to say  that took him Prisoner and sav'd him from the Fury of the Soldiers upon which the Duke took a fine DiamondRing from his Finger and a  Gold Watch out of his Pocket and gave to the Lieutenant who returned him his Watch again and took his Parole of Honour that he would not offer to escape  The Duke however desired the Lieutenant to accompany him to the General's Tent which being in the Heat of Action he could not do without Leave of his Captain but the Captain upon the News saluted the Prince and gave the Lieutenant Orders to attend him  When he was brought to the Duke  de Lorge  's Tent at his first Salute he presented his Sword and Pistols to him the Prince holding the Point of the Sword and the Muzzles of the Pistols towards himself which is the Custom in the Field when an Officer demands Quarter  The Duke  de Lorge  treated him with all possible Respect gave him back his Sword and taking his Parole gave him a Guard of two Captains to attend him but without any Restraint except that as he was under Promise it was understood that he was not to quit the Camp  After the first Ceremony the General ask'd his Highness if the People that took him had offered him any Violence or taken any thing from him the Prince told him no but that on the contrary the Lieutenant to whom he surrendered had with some Hazard to himself prevented two Troopers with whom he the Prince was engaged from wounding him first as well as rifling him afterwards  Upon this the General caused the Lieutenant to be called in and asking the Prince what the Value of what he had about him might amount to he said about a Thousand Crowns Immediately he made the Lieutenant  Captain of a Troop in the same Regiment he serv'd in and told him that was for the Service he had done the King then he gave him a Thousand Crowns in Money and told him that was for his Care of the Prince his Prisoner In return to this the Lieutenant pull'd off the Ring he had taken of the Duke as a Token and restored it the Duke took the Ring but the next Morning sent it him again and an Assignment on the Townhouse of  Nurembergh  for Crowns a Year during his Life  When the Prince had been some time at  Strasburgh  the King sent him an Invitation to come to  Paris  ordered his Journey to be defrayed all the Way ordered all the Governours of Towns to receive him as a Prince to shew him all military Honours to let him visit the Fortifications and to beat the Drums as he pass'd as if he had been a General of their own Army  When he came to  Versailles  he was treated with the same Generosity and with great Magnificence the King received him with the utmost Civility and Ceremony only told him he was obliged not to say he was glad to see him because of the Circumstances  He was invited to come often to Court and whenever he did come the Officers of the Kitchin had Orders to provide a Table for him the Master of the Horse had Orders to provide the Coaches for him and whenever he pleased to hunt the Querries furnished him with Horses Hounds and Attendance from the King's Stables  The King presented him with his Picture set with Diamonds and with a very fine Jewel and told him he was sorry his Ransome  was not sufficient to make it worth his presenting him with his Liberty but he hoped he would take the Freedome of going home whenever he pleased and in the mean Time all the Care possible should be taken to make him forget his Misfortunes  Valiant Aga may the Angel that keeps the holy Gate guard thee from falling into the Hands of the Enemies of  Mahomet  let Princes be thy Prisoners and the Swords of the mightiest of thy Enemies be delivered into thy Hands Cruelty is not in thy Nature happy will they be who fall into thy generous Hands who knowest as well how to be merciful to the Miserable as terrible to the Desperate  I must confess this courteous Usage of Prisoners is a generous Practice and very consistent with the fiercest and most vigorous Methods of making War and always has this Effect to the Advantage of those that practise it that it is a Debt which some time or other comes to be paid to Advantage  It is to be observed also that tho' the Prince had all possible Liberty to go where he pleas'd yet having pass'd his Parole  viz  to be a Prisoner he was obliged not to serve again or to appear in the Field again till his Ransom was paid or that he was exchanged according to the Cartel or Agreement for Exchange of Prisoners  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER IX To  Zema Ellmahannon  an old Dervice at  Damascus  THE Affairs of the World are not uncertain by a meer fortuitous Accident of Causes or in Obedience to the ill Fate of Men upon whom those Uncertainties fall but by the meer Course of Nature the necessary Event of things tending naturally to daily Revolution  Death the common Law of Nature is not an Accident to Life but a meer Consequence of Being every thing that has a Beginning must necessarily end otherwise it would be a monstrous Rupture in the Course of Nature  Nature it self is mortal it is a Machine made up of innumerable Consequences attending the first great Cause the Motion given it shall continue as long as the Hand which first put it together appointed it to go but when the Weights are once run down when the Clue is wound off all the Powers cease nothing can wind it up again  Hence those Philosophers here who follow the old Notion of  Epicurus  that the World was made or rather made it self by meer Chance by a fortuitous Conjunction of Atoms I say these Philosophers argue not only absurdly but even to the last Degree weakly and foolishly for having traced the Beginning of Nature to the Atoms or Particles of Matter flowing in the Abyss by whose Conjunction  and Attrition the beautiful Frame of the World has been made and its Motion perform'd I say they argue absurdly for they most ignorantly pass over the just Progress of the Inquiry who first gave Being to those Atoms which one Question destroys all their System according to that Distich of the Poet speaking of the Atoms jumbling together into the Frame of the World  Forgetting that some Power must first bestow  Existence on those Atoms that did so  They have another Fable here among the Naturalists but it seems not only an ignorant one but a very unnatural one  viz  That Man made himself I remember a learned  Arabian  at the holy City when in my Youth I attended the sacred Service with my Father I say a learned  Arabian  had a Debate with as learned a  Jew  on the Point I mention  viz  of a first Cause in Nature and coming down to the Being of Man the  Jew  urged an Argument which I now find much in Use in this Nation of Atheists and Deists among whom I live  viz  of Man being his own Maker  Why then  says  Amiaz Zebir Oglou  so was the ancient  Arabian  called why then says he  Man must be eternal  for what could give it self Life could certainly preserve Life and if Man is eternal says he then Man is God for whatever is eternal is God  The Ancients told a merry Fable of  Prometheus  who having made a Man of Clay stole Fire from the Sun to put Life into his Figure for which Felony say they he was condemned to be chained down to a Rock  where a great Vulture was always preying upon his Bowels  But looking into an  English  Poet lately where this Fable was mentioned as alluding to the ancient Principle of Atheism above I met these Lines drawn from the same reasoning as those above  The great  Promethean  Artist Poets say  First made the Model of a Man in Clay  Contriv'd the Form of Parts and when he had done  Stole Vital Heat from the Prolifick Sun  But not a Poet tells us to this Day  Who made  Prometheus  first and who the Clay  Who gave the great Prolifick to the Sun  And where the first Productive Work begun  I wonder often how these  Nazareens  who are nevertheless a knowing and learned People especially in these Parts I say I often reflect with Wonder whence this brutish Notion is derived I mean of denying the Being of a God and all the subsequent Notions of the World's Eternity Man's selfexistent Power and the like  Upon the whole I have resolved it into this that it is the natural Consequence of the Corruption of their own Religion for while their Priests set up here so many Absurdities and pay their Adorations to so many supposed Deities Men of Penetration frequently see through all the false Glosses of the Clergy and find it often a Legend of Forgeries a meer Bundle of Nonsense and Inconsistencies and then not being enlightened from Heaven with the sacred Knowledge of the true ONE God it leads them into a Contempt of all Principles  and their Religion dwindles away to nothing they begin in ridiculing their own Profession and then go on to the great Extream of denying even God himself  Such a Crime is never found among the Followers of  Mahomet  the first Principle of whose Religion contains a Confession of One God the Faithful are therefore called Mussulmans the Name we boast of signifying a Believer of the One God and of  Mahomet  his Prophet  The Light of the divine Oracle which inspired  Mahomet  shines into the Understandings of the Faithful and they worship the Creator of the World They neither kneel to a Piece of Bread nor worship an old Woman and call her God's Mother but declare to all the World that God is One God and to him alone we pray with incessant Prayers revolving the Moon and constant as the Day  Receive righteous  Zema  the Relation of the Blasphemies of these Mockers of God and pray to  Mahomet  that all his faithful Followers may be kept in the right Way  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER X To  Ali  Bassa Chief of the Engineers and Seraskeir of the  Morea  WHEN I wrote last to thee I gave thee an Account of the taking the strong Town of  Montmelian  in the Dominions of  Savoy  with some Description of the Fortress it self and bad thee to expect to hear from me again  According to my Word I here send thee true Drafts of the several Towns and the Sieges of them which have been carried on these last two Years by the  French  who are now certainly the best Masters in the World of the Art of raising Fortifications and of attacking them when they have done  The Fortifications of the Town and Port of  Dunkirk  I send thee as a thing by it self because I am inform'd the Grand Seignior has commanded thee to make a Port and Harbour at  Candia  which he designs to make the strongest City and the safest Harbour in the World  Thou wilt see by this Plan that the  French  Engineers had a Piece of Work to do here the Scituation of which did not appear to the Eye capable of being made to bear the Perfection of it they had a Harbour and Basin to build which the King resolved should be capable of receiving his largest Men of War some of which drew to Foot Water and the Channel of the Port they had to work it on had not above Foot Water at the  highest Tides and this upon a flat Shore where the Sea except at SpringTides scarce flow'd Foot in a Tide sometimes scarce flow'd at all into the Town  To bring this to Perfection the Engineers first considered a small River which pass'd through the flat Country above and emptied it self into the Sea at this Place whose little Channel scarce deserving the Name of a River made the Port  The first thing the Engineers had to do was to draw the Water of several other small Rivers which in their natural Course ran into the Sea at other Places on the Coast to join their Waters with this little Stream and then they laid the large Parts of low Land which you see mark'd in the Plan together for receiving the Quantity of Water when it should come in and stop it in this River when the Sluices were shut  Below the Conjunction of these Waters several large Sluices were made to stop their Course and swell them till they flow'd over all those Lands and so keep them up till a very great Head of Water was gotten together for the Uses of which I shall speak presently  When this Provision for a Backwater was first made then they went to work with the Channel of the Port which they cut Foot in Depth into the Earth deeper than it was before  To secure this Work and preserve the Depth of the Channel which the Sea would otherwise fill up even in one Tide it being a very flat and sandy Shore I say to secure this they built those two prodigious Jettes or Peirs which you see in the Draught which  ran out into the Sea no less than  Hemiza's  being almost an  English  Mile and a half even to low WaterMark form'd of an innumerable Number of Trees of an immense Size bound with Iron and sharpen'd at Bottom and driven with the Force of mighty Blows by a  Bolqueen  of a Ton Weight raised high in the Air and let fall at once They call these Trees here  Pilotis  These two Peirs being made solid the Spaces fill'd up with Stone and Chalk and the Heads joined together with Bars of Iron are firm as the solid Earth and breaking off the Violence of the Sea make the Space between a calm safe Channel into which when Ships were entred they were secured from any Hazards of Wind or Weather  They also took Care to preserve the Channel which as I have said was thus deep from filling up by the Sea and at the upper End of it and within the Fortifications of the Town a large Basin or Pool was made able to receive the biggest Ships and able to contain above Sail at the Entrance into which was a Sluice or WaterStop the Gates of which were Six and fifty Foot wide being a Work of that prodigious Expence and requiring so much Skill of the Engineer that some Workmen of very good Experience declared to the King it was impossible that Monsieur  Vauban  whose Undertaking the whole Work was could ever bring it to Perfection  But he laugh'd at them all and went on finish'd it and brought the Gates of that immense Sluice to so exact a Ballance that they are now made to open and shut by the Hands of two Men only  viz  one at each Gate  The Sluice first spoken of which kept in the LandWater now discovered its Usefulness and the exquisite Skill of the Workman for whenever the Channel seem'd to fill or the Sea cast any Banks of Sand up against the Mouth of the Peirs as it would have done in two or three Tides the opening this Sluice let go a mighty Stream of Water which they call a BackWater or Backcurrent which always keeps the Channel open to its full Depth  Thus this mighty Work is finish'd the Wonder of this Part of the World As to the innumerable Works for strengthning the Town the Risebank for farther strengthning the Port an immense Work advanced in the very Sea and founded also upon Piles yet made so strong as not only to carry Guns which are planted on its Parapet but to bear DwellingHouses and a Church or Mosque and so become a little Town of its self All this I refer thee for to the Plan of the Work which is without Question the most perfect Fortification in the World and if it ever should be attack'd as it will require an Army to defend it so they must expect to lose a good Army before it that attempt it  They are aware here that the King of  England  the most enterprizing Prince in this Part of the World has his Eye upon it especially since the Victory over the  French  Fleet has secured him the Superiority at Sea and therefore the Generals always keep a watchful Eye over it and very rarely have less than or Men in it or within Reach of it when the Campaign is over  The Fortifications of this Place including the Harbour  c  is said to have cost the  King of  France  Twenty Thousand Purses which in the Coin of this Country is called no less than an Hundred Millions of their Money  The Draft of this Place is worth thy Study and worthy the Hand of a Power immense and inimitable like that of the Grand Seignior half the Care and Art which is shew'd here would make the City of  Candia  which is so much envied by the  Nazareens  be the safest and most terrible Port in the  Levant  Success and Wonders be the End of all thy Undertakings and let the Glory of thy illustrious Lord be made more and more conspicuous by thy exquisite Performances The other Plans which I send thee I shall write of by thy Servant the  Chaioux Mustapha  who is here with me and who I shall dispatch in Twelve Days to the Kaimacham on Business of Importance  Paris  th Day of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XI To the Kadilescher of  Romelia  THERE has happened this Month a thing which as it is the subject Matter of Conversation all over the  Nazareen  World so it tends more to the personal Dishonour of the  King of  France  than any thing that I have ever heard charged upon him through the whole Course of a long and flourishing Reign  There has been a Conspiracy detected in the Confederate Army in  Flanders  to assassinate the new King of  England  the Conspiracy it self tho' odious and detestable in its Nature is not the main thing I take notice of to thee for such things are frequent among these  Nazareens  tho' not heard of among the true Believers of the One God the faithful Followers of  Mahomet  I say among the Mussulmans no such thing is ever heard of it is below the Dignity of Man as a Man to kill by Treason nor can the religious Principles of those who believe the Rewards of Paradise or the Torment of Fire permit them to think of such Practices without Horror Thank  Mahomet  it is only practised among Christians the Mussulmans abhor it  I say therefore I had not mentioned this Crime odious in its self even to humane Nature it is not the Fact it self which I insist upon but this in particular that there is great Reason to believe the King of  France  himself or at least his chief Ministers of State and they we know dare do nothing without his Orders have been discovered to be in the Design  It is scarce to be thought of without Horror and Execration that Men of Honour  as they call themselves here  should stoop to murther the Man they cannot conquer In all the Reigns of the  Ottoman  Princes or of the Caliphs of  Syria  in all the Days of the  Saracen  Empire the true Successors of our great Prophet  Mahomet  whose more righteous Law forbids  Rap'n Injustice and Blood no such thing has yet been left upon Record  Was it ever known that any of the Princes Followers of  Mahomet  ever sent an Assassinator or Murtherer to cut off a  Nazareen  Prince General or Commander of an Army by Treason tho' we esteem the  Nazareens  as Dogs Enemies of God and such as of right demand to be cut off from the Earth yet it is always attempted honourably by War and the Arm of Battle as open Enemies ought to deal with one another leaving the Sword to decide the Quarrel and God to direct as best pleases him  Never I say was any  Nazareen  Prince CaptainGeneral or other Enemy surprized on our Account by Treason and Murther These People value themselves upon the Name by which they pretend to be distinguished  viz  Christians and the King of  France  is called the most Christian King as if he was more a Christian or a better Man than other Kings but this Affair has sullied his Face and blackened his Character in such a Manner as all the other idolatrous Nations in the World would abhor and let them say what they will it seems to me that these assassinating Principles are not allowed at least not so much if at all by any People in the World but these Christians In the Name of  Mahomet  let them have the Praise of it let them be the only People in the World who deal in secret Murther  As to the King of  France  Men may call him the most Christian King as long as they please but if he gives Encouragement to such Villanies as these I dare pronounce  Caius Fabritius  a  Roman  Pagan a far better Christian  than the most Christian King for he being General of the  Romans  against  Pyrrhus  King of  Macedon  one of the stoutest Enemies the  Romans  ever had when the  Macedonian  Prince's Physician came and promised him to poyson his Master for a Sum of Money he not only scorn'd his Proposals but sent him with a Letter discovering his Treachery to the King to deal with him according to his Deserts  This was done like a  Roman  but the King of  France  like those who they call here Christians has not thought fit to act in such a generous Manner for Monsieur  Granval  who it was proved openly had undertaken the Business of assassinating the King of  England  had it seems been encouraged to and employed in this horrid Work first by Monsieur  Louvois  the first Minister of State to the King of  France  and since his Death by Monsieur  de Barbasieux  his Son with the Gift of Eighty Pistols a small Piece of Gold Coin which goes here for four Ducates and with the Promise of twenty Thousand Livres  per Ann  Reward when the Murther was committed  This it seems has been proved in the military Divan or as they call it here the  Court Martial  and the Person has been condemned and executed for it even himself not denying the Fact  Nor do they concern themselves much to deny it here or to disown that he was employed by the  French  Ministers for these are it seems above covering such things from the World not valuing the Censures of Men however just  There is a noble Principle in the Minds of wise Men which qualifies them to support the Censures and Reproaches of the World and  to receive the vilest Usage with the highest Contempt and this is an Attainment worthy of a good Man and makes a Man truly great but this is always built upon this Preliminary as a Foundation  viz  that the Charge is unjust as well as indecent that the Person is innocent for no wise Man can bear a just Censure if his own Heart reproaches him with the Crime his Face is covered with Blushes at the Censure and he sinks under the Weight of the Reflection as a Child does under the Stripes of his Preceptor  To contemn just Censure is the Token of a Face hardened by Crime grown wicked to a Degree above being touch'd by Conscience or Principles of Honour and is a Token not of a very wise Man but of a very wicked Man  It is with some Horror I write of this particular Circumstance if Kings can thus justifie the surprizing their opposite Princes with Murther and Assassination what need is there of making War It is enough to revenge the Injury done by the Hands of Villains and Assassinators and we may leave the Kings of the Earth to kill one another without engaging Armies of innocent People in the Quarrel  Men of just Principles abhor these things and indeed the King is exclaimed against universally in all Foreign Courts on this Affair At home here 'tis true People dare say nothing so they cast it all upon Monsieur  Barbisieux  and clear the King of the Scandal of it  If this wicked Custom prevails Kings are the most unhappy of Men they must live wrapt in Iron for the Day and sleep covered with Terrors in the Night the Dagger and the Pistol would be their daily Dread and as it was said of the first  James  King of  England  they would bewray Nature at the Sight of a naked Sword  It appears upon Record in the Histories of these Parts of the World that the Ancestor of this Prince the King of  England  was murthered in the same Manner as has been thus attempted now and that it was done in Consequence of the Proscription of his Enemy the King of  Spain  who publickly invited all the Men of villainous Principles of which the  Nazareens  never want Examples to murther the Prince of  Orange  promising a Reward of a Thousand Pistols to the Person who should kill him  But the whole World blamed the King of  Spain  for it even when he published the Invitation to Murther and several of the Princes even of the King of  Spain  's own Party openly protested against it but much more after the Murther was committed and the Murtherer confess'd that it was upon the hearing of that Proclamation that he undertook it I say from that Time the King of  Spain  was abhorr'd by all Men of Honour as a Tyrant a Man of Cruelty and a Murtherer nor did righteous Heaven prosper any of his Affairs after it  After all the King of  England  lives the Traytor has been put to Death and the Horror of the Fact has cemented rather than weaken'd the Confederacy nay it has fill'd the Enemies of  France  with that Animosity against her Management that it may be truly said of the King he has nothing to trust to but the Sword for the least and weakest of his Enemies are deaf to all Accommodations  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XII To  Ali  Bassa Chief of the Engineers and Seraskeir of the  Morea  I Am to thee like a Student in Divinity who I have heard much of among the  Nazareens  who being appointed in one of their Tetrehs or Colleges to read Lectures to the Scholars upon some of the Books of the old Prophets in the Law of  Moses  chose the Book called the Prophet  Isaiah  containing above Sixty Chapters and read Forty four Year upon the first Chapter and did not finish it neither  Thus designing in my last Letter to send thee a Lecture of Fortifications and Attacks upon all the Towns or Sieges which have been the Subject of Discourse here during this War I spent my whole Letter upon the Town and Port of  Dunkirk  and have done very little indeed towards finishing it either but thy mathematical Genius will supply the rest  Next to this Town I begin with the Town of  Mons  of the Siege of which I wrote formerly to the Port after thou hast surveyed the Works how regular how large how well scituated for Defence and how well defended by a resolute Garrison who fail'd in no Part of their Duty thou wilt perhaps wonder how it came to be carried as it were Sword in Hand that is to say in about Days after the Trenches were opened  But thou wilt be more fully satisfied when thou shalt observe some Marks I have made  in the Plan of the Siege by which it will be seen that the  French  began with draining the Morass which lies on one Part of the Town which the Confederates thought was impracticable and by which Means they came dryfooted to the Town on a Side where there were very slight Works the  Germans  believing that the Place was inaccessible on that Side  The Siege of  Namure  is the most remarkable in this Part of the Country of which also I have written particularly before The Castle is a very inaccessible thing and is defended by its Scituation which is not only raised high on the Summit of a Rock as you will see by the Plan but is seated in the Angle of two large Rivers the  Sambre  and the  Maez  like the City of  Belgrade  between the  Sauve  and the  Danube  But the Strength of this Castle is doubled by a Work call'd the  Cohorne  Fort which is a Royal Fortification built by one Monsieur  Cohorne  a  Flemish  Engineer and a Lieutenant General in the Confederates Army The Plan of this Fort will shew thee the Skill of the Engineer and the gallant Defence he made in it against the whole  French  Army will shew thee his Bravery but the Consequence of this Fort best appears by telling thee that the Castle however strong in it self made very little Defence after the Surrender of this Fort  The Plan of the Port of  Nice  and the City of  Villa Franca  as also of the Port and Town of  Roses  in  Rousillon  on the Frontiers of  Spain  as they have a great Similitude to one another and have both met with the same Fate  viz  to be attack'd by the  French  during this War so they will shew thee perfectly well how fatal an Error it is to leave Ports of such  Consequence and so capable of being render'd impregnable so naked and defenceless as both those Places were  This is a Mistake the  French  King is never guilty of whatever Town is taken by him is sure to get by the Exchange of Masters for he always makes it stronger than it was before and almost all the Frontier Places having been first or last in the Possession of  France  owe most of their Strength to his Diligence in fortifying them  This also is like to be the Fate of  Roses  and of  Nice  for the  French  Engineers are at work already upon them both and they tell us that  Nice  especially shall be made impregnable and the Harbour be made capable of receiving the largest Men of War and tho' he may do this yet 'tis odds but in Time he comes to render this Town up to the Duke of  Savoy  The Reason indeed of this Difference between the Towns possess'd by  France  and those possess'd by other Princes is chiefly this that the latter want Money and the King of  France  always abounds that the latter when they have Money care not to lay it out on such things and the other spares no Expence to make Places strong believing it  as it often times appears to be  the best Money he can lay out  I cannot but think the Frontiers of the Grand Seignior's Dominions deficient on this very Article how else could the effeminate  Muscovites  have reduc'd so important a Town as that of  Asoph  on the  Paulus Meotis  Had the King of  France  been possess'd of such a Fortress it would have been made as terrible as  Dunkirk  and it would never have been in the Power of any Enemy much less a contemptible  Nation of whom it usually was a Saying at the Port that they neither knew how to make Peace or War  I doubt not thou art forward enough to regulate these Matters and had the Royal imperial Mandate issued out to thee  Asoph  would long ago have been a Place as impregnable as any of the King of  France  's Ports are to none of which the Confederates have been yet able to approach through the whole Series of the War no not since they have boasted of their Superiority at Sea  Nor is our Lord the Grand Seignior whose Name I mention with Reverence bowing my Head to the Ground the Brightness of the upper Regions of Light be on his Head I say our mighty Emperor the Lord of the World is not unwilling to allow the Expence of necessary Fortifications to strengthen the Towns exposed to his Enemies but it has been the Negligence or Covetousness of the Viziers to whom the Emperor has committed the Charge of those things  Vigilant  Ali  thou art always awake to the Interest of thy Master and to the Glory of his Empire extended from the  East  to the  West  Seas I know that nothing escapes thy Observation I conjure thee by the Dust of happy  Icharrah  thy Predecessor whose Dwelling is in Paradise by the Bones of thy great Grandfather  Ibrahim  who was principal Engineer to  Solyman  the magnificent at the famous Sieges of  Rhodes  and  Maltha  by the brazen Gates of  Mecca  and the invincible Turrets of  Medina  let not the Hint I am now going to give thee be forgotten neither take it in evil Part from me who am anxious for the Glory of our invincible Lord  Achmet  Emperor of the World  Take it not in evil Part that I ask this important Question why is not  Belgrade  which is now fallen into the Hands of thy Lord why I say is it not made the most invincible Place on Earth  Thou knowest it is not and that it has all the Advantages by Scituation which can be desired two mighty Rivers wash its Walls with their furious Currents  viz  the  Sauve  and the  Danube  the Angle where they join is wholly taken up with the Town and Castle which are thereby utterly inaccessible on two Sides of three had the King of  France  this important Place his Engineers in spight of the hardest Rocks the highest Mountains the most impenetrable Parts of the Earth would long ago have brought the  Sauve  to have entirely surrounded the Town and to have embraced it with its divided Stream equally deep navigable and rapid like the other Part  Infinite Bastions Cavaliers Parapets Lines Courtins Tenails Ravelines Counterscarps Motes covered Ways Hornworks Crownworks Lunettes Retrenchments Redoubts  c  should have ere now so surrounded the Town as not to make it possible for any Army to attack it without the certain Ruin of their Infantry  When it was last taken the Works were generally speaking entirely demolished by the Blast of Powder which blew it up Why should not all the Plan of the Place have received a new Face and why not make it strong enough to be worthy the Name of the Bulwark of the  Ottoman  Empire  Flatter not thy self that the Power of thy Lord is so great that it will never suffer any Revolution or that the victorious Vizier can  never meet with any Foil these things are influenced by the secret destinated Appointments of him that guides thee and I and every Head that bears the Charge of a Soul and albeit that what is thus appointed shall not be revers'd yet such Agency as that of giving a Stop to the Enemies of  Mahomet  by the Assistance of humane Power is always allowed to be bestowed on the Faithful and the Aids of Art to support us in the Defence of the Dominions of our Emperor was always allowed not as lawful only but expedient at all Times leaving the Issues of things to God and  Mahomet  Rouze up thy self thou Man of Knowledge and apply thy self to strengthen this Frontier surround it with innumerable Works spare no Cost or Labour to make it a Terror of the  Nazareen  Empire extend it to such Limits that its Garrison may be an Army and that to invest it may require Men  Draw round it a treble Counterscarp I know the Scituation will allow it for the inmost Works are high as a Mountain and will overlook seven Descents below it  The two Heights of  Orwar  next the River  Sauve  will require a double Crownwork to surround them with a Parapet high as a Cavallier if it should be attack'd and suppose it should be carried Sword in Hand it is impossible an Enemy can make a Lodgment in it the Troops which shall be posted in the Mountain will pour in such Floods of livid Fire of Shot of Grenadoes  c  that nothing can support it  On the Side next the  Danube  the Hill  Ibrahim Bassa  readily guides thy Hand to erect a Royal Fort under its Protection no Ships from the  Danube  can batter it the Rock defending its Flanks the same Rock affording at the same Time a natural Line for Pieces of Cannon to cut off even the Navigation of the  Danube  and send to the Bottom the strongest Vessels which shall attempt to lie open to it  Glorious  Ali  why is not this City made the Bulwark of the  Ottoman  Empire Depend upon it as the Arms of the victorious  Kuprioli  have conquered this Fortress so the  Nazareens  will lose no Opportunity of recovering it and if once they are Masters of it again they will not fail to make it the strongest Fortress in the World  Then shall the Blood of the Faithful which it shall cost to recover it from the Infidels be laid to their Charge who neglected strengthening it while it was in their Hands  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XII To the Kaimacham  Note  This Letter should have been printed in page Book II and Letter XII in the same Book should have been placed here  WOnder not that I follow so soon my last Express with another Letter almost upon the same Subject The King of  France  is certainly the most politick Prince in the World he knew not only what was concluded against him at the  Hague  in the great Congress of Princes which I mentioned in my last and which met there the Beginning of the last Moon but he knew the Reputation that illustrious Appearance of Princes would give to the confederated Arms if they had leisure given them to go on as they began and therefore to give some sudden  Coup de Eclat  in the Infancy of their Alliance was not only the best way to weaken and disconcert them but also to lessen the Reputation of a Body monstrous like  Hydra  and composed of many Heads as well as many Members  However he lay still till the Prince of  Orange  had broken up his Congress and was gone to his Palace of  Loo  a House of Pleasure in the  Dutch Gueldre  where he design'd to pass the Time till the Season for taking the Field should call him away  But he was scarce gotten thither when Expresses in the Heels of one another brought  him Word that the  French  were making Preparations in all their FrontierGarrisons for some great Enterprize and that tho' the Season for Armies to take the Field was not yet by two Moons at least yet it was certain the  French  would march very quickly  This alarmed the Prince who was himself perfectly vigilant and as able to judge of the Designs of the Enemy as any Officer in his Army The  Hague  which but a few Days before was throng'd with Princes GeneralOfficers and Colonels of the Army was on a sudden an abandon'd desolate Place compared to what it was before the Governors of Towns and Provinces the Generals the Officers were all flown to their respective Commands as if they had been driven away with a Storm of Wind  Nor was it without Cause for in about ten Days after the first Alarm they found the  French  whose Motions are the swiftest of any Nation in the World were actually in the Field with Men and in less than Five Days more in Spight of the Severity of a terrible Season Difficulty of impassable Roads and of all the Inconveniencies of a WinterSiege they had invested the City of  Mons  the Capital of  Hainault  in the  Spanish Low Countries  This was the  th  Day of the third Moon  This Place is not only considerable in its self as it is a very strong Frontier but also as it secures a spacious Country which will be at the Disposal of the  French  if they succeed in their Design it is environed on every Side with good Fortifications except on that Side which is between the Gates of  Brussels  and  Aeh  where there is only a bare Wall secured by a large and deep Morass so that 'tis impossible  to be approach'd that Way But they say the Design of the  French  is to drain the Morass which being done the Town will be easily taken and to that Purpose as impossible as the Design seems to be yet they have got together Twenty Thousand Pioneers from all the Frontiers which they have set to work under the Protection of an Army of Sixty Thousand Men The Garrison is said to consist of Seven Thousand well disciplined Soldiers of which the greatest Part are  Germans  and besides them there is a great Number of the Townsmen well exercised in Arms who have promised to make a vigorous Resistance all under the Command of the Prince of  Bergues  who pretended to hold it out to the utmost nevertheless  France  made this Business a Point of Honour and there could be no Question but they will put as fair for it as possible the King the Dauphine most of the Mareschals of  France  and all the best Generals of the Kingdom were there to see the general Assault to which Purpose they have drawn out of  Germany  all their best Men in a Word it may be said that the whole Power of  France  is going to fall upon that poor City  The Prince of  Orange  came immediately back from  Loo  having staid there but two Nights Expresses flew like Posts riding on a Whirlwind to all the ConfederatePrinces for Help and all the Troops near Hand were ordered to the general Rendezvous  But  alas  what signified Troops in  Brandexburgh  the Land of  Hessia  or other remote Countries to an Army in full March and a Town already invested with Ten Thousand Horse The  French  secure of the Success pushed the Siege with the utmost Vigour and to  encourage the Soldiers by the Presence of so illustrious a Leader the King himself resolved to command the Siege he arrived in the Camp the  st  of the third Moon visited the Posts himself had an Officer killed with a CannonShot just at his Elbow and saw the Trenches opened before the Place in his own Presence on the  th  and on the th of this Moon the Town capitulated  The King of  England  drew together all the Troops which were within Reach and encamped at  Hall  not far from the  French  Camp but he never could get above Men together  The Town made a very vigorous Defence and the Garrison were reduced to Men but the Fury of the  French  could not be withstood who with a numerous Artillery beat down all the Defences of the Place and followed it with such continued Attacks not valuing the Lives of their Men that it was impossible to hold out  The Town having capitulated the  French  have put Foot and Horse into it as a Garrison and are retir'd into Quarters having thus cut their Enemies out Work enough in the Morning of the Campaign to keep them employed perhaps all the rest of the Time  As the King by this sudden Blow has been before hand with the Confederates so he lets them see that by entering the Fields so before the usual Time he will be always before them and that their Confederacy will have no Effect so long as they march every Country Troops back to their own Limits for WinterQuarters  But the King of  France  has not contented himself with this Advantage for on the Side of  Piedmont  he has done just the same thing taking from the Duke of  Savoy  the City of  Nice  and the Town of  Villa Franca  the principal Port that Prince had on the Side of the Mediterranean Sea  This Action was carried on with all that Secresie and Celerity which is peculiar to the  French  Conduct and in which they are a Pattern to all that would prosper in great Undertakings Monsieur  Catinat  a vigilant and fortunate General commanded the Expedition they began to draw the Troops together at  Thoulon  and the general Rendezvouz was between that Place and  Grace  a Town on the River  Vaar  they were all at the Place the  d  of  February  but the March being difficult they could not sit down before the Town till the  th  of  March  which however was so early in the Year that no Troops but those of  France  who conquer all kinds of Difficulties could pretend to take the Field  This City of  Nice  is surrounded with Forts Palanques and Fortifications at a Distance from it and on the particular Places which must be passed to come at it as first  Villa Franca  a Town about a League from  Nice  secondly the Fort called the Castle of  Villa Franca  thirdly the Fort of St  Hospitio  fourthly the Fort of  Montalban  then the City of  Nice  and lastly the Citadel all these Places were fortified and most of them especially the Castle of  Villa Franca  and the Fort of  Montalban  yet by the  th  in the Morning the  French  had master'd them all and sat down before the Citadel of  Nice  having brought also a Squadron of Men  of War to block up the Port by Sea that no Relief might get in  In a Word  Nice  had the Fate of  Belgrade  for a Bomb falling into a Magazine of Powder blew it up with three other Magazines killed of the Garrison demolished the best Part of the Fortifications and frighted the Governour and his remaining Part of the Garrison into an immediate Surrender  Thus this King makes himself a Terror to the World the Duke of  Savoy  is in a fair Way to be ruined and they say is desirous to make his Peace whether that be true or no Time will discover but 'tis certain if he does not or is not immediately assisted in a powerful manner by the Emperor his Destruction is not far off for the King of  France  reselves to give Monsieur  Catinat  Men to reduce him at once and make quick work of him on the other hand Monsieur the Duke of  Orleans  the King's Brother whose Daughter the Duke of  Savoy  has married has sent an Express to  Turin  to inform his SoninLaw of the Dangers that attend him and to advise him to take speedy Measures to accommodate his Affairs with the King offering his good Offices at the same Time to dispose his Majesty to his Interest but it seems the Duke is not so apprehensive as others are or has some secret Dependences which they are not informed of  However the King of  France  has by these two Actions so anticipated the Glory of the next Campaign that his Enemies have nothing to do but to try if they can regain in the Summer what he has taken from them in the Spring and he has nothing to do but to act upon the Defensive if he pleases till they are dispers'd again and then they may  expect him to fall upon them again just as before  I need not lay these things before thee as a Pattern the Success of the  Ottoman  Affairs against the Infidel Nations manifest that the Grand Vizier wants no Experience Vigilance Council for contriving or Vigour for Execution of his glorious Attempts may Glory and Vertue encrease his Fame and may the Sultan our Lord the inexhaustible Source of Magnificence and Lustre lift up his Head above the Kings of the Earth crowned with inconceivable Glory and the Light of an Hundred Thousand Constellations  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XIII To  Mahomed Elmaken  Student in History in  Trapezond  IF there is any thing to be gathered from outward Appearances the Desolations Nature works upon her self with her own Hands must be Tokens of the Anger of God upon the Nations Nature is never lunatick  Non compos mentis  or so out of her Wits as in the Frenzy to lay violent Hands upon her self If the Author of Nature does not lay his irresistible  Commands upon her to do so for the Punishment of wicked Men  Certain it is that in violent Tempests Hurricans or Tournadoes Eruptions of Fire and Water Earthquakes and the like Nature seems  Felo de se  she appears armed against her self tearing her own Bowels defacing her own beautiful Countenance and  in a Word  acting all the Parts of a Man who being demented by the Fury of a Disease a Fever or the like lays violent Hands upon himself  This has been a Year terrible in the  Nazaren  Nations for these things and particularly for Earthquakes of which there are some very affrighting Instances this Year In  Holland France Germany  and  Great Britain  as near as can be gathered the whole Body of the Earth felt a Jogg or two at the very same Moment of Time which tho' it did no harm yet it put all these Parts of the World into a most terrible Consternation  But in  America  they tell us dreadful Stories for Example that in the Empire of  Mexico  three and twenty Villages are overwhelm'd with great Part of the Inhabitants and a great Town called  Truxillo  almost quite demolished that in  Peru  a great Mountain sunk down into a plain Country and a great Hill rose up out of a Lake  But the most affrighting Story of all is that of the Island of  Jamaica  scituated in the Gulph of  Mexico  and now a Colony of the  English  who formerly took it from the  Spaniards  the principal Town or Port of this Island was called  PortRoyal  and of that Town the principal Part was called the  Point  being a Neck of Land running out into the Water like a  Peir this had upon it very fair Buildings and the principal Merchants of the Island resided there  It was in the Middle of the Day or rather a little before Noon when by a furious Earthquake one whole Side of that Neck of Land I mentioned which they called the  Point  sunk by a sudden and violent Earthquake and the Buildings having then no Foundation slid all down into the Sea so that above People were immediately swallowed up with their Habitations Goods and Effects  The Calamity of this Country is not to be express'd for in the other Part of the Island where the Dwellings were not swallowed up the Earth for several Days moved so violently that the People could not stand upon it even in the very Fields but lying down roll'd with it up and down the Earth like Vessels on the Sea and you may be sure they were all the while in the utmost Horror and Distraction expecting every Moment to be swallowed up alive  Certainly the Consternation must be inexpressible among the miserable Inhabitants for it was a Calamity which they had never felt before in the Place And since I am speaking of Earthquakes things which very rarely happen among the righteous Nations it is not improper to give thee a brief historical Account of some of the most remarkable Earthquakes which have happened in these  Nazaren  Parts of the World where they are more frequent than in any other Places  'Tis about Two Thousand and Sixty six Years ago that there happened one in  Achaia  which almost utterly destroyed it and which  was attended with Inundations which in the very Heart of  Corinth  delug'd the Cities of  Helice  and  Buris  of which  Ovid  makes mention in the  th  Book of his  Metamorphosis  Si quaereas  Helicen Burien  Achaeidas urbes  Invenies sub aquis adbuc ostendere nautae  Inclinata solent cum ma  ibus oppida mersis  Ovid Met  The last Year of the Two Hundred and Seventieth  Olympiad  the most Part of the Buildings of  Tyre  and  Sidon  were overturn'd and an infinite Number of People buried under their Ruines The third Year of the  Olympiad Rome  was shaken for three Days and three Nights together and  D rrachium  was levell'd with the Ground together with several Cities of  Campania  nay in our own Country I have read in the holy Writings of  Aaiada  that in the Reign of  Bajazet  II the mighty and most invincible Emperor there was an Earthquake at  Constantinople  that lasted forty Days and that during all that Time there was not an Hour past but the City suffer'd extraordinary Shocks so that the Grand Vizier by the Grand Seignior's Command employed Forescore Thousand Workmen to repair the City till by the Prayers of the Faithful Rest was obtained  In the Year of the  Nazaren  Account an Earthquake ruined a great Part of the City of  Naples  that of  Arian  a smaller City was swallowed up of the Sea and several other Towns utterly overthrown in that Part of  Italy  called  Calabria  In the Year there arose upon the Sea of  Ancona  together with a  thick gloomy Cloud that extended above two Miles a Tempest of Wind Water Fire Eightning and Thunder which piercing to the most deep Abysses of the Sea forc'd up the Waves with a most dreadful Fury and carried all before it upon the Land This afterwards caused as the Writers here testify so dreadful an Earthquake that the Kingdom of  Naples  was in a Manner quite ruined and all  Italy  carried the dismal Marks of it a Million of Houses Castles and Palaces were buried in their own Ruine above thirty thousand People were crush'd to Pieces by their Weight and a huge Mountain was overturn'd into the Lake  de la Guarde  in the  Milanese Joseph Acosta  relates that in  Peru  the Year there happened an Earthquake which removed the City of  Anguaquim  two Leagues from the Place where it stood without demolishing it in Regard the Scituation of the whole Country was changed And every Body has heard of the Earthquake which happened among the Mountains of the  Alps  in a Place called the  Valtoline  in the Year by the Violence of which a great Mountain near  Bigorre  sunk down into the Earth and was covered over with the Water of a Lake hard by but the greatest and most dreadful Earthquake was that which divided  America  from  Africa  and  Europe  for we read in  Plato  's  Timaeus  that they talked in his Time of an Island near the Pillars of  Hercules  that was call'd  Atlantis  bigger than  Europe  and  Africa  both together which by a horrible Earthquake and a Deluge of twenty four Days was swallowed up and covered with the Sea and never seen since Millions of People being destroyed with it and that the Sea which  swallowed it up has from thence been called the  Atlantick  Ocean to this Day  Some of the Ancients among these People have been of Opinion that the Earth was a great Animal and that the Shivering occasioned by some Distemper not unlike that of an AgueFit was the Cause of its trembling Father  Bourhours  one of their Priests here but an Author of Fame among them speaks many pretty things upon this Fancy in his Discourse of  Eugenius  and  Aristus  upon the Ebbing and Flowing of the Sea  The greatest of the Heathen Philosopher s accused the Stars of these Disorders upon the Earth and some of them expostulated with the Gods very earnestly on this Account but to speak one Word of the Causes of them in general I say that there are two which are natural and may very rationally be accounted for and it is most profitable to speak of such rather than of imaginary Causes that the subterranean Fires and Winds are the first Cause the Bowels of the Earth are full of bituminous Matter sulphurous and nitrous Particles SaltPetre and the like and when it happens that one Stone by secret Operation falling upon another strikes Fire by Collision or that Air penetrates in unusual Quantities those combustible Matters being kindled and the Winds blowing up the Flames they cause most terrible Overturnings of the Earth unless they find Outlets as in  Etna Vesuvius  and other Mountains whose opening Tops give Vent to the Flame The second natural Cause which I observe proceeds from the Water that is under the Earth which undermining the Foundations that support the subterranean  Vaults which extend themselves for several Leagues together in several Parts Those Vaults deprived of their usual Prop and overpress'd by their own Weight shrink down and all of a sudden impetuously pushing forward the Air and Water enclosed in the Earth give the upper Parts those violent and boistrous Jolts which quickly overturn the weaker Structures of humane Art which must of Necessity give way to those more than gigantick Impetuosities that rend and shatter the more solid Frame of Nature it self  Grave  Mahomed  thou who hast searched the most retired Parts of Nature art fully instructed in these things may that Power which uses these most furious Distortings of Nature as Weapons or Scourges in his Hand to correct Infidels preserve the Faithful in Safety that the Mussulman's Empire may be the Epitome of  Eden  and be the Retreat of the Universe whither the People may flee from the Deluges of Life and enjoy the Tranquillity of the Blessed  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XIV To  Simeon Ben Habbakkuk  a  Jew  at  Salonica  I Have just written at large to thy old Friend and mine  Elmakem  at  Trapezond  with an Account of a very terrible Earthquake which they say has happened at the Island of  Jamaica  in the Gulph of  Mexico  belonging to the  English Nazarens  It might be agreeable to thee to give thee an Account of the Particular of this terrible thing but thou art too familiarly acquainted with such things in the Country where thou livest to need any Information from me one Circumstance only I cannot omit because it relates to the People whom thou belongest to  The Earthquake there as the Relations which come from  England  and also others from the  French  Colonies in those Parts particularly at  Cuba Martinico  and the  French  Part of  Hispaniola  give an Account was very terrible and that in particular that after the first Shock which overthrew the capital Town of the Island for several Days the Earth rolled up and down like the Waves of the Sea that in sundry Places great Chasma's appeared the Earth parting and leaving several Openings gaping dreadfully to a frightful Depth  That the poor People amaz'd and terrified to the last Extremity lying in the open Fields expected to be swallowed up every Moment  and that some were even frighted to Death anticipating Death it self with the Apprehensions of it and confirming that just Notion that the Fear of any Evil is greater than the Evil it self like as the Desire of any Good is far greater than the Possession  I need not spend Time to inform thee of that who hast too just Notions and too large a Portion of Judgment not to know that what is present affects the Senses in a quite differing manner from what is to come what is present to us is seen in its genuine Form but what is distant and represented only by the Passions as by Fear or Desire is magnified to an infinite Degree as those Passions get the Victory over our Reason  But what Apprehensions of Death or rather of the World after Death produced the Effect I am going to relate to thee that I know not and leave to thee but the Fact is thus I am assured that the  Jews  for there are a great many Families of thy Nation in that Island I say the  Jews  in the Extremity of the Terror they were in upon Occasion of this Earthquake called upon Jesus the Son of  Mary  to save them  I have no Room to question the Truth of the Fact because divers  Jews  here have not only heard of it but do approve and justifie the Relation  If the Mussulmans who acknowledge Jesus to be the Messiah and that he was a Prophet ser from God as we acknowledge  Mahomet  also to be had in such a Calamity called upon any of the Prophets and upon Jesus also to assist them in that Extremity it might have been said it was because we do believe him to have been a just Man and that he was  ordained of God to be one of the six great Masters of the Law of God an Oracle of Truth and one of the Instructors of Men Certain it is we give a just History from God how that he has caused the Truth and the Doctrines of Righteousness to be instituted by six Oracles  viz  the Oracle of  Adam  handed on by oral Ministration to the Deluge the Oracle of  Noah  forming the Institutions of divine Worship to the renewed World the Oracle of  Abraham  whose Preaching and Institutions was received by all his numerous Posterity who were Founders of many Nations and from whose Bowels our Ancestor  Ishmael  is descended the Oracle of  Moses  whose Law was prescribed to your Nation only the Oracle of Jesus whose Institutions howbeit they are profess'd by his Followers have yet suffered so many Corruptions Interpretations and Addition of humane Inventions that the pure Professors of his Law are very rarely found and very difficult among so many Professors to be known and the Oracle of  Mahomet  whose Light and Empire is spread over three Parts in four of the discovered World  But how inconsistent must it be for thy Nation who have condemn'd this Jesus as an Impostor and would as we believe without Question have put him to Death had not God took him I say how inconsistent must it be with that Hatred of him which they profess'd to call upon him in their Trouble wherefore O  Simeon  consider and judge of these things with righteous Judgment for if God has owned the said Jesus to be his Prophet and you continue to despise him you ought to take this for a Judgment from Heaven upon your Infidelity  that the  Jews  were brought by his invisible Power in the Extremity of their Terror to recognize the Messias in the Person of that Jesus whom you had intentionally at least murthered before  Be wise then and cease to adhere to the Oracle of  Moses  and the Talmudic Systems of thy misguided Rabbies seeing other Oracles have succeeded by the Appointment of God every one exceeding each other in Purity and Excellence as the Oracle of  Moses  likewise in his Days excelled all those which were before him  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  The End of the THIRD BOOK  A Continuation of LETTERS written by a Spye at  Paris  BOOK IV  LETTER I To the SelictarAga or chief SwordBearer  _I Was ordered by  Isuff Bassa Reis Eff'endi  in case of his being gone a Journey to  Bagdat  to negotiate a Peace with the  Persians  as I find he is to write to thee what I had purposed to say of the Affairs of these Parts of the World it is always of Importance for the principal Secretaries prime Ministers Statesmen and Managers in the Court of our illustrious Master to know the minutest Matters relating to Government to Peace and to War how much more then the important  Affairs in the Court of the greatest King in these Parts of the World whose Actions none can imitate whose Glory is only outshin'd by the Mirror of superior Glory the Lustre of the sublime the ever great and resplendent Grand Seignior whose Days be happy and his rising every Morning victorious  If one may guess by the encreasing Power of the King of  France  by his Vigilance and Application to the Business as well of War as of Government if one may calculate from the immense Treasures he lays up the Numbers of his Armies the Vigor of his Councils the Experience and Bravery of his Generals the early Motion of his Troops and from the Progres  of his Arms the last Year it would intimate that this must be a Year of Wonders  It is true that the King of  England  is a resplendent Star encreasing in Magnitude a Prince whose martial Genius fills the World with Expectations gives Vigor and Spirit to the Soldiery is the Life of the Confederacy and is not to be discouraged by the greatest Repulses but still he amasses Troops raises new Armies encreases the Numbers of his Confederates and causes every Day new Enemies to rise up to the King of  France  But the King of  France  bullies them all and appears equal to their greatest Designs superior to them in Numbers and above all superior in the exquisite Administration of all his Affairs as well Civil as Military  Men always believed the King of  France  would outdo the ancient Giants in the desperate Efforts of the present War nay considering who he has to engage with it must be so or he must fall under the Weight of so many Enemies but it was thought also that his  Treasure would fail him before his Troops and that he must be at last exhausted and enfeebled that way  But he disappoints them all that way too for he finds such ways to raise Money and that in such immense Quantity that 'tis almost incredible his Enemies boast that he raises it with Difficulty which indeed is true but what is that to their Purpose seeing difficult or not difficult he does raise the Money Indeed such is his Skill to direct his Demands of Money and his absolute Power to enforce those Demands that his Officers will tear it out of the Bowels of the People so long as there is any Silver in the Kingdom  When I look on the Application of this Court to raise Money how intense upon it and how absolutely necessary it is to them to have it I have wondred they have not thought of empting the wonderful Lake of  Thoulouse  This is a great standing Pool of Water near the City of  Thoulouse  into which they tell us that the ancient  Gauls  after they had sack'd the Temple of  Delphos  threw an Hundred and Ten Thousand Pound Weight of Gold and five Millions of Pounds Weight of Silver on its being suggested that it was sacrilegious Wealth and that the Gods were angry with them 'Tis true that  Cepio  the  Roman  Consul got up a great deal of it some Ages afterwards and carried it away but a modern Geographer of this Place tells us there is a great deal still left which the People of  Thoulouse  would fain have been fingering but that they were still frighted with Devils and Monsters of all kinds now the King of  France  who has so many Dragoons that fear neither God nor the Devil might easily make himself Master  of it or if this failed one would think that all the sacred Reliques in  France  should turn to a vast Account he had better sell them than squeeze out the very HeartBlood of his Subjects there's half St  Peter  's  Beard  at  Poitiers  would be worth to him half a Million of Money and the Shrines of the Apostles at St  Stephens  in  Thoulouse  would suffice to furnish him for seven Years together But this by the way  The King of  France  has not only very exquisite Methods of raising Money but the Oeconomy of his Government is such that when it is raised it is always applied to the proper Uses we never hear of Embezzlements and Misapplication among his Finnanciers or Treasurers and by this punctual Management of his Treasure he has this Advantage that his Troops are always in the Field before his Enemies let them make the utmost Speed they can  This he threatens them with on all Hands this Year and tho' I am now writing to thee but in the second Moon we see already his Cavalry new mounted his Houshold Troops new clothed his Recruits distributed and most of his Armies in a Condition to march while some of the Confederates are little more than got home into their WinterQuarters and I am mistaken if we do not see him give them some considerable Blow before they can get into the Field  Every Year he encreases his Troops and it is said that this Year he adds sixty Thousand Men to his Armies besides a prodigious Number wanting to recruit his old Regiments expect therefore I shall in a little while send the News of some  Coup de Eclat  on this Side  Fail not also to communicate to the Grand Vizier that the  French  resolve to push the Emperor so vigorously on the  Rhine  that he may expect few Troops will be spared to go to  Hungary  this Summer and the  Germans  talk already of bringing Six Thousand Horse away from the hereditary Countries which is the same thing as from  Hungary  Thou knowest wise and penetrating Commander what Advantage the happy Port ever made of the intestine Broils of the  Nazarens  the very first Rise of the  Ottoman  Name deriv'd from the Weakness of the Christian Princes and that Weakness from their being divided one against another Wisdom rises upon the Ruines of Folly in all Ages and Places in the World whether Personal or National  Let the  Ottoman  Glory still rise and while the Hands of Infidels and Idolaters are thus lifted up against one another let the Faithful embrace the Occasion and advance the Mussulman's Empire till it spread the Face of the  German  Dominions and strike Terror into the Heart of this great Emperor of the  French  who at present bids Defiance to the World and can never be effectually reduced till the Question lies between him and the glorious Emperor of the World  Paris  th of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER II To the Grand Mufti  I Once gave a brief Recapitulation of the History of Earthquakes to thy holy Slave  Elmakem  at  Trapezond  my Letter was occasion'd by looking back with Horror and Regret on the Convulsions of Nature which I have lately met with of that kind particularly some remarkable and dreadful Casualties which have happened in these few Years time in these Parts of the World  Here is now a new and most dreadful Return of this particular kind happened in  Italy  and the Island of  Sicily  I intimated in my Letter to  Elmakem  how these kinds of God's Judgments seem peculiar to these Countries Thou wilt say so too when thou shall hear the following Story which is just now come to Hand It was the Ninth of the First Moon about Four of the Clock in the Morning that a terrible Farthquake was felt at the City of  Messina  in  Sicily  The Protection of  Mahomet  be upon every true Mussulman for certainly the like of this Earthquake was never heard of especially in some of the most dreadful Parts of it of which such undoubted Authorities are brought that there is no Room to question the Truth Take the Heads of it as follows  viz  At first it did no Damage only that it shook the whole City in a most frightful Manner and terrified the People most strangely the greatest Part of them fled to the Fields the  rest run to the Moschs to make their Prayers however in about three Hours it went off for that Time But the third Day after it returned with such Fury that the whole City was terribly shatter'd the Violence of the Shock in a Moment overturn'd Four and Twenty Palaces and endanger'd all the rest of the Buildings all the People throng'd to the  Dome  that is the chief Mosch where the Archbishop preached and gave that provoking Insult upon the One God called ABSOLUTION as did also such is their Delusion here a great Number of their Dervices dispers'd for that Purpose into all the Quarters of the City After this every Body thought of nothing else but escaping from the Danger by retiring into the Country those who could set up Tents were safe from the Injuries of the Weather But many of the others were destroyed the Air being all on a Flame by Reason of a most terrible Thunder and continual Flashes of Lightning But this is but the least Part of this Story for notwithstanding the great Damages done to this City it was nothing to what many others received the Towns of  Faormina Maseal Madica  the Cities of  Agousta Catanea Syracuse Carlentino  and several other considerable Cities Towns and Provinces are utterly ruined  Agousta  is become a meer Lake by Reason of a Rupture which the Sea made into that Part where the Houses stood while at the same Time the Lightning flashing into the Fortress of the City blew it up into the Air  Catanea  was utterly overturned and Sixteen Thousand Persons were buried under the Ruins of the great Mosch only the  th  and  th  two fresh Jolts gave new Alarms but without Damage Nor is the News from  Palermo  less  surprising but I have not yet the Particulars all that is known at present is that the Palace Royal is quite overturn'd and the ViceRoy had much ado to escape to the Galleys it may be truly said that  Sicily  is utterly laid waste as also the lower  Calabria  being a Country in the Southermost Part of the Kingdom of  Naples  'Tis thought that above a Hundred Thousand Persons are destroyed in this dismal Calamity besides above Twenty Thousand wounded  With this I must inform thee a little of the Wickedness of the audacious Priests in that Country on this Occasion in particular  viz  that as  Messina  received less Damage than the other Cities and for that the People in that Country are very superstitious the Monks who understand how to make their Advantages of the Simplicity of the CountryPeople spread abroad a Report at the Time of the Earthquake that the blessed Virgin  so they call Mary the Mother of the Prophet Jesus  had revealed to a young Girl of Nine Years of Age in that City who was her particular Favourite that by Means of her Intercession she had obtained that the City of  Messina  which is under her Protection should not be destroyed in the common Calamity with the rest and this has caused a Thousand idolatrous Extravagances among them in Gratitude to this Woman they have drest up her Effigie or Image in all the Moschs deck'd with Jewels of an inestimable Value they put a Crown upon her Head and impiously call her  Queen of Heaven  and all the City old and young flow into the Temples to say their Prayers to her  Allow me transcendent Mirror of Piety Image of the divine Prophet allow me to  express my Abhorrence of such execrable Idolatry blaspheming the ineffable Glory of the One great God who has said  before me only shall Men worship  I frequently talk to them of this Woman  Mary  and grant to them she was highly honoured in being the Mother of their Prophet but I challenge them to shew me one Word in all the Institutions even of their Prophet himself directing his Disciples to worship her or empowering her to any Part of the Office of an Intercessor in Heaven much less crowning her as a Queen who was her self a poor humble Wife to a mean and a laborious Mechanick but they grow angry and cross themselves as if they saw the Devil when I talk thus and calling me Hugonot tell me if I was in  Italy  I should be sent to the Inquisition so I talk of something else  But to return to the Story The Citizens of  Catanea  found to their Cost the Impotence of the like ChurchPageantry for tho' the Dervices there brought forth the Image of St  Agatha  another old Woman who they have made an Idol of too and who they call Patroness of that City and that many Thousand of the poor frighted People fled after her to the great Mosque or Cathedral grovelling on the Ground on their Hands and Knees to their Saint yet they were all involv'd in the general Destruction for the whole Cathedral being transvers'd by the Earthquake the poor Votaries with their Saint were buried in the Ruines of that very Church they fled to for Safety It is said no less than People chiefly Women Children and Priests perished in that one Mo  que  There is not so much as one Edifice left standing in that whole City infinite Numbers of People are maimed and bruised besides those who are kill'd and very few escaped but such as got into the Fields for as for the Sea it retreated above two Miles from them by the first rising of the Earth  Immortal Prince of the Priests of  Mahomet  fill all the faithful Mussulmans with a just Contempt of the Idolatry of Infidels for which no doubt these Strokes of the Anger of the great  Alla  the God of Thunder is fallen upon them  Paris  th of the st Moon of the Year  LETTER III To  Hassan El Abmenzai  Steward to the Sultanness  Alfaraiza  IT is the Sum of humane Misery to have no Body to communicate our Joys and Griefs with The Heart is not able to contain its own Excesses but they will break out and if we have not a Friend to unburthen the Soul to it will discover its Burthen in every Line of the Countenance  Old  Nathan  the  Jew  furnish'd me with an Equivalent for this Violence of the Mind  which was a kind of a Charm repeating a certain Number of Words in a Corruption of the  Syriac  Tongue and then to tell my whole Story with my Face towards the Sun as if I were talking to a particular Friend  But all these things have appeared empty Shadows to me and my Heart has been ready to burst for these thirteen Moons past with the violent Agitations of Joy and Despair revolving in their Turns equally strong and equally unsupportable  It was next to impossible for me to conceal the Transports of my Soul when I had by three several Expresses from the Port the most comforting agreeable News that the Grand Seignior the Lord of benign and heavenly Council the merciful Rewarder of his faithful Slaves had heard my repeated Prayers and had granted me licence to return to the Graves of my Fathers and to close an Age of Misery and Retirement with the Consolation of the Faithful  viz  to die at the Feet of our great Prophet kissing the Steps of his Tomb and the Dust of the Feet of ten Millions of Pilgrims  This happy News was seconded by another no less agreeable from the  Reis Effendi  wherein he congratulates my compleating my Desires and gives me the Name of my Successor  viz Ali Mezzawar  of  Damascas  my old Friend and Acquaintance who has for many Years resided for the Service of the illustrious Port among the reconciled Rebels of  Algier  At the same time that this happy News made glad my Heart I received Letters from  Ali  himself to whom a Chaioux had been sent with Orders to him to repair to  Paris  intimating how readily he would obey  those Orders and that he was just taking Ship for  Marseilles  in order to come to  Paris  Judge you my Friend how surprizing all these good Tidings were to a Soul ready almost to fly out of its Prison at the first Account of it and who had lived eleven Moons in the most perfect State of Satisfaction that it was possible for me to represent to my self in the World insomuch that I fed as it were upon the Air of Expectation with a Mind satisfied even to a Surfeit of Contentment  Nay as if Fate intended to sport with my Misfortunes and I was still to be made more miserable than any Man was before me I was still lifted up higher to add to the Weight of my Fall and to dash me utterly in pieces by the Force of it In a Word my Deliverer arriv'd and I received a Letter from him dated at  Marseilles  where he landed assuring me that he lost no Time to come forward and promised himself a singular Pleasure in dismissing me and setting me at full Liberty for my Return  Is it possible that all this could be an  Ignis fatuus  to ensnare my Mind and plunge me in the deepest Despair was there any thing now but the single Hazard of Mortality between me and my Deliverance who would not have looked upon himself as a Freeman and have begun to truss up his Baggage to depart  But see the Product of surprizing Decrees the next Letter I received was from  Chalons  where my dear Friend was taken sick and sent an Express a faithful Messenger to desire me to come to him thither for that he was dangerously ill  It was with a Surprize of Grief that I received this Account and immediately I posted  to  Chalons  but it was with an inexpressible Sorrow that when I came to him he had but just Life left in him enough to know me and being not able to speak expired in my Arms  Thus all my Comforts are blasted at once and the Hopes I had entertained of being see free from the diconsolate Circumstances I am in are entirely cut off  It was with great Secrecy that I caused his Body to be washed with clean Water and having hired a Carriage which they call here a Hearse I embalmed the Corps and caused it to be put into a Coffin of Lead and went away with it as travelling for  Paris  When I came upon the Road to a Place where the Ways parted sloaping one towards the Right and the other towards the Left I discharged the Hearse and its Attendance having told them that another Hearse was to meet me there and so setting the Coffin upon the Ground they went their Way Here with a just Solemnity of Tears I buried my deceased Friend laying the Coffin on one Side with his Face towards the sacred Repository at  Mecca  that he may awake again with his Eyes directly against the golden Gate at the Entrance into Paradise  And now I am a disconsolate Mourner indeed condole with me my Friend  Hassan  and deliver the Letter here inclosed to the  Reis Effendi  that I may obtain another Successor and may not die here among  Mahomet  's Enemies and my Dust be blended with that of Infidels Enemies to  Mahomet  Blasphemers and Idolaters  Think of  Mahmut  O you my Friends who have the Joy of being surrounded with the Temples of the Faithful and who say your Prayers  in their just Courses to the great Prophet and to the great One God the common Father of all the true Mussulmans think what it is to be excluded from the Society of the Blessed and left to starve here with the Hunger of disappointed Expectations  Paris  th Day of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER IV To the Mufti  THESE  Nazarens  are the most addicted to Fiction and Forgery of any People that ever I met with it is a received Custom among them that whenever they have to do with any Sect or Opinion of People differing from their own the first thing they go about is to represent them as monstrous and unnatural either in Person or in Principle or perhaps in both dressing them up in ridiculous Shapes and imposing a Thousand Stories about them upon the Credulity and Ignorance of the Vulgar that they may entertain immoveable Prejudices and Aversions against the Persons and Principles they profess  It would amaze thee illustrious Prince of Wisdom to hear what absurd romantick Tales what imaginary Histories and what innumerable forged Stories they tell of our sublime  Prophet  Mahomet  in what Colours they represent him and the sacred Institutions of our Law which we are satisfied were handed from Heaven to us by his Ministration  What fabulous Miracles they muster up to be pretended by him how he used Sorcery and Witchcraft and feigned the Inspiration of the Spirit of God by the Help of a Pidgeon how his Tomb in which is his Coffin hangs suspended in the Air between Heaven and Earth and what strange Inspirations and Agitations he was represented by to his Followers all which the true Mussulmans disown and take no Notice of  We have a famous Instance of this just now among themselves in the Court of their horrible Inquisition where they dress the People up whom they determine to the Flames in Coats painted all over with Devils and tormenting Spirits to fill the Minds of the People with Horror and Detestation at the poor Victims determining them to be Enemies to God and his Church hating and abhorring them as such without enquiring into any thing of which they are accused  There is another Example of their Injustice in the Story of Father  Molinos  a Dervice of great Fame among them and who they call the Quietist because he placed the Sum of Religion in the secret Contemplations of the great One God and declared against the Pageantry of Worship with which the  Nazarens  abound  I cou'd not doubt but thou wouldst be pleased with some Account of this extraordinary Man of his Principles and of his End which has been in the Prisons of the Inquisition where he was condemn'd to remain during  Life his Name was  Michael de Molinos  a  Spaniard  by Birth and of a very good Family and Fortune  He betook himself to study from his Youth wrote several Books before he commenc'd a Dervice or Priest In the Year he publish'd one of these Books under the Title of the  spiritual Guide  which won him the Esteem of several Cardinals or such as afterwards were made Cardinals as the Cardinals  Coloredo Attieri Petrucii  the last of which  Molinos  call'd his  Tomotheus    Cassanata Azolini  and  Carpegna  together with Cardinal  d'Estrees  who of all the rest was he who most familiarly visited him and shew'd him most Affection and Tenderness but at last betrayed him This Book he wrote argues very strenuously against  Pennances Mortifications Visions Extasies vocal Prayers  the Abuses of Confession and the Insipidness of Catholick Sermons and Books and in a Word against all their ecclesiastick Frippery by which they carry on the Cheat of their Religion at  Rome  among the People and from whence they spread the Fraud over the World  The next Year Cardinal  Odeschalchi  being created Pope under the Name of  Innocent  XI was no sooner install'd but he gave apparent Marks of his Friendship to  Molinos  by open Familiarity with him lodging him in the  Vatican  and conversing with him on Affairs of the greatest Consequence which acquir'd him the Respect of all Men and his Method was so applauded at  Rome  that except the Jesuits the most Part of the Confessors followed it and caused their Penitents to quit their Rosaries and betake themselves to mental Prayers and a contemplative Life Cardinal  d'Estrees  also that he might contribute to the Propagation of this Doctrine caused to be translated out of  French  into  Italian  a certain Book entitul'd  An easie way to raise a Soul to Contemplation  and at the same Time Father  Petruci  publish'd several Letters and some Treatises upon the same Subject If ever there was any real Danger that the  Nazarens  should return to the first Principles of their Prophet Jesus and worship God in the Spirit if ever the Fraud of Popes and Cardinals was in a way to be effectually overthrown in a Word if ever the Popes and popish Tribe were like to turn Hugonots now was the Time but the Jesuits who were too cunning not to see the Danger and to ward off the Blow finding the new Doctrine of  Molinos  get Ground and that all People forsook the  Confessionals  thought it Time to lay about them and therefore taking the Alarm in behalf of Religion they first branded  Molinos  for a Heretick and accused him for denying the Trinity so they call their Doctrine of three Persons or as we call it of three Gods maliciously inferring that his Maxims tended to the destroying the Humanity of their Prophet Jesus they likewise insinuated that he was an Enemy to Prayer because he affirmed  that the Perfection of the Soul  isted not in speaking nor in thinking of God but in the loving him after an extraordinary Manner▪  They accused him that he made all Christians indifferent because he adds  that Men ought not to disturb themselves when they fall into any Transgression but to make their Advantage of  This was occasioned by a Prayer which he calls a Prayer of  Quietude  and the Maxim they called Heresie is now called  Quietism  These Accusations  and some others made such a Noise that the Inquisition took Cognizance of 'em but the Office for that Time found nothing blameworthy in  Molinos  or in his Doctrine besides the Pope gave a Bishoprick to Father  Petrucii  who was one of  Molinos  's most zealous Disciples This put the Jesuits almost out of their Wits so that they caused a Report to be whisper'd about that the Bishop being a  Spainard  he might as well be of the Race of the  Jews  but this did not hinder the Number of the  Quietists  from encreasing every Day  However as I said above the Cardinal  de Estrees  influenced it seems from hence for the Jesuits have all the Power here in  France  betrayed him and from his greatest Friend became his Accuser and Enemy and left not till he got him into the Prisons of the Inquisition where he ended his Days for it is no easie thing for any Man to get out of such Hands when he is once abandon'd of his Protectors let his Quality be what it will or his Innocence ever so clear  I think this Man was brought to the Entrance of Truth and had he been enlightened by the Beams of  Churuth  and the blessed Vision of  Alluzared  the Angel of Paradise had he been guided so as to come into the Society of the Faithful he would have been a just and a wise Man qualified for the immortal Contemplations of  Ha  imut  and the Plains of Illumination but as he was so near the Truth it could not be expected that he should escape the Persecutions of the Sons of Error  Enlightened Guide to immortal Truth bless the Eyes of those who searching after sublime Contemplation are raised above the Enjoyments  of Life and give themselves up to the Enquiry after exalted Wisdom  Paris  th of the d Moon of the Year  LETTER V To the Grand Vizier  THE Devil must certainly deal with the  French  Kings Generals whether the  French  King deals with the Devil or no that I cannot tell It is true his new great General the Duke of  Luxemberg  of whom I am now to speak has been charg'd with it and many Accounts have been made publick about his being a Sorcerer that he was invulnerable and that the Devil had engaged to keep him free from Sword and Gun for a certain Term of Years  I do not affirm these things but as it is certainly true that the  Nazarens  have some People among them so abandon'd of Heaven as to enter into secret Compacts with Hell what Wonder if those who are already deluded into Infidelity should be capable of the Extremes of all Delusions and outdo those Nations in Wickedness who never heard of a divine Law or a sovereign divine Being  But to return to the Duke of  Luxemberg  they do not indeed stick to say here that he is a Witch or Wizard and that he has a secret infernal Correspondence but they do not say that he is any forwarder for that to expose himself to Sword or Gun or to venture his Flesh farther than other Generals when he comes to Action  But he does the greatest things in the Field and is so much master of Fortune that the amaz'd People stand and look on with Surprize and say he deals with the Devil He has now given the greatest Blow to the Confederates that ever they have yet received and contrary to the Expectations of all the World has first drawn the confederate Army into that irrecoverable Oversight of dividing their Army and then forcing them to fight with an Inequality of Forces  The King of  England  who is now very justly esteemed the greatest General the Confederates have has been always forward to bring the  French  to a Battle eager to fight but vigilant not to be taken at an Advantage but however vigilant he was the Duke has overreached him The two Armies lay encamp'd upon the little  Mehaign  a River on that Side of the  Netherlands  next to  Namure  their Numbers about Men on a Side not much odds on one Side or other  The  French  General having taken  Huy  before the Confederates could come up to relieve it made evident Shews of attacking the City of  Liege  where there was a Garrison but as the Place was large and not capable of Defence the King of  England  sent away in several Detachments about Battallions of Men with Orders to encamp under the Cannon of the Town and  fortifie themselves which they did so strongly as not to be attack'd but in the Forms of a Siege The Duke made shew of falling upon them with his whole Army and in the mean time the Mareschal  d'Harcourt  lay with a Body of Men as a flying Camp posted at a Distance from the Army towards  Huy  and this obliged the King of  England  also to make another strong Detachment to watch his Motions  These Detachments reduced the Confederate Army to about Men the D of  Luxemberg  taking hold of this Advantage faces about with his whole Army at the same Time giving secret Orders to the Mares  d'Harcourt  to decamp with all possible Secrecy with his Cavalry only which were Squadrons and join him which he perform'd so well as to come up in the Heat of the Battle while the other Body sent to observe him knew nothing of his March  Thus every thing conspir'd to give the  French  the Advantage The confederate Army tho' inferior in Number was composed of some of the choicest Troops in those Parts of the World pick'd select Regiments out of all the Nations concern'd and led on by the greatest Generals they had such as the Prince of  Orange  whom the World now calls King of  England  tho' we do not here give him that Title a Prince whose Courage and Gallantry they speak very well of here tho' they hate his Person also the Elector of  Bavaria  was there and a World of Princes and Noblemen of all the Nations concern'd in the War  They had about half a Day's Notice of the Battle and some blam'd the King that he did not retreat but in Truth he had not Time for the  French  would have been upon him before  it had been possible to have carried off his Cannon and Baggage and would have put all in Confusion so he resolved to fight  Nothing more surpriz'd the  French  than to find that when they view'd the ConfederateArmy over Night they saw them drawn up in Battalia in the open Field but in the Morning when the Fight was to begin found them entrench'd up to the Teeth with a regular Parapet in Front and in a Posture not to be attack'd without infinite Disadvantage  Then it was that the Duke was advised to retire and give it over but he was gone too far to retreat with Honour and resolved to attack them cost what it would  Never was a more terrible Fight 'tis in vain to describe it to thee it would take up a Book not a Letter The Attacks were so furious the Defence so resolute and obstinate that nothing that is humane can be supposed to do more the  French  found every Avenue so guarded every Regiment so well posted seconded and supported that they saw it impossible to penetrate any where but in one Village and there the Flower of the ConfederateTroops were posted so that the Resistance was terrible  They attack'd this Village with such Fury that they drove out or cut in pieces all the Troops posted there but in a Moment fresh Troops attack'd them again and drove them out with the same Fury and Slaughter  Judge illustrious  Ali  thou who hast seen the most bloody Attacks and the most obstinate Defences at  Bude Belgrade  and all the other great Actions of the War in  Hungary  where thou so often hast repell'd the Fury of the  Germans  to their Confusion judge what  Slaughter must be the Consequence of taking and losing this Village three times in this Manner in the Space of about five Hours  At last the Duke of  Luxemberg  putting the Sum of the whole Battle upon this one Action came on the third Time and carried the Village succouring his Troops so well and supporting them with such Numbers that they could not be dislodg'd and when the King of  England  would have attack'd them again he found some of his best Troops so discouraged by the Danger of the Service that they did not do their Duty nay as it is said refused to march  Upon breaking in here the Duke of  Bavaria  press'd the King to give it over who was himself leading up his own Guards  English  and  Dutch  to drive the  French  back but the Duke assuring the King that the  French  had entered so many Troops that it was impossible to remove them prevailed on him with much Difficulty to make a Retreat before the Troops were push'd into Disorder upon which the King immediately ordered the left Wing of his Army to draw off and with his usual Presence of Mind made a desperate Stand in the Rear till they were quite clear off the Field of Battle  But his Right had not such good luck for the  French  having driven them from their Posts and having form'd themselves in two Lines within the Entrenchments no sooner saw them begin their Retreat but they attack'd them with such Vigour that they put them into the utmost Confusion especially the Cavalry who coming to a little River which was in their Rear called the  Geet  and the Bridges not being able to receive them they tumbled into  it one over another that tho' there was scarce Water enough to drown them they were rather stifled in the Mud with the Weight of one another than drowned in the Water  Several whole Squadrons seeing the Consequence of attempting to pass the River chose rather to face about and charge again but there being nothing but Desperation in such an Attempt they were all cut in pieces  In short the  French  have an entire Victory they have taken Pieces of Cannon Mortars above a Hundred Colours Standards and KettleDrums with all their Carriages Ammunition and Baggage five General Officers other Officers and Soldiers and we are told that the Enemy has left Men kill'd on the Field of Battle besides the wounded which are at least as many  This Victory is so much the more glorious to  France  because the Confederates lay so much Stress upon the Goodness of the Troops and the Conduct of the King of  England  that they thought it impossible they should be beaten but that Confidence has often times been the Ruin of great Armies  It is true the Loss of Men is exceeding great in the  French  Army and especially among the Officers of whom they have lost abundance and a great many even of the King's own Blood are wounded for the terrible Conflict in the Village and the Manner in which they carried on the Attack was such that their Loss of Men must be very great  They own here the Loss of Men killed and wounded but others speak of three Times that Number  Let the Infidels fight and tear one another to Pieces that the Faithful may triumph over them but Peace be in the illustrious Port for ever  Pax optima Rerum  Quas homini novisse datum est  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER VI To the Selictar Aga or Chief SwordBearer to the Sultan  Achmet  Lord of the illustrious among Men Prince of the Kings of the three Corners of the Earth  THERE is not a more empty and insignificant Pageantry on Earth than this the  Nazarens  make such a Noise about the World with  viz  about Orders of Knighthood  Old Sultan  Saladine  the happy Leader of the victorious Mussulman exposed the  Nazaren  Knights to the last Degree of Ridicule and Laughter In the Account of his glorious Victories over the enthusiastick Crowds rather than Armies of those Fools that pretended to  fight for the Sepulchre of Jesus had several of these sort of People Prisoners in his Armies who caused them to be led about in Chains with all their Trumpery their Crosses their Caps their Mantles and Sashes and afterwards hang'd them they carried always such a ridiculous Weight of Trophies and Badges of one sort or another as render'd them more like Porters bearing a vast Burthen on their Backs than Men prepared to buckle with an Adversary  One of these a Prince by Birth and of a Sovereign Title was taken by one of the Sultan's Dwarfs and for the Honour of the pigmy Soldier  Saladine  caused him to lead his Prisoner by a Halter tied about his Neck through the  Saracen  Camp in a Word they were at last a Shame to their own People and have been with good Reason wholly extirpated except a sorry Remain of them at the Island of  Maltha  where they fled after the immortal  Solyman  the magnificent Emperor of the Mussulmans drove them from the Isle of  Rhodes  Here  viz  at  Maltha  they live by Rapin Piracy and MockPiety and carry on the Cheat of their Knighthood among those that please to be cheated but at present their Reputation is very low  But however the first Contrivers of these honorary Trifles have sunk the thing it self remains and the  Nazarens  are so fond of it that there is now scarce a Nation without what they call their Order of Knighthood the King of  Spain  and the Emperor have that of the golden Fleece the King of  England  the Garter and the King of  France  a blasphemous Order called Knights of the Holy Ghost I could say much of the Impiety of it if I were one of those  who believe the Divinity of the Holy Ghost but that is not to the Case before me  The Order of the Garter which is that of the King of  England  is a merry Institution and sounds well enough being conceived in a Frolick of one of their King's dancing with a Lady who drop'd a blue Ribband from her Leg which they call a  Garter  which the amorous King took up and wore over his Shoulder which blue Ribband is to this Day the chief Ornament of the Order this last Month it was sent as a mighty Piece of Honour to the Elector of  Saxony  who received the gawdy Trisle with wonderful Acknowledgments and all possible Ceremony wearing the blue Ribband above his Cloaths wherever he goes  The like Compliment the King of  Spain  has made to Prince  Lewis  of  Baden  of the Order of the golden Fleece and that great Warriour walks about with the Image of a dead Sheep hanging about his Neck One would think these People were mad that upon every Whimsie make the meanest Animals the Trophy of Honour to them as in their Heraldry another of their sumptuary Whimsies one carries a Goat's Head for his Device another a Bunch of Hops and an eminent Family in  England  I have heard give three Owles for their Emblem or Coat of Distinction which Bird they nevertheless esteem as the most contemptible Another great Family here shews a Crab and another yet greater a Ladder to say nothing of their Veneration to a Cross which is to them the highest of all Ensigns tho' it be nothing less or more than a Gibbet or a Wheel is  viz  an Engine of Horror and Death  But to go back to the Order of the  dead She    for so it ought to be called I shall give thee  from their Histories a Summary of its Antiquity and Institution and that in few Words and leave the ridiculous Part to thy wiser Observation  The Order of the golden Fleece was instituted at  Bruges  by  Philip the good  Duke of  Burgundy  in the Year who commanded that all who were admitted into this Order should carry in a Collar composed of Steel flint Stones and St  Andrew  's Crosses the Representation of a Sheep the  Spaniards  generally believe that this Order was instituted in Honour of the holy Virgin and St  Andrew  by Reason of an Apparition of an Angel that appeared to a certain Countryman and gave him a Fleece of Gold commanding him withal to raise Forces under that Standard and so exspel the  Moors  out of  Spain  Others believe it to have been instituted in Memory of the great Gain which the Dukes of  Burgundy  got by Wool Others in Remembrance of  Gidcon  's Fleece who with Three Hundred Men defeated the whole Army of the  Midianites  The Chymists will have it to be a chymical Mystery in Imitation of the famous golden Fleece of the Ancients which the most Refined in that Art say was no more than the Secret of their Elixir written in Parchment Others pretend that it owes the Institution of it to the fishing for Gold in some Rivers of  Spain  at which Time they used to fling a Sheep's Fleece into the Water and after it had lain a little while draw it up again and picked out the Grains of Gold that stuck to the Wool which was practis'd formerly by the Inhabitants of  Calchis  who by that Means became so rich that they drew the covetous  Argonauts  to invade them and make themselves Masters of their Wealth but they who imagine  that all these Orders owe their Originals to the Gallantries of Princes affirm that it was in Memory of a Lady's Combings whose Hair was extreamly white and with whom  Philip the good  was passionately in Love however it were it is a very ancient and honourable Order in Regard that the King of  Spain  not only wears it himself but presents it to Foreign Princes The Habit of the Order is a Coat of Cloth of Silver a Mantle of Crimson Velvet and a Hood of Violet colour'd Velvet  Happy the inspired Genius of the Faithful who despising this taffety Glory establish their Names on the Basis of Virtue and make themselves truly great by their own heroick Actions leaving the Praise of their Deeds to the Trophies and Garlands of the inlighten'd Train of Beauties in the Garden of Pleasure who despise the Ensigns of temporary Honour expecting a sublimer Fame among the Millions of Heroes whose Blood has raised the Mussulmans Empire above the Songs or the Tongues of Men and whose Merit seeming to lie in the Dust of Oblivion shall rise like a Comet resound in Glory and enlighten with its Lustre the Vallies of Beauty in the Garden of Pleasure  Paris  the th of th Moon of the Year  LETTER VII To  Mustapha Osman  a Dervice of  Adrianople  his Friend  HERE is such a Tale of  Nazaren  Superstition told here just now as thou hast not heard of I believe in many Years and as I dare affirm may challenge all the Follies of the blindest Ages of Paganism in the World to shew any thing like it  Thou art no Stranger to the Manner of the  Nazaren  's Devotion having lived among them so long at  Vienna  where they are as devout that is as superstitious as any where among the rest of their Fopperies thou knowest they make  Allazehiah  or consecrate a little Bit of Wafer or Bread which they persuade the People to believe mark I do not say they believe it themselves I say they persuade the People to believe that this Piece of Bread is turned by the Crossings and Mutterings of Words which they use over it into the Substance the very Body Bones Blood and Flesh of the Son of  Mary  who they worship and call their Saviour  In a Word I speak it with Horror they call this consecrated Wafer the real God that made them and the whole Globe of Heaven and Earth and this Trifle of their own making they adore as if Jesus the Son of  Mary  were really there Were this Jesus who they call their Prophet to come down from the Mansions of Paradise where he is surrounded  with Glory inconceivable with the four mighty Prophets that went before him and where we believe our great Prophet shines in unsufferable Light with him I say were he to descend hither and see what a paltry DemiGod they substitute in his Place and what Adoration they pay to it in his stead he would certainly scourge this Idol out of his Worship and out of the Moschs of his Worshippers as he did the PawnBrokers out of the Temple at  Jerusalem  But to return to the Biggotry of the  Nazarens  It was near a City called  Bruges  in  Flanders  where the Scene I am to represent to thee was laid A certain sacrilegious Wretch who had thou mayest be sure less Veneration for the Son of  Mary  than for the golden Pix so they call the Vessel in which these consecrated Gods are placed and left upon the Altar in their Moschs or if not so did not perhaps believe the Truth of the Priests Allegations  viz  that God was laid up in the little Gold Box upon the Altar I say this Thief having more Mind to the Gold than Veneration for the thing reposited broke into the Mosch in the Night and stole it away  The City thou mayest imagine was in a great Uproar upon the Discovery of such a dreadful Crime the Mosch or Church was interdicted for Days and shut up being esteemed unclean after a Wretch so impious had set his Foot in it The Gates of the City were immediately shut as if a Murtherer had been to be search'd for and the strict Enquiry was such that it was impossible the Criminal could escape  When he was apprehended the main thing which was enquired of was what he had  done with the Deity as they esteemed it to be which the Man not without torturing to Extremity at length confess'd he had thrown into a House of Office  This was received with the utmost Amazement and Surprize the Criminal was put to Death with most exquisite Torment being broken alive upon the Wheel after his Flesh had been first torn with burning Pinchers  But that which is behind is more strange still for no sooner was it known where the Wretch had cast the Host so they call the consecrated Wafer I have named to thee but the People flock'd Day and Night to the unclean Place to say their Prayers to the Idol swallowed up in Excrement they continued this stinking Devotion with such Zeal that the finest Ladies were not ashamed to be seen kneeling in that nasty Place and crowding one another almost to Death to get in nay if any one had fallen in for it was a deep Vault I believe they would have esteemed it meritorious of Heaven nor would they have suffered the Filth to have been wiped off of their Clothes least any Part of the holy Article should have been mingled with it  In a Word the whole City concerned themselves in the thing and to expiate the Offence which was committed within their Walls they caused the Vault full of Filth as it was to be arched over and a Chappel to be built there which is actually done and thither the biggotted Citizens go to say their Prayers Morning and Evening  Righteous  Osman  view the Enthusiasm of blinded Zeal in these Infidels with a just Abhorrence and rejoice in paying a more pure Devotion to the great One God in the Moschs  of the Faithful surely the  Nazarens  have forgotten the Institutes of their great Prophet wherein he taught them a more reasonable Service and are worshiping a worse God than ever the  Egyptians  did  But nothing is more true than that Ignorance accompanying Devotion will lead Men to do the meanest vile and loathsome things if they are but once perswaded it is meritorious as these  Nazarens  believe If ever these People are accepted by their great Prophet upon the Merit of these Devotions Jesus the Son of  Mary  must be a meaner Person than even we the Followers of  Mahomet  believ'd him to be  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER VIII To  Muley Hamet Mahomozzi  an  Egyptian  at  Medina  a Master in

glorious Empire since devolved upon the invincible Sultan our glorious Emperor upon whose Head be Ten Thousand Years of Joy in the bright Paths of Paradise  Otherwise I recommended to thy capable Genius the Study of Astronomy the Search into the Motions Magnitude Distance Revolutions and Eclypses of all the heavenly Bodies but to turn Sorcerer and Magician in thy old Age and to have all those illuminated Parts which formed thy Genius and made thee capable of mounting thy Thoughts up to Heaven I say to have these all sink down to Hell and instead of ranging through the shining Mazes of Light in the Summits of Paradise be groping continually in the Darkness of Tophet where you can have no Light but that of the infernal Pit no Oracle but that of the ArchDevil Beelzebub and in which thy highest Qualification or Acquirement must be that of bringing evil Tidings to the World this is an unaccountable Folly  But I found thee obstinate and unpersuadable so I left thee to go on till old Age and Experience should bring thee to see thy self in the wrong and that all the wonderful Pretences thou hast made to the Knowledge of hidden things amount to no more than the Tale of a roasted Horse  And now after thirty Years Study and all the Searches thou hast made into the dark Regions of Horror after all thy Acquaintance with the Inhabitants of the Air and with the World of Spirits here's a Device among the  Nazarens  that I dare say has outdone thee in all that thou hast not only arrived to thy self but in all that thou hast ever heard of that any one else arriv'd to nay I much question whether the Prince of evil Spirits himself were he permitted to assume humane Shape could act the like amazing things as this Man has done  It is a Religieuse or a Student as he calls himself of the City of  Leon  who carries about with him a shaking Rod I fancy it sometimes to be just such another as that miraculous Rod which  Moses  carried in his Hand when he stretched it out to bring Plagues and Desolation upon thy Forefathers the  Egyptians  This Priest by the Means of this Rod or Wand discovers Treason Conspiracies Murther and Robbery finds out lost Treasure forgotten Land marks secret Adulteries and in a Word detects all sorts of Fraud Lying and malicious false Accusations  It was presently said this Man dealt with the Devil and they talk'd of burning him for a Wizard or Familiar but he confounded them with asking whether it was the Devil's Business to detect Crimes or to prompt Men to Crimes to do good or to do evil intimating that his Rod was qualified to expose Wickedness discover all sorts of Villanies and bring Offenders to Justice but had no Power to prompt or encourage any thing that was evil And this saved the Man from Censure  There is no more doubt of the Truth of his Performance than there is possibility of guessing by what Means it is performed he is now in this City where he does Wonders and the World is astonish'd at him Monsieur the King's Brother hid a great Parcel of Money in his Garden and sunk a SteelBox with some Jewels in a Fountain of Water but the shaking Wand discovered both immediately The Princess of  Conde  discovered by it a Servant who had stollen several Pieces of Plate from her Toilette particularly two large Silver Candlesticks tho' the Robbery had been  committed almost three Years before It is impossible to question the Truth of the Stories they tell of this Man and his wondrous Rod unless one would doubt the whole City and believe every one you meet a Party to the Fraud  For my Part I know not what to think of this Man for as above there is no denying the Facts he performs so there is no resolving how he performs it  I know the Southsayers and Diviners of the  East  the wise Men of thy Country and the Magicians of  Persia  used a Wand in all their Performances of this Nature also we find in many ancient Writings that the  Scythians  the  Sarmatians  and the  Thracians  and many other Nations used Divinations and Sorceries by Twigs and Rods in the same or like Manner as this  Leontine  does  The  Goths  also retain'd this Custom whether they received it from the ancient  Scythians  or not I know not but I find it crept in among the  Huns  and perhaps march'd round through those desolate Parts of the World which are now call'd  Muscovy  into  Laponia  and the  North  where nothing is more certain than that they raise Storms and Calms and cause the Winds to blow this Way or that as the Mariners please or pay them and that they do it by crossing little Switches or Wands in wild and irregular Motions to those Quarters from whence they will have it blow  This Rabdomantick Art or divining by Rods I thought had been dropt out of the World but they assure me here that when  Gustavus Adolphus  King of  Sweden  made War in  Germany  the  Swedish  Soldiers would with Rods find out the Treasure which the Monks hid in  their Churches and Convents in Vaults and Places under Ground where nothing but such an Art could do it  For my Part I have so little Faith in these things that I cannot give the Credit to it that others do tho' at the same Time I must confess I cannot detect any Falacy yet in it tho' sometimes I begin to think there must be some  Legerdemain  in it which no Body could yet find out but which would in Time discover it self as such things generally do The rest I must leave to Time But I dare say thou wilt confess thou art outdone by this Man and perhaps will say it is impossible to be true but for that there is no Room for Question because there is no Argument against Demonstration  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER IX To the Kaimacham  THE good Fortune of the King of  France  is now indeed returned and tho' he did not make the Advantage of the Spring as he usually did and undertook nothing early yet the Successes which have flow'd in upon him since have abundantly made him amends In  Flanders  he has gain'd the most glorious Victory that ever he yet obtained in all his Reign of which I have given thee a full Account but as if this was not enough the Successes of his Armies have been on every Side equal to it in Proportion to the Forces engaged  While the Armies in  Flanders  were preparing for that glorious Action the Duke  de Lorge  passed the  Rhine  in  Germany  ravaged the Frontiers of the Empire with as much Fury as ever a Hoord of  Tartars  made an Inroad into  Poland  only that they did not covet so much the sweeping away of the People for they do not sell Slaves in these Countries except such as are brought from  Africk  who they call  Negroes  In this Ravage they resolved to attack the City of  Hidleberg  the Capital of one of the Electors of the  Nazaren  Empire which they did They push'd the Siege with such Fury on one Hand and the Place was so ill defended on the other that they took both the City and the Castle in a very few Days  In taking this Castle they were Masters of one of the finest Palaces in all these Parts of the World the Seat of the Elector  Palatine  the Buildings the Furniture the Paintings inimitably fine and inestimably rich all which the Mareschal  de Lorge  caused first to be plunder'd by his Soldiers and then burnt down to the Ground for which all the World blamed him and spoke of the Mareschal with great Tokens of Abhorrence  But they tell us the Mareschal had express Orders from the King his Master for what he did and the Reason they give for that is still a greater Satyr upon the King  viz  that he ordered the Castle and fine Palace at  Heidleberg  to be demolished because it was the only Palace in the World that exceeded his new House at  Versailles  If this were true I say it was a great Satyr on the Pride and Ostentation of the King of  France  On the other Hand the Baseness of the Governour  who so ill defended this City has been treated with that just Disgrace which such a Piece of vile Cowardice well deserves and of which I send thee a particular Account that thou mayest present to the Divan a Precedent commendable and very fit to be used upon such Officers as being entrusted with Places of Importance fail in their Duty or basely give up the Fortresses of the Empire of the Faithful into the Hands of the Enemy  The Governour of  Heidleberg  was the Baron  Heidesdorf  a MajorGeneral of the Emperor's Armies a  Franconian  by Birth of a good Family one of the Knights of the Teutonick Order and till now he was thought to have been a very good Officer but his Cowardice and Surprize was proved plainly on a full Hearing before a Court Martial and his Sentence was very severe for they sentenc'd him to be beheaded after being degraded of all his Honours which was done with the utmost Disgrace  The Execution was in this Form  viz  He was carried to the House of the Teutonick Order which is in  Hailbrun  where he was clad in the Robes of one of the Knights and then having both his Collar and his Cross taken from him they struck him twice upon the Face with it then the youngest Knight taking him by the Arm thrust him out of the House and gave him two Kicks at the Door that leads into the Street Nor was this all but he was carried in a Tumbrel by the common Hangman to the Prince of  Baden  's Camp and after he had been a Spectacle to all the Army drawn up in Battalia on Purpose he was lead up to a Scaffold where he was to have lost his Head as the Sentence imported but as the Executioner was preparing to do his Duty  there came a Reprieve which gave him his Life at the Intercession of the Teutonick Order but still more Disgrace for after the Hangman had girt his Sword about him he took it from him again immediately broke it in two and gave him three Slaps with the flat Side of the Blade upon his Face At the End of this ignominious Execution he was declared banish'd out of the Circles of  Suabia Franconia  the  upper Rhine  and  Austria  to which Purpose the Hangman carried him in his Tumbrel beyond the  Neckar  and there left him where as some Letters say the CountryPeople much more his Friends than they who begg'd his Life on such shameful Terms in a few Days after knock'd him on the Head some say he requested a Bo  r that is a CountryFellow to do him that Office as of Kindness that he might not live to see his Disgrace  Heroick Prince of the immortal Spahis thou art well able to judge how much more agreeable Death must be to a Man of Honour than such Usage and after all they say the Baron was a Man of as much personal Bravery as any Man and had distinguish'd himself with great Advantage upon many Occasions however being overpowered now with great Numbers and seeing no Relief at hand he unhappily misbehav'd at last  It is necessary sometimes too to let the Weight of all fall upon one Head to excuse others for after all they alledge that due Care was not taken to repair the Fortifications of the Place or to give him a Body of Men able to have made a good Defence  Happy the invincible Empire of the Mussulmans where it never was known that any Governour Aga or Bassa in the numerous  Armies of the Grand Seignior being entrusted with the Defence of any fortified Town betray'd it to the Unbelievers let the  Nazarens  testifie for us and let it be spoken openly what Characters they give here to the Honour of our Bassa's Governours of  Buda Newhausel Gran Canisia great Waradin  and  Belgrade  and to the Blood those Sieges or Blockades have cost the Unbelievers before they got them or any of them into their Hands  In this the Empire of our immortal Sultan is truly invincible  viz  that nothing falls out of the Hands of his Slaves the Leaders of his mighty Armies but with all the Resistance and Defence that Honour and an inviolable Fidelity to their Master calls for from them  I remember the glorious Defence thou madest at the first Siege of  Buda  made famous under thy Government by the Bones the  Nazarens  left in Heaps under the Walls for which inimitable Conduct thou art still honoured among thy Enemies and advanced worthily to the Favour and Cabinet of the greatest Emperor in the World  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER X To the Captain Bassa  IN my last to thee I gave an Account of a terrible Blow given to the  French  Naval Power by the  British  and  Dutch  in the great Battle at Sea and the burning their Ships afterwards  in their own Harbour thou mayest now see the Reverse  Certainly what the  French  want in Force they make up in Policy and in Vigilance it was true that the  French  though their Diligence in repairing their Navy was beyond all that the World thought possible were not able to fight the  English  and  Dutch  Fleet joined together who were no less than Men of War of the Line yet by their Vigilance and Dexterity in taking hold of the Advantage offer'd them they have given the Confederates a terrible Blow at Sea and had not the Confederates been very fortunate even in this Disaster the Blow had been much greater  The  English  and  Dutch  whose Trade is their Wealth and the Fountain of their Strength especially at Sea had prepared a mighty Fleet of MerchantShips bound to  Portugal Spain  and the  Levant  and to the august Port also the Receptacle of Nations richly freighted with all sorts of Wealth and rich Commodities proper for those Parts  This great Fleet contained above Sail and the grand Navy being ready to sail it was thought convenient to take the Advantage of their Convoy as far as they could be had which was to the Mouth of the Bay of  Biscay  Here the said united grand Navy left the Merchants to proceed on their several Voyages and left them about thirty Men of War to be their Convoy  It was in an ill Hour the grand Fleet left them the  th  of  June  for the vigilant  French  who watch'd for such a desirable Booty and well knew where they would part sailed about Days before them from the Coast of  France  with Men of War and waited for them in  Legos  Bay and on the Coast of  Portugal  and  Spain  about Cape St  Vincent  which they call here the Southward Cape  About the  d  they took a small  French  Bark who told them there was  French  Men of War in  Legos  Bay but the  English  having Men of War thought of a Booty rather than a Battle on that Account On the  th  they began to discover some  French  Ships of War being at that Time about Cape St  Vincent  and the next Day in the Morning they plainly perceived the whole  French  Fleet to their great Surprize and even Amazement The  English  Admiral with Men of War discovering plainly the superior Strength of the  French  shifted his Course westward and having some Advantage of the Wind made all the Sail they could giving a Signal to the MerchantShips and to the  Dutch  Men of War to follow Among the MerchantShips there was the greatest Consternation imaginable every one cried out to his Fellow we are all undone  The  French  not regarding so much the Men of War fell in among the MerchantMen who every one endeavour'd to shift for themselves the best they could and the Fleet being so very great many got away however above Threescore and Six Sail were taken or burnt most of them richly laden two  Dutch  Men of War after an obstinare Fight were taken four  English  MerchantShips immensly rich bound to the happy Port were sunk by the  French  after they were entered the Harbour of  Gibraltar  and a  Dutch  Ship burnt  In a Word tho' it was next to miraculous that the  French  got no more Booty yet the Loss to the  English  and  Dutch  amounts to many  Millions of Livres and the Consternation throughout those trading Nations is inexpressible  The  Dutch  lost three Sultanas taken and two burnt the  English  two and a Store Ship besides the MerchantShips  This Action has reviv'd the Courage and restor'd the Credit of the  French  Seamen who it was said were very much dispirited at the last Year's Misfortune and at the manifest Superiority of the Confederate Fleets The Loss of the Confederates in Ships and in Goods is esteemed at Millions of Livres and the  French  say that now they are even with the  English  for the burning their Men of War at  LaHogue  The very same Hour almost that this News makes glad the People of  France  they are rejoycing also on the Accounts of accumulated Victories over their Enemies on all Sides on the  Rhine  they have push'd the  Germans  far into the Empire defeated several of their Bodies raised infinite Contributions upon the Circles dismantled their Towns and ravaged the Country  In  Catalonia  the  French  Army and Navy has carried  Roses  by a short Siege of eight Days by Sea and Land and has ravaged the Country far and wide even to the Gates of  Barcelona  which it is said they will also besiege  Invincible Captain of a Thousand Sultanas chief Admiral of the Armadas of the Faithful thou knowest what it is to gain Victories as well as to rejoice in them the Triumphs of the  French  Nation are faint Emblems of the glorious Conquests of our invincible Emperor in the Days when the Kingdoms of the World fell faster into their Hands than Towns do here into the Hands of  France  May Victories continue still to crown the Head of thy immortal Master till surrounded with inimitable Glory he ascends to Paradise in the Arms of our great Prophet  Mahomet  there to enjoy the Treasures of Peace in the Company of  Omar Ekir  and  Alibeker  the blessed and shine like the Sun in the Strength of inexpressible Glory  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year  LETTER XI To the Grand Vizier  I Am destin'd to write of nothing but Victories for this whole Year if  France  goes on thus a little longer  Lewis  XIV and the bright Scepter of the invincible Race of  Ottoman  the glorious whose Days be many and his People prosperous will meet on the Banks of  Danubius  and share the Empire of the World between them  I have thrice already written of the Victories of the  French  by Land and Sea The taking of Cities and Towns and a vast Extent of Dominions depending on them are things too mean to engage a Pen which has the Wonders of this Reign to describe  France  has crown'd the Campaign with another compleat Victory and that over the Enemy of all the rest which most moved his Choler  It had been a Mortification almost insupportable to the  French  Court to find the little D of  Savoy  a Prince who the King could at another  Time have crush'd with one of his Fingers insult him while his Hands were as it were tied by the Struggles he had with more significant Enemies The Mareschal  Catinat  complained in his Letters to the King that while the Mareschal  de Luxemburgh  had still Men in  Flanders  even after the Confederates were defeated at  Landen  the Duke  de Lorge  Men on the  Rhine  and no Enemy to fight with and the Duke  de Noailles  in  Catalonia  while the  Spaniards  durst not look him in the Face he only  Catinat  should be left with a handful of Men as if condemn'd to the Misery of seeing his Majesty affronted by the  Savoyard  without Power to resist and concludes his Letter with earnest Entreaties for Succours or that the King would give him leave with Horse that were with him and that were made desperate with seeing the Ruine of their Country to break into the Enemy's Armies and die as became them with their Swords in their Hands  At length the King gave Ear to the Mareschal's Importunities and ordered the Duke  de Lorge  to make a Detachment of Men from  Alsace  to march to  Italy  among which were the  Gens d' Arms  and other Troops of the Household and at the same Time the Campaign being over in  Catalonia  the Duke  de Noailles  was ordered to detach Foot and Horse from that Side and tho' the March was long yet both those Detachments together with Men from  Provence  joined Monsieur  Catinat  almost together and came in so good time that he had an Opportunity to enter  Piedmont  just as the Duke of  Savoy  grown haughty by his Success pretended to bombard  Pignerol  The Duke hearing of the March of the  French  drew off and retreated to cover  Turin  which  the Mareschal  Catinat  made him believe he would attack and the two Armies met in the great Plain of  Marsaglia  about five Leagues from  Turin  The Mareschal an old Soldier who knew his Army was now equal at least in Number and superior in Cavalry to the  Savoyard  and whose Troops were sufficiently provoked by the Ravages which the  Germans  and  Spanish  Troops in particular had made the Year before in  France  for which they waited an Occasion to pay them home I say the Mareschal and his whole Army breathing nothing but Revenge made no Stop but as soon as they came up with their Enemies let them see they must fight for it and acrordingly lying but one Night in Reach of the Duke's Army the next Morning he marched in full Battalia directly to their Camp and fell upon them with such Fury that nothing could withstand them  It was observ'd that the Cavalry in the  French  left Wing and the Infantry in the main Battle charg'd their Enemy Sword in Hand without firing a Gun the Foot with their Handjars screw'd on the Muzzles of their Pieces a Method never practised before coming up to the Teeth of the  Milanese  Troops overturn'd all that stood in their Way so that receiving their first Fire and not firing at all themselves the Enemies were cut in pieces before they had time to charge their Muskets a second time  In short this daring Courage of the King of  France  's Troops dispiritted the Duke of  Savoy  's Troops to that Degree that they could no where stand their Ground before the  French  their Army is quite broken above kill'd on the Spot taken Prisoners Pieces of Cannon all their Baggage and Colours and Standards taken by the  French  Invincible Prince of Generals the Particulars of this Battle will assure thee how easily the  German  Cavalry are to be conquered Not the Curiassers themselves of whom such terrible things have been said tho' arm'd and barb'd Man and Horse were able to resist the  French Gens d' Arms  and Light Horse who despising Armour and neglecting their Carabines charg'd naked into the Line of the  German  Horse and by the dextrous Management of their Horses and an invincible daring Courage broke them in an instant and cut them in pieces with their Swords only  Glory attend the Armies of the illustrious resplendent Emperor of the World led by thy experienc'd and victorious Hand These Victories of the  French  will make way for thy Conquests and the  Nazaren  Emperor shall no more be able to stand before thee being obliged to call off his Armies to defend his imperial Palace from the conquering  French  who if no sudden and unexpected Accident intervene will soon make the Walls of  Vienna  tremble  While I am writing this to thee News is come from the Duke of  Luxemburgh  that he has convinc'd the World that the Victory he obtained at  Landen  was compleat by his besieging  Charleroy  in the Face of the King of  England  's Army who pretended to be recruited again but did not think fit to try their Hands in another Battle The Town held out but Days after the Trenches were open'd and is surrender'd which makes the Victories of the  French  this Year be no less than in Number  Paris  th of the th Moon of the Year
