 AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND BEING THE PROTEST OF A PRIVATE PERSON Against every SUSPENSION OF LAW that is liable to injure or endanger PERSONAL SECURITY  WHEREIN IS SHEWN That the Claim of  personal Protection and Relief from unjust Imprisonment  BY DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW  and that "WITHOUT DELAY" is a "COMMON RIGHT" so indispensably due to all  innocent Persons  that it cannot be set aside or with∣drawn from any  that are so  who demand it without  fundamentally subverting the political Constitution  or  legal Establishment of these Kingdoms  and thereby rendering the Advisers and Promoters of such a Measure  guilty of  HIGHTREASON  "It is the Duty of every Individual whatsoever to aid  PEACE  and  PUBLIC JUSTICE  " agreeable to a MAXIM of the Law"UNUSQUISQUE PACI ET JUSTITIAE PUBLICAE TENETUR SUCCURRERE"  "Those Men who set aside"  or suspend  "the Law of the Land do thereby incur a perpetual Stain of Infamy"For it is a funda∣mental MAXIM of the Constitution "  LEGEM TERRAE  amit∣tentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt"  LONDON PRINTED IN THE YEAR MDCCLXXVIII  TO THE PEOPLE OF ENGLAND  COMMON CHARITY will induce us to believe that the advocates for an occasional  suspension  of the  Habeas Corpus  laws are not really aware of the dangerous tendency of such a measure and therefore when the author of this Protest in the following pages charges the advisers and promoters of the sus∣pension with  hightreason against the king and state  he professes to aim the severity of his censure chiefly against  the measure itself  in order to express the  real danger  and  malignity  of its ef∣fect rather than against the  persons  of those men who inadvertently or through inattention to the  fundamental  or  indis∣pensable principles of law  have promoted  it and therefore to  those  persons joint∣ly with all the other People of England as being equally interested with the rest in the effects of such a measure the au∣thor of this Protest now addresses himself not to promote a spirit of vengeance and personal resentment but merely for the purposes of warning and instruction to  all parties  that they may cordially unite in restoring the  due limitations  of govern∣ment on which depends the common safety both of king and people  The Advocates for an occasional  sus∣pension of the law  perhaps will alledge that the new  temporary  powers whate∣ver they may happen to be which would thereby be thrown into the hands of the persons intrusted with the administra∣tion of government are by no means intended to take effect against  the People of England  that are resient  in  this island but only against such persons as  have  been guilty of treason in foreign parts  in  America  let us suppose for instance or  on the high seas or for piracy  and therefore they conceive that the free inhabitants of this island could not be injured by so limited a  suspension  of the laws especially if they should admit in their bill an additional clause of limita∣tion proposed even by an opposite par∣ty by way of security which we will suppose to be couched in the following terms  viz  That nothing herein is intended or shall be construed to extend to the case of any other prisoner or pri∣soners than such as shall have  BEEN OUT OF THE REALM AT THE TIME OR TIMES OF THE OFFENCE OR OFFENCES  wherewith he or they shall be charged or of which they shall be suspected  Such a clause as this seems on a slight examination to se∣cure the inhabitants of this island from the danger of an  unlimited  power against  which all true Englishmen ought to be ever upon their guard but alas so dan∣gerous is it to stop the ordinary course of  justice  and  common right  or to alter the  "due process of the law"  in any ca∣ses whatsoever wherein  personal liberty  the highest and most valuable  temporal  object of Englishmen is concerned that if we should  suppose  the case of such a  suspension of the laws  as courtiers in general would endeavour to obtain were they to be intrusted with  the com∣piling of a bill  for that purpose and then carefully compare the said  supposed bill  with the abovementioned  clause of limitation  we should soon have reason to be convinced that the security of the latter is only  imaginary  and that mul∣titudes of his majesty's  innocent  and  peaceable  subjects would be still liable to be oppressed and be denied the benefits of  public justice  and  common right  by such a  suspension of law  if they should happen  to incur the displeasure of persons in power or be misrepresented to them by any secret enemy  The proposed clause leaves unpro∣tected all the nobility gentry and other persons whatsoever that have made any excursions into  France Italy Germany Flanders c  or even to  Ireland  ever since the commencement of the troubles whatever they might be which occa∣sioned an  imaginary necessity  or plea for SUSPENDING THE LAWS And this perhaps might be extended three or four years back and might thereby exclude from the protection of the limiting clause a great multitude of the most re∣spectable people of the kingdom who might happen to have travelled abroad during such a period Neither does the clause protect the merchants traders and other persons that have arrived from the WestIndies Ireland or any other  country within such a supposed period And they are surely too numerous and respectable a body to be thus  outlawed  Add to this that all  seafaring Persons without exception  though they are the most valuable subjects of this maritime state would be left unprotected by such a clause and of course would be rendered subject to the  unlimited  WILL  of man  ARBITRIUM  hominis  which is the true definition of ARBITRARY POWER  in∣stead  of LAW And lastly all other persons whatsoever are liable to suffer the same inconveniences if they have not kept a diary or have not memory or memo∣randums to enable them to produce suf∣ficient evidence of their being actually WITHIN THIS REALM at any period of time that might be fixed upon within the last three or four years so that not only persons  seized and taken  OUT OF THE REALM  would be made liable to  the effects of such a  suspending act  but all the other persons abovementioned though they are actually RESIENT WITHIN THE REALM  In order to state the case for my argu∣ment as clearly as I am able I have here supposed the adoption of such a  suspend∣ing bill  as we might naturally conceive to be proposed by any set of men in power who are warmed by the sunshine of courtfavour till they forget that their own real interest is inseparably connected with that of the public and that the increase of power which they promote may possibly fall into some other hands than their own But the hands of govern∣ment must be strengthened they would probably say and for this purpose they would be very apt to insert in their bill some discretionary powers to enable the king and his ministers to imprison not on∣ly persons  seized and taken out of the  realm  but also persons  who shall be committed in any part of his majesty's do∣minions for the said crimes  I mean any crimes which I have before sup∣posed in stating this case  viz  Hightreason in any of his majesty's colonies or plantations in America or  ON THE HIGH SEAS  which will include our own coasts any where beyond lowwater mark  or the crime of piracy  without any description or limitation of place whatsoever So that if any inno∣cent man who happens not to be able to prove an  alibi  for every day and even every hour since these troubles began should be maliciously  "charged with"  the crime of  treason  or  piracy  committed within half a mile of the British coasts he may be seized and imprisoned  without bail or mainprize  at the  will and plea∣sure  of the king and council for  many months  and at the expiration of the  limited  time without any farther exa∣mination  or opportunity of being heard at all by his country his term of con∣finement is prolonged by another  such act  and perhaps another after that as  evil  examples beget others till the time of his relief by  due process of the law  becomes totally  uncertain  and  in∣definite  A deplorable condition this which in our common law is deemed  "wretched slavery"  for  Misera est servitus  says the maxim  ubi  JUS  est vagum aut incertum    Prin∣cipia leg Aeq p    But the condition of the  deluded  sub∣jects will be rendered still more com∣pletely  uncertain  and  wretched  if the compilers of the supposed suspending act should endeavour to avail themselves of  vague  terms and expressions for in∣stance in the body of the bill  "Such crimes"  referring to the crimes particularly named in the former part  instead of  "the said crimes"  for as  "Nullum simile est idem"    LIKE  is not  THE SAME  the expression  "such crimes"  signifies only  similar crimes  and not  the same crimes  before expressed whereby the power of the act would be liable to an arbitrary exten∣sion at the  will  of the magistrate  Whenever persons in power cease to be  duly limited  by a free parliament they will pay but very little regard to the grossness of the propositions which they tender to that  once  august assembly and therefore if such an  illegal  power should ever be usurped by any set of men we may then expect to find many more  vague  expressions in our public acts We may in that case without improbability suppose the penning of a  suspending act  to be not only  for such crimes  OR ANY  of them  but also  for  SUSPICION  of  SUCH  CRIMES  or any of them by any ma∣gistrate  c viz  any trading ma∣gistrate pensioned Middlesex justice or other wretched timeserver that may happen to be entrusted with a power of committing to prison And in such times it will afford a sufficient handle against any person whatsoever if they are but  "charged with"  such crimes whether they be guilty of them or not or even if they be but  CHARGED WITH  the  SUSPICION  of  SUCH  crimes or any of them by  ANY  ma∣gistrate  c  Nothing more  arbitrary  or  capricious  can easily be de∣scribed and yet alas my  supposed bill  by no means exceeds the bounds of probability for when the baneful practice of  bribery  becomes triumphant and the very foundations of government are thoroughly  corrupted  we may ex∣pect that  probability  will still go farther and that the above  supposed  extraordinary  powers will be farther augmented by a  "non obstante"  to trample down at once not only the  Habeas Corpus Act  but all the other fences of British  liber∣ty  national  justice  and  common right  on which the safety of Englishmen de∣pends  viz  any law statute or u∣sage to the contrary in any wise not∣withstanding  The clause is indeed a common one for the repeal of useless or indifferent matters but when the effect extends to annul all the laws of  personal protec∣tion  and the  common right  of English∣men to  "the due process of the law"  which is to be tried  without delay  by their country  per legem terrae  and  if innocent  to be restored to freedom such a  suspension  I say of  common justice  and  common right  is so fun∣damentally subversive of the British constitution of state that no authority  of parliament can make it  legal  because it it is  hightreason  against the king and people and all the abettors and promo∣ters of such an act would thereby render themselves  "eternally infamous"  in the eye of the law which is declared by a constitutional maxim  LEGEM TERRAE  amittentes  PERPETUAM IN∣FAMIAE NOTAM  inde merito incur∣runt  inst p  Those men who set aside  THE LAW OF THE LAND  which is certainly the case of those who vote for  suspending  it  do thereby incur a  PERPETUAL STAIN  of  INFAMY  If ever such an act therefore should subsist and the promoters of it remain in power British subjects may amuse themselves with the  name of freedom  if they please but they will have no more  real  and  just  right to boast of their  liber∣ty  than the subjects of France or Prussia  For they would then be involved exactly in the same  uncertain  and  precarious  con∣dition And though they might not perhaps for some considerable time af∣terwards begin to feel the pernicious effects of a government  unlimited by law  yet that would not render their condi∣tion less  base  or  slavish  for our common law has already stated the condition of such as an  outlawed  people  Res est misera ubi  JUS  est vagum  Grounds and Rudiments of Law and Equity p    WRETCHED  is the state of affairs wherever  COMMON RIGHT  is vague  and uncertain  Nay it is downright  slavery  as declared by another maxim already cited in p  The learned Sir Robert Atkins for∣merly one of the judges of the Common Pleas has remarked concerning  the pope's exercise of his power of dispen∣sing  or rather of  suspending laws  by virtue of such a  "non obstante"  that  it was used with some moderation  AT FIRST in cases that seemed to be  of  GREAT NECESSITY only but at last by degrees it grew to be  in∣tolerable and unlimited  See his parliamentary and political Tracts p And surely we ought to be e∣qually jealous of every claim or preten∣sion to  omnipotence  or  unlimited power  whenever and by whomsoever it is made though we do not immediately feel the baneful effects of itThere are but too many advocates for the imaginary  omni∣potence  or  unlimited power  of parlia∣ment  True it is that the same persons who are entrusted with authority to  make laws  are entrusted likewise with autho∣rity to  suspend  or  repeal  them but in this without the least detriment to their  just  liberty  and  free  privileges they are not without  limitation  Even  liberty  it∣self is  limited  and submits to the same sort of definition for  liberty  says an old and eminent lawwriter  is not a power to act  quidquid libet what we list  for this may be  licentious  and a lust or passion may enslave a man  or men  as much as any chain or fetter but  quod licet  what is  just  and  ratio∣nal  Rights of the Kingdom  p    And in the preceding page speaking expressly of the house of com∣mons or parliaments he says  When they are  FREEST  they have  LI∣MITS  for they be  NOT INFINITE  Nay when they are  MOST FREE  they are  MOST BOUND  to  GOOD ORDERS  and  TO RIGHT REASON  The truth of this doctrine is unquestionable for if a  parliament  or  legislative power  of any kind regal or popular presume to enact ordinances which oppose or in  any respect set aside  natural justice  or  the common right of innocent persons  and shall claim an  authority  or  privilege  to do so which is ignorantly and vainly cal∣led  omnipotence of parliament  the said  power  ceases to be a  legal power  because it casts off the restraint and government of God's indispensable laws and thereby becomes excommunicated from God  Shall the throne of  INIQUITY  have fellowship with thee which  FRAMETH MISCHIEF BY A LAW  Psalm xciv  A due consideration of this ought to restrain the modern rage of actmaking for it is laid down in that ancient and re∣spectable lawbook called FLETA that  the power of  RIGHT    or  justice is of God alone but the power of  WRONG or injury  is of the  DEVIL  and the works of whichsoever of these two  viz  of God or of the devil    he shall  do    speaking of the agency of a  king  and the same may surely be said also of a  parliament  of him he is the servant  Potestas enim  JURIS  solius est  DEI INJURIAE  ve∣ro  DIABOLI  et cujus  OPERA  fecerit ejus et minister erit  Fleta c xvii p  And to this doctrine as an unquestionable truth that illustrious lawyer  Henry de Bracton  who was a judge in this realm above years ago has made the following addition  Therefore    says he still speaking of a  king  while he  DOES JUSTICE  he is the vicar of the  ETERNAL KING  but he is the  SERVANT OF THE DEVIL  while he declines to  INJUSTICE  or  WRONG  Quia illa potestas  potestas JURIS  solius  DEI  est potestas autem injuriae  DIABOLI  et non  DEI  et cujus horum opera fecerit rex ejus mi∣nister erit cujus opera fecerit  And then follows the addition quoted above  Igitur dum  FACIT JUSTITIAM  vicarius est  REGIS AETERNI  minister autem  DIABOLI  dum declinet ad injuriam  Bract lib iii c p  And in like manner a parliament or  the persons entrusted with the power of legislation are to be esteemed as  the ser∣vants of the devil  and as enemies to  God  while they promote or establish any no∣torious  injustice  for  Know ye not that to whom ye yield yourselves ser∣vants to obey his servants ye are to whom ye obey whether of sin unto death or of obedience unto righteous∣ness  Rom vi  Many laws there are which belong to  God  as well as  man  and which are there∣fore to be esteemed as parts of the E∣TERNAL LAW  ie the  WILL  of  GOD  that all things be moved and directed to a good and proper end a perpetual and constant  WILL  to give to every one his  RIGHT  LEX AETERNA  nihil aliud est quam ipsa summa ra∣tio gubernationis rerum in  DEO  sive illa summa ratio  DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE  qua vult  DEUS  omnia a se con∣dita moveri et dirigi ad bonum et debitum fi∣nem  c And again  LEX AETERNA  sub alia descriptione dicitur  PERPETUA et CONSTANS VOLUNTAS JUS SUUM  unicuique tribuens  c Doct et Stud c i p  and  no  right  can be more sacred than the  right  of an  innocent man to obtain  FREE∣DOM by  "due process of the law"  from duress and unjust imprisonment for  LIBERTY  is inestimable    libertas est res inestimabilis  Jenk cent  and  is planted  BY GOD  in the very na∣ture of man    Libertas a Deo ho∣minis est indita naturae  Fortescu de laud Leg Ang  So that  hu∣man nature intreats  or implores  fa∣vour in the  CAUSE OF LIBERTY  more than in any other cause    Humana natura in libertatis causa favorem semper MAGIS QUAM IN ALIIS CAUSIS deprece∣tur  c Ib c xlvii p  and conse∣quently the man who  does not favour the cause of  LIBERTY  is already con∣demned in our common law as  im∣pious  and cruel  Impius et crudelis judicandus est qui libertati non favet  Co Lit  And in like man∣ner every act of parliament or statute which is  unfavourable  thereto by redu∣cing  freedom  and augmenting  slavery  must necessarily be esteemed equally ob∣noxious and inimical to GOD and MAN for  CRUDELIS  etiam  NECESSARIO  judicabitur  LEX  quae servitutem aug∣mentat et minuit libertatem  Fortescu c And as this  "will of God"  respecting the  right of men  is in the a∣bove quotation declared to be  perpe∣tual and constant  it necessarily fol∣lows that  no human authority  upon  earth  can  suspend  or  annul  any part of the  eter∣nal law  without grievous sin for our first allegiance is made in baptism to  God and his laws  and the latter consist not merely in the  written  injunctions of di∣vine revelation which we call the  scrip∣tures  but also in  reason  and  natural jus∣tice  the knowledge of which though it is a divine attribute is inherited by mankind in general  and written in their hearts  Scribiturque haec lex  lex rationis  in corde cujus∣libet hominis  docens eum quid agendum et quid fugiendum unde dicit apostolus ad Romanos secundo  Omnes gentes qui legem S scriptam non habent  NATU∣RALITER  ea quae legis suni faciunt hujusmodi legem non habentes ipsi sibi sunt lex qui ostendunt opus legis  SCRIPTUM IN CORDIBUS SUIS  testimonium reddente illis  CONSCIENTIA IPSORUM  Et quod lex ra∣tionis in corde scribitur ideo deleri non potest nec etiam recepit mutationem ex loco nec tempore sed  ubique et inter omnes homines servari debet  NAM JURA NATURALIA IMMUTABILIA SUNT  c Doct et Stud c ii p  or else there could be no such thing as the imputation of sin THE LAW OF REASON is therefore justly e∣steemed the  first foundation  of the  laws  of England  Primum fundamentum legis Angliae est lex rationis  Doct et Stud c v p And  the law of reason  includes  the laws of nature  which cannot lawfully be  suspended  or  changed  by parliament for our common law declares that they are immutable  "Jura naturae sunt IMMUTABILIA" Prin Leg et Aequit p  The laws of nature are unchangeable  they cannot therefore be  lawfully  sus∣pended or  changed  by parliament nei∣ther can any manifest  injustice  be made  lawful  for by the same authority we know that  LEX INJUSTA non est LEX  "An unjust ordinance" or act of parliament "is not law" No plea  of necessity  could render such a parliamentary exertion even excusea∣ble for though there are many max∣ims on this head as  Necessitas non habet legem  and  Salus populi  which even bad legislators will pretend to regard  suprema est lex    Ne∣cessitas facit licitum quod aliàs non est licitum    Necessitas vincet legem  Yet these can relate only to such laws as are made to remedy inconveniences  not in themselves evil  mere  mala prohibi∣ta  but cannot authorize any thing that  is  malum in se  for that would be RE∣BELLION AGAINST GOD which no case can justify For of those who say  Let us do evil that good may come  the Scrip∣ture has added  Whose damnation is just  Rom iii  Fiat justitia ruat coelum  is therefore a sound maxim both of law and politics so that no  ne∣cessity  whatever can justify the establish∣ment of any  injustice  without a reme∣dy and no  injustice evil tort wrong  or  iniquity  can be more flagrant or more dangerous to the state than an un∣necessary  delay  of  common right  and  jus∣tice  to an innocent man whose  per∣sonal liberty  is unjustly invaded for if  "personal liberty"  is not secured and protected BY EQUAL LAW no proper∣ty or other rights whatsoever can have any real value and from thence it arises that the  common right  of every inno∣cent person  to the laws  of protection is es∣teemed our highest and most valuable  inheritance for  Major haereditas venit unicuique nostrum a  JURE  et  LE∣GIBUS  quam a parentibus  A greater inheritance descends to every one of us from  the constitutional establishment of  right  It is called  RIGHT" says the lord Coke nd inst p  "because it is  THE BEST BIRTHRIGHT  the subject hath for thereby his goods lands wife children  HIS BODY" for it is the  birthright  and  best  PROTECTION of every honest SEAMAN as well as of all other men  "life honour and estimation are  PRO∣TECTED  from injury and wrong"  and then he cites THE MAXIM  "Major haereditas  c  and the laws than from our pa∣rents  A  "non obstante"  therefore which boldly suspends at once all the  an∣cient constitutional  laws of personal protec∣tion and leaves an innocent man without  a remedy  cannot be LAW being contrary to all that ought to be esteemed law for  Lex nemini operatur iniquum nemini  fa∣cit  injuriam  Law works no iniquity to any man does  INJURY  to no man  and  Quicquid est contra norman  RECTI  est  injuria  whatever is contrary to the rule of  RIGHT  is  INJURY  and  Tort à la ley est CONTRARY  Co Lit  Wrong is CONTRARY to  law  and therefore  whatever is done  CON∣TRARY TO LAW  or  makes against law    ought to be esteemed as UNDONE    Pro infecto habetur  says the maxim  Quod contra legem fit pro infecto habetur  so that the ex∣amples that have been cited as prece∣dents for  suspending  the  laws  of  liberty  and  protection  are no precedents of  justi∣fication  for the legislative power of  dis∣pensing  with  laws  extends only to those laws which relate to  mala prohibita  as I have before remarked  Dispensatio est  MALI PROHIBITI  provida relaxatio utilitate communi pensata  and can∣not effect the laws of  natural justice  and common constitutional  right  because an act of parliament for any such pur∣pose  must be a  malum in se  and conse∣quently is  null  and  void  in itself  The king has no power nor can be allowed any power to  defer postpone  or  suspend  that  equal and right justice  which is due  by inheritance  to all Bri∣tish subjects to common sailors as well as others without respect of persons because the king subscribed  Magna Char∣ta  when he received the Holy Sacrament at his coronation of which the author of this protest is an eyewitness being very near the king's person at that time where∣by he has promised before God and the people that he  will delay  or  deny  to  none right  or  justice    Nulli negabimus aut differemus justitiam vel rectum  cap xxix so that this excludes all power of  suspending  any of the laws on which  justice  or  right  depend The king therefore must neither  delay  justice him∣self nor be in any way instrumental in  preventing his  judges  from proceeding to do  justice  according to Magna Charta and the other ancient and fundamental laws of the land for the judges are also sworn to  deny to no man common right by the king's letters nor none other man's nor for none other cause  See the oath made Edward III Keble's Statutes p This wary expression in the oath viz  for none other cause  ex∣cludes all possibility of admitting any  ex∣ception  whatsoever so that the sworn judges are so bound to GOD  the king and the people  for they are sworn to  "serve the people"  Ye shall swear and well and lawfully ye shall SERVE  our lord the king  AND HIS PEOPLE  in the office of justice  c  as well as the king that they must not obey even an act of parliament which sets aside this matter of  "common right"  I mean the  common right of  PERSONAL LIBERTY  to all ranks of men  that are innocent from crimes and free from debt  Some worthy men zealous for the  privileges of parliament  are indeed un∣willing to admit this  seeming independence  of the judges in the administration of  justice  or  common right  which by their oaths they are to  "deny to no man"  but the  just  privileges of parliament never can be injured by the independence of the judges  in this single point  because if a judge is so scrupulous or conscientious that he refuses to enforce or obey an  un∣just  statute it is still in the power of par∣liament to impeach or discharge him from his office for disobedience so that the  loss  would fall only upon the honest and worthy judge though the  dishonour  of the  injustice  would rest where it began Nevertheless while JUDGES remain in office they must not acknowledge any obligation  superior  to that which they owe to  natural justice  and  the laws of God  for they are  bound to  GOD as I  have already remarked by the nature of their office as well as to the  king  and the  people  though this  first  and  most binding  obligation is not expressed in their oath yet the Scripture says  The judgement is God's  Deut i and again  Ye judge not for man but for  THE LORD  who is with you in the JUDGEMENT  Chron ix and therefore neither the  judges  nor the  king  himself are to be accounted  laymen  but  "ministers of God"  for  righteousness justice  and  judgement  By the two lat∣ter in the present case I do not mean  penal  justice or judgement but the duties of maintaining the  "common right"  of  inno∣cent  persons and of relieving the op∣pressed These are in a peculiar man∣ner  sacred to God  and therefore  una∣lienable  from the people and not to be  sus∣pended  by the authority of parliament because the commands of  God  in these matters are peremptory and can admit  of no exceptions  Thus saith the Lord  Jehovah  KEEP YE  judge∣ment and do justice  Isaiah lvi which is diametrically opposite to the measure of  suspending  or  postponing  them And again  KEEP  mercy and  JUDGE∣MENT  and wait on thy God  CONTINU∣ALLY  or  ALWAYS  Hos xii so that there never can be any time of danger or difficulty so pres∣sing and urgent as to justify the plea of a NECESSITY for the  suspension  of  justice  and  judgement  when demanded by  in∣nocent  persons under illegal restraint or  duress  For prisoners that are  really guilty  will not demand  judgement  by writs of  Habeas Corpus  for fear of the  penal  statutes and even if such prisoners trusting at any time to the want of sufficient evidence against them should demand  judgement  and thereby escape yet it is better that TEN offenders should escape  penal  justice than that ONE  innocent man  should suffer by the  denial  or  suspension  of "COMMON RIGHT"  Melius est ut  DECEM NOXII  evadant quam ut  UNUS INNOCENS  pereat  For herein the difference between the sort of  justice  and  judgement  for which I contend and  penal justice  which may be  suspended  by competent authority is manifested viz that THE RIGHTEOUS "JUDGE OF ALL THE WORLD" decla∣red himself willing to  suspend  his  penal  judgement against A WHOLE NATION of notorious convicted offenders rather than he would involve TEN  innocent  persons in their destruction if so many could have been found among them This senti∣ment of  divine justice  was revealed for our instruction to a man who was honoured with the testimony of being inclined to  KEEP  the way of the Lord  and  the way of the Lord  as the following words declare is    to  DO  justice and judgement  Gen xviii  The  suspension  therefore of  justice  and  judgement  from  innocent  persons is plainly the reverse of  KEEPING  the way of the Lord  Wherefore  Let it suffice you O princes of Israel remove violence and spoil and  EXECUTE JUDGEMENT AND JUSTICE  which is the very reverse of  suspending  them    take away your exactions from my people saith the Lord  Ezek xlv  Cease to do evil learn to do well seek judgement  RIGHTEN  the  OPPRESSED  for this is plainly the kind of  judgement  which in the former texts God has com∣manded men to KEEP and which there∣fore ought never to be SUSPENDED  judge the fatherless plead for the wi∣dow  Isaiah i  It is also necessary to remark the divine testimony against those who  suspended  or did not "KEEP  justice  and  judgement  " but on the contrary devised wicked ordinan∣ces    They conceive mischief and bring forth iniquity They hatch cockatrice eggs and weave the spider's web  c All which may well be said of those who enact wicked statutes to ensnare and op∣press the people And again  The act of violence is in their hands Their feet run to evil and they make haste to  SHED INNOCENT BLOOD  their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity  WAST∣ING AND DESTRUCTION  are in their paths  THE WAY OF PEACE THEY KNOW NOT  and  there is  NO JUDGEMENT  in their goings  mean∣ing no  legal  judgement or  due process of the law  for the Hebrew word is  properly signifying a  legal  deci∣sion as  also signifies a JUDGE  they have made them crooked paths  which may surely be said of wicked or unjust  laws  but more especially of any  law  to  suspend  or annul the  law  itself  whosoever goeth therein shall not know  PEACE  Therefore is  JUDGEMENT  far from us    meaning that  the due pro∣cess of the law  or  proper  LEGAL  deci∣sion is far from us  for it is the same Hebrew word as before  neither doth  RIGHTEOUSNESS  In the common version it is rendered  neither doth  JUSTICE  overtake us  which is liable to be understood in a contrary sense from the original as if it referred to  penal  justice whereas the Hebrew word is  properly  righteousness  which as it is due to all men may justly be understood to signify that which in our English law is called  "common right"    or  "common right"  reach us  c Isaiah lix And again the th and th verses of the same chapter demonstrate that what I have already cited from it relates to the failure of  justice  and  judgement  or the  suspension  of  due legal process  And judgement  said the prophet  is turned away backward and justice  or rather COMMON RIGHT  as I have before remarked for the Hebrew word is  "RIGHTEOUSNESS"  STANDETH A∣FAR OFF  for  TRUTH  is fallen in the  street    i e  the TRUTH of conviction or acquittal by legal process  "is fallen"    and  EQUITY  cannot enter  which must generally be the case when WILL is set up  above law  but hear the prophet  Yes  TRUTH  says he  faileth and he that departeth from evil maketh himself a prey  or as we read in the margin  "is accounted mad"  ie in the o∣pinion of those detestable politicians who  do evil that good may come    and the Lord  Jehovah  saw and it displeased him that there was  NO JUDGE∣MENT    so that it can never be either  lawful  or  expedient  to re∣move the  "due process of the law"  from the reach of innocent persons by  suspen∣sion  or in any other manner  And he saw that  there was  no man  that is  no man  to stand in the gap for the defence of his ETERNAL LAW which is explained by the th verse  None calleth for justice    more pro∣perly  for RIGHTEOUSNESS or "THE COMMON RIGHT" of the people  nor any pleadeth for truth  c Neither  prince prelate  nor  judge  it seems were inclined to  enter a protest  in favour of immutable  justice  and  right  Horrible depravity  And he  the almighty  wondered that there was no intercessor therefore his arm brought salvation unto him and his  RIGHTEOUSNESS  it sus∣tained him For he put on  RIGHTEOUS∣NESS  as a breastplate and an helmet of salvation  i e  in behalf of the poor and those that were unjustly op∣pressed    upon his head and he put on the garments of  VENGEANCE for  cloathing and was clad with  ZEAL  as a cloke  And then follows  THE LAW OF RETRIBUTION    "According to their deeds accordingly he will repay  FURY  to his adversaries  RECOMPENCE" or retribution  "to his enemies to  THE ISLANDS  he will  REPAY RETRIBUTION  "  Where then if we have any belief in God's  eternal law  is the boasted  "om∣nipotence of parliament"  Or who can be truly  "loyal"  in the proper sense of that epithet but those who acknowledge that the former is  unchangeable  and that  com∣mon right  and the justice due to  in∣nocent  persons can never be SUSPENDED without  rebellion against  GOD For there is  no salvation  for man without CHARI∣TY and our common law teaches us that "the highest"  and therefore  the most indispensable  CHARITY  is to do  JUSTICE  to all and every single soul at  ALL TIMES  so that A TIME of NECESSITY I mean SUCH A TIME as is generally called so will afford but a poor excuse for so notorious a breach of this  FIRST  principle of  CHARITY  Summa  CARITAS  est facere  JUSTI∣TIAM  singulis et omnibus  OMNI TEM∣PORE  My countrymen in general I fear are too depraved to bear all the  truths  of my remonstrance but I cannot now be silent without guilt  Many are the limitations of  the law of reason  too numerous to be here re∣cited which necessarily annul  all acts of legislature  that unhappily exceed them  Against this law  i e  the law of reason    prescription  STATUTE  nor custom may not prevail and if any be brought in against it they be not pre∣scriptions  STATUTES  nor  CUSTOMS  but    COR∣RUPTELAE CORRUPTIONS  Et contra eam  viz legem rationis  non est praescriptio vel ad appositum  STATUTUM  sive consuetudo et si aliqua fiant  NON

in p be duly regarded And  the second foundation  of our excellent  legal  establish∣ment acknowledges no fewer  limitations of legislature  than there are  divine  pre∣cepts of  morality  and  justice  in the Holy Scriptures For  THE SECOND FOUNDA∣TION  of the law of England is the  LAW OF GOD  against which the haughty  omnipotence of parliament  the pope of England has not the least authority to ordain any thing insomuch that  if  ANY STATUTE  is set forth  AGAINST  them it ought to be esteemed of  NO FORCE  in the law of England    Etiam si aliquod statutum esse editum contra  eos  probably miswritten for  eas  leges divinas or  eam  legem divinam  nullius vigoris in legibus Angliae censeri debet  c Doct et Stud c vi p  b  For if FOUNDATIONS are removed the whole fabric of our  law  and political constitu∣tion must precipitate into destruction  I appeal to the JUDGES THEMSELVES for the  truths  which I here assert  They know the foundations of our law  they  know  that there are many  maxims  of a supe∣rior order  By maxims of a superior order I mean those inevitable and necessary conclusions of  reason  which belong to the  first foundation of English law  for though these may be justly included also in the  fourth foundation of our law  under the general head of  Max∣ims  yet they ought to be duly distinguished from those less obvious  maxims  which relate only to the general customs of the kingdom and have no claim to be ranked higher than  the fourth foundation  which bear ample testimony  to my doctrine that  justice  or  common right  can never be  suspended  without subverting the  legal  constitution of this kingdom  Si a  JURE  discedas  VA∣GUS  eris et erunt omnia omnibus  IN∣CERTA  If you depart from  COMMON RIGHT  you will become vague  or unsettled  and all things will be uncertain to all men  Co Lit and  Res est misera    Misera est servitus ubi  JUS  est  VAGUM  aut  INCERTUM  Affairs are in a wretched state    nay  it is de∣plorable slavery wherever justice  or common right  is vague or uncertain  Inst wherefore    Justitia nemini neganda est  "Justice must be denied to no man"  Justitia est cuili∣bet facienda  "Justice must be done to every man whatsoever"  Injusticia non est alicui  fa∣cienda  "Injustice must not be done to any man whatsoever"  Justitia non est neganda non  DIFFERENDA  "Justice must neither be denied nor delayed"  i e  nor  SUSPENDED  Jenk Cent And therefore no plea of  necessity  what∣ever can excuse so great an  evil  as a SUS∣PENSION  of justice  or  common right  This is confirmed also by another maxim  Melius est  OMNIA MALA  pati quam malo consentire  It is better to endure  ALL  adversities than to assert to  ONE  evil measure  Inst How much soever any particular man in au∣thority may be either inclined or think himself obliged to accommodate his opi∣nion to the present times of  violence  and  injustice  yet I flatter myself that there is not a single judge in the kingdom who will venture to set his face against these indispensable conclusions of  reason  and therefore to the  judges  I have appealed for the  truth  of my assertion that every  act of parliament which contains any thing in it contrary to these first  princi∣ples of  reason  and honesty  is  null  and  void  is a  corruption  and not  law  For statutes  Nec contra  RATIONEM  nec contra  LEGEM DIVINAM  existunt  Statutes  "cannot exist either against  REASON  or the  LAW DIVINE  "  Doct et Stud c de Diversis Statu∣tis because  Hae duae leges declinari non possunt  Because  "these two laws"  the law of reason and the law of God  "cannot abate or turn aside"  ib c and because the holy Scriptures denounce WO against the makers of  unjust laws    Wo  unto them that decree  UNRIGHTEOUS DE∣CREES  or laws  and write grie∣vousness  which  they have prescribed to turn aside the needy from  JUDGEMENT  which in Israel was a  judgement  of peers the judgement of the congregation  and to take away the right    or rather  "the judgement"  or  "process of the law"  for  the Hebrew word is    from the poor of my people that widows may be their prey and that they may rob the fa∣therless  And then follows the  retri∣bution  which proves that there never can be any NECESSITY for INJUSTICE  And what will you do in the day of visitation and in the desolation  which  shall come from far To whom will you flee for help and where will ye leave your glo∣ry  or in the plural  your honours  Isai x  No  necessity  therefore whatever can justify the adoption of an  unrighteous  or  unjust  measure by any legislature up∣on earth because no danger or evil what∣soever is so much to be dreaded as God's vengeance for the failure of  justice judge∣ment  and  righteousness  and therefore  "common right"  and  equal justice  which belong to God for the good of his peo∣ple are so interwoven and united with  the legal constitution of these kingdoms that to set them aside by public autho∣rity amounts to a  total subversion of the common law  and of course to the  legal  constitution of  these kingdoms  which no act of parliament can effect for that with respect to the legislature would be a sort of  felo de se  Whatever is destructive of the law cannot itself be law for then the law would be  felo de se  Lex quae leges avertit ipsa lex esse non potest  a thing divided against itself and therefore will not stand  Uhi non est pudor nec  cura juris  instabile regnum est  Judge Atkins p  a crime of the  highest treason  in all who voted for it for which they are liable to be impeach∣ed by the great body of the nation in case a political reformation should take place and precedents are not wanting for inflicting  capital punishment  on JUDG∣ES for enforcing  unjust laws  though the same had obtained the sanction of parliament To submit the  operation of law  to the WILL of the king and coun∣cil  which is done by this supposed act  That no judge  or justice of peace shall  bail or try any such person  or persons without order from his majesty's most honourable privycouncil  c any law statute usage  c  notwithstanding  boldly subverting at once the whole  legal  constitution  would tend to annul even THE KING'S AUTHORITY for it is laid down as an established principle of the British constitution by one of the best autho∣rities in our common law that  there is  NO KING  where  WILL  rules and not law  Non est enim rex ubi dominatur  voluntas  et non lex  so that a king of England ceases to be  king  when he ceases to be limited by the LAW as another old constitutional maxim also informs us  The law is the most high in∣heritance that the king has for if the  LAW  was not there would be  NO KING  nor inheritance  Le ley est le plus haute inhéritance que le roi ad car par  la ley  ilmême et tous ses sujets sont ru∣lés et si le ley ne fuit  nul  roi et nul inhéritance sera  Year Book Hen VI  and another max∣im  says  Cessa regnare si non vis judi∣care  Cease to reign if you will not do justice  The king therefore must not  deny  or  delay  common right and the insertion of a  "non obstante"  to set aside at once all  the laws statutes  and  usages  of the kingdom respecting THE PERSON∣AL PROTECTION of the subject is a manifest  subversion of our legal constitu∣tion  and consequently is HIGHTREA∣SON  against the king  as well as against the  state  and the  latter  is declared to be no less a crime than the  former    Non minor est proditio  LEGIS  quam  REGEM  velle perdere  So that such an attempt against  the law  is not only a most dangerous undermining of the  king's crown and dignity  but the highest act of  treason  and DISLOYALTY in the strictest sense of the word as  no man  can be LOYAL who votes for a  general suspension  of  all the  LAWS and  fences  of that  most valuable  right  of the subject the  right  to personal liberty  Such a suspension  of law  is too similar to that  non obstante  of pope Innocent IV "whereby" as the proctors of king Henry III declared  common right was annulled and authentic records render∣ed void    Per quam jus pro nihilo habetur et authentica scripta enervan∣tur  Judge Atkins Parl Tracts p And the same learned judge re∣marks that  it is part of the description given of  antichrist  by the prophet Da∣niel c  He shall think that he may change times and laws and they shall be given into his hands  P In the following paragraph he also cites bp Jewel's Exposition upon the Epistle to the Thessalonians fol viz  Antichrist  says the bishop  is there called  a man without order or LAW that man of sin which is one  of the peculiar notes of antichrist  He shall seek to be free and go at liberty he shall be tied to NO LAW neither of God nor man  Hence it is said of the pope that he is  So∣lutus  OMNI LEGE HUMANA  In iis quae  VULT  est ei pro ratione  VOLUN∣TAS  nec est qui dicat illi Domine cur ita facis Ille potest  SUPRA JUS DISPEN∣SARE  et de injustitia facere justitiam corrigendo jura et mutando  To set up the WILL and PLEASURE of man therefore above LAW or to pre∣tend to give a power to the king or  his privycouncil  to SUSPEND the  fun∣damental  LAWS  of the kingdom  is to render them    lawless  and  un∣limited  like the princes and powers of ANTICHRIST foretold in the second Psalm who say  Let us break their bonds asunder and cast away their cords from us  viz the  bonds  of  reason  law  and  natural justice  and the  cords  of allegiance to  divine authority  for to this effect I have seen a remark upon the text by judge Atkins though I cannot at present find the passage An act of parliament for so base a purpose as the establishment of an  unlimited power  is so far from deserving the name of  law  that it must necessarily be deemed a  sub∣version of law  as it sets up the  will  and  pleasure  of  man king and council  above the  operation of law  contrary to a funda∣mental principle of the constitution  More  SECURE  as well as  MORE POW∣ERFUL  is the effect  or operation  of  LAW  than the  WILL  and  PLEASURE  of man  Firmior et potentior est opera∣tio  LEGIS  quam  DISPOSITIO  hominis  Co Lit because  the man who is allowed more power than is just and equal  will  affect still more than is al∣lowed  Cui plus licet quam par est plus vult quam licet  Inst  From the unhappy experience of  all  nations in  all  ages this established doc∣trine of our  common law  may be amply proved and with respect to  the sup∣posed act  in question it is certainly liable to afford such opportunity and tempta∣tion to promote unjust charges against innocent persons arming a particular party with unconstitutional powers of oppression and iniquity to intimidate all honest and independant people that it is manifestly a  malum in se  as I have said which can never be made  lawful  nay the whole business is so  dis∣loyal  that it seems to be nothing less than  "framing mischief by a law"  which is the most dangerous as well as most  iniquitous  mode of oppression because it amounts to  an apostacy from God  as the Scriptures declare  Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee which formeth mis∣chief by a law  Ps And  again  Wo be to them that decree un∣righteous decrees and that write griev∣ousness which they have prescribed to turn aside the needy from  JUDGEMENT  c The very case in point Isaiah x See pages and We are bound by our baptismal vow to  "renounce the devil and all his works"  and of course it is our duty to resist and oppose  evil  to the utmost of our power otherwise we deserve not to be ranked with the  servants  and  soldiers  of the  "prince of peace"  because he is also the  king of  RIGHTEOUSNESS and therefore in a Christian community every  private  person every individual has an un∣doubted right to detect and protest against every  iniquity  and  injustice  even though it shall have obtained the sanction of the  public  legislature and it is a maxim of the common law that  Unusquisque paci et justitiae publicae tenetur succur∣rere  but the judges are still more  particularly bound both on account of their learning and office to point out and reject every ordinance of man that is contrary to  natural justice  and  the laws of God  And so far is it from being their du∣ty to obey or enforce any  such laws  that the common law has provided them a ready answer for refusing the functions of their office in such cases  Contra justitiam nihil possumus  for though they are officers of the king and people and sit in the  king's judgement seat  judging in  his  name yet their duty respecting  common right  and  natural justice  does not depend  on the king  nor any other but on GOD alone as I have already remarked for they  judge not for man but for the Lord  c d Chron xix And again  Ye shall not be afraid of the face of man  which excludes all partial influence of kings or any other human powers  for the judgement is God's  Deut i  And all judges ought to be deeply impressed with that indispensable doctrine of our common law that  it is infinitely more heinous to offend  ETER∣NAL  than  TEMPORAL  majesty  for it is a maxim  Gravius est  ETERNAM  quam  TEMPORALEM  laedere  MAJES∣TATEM  Thus stands THE LAW OF GOD respecting  judges  and THE LAW OF GOD is always to be esteemed an unalienable and unchangeable part of THE LAW OF ENGLAND See p  Both the king and his judges are sworn as I have already observed p  not to delay or deny common right  and there∣fore no danger or other  evil  whatsoever against which men have ever pleaded a NECESSITY of  suspending  the laws of protection from innocent persons can be so great an  evil  or be so imminently dangerous in itself as that very measure of  suspension  No NECESSITY whatsoe∣ver  can be so deplorable or so disgrace∣fully injurious to the state as the  measure itself  and therefore there never can be a  necessity  for such a MEASURE and the same may be said with unquestionable truth concerning every other MEASURE of  oppression  and  injustice  but more par∣ticularly may it be said of that other most notorious and  iniquitous  mode of  suspend∣ing  or rather  annulling  all  the laws  of British freedom in the case of  seamen  I mean the IMPRESSING  The form of  presswarrants  and the  expressions  used therein may perhaps be very ancient and those expressions viz  impress  and  pressmoney  per∣haps according to the ancient meaning of them may be innocent and  legal  but no RIGHT or prerogative either by  usage  or  prescription  is thereby to be pre∣sumed in favour of the  modern sense  in which they are now usually interpreted  viz  as a warrant to take a man  by force  to drag him away like a thief to a  floating prison  the most dangerous and detestable of all others that by  imprisonment  and  duress  he may be compelled to enter into an  involuntary servitude  What is this but a  true  definition of the most absolute slaveryAnd yet it is  equally true  when applied to the case of  pressed seamen  onboard the tenders and hulks But let us examine by what authority this is done and then judge whether the supposed  prerogative  is  legal  The warrant is signed by  the lords commis∣sioners of the admiralty and their secretary  who claim no other authority in their justification than what is expressed in the beginning of the warrantviz  "In pursuance of his majesty's order in council dated"  c c  Now unhappily for  the lords of the admiralty and their secretary  if they should be duly prosecuted for their misdemeanor neither  his majesty  nor  the privycouncil  neither any of them separately nor all of them together have any  legal  power to commit or  distrain  an innocent man of his liberty because all power for any such purposes was taken from them by authority of parliament and the act is still in full force See Cha I c x The purpose of this act is expressly  "for the regulating the privycouncil"  as well as  for taking away the court commonly called the starchamber  In the preamble of this act the Great Charter is ci∣ted that  No freeman shall be  TAKEN  or  IM∣PRISONED  or disseized of his freehold or  LIBER∣TIES  c but by lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land  and also besides several others that inestimable statute of Edw III cap iii that  No man of what estate or condition soever he be shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor  TAKEN  nor  IMPRISONED  c without being brought in to answer  BY DUE PROCESS OF LAW  so that the whole statute of Cha I c x must be construed according to the true spirit of these golden laws of liberty and more especially the th section of it where we read  That if  ANY PERSON  here can be no exception to the prejudice of seamen  shall hereafter be  COMMITTED RESTRAINED OF HIS LIBERTY  or  SUFFER IM∣PRISONMENT  by the order or decree of any such court of starchamber  c mentioning several other courts and then adds  OR  by the command  OR WAR∣RANT  of  THE KING'S MAJESTY  his heirs or succes∣sors in their own person or by the command or  WAR∣RANT  of the  COUNCELBOARD  or of any of the lords or others of  HIS MAJESTY'S PRIVYCOUNCIL  that in  EVERY  such case  EVERY PERSON  so committed restrained of his liberty or suffering imprisonment    which necessarily includes the case of  "every person" "  restrained of his  liberty"  or  taken or imprison∣ed  by  a presswarrant  especially as  his majesty's order in council  which is  expressly  limited by this act is the only authority cited by the  admiralty  for issuing such warrants since the clause of  non obstante statuto  has been declared VOID in law  upon de∣mand or motion made  says the act  by his coun∣sel or other employed by him for that purpose unto the  JUDGES  of the court of  KING'SBENCH  or  COM∣MONPLEAS  in open court  SHALL WITHOUT DE∣LAY UPON ANY PRETENCE WHATSOEVER  for the ordinary dues usually paid for the same have forthwith granted unto him a writ of  HABEAS CORPUS  to be directed generally unto all and every sheriff goaler minister  OFFICER  or other person in whose custody the party so committed or restrained shall be  c And after describing the mode of making the return to the writ the statute directs the court that they  shall thereupon do what to  JUSTICE  shall appertain either by delivering bailing or  REMANDING  the prisoner and if any thing shall be otherwise wilfully done or omitted to be done  BY ANY JUDGE JUS∣TICE OFFICER  or other person aforementioned con∣trary to the direction and  TRUE MEANING  hereof  necessarily including the "TRUE MEANING" like∣wise of all the acts recited in the preamble so that if A JUDGE should presume to  remand  into confinement any  man of what estate or condition soever he be  that has been  TAKEN or IMPRISONED c WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW    that then  says the act  such person so offending shall forfeit to the party grieved his  TREBLE DAMAGES  to be reco∣vered by such means and in such manner as is formerly in this act limited and appointed for the like penalty to be sued for and recovered  c  In the preamble of the Petition of Rights Cha I the same noble declarations of British liberty drawn from the ancient statutes against  taking and imprisoning a man without due process of the law  are expressly recited and confirmed see d and th § as well as in the lastmentioned act And the  judges  are likewise expressly directed BY BOTH ACTS to grant "WRITS OF HABEAS CORPUS" for immediate relief from all such  illegal  imprisonments whether committed by authority of the  king  or of the  privycouncil  so that there are two  habeas corpus  acts pre∣vious to and of equal authority with that which commonly engrosses the title of  the Habeas Corpus Act  though it is in reality only a supplement to the two former acts being clearly intended to supply all that could be thought insufficient for the security of the subject's  liberty  in the former acts above recited be∣ing intitled"  An Act for the  BETTER SECURING  the Liberty of the Subject c  " See stat Cha II c ii And therefore whatever may seem  doubtful  or not suf∣ficiently expletive therein must necessarily be con∣strued  in favour of liberty  according to the established rules and maxims of the common law  "  Impius et crudelis judicandus est qui  LIBERTATI  non favet  " Co Lit from Fortescu  Impious and cruel is that man to be esteemed who does not  favour  liberty    Angliae jura in omni casu  LIBERTATI  dant savorem  See Prin Leg et Aequit p from Fortescu  The laws of England  FAVOUR  liberty  IN EVERY CASE  And the learned chancellor Fortescu himself expresses this  noble principle  still more fully in c xlvii p  e laud Leg Ang  Humana natura in  LIBERTATIS  causa  FAVOREM  semper  MAGIS QUAM IN ALIIS CAUSIS  deprecetur  c  In the cause of  LIBERTY  human nature  ALWAYS  implores  FAVOUR  more than in any other cause  If a judge therefore should  remand  a man into any such illegal imprisonment he immediately by the in∣evitable construction of these laws  This truth is also farther testified by the arguments and autho∣rities collected in Bushel's case reported by Ld C J Vaughan p  viz  When a man is brought by  HABEAS CORPUS  to the court and upon return of it it appears to the court that he was against law  IM∣PRISONED  and  DETAINED  though there be no cause of privilege for him in this court he shall never be by the act of the court  REMANDED  to his unlawful imprisonment for then  THE COURT  should do an act of  INJUS∣TICE  in imprisoning him  DE NOVO AGAINST LAW  whereas the the great charter is Quod nullus liber homo  IMPRISONETUR NISI PER LEGEM TERRAE  c  becomes a party in the injury for the illegality of  remanding  a man brought up by HABEAS CORPUS where  no cause is certified  that is no  legal  cause is severely con∣demned in the th sect of  the Bill of Rights  and the subsequent act of Cha I c x gives a penalty of  treble damages  as I have already remarked And what is worse if any judge should be guilty of such  injustice  in the case of a  pressed man  he would be lia∣ble to still greater penalties because the case of  pressing  necessarily includes not only the circumstances of  taking and imprisoning a man without due process of the law  but also the intention of carrying him a pri∣soner  "out of the realm"  whereby the judges so of∣fending become liable to all the penalties of the last supplemental  habeas corpus act  which is treble costs and  l  damages  at the least  a disability to bear any office of trust or profit under the crown besides all the other penalties of a  premunire  which the king  cannot pardon  the person or persons who shall knowingly frame contrive write seal or countersign  ANY WARRANT  or writing  for such commitment detainer  imprisonment  or  TRANSPORTATION  or shall so commit detain imprison or  TRANSPORT  any person or persons contrary to this act or be  ANY WAYS ADVISING AID∣ING OR ASSISTING THEREIN  which must inevitably include the act of REMANDING  being lawfully convicted thereof shall  besides the penalties of  treble costs and £    damages  mentioned in the former part of the section  be disabled from thenceforth to bear any office of trust or profit within the said realm of England c and shall incur and sustain the pains penalties c in and by the sta∣tute of provision and premunire cand be  INCAPABLE OF ANY PARDON FROM THE KING  his heirs c  Stat Car II § xii And by the x § a forfeit of  l  is awarded against any judge for refusing the writ of HABEAS CORPUS even though demand∣ed in time of vacation  The plea of  necessity  for the service will not excuse them because that very plea in the very same case  the necessity for the sea service  viz for  the good and safety of the kingdom in general c and the whole king∣dom in danger  and a stronger or more urgent  necessity  cannot be expressed yet it was deemed INSUFFI∣CIENT to  justify  the opinion of  all the judges  in favour of extorting SHIPMONEY Cha I c and much more  insufficient  will it be to excuse the violent and forci∣ble  "taking and imprisoning"  of SHIPMEN because the  persons  of men are infinitely more sacred in law than their pecuniary property for it is an unquestionable maxim that  LAW  regards  THE PERSON  above his possessions  LIFE AND LIBERTY MOST  c Prin Leg et Aeq p And as  the inheritance of the law  by an established maxim already quoted is said to de∣scend  unicuique nostrum    to  EVERY ONE  of us  without exception the SEAMEN are surely as much entitled to claim their  inheritance  and RIGHT to the whole benefit of the law as any other part of the com∣munity for they cannot be excluded because ano∣ther excellent maxim says  Turpis est  PARS  quae non convenit cum suo  TOTO  Plowden  Shame∣ful is▪ that part  of a community  which is not suited with its whole  body So that if SEAMEN are denied  the benefit and protection of the laws  on the part of government such a denial unavoidably tends to slacken and untie the  bands of allegiance  on the part of the seamen who are thereby compelled to under∣take their own protection and defence whenever  the law  is denied them for the ties of allegiance must necessa∣rily be reciprocal according to the first principles of social government because the protection of  natural right  is the  first foundation of English law  which no act of parliament has any authority  to subvert  and the useful order of  seamen  in particular cannot be de∣nied  the protection of the law  without the most stimula∣lating provocation to resistance in their own defence because it is agreeable to a fundamental maxim of the British constitution of state that  Nothing is more in∣tolerable in law than that any one part of the communi∣ty should be esteemed under a different law from the rest  Nihil in lege intolerabilius est candem rem diverso jure censeri  and another maxim says    Turpis est pars quae non convenit cum suo toto  for there can be no such thing as  common right  wherever this is the caseThus I have endeavoured to express the  right of seamen  in as plain and intelligible terms as I could that every  common seaman  of  common sense  may be able to discern the  inesti∣mable value  of his  best inheritance  THE LAW and I shall always esteem it  my duty to God  to maintain and defend their rights to the utmost of my power  them into ser∣vice  by  force  and  violence  which the most dissolute of public ministers never pre∣sumed  to palliate or excuse by any o∣ther plea than this mere bugbear NE∣CESSITY  It is a practice so notoriously repugnant to  common right  and equity so funda∣mentally  subversive of the most essential and indispensable principles of our happy  legal establishment and at the same time so impious a violation of that  na∣tural  equality  with respect  to law jus∣tice  and  personal protection  which the  Almighty himself has commanded to be maintained  "without respect of persons"  that even an act of parliament cannot make it  lawful  for  God is no respecter  of  persons  Acts x  He ac∣cepteth not the persons of princes nor re∣gardeth the rich  MORE THAN POOR  for they are all the work of his hands  Job xxxiv  He hath made the small and the great  AND CARETH FOR ALL ALIKE  Wisdom vi And with respect to  equal justice  God's direction to judges is part of the  moral law  which is still binding  they shall judge the peo∣ple with  JUST JUDGEMENT  Thou shalt not wrest judgement Thou  SHALT NOT RESPECT PERSONS  neither take  a gift  According to the common law of England also BRIBERY or the  taking of gifts  is esteemed a most  hei∣nous crime  in JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS yet it is much  more heinous  because more dangerous in LEGISLA∣TION insomuch that a JUST SUSPICION of  undue in∣fluence  by  private pensions places held during pleasure  c is sufficient also to  vitiate  and  annul  the proceed∣ings even of a LEGISLATURE and therefore when wicked and corrupt men in the administration of  any  government presume to varnish over their ille∣gal proceedings with the specious pretence of  vindi∣cating and establishing legislative authority  and yet at the same time by sapping its  honour  and  dignity  with the baneful influence of  pensions  and such other BRIBERY do notoriously practice the most effectual means to undermine and destroy itsuch men I say must be deemed  traitors  and  unpardonable hypocrites  whom NATIONAL JUSTICE will mark for the future vengeance of a much  injured  and hitherto  DELUDED PEO∣PLE  if they do not repent before the measure of their iniquity be fulfilled and heartily adopt some prudent plan of political reformation  c Deut xvi The fashionable  sneer  therefore of some mo∣dern lawyers against the  just  doctrine concerning  "the equality of mankind"  savours of a lamentable ignorance in  the first principles  of their profession relating to  "common right"  or  justice  All that I have said against the  supposed act  for  suspending the law  would be e∣qually applicable to an act of parliament for  impressing  either  seamen  or any other rank or denomination of British subjects because it would be a real  suspension  with respect to  one part  of the community of all the most valuable acts of parliament which are deemed the pillars of the con∣stitution though the learned judge Foster has prostituted his pen by asserting that it is  not inconsistent with any statute  That learned man surely did not con∣sider that the practice of  impressing  as now carried on necessarily includes the circumstances of  taking  and  im∣prisoning  without  due process of the law  which is expressly prohibited not only by  one  statute but by many  sta∣tutes  The very first  statute  in our book ordains that  No freeman shall be  TA∣KEN  or  IMPRISONED  c but by the  lawful judgement of his peers or by the  LAW OF THE LAND  which in a∣nother recital  by parliamentary authority  is explained to signify  process of the law  And another venerable statute which like Magna Charta has been so frequently confirmed by other acts of parliament in different periods that  no single parliament  can have sufficient au∣thority to repeal it expressly ordains that  No man of what estate or condition that he be  so that there can be no excep∣tion of SEAMEN  shall be put out of land or tenements nor  TAKEN  nor  IMPRISONED  nor disinherited  and the protection of THE LAW is already shewn to be our  most valuable  inheritance  nor put to death without being brought to answer by  DUE PROCESS OF LAW  Stat Ed III c This excellent statute and the clause above quoted from the GreatCharter are both  expressly re∣cited  and  confirmed  in the Bill of Rights  Cha I c and also in the act for  regulating the privycouncil  Cha I c So that judge Foster's assertion in favour of  pressing  viz that it is  not in∣consistent with any statute  is an unpar∣donable instance of disingenuity For what  "due process of law"  can be pointed out to justify or warrant the  taking im∣prisoning  and  disinheriting  of his  most  va∣luable  inheritance  THE LAW an innocent sailor An  admiraltywarrant  cannot be considered as a  due process of the law  to justify any such  taking im∣prisoning c  because it is founded on no other authority than that of  the king and council  whose warrant  for any such purposes  is rendered totally  illegal  by authority of an act of parliament still in force Cha I c so that if a judge should presume to  remand  a man to confinement that has been  taken and imprisoned  by any such  warrant  which is  illegal  and of course no  pro∣cess  of law  he would be liable to an impeachment of  hightreason to the state  for promoting an  illegal  power and pre∣tension of the crown in direct opposition to  a solemn act of the whole legislature  For the same reasons every magis∣trate who presumes to  back a presswar∣rant  is also highly criminal and makes himself an  adviser  and  party  in a most notorious breach of the king's peace because the effect of promoting an  illegal  warrant to  suspend  as much as in him lies the laws of the king's peace  common right  and  personal protection  from any of the  king's subjects  and this even in the  king's name  must necessarily  suspend  also at the same time the  allegiance  of the persons injured for so a long time as they are in any actual danger and they are permitted even by the FIRST  foun∣dation  of the English law  Primum fundamentum legis Angliae est lex  RATIO∣NIS  Doct et Stud c    Insuper lex ratio∣nis permittit plurima fieri ut scilicet quod  LICITUM EST  vim vi repellere et quod fas est  UNICUIQUE  seamen not excepted  se tueri et rem suam defendere contra vim injustam  Doct et Stud c ii  to repel force with force and to defend themselves and their own property against  UNJUST  violence  And they are not deemed guilty of  murder  even if they  kill  the assailants provided the  killing  be  inevi∣table  in their defence and that they can∣not otherwise maintain their rightsNay men are not only  justified  in defend∣ing  themselves  with force and arms but may also legally  defend  and  rescue  any o∣ther person whatever that is attacked or oppressed by an  unlawful violence  though he be totally unknown to the rescuers For this was literally the case of Hopkins Hugget and three others an adjudged case in B R Car who in at∣tempting to  rescue  a stranger from the  custody of some  pressmasters  in Smith∣field happened to kill one of them  This was but manslaughter  says Ld C J Holt  See his Report of  "Regina versus Mawgridge"  published at the end of Ld C J Kelyng's Reports of which judge Holt was the editor Some stress has been laid on the circumstance in the above case that  "the piece of paper"  which the pressmasters shewed to Hugget c  "was not a sufficient warrant"  This is indeed readily allowed and we may safely add that if the  lord admiral himself  had attended to assist his  pressmasters  his authority in this case would have been as insignificant as that of any other man since the baneful clause of  "Non obstante statuto"  in the  lord admiral's patent  is declared  null and void  and e∣ven if  the king  at that time and the  lords of the privycouncil  had also attended in person with the BEST WARRANT they could make it would still have been  "an insufficient warrant"  to justify any such vio∣lent attacks upon the liberty of innocent subjects and the same  judgement in law  must inevitably have been given supposing the LAW to be DULY MAIN∣TAINED as in the recited case because the  meanest subjects  are as much entitled to  the protection of the law  as a king is to  his crown  and consequently are  equally  justified in defending it and in resisting  unlawful  force with force according to the  first foundation of the English law  as already recited For it is a maxim in law that  "the king can order nothing"  i e nothing of legal process  except by a court legally appointed  Rex nil potest jubere nisi per curiam legitime constitu∣tam  Now as all pretence of  legal power  in the capaci∣ty of a court of law is taken from the  king and council  by express act of parliament it would be absurd to attribute to their  warrants and orders  or the  admiralty presswarrants  which are founded on no other autho∣rity the least  legal  authority as  "a sufficient warrant"  to justify the  taking  and  imprisoning  any man whatsoe∣ver because they are not nor cannot be considered as any part of "THE DUE PROCESS OF THE LAW" which alone can justify the  taking  and  imprisoning  Bri∣tish subjects And therefore as  pressgangs  officers as well as men are manifestly employed in an  unlawful  business acting WITHOUT LAW there is no crime in  beating  or even in  killing  them if they cannot other∣wise be repelled which must necessarily be deemed a  justifiable manslaughter  "SE DEFENDENDO" because it is a maxim that  where there is  NO LAW  there is no  TRANSGRESSION  Ubi non est  LEX  ibi non est  TRANSGRESSIO  And another maxim says  In vain doth that man implore the aid  or protec∣tion  of  LAW  who strives to subvert even the  LAW  itself    Frustra  LEGIS  auxilium implorat qui  LEGES IPSAS  subvertere conatur  which must ine∣vitably be deemed the case of  pressgangs  insomuch that judge Foster himself if he meant to act according TO LAW must have directed the jury to find  the same  verdict in his famous reported case of  Alexander Broadfoot  even if instead of a  common sailor  belong∣ing to  the pressgang  Broadfoot had shot the lieutenant of the gang or even the captain himself with the  ad∣miralty warrant  in his hand because the same  just objection  would still have held good against the pressgang  viz"that they acted without legal warrant"  for an admiralty warrant to impress seamen is  no legal warrant  or  "process of the law"  to  take  or  imprison  any man whatsoever and therefore all the pains that have been taken by that learned man to dis∣guise and confound the true  legal  state of the case are frivolous and unworthy his rank and character    for when the liberty of  one subject is invaded it affects all the rest it is a provocation to all people as  being of ill example and pernicious conse∣quence  In short that excellent adage for all the ordinary circumstances of life viz "  Honesty the best  POLICY" will be found to hold equally good in real  poli∣tics  or affairs of government even throughout the most dangerous and a∣larming difficulties and emergencies of state because if we entertain any real be∣lief in divine Providence examples may be produced from the histories of all na∣tions to demonstrate that the crafty re∣finements of mere  worldly policy  do fre∣quently  hasten or produce the very evils they were intended to avert An ad∣ministration of  government  therefore which cannot subsist with  law justice  and  common honesty  is  unfit to subsist at all  be∣cause  law  is the only basis of  good and law∣ful government  so that no man can be es∣teemed truly  loyal  who thinks otherwise and though several precedents for  sus∣pending  THE LAW both in pressing and other cases may easily be produced yet they can afford no justification or ex∣cuse for such measures because the  ini∣quity  of them still remains and  Malum quo communius eo pejus  so that the citing  bad presidents  is a manifest aggravation of the  treason  And it is a maximthat  PEACE IS THE LIFE OF THE COM∣MONWEALTH LIBERTY THE SOUL OF IT AND THE LAWS IT'S BODY    VITA REIPUBLICAE PAX ET A∣NIMUS LIBERTAS ET CORPUS LE∣GES  And therefore the hateful  measure of SUSPENDING THE LAWS under a pretended  necessity  of carrying on a cruel WAR against the advocates for LIBERTY ought to be deemed an at∣tempt to destroy the LIFE SOUL and BODY  of the republic  Great is the TRUTH and stronger than all thingsit liveth and conquer∣eth for evermore With her there is no ACCEPTING OF PERSONS or RE∣WARDS she doeth the things that are JUST and refraineth from ALL UN∣JUST and WICKED THINGS Nei∣ther in her JUDGEMENT or decree is any UNRIGHTEOUSNESS and she is the STRENGTH KINGDOM POWER and MAJESTY of all ages  BLESSED BE THE GOD OF TRUTH
