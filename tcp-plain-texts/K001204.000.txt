 HOUSE OF COMMONS  Tuesday    th December    MR FRANCIS  MR SPEAKER  Before I offer any thing to the consideration of the House  the present occasion I beg leave to return my very sincere  nksnot to my honourable friends near me for that I am  rly unequal to but to the two honourable gentlemen  o spoke first on the other side of the House for the candid  en and liberal manner in which they have explained the  und of their opposition to the motion They think and  ey declare that having had a duel with Mr Hastings I  ght not to be employed in impeaching him This is the  st time I ever heard the objection stated in a regular par  mentary way I am indebted to them therefore not only  the fair and honourable terms in which they have ex  ssed it but even for the objection itself because it has re  ved me from great anxiety I now understand what the  ection is and what it is notit is a scruple that regards  oint of honorIt is not an imputationIt is not a re  ach I have attended this debate Sir of which I knew I  to be the subject very much against my inclination It  not an easy situation but I could not avoid it with pro  ety I thought it would be proper and becoming in me  appear and be ready to answer or to explain any thing  ich in the judgement of the House might call for expla  ion Nothing of that kind having occurred I shall not  e occasion to solicit your attention for more than a few  utes It has been formally and explicitly stated to you  great authority that the point in debate is not a question  rgument but of feeling This is the avowed principle on  ich the motion is opposed I do not mean to object to  state of the question or to any other on which any  tleman may choose to consider it Allow me only to ex  ss my hopes that gentlemen who are so properly and ho  rably careful of their own feelings will not confine  r attention to themselves but have some consideration  tenderness for the feelings of others The very care  which they guard their own sensations intitles me to  ect that they will be equally cautious of wounding the  or of an individual to whom no offence is imputed  t would be a poor and useless affectation in me to pre  that I received the vote which past a few days ago  indifference or indeed without serious concern I  could not but be sensible of the turn that would be given  it and of the impression it would probably make abroad  my disadvantage I could not see myself excluded fro  sharing in the labours of my honorable friend without loo  +ing back to the situation in which I was forced to aband  him with the deepest regret His abilities are equal to t  task he has undertaken if any human abilities are equal  it Of this heavy burthen he must now support  my  share  well as his own yet the labours which had necessarily fall  to his lot required no addition In saying this howev  or in any thing else which I may say to the same effect  most earnestly wish to guard myself against an obvious m  construction While I lament the consequence of the v  that excludes me from any share in the impeachment of M  Hastings let no man think it possible that I mean to solic  the House to alter their resolutionI deny and disclaim t  intention and deprecate the imputation of itSetting asi  the single consideration of the assistance I owe to my hono  +able friend what can I desire better for myself than to  excluded without disgrace from any farther concern in t  toilsome invidious and most unthankful office If I am a  +tional creature if I have not utterly lost my understandi  what could I imagine more for my honor for my advantag  and for my happiness than to be dismissed by an act of pow  at this particular point of time at this particular stage  the business from any further share in it My object as  as I had any personal object in the prosecution of Mr Ha  +ings is accomplished The House have approved and co  +firmed the principles of my opposition to him and adopt  my opinion of his conduct In condemning  him  they ha  acquitted  me  The impeachment must go to trial Thus  I have voluntarily and zealously taken part in the proce  +tion of Mr Hastings and thus far it has succeeded So  men think that I have had a principal share in this busine  others are ready enough to affirm that I am the sole author  it all The fact is that in the face of a thousand difficulti  our joint and common efforts have hitherto been reward  with success I am now discharged from the conduct of  cause which of my own accord undoubtedly I should nev  have abandoned If it should fail hereafter I shall have n  +thing to answer for It will belong to others to answer  the event if the event should finally disappoi  expectation of justice I have called the vote by  ave been dismissed strictly and exclusively an act of p  r  cannot call it a prudential act because no motives of pru  ence were assigned for it I cannot call it a judicial act  ithout attacking the justice of the House and affronting  he honor of every individual who took part in it To affirm  r to suppose that this House could intend to express a cen  ure in that censure to inflict a punishment and in that pu  ishment to convey a disgrace the severest of all punishment to an honorable mindwithout a hearing of parties without a charge or defence without evidence or inquirywould be to accuse this House of a shameful violation of very principle of justice and of totally forgetting their own  onor as well as mine  I do not mean Sir to enter at all into the reasons which  ught to induce the House to reject or agree to the present  otion The arguments on one side have been stated with  nexampled eloquence and abilities and nothing has been  pposed to them on the other Whether the character of  nemy be incompatible with that of accuser whether it be  r be not a wise principle to endeavour to engage the pas  ons of individuals on the side of justice whether it be per  ectly clear that this House acting not merely for themselves  ut in a fiduciary capacity for all the Commons of Great  ritain are warranted in laying aside those instruments  hich are most likely to act with vigor and activity in the  ause of national justice are questions which I submitwill not say with indifference but with perfect resignation  o the judgement of the House At the same time Sir though  have no manner of anxiety about the conclusion I should  e regardless of the truth and careless of my honour if I  ffered the premises to be taken for granted I deny that I  m or ever was the enemy of Mr Hastings in that personal  nse in which it is imputed to me When I moved the re  enue charge some months ago the House condescended to  sten with attention to a short narrative of all the transac  ons between me and Mr Hastings I thought and was as  red that they were satisfied with my conduct They  d already appointed me  April  one of the Secret Committee for  reparing the impeachment and they resolved to impeach him  n the particular charge moved by me  April For the question against it total  It is true the House  was not very full that day many gentlemen who now hear me must have been absent I shall therefore request your permission to repeat the substance of what I submitted to you on that occasion without argument or detail All I mean is to state the facts briefly and to leave the results from them to be determined by their impression on the minds of every man of honour who hears me I was appointed by Parliament with Sir John Clavering and Colonel Monson to a place in the government of Bengal in conjunction with Mr Hastings whom we had never seen We went to India prejudicedpassionately prejudiced in his favour Almost instantly after our arrival there we found reasons to abandon the opinion we had formed of him and instead of supporting we attacked him At that moment at least there could be no personal animosity in us towards a man who had never personally offended us From the moment we knew him  our opposition to him began and was continued by each o  us without intermission as long as we had the power of opposing him Whatever may be thought of  my  character  no man I believe will attribute the conduct of my honor+able colleagues to base vindictive motives This honorabl  House I am sure will never concur in any thing that offer  an indignity to the venerable names of Clavering and Mon+son In the year a pacification took place between Mr Hastings and me the reasons and purposes of which it i  unnecessary to mention as they are fully stated in the Reports of the Select Committee Out of this pacification a differenc  between us unfortunately arose which ended in a duel O  the merits of the question I say nothing The language h  made use of on the records of the council obliged me to seek for reparation in point of honour at the hazard of my life It would be absurd to call it revenge The aggresso  in effect is the challenger and meets his opponent on equa  terms It is but justice to him to say that he behaved himself perfectly well in the field It was my lot to fall A  the approach of death which I thought inevitable the af+fairs of this world in a moment lost all their importance  the veil was removed I thought of nothing then but to d  in peace with all men particularly with Mr Hastings  called him to me gave him my hand and desired him to con+sider in what situation my death would leave him By tha  action and by those words undoubtedly I meant to declar  that I freely forgave him the insult he had offered me an  the fatal consequence which had attended it I meant that we should stand in the same relation to each other as if the duel and the cause of it had never happened But did I tell him that if I survived I would renounce the whole plan and principle of my public life that I would cease to oppose his measures that I would desert the charges which I had already brought against him or not prosecute him by public impeachment if I could No Sir never nor am I charged with it If I had done so I must have dishonoured myself for ever without a motive and without a compensation On my return to England I found that a parliamentary inquiry into the late transactions in India was already begun and I was almost immediately ordered to attend one of the Committees employed upon that inquiry Of those gentlemen who think that I ought not to appear against Mr Hastings I beg leave to ask  n what manner I ought to have acted Could I without treachery to the public refuse to give evidence or information necessary for the public service when it was demanded of me by the authority of the House of Commons or in fact was it in my power Will any man affirm that I had an option If not the single question is in what form and manner did it become me to appear and act as the accuser of Mr Hastings What in the character of evidence only Would that have been a part to which no enmity no malice could have been imputed Would it have been honorable in me to stand aloof or hide myself while in fact I supplied the information while I furnished the materials and prompted the prosecution or am I thought to have acted dishonorably because I declared myself the public responsible accuser of Mr Hastings because I avowed my principles because I stood forward in the charge and hazarded all those consequences of obloquy retaliation and revenge which a public prosecutor must encounter but which a secret skulking accuser may very easily avoid These are questions I trust which answer themselves in the mind of every man of honor Sir I do not mean to say that the circumstance of my having had a duel with Mr Hastings never occurred to me as an objection which possibly might have weight with others though it appeared to me of no consequence It did certainly occur to me as a doubt on which I ought not to trust entirely to my own judgement But the honourable person whom I consulted is no more and for that reason I have hitherto been tender of mentioning his name They who  knew Sir William Draper I am sure will acknowledge that there could not be a stricter and more scrupulous judge of points of honor than he was If it were possible to produce the opinion he gave me in approbation of the conduct I have pursued I should look no farther But there is an authority to the same effect which I am able to produce and which though negative in its form I doubt not will be deemed equivalent to any positive opinion whatever I have now been engaged above two years in constant intercourse and connection with twenty gentlemen of the first character in this kingdom and in constant conversation with them on the subject of this impeachment I mean particularly the gentlemen who compose the present Committee as well as many others I appeal to their testimony I appeal specially to the honourable General Officer  General Burgoyne  near me whose opinion I believe will be allowed to be authority not only to me but to the world Did any of these gentlemen ever directly or indirectly signify to me a doubt about the propriety of my conduct If they did I call upon them now to declare it Is it a thing to be believed that if they had felt a scruple in point of honor on this subject they would never have expressed it to me or that they would have acted with me if I had known and disregarded their opinion  Thirteen years are now elapsed since I first was connected in office with Mr Hastings Six of them were wasted in India in perpetual contest with him Seven years ago I left him there in possession of absolute power In all that time no charges have been produced against me Yet I think it cannot be said that I have been particularly cautious not to provoke hostility or that there is no disposition any where to accuse me Surely Sir if accusation is ever to come it is high time it should appear If now or at any other period I should be obliged to change place with Mr Hastings if hereafter it should be my lot to be accused I shall assuredly never object to his being my prosecutor for though by removing a powerful a wellinformed and in the sense of the present argument an inveterate accuser I might provide for my safety my honor would be lost Let those gentlemen who are trusted with the care of Mr Hastings's honor consider what they are doing  I beg of gentlemen to observe that in the present question I am nothing but a passive instrument at the disposal of the House If they think fit to employ me I shall endeavour to execute their commands with industry and vigour if not I shall consider it as the happiest period at which I could receive my dismission and rejoice in the liberty to which it will restore me of turning my thoughts to some other object of applying my faculties to some other occupation That I should ever be engaged in another service so vexatious so laborious so invidious and so unprofitable as this has been I am sure is impossible  Mr Francis left the House as soon as he finished his speech
