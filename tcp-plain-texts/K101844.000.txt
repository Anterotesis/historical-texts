youstories about good boys and  naughty boys and silly boys for you know what it is to be good now And there is a story about two foolish Cocks that were always quarrelling which is very naughty You do not quarrel No I am glad of it but if you see any little boys that quarrel you may tell  them the story of the Two Cocks This is it  There was once a Hen who lived in a farmyard and she had a large brood of chickens She took a great deal of care of them and gathered them under her wings every night and fed them and nursed them  very well and they were all very good except two Cocks that were always quarrelling with one another They were hardly out of the shell before they began to peck at each other and when they grew bigger they fought till they were all bloody If one picked  up a barleycorn the other always wanted to have it They never looked pretty because their feathers were pulled off in fighting till they were quite bare and they picked at one another's eyes till they were both almost blind The old Hen very often told them  how naughty it was to quarrel so but they did not mind her  So one day these two Cocks had been fighting as they always did and the biggest Cock whose name was Chanticleer beat the other and crowed over him and drove  him quite out of the yard The Cock that had been beat slunk away and hid himself for he was vexed he had been conquered and he wanted sadly to be revenged but he  id not know how to manage  for he was not strong  ough himself So after  thinking a great deal he went to an old sly Fox that lived near and said to him Fox if you will come with me I will shew you where there is a large fat Cock in a farmyard and you may cat him up if you will The Fox was very glad for he was  hungry enough and he said Yes I will come with all my heart and I will not leave a feather of him So they went together and the Cock shewed Reynard the way into the farmyard and there was poor Chanticleer asleep upon the perch And  the Fox seized him by the neck and ate him up and the other Cock stood by and crowed for joy But when the Fox had done he said Chanticleer was very good but I have not had enough and so he flew upon the other  Cock and ate him up too in a moment  I will tell you a story  There was a little boy whose name was Harry and his papa and mamma sent  him to school Now Harry was a clever fellow and loved his book and he got to be first in his class So his mamma got up one morning very early and called Betty the maid and said Betty I think we must make a cake for Harry for he  has learned his book very well And Betty said Yes with all my heart So they made a nice cake It was very large and stuffed full of plums and sweetmeats orange and citron and it was iced all over with sugar it was white and smooth on  the top like snow So this cake was sent to the school When little Harry saw it he was very glad and jumped about for joy and he hardly stayed for a knife to cut a piece but gnawed it like a little dog So he ate till the bell rang for school and  after school he ate again and ate till he went to bed nay his bedfellow told me that he laid his cake under his pillow and sat up in the night to eat some So he ate till it was all goneBut presently after this little boy was very sick and ill  and every body said I wonder what is the matter with Harryhe used to be so brisk and play about more nimbly than any of the boys and now he looks pale and is very ill And somebody said Harry has had a rich cake and eat it all up very  soon and that has made him  So they sent for Dr  amomile and he gave him  do not know how much  tter stuff Poor Harry did  like it at all but he was  rced to take it or else he  ould have died you know  at last he got well again  but his mamma said  would send him no mo  cakes  Now there was anoth  boy who was one of Harry  schoolfellows his name  Peter the boys used  call him Peter Careful  Peter had written his mam  very neat pretty letter  ere was not one blot in  all So his mamma sent  a cake Now Peter  ought with himself I will  ot make myself sick with  is good cake as silly Harry  id I will keep it a great  hile So he took the cake  and tugged it up stairs I was very heavy he cou  hardly carry it And  locked it up in his box  once a day he crept slily  stairs and ate a very litt  piece and then locked  box again So he kept  several weeks and it was n  one for it was very large  ut behold the mice got  nto his box and nibbled  ome And the cake grew  ry and mouldy and at  ast was good for nothing  all So he was obliged  throw it away and it  rieved him to the very heart  and no body was sorry  him  Well there was anothe  little boy at the same schoo  whose name was Billy And one day his mamma sent him a cake because she love  him dearly and he loved he  dearly So when the cak  ame Billy said to his schoolfellows I have got a cake come let us go and eat it So they came about him like a parcel of bees and Billy took a slice of cake himself and then gave a piece to one and a piece to another and  piece to another till it was  almost gone Then Billy put the rest by and said I will eat it tomorrow So he went to play and the boys all played together very merrily But presently after an old blind Fiddler came into the court he had a long white beard and because he  was blind he had a little dog in a string to lead him So he came into the court and sat down upon a stone and said My pretty lads if you will I will play you a tune And they all left off their sport and came and stood round him And  Billy saw that while he played the tears ran down his cheeks And Billy said Old man why do you cry And the old man said Because I am very hungryI have nobody to give me any dinners or suppersI have nothing in the world but this  little dog and I cannot work If I could work I would Then Billy went without saying a word and fetched the rest of his cake which he had intended to have eaten another day and he said Here old man here is some cake for you The  old man said Where is it for I am blind I cannot see it So Billy put it into his hat And the Fiddler thanked him and Billy was more glad than if he had eaten ten cakes  Pray which do you love  best do you love Harry or Peter or Billy best  Little boy come to me Tell me how far from home have you been in your life I think I should like to go a great long way with you  and see what we could see for there are a great many places in the world besides home Bring your hat Goodbye Papa Farewell Billy and Harry and every body We are going a great way off And we shall go down the lane and through  the churchyard and by the corner house and over the stile till we have got quite into the fields How pretty the fields will look for it will be summer days again before we go And there will be yellow flowers and white flowers and grass  and trees and hedges and the grasshoppers will chirp chirp under our feet Do not try to catch them it will only hinder us and we have a great way to go  Pray what are those pretty creatures that look so meek and goodnatured and have  soft thick white wool upon their backs like a great coat and make a noise like the little baby when it cries Those are sheep and lambs And what are those creatures with horns that are bigger than the sheep Some of them are black and some  red they make a loud noise but they do not look as if they would hurt any body Those are cows that give milk Stroke them Poor cows Stand still and look back Now we cannot see papa's house at all and we can see only the top of the  church steeple Let us go a little farther Now look back Now we cannot see the church at all Farewell We are going a great way Shall we ever come back again Yes we shall come back again but we must  go on now Come make haste  What is that tall thing that has four great arms which move very fast I believe if I was near it they would strike me down It is a Windmill Those arms are the sails The wind  turns them round And what is a windmill for It is to grind corn You could have no bread if the corn were not ground Well but here is a river how shall we do to get over it Why do not you see how those ducks do they swim over  But I cannot swim Then you must learn to swim I believe it is too wide to jump over O here is a Bridge Somebody has made a bridge for us quite over the river That somebody was very good for I do not know what we should have  done without it and he was very clever too I wonder now he made it I am sure I could not make such a bridge  Well we must go on on on and we shall see more  ivers and more fields and owns bigger than our town  a great deallarge towns and fine churches streets and peoplemore than there is at the fair And we shall have a great many high hills to climb I believe I must get somebody to carry the little boy up those high hills And sometimes we shall  through dusty sandy roads and sometimes through green  anes where we shall hear the birds sing Sometimes we shall go over wide commons where we shall see no  rees nor any house and  arge heaths where there  hardly any grassonly  some purple flowers and a few black nosed little sheep Ha did you see that pretty brown creature that ran across the path Here is another and look there is another there are a great many They are Rabbits They live here and make themselves houses  in the ground This is a rabbitwarren  Now we are come amongst a great many treesmore trees than there are in the orchard by a great many and taller trees There is oak and ash and elm This is a Wood What great  boughs the trees have like thick arms The sun cannot shine amongst the trees they are so thick Look there is a squirrel jumping from one tree to another He is very nimble What a pretty tail he has  Well when we have gone on a great many days through a great many fields and towns we shall come to a great deep water bigger a great many times than the  iver for you can see over  he river you knowyou  an see fields on the other  side but this is so large and so wide you can see nothing but water water as far as ever you can carry your eyes And it is not smooth like the river it is all rough like the great pot in the kitchen when it is boiling And it is so deep  it would drown you if you were as tall as two church steeples I wonder what they call this great water there is an old old fisherman sitting upon a stone drying himself for he is very wet I think we will ask him Pray fisherman  what is this great water It is the Sea did you never hear of the sea What is this great water the same sea that is in our map at home Yes it is Well this is very strange we are come to the sea that is in our map But it is very little in the  map I can lay my finger over it Yes it is little in the map because every thing is little in the map the towns are little and the rivers are little  Pray Fisherman is there any thing on the other side of this sea Yes fields  and towns and people Will you go and see them I should like to go very well but how must we do to get over for there is no bridge here Do not you see those great wooden boxes that swim upon the water They are bigger than all papa's  house There are tall poles in the middle as high as a tree Those are masts See now they are spreading the sails Those white sheets are the sails They are like wings These wooden boxes are like houses with wings Yes and I will  tell you what little boy they are made on purpose to go over the sea and the wind blows them along faster than a horse can trot What do they call them They call them Ships You have seen a ship in a picture Shall we get in What have  those men in the ship got on they have jackets and trowsers on and checked shirts They are sailors I think we will make you a sailor and then instead of breeches you must have a pair of trowsers Do you see that sailor how he climbs up the  ropes He is very nimble He runs up like a monkey Now he is at the top of the mast How little he looks But we must get in Come make haste they will not stay for us What are you doing picking up shells We must get into a boat  first because the ship is not near enough Now we are in  Now we are upon the great sea Blow blow wind Sail away ship There are little rooms in the ship Those little rooms are called cabins Let us walk about  and look at the ship Why you cannot walk steady I am afraid you are tipsy Because the ship rolls about But the sailors can walk steady The sea is not like the river it is greenish Well here is water enough if we should be thirsty Yes here  is water enough but you would not like to drink it It is salt and bitter You could not drink it How fast we go Now the fields are a great way off Now we cannot see any green fields at all nor any houses nor any thing but the great  deep water It is water all round as far as ever we can see Yes and sky we can see the sky too All sky over our heads and all water every where round us Do not be afraid little boy Blow blow wind sail away ship I see some  things in the sea at a great distance Those are more ships and boats How very small they are they look like nut shells in a great pond O Now we are coming to the green fields and towns on the other side of the sea I can see them a  little Now I can see them very plain And here is a little piece of green land with the water running all round it That is an island A piece of land with water all round it is an island But we are not going there we are going to the great land  Now we are at the land Get out of the ship Pray what country is this This is France France why France is in the map too And pray what is the name of that country we came from where we live and where papa lives It is  England And the deep sea is between France and England Yes you know it is so in the map  O France is a pretty place It is warmer than our country and here are pretty flowers and fine fruit and large grapes I never saw  such large grapes in all my life And the vines grow in the fields they do not grow against walls as our vines do And there are a great many people men and women and little boys and girls singing and dancing about and so merry nothing  can be like it I think we will live here and send for papa and Arthur Let us go and talk with those people Here you little girl pray give us some  your nice fruit  Serviteur Monsieur  What do you say little girl I do not understand  you I cannot help that Here is an old man cutting the vines we will speak to him Pray old man will you give us some of your fruit We are come a great way to see you  Serviteur Monsieur  What do you say We do not know  what  Serviteur Monsieur  is It is French But we do not understand French I cannot help that you must go home and learn And why do you speak French Because this is France Did not you know that every body speaks French in  France Ha ha ha He he he Ho ho ho ho Here is a foolish little boy come a great way over the sea and does not know that every body speaks French in France Ha ha ha He he he Ho ho ho Here is a foolish little boy  come a great way over the sea and does not know that every body speaks French in France Ha ha ha He he he Ho ho hoWhat shall we do little boy every body laughs at us and

away ship Now we are  ot back again Pray papa  ach the little boy French  before he goes a great way abroad again  You know how many legs a Horse has Yes a Horse has four legs And do you know what an animal is called that has four  legs It is called a Quadruped The Cow is a quadruped and the Dog and the Lion and all the beasts But birds are not quadrupeds for they have only two legs Some quadrupeds have hoofs The Horse has hoofs so has the  Ass and the Cow but the Dog has no hoofs the Dog has toes with claws so the Dog is not hoofed but digitated and the Cat and the Squirrel and a great many more are digitated The hoof of the horse is whole it is all in one piece  but the hoof of the Cow is parted as if it were two hoofs That is being clovenfooted the hoof is cloven The Cow and the Sheep and the Hog and the Stag are all clovenfooted but the Horse and the Ass have whole hoofs  The Ass says I am a Quadruped I am a very patient good creature I have hoofs and very long ears I bray very loud The horse is frightened when I bray and starts back but  I am very meek and never hurt any thing My young ones are colts I suckle them I am not so big as a horse and I cannot gallop fast but I work very hard Sometimes I carry little boys on my back two or three at a time and they whip  me and prick my sides to make me go faster I carry greens to market and turnips and potatoes and sometimes I carry a great load of pans and mugs and pots with which my back is almost broke and I get nothing for my dinner but  a few prickly thistles and some coarse grass from off the common and I have no stable to go into as a Horse has I always lie out in the fields in the snow and in the rain but I am very contented I give milk as well as the Cow and my milk is  very good for people that are sick to make them well again  Ha what is there amongst the furze I can see only its eyes It has very large full eyes It is a Hare It  is in its form squatting down amongst the bushes to hide itself for it is very fearful The Hare is very innocent and gentle Its colour is brown but in countries which are very cold it turns white as snow It has a short bushy tail its lip  is parted and very hairy and it always moves its lips Its hind egs are very long that it may run the better The Hare feeds upon herbs and roots and the bark of young trees and green corn and sometimes it will creep through the hedge and steal  into the gardens to eat pinks and a little parsley and it loves to play and skip about by moonlight and to bite the tender blades of grass when the dew is upon them but in the daytime it sleeps in its form It sleeps with its eyes open  because it is very fearful and timid and when it hears the least noise it starts and pricks up its large ears And  the huntsman sounds his horn and the poor harmless Hare hears the Dogs coming then it it runs away very swiftly straight forward stretching  its legs and leaves them all behind But the Dogs pursue her and she grows tired and cannot run so fast as at first Then she doubles and turns and runs back to her form that the hounds may not find her but they run with their  noses to the ground smelling till they have found her out So when she has run five or six miles at last she stops and pants for breath and can run no further Then the hounds come up and tear her and kill her Then when she  is dead her little limbs which moved so fast grow quite stiff and cannot move at all A snail could go faster than a hare when it is dead and its poor little heart that beat so quick is quite still and cold and its round full eyes are dull and dim  and its soft furry skin is all torn and bloody It is good for nothing now but to be roasted  All birds that swim in the water are webfooted Their toes are joined together by  a skin that grows between them that is being webfooted and it helps the birds to swim well for then their feet are like the fins of a fish  The Swan says My name  Swan I am a large bird  arger than a goose My bill  is red but the sides of it are black and I have black about my eyes My legs are dusky but my feet are red and I am webfooted My body is all white  white as snow and very beautiful I have a very long neck I live in rivers and  lakes I eat plants that grow in the water and seeds and little infects and snails I do not look pretty when I walk upon the ground for I cannot walk well at all but when I am in the water swimming smoothly along arching my long neck and  dipping my white breast with which I make way through the water I am the most graceful of all birds I build my nest in a little island amongst the reeds and rushes I make it of sticks and long grass it is very large and high Then I lay  my eggs which are white and very large larger a great deal than a goose's egg and I sit upon them for two months then they are hatched and my young ones come out They are called cygnets They are not white at first but greyish  If any body was to come near me when I am in my nest sitting upon my eggs or when I have my young ones I should fly at him for I am very fierce to defend my young and if you were to come to take them away I should beat  you down with my strong pinion and perhaps break your arm I live a very great while  The Sun says My name is Sun I am very bright I rise in the east and when  I rise then it is day I look in at your window with my bright golden eye and tell you when it is time to get up and I say Sluggard get up I do not shine for you to lie in your bed and sleep but I shine for you to get up and work and  read and walk about I am a great traveller I travel all over the sky I never stop and I never am tired I have a crown upon my head of bright beams and I send forth my rays every where I shine upon the trees and the houses and upon the  water and every thing looks sparkling and beautiful when I shine upon it I give you light and I give you heat for I make it warm I make the fruit ripen and the corn ripen If I did not shine upon the fields and upon the gardens nothing would  grow I am up very high in the sky higher than all trees higher than the clouds higher than every thing I am a great way off If I were to come nearer you I should scorch you to death and I should burn up the grass for I am all made of  hot glowing fire I have been in the sky a great while Four years ago there was no Charles Charles was not alive then but there was a Sun I was in the sky before papa and mamma were alive a great many long years ago and I am not  grown old yet Sometimes I take off my crown of bright rays and wrap up my head in thin silver clouds and then you may look at me but when there are no clouds and I shine with all my brightness at noonday you cannot look at me for I  should dazzle your eyes and make you blind Only the Eagle can look at me then the Eagle with his strong piercing eye can gaze upon me always And when I am going to rise in the morning and make it day the Lark flies up in the sky  to meet me and sings sweetly in the air and the Cock crows loud to tell every body that I am coming but the Owl and the Bat fly away when they see me and hide themselves in old walls and hollow trees and the Lion and the Tiger go into their  dens and caves where they sleep all the day I shine in all places I shine in England and in France and in Spain and all over the earth I am the most beautiful and glorious creature that can be seen in the whole world  The Moon says My name is Moon I shine to give you light in the night when the sun is set I am very beautiful and white like silver You may look at me always for I am not so  bright as to dazzle your eyes and I never scorch you I am mild and gentle I let even the little glowworms shine which are quite dark by day The stars shine all round me but I am larger and brighter than the stars and I look like a large pearl  amongst a great many small sparkling diamonds When you are asleep I shine through your curtains with my gentle beams and I say Sleep on poor little tired boy I will not disturb you The nightingale sings to me who sings better than all the  birds of the air She sits upon a thorn and sings melodiously all night long while the dew lies upon the grass and every thing is still and silent all around  THE END
