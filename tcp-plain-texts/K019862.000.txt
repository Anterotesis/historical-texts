Arbos  Nunc frondent Silvae nunc  formosissimus Annus  VIRG  The SECOND EDITION  BUCHANANUS  LONDON  Printed for A MILLAR at  Buchanan  's Head over against St  Clement  's Church in the  Strand  MDCCXXXI  The ARGUMENT  The Subject propos'd Inscribed to Lady  HERTFORD  This Season is described as it affects the various parts of Nature ascending from the lower to the higher and mixed with Digressions arising from the subject Its influence on inanimate Matter on Vegetables on brute Animals and last on Man concluding with a Dissuasive from the wild and irregular passion of love opposed to that of a purer and more reasonable kind  SPRING  _COME gentle SPRING AETHEREAL MILDNESS come  And from the bosom of yon dropping cloud  While music wakes around veil'd in a shower  Of shadowing roses on our plains descend  O HERTFORD fitted or to shine in courts  With unaffected grace or walk the plain  With INNOCENCE and MEDITATION join'd  In soft assemblage listen to my song  That thy own Season paints when NATURE all  Is blooming and benevolent like thee  AND see where surly WINTER passes off  Far to the north and calls his ruffian blasts  His blasts obey and quit the howling hill  The shatter'd forest and the ravag'd vale  While softer gales succeed at whose kind touch  Dissolving snows in livid torrents lost  The mountains lift their green heads to the sky  As yet the trembling year is unconfirm'd  And WINTER oft at eve resumes the breeze  Chills the pale morn and bids his driving sleets  Deform the day delightless so that scarce  The Bittern knows the time with bill ingulpht  To shake the sounding marsh or from the shore  The Plovers theirs to scatter o'er the heath  And sing their wild notes to the listening waste  AT last from ARIES rolls the bounteous sun  And the bright BULL receives him Then no more  Th' expansive atmosphere is cramp'd with cold  But full of life and vivifying soul  Lifts the light clouds sublime and spreads them thin  Fleecy and white o'er allsurrounding heaven  FORTH fly the tepid airs and unconfin'd  Unbinding earth the moving softness strays  Joyous th' impatient husbandman perceives  Relenting nature and his lusty steers  Drives from their stalls to where the wellus'd plow  Lies in the furrow loosen'd from the frost  There unrefusing to the harness'd yoke  They lend their shoulder and begin their toil  Chear'd by the simple song and soaring lark  Meanwhile incumbent o'er the shining share  The master leans removes th' obstructing clay  Winds the whole work and sidelong lays the glebe  WHITE thro' the neighbouring fields the sower stalks  With measur'd step and liberal throws the grain  Into the faithful bosom of the Ground  The harrow follows harsh and shuts the scene  BE gracious HEAVEN for now laborious man  Has done his due Ye fostering breezes blow  Ye softening dews ye tender showers descend  And temper all thou worldreviving sun  Into the perfect year Nor ye who live  In luxury and ease in pomp and pride  Think these lost themes unworthy of your ear  'Twas such as these the rural MARO sung  To the full ROMAN court in all its height  Of elegance and taste The sacred plow  Employ'd the kings and fathers of mankind  In antient times And some with whom compar'd  You're but the beings of a summer's day  Have held the scale of justice shook the lance  Of mighty war then with descending hand  Unus'd to little delicacies seiz'd  The plow and greatly independant liv'd  YE generous BRITONS cultivate the plow  And o'er your hills and long withdrawing vales  Let AUTUMN spread his treasures to the sun  Luxuriant and unbounded As the sea  Far thro' his azure turbulent extent  Your empire owns and from a thousand shores  Wafts all the pomp of life into your ports  So with superior boon may your rich soil  Exuberant nature's better blessings pour  O'er every land the naked nations cloath  And be th' exhaustless granary of a world  NOR thro' the lenient air alone this change  Delicious breathes the penetrative sun  His force deep darting to the dark retreat  Of vegetation sets the steaming power  At large to wander o'er the verdant earth  In various hues but chiefly thee gay GREEN  Thou smiling NATURE's universal robe  United light and shade where the sight dwells  With growing strength and evernew delight  FROM the moist meadow to the brownbrow'd hill  Led by the breeze the vivid verdure runs  And swells and deepens to the cherish'd eye  The hawthorn whitens and the juicy groves  Put forth their buds unfolding by degrees  Till the whole leafy forest stands display'd  In full luxuriance to the sighing gales  While the deer rustle thro' the twining brake  And the birds sing conceal'd At once array'd  In all the colours of the flushing year  By NATURE's swift and secretworking hand  The garden glows and fills the liberal air  With lavish fragrance while the promis'd fruit  Lies yet a little embryo unperceiv'd  Within its crimson folds Now from the town  Buried in smoke and sleep and noisom damps  Oft let me wander o'er the dewy fields  Where freshness breathes and dash the lucid drops  From the bent bush as thro' the fuming maze  Of sweetbriar hedges I pursue my walk  Or taste the smell of dairy or ascend  Some eminence AUGUSTA in thy plains  And see the country far diffus'd around  One boundless blush one white empurpled shower  Of mingled blossoms where the raptur'd eye  Travels from joy to joy and hid beneath  The fair profusion yellow AUTUMN spies  IF brush'd from RUSSIAN wilds a cutting gale  Rise not and scatter from his foggy wings  The bitter mildew or dryblowing breathe  Untimely frost before whose baleful blast  The fullblown SPRING thro' all her foliage shrinks  Into a smutty widedejected waste  For oft engender'd by the hazy north  Myriads on Myriads insect armies waft  Keen in the poison'd breeze and wasteful eat  Thro' buds and bark into the blacken'd Core  Their eager way A feeble race scarce seen  Save by the prying eye yet famine waits  On their corrosive course and kills the year  Sometimes o'er cities as they steer their flight  Where rising vapour melts their wings away  Gaz'd by th' astonish'd crowd the horrid shower  Descends And hence the skilful farmer chaff  And blazing straw before his orchard burns  Till all involv'd in smoke the latent foe  From every cranny suffocated falls  Or onions steaming hot beneath his trees  Exposes fatal to the frosty tribe  Nor from their friendly task the busy bill  Of little trooping birds instinctive scares  THESE are not idle philosophick dreams  Full NATURE swarms with life Th' unfaithful fen  In putrid steams emits the livid cloud  Of Pestilence Thro' subterranean Cells  Where searching sunbeams never found a way  Earth animated heaves The flowery leaf  Wants not its soft inhabitants The stone  Hard as it is in every winding pore  Holds multitudes But chief the forestboughs  Which dance unnumber'd to th' inspiring breeze  The downy orchard and the melting pulp  Of mellow fruit the nameless nations feed  Of evanescent Insects Where the pool  Stands mantled o'er with green invisible  Amid the floating verdure millions stray  Each liquid too whether of acid taste  Potent or mild with various forms abounds  Nor is the lucid stream nor the pure air  Tho' one transparent vacancy they seem  Devoid of theirs Even animals subsist  On animals in infinite descent  And all so fine adjusted that the loss  Of the least species would disturb the whole  Stranger than this th' inspective glass confirms  And to the curious gives th' amazing scenes  Of lessening life by WISDOM kindly hid  From eye and ear of man for if at once  The worlds in worlds enclos'd were push'd to light  Seen by his sharpen'd eye and by his ear  Intensely bended heard from the choice cate  The freshest viands and the brightest wines  He'd turn abhorrent and in dead of night  When silence sleeps o'er all be stun'd with noise  THE Northeast spends his rage and now shut up  Within his iron caves th' effusive South  Warms the wide air and o'er the void of heaven  Breaths the big clouds with vernal showers distent  At first a dusky wreath they seem to rise  Scarce staining aether but by fast degrees  In heaps on heaps the doubling vapour sails  Along the loaded sky and mingling thick  Sits on th' horizon round a settled gloom  Not such as wintry storms on mortals shed  Oppressing life but lovely gentle kind  And full of every hope and every joy  The wish of nature Gradual sinks the breeze  Into a perfect calm that not a breath  Is heard to quiver thro' the closing woods  Or rustling turn the manytwinkling leaves  Of aspin tall Th' uncurling floods diffus'd  In glassy breadth seem thro' delusive lapse  Forgetful of their course 'Tis silence all  And pleasing expectation Herds and flocks  Drop the dry sprig and muteimploring eye  The falling verdure Hush'd in short suspense  The plumy people streak their wings with oil  And wait th' approaching sign to strike at once  Into the general choir Even mountains vales  And forests seem expansive to demand  The promis'd sweetness Man superior walks  Amid the glad creation musing praise  And looking lively gratitude At last  The clouds consign their treasures to the fields  And softly shaking on the dimply pool  Prelusive drops let all their moisture flow  In large effusion o'er the freshen'd world  'Tis scarce to patter heard the stealing shower  By such as wander thro' the forestwalks  Beneath th' umbrageous multitude of leaves  But who can hold the shade while HEAVEN descends  In universal bounty shedding herbs  And fruits and flowers on NATURE's ample lap  Imagination fir'd prevents their growth  And while the verdant nutriment distills  Beholds the kindling country colour round  THUS all day long the fulldistended clouds  Indulge their genial stores and wellshower'd earth  Is deep enrich'd with vegetable life  Till in the westernsky the downward sun  Looks out illustrious from amidst the flush  Of broken clouds gayshifting to his beam  The rapid radiance instantaneous strikes  Th' illumin'd mountain thro' the forest streams  Shakes on the floods and in a yellow mist  Far smoaking o'er th' interminable plain  In twinkling myriads lights the dewy gems  Moist bright and green the landskip laughs around  Full swell the woods their every musick wakes  Mix'd in wild consort with the warbling brooks  Increas'd th'unnumber'd bleatings of the hills  The hollow lows responsive from the vales  Whence blending all the sweeten'd zephyr springs  Mean time refracted from yon eastern cloud  Bestriding earth the grand aethereal bow  Shoots up immense and every hue unfolds  In fair proportion running from the red  To where the violet fades into the sky  Here mighty NEWTON the dissolving clouds  Are as they scatter round thy numerous prism  Untwisting to the philosophic eye  The various twine of light by thee pursu'd  Thro' the white mingling maze Not so the swain  He wondering views the bright enchantment bend  Delightful o'er the radiant fields and runs  To catch the falling glory but amaz'd  Beholds th' amusive arch before him fly  Then vanish quite away Still night succeeds  A soften'd shade and saturated earth  Awaits the morning beam to give again  Transmuted soon by Nature's chymistry  The blooming blessings of the former day  THEN spring the living herbs profusely wild  O'er all the deepgreen earth beyond the power  Of BOTANIST to number up their tribes  Whether he steals along the lonely dale  In silent search or thro' the forest rank  With what the dull incurious weeds account  Bursts his blind way or climbs the mountain rock  Fir'd by the nodding verdure of its brow  With such a liberal hand has NATURE flung  Their seeds abroad blown them about in winds  Innumerous mix'd them with the nursing mold  The moistening current and prolific rain  BUT who their virtues can declare Who pierce  With vision pure into these secret stores  Of life and health and joy The food of man  While yet he liv'd in innocence and told  A length of golden years unflesh'd in blood  A stranger to the savage arts of life  Death rapine carnage surfeit and disease  The lord and not the tyrant of the world  THEN the glad morning wak'd the gladden'd race  Of uncorrupted men nor blush'd to see  The sluggard sleep beneath her sacred beam  For their light slumbers gently fum'd away  And up they rose as vigorous as the sun  Or to the culture of the willing glebe  Or to the chearful tendance of the flock  Mean time the song went round and dance and sport  Wisdom and friendly talk successive stole  Their hours away While in the rosy vale  Love breath'd his infant sighs from anguish free  Replete with bliss and only wept for joy  Nor yet injurious act nor surly deed  Was known among these happy sons of heaven  For reason and benevolence were law  Harmonious nature too look'd smiling on  Clean shone the skies cool'd with eternal gales  And balmy spirit all The youthful sun  Shot his best rays and still the gracious clouds  Drop'd fatness down as o'er the swelling mead  The herds and flocks commixing play'd secure  Which when emergent from the gloomy wood  The glaring lion saw his horrid heart  Was meeken'd and he join'd his sullen joy  For musick held the whole in perfect peace  Soft sigh'd the flute the tender voice was heard  Warbling the joyous heart the woodlands round  Apply'd their quire and winds and waters flow'd  In consonance Such were these prime of days  THIS to the POETS gave the golden age  When as they sung in elevated phrase  The sailorpine had not the nations yet  In commerce mix'd for every country teem'd  With every thing Spontaneous harvests wav'd  Still in a sea of yellow plenty round  The forest was the vineyard where untaught  To climb unprun'd and wild the juicy grape  Burst into floods of wine The knotted oak  Shook from his boughs the long transparent streams  Of honey creeping thro' the matted grass  Th' uncultivated thorn a ruddy shower  Of fruitage shed on such as sat below  In blooming ease and from brown labour free  Save what the copious gathering grateful gave  The Rivers foam'd with nectar or diffuse  Silent and soft the milky maze devolv'd  Nor had the spongy fullexpanded fleece  Yet drunk the TYRIAN dye The stately ram  Shone thro' the mead in native purple clad  Or milder saffron and the dancing lamb  The vivid crimson to the sun disclos'd  Nothing had power to hurt the savage soul  Yet untransfus'd into the tyger's heart  Burn'd not his bowels nor his gamesome paw  Drove on the fleecy partners of his play  While from the flowery brake the serpent roll'd  His fairer spires and play'd his pointless tongue  BUT now whate'er these gaudy fables meant  And the white minutes which they shadow'd out  Are found no more amid those iron times  Those dregs of life in which the human mind  Has lost that harmony ineffable  Which warms the soul of happiness and all  Is off the poise within the passions all  Have burst their bounds and reason half extinct  Or impotent or else approving sees  The foul disorder Anger storms at large  Without an equal cause and fell revenge  Supports the falling rage Close envy bites  With venom'd tooth while weak unmanly fear  Full of frail fancies loosens every power  Even love itself is bitterness of soul  A pleasing anguish pining at the heart  Hope sickens with extravagance and grief  Of life impatient into madness swells  Or in dead silence wastes the weeping hours  These and a thousand mix'd emotions more  From everchanging views of good and ill  Form'd infinitely various vex the mind  With endless storm Whence inlyrankling grows  The selfish thought a listless inconcern  Cold and averting from our neighbour's good  Then dark disgust and malice winding wiles  Sneaking deceit and coward villany  At last deeprooted hatred lewd reproach  Convulsive wrath and thoughtless fury quick  To deeds of vilest aim Even nature's self  Is deem'd vindictive to have chang'd her course  HENCE in old time they say a deluge came  When the disparting orb of earth that arch'd  Th' imprison'd deep around impetuous rush'd  With ruin inconceivable at once  Into the gulph and o'er the highest hills  Widedash'd the waves in undulation vast  'Till from the centre to the streaming clouds  A shoreless ocean tumbled round the globe  THE SEASONS since as hoar TRADITION tells  Have kept their constant chase the WINTER keen  Pour'd out his waste of snows and SUMMER shot  His pestilential heats great SPRING before  Green'd all the year and fruits and blossoms blush'd  In social sweetness on the selfsame bough  Clear was the temperate air an even calm  Perpetual reign'd save what the zephyrs bland  Breath'd o'er the blue expanse for then nor storms  Were taught to blow nor hurricanes to rage  Sound slept the waters no sulphureous glooms  Swell'd in the sky and sent the lightning forth  While sickly damps and cold autumnal fogs  Sat not pernicious on the springs of life  But now from clear to cloudy moist to dry  And hot to cold in restless change revolv'd  Our drooping days are dwindled down to nought  The fleeting shadow of a winter's sun  AND yet the wholesome herb neglected dies  In lone obscurity unpriz'd for food  Altho' the pure exhilerating soul  Of nutriment and health salubrious breathes  By HEAVEN infus'd along its secret tubes  For with hot ravine fir'd ensanguin'd man  Is now become the lion of the plain  And worse The wolf who from the nightly fold  Fiercedrags the bleating prey ne'er drunk her milk  Nor wore her warming fleece nor has the steer  At whose strong chest the deadly tyger hangs  E'er plow'd for him They too are temper'd high  With hunger stung and wild necessity  Nor lodges pity in their shaggy breasts  But MAN whom NATURE form'd of milder clay  With every kind emotion in his heart  And taught alone to weep while from her lap  She pours ten thousand delicacies herbs  And fruits as numerous as the drops of rain  And beams that gave them birth shall he fair form  Who wears sweet smiles and looks erect on heaven  E'er stoop to mingle with the prowling herd  And dip his tongue in blood The beast of prey  'Tis true deserves the fate in which he deals  Him from the thicket let the hardy youth  Provoke and foaming thro' the awakened woods  With every nerve pursue But you ye flocks  What have ye done Ye peaceful people what  To merit death You who have given us milk  In luscious streams and lent us your own coat  Against the winter's cold Whose usefulness  In living only lies And the plain ox  That harmless honest guileless animal  In what has he offended He whose toil  Patient and everready clothes the land  With all the pomp of harvest shall he bleed  And wrestling groan beneath the cruel hands  Even of the clowns he feeds And that perhaps  To swell the riot of the gathering feast  Won by his labour Thus the feeling heart  Would tenderly suggest but 'tis enough  In this late age adventurous to have touch'd  Light on the numbers of the SAMIAN sage  High HEAVEN beside forbids the daring strain  Whose wisest will has fix'd us in a state  That must not yet to pure perfection rise  BUT yonder breathing prospect bids the muse  Throw all her beauty forth that daubing all  Will be to what I gaze for who can paint  Like NATURE Can IMAGINATION boast  Amid his gay creation hues like hers  And can he mix them with that matchless skill  And lay them on so delicately fine  And lose them in each other as appears  In every bud that blows If fancy then  Unequal fails beneath the lovely task  Ah what shall language do Ah where find words  Ting'd with so many colours And whose power  To life approaching may perfume my lays  With that fine oil these aromatic gales  Which inexhaustive flow continual round  YET tho' successless will the toil delight  Come then ye virgins and ye youths whose hearts  Have felt the raptures of refining love  Oh come and while the rosyfooted MAY  Steals blushing on together let us walk  The morning dews and gather in their prime  Freshblooming flowers to deck the braided hair  And the white bosom that improves their sweets  SEE where the winding vale her lavish stores  Irriguous spreads See how the lilly drinks  The latent rill scarce oozing thro' the grass  Of growth luxuriant or the humid bank  Profusely climbs Turgent in every pore  The gummy moisture shines new lustre lends  And feeds the spirit that diffusive round  Refreshes ail the dale Long let us walk  Where the breeze blows from yon extended field  Of blossom'd beans ARABIA cannot boast  A fuller gale of joy than liberal thence  Breathes thro' the sense and takes the ravish'd soul  Nor is the meadow worthless of our foot  Full of fresh verdure and unnumber'd flowers  The negligence of NATURE wide and wild  Where undisguis'd by mimic ART she spreads  Unbounded beauty to the boundless eye  'Tis here that their delicious task the bees  In swarming millions tend Around athwart  This way and that the busy nations fly  Cling to the bud and with inserted tube  Its soul its sweetness and its manna suck  The little chymist thus allmoving HEAVEN  Has taught and oft of bolder wing he dares  The purple heath or where the wildthyme grows  And yellow loads him with the luscious spoil  AT length the finish'd garden to the view  Its vistas opens and its alleys green  Snatch'd thro' the verdant maze the hurried eye  Distracted wanders now the bowery walk  Of covert close where scarce a speck of day  Falls on the lengthen'd gloom protracted darts  Now meets the bending sky the river now  Dimpling along the breezyruffled lake  The forest running round the rising spire  Th' aethereal mountain and the distant main  But why so far excursive when at hand  Along the blushing borders dewybright  And in yon mingled wilderness of flowers  Fairhanded SPRING unbosoms every grace  Throws out the snowdrop and the crocus first  The daily primrose violet darkly blue  Dewbending cowslips and of nameless dyes  Anemonies auriculas a tribe  Peculiar powder'd with a shining sand  Renunculas and iris manyhued  Then comes the tuliprace where beauty plays  Her gayest freaks from family diffus'd  To family as flies the fatherdust  The varied colours run and while they BREAK  On the charm'd FLORIST's eye he curious stands  And newflush'd glories all ecstatic marks  Nor hyacinths are wanting nor junquils  Of potent fragrance nor narcissus white  Nor stripe'd carnations nor enamell'd pinks  ower'd from every bush the damaskrose  Infinite numbers delicacies smells  With hues on hues expression cannot paint  The breath of NATURE and her endless bloom  HAIL MIGHTY BEING UNIVERSAL SOUL  Of heaven and earth ESSENTIAL PRESENCE hail  To THEE I bend the knee to THEE my thoughts  Continual climb who with a masterhand  Hast the great whole into perfection touch'd  By THEE the various vegetative tribes  Wrapt in a filmy net and clad with leaves  Draw the live aether and imbibe the dew  By THEE dispos'd into congenial soils  Stands each attractive plant and sucks and swells  The juicy tide a twining mass of tubes  At THY command the vernal sun awakes  The torpid sap detruded to the root  By wintry winds that now in fluent dance  And lively fermentation mounting spreads  All this innumerouscolour'd scene of things  ASCENDING from the vegetable world  To higher life with equal wing ascend  My panting Muse and hark how loud the woods  Invite you forth in all your gayest trim  Lend me your song ye nightingales oh pour  The mazyrunning soul of melody  Into my varied verse while I deduce  From the first note the hollow cuckoo sings  The symphony of SPRING and touch a theme  Unknown to fame THE PASSION OF THE GROVES  JUST as the spirit of love is sent abroad  Warm thro' the vital air and on their hearts  Harmonious seizes the gay troops begin  In gallant thought to plume the painted wing  And try again the longforgotten strain  At first faintwarbled But no sooner grows  The soft infusion prevalent and wide  Than all alive at once their joy o'erflows  In musick unconfin'd Upsprings the lark  Shrillvoiced and loud the messenger of morn  E'er yet the shadows fly he mounted sings  Amid the dawning clouds and from their haunts  Calls up the tuneful nations Every copse  Thickwove and tree irregular and bush  Bending with dewy moisture o'er the heads  Of the coy quiristers that lodge within  Are prodigal of harmony The thrush  And woodlark o'er the kindcontending throng  Superior heard run thro' the sweetest length  Of notes when listening PHILOMELA deigns  To let them joy and purposes in thought  Elate to make her night excel their day  The blackbird whistles from the thorny brake  The mellow bullfinch answers from the grove  Nor are the linnets o'er the flowering furze  Pour'd out profusely silent Join'd to these  Thousands beside thick as the covering leaves  They warble under or the nitid hues  That speck them o'er their modulations mix  Mellifluous The jay the rook the daw  And each harsh pipe discordant heard alone  Here aid the consort while the stockdove breathes  A melancholy murmur thro' the whole  'TIS love creates their gaiety and all  This waste of musick is the voice of love  Which even to birds and beasts the tender arts  Of pleasing teaches Hence the glossy kind  Try every winning way inventive love  Can dictate and in fluttering courtship pour  Their little souls before her Wide around  Respectful first in airy rings they rove  Endeavouring by a thousand tricks to catch  The cunning conscious halfaverted glance  Of their regardless charmer Should she seem  Softening the least approvance to bestow  Their colours burnish and by hope inspir'd  They brisk advance then on a sudden struck  Retire disorder'd then again approach  And throwing out the last efforts of love  In fond rotation spread the spotted wing  And shiver every feather with desire  CONNUBIAL leagues agreed to the deep woods  They haste away each as their fancy leads  Pleasure or food or secret safety prompts  That NATURE's great command may be obey'd  Nor all the sweet sensations they perceive  Indulg'd in vain Some to the hollyhedge  Nestling repair and to the thicket some  Some to the rude protection of the thorn  Resolve to trust their young The clested tree  Offers its kind concealment to a few  Their food its insects and its moss their nests  Others apart far in the grassy dale  Their humble texture weave But most delight  In unfrequented glooms or shaggy banks  Steep and divided by a babbling brook  Whose murmurs sooth them all the livelong day  When for a season fix'd Among the roots  Of hazel pendant o'er the plaintive stream  They frame the first foundation of their domes  Dry sprigs of trees in artful manner laid  And bound with clay together Now 'tis nought  But hurry hurry thro' the busy air  Beat by unnumber'd wings The swallow sweeps  The slimy pool to build his hanging house  Ingeniously intent Oft from the back  Of herds and flocks a thousand tugging bills  Pluck hair and wool and oft when unobserv'd  Steal from the barn the straw till soft and warm  Clean and compleat their habitation grows  As thus the patient dam assiduous sits  Not to be tempted from her tender task  Or by sharp hunger or by smooth delight  Tho' the whole loosen'd Spring around her blows  Her sympathizing lover takes his stand  High on th'opponent bank and ceaseless sings  The tedious time away or else supplies  Her place a moment while she sudden flits  To pick the scanty meal Th' appointed time  With pious toil fulfill'd the callow young  Warm'd and expanded into perfect life  Their brittle bondage break and come to light  A helpless family demanding food  With constant clamour Oh what passions then  What melting sentiments of kindly care  Seize the new parents' hearts Away they fly  Affectionate and undesiring bear  The most delicious morsel to their young  Which equally distributed again  The search begins So pitiful and poor  A gentle pair on providential HEAVEN  Cast as they weeping eye their clamant train  Check their own appetites and give them all  NOR is the courage of the fearful kind  Nor is their cunning less should some rude foot  Their woody haunts molest stealthy aside  Into the centre of a neighbouring bush  They drop and whirring thence alarm'd deceive  The rambling schoolboy Hence around the head  Of traveller the whitewing'd plover wheels  Her sounding flight and then directly on  In long excursion skims the level lawn  To tempt you from her nest The wildduck hence  O'er the rough moss and o'er the trackless waste  The heathhen flutters as if hurt to lead  The hot pursuing spaniel far astray  BE not the muse asham'd here to bemoan  Her brothers of the grove by tyrant man  Inhuman caught and in the narrow cage  From liberty confin'd and boundless air  Dull are the pretty slaves their plumage dull  Ragged and all its brightning lustre lost  Nor is that luscious wildness in their notes  That warbles from the beech Oh then desist  Ye friends of harmony this barbarous art  Forbear if innocence and musick can  Win on your hearts or piety persuade  BUT let not chief the nightingale lament  Her ruin'd care too delicately fram'd  To brook the harsh confinement of the cage  Oft when returning with her loaded bill  Th' astonish'd mother finds a vacant nest  By the hard hand of unrelenting clowns  Robb'd to the ground the vain provision falls  Her pinions ruffle and lowdrooping scarce  Can bear the mourner to the poplar shade  Where all abandon'd to despair she sings  Her sorrows thro' the night and on the bough  Sadsitting still at every dying fall  Takes up again her lamentable strain  Of winding woe till wide around the woods  Sigh with her song and with her wail resound  AND now the feather'd youth their former bounds  Ardent disdain and weighing oft their wings  Demand the free possession of the sky  But this glad office more and then dissolves  Parental love at once for needless grown  Unlavish WISDOM never works in vain  'Tis on some evening sunny grateful mild  When nought but balm is breathing thro' the woods  With yellow lustre bright that the new tribes  Visit the spacious heavens and look abroad  On NATURE's common far as they can see  Or wing their range and pasture O'er the boughs  Dancing about still at the giddy verge  Their resolution fails their pinions still  In loose libration stretch'd the void abrupt  Trembling refuse till down before them fly  The parentguides and chide exhort command  Or push them off The surging air receives  The plumy burden and their selftaught wings  Winnow the waving element On ground  Alighted bolder up again they lead  Farther and farther on the lengthning flight  Till vanish'd every fear and every power  Rouz'd into life and action in the void  Th' exoner'd parents see their soaring race  And once rejoicing never know them more  HIGH from the summit of a craggy cliff  Hung o'er the green sea grudging at its base  The royal eagle draws his young resolv'd  To try them at the sun Strongpounc'd and bright  As burnish'd day they up the blue sky wind  Leaving dull sight below and with fix'd gaze  Drink in their native noon the fatherking  Claps his glad pinions and approves the birth  AND should I wander to the rural fear  Whose aged oaks and venerable gloom  Invite the noisy rook with pleasure there  I might the various polity survey  Of the mixt houshold kind The careful hen  Calls all her chirping family around  Fed and defended by the fearless cock  Whose breast with ardour flames as on he walks  Graceful and crows defiance In the pond  The finelychecker'd duck before her train  Rows garrulous The statelysailing swan  Gives out his snowy plumage to the gale  And arching proud his neck with oary feet  Bears forward fierce and beats you from the bank  Protective of his young The turkey nigh  Loudthreatning reddens while the peacock spreads  His everycolour'd glory to the sun  And swims in floating majesty along  O'er the whole homely scene the cooing dove  Flies thick in amorous chace and wanton rolls  The glancing eye and turns the changeful neck  WHILE thus the gentle tenants of the shade  Indulge their purer loves the rougher world  Of brutes below rush furious into flame  And fierce desire Thro' all his lusty veins  The bull deepscorch'd receives the raging fire  Of pasture sick and negligent of food  Scarce seen he wades among the yellow broom  While o'er his brawny back the rambling sprays  Luxuriant shoot or thro' the mazy wood  Dejected wanders nor th' inticing bud  Crops tho' it presses on his careless sense  For wrapt in mad imagination he  Roars for the fight and idly butting feigns  A rival gor'd in every knotty trunk  Such should he meet the bellowing war begins  Their eyes flash fury to the hollow'd earth  Whence the sand flies they mutter bloody deeds  And groaning vast th' impetuous battle mix  While the fair heifer redolent in view  Stands kindling up their rage The trembling steed  With this hot impulse seiz'd in every nerve  Nor hears the rein nor heeds the sounding whip  Blows are not felt but tossing high his head  And by the wellknown joy to distant plains  Attracted strong all wild he bursts away  O'er rocks and woods and craggy mountains flies  And neighing on the aerial summit takes  Th' informing gale then steepdescending cleaves  The headlong torrents foaming down the hills  Even where the madness of the straiten'd streams  Turns in black eddies round Such is the force  With which his frantick heart and sinews swell  NOR undelighted by the boundless SPRING  Are the broad monsters of the boiling deep  From the deep ooze and gelid cavern rous'd  They flounce and tumble in unwieldy joy  Dire were the strain and dissonant to sing  The cruel raptures of the savage kind  How the red lioness her whelps forgot  Amid the thoughtless fury of her heart  The lank rapacious wolf th' unshapely bear  The spotted tyger fellest of the fell  And all the terrors of the LIBYAN swain  By this new flame their native wrath sublim'd  Roam the resounding waste in fiercer bands  And growl their horrid loves But this the theme  I sing transported to the BRITISH fair  Forbids and leads me to the mountainbrow  Where sits the shepherd on the grassy turf  Inhaling healthful the descending sun  Around him feeds his manybleating flock  Of various cadence and his sportive lambs  This way and that convolv'd in friskful glee  Their little frolicks play And now the race  Invites them forth when swift the signal given  They start away and sweep the massy mound  That runs around the hill the rampart once  Of iron war in ancient barbarous times  When disunited BRITAIN ever bled  Lost in eternal broil e'er yet she grew  To this deeplaid indissoluble state  Where WEALTH and COMMERCE lift their golden head  And o'er our Labours LIBERTY and LAW  Illustrious watch the wonder of a world  WHAT is this MIGHTY BREATH ye curious say  Which in a language rather felt than heard  Instructs the fowls of heaven and thro' their breasts  These arts of love diffuses What but GOD  Inspiring GOD who boundless spirit all  And unremitted energy pervades  Adjusts sustains and agitates the whole  He ceaseless works alone and yet alone  Seems not to work with such perfection fram'd  Is this complex amazing scheme of things  But tho' conceal'd to every purer eye  Th' informing author in his work appears  His grandeur in the heavens the sun and moon  Whether that fires the day or falling this  Pours out a lucid softness o'er the night  Are but a beam from him The glittering stars  By the deep ear of meditation heard  Still in their midnight watches sing of him  He nods a calm The tempest blows his wrath  Roots up the forest and o'erturns the main  The thunder is his voice and the red flash  His speedy sword of justice At his touch  The mountains flame He takes the solid earth  And rocks the nations Nor in these alone  In every common instance GOD is seen  And to the man who casts his mental eye  Abroad unnotic'd wonders rise But chief  In thee boon SPRING and in thy softer scenes  The SMILING GOD appears while water earth  And air attest his bounty which instils  Into the brutes this temporary thought  And annual melts their undesigning hearts  Profusely thus in tenderness and joy  STILL let my song a nobler note assume  And sing th' infusive force of SPRING on man  When heaven and earth as if contending vie  To raise his being and serene his soul  Can he forbear to smile with NATURE Can  The stormy passions in his bosom rowl  While every gale is peace and every grove  Is melody Hence from the bounteous walks  Of flowing SPRING ye sordid sons of earth  Hard and unfeeling of another's woe  Or only lavish to yourselves away  But come ye generous breasts in whose wide thought  Of all his works CREATIVE BOUNTY most  Divinely burns and on your open front  And liberal eye sits from his dark retreat  Inviting modest want Nor only fair  And easy of approach your active search  Leaves no cold wintry corner unexplor'd  Like silentworking HEAVEN surprizing oft  The lonely heart with unexpected good  For you the roving spirit of the wind  Blows SPRING abroad for you the teaming clouds  Descend in buxom plenty o'er the world  And the sun spreads his genial blaze for you  Ye flower of human race In these green days  Sadpining sickness lifts her languid head  Life flows afresh and youngey'd health exalts  The whole creation round Contentment walks  The sunny glade and feels an inward bliss  Spring o'er his mind beyond the power of kings  To purchase Pure serenity apace  Induces thought and contemplation still  By small degrees the love of nature works  And warms the bosom till at last arriv'd  To rapture and enthusiastic heat  We feel the present DEITY and taste  The joy of GOD to see a happy world  'TIS HARMONY that worldattuning power  By which all beings are adjusted each  To all around impelling and impell'd  In endless circulation that inspires  This universal smile Thus the glad skies  The wide rejoycing earth the woods the streams  With every LIFE they hold down to the flower  That paints the lowly vale or insectwing  Wav'd o'er the shepherd's slumber touch the mind  To nature tun'd with a lightflying hand  Invisible quickurging thro' the nerves  The glittering spirits in a flood of day  HENCE from the virgin's check a fresher bloom  Shoots less and less the live carnation round  Her lips blush deeper sweets she breathes of youth  The shining moisture swells into her eyes  In brighter flow her wishing bosom heaves  With palpitations wild kind tumults seize  Her veins and all her yielding soul is love  From the keen gaze her lover turns away  Full of the dear ecstatic power and sick  With sighing languishment Ah then ye fair  Be greatly cautious of your sliding hearts  Dare not th' infectious sigh the pleading eye  In meek submission drest deject and low  But full of tempting guile Let not the tongue  Prompt to deceive with adulation smooth  Gain on your purpos'd wills Nor in the bower  Where woodbines flaunt and roses shed a couch  While evening draws her crimson curtains round  Trust your soft minutes with betraying man  AND let th' aspiring youth beware of love  Of the smooth glance beware for 'tis too late  When on his heart the torrent softness pours  Then wisdom prostrate lies and fading fame  Dissolves in air away while the fond soul  Is wrapt in dreams of ecstacy and bliss  Still paints th' illusive form the kindling grace  Th' inticing smile the modestseeming eye  Beneath whose beauteous beams belying heaven  Lurk searchless cunning cruelty and death  And still falsewarbling in his cheated ear  Her syren voice enchanting draws him on  To guileful shores and meads of fatal joy  EVEN present in the very lap of love  Inglorious laid while musick flows around  Perfumes and oils and wine and wanton hours  Amid the roses fierce Repentance rears  Her snaky crest a quick returning twinge  Shoots thro' the conscious heart where honour still  And great design against th' oppressive load  Of luxury by fits impatient heave  BUT absent what fantastick pangs arrous'd  Rage in each thought by restless musing fed  Chill the warm cheek and blast the bloom of life  Neglected fortune flies and sliding swift  Prone into ruin fall his scorn'd affairs  'Tis nought but gloom around The darken'd sun  Loses his light The rosybosom'd SPRING  To weeping fancy pines and yon bright arch  Of heaven lowbends into a dusky vault  All nature fades extinct and she alone  Heard felt and seen possesses every thought  Fills every sense and pants in every vein  Books are but formal dulness tedious Friends  And sad amid the social band he sits  Lonely and inattentive From the tongue  Th' unfinish'd period falls while borne away  On swelling thought his wafted spirit flies  To the vain bosom of his distant fair  And leaves the semblance of a lover fix'd  In melancholy site with head declin'd  And lovedejected eyes Sudden he starts  Shook from his tender trance and restless runs  To glimmering shades and sympathetick glooms  Where the dun umbrage o'er the falling stream  Romantic hangs there thro' the pensive dusk  Strays in heartthrilling meditation lost  Indulging all to love or on the bank  Thrown amid drooping lillies swells the breeze  With sighs unceasing and the brook with tears  Thus in soft anguish he consumes the day  Nor quits his deep retirement till the moon  Peeps thro' the chambers of the fleecy east  Enlighten'd by degrees and in her train  Leads on the gentle hours then forth he walks  Beneath the trembling languish of her beams  With soften'd soul and wooes the bird of eve  To mingle woes with his or while the world  And all the sons of care lie hush'd in sleep  Associates with the midnight shadows drear  And sighing to the lonely taper pours  His idlytortur'd heart into the page  Meant for the moving messenger of love  Where rapture burns on rapture every line  With rising frenzy fir'd But if on bed  Delirious flung sleep from his pillow flies  All night he tosses nor the balmy power  In any posture finds till the grey morn  Lifts her pale lustre on the paler wretch  Exanimate by love and then perhaps  Exhausted nature sinks a while to rest  Still interrupted by distracted dreams  That o'er the sick imagination rise  And in black colours paint the mimick scene  Oft with th' enchantress of his soul he talks  Sometimes in crouds distress'd or if retir'd  To secretwinding flowerenwoven bowers  Far from the dull impertinence of man  Just as he credulous his thousand cares  Begins to lose in blind oblivious love  Snatch'd from her yielded hand he knows not how  Thro' forests huge and long untravel'd heaths  With desolation brown he wanders waste  In night and tempest wrapt or shrinks aghast  Back from the bending precipice or wades  The turbid stream below and strives to reach  The farther shore where succourless and sad  Wild as a Bacchanal she spreads her arms  But strives in vain borne by th' outragious flood  To distance down he rides the ridgy wave  Or whelm'd beneath the boiling eddy sinks  Then a weak wailing lamentable cry  Is heard and all in tears he wakes again  To tread the circle of revolving woe  These are the charming agonies of love  Whose misery delights But thro' the heart  Should jealousy its venom once diffuse  'Tis then delightful misery no more  But agony unmix'd incessant rage  Corroding every thought and blasting all  Love's paradise Ye fairy prospects then  Ye beds of roses and ye bowers of joy  Farewell Ye gleamings of departing peace  Shine out your last the yellow tinging plague  Internal vision taints and in a night  Of livid gloom imagination wraps  Ay then instead of loveenliven'd cheeks  Of funny features and of ardent eyes  With flowing raptures bright dark looks succeed  Suffus'd and glaring with untender fire  A clouded aspect and a burning cheek  Where the whole poison'd soul malignant sits  And frightens love away Ten thousand fears  Invented wild ten thousand frantick views  Of horrid rivals hanging on the charms  For which he melts in fondness eat him up  With fervent anguish and consuming pine  In vain reproaches lend their idle aid  Deceitful pride and resolution frail  Giving a moment's ease Reflection pours  Afresh her beauties on his busy thought  Her first endearments twining round the soul  With all the witchcraft of ensnaring love  Strait the fierce storm involves his mind anew  Flames thro' the nerves and boils along the veins  While anxious doubt distracts the tortur'd heart  For even the sad assurance of his fears  Were peace to what he feels Thus the warm youth  Whom love deludes into his thorny wilds  Thro' flowerytempting paths or leads a life  Of feaver'd rapture or of cruel care  His brightest aims extinguish'd all and all  His lively moments running down to waste  BUT happy they the happiest of their kind  Whom gentler stars unite and in one fate  Their hearts their fortunes and their beings blend  'Tis not the coarser tie of human laws  Unnatural oft and foreign to the mind  That binds their peace but harmony itself  Attuning all their passions into love  Where friendship fullexerts his softest power  Perfect esteem enliven'd by desire  Ineffable and sympathy of soul  Thought meeting thought and will preventing will  With boundless confidence for nought but love  Can answer love and render bliss secure  Let him ungenerous who alone intent  To bless himself from sordid parents buys  The loathing virgin in eternal care  Wellmerited consume his nights and days  Let barbarous nations whose inhuman love  Is wild desire fierce as the suns they feel  Let eastern tyrants from the light of heaven  Seclude their bosomslaves meanly possess'd  Of a meer lifeless violated form  While those whom love cements in holy faith  And equal transport free as nature live  Disdaining fear for what's the world to them  Its pomp its pleasure and its nonsense all  Who in each other clasp whatever fair  High fancy forms and lavish hearts can wish  Something than beauty dearer should they look  Or on the mind or mindillumin'd face  Truth goodness honour harmony and love  The richest bounty of indulgent HEAVEN  Meantime a smiling Offspring rises round  And mingles both their graces By degrees  The human blossom blows and every day  Soft as it rolls along shews some new charm  The father's lustre and the mother's bloom  Then infant reason grows apace and calls  For the kind hand of an assiduous care  Delightful task to rear the tender thought  To teach the young idea how to shoot  To pour the fresh instruction o'er the mind  To breathe th' inspiring spirit and to plant  The generous purpose in the glowing breast  Oh speak the joy you whom the sudden tear  Surprizes often while you look around  And nothing strikes your eye but sights of bliss  All various nature pressing on the heart  Obedient fortune and approving HEAVEN  These are the blessings of diviner love  And thus their moments fly The seasons thus  As ceaseleless round a jarring world they roll  Still find them happy and consenting SPRING  Sheds her own rosy garland on their head  Till evening comes at last cool gentle calm  When after the long vernal day of life  Enamour'd more as soul approaches soul  Together down they sink in social sleep  FINIS  BOOKS Printed for and Sold by A MILLAR at Buchanan'sHead overagainst St Clement's Church in the Strand  GEorgii Buchanani Scoti

_FROM yonder fields of aether fair disclos'd  Child of the Sun illustrious  Summer  comes  In pride of youth and felt thro' Nature's depth  He comes attended by the fultry  Hours    And everfanning  Breezes  on his way  While from his ardent look the turning  Spring  Averts her blushful face and earth and skies  Allsmiling to his hot dominion leaves  Hence let me haste into the midwood shade  Where scarce a sunbeam wanders thro' the gloom  And on the darkgreen grass beside the brink  Of haunted stream that by the roots of oak  Rowls o'er the rocky channel lie at large  And sing the glories of the circling  year  Come  Inspiration  from thy hermit seat  By mortal seldom found may fancy dare  From thy fix'd serious muse and raptur'd eye  Shot on surrounding heaven to steal one look  Creative of the poet every power  Exalting to an extasy of soul  And thou the muse's honour and her friend  In whom the human graces all unite  Pure light of mind and tenderness of heart  Genius and wisdom the gay social sense  By decency chastiz'd goodness and wit  In seldommeeting harmony combin'd  Unblemish'd honour and an active zeal  For  Britain's  glory Liberty and Man  O  Dodington  attend my rural song  Stoop to my theme inspirit every line  And teach me to deserve thy best applause  With what a perfect worldrevolving power  Were first th' unwieldy planets launch'd along  Th' illimitable void Thus to remain  Amid the flux of many thousand years  That oft has swept the busy race of men  And all their labour'd monuments away  Unresting changless matchless in their course  To night and day with the delightful round  Of  Seasons  faithful not excentric once  So pois'd and perfect is the vast machine  When now no more th' alternate  Twins  are fir'd  And  Cancer  reddens with the solar blaze  Short is the doubtful empire of the night  And soon observant of approaching day  The meekey'd morn appears mother of dews  At first faintgleaming in the dappled east  Till far o'er aether shoots the trembling glow  And from before the lustre of her face  White break the clouds away With tardy step  Brown night retires Young day pours in apace  And opens all the lawny prospect wide  The dripping rock the mountain's misty top  Swell on the eye and brighten with the dawn  Blue thro' the dusk the smoaking currents shine  And from the bladed field the fearful hare  Limps aukward while along the forest glade  The wild deer trip and often turning gaze  At early passenger Musick awakes  The native voice of undissembled joy  And thick around the woodland hymns arise  Rous'd by the cock the soonclad shepherd leaves  His mossy cottage where with  Peace  he dwells  And from the crowded fold in order drives  His flock to taste the verdure of the morn  Falsly luxurious will not man awake  And starting from the bed of sloth enjoy  The cool the fragrant and the silent hour  To meditation due and sacred song  And is there ought in sleep can charm the wise  To lie in dead oblivion losing half  The fleeting moments of too short a life  Total extinction of th' enlighten'd soul  Or else to feverish vanity alive  Wilder'd and tossing thro' distemper'd dreams  Who would in such a gloomy state remain  Longer than nature craves when every Muse  And every blooming Pleasure wait without  To bless the wildydevious morning walk  But yonder comes the powerful king of day  Rejoycing in the east The lessening cloud  The kindling azure and the mountain's brim  Tipt with aetherial gold his near approach  Betoken glad and now apparent all  Aslant the dewbright earth and colour'd air  He looks in boundless majesty abroad  And sheds the shining day that burnish'd plays  On rocks and hills and towers and wandering streams  Highgleaming from afar Prime chearer Light  Of all material beings first and best  Efflux divine Nature's resplendent robe  Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt  In unessential gloom and thou red Sun  In whose wide circle worlds of radiance lie  Exhaustless Brightness may I sing of thee  Who would the blessings first and last recount  That in a full effusion from thee flow  As soon might number at the height of noon  The rays that radiate from thy cloudless sphere  A universal glory darting round  'Tis by thy secret strong attractive force  As with a chain indissoluble bound  Thy system rolls entire from the far bourne  Of slowpac'd  Saturn  to the scarce seen disk  Of  Mercury  lost in excessive blaze  Informer of the planetary train  Without whose vital and effectual glance  They wou'd be brute uncomfortable mass  And not as now the green abodes of life  How many forms of being wait on thee  Inhaling gladness from th' unfetter'd mind  By thee sublim'd to that dayliving race  The mixing myriads of thy setting beam  The vegetable world is also thine  Parent of  Seasons  from whose richstain'd rays  Reflected various various colours rise  The freshening mantle of the youthful year  The wild embroidery of the watry vale  With all that chears the sense and charms the heart  The branching grove thy lusty product stands  Diffus'd and deep to quench the summer noon  And crowd a shade for the retreating swain  When on his russet fields you look direct  Fruit is thy bounty too with Juice replete  Acid or mild and from thy ray receives  A flavour pleasing to the taste of man  By thee concocted blushes and by thee  Fully matur'd into the verdant lap  Of  Industry  the mellow plenty falls  Extensive harvests wave at thy command  And the bright ear consolidate by thee  Bends unwitholding to the reaper's hand  Even  Winter  speaks thy power whose every blast  O'ercast with tempest or severely sharp  With breathing frost is eloquent of thee  And makes us languish for thy vernal gleams  Shot to the bowels of the teeming earth  The ripening ore confesses all thy power  Hence Labour draws his tools hence waving War  Flames on the day hence busy Commerce binds  The round of nations in a golden chain  And hence the sculptur'd palace sumptuous shines  With glittering silver and refulgent gold  Th' unfruitful rock itself impregn'd by thee  In dark retirement forms the lucid stone  Collected light compact that polish'd bright  And all its native lustre let abroad  Shines proudly on the bosoms of the fair  At thee the ruby lights his deepening glow  A bleeding radiance grateful to the view  From thee the saphire solid aether takes  His hue cerulean and of evening tinct  The purplestreaming amethyst is thine  With thy own smile the yellow topaz burns  Nor deeper verdure dies the robe of Spring  When first she gives it to the southern gale  Than the green emerald shows But all combin'd  Thick thro' the whitening opal play thy beams  Or flying several from its surface form  A trembling variance of revolving hues  As the site varies in the gazer's hand  The very dead creation from thy touch  Assumes a mimic life By thee refin'd  In brisker measures the relucent stream  Frisks o'er the mead The precipice abrupt  Projecting horror on the blacken'd flood  Softens at thy return The desart joys  Wildly thro' all his melancholy bounds  Rude ruins glitter and the briny deep  Seen from some pointed promontory's top  Reflects from every fluctuating wave  A glance extensive as the day But these  And all the much transported muse can sing  Are to thy beauty dignity and use  Unequal far great delegated source  Of light and life and grace and joy below  How shall I then attempt to sing of him  Who  Light Himself  in uncreated light  Invested deep dwells awfully retir'd  From mortal eye or angel's purer ken  Whose single smile has from the first of time  Fill'd overflowing all those lamps of heaven  That beam for ever thro' the boundless sky  But should he hide his face th' astonish'd sun  And all th' extinguish'd stars would loosening reel  Wide from their spheres and chaos come again  And yet was every faultering tongue of man  Almighty Poet  silent in thy praise  Thy matchless works in each exalted line  And all the full harmonic universe  Would vocal or expressive thee attest  The cause the glory and the end of all  To me be nature's volume wide display'd  And to peruse the broad illumin'd page  Or haply catching inspiration thence  Some easy passage raptur'd to translate  My sole delight as thro' the falling glooms  Pensive I muse or with the rising day  On fancy's eaglewing excursive soar  Fierceflaming up the heavens the piercing sun  Melts into limpid air the highrais'd clouds  And morning mists that hover'd round the hills  In partycolour'd bands till all unveil'd  The face of nature shines from where earth seems  Farstretch'd around to meet the bending sphere  Half in a blush of clustering roses lost  Dewdropping coolness to the shade retires  And tyrant heat dispreading thro' the sky  By sharp degrees his burning influence reigns  On man and beast and herb and tepid stream  Who can unpitying see the flowery race  Shed by the morn their newflush'd bloom resign  Before th' unbating beam So fade the fair  When fevers revel thro' their azure veins  But one the follower of the sun they say  Sad when he sets shuts up her yellow leaves  Weeping all night and when he warm returns  Points her enamour'd bosom to his ray  Home from his morning task the swain retreats  His flock before him stepping to the fold  While the fulludder'd mother lows around  The chearful cottage then expecting food  The food of innocence and health The daw  The rook and magpie to the greygrown oaks  That the calm village in their verdant arms  Sheltering embrace direct their lazy flight  Where on the mingling boughs they sit embower'd  All the hot noon till cooler hours arise  Faint underneath the homely fowls convene  And in a corner of the buzzing shade  The house dog with th' employless greyhound lies  Outstretch'd and sleepy In his slumbers one  Attacks the nightly thief and one exults  O'er hill and dale till waken'd by the wasp  They bootless snap Nor shall the muse disdain  To let the little noisy summerrace  Live in her lay and flutter thro' her song  Not mean tho' simple to the sun ally'd  From him their high descent direct they draw  Wak'd by his warmer ray the reptile young  Come wing'd abroad by the light air upborn  Lighter and full of life From every chink  And secret corner where they slept away  The wintry glooms by myriads all at once  Swarming they pour green speckled yellow grey  Black azure brown more than th' assisted eye  Of poring virtuoso can discern  Ten thousand forms Ten thousand different tribes  People the blaze To sunny waters some  By fatal instinct fly where on the pool  They sportive wheel or sailing down the stream  Are snatch'd immediate by the springing Trout  Often beguil'd Some thro' the greenwood glade  Delight to stray there lodg'd amus'd and fed  In the fresh leaf Luxurious others make  The meads their choice and visit every flower  And every latent herb but careful still  To shun the mazes of the sounding bee  As o'er the blooms he sweeps Some to the house  The fold and dairy hungry bend their flight  Sip round the pail or taste the curdling cheese  Oft inadvertent by the boiling stream  Are pierc'd to death or weltering in the bowl  With powerless wings around them wrapt expire  But chief to heedless flies the window proves  A constant death where gloomily retir'd  The villain spider lives cunning and fierce  Mixture abhorr'd Amid a mangled heap  Of carcasses in eager watch he sits  O'erlooking all his waving snares around  Within an inch the dreadless wanderer oft  Passes as oft the ruffian shows his front  The prey at last ensnar'd he dreadful darts  With rapid glide along the leaning line  And fixing in the fly his cruel fangs  Strides backward grimly pleas'd the fluttering wing  And shriller sound declare extream distress  And ask the helping hospitable hand  Echoes the living surface of the ground  Nor undelightful is the ceaseless hum  To him who muses thro' the woods at noon  Or drowsy shepherd as he lies reclin'd  With halfshut eyes beneath the floating shade  Of willows grey closecrouding o'er the brook  Let no presuming impious railer tax  Creative Wisdom as if ought was form'd  In vain or not for admirable ends  Shall little haughty ignorance pronounce  His works unwise of which the smallest part  Exceeds the narrow vision of his mind  Thus on the concave of a sounding dome  On swelling columns heav'd the pride of art  Wanders a critic fly his feeble ray  Extends an inch around yet blindly bold  He dares dislike the structure of the whole  And lives the man whose universal eye  Has swept at once th' unbounded scheme of things  Mark'd their dependance so and firm accord  As with unfaultering accent to conclude  That  This  availeth nought Has any seen  The mighty chain of beings lessening down  From  Infinite Perfection  to the brink  Of dreary  Nothing  desolate abyss  Recoiling giddy thought or with sharp glance  Such as remotelywafting spirits use  Beheld the glories of the little world  Till then alone let zealous praise ascend  And hymns of heavenly wonder to that  Power    Whole wisdom shines as lovely on our minds  As on our smiling eyes his servantsun  Thick in yon stream of light a thousand ways  Upwards and downwards thwarting and convolv'd  The quivering kingdoms sport with tempestwing  Till  Winter  sweeps them from the face of day  Even so luxurious men unheeding pass  An idle summerlife in fortune's shine  A season's glitter In softcircling robes  Which the hard hand of  Industry  has wrought  The human insects glow by  Hunger  fed  And chear'd by toiling  Thirst  they rowl about  From toy to trifle vanity to vice  Till blown away by Death Oblivion comes  Behind and strikes them from the book of life  Now swarms the village o'er the jovial mead  The rustic youth brown with meridian toil  Healthful and strong full as the summerrose  Blown by prevailing suns the blooming maid  Halfnaked swelling on the sight and all  Her kindled graces burning o'er her cheek  Even stooping age is here and infanthands  Trail the long rake or with the fragrant load  O'ercharg'd amid the soft oppression roll  Wide flies the tedded grain all in a row  Advancing broad or wheeling round the field  They spread the tawny Harvest to the sun  That casts refreshful round a rural smell  Or as they rake the greenappearing ground  And drive the dusky wave along the mead  Rises the russet haycock thick behind  In order gay While heard from dale to dale  Waking the breeze resounds the blended voice  Of happy labour love and social glee  'Tis raging noon and vertical the sun  Shoots thro' th' expanding air a torrid gleam  O'er heaven and earth far as the darted eye  Can pierce a dazling deluge reigns and all  From pole to pole is undistinguish'd blaze  Down to the dusty earth the sight o'erpower'd  Stoops for relief but thence ascending streams  And keen reflection pain Burnt to the heart  Are the refreshless fields their arid hue  Adds a new fever to the sickening soul  And o'er their slippery surface wary treads  The foot of thirsty pilgrim often dipt  In a cross rill presenting to his wish  A living draught he seels before he drinks  Echo no more returns the sandy sound  Of sharpening scythe the mower sinking heaps  O'er him the humid hay with flowers perfum'd  And scarce a chirping grashopper is heard  Thro' the dumb mead Distressful nature pants  The desart reddens and the stubborn rock  Split to the center sweats at every pore  The very streams look languid from afar  Or thro' the fervid glade impetuous hurl  Into the shelter of the crackling grove  Allconquering heat oh intermit thy wrath  And on my throbbing temples potent thus  Beam not so hard Incessant still you flow  And still another fervent flood succeeds  Pour'd on the head profuse In vain I sigh  And restless turn and look around for night  Night is far off and hotter hours approach  Who can endure the too resplendent scene  Already darkens on the dizzy sight  And double objects dance unreal sounds  Sing deep around a weight of sultry dew  Hangs deathful on the limbs shiver the nerves  The supple sinews sink and on the heart  Misgiving horror lays his heavy hand  Thrice happy he that on the sunless side  Of a romantic mountain forestcrown'd  Beneath the whole collected shade reclines  Or in the gelid caverns woodbinewrought  And fresh bedew'd with everspouting streams  Sits coolly calm while all the world without  Unsatisfy'd and sick tosses in noon  Emblem instructive of the virtuous man  Who keeps his temper'd mind serere and pure  And all his passions aptly harmoniz'd  Amid a jarring world with vice inflam'd  Welcome ye shades ye bowery thickets hail  Ye lofty pines ye venerable oaks  Ye ashes wild resounding o'er the steep  Delicious is your shelter to the soul  As to the hunted hart the sallying spring  Or stream fullflowing that his swelling sides  Laves as he floats along the herbag'd brink  Cold thro' the nerves your pleasing comfort glides  The heart beats glad the freshexpanded eye  And ear resume their watch the sinews knit  And life shoots swift thro' every lighten'd limb  All in th' adjoining brook that shrills along  The vocal grove now fretting o'er a rock  Now scarcely moving thro' a reedy pool  Now starting to a sudden stream and now  Gently diffus'd into a limpid plain  A various groupe the herds and flocks compose  Rural confusion On the grassy bank  Some ruminating lie while others stand  Half in the flood and often bending sip  The circling surface In the middle droops  The strong laborious ox of honest front  Which incompos'd he shakes and from his sides  The troublous insects lashes with his tail  Returning still Amid his subjects safe  Slumbers the monarehswain his careless arm  Thrown round his head on downy moss sustain'd  Here laid his scrip with wholesome viands fill'd  And there his sceptrecrook and watchful dog  Light fly his slumbers if perchance a flight  Of angry hornets fasten on the herd  That startling scatters from the shallow brook  In search of lavish stream Tossing the foam  They scorn the keeper's voice and scour the plain  Thro' all the bright severity of noon  While from their labouring breasts a hollow moan  Proceeding runs lowbellowing round the hills  Oft in this season too the horse provok'd  While his big sinews full of spirits swell  Trembling with vigour in the heat of blood  Springs the high fence and o'er the field effus'd  Darts on the gloomy flood with steady eye  And heart estrang'd to fear his nervous chest  Luxuriant and erect the seat of strength  Bears downth' opposing stream quenchless his thirst  He takes the river at redoubled draughts  And with wide nostrils snorting skims the wave  Still let me pierce into the midnight depth  Of yonder grove of wildest largest growth  That high embowering in the middle air  Nods o'er the mount beneath At every step  Solemn and slow the shadows blacker fall  And all is awful silent gloom around  These are the haunts of meditation these  The scenes where antient Bards th' inspiring breath  Extatic felt and from this world retir'd  Convers'd with angels and immortal forms  On heavenly errants bent to save the fall  Of virtue strugling on the brink of vice  In waking whispers and repeated dreams  To hint pure thought and warn'd the favour'd soul  For future tryals fated to prepare  To prompt the Poet who devoted gives  His muse to better themes to sooth the pangs  Of dying Saints and from the Patriot's breast  Backward to mingle in detested war  But foremost when engag'd to turn the death  And numberless such offices of love  Daily and nightly zealous to perform  Shook sudden from the bosom of the sky  A thousand shapes or glide athwart the dusk  Or stalk majestick on Arous'd I feel  A sacred terror and severe delight  Creep thro' my mortal frame and thus methinks  Those accents murmur'd in th' abstracted ear  Pronounce distinct " Be not of us afraid  " Poor kindred man thy fellowcreatures we  " From the same  ParentPower  our beings drew  " The same our  Lord  and laws and great pursuit  " Once some of us like thee thro' stormy life  " Toil'd tempestbeaten e'er we could attain  " This holy calm this harmony of mind  " Where purity and peace immingle charms  " Then fear us not but with responsive song  " Oft in these dim recesses undisturb'd  " By noisy folly and discordant vice  " Of nature sing with us and nature's  God  " And frequent at the middle waste of night  " Or all day long in desarts still are heard  " Now here now there now wheeling in midsky  " Around or underneath aerial sounds  " Sent from angelic harps and voices join'd  " A happiness bestow'd by us alone  " On contemplation or the hallow'd ear  " Of Poet swelling to seraphic strain "  Thus up the Mount in visionary muse  I stray regardless whither till the stun  Of a near fall of water every sense  Wakes from the charm of thought swiftshrinking back  I stand aghast and view the broken scene  Smooth to the shaggy brink a spreading flood  Rolls fair and placid till collected all  In one big glut as sinks the shelving ground  Th' impetuous torrent tumbling down the steep  Thunders and shakes th' astonish'd country round  Now a blue watry sheet anon dispers'd  A hoary mist then gathered in again  A darted stream aslant the hollow rock  This way and that tormented dashing thick  From seep to seep with wild infracted course  And restless roaring to the humble vale  With the rough prospect tir'd I turn my gaze  Where in long vista the softmurmuring main  Darts a green lustre trembling thro' the trees  Or to yon silverstreaming threads of light  A showery radiance beaming thro' the boughs  Invited from the rock to whose dark cliff  He clings the steepascending eagle soars  With upward pinions thro' th' attractive gleam  And giving full his bosom to the blaze  Gains on the sun while all the feathery race  Smote with afflictive noon disorder'd droop  Deep in the thicket or from bower to bower  Responsive force an interrupted strain  The stockdove only thro' the forest cooes  Mournfully hoarse oft ceasing from his plaint  Short interval of weary woe again  The sad idea of his murder'd mate  Struck from his side by savage fowler's guile  Across his fancy comes and then resounds  A louder song of sorrow thro' the grove  Beside the dewy border let me sit  All in the freshness of the humid air  There on that rock by  Nature  's chissel carv'd  An ample chair mosslin'd and over head  By flowering umbrage shaded where the bee  Strays diligent and with th' extracted sweet  Of honeysuckle loads his little thigh  And what a various prospect lies around  Of hills and vales and woods and lawns and spires  And towns betwixt and gilded streams till all  The stretching landskip into smoak decays  Happy  Britannia  where the Queen of arts  Inspiring vigour  Liberty  abroad  Walks thro' the land of Heroes unconfin'd  And scatters plenty with unsparing hand  Rich is the soil and merciful the skies  Thy streams unfailing in the summer's drought  Unmatch'd thy guardianoaks thy vallies float  With golden waves and on thy mountains flocks  Bleat numberless while roving round their sides  Bellow the blackening herds in lusty droves  Beneath thy meadows flame and rise unquell'd  Against the mower's scythe On every hand  Thy villas shine Thy country teems with wealth  And  Property  assures it to the swain  Pleas'd and unweary'd in his certain toil  Full are thy cities with the Sons of art  And trade and joy in every busy street  Mingling are heard even  Drudgery  himself  As at the car he sweats or dusty hews  The palacestone looks gay Thy crouded ports  Where rising masts an endless prospect yield  With labour burn and echo to the shouts  Of hurry'd sailor as he hearty waves  His last adieu and loosening every sheet  Resigns the spreading vessel to the wind  Bold firm and graceful are thy generous youth  By hardship sinew'd and by danger fir'd  Scattering the nations where they go and first  Or in the listed plain or wintry seas  Mild are thy glories too as o'er the plans  Of thriving peace thy thoughtful sires preside  In genius and substantial learning high  For every virtue every worth renown'd  Sincere plainhearted hospitable kind  Yet like the mustering thunder when provok'd  The dread of tyrants and the sole resource  Of such as under grim oppression groan  Thy sons of glory many thine a  More    As  Cato  firm as  Aristides  just  Like rigid  Cincinnatus  nobly poor  A dauntless soul erect who smil'd on death  Frugal and wise a  Walsingham  is thine  A  Drake  who made thee mistress of the deep  And bore thy name in thunder round the world  Then flam'd thy spirit high but who can speak  The numerous worthies of the  maiden  reign  In  Raleigh  mark their every glory mix'd  Raleigh  the scourge of  Spain  whose breast with all  The sage the patriot and the hero burn'd  Nor sunk his vigour when a cowardreign  The warrior fetter'd and at last resign'd  To glut the vengeance of a vanquish'd foe  Then deep thro' fate his mind retorted saw  And with his prisonhours enrich'd the world  Yet found no times in all the long research  So glorious or so base as those he prov'd  In which he conquer'd and in which he bled  A  Hambden  thine of unsubmitting soul  Who stemm'd the torrent of a downward age  To slavery prone and bade thee rise again  In all thy native pomp of  Freedom  fierce  Nor can the muse the gallant  Sidney  pass  The plume of war with every lawrel crown'd  The lover's myrtle and the poet's bay  Nor him of later name firm to the cause  Of  Liberty  her rough determin'd friend  The  British Brutus  whose united blood  With  Rnssel  thine thou patriot wise and calm  Stain'd the sad annals of a giddy reign  Aiming at lawless power tho' meanly sunk  In loose inglorious sloth High thy renown  In  Sages  too far as the sacred light  Of science spreads and wakes the muses' song  Thine is a  Bacon  form'd of happy mold  When  Nature  smil'd deep comprehensive clear  Exact and elegant in one rich soul  Plato  the  Stagyrite  and  Tully  join'd  The generous  Anthony Ashley Cooper  Earl of  Shaftsbury  Ashley  thine the friend of man  Who scann'd his nature with a brother's eye  His weakness prompt to shade to raise his aim  To touch the finer movements of the mind  And with the  moral Beauty  charm the heart  What need I name thy  Boyle  whose pious search  Still sought the great  Creator  in his works  By sure experience led And why thy  Locke    Who made the whole internal world his own  Let comprehensive  Newton  speak thy fame  In all philosophy For solemn song  Is not wild  Shakespear  nature's boast and thine  And every greatly amiable muse  Of elder ages in thy  Milton  met  His was the treasure of two thousand years  Seldom indulg'd to man a godlike mind  Unlimited and various as his  Theme    Astonishing as  Chaos  as the bloom  Of blowing  Eden  fair foft as the talk  Of our  grand Parents  and as  Heaven  sublime  May my song soften as thy daughters I  Britannia  hail for beauty is their own  The feeling heart simplicity of life  And elegance and taste the faultless form  Shap'd by the hand of  Harmony  the cheek  Where the live crimson thro' the native white  Softshooting o'er the face diffuses bloom  And every nameless grace the parted lip  Like the red rosebud moist with morningdew  Breathing delight and under flowing jet  Or sunny ringlets or of circling brown  The neck slightshaded and the swelling breast  The look resistless piercing to the soul  And by the soul inform'd when drest in love  She sits high smiling in the conscious eye  Island of bliss amid the suject seas  That thunder round thy rocky coasts set up  At once the wonder terror and delight  Of distant nations whose remotest shore  Can soon be shaken by thy naval arm  Not to be shook thyself but all assaults  Baffling like thy hoar cliffs the loud seawave  O Thou by whose almighty  Nod  the scale  Of empire rises or alternate falls  Send forth the saving  Virtues  round the land  In bright patrol white  Peace  and social  Love    The tenderlooking  Charity  intent  On gentle deeds and shedding tears thro' smiles  Undaunted  Truth  and  Dignity  of mind  Courage  compos'd and keen sound  Temperance    Healthful in heart and look clear  Chastity    With blushes reddening as she moves along  Disorder'd at the deep regard she draws  Rough  Industry    Activity  untry'd  With copious life inform'd and all awake  While in the radiant front superior shines  That first paternal Virtue  public Zeal    Who casts o'er all an equal wide survey  And ever musing on the common weal  Stll labours glorious with some brave design  Thus far transported by my country's love  Nobly digressive from my theme I've aim'd  To sing her praises in ambitious verse  While slightly to recount I simply meant  The various summerhorrors which infest  Kingdoms that scorch below severer suns  Kingdoms on which direct the flood of day  Oppressive falls and gives the gloomy hue  And feature gross or worse to ruthless deeds  Wan jealousy red rage and fell revenge  Their hasty spirit prompts Illfated race  Altho' the treasures of the sun be theirs  Rocks rich in gems and mountains big with mines  Whence over sands of gold the  Niger  rolls  His amber wave while on his balmy banks  Or in the spicy  Abyssinian  vales  The citron orange and pomegranate drink  Intolerable day yet in their coats  A cooling juice contain Peaceful beneath  Leans the huge elephant and in his shade  A multitde of beauteous creatures play  And birds of bolder note rejoice around  And oft amid their aromatic groves  Touch'd  the torch of noon the gummy bark  Smouldering begins to roll the dusky wreath  Instant so swift the ruddy ruin spreads  A cloud of incense shadows all the land  And o'er a thousand thundering trees at once  Riots with lawless rage the running blaze  But ciefly should fomenting winds assist  And doubling blend the circulating waves  Of flame tempestuous or directly on  Farstreaming drive them thro' the forest's length  But other views await where heaven above  Glows like an arch of brass and all below  The brownburnt earth a mass of iron lies  Of fruits and flowers and every verdure spoilt  Barren and bare a joyless weary waste  Thincottag'd and in time of trying need  Abandon'd by the vanish'd brook like one  Of fading fortune by his treacherous friend  Such are thy horrid desarts  Barca  such  Zaara  thy hot inhospitable sands  Continuous rising often with the blast  Till the sun sees no more and unknit earth  Shook by the south into the darken'd air  Falls in new hilly kingdoms o'er the waste  Hence late expos'd if distant fame says true  A smother'd city from the sandy wave  Emergent rose with olivefields around  Fresh woods reclining herds and silent flocks  Amusing all and incorrupted seen  For by the nitrous penetrating salts  Mix'd copious with the sand pierc'd and preserv'd  Each object hardens gradual into stone  Its posture fixes and its colour keeps  The statuefolk within unnumber'd croud  The streets in various attitudes surpriz'd  By sudden fate and live on every face  The passions caught beyond the sculptor's art  Here leaning soft the marblelovers stand  Delighted even in death and each for each  Feeling alone with that expressive look  Which perfect  Nature  only knows to give  And there the father agonizing bends  Fond o'er his weeping wife and infant train  Aghast and trembling tho' they know not why  The stiffen'd vulgar stretch their arms to heaven  With horror starting while in council deep  Assembled full the hoaryheaded sires  Sit sadlythoughtful of the public fate  As when old  Rome  beneath the raging  Gaul    Sunk her proud turrets resolute on death  Around the  Forum  sat the grey divan  Of  Senators  majestic motionless  With ivorystaves and in their awful robes  Dress'd like the falling fathers of mankind  Amaz'd and shivering from the solemn sight  The red barbarians shrunk and deem'd them  Gods  'Tis here that  Thirst  has fix'd his dry domain  And walks his wide malignant round in search  Of pilgrim lost or on the  In the desart of  Araoan  are two tombs with inscriptions on them importing that the persons there interr'd were a rich merchant and a poor carrier who both died of thirst and that the former had given to the latter ten thousand ducats for one cruise of water  Merchant's  tomb  Triumphant sits who for a single cruise  Of unavailing water paid so dear  Nor could the gold his hard associate save  Here the green serpent gathers up his train  In orbs immense then darting out anew  Progressive rattles thro' the wither'd brake  And rolling frightful guards the scanty fount  If fount there be or of diminsh'd size  But mighty mischief on th' unguarded swain  Steals full of rancour Here the savage race  Roam licens'd by the shading hour of blood  And foul misdeed when the pure day has shut  His sacred eye The rabid tyger then  The fiery panther and the whisker'd pard  Bespeckled fair the beauty of the waste  In dire divan surround their  shaggy King    Majestic stalking o'er the burning sand  With planted step while an obsequious croud  Of grinning forms at humble distance wait  These all together join'd from darksome caves  Where o'er gnaw'd bones they slumber'd out the day  By supreme hunger smit and thirst intense  At once their mingling voices raise to  Heaven    And with imperious and repeated roars  Demanding food the wilderness resounds  From  Atlas  eastward to the frighted  Nile  Unhappy he who from the first of joys  Society cut off is left alone  Amid this world of death Ceaseless he sits  Sad on the jutting eminence and views  The rowling main that ever toils below  Still fondly forming in the farthest verge  Where the round aether mixes with the wave  Ships dimdiscover'd dropping from the clouds  At evening to the setting sun he turns  A mournful eye and down his dying heart  Sinks helpless while the wonted roar is up  And hiss continual thro' the tedious night  Yet here even here into these black abodes  Of monstors unappall'd from stooping  Rome    And haughty  Caesar    Liberty  retir'd  With  Cato  leading thro'  Numidian  wilds  Disdainful of  Campania  's fertile plains  And all the green delights of  Italy    When for them she must bend the servile knee  And fawning take the blessings once her own  What need I mention those inclement skies  Where frequent o'er the sickening city  Plague    The fiercest son of  Nemesis divine    Collects a close incumbent night of death  Uninterrupted by the living winds  Forbid to blow a wholesome breeze and stain'd  With many a mixture by the sun suffus'd  Of angry aspect Princely  Wisdom  then  Dejects his watchful eye and from the hand  Of drooping  Justice  ineffectual falls  The sword and balance Mute the voice of Joy  And hush'd the murmur of the busy world  Empty the streets with uncouth verdure clad  And rang'd at open noon by beasts of prey  And birds of bloody beak The sullen door  No visit knows nor hears the wailing voice  Of fervent Want Even soulattracted friends  And relatives endear'd for many a year  Savag'd by woe forget the social tye  The close engagement of the kindred heart  And sick in solitude successive die  Untended and unmourn'd While to compleat  The scene of desolation wide around  Denying all retreat the grim guards stand  And give the flying wretch a better death  Much of the force of foreign  Summers  still  Of growling hills that shoot the pillar'd flame  Of earthquake and pale famine could I sing  But equal scenes of horror call me home  For now slowsettling o'er the lurid grove  Unusual darkness broods and growing gains  The broad possession of the sky surcharg'd  With wrathful vapour from the damp abrupt  Where sleep the mineral generations drawn  Thence nitre sulphur vitriol on the day  Steam and fermenting in yon baleful cloud  Extensive o'er the world a reddening gloom  In dreadful promptitude to spring await  The high command A boding silence reigns  Dread thro' the dun expanse save the dull sound  That from the mountain previous to the storm  Rowls o'er the trembling earth disturbs the flood  And stirs the forestleaf without a breath  Prone to the lowest vale th' aerial tribes  Descend the tempestloving raven scarce  Dares wing the dubious dusk In rueful gaze  The cattle stand and on the scouling heavens  Cast a deploring eye by man forsook  Who to the crouded cottage hies him fast  Or seeks the shelter of the downward cave  'Tis dumb amaze and listening terror all  When to the quicker eye the livid glance  Appears far south emissive thro' the cloud  And by the powerful breath of  God  inflate  The thunder raises his tremendous voice  At first lowmuttering but at each approach  The lightnings flash a larger curve and more  The noise astounds till over head a sheet  Of various flame discloses wide then shuts  And opens wider shuts and opens still  Expansive wrapping aether in a blaze  Follows the loosen'd aggravated roar  Enlarging deepening mingling peal on peal  Crush'd horrible convulsing heaven and earth  Down comes a deluge of sonorous hail  In the white heavenly magazines congeal'd  And often fatal to th' unshelter'd head  Of man or rougher beast Widerent the clouds  Pour a whole flood and yet its rage unquench'd  Th' inconquerable lightning struggles thro'  Ragged and sierce or in red whirling balls  And strikes the shepherd as he shuddering sits  Presaging ruin mid the rocky clift  His inmost marrow feels the gliding flame  He dies and like a statue grim'd with age  His live dejected posture still remains  His russet sing'd and rent his hanging hat  Against his crook his sooty cheek reclin'd  While whining at his feet his halsslung'd dog  Importunately kind and fearful pats  On his insensate master for relief  Black from the stroak above the mountainpine  A leaning shatter'd trunk stands scath'd to heaven  The talk of future ages and below  A lifeless groupe the blasted cattle lie  Here the soft flocks with that same harmless look  They wore alive and ruminating still  In fancy's eye and there the frowning bull  And ox halfrais'd A little further burns  The guiltless cottage and the haughty dome  Stoops to the base In one immediate flash  The forest falls or flaming out displays  The savagehunts unpierc'd by day before  Scar'd is the mountain's brow and from the cliff  Tumbles the smitten rock The desart shakes  And gleams and grumbles thro' his deepest dens  Guilt dubious hears with deeplytroubled thought  And yet not always on the guilty head  Falls the devoted flash Young  Celadon  And his  Amelia  were a matchless twain  With equal virtue form'd and equal grace  The same distinguish'd by their sex alone  Hers the mild lustre of the blooming morn  And his the radianee of the risen day  They lov'd But such their guileless passion was  As in the dawn of time alarm'd the heart  Of  Innocence  and undissembling  Truth  'Twas friendship heighten'd by the mutual wish  Th' enchanting hope and sympathetick glow  Struck from the charmsul eye Devoting all  To love each was to each a dearer self  Supremely happy in th' awaken'd power  Of given joy Alone amid the shades  Still in harmonious intercourse they liv'd  The rural day and talk'd the flowing heart  Or sigh'd and look'd unutterable things  Thus pass'd their life a clear united stream  By care unrnffled till in evil hour  The tempest caught them on the tender walk  Heedless how far Her breast presageful heav'd  Unwonted sighs and stealing oft a look  Of the big gloom on  Celadon  her eye  Fell tearful wetting her disorder'd cheek  In vain assuring love and confidence  In heaven repress'd her fear it grew and shook  Her frame near dissolution He perceiv'd  Th' unequal conflict and as angels look  On dying saints his eyes compassion shed  With love illumin'd high " Fear not he said  " Fair innocence thou stranger to offence  " And inward storm  He  who yon skies involves  " In frowns of darkness ever smiles on thee  " With full regard O'er thee the secret shaft  "That wastes at midnight or th' undreaded hour  " Of noon flies hurtless and that very voice  " Which thunders terror thro' the conscious heart  " With tongues of seraphs whispers peace to thine  " 'Tis safety to be near thee sure and thus  " To clasp perfection " From his void embrace  Mysterious heaven that moment in a heap  Of pallid ashes fell the beauteous maid  But who can paint the lover as he stood  Struck by severe amazement hating life  Speechless and fix'd in all the death of woe  So faint resemblance on the marbletomb  The welldissembl'd mourner stooping stands  For ever silent and for ever sad  As from the face of heaven the shatter'd clouds  Tumultuous rove th' interminable blue  Delightful swells into the general arch  That copes the nations Nature from the storm  Shines out afresh and thro' the lighten'd air  A higher lustre and a clearer calm  Diffusive tremble while as if in sign  Of danger past a glittering robe of joy  Set off abundant by the level ray  Inverts the fields yet dropping from distress  'Tis beauty all and grateful song around  Joyn'd to the low of kine and numerous bleat  Of flocks thicknibbling thro' the clover'd vale  And shall the hymn be marr'd by thankless man  Mostfavour'd who with voice articulate  Should lead the chorus of this lower world  Shall ho so soon forgetful of the hand  That hush'd the thunder and expands the sky  After the tempest puff his idle vows  And a new dance of vanity begin  Scarce e'er the pant forsake the feeble heart  Chear'd by the setting beam the sprightly youth  Speeds to the wellknown pool whose crystal depth  A sandy bottom shews A while he stands  Gazing th' inverted landskip half afraid  To meditate the blue profound below  Then plunges headlong down the circling flood  His ebon tresses and his rosy cheek  Instant emerge and thro' the flexile wave  At each short breathing by his lip repell'd  With arms and legs according well he makes  As humour leads an easywinding path  While from his polish'd sides a dewy light  Effuses on the pleas'd spectators round  'Twas then beneath a secretwaving shade  Where winded into lovely solituctes  Runs out the rambling dale that  Damon  sat  Thoughtful and fix'd in philosophic muse  Damon  who still amid the savage woods  And lonely lawns the force of beauty scorn'd  Firm and to false philosophy devote  The brook ran babling by and sighing weak  The breeze among the bending willows play'd  When  Sacharissa  to the cool retreat  With  Amoret  and  Musidora  stole  Warm in their cheek the sultry season glow'd  And rob'd in loose array they came to bathe  Their fervent limbs in the refreshing stream  Tall and majestic  Sacharissa  rose  Superior treading as on  Ida  's top  So  Grecian  bards in wanton fable sung  Highshone the sister and the wife of  Jove  Another  Pallas Musidora  seem'd  Meekey'd sedate and gaining every look  A surer conquest of the sliding heart  While like the  Cyprian  goddess  Amoret    Delicious dress'd in rosydimpled smiles  And all one softness melted on the sense  Nor  Paris  panted stronger when aside  The rivalgoddesses the veil divine  Cast unconfin'd and gave him all their charms  Than  Damon  thou the stoick now no more  But man deepfelt as from the snowy leg  And slender foot th' inverted silk they drew  As the soft touch dissolv'd the virginzone  And thro' the parting robe th' alternate breast  With youth wildthrobbing on thy lawless gaze  Luxuriant rose Yet more enamour'd still  When from their naked limbs of glowing white  In folds loosefloating felt the fainter lawn  And fair expos'd they stood shrunk from themselves  With fancy blushing at the doubtful breeze  Arous'd and starting like the fearful fawn  The  Venus  of  Medicis  So stands the statue that enchants the world  Her full proportions such and bashful so  Bends ineffectual from the roving eye  Then to the flood they rush'd the plunging fair  The parted flood with closing waves receiv'd  And every beauty softening every grace  Flushing afresh a mellow lustre shed  As shines the lilly thro' the crystal mild  Or as the rose amid the morningdew  Puts on a warmer glow In various play  While thus they wanton'd now beneath the wave  But ill conceal'd and now with streaming locks  Rising again the latent  Damon  drew  Such draughts of love and beauty to the soul  As put his harsh philosophy to flight  The joyless search of longdeluded years  And  Musidora  fixing in his heart  Inform'd and humaniz'd him into man  This is the purest exercise of health  The kind refresher of the summerheats  Nor when the brook pellucid Winter keens  Would I weakshivering linger on the brink  Thus life redoubles and is oft preserv'd  By the bold swimmer in the swift illapse  Of accident disasterous Hence the limbs  Knit into force and the same  Roman  arm  That rose victorious o'er the conquer'd earth  First learn'd while tender to subdue the wave  Even from the body's purity the mind  Receives a secret sympathetic aid  Low walks the sun and broadens by degrees  Just o'er the verge of day The rising clouds  That shift perpetual in his vivid train  Their watry mirrors numberless oppos'd  Unfold the hidden riches of his ray  And chase a change of colours round the sky  'Tis all one blush from east to west and now  Behind the dusky earth he dips his orb  Now half immers'd and now a golden curve  Gives one faint glimmer and then disappears  For ever running an enchanted round  Passes the day deceitful tedious void  As fleets the vision o'er the formful brain  This moment hurrying all th' impassion'd soul  The next in nothing lost 'Tis so to him  The dreamer of this earth a chearless blank  A sight of horror to the cruel wretch  Who rowling in inhuman pleasure deep  The whole day long has made the widow pine  And snatch'd the morsel from her orphan's mouth  To give his dogs But to the tuneful mind  Who makes the hopeless heart to sing for joy  Diffusing kind beneficence around  Boastless as now descends the silent dew  To him the long review of order'd life  Is inward rapture only to be felt  Confess'd from yonder slowextinguish'd clouds  All aether saddening sober  Evening  takes  Her wonted station in the middle air  A thousand  Shadows  at her beck First  This  She sends on earth then  That  of deeper die  Steals soft behind and then a  Deeper  still  In circle following circle gathers round  To close the face of things A fresher breeze  Begins to wave the wood and stir the stream  Sweeping with shadowy gust the fields of corn  While the quail clamours for his running mate  His folded flock secure the shepherd home  Hies merryhearted and by turns relieves  The ruddy milkmaid of her brimming pail  The Beauty whom perhaps his witless heart  Unknowing what the joymixt anguish means  Loves fond by the sincerest language shown  Of cordial glances and obliging deeds  Onward they pass o'er many a panting height  And valley sunk and unfrequented where  At fall of eve the fairy people throng  In various game and revelry to pass  The summernight as villagestories tell  But far about they wander from the grave  Of him whom his ungentle fortune urg'd  Against himself to lift the hated hand  Of violence by men cast out from life  And after death to which they drove his hope  Into the broad way side The ruin'd tower  Is also shunn'd whose hoary chambers hold  So nightstruck fancy dreams the yelling ghost  Among the crooked lanes on every hedge  The glowworm lights his lamp and thro' the dark  Twinkles a moving gem On  Evening  's heel  Night  follows fast not in her winterrobe  Of massy stygian woof but loose array'd  In mantle dun A faint erroneous ray  Glanc'd from th' imperfect surfaces of things  Flings half an image on the straining eye  While wavering woods and villages and streams  And rocks and mountaintops that long retain'd  Th' ascending gleam are all one swimming scene  Doubtful if seen whence sudden  Vision  turns  To heaven where  Venus  in the sterry front  Shines eminent and from her genial rise  When daylight sickens till it springs afresh  Sheds influence on earth to love and life  And every form of vegetation kind  As thus th' effulgence tremulous I drink  With glad peruse the lambent lightnings shoot  Across the sky or horizontal dart  O'er half the nations in a minute's space  Conglob'd or long Astonishment succeeds  And silence e'er the various talk begin  The vulgar stare amazement is their joy  And mystic faith a fond sequacious herd  But scrutinous  Philosophy  looks deep  With piercing eye into the latent cause  Nor can she swallow what she does not see  With thee serene  Philosophy  with thee  And thy high praises let me crown my song  Effusive source of evidence and truth  A lustre shedding o'er th' ennobled mind  Stronger than summernoon and pure as that  Whose mild vibrations sooth the parted soul  New to the dawning of coelestial day  Hence thro' her nourish'd powers enlarg'd by thee  She soaring spurns with elevated pride  The tangling mass of cares and low desires  That bind the fluttering croud and angelwing'd  The heights of Science and of Virtue gains  Where all his calm and clear with Nature round  Or in the starry regions or th' abyss  To Reason's and to fancy's eye display'd  The  First  uptracing from the vast inane  The chain of causes and effects to  Him    Who allsustaining in himself alone  Possesses  Being  while the  Last  receives  The whole magnificence of heaven and earth  And every beauty delicate or bold  Obvious or more remote with livelier sense  A world swiftpainted on th' attentive mind  Tutor'd by thee hence  Poetry  exalts  Her voice to ages and informs the page  With music image sentiment and thought  Never to die the treasure of mankind  Their highest honour and their truest joy  Without thee what were unassisted man  A savage roaming thro' the woods and wilds  In quest of prey and with th' unfashion'd furr  Roughclad devoid of every honest art  And elegance of life Nor home nor joy  Domestick mix'd of tenderness and care  Nor moral excellence nor social bliss  Nor law were his nor property nor swain  To turn the furrow nor mechanic hand  Harden'd to toil nor sailor bold nor trade  Mother severe of infinite delights  Nothing save rapine indolence and guile  And woes on woes a stillrevolving train  Whose horrid circle had made human life  Than nonexistence worse But taught by thee  Ours are the plans of policy and peace  To live like brothers and conjunctive all  Embellish life While thus laborious crouds  Ply the tough oar  Philosophy  directs  Starled the helm or like the liberal breath  Of urgent heaven invisible the sails  Swells out and bears th' inferior world along  Nor to this evanescent speck of earth  Poorly confin'd the radiant tracts on high  Are her exalted range intent to gaze  Creation thro' and from that full complex  Of neverending wonders to conceive  Of  the sole Being  right who spoke the word  And nature mov'd compleat With inward view  Thence on th' ideal kingdom swift she turns  Her eye and instant at her virtual glance  Th' obedient phantoms vanish or

But here the cloud  So wills  Eternal Providence  sits deep  Enough for us we know that this dark state  In wayward passions lost and vain pursuits  This infancy of being cannot prove  The final issue

propos'd Address to Mr  ONSLOW  A prospect of the fields ready for harvest Reaping A tale A harvest storm Shooting and hunting their barbarity A ludicrous account of foxhunting A view of an orchard Wallfruit A vineyard A description of fogs frequent in the  part of  AUTUMN  whence a digression enquiring into the rise of fountains and rivers Birds of season considered that now shift their habitation The prodigious number of them that cover the northern and western isles of  SCOTLAND  Hence a view of the country A prospect of the dIscoloured fading woods After a gentle dusky day moonlight Autumnal meteors Morning to which succeeds a calm pure sunshiNe day such as usually shuts up the season The harvest being gathered in the country dissolv'd in joy The whole concludes with a panegyric on a philosophical country life  AUTUMN  _CROWN'D with the sickle and the wheaten shear  While  Autumn  nodding o'er the yellow plain  Comes jovial on the doric reed once more  Wellpleas'd I tune Whate'er the  wintry  frost  Nitrous prepar'd the variousblossom'd  Spring  Put in white promise forth and  SummerSuns  Concocted strong rush boundless now to view  Full perfect all and swell my glorious theme  Onslow  the muse ambitious of thy name  To grace inspire and dignify her song  Would from the  public voice  thy gentle ear  A while engage Thy noble cares she knows  The patriotvirtues that distend thy thought  Spread on thy front and in thy conduct glow  While listening senates hang upon thy tongue  Devolving thro' the maze of eloquence  A rowl of periods sweeter than her song  But she too pants for public virtue she  Tho' weak of power yet strong in ardent will  Whene'er her country rushes on her heart  Assumes a bolder note and fondly tries  To mix the patriot's with the poet's flame  When the bright  Virgin  gives the beauteous days  And  Libra  weighs in equal scales the year  From heaven's high cope the fierce effulgence shook  Of parting  Summer  a serener blue  With golden light irradiate wide invests  The happy world Attemper'd suns arise  Sweetbeam'd and shedding oft thro' lucid clouds  A pleasing calm while broad and brown below  Unbounded harvests hang the heavy head  Rich silent deep they stand for not a gale  Rolls its light billows o'er the bending plain  A calm of plenty till the ruffled air  Falls from its poise and gives the breeze to blow  Rent is the fleecy mantle of the sky  The clouds fly different and the sudden sun  By fits effulgent gilds th' illumin'd field  And black by fits the shadows sweep along  A gayly checker'd wideextended view  Far as the circling eye can shoot around  Convolv'd and tossing in a flood of corn  These are thy blessings  Industry  rough Power  Whom Labour still attends and Sweat and Pain  Yet the kind source of every gentle art  And all the soft civility of life  Raiser of human kind by  Nature  cast  Naked and helpless out amid the woods  And wilds to rude inclement elements  With various powers of deep efficiency  Implanted and profusely pour'd around  Materials infinite but idle all  Still unexerted in th' unconscious breast  Slept the lethargic powers Corruption still  Voracious swallow'd what the liberal hand  Of  Bounty  scatter'd o'er the savage year  And still the sad barbarian roving mix'd  With beasts of prey or for his acronmeal  Fought the fierce tusky boar a shivering wretch  Aghast and comfortless when the red north  With winter charg'd let the mixt tempest fly  Hail rain and snow and bitterbreathing frost  Then to the shelter of the hut he fled  And the wild season sordid pin'd away  For home he had not home is the resort  Of love of joy of peace and plenty where  Supporting and supported polish'd friends  And dear relations mingle into bliss  But this the rugged savage never felt  Even desolate in crouds and thus his days  Roll'd heavy dark and unenjoy'd along  A waste of time till  Industry  approach'd  And rous'd him from his miserable sloth  His faculties unfolded pointed out  Where lavish  Nature  the directing hand  Of  Art  demanded shew'd him how to raise  His feeble force by the mechanic powers  To dig the mineral from the vaulted earth  On what to turn the piercing rage of fire  On what the torrent and the gather'd blast  Gave the tall antient forest to his ax  Taught him to chip the wood and hew the stone  Till by degrees the finish'd fabric rose  Tore from his limbs the bloodpolluted fur  And wrapt them in the woolly vestment warm  Or bright in glossy silk and flowing lawn  With wholesome viands fill'd his table pour'd  The generous glass around inspir'd to wake  The liferefining soul of decent wit  Nor stopp'd at barren bare necessity  But still advancing bolder led him on  By hardy patience and experience slow  To pomp to pleasure elegance and grace  And breathing high ambition thro' his soul  Set science wisdom glory in his view  And bad him be the  Lord  of all below  Then gathering men their natural powers combin'd  And form'd a  Public  to the general good  Submitting aiming and conducting all  For this the  PatriotCouncil  met the full  The free and fairly represented  Whole    For this devis'd the holy guardian laws  Distinguish'd orders animated Arts  And with joint force  Oppression  chaining set  Imperial Justice  at the helm yet still  To them accountable nor slavish dream'd  That toiling millions must resign their weal  And all the honey of their search to such  As for themselves alone themselves have rais'd  Hence every form of cultivated life  In order set protected and inspir'd  Into perfection wrought Uniting all  Society grew numerous high polite  And happy Nurse of art the city rose  And stretching street on street by thousands led  From twining woody haunts and the tough yew  To bows strongstraining her aspiring sons  'Twas nought but labour the whole dusky groupe  Of clustering houses and of mingling men  Restless design and execution strong  In every street the sounding hammer ply'd  His massy task while the corrosive file  In flying touches form'd the fine machine  Then  Commerce  brought into the public walk  The busy Merchant the big warehouse built  Rais'd the strong crane choak'd up the loaded street  With foreign plenty and on thee thou  Thames    Large gentle deep majestic king of floods  Than whom no river heaves a fuller tide  Seiz'd for his grand resort On either hand  Like a long wintry forest groves of masts  Shot up their spires the bellying sheet between  Possess'd the breezy void the sooty hulk  Steer'd sluggish on the splendid barge along  Row'd regular to harmony around  The boat lightskimming stretch'd its oary wings  While deep the various voice of fervent toil  From bank to bank increas'd whence ribb'd with oak  To bear the  British  thunder black and bold  The roaring vessel rush'd into the main  Then too the pillar'd dome magnific heav'd  His ample roof and  Luxury  within  Pour'd out her glittering stores The canvas smooth  With glowing life protuberant to the view  Embodied rose The statue seem'd to breathe  And soften into flesh beneath the touch  Of forming art imaginationflush'd  All is the gift of  Industry  whate'er  Exalts embellishes and renders life  Delightful Pensive  Winter  chear'd by him  Sits at the social fire and happy hears  Th' excluded tempest idly rave along  His harden'd fingers deck the gaudy  Spring  Without him  Summer  were an arid waste  Nor to th'  autumnal  months could thus transmit  These full mature immeasurable stores  That waving round recal my wandering song  Soon as the morning trembles o'er the sky  And unperceiv'd unfolds the spreading day  Before the ripen'd field the reapers stand  In fair array each by the lass he loves  To bear the rougher part and mitigate  By nameless gentle offices her toil  At once they stoop and swell the lusty sheaves  While bandied round and round the rural talk  The rural scandal and the rural jest  Fly hearty to deceive the tedious time  And chearly steal the sultry hours away  Behind the master walks builds up the shocks  And conscious glancing oft this way and that  His sated eye feels his heart heave with joy  The gleaners spread around and here and there  Spike after spike their sparing harvest pick  Be not too narrow husbandmen but fling  From the full sheaf with charitable stealth  The liberal handful Think oh grateful think  How good the  God  of harvest is to you  Who pours abundance o'er your flowing fields  While these unhappy partners of your kind  Widehover round you like the fowls of heaven  And ask their humble dole The various turns  Of fortune ponder that your sons may want  What now with hard reluctance faint ye give  The lovely young  Lavinia  once had friends  And fortune smil'd deceitful on her birth  For in her helpless years depriv'd of all  Of every stay save innocence and  Heaven    She with her widow'd mother feeble old  And poor liv'd in a cottage lost far up  Amid the windings of a woody vale  Safe from the cruel blasting arts of man  Almost on  Nature  's common bounty fed  Like the gay birds that sung them to repose  Content and careless of tomorrow's fare  Her form was fresher than the morningrose  When the dew wets its leaves unstain'd and pure  As is the lilly or the mountain snow  The modest virtues mingled in her eyes  Still on the ground deject and darting all  Their humid beams into the blooming flowers  Or when the stories that her mother told  Of what her faithless fortune flatter'd once  Thrill'd in her thought they like the dewy star  Of evening shone in tears A native grace  Sat fairproportion'd on her polish'd limbs  Veil'd in a simple robe for loveliness  Needs not the foreign aid of ornament  But is when unadorn'd adorn'd the most  Thoughtless of beauty she was beauty's self  Recluse among the woods if citydames  Will deign their faith And thus she went compell'd  By strong necessity with as serene  And pleas'd a look as patience can put on  To glean  Palaemon  's fields The pride of swains  Palaemon  was the generous and the rich  Who led the rural life in all its joy  And elegance such as  Arcadian  song  Transmits from antient incorrupted times  When tyrant custom had not shackled man  And free to follow nature was the mode  He then his fancy with autumnal scenes  Amusing chanc'd beside his reapertrain  To walk when poor  Lavinia  drew his eye  Unconscious of her power and turning quick  With unaffected blushes from his gaze  He saw her charming but he saw not half  The charms her downcast modesty conceal'd  That very moment love and chast desire  Sprung in his bosom to himself unknown  For still the world prevail'd and its dread laugh  Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn  Should his heart own a gleaner in the field  And thus in secret to his soul he sigh'd  What pity that so delicate a form  By beauty kindled and harmonious shap'd  Where sense sincere and goodness seem'd to dwell  Should be devoted to the rude embrace  Of some indecent clown She looks methinks  Of old  Acasto  's line and to my mind  Recalls that patron of my happy life  From whom my liberal fortune took its rise  Now to the dust gone down his houses lands  And once fairspreading family dissolv'd  I've heard that in some waste obscure retreat  Urg'd by remembrance sad and decent pride  Far from those scenes which knew their better days  His aged widow and his daughter live  Whom yet my fruitless search could never find  Romantic wish would this the daughter were  When strict enquiring from herself he found  She was the same the daughter of his friend  The bountiful  Acasto  who can speak  The mingling passion that surpriz'd his heart  And thro' his nerves in shivering transport ran  Then blaz'd his smother'd flame avowed and bold  And as he run her ardent o'er and o'er  Love gratitude and pity wept at once  Confus'd and frighten'd at his sudden tears  Her rising beauties flush'd a higher bloom  As thus  Paleemon  passionate and just  Pour'd out the pious rapture of his soul  And art thou then  Acasto  's dear remains  She whom my restless gratitude has sought  So long in vain Oh yes the very same  The soften'd image of my noble friend  Alive his every feature every look  More elegantly touch'd Fairer than spring  Thou sole surviving blossom from the root  That nourish'd up my fortune say ah where  In what unsmiling desart hast thou drawn  The kindest aspect of delighted heaven  Into such beauty spread and blown so white  Tho' poverty's cold wind and crashing rain  Beat keen and heavy on thy tender years  O let me now into a richer soil  Transplant thee safe where vernal suns and showers  Diffuse their warmest largest influence  And of my garden be the pride and joy  It ill befits thee oh it ill befits  Acasto  's daughter his whose open stores  Tho' vast were little to his ampler heart  The father of a country thus to pick  The very refuse of those harvestfields  His bounty taught to gain and right enjoy  Then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand  But ill apply'd to such a rugged task  With harvest shining all these fields are thine  And if my wishes may presume so far  Their master too who then indeed were blest  To make the daughter of  Acasto  so  Here ceas'd the youth yet still his speaking eye  Express'd the sacred triumph of his soul  With conscious virtue gratitude and love  Above the vulgar joy divinely rais'd  Nor waited he reply Won by the charm  Of goodness irresistible and all  In sweet disorder lost she blush'd consent  The news immediate to her mother brought  While pierc'd with anxious thought she pin'd away  The lonely moments for  Lavinia  's fate  Amaz'd and scarce believing what she heard  Joy seiz'd her wither'd veins and one bright gleam  Of setting life shone on her eveninghours  Not less enraptur'd than the happy pair  Who flourish'd long in mutual bliss and rear'd  A numerous offspring lovely like themselves  And good the grace of all the country round  Defeating oft the labours of the year  The sultry south collects a potent blast  At first the groves are scarcely seen to stir  Their trembling tops and a still murmur runs  Along the softinclining fields of corn  But as th' aereal tempest fuller swells  And in one mighty stream invisible  Immense the whole excited atmosphere  Impetuous rushes o'er the sounding world  Strain'd to the root the stooping forest pours  A rustling shower of yet untimely leaves  Highbeat the circling mountains eddy in  From the bare wild the dissipated storm  And send it in a torrent down the vale  Expos'd and naked to its utmost rage  Thro' all the sea of harvest rolling round  The billowy plain boils wide nor can evade  Tho' plyant to the blast its seizing force  Or whirl'd in air or into vacant chaff  Shook waste And sometimes too a burst of rain  Swept from the black horizon broad descends  In one continuous flood Still over head  The glomerating tempest grows and still  The deluge deepens till the fields around  Ly sunk and flatted in the sordid wave  Sudden the ditches swell the meadows swim  Red from the hills innumerable streams  Tumultuous roar and high above its banks  The river lift before whose weighty rush  Herds flocks and harvests cottages and swains  Roll mingled down all that the winds had spar'd  In one wild moment ruin'd the big hopes  And wellearn'd treasures of the painful year  Fled to some eminence the husbandman  Helpless beholds the miserable wreck  Driving along his drowning ox at once  Descending with his labours scatter'd round  He sees and instant o'er his shivering thought  Comes winter unprovided and a train  Of clamant children dear Ye masters then  Be mindful of the rough laborious hand  That sinks you soft in elegance and ease  Be mindful of those limbs in russet clad  Whose toil to yours is warmth and graceful pride  And oh be mindful of that sparing board  Which covers yours with luxury profuse  Makes your glass sparkle and your sense rejoice  Nor cruelly demand what the deep rains  And allinvolving winds have swept away  Here the rude clamour of the sportsman's joy  The gun thickthundering and the winded horn  Would tempt the muse to ling the  rural game  How in his midcareer the spaniel struck  Stiff by the tainted gale with open nose  Outstretch'd and finely sensible draws full  Fearful and cautious on the latent prey  As in the sun the circling covey bask  Their varied plumes watchful and every way  Thro' the rough stubble turn'd the secret eye  Caught in the meshy snare in vain they beat  Their useless wings intangled more and more  Nor on the surges of the boundless air  Tho' borne triumphant are they safe the gun  Glanc'd just and sudden from the fowler's eye  O'ertakes their sounding pinions and again  Immediate brings them from the towering wing  Dead to the ground or drives them else disperst  Wounded and wheeling various down the wind  These are not subjects for the peaceful muse  Nor will she stain her spotless theme with such Then most delighted when she smiling sees  The whole mix'd animal creation round  Alive and happy 'Tis not joy to her  This falsely chearful barbarous game of death  This rage of pleasure which the restless youth  Awakes impatient with the gleaming morn  When beasts of prey retire that all night long  Urg'd by necessity had roam'd the dark  As if their conscious ravage shun'd the light  Asham'd Not so the steady tyrant man  Who with the thoughtless insolence of power  Inflam'd beyond the most infuriate rage  Of the worst monster that e'er howl'd the waste  For sport alone takes up the cruel tract  Amid the beamings of the gentle days  Upbraid us not ye wolves ye tygers fell  For hunger kindles you and lawless want  But lavish fed in Nature's bounty roll'd  To laugh at anguish and rejoice in blood  Is what your horrid bosoms never knew  Poor is the triumph o'er the timid Hare  Shook from the corn and now to some lone seat  Retir'd the rushy fen the ragged furz  Stretch'd o'er the stony heath the stubble chapt  The thistly lawn the thick intangled broom  Of the same friendly hue the wither'd fern  The fallow ground laid open to the sun  Concoctive and the nodding sandy bank  Hung o'er the mazes of the mountainbrook  Vain is her best precaution tho' she sits  By Nature rais'd to take the horizon in  And head couch'd close betwixt her hairy feet  In act to spring away The scented dew  Betrays her early labyrinth and deep  In scatter'd sullen openings far behind  With every breeze she hears the coming storm  But nearer and more frequent as it loads  The sighing gale she springs amaz'd and all  The savage soul of game is up at once  The pack fullopening varions the shrill horn  Resounded from the hills the neighing steed  Wild for the chace and the loud hunter's shout  O'er a weak harmless flying creature all  Mix'd in mad tumult and discordant joy  The Stag too singled from the herd where long  He rang'd the branching monarch of the shades  Before the tempest drives At first in speed  He sprightly puts his faith and feararous'd  Gives all his swift aereal soul to flight  Against the breeze he darts that way the more  To leave the lessening murderous cry behind  Deception short tho' fleeter than the winds  Blown o'er the keenair'd mountain by the north  He bursts the thickets glances thro' the glades  And plunges deep into the wildest wood  If slow yet sure adhesive to the tract  Hotsteaming up behind him comes again  Th' inhuman rout and from the shady depth  Expel him circling thro' his every shift  He sweeps the forest oft and sobbing sees  The glades mildopening to the golden day  Where in kind contest with his butting friends  He went to struggle or his loves enjoy  Oft in the fulldescending flood he tries  To lose the scent and lave his burning sides  Oft seeks the herd the watchful herd alarm'd  With quick consent avoid th' infectious maze  What shall he do His once so vivid nerves  So full of buoyant soul inspire no more  The fainting course but wrenching breathless toil  Sick seizes on his heart he stands at bay  And puts his last weak refuge in despair  The big round tears run down his dappled face  He groans in anguish while the growling pack  Bloodhappy hang at his fair jutting chest  And mark his beauteous checquer'd sides with gore  Of this enough But if the silvan youth  Whose fervent blood boils into violence  Must have the chace behold despising flight  The rous'dup lyon resolute and slow  Advancing full on the protended spear  And cowardband that circling wheel aloof  Slunk from the cavern and the troubled wood  See the grim wolf on him his shaggy foe  Viudictive fix for murder is his trade  And growling horrid as the brindled boar  Grins near destruction to the monster's heart  Let the dart lighten from the nervous arm  These  Britain  Knows not give ye  Britons  then  Your sportive fury pityless to pour  Loose on the sly destroyer of the flock  Him from his craggy winding haunts unearth'd  Let all the thunder of the chace pursue  Throw the broad ditch behind you o'er the hedge  Highbound resistless nor the deep morass  Refuse but thro' the shaking wilderness  Pick your nice way into the perilous flood  Bear fearless of the raging instinct full  And as you ride the torrent to the banks  Your triumph sound sonorous running round  From rock to rock in circling echo tost  Then snatch the mountains by their woody tops  Rush down the dangerous steep and o'er the lawn  In fancy swallowing up the space between  Pour all your speed into the rapid game  For happy he who tops the wheeling chace  Has every maze evolv'd and every guile  Disclos'd who knows the merits of the pack  Who saw the villain seiz'd and dying hard  Without complaint tho' by an hundred mouths  At once tore mercyless Thrice happy he  At hour of dusk while the retreating horn  Calls them to ghostly halls of grey renown  With woodland honours grac'd the fox's fur  Depending decent from the roof and spread  Round the drear walls with antick figures fierce  The stag's large front he then is loudest heard  When the night staggers with severer toils  And their repeated wonders shake the dome  But first the fuel'd chimney blazes wide  The tankards foam and the strong table groans  Beneath the smoaking sirloin stretch'd immense  From side to side on which with fell intent  They deep incision make and talk the while  Of  England  's glory ne'er to be defac'd  While hence they borrow vigour or amain  Into the pasty plung'd at intervals  If stomach keen can intervals allow  Relating how it ran and how it fell  Then sated Hunger bids his brother Thirst  Produce the mighty bowl the mighty bowl  Swell'd high with fiery juice steams liberal round  A potent gale reviving as the breath  Of  Maia  to the lovesick shepherdess  On violets diffus'd while soft she hears  Her panting shepherd stealing to her arms  Nor wanting is the brown october drawn  Mature and perfect from his dark retreat  Of thirty years and now his honest front  Flames in the light refulgent nor asham'd  To vie it with the vineyard's best produce  Perhaps a while amusive thoughtful Whisk  Walks gentle round beneath a cloud of smoak  Wreath'd fragrant from the pipe or the quick dice  In thunder leaping from the box awake  The sounding gammon while romploving miss  Is haul'd about in gallantry robust  At last these puling idlenesses laid  Aside frequent and full the dry divan  Close in firm circle and set ardent in  For serious drinking Nor evasion sly  Nor sober shift is to the puking wretch  Indulg'd askew but earnest brimming bowls  Lave every soul the table floating round  And pavement faithless to the fuddled foot  Thus as they swim in mutual swill the talk  Vociferate at once by twenty tongues  Reels fast from theme to theme from horses hounds  To church or mistress politicks or ghost  In endless mazes intricate perplext  Meantime with sudden interruption loud  Th' impatient catch bursts from the joyous heart  That moment touch'd is every kindred soul  And opening in a fullmouth'd  Cry  of joy  The laugh the slap the jocund curse goes round  While from their slumbers shook the kennel'd hounds  Mix in the music of the day again  As when the tempest that has vex'd the deep  The dark night long falls murmuring towards morn  So their mirth gradual sinks Their feeble tongues  Unable to take up the cumbrous word  Ly quite disslov'd Before their maudlin eyes  Seen dim and blue the double tapers dance  Like the sun wading thro' the misty sky  Then sliding sweet they drop O'erturn'd above  Lies the wet broken scene and stretch'd below  Each way the drunken slaughter where astride  The lubber Power himself triumphant sits  Slumbrous inclining still from side to side  And steeps them silent all in sleep till morn  But if the rougher sex by this red sport  Are hurry'd wild let not such horrid joy  E'er stain the bosom of the  British Fair  Far be the spirit of the chace from them  Uncomely courage unbeseeming skill  To spring the fence to rein the prancing steed  The cap the whip the masculine attire  In which they roughen to the sense and all  The winning softness of their sex is lost  Made up of blushes tenderness and fears  In them 'tis graceful to dissolve at woe  With every motion every word to wave  Quick o'er the kindling cheek the ready blush  And from the smallest violence to shrink  Unequal then the loveliest in their fears  And by this silent adulation soft  To their protection more engaging man  O may their eyes no miserable sight  Save weeping lovers see a nobler game  Thro' love's enchanting wiles pursu'd yet fled  In chace ambiguous May their tender limbs  Float in the loose simplicity of dress  And fashion'd all to harmony alone  Know they to seize the captivated soul  In rapture warbled from the radiant lip  To teach the lute to languish with smooth step  Disclosing motion in its every charm  To swim along and swell the mazy dance  To train the foliage o'er the snowy lawn  To play the pencil turn th' instructive page  To give new flavour to the fruitful year  And heighten Nature's dainties in their race  To rear their graces into second life  To give society its highest taste  Wellorder'd home man's best delight to make  And by submissive wisdom modest skill  With every kinder careelusive art  To raise the glory animate the joys  And sweeten all the toils of human life  This be the female dignity and praise  Ye swains now hasten to the hazelbank  Where down yon dale the wildlywinding brook  Falls hoarse from steep to steep In close array  Fit for the thickets and the tangling shrub  Ye virgins come For you their latest song  The woodlands raise the cluster'd nut for you  The lover finds amid the secret shade  Or where they burnish on the topmost bough  With active vigour crushes down the tree  Or shakes them ripe from the resigning husk  A glossy shower and of an ardent brown  As are the ringlets of  Melinda  's hair  Melinda  form'd with every grace compleat  Yet these neglecting above beauty wise  And far transcending such a vulgar praise  Hence from the busy joyresounding fields  In cheerful error let us tread the maze  Of  Autumn  unconfin'd and vital taste  The breath of orchard big with bending fruit  Obedient to the breeze and beating ray  From the deeploaded bough a mellow shower  Incessant melts away The juicy pear  Lies in a soft profusion scatter'd round  A various sweetness swells the gentle race  In species different but in kind the same  By  Nature  's allrefining hand prepar'd  Of temper'd sun and water earth and air  In everchanging composition mixt  So fares it with those wideprojected heaps  Of apples which the lustyhanded year  Innumerous o'er the blushing orchard shakes  A various spirit fresh delicious keen  Dwells in their gelid pores and active points  The piercing cyder for the thirsty tongue  Thy native theme and boon inspirer too  Phillips  facetious bard the second thou  Who nobly durst in rhymeunfetter'd verse  With  British  freedom sing the  British  song  How from  Silurian  vats highsparkling wines  Foam in transparent floods some strong to cheer  The wintry revels of the labouring hind  And tasteful some to cool the summerhours  In this glad season while his last best beams  The sun sheds equal o'er the meeken'd day  Oh lose me in the green majestic walks  Of  Dodington  thy seat serene and plain  Where simple Nature reigns and every view  Diffusive spreads the pure  Dorsetian  downs  In boundless prospect yonder shagg'd with wood  Here rich with harvest and there white with flocks  Mean time the grandeur of thy lofty dome  Farsplendid seizes on the ravish'd eye  New beauties rise with each revolving day  New columns swell and still the fresh spring finds  New plants to quicken and new groves to green  Full of thy genius all the muses seat  Where in the secret bower and winding walk  They twine the bay for thee Here oft alone  Fir'd by the thirst of thy applause I court  Th' inspiring breeze and meditate the book  Of  Nature  everopen aiming thence  Hearttaught like thine to learn the moral song  And as I steal along the sunny wall  Where  Autumn  basks with fruit empurpled deep  My theme still urges in my vagrant thought  Presents the downy peach the purple plumb  With a fine blueish mist of animals  Clouded the ruddy nectarine and dark  Beneath his ample leaf the luscious fig  The vine too here her curling tendrils shoots  Hangs out her clusters swelling to the south  And scarcely wishes for a warmer sky  Turn we a moment  Fancy  's rapid flight  To vigorous soils and climes of fair extent  Where by the potent sun elated high  The vineyard heaves refulgent on the day  Spreads o'er the vale or up the mountain climbs  Profuse and drinks amid the sunny rocks  From cliff to cliff encreas'd the heighten'd blaze  Low bend the gravid boughs The clusters clear  Half thro' the foliage seen or ardent flame  Or shine transparent while perfection breathes  White o'er the turgent film the living dew  As thus they brighten with exalted juice  Touch'd into flavour by the mingling ray  The rural youth and virgins o'er the field  Each fond for each to cull th' autumnal prime  Exulting rove and speak the vintage nigh  Then comes the crushing swain the country floats  And foams unbounded with the mashy flood  That by degrees fermented and refin'd  Round the rais'd nations pours the cup of joy  The Claret smooth deep as the lip we press  In sparkling fancy while we drain the bowl  The mellowtasted Burgundy and quick  As is the wit it gives the bright Champaign  Now by the cool declining year condens'd  Descend the copious exhalations check'd  As up the middle sky unseen they stole  And roll the doubling sogs around the hill  No more the mountain horrid vast sublime  Who pours a sweep of rivers from his sides  And deep betwixt contending kingdoms lays  The rocky long division while aloft  His piny top is lessening lost in air  No more his thousand prospects fill the view  With great variety but in a night  Of gathering vapour from the bassled sense  Sink dark and total Nor alone immerst  The huge dusk gradual swallows up the plain  Vanish the woods The dimseen river seems  Sullen and slow to rowl the misty wave  Even in the height of noon opprest the sun  Sheds weak and blunt his widerefracted ray  Whence glaring oft with many a broaden'd orb  He frights the nations Indistinct on earth  Seen thro' the turbid air beyond the life  Objects appear and wilder'd o'er the waste  The shepherd stalks gigantick Till at last  Wreath'd close around in deeper circles still  Successive floating sits the general fog  Unbounded o'er the world and mingling thick  A formless grey confusion covers all  As when of old so sung the  hebrew  bard  Light uncollected thro' the Chaos urg'd  Its infant way nor Order yet had drawn  His endless train forth from the dubious gloom  These roving mists that constant now begin  To smoak along the hilly country these  With mighty rains the skill'd in nature say  The mountaincisterns fill those grand reserves  Of water scoop'd among the hollow rocks  Whence gush the streams the ceaseless fountains play  And their unfailing stores the rivers draw  But is this equal to the vast effect  Is thus the  Volga  fill'd the rapid  Rhine  The broad  Euphrates  all th' unnumber'd floods  That large refresh the fairdivided earth  And in the rage of summer never cease  To send a thundering torrent to the main  What tho' the sun draws from the steaming deep  More than the rivers pour How much again  O'er the vext surge in bitterdriving showers  Frequent returns let the wet sailor say  And on the thirsty down far from the burst  Of springs how much to their reviving fields  And feeding flocks let lonely shepherds sing  But sure 'tis no weak variable cause  That keeps at once ten thousand thousand floods  Widewandering o'er the world so fresh and clear  For ever flowing and for ever full  And thus some sages deepexploring teach  That where the hoarse innumerable wave  Eternal lashes the refounding shore  Suck'd thro' the sandy  Stratum  every way  The waters with the sandy  Stratum  rise  Amid whole angles infinitely strain'd  They leave each saline particle behind  And clear and sweeten as they soak along  Nor stops the restless fluid mounting still  Tho' here and there in lowly plains it springs  But to the mountain courted by the sand  That leads it darkling on in faithful maze  Far from the parentmain it boils again  Fresh into day and all the glittering hill  Is bright with spouting rills The vital stream  Hence in its subterranean passage gains  From the wash'd mineral that restoring power  And salutary virtue which anew  Strings every nerve calls up the kindling soul  Into the healthful cheek and joyous eye  And whence the royal maid  Amelia  blooms  With newflush'd graces yet reserv'd to bless  Beyond a crown some happy prince and shine  In all her mother's matchless virtues drest  The  Carolina  of another land  While  Autumn  scatters his departing gleams  Warn'd of approaching winter gather'd play  The swallowpeople and tost wide around  O'er the calm sky in convolution swift  The feather'd eddy floats Rejoycing once  E're to their wintry slumbers they retire  In clusters clung beneath the mouldering bank  And where the cavern sweats as sages dream  Or rather into warmer climes convey'd  With other kindred birds of season there  They twitter cheerful till the vernal months  Invite them welcome back for thronging now Innumerous wings are in commotion all  Where the  Rhine  loses his majestic force  In  Belgian  plains won from the raging deep  By diligence amazing and the strong  Unconquerable hand of  Liberty    The storkassembly meets for many a day  Consulting deep and various e're they take  Their plumy voyage thro' the liquid sky  And now their rout design'd their leaders chose  Their tribes adjusted clean'd their vigorous wings  And many a circle many a short essay  Wheel'd round and round in congregation full  The figur'd flight ascends and riding high  Th' aerial billows mixes with the clouds  Or where the  Northern  ocean in vast whirls  Boils round the naked melancholy isles  Of farthest  Thule  and th'  Atlantic  surge  Pours in among the stormy  Hebrides    Who can recount what transmigrations there  Are annual made What nations come and go  And how the living clouds on clouds arise  Infinite wings till all the plumedark air  And white resounding store are one wild cry  Here the plain harmless native his small flock  And herd diminutive of many hues  Tends on the little island's verdant swell  The shepherd's seagirt reign or to the rocks  Direclinging gathers his ovarious food  Or sweeps the fishy shore or treasures up  The plumage riling full to form the bed  Of luxury And here a while the muse  Highhovering o'er the broad cerulean scene  Sees  Caledonia  in romantic view  Her airy mountains from the gelid main  Invested with a keen diffusive sky  Breathing the soul acute her forests huge  Incult robust and tall by  Nature  's hand  Planted of old her azure lakes between  Pour'd out extensive and of watry wealth  Full winding deep and green her fertile vales  With many a cool translucent brimming flood  Wash'd lovely from the  Tweed  pure parentstream  To where the northinflated tempest foams  O'er  Orca  or  Betubium  's highest peak  Nurse of a people in misfortune's school  Train'd up to hardy deeds soon visited  By  Learnings  when before the  Gothic  rage  She took her western flight A generous race  Of unsubmitting spirit wise and brave  Who still thro' bleeding ages struggled hard  To hold a hapless undiminish'd state  Too much in vain Hence of ignoble bounds  Impatient and by tempting glory borne  O'er every land for every land their life  Has flow'd profuse their piercing genius plan'd  And swell'd the pomp of peace their faithful toil  As from their own clear north in radiant streams  Bright over  Europe  bursts the  Boreal Morn  Oh is there not some patriot in whose power  That best that godlike luxury is plac'd  Of blessing thousands thousands yet unborn  Thro' late posterity some large of soul  To cheer dejected industry to give  A double harvest to the pining swain  And teach the labouring hand the sweets of toil  How by the finest art the native robe  To weave how white as hyperborean snow  To form the lucid lawn with venturous oar  How to dash wide the billow nor look on  Shamefully passive while  Batavian  fleets  Defraud us of the glittering finny swarms  That heave our friths and croud upon our shores  How allenlivening trade to rouse and wing  The prosperous sail from every growing port  Unchalleng'd round the seaincircled globe  And thus united  Britain Britain  make  Intire th' imperial  Mistress  of the deep  Yes there are such And full on thee  Argyle    Her hope her stay her darling and her boast  From her first patriots and her heroes sprung  Thy fond imploring country turns her eye  In thee with all a mother's triumph sees  Her every virtue every grace combin'd  Her genius wisdom her politest turn  Her pride of honour and her courage try'd  Calm and intrepid in the very throat  Of sulphurous war on  Tenier  's dreadful field  While thick around the deadly tempest flew  And when the trumpet kindling war no more  Pours not the flaming squadrons o'er the field  But fruitful of fair deeds and mutual faith  Kind peace unites the jarring world again  Let the deep olive thro' thy laurels twine  For powerful as thy sword from thy rich tongue  Persuasion flows and wins the high debate  While mix'd in thee combine the charm of youth  The force of manhood and the depth of age  Thee  Forbes  too whom every worth attends  As Truth sincere as weeping Friendship kind  Thee truly generous and in silence great  Thy country feels thro' her reviving arts  Plan'd by thy wisdom by thy soul inform'd  And seldom has she felt the friend like thee  But see the fading manycolour'd woods  Shade deepening over shade the country round  Imbrown a crowded umbrage dusk and dun  Of every hue from wan declining green  To sooty dark These now the lonesome muse  Lowwhispering lead into their leafstrown walks  And give the  Season  in its latest view  Meantime lightshadowing all a sober calm  Fleeces unbounded ether whose least wave  Stands tremulous uncertain where to turn  The gentle current while illumin'd wide  The dewyskirted clouds imbibe the sun  And thro' their uvid pores his temper'd force  Shed o'er the peaceful world Then is the time  For those whom Wisdom and whom Nature charm  To steal themselves from the degenerate crowd  And soar above this little scene of things  To tread lowthoughted vice beneath their feet  To sooth the throbbing passions into peace  And woo lone  Quiet  in her silent walks  Thus solitary and in pensive guise  Oft let me wander o'er the russet mead  And thro' the sadden'd grove where scarce is heard  One dying strain to cheer the woodman's toil  Haply some widow'd songster pours his plaint  Far in saint warblings thro' the tawny copse  While congregated thrushes linnets larks  And each wild throat whose artless strains so late  Swell'd all the music of the swarming shades  Robb'd of their tuneful souls now shivering sit  On the dead tree a dull despondent flock  With not a brightness waving o'er their plumes  And nought save chattering discord in their note  O let not aim'd from some inhuman eye  The gun the music of the coming year  Destroy and harmless unsuspecting harm  Lay the weak tribes a miserable prey  In mingled murder fluttering on the ground  The pale descending year yet pleasing still  A gentler mood inspires for now the leaf  Incessant rustles from the mournful grove  Oft starting such as studious walk below  And slowly circles thro' the waving air  But should a quicker breeze and the boughs  Sob o'er the sky the leafy rain streams  Till choak'd and matted with the dreary shower  The forestwalks at every rising gale  Roll wide the wither'd waste and whistle bleak  Fled is the blasted verdure of the fields  And shrunk into their beds the flowery race  Their sunny robes resign Even what remain'd  Of bolder fruits falls from the naked tree  And woods fields gardens orchards all around  The desolated prospect thrills the soul  He comes he comes in every breeze the  Power  Of  philosophic Melancholy  comes  His near approach the suddenstarting tear  The glowing cheek the mild dejected air  The soften'd feature and the beating heart  Pierc'd deep with many a secret pang declare  O'er all his soul his sacred influence breathes  In all the bosom triumphs all the nerves  Inflames imagination thro' the sense  Infuses every tenderness and far  Beyond dim earth exalts the swelling thought  Ten thousand thousand fleet ideas such  As never mingled with the Vulgar's dream  Croud fast into the mind's creative eye  As fast the correspondent passions rise  As varied and as high devotion rais'd  To rapture and divine astonishment  The love of Nature unconfin'd and chief  Of human kind the large ambitious wish  To make them blest the sigh for suffering worth  Lost in obscurity th' indignant scorn  Of mighty pride the fearless great resolve  The wonder that the dying patriot draws  Inspiring glory thro' remotest time  Th' arousing pant for virtue and for fame  The sympathies of love and friendship dear  With all the social offspring of the heart  Oh bear me then to vast embowering shades  To twilight groves and visionary vales  To weeping grottoes and prophetic glooms  Where angelforms athwart the solemn dusk  Tremendous sweep or seem to sweep along  And voices more than human thro' the void  Deepsounding seize th' enthusiastic ear  And now the western sun withdraws the day  And humid evening gilding o'er the sky  In her chill progress to the ground condens'd  Th' ascending vapour throws Where waters ooze  Where marshes stagnate and where rivers wind  Cluster the rolling fogs and swim along  The duskymantled lawn Meanwhile the moon  Fullorb'd and breaking thro' the scatter'd clouds  Shews her broad visage in the crimson'd east  Turn'd to the sun direct her spotted disk  Where mountains rise umbrageous dales descend  And oceans roll as optic tube descries  A lesser earth gives all his blaze again  Void of its flame and sheds a softer day  Now thro' the passing cloud she seems to stoop  Now up the pure cerulean rides sublime  Wide the pale deluge floats and streaming mild  O'er the sky'd mountain to the shadowy vale  While rocks and floods reflect the quivering gleam  The whole air whitens with a boundless tide  Of silver radiance trembling round the world  But when halfblotted from the sky her light  Fainting permits the starry fires to burn  With keener lustre thro' the depth of heaven  Or quite extinct her deaden'd orb appears  And scarce appears of sickly beamless white  Oft in this season silent from the north  A blaze of meteors shoots ensweeping first  The lower skies then all at once converge  High to the crown of heaven and all at once  Relapsing quick as quickly reascend  And mix and thwart extinguish and renew  All ether coursing in a maze of light  From look to look contagious thro' the crowd  The  Pannic  runs and into wondrous shapes  Th' appearance throws armies in meet array  Throng with aerial spears and steeds of fire  Till the long lines of fullextended war  In bleeding fight commixt the sanguine flood  Rowls a broad slaughter o'er the plains of heaven  As thus they scan the visionary scene  On all sides swells the superstitious din  Incontinent and busy frenzy talks  Of blood and battle cities overturn'd  And late at night in swallowing earthquake sunk  Or painted hideous with ascending flame  Of sallow famine inundation storm  Of pestilence and every great distress  Empires subvers'd when ruling fate has struck  Th' unalterable hour even Nature's self  Is deem'd to totter on the brink of time  Not so the man of philosophic eye  And inspect sage the waving brightness he  Curious surveys inquisitive to know  The causes and materials yet unfix'd  Of this appearance beautiful and new  Now black and deep the night begins to fall  A solid shade immense Sunk in the gloom  Magnificent and vast are heaven and earth  Order confounded lies all beauty void  Distinction lost and gay variety  One universal blot such the fair power  Of Light to kindle and create the whole  Drear is the state of the benighted wretch  Who then bewilder'd wanders thro' the dark  Full of pale fancies and chimeras huge  Nor visited by one directive ray  From cottage streaming or from airy hall  Perhaps impatient as he stumbles on  Struck from the root of slimy ruses blue  The wildfire scatters round or gathertd trails  A length of flame deceitful o'er the moss  Whither decoy'd by the fantastic blaze  Now sunk and now renew'd he's quite absorpt  Rider and horse into the miry gulph  While still from day to day his pining wife  And plaintive children his return await  In wild conjecture lost At other times  Sent by the better Genius of the night  Innoxious gleaming on the horse's mane  The meteor sits and shews the narrow path  That winding leads thro' pits of death or else  Instructs him how to take the dangerous ford  The lengthen'd night elaps'd the morning shines  Serene in all her dewy beauty bright  Unfolding fair the last  Autumnal  day  And now the mounting sun dispels the fog  The rigid hoarfrost melts before his beam  And hung on every spray on every blade  Of grass the myriad dewdrops twinkle round  Ah see where robb'd and murder'd in that pit  Lies the still heaving hive at evening snatch'd  Beneath the cloud of guiltconcealing night  And whelm'd o'er sulphur while undreaming ill  The happy people in their waxen cells  Sat tending publick cares and planning schemes  Of temperance for winter poor rejoic'd  To mark fullflowing round their copious stores  Sudden the dark oppressive steam ascends  And us'd to milder scents the tender race  By thousands tumble from their honey'd domes  Convolv'd and agonizing in the dust  And was it then for this ye roam'd the spring  Intent from flower to flower for this ye toil'd  Ceaseless the burning summerheats away  For this in  Autumn  search'd the blooming waste  Nor lost one sunny gleam for this sad sate  O man tyrannic lord how long how long  Shall prostrate nature groan beneath your rage  Awaiting renovation When oblig'd  Must you destroy Of their ambrosial food  Can you not borrow and in just return  Afford them shelter from the wintry winds  Or as the sharp year pinches with their own  Again regale them on some smiling day  Hard by the stony bottom of their town  Looks desolate and wild with here and there  A helpless number who the ruin'd state  Survive lamenting weak cast out to death  Thus a proud city populous and rich  Full of the works of peace and high in joy  At theatre or feast or sunk in sleep  As late  Palermo  was thy fate is seiz'd  By some dread earthquake and convulsive hurld  Sheer from the black foundation stenchinvolv'd  Into a gulph of blue sulphureous flame  Hence every harsher sight for now the day  O'er heaven and earth diffus'd grows warm and high  Infinite splendor wide investing all  How still the breeze save what the filmy threads  Of dew evaporate brushes from the plain  How clear the cloudless sky how deeply ting'd  With a peculiar blue th' ethereal arch  How swell'd immense amid whose azure thron'd  The radiant sun how gay how calm below  The gilded earth the harvesttreasures all  Now gather'd in beyond the rage of storms  Sure to the swain the circling sence shut up  And instant  Winter  bid to do his worst  While loose to festive joy the country round  Laughs with the loud sincerity of mirth  Care shook away The toilinvigorate youth  Not needing the melodious impulse much  Leaps wildly graceful in the lively dance  Her every charm abroad the villagetoast  Young buxom warm in native beauty rich  Darts notunmeaning looks and where her eye  Points an approving smile with double force  The cudgel rattles and the struggle twists  Age too shines out and garrulous recounts  The feats of youth Thus they rejoyce nor think  That with tomorrow's fun their annual toil  Begins again the neverceasing round  Oh knew he but his happiness of men  The happiest he who far from public rage  Deep in the vale with a choice few retir'd  Drinks the pure pleasures of the  rural life  What tho' the dome be wanting whose proud gate  Each morning vomits out the sneaking crowd  Of flatterers false and in their turn abus'd  Vile intercourse What tho' the glittering robe  Of every hue reflected light can give  Or floating loose or stiff with mazy gold  The pride and gaze of fools oppress him not  What tho' from utmost land and sea purvey'd  For him each rarer tributary life  Bleeds not and his insatiate table heaps  With luxury and death What tho' his wine  Flows not from brighter gems nor sunk in beds  Oft of gay care he tosses out the night  Or thoughtless sleeps at best in idle state  What tho' depriv'd of these fantastic joys  That stiil amuse the wanton still deceive  A face of pleasure but a heart of pain  Their hollow moments undelighted all  Sure peace is his a solid life estrang'd  To disappointment and fallacious hope  Rich in content in Nature's bounty rich  In herbs and fruits whatever greens the  Spring    When heav'n descends in show'rs or bends the bough  When  Summer  reddens and when  Autumn  beams  Or in the  Wintry  glebe whatever lies  Conceal'd and fattens with the richest sap  These are not wanting nor the milky drove  Luxuriant spread o'er all the lowing vale  Nor bleating mountains nor the chide of streams  And hum of bees inviting sleep sincere  Into the guiltless breast beneath the shade  Or thrown at large amid the fragrant hay  Nor aught beside of prospect grove or song  Dim grottoes gleaming lakes and fountain clear  Here too lives simple truth plain innocence  Unsully'd beauty sound unbroken youth  Patient of labour with a little pleas'd  Health everblooming unambitious toil  Calm contemplation and poetic ease  Let others brave the flood in quest of gain  And beat for joyless months the gloomy wave  Let such as deem it glory to destroy  Rush into blood the sack of cities seek  Unpierc'd exulting in the widow's wail  The virgin's shriek and infant's trembling cry  Let some fardistant from their native soil  Urg'd or by want or harden'd avarice  Find other lands beneath another sun  Let This thro' cities work his ardent way  By legal outrage and establish'd guile  The social sense extinct and That ferment  Mad into tumult the seditious herd  Or melt them down to slavery Let These  Insnare the wretched in the toils of law  Fomenting discord and perplexing right  An iron race and Those of fairer front  But equal inhumanity in courts  And slippery pomp delight in dark cabals  Wreathe the deep bow diffuse the lying smile  And tread the weary labyrinth of state  While He from all the stormy passions free  That restless men involve hears and but hears  At distance safe the human tempest roar  Wrapt close in conscious peace The fall of kings  The rage of nations and the crush of states  Move not the man who from the world escap'd  In still retreats and flowery solitudes  To  Nature  's voice attends from day to day  And month to month thro' the revolving  Year    Admiring sees her in her every shape  Feels all her fine emotions at his heart  Takes what she liberal gives nor thinks of more  He when young  Spring  protrudes the bursting gems  Marks the first bud and sucks the healthful gale  Into his freshen'd soul her genial hours  He quite enjoys and not a beauty blows  And not an opening blossom breathes in vain  In  Summer  he beneath the living shade  Such as from frigid  Tempe  wont to fall  Or  Haemus  cool reads what the muse of these  Perhaps has in immortal numbers sung  Or what she dictates writes and oft an eye  Shot round rejoyces in the vigorous year  When  Autumn  's yellow lustre gilds the world  And tempts the sickled swain into the sield  Seiz'd by the general joy his heart distends  With gentle throws and thro' the tepid gleams  Deepmusing then the best exerts his song  Even  Winter  wild to him is full of bliss  The mighty tempest and the hoary waste  Abrupt and deep stretch'd o'er the bury'd earth  Awake to solemn thought At night the skies  Disclos'd and kindled by refining frost  Pour every lustre on th' astonish'd eye  A friend a book the stealing hours secure  And mark them down for wisdom With swift wing  O'er land and sea imagination roams  Or truth divinely breaking on his mind  Elates his being and unfolds his powers  Or in his breast heroic virtue burns  The touch of love and kindred too he feels  The modest eye whose beams on his alone  Extatic shine the little strong embrace  Of prattling children twin'd around his neck  And emulous to please him calling forth  The fond parental soul Nor purpose gay  Amusement dance or song he sternly scorns  For happiness and true philosophy  Still are and have been of the smiling kind  This is the life which those who fret in guilt  And guilty cities never knew the life  Led by primaeval ages incorrupt  When  God  himself and  Angels  dwelt with men  Oh  Nature  allsufficient over all  Enrich me with the knowledge of thy works  Snatch me to heaven thy rolling wonders there  World beyond world in infinite extent  Profusely scatter'd o'er the void immense  Shew me their motions periods and their laws  Give me to scan thro' the disclosing deep  Light my blind way the mineral  Strata  there  Thrust blooming thence the vegetable world  O'er that rising system more complex  Of animals and higher still the mind  The varied scene of quickcompounded thought  And where the mixing passions endless shift  These ever open to my ravish'd eye  A search the flight of time can ne'er exhaust  But if to that unequal if the blood  In sluggish streams about my heart forbids  That best ambition under closing shades  Inglorious lay me by the lowly brook  And whisper to my dreams From  Thee  begin  Dwell all on  Thee  with  Thee  conclude my song  And let me never never stray from  Thee  The END  WINTER  Marble statues in the Garden of Versailes foot high  WINTER A POEM A HYMN ON THE SEASONS A POEM to the MEMORY of Sir ISAAC NEWTON AND BRITANNIA a POEM  By JAMES THOMSON  LONDON  Printed for J MILLAN Bookseller near  Whitehall  Price  s    d  MDCCXXXIV  The ARGUMENT  The subject proposed Address to Lord  WILMINGTON  First approach of  WINTER  According to the natural order of the season various storms described Rain Wind Snow The driving of the snows a Man perishing among them A short digression into  RUSSIA  The wolves in  ITALY  A winterevening described as spent by Philosophers by the Country People in the City Frost Its effects within the polar circle Athaw The whole concluding with philosophical reflections on a future state  WINTER  _SEE  Winter  comes to rule the varied year  Sullen and sad with all his rising train  Vapours  and  Clouds  and  Storms  Be these my theme  These that exalt the soul to solemn thought  And heavenly musing Welcome kindred glooms  Cogenial horrors hail with frequent foot  Pleas'd have I in my chearful morn of life  When nurs'd by careless  Solitude  I liv'd  And sung of Nature with unceasing joy  Pleas'd have I wander'd thro' your rough domain  Trod the pure virginsnows my self as pure  Heard the winds roar and the big torrent burst  Or seen the deep fermenting tempest brew'd  In the red eveningsky Thus pass'd the time  Till thro' the lucid chambers of the south  Look'd out the joyous  Spring  look'd out and smil'd  To thee the patron of her first essay  The muse O  Wilmington  renews her song  Since has she rounded the revolving  Year    Skim'd the gay  Spring  on eaglepinions borne  Attempted thro' the  Summer  blaze to rise  Then swept o'er  Autumn  with the shadowy gale  And now among the  Wintry  clouds again  Roll'd in the doubling storm she tries to soar  To swell her note with all the rushing winds  To suit her sounding cadence to the floods  As is her theme her numbers wildly great  Thrice happy could she fill thy judging ear  With bold description and with manly thought  For thee the Graces smooth thy softer thoughts  The Muses tune nor art thou skill'd alone  In awful schemes the management of states  And how to make a mighty people thrive  But equal goodness sound integrity  A firm unshaken uncorrupted soul  Amid a sliding age and burning strong  Not vainly blazing for thy country's weal  A steady spirit regularly free  These each exalting each the statesman light  Into the patriot and the publick hope  And eye to thee converting bid the muse  Record what envy dares not flattery call  When  Scorpio  gives to  Capricorn  the sway  And fierce  Aquarius  fouls th' inverted year  Retiring to the verge of heaven the sun  Scarce spreads o'er other the dejected day  Faint are his gleams and ineffectual shoot  His struggling rays in horizontal lines  Thro' the thick air as at dull distance seen  Weak wan and broad he skirts the southern sky  And soon descending to the long dark night  Wideshading all the prostrate world resigns  Nor is the night unwish'd while vital heat  Light life and joy the dubious day forsake  Meantime in sable cincture shadows vast  Deepting'd and damp and congregated clouds  And all the vapoury turbulence of Heaven  Involve the face of things Thus  Winter  falls  A heavy gloom oppressive o'er the world  Thro' nature shedding influence malign  And rouses all the seeds of dark disease  The soul of man dies in him loathing life  And black with horrid views The cattle droop  The conscious head and o'er the furrow'd land  Red from the plow the dun discolour'd flocks  Untended spreading crop the wholesome root  Along the woods along the moorish fens  Sighs the sad genius of the coming storm  And up among the loose disjointed cliffs  And fractur'd mountains wild the brawling brook  And cave presageful send a hollow moan  Resounding long in listening fancy's ear  Then comes the father of the tempest forth  Striding the gloomy blast First rains obscure  Drive thro' the mingling skies with vapour vile  Dash on the mountain's brow and shake the woods  That grumbling wave below Th' unsightly plain  Lies a brown deluge as the lowbent clouds  Pour flood on flood yet unexhausted still  Combine and deepening into night shut up  The day's fair face The wanderers of heaven  Each to his home retire save those that love  To take their pastime in the troubled air  Or skimming flutter round the dimply pool  The Cattle from th' untasted fields return  And ask with meaning lowe their wonted stalls  Or ruminate in the contiguous shade  Thither the houshold feathery people crowd  The crested cock with all his female train  Pensive and wet Meanwhile the cottageswain  Hangs o'er th' enlivening blaze and taleful there  Recounts his simple frolick much he talks  And much he laughs nor recks the storm that blows  Without and rattles on his humble roof  Wide o'er the brim with many a torrent swell'd  And the mix'd ruins of its banks o'erspread  At last the rous'dup river pours along  Resistless roaring dreadful down it comes  From the chapt mountain and the mossy wild  Tumbling thro' rocks abrupt and sounding far  Then o'er the sanded valley floating spreads  Calm sluggish silent till again constrain'd  Betwixt two meeting hills it bursts away  Where rocks and woods o'erhang the turbid stream  There gathering triple force rapid and deep  It boils and wheels and foams and thunders thro'  Nature  great parent whose continual hand  Rolls round the seasons of the changeful year  How mighty how majestie are thy works  With what a pleasing dread they swell the soul  That sees astonish'd and astonish'd sings  Ye too ye winds that now begin to blow  With boisterous sweep I raise my voice to you  Where are your stores ye subtil beings say  Where your aerial magazines reserv'd  Against the day of tempest perilous  In what fardistant region of the sky  Hush'd in dead silence sleep you when 'tis calm  Late in the lowring sky red fiery streaks  Begin to flush about the reeling clouds  Stagger with dizzy poise as doubting yet  Which master to obey while rising slow  Blank in the leadencolour'd east the moon  Wears a wan circle round her sully'd orb  The stars obtuse emit a shivering ray  Snatch'd in short eddies plays the fluttering straw  Loud shrieks the soaring hern and skreaming wild  The circling seafowl rise while from the shore  Eat into caverns by the restless wave  And forestrustling mountain comes a voice  That solemnsounding bids the world prepare  Then issues forth the storm with mad controul  And the thin fabrick of the pillar'd air  O'erturns at once Prone on the passive main  Descends th' ethereal force and with strong gust  Turns from the bottom the discolour'd deep  Thro' the loud night that bids the waves arise  Lash'd into foam the fierce conflicting brine  Seems as it sparkles all around to burn  Meantime whole oceans heaving to the clouds  And in broad billows rolling gather'd seas  Surge over surge burst in a general roar  And anchor'd navies from their stations drive  Wild as the winds athwart the howling waste  Of mighty waters Now the hilly wave  Straining they scale and now impetuous shoot  Into the secret chambers of the deep  The fullblown  Baltick  thundering o'er their head  Emerging thence again before the breath  Of allexerted heaven they wing their course  And dart on distant coasts if some sharp rock  Or sand insidious break not their career  And in loose fragments fling them floating round  Nor raging here alone unrein'd at sea  To land the tempest bears and o'er the cliff  Where screams the seamew foaming unconfin'd  Fierce swallows up the longresounding shore  The mountain growls and all its sturdy sons  Stoop to the bottom of the rocks they shade  Lone on its midnight side and all aghast  The dark wayfaring stranger breathless toils  And often falling climbs against the blast  Low waves the rooted forest vex'd and sheds  What of its tarnish'd honours yet remain  Dash'd down and scatter'd by the tearing wind's  Assiduous fury its gigantic limbs  Thus struggling thro' the dissipated grove  The whirling tempest raves along the plain  And on the cottage thatch'd or lordly roof  Keenfastening shakes them to the solid base  Sleep frighted flies and round the rocking dome  For entrance eager howls the savage blast  Heavy they roll their fleecy world along  And the sky saddens with the gather'd storm  Thro' the hush'd air the whitening shower descends  At first thinwavering till at last the flakes  Fall broad and wide and fast dimming the day  With a continual flow Sudden the fields  Put on their winterrobe of purest white  'Tis brightness all save where the new snow melts  Along the mazy stream The leafless woods  Bow their hoar Heads And ere the languid sun  Faint from the west emits his evening ray  Earth's universal face deephid and chill  Is one wild dazzling waste The labourerox  Stands cover'd o'er with snow and then demands  The fruit of all his toil The fowls of heaven  Tam'd by the cruel season crowd around  The winnowing store and claim the little boon  That Providence allows The Redbreast sole  Wisely regardful of th' embroiling sky  In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves  His shivering fellows and to trusted man  His annual visit pays New to the dome  Against the window beats then brisk alights  On the warm hearth and hopping o'er the floor  Eyes all the smiling  Family  askance  And pecks and starts and wonders where he is  Till more familiar grown the tablecrumbs  Attract his slender feet The foodless wilds  Pour forth their brown inhabitants The hare  Tho' timorous of heart and hard beset  By death in various forms dark snares and dogs  And more unpitying men the garden seeks  Urg'd on by fearless want The bleating kind  Eye the bleak heaven and next the glistening earth  With looks of dumb despair then sad dispers'd  Dig for the whither'd herb thro' heaps of snow  Now shepherds to your helpless charge be kind  Baffle the raging year and fill their pens  With food at will lodge them below the storm  And watch them strict for from the bellowing east  In this dire season oft the whirlwind's wing  Sweeps up the burthen of whole wintry plains  In one wide waft and o'er the hapless flocks  Hid in the hollow of two neighbouring hills  The billowy tempest whelms till upwards urg'd  The valley to a shining mountain swells  Tript with a wreath highcurling in the sky  As thus the snows arise and foul and fierce  All winter drives along the darken'd air  In his own looserevolving fields the swain  Disaster'd stands sees other hills ascend  Of unknown joyless brow and other scenes  Of horrid prospect shag the trackless plain  Nor finds the river nor the forest hid  Beneath the white abrupt but wanders on  From hill to dale still more and more astray  Impatient flouncing thro' the drifted heaps  Stung with the thoughts of home the thoughts of home  Rush on his nerves and call their vigour forth  In many a vain effort How sinks his soul  What black despair what horror fills his heart  When for the dusky spot that fancy feign'd  His tufted cottage rising thro the snow  He meets the roughness of the middle waste  Far from the tract and blest abode of man  While round him night resistless closes fast  And every tempest howling o'er his head  Renders the savage wilderness more wild  Then throng the busy shapes into his mind  Of cover'd pits unfathomably deep  A dire descent beyond the power of frost  Of faithless boggs of precipices huge  Smooth'd up with snow and what is land unknown  What water of the still unfrozen eye  In the loose marsh or solitary lake  Where the fresh fountain from the bottom boils  These check his fearful steps and down he sinks  Beneath the shelter of the shapeless drift  Thinking o'er all the bitterness of death  Mix'd with the tender anguish nature shoots  Thro' the wrung bosom of the dying man  His wife his children and his friends unseen  In vain for him th' officious wife prepares  The fire fairblazing and the vestment warm  In vain his little children peeping out  Into the mingling rack demand their sire  With tears of artless innocence Alas  Nor wife nor children more shall he behold  Nor friends nor sacred home On every nerve  The deadly winter seizes shuts up sense  And o'er his stronger vitals creeping cold  Lays him along the snows a stiffen'd corse Unstretch'd and bleaching in the northern blast  Ah little think the gay licentious proud  Whom pleasure power and affluence surround  They who their thoughtless hours in giddy mirth  And wanton often cruel riot waste  Ah little think they while they dance along  How many feel this very moment death  And all the sad variety of pain  How many sink in the devouring flood  Or more devouring flame How many bleed  By shameful variance betwixt man and man  How many pine in want and dungeon glooms  Shut from the common air and common use  Of their own limbs How many drink the cup  Of baleful grief or eat the bitter bread  Of misery Sore pierc'd by wintry winds  How many shrink into the fordid hut  Of chearless poverty How many shake  With all the fiercer tortures of the mind  Unbounded passion madness guilt remorse  Whence tumbled headlong from the height of life  They furnish matter for the tragic muse  Even in the vale where Wisdom loves to dwell  With Friendship Peace and Contemplation join'd  How many rackt with honest passions droop  In deep retir'd distress How many stand  Around the deathbed of their dearest friends  Like wailing pensive ghosts awaiting theirs  And point the parting pang Thought but fond man  Of these and all the thousand nameless ills  That one incessant struggle render life  One scene of toil of anguish and of fate  Vice in his high career would stand appall'd  And heedless rambling impulse learn to think  The conscious heart of Charity would warm  And his wide wish Benevolence dilate  The social tear would rise the social sigh  And into clear perfection gradual bliss  Refining still the social passions work  And here can I forget the generous few  Who touch'd with human woe redressive sought  Into the horrors of the gloomy jail  Unpitied and unheard where Misery moans  Where Sickness pines where Thirst and Hunger burn  And poor Misfortune feels the lash of Vice  While in the land of liberty the land  Whose every street and public meeting glows  With open freedom little tyrants rag'd  Snatch'd the lean morsel from the starving mouth  Tore from cold wintry limbs the tatter'd robe  Even robb'd them of the last of comforts sleep  The freeborn  Briton  to the dungeon chain'd  Or as the lust of cruelty prevail'd  At pleasure mark'd him with inglorious stripes  And crush'd out lives by various nameless ways  That for their country would have toil'd or bled  Hail patriotband who scorning secret scorn  When Justice and when Mercy led the way  Dragg'd the detected monsters into light  Wrench'd from their hand Oppression's iron rod  And bade the cruel feel the pains they gave  Yet stop not here let all the land rejoice  And make the blessing unconfin'd as great  Much still untouch'd remains in this rank age  Much is the patriot's weeding hand requir'd  The toils of law what dark insidious men  Have cumbrous added to perplex the truth  And lengthen simple justice into trade  Oh glorious were the day that saw these broke  And every man within the reach of right  Yet more outragious is the season still  A deeper horror in  Siberian  wilds  Where  Winter  keeps his unrejoicing court  And in his airy hall the loud misrule  Of driving tempest is for ever heard  There thro' the ragged woods absorpt in snow  Sole tenant of these shades the shaggy bear  With dangling ice all horrid stalks forlorn  Slowpac'd and sourer as the storms increase  He makes his bed beneath the drifted snow  And scorning the complainings of distress  Hardens his heart against assailing want  While tempted vigorous o'er the marble waste  On sleds reclin'd the furry  Russian  sits  And by his raindeer drawn behind him throws  A shining kingdom in a winter's day  Or from the cloudy  Alps  and  Appenine    Capt with grey mists and everlasting snows  Where nature in stupendous rain lies  And from the leaning rock on either side  Gush out those streams that classic song renowns  Cruel as death and hungry as the grave  Burning for blood bony and ghaunt and grim  Assembling wolves in torrent troops descend  And pouring o'er the country bear along  Keen as the northwind sweeps the glossy snow  All is their prize They fasten on the steed  Press him to earth and pierce his mighty heart  Nor can the bull his awful front defend  Or shake the murdering savages away  Rapacious at the mother's throat they fly  And tear the screaming infant from her breast  The godlike face of man avails him nought  Even beauty force divine at whose bright glance  The generous lyon stands in soften'd gaze  Here bleeds a hapless undistinguish'd prey  But if appriz'd of the severe attack  The country be shut up lur'd by the scent  On churchyards drear inhuman to relate  The disappointed prowlers fall and dig  The shrowded body from the tomb o'er which  Mix'd with foul shades and frighted ghosts they howl  Now all amid the rigours of the year  In the wild depth of  Winter  while without  The ceaseless winds blow ice be my retreat  Between the groaning forest and the shore  Beat by a boundless multitude of waves  A rural shelter'd solitary scene  Where ruddy fire and beaming tapers join  To chase the cheerless gloom There let me sit  And hold high converse with the mighty dead  Sages of antient time as gods rever'd  As gods beneficent who blest mankind  With arts and arms and humaniz'd a world  Rous'd at th' inspiring thought I throw aside  The longliv'd volume and deepmusing hail  The sacred shades that slowlyrising pass  Before my wondering eyesFirst  Socrates    Whose simple question to the folded heart  Stole unperceiv'd and from the maze of thought  Evolv'd the secret trutha godlike man  Solon  the next who built his commonweal  On equity's wide base  Lycurgus  then  Severely good and him of rugged  Rome    Numa  who soften'd her rapacious sons  Cimon  sweetsoul'd and  Aristides  just  With that attemper'd  Timoleon  Hero mild and firm  Who wept the brother while the tyrant bled  Unconquer'd  Cato  virtuous in extreme  Scipio  the human warrior gently brave  Who soon the race of spotless glory ran  And warm in youth to the po  tic shade  With friendship and philosophy retir'd  And equal to the best the  Pelopidas  and  Epaminondas  Theban  twain  Who single rais'd their country into fame  Thousands behind the boast of  Greece  and  Rome    Whom Virtue owns the tribute of a verse  Demand but who can count the stars of heaven  Who sing their influence on this lower world  But see who yonder comes in sober state  Fair mild and strong as is a vernal sun  'Tis  Phoebus  self or else the  Mantuan  swain  Great  Homer  too appears of daring wing  Parent of song and equal by his side  The  British  muse join'd hand in hand they walk  Darkling full up the middle steep to fame  Nor absent are those tuneful Shades I ween  Taught by the Graces whose inchanting touch  Shakes every passion from the various string  Nor those who solemnize the moral scene  First of your kind society divine  Still visit thus my nights for you reserv'd  And mount my soaring soul to deeds like yours  Silence thou lonely power the door be thine  See on the hallow'd hour that none intrude  Save  Lycidas  the friend with sense refin'd  Learning digested well exalted faith  Unstudy'd wit and humour ever gay  Or from the muses hill will  Pope  descend  To raise the sacred hour to make it smile  And with the social spirit warm the heart  For tho' not sweeter his own  Homer  sings  Yet is his life the more endearing song  Thus in some deep retirement would I pass  The winterglooms with friends of various turn  Or blithe or solemn as the theme inspir'd  With them would search if this unbounded frame  Of nature rose from unproductive night  Or sprung eternal from th'  eternal Cause    Its springs its laws its progress and its end  Hence larger prospects of the beauteous whole  Would gradual open on our opening minds  And each diffufive harmony unite  In full perfection to th' astonish'd eye  Thence would we plunge into the moral world  Which tho' more seemingly perplex'd moves on  In higher order fitted and impell'd  By Wisdom's finest hand and issuing all  In universal good Historic truth  Should next conduct thro' the deeps of time  Point us how empire grew revolv'd and fell  In scatter'd states what makes the nations smile  Improves their soil and gives them double suns  And why they pine beneath the brightest skies  In nature's richest lap As thus we talk'd  Our hearts would burn within us would inhale  That portion of divinity that ray  Of purest heaven which lights the glorious flame  Of patriots and of heroes But if doom'd  In powerless humble fortune to repress  These ardent risings of the kindling soul  Then even superior to ambition we  Would learn the private virtues how to glide  Thro' shades and plains along the smoothest stream  Of rural life or snatch'd away by hope  Thro' the dim spaces of futurity  With earnest eye anticipate those scenes  Of happiness and wonder where the mind  In endless growth and infinite ascent  Rises from state to state and world to world  And when with these the serious soul is foil'd  We shifting for relief would play the shapes  Of frolic fancy and incessant form  Unnumber'd pictures fleeting o'er the brain  Yet rapid still renew'd and pour'd immense  Into the mind unbounded without space  The great the new the beautiful or mix'd  Burlesque and odd the risible and gay  Whence vivid Wit and Humour droll of face  Call laughter forth deepshaking every nerve  Meantime the village rouzes up the sire  While well attested and as well believ'd  Heard solemn

heart  Easily pleas'd the long loud laugh sincere  The kiss snatch'd hasty from the sidelong maid  On purpose guardless or pretending sleep  The leap the slap the haul and shook to notes  Of native music the respondent dance  Thus jocund fleets with them the winternight  The city swarms intense The public haunt  Full of each theme and warm with mixt discourse  Hums indistinct The sons of riot flow  Down the loose stream of false inchanted joy  To swift destruction On the rankled soul  The gaming fury falls and in one gulph  Of total ruin honour virtue peace  Friends families and fortune headlong sink  Rises the dance along the lighted dome  Mix'd and evolv'd a thousand sprightly ways  The glittering court effuses every pomp  The circle deepens rain'd from radiant eyes  A soft effulgence o'er the palace waves  While thick as insects in the summershine  The fop lightfluttering spreads his mealy wings  Dread o'er the scene the ghost of  Hamlet  stalks  Othello  rages poor  Monimia  mourns  And  Belvidera  pours her soul in love  Assenting terror shakes the silent tear  Steals o'er the cheek or else the  comic Muse  Holds to the world the picture of itself  And raises sly the fair impartial laugh  Clear frost succeeds and thro' the blue serene  For sight too fine th' ethereal nitre flies  Killing infectious damps and the spent air  Storing afresh with elemental life  Close crowds the shining atmosphere and binds  Our strengthen'd bodies in its cold embrace  Constringent feeds and animates our blood  Refines our spirits thro' the newstrung nerves  In swifter fallies darting to the brain  Where sits the soul intense collected cool  Bright as the skies and as the season keen  All nature feels the renovating force  Of  Winter  only to the thoughtless eye  In desolation seen The vacant glebe  Draws in abundant vegetable soul  athers vigour for the coming year  A strong glow sits on the lively cheek  Of ruddy fire and luculent along  The purer rivers flow their sullen deeps  Amazing open to the shepherd's gaze  And murmur hoarser at the fixing frost  What art thou Frost and whence are thy keen stores  Deriv'd thou secret allinvading Power  Whom even th' illusive fluid cannot fly  Is not thy potent energy unseen  Myriads of little salts or hook'd or shap'd  Like double wedges and diffus'd immense  Thro' water earth and ether Hence at eve  Steam'd eager from the red horizon round  With the still rage of  Winter  deep suffus'd  An icy gale oft shifting o'er the pool  Breathes a blue film and in its mid career  Arrests the bickering stream The loosen'd ice  Let down the flood and halfdissolv'd by day  Rustles no more but to the sedgy bank  Fast grows or gathers round the pointed stone  A crystal pavement by the breath of heaven  Cemented firm till seiz'd from shore to shore  The whole detruded river growls below  Loud rings the frozen earth and hard reflects  A double noise while at his evening watch  The villagedog deters the nightly thief  The heifer lows the distant waterfall  Swells in the breeze and with the hasty tread  Of traveller the many sounding plain  Shakes from afar The full ethereal round  Infinite worlds disclosing to the view  Shines out intensely keen and all one cope  Of starry glitter glows from pole to pole  From pole to pole the rigid influence falls  Thro' the still night incessant heavy strong  And seizes nature fast It freezes on  Till morn late rising o'er the drooping world  Lifts her pale eye unjoyous Then appears  The various labour of the silent night  Prone from the dripping eave and dumb cascade  Whose idle torrents only seem to roar  The pendant isicle the frostwork fair  Where transient hues and fancy'd figures rise  The liquid kingdom all to solid turn'd  Widespouted o'er the brow the frozen brook  A livid tract cold gleaming on the morn  The forest bent beneath the plumy wave  And by the frost refin'd the whiter snow  Incrusted hard and sounding to the tread  Of early shepherd as he pensive seeks  His pining flock or from the mountaintop  Pleas'd with the slippery surface swist descends  On blithesome frolicks bent the youthful swains  While every work of man is laid at rest  Fond o'er the river rush and shuddering view  The doubtful deeps below Or where the lake  And long canal the cerule plain extend  The city pours her thousands swarming all  From every quarter and with him who slides  Or skating sweeps swift as the winds along  In circling poise or else disorder'd falls  His feet illuded sprawling to the sky  While the laugh rages round from end to end  Encreasing still resounds the crowded scene  Pure quick and sportful is the wholesome day  But soon elaps'd The horizontal sun  Broad o'er the south hangs at his utmost noon  And ineffectual strikes the gelid cliff  The mountain still his azure gloss maintains  Nor feels the feeble touch Perhaps the vale  Relents a while to the reflected ray  Or from the forest falls the cluster'd snow  Myriads of gem that by the breeze diffus'd  Gaytwinkle thro' the gleam Heard thick around  Thunders the sport of those who with the gun  And dog impatient bounding at the shot  Worse than the season desolate the fields  And adding to the ruins of the year  Distress the footed or the feather'd game  But what is this these infant tempests what  The mockery of  Winter  should our eye  Astonish'd shoot into the frozen zone  Where more than half the joyless year is night  And failing gradual life at last goes out  There undissolving from the first of time  Snows swell on snows amazing to the sky  And icy mountains there on mountains pil'd  Seem to the shivering sailor from afar  Shapeless and white an atmosphere of clouds  Projected huge and horrid o'er the main  Alps frown on Alps or rushing hideous down  As if old Chaos was again return'd  Shake the firm pole and make an ocean boil  Whence heap'd abrupt along the howling shore  And into various shapes as fancy leans  Work'd by the wave the crystal pillars heave  Swells the blue portico the gothic dome  Shoots fretted up and birds and beasts and men  Rise into mimic life and sink by turns  The restless deep itself cannot resist  The binding fury but in all its rage  Of tempest taken by the boundless frost  Is many a fathom to the bottom chain'd  And bid to roar no more a bleak expanse  Shagg'd o'er with wavy rocks chearless and void  Of every life that from the dreary months  Flies conscious southward Miserable they  Who here entangled in the gathering ice  Take their last look of the descending sun  While full of death and fierce with tenfold frost  The long long night incumbent o'er their head  Falls horrible Such was the  Sir  Hugh Willoughby  sent by Queen  Elizabeth  to discover the northeast passage  Briton  's fate  As with first prow What have not  Britons  dar'd  He for the passage sought attempted since  So much in vain and seeming to be shut  By jealous nature with eternal bars  In these fell regions in  Arzina  caught  And to the stony deep his idle ship  Immediate seal'd he with his hapless crew  Each full exerted at his several task  Froze into statues to the cordage glued  The sailor and the pilot to the helm  Hard by these shores the last of mankind live  And scarce enliven'd by the distant sun  That rears and ripens man as well as plants  Here Human Nature just begins to dawn  Deep from the piercing season sunk in caves  Here by dull fires and with unjoyous chear  They wear the tedious gloom Immers'd in furs  Lie the gross race Nor sprightly jest nor song  Nor tenderness they know nor ought of life  Beyond the kindred  ears that stalk without  Till longexpected morning looks at length  Faint on their fields where  Winter  reigns alone  And calls the quiver'd savage to the chase  Muttering the winds at eve with hoarser voice  Blow blustering from the south The frost subdu'd  Gradual resolves into a trickling thaw  Spotted the mountains shine loose sleet descends  And floods the country round The rivers swell  Impatient for the day Broke from the hills  O'er rocks and woods in broad brown cataracts  A thousand snowfed torrents shoot at once  And where they rush the wideresounding plain  Is left one slimy waste Those sullen seas  That wash th' ungenial pole will rest no more  Beneath the shackles of the mighty north  But rousing all their waves resistless heave  And hark the lengthening roar continuous runs  Athwart the rifted main at once it bursts  And piles a thousand mountains to the clouds  Ill fares the bark the wretch's last resort  That lost amid the floating fragments moors  Beneath the shelter of an icy isle  While night o'erwhelms the sea and horror looks  More horrible Can human force endure  Th' assembled mischiefs that besiege them round  Heartgnawing hunger fainting weariness  The roar of winds and waves the crush of ice  Now ceasing now renew'd with louder rage  And in dire echoes bellowing round the main  More to embroil the deep Leviathan  And his unwieldy train in horrid sport  Tempest the loosen'd brine while thro' the gloom  Far from the bleak inhospitable shore  Loading the winds is heard the hungry howl  Of famish'd monsters there awaiting wrecks  Yet  Providence  that everwaking eye  Looks down with pity on the fruitless toil  Of mortals lost to hope and lights them safe  Thro' all this dreary labyrinth of fate

revolve  From unassisted vision hid the  Moons  To chear remoter planets numerous pour'd  By him in all their mingled tracts were seen  He also fix'd the wandering  Queen of Night    Whether she wanes into a scanty orb  Or waxing broad with her pale shadowy light  In a soft deluge overflows the sky  Her every motion cleardiscerning He  Adjusted to the mutual  Main  and taught  Why now the mighty mass of water swells  Resistless heaving on the broken rocks  And the full river turning till again  The tide revertive unattracted leaves  A yellow waste of idle sands behind  Then breaking hence he took his ardent flight  Thro' the blue Infinite and every  Star    Which the clear concave of a winter's night  Pours on the eye or astronomic tube  Farstretching snatches from the dark abyss  Or such as farther in successive skies  To fancy shine alone at his approach  Blaz'd into  Suns  the living centre each  Of an harmonious system all combin'd  And rul'd unerring by that single power  Which draws the stone projected to the ground  O unprofuse magnificence divine  O  Wisdom  truly perfect thus to call  From a few causes such a scheme of things  Effects so various beautiful and great  An universe compleat and O belov'd  Of heaven whose wellpurg'd penetrative eye  The mystic veil transpiercing inly scann'd  The rising moving wideestablish'd frame  He first of men with awful wing pursu'd  The  Comet  thro' the long Eliptic curve  As round innumerous worlds he wound his way  Till to the forehead of our evening sky  Return'd the blazing wonder glares anew  And o'er the trembling nations shakes dismay  The heavens are all his own from the wild rule  Of whirling  Vortices  and circling  Spheres    To their first great simplicity restor'd  The schools astonish'd stood but found it vain  To keep at odds with demonstration strong  And unawaken'd dream beneath the blaze  Of truth At once their pleasing visions sled  With the gay shadows of the morning mix'd  When  Newton  rose our philosophie sun  Th' aerial flow of  Sound  was known to him  From whence it first in wavy circles breaks  Till the touch'd organ takes the meaning in  Nor could the darting  Beam  of speed immense  Escape his swift pursuit and measuring eye  Even  Light itself  which every things displays  Shone undiscover'd till his brighter mind  Untwisted all the shining robe of day  And from the whitening undistinguish'd blaze  Collecting every ray into his kind  To the charm'd eye educ'd the gorgeous train  Of  ParentColours  First the flaming  Red  Sprung vivid forth the tawny  Orange  next  And next delicious  Yellow  by whose side  Fell the kind beams of allrefreshing  Green  Then the pure  Blue  that swells autumnal skies  Ethereal play'd and then of sadder hue  Emerg'd the deepen'd  Indico  as when  The heavyskirted evening droops with frost  While the last gleamings of refracted light  Dy'd in the fainting  Violet  away  These when the clouds distil the rosy shower  Shine out distinct adown the watry bow  While o'er our heads the dewy vision bends  Delightful melting on the fields beneath  Myriads of mingling dies from these result  And myriads still remainInfinite source  Of beauty everflushing evernew  Did ever poet image ought so fair  Dreaming in whispering groves by the hoarse brook  Or prophet to whose rapture heaven descends  Even now the setting sun and shifting clouds  Seen  Greenwich  from thy lovely heights declare  How just how beauteous the  refractive Law  The noiseless  Tide  of  Time  all bearing down  To vast Eternity's unbounded sea  Where the green islands of the happy shine  He stemm'd alone and to the source involv'd  Deep in primaeval gloom ascending rais'd  His lights at equal distances to guide  Historian wilder'd on his darksome way  But who can number up his labours who  His high discoveries sing when but a few  Of the deepstudying race can stretch their minds  To what he knew in fancy's lighter thought  How shall the muse then grasp the mighty theme  What wonder thence that his  Devotion  swell'd  Responsive to his knowledge for could he  Whose piercing mental eye diffusive saw  The finish'd University of things  In all its order magnitude and parts  Forbear incessant to adore that  Power  Who fills sustains and actuates the whole  Say ye who best can tell ye happy few  Who saw him in the softest lights of life  All unwithheld indulging to his friends  The vast unborrow'd treasures of his mind  Oh speak the wondrous man how mild how calm  How greatly humble how divinely good  How firm establish'd on eternal truth  Fervent in doing well with every nerve  Still pressing on forgetful of the past  And panting for perfection far above  Those little cares and visionary joys  That so perplex the fond impassion'd heart  Of evercheated evertrusting man  This  Conduit  from thy rural hours we hope  As thro' the pleasing shade where Nature pours  Her every sweet in studious ease you walk  The social passions smiling at thy

pivilege  Of Being dare contend say can a soul  Of such extensive deep tremendous powers  Enlarging still be but a finer breath  Of spirits dancing thro' their tubes awhile  And then for ever lost in vacant air  But hark methinks I hear a warning voice  Solemn as when some awful change is come  Sound thro' the world"  'Tis doneThe measure's full    "  And I resign my charge  Ye mouldering stones  That build the towering pyramid the proud  Triumphal arch the monument effac'd  By ruthless ruin and whate'er supports  The worshipp'd name of hoar antiquity  Down to the dust what grandeur can ye boast  While  Newton  lifts his column to the skies  Beyond the waste of timeLet no weak drop  Be shed for him The virgin in her bloom  Cut off the joyous youth and darling child  These are the tombs

Correct her manners and inspire her youth  For tho' deprav'd and sunk she brought thee forth  And glories in thy name she points thee out  To all her sons and bids them eye thy star  While in expectance of the second life  When Time shall be no more thy sacred dust  Sleeps with her kings and dignifies the scene  The END  BRITANNIA A POEM  Written in the Year  Et tantas audetis tollere Moles  Quos Egosed motos praestat componere fluctus  Post mihi non simili Poena commissa luetis  Maturate fugam Regique haec dicite vestro  Non illi Imperium Pelagi Saevumque Tridentem  Sed mihi sorte datum  VIRG  BRITANNIA A POEM  _AS on the seabeat shore  Britannia  sat  Of her degenerate sons the faded fame  Deep in her anxious heart revolving sad  Bare was her throbbing bosom to the gale  That hoarse and hollow from the bleak surge blew  Loose flow'd her tresses rent her azure robe  Hung o'er the deep from her majestic brow  She tore the laurel and she tore the bay  Nor ceas'd the copious grief to bathe her cheek  Nor ceas'd her sobs to murmur to the Main  Peace discontented nigh departing stretch'd  Her dovelike wings And War tho' greatly rous'd  Yet mourn'd his fetter'd hands While thus the Queen  Of nations spoke and what she said the Muse  Recorded faithful in unbidden verse  Even not yon sail that from the skymixt wave  Dawns on the sight and wafts the  Royal Youth    A freight of future glory to my shore  Even not the flattering view of golden days  And rising periods yet of bright renown  Beneath the  Parents  and their endless line  Thro' late revolving time can sooth my rage  While unchastis'd the insulting  Spaniard  dares  Infest the trading flood full of vain War  Despise my Navies and my Merchants seize  As trusting to false peace they fearless roam  The world of waters wild made by the toil  And liberal blood of glorious ages mine  Nor bursts my sleeping thunder on their head  Whence this unwonted patience this weak doubt  This tame beseeching of rejected peace  This meek forbearance this unnative fear  To generous  Britons  never known before  And fail'd my Fleets for this on  Indian  tides  To float unactive with the veering winds  The mockery of war while hot disease  And sloth distemper'd swept off burning crowds  For action ardent and amid the deep  Inglorious sunk them in a watry grave  There now they lie beneath the rowling flood  Far from their friends and country unaveng'd  And back the weeping warship comes again  Dispirited and thin her sons asham'd  Thus idly to review their native shore  With not one glory sparkling in their eye  One triumph on their tongue A passenger  The violated Merchant comes along  That farsought wealth for which the noxious gale  He drew and sweat beneath Equator suns  By lawless force detain'd a force that soon  Would melt away and every spoil resign  Were once the  British  lyon heard to roar  Whence is it that the proud  Iberian  thus  In their own wellasserted element  Dares rouze to wrath the Masters of the Main  Who told him that the big incumbent war  Would not ere this have roll'd his trembling ports  In smoaky ruin and his guilty stores  Won by the ravage of a butcher'd world  Yet unatton'd sunk in the swallowing deep  Or led the glittering prize into the  Thames  There was a time Oh let my languid sons  Resume their spirit at the rouzing thought  When all the pride of  Spain  in one dread fleet  Swell'd o'er the lab'ring surge like a whole heaven  Of clouds wideroll'd before the boundless breeze  Gaily the splendid Armament along  Exultant plough'd reflecting a red gleam  As sunk the sun o'er all the flaming vast  Tall gorgeous and elate drunk with the dream  Of easy conquest while their bloated war  Stretch'd out from sky to sky the gather'd force  Of ages held in its capacious womb  But soon regardless of the cumbrous pomp  My dauntless  Britons  came a gloomy few  With tempest black the goodly scene deform'd  And laid their glory waste The bolts of fate  Resistless thunder'd thro' their yielding sides  Fierce o'er their beauty blaz'd the lurid flame  And seiz'd in horrid grasp or shatter'd wide  Amid the mighty waters deep they sunk  Then too from every promontory chill  Rank fen and cavern where the wild wave works  I swept confederate winds and swell'd a storm  Round the glad isle snatch'd by the vengeful blast  The scatter'd remnants drove on the blind shelve  And pointed rock that marks the indented shore  Relentless dash'd where loud the Northern Main  Howls thro' the fractur'd  Caledonian  isles  Such were the dawnings of my liquid reign  But since how vast it grew how absolute  Even in those troubled times when dreadful  Blake  Aw'd angry Nations with the  British  Name  Let every humbled state let  Europe  say  Sustain'd and ballanc'd by my naval arm  Ah what must these immortal spirits think  Of your poor shifts These for their country's good  Who fac'd the blackest danger knew no fear  No mean submission but commanded peace  Ah how with indignation must they burn  If ought but joy can touch etherial breasts  With shame with grief to see their feeble sons  Shrink from that empire o'er the conquer'd feas  For which their wisdom plan'd their councils glow'd  And their veins bled thro' many a toiling age  Oh first of human blessings and supreme  Fair  Peace  how lovely how delightful thou  By whose wide tie the kindred sons of men  Like brothers live in amity combin'd  And unsuspicious faith while honest toil  Gives every joy and to those joys a right  Which idle barbarous Rapine but usurps  Pure is thy reign when unaccurs'd by blood  Nought save the sweetness of indulgent showers  Trickling distils into the vernant glebe  Instead of mangled carcasses sadseen  When the blythe sheaves lie scatter'd o'er the field  When only shining shares the crooked knife  And hooks imprint the vegetable wound  When the land blushes with the rose alone  The falling fruitage and the bleeding vine  Oh  Peace  thou source and soul of social life  Beneath whose calm inspiring influence  Science his views enlarges Art refines  And swelling Commerce opens all her ports  Blest be the Man divine who gives us Thee  Who bids the trumpet hush his horrid clang  Nor blow the giddy nations into rage  Who sheaths the murderous blade the deadly gun  Into the wellpil'd armory returns  And every vigour from the work of death  To grateful industry converting makes  The country flourish and the city smile  Unviolated him the virgin sings  And him the smiling mother to her train  Of him the shepherd in the peaceful dale  Chaunts and the treasures of his labour sure  The husbandman of him as at the plough  Or team he toils With him the sailor sooths  Beneath the trembling moon the midnight wave  And the full city warm from street to street  And shop to shop responsive rings of him  Nor joys one land alone his praise extends  Far as the sun rolls the diffusive day  Far as the breeze can bare the gifts of peace  Till all the happy nations catch the song  What would not  Peace  the Patriot bear for thee  What painful patience What incessant care  What mixt anxiety What sleepless toil  Even from the rash protected what reproach  For he thy value knows thy friendship he  To human nature but the better thou  The richer of delight sometimes the more  Inevitable  War  when russian force  Awakes the fury of an injur'd state  Then the good easy man whom reason rules  Who while unhurt knew nor offence nor harm  Rouz'd by bold insult and injurious rage  With sharp and sudden check th' astonish'd sons  Of violence confounds firm as his cause  His bolder heart in awful justice clad  His eyes effulging a peculiar fire  And as he charges thro' the prostrate war  His keen arm teaches faithless men no more  To dare the sacred vengeance of the just  And what my thoughtless sons should fire you more  Than when your weilearn'd empire of the deep  The least beginning injury receives  What better cause can call your lightning forth  Your thunder wake Your dearest life demand  What better cause than when your country sees  The sly destruction at her vitals aim'd  For oh it much imports you 'tis your all  To keep your Trade intire intire the force  And honour of your Fleets o'er that to watch  Even with a hand severe and jealous eye  In intercourse be gentle generous just  By wisdom polish'd and of manners fair  But on the sea be terrible untam'd  Unconquerable still let none escape  Who shall but aim to touch your glory there  Is there the man into the lyon's den  Who dares intrude to snatch his young away  And is a  Briton  seiz'd and seiz'd beneath  The slumbring terrors of a  British  Fleet  Then ardent rise Oh great in vengeance rise  O'erturn the proud teach rapine to restore  And as you ride sublimely round the world  Make every vessel stoop make every state  At once their welfare and their duty know  This is your glory this your wisdom this  The native power for which you were design'd  By fate when fate design'd the firmest state  That e'er was seated on the subject sea  A state alone where  Liberty  should live  In these late times this evening of mankind  When  Athens    Rome  and  Carthage  are no more  The world almost in slavish sloth dissolv'd  For this these rocks around your coast were thrown  For this your oaks peculiar harden'd shoot  Strong into sturdy growth for this your hearts  Swell with a sullen courage growing still  As danger grows and strength and toil for this  Are liberal pour'd o'er all the fervent land  Then cherish this this unexpensive power  Undangerous to the publick ever prompt  By lavish Nature thrust into your hand  And unencumber'd with the bulk immense  Of conquest whence huge empires rose and fell  Selfcrush'd extend your reign from shore to shore  Wheree'er the wind your high behests can blow  And fix it deep on this eternal base  For should the sliding fabrrick once give way  Soon slacken'd quite and past recovery broke  It gathers ruin as it rolls along  Steeprushing down to that devouring gulph  Where many a mighty empire buried lies  And should the big redundant flood of Trade  In which ten thousand thousand Labours join  Their several currents till the boundless tide  Rolls in a radiant deluge o'er the land  Should this bright stream the least inflected point  Its course another way o'er other lands  The various treasure would resistless pour  Ne'er to be won again its antient tract  Left a vile channel desolate and dead  With all around a miserable waste  Not  Egypt  were her better heaven the  Nile  Turn'd in the pride of flow when o'er his rocks  And roaring cataracts beyond the reach  Of dizzy vision pil'd in one wide flash  An  Ethiopian  deluge foams amain  Whence wond'ring fable trac'd him from the sky  Even not that prime of earth where harvests crowd  On untill'd harvests all the teeming year  If of the fat o'erflowing culture robb'd  Were then a more uncomfortable wild  Steril and void than of her trade depriv'd  Britons  your boasted isle her Princes sunk  Her highbuilt honour moulder'd to the dust  Unnerv'd her force her spirit vanish'd quite  With rapid wing her riches fled away  Her unfrequented ports alone the sign  Of what she was her Merchants scatter'd wide  Her hollow shops shut up and in her streets  Her fields woods markets villages and roads  The cheerful voice of labour heard no more  Oh let not then waste Luxury impair  That manly soul of toil which strings your nerves  And your own proper happiness creates  Oh let not the soft penetrating plague  Creep on the freeborn mind and working there  With the sharp tooth of many a newform'd want  Endless and idle all eat out the heart  Of  Liberty  the high conception blast  The noble sentiment the impatient scorn  Of base subjection and the swelling wish  For general good erazing from the mind  While nought save narrow Selfishness succeeds  And low design the sneaking passions all  Let loose and reigning in the rankled breast  Induc'd at last by scarceperceiv'd degrees  Sapping the very frame of government  And life a total dissolution comes  Sloth ignorance dejection flattery fear  Oppression raging o'er the waste he makes  The human being almost quite extinct  And the whole state in broad Corruption sinks  Oh shun that gulph that gaping ruin shun  And countless ages roll it far away  From you ye heavenbelov'd may  Liberty    The light of life the sun of human kind  Whence Heroes Bards and Patriots borrow flame  Even where the keen depressive North descends  Still spread exalt and actuate your powers  While slavish Southern climates beam in vain  And may a publick spirit from the  Throne    Where every Virtue sits go copious forth  Live o'er the land the finer Arts inspire  Make thoughtful Science raise his pensive head  Blow the fresh Bay bid Industry rejoice  And the rough Sons of lowest Labour smile  As when profuse of Spring the loosen'd West  Lifts up the pining year and balmy breathes  Youth life and love and beauty o'er the world  But haste we from these melancholly shores  Nor to deaf winds and waves our fruitless plaint  Pour weak the country claims our active aid  That let us roam and where we find a spark  Of publick virtue blow it into flame  And now my sons the sons of freedom meet  In awful senate thither let us fly  Burn in the Patriot's thought flow from his tongue  In fearless truth myself transform'd preside  And shed the spirit of  Britannia  round  This said her fleeting form and airy train  Sunk in the gale and nought but ragged rocks  Rush'd on the broken eye and nought was heard  But the rough cadence of the dashing wave  The END  BOOKS Printed for J MILLAN near CharingCross  THE CARPENTER's COMPANION being an
