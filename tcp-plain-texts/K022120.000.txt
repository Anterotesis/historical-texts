shallow  thinkers who fall short of the truth and that of  abstruse  thinkers who go beyond it The latter class are by far the most uncommon and I may add by far the most useful and valuable They suggest hints at least and start difficulties which they want perhaps skill to pursue but which may produce very fine discoveries when handled by men who have a more just way of thinking At worst what they say is uncommon and if it should cost some pains to comprehend it one has however the pleasure of hearing something that is new An author is little to be valu'd who tells us nothing but what we can learn from every coffeehouse conversation  ALL people of  shallow  thought are apt to decry even those of  solid  understanding as  abstruse  thinkscience  ers and metaphysicians and refiners and never will allow any thing to be just which is beyond their own weak conceptions There are some cases I own where an extraordinary refinement affords a strong presumption of falshood and where no reasoning is to be trusted but what is natural and easy When a man deliberates concerning his conduct in any  particular  affair and forms schemes in politics trade oeconomy or any business in life he never ought to draw his arguments too fine or connect too long a chain of consequences together Something is sure to happen that will disconcert his reasoning and produce an event different from what he expected But when we reason upon  general  subjects one may justly affirm that our speculations can scarce ever be too fine provided they be just and that the difference betwixt a common man and a man of genius is chiefly seen in the shallowness or depth of the principles upon which they proceed General reasonings seem intricate merely because they are general nor is it easy for the bulk of mankind to distinguish in a great number of particulars that common circumstance in which they all agree or to extract it pure and unmixt from the other superfluous circumstances Every judgment or conclusion with them is particular They cannot enlarge their view to those universal propositions which comprehend under them an infinite number of individuals and include a whole  in a single theorem Their eye is confounded with such an extensive prospect and the conclusions deriv'd from it even tho' clearly exprest seem intricate and obscure But however intricate they may seem 'tis certain that general principles if just and sound must always prevail in the general course of things tho' they may fail in particular cases and 'tis the chief business of philosophers to regard the general course of things I may add that 'tis also the chief business of politicians especially in the domestic government of the state where the public good which is or ought to be their object depends on the concurrence of a multitude of cases not as in foreign politics upon accidents and chances and the caprices of a few persons This therefore makes the difference betwixt  particular  deliberations and  general  reasonings and renders subtilty and refinement much more suitable to the latter than to the former  I THOUGHT this introduction necessary before the following discourses on  commerce luxury money interest  c where perhaps there will occur some principles which are uncommon and which may seem too refin'd and subtile for such vulgar subjects If false let them be rejected but no one ought to entertain a prejudice against them merely because they are out of the common road  THE greatness of a state and the happiness of its subjects however independent they may be suppos'd in some respects are commonly allow'd to be inseparable with regard to commerce and as private men receive greater security in the possession of their trade and riches from the power of the public so the public becomes powerful in proportion to the riches and extensive commerce of private men This maxim is true in general tho' I cannot forbear thinking that it may possibly admit of some exceptions and that we often establish it with too little reserve and limitation There may be some circumstances where the commerce and riches and luxury of individuals instead of adding strength to the public may serve only to thin its armies and diminish its authority among the neighbouring nations Man is a very variable being and susceptible of many different opinions principles and rules of conduct What may be true while he adheres to one way of thinking will be found false when he has embrac'd an opposite set of manners and opinions  THE bulk of every state may be divided into  husbandmen  and  manufacturers  The former are employ'd in the culture of the land The latter work up the materials furnish'd by the former into all the commodities which are necessary or ornamental to human life As soon as men quit their savage state where they live chiefly by huntthe  ing and fishing they must fall into these two classes tho' the arts of agriculture employ  at first  the most numerous part of the society  Mons  Melon  in his political essay on commerce asserts that even at present if you divide  France  into parts are labourers or peasants only artizans one belonging to the law church and military and one merchants financiers and bourgeois This calculation is certainly very erroneous In  France England  and indeed most parts of  Europe  half of the inhabitants live in cities and even of those who live in the country a very great number are artizans perhaps above a third  Time and experience improve so much these arts that the land may easily maintain a much greater number of men than those who are immediately employ'd in its cultivation or who furnish the more necessary manufactures to such as are so employ'd  IF these superfluous hands be turn'd towards the finer arts which are commonly denominated the arts of  luxury  they add to the happiness of the state since they afford to many the opportunity of receiving enjoyments with which they would otherways have been unacquainted But may not another scheme be propos'd for the employment of these superfluous hands May not the sovereign lay claim to them and employ them in fleets and armies to increase the dominions of the state abroad and spread its fame over distant nations 'Tis certain that the fewer desires and wants are found in the proprietors and labourers of land the fewer hands do they employ and consequently  superfluities of the land instead of maintaining tradesmen and manufacturers may support fleets and armies to a much greater extent than where a great many arts are requir'd to minister to the luxury of particular persons Here therefore seems to be a kind of opposition betwixt the greatness of the state and the happiness of the subjects A state is never greater than when all its superfluous hands are employ'd in the service of the public The ease and convenience of private persons require that these hands should be employ'd in their service The one can never be satisfied but at the expence of the other As the ambition of the sovereign must entrench on the luxury of individuals so the luxury of individuals must diminish the force and check the ambition of the sovereign  NOR is this reasoning merely chimerical but is founded on history and experience The republic of  Sparta  was certainly more powerful than any state now in the world consisting of an equal number of people and this was owing entirely to the want of commerce and luxury The  Helotes  were the labourers The  Spartans  were the soldiers or gentlemen 'Tis evident that the labour of the  Helotes  could not have maintain'd so great a number of  Spartans  had these latter liv'd in ease and delicacy and given employment to a great variety of trades and manufactures The like policy may be remark'd in  Rome  and indeed thro'  all antient history 'tis observable that the smallest republics rais'd and maintain'd greater armies than states consisting of triple the number of inhabitants are able to support at present 'Tis computed that in all  European  nations the proportion betwixt soldiers and people does not exceed one to a hundred But we read that the city of  Rome  alone with its small territory rais'd and maintain'd in early times ten legions against the  Latins Athens  whose whole dominions were not larger than  Yorkshire  sent to the expedition against  Sicily  near forty thousand men  Thucydides  lib    Dionysius  the elder 'tis said maintain'd a standing army of a hundred thousand foot and ten thousand horse beside a large fleet of four hundred sail  Diod Sic  lib This account I own is somewhat suspicious not to say worse chiefly because this army was not composed of citizens but of mercenary forces See discourse X  tho' his territories extended no farther than the city of  Syracuse  about a third part of the island of  Sicily  and some seaport towns or garrisons on the coast of  Italy  and  Illyricum  'Tis true the antient armies in time of war subsisted much upon plunder But did not the enemy plunder in their turn which was a more ruinous way of levying a tax than any other that could be devis'd In short no probable reason can be given for the great power of the more antient states above the modern but their  want of commerce and luxury Few artizans were maintain'd by the labour of the farmers and therefore more soldiers might live upon it  Titus Livius  says that  Rome  in his time would find it difficult to raise as large an army as that which in her early days she sent out against the  Gauls  and  Latins  Titi Livit lb cap Adeo in quae laboramus  says he  sola crevimus divitias luxurianque  Instead of those soldiers who fought for liberty and empire in  Camillus  's time there were in  Augustus  's days musicians painters cooks players and taylors And if the land was equally cultivated at both periods 'tis evident it could maintain equal numbers in the one profession as in the other They added nothing to the mere necessaries of life in the latter period more than in the former  'TIS natural on this occasion to ask whether sovereigns may not return to the maxims of antient policy and consult their own interest in this respect more than the happiness of their subjects I answer that it appears to me almost impossible and that because antient policy was violent and contrary to the more natural and usual course of things 'Tis well known with what peculiar laws  Sparta  was govern'd and what a prodigy that republic is justly esteem'd by every one who has consider'd human nature as it has display'd itself in other nations and other ages Were the testimony  of history less positive and circumstantial such a government wou'd appear a mere philosophical whim or fiction and impossible ever to be reduc'd to practice And tho' the  Roman  and other antient republics were supported on principles somewhat more natural yet was there a very extraordinary concurrence of circumstances to make them submit to such grievous burthens They were free states they were small ones and the age being martial all the neighbouring states were continually in arms Freedom naturally begets public spirit especially in small states and this public spirit this  amor patriae  must increase when the public is almost in continual alarm and men are oblig'd every moment to expose themselves to the greatest dangers for its defence A continual succession of wars makes every citizen a soldier They take the field in their turn and during their service are chiefly maintain'd by themselves And notwithstanding that this service is equivalent to a very severe tax 'tis less felt by a people addicted to arms who fight for honour and revenge more than pay and are unacquainted with gain and industry as well as pleasure  The more antient  Romans  liv'd in perpetual war with all their neighbours and in old  Latin  the term  hostis  exprest both a stranger and an enemy This is remark'd by  Cicero  but by him is ascribed to the humanity of his ancestors who softened as much as possible the denomination of an enemy by calling him by the same appellation which signified a stranger  De off  lib 'Tis however much more probable from the manners of the times that the ferocity of those people was so great as to make them regard all strangers as enemies and call them by the same name It is not besides consistent with the most common maxims of policy or of nature that any state shou'd regard its public enemies with a friendly eye or preserve any such sentiments for them as the  Roman  orator would ascribe to his ancestors Not to mention that the early  Romans  really exercised piracy as we learn from their first treaties with  Carthage  preserved by  Polybius  lib and consequently like the  Sall  e  and  Algerine  rovers were actually at war with most nations and a stranger and an enemy were with them almost synonimous  Not to mention the  great equality of fortunes amongst the inhabitants of the antient republics where every field belonging to a different proprietor was able to maintain a family and render'd the numbers of citizens very considerable even without trade and manufactures  BUT tho' the want of trade and manufactures amongst a free and very martial people may  sometimes  have no other effect than to render the public more powerful 'tis certain that in the common course of human affairs it will have a quite contrary tendency Sovereigns must take mankind as they find them and cannot pretend to introduce any violent change in their principles and ways of thinking A long course of time with a variety of accidents and circumstances are requisite to produce those great revolutions which so much diversify the face of human affairs And the less natural any set of principles are which support a particular society the more difficulty will a legislator  meet with in raising and cultivating them 'Tis his best policy to comply with the common bent of mankind and give it all the improvements of which it is susceptible Now according to the most natural course of things industry and arts and trade increase the power of the sovereign as well as the happiness of the subjects and that policy is violent which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of individuals This will easily appear from a few considerations which will present to us the consequences of sloth and barbarity  WHERE manufactures and mechanic arts are not cultivated the bulk of the people must apply themselves to agriculture and if their skill and industry increase there must arise a great superfluity from their labour beyond what suffices to maintain them They have no temptation therefore to increase their skill and industry since they cannot exchange that superfluity for any commodities which may serve either to their pleasure or vanity A habit of indolence naturally prevails The greater part of the land lyes uncultivated What is cultivated yields not its utmost for want of skill or assiduity in the farmers If at any time the public exigencies require that great numbers shou'd be employed in the public service the labour of the people furnishes now no superfluities by which these numbers can be maintain'd The labourers cannot increase their skill and industry on a sudden  Lands uncultivated cannot be brought into tillage for some years The armies mean while must either make sudden and violent conquests or disband for want of subsistence A regular attack or defence therefore is not to be expected from such a people and their soldiers must be as ignorant and unskilful as their farmers and manufacturers  EVERY thing in the world is purchas'd by labour and our passions are the only causes of labour When a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts the proprietors of land as well as the farmers study agriculture as a science and redouble their industry and attention The superfluity which arises from their labour is not lost but is exchang'd with the manufacturers for those commodities which mens luxury now makes them covet By this means land furnishes a great deal more of the necessaries of life than what suffices for those who cultivate it In times of peace and tranquillity this superfluity goes to the maintenance of manufacturers and the improvers of liberal arts But 'tis easy for the public to convert many of these manufacturers into soldiers and maintain them by that superfluity which arises from the labour of the farmers Accordingly we find that this is the case in all civiliz'd governments When the sovereign raises an army what is the consequence He imposes a tax This tax obliges all the people to retrench what is least necessary to their subsistence  Those who labour in such commodities must either enlist in the troops or turn themselves to agriculture and thereby oblige some labourers to enlist for want of business And to consider the matter abstractly manufactures increase the power of the state only as they store up so much labour and that of a kind which the public may lay claim to without depriving any one of the necessaries of life The more labour therefore is employ'd beyond mere necessaries the more powerful is any state since the persons engag'd in that labour may easily be converted to the public service In a state without manufactures there may be the same number of hands but there is not the same quantity of labour nor of the same kind All the labour is there bestow'd upon necessaries which can admit of little or no abatement  THUS the greatness of the sovereign and the happiness of the state are in a great measure united with regard to trade and manufactures 'Tis a violent method and in most cases impracticable to oblige the labourer to toil in order to raise from the land more than what subsists himself and family Furnish him with manufactures and commodities and he will do it of himself Afterwards you will find it easy to seize some part of his superfluous labour and employ it in the public service without giving him his wonted return Being accustom'd to labour he will think this less  grievous than if at once you oblig'd him to an augmentation of labour without any reward The case is the same with regard to the other members of the state The greater is the stock of labour of all kinds the greater quantity may be taken from the heap without making any sensible alteration upon it  A PUBLIC granary of corn a storehouse of cloth a magazine of arms all these must be allow'd to be real riches and strength in any state Trade and industry are really nothing but a stock of labour which in time of peace and tranquillity is employ'd for the ease and satisfaction of individuals but in the exigencies of state may in part be turn'd to public advantage Could we convert a city into a kind of fortified camp and infuse into each breast so martial a genius and such a passion for public good as to make every one willing to undergo the greatest hardships for the sake of the public these affections might now as in antient times prove alone a sufficient spur to industry and support the community It would then be advantageous as in camps to banish all arts and luxury and by restrictions on equipage and tables make the provisions and forage last longer than if the army were loaded with a number of superfluous retainers But as these principles are too disinterested and too difficult to support 'tis requisite to govern men by other passions and animate them with  a spirit of avarice and industry art and luxury The camp is in this case loaded with a superfluous retinue but the provisions flow in proportionably larger The harmony of the whole is still supported and the natural bent of mens minds being more complied with individuals as well as the public find their account in the observance of those maxims  THE same method of reasoning will let us see the advantage of  foreign  commerce in augmenting the power of the state as well as the riches and happiness of the subjects It increases the stock of labour in the nation and the sovereign may convert what share of it he finds necessary to the service of the public Foreign trade by its imports furnishes materials for new manufactures And by its exports it produces labour in particular commodities which could not be consum'd at home In short a kingdom that has a large import and export must abound more with labour and that upon delicacies and luxuries than a kingdom which rests contented with its native commodities It is therefore more powerful as well as richer and happier The individuals reap the benefit of these commodities so far as they gratify the senses and appetites And the public is also a gainer while a greater stock of labour is by this means stor'd up against any public exigency that is a greater number of laborious men are  maintain'd who may be diverted to the public service without robbing any one of the necessaries or even the chief conveniencies of life  IF we consult history we shall find that in most nations foreign trade has preceded any refinement in home manufactures and given birth to domestic luxury The temptation is stronger to make use of foreign commodities which are ready for use and which are entirely new to us than to make improvements on any domestic commodity which always advance by slow degrees and never affect us by their novelty The profit is also very great in exporting what is superfluous at home and what bears no price to foreign nations whose soil or climate is not favourable to that commodity Thus men become acquainted with the  pleasures  of luxury and the  profits  of commerce and their  delicacy  and  industry  being once awaken'd carry them to farther improvements in every branch of domestic as well as foreign trade And this perhaps is the chief advantage which arises from a commerce with strangers It rouses men from their lethargic indolence and presenting the gayer and more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury which they never before dream'd of raises in them a desire of a more splendid way of life than what their ancestors enjoy'd And at the same time the few merchants who possess the secret of this importation and exportation make exorbitant  profits and becoming rivals in wealth to the antient nobility tempt other adventurers to become their rivals in commerce Imitation soon diffuses all those arts while domestic manufacturers emulate the foreign in their improvements and work up every homecommodity to the utmost perfection of which it is susceptible Their own steel and iron in such laborious hands become equal to the gold and rubies of the  Indies  WHEN the affairs of the society are once brought to this situation a nation may lose most of its foreign trade and yet continue a great and powerful people If strangers will not take any particular commodity of ours we must cease to labour in it The same hands will turn themselves towards some refinement in other commodities which may be wanted at home And there must always be materials for them to work upon till every person in the state who possesses riches possesses as great plenty of homecommodities and those in as great perfection as he desires which can never possibly happen  China  is represented as one of the most flourishing empires in the world tho' it has very little commerce beyond its own territories  IT will not I hope be considered as a superfluous digression if I here observe that as the multitude of mechanical arts is advantageous so is the great number of persons to whose share the productions  of these arts fall A too great disproportion among the citizens weakens any state Every person if possible ought to enjoy the fruits of his labour in a full possession of all the necessaries and many of the conveniencies of life Noone can doubt but such an equality is most suitable to human nature and diminishes much less from the  happiness  of the rich than it adds to that of the poor It also augments the  power of the state  and makes any extraordinary taxes or impositions be paid with much more chearfulness Where the riches are engross'd by a few these must contribute very largely to the supplying the public necessities But when the riches are disperst among multitudes the burthen feels light on every shoulder and the taxes make not a very sensible difference on any one's way of living  ADD to this that where the riches are in few hands these must enjoy all the power and will readily conspire to lay the whole burthen on the poor and oppress them still farther to the discouragement of all industry  IN this circumstance consists the great advantage of  England  above any nation at present in the world or that appears in the records of any story 'Tis true the  English  feel some disadvantages in foreign trade by the high price of labour which is in part the effect of the riches of their artizans as well as of  the plenty of money But as foreign trade is not the most material circumstance 'tis not to be put in competition with the happiness of so many millions And if there were no more to endear to them that free government under which they live this alone were sufficient The poverty of the common people is a natural if not an infallible consequence of absolute monarchy tho' I doubt whether it be always true on the other hand that their riches are an infallible consequence of liberty That seems to depend on particular accidents and a certain turn of thinking in conjunction with liberty My lord  Bacon  accounting for the great advantages obtain'd by the  English  in their wars with  France  ascribes them chiefly to the superior ease and plenty of the common people amongst the former yet the governments of the two kingdoms were at that time pretty much alike Where the labourers and artizans are accustom'd to work for low wages and to retain but a small part of the fruits of their labour 'tis difficult for them even in a free government to better their condition or conspire among themselves to heighten their wages But even where they are accustom'd to a more plentiful way of life 'tis easy for the rich in a despotic government to conspire against  them  and throw the whole burthen of the taxes on their shoulders  IT may seem an odd position that the poverty of the common people in  France Italy  and  Spain  is in some measure owing to the superior riches of the soil and happiness of the climate and yet there want not many reasons to justify this paradox In such a fine mold or soil as that of those more southern regions agriculture is an easy art and one man with a couple of sorry horses will be able in a season to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty considerable rent to the proprietor All the art which the farmer knows is to leave his ground fallow for a year as soon as it is exhausted and the warmth of the sun alone and temperature of the climate enrich it and restore its fertility Such poor peasants therefore require only a simple maintenance for their labour They have no stock nor riches which claim more and at the same time they are for ever dependent on their landlord who gives no leases nor fears that his land will be spoil'd by the ill methods of cultivation In  England  the land is rich but coarse must be cultivated at a great expence and produces slender crops when not carefully manag'd and by a method which gives not the full profit but in a course of several years A farmer therefore in  England  must have a considerable stock and a long lease which beget proportional profits The fine vineyards of  Champagne  and  Burgundy  that oft yield to the landlord above five pounds  per  acre are cultivated by peasants who have scarce bread And the reason is that such peasants need no stock but their own limbs along with instruments of husbandry which they can buy for shillings The farmers are commonly in some better circumstances in those countries But the graziers are most at their ease of all those who cultivate the land The reason is still the same Men must have profits proportionable to their expence and hazard Where so considerable a number of the labouring poor as the peasants and farmers are in very low circumstances all the rest must partake of their poverty whether the government of that nation be monarchical or republican  WE may form a similar remark with regard to the general history of mankind What is the reason why no people living betwixt the tropics cou'd ever yet attain to any art or civility or reach even any police in their government and any military discipline while few nations in the temperate climates have been altogether depriv'd of these advantages 'Tis probable that one cause of this phaenomenon is the warmth and equality of weather in the torrid zone that render cloaths and houses less requisite for the inhabitants and thereby remove in part that necessity which is the great spur to industry and invention  Curis acuens mortalia corda  Not to mention that the fewer goods or possessions of this kind any people enjoy  the fewer quarrels are likely to arise amongst them and the less necessity will there be for a settled police or regular authority to protect and defend them from foreign enemies or from each other  DISCOURSE II  Of Luxury  LUXURY is a word of a very uncertain signification and may be taken in a good as well as a bad sense In general it means great refinement in the gratification of the senses and any degree of it may be innocent or blameable according to the age or country or condition of the person The bounds betwixt the virtue and the vice cannot here be fixt exactly more than in other moral subjects To imagine that the gratifying any of the senses or the indulging any delicacy in meats drinks or apparel is of itself a vice can never enter into any head that is not disorder'd by the frenzies of a fanatical enthusiasm I have indeed heard of a monk abroad who because the windows of his cell open'd upon a very noble prospect made a  covenant with his eyes  never to turn that way or receive so sensual a gratification And such is the crime of drinking  Champagne  or  Burgundy  preferably to small beer or porter These indulgences are only vices when they are pursu'd at the expence of some virtue as liberality or charity In like manner as they are follies when for them a man ruins his fortune and reduces himself to want and beggary Where they entrench upon  no virtue but leave ample subject whence to provide for friends family and every proper object of generosity or compassion they are entirely innocent and have in every age been acknowledg'd such by almost all moralists To be entirely occupy'd with the luxury of the table for instance without any relish for the pleasures of ambition study or conversation is a mark of gross stupidity and is incompatible with any vigour of temper or genius To confine one's expence entirely to such a gratification without regard to friends or family is an indication of a heart entirely devoid of humanity or benevolence But if a man reserve time sufficient for all laudable pursuits and money sufficient for all generous purposes he is free from every shadow of blame or reproach  SINCE luxury may be consider'd either as innocent or blameable one may be surpris'd at those preposterous opinions which have been entertain'd concerning it while men of libertine principles bestow praises even on vitious luxury and represent it as highly advantageous to society and on the other hand men of severe morals blame even the most innocent luxury and represent it as the source of all the corruptions disorders and factions incident to civil government We shall here endeavour to correct both these extremes by proving  first  that the ages of refinement and luxury are both the happiest and most virtuous  secondly  that wherever luxury ceases to be innocent it also ceases to be beneficial and when carry'd a degree too far is a quality pernicious tho' perhaps not the most pernicious to political society  To prove the first point we need but consider the effects of luxury both on  private  and on  public  life Human happiness according to the most receiv'd notions seems to consist in three ingredients action pleasure and indolence and tho' these ingredients ought to be mixt in different proportions according to the particular dispositions of the person yet no one ingredient can be entirely wanting without destroying in some measure the relish of the whole composition Indolence or repose indeed seems not of itself to contribute much to our enjoyment but like sleep is requisite as an indulgence to the weakness of human nature which cannot support an uninterrupted course of business or pleasure That quick march of the spirits which takes a man from himself and chiefly gives satisfaction does in the end exhaust the mind and requires some intervals of repose which tho' agreeable for a moment yet if prolong'd beget a languor and lethargy that destroy all enjoyment Education custom and example have a mighty influence in turning the mind to any of these pursuits and it must be own'd that where they promote a relish for action and pleasure they are so far favourable to human happiness In times  when industry and arts flourish men are kept in perpetual occupation and enjoy as their reward the occupation itself as well as those pleasures which are the fruits of their labour The mind acquires new vigour enlarges its powers and faculties and by an affiduity in honest industry both satisfies its natural appetites and prevents the growth of unnatural ones which commonly spring up when nourish'd with ease and idleness Banish those arts from society you deprive men both of action and of pleasure and leaving nothing but indolence in their place you even destroy the relish of indolence which never is agreeable but when it succeeds to labour and recruits the spirits exhausted by too much application and fatigue  ANOTHER advantage of industry and of refinements in the mechanical arts is that they commonly produce some refinements in the liberal arts nor can the one be carried to perfection without being accompany'd in some degree with the other The same age which produces great philosophers and politicians renown'd generals and poets usually abounds with skilful weavers and shipcarpenters We cannot reasonably expect that a piece of woolen cloth will be wrought to perfection in a nation that is ignorant of astronomy or where ethics are neglected The spirit of the age affects all the arts and the minds of men being once rous'd from their lethargy and put into a fermentation  turn themselves on all fides and carry improvements into every art and science Profound ignorance is totally banish'd and men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures to think as well as to act to cultivate the pleasures of the mind as well as those of the body  THE more these refin'd arts advance the more sociable do men become nor is it possible that when enrich'd with science and possest of a fund of conversation they should be contented to remain in solitude or live with their fellow citizens in that distant manner which is peculiar to ignorant and barbarous nations They flock into cities love to receive and communicate knowledge to show their wit or their breeding their taste in conversation or living in cloaths or furniture Curiosity allures the wise Vanity the foolish And pleasure both Particular clubs and societies are every where form'd Both sexes meet in an easy and sociable manner and mens tempers as well as behaviour refine apace So that beside the improvements they receive from knowledge and the liberal arts 'tis impossible but they must feel an increase of humanity from the very habit of conversing together and contributing to each other's pleasure and entertainment Thus  industry knowledge  and  humanity  are linkt together by an indissoluble chain and are found from experience as  well as reason to be peculiar to the more polish'd and luxurious ages  NOR are these advantages attended with disadvantages that bear any proportion to them The more men refine upon pleasure the less will they indulge in excesses of any kind because nothing is more destructive to true pleasure than such excesses One may safely affirm that the  Tartars  are oftner guilty of beastly gluttony when they feast on their dead horses than  European  courtiers with all their refinements of cookery And if libertine love or even infidelity to the marriagebed be more frequent in polite ages when it is often regarded only as a piece of gallantry drunkenness on the other hand is much less common A vice more odious and more pernicious both to mind and body And in this matter I would appeal not only to an  Ovid  or a  Petronius  but to a  Seneca  or a  Cato  We know that  Caesar  during  Cataline  's conspiracy being necessitated to put into  Cato  's hands a  billetdoux  which discover'd an intrigue with  Servilia Cato  's own sister that stern philosopher threw it back to him with indignation and in the bitterness of his wrath gave him the appellation of drunkard as a term more opprobrious than that with which he cou'd more justly have reproach'd him  BUT industry knowledge and humanity are not advantageous in private life alone They diffuse their beneficial influence on the  Public  and render  the government as great and flourishing as they make individuals happy and prosperous The encrease and consumption of all the commodities which serve to the ornament and pleasure of life are advantageous to society because at the same time that they multiply those innocent gratifications to individuals they are a kind of  storehouse  of labour which in the exigencies of state may be turn'd to the public service In a nation where there is no demand for such superfluities men sink into indolence lose all the enjoyment of life and are useless to the public which cannot maintain nor support its fleets and armies from the industry of such slothful members  THE bounds of all the  European  kingdoms are at present pretty near the same they were two hundred years ago But what a difference is there in the power and grandeur of those kingdoms Which can be ascrib'd to nothing but the encrease of art and industry When  Charles  the VIII of  France  invaded  Italy  he carry'd with him about men And yet this armament so exhausted the nation as we learn from  Guicciardin  that for some years it was not able to make so great an effort The late king of  France  in time of war kept in pay above men  The inscription on the  PlacedeVendome  says  tho' from  Mazarine  's death to his own he was engag'd in a course of wars that lasted near thirty years  THIS industry is much promoted by the knowledge inseparable from the ages of arts and luxury as on the other hand this knowledge enables the public to make the best advantage of the industry of its subjects Laws order police discipline these can never be carry'd to any degree of perfection before human reason has refin'd itself by exercise and by an application to the more vulgar arts at least of commerce and manufactures Can we expect that a government will be well model'd by a people who know not how to make a spinning wheel or to employ a loom to advantage Not to mention that all ignorant ages are infested with superstition which throws the government off its bias and disturbs men in the pursuit of their interest and happiness  KNOWLEDGE in the arts of government naturally begets mildness and moderation by instructing men in the advantages of humane maxims above rigour and severity which drive subjects into rebellion and render the return to submission impracticable by cutting off all hopes of pardon When mens temper is soften'd as well as their knowledge improv'd this humanity appears still more conspicuous and is the chief characteristic that distinguishes a civiliz'd age from times of barbarity and ignorance Factions are then less inveterate revolutions less tragical authority less severe  and seditions less frequent Even foreign wars abate of their cruelty and after the field of battle where honour and interest steel men against compassion as well as fear the combatants divest themselves of the brute and resume the man  NOR need we fear that men by losing their ferocity will lose their martial spirit or become less undaunted and vigorous in defence of their country or their liberty The arts have no such effect in enervating either the mind or body On the contrary industry their inseparable attendant adds new force to both And if anger which is said to be the whetstone of courage loses somewhat of its asperity by politeness and refinement a sense of honour which is a stronger more constant and more governable principle acquires fresh vigour by that elevation of genius which arises from knowledge and a good education Add to this that courage can neither have any duration nor be of any use when not accompany'd with discipline and martial skill which are seldom found among a barbarous people The antients remark'd that  Datames  was the only barbarian that ever knew the art of war And  Pyrrhus  seeing the  Romans  marshal their army with some art and skill said with surprize  These barbarians have nothing barbarous in their discipline  'Tis observable that as the old  Romans  by applying themselves solely to war were the only unciviliz'd people that  ever possest military discipline so the modern  Italians  are the only civiliz'd people among  Europeans  that ever wanted courage and a martial spirit Those who wou'd ascribe this effeminacy of the  Italians  to their luxury or politeness or application to the arts need but consider the  French  and  English  whose bravery is as uncontestable as their love of luxury and their assiduity in commerce The  Italian  historians give us a more satisfactory reason for this degeneracy of their countrymen They shew us how the sword was dropt at once by all the  Italian  sovereigns while the  Venetian  aristocracy was jealous of its subjects the  Florentine  democracy apply'd itself entirely to commerce  Rome  was govern'd by priests and  Naples  by women War then became the business of soldiers of fortune who spar'd one another and to the astonishment of the world cou'd engage a whole day in what they call'd a battle and return at night to their camps without the least bloodshed  WHAT has chiefly induc'd severe moralists to declaim against luxury and refinement in pleasure is the example of antient  Rome  which joining to its poverty and rusticity virtue and public spirit rose to such a surprising height of grandeur and liberty but having learn'd from its conquer'd provinces the  Grecian  and  Asiatic  luxury fell into every kind of corruption whence arose sedition and civil wars attended at last with the total loss of liberty  All the  Latin  classics whom we peruse in our infancy are full of these sentiments and universally ascribe the ruin of their state to the arts and riches imported from the East insomuch that  Sallust  represents a taste for painting as a vice no less than lewdness and drinking And so popular were these sentiments during the latter ages of the republic that this author abounds in praises of the old rigid  Roman  virtue tho' himself the most egregious instance of modern luxury and corruption speaks contemptuously of  Grecian  eloquence tho' the most elegant writer in the world nay employs preposterous digressions and declamations to this purpose tho' a model of taste and correctness  BUT it would be easy to prove that these writers mistook the cause of the disorders in the  Roman  state and ascrib'd to luxury and the arts what really proceeded from an ill model'd government and the unlimited extent of conquests Luxury or refinement on pleasure has no natural tendency to beget venality and corruption The value which all men put upon any particular pleasure depends on comparison and experience nor is a porter less greedy of money which he spends on bacon and brandy than a courtier who purchases champagne and ortolans Riches are valuable at all times and to all men because they always purchase pleasures such as men are accustom'd to and desire nor can any thing restrain or regulate the love of money but  a sense of honour and virtue which if it be not nearly equal at all times will naturally abound most in ages of luxury and knowledge  OF all  European  kingdoms  Poland  seems the most defective in the arts of war as well as peace mechanical as well as liberal and yet 'tis there that venality and corruption do most prevail The nobles seem to have preserv'd their crown elective for no other purpose but regularly to sell it to the highest bidder This is almost the only species of commerce with which that people are acquainted  THE liberties of  England  so far from decaying since the origin of luxury and the arts have never flourish'd so much as during that period And tho' corruption may seem to encrease of late years this is chiefly to be ascrib'd to our establish'd liberty when our princes have found the impossibility of governing without parliaments or of terrifying parliaments by the fantom of prerogative Not to mention that this corruption or venality prevails infinitely more among the electors than the elected and therefore cannot justly be ascrib'd to any refinements in luxury  IF we consider the matter in a proper light we shall find that luxury and the arts are rather favourable to liberty and have a natural tendency to preserve if not produce a free government In  rude unpolish'd nations where the arts are neglected all the labour is bestow'd on the cultivation of the ground and the whole society divides into two classes proprietors of land and their vassals or tenants The latter are necessarily dependent and fitted for slavery and subjection especially where they possess no riches and are not valu'd for their knowledge in agriculture as must always be the case where the arts are neglected The former naturally erect themselves into petty tyrants and must either submit to an absolute master for the sake of peace and order or if they will preserve their independency like the  Gothic  barons they must fall into feuds and contests amongst themselves and throw the whole society into such confusion as is perhaps worse than the most despotic government But where luxury nourishes commerce and industry the peasants by a proper cultivation of the land become rich and independent while the tradesmen and merchants acquire a share of the property and draw authority and consideration to that middling rank of men who are the best and firmest basis of public liberty These submit not to slavery like the poor peasants from poverty and meanness of spirit and having no hopes of tyrannizing over others like the barons they are not tempted for the sake of that gratification to submit to the tyranny of their sovereign They covet equal laws which may secure their property  and preserve them from monarchical as well as aristocratical tyranny  THE house of commons is the support of our popular government and all the world acknowledge that it ow'd its chief influence and consideration to the encrease of commerce which threw such a balance of property into the hands of the commons How inconsistent then is it to blame so violently luxury or a refinement in the arts and to represent it as the bane of liberty and public spirit  TO declaim against present times and magnify the virtue of remote ancestors is a propensity almost inherent in human nature and as the sentiments and opinions of civiliz'd ages alone are transmitted to posterity hence it is that we meet with so many severe judgments pronounc'd against luxury and even science and hence it is that at present we give so ready an assent to them But the fallacy is easily perceiv'd from comparing different nations that are contemporaries where we both judge more impartially and can better set in opposition those manners with which we are sufficiently acquainted Treachery and cruelty the most pernicious and most odious of all vices seem peculiar to unciviliz'd ages and by the refin'd  Greeks  and  Romans  were ascrib'd to all the barbarous nations which surrounded them They  might justly therefore have presum'd that their own ancestors so highly celebrated possest no greater virtue and were as much inferior to their posterity in honour and humanity as in taste and science An antient  Frank  or  Saxon  may be highly extoll'd But I believe every man would think his life or fortune much less secure in the hands of a  Moor  or  Tartar  than in those of a  French  or  English  gentleman the rank of men the most civiliz'd in the most civiliz'd nations  WE come now to the  second  position which we propos'd to illustrate  viz  that as innocent luxury or a refinement in pleasure is advantageous to the public so wherever luxury ceases to be innocent it also ceases to be beneficial and when carry'd a degree farther begins to be a quality pernicious tho' perhaps not the most pernicious to political society  LET us consider what we call vicious luxury No gratification however sensual can of itself be esteem'd vicious A gratification is only vicious when it engrosses all a man's expence and leaves no ability for such acts of duty and generosity as are requir'd by his situation and fortune Suppose that he correct the vice and employ part of his expence in the education of his children in the support of his friends and in relieving the poor would any prejudice result to society On the contrary  the same consumption would arise and that labour which at present is employ'd only in producing a slender gratification to one man would relieve the necessitous and bestow satisfaction on hundreds The same care and toil which raise a dish of peas at  Christmas  would give bread to a whole family during six months To say that without a vicious luxury the labour would not have been employ'd at all is only to say that there is some other defect in human nature such as indolence selfishness inattention to others for which luxury in some measure provides a remedy as one poison may be an antidote to another But virtue like wholesome food is better than poisons however corrected  SUPPOSE the same number of men that are at present in  Britain  with the same soil and climate I ask is it not possible for them to be happier by the most perfect way of life that can be imagin'd and by the greatest reformation which omnipotence itself could work in their temper and disposition To assert that they cannot appears evidently ridiculous As the land is able to maintain more than all its inhabitants they cou'd never in such an  Utopian  state feel any other ills than those which arise from bodily sickness and these are not the half of human miseries All other ills spring from some vice either in ourselves or others and even many of our diseases proceed from the same  origin Remove the vices and the ills follow You must only take care to remove all the vices If you remove part you may render the matter worse By banishing  vicious  luxury without curing sloth and an indifference to others you only diminish industry in the state and add nothing to mens charity or their generosity Let us therefore rest contented with asserting that two opposite vices in a state may be more advantageous than either of them alone but let us never pronounce vice in it self advantageous Is it not very inconsistent for an author to assert in one page that moral distinctions are inventions of politicians for public interest and in the next page maintain that vice is advantageous to the public  Fable of the hees  And indeed it seems upon any system of morality little less than a contradiction in terms to talk of a vice that is in general beneficial to society  I THOUGHT this reasoning necessary in order to give some light to a philosophical question which has been much disputed in  Britain  I call it a  philosophical  question not a  political  one For whatever may be the consequence of such a miraculous transformation of mankind as would endow them with every species of virtue and free them from every vice this concerns not the magistrate who aims only at possibilities He cannot cure every vice by substituting a virtue in its place Very  often he can only cure one vice by another and in that case he ought to prefer what is least pernicious to society Luxury when excessive is the source of many ills but is in general preferable to sloth and idleness which wou'd commonly succeed in its place and are more pernicious both to private persons and to the public When sloth reigns a mean uncultivated way of life prevails amongst individuals without society without enjoyment And if the sovereign in such a situation demands the service of his subjects the labour of the state suffices only to furnish the necessaries of life to the labourers and can afford nothing to those who are employ'd in the public service  DISCOURSE III  Of Money  MONEY is not properly speaking one of the subjects of commerce but only the instrument which men have agreed upon to facilitate the exchange of one commodity for another 'Tis none of the wheels of trade 'Tis the oil which renders the motion of the wheels more smooth and easy If we consider any one kingdom by itself 'tis evident that the greater or less plenty of money is of no consequence since the prices of commodities are always proportion'd to the plenty of money and a crown in  Harry  the VII's time serv'd the same purpose as a pound does at present 'Tis only the  public  that draws any advantage from the greater plenty of money and that only in its wars and negociations with foreign states And this is the reason why all rich and trading countries from  Carthage  to  Britain  and  Holland  have employ'd mercenary troops which they hir'd from their poorer neighbours Were they to make use of their native subjects they would find less advantage from their superior riches and from their great plenty of gold and silver since the pay of all their servants must rise in proportion to the public opulence Our small army in  Britain  of men are maintain'd at as great expence as a  French  army thrice as numerous The  English  fleet during the late war requir'd as much money to support it as all the  Roman  legions which kept the whole world in subjection during the time of the emperors  APRIVATE soldier in the  Roman  infantry had a denarius a day somewhat less than pence The  Roman  emperors had commonly legions in pay which allowing men to a legion makes  Tacit ann lib  'Tis true there were also auxiliaries to the legions but their numbers are uncertain as well as their pay To consider only the legionaries the pay of the private men could not exceed pound Now the parliament in the last war commonly allow'd for the fleet We have therefore over for the officers and other expences of the  Roman  legions There seem to have been but few officers in the  Roman  armies in comparison of what are employ'd in all our modern troops except some  Swiss  corps And these officers had very small pay A centurion for instance only double a common soldier And as the soldiers from their pay  Tacit ann lib  bought their own cloaths arms tents and baggage this must also diminish considerably the other charges of the army So little expensive was that mighty government and so easy was its yoke over the world And indeed this is the more natural conclusion from the foregoing calculations For money after the conquest of  Egypt  seems to have been nearly in as great plenty at  Rome  as it is at present in the richest of the  European  kingdoms  THE greater number of people and their greater industry are serviceable in all cases at home and abroad in private and in public But the greater plenty of money is very limited in its use and may even sometimes be a loss to a nation in its commerce with foreigners  THERE seems to be a happy concurrence of causes in human affairs which check the growth of trade and riches and hinder them from being confin'd entirely to one people as might naturally at first be dreaded from the advantages of an establish'd commerce Where one nation has got the start of another in trade 'tis very difficult for the latter to regain the ground it has lost because of the superior industry and skill of the former and the greater stocks which its merchants are possest' of and which enable them to trade for so much smaller profits But these advantages are compensated in some measure by the low prices of labour in every nation that has not an extensive commerce and does not very much abound in gold and silver Manufactures therefore gradually shift their places leaving those countries and provinces which they have already enrich'd and flying to others whither they are allur'd by the cheapness of provisions and labour till they have enrich'd these also and are again banish'd by the same causes And in general we may observe that the dearness of every thing from plenty of money is a disadvantage that attends an establish'd commerce and sets bounds to it in every country by enabling the poorer states to undersell the richer in all foreign markets  THIS has made me entertain a great doubt concerning the benefit of  banks  and  paper credit  which  are so generally esteem'd advantageous to every nation That provisions and labour shou'd become dear by the encrease of trade and money is in many respects an inconvenience but an inconvenience that is unavoidable and the effect of that public wealth and prosperity which are the end of all our wishes 'Tis compensated by the advantages we reap from the possession of these precious metals and the weight which they give the nation in all foreign wars and negotiations But there appears no reason for encreasing that inconvenience by a counterfeit money which foreigners will never accept of and which any great disorder in the state will reduce to nothing There are 'tis true many people in every rich state who having large sums of money wou'd prefer paper with good security as being of more easy transport and more safe custody If the public provide not a bank private bankers will take advantage of this circumstance as the goldsmiths formerly did in  London  or as the bankers do at present in  Dublin  And therefore 'tis better it may be thought that a public company should enjoy the benefit of that paper credit which always will have place in every opulent kingdom But to endeavour artificially to encrease such a credit can never be the interest of any trading nation but must lay them under disadvantages by encreasing money beyond its natural proportion to labour and commodities and thereby heightening their price to the merchant  and manufacturer And in this view it must be allow'd that no bank cou'd be more advantageous than such a one as lockt up all the money it receiv'd and never augmented the circulating coin as is usual by returning part of its treasure into commerce A public bank by this expedient might cut off much of the dealings of private bankers and money jobbers and tho' the state bore the charge of salaries to the directors and tellers of this bank for according to the preceeding supposition it would have no profit from its dealings the national advantage resulting from the low price of labour and the destruction of paper credit would be a sufficient compensation Not to mention that so large a sum lying ready at command would be a great convenience in times of public danger and distress and might be replac'd at leisure when peace and tranquillity were restor'd to the nation  BUT of this subject of paper credit we shall treat more largely hereafter And I shall finish this essay of money by proposing and explaining two observations which may perhaps serve to employ the thought of our speculative politicians For to these only I all along address myself 'Tis enough that I submit to the ridicule sometimes in this age attach'd to the character of a philosopher without adding to it that which belongs to a projector  I 'T WAS a shrewd observation of  Anacharsis  Plut  Quomodo quis suos profectus in virtute sentire possit  the  Scythian  who had never seen money in his own country that gold and silver seem'd to him of no use to the  Greeks  but to assist them in numeration and arithmetic 'Tis indeed evident that money is nothing but the representation of labour and commodities and serves only as a method of rating or estimating them Where coin is in greater plenty as a greater quantity of it is then requir'd to represent the same quantity of goods it can have no effect either good or bad taking a nation within itself no more than it wou'd make any alteration on a merchant's books if instead of the  Arabian  method of notation which requires few characters he shou'd make use of the  Roman  which requires a great many Nay the greater plenty of money like the  Roman  characters is rather inconvenient and troublesome and requires greater care to keep and transport it But notwithstanding this conclusion which must be allowed just 'tis certain that since the discover of the mines in  America  industry has encreas'd in all the nations of  Europe  except in the possessors of those mines and this may justly be ascrib'd amongst other reasons to the encrease of gold and silver Accordingly we find that in every kingdom into which money begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly every thing takes a new face labour and  industry gain life the merchant becomes more enterprizing the manufacturer more diligent and skillful and even the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity and attention This is not easily to be accounted for if we consider only the influence which a greater abundance of coin has in the kingdom itself by heightening the price of commodities and obliging every one to pay a greater number of these little yellow or white pieces for every thing he purchases And as to foreign trade it appears that great plenty of money is rather disadvantageous by raising the price of every kind of labour  To account then for this phaenomenon we must consider that tho' the high price of commodities be a necessary consequence of the encrease of gold and silver yet it follows not immediately upon that encrease but some time is requir'd before the money circulate thro' the whole state and make its effects be felt on all ranks of people At first no alteration is perceiv'd by degrees it raises the price first of one commodity then of another till the whole at last rises to a just proportion with the new quantity of specie which is in the kingdom In my opinion 'tis only in this interval or intermediate situation betwixt the acquisition of money and rise of prices that the encreasing quantity of gold and silver is favourable to industry When any quantity of money is imported into a nation it is  not at first disperst into many hands but is confin'd to the coffers of a few persons who immediately seek to employ it to the best advantage Here are a set of manufacturers or merchants we shall suppose who have receiv'd returns of gold and silver for goods which they sent to  Cadiz  They are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than formerly who never dream of demanding higher wages but are glad of employment from such good paymasters If workmen become scarce the manufacturer gives higher wages but at first requires an encrease of labour and this is willingly submitted to by the artizan who can now eat and drink better to compensate his additional toil and fatigue He carries his money to market where he finds every thing at the same price as formerly but returns with greater quantity and of better kinds for the use of his family The farmer and gardener finding that all their commodities are taken off apply themselves with alacrity to the raising of more and at the same time can afford to take better and more cloaths from their tradesmen whose price is the same as formerly and their industry only whetted by so much new gain 'Tis easy to trace the money in its progress thro' the whole commonwealth where we shall find that it must first quicken the diligence of every individual before it encrease the price of labour  AND that the specie may encrease to a considerable pitch before it have this latter effect appears amongst other reasons from the frequent operations of the  French  king on the money where it was always found that the augmenting the numerary value did not produce a proportional rise of the prices at least for some time In the last year of  Louis  the XIV money was rais'd three sevenths but prices augmented only one Corn in  France  is now sold at the same price or for the same number of livres it was in tho' silver was then at livres the mark and is now at  THESE facts I give upon the authority of  Mons de Tot  in his  Reflections politiques  an author of reputation Tho' I must confess that the facts which he advances on other occasions are often so suspicious as to make his authority less in this matter However the general observation that the augmenting the money in  France  does not at first proportionably augment the prices is certainly just  By the bye this seems to be one of the best reasons for a gradual and universal augmentation of the money which can be given tho' it has been entirely overlook'd in all those volumes which have been wrote on that question by  Melon Du Tot  and  Paris de Verney  Were all our money for instance recoin'd and a penny's worth of silver taken from every shilling the new shilling wou'd probably purchase every thing that cou'd have been bought by the old the prices of every thing wou'd thereby be insensibly diminish'd foreign trade enliven'd and domestic industry by the circulation of a greater number of pounds and shillings wou'd receive some encrease and encouragement In executing such a project 'twou'd be better to make the new shilling pass for halfpence in order to preserve the illusion and make it be taken for the same  Not to mention the  great addition of gold and silver which may have come into that kingdom since the former period  FROM the whole of this reasoning we may conclude that 'tis of no manner of consequence with regard to the domestic happiness of a state whether money be in a greater or less quantity The good policy of the magistrate consists only in keeping it if possible still encreasing because by that means he keeps a spirit of industry alive in the nation and encreases the stock of labour wherein consists all real power and riches A nation whose money decreases is actually at that time much weaker and more miserable than another nation who possesses no more money but is on the encreasing hand This will be easily accounted for if we consider that the alterations in the quantity of money either on the one side or the other are not immediately attended with proportionable alterations in the prices of commodities There is always an interval before matters be adjusted to their new situation and this interval is as pernicious to industry when gold and silver are diminishing as it is advantageous when these metals are encreasing The workman has not the same employment from the manufacturer and merchant tho' he pays the same price for every thing in the market The farmer cannot dispose of his corn and cattle tho' he must pay the same rent to his landlord The  poverty and beggary and sloth which must ensue are easily foreseen  II The  second  observation I propos'd to make with regard to money may be explain'd after the following manner There are some kingdoms and many provinces in  Europe  and all of them were once in the same condition where money is so scarce that the landlord can get none at all from his tenants but is oblig'd to take his rent in kind and either to consume it himself or transport it to places where he may find a market In those countries the prince can levy few or no taxes but in the same manner And as he will receive very small benefit from impositions so pay'd 'tis evident that such a kingdom has very little force even at home and cannot maintain fleets and armies to the same extent as if every part of it abounded in gold and silver There is surely a greater disproportion betwixt the force of  Germany  at present and what it was three centuries ago  THE  Italians  gave to the emperor  Maximilian  the nickname of  Pocchidanari  None of the enterprises of that prince ever succeeded for want of money  than there is in its industry people and manfactures The  Austrian  dominions in the empire are in general well peopled and well cultivated and are of great extent but have not a proportionable weight in the balance of  Europe  proceeding as is commonly suppos'd from their scarcity of money How do all these facts agree with that principle of  reason that the quantity of gold and silver is in itself altogether indifferent According to that principle wherever a sovereign has numbers of subjects and these have plenty of commodities he shou'd of course be great and powerful and they rich and happy independent of the greater or lesser abundance of the precious metals These admit of divisions and subdivisions to a great extent and where they wou'd become so small as to be in danger of being lost 'tis easy to mix them with a baser metal as is practis'd in some countries of  Europe  and by that means raise them to a bulk more sensible and convenient They still serve the same purposes of exchange whatever their number may be or whatever colour they may be suppos'd to have  To these difficulties I answer that the effect here suppos'd to flow from scarcity of money really arises from the manners and customs of the inhabitants and that we mistake as is usual a collateral effect for a cause The contradiction is only apparent but it requires some thought and reflection to discover the principles by which we can reconcile  reason  to  experience  It seems a maxim almost selfevident that the prices of every thing depend on the proportion betwixt commodities and money and that any considerable alteration on either of these has the same  effect either of heightening or diminishing the price Encrease the commodities they become cheaper Encrease the money they rise in their value As on the other hand a diminution of the former and that of the latter have contrary tendencies  'TIS also evident that the prices do not so much depend on the absolute quantity of commodities and of money which are in a nation as on that of the commodities which come or may come to market and of the money which circulates If the coin be lockt up in chests 'tis the same thing with regard to prices as if it were annihilated If the commodities be hoarded in granaries a like effect follows As the money and commodities in these cases never meet they cannot affect each other Were we at any time to form conjectures concerning the prices of provisions the corn which the farmer must reserve for the maintenance of himself and family ought never to enter into the estimation 'Tis only the overplus compar'd to the demand that determines the value  To apply these principles we must consider that in the first and more uncultivated ages of any state e're fancy has confounded her wants with those of nature men contented with the productions of their own fields or with those rude preparations which they themselves can work upon  them have little occasion for exchange or at least for money which by agreement is the common measure of exchange The wool of the farmer's own flock spun in his own family and wrought by a neighbouring weaver who receives his payment in corn or wool suffices for furniture and cloathing The carpenter the smith the mason the taylor are retain'd by wages of a like nature and the landlord himself dwelling in the neighbourhood is contented to receive his rent in the commodities rais'd by the farmer The greatest part of these he consumes at home in rustic hospitality The rest perhaps he disposes of for money to the neighbouring town whence he draws the materials of his expence and luxury  BUT after men begin to refine on all these enjoyments and live not always at home nor are contented with what can be rais'd in their neighbourhood there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds and more money enters into that exchange The tradesmen will not be paid in corn because they want something more than barely to eat The farmer goes beyond his own parish for the commodities he purchases and cannot always carry his commodities to the merchant who supplies him The landlord lives in the capital or in a foreign country and demands his rent in gold and silver which can easily be transported to him Great undertakers and manufacturers and merchants  arise in every commodity and these can conveniently deal in nothing but in specie And consequently in this situation of society the coin enters into many more contracts and by that means is much more employ'd than in the former  THE necessary effect is that provided the money does not encrease in the nation every thing must become much cheaper in times of industry and refinement than in rude uncultivated ages 'Tis the proportion betwixt the money that circulates and the commodities in the market that determines the prices Goods that are consum'd at home or exchang'd with other goods in the neighbourhood never come to market they affect not in the least the current specie with regard to it they are as if totally annihilated and consequently this method of using them sinks the proportion on the side of the commodities and encreases the prices But after money enters into all contracts and sales and is every where the measure of exchange the same national cash has a much greater task to perform all commodities are then in the market the sphere of circulation is enlarg'd 'tis the same case as if that individual sum were to serve a larger kingdom and therefore the proportion being here diminish'd on the side of the money every thing must become cheaper and the prices gradually fall  BY the most exact computations that have been form'd all over  Europe  after making allowance for the change in the numerary value or the denomination 'tis found that the prices of all things have only risen three or at most four times since the discovery of the  West Indies  But will any one assert that there is no more than four times the coin in  Europe  that was in the fifteenth century and the centuries preceding it The  Spaniards  and  Portuguese  from their mines the  English French  and  Dutch  by their  African  trade and by their interlopers in the  West Indies  bring home about seven millions a year of which not above a tenth part goes to the  East Indies  This sum alone in five years would probably double the antient stock of money in  Europe  And no other satisfactory reason can be given why all prices have not risen to a much more exorbitant height except that deriv'd from a change of customs and manners Besides that more commodities are produc'd by additional industry the same commodities come more to market after men depart from their antient simplicity of manners And tho' this encrease has not been equal to that of money it has however been considerable and has preserv'd the proportion betwixt coin and commodities nearer the antient standard  WERE the question propos'd which of these methods of living in the people the simple or the  refin'd is the most advantageous to the state or public I shou'd without much scruple prefer the latter in a view to politics at least and should produce this as an additional reason for the encouragement of trade and manufactures  WHEN men live in the antient simple manner and supply all their necessities from their domestic industry or from the neighbourhood the sovereign can levy no taxes in money from a considerable part of his subjects and if he will impose on them any burthens he must take his payment in commodities with which alone they abound a method attended with such great and obvious inconveniencies that they need not here be insisted on All the money he can pretend to raise must be from his principal cities where alone it circulates and these 'tis evident cannot afford him so much as the whole state cou'd did gold and silver circulate thro' the whole But besides this obvious diminution of the revenue there is also another cause of the poverty of the public in such a situation Not only the sovereign receives less money but the same money goes not so far as in times of industry and general commerce Every thing is dearer where the gold and silver are suppos'd equal and that because fewer commodities come to market and the whole coin bears a higher proportion to what is to be purchas'd by it  whence alone the prices of every thing are fix'd and determin'd  HERE then we may learn the fallacy of the remark often to be met with in historians and even in common conversation that any particular state is weak tho' fertile populous and well cultivated merely because it wants money It appears that the want of money can never injure any state within itself For men and commodities are the real strength of any community 'Tis the simple manner of living which here hurts the public by confining the gold and silver to few hands and preventing its universal diffusion and circulation On the contrary industry and refinements of all kinds incorporate it with the whole state however small its quantity may be They digest it into every vein so to speak and make it enter into every transaction and contract No hand is entirely empty of it and as the prices of every thing fall by that means the sovereign has a double advantage He may draw money by his taxes from every part of the state and what he receives goes farther in every purchase and payment  WE may infer from a comparison of prices that money is not more plentiful in  China  than it was in  Europe  three centuries ago But what immense power is that empire possest of if we may judge by the civil and military list maintain'd by  it  Polybius  Lib cap  tells us that provisions were so cheap in  Italy  during his time that in some places the stated club in the inns was a  semis  a head little more than a farthing Yet the  Roman  power had even then subdu'd the whole known world About a century before that period the  Carthaginian  ambassadors said by way of raillery that no people liv'd more sociably amongst themselves than the  Romans  for that in every entertainment which as foreign ministers they receiv'd they still observ'd the same plate at every table  Plin  lib cap  The absolute quantity of the precious metals is a matter of great indifference There are only two circumstances of any importance  viz  their gradual encrease and their thorough concoction and circulation thro' the state and the influence of both these circumstances has been here explained  IN the following discourse we shall see an instance of a like fallacy as that above mention'd where a collateral effect is taken for a cause and where a consequence is ascrib'd to the plenty of money tho' it be really owing to a change in the manners and customs of the people  DISCOURSE IV  Of Interest  NOTHING is esteem'd a more certain sign of the flourishing condition of any nation than the lowness of interest And with reason tho' I believe the cause is somewhat different from what is commonly apprehended The lowness of interest is generally ascrib'd to the plenty of money But money however plentiful has no other effect  if fixt  than to raise the price of labour Silver is more common than gold and therefore you receive a greater quantity of it for the same commodities But do you pay less interest for it Interest in  Batavia  and  Jamaica  is at  per cent  in  Portugal  at tho' these places as we may learn from the prices of every thing abound much more in gold and silver than either  London  or  Amsterdam  WERE all the gold in  England  annihilated at once and one and twenty shillings substituted in the place of every guinea wou'd money be more plentiful or interest lower No surely We shou'd only use silver instead of gold Were gold render'd as common as silver and silver as common as copper would money be more plentiful or interest  lower We may assuredly give the same answer Our shillings would then be yellow and our halfpence white and we shou'd have no guineas No other difference wou'd ever be observ'd No alteration on commerce manufactures navigation or interest unless we imagine that the colour of the metal is of any consequence  NOW what is so visible in these greater variations of scarcity or abundance of the precious metals must hold in all inferior changes If the multiplying gold and silver fifteen times makes no difference much less can the doubling or tripling them All augmentation has no other effect than to heighten the price of labour and commodities and even this variation is little more than that of a name In the progress towards these changes the augmentation may have some influence by exciting industry but after the prices are settled suitable to the new abundance of gold and silver it has no manner of influence  AN effect always holds proportion with its cause Prices have risen about four times since the discovery of the  Indies  and 'tis probable gold and silver have multiply'd much more But interest has not fallen much above half The rate of interest therefore is not deriv'd from the quantity of the precious metals  MONEY having merely a fictitious value arising from the agreement and convention of men the greater or less plenty of it is of no consequence if we consider a nation within itself and when once fixt tho' in never so great abundance it has no other effect than to oblige every one to tell out a greater number of those shining bits of metal for cloaths furniture or equipage without encreasing any one convenience of life If a man borrows money to build a house he then carries home a greater load because the stone timber lead glass  c  with the labour of the masons and carpenters are represented by a greater quantity of gold and silver But as these metals are consider'd merely as representations there can no alteration arise from their bulk or quantity their weight or colour either upon their real value or their interest The same interest in all cases bears the same proportion to the sum And if you lent me so much labour and so many commodities by receiving five  per cent  you receive always proportional labour and commodities however represented whether by yellow or white coin whether by a pound or an ounce 'Tis in vain therefore to look for the cause of the fall or rise of interest in the greater or less quantity of gold and silver which is fixt in any nation  HIGH interest arises from  three  circumstances A great demand for borrowing little riches to supply that demand and great profits arising from commerce And these circumstances are a clear proof of the small advance of commerce and industry not of the scarcity of gold and silver Low interest on the other hand proceeds from the three opposite circumstances A small demand for borrowing great riches to supply that demand and small profits arising from commerce And these circumstances are all connected together and proceed from the encrease of industry and commerce not of gold and silver We shall endeavour to prove these points as fully and distinctly as possible and shall begin with the causes and the effects of a great or small demand for borrowing  WHEN a people have emerg'd ever so little from a state of barbarity and their numbers have encreas'd beyond the original multitude there must immediately arise an inequality of property and while some possess large tracts of land others are confin'd within narrow limits and some are entirely without any landed property Those who possess more land than they can labour employ those who possess none and agree to receive a determinate part of the product Thus the  landed  interest is immediately establish'd nor is there any settled government however rude wherein  affairs are not on this footing Of these proprietors of land some must presently discover themselves to be of different tempers from others and while one wou'd willingly store up the product of his land for futurity another desires to consume at present what shou'd suffice for many years But as the spending a settled revenue is a way of life entirely without occupation men have so much need of somewhat to fix and engage them that pleasures such as they are will be the pursuit of the greatest part of the landholders and the prodigals amongst them will always be more numerous than the misers In a state therefore where there is nothing but a landed interest as there is little frugality the borrowers must be very numerous and the rate of interest must hold proportion to it The difference depends not on the quantity of money but on the habits and manners which prevail By this alone the demand for borrowing is encreas'd or diminish'd Were money so plentiful as to make an egg be sold for sixpence as long as there are only landed gentry and peasants in the state the borrowers must be numerous and interest high The rent for the same farm wou'd be heavier and more bulky But the same idleness of the landlord with the higher prices of commodities wou'd dissipate it in the same time and produce the same necessity and demand for borrowing  I HAVE been inform'd by a very eminent lawyer and a man of great knowledge and observation that it appears from antient papers and records that about four centuries ago money in  Scotland  and probably in other parts of  Europe  was only at five  per cent  and afterwards rose to ten before the discovery of the  West Indies  This fact is curious but might easily be reconcil'd to the foregoing reasoning Men in that age liv'd so much at home and in so very simple and frugal a manner that they had no occasion for money and tho' the lenders were then few the borrowers were still fewer The high rate of interest among the early  Romans  is accounted for by historians from the frequent losses sustain'd by the inroads of the enemy  NOR is the case different with regard to the  second  circumstance we propos'd to consider  viz  the great or little riches to supply this demand This effect also depends on the habits and ways of living of the people not on the quantity of gold and silver In order to have in any state a great number of lenders 'tis not sufficient nor requisite that there be great abundance of the precious metals 'Tis only requisite that the property or command of that quantity which is in the state whether great or small should be collected in particular hands so as to form considerable sums or compose a great money'd interest This begets a number of lenders and sinks the rate of usury and this I shall venture to affirm depends not on the quantity of specie but on particular manners and customs which make the specie gather into separate sums or masses of considerable value  FOR suppose that by miracle every man in  Britain  shou'd have five pounds slipt into his pocket in one night this wou'd much more than  double the whole money that is at present in the kingdom and yet there would not next day nor for some time be any more lenders nor any variation on the interest And were there nothing but landlords and peasants in the state this money however abundant cou'd never gather into sums and wou'd only serve to encrease the prices of every thing without any farther consequence The prodigal landlord dissipates it as fast as he receives it and the beggarly peasant has no means nor view nor ambition of obtaining above a bare livelihood The overplus of borrowers above that of lenders continuing still the same there will follow no reduction of interest That depends upon another principle and must proceed from an encrease of industry and frugality of arts and commerce  EVERY thing useful to the life of man arises from the ground but few things arise in that condition which is requisite to render them useful There must therefore beside the peasants and the proprietors of land be another rank of men who receiving from the former the rude materials work them into their proper form and retain part for their own use and subsistence In the infancy of society these contracts betwixt the artizans and the peasants and betwixt one species of artizan and another are commonly enter'd into immediately by the persons themselves who being neighbours are readily acquainted with each other's necessities  and can lend their mutual assistance to supply them But when mens industry encreases and their views enlarge 'tis found that the most remote parts of the state can assist each other as well as the more contiguous and that this intercourse of good offices may be carry'd on to the greatest extent and intricacy Hence the origin of  merchants  the most useful race of men in the whole society who serve as agents betwixt those parts of the state that are wholly unacquainted and are ignorant of each other's necessities Here are in a city fifty workmen in silk and linen and a thousand customers and these two ranks of men so necessary to each other can never rightly meet 'till one man erects a shop to which all the workmen and all the customers repair In this province grass rises in abundance The inhabitants abound in cheese and butter and cattle but want bread and corn which in a neighbouring province are in too great abundance for the uses of the inhabitants One man discovers this He brings corn from the one province and returns with cattle and supplying the wants of both he is so far a common benefactor As the people encrease in numbers and industry the difficulty of their mutual intercourse encreases The business of the agency or merchandize becomes more intricate and divides subdivides compounds and mixes to a greater variety In all these transactions 'tis necessary and reasonable that a considerable part of the commodities and labour shou'd belong  to the merchant to whom in a great measure they are owing And these commodities he will sometimes preserve in kind or more commonly convert into money which is their common representation If gold and silver have encreas'd in the state along with industry it will require a great quantity of these metals to represent a great quantity of commodities and labour If industry alone has encreas'd the prices of every thing must sink and a very small quantity of specie will serve as a representation  THERE is no craving or demand of the human mind more constant and insatiable than that for exercise and employment and this desire seems the foundation of most of our passions and pursuits Deprive a man of all business and serious occupation he runs restless from one amusement to another and the weight and oppression which he feels from idleness is so great that he forgets the ruin which must follow from his immoderate expences Give him a more harmless way of employing his mind or body he is satisfied and feels no longer that insatiable thirst after pleasure But if the employment you give him be profitable especially if the profit be attach'd to every particular exertion of industry he has gain so often in his eye that he acquires by degrees a passion for it and knows no such pleasure as that of seeing the daily encrease of his fortune And this is the reason why  trade encreases frugality and why among merchants there is the same overplus of misers above prodigals as among the possessors of land there is the contrary  COMMERCE encreases industry by conveying it readily from one member of the state to another and allowing none of it to perish or become useless It encreases frugality by giving occupation to men and employing them in the arts of gain which soon engage their affection and remove them from all relish of pleasure and expence 'Tis an infallible consequence of all industrious professions to beget frugality and make the love of gain prevail over the love of pleasure Among lawyers and physicians who have any practice there are many more who live within their income than who exceed it or even live up to it But lawyers and physicians beget no industry and 'tis even at the expence of others they acquire their riches so that they are sure to diminish the possessions of some of their fellow citizens as fast as they encrease their own Merchants on the contrary beget industry by serving as canals to convey it thro' every corner of the state and at the same time by their frugality they acquire great power over that industry and collect a large property in the labour and commodities which they are the chief instruments in producing There is no other profession therefore except merchandize which can make  the money'd interest considerable or in other words can encrease industry and by also encreasing frugality give a great command of that industry to particular members of the society Without commerce the state must consist chiefly of landed gentry whose prodigality and expence make a continual demand for borrowing and of peasants who have no sums to supply that demand The money never gathers into large stocks or sums that can be lent at interest It is disperst into numberless hands who either squander it in idle show and magnificence or employ it in the purchase of the common necessaries of life Commerce alone assembles it into considerable sums and this effect it has merely from the industry which it begets and the frugality which it inspires independent of the quantity of precious metal which may circulate in the state  THUS an encrease of commerce by a necessary and infallible consequence raises a great number of lenders and by that means produces a lowness of interest We must now consider how far this encrease of commerce diminishes the profits arising from that profession and gives rise to the  third  circumstance requisite to produce a lowness of interest  IT may be proper to observe on this head that low interest and low profits of merchandize are  two events that mutually forward each other and are both originally deriv'd from that extensive commerce which produces opulent merchants and renders the money'd interest considerable Where merchants possess great stocks whether represented by few or many pieces of metal it must frequently happen that when they either become tir'd of business or have heirs unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce a great deal of these riches naturally seeks an annual and secure revenue The plenty diminishes their price and makes the lenders accept of a low interest This consideration obliges many to keep their stocks in trade and rather be content with low profit than dispose of their money at an undervalue On the other hand when commerce has become very extensive and employs very large stocks there must arise rivalships among the merchants which diminish the profits of trade at the same time that they encrease the trade itself The low profits of merchandize induce the merchants to accept more willingly of a low interest when they leave off business and begin to indulge themselves in ease and indolence It is needless therefore to enquire which of these circumstances  viz low interest  or  low profits  is the cause and which the effect They both arise from an extensive commerce and mutually forward each other No man will accept of low profits where he can have high interest and no man will accept of low interest where he can  have high profits An extensive commerce by producing large stocks diminishes both interest and profit and is always assisted in its diminution of the one by the proportional sinking of the other I may add that as low profits arise from the encrease of commerce and industry they serve in their turn to the farther encrease of commerce by rendering the commodities cheaper encreasing the consumption and heightening the industry And thus if we consider the whole connexion of causes and effects interest is the true barometer of the state and its lowness is a sign almost infallible of the flourishing of a people It proves the encrease of industry and its prompt circulation thro' the whole state little inferior to a demonstration And tho' perhaps it may not be impossible but a sudden and a great check to commerce may have a momentary effect of the same kind by throwing so many stocks out of trade it must be attended with such misery and want of employment in the poor that besides its short duration it will not be possible to mistake the one case for the other  THOSE who have asserted that the plenty of money was the cause of low interest seem to have taken a collateral effect for a cause since the same industry which sinks the interest does commonly acquire great abundance of the precious metals A variety of fine manufactures along with vigilant enterprising merchants will soon draw money to  a state if it be any where to be found in the world The same cause by multiplying the conveniences of life and encreasing industry collects great riches into the hands of persons who are not proprietors of land and produces by that means a lowness of interest But tho' these effects plenty of money and low interest do both naturally arise from commerce and industry they are altogether independent of each other For suppose a nation remov'd into the  Pacific  ocean without any foreign commerce or any knowledge of navigation Suppose that this nation possesses always the same stock of coin but is continually encreasing in its numbers and industry 'Tis evident that the price of every commodity must gradually diminish in that kingdom since 'tis the proportion betwixt money and any species of goods which fixes their mutual value and upon the present supposition the conveniences of life become every day more abundant without any alteration on the current specie A less quantity of money therefore amongst this people will make a rich man during the times of industry than wou'd serve to that purpose in ignorant and slothful ages Less money will build a house portion a daughter buy an estate support a manufactory or maintain a family and equipage These are the uses for which men borrow money and therefore the greater or less quantity of it in a state has no influence on the interest But 'tis evident that the greater or less stock of labour  and commodities must have a great influence since we really and in effect borrow these when we take money upon interest 'Tis true when commerce is extended all over the globe the most industrious nations always abound most with the precious metals So that low interest and plenty of money are in fact almost inseparable But still 'tis of consequence to know the principle whence any phenomenon arises and to distinguish betwixt a cause and a concomitant effect Besides that the speculation is curious it may frequently be of use in the conduct of public affairs At least it must be own'd that nothing can be of more use than to improve by practice the method of reasoning on these subjects which of all others are the most important tho' they are commonly treated in the loosest and most careless manner  ANOTHER reason of this popular mistake with regard to the cause of low interest seems to be the instance of some nations where after a sudden acquisition of riches or of the precious metals by means of foreign conquest the interest has fallen not only amongst them but in all the neighbouring states as soon as that money was disperst and had insinuated itself into every corner Thus interest in  Spain  fell near a half immediately after the discovery of the  West Indies  as we are inform'd by  Garcilasso de la Vega  And it has been ever since gradually sinking in every kingdom of  Europe  Interest in  Rome  after the conquest of  Egypt  fell from to  per cent  as we learn from  Dion  Lib  THE causes of the sinking of interest upon such an event seem different in the conquering country and in the neighbouring states but in neither of them can we justly ascribe that effect merely to the encrease of gold and silver  IN the conquering country 'tis natural to imagine that this new acquisition of money will fall into a few hands and be gather'd into large sums which seek a secure revenue either by the purchase of land or by interest and consequently the same effect follows for a little time as if there had been a great occasion of industry and commerce The encrease of lenders above the borrowers sinks the interest and so much the faster if those who have acquir'd those large sums find no industry or commerce in the state and no method of employing their money but by lending it at interest But after this new mass of gold and silver has been digested and has circulated thro' the whole state affairs will soon return to their former situation While the landlords and new moneyholders living idly squander above their income and the former daily contract debt and the latter encroach on their stock 'till its final extinction The whole money may still be in the state  and make itself felt by the encrease of prices But not being now collected into any large masses or stocks the disproportion betwixt the borrowers and lenders is the same as formerly and consequently the high interest returns  ACCORDINGLY we find in  Rome  that so early as  Tiberius  's time interest had again mounted to  per cent  Columella  lib cap  tho' no accident had happen'd to drain the empire of money In  Trajan  's time money lent on mortgages in  Italy  bore  per cent  Plinii epist  lib ep  on common securities in  Bithynia    Ibid  lib ep  And if interest in  Spain  has not risen to its old pitch this can be ascrib'd to nothing but the continuance of the same cause that sunk it  viz  the large fortunes continually made in the  Indies  which come over to  Spain  from time to time and supply the demand of the borrowers But this accidental and extraneous cause more money is to be lent in  Spain  that is more money is collected into large sums than would otherways be found in a state where there are so little commerce and industry  As to the reduction of interest which has follow'd in  England France  and other kingdoms of  Europe  that have no mines it has been gradual and has not proceeded from the encrease of money consider'd merely in itself but from the  encrease of industry which is the natural effect of the former encrease in that interval before it raises the price of labour and provisions For to return to the foregoing supposition if the industry of  England  had risen as much from other causes and that rise might easily have happen'd tho' the stock of money had remain'd the same must not all the same consequences have follow'd which we observe at present The same people wou'd in that case be found in the kingdom the same commodities the same industry manufactures and commerce and consequently the same merchants with the same stocks that is with the same command over labour and commodities only represented by a smaller number of white or yellow pieces Which being a circumstance of no moment would only affect the waggoner porter and trunkmaker Luxury therefore manufactures arts industry frugality flourishing equally as at present 'tis evident that interest must also have been as low since that is the necessary result of all these circumstances so far as they determine the profits of commerce and the proportion betwixt the borrowers and lenders in any state  DISCOURSE V  Of the Balance of Trade  'TIS very usual amongst nations ignorant of the nature of commerce to prohibit the exportation of commodities and to preserve amongst themselves whatever they think valuable and useful They consider not that in this prohibition they act directly contrary to their intentions and that the more is exported of any commodity the more will be rais'd at home of which they themselves will always have the first offer  'TIS well known to the learned that the antient laws of  Athens  render'd the exportation of figs criminal that being suppos'd a species of fruit so excellent in  Attica  that the  Athenians  esteem'd it too delicious for the palate of any foreigner And in this ridiculous prohibition they were so much in earnest that informers were thence called sycophants among them from two  Greek  words which signify  figs  and  discoverer  Plut  de curiositate  I have been told that many old acts of parliament show the same ignorance in the nature of commerce And to this day in a neighbouring kingdom the exportation of corn is almost always prohibited in order  as they say to prevent famines tho' 'tis evident that nothing contributes more to the frequent famines which so much distress that fertile country  THE same jealous fear with regard to money has also prevail'd amongst several nations and it requir'd both reason and experience to convince any people that these prohibitions serve to no other purpose than to raise the exchange against them and produce a still greater exportation  THESE errors one may say are gross and palpable But there still prevails even amongst nations well acquainted with commerce a strong jealousy with regard to the balance of trade and a fear that all their gold and silver may be leaving them This seems to me almost in every case a very groundless apprehension and I shou'd as soon dread that all our springs and rivers wou'd be exhausted as that money shou'd abandon a kingdom where there are people and industry Let us carefully preserve these latter advantages and we need never be apprehensive of losing the former  'TIS easy to observe that all calculations concerning the balance of trade are founded on very uncertain facts and suppositions The customhouse books are own'd to be an insufficient ground of reasoning nor is the rate of exchange much better unless we consider it with all nations and  know also the proportions of the several sums remitted which one may safely pronounce impossible Every man who has ever reason'd on this subject has always prov'd his theory whatever it was by facts and calculations and by an enumeration of all the commodities sent to all foreign kingdoms  THE writings of Mr  Gee  struck the nation with an universal pannic when they saw it plainly demonstrated by a detail of particulars that the balance was against them for so considerable a sum as must leave them without a single shilling in five or six years But luckily twenty years have since elaps'd along with an expensive foreign war and yet 'tis commonly suppos'd that money is still more plentiful amongst us than in any former period  NOTHING can be more entertaining on this head than Dr  Swift  an author who has more humour than knowledge more taste than judgment and more spleen prejudice and passion than any of these qualities He says in his  short view of the state of  Ireland that the whole cash of that kingdom amounted but to  l  that out of this they remitted every year a neat million to  England  and had scarce any other source to compensate themselves from and little other foreign trade but the importation of  French  wines for which they pay'd ready money The consequence of  this situation which must be own'd disadvantageous was that in a course of three years the current money of  Ireland  from  l  was reduc'd to less than two And at present I suppose in a course of near years it is absolutely nothing Yet I know not how that opinion of the advance of riches in  Ireland  which gave the doctor so much indignation seems still to continue and gain ground amongst every body  IN short this apprehension of the wrong balance of trade appears of such a nature that it discovers itself wherever one is out of humour with the ministry or is in low spirits and as it can never be refuted by a particular detail of all the exports which counterbalance the imports it may here be proper to form a general argument which may prove the impossibility of that event as long as we preserve our people and our industry  SUPPOSE four parts of all the money in  Britain  to be annihilated in one night and the nation reduc'd to the same condition in this particular as in the reigns of the  Harrys  and  Edwards  what would be the consequence Must not the price of all labour and commodities sink in proportion and every thing be sold as cheap as they were in those ages What nation could then dispute with us in any foreign market or pretend to navigate or to sell manufactures at the same price which to us  wou'd afford sufficient profit In how little time therefore must this bring back the money which we had lost and raise us to the level of all the neighbouring nations Where after we have arriv'd we immediately lose the advantage of the cheapness of labour and commodities and the farther flowing in of money is stopt by our fulness and repletion  AGAIN suppose that all the money in  Britain  were multiply'd fourfold in a night must not the contrary effect follow Must not all labour and commodities rise to such an exorbitant height that no neighbouring nations could afford to buy from us while their commodities on the other hand became so cheap in comparison that in spite of all the laws which cou'd be form'd they wou'd be run in upon us and our money wou'd flow out 'till we fall to a level with foreigners and lose that great superiority of riches which had laid us under such disadvantages  Now 'tis evident that the same causes which wou'd correct these exorbitant inequalities were they to happen miraculously must prevent their happening in the common course of nature and must for ever in all neighbouring nations preserve money nearly proportion'd to the art and industry of each nation All water wherever it communicates remains always at a level Ask naturalists  the reason they tell you that were it to be rais'd in any one place the superior gravity of that part not being balanc'd must depress it 'till it meets a counterpoize and that the same cause which redresses the inequality when it happens must for ever prevent it without some violent external operation  THERE is another cause tho' more limited in its operation which checks the wrong balance of trade to every particular nation to which the kingdom trades When we import more goods than we export the exchange turns against us and this becomes a new encouragement to export as much as the charge of carriage and insurance of the money due would amount to For the exchange can never rise higher than that sum  CAN one imagine that it had ever been possible by any laws or even by any art or industry to have preserv'd all the money in  Spain  which the galleons have brought from the  Indies  Or that all commodities cou'd be sold in  France  for a tenth of the price they wou'd yield on the other side of the  Pyrenees  without finding their way thither and draining from that immense treasure What other reason indeed is there why all nations at present gain in their trade with  Spain  and  Portugal  but because it is impossible to heap up money more than any fluid beyond its proper level The sovereigns of these countries have shown that they wanted not inclination to keep their gold and silver to themselves had it been in any degree practicable  BUT as any body of water may be rais'd above the level of the surrounding element if the former has no communication with the latter so in money if the communication be cut off by any material or physical impediment for all laws alone are ineffectual there may in such a case be a very great inequality of money Thus the immense distance of  China  along with the monopolies of our  India  companies obstructing the communication preserve in  Europe  the gold and silver especially the latter in much greater plenty than they are found in that kingdom But notwithstanding this great obstruction the force of the causes above mention'd is still evident The skill and ingenuity of  Europe  in general much surpasses that of  China  with regard to manual arts and manufactures yet are we never able to trade thither without great disadvantage And were it not for the continual recruits we receive from  America  money wou'd very soon sink in  Europe  and rise in  China  'till it came nearly to a level in both places Nor can any reasonable man doubt but that industrious nation were they as near us as  Poland  or  Barbary  would drain us of the overplus of our specie and draw to themselves a larger share of the  West Indian  treasures We need have no recourse to a physical attraction to explain the necessity of this operation There is a moral attraction arising from the interests and passions of men which is full as potent and infallible  HOW is the balance kept in the provinces of every kingdom among themselves but by the force of this principle which makes it impossible for money to lose its level and either to rise or sink beyond the proportion of the labour and commodities that is in each province Did not long experience make people easy on this head what a fund of gloomy reflections might calculations afford a melancholy  Yorkshire  man while he computed and magnify'd the sums drawn to  London  by taxes absentees commodities and found on comparison the opposite articles so much inferior And no doubt had the  Heptarchy  subsisted in  England  the legislature of each state had been continually alarm'd by the fear of a wrong balance and as 'tis probable that the mutual hatred of these states wou'd have been extremely violent on account of their close neighbourhood they wou'd have loaded and opprest all commerce by a jealous and superfluous caution Since the union has remov'd the barriers betwixt  Scotland  and  England  which of these nations gains from the other by this free commerce Or if the former kingdom has receiv'd any encrease of riches can it be reasonable accounted for by any thing but the encrease of its art and industry 'Twas a common apprehension in  England  before the union as we learn from  L'Abbe du Bos  Les interets d'Angleterre malentendus  that  Scotland  wou'd soon drain them of their treasure  were an open trade allow'd and on t'other side the  Tweed  a contrary apprehension prevail'd With what justice in both time has shown  WHAT happens in small portions of mankind must take place in greater The provinces of the  Roman  empire no doubt kept their balance with each other and with  Italy  independent of the legislature as much as the several counties of  Britain  or the several parishes of each county And any man who travels over  Europe  at this day may see by the prices of commodities that money in spite of the absurd jealousy of princes and states has brought itself nearly to a level and that the difference betwixt one kingdom and another is not greater in this respect than it is often betwixt different provinces of the same kingdom Men naturally flock to capital cities seaports and navigable rivers There we find more men more industry more labour and consequently more money but still the latter difference holds proportion with the former and the level is preserv'd  IT must carefully be remark'd that throughout this discourse wherever I speak of the level of money I mean always its proportional level to the commodities labour industry and skill which is in the several states And I assert that where these advantages are double triple quadruple to what they are in the neighbouring states the money infallibly will also be double triple quadruple The only circumstance that can obstrust the exactness of these proportions is the expence of transporting the commodities from one place to another and this expence is sometimes unequal Thus the corn cattle cheese butter of  Derbyshire  cannot draw the money of  London  so much as the manufactures of  London  draw the money of  Derbyshire  But this objection is only a seeming one For so far as the transport of commodities is expensive so far is the communication betwixt the places obstructed and imperfect  OUR jealousy and our hatred of  France  are without bounds and the former sentiment at least must be acknowledg'd very reasonable and well grounded These passions have occasion'd innumerable barriers and obstructions upon commerce where we are accus'd of being commonly the aggressors But what have we gain'd by the bargain We lost the  French  market for our woolen manufactures and transferr'd the commerce of wine to  Spain  and  Portugal  where we buy much worse liquor at a higher price There are few  Englishmen  that wou'd not think their country absolutely ruin'd were  French  wines sold in  England  so cheap and in such abundance as to supplant in some measure all ale and homebrewn liquors But wou'd we lay aside prejudice it wou'd not be difficult to prove that nothing cou'd be more innocent perhaps advantageous Each new acre of vineyard planted in  France  in order to supply  England  with wine wou'd make it requisite for the  French  to take the product of an  English  acre sown in wheat or barley in order to subsist themselves and 'tis evident we have thereby got command of the better commodity  THERE are many edicts of the  French  king prohibiting the planting of new vineyards and ordering all those lately planted to be grubb'd up So sensible are they in that country of the superior value of corn above every other product  MARESCHAL  Vauban  complains often and with reason of the absurd duties which load the entry of wines of  Languedoc Guienne  and those other southern provinces that are imported into  Britany  and  Normandy  He entertain'd no doubt but these latter provinces cou'd preserve their balance notwithstanding the open commerce which he recommends And 'tis evident that a few leagues more navigation to  England  wou'd make no difference Or if it did that it must operate alike on the commodities of both kingdoms  THERE is indeed one expedient by which it is possible to sink and another by which we may raise money beyond its natural level in any kingdom but these cases when examin'd will be found to resolve into our general theory and to bring additional authority to it  I SCARCE know any method of sinking money below its level but those institutions of banks funds and paper credit with which we are in this kingdom so much infatuated These render  paper equivalent to money circulate it thro' the whole state make it supply the place of gold and silver raise proportionably the price of labour and commodities and by that means either banish a great part of those precious metals or prevent their farther encrease What can be more shortsighted than our reasonings on this head We fancy because an individual wou'd be much richer were his stock of money doubled that the same good effect wou'd follow were the money of every one encreas'd not considering that this wou'd raise as much the price of every commodity and reduce every man in time to the same condition as before 'Tis only in our public negotiations and transactions with foreigners that a greater stock of money is advantageous and as our paper is there absolutely insignificant we feel by its means all the ill effects arising from a great abundance of money without reaping any of the advantages  SUPPOSE there are millions of paper that circulate in the kingdom as money for we are not to imagine that all our enormous funds are employ'd in that shape and suppose that the real cash of the kingdom is millions Here is a state which is found by experience able to hold a stock of millions I say if it be able to hold it it must of necessity have acquir'd it in gold and silver had we not obstructed the entrance of these metals by this new invention of paper  Whence would it  have acquir'd that sum  From all the kingdoms of the world  But why  Because if you remove these millions money in this state is below its level compar'd with our neighbours and we must immediately draw from all of them till we be full and saturate so to speak and can hold no more By our wise politics we are as careful to stuff the nation with this fine commodity of bankbills and chequernotes as if we were afraid of being overburthen'd with the precious metals  'TIS not to be doubted but the great plenty of bullion in  France  is in a great measure owing to the want of paper credit The  French  have no banks Merchants bills do not there circulate as with us Usury or lending on interest is not directly permitted so that many have large sums in their coffers Great quantities of plate are us'd in private houses and all the churches are full of it By this means provisions and labour still remain much cheaper amongst them than in nations that are not half so rich in gold and silver The advantage of this situation in point of trade as well as in great public emergencies is too evident to be disputed  THE same fashion a few years ago prevail'd in  Genoa  which still has place in  England  and  Holland  of using services of  China  ware instead of plate but the senate wisely foreseeing the consequences  prohibited the use of that brittle commodity beyond a certain extent while the use of silver plate was left unlimited And I suppose in their late distresses they felt the good effect of this ordonnance  OUR tax on plate is perhaps in this view impolitic  BEFORE the introduction of paper money into our colonies they had gold and silver sufficient for their circulation Since the introduction of that commodity the least of the inconveniencies that has follow'd is the total banishment of the precious metals And after the abolition of paper can it be doubted but money will return while these colonies possess manufactures and commodities the only things valuable in commerce and for whose sake alone all men desire money  WHAT pity  Lycurgus  did not think of paper credit when he wanted to banish gold and silver from  Sparta  It wou'd have serv'd his purpose better than the lumps of iron he made use of as money and wou'd also have prevented more effectually all commerce with strangers as being of so much less real and intrinsic value  BUT as our darling projects of paper credit are pernicious being almost the only expedient by which we can sink money below its level so in my opinion the only expedient by which we can raise money above its level is a practice we wou'd all  exclaim against as destructive  viz  the gathering large sums into a public treasure locking them up and absolutely preventing their circulation The fluid not communicating with the neighbouring element may by such an artifice be rais'd to what height we please To prove this we need only return to our first supposition of the annihilating the half or any part of our cash where we found that the immediate consequence of such an event wou'd be the attraction of an equal sum from all the neighbouring kingdoms Nor does there seem to be any necessary bounds set by the nature of things to this practice of hoarding A small city like  Geneva  continuing this policy for ages might engross nine tenths of the money of  Europe  There seems indeed in the nature of man an invincible obstacle to that immense growth of riches A weak state with an enormous treasure wou'd soon become a prey to some of its poorer but more powerful neighbours A great state wou'd dissipate its wealth on dangerous and illconcerted projects and probably destroy along with it what is much more valuable the industry morals and numbers of its people The fluid in this case rais'd to too great a height bursts and destroys the vessel that contains it and mixing itself with the surrounding element soon falls to its proper level  So little are we commonly acquainted with this principle that tho' all historians agree in relating uniformly so recent an event as the immense treasure amass'd by  Harry  the VII which they make amount to pounds we rather reject their concurring testimony than admit of a fact which agrees so ill with our inveterate prejudices 'Tis indeed probable that that sum might be three fourths of all the money in  England  But where is the difficulty that such a sum might be amass'd in twenty years by a cunning rapacious frugal and almost arbitrary monarch Nor is it probable that the diminution of circulating money was ever sensibly felt by the people or ever did them any prejudice The sinking of the prices of all commodities wou'd immediately replace it by giving  England  the advantage in its commerce with all the neighbouring kingdoms  HAVE we not an instance in the small republic of  Athens  with its allies who in about fifty years betwixt the  Median  and  Peloponesian  wars amass'd a sum greater than that of  Harry  the VII  There were about eight ounces of silver in a pound  Sterling  in  Harry  the VII's time  For all the  Greek  historians  Thucydidis  lib and  Diod Sic  lib  and orators  Vid Aeschinis Demosthenis epist  agree that the  Athenians  collected in the citadel more than  talents which they afterwards dissipated to their own ruin in rash and imprudent enterprises But when this money was set a running and began to communicate with the surrounding fluid what was the consequence Did it remain in the state No For we find by the memorable  census  mention'd by  Demosthenes    and  Polybius  Lib cap  that in about fifty years afterwards the whole value of the republic comprehending lands houses commodities slaves and money was less than talents  WHAT an ambitious high spirited people was this to collect and keep in their treasury with a view to conquests a sum which it was every day in the power of the citizens by a single vote to distribute among themselves and which wou'd go near to triple the riches of every individual For we must observe that the numbers and private riches of the  Athenians  are said by antient writers to have been no greater at the beginning of the  Peloponnesian  war than at the beginning of the  Macedonian  MONEY was little more plentiful in  Greece  during the age of  Philip  and  Perseus  than in  England  during that of  Harry  the VII Yet these two monarchs in years  Titi Livii  lib cap  collected from the small kingdom of  Macedon  a much larger treasure than that of the  English  monarch  Paulus Aemilius  brought to  Rome  about pounds  Sterling  Vel Patcrc  lib cap  Pliny  says  Lib cap  And that was but a part of the  Macedonian  treasure The rest was dissipated by the resistance and flight of  Perseus  Titi Livii ibid  WE may learn from  Stanyan  that the canton of  Berne  had pounds lent at interest and had above six times as much in their treasury Here then is a sum hoarded of pounds  Sterling  which is at least quadruple of what shou'd naturally circulate in such a petty state and yet no one who travels into the  Païs de Vaux  or any part of that canton observes any want of money more than cou'd be suppos'd in a country of that extent soil and situation On the contrary there are scarce any inland provinces in the continent of  France  or  Germany  where the inhabitants are at this time so opulent tho' that canton has vastly encreas'd its treasure since the time when  Stanyan  wrote his judicious account of  Switzerland  The poverty which  Stanyan  speaks of is only to be seen in the most mountainous cantons where there is no commodity to bring money And even there the people are not poorer than in the diocese of  Saltzburg  on the one hand or  Savoy  on the other if they be so poor  THE account given by  Appian  Proem  of the treasure of the  Ptolemies  is so prodigious that one cannot admit  of it and so much the more that the historian says the other successors of  Alexander  were also frugal and had many of them treasures not much inferior For this saving humour of the neighbouring princes must necessarily have check'd the frugality of the  Aegyptian  monarchs according to the foregoing theory The sum he mentions is talents or pounds shillings and pence according to Dr  Arbuthnot  's computation And yet  Appian  says that he extracted his account from the public records and he was himself a native of  Alexandria  FROM these principles we may learn what judgment we ought to form of those numberless bars obstructions and imposts which all nations of  Europe  and none more than  England  have put upon trade from an exorbitant desire of amassing money which never will heap up beyond its level while it circulates or from an ill grounded apprehension of losing their specie which never will sink below it Cou'd any thing scatter our riches 'twou'd be such impolitic contrivances But this general ill effect however results from them that they deprive neighbouring nations of that free communication and exchange which the author of the world has intended by giving them soils climates and geniuses so different from each other  OUR modern politics embrace the only method of banishing money the using paper credit they reject the only method of amassing it the practice of hoarding and they adopt a hundred contrivances which serve to no purpose but to check industry and rob ourselves and our neighbours of the common benefits of art and nature  ALL taxes however upon foreign commodities are not to be regarded as prejudicial or useless but those only which are founded on the jealousy above mention'd A tax on  German  linen encourages home manufactures and thereby multiplies our people and industry A tax on brandy encreases the sale of rum and supports our southern colonies And as 'tis necessary imposts shou'd be levy'd for the support of government it may be thought more convenient to lay them on foreign commodities which can easily be intercepted at the port and subjected to the impost We ought however always to remember the maxim of Dr  Swift  that in the arithmetic of the customs two and two make not four but often make only one It can scarcely be doubted but if the duties on wine were lower'd to a third they wou'd yield much more to the government than at present Our people might thereby afford to drink commonly a better and more wholsome liquor And no prejudice wou'd ensue to the balance of trade of which  we are so jealous The manufacture of ale beyond the agriculture is but inconsiderable and gives employment to few hands The transport of wine and corn wou'd not be much inferior  BUT are there not frequent instances you will say of states and kingdoms that were formerly rich and opulent and are now poor and beggarly Has not the money left them with which they formerly abounded I answer If they lose their trade industry and people they cannot expect to keep their gold and silver For these precious metals hold proportion to the former advantages When  Lisbon  and  Amsterdam  got the  East India  trade from  Venice  and  Genoa  they also got the profits and money that arose from it Where the seat of government is transferr'd where expensive armies are maintain'd at a distance where great funds are possest by foreigners there naturally follows from these causes a diminution of the specie But these we may observe are violent and forcible methods of carrying away money and are in time commonly attended with the transport of people and industry But where these remain and the drain is not continu'd the money always finds its way back again by a hundred canals of which we have no notion nor suspicion What immense treasures have been spent by so many nations in  Flanders  since the revolution in the course of three long wars More money perhaps than the half of what  is at present in all  Europe  But what has now become of it Is it in the narrow compass of the  Austrian  provinces No surely It has most of it return'd to the several countries whence it came and has follow'd that art and industry by which at first it was acquir'd  IN short a government has great reason to preserve with care its people and its manufactures Its money it may safely trust to the course of human affairs without fear or jealousy Or if it ever give attention to that latter circumstance it ought only to be so far as it affects the former  DISCOURSE VI  Of the Balance of Power  IT is a question whether the  idea  of the balance of power be owing entirely to modern policy or whether the  phrase  only has been invented in these latter ages 'Tis certain that  Lib I  Xenophon  in his institution of  Cyrus  represents the combination of the  Asiatic  powers to have arisen from a jealousy of the encreasing force of the  Medes  and  Persians  and tho' that elegant composition shou'd be suppos'd altogether a romance this sentiment ascrib'd by the author to the Eastern princes is at least a proof of the prevailing notions of antient times  IN the whole politics of  Greece  the anxiety with regard to the balance is most apparent and is expressly pointed out to us even by the antient historians  Thucydides  Lib I  represents the league which was form'd against  Athens  and which produc'd the  Peloponnesian  war as entirely owing to this principle And after the decline of  Athens  when the  Thebans  and  Lacedemonians  disputed for sovereignity we find that the  Athenians  as well as many other republics threw themselves always into the  lighter scale and endeavour'd to preserve the balance They supported  Thebes  against  Sparta  till the great victory gain'd by  Epaminondas  at  Leuctra  after which they immediately went over to the conquer'd from generosity as they pretended but in reality from their jealousy of the conquerors  Xenoph  hist  Graec  lib  WHOEVER will read  Demosthenes  's oration for the  Megalopolitans  may see the utmost refinements on this principle that ever enter'd into the head of a  Venetian  or  English  speculatist And upon the first rise of the  Macedonian  power this orator immediately discover'd the danger sounded the alarm thro' all  Greece  and at last assembled that confederacy under the banners of  Athens  which fought the great and decisive battle of  Chaeronea  'TIS true the  Grecian  wars are regarded by historians as wars of emulation rather than of politics and each state seems to have had more in view the honour of leading the rest than any wellgrounded hopes of authority and dominion If we consider indeed the small number of inhabitants in any one republic compar'd to the whole the great difficulty of forming sieges in those times and the extraordinary bravery and discipline of every freeman amongst that noble people we shall conclude  that the balance of power was of itself sufficiently secur'd in  Greece  and needed not to be guarded with that caution which may be requisite in other ages But whether we ascribe the shifting sides in all the  Grecian  republics to  jealous emulation  or  cautious politics  the effects were alike and every prevailing power was sure to meet with a confederacy against it and that often compos'd of its former friends and allies  THE same principle call it envy or prudence which produc'd the  Ostracism  of  Athens  and  Petalism  of  Syracuse  and expell'd every citizen whose fame or power overtop'd the rest the same principle I say naturally discover'd itself in foreign politics and soon rais'd enemies to the leading state however moderate in the exercise of its authority  THE  Persian  monarch was really in his force a petty prince compar'd to the  Grecian  republics and therefore it behov'd him from views of safety more than from emulation to interest himself in their quarrels and to support the weaker side in every contest This was the advice given by  Alcibiades  to  Tissaphernes  Thuc  lib  and it prolong'd near a century the date of the  Persian  empire till the neglect of it for a moment after the first appearance of the aspiring genius of  Philip  brought that lofty and frail edifice to the ground  with a rapidity of which there are few instances in the history of mankind  THE successors of  Alexander  show'd an infinite jealousy of the balance of power a jealousy founded on true politics and prudence and which preserv'd distinct for several ages the partitions made after the death of that famous conqueror The fortune and ambition of  Antigonus  Diod Sic  lib  threaten'd them anew with an universal monarchy but their combination and their victory at  Ipsus  sav'd them And in after times we find that as the Eastern princes consider'd the  Greeks  and  Macedonians  as the only real military force with whom they had any intercourse they kept always a watchful eye over that part of the world The  Ptolemies  in particular supported first  Aratus  and the  Achaeans  and then  Cleomenes  King of  Sparta  from no other view than as a counterbalance to the  Macedonian  monarchs For this is the account which  Polybius  gives of the  Egyptian  politics  Lib cap  THE reason why 'tis suppos'd that the antients were intirely ignorant of the  balance of power  seems to be drawn from the  Roman  history more than the  Greek  and as the transactions of the former are generally the most familiar to us we have thence form'd all our conclusions It must be  own'd that the  Romans  never met with any such general combination or confederacy against them as might naturally be expected from their rapid conquests and declar'd ambition but were allow'd peaceably to subdue their neighbours one after another till they extended their dominion over the whole known world Not to mention the fabulous history of their  Italic  wars  THERE have strong suspicions of late arisen amongst crities and in my opinion not without reason concerning the first ages of the  Roman  history as if they were almost entirely fabulous 'till after the sacking of the city by the  Gauls  and were even doubtful for some time afterwards 'till the  Greeks  began to give attention to  Roman  affairs and commit them to writing This scepticism however seems to me scarcely defensible in its full extent with regard to the domestic history of  Rome  which has some air of truth and probability and cou'd scarce be the invention of an historian who had so little morals or judgment as to indulge himself in fiction and romance The revolutions seem so well proportion'd to their causes The progress of the factions is so conformable to political experience The manners and maxims of the age are so uniform and natural that scarce any real history affords more just reflection and improvement Is not  Machiavel  's comment on  Livy  a work surely of great judgment and genius founded entirely on this period which is represented as fabulous I wou'd willingly therefore in my private sentiments divide the matter with these critics and allow that the battles and victories and triumphs of those ages had been extremely falsify'd by family memoirs as  Cicero  says they were But as in the accounts of domestic factions there were two opposite relations transmitted to posterity this both serv'd as a check upon fiction and enabled latter historians to gather some truth from comparison and reasoning Half of the slaughter which  Livy  commits on the  Aequi  and the  Volsci  wou'd depopulate  France  and  Germany  and that historian tho' perhaps he may justly be charg'd as superficial is at last shock'd himself with the incredibility of his narration The same love of exaggeration seems to have magnify'd the numbers of the  Romans  in their armies and  census  there was  upon  Hannibal  's invasion of the  Roman  state a very remarkable crisis which ought to have call'd up the attention of all civiliz'd nations It appear'd afterwards nor was it difficult to be observ'd at the time  IT was observ'd by some as appears by the speech of  Agelaus  of  Naupactum  in a general congress of  Greece  See  Polyb  lib cap  that this was a contest for universal empire and yet no prince or state seems to have been in the least alarm'd about the event or issue of the quarrel  Philip  of  Macedon  remain'd neuter 'till he saw the victories of  Hannibal  and then most imprudently form'd an alliance with the conqueror upon terms still more imprudent He stipulated that he was to assist the  Carthaginian  state in their conquest of  Italy  after which they engag'd to send over forces into  Greece  to assist him in subduing the  Grecian  commonwealths  Titi Livii  lib cap    THE  Rhodian  and  Achaean  republics are much celebrated by antient historians for their wisdom and sound policy yet both of them assisted the  Romans  in their wars against  Philip  and  Antiochus  And what may be esteem'd still a stronger proof that this maxim was not familiarly known in those ages no antient author has ever remark'd the imprudence  of those measures nor has even blam'd that absurd treaty above mention'd made by  Philip  with the  Carthaginians  Princes and statesmen may in all ages be blinded in their reasonings with regard to events before hand But 'tis somewhat extraordinary that historians afterwards shou'd not form a sounder judgment of them  Massinissa Attalus Prusias  in satisfying their private passions were all of them the instruments of the  Roman  greatness and never seem to have suspected that they were forging their own chains while they advanc'd the conquests of their ally A simple treaty and agreement betwixt  Massinissa  and the  Carthaginians  so much requir'd by mutual interest barr'd the  Romans  from all entrance into  Africa  and preserv'd liberty to mankind  THE only prince we meet with in the  Roman  history who seems to have understood the balance of power is  Hiero  king of  Syracuse  Tho' ally of  Rome  he sent assistance to the  Carthaginians  during the war of the auxiliaries  Esteeming it requisite says  Polybius  Lib cap  both in order to retain his dominions in  Sicily  and to preserve the  Roman  friendship that  Carthage  shou'd be safe Lest by its fall the remaining power shou'd be able without contraste or opposition to execute  every purpose and undertaking And here he acted with great wisdom and prudence For that is never on any account to be overlookt nor ought such a force ever to be thrown into one hand as to incapacitate the neighbouring states from defending their rights against it  Here is the aim of modern politics pointed out in express terms  IN short the maxim of preserving the balance of power is founded so much on common sense and obvious reasoning that 'tis impossible it cou'd altogether have escap'd antiquity where we find in other particulars so many marks of deep penetration and discernment If it was not so generally known and acknowledg'd as at present it had at least an influence on all the wiser and more experienc'd princes and politicians And indeed even at present however generally known and acknowledged amongst speculative reasoners it has not in practice an authority much more extensive amongst those who govern the world  AFTER the fall of the  Roman  empire the form of government establish'd by the northern conquerors incapacitated them in a great measure from farther conquests and long maintain'd each state in its proper boundaries But when vassalage and the feudal militia were abolish'd mankind were anew alarm'd by the danger of universal monarchy  from the union of so many kingdoms and principalities in the person of the emperor  Charles  But the power of the house of  Austria  founded on extensive but divided dominions and their riches deriv'd chiefly from mines of gold and silver were more likely to decay of themselves from internal defects than to overthrow all the bulwarks rais'd against them In less than a century the force of that violent and haughty race was shatter'd their opulence dissipated their splendor eclips'd A new power succeeded more formidable to the liberties of  Europe  possessing all the advantages of the former and labouring under none of its defects except a share of that spirit of bigotry and persecution with which the house of  Austria  were so long and still are so much infatuated  Europe  has now for above a century remain'd on the defensive against the greatest force that ever perhaps was form'd by the civil or political combination of mankind And such is the influence of the maxim here treated of that tho' that ambitious nation in the five last general wars have been victorious in four  THOSE concluded by the peace of the  Pyrences Nimeguen Ryswick  and  AixlaChapelle  and unsuccessful only in one  THAT concluded by the peace of  Utrecht  they have not much enlarg'd their dominions nor acquir'd a total ascendant over  Europe  On the contrary there remain still some hopes of maintaining the resistance so long that the natural revolutions of human affairs together with unforeseen events and accidents may guard us against universal monarchy and preserve the world from so great an evil  IN the three last of these general wars  Britain  has stood foremost in the glorious struggle and she still maintains her station as guardian of the general liberties of  Europe  and patron of mankind Beside her advantages of riches and situation her people are animated with such a national spirit and are so fully sensible of the inestimable blessings of their government that we may hope their vigor never will languish in so necessary and so just a cause On the contrary if we may judge by the past their passionate ardour seems rather to require some moderation and they have oftener err'd from a laudable excess than from a blamable deficiency  IN the  first  place we seem to have been more possest with the antient  Greek  spirit of jealous emulation than actuated with the prudent views of modern politics Our wars with  France  have been begun with justice and even perhaps from necessity but have always been too far push'd from obstinacy and passion The same peace which was afterwards made at  Ryswick  in was offer'd so early as the ninety two that concluded at  Utrecht  in might have been finish'd on as good conditions at  Gertruytenberg  in the eight and we might have given at  Frankfort  in the same terms which we were glad to accept of at  AixlaChapelle  in the forty eight Here then we see that above half of our wars with  France  and all our public debts are owing more to our own imprudent vehemence than to the ambition of our neighbours  IN the  second  place we are so declar'd in our opposition to  French  power and so alert in defence of our allies that they always reckon upon our force as upon their own and expecting to carry on war at our expence refuse all reasonable terms of accommodation  Habent subjectos tanquam suos viles ut alienos  All the world knows that the factious vote of the house of commons in the beginning of the last parliament along with the profest humour of the nation made the queen of  Hungary  inflexible in her terms and prevented that agreement with  Prussia  which wou'd immediately have restor'd the general tranquillity of  Europe  IN the  third  place we are such true combatants that when once engag'd we lose all concern for ourselves and our posterity and consider only how we may best annoy the enemy To mortgage our revenues at so deep a rate in wars where we were only accessaries was surely the most fatal delusion  that a nation who had any pretension to politics and prudence has ever yet been guilty of That remedy of funding if it be a remedy and not rather a poison ought in all reason to be reserv'd to the last extremity and no evil but the greatest and most urgent shou'd ever induce us to embrace so dangerous an expedient  THESE excesses to which we have been carry'd are prejudicial and may perhaps in time become still more prejudicial another way by begeting as is usual the opposite extreme and rendering us totally careless and supine with regard to the fate of  Europe  The  Athenians  from the most bustling intriguing warlike people of  Greece  finding their error in thrusting themselves into every quarrel abandon'd all attention to foreign affairs and in no contest ever took party on either side except by their flatteries and complaisance to the victor  ENORMOUS monarchies such as  Europe  at present is in danger of falling into are probably destructive to human nature in their progress in their continuance  IF the  Roman  empire was of advantage it cou'd only proceed from this that mankind were generally in a very disorderly unciviliz'd condition before its establishment  and even in their downfall which never can be very distant from their establishment The military genius which aggrandiz'd  the monarchy soon leaves the court the capital and the center of such a government while the wars are carry'd on at a great distance and interest so small a part of the state The antient nobility whose affections attach them to their sovereign live all at court and never will accept of military employments which wou'd carry them to remote and barbarous frontiers where they are distant both from their pleasure and their fortune The arms of the state must therefore be trusted to mercenary strangers without zeal without attachment without honour ready on every occasion to turn them against the prince and join each desperate malecontent who offers pay and plunder This is the necessary progress of human affairs Thus human nature checks itself in its airy elevations Thus ambition blindly labours for the destruction of the conqueror of his family and of every thing near and dear to him The  Bourbons  trusting to the support of their brave faithful and affectionate nobility would push their advantage without reserve or limitation These while fir'd with glory and emulation can bear the fatigues and dangers of war But never would submit to languish in the garrisons of  Hungary  or  Lithuania  forgot at court and sacrisic'd to the intrigues of every minion or mistress that approaches the prince The troops are filled with  Cravates  and  Tartars Hussars  and  Cossacs  intermingled perhaps with  a few soldiers of fortune from the better provinces And the melancholy fate of the  Roman  emperors from the same causes is renew'd over and over again 'till the final dissolution of the monarchy  DISCOURSE VII  Of Taxes  THERE is a maxim that prevails amongst those whom in this country we call  ways and means men  and who are denominated  Financiers  and  Maltotiers  in  France that every new tax creates a new ability in the subjects to bear it and that each encrease of publick burthens encreases proportionably the industry of the people  This maxim is of such a nature as is most likely to be extremely abus'd and is so much the more dangerous that its truth cannot be altogether deny'd but it must be own'd when kept within certain bounds to have some foundation in reason and experience  WHEN a tax is laid upon commodities that are consum'd by the common people the necessary consequence may seem to be that either the poor must retrench something from their way of living or raise their wages so as to make the burthen of the tax fall entirely upon the rich But there is a third consequence which very often follows upon taxes  viz  that the poor encrease their industry perform more work and live as well as before without demanding more for their labour Where taxes are moderate are laid on gradually and affect not the  necessaries of life this consequence naturally follows and 'tis certain that such difficulties often serve to excite the industry of a people and render them more opulent and laborious than others who enjoy the greatest advantages For we may observe as a parallel instance that the most trading nations have not always possest the greatest extent of fertile land but on the contrary that they have labour'd under many natural disadvantages  Tyre Athens Carthage Rhodes Genoa Venice Holland  are strong examples to this purpose And in all history we find only three instances of large and fertile countries that have possest much trade the  Netherlands England  and  France  The two former seem to have been allur'd by the advantages of their maritime situation and the necessity they lay under of frequenting foreign ports in order to procure what their own climate refus'd them And as to  France  trade has come very late into that kingdom and seems to have been the effect of reflection and observation in an ingenious and enterprising people who remark'd the immense riches acquir'd by such of the neighbouring nations as cultivated navigation and commerce  THE places mention'd by  Cicero  Epist ad Att  lib ep  as possest of the greatest commerce in his time are  Alexandria Colchos Tyre Sidon Andros Cyprus Pamphilia Lycia Rhodes Chios Byzantium Lesbos Smyrna  Miletum Coos  All these except  Alexandria  were either small islands or narrow territories And that city ow'd its trade entirely to the happiness of its situation  SINCE therefore some natural necessities or disadvantages may be thought favourable to industry why may not artificial burthens have the same effect Sir  William Temple  ACCOUNT of the  Netherlands  chap  I am sure ascribes the industry of the  Dutch  entirely to necessity proceeding from their natural disadvantages and illustrates his doctrine by a very striking comparison with  Ireland  where says he by the largeness and plenty of the soil and scarcity of people all things necessary to life are so cheap that an industrious man by two days labour may gain enough to feed him the rest of the week Which I take to be a very plain ground of the laziness attributed to the people For men naturally prefer ease before labour and will not take pains if they can live idle though when by necessity they have been enur'd to it they cannot leave it being grown a custom necessary to their health and to their very entertainment Nor perhaps is the change harder from constant ease to labour than from constant labour to ease  After which the author proceeds to confirm his doctrine by enumerating as above the places where trade has most flourish'd in  antient and modern times and which are commonly observ'd to be such narrow confin'd territories as beget a necessity for industry  'TIS always observ'd in years of scarcity if it be not extreme that the poor labour more and really live better than in years of great plenty when they indulge themselves in idleness and riot I have been told by a considerable manufacturer that in the year when bread and provisions of all kinds were very dear his workmen not only made a shift to live but paid debts which they had contracted in former years that were much more favourable and abundant  To this purpose see also discourse I at the end  THIS doctrine therefore with regard to taxes may be admitted in some degree But beware of the abuse Taxes like necessity when carry'd too far destroy industry by engendring despair and even before they reach this pitch they raise the wages of the labourer and manufacturer and heighten the price of all commodities An attentive disinterested legislature will observe the point when the emolument ceases and the prejudice begins But as the contrary character is much more common 'tis to be fear'd that taxes all over  Europe  are multiplying to such a degree as will entirely crush all art and industry tho' perhaps their first increase along with other circumstances  might contribute to the growth of these advantages  THE best taxes are those which are levy'd upon consumptions especially those of luxury because such taxes are less felt by the people They seem to be in some measure voluntary since a man may chuse how far he will use the commodity which is taxed They are paid gradually and insensibly And being confounded with the natural price of the commodity they are scarcely perceiv'd by the consumers Their only disadvantage is that they are expensive in the levying  TAXES upon possessions are levy'd without expence but have every other disadvantage Most states however are oblig'd to have recourse to them in order to supply the deficiencies of the other  BUT the most pernicious of all taxes are those which are arbitrary They are commonly converted by their management into punishments on industry and also by their unavoidable inequality are more grievous than by the real burthen which they impose 'Tis surprising therefore to see them have place amongst any civiliz'd people  IN general all polltaxes even when not arbitrary which they commonly are may be esteem'd  dangerous Because it is so easy for the sovereign to add a little more and a little more to the sum demanded that these taxes are apt to become altogether oppressive and intolerable On the other hand a duty upon commodities checks itself and a prince will soon find that an encrease of the impost is no encrease of his revenue It is not easy therefore for a people to be altogether ruin'd by such taxes  HISTORIANS inform us that one of the chief causes of the destruction of the  Roman  state was the alteration which  Constantine  introduc'd into the finances by substituting an universal polltax in lieu of almost all the tythes customs and excises which formerly compos'd the revenue of the  empire  The people in all the provinces were so grinded and opprest by the  publicans  that they were glad to take refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians whose dominion as they had fewer necessities and less art was found preferable to the refin'd tyranny of the  Romans  THERE is a prevailing opinion that all taxes however levy'd fall upon the land at last Such an opinion may be useful in  Britain  by checking the landed gentlemen in whose hands our legislature is lodg'd and making them preserve great regard for trade and industry But I must confess that this principle tho' first advanc'd by a celebrated writer  has so little appearance of reason that were it not for his authority it had never been receiv'd by any body Every man to be sure is desirous of pushing off from himself the burthen of any tax that is impos'd and laying it upon others But as every man has the same inclination and is upon the defensive no set of men can be suppos'd to prevail altogether in this contest And why the landed gentleman shou'd be the victim of the whole and shou'd not be able to defend himself as well as others are I cannot readily imagine All tradesmen indeed wou'd willingly prey upon him and divide him among them if they cou'd But this inclination they always have tho' no taxes were levy'd and the same methods by which he guards against the imposition of tradesmen before taxes will serve him afterwards and make them share the burthen with him  I SHALL conclude this subject with observing that we have with regard to taxes an instance of what frequently happens in political institutions that the consequences of things are diametrically opposite to what we shou'd expect on the first appearance 'Tis regarded as a fundamental maxim of the  Turkish  government that the  Grand signior  tho' absolute master of the lives and fortunes of each individual has no authority to impose a new tax and every  Ottoman  prince who has made such an attempt either has been oblig'd to retract  or has found the fatal effects of his perseverance One wou'd imagine that this prejudice or establish'd opinion were the firmest barrier in the world against oppression yet'tis certain that its effect is quite contrary The emperor having no regular method of encreasing his revenue must allow all the bashas and governors to oppress and abuse the subjects And these he squeezes after their return from their government Whereas if he cou'd impose a new tax like our  European  princes his interest wou'd so far be united with that of his people that he wou'd immediately feel the bad effects of these disorderly levies of money and wou'd find that a pound rais'd by a general imposition wou'd have less pernicious effects than a shilling taken in so unequal and arbitrary a manner  DISCOURSE VIII  Of Public Credit  IT appears to have been the common practice of antiquity to make provision in time of peace for the necessities of war and to hoard up treasures before hand as the instruments either of conquest or defence without trusting to extraordinary imposts much less to borrowing in times of disorder and confusion Besides the immense sums abovemention'd  DISCOURSE V  which were amass'd by  Athens  and by the  Ptolemies  and other successors of  Alexander  we learn from  Plato  Alcib    that the frugal  Lacedemonians  had also collected a great treasure and  Arrian  LIB  and  Plutarch  Plut in vita Alex  He makes these treasures amount to talents or about millions  Sterling Quintus Curtius lib cap  says that  Alexander  found in  Susa  above talents  specify the riches which  Alexander  got possession of on the conquest of  Susa  and  Ecbatana  and which were reserv'd some of them from the time of  Cyrus  If I remember right the scripture also mentions the treasure of  Hezekiah  and the  Jewish  princes as profane history does that of  Philip  and  Perseus  kings of  Macedon  The antient republics in  Gaul  had commonly  large sums in reserve  Strabo  lib  Every one knows the treasure seiz'd in  Rome  by  Julius Caesar  during the civil wars and we find afterwards that the wiser emperors  Augustus Tiberius Vespasian Severus c  always discover'd the prudent foresight of saving great sums against any public exigency  ON the contrary our modern expedient which has become very general is to mortgage the public revenues and to trust that posterity during peace will pay off the incumbrances contracted during the preceding war And they having before their eyes so good an example of their wise fathers have the same prudent reliance on their posterity who at last from necessity more than choice are oblig'd to place the same confidence in a new posterity But not to waste time in declaiming against a practice which appears ruinous beyond the evidence of a hundred demonstrations it seems pretty apparent that the antient maxims are in this respect much more prudent than the modern even tho' the latter had been confin'd within some reasonable bounds and had ever in any instance been attended with such frugality in time of peace as to discharge the debts incurr'd by an expensive war For why shou'd the case be so very different betwixt the public and an individual as to make us establish such different maxims of conduct for each If the funds of the former be  greater its necessary expences are proportionably larger if its resources be more numerous they are not infinite and as its frame should be calculated for a much longer duration than the date of a single life or even of a family it shou'd embrace maxims large durable and generous suitable to the suppos'd extent of its existence To trust to chances and temporary expedients is indeed what the necessity of human affairs frequently reduces us to but whoever voluntarily depend on such resources have not necessity but their own folly to accuse for their misfortunes when any such befal them  IF the abuses of treasures be dangerous either by engaging the state in rash enterprises or making them neglect military discipline in confidence of their riches the abuses of mortgaging are more certain and inevitable poverty impotence and subjection to foreign powers  ACCORDING to modern policy war is attended with every destructive circumstance loss of men encrease of taxes decay of commerce dissipation of money plunder by sea and land According to antient maxims the opening of the public treasure as it produc'd an uncommon affluence of gold and silver serv'd as a temporary encouragement to industry and aton'd in some degree for the inevitable calamities of war  WHAT then shall we say to the new paradox that public encumbrances are of themselves advantageous independent of the necessity of contracting them and that any state even tho' it were not prest by a foreign enemy cou'd not possibly have embrac'd a wiser expedient for promoting commerce and riches than to create funds and debts and taxes without limitation Discourses such as these might naturally have past for trials of wit among rhetoricians like the panegyrics on folly and a fever on  Busiris  and  Nero  had we not seen such absurd maxims patroniz'd by great ministers and by a whole party among us And these puzzling arguments for they deserve not the name of specious tho' they cou'd not be the foundation of lord  Oxford  's conduct for he had more sense serv'd at least to keep his partizans in countenance and perplex the understanding of the nation  LET us examine the consequences of public debts both in our domestic management by their influence on commerce and industry and in our foreign transactions by their effects on wars and negotiations  THERE is a word which is here in the mouth of every body and which I find has also got abroad and is much employ'd by foreign writers  Melon Du Tot Law  in the pamphlets publish'd in  France  in imitation of the  English  and that is CIRCULATION This word serves as an account of every thing and tho' I confess that I have sought for its meaning in the present subject ever since I was a schoolboy I have never yet been able to discover it What possible advantage is there which the nation can reap by the easy transference of stock from hand to hand Or is there any paralel to be drawn from the circulation of other commodities to that of chequer notes and  India  bonds Where a manufacturer has a quick sale of his goods to the merchant the merchant to the shopkeeper the shopkeeper to his customers this enlivens industry and gives new encouragement to the first dealer or the manufacturer and all his tradesmen and makes them produce more and better commodities of the same species A stagnation is here pernicious wherever it happens because it operates backwards and stops or benumbs the industrious hand in its production of what is useful to human life But what production we owe to  Changealley  or even what consumption except that of coffee and pen ink and paper I have not yet learn'd nor can one foresee the loss or decay of any one beneficial commerce or commodity tho' that place and all its inhabitants were for ever bury'd in the ocean  BUT tho' this term circulation has never been explain'd by those who insist so much on the advantages  that result from it there seems however to be some benefit of a similar kind arising from our incumbrances As indeed what human evil is there which is not attended with some advantage This we shall endeavour to explain that we may estimate the weight we ought to allow it  PUBLIC securities are with us become a kind of money and pass as readily at the current price as gold or silver Wherever any profitable undertaking offers itself however expensive there are never wanting hands enow to embrace it nor need a trader who has sums in the public stocks fear to launch out into the most extensive trade since he is possest of funds which will answer the most sudden demand that can be made upon him No merchant thinks it necessary to keep by him any considerable cash Bank stock or  India  bonds especially the latter serve to all the same purposes because he can dispose of them or pledge them to a banker in a quarter of an hour and at the same time they are not idle even when in his scritoire but bring him in a constant revenue In short our national debts furnish merchants with a species of money that is continually multiplying in their hands and produces sure gain beside the profits of their commerce This must enable them to trade upon less profit The small profit of the merchant renders the commodity cheaper causes a greater consumption quickens the labour of the  common people and helps to spread arts and industry thro' the whole society  THERE are also we may observe in  England  and in all states that have both commerce and public debts a set of men who are half merchants half stockholders and may be suppos'd willing to trade for small profits because commerce is not their principal or sole support and their revenues in the funds are a sure resource for themselves and their families Were there no funds great merchants wou'd have no expedient for realizing or securing any part of their profit but by making purchases of land and land has many disadvantages in comparison of funds Requiring more care and inspection it divides the time and attention of the merchant upon any tempting offer or extraordinary accident in trade it is not so easily converted into money and as it attracts too much both by the many natural pleasures it affords and the authority it gives it soon converts the citizen into the country gentleman More men therefore with large stocks and incomes may naturally be suppos'd to continue in trade where there are public debts And this it must be own'd is of some advantage to commerce by diminishing its profits promoting circulation and encouraging industry  ON this head I shall observe without interrupting the thread of the argument that the multiplicity of our public debts serves rather to sink the interest and that the more the government borrows the cheaper may they expect to borrow contrary to first appearance and contrary to common opinion The profits of trade have an influence on interest See discourse IV  BUT in opposition to these two favourable circumstances perhaps of no very great importance weigh the many disadvantages that attend our public debts in the whole  interior  oeconomy of the state You will find no comparison betwixt the ill and the good that result from them  First  'TIS certain that national debts cause a mighty confluence of people and riches to the capital by the great sums which are levy'd in the provinces to pay the interest of those debts and perhaps too by the advantages in trade above mention'd which they give the merchants in the capital above the rest of the kingdom The question is whether in our case it be for the public interest that so many privileges shou'd be conferr'd on  London  which has already arriv'd at such an enormous size and seems still encreasing Some men are apprehensive of the consequences For my part I cannot forbear thinking that tho' the head is undoubtedly too big for the body yet that great city is so happily situated that its excessive bulk causes less inconvenience than even a smaller capital to a greater kingdom There is more difference betwixt  the prices of all provisions in  Paris  and  Languedoc  than betwixt those in  London  and  Yorkshire  Secondly  PUBLIC stocks being a kind of papercredit have all the disadvantages attending that species of money They banish gold and silver from the most considerable commerce of the state reduce them to common circulation and by that means render all provisions and labour dearer than otherwise they wou'd be  Thirdly  THE taxes which are levy'd to pay the interest of these debts are a check upon industry heighten the price of labour and are an oppression on the poorer sort  Fourthly  As foreigners possess a share of our national funds they render the public in a manner tributary to them and may in time occasion the transport of our people and our industry  Fifthly  THE greatest part of public stock being always in the hands of idle people who live on their revenue our funds give great encouragement to an useless and inactive life  BUT tho' the injury that arises to commerce and industry from our public funds will appear upon balancing the whole very considerable it is trivial in comparison of the prejudice that results  to the state consider'd as a body politic which must support itself in the society of nations and have various transactions with other states in wars and negotiations The ill there is pure and unmixt without any favourable circumstance to atone for it And 'tis an ill too of a nature the highest and most important  WE have indeed been told that the public is no weaker upon account of its debts since they are mostly due amongst ourselves and bring as much property to one as they take from another 'Tis like transferring money from the right hand to the left which leaves the person neither richer nor poorer than before Such loose reasonings and specious comparisons will always pass where we judge not upon principles I ask Is it possible in the nature of things to overburthen a nation with taxes even where the sovereign resides amongst them The very doubt seems extravagant since 'tis requisite in every commonwealth that there be a certain proportion observ'd betwixt the laborious and the idle part of it But if all our present taxes be mortgag'd must we not invent new ones And may not this matter be carry'd to a length that is ruinous and destructive  IN every nation there are always some methods of levying money more easy than others suitable to the way of living of the people and the commodities  they make use of In  Britain  the excises upon malt and beer afford a very large revenue because the operations of malting and brewing are very tedious and are impossible to be conceal'd and at the same time these commodities are not so absolutely necessary to life as that the raising their price wou'd very much affect the poorer sort These taxes being all mortgag'd what difficulty to find new ones What vexation and ruin of the poor  DUTIES upon consumptions are more equal and easy than those upon possessions What a loss to the public that the former are all exhausted and that we must have recourse to the more grievous method of levying taxes  WERE all the proprietors of land only stewards to the public must not necessity force them to practise all the arts of oppression us'd by stewards where the absence and negligence of the proprietor render them secure against enquiry  'TWILL scarce be asserted that no bounds ought ever to be set to national debts and that the public wou'd be no weaker were or shillings in the pound land tax mortgag'd along with all the present customs and excises There is something therefore in the case beside the mere transferring of property from one hand to another In years  the posterity of those now in the coaches and of those upon the boxes will probably have chang'd places without affecting the public by these revolutions  I MUST confess that there is a strange supineness from long custom crept into all ranks of men with regard to public debts not unlike what divines so vehemently complain of with regard to their religious doctrines We all own that the most sanguine imagination cannot hope either that this or any future ministry will be possest of such rigid and steady frugality as to make any considerable progress in the payment of our debts or that the situation of foreign affairs will for any long time allow them leisure and tranquillity sufficient for such an undertaking  IN times of peace and security when alone it is possible to pay debt the money'd interest are averse to receive partial payments which they know not how to dispose of to advantage and the landed interest are averse to continue the taxes requisite for that purpose Why therefore shou'd a minister persevere in a measure so disagreeable to all parties For the sake I suppose of a posterity which be will never see or of a few reasonable reflecting people whose united interest perhaps will not be able to secure him the smallest borough in  England  'Tis not likely we shall ever find any minister so bad a politician With regard to these narrow destructive maxims of politics all ministers are expert enough  What then is to become of us  Were we ever so good Christians and ever so resign'd to providence this methinks were a curious question even consider'd as a speculative one and what it might not be altogether impossible  to form some conjectural solution of The events here will depend little upon the contingencies of battles negotiations intrigues and factions There seems to be a natural progress of things which may guide our reasoning As it wou'd have requir'd but a moderate share of prudence when we first began this practice of mortgaging to have foretold from the nature of men and of ministers that things wou'd necessarily be carry'd to the length we see so now that they have at last happily reach'd it it may not be difficult to guess at the consequence It must indeed be one of these two events either the nation must destroy public credit or public credit will destroy the nation 'Tis impossible they can both subsist after the manner they have been hitherto manag'd in this as well as in some other nations  THERE was indeed a scheme for the payment of our debts which was propos'd by an excellent citizen Mr  Hutchinson  above years ago and which was much approv'd of by some men of sense but never was likely to take effect He asserted that there was a fallacy in imagining that the public ow'd this debt for that really every individual ow'd a proportional share of it and paid in his taxes a proportional share of the interest beside the expences of levying these taxes Had we not better then says he make a proportional distribution of the debt amongst us and each of us contribute a  sum suitable to his property and by that means discharge at once all our funds and public mortgages He seems not to have consider'd that the laborious poor pay a considerable part of the taxes by their annual consumptions tho' they cou'd not advance at once a proportional part of the sum requir'd Not to mention that property in money and stock in trade might easily be conceal'd or disguis'd and that visible property in lands and houses wou'd really at last answer for the whole An inequality and oppression which never wou'd be submitted to But tho' this project is never likely to take place 'tis not altogether improbable that when the nation become heartily sick of their debts and are cruelly opprest by them some daring projector may arise with visionary schemes for their discharge And as public credit will begin by that time to be a little frail the least touch will destroy it as happen'd in  France  and in this manner it will  dye of the doctor  SOME neighbouring states practise an easy expedient by which they lighten their public debts The  French  have a custom as the  Romans  formerly had of augmenting their money and this the nation has been so much familiariz'd to that it hurts not public credit tho' it be really cutting off at once by an edict so much of their debts The  Dutch  diminish the interest without the consent of their creditors or which is the same thing they arbitrarily tax the funds as well as other property Cou'd we practise either of these methods we need never be opprest by the national debt and 'tis not impossible but one of these or some other method may at all adventures be try'd on the augmentation of our encumbrances and difficulties But people in this country are so good reasoners upon whatever regards their interest that such a practice will deceive no body and public credit will probably tumble at once by so dangerous a trial  BUT 'tis more probable that the breach of national faith will be the necessary effect of wars defeats misfortunes and public calamities or even perhaps of victories and conquests I must confess when I see princes and states fighting and quarreling amidst their debts funds and public mortgages it always brings to my mind a match of cudgelplaying fought in a  China  shop How can it be expected that sovereigns will spare a species of property which is pernicious to themselves and to the public when they have so little compassion on lives and properties which are useful to both Let the time come and surely it will come when the new funds created for the exigencies of the year are not subscrib'd to and raise not the money projected Suppose either that the cash of the nation is exhausted or that our faith which has been hitherto so ample begins to fail us Suppose that in this distress the nation is threaten'd with an invasion a rebellion is suspected or broke out at home a squadron cannot be equipt for want of pay victuals or repairs or even a foreign subsidy cannot be advanc'd What must a prince or minister do in such an emergence The right of  selfpreservation is unalienable in every individual much more in every community And the folly of our statesmen must then be greater than the folly of those who first contracted debt or what is more than that of those who trusted or continue to trust this security if these statesmen have the means of safety in their hands and do not employ it The funds created and mortgag'd will by that time bring in a large yearly revenue sufficient for the defence and security of the nation Money is perhaps lying in the exchequer ready for the discharge of the quarterly interest Necessity calls fear urges reason exhorts compassion alone exclaims The money will immediately be seiz'd for the current service under the most solemn protestations perhaps of being immediately replac'd But no more is requisite The whole fabric already tottering falls to the ground and buries thousands in its ruins And this I think may be called the  natural death  of public credit For to this period it tends as naturally as an animal body to its dissolution and destruction  So great dupes are the generality of mankind that notwithstanding such a violent shock to public credit as a voluntary bankruptcy in  England  wou'd occasion it wou'd not probably be long e're credit wou'd again revive in as flourishing a condition as before The present king of  France  during the late war borrow'd money at lower interest than ever his grandfather did and as low as the  British  parliament comparing the natural rate of interest in both kingdoms And tho' men are commonly more govern'd by what they have seen than by what they foresee with whatever certainty yet promises protestations fair appearances with the allurements of present interest have such powerful influence as few are able to resist Mankind are in all ages caught by the same baits The same tricks play'd over and over again still trepan them The heights of popularity and patriotism are still the beaten road to power and tyranny flattery to treachery standing armies to arbitrary government and the glory of God to the temporal interest of the clergy The fear of an everlasting destruction of credit allowing it to be an evil is a needless bugbear A prudent man in reality wou'd rather lend to the public immediately after they had taken a spunge to their debts than at present as much as an opulent knave even tho' one cou'd not force him to pay is a preferable debtor to an honest bankrupt For the former in order to carry on business may find it his interest to discharge his debts where they are not exorbitant The latter has it not in his power The reasoning of  Tacitus hist lib  as it is eternally true is very applicable to our present case  Sed vulgus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum aderat Stultissimus quisque pecuniis mercabatur Apud sapientes cassa habebantur quae neque dari neque accepi salva republica poterant  The public is a debtor whom no man can oblige to pay The only check which the creditors have on it is the interest of preserving credit an interest which may easily be overbalanc'd by a very great debt and by a difficult and extraordinary emergence even supposing that credit irrecoverable Not to mention that a present necessity often forces states into measures which are strictly speaking against their interest  THESE two events suppos'd above are calamitous but not the most calamitous Thousands are thereby sacrific'd to the safety of millions But we are not without danger that the contrary event may take place and that millions may be sacrific'd for ever to the temporary safety of thousands  I HAVE heard it has been computed that the whole creditors of the public natives and foreigners amount only to These make a figure at present on their income but in case of a public bankruptcy wou'd in an instant become the lowest as well as the most wretched of the people The dignity and authority of the landed gentry and nobility is much better rooted and wou'd render the contention very unequal if ever we come to that extremity One wou'd incline to assign to this event a very near period such as half a century had not our fathers prophesies of this kind been already found fallacious by the duration of our public credit so much beyond all reasonable expectation When the astrologers in  France  were every year foretelling the death of  Harry  the IV  These fellows  says he  must be right at last  We shall therefore be more cautious than to assign any precise date and shall content ourselves with pointing out the event in general  Our  popular government perhaps will render it difficult or dangerous for a minister to venture on so desperate an expedient as that of a voluntary bankruptcy And tho' the house of lords be altogether compos'd of the proprietors of lands and the house of commons chiefly and consequently neither of them can be suppos'd to have great property in the funds yet the connexions of the members may be so great with the proprietors as to render them more tenacious of public faith than prudence policy or even justice strictly speaking requires And perhaps too our foreign enemies or rather enemy for we have but one to dread may be so politic as to discover that our safety lyes in despair and may not therefore show the danger open and barefac'd 'till it be inevitable The balance of power in  Europe  our grandfathers our fathers and we have all justly esteem'd too unequal to be preserv'd without our attention and assistance But our  children weary with the struggle and fetter'd with incumbrances may sit down secure and see their neighbours opprest and conquer'd till at last they themselves and their creditors lye both at the mercy of the conqueror And this may properly enough be denominated the  violent death  of our public credit  THESE seem to be the events which are not very remote and which reason foresees as clearly almost as she can do any thing that lyes in the womb of time And tho' the antients maintain'd that in order to reach the gift of prophesy a certain divine fury or madness was requisite one may safely affirm that in order to deliver such prophesies as these no more is necessary than merely to be in one's senses free from the influence of popular madness and delusion  DISCOURSE IX  Of some remarkable customs  I SHALL observe three remarkable customs in three celebrated governments and shall conclude from the whole that all general maxims in politics ought to be establish'd with great reserve and that irregular and extraordinary appearances are frequently discover'd in the moral as well as in the physical world The former perhaps we can better account for after they happen from springs and principles of which every one has within himself or from obvious observation the strongest assurance and conviction But 'tis often fully as impossible for human prudence before hand to foresee and foretell them  I ONE wou'd think it essential to every supreme council or assembly which debates that entire liberty of speech shou'd be granted to every member and that all motions or reasonings shou'd be receiv'd which can any way tend to illustrate the point under deliberation One wou'd conclude with still greater assurance that after a motion was made which was voted and approv'd by that assembly in which the legislature is lodg'd the member who made the motion must for ever be  exempted from farther trial and enquiry But no political maxim can at first sight appear more undisputable than that he must at least be secur'd from all inferior jurisdiction and that nothing less than the same supreme legislative assembly in their subsequent meetings cou'd render him accountable for those motions and harangues which they had before approv'd of But these axioms however irrefragable they may appear have all fail'd in the  Athenian  government from causes and principles too which appear almost inevitable  BY the  or  indictment of illegality  tho' it has not been remark'd by antiquaries or commentators any man was try'd and punish'd in a common court of judicature for any law which had pass'd upon his motion in the assembly of the people if that law appeared to the court unjust or prejudicial to the public Thus  Demosthenes  finding that ship money was levy'd irregularly and that the poor bore the same burthen as the rich in equipping the gallies corrected this inequality by a very useful law which proportion'd the expence to the revenue and income of each individual He mov'd for this law in the assembly he prov'd its advantages  His harangue for it is still extant    he convinc'd the people the only legislature in  Athens  the law pass'd and was carried into execution And yet he was try'd in a criminal court for that law upon the complaint  of the rich who resented the alteration he had introduc'd into the finances  Pro Ctesiphonte  He was indeed acquitted upon proving anew the usefulness of his law  Ctesiphon  mov'd in the assembly of the people that particular honours shou'd be conferr'd on  Demosthenes  as on a citizen affectionate and useful to the commonwealth The people convinc'd of this truth voted those honours Yet was  Ctesiphon  try'd by the  It was asserted amongst other topics that  Demosthenes  was not a good citizen nor affectionate to the commonwealth And the orator was called upon to defend his friend and consequently himself which he executed by that sublime piece of eloquence that has ever since been the admiration of mankind  AFTER the fatal battle of  Chaeronea  a law was past upon the motion of  Hyperides  giving liberty to slaves and enrolling them in the troops  Plutarch in vita decem oratorum Demosthenes  gives a different account of this law  contra Aristogiton orat  II He says that its purport was to render the  or to restore the privilege of bearing offices to those who had been declar'd incapable Perhaps these were both clauses of the same law  On account of this law the orator was afterwards try'd by the indictment above mention'd and defended himself amongst other topics by that stroke celebrated by  Plutarch  and  Longinus It was not I  said he  that mov'd for this law It was the necessities of war it was the battle of Chaeronea  The orations of  Demosthenes  abound with many instances of trials of this nature and prove clearly that nothing was more commonly practis'd  THE  Athenian  democracy was such a mobbish government as we can scarce form a notion of in the present age of the world The whole collective body of the people voted in every law without any limitation of property without any distinction of rank without controul from any magistracy or senate  THE senate of the Bean was only a less numerous mob chosen by lot from among the people and their authority was not great  and consequently with little regard to order justice or prudence The  Athenians  soon became sensible of the mischiefs attending this constitution But being averse to the checking themselves by any rule or restriction they resolv'd at least to check their demagogues or counsellors by the fear of future punishment and enquiry They accordingly instituted this remarkable law a law esteem'd so essential to their government that  Aeschines  insists on it as a known truth that were it abolish'd or neglected it were impossible for the democracy to subsist  In Ctesiphontem  'Tis remarkable that the first step after the dissolution of the democracy by  Critias  and the Thirty was to annul the  as we learn from  Demosthenes  The orator in this oration gives us the words of the law establishing the  Page  ex edit Aldi  And he accounts for it from the same principles that we here reason upon  THE people fear'd not any ill consequences to liberty from the authority of the criminal courts because these were nothing but very numerous juries chosen by lot from amongst the people And they consider'd themselves justly as in a state of pupillage where they had an authority after they came to the use of reason not only to retract and controul whatever had been determin'd but to punish any guardian for measures which they had embrac'd by his persuasion The same law had place in  Thebes  Plut in vita Pelop  and for the same reason  IT appears to have been an usual practice in  Athens  on the establishment of any law esteem'd very useful or popular to prohibit for ever its abrogation and repeal Thus the demagogue who diverted all the public revenues to the support of shows and spectacles made it criminal so much as to move for a reversement of this law  Demost Olynth    Thus  Leptines  mov'd for a law not only to recal all the immunities formerly granted but to deprive the people for the future of the power of granting any more  Demost contra Lept  Thus all bills of attainder  Demost contra Aristocratem  were forbid or laws that affect one  Athenian  without extending to the whole  commonwealth These absurd clauses by which the legislature vainly attempted to bind itself for ever proceeded from an universal sense of the levity and inconstancy of the people  II A WHEEL within a wheel such as we observe in the  German  empire is consider'd by lord  Shaftsbury  ESSAY on the freedom of wit and humour Part sect  as an absurdity in politics But what must we say to two equal wheels which govern the same political machine without any mutual check controul or subordination and yet preserve the greatest harmony and concord To establish two distinct legislatures each of which possesses full and absolute authority within itself and stands in no need of the other's assistance in order to give validity to its acts this may appear before hand altogether impracticable as long as men are actuated by the passions of ambition emulation and avarice which have been hitherto their chief governing principles And shou'd I assert that the state I have in my eye was divided by two distinct factions each of which predominated in a distinct legislature and yet produc'd no clashing of these independent powers the supposition may appear almost incredible And if to augment the paradox I shou'd affirm that this disjointed irregular government was the most active triumphant and illustrious commonwealth that ever yet appear'd on  the stage of the world I shou'd certainly be told that such a political chimera was as absurd as any vision of the poets But there is no need for searching long in order to prove the reality of the foregoing suppositions For this was actually the case with the  Roman  republic  THE legislative power was there lodged both in the  comitia centuriata  and  comitia tributa  In the former 'tis well known the people voted accordingly to their  census  so that when the first class was unanimous as commonly happen'd tho' it contain'd not perhaps the hundredth part of the commonwealth it determin'd the whole and with the authority of the senate establish'd a law In the latter every vote was alike and as the authority of the senate was not there requisite the lower people entirely prevail'd and gave law to the whole state In all party divisions at first betwixt the  Patricians  and  Plebeians  afterwards betwixt the nobles and the people the interest of the Aristocracy was predominant in the first legislature that of the Democracy in the second The one cou'd always destroy what the other had establish'd Nay the one by a sudden and unforeseen motion might take the start of the other and totally annihilate its rival by a vote which from the nature of the constitution had the full authority of a law But no such contest or struggle is observ'd in the history of  Rome  No instance of a quarrel betwixt these two legislatures  tho' many betwixt the parties that govern'd in each Whence arose this concord which may seem so extraordinary  THE legislature establish'd at  Rome  by the authority of  Servius Tullius  was the  comitia centuriata  which after the expulsion of the kings render'd the government for some time altogether aristocratical But the people having numbers and force on their side and being elated with frequent conquests and victories in their foreign wars always prevail'd when push'd to extremities and first extorted from the senate the magistracy of the tribunes and then the legislative power of the  comitia tributa  It then behov'd the nobles to be more careful than ever not to provoke the people For beside the force which the latter were always possest of they had now got possession of legal authority and cou'd instantly break in pieces any order or institution which directly oppos'd them By intrigue by influence by money by combination and by the respect paid their character the nobles might often prevail and direct the whole machine of government But had they openly set their  comitia centuriata  in oposition to the  tributa  they had soon lost the advantage of that institution along with their consuls praetors ediles and all the magistrates elected by it But the  comitia tributa  not having the same reason for respecting the  centuriata  frequently repeal'd laws favourable to  the aristocracy They limited the authority of the nobles protected the people from oppression and controul'd the actions of the senate and magistracy The  centuriata  found it convenient always to submit and tho' equal in authority yet being inferior in power durst never directly give any shock to the other legislature either by repealing its laws or establishing laws which it foresaw wou'd soon be repeal'd by it  NO instance is found of any opposition or struggle betwixt these  comitia  except one slight attempt of this kind mention'd by  Appian  in the d book of his civil wars  Mark Anthony  resolving to deprive  Decimus Brutus  of the government of  Cisalpine Gaul  rail'd in the  Forum  and call'd one of the  comitia  in order to prevent the meeting of the other which had been order'd by the senate But affairs were then fallen into such confusion and the  Roman  constitution was so near its last extremity that no inserence can be drawn from such an expedient This contest besides was founded more on form than party 'Twas the senate who order'd the  comitia tributa  that they might obstruct the meeting of the  centuriata  which by the constitution or at least forms of the government cou'd alone dispose of provinces  Cicero  was recall'd by the  comitia centuriata  tho' banish'd by the  tributa  that is by a  plebiscitum  But his banishment we may observe never was consider'd as a legal deed arising from the free choice and inclination of the people It was always ascrib'd to the violence alone of  Clodius  and the disorders introduc'd by him into the government  III THE  third  custom we propos'd to observe regards  England  and tho' it be not so important as those which we have pointed out in  Athens  and  Rome  it is no less singular and remarkable 'Tis a maxim in politics which we readily admit as undisputed and universal that a power however great when granted by law to an eminent magistrate is not so dangerous to liberty as an authority however inconsiderable which he acquires from violence and usurpation For besides that the law always limits every power which it bestows the very receiving it as a concession establishes the authority whence it is deriv'd and preserves the harmony of the constitution By the same right that one prerogative is assum'd without law another may also be claim'd and another with still greater facility While the first usurpations both serve as precedents to the following and give force to maintain them Hence the heroism of  Hampden  who sustain'd the whole violence of royal prosecution rather than pay a tax of shillings not impos'd by parliament Hence the care of all  English  patriots to guard against the first encroachments  of the crown And hence alone the existence at this day of  English  liberty  THERE is however one occasion wherein the parliament has departed from this maxim and that is in the  pressing of seamen  The exercise of an illegal power is here tacitly permitted in the crown and tho' it has frequently been deliberated on how that power might be render'd legal and under what restrictions it might be granted to the sovereign no safe expedient cou'd ever be propos'd for that purpose and the danger to liberty always appear'd greater from law than from usurpation While this power is exercis'd to no other end than to man the navy men willingly submit to it from a sense of its use and necessity and the sailors who are alone affected by it find no body to support them in claiming the rights and privileges which the law grants without distinction to all  English  subjects But were this power on any occasion made an instrument of faction or ministerial tyranny the opposite faction and indeed all lovers of their country wou'd immediately take the alarm and support the injur'd party The liberty of  Englishmen  wou'd be asserted Juries wou'd be implacable and the tools of tyranny acting both against law and equity wou'd meet with the severest vengeance On the other hand were the parliament to grant such an authority they wou'd probably fall into one of these two inconveniencies They wou'd either bestow it under so  many restrictions as wou'd make it lose its effects by cramping the authority of the crown or they wou'd render it so large and comprehensive as might give occasion to great abuses for which we cou'd in that case have no remedy The very illegality of the power at present prevents its abuses by affording so easy a remedy against them  I PRETEND not by this reasoning to exclude all possibility of contriving a register for seamen which might mann the navy without being dangerous to liberty I only observe that no satisfactory scheme of that nature has yet been propos'd Rather than adopt any project hitherto invented we continue a practice seemingly the most absurd and unaccountable Authority in times of full internal peace and concord is arm'd against law A continu'd and open usurpation in the crown is permitted amidst the greatest jealousy and watchfulness in the people nay proceeding from those very principles Liberty in a country of the highest liberty is left entirely to its own defence without any countenance or protection The wild state of nature is renew'd in one of the most civiliz'd societies of mankind And great violences and disorders amongst the people the most humane and the best natur'd are committed with impunity while the one party pleads obedience to the supreme magistrate the other the permission of fundamental laws  DISCOURSE X  Of the Populousness of antient Nations  AN eminent clergyman in  Edinburgh  having wrote some years ago a discourse on the same question with this of the populousness of antient nations was pleas'd lately to communicate it to the author It maintain'd the opposite side of the argument to what is here insisted on and contained much erudition and good reasoning The author acknowledges to have borrow'd with some variations from that discourse two computations that with regard to the number of inhabitants in  Belgium  and that with regard to those in  Epirus  If this learned gentleman be prevail'd on to publish his differtation it will serve to give great light into the present question the most curious and important of all questions of erudition  THERE is very little ground either from reason or experience to conclude the universe eternal or incorruptible The continual and rapid motion of matter the violent revolutions with which every part is agitated the changes remark'd in the heavens the plain traces as well as tradition of an universal deluge or general convulsion of the elements all these prove strongly the mortality of this fabric of the world and its passage by corruption or dissolution from one state or order to another It must therefore have its infancy youth manhood and old age as well as each individual form which it contains and 'tis probable that in all these variations man equally with every animal  and vegetable will partake In the flourishing age of the world it may be expected that the human species shou'd possess greater vigour both of mind and body more prosperous health higher spirits longer life and a stronger inclination and power of generation But if the general system of things and human society of course have any such gradual revolutions they are too slow to be discernible in that short period which is comprehended by history and tradition Stature and force of body length of life even courage and extent of genius seem hitherto to have been naturally in all ages pretty much the same The arts and sciences indeed have flourish'd in one period and have decay'd in another But we may observe that at the time when they rose to greatest perfection amongst one people they were perhaps totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations and tho' they universally decay'd in one age yet in a succeeding generation they again reviv'd and diffus'd themselves over the world As far therefore as observation reaches there is no universal difference discernible in the human species and tho' it were allow'd that the universe like an animal body had a natural progress from infancy to old age yet as it must still be uncertain whether at present it be advancing to its point of perfection or declining from it we cannot thence presuppose any decay in human nature  Collumela  says lib cap that in  Aegypt  and  Africa  the bearing of twins was frequent and even customary  gemini parties familiares ac paene solennes sunt  If this was true there is a physical difference both in countries and ages For travellers make no such remark of those countries at present On the contrary we are apt to suppose the northern nations more fertile As those two countries were provinces of the  Roman  empire it is difficult tho' not altogether absurd to suppose that such a man as  Columella  might be mistaken with regard to them  To  prove therefore or account for the greater populousness of antiquity by the imaginary youth or vigour of the world will scarce be admitted by any just reasoner These  general physical  causes ought entirely to be excluded from that question  THERE are indeed some more  particular physical  causes of great importance Diseases are mention'd in antiquity which are almost unknown to modern medicine and new diseases have arisen and propagated themselves of which there are no traces in ancient history And in this particular we may observe upon comparison that the disadvantage is very much on the side of the moderns Not to mention some others of less importance the small pox commits such ravages as would almost alone account for the great superiority suppos'd in antient times The tenth or the twelfth part of mankind destroy'd every generation shou'd make a vast difference it may be thought in the numbers of the people and when join'd to venereal distempers a new plague diffus'd every where this disease is perhaps equivalent by its constant operation to the three great scourges of mankind war  pestilence and famine Were it certain therefore that antient times were more populous than the present and cou'd no moral causes be assign'd for so great a change these physical causes alone in the opinion of many wou'd be sufficient to give us satisfaction on that head  BUT is it certain that antiquity was so much more populous as is pretended The extravagancies of  Vossius  with regard to this subject are well known But an author of much greater genius and discernment has ventur'd to affirm that according to the best computations which these subjects will admit of there are not now the fiftieth part of mankind on the face of the earth which existed in the time of  Julius Caesar  Lettres Persanes  See also  L'Esprit des Loix liv  chap  It may easily be observ'd that the comparisons in this case must be very imperfect even tho' we confine ourselves to the scene of antient history  Europe  and the nations about the  Mediterranean  We know not exactly the numbers of any  European  kingdom or even city at present How can we pretend to calculate those of antient cities and states where historians have left us such imperfect traces For my part the matter appears to me so uncertain that as I intend to throw together some reflexions on that head I shall intermingle the enquiry concerning  causes  with that concerning  facts  which ought never to be admitted where the facts can be ascertain'd with any tolerable assurance We shall  first  consider whether it be probable from what we know of the situation of society in both periods that antiquity must have been more populous  Secondly  Whether in reality it was so If I can make appear that the conclusion is not so certain as is pretended in favour of antiquity 'tis all I aspire to  IN general we may observe that the question with regard to the comparative populousness of ages or kingdoms implies very important consequences and commonly determines concerning the preference of their whole police manners and constitution of government For as there is in all men both male and female a desire and power of generation more active than is ever universally exerted the restraints which it lyes under must proceed from some difficulties in mens situation which it belongs to a wise legislature carefully to observe and remove Almost every man who thinks he can maintain a family will have one and the human species at this rate of propagation wou'd more than double every generation were every one coupled as soon as he comes to the age of puberty How fast do mankind multiply in every colony or new settlement where it is an easy matter to provide for a family and where men are no way straitned or confin'd as in long establish'd governments History  tells us frequently of plagues that have swept away the third or fourth part of a people Yet in a generation or two the destruction was not perceiv'd and the society had again acquir'd their former number The lands that were cultivated the houses built the commodities rais'd the riches acquir'd enabled the people who escap'd immediately to marry and to rear families which supply'd the place of those who had perish'd  THIS too is a good reason why the small pox does not depopulate countries so much as may at first sight be imagin'd Where there is room for more people they will always arise even without the assistance of naturalization bills 'Tis remarkt by  Don Geronimo de Ustariz  that the provinces of  Spain  which send most people to the  Indies  are most populous which proceeds from their superior riches  And for a like reason every wise just and mild government by rendering the condition of its subjects easy and secure will always abound most in people as well as in commodities and riches A country indeed whose climate and soil are fitted for vines will naturally be more populous than one which produces only corn and that more populous than one which is only fitted for pasturage But if every thing else be equal it seems natural to expect that whereever there are most happiness and virtue and the wisest institutions there will also be most people  THE question therefore concerning the populousness of antient and modern times being allow'd of great importance 'twill be requisite if we wou'd  bring it to some determination to compare both the  domestic  and  political  situation of these two periods in order to judge of the facts by their moral causes which is the first view in which we propos'd to consider them  THE chief difference betwixt the  domestic  oeconomy of the antients and that of the moderns consists in the practice of slavery which prevail'd amongst the former and which has been abolish'd for some centuries throughout the greatest part of  Europe  Some passionate admirers of the antients and zealous partizans of civil liberty for these sentiments as they are both of them in the main extremely just are also found to be almost inseparable cannot forbear regreting the loss of this institution and whilst they brand all submission to the government of a single person with the harsh denomination of slavery they wou'd gladly subject the greatest part of mankind to real slavery and subjection But to one who considers cooly of the subject it will appear that human nature in general really enjoys more liberty at present in the most arbitrary government of  Europe  than it ever did during the most flourishing period of antient times As much as submission to a petty prince whose dominions extend not beyond a single city is more grievous than obedience to a great monarch so much is domestic slavery more cruel and oppressive than any civil subjection whatsoever  The more the master is remov'd from us in place and rank the greater liberty do we enjoy the less are our actions inspected and controul'd and the fainter that cruel comparison becomes betwixt our own subjection and the freedom and even dominion of another The remains that are left of domestic slavery in our colonies and amongst some  European  nations wou'd never surely create a desire os rendering it more universal The little humanity commonly observ'd in persons accustom'd from their infancy to exercise so great authority over their fellow creatures and to trample upon human nature were sufficient alone to disgust us with that authority Nor can a more probable reason be given for the severe I might say barbarous manners of antient times than the practice of domestic slavery by which every man of rank was render'd a petty tyrant and educated amidst the flattery submission and low debasement of his slaves  ACCORDING to the antient practice all checks were on the inferior to restrain him to the duty of submission none on the superior to engage him to the reciprocal duties of gentleness and humanity In modern times a bad servant finds not easily a good master nor a bad master a good servant and the checks are mutual suitable to the inviolate and eternal laws of reason and equity  THE custom of exposing old useless or sick slaves in an island of the  Tyber  there to starve seems to have been pretty common in  Rome  and whoever recover'd after having been so expos'd had his liberty given him by an edict of the emperor  Claudius  where it was likeways forbid to kill any slave merely for old age or sickness  Suetonius in vita Claudii  But supposing that this edict was strictly obey'd wou'd it better the domestic treatment of slaves or render their lives much more comfortable We may imagine what others wou'd practise when it was the profest maxim of the elder  Cato  to sell his superannuated slaves for any price rather than maintain what he esteem'd an useless burthen  Plut in vita Catonis  THE  ergastula  or dungeons where slaves in chains were beat to work were very common all over  Italy Columella  Lib cap  advises that they be always built under ground and recommends  Id lib cap  it as the duty of a careful overseer to call over every day the names of these slaves like the mustering of a regiment or ship's company in order to know presently when any of them had deserted A proof of the frequency of these  ergastula  and of the great number of slaves confin'd in them  Partem Italiae ergastula a solitudine vindicant  says  Livy  ACHAIN'D slave for a porter was usual in  Rome  as appears from  Ovid  Amor  lib eleg  and other authors  Sueton de claris rhetor  So also the antient poet  Janitoris tintinnire impedimenta audio  Had not these people shaken off all sense of compassion towards that unhappy part of their species wou'd they have presented all their friends at the first entrance with such an image of the severity of the master and misery of the slave  NOTHING so common in all trials even of civil causes as to call for the evidence of slaves which was always extorted by the most exquisite torments  Demosthenes  says  In Oneterem orat    that where it was possible to produce for the same fact either freemen or slaves as witnesses the judges always preferr'd the torturing of slaves as a more certain and infallible evidence  THE same practice was common in  Rome  but  Cicero  seems not to think this evidence so certain as the testimony of free citizens  Pro Caelio  Seneca  draws a picture of that disorderly luxury which changes day into night and night into day and inverts every stated hour of every office in life Amongst other circumstances such as displacing the meals and time of bathing he mentions that regularly about the third hour of the night the  neighbours of one who indulges this false refinement hear the noise of whips and lashes and upon enquiry find he is then taking an account of the conduct of his servants and giving them due correction and discipline This is not remark'd as an instance of cruelty but only of disorder which even in actions the most usual and methodical changes the fixt hours that an establish'd custom had assign'd them  Epist  THE inhuman sports exhibited at  Rome  may justly be consider'd too as an effect of the people's contempt for slaves and was also a great cause of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers Who can read the accounts of the amphitheatrical entertainments without horror Or who is surpris'd that the emperors shou'd treat that people in the same way the people treated their inferiors One's humanity on that occasion is apt to renew the barbarous wish of  Caligula  that the people had but one neck A man cou'd almost be pleas'd by a single blow to put an end to such a race of monsters You may thank God says the author above cited  epist  addressing himself to the  Romans  people that you have a master  viz  the mild and merciful  Nero  who is incapable of learning cruelty from your example This was spoke in the beginning of his reign But he fitted them very well afterwards and no doubt was considerably improv'd by the sight of the barbarous objects to which he had from his infancy been accustom'd  BUT our present business is only to consider the influence of slavery on the populousness of a state 'Tis pretended that in this particular the antient practice has infinitely the advantage and was the the chief cause of that extreme populousness which  is suppos'd in those times At present all masters discourage the marrying of their male servants and admit not by any means the marriage of the female who are then suppos'd altogether incapacitated for their service But where the property of the servants is lodg'd in the master their marriage and sertility form his riches and bring him a succession of slaves that supply the place of those whom age and infirmity have disabled He encourages therefore their propagation as much as that of his cattle rears the young with the same care and educates them to some art or calling which may render them more useful or valuable to him The opulent are by this policy interested in the being at least tho' not the wellbeing of the poor and enrich themselves by encreasing the number and industry of those who are subjected to them Each man being a sovereign in his own family has the same interest with regard to it as the prince with regard to the state and has not like the prince any opposite motives of ambition or vainglory which may lead him to depopulate his little sovereignty All of it is at all times under his eye and he has leisure to inspect the most minute detail of the marriage and education of his subjects  WE may here observe that if domestic slavery really encreas'd populousness it wou'd be an exception to the general rule that the happiness of any society and its populousness are necessary attendants A master from humour or interest may make his slaves very unhappy and yet be careful from interest to encrease their number Their marriage is not a matter of choice with them no more than any other action of their life  SUCH are the consequences of domestic slavery according to the first aspect and appearance of things But if we enter deeper into the subject we shall perhaps find reason to retract our hasty determinations The comparison is shocking betwixt the management of human creatures and that of cattle but being extremely just when apply'd to the present subject it may be proper to trace the consequences of it At the capital near all great cities in all populous rich industrious provinces few cattle are bred Provisions lodging attendance labour are there dear and men find better their account in buying the cattle after they come to a certain age from the remoter and cheaper countries These are consequently the only breeding countries for cattle and by a parity of reason for men too when the latter are put on the same footing with the former To rear a child in  London  till he cou'd be serviceable wou'd cost much dearer than to buy one of the same age from  Scotland  or  Ireland  where he had been rais'd in a cottage cover'd with rags and fed on oatmeal or potatoes Those who had slaves therefore in all the richer and more populous countries wou'd discourage the pregnancy of the females and either  prevent or destroy the birth The human species wou'd perish in those places where it ought to encrease the fastest and a perpetual recruit be needed from all the poorer and more desart provinces Such a continu'd drain wou'd tend mightily to depopulate the state and render great cities ten times more destructive than with us where every man is master of himself and provides for his children from the powerful instinct of nature not the calculations of sordid interest If  London  at present without much encreasing needs a yearly recruit from the country of people as is commonly computed What must it require if the greatest part of the tradesmen and common people were slaves and were hinder'd from breeding by their avaricious masters  ALL antient authors tell us that there was a perpetual flux of slaves to  Italy  from the remoter provinces particularly  Syria Cilicia  TEN thousand slaves in a day have been often sold for the use of the  Romans  at  Delus  in  Cilicia Strabo  lib  Cappadocia  the lesser  Asia Thrace  and  Egypt  Yet the number of people encreas'd not in  Italy  and writers complain of the continual decay of industry and agriculture  Columella  lib  Proem  et cap et  Varro  lib cap  Horace  lib od  Tacit Annal  lib cap  Sueton in vita Aug  cap  Plin  lib cap  Where then is that extreme fertility of the  Roman  slaves which is commonly suppos'd  So far from multiplying they cou'd not it seems so much as keep up the stock without immense recruits And tho' great numbers were continually manumitted and converted into  Roman  citizens the numbers even of these did not encrease  Minore indies plebe ingenua  says  Tacitus ann  lib cap  till the freedom of the city was communicated to foreign provinces  THE term for a slave born and bred in the family was  verna  As  servus  was the name of the genus and  verna  of the species without any correlative this forms a strong presumption that the latter were by far the least numerous 'Tis an universal observation which we may form upon language that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other in numbers rank or consideration there are always correlative terms invented which answer to both the parts and express their mutual relation If they bear no proportion to each other the term is only invented for the less and marks its distinction from the whole Thus man and woman master and servant father and son prince and subject stranger and citizen are correlative terms But the words seaman carpenter smith taylor  c  have no correspondent terms which express those who are no seaman no carpenter  c  Languages differ very much with regard to the particular words where this distinction obtains and may thence afford very strong inferences concerning the manners and customs of different nations The military government of the  Roman  emperors had exalted the soldiery so high that they balanc'd all the other orders of the state Hence  miles  and  paganus  became relative terms a thing till then unknown to antient and still so to modern languages Modern superstition exalted the clergy so high that they overbalanced the whole state Hence  clergy  and  laity  are terms oppos'd in all modern languages and in these alone And from the same principles I infer that if the number of slaves bought by the  Romans  from foreign countries had not extremely exceeded those bred at home  verna  wou'd have had a correlative which wou'd have exprest the former species of slaves But these it wou'd seem compos'd the main body of the antient slaves and the latter were but a few exceptions  and these slaves seem to have  been intitled by custom to privileges and indulgences beyond others a sufficient reason why the masters wou'd not be fond of rearing many of that kind  Verna  is us'd by  Roman  writers as a word equivalent to  scurra  on account of the petulance and impudence of those slaves  Mart  lib cp  Horace  also mentions the  vernae procaces  and  Petronius  cap  vernula urbanitas Seneca de provid  cap  vernularum licentia  Whoever is acquainted with the maxims of our planters will acknowledge the justness of this observation  'TIS computed in the  West Indies  that a stock of slaves grow worse five  per cent  every year unless new slaves be bought to recruit them They are not able to keep up their own number even in those warm countries where cloaths and provisions are so easily got How much more must this happen in  European  countries and in or near great cities  Atticus  is much prais'd by his historian for the care which he took in recruiting his family from the slaves born in it  Corn Nepes in vita Attici  May we not thence infer that that practice was not then very common  THE names of slaves in the  Greek  comedies  Syrus Mysus Geta Thrax Davus Lydus Phryx  c afford a presumption that at  Athens  at least most of the slaves were imported from foreign nations  The  Athenians  says  Strabo  LIB  gave to their slaves either the names of the nations whence they were bought as  Lydus Syrus  or the names that were most common amongst those nations as  Manes  or  Midas  to a  Phrygian Tibias  to a  Paphlagonian  Demosthenes  after having mention'd a law which forbid any man to strike the slave of another praises the humanity of this law and adds that if the barbarians from whom slaves were bought had information that their countrymen met with such gentle treatment they wou'd entertain a great esteem for the  Athenians  In Midiam  p  ex edit Aldi  Isocrates  Panegyr  also says that all the  Greek  slaves were barbarians  'TIS well known that  Demosthenes  in his nonage had been defrauded of a large fortune by his tutors and that afterwards he recover'd by a prosecution at law the value of his patrimony His orations on that occasion still remain and contain a very exact detail of the whole substance left by his father  In Aphobum orat    in money merchandise houses and slaves along with the value of each particular Amongst the rest were slaves handicraftsmen  viz  swordcutlers and cabinetmakers  makers of those beds which the antients lay upon at meals  all males not a word of any wives children or  family which they certainly wou'd have had had it been a common custom at  Athens  to breed from the slaves And the value of the whole must have depended very much on that circumstance No female slaves are even so much as mention'd except some chambermaids that belong'd to his mother This argument has great force if it be not altogether decisive  CONSIDER this passage of  Plutarch  In vita Catenit  speaking of the elder  Cato  He had a great number of slaves which he took care to buy at the sales of prisoners of war and he chose them young that they might easily be accustom'd to any diet or manner of life and be instructed in any business or labour as men teach any thing to young dogs or horsesAnd esteeming love the chief source of all disorders he allow'd the male slaves to have a commerce with the female in his family upon paying a certain sum for this privilege But he strictly forbid all intrigues out of his family  Are there any symptoms in this narration of that care which is suppos'd in the antients of the marriage and propagation of their slaves If that was a common practice founded on general interest it wou'd surely have been embrac'd by  Cato  who was a great occonomist and  liv'd in times when the antient frugality and simplicity of manners were still in credit and reputation  IT is expressly remark'd by the writers of the  Roman  law that scarce any ever purchase slaves with a view of breeding from them  Non temere ancillae ejus rei causa comparantur ut pariant Digest  lib tit  de haered petit lex  The following texts are to the same purpose  Spadonem morbosum non esse neque vitiosum verius mihi videtur sed sanum esse sicuti illum qui unum testiculum habet qui etiam generare potest Digest  lib tit  de

si vulvae vitio hoc contingit morbosam esse Id lex  It has even been doubted whether a woman pregnant was morbid or vitiated and it is determined that she is sound not on account of the value of her offspring but because it is the natural part or office of women to bear children  Si mulier praegnans venerit inter omnes convenit sanam eam esse Maximum enim ac praecipuum munus faeminarum accipere

sit sana sit Si vitio corporis centra Id  OUR lackeys and chambermaids I own do not serve much to multiply the species But the antients beside those who attended on their person had all their labour perform'd by slaves who liv'd many of them in their family and some great men possest to the number of If there be any  suspicion therefore that this institution was unfavourable to propagation and the same reason at least in part holds with regard to antient slaves as well as modern servants how destructive must slavery have prov'd  HISTORY mentions a  Roman  nobleman who had slaves under the same roof with him and having been assassinated at home by the furious revenge of one of them the law was executed with rigour and all without exception were put to death  Tacit ann  lib cap  Many other  Roman  noblemen had families equally or more numerous and I believe every one will allow that this wou'd scarce be practicable were we to suppose all the slaves marry'd and the females to be

Saturn cap These form strong presumptions against the marriage and propagation of the family slaves  So early as the poet  Hesiod  Opera Dies  lib also  marry'd slaves whether male or female were esteem'd very inconvenient How much more where families had encreas'd to such an enormous size as in  Rome  and the antient simplicity of manners was banish'd from all ranks of people  Xenophon  in his oeconomics where he gives directions for the management of a farm recommends a strict care and attention of laying the male and female slaves at a distance from each other He seems not to suppose they are ever marry'd The only slaves amongst the  Greeks  that appear to have continu'd their own breed were the  Helotes  who had houses apart and were more the slaves of the public than of individuals  Strabo  lib  THE antients talk so frequently of a fixt stated portion of provisions assign'd to each slave  SEE  Cato de re rustica  cap  Donatus in Phormion    Seneca epist    that we are naturally led to conclude that slaves liv'd almost all single and receiv'd that portion as a kind of board wages  THE practice indeed of marrying the slaves seems not to have been very common even amongst the country labourers where it is more naturally to be expected  Cato  De re rust  cap  enumerating the slaves requisite to labour a vineyard of a hundred acres makes them amount to the overseer and his wife  villicus  and  villica  and male slaves For an olive plantation of acres the overseer and his wife and II male slaves And so in proportion to a greater or less plantation or vineyard  Varro  LIB cap  citing this passage of  Cato  allows his computation to be just in every other respect except the last For as it is requisite says he to have an overseer and his wife whether the vineyard or plantation be great or small this must alter the exactness of the proportion Had  Cato  's computation been erroneous in any other respect it had certainly been corrected by  Varro  who seems fond of discovering so trivial an error  THE same author  LIB cap  as well as  Columella  LIB cap  recommends it as requisite to give a wife to the overseer in order to attach him the more strongly to his master's service This was therefore a peculiar indulgence granted to a slave in whom so great a confidence was repos'd  IN the same place  Varro  mentions it as an useful precaution not to buy too many slaves from the same nation lest they beget factions and seditions in the family A presumption that in  Italy  the greatest part even of the country labouring slaves for he speaks of no other were bought from the remoter provinces All the world knows that the family slaves in  Rome  who were instruments of show and luxury were commonly imported from the East  Hoc profecere  says  Pliny  speaking of the jealous care of masters  mancipiorum legiones et in  domo turba externa ac servorum quoque causa nomenclator adhibendus  LIB cap  IT is indeed recommended by  Varro  LIB cap  to propagate young shepherds in the family from the old ones For as grasing farms were commonly in remote and cheap places and each shepherd liv'd in a cottage apart his marriage and encrease were not liable to the same inconveniencies as in dearer places and where many servants liv'd in a family which was universally the case in such of the  Roman  farms as produc'd wine or corn If we consider this exception with regard to shepherds and weigh the reason of it it will serve for a strong confirmation of all our foregoing suspicions  Pastoris duri est hic filius ills bubulet Juven Sat  XI  Columella  LIB cap  I own advises the master to give a reward and even liberty to a female slave that had rear'd him above three children A proof that sometimes the antients propagated from their slaves which indeed cannot be deny'd Were it otherwise the practice of slavery being so common in antiquity must have been destructive to a degree which no expedient cou'd repair All I pretend by these reasonings is that slavery is in general disadvantageous both to the happiness and populousness of mankind and that its place is much better supply'd by the practice of hir'd servants  THE laws or as some writers call them the seditions of the  Gracchi  were occasion'd by their observing the encrease of slaves all over  Italy  and the diminution of freecitizens  Appian  De bell civ  lib  ascribes this encrease to the propagation of the slaves  Plutarch  In vita Tib C Grach  to the purchase of barbarians who were chain'd and imprison'd  To the same purpose is that passage of the elder  Seneca ex controversia  lib  Arata quondam populis rura singulorum ergastulorum sunt latiusque nunc villici quam olim reges imperant At nunc eadem  says  Pliny vincti pedes damnatae manus inscripti vultus exercent  lib cap So also  Martial  Et sonet innumera compede Thuscus ager  lib ep  And  Lucan Tum longos jungere fines  Agrorum et quondam duro sulcata Camilli  Vomere et antiquas Curiorum

of  ergastula  and was cultivated by labourers in chains  Eunus  and  Athenio  excited the servile war by breaking up these monstrous prisons and giving liberty to slaves The younger  Pompey  augmented his army in  Spain  by the same expedient  Id  lib cap  If the country labourers throughout the  Roman  empire were so generally in this situation and if it was difficult or impossible to find separate lodgings for the families of the city servants how unfavourable to propagation  as well as humanity must the institution of domestic slavery be esteem'd  Constantinople  at present requires the same recruits of slaves from all the provinces which  Rome  did of old and these provinces are of consequence far from being populous  Aegypt  according to Mons  Maillet  sends continual colonies of black slaves to the other parts of the  Turkish  empire and receives annually an equal return of white The one brought from the inland parts of  Africa  the other from  Mingrelia Circassia  and  Tartary  OUR modern convents are no doubt very bad institutions But there is reason to suspect that antiently every great family in  Italy  and probably in other parts of the world was a species of convent And tho' we have reason to detest all these popish institutions as nurseries of the most abject superstition burthensome to the public and oppressive to the poor prisoners male as well as female yet may it be question'd whether they be so destructive to the populousness of a state as is commonly imagin'd Were the land which belongs to a convent bestow'd on a nobleman he wou'd spend its revenue on dogs horses grooms footmen cooks and chambermaids and his family wou'd not furnish many more citizens than the convent  THE common reason why parents thrust their daughters into nunneries is that they may not be overburthen'd with too numerous a family but the antients had a method almost as innocent and more effectual to that purpose  viz  the exposing their children in the earliest infancy This practice was very common and is not mention'd by any author of those times with the horror it deserves or scarce  Tacitus  blames it  De morib Germ  even with disapprobation  Plutarch  the humane good natur'd  Plutarch  De fraterno amore Seneca  also approves of the exposing of sickly infirm children  De ira  lib cap  recommends it as a virtue in  Attalus  king of  Pergamus  that he murder'd or if you will expos'd all his own children in order to leave his crown to the son of his brother  Eumenes  Signalizing in this manner his gratitude and affection to  Eumenes  who had left him his heir preferably to that son 'Twas  Solon  the most celebrated of the sages of  Greece  who gave parents permission by law to kill their children  Sext Emp  lib cap  SHALL we then allow these two circumstances to compensate each other  viz  monastic vows and the exposing of children and to be unfavourable in equal degrees to the propagation of mankind I doubt the advantage is here on the side of antiquity  Perhaps by an odd conexion of causes the barbarous practice of the antients might rather render those times more populous By removing the terrors of too numerous a family it wou'd engage many people in marriage and such is the force of natural affection that very few in comparison wou'd have resolution enough when it came to the push to carry into execution their former intentions  China  the only country where this barbarous practice of exposing children prevails at present is the most populous country we know and every man is married before he is twenty Such early marriages cou'd scarce be general had not men the prospect of so easy a method of getting rid of their children I own that  Plutarch  De amore prolis  speaks of it as a very universal maxim of the poor to expose their children and as the rich were then averse to marriage on account of the courtship they met with from those who expected legacies from them the public must have been in a bad situation betwixt them  THE practice of leaving great sums of money to friends tho' one had near relations was common to  Greece  as well as  Rome  as we may gather from  Lucian  This practice prevails very little in modern times and  Ben Johnson  's  volpone  is therefore almost entirely extracted from antient authors and suits better the manners of those times  OF all sciences there is none where first appearances are more deceitful than politics Hospitals for foundlings seem favourable to the encrease of numbers and perhaps may be so when kept under proper restrictions But when they open the door to every one without distinction they have probably a contrary effect and are pernicious to the state 'Tis computed that every ninth child born at  Paris  is sent to the hospital tho' it seems certain according to the common course of human affairs that 'tis not a hundredth part whose parents are altogether incapacitated to rear and educate them The infinite difference for health industry and morals betwixt an education in an hospital and that in a private family shou'd induce us not to make the entrance into an hospital too easy and engaging To kill one's own child is shocking to nature and must therefore be pretty unusual but to turn over the care of him upon others is very tempting to the natural indolence of mankind  HAVING consider'd the domestic life and manners of the antients compar'd to those of the moderns  It may justly be thought that the liberty of divorces in  Rome  was another discouragement to marriage Such a practice prevents not quarrels from  humour  or rather encreases them and occasions also those from  interest  which are much more dangerous and destructive See farther on this head Essays moral and political essay XXI Perhaps too the unnatural lusts of the antients ought to be taken into consideration as of some moment  where in the main we seem rather superior so far as the present question is concern'd we shall now examine the  political  customs and institutions of both ages and weigh their influence in retarding or forwarding the propagation of mankind  BEFORE the encrease of the  Roman  power or rather till its full establishment almost all the nations which are the scene of antient history were divided into small territories or petty commonwealths where of course a great equality of fortune prevail'd and the center of government was always very near its frontiers This was the situation of affairs not only in  Greece  and  Italy  but also in  Spain Gaul Germany Afric  and a great part of the lesser  Asia  And it must be own'd that no institution cou'd be more favourable to the propagation of mankind For tho' a man of an overgrown fortune not being able to consume more than another must share it with those who serve and attend him Yet their possession being precarious they have not the same encouragement to marriage as if each had a small fortune secure and independent Enormous cities are besides destructive to society beget vice and disorder of all kinds starve the remoter provinces and even starve themselves by the high prices to which they raise all provisions Where each man had his little house and field to himself and each county had its capital free and independent What a happy situation  of mankind How favourable to industry and agriculture to marriage and propagation The prolific virtue of men were it to act in its full extent without that restraint which poverty and necessity imposes on it wou'd double the numbers every generation And nothing surely can give it more liberty than such small commonwealths and such an equality of fortune amongst the citizens All small states naturally produce equality of fortune because they afford no opportunities of great encrease but small commonwealths much more by that division of power and authority which is essential to them  WHEN  Xenophon  De exp Cyr  lib  return'd after the famous expedition with  Cyrus  he hir'd himself and of the  Greeks  into the service of  Seuthes  a prince of  Thrace  and the articles of his agreement were that each soldier shou'd receive a  daric  a month each captain two  darics  and he himself as general four A regulation of pay which wou'd not a little surprize our modern officers  WHEN  Demosthenes  and  Aeschines  with eight more were sent ambassadors to  Philip  of  Macedon  their appointments for above four months were a thousand  drachmas  which is less than a  drachma  a day for each ambassador  Demost de falsa leg  He calls it a considerable sum  But a  drachma  a day  nay sometimes two  Thucyd  lib  was the pay of a common foot soldier  A CENTURION amongst the  Romans  had only double pay to a common soldier in  Polybius  's  LIB cap  time and we accordingly find their gratuities after a triumph regulated by that proportion  Tit Liv  lib cap  alibi passim  But  Mark Anthony  and the triumvirate gave the centurions five times the reward of the other  Appian de bell civ  lib  So much had the encrease of the commonwealth encreas'd the inequality amongst the citizens  Caesar  gave the centurions ten times the gratuity of the common soldiers  De bell Gallico  lib In the  Rhodian  cartel mention'd afterwards no distinction in the price of ransom was made on account of ranks in the army  IT must be own'd that the situation of affairs in modern times with regard to civil liberty as well as equality of fortune is not near so favourable either to the propagation or happiness of mankind  Europe  is shar'd out mostly into great monarchies and such parts of it as are divided into small territories are commonly govern'd by absolute princes who ruin their people by a ridiculous mimickry of the greater monarchs in the splendor of their court and number of their forces  Swisserland  alone and  Holland  resemble the antient republics and tho' the former is far from possessing any advantage either  of soil climate or commerce yet the numbers of people with which it abounds notwithstanding their enlisting themselves into every service in  Europe  prove sufficiently the advantages of their political institutions  THE antient republics deriv'd their chief or only security from the numbers of their citizens The  Trachinians  having lost great numbers of their people the remainder instead of enriching themselves by the inheritance of their fellow citizens apply'd to  Sparta  their metropolis for a new stock of inhabitants The  Spartans  immediately collected ten thousand men amongst whom the old citizens divided the lands of which the former proprietors had perish'd  Diod Sic  lib  Thucyd  lib  AFTER  Timoleon  had banish'd  Dionysius  from  Syracuse  and had settled the affairs of  Sicily  finding the cities of  Syracuse  and  Sellinuntium  extremely depopulated by tyranny war and faction he invited over from  Greece  some new inhabitants to repeople them  Diod Sic  lib  Immediately forty thousand men  Plutarch  In vita Timol  says sixty thousand offer'd themselves and he distributed so many lots of land amongst them to the great satisfaction of the antient inhabitants A proof at once of the maxims of antient policy which affected populousness more than riches  and of the good effects of these maxims in the extreme populousness of that small country  Greece  which cou'd at once supply so large a colony The case was not much different with the  Romans  in early times He is a pernicious citizen said  M Curius  who cannot be contented with seven acres  Plin  lib cap The same author in cap says  Verumque fatentibus latifundia perdidere Italiam Jam vero et provincias Sex domi femissem Africae possidebant cum interfecit cos Nero princeps  In this view the barbarous butchery committed by the first  Roman  emperors was not perhaps so destructive to the public as we may imagine These never ceas'd till they had extinguish'd all the illustrious families which had enjoy'd the plunder of the world during the latter ages of the republic The new nobles who rose in their place were less splendid as we learn from  Tacit Ann  lib cap  Such ideas of equality cou'd not fail to produce populousness  WE must now consider what disadvantages the antients lay under with regard to populousness and what checks they receiv'd from their political maxims and institutions There are commonly compensations in every human condition and tho' these compensations be not always perfectly equivalent yet they serve at least to restrain the prevailing principle To compare them and estimate their influence is indeed very difficult even where they take place in the same age and in neighbouring countries But where several ages have interven'd and only scatter'd lights are afforded us by antient authors what can we do but amuse ourselves  by talking  pro  and  con  on an interesting subject and thereby correcting all hasty and violent determinations  First  WE may observe that the antient republics were almost in perpetual war a natural effect of their martial spirit their love of liberty their mutual emulation and that hatred which generally prevails amongst nations that live in a close neighbourhood Now war in a small state is much more destructive than in a great one both because all the inhabitants in the former case must fill the armies and because the state is all frontier and all expos'd to the inroads of the enemy  THE maxims of antient war were much more destructive than those of modern chiefly by the distribution of plunder in which the soldiers were indulg'd Our common soldiers are such a low rascally set of people that we find any abundance beyond their simple pay breeds confusion and disorder and a total dissolution of discipline The very wretchedness and meanness of those who fill the modern armies render them less destructive to the countries which they invade One instance amongst many of the deceitfulness of first appearances in all political reasonings  THE antient soldiers being free citizens above the lowest rank were all marry'd Our modern soldiers are either forc'dto live unmarry'd or their marriages turn to small account towards the encrease of mankind A circumstance which ought perhaps to be taken into consideration as of some consequence in favour of the antients  ANTIENT battles were much more bloody by the very nature of the weapons employ'd in them The antients drew up their men or sometimes men deep which made a narrow front and 'twas not difficult to find a field in which both armies might be marshall'd and might engage with each other Even where any body of the troops was kept off by hedges hillocks woods or hollow ways the battle was not so soon decided betwixt the contending parties but that the others had time to overcome the difficulties that oppos'd them and take part in the engagement And as the whole armies were thus engag'd and each man closely buckl'd to his antagonist the battles were commonly very bloody and great slaughter made on both sides but especially on the vanquish'd The long thin lines requir'd by fire arms and the quick decision of the fray render our modern engagements but partial rencounters and enable the general who is foil'd in the beginning of the day to draw off the greatest part of his army sound and entire Cou'd  Folard  's project of the column take place which seems impracticable  WHAT is the advantage of the column after it has broke the enemy's line Only that it then takes them in the flank and dissipates whatever stands near it by a fire from all sides But till it has broke them does it not present a flank to the enemy and that expos'd to their musquetry and what is much worse to their cannon  it wou'd render modern battles as destructive as the antient  THE battles of antiquity both by their duration and their resemblance of single combats were wrought up to a degree of fury quite unknown to latter ages Nothing cou'd then engage the combatants to give quarter but the hopes of profit by making slaves of their prisoners In civil wars as we learn from  Tacitus  HIST lib cap  the battles were the most bloody because the prisoners were not slaves  WHAT a stout resistance must be made where the vanquish'd expected so hard a fate How inveterate the rage where the maxims of war were in every respect so bloody and severe  INSTANCES are very frequent in antient history of cities besieg'd whose inhabitants rather than open their gates murder'd their wives and children and rush'd themselves on a voluntary death sweeten'd perhaps with a little prospect of revenge upon the enemy  Greeks  As  Abydus  mention'd by  Livy  lib cap and  Polyb  lib As also the  Xanthians Appian de bell civil  lib  as well as  Barbarians  have been often wrought up to this degree of fury And the same determinate spirit and cruelty must in many other instances less remarkable have been  extremely destructive to human society in those petty commonwealths that liv'd in a close neighbourhood and were engag'd in perpetual wars and contentions  SOMETIMES the wars in  Greece  says  Plutarch  In vita Arati  were carried on entirely by inroads and robberies and pyracies Such a method of war must be more destructive in small states than the bloodiest battles and sieges  BY the laws of the tables possession for two years form'd a prescription for land one year for movables  INST lib cap 'Tis true the same law seems to have been continu'd till the time of  Justinian  But abuses introduc'd by barbarism are not always corrected by civility  An indication that there was not in  Italy  during that period much more order tranquillity and settled police than there is at present amongst the  Tartars  THE only cartel I remember in antient history is that betwixt  Demetrius Poliorcetes  and the  Rhodians  when it was agreed that a free citizen shou'd be restor'd for  drachamas  a slave bearing arms for  Diod Sicul  lib  BUT  secondly  it appears that antient manners were more unfavourable than the modern not only in time of war but also in time of peace and that too in every respect except the love of civil liberty  and equality which is I own of considerable importance To exclude faction from a free government is very difficult if not altogether impracticable but such inveterate rage betwixt the factions and such bloody maxims are found in modern times amongst religious parties alone where bigotted priests are the accusers judges and executioners In antient history we may always observe where one party prevail'd whether the nobles or people for I can observe no difference in this respect  Lysias  who was himself of the popular faction and very narrowly escap'd from the  Tyrants  says that the Democracy was as violent a government as the Oligarchy  Orat  de statu popul  that they immediately butcher'd all of the opposite party they laid their hands on and banish'd such as had been so fortunate as to escape their fury No form of process no law no trial no pardon A fourth a third perhaps near a half of the city were slaughter'd or expell'd every revolution and the exiles always join'd foreign enemies and did all the mischief possible to their fellow citizens till fortune put it in their power to take full revenge by a new revolution And as these were very frequent in such violent governments the disorder diffidence jealousy enmity which must prevail are not easy for us to imagine in this age of the world  THERE are only two revolutions I can recollect in all antient history which past without great severity and great effusion of blood in massacres and  assassinations  viz  the restoration of the  Athenian  democracy by  Thrasybulus  and the subduing the  Roman  republic by  Caesar  We learn from antient history that  Thrasybulus  past a general amnesty for all past offences and first introduc'd that word as well as practice into  Greece  Cicero Philip    It appears however from many orations of  Lysias  As orat  contra Eratost  orat  contra Agorat  orat  pro Mantith  that the chief and even some of the subaltern offenders in the preceeding tyranny were try'd and capitally punish'd This is a difficulty not clear'd up and even not observ'd by antiquarians and historians And as to  Caesar's  clemency tho' much celebrated it wou'd not gain great applause in the present age He butcher'd for instance all  Cato  's senate when he became master of  Utica  Appian de bell civ  lib  and these we may readily believe were not the most worthless of the party All those who had born arms against that usurper were forfeited and by  Hirtius  's law declar'd incapable of all public offices  THESE people were extremely fond of liberty but seem not to have understood it very well When the thirty tyrants first establish'd their dominion at  Athens  they began with seizing all the sycophants and informers that had been so troublesome during the democracy and putting them to death by an arbitrary sentence and execution  Every  man  says  Sallust  SEE  Caesar  's speech  de bell Catil  and  Lysias  ORAT And in orat he mentions the faction only as the cause why these illegal punishments shou'd displease  was rejoiced at these punishments  not considering that liberty was from that moment annihilated  THE utmost energy of  Thucydides  's nervous stile and the great copiousness and expression of the  Greek  language seem to sink under that historian when he attempts to describe the disorders that arose from faction throughout all the  Greek  commonwealths You wou'd imagine that he still labours with a thought greater than he can find words to communicate And he concludes his pathetic description with an observation which is at once very refin'd and very solid  In these contests says he those who were dullest and most stupid and had the least foresight commonly prevail'd For being conscious of this weakness and dreading to be overreach'd by those of greater penetration they went to work hastily without premeditation by the sword and poniard and thereby prevented their antagonists who were forming fine schemes and projects for their destruction  LIB The country in  Europe  wherein I have observ'd the factions to be most violent and party hatred the strongest is  Ireland  This goes so far as to cut off even the most common intercourse of civilities betwixt the protestants and catholics Their cruel insurrections and the severe revenges which they have taken of each other are the causes of this mutual illwill which is the chief source of disorder poverty and depopulation in that country The  Greek  factions I imagine to have been inflam'd still to a higher degree of rage The revolutions being commonly more frequent and the maxims of assassination much more avow'd and acknowledg'd  NOT to mention  Dionysius  Plut de virt et fort Alex  the elder who is computed to have butcher'd in cold blood above of his fellow citizens nor  Agathocles  Diod Sic  lib  Nabis  Tit Liv  lib  and others still more bloody than he the transactions even in free governments were extremely violent and destructive At  Athens  the thirty tyrants and the nobles in a twelvemonth murder'd without trial about of the people and banish'd above the half of the citizens that remain'd  Diod Sic  lib  Isocrates  says there were only banish'd He makes the number of those kill'd amount to  Arcop Aeschines contra Ctesi  assigns precisely the same number  Seneca de tranq anim  cap says  In  Argos  near the same time the people kill'd of the nobles and afterwards their own demagogues because they had refus'd to carry their prosecutions farther  Diod Sic  lib  The people also in  Corcyra  kill'd of the nobles and banish'd a thousand  Diod Sic  lib  These numbers will appear the more surprizing if we consider the extreme smallness of  these states But all antient history is full of such instances  WE shall mention from  Diod Siculus  alone a few which past in the course of sixty years during the most shining age of  Greece  There were banish'd from  Sybaris  of the nobles and their partizans lib p  ex edit Rhodomanni  Of  Chians  citizens

antient  Greece  And what domestic confusion jealousy partiality revenge heartburnings must tear those cities where factions were wrought up to such a degree of fury and despair  'TWOU'D be easier says  Isocrates  to  Philip  to raise an army in  Greece  at present from the vagabonds than from the cities  EVEN where affairs came not to such extremities which they fail'd not to do almost in every city twice or thrice every century property was render'd very precarious by the maxims of antient government  Xenophon  in the banquet of  Socrates  gives us a very natural unaffected description of the tyranny of the  Athenian  people  In my poverty says  Charmides  I am much more happy than ever I was during my riches as much as it is happier to be in security than in terrors free than a slave to receive than to pay court to be trusted than suspected Formerly I was oblig'd to caress every informer Some imposition was continually laid upon me and it was never allow'd me to travel or be absent  from the city At present when I am poor I look big and threaten others The rich are afraid of me and show me every kind of civility and respect and I am become a kind of tyrant in the city  PAGE  exedit Le  n  l  IN one of the pleadings of  Lysias  ORAT  in Nicom  the orator very coolly speaks of it by the bye as a maxim of the  Athenian  people that whenever they wanted money they put to death some of the rich citizens as well as strangers for the sake of the forfeiture In mentioning this he seems to have no intention of blaming them still less of provoking them who were his audience and judges  WHETHER a man was a citizen or a stranger amongst that people it seems indeed requisite either that he shou'd impoverish himself or the people wou'd impoverish him and perhaps kill him into the bargain The orator last mention'd gives a pleasant account of an estate laid out in the public service  IN order to recommend his client to the favour of the people he enumerates all the sams he had expended When  minas Upon a chorus of men minas  minas  minas  minas Seven times trierarch where he spent talents Taxes once minas another time  minas  minas  minas  minas  minas  minas In the whole talents minas An immense sum for an  Athenian  fortune and what alone wou'd be esteem'd great riches Orat 'Tis true he says the law did not oblige absolutely to be at so much expence not above a fourth But without the favour of the people no body was so much as safe and this was the only way to gain it See farther orat  de pop statu  In another place he introduces a speaker who says that he had spent his whole fortune and an immense one eighty talents for the people Orat  de prob Evandri  The  or strangers find says he if they do not contribute largely enough to the people's fancy that they have reason to repent Orat  contra Phil  You may see with what care  Demosthenes  displays his expences of this nature when he pleads for himself  de corona  And how he exaggerates  Midias  stinginess in this particular in his accusation of that criminal All this by the bye is a mark of a very iniquitous judicature And yet the  Athenians  valu'd themselves on having the most legal and regular administration of any people in  Greece  that is above the third of it in rareeshows and figur'd dances  INEED not insist on the  Greek  tyrannies which were altogether horrible Even the mixt monarchies by which most of the antient states of  Greece  were govern'd before the introduction of republics were very unsettled Scarce any city but  Athens  says  Isocrates  could show a succession of kings for four or five generations  Panath    BESIDES many other obvious reasons for the instability of antient monarchies the equal division of property amongst the brothers in private families  by a necessary consequence must contribute to unsettle and disturb the state The universal preference given to the elder in modern governments tho' it increases the inequality of fortunes has however this good effect that it accustoms men to the same idea of public succession and cuts off all claim and pretension of the younger  THE new settled colony of  Heraclea  falling immediately into factions apply'd to  Sparta  who sent  Heripidas  with full authority to quiet their dissensions This man not provok'd by any opposition not inflam'd by party rage knew no better expedient than immediately putting to death about of the citizens  Diod Sic  lib  A strong proof how deeply rooted these violent maxims of government were throughout all  Greece  IF such was the disposition of mens minds amongst that refin'd people what may be expected in the commonwealths of  Italy Afric Spain  and  Gaul  which were denominated barbarous Why otherways did the  Greeks  so much value themselves on their humanity gentleness and moderation above all other nations This reasoning seems very natural But unluckily the history of the  Roman  commonwealth in its earlier times if we give credit to the receiv'd accounts stands against us No blood was ever shed in any sedition at  Rome  'till the murder of the  Gracchi Dionysius Halicarnassoeus  LIB  observing the singular humanity of the  Roman  people in this respect makes use of it as an argument that they were originally of  Grecian  extraction Whence we may conclude that the factions and revolutions in the barbarous republics were more violent than even those of  Greece  above mention'd  IF the  Romans  were so late in coming to blows they made ample compensation after they had once enter'd upon the bloody scene and  Appian  's history of their civil wars contains the most frightful picture of massacres proscriptions and forfeitures that ever was presented to the world What pleases most in that historian is that he seems to feel a proper resentment of these barbarous proceedings and talks not with that provoking coolness and indifference which custom had produc'd in many of the  Greek  historians  THE authorities cited above are all historians orators and philosophers whose testimony is unquestioned 'Tis dangerous to rely upon writers who deal in ridicule and satire What will posterity for instance infer from this passage of Dr  Swift  I told him that in the kingdom of  Tribnia Britain  by the Natives call'd  Langdon London  where I had sojourned some time in my travels the bulk of the people consist in a manner wholly of discoverers witnesses informers accusers prosecutors evidences swearers together with their several subservient and subaltern instruments all under the colours the conduct and pay of ministers of state and their deputies The plots in that kingdom are usually the workmanship of those persons  c  Gulliver's travels  Such a representation might suit the government of  Athens  but not that of  England  which is a prodigy even in modern times for humanity justice and liberty Yet the doctor's satire tho' carry'd to extremes as is usual with him even beyond other satirical writers did not altogether want an object The bishop of  Rochester  who was his friend and of the same party had been banish'd a little before by a bill of attainder with great justice but without such a proof as was legal or according to the strict forms of common law  THE maxims of antient politics contain in general so little humanity and moderation that it seems superfluous to give any particular reason for the violences committed at any particular period Yet I cannot forbear observing that the laws in the latter ages of the  Roman  commonwealth were so absurdly contriv'd that they oblig'd the heads of parties to have recourse to these extremities All capital punishments were abolish'd However criminal or what is more however dangerous any citizen might be he cou'd not regularly be punish'd otherways than by banishment And it became necessary in the revolutions of party to draw the sword of private vengeance nor was it easy when laws were once violated to set bounds to these sanguinary proceedings Had  Brutus  himself prevail'd over the  triumvirate  cou'd he in common prudence have allow'd  Octavius  and  Anthony  to live and have contented himself with banishing them to  Rhodes  or  Marseilles  where they might still have plotted new commotions and rebellions His executing  C Antonius  brother to the  triumvir  shows evidently his sense of the matter Did not  Cicero  with the approbation of all the wise and virtuous of  Rome  arbitrarily put to death  Catiline  's associates contrary to law and without any trial or form of process And if he moderated his executions did it not proceed either from the clemency of his temper or the conjunctures of the times A wretched security in a government which pretends to laws and liberty  THUS one extreme produces another In the same manner as excessive severity in the laws is apt to beget great relaxation in their execution so their excessive lenity naturally engenders cruelty and barbarity 'Tis dangerous to force us in any case to use freedom with their sacred regulations and prescriptions  ONE general cause of the disorders so frequent in all antient governments seems to have consisted in the great difficulty of establishing any aristocracy in those ages and the perpetual discontents and seditions of the people whenever even the meanest and most beggarly were excluded from the legislature and from public offices The very quality  of  freeman  gave such a rank being oppos'd to that of  slave  that it seem'd to intitle the possessor to every power and privilege of the commonwealth  Salon  's  Plutarch in vita Salon  laws excluded no freeman from votes or elections but confin'd some magistracies to a particular  census  yet were the people never satisfy'd 'till those laws were repeal'd By the treaty with  Antipater  Diod Sic  lib  no  Athenian  had a vote whose  census  was less than  drachmas  about  l Sterl  And tho' such a government wou'd to us appear sufficiently democratical it was so disagreeable to that people that above two thirds immediately deserted their country  Id ibid  Cassander  reduc'd that  census  to the half  Id ibid  yet still the government was consider'd as an oligarchical tyranny and the effect of foreign violence  Servius Tullius  's  Tit Liv  lib cap  laws seem very equal and reasonable by fixing the power in proportion to the property Yet the  Roman  people cou'd never be brought quietly to submit to them  IN those days there was no medium betwixt a severe jealous aristocracy over discontented subjects and a turbulent factious tyrannical democracy  BUT  thirdly  there are many other circumstances in which antient nations seem inferior to the modern both for the happiness and encrease of mankind Trade manufactures industry were no where in former ages so flourishing as they are at present in  Europe  The only garb of the antients both for males and females seems to have been a kind of flannel which they wore commonly white or grey and which they scour'd as often as it grew dirty  Tyre  which carry'd on after  Carthage  the greatest commerce of any city in the  Mediterranean  before it was destroyed by  Alexander  was no mighty city if we credit  Arrian  's account of its inhabitants  LIB There were kill'd during the siege and the whole captives amounted to  Diodorus Siculus  lib says only But he accounts for this small number by saying that the  Tyrians  had sent away beforehand part of their wives and children to  Carthage    Athens  is commonly suppos'd to have been a trading city but it was as populous before the  Median  war as at any time after it according to  Herodotus  LIB he makes the number of the citizens amount to  and yet its commerce at that time was so inconsiderable that as the same historian observes  ib  even the neighbouring coasts of  Asia  were as little frequented by the  Greeks  as the pillars of  Hercules  For beyond these he conceiv'd nothing  GREAT interest of money and great profits of trade are an infallible indication that industry and  commerce are but in their infancy We read in  Lysias  Orat    advers Diagit  of  per cent  profit made on a cargo of two talents sent to no greater distance than from  Athens  to the  Adriatic  Nor is this mention'd as an instance of exorbitant profit  Antidorus  says  Demosthenes  Contra Aphob  p  ex edit Aldi  pay'd three talents and a half for a house which he let at a talent a year And the orator blames his own tutors for not employing his money to like advantage My fortune says he in eleven years minority ought to have been tripled The value of of the slaves left by his father he computes at minas and the yearly profit of their labour at twelve  Id  ibid  p  The most moderate interest at  Athens  for there was higher  Id  ibid  often pay'd was  per cent  Id  ibid  and  Aeschines  contra  Ciesiph  and that pay'd monthly Not to insist upon the exorbitant interest of  per cent  to which the vast sums distributed in elections had rais'd money  Epist ad Attic  lib epist  at  Rome  we find that  Verres  before that factious period stated  per cent  for money which he left in the publicans hands And tho'  Cicero  exclaims against this article it is not on account of the extravagant usury but because it had never been customary to state any interest on such occasions  Contra Verr orat    Interest indeed sunk at  Rome  after the settlement of the  empire But it never remain'd any considerable time so low as in the commercial states of modern ages  SEE discourse IV    AMONGST the other inconveniencies which the  Athenians  felt from the fortifying  Decelia  by the  Lacedemonians  it is represented by  Thucydides  LIB  as one of the most considerable that they cou'd not bring over their corn from  Euboea  by land passing by  Oropus  but were oblig'd to embark it and to sail about the promontory of  Sunium  A surprising instance of the imperfection of antient navigation For the water carriage is not here above double the land  I DO not remember any passage in any antient author wherein the growth of any city is ascrib'd to the establishment of a manufacture The commerce which is said to flourish is chiefly the exchange of those commodities for which different soils and climates were suited The sale of wine and oil into  Africa  according to  Diodorus Siculus  LIB  was the foundation of the riches of  Agrigentum  The situation of the city of  Sybaris  according to the same author  LIB  was the cause of its immense populousness being built near the two rivers  Crathys  and  Sybaris  But these two rivers we may observe are not navigable and cou'd only produce some fertile vallies for agriculture and husbandry  an advantage so inconsiderable that a modern writer wou'd scarcely have taken notice of it  THE barbarity of the antient tyrants along with the extreme love of liberty which animated those ages must have banish'd every merchant and manufacturer and have quite depopulated the state had it subsisted upon industry and commerce While the cruel and suspicious  Dionysius  was carrying on his butcheries who that was not detain'd by his landed property and cou'd have carry'd along with him any art or skill to procure a subsistence in other countries wou'd have remain'd expos'd to such implacable barbarity The persecutions of  Philip  the II and  Lewis  the XIV fill'd all  Europe  with the manufacturers of  Flanders  and of  France  I GRANT that agriculture is the species of industry which is chiefly requisite to the subsistence of multitudes of people and it is possible that this industry may flourish even where manufactures and other arts are unknown or neglected  Swisserland  is at present a very remarkable instance where we find at once the most skilful husbandmen and the most bungling tradesmen that are to be met with in all  Europe  That agriculture flourish'd mightily in  Greece  and  Italy  at least in some parts of them and at some periods we have reason  to presume And whether the mechanical arts had reach'd the same degree of perfection may not be esteem'd so material especially if we consider the great equality in the antient republics where each family was oblig'd to cultivate with the greatest care and industry its own little field in order to its subsistence  BUT is it just reasoning because agriculture may in some instances flourish without trade or manufactures to conclude that in any great extent of country and for any great tract of time it wou'd subsist alone The most natural way surely of encouraging husbandry is first to excite other kinds of industry and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his commodities and a return of such goods as may contribute to his pleasure and enjoyment This method is infallible and universal and as it prevails more in modern governments than in the antient it affords a presumption of the superior populousness of the former  EVERY man says  Xenophon  Oecon  may be a farmer No art or skill is requisite All consists in the industry and attention to the execution A strong proof as  Columella  hints that agriculture was but little known in the age of  Xenophon  ALL our latter improvements and refinements have they operated nothing towards the easy subsistence  of men and consequently towards their propagation and encrease Our superior skill in mechanics the discovery of new worlds by which commerce has been so much enlarg'd the establishment of posts and the use of bills of exchange these seem all extremely useful to the encouragement of art industry and populousness Were we to strike off these what a check wou'd we give to every kind of business and labour and what multitudes of families wou'd immediately perish from want and hunger And it seems not probable that we cou'd supply the place of these new inventions by any other regulation or institution  HAVE we reason to think that the police of antient states was any way comparable to that of modern or that men had then equal security either at home or in their journeys by land or water I question not but every impartial examiner wou'd give us the preference in this particular  SEE essays moral and political essay XV  THUS upon comparing the whole it seems impossible to assign any just reason why the world shou'd have been more populous in antient than in modern times The equality of property amongst the antients liberty and the small divisions of their states were indeed favourable to the propagation of mankind But their wars were more bloody and destructive their governments  more factious and unsettl'd commerce and manufactures more feeble and languishing and the general police more loose and irregular These latter disadvantages seem to form a sufficient counterbalance to the former advantages and rather favour the opposite opinion to that which commonly prevails with regard to this subject  BUT there is no reasoning it may be said against matter of fact If it appear that the world was then more populous than at present we may be assur'd that our conjectures are false and that we have overlook'd some material circumstance in the comparison This I readily own All our preceding reasonings I acknowledge to be mere trifling or at least small skirmishes and frivolous rencounters that decide nothing But unluckily the main combat where we compare facts cannot be render'd much more decisive The facts deliver'd by antient authors are either so uncertain or so imperfect as to afford us nothing decisive in this matter How indeed cou'd it be otherwise The very facts which we must oppose to them in computing the greatness of modern states are far from being either certain or compleat Many grounds of calculation proceeded on by celebrated writers are little better than those of the emperor  Heliogabalus  who form'd an estimate of the immense greatness of  Rome  from ten thousand  pound weight of cobwebs which had been found in that city  Aelii Lamprid in vita Heliog  cap  'TIS to be remark'd that all kinds of numbers are uncertain in antient manuscripts and have been subject to much greater corruptions than any other part of the text and that for a very obvious reason Any alteration in other places commonly affects the sense or grammar and is more readily perceiv'd by the reader and transcriber  FEW enumerations of inhabitants have been made of any tract of country by any antient author of good authority so as to afford us a large enough view for comparison  'TIS probable that there was formerly a good foundation for the numbers of citizens assigned to any free city because they enter'd for a share of the government and there were exact registers kept of them But as the number of slaves is seldom mention'd this leaves us in as great uncertainty as ever with regard to the populousness even of single cities  The first page of  Thucydides  is in my opinion the commencement of real history All preceding narrations are so intermixt with fable that philosophers  ought to abandon them in a great measure to the embellishment of poets and orators  IN general there is more candour and sincerity in antient historians but less exactness and care than in the moderns Our speculative factions especially those of religion throw such an illusion over our minds that men seem to regard impartiality to their adversaries and to heretics as a vice or weakness But the commonness of books by means of printing has oblig'd modern historians to be more careful in avoiding contradictions and incongruities  Diodorus Siculus  is a good writer but 'tis with pain I see his narration contradict in so many particulars the two most authentic pieces of all  Greek  history  viz Xenophon  's expedition and  Demosthenes'  orations  Plutarch  and  Appian  seem scarce ever to have read  Cicero  's epistles  WITH regard to remote times the numbers of people assign'd are often ridiculous and lose all credit and authority The free citizens of  Sybaris  able to bear arms and actually drawn out in battle were They encountred at  Siagra  with citizens of  Crotona  another  Greek  city contiguous to them and were defeated This is  Diodorus Siculus  's  LIB  account and is very seriously insisted on by that historian  Strabo  LIB  also mentions the same number of  Sybarites  Diodorus Siculus  LIB  enumerating the inhabitants of  Agrigentum  when it was destroy'd by the  Carthaginians  says that they amounted to citizens strangers besides slaves who in so opulent  a city as he represents it wou'd probably be at least as numerous We must remark that the women and the children are not included and that therefore upon the whole the city must contain near two millions of inhabitants  Diagenes Laertius in vita Empedoclis  says that  Agrigentum  contain'd only inhabitants  And what was the reason of so immense an encrease They were very industrious in cultivating the neighbouring fields not exceeding a small  English  county and they traded with their wine and oil to  Africa  which at that time had none of these commodities  Ptolemy  says  Theocritus  IDYLL  commands cities I suppose the singularity of the number was the reason of assigning it  Diodorus Siculus  LIB  gives three millions of inhabitants to  Aegypt  a very small number But then he makes the number of their cities amount to An evident contradiction  He says  ID  ibid  the people were formerly seven millions Thus remote times are always most envy'd and admir'd  THAT  Xerxes  's army was extremely numerous I can readily believe both from the great extent of his  empire and from the foolish practice of the Eastern nations of encumbering their camp with a superfluous multitude But will any reasonable man cite  Herodotus  's wonderful narrations as an authority There is something very rational I own in  Lysias  's  Orat funebris  argument upon this subject Had not  Xerxes  's army been incredibly numerous says he he had never made a bridge over the  Hellespont  It had been much easier to have transported his men over so short a passage with the numerous shipping he was master of  Polybius  LIB  says that the  Romans  betwixt the first and second  Punic  wars being threaten'd with an invasion from the  Gauls  muster'd all their own forces and those of their allies and found them amount to seven hundred thousand men able to bear arms A great number surely and which when join'd to the slaves is probably more than that extent of country affords at present  The country that supply'd this number was not above a third of  Italy viz  the pope's dominions  Tuscany  and a part of the kingdom of  Naples  The enumeration too seems to have been made with some exactness and  Polybius  gives us the detail of the particulars But might not the number be magnify'd in order to encourage the people  Diodorus Siculus  LIB  makes the same enumeration amount to near a million These variations are suspicious He plainly too supposes that  Italy  in his time was not so populous Another very suspicious circumstance For who can believe that the inhabitants of that country diminish'd from the time of the first  Punic  war to that of the  triumvirates  Julius Caesar  according to  Appian  Celtica  encounter'd four millions of  Gauls  kill'd one million and took another prisoner  Plutarch in vita Caes  makes the number that  Caesar  fought with amount only to millions  Julian in Caesarihus  to  Supposing the numbers of the enemy's army and of the kill'd cou'd be exactly assign'd which never is possible how cou'd it be known how often the same man return'd into the armies or how distinguish the new from the old levy'd soldiers No attention ought ever to be given to such loose exaggerated calculations especially where the author tells us not the mediums upon which the calculations were form'd  Paterculus  LIB cap  makes the number kill'd by  Caesar  amount only to A much more probable account and more easily reconcil'd to the history  of these wars given by that conqueror himself in his commentaries  ONE wou'd imagine that every circumstance of the life and actions of  Dionysius  the elder might be regarded as authentic and free from all fabulous exaggerations both because he liv'd at a time when letters flourish'd most in  Greece  and because his chief historian was  Philistus  a man allow'd to be of great genius and who was a courtier and minister of that prince But can we admit that he had a standing army of foot horse and a fleet of gallies  Diod Sic  lib  These we may observe were mercenary forces and subsisted upon their pay like our armies in  Europe  For the citizens were all disarm'd and when  Dion  afterwards invaded  Sicily  and call'd on his countrymen to vindicate their liberty he was oblig'd to bring arms along with him which he distributed among those who join'd him  Plutarch in vita Dionis  In a state where agriculture alone flourishes there may be many inhabitants and if these be all arm'd and disciplin'd a great force may be call'd out upon occasion But great numbers of mercenary troops can never be maintain'd without either trade and manufactures or very extensive dominions The United Provinces never were masters of such a force by sea and land as that which is said to belong to  Dionysius  yet they possess as large a territory perfectly  well cultivated and have infinitely more resources from their commerce and industry  Diodorus Siculus  allows that even in his time the army of  Dionysius  appear'd incredible that is as I interpret it it was entirely a fiction and the opinion arose from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers and perhaps from the vanity and policy of the tyrant himself  THE critical art may very justly be suspected of temerity when it pretends to correct or dispute the plain testimony of antient historians by any probable or analogical reasonings Yet the licence of authors upon all subjects particularly with regard to numbers is so great that we ought still to retain a kind of doubt or reserve whenever the facts advanc'd depart in the least from the common bounds of nature and experience I shall give an instance with regard to modern history Sir  William Temple  tells us in his memoirs that having a free conversation with  Charles  the II he took the opportunity of representing to that monarch the impossibility of introducing into this island the religion and government of  France  chiefly on account of the great force requisite to subdue the spirit and liberty of so brave a people  The  Romans  says he were forc'd to keep up legions for that purpose'' a great absurdity  Strabo  lib says that one legion would be sufficient with a few cavalry but the  Romans  commonly kept up somewhat a greater force in this island which they never took pains entirely to subdue  and  Cromwell  left an army of near eighty thousand men  Must not this last fact be regarded as unquestion'd by future critics when they find it asserted by a wise and learned minister of state contemporary to the fact and who addrest his discourse upon an ungrateful subject to a great monarch who was also contemporary and who himself broke those very forces about fourteen years before Yet by the most undoubted authority we may insist that  Cromwell  's army when he died did not amount to half the number here mention'd  'TIS a very usual fallacy to consider all the ages of antiquity as one period and to compute the numbers contain'd in the great cities mention'd by antient authors as if these cities had been all contemporary The  Greek  colonies flourish'd extremely in  Sicily  during the age of  Alexander  But in  Augustus  's time they were so decay'd that almost all the product of that fertile island was consum'd in  Italy  Strabo  lib  LET us now examine the numbers of inhabitants assign'd to particular cities in antiquity and omitting the numbers of  Nineveh Babylon  and the  Egyptian Thebes  let us confine ourselves to the  sphere of real history to the  Grecian  and  Roman  empires I must own the more I consider this subject the more am I inclin'd to scepticism with regard to the great populousness ascrib'd to antient times  Athens  is said by  Apolog Socr  Plato  to be a very great city and it was surely the greatest of all the  Greek  Argos  seems also to have been a great city For  Lysias  contents himself with saying that it did not exceed  Athens  Orat  cities excepting  Syracuse  which was nearly about the same size in  Thucydides  's  LIB see also  Plutarch in vita Niciae  time and afterwards encreas'd beyond it For  Cicero  Orat contra Verrem  lib cap  Strabo  lib says it was miles in compass But then we are to consider that it contain'd two harbours within it one of which was a very large one and might be regarded as a kind of bay  mentions it as the greatest of all the  Greek  cities in his time not comprehending I suppose either  Antioch  or  Alexandria  under that denomination  Athenaeus  LIB cap  says that by the enumeration of  Demetrius Phalereus  there were in  Athens  citizens strangers and slaves This number is very much insisted on by those whose opinion I call in question and is esteem'd a fundamental fact to their purpose But in my opinion there is no point of criticism more certain than that  Athenaeus  and  Ctesicles  whom he cites are here mistaken  and that the number of slaves is augmented by a whole cypher and ought not to be regarded as more than  First  WHEN the number of citizens is said to be by  Athenaeus  Demosthenes  assigns  contra Aristog  men of full age are only understood For  Herodotus  LIB  says that  Aristagoras  embassador from the  Ionians  found it harder to deceive one  Spartan  than  Athenians  meaning in a loose way the whole state suppos'd in one popular assembly excluding the women and children  Thucydides  LIB  says that making allowances for all the absentees in the fleet army garrisons and for people employ'd in their private affairs the  Athenian  assembly never rose to five thousand The forces enumerated by the same historian  LIB  Diodorus Siculus  's account perfectly agrees lib  being all citizens and amounting to heavy arm'd infantry prove the same method of calculation as also the whole tenor of the  Greek  historians who always understand men of full age when they assign the number of citizens in any republic Now these being but the fourth of the inhabitants the free  Athenians  were by this account the strangers and the slaves calculating by the smaller number and allowing that they marry'd and  propagated at the same rate with freemen were And the whole inhabitants A large enough number surely The other number makes  Athens  larger than  London  and  Paris  united  Secondly  THERE were but houses in  Athens  Xenopbon mem  lib  Thirdly  THO' the extent of the walls as given us by  Thucydides  be great  LIB  viz  miles beside the seacoast yet  Xenophon  De ratione red  says there was much waste ground within the walls They seem indeed to have join'd four distinct and separate cities  We are to observe that when  Dionysius Halycarnassaeus  says that if we regard the antient walls of  Rome  the extent of the city will not appear greater than that of  Athens  he must mean the  Acropolis  or high town only No antient author ever speaks of the  Piraeum Phalerus  and  Micnychia  as the same with  Athens  Much less can it be supposed that  Dionysius  wou'd consider the matter in that light after the walls of  Cimon  and  Pericles  were destroy'd and  Athens  was entirely separated from these other towns This observation destroys all  Vossius  's reasonings and introduces common sense into these calculations    Fourthly  NO insurrection of the slaves or suspicion of insurrection ever mention'd by historians except one commotion of the miners  Athen  lib  Fifthly  THE  Athenians  treatment of their slaves is said by  Xenophon  De rep Athen  and  Demosthenes  Philip    and  Plautus  Sticho  to have been extremely gentle and indulgent Which cou'd never have been the case had the disproportion been twenty to one The disproportion is not so great in any of our colonies and yet we are oblig'd to exercise a very rigorous military government over the Negroes  Sixthly  NO man is ever esteem'd rich for possessing what may be reckon'd an equal distribution of property in any country or even triple or quadruple that wealth Thus every person in  England  is computed by some to spend six pence a day Yet is he esteem'd but poor that has five times that sum Now  Timarchus  is said by  Aeschines  Contra Timarch  to have been left in easy circumstances but he was master only of slaves employ'd in manufactures  Lysias  and his brother two strangers were proscrib'd by the thirty for their great riches tho' they had but a piece  Orat    Demosthenes  was left very rich by his father yet he had no more than slaves  Contra Aphob  His workhouse of cabinet makers is said to be a very considerable manufactory  Ibid  Seventhly  DURING the  Decelian  war as the  Greek  historians call it slaves deserted and brought  brought the  Athenians  to great distress as we learn from  Thucydides  LIB  This could not have happen'd had they been only the twentieth part The best slaves wou'd not desert  Eighthly Xenophon  De rat red  proposes a scheme for entertaining by the public slaves And that so great a number may possibly be supported any one will be convinc'd says he who considers the numbers we had before the  Decelian  war A way of speaking altogether incompatible with the larger number of  Athenaeus  Ninthly  THE whole  census  of the state of  Athens  was less than talents And tho' numbers in antient manuscripts be often suspected by critics yet this is unexceptionable both because  Demosthenes  De classibus  who gives it gives also the detail which checks him and because  Polybius  LIB cap  assigns the same number and reasons upon it Now the most vulgar slave cou'd yield by his labour an  obolus  a day over and above his maintenance as we learn from  Xenophon  De rat red  who says that  Nicias  's overfeer paid his master so much for slaves whom he employ'd in digging of mines and also kept up the number of slaves If you will take the pains to estimate an  obolus  a day and the slaves at computing only at years purchase you will find the sum above talents even tho' allowance  be made for the great number of holydays in  Athens  Besides many of the slaves wou'd have a much greater value from their art The lowest that  Demosthenes  Contra Aphobum  estimates any of his father's slaves is two minas ahead And upon this supposition it is a little difficult I confess to reconcile even the number of slaves with the  census  of talents  Tenthly Chios  is said by  Thucydides  LIB  to contain more slaves than any  Greek  city except  Sparta Sparta  then had more than  Athens  in proportion to the number of citizens The  Spartans  were in the town in the country  Plutarch in vita Lycurg  The male slaves then of full age must have been more than The whole more than A number impossible to be maintain'd in a narrow barren country such as  Laconia  which had no trade Had the  Helotes  been so very numerous the murder of mention'd by  Thucydides  LIB  wou'd have irritated them without weakening them  BESIDES we are to consider that the number assign'd by  Athenaeus  THE same author affirms that  Corinth  had once slaves  Aegina  But the foregoing arguments hold strongagainst these facts 'Tis however remarkable that  Athenaeus  cites so great an authority as  Aristotle  for this last fact And the scholiast on  Pindar  mentions the same number of slaves in  Aegina  whatever it is comprehends all the inhabitants of  Attica  as well as those of  Athens  The  Athenians  affected much a couner  try life as we learn from  Thucydides  LIB  and when they were all chas'd into town by the invasion of their territory during the  Peloponnesian  war the city was not able to contain them and they were oblig'd to lye in the porticos temples and even streets for want of lodging  Id ibid  THE same remark is to be extended to all the other  Greek  cities and when the number of the citizens is assign'd we must always understand it of the inhabitants of the neighbouring country as well as of the city Yet even with this allowance it must be confest that  Greece  was a populous country and much exceeded what we cou'd imagine of so narrow a territory naturally not very fertile and which drew no supplies of corn from other places For excepting  Athens  which traded to  Pontus  for that commodity the other cities seem to have subsisted chiefly from their neighbouring territory  Demost contra Lept  The  Athenians  brought yearly from  Pontus  medimni or bushels of corn as appear'd from the customhouse books And at that time they imported little corn from any other place This by the bye is a strong proof that there is some great mistake in the foregoing passage of  Athenaeus  For  Attica  itself was so barren in corn that it produc'd not enough even to maintain the peasants  Tit Livii  lib cap  Lucian  in his  navigium sive vota  says that a ship which by the dimensions he gives seems to have been about the size of our third rates carry'd as much corn as wou'd maintain all  Attica  for a twelvemonth But perhaps  Athens  was decay'd at that time and besides it is not safe to trust such loose rhetorical calculations  Rhodes  is well known to have been a city of extensive commerce and of great fame and splendor yet it contain'd only citizens able to bear arms when it was besieg'd by  Demetrius  Diod Sic  lib  Thebes  was always one of the capital cities of  Greece  Isoc paneg  But the number of its citizens exceeded not those of  Rhodes  Diod Sic  lib and  Phliasia  is said to be a small city by  Xenophon  Hist Graec  lib  yet we find that it contain'd citizens  Id  lib  I pretend not to reconcile these two facts  Mantinaea  was equal to any city in  Arcadia  Polyb  lib  Consequently it was equal to  Megalopolis  which was stadia or miles and a quarter in circumference  Polyb  lib cap  But  Mantinaea  had only citizens  Lysias  orat  The  Greek  cities therefore contain'd often fields and gardens along with the houses and we cannot judge of them by the extent of their walls  Athens  contain'd no more than houses yet  its walls with the sea coast were above miles in extent  Syracuse  was miles in circumference yet was scarce ever spoke of by the antients as more populous than  Athens Babylon  was a square of miles or miles in circuit but it contain'd large cultivated fields and inclosures as we learn from  Pliny  Tho'  Aurelian's  wall was miles in circumference  Vopiscus in vita Aurel  the circuit of all the divisions of  Rome  taken apart according to  Publius Victor  was only about miles When an enemy invaded the country the whole inhabitants retir'd within the walls of the antient cities along with their cattle and furniture and instruments of husbandry And the great height to which the walls were rais'd enabled a small number to defend them with facility  Sparta  says  Xenophon  De rep Laced  This passage is not easily reconcil'd with that of  Plutarch  above who says that  Sparta  had citizens  is one of the cities of  Greece  that has the fewest inhabitants Yet  Polybius  Polyb  lib cap  says it was stadia in circumference and was round  ALL the  Aetolians  able to bear arms in  Antipater's  time were but ten thousand men  Diod Sic  lib  Polybius  Legat  tells us that the  Achaean  league might without any inconvenience march or  men and this account seems very probable For that league comprehended the greatest part of  Peloponnesus  Yet  Pausanias  In Achaicis  speaking of the same period says that all the  Achaeans  able to bear arms even when several manumitted slaves were join'd to them did not amount to fifteen thousand  THE  Thessalians  till their final conquest by the  Romans  were in all ages turbulent factious seditious disorderly  Tit Liv  lib cap  Plato in Critone  'Tis not therefore natural to suppose that that part of  Greece  abounded much in people  THE whole inhabitants of  Epirus  of all ages sexes and conditions who were sold by  Paulus Aemilius  amounted only to  Tit Liv  lib cap  Yet  Epirus  might be double the extent of  Yorkshire  A LATE  Trench  writer in his  observations on the Greeks  has remark'd that  Philip  of  Macedon  being declar'd captain general of the  Greeks  wou'd have been back'd by the force of of that nation in his intended expedition against  Persia  This number comprehends I suppose all the free citizens throughout all the cities but the authority on which that computation is founded has I own escap'd either my memory or reading and that writer tho' otherwise very ingenious has given into a bad practice of delivering a great deal of erudition without one citation But supposing that that enumeration cou'd be justify'd by good authority from antiquity we may establish the following computation The free  Greeks  of all ages and sexes were The slaves computing them by the number of  Athenian  slaves as above who seldom marry'd or had families were double the male citizens of full age  viz  And the whole inhabitants of antient  Greece  about one million three hundred and eighty thousand No mighty number nor much exceeding what may be found at present in  Scotland  a country of nearly the same extent and which is very indifferently peopled  WE may now consider the numbers of people in  Rome  and  Italy  and collect all the lights afforded us by scatter'd passages in antient authors We shall find upon the whole a great difficulty in fixing any opinion on that head and no reason to support those exaggerated calculations so much insisted on by modern writers  Dionysius Halycarnasseus  LIB  says that the antient walls of  Rome  were nearly of the same compass with those of  Athens  but that the suburbs ran out to a great extent and it was difficult to tell where the town ended or the country begun In some places of  Rome  it appears from the same author  LIB  from  Juvenal  SATYR l  and from other antient writers  Strabo  lib says that the emperor  Augustus  prohibited the raising houses higher than foot In another passage  lib  he speaks of the houses of  Rome  as remarkably high See also to the same purpose  Vitruvius  lib cap  Aristides  the sophist in his oration  says that  Rome  consisted of cities on the the top of cities and that if one were to spread it out and unfold it it wou'd cover the whole surface of  Italy  Where an author indulges himself in such extravagant declamations and gives so much into the hyperbolical stile one knows not how far he must be reduc'd But this reasoning seems natural If  Rome  was built in so scatter'd a manner as  Dionysius  says and ran so much into the country there must have been very few streets where the houses were rais'd so high 'Tis onlyf or want of ground that any body builds in that inconvenient manner  that the houses were high and families liv'd in separate  stories one above another But 'tis probable these were only the poorer citizens and only in some few streets If we may judge from the younger  Pliny  's  LIB epist lib epist 'Tis true  Pliny  there describes a countryhouse But since that was the idea the antients form'd of a magnificent and convenient building the great men wou'd certainly build the same way in town  In laxitatem ruris excurrunt  says  Seneca  of the rich and voluptuous Epist  Valerius Maximus  lib cap speaking of  Cincinnatus  's field of acres says  Anguste se habitare nunc putat cujus domus tantum patet quantum Cincinnati rura patuerant  To the same purpose see lib cap also lib cap  account of his house and from  Bartoli's  plans of antient buildings the men of quality had very spacious palaces and their buildings were like the  Chinese  houses at this day where each apartment is separate from the rest and rises no higher than a single story To which if we add that the  Roman  nobility much affected very extensive porticos and even woods  VITRUV lib cap  Tacit annal  lib cap  Sucton in vita Octav  cap  c  in town we may perhaps allow  Vossius  tho' there is no manner of reason for it to read the famous passage of the elder  Pliny  Moenia ejus Romae collegere ambitu imperatoribus censoribusque Vespasianis A U C    pass xiii MCC complexa montes septem ipsa dividitur in regiones quatuordecim compita earum    Ejusdem spatii mensura currente a milliario in capite Rom Fori statuto ad singulas portas quae sunt bodie numero    ita ut duodecim portae semel numerentur praetereanturque ex veteribus septem quae esse desierunt efficit passuum per directum    Ad extrema vero tectorum cum castris praetoriis ab eodem milliario per vicos omnium viarum mensura collegit paulo amplius septuaginta millia passuum Quo si quis altitudinem tectorum addat dignam profecto aestimationem concipiat fateaturque nullius urbis magnitudinem in toto orbe potuisse ei comparari Plin lib    cap    ALL the best manuscripts of  Pliny  read the passage as here cited and fix the compass of the walls of  Rome  to be miles The only question is what  Pliny  means by paces and how that number was form'd The manner in which I conceive it is this  Rome  was a semicircular area of miles circumference The  Forum  and consequently the  Milliarium  we know was situated on the Banks of the  Tyber  and near the center of the circle or upon the diameter of the semicircular area Tho' there were gates to  Rome  yet only twelve of them had streight streets leading from them to the  Milliarium Pliny  therefore having assign'd the circumference of  Rome  and knowing that that alone was not sufficient to give in a just notion of its surface uses this farther method He supposes all the streets leading from the  Milliarium  to the gates to be laid together into one streight line and supposes we run along that line so as to count each gate once In which case he says that the whole line is paces Or in other words that each street or radius of the semicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half and the whole length of  Rome  is miles and its breadth about half as much beside the scatter'd suburbs  Pere Hardouin  understands this passage in the same manner with regard to the laying together the several streets of  Rome  into one line in order to compose paces But then he supposes that streets led from the  Milliarium  to every gate and that no street exceeded paces in length But a semicircular area whose radius was only paces cou'd never have a circumference near miles the compass of  Rome  as assign'd by  Pliny  A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference There is an absurdity in supposing a city so built as to have streets running to its center from every gate in its circumference These streets must interfere as they approach This diminishes too much from the greatness of antient  Rome  and reduces that city below even  Bristol  or  Rotterdam  The sense which  Vossius  in his  observationes variae  puts on this passage of  Pliny  errs widely in the other extreme One manuscript of no authority instead of miles has assign'd miles for the compass of the walls of  Rome  And  Vossius  understands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference supposing that as the  Tyber  form'd the diameter there were no walls built on that side But this reading is allow'd contrary to almost all the manuscripts Why shou'd  Pliny  a concise writer repeat the compass of the walls of  Rome  in two successive sentences Why repeat it with so sensible a variation What is the meaning of  Pliny  's mentioning twice the  Milliarium  if a line was measur'd that had no dependence on the  Milliarium    Aurelian  's wall is said by  Vopiscus  to have been drawn  laxiore ambitu  and to have comprehended all the buildings and suburbs on the northside of the  Tyber  yet its compass was only miles and even here critics suspect some mistake or corruption in the text It is not probable that  Rome  wou'd diminish from  Augustus  to  Aurelian  It remain'd still the capital of the same empire and none of the civil wars in that long period except the tumults on the death of  Maximus  and  Balbinus  ever affected the city  Caracalla  is said by  Aurelius Victor  to have encreas'd  Rome  There are no remains of antient buildings which mark any such greatness of  Rome Vossius  's reply to this objection seems absurd that the rubbish wou'd sink or foot below ground It appears from  Spartian in vita Severi  that the five mile stone  in via Lavicana  was out of the city  Olympiodorus  and  Publius Victor  fix the number of houses in  Rome  to be betwixt forty and fifty thousand The very extravagance of the consequences drawn by this critic as well as  Lipsius  if they be necessary destroys the foundation on which they are grounded That  Rome  contain'd millions of inhabitants while the whole kingdom of  France  contains only five according to his computation  c  THE only objection to the sense which we have affix'd above to the passage of  Pliny  seems to lye in this that  Pliny  after mentioning the gates of  Rome  assigns only a reason for suppressing the seven old ones and says nothing of the gates the streets leading from which terminated according to my opinion before they reach'd the Forum But as  Pliny  was writing to the  Romans  who perfectly knew the disposition of the streets it is not strange he shou'd take a circumstance for granted which was so familiar to every body Perhaps too many of these gates led to wharfs upon the river  his own way without admitting  own way without admitting the extravagant consequences he draws from it  THE number of citizens who receiv'd corn by the public distribution in  Augustus  's time  Ex monument Ancyr  were This one wou'd esteem a pretty certain ground of calculation Yet is it attended with such circumstances as throw us back into doubt and uncertainty  Did the poorer citizens only receive the distribution It was calculated to be sure chiefly for their benefit But it appears from a passage of  Cicero  Tusc quaest  lib cap  that the rich might also take their portion and that it was esteem'd no reproach in them to apply for it  TO whom was the corn given whether only to heads of families or to every man woman and child The portion every month was five  modii  to each  Licinius apud Sallust hist frag  lib  about ⅚ of a bushel This was too little for a family and too much for an individual  A very accurate antiquarian  Nicolaus Hortensius de re frumentaria Roman  therefore infers that it was given to every man of full years But he allows the matter to be uncertain  WAS it strictly enquir'd whether the claimant liv'd within the precincts of  Rome  or was it sufficient that he presented himself at the monthly distribution This last seems more probable  Not to take the people too much from their business  Augustus  ordain'd the distribution of corn to be made only thrice a year But the people finding the monthly distributions more convenient as preserving I suppose a more regular oeconomy in their family desir'd to have them restor'd  Sucton August  cap Had not some of the people come from some distance for their corn  Augustus  's precaution seems superfluous  WERE there no false claimants We are told  Sueton in Jul  cap  that  Caesar  struck off at once who had crept in without a just title and it is very little probable that he remedy'd all abuses  BUT lastly what proportion of slaves must we assign to these citizens This is the most material question and the most uncertain 'Tis very doubtful whether  Athens  can be establish'd as a rule for  Rome  Perhaps the  Athenians  had more slaves because they employ'd them in manufactures for which a capital city like  Rome  seems not so proper Perhaps on the other hand the  Romans  had more slaves on account of their superior luxury and riches  THERE were exact bills of mortality kept in  Rome  but no antient author has given us the  number of burials except  Suetonius  In vita Neronis  who tells us that in one season there were names carry'd to the temple of  Libitina  But this was during a plague which can afford no certain foundation for any inference  THE public corn tho' distributed only to citizens affected very considerably the whole agriculture of  Italy  LIB cap  A fact no way reconcileable to some modern exaggerations with regard to the inhabitants of that country  THE best ground of conjecture I can find concerning the greatness of antient  Rome  is this We are told by  Herodian  Sueton Aug  cap  that  Antioch  and  Alexandria  were very little inferior to  Rome  It appears from  Diodorus Siculus  LIB  that one straight street of  Alexandria  reaching from port to port was five miles long and as  Alexandria  was much more extended in length than breadth it seems to have been a city nearly of the bulk of  Paris  Quintus Curtius  says its walls were only ten miles in circumference when founded by  Alexander  lib cap  Strabo  who had travel'd to  Alexandria  as well as  Diodorus Siculus  says it was scarce four miles long and in most places about a mile broad lib  Pliny  says it resembled a  Macedonian  cassock stretching out in the corners lib cap Notwithstanding this bulk of  Alexandria  which seems but moderate  Diodorus Siculus  speaking of its circuit as drawn by  Alexander  which it never exceeded as we learn from  Ammianus Marcellinus  lib cap says it was    extremely great ibid  The reason which he assigns for its surpassing all cities of the world for he excepts not  Rome  is that it contain'd free inhabitants He also mentions the revenues of the kings  viz  as another circumstance to the same purpose No such mighty sum in our eyes even tho' we make allowances for the different value of money What  Strabo  says of the neighbouring country means only that it was well peopled  Might not one affirm without any great hyperbole that the whole banks of the river from  Gravesend  to  Windsor  are one city This is more than  Strabo  says of the banks of the lake  Mareotis  and of the canal to  Canopus  'Tis a vulgar saying in  Italy  that the king of  Sardinia  has but one town in  Piedmont  For it is all a town  Agrippa  in  Josephus de bello Judaic  lib cap to make his audience comprehend the excessive greatness of  Alexandria  which he endeavours to magnify describes only the compass of the city as drawn by  Alexander  A clear proof that the bulk of the inhabitants were lodged there and that the neighbouring country was no more than what might be expected about all great towns very well cultivated and well peopled  and  Rome  might be about the size of  London  THERE liv'd in  Alexandria  in  Diodorus Siculus  's time  LIB  free people comprehending I suppose women and children  He says  not  which must have been understood of citizens alone and grown men  But what number of slaves Had we any just ground to fix these at an equal number with the free inhabitants it wou'd favour the foregoing calculation  THERE is a passage in  Herodian  which is a little surprising He says positively and plainly that the palace of the emperor was as large as all  the rest of the city  LIE cap I    Politian  interprets it  aedibus majoribus etiam reliqua urbe  This was  Nero  's golden house which is indeed represented by  Suetonius  He says in  Nerone  cap that a portico or piazza of it was feet long  tanta laxitas ut porticus triplices milliarias haberet  He cannot mean three miles For the whole extent of the house from the  Palatine  to the  Esquiline  was not near so great So when  Vopisc in Aureliano  mentions a portico in  Sallust  's gardens which he calls  porticus milliarensis  it must be understood of a thousand feet So also  Horace  Nulla decempedis  Metata privatis opacam  Porticus excipiebat Arcton  Lib ode  So also in lib satyre  Mille pedes in fronte trecentos cippus in agrum Hic dabat  and  Pliny  LIE cap  Bis vidimus urbem totam cingi domibus principum Caii ac Neronis  as of an enormous extent but no power of imagination can make us conceive it to bear any proportion to such a city as  London  WE may observe had the historian been relating  Nero  's extravagance and had he made use of such an expression it would have had much less weight these rhetorical exaggerations being so apt to creep into an author's stile even when the most chaste and correct But 'tis mention'd by  Herodian  only by the bye in relating the quarrels betwixt  Geta  and  Caracalla  IT appears from the same historian  LIB cap  that there was then much land uncultivated and put to no  manner of use and he ascribes it as a great praise to  Pertinax  that he allow'd every one to take such land either in  Italy  or elsewhere and cultivate it as he pleas'd without paying any taxes  Lands uncultivated and put to no manner of use  This is not heard of in any part of Christendom except perhaps in some remote parts of  Hungary  as I have been inform'd And it surely corresponds very ill with that idea of the extreme populousness of antiquity so much insisted on  We learn from  Vopiscus  In Aurelian  cap  that there was in  Etruria  much fertile land uncultivated which the emperor  Aurelian  intended to convert into vineyards in order to furnish the  Roman  people with a gratuitous distribution of wine A very proper expedient to dispeople still farther that capital and all the neighbouring territories  IT may not be amiss to take notice of the account which  Polybius  LIB cap  gives of the great herds of swine to be met with in  Tuscany  and  Lombardy  as well as in  Greece  and of the method of feeding them which was then practis'd  There are great herds of swine says he throughout all  Italy  particularly in former times thro'  Etruria  and  Cisalpine Gaul  And a herd frequently contains a thousand or more swine When one of  these herds in feeding meets with another they mix together and the swineherds have no other expedients to separate them than to go to different quarters where they sound their horn and these animals being accustom'd to that signal run immediately each to the horn of his own keeper Whereas in  Greece  if the herds of swine happen to mix in the forests he who has the greatest flock takes cunningly the opportunity of driving all away And thieves are very apt to purloin the straggling hogs which have wander'd to a great distance from their keeper in search of food  MAY we not infer from this account that the North of  Italy  was then much less peopled and worse cultivated than at present How cou'd these vast herds be fed in a country so thick of enclosures so improv'd by agriculture so divided by farms so planted with vines and corn intermingled together I must confess that  Polybius  's relation has more the air of that oeconomy which is to be met with in our  American  colonies than the management of an  European  country  WE meet with a reflection in  Aristotle  's  LIE cap His expression is  not  inhabitant not citizen  ethics which seems to me unaccountable on any supposition and by proving too much in favour of  our present reasoning may be thought really to prove nothing That philosopher treating of friendship and observing that that relation ought neither to be contracted to a very few nor extended over a great multitude illustrates his opinion by the following argument  In like manner says he as a city cannot subsist if it either have so few inhabitants as ten or so many as a hundred thousand so is there a mediocrity requir'd in the number of friends and you destroy the essence of friendship by running into either extreme  What Impossible that a city can contain a hundred thousand inhabitants Had  Aristotle  never seen nor heard of a city that was near so populous This I must own passes my comprehension  Pliny  LIE cap  tells us that  Seleucia  the seat of the  Greek  empire in the East was reported to contain people  Carthage  is said by  Strabo  LIE  to have contain'd The inhabitants of  Pekin  are not much more numerous  London Paris  and  Constantinople  may admit of nearly the same computation at least the two latter cities do not exceed it  Rome Alexandria Antioch  we have already spoke of From the experience of past and present ages one might conjecture that there is a kind of impossibility in the nature of  things that any city cou'd ever rise much beyond this proportion Whether the grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on empire there seem to be invincible obstacles which prevent its farther progress The seats of vast monarchies by introducing extravagant luxury irregular expence idleness dependence and false ideas of rank and superiority are improper for commerce Extensive commerce checks itself by raising the price of all labour and commodities When a great court engages the attendance of a numerous nobility possest of overgrown fortunes the middling gentry remain in their provincial towns where they can make a figure on a moderate income And if the dominions of a state arrive at an enormous size there necessarily arise many capitals in the remoter provinces whither all the inhabitants except a few courtiers repair for education fortune and amusement  Such were  Alexandria Anticob Carthage Ephesus Lyons  c in the  Roman  empire Such are even  Bourdeaux Tholouse Dijon Rennes Rouen Aix  c in  France Dublin Edinburgh York  in the  British  dominions  London  by uniting extensive commerce and middling empire has perhaps arriv'd at a greatness which no city will ever be able to exceed  CHUSE  Dover  or  Calais  for a center Draw a circle of two hundred miles radius You comprehend  London Paris  the  Netherlands  the  United  Provinces  and some of the best cultivated counties of  France  and  England  It may safely I think be affirm'd that no spot of ground can be found in antiquity of equal extent which contain'd near so many great and populous cities and was so stockt with riches and inhabitants To balance in both periods the states which possest most art knowledge civility and the best police seems the truest method of comparison  'TIS an observation of  L'Abbe du Bos  VOL sect  that  Italy  is warmer at present than it was in antient times  The annals of  Rome  tell us says he that in the year  ab U C  the winter was so severe that it destroy'd the trees The  Tyber  froze in  Rome  and the ground was cover'd with snow for forty days When  Juvenal  SAT  describes a superstitious woman he represents her as breaking the ice of the  Tyber  that she may perform her ablutions  Hybernum fracta glacie descendet in amnem  Ter matutino Tyberi mergetur  He speaks of that river's freezing as a common event Many passages of  Horace  suppose the streets of  Rome  full of snow and ice We shou'd have more certainty with regard to this point had the antients known the use of thermometers But their writers without intending it  give us information sufficient to convince us that the winters are now much more temperate at  Rome  than formerly At present the  Tyber  no more freezes at  Rome  than the  Nile  at  Cairo  The  Romans  esteem the winter very rigorous if the snow lyes two days and if one sees for eight and forty hours a few small icicles hang from a fountain that has a North exposition  THE observation of this ingenious critic may be extended to other  European  climates Who cou'd discover the mild climate of  France  in  Diodorus Siculus  's  LIB  description of  Gaul  As it is a Northern climate says he it is infested with cold to an extreme degree In cloudy weather instead of rain there fall great snows and in clear weather it there freezes so excessive hard that the rivers acquire bridges of their own substance over which not only single travellers may pass but large armies accompany'd with all their baggage and loaded waggons And there being many rivers in  Gaul  the  Rhone  the  Rhine c  almost all of them are froze over and 'tis usual in order to prevent falling to cover the ice with chaff and straw at the places where the road passes  NORTH of the  Cevennes  says  Strabo  LIB  Gaul  produces not figs and olives And the vines that have been planted bear not grapes that will ripen  Ovid  positively maintains with all the serious affirmation of prose that the  Euxine  sea froze every winter in his time and he appeals to  Roman  governors whom he names for the truth of his assertion  Trist  lib eleg  De ponto  lib eleg  This never happens at present in the latitude of  Tomi  whither  Ovid  was banish'd All the complaints of the same poet seem to mark a rigour of the seasons which is scarce experienc'd at present in  Petersburg  or  Stockholm  Tournefort  a  Provencal  who had travel'd into the same countries observes that there is not a finer climate in the world And he asserts that nothing but  Ovid  's melancholy cou'd have given him such dismal ideas of it But the facts mention'd by that poet are too circumstantiate to bear any such interpretation  Polybius  LIB cap  says that the climate in  Arcadia  was very cold and the air moist  Italy  LIB cap  says  Varro  is the most temperate climate in  Europe  The inland parts  Gaul Germany  and  Pannonio  no doubt  have almost perpetual winter  THE Northern parts of  Spain  according to  Strabo  LIB  are but ill inhabited because of the great cold  ALLOWING therefore this remark to be just that  Europe  is become warmer than formerly how can we account for it Plainly by no other method but by supposing that the land is at present much better cultivated and that the woods are clear'd which formerly threw a shade upon the earth and kept the rays of the sun from penetrating to it Our Northern colonies in  America  become more temperate in proportion as the woods are fell'd  THE warm Southern also become more healthful And 'tis remarkable that in the  Spanish  histories of the first discovery and conquest of these countries they appear to have been very healthful being then well peopled and cultivated No account of the sickness or decay of  Cortes  's or  Pizzarro  's small armies  but in general every one may remark that cold still makes itself much more severely felt both in North and South  America  than in places under the same latitude in  Europe  Saserna  cited by  Columella  LIB cap  affirm'd that the disposition of the heavens was alter'd before his time nd that the air had become much milder and warmer as appears hence says he that many places now abound with vineyards and olive plantations which formerly by reason of the rigour of the climate cou'd raise none of these productions Such a change if real will be allow'd an evident sign of the better cultivation and peopling of countries  before the age of  Saserna  HE seems to have liv'd about the time of the younger  Africanus id ib  and if it be continu'd to the present times is a proof that these advantages have been continually encreasing throughout this part of the world  LET us now cast our eye over all the countries that were the scene of antient and modern history and compare their past and present situation We shall not perhaps find such foundation for the complaint of the present emptiness and desolation of the world  Aegypt  is represented by  Maillet  to whom we owe the best account of it as extremely populous tho' he esteems the number of its inhabitants to be diminish'd  Syria  and the lesser  Asia  as well as the coast of  Barbary  I can readily own to be very desart in comparison of their antient condition The depopulation of  Greece  is also very obvious but whether the country now call'd  Turky  in  Europe  may not in general contain as many inhabitants as during the flourishing period of  Greece  may be a little doubtful The  Thracians  seem then to have liv'd like the  Tartars  at present by pasturage and plunder  Xenoph exp  lib  Polyb  lib cap  The  Getes  were still more unciviliz'd  Ovid passim c Strabo  lib  And the  Illyrians  were no better  Polyb  lib cap  These occupy nine tenths of that country And tho' the police and government  of the  Turks  be not very favourable to industry and propagation yet it preserves at least peace and order amongst the inhabitants and is preferable to that barbarous unsettled condition in which they antiently liv'd  Poland  and  Muscovy  in  Europe  are not very populous but are certainly much more so than the antient  Sarmatia  and  Scythia  where no husbandry or agriculture was ever heard of and pasturage was the sole art by which the people were maintain'd The like observation may be extended to  Denmark  and  Sweden  No one ought to esteem the immense swarms of people that formerly came from the North and overran all  Europe  to be any objection to this opinion Where a whole nation or even half of it remove their seat 'tis easy to imagine what a prodigious multitude they must form with what desperate courage they must make their attacks and how the terror they strike into the invaded nations will make these magnify in their imagination both the courage and multitude of the invaders  Scotland  is neither extensive nor populous but were the half of its inhabitants to seek a new habitation they wou'd form a colony as large as the  Teutons  and  Cimbri  and wou'd shake all  Europe  supposing it in no better a condition for defence than formerly  Germany  has surely at present twenty times more inhabitants than in antient times when they cultivated  no ground and each tribe valu'd itself on the extensive desolation which it spread around as we learn from  Caesar  Debello Gallico  lib  and  Tacitus  De moribus Germ  and  Strabo  LIB  A proof that the division into small republics will not alone render a nation populous unless attended with the spirit of peace order and industry  THE barbarous condition of  Britain  in former times is well known and the thinness of its inhabitants may easily be conjectur'd both from their barbarity and from a circumstance mention'd by  Herodian  LIB cap  that all  Britain  was marshy even in  Severus  's time after the  Romans  had been fully settled in it above a whole century  'TIS not easily imagin'd that the  Gauls  were antiently much more advanc'd in the arts of life than their Northern neighbours since they travel'd to this island for their education in the mysteries of the religion and philosophy of the  Druids  Caesar de bello Gallico  lib  Strabo  lib says the  Gauls  were not much more improv'd than the  Germans  I cannot therefore think that  Gaul  was then near so populous as  France  is at present  WERE we to believe indeed and join together the testimony of  Appian  and that of  Diodorus Siculus  we must admit an incredible populousness in  Gaul  The former historian  Celt  pars  says that there  were nations in that country the latter affirms  LIB  that the largest of the  Gallic  nations consisted of men besides women and children and the least of Calculating therefore at a medium we must admit of near millions of people in a country which we esteem populous at present tho' suppos'd to contain little more than  ANTIENT  Gaul  was more extensive than modern  France  Such calculations therefore by their extravagance lose all manner of authority We may observe that that equality of property to which the populousness of antiquity may be ascrib'd had no place amongst the  Gauls  Caesar de bello Gallico  lib  Their intestine wars also before  Caesar  's time were almost perpetual  Id ibid  And  Strabo  LIB  observes that tho' all  Gaul  was cultivated yet it was not cultivated with any skill or care the genius of the inhabitants leading them less to arts than arms till their slavery to  Rome  produc'd peace among themselves  Caesar  De bello Gallico  lib  enumerates very particularly the great forces which were levy'd in  Belgium  to oppose his conquests and makes them amount to These were not the whole people able to bear arms in  Belgium  For the same historian tells us that the  Bellovaci  cou'd have brought a hundred thousand men into the field tho' they engag'd only for sixty Taking the whole therefore in this proportion  of ten to six the sum of fighting men in all the states of  Belgium  was above half a million the whole inhabitants two millions And  Belgium  being about the fourth of  Gaul  that country might contain eight millions which is not above the third of its present inhabitants  IT appears from  Caesar  's account that the  Gauls  had no domestic slaves The whole common people were indeed a kind of slaves to the nobility as the people of  Poland  are at this day And a nobleman of  Gaul  had sometimes ten thousand clients or dependants of this kind nor can we doubt that the armies were compos'd of the people as well as of the nobility An army of noblemen from a very small state is incredible The fighting men amongst the  Helvetii  were the fourth part of the whole inhabitants a clear proof that all the males of military age bore arms See  Caesar de bello Gall  lib  We may remark that the numbers in  Caesar  's commentaries can be more depended on than those of any other antient author because of the  Greek  translation which still remains and which checks the original  THE antient  Helvetia  was miles in length and in breadth according to  Caesar  De bello Gallico  lib  yet contain'd only inhabitants The canton of  Berne  alone has at present as many people  AFTER this computation of  Appian  and  Diodorus Siculus  I know not if I dare say that the modern  Dutch  are more numerous than the antient  Batavi  Spain  is decay'd from what it was three centuries ago but if we step backward two thousand  years and consider the restless turbulent unsettl'd condition of its inhabitants we may probably be inclin'd to think that it is now much more populous Many  Spaniards  kill'd themselves when depriv'd of their arms by the  Romans  Titi Livii  lib cap  It appears from  Plutarch  In vita Marii  that robbery and plunder were esteem'd honourable amongst the  Spaniards Hirtius  De bello Hisp  represents in the same light the situation of that country in  Caesar  's time and he says that every man was oblig'd to live in castles and wall'd towns for his security 'Twas not till their final conquest under  Augustus  that these disorders were represt  Vell Pater  lib sect  The account which  Strabo  LIB  and  Justin  LIB  give of  Spain  corresponds exactly with those above mention'd How much therefore must it diminish from our idea of the populousness of antiquity when we find that  Cicero  comparing  Italy Afric Gaul Greece  and  Spain  mentions the great number of inhabitants as the peculiar circumstance which render'd that latter country formidable  Nec numero Hispanos nec robore Galles nec calliditate Paenos nec artibus Graeces nec denique hoc ipso hujus gentis ac terrae domestico nativoque sensu Italos ipsos ac Latinessuperavimus De harusp resp  cap The disorders of  Spain  seem to have been almost proverbial  Nec impacatos a te  go horrebis Iberos Virg Georg  lib The  Iberi  are here plainly taken by a poetical figure for robbers in general  Italy  'tis probable however has decay'd But how many great cities does it still contain  Venice Genoa Pavia Turin Milan Naples Florence Leghorn  which either subsisted not in antient times or were then very inconsiderable If we reflect on this we shall not be apt to carry matters to so great an extreme as usual with regard to this subject  WHEN the  Roman  authors complain that  Italy  which formerly exported corn became dependent on all the provinces for its daily bread they never ascribe this alteration to the encrease of its inhabitants but to the neglect of tillage and agriculture  Varro de re rustica  lib praef  Columella  praef  Suston August  cap  A natural effect of that pernicious practice of importing corn in order to distribute it  gratis  among the  Roman  citizens and a very bad means of multiplying the inhabitants of any country  THO' the observation of  L'Abbé du Bos  shou'd be admitted that  Italy  is now warmer than in former times the consequence may not be necessary that it is more populous or better cultivated If the other countries of  Europe  were more savage and woody the cold winds that blow'd from them might affect the climate of  Italy  The  sportula  so much talk'd of by  Martial  and  Juvenal  being presents regularly made by the great lords to their smaller clients must have had a like tendency to produce idleness debauchery and a continual decay amongst the people  WERE I to assign a period when I imagine this part of the world might possibly contain more inhabitants than at present I shou'd pitch upon the age of  Trajan  and the  Antonines  the great extent of the  Roman  empire being then civiliz'd and cultivated settled almost in a profound peace both foreign and domestic and living under the same regular police and government  THE inhabitants of  Marseilles  lost not their great superiority ever the  Gauls  in commerce and the mechanic arts till the  Roman  dominion turn'd the latter from arms to agriculture and civil life See  Strabo  lib That author in several places repeats the observation concerning the improvement arising from the  Roman  arts and civility And he liv'd at the time when the change was new and wou'd be more sensible So also  Pliny Quis exim non communicato orbe terrarum majestate Romani imperii profecisse vitam putet commercio rerum ac societate festae pacis omniaque exam quae acculta antea fuerant in promiscuousu facta  lib proem  Numine

et humanitatem homini daret breviterque una cunctarum gentium in toto orbe patria fieret  lib cap Nothing can be stronger to this purpose than the following passage from  Tertullian  who liv'd about the age of  Severus Cer  e quidem ipse orbis in promptu est culticr de die et instructior pristino Omnia jam pervia omnia nota omnia negotiosa Solitudines famosas retro fandi amaenissimi obliteraverunt silvas arva domuerunt feras pecora fugaverant arenae seruntur saxa panguntur paludes cliquantur tantae urbes quantae non casae quendam Jam nec insulae horrent nec scopuli terrent ubique domus ubique populus ubique respublica ubique vita Summum testimonium frequentiae humanae onerosi sumus mundo vix nobis elementa sufficiunt et necessitates arctiores et querelae apud omnes dum jane nos natura non sustinet De anima  cap The air of rhetoric and declamation which appears in this passage diminishes somewhat from its authority but does not entirely destory it A man of violent imagination such as  Tertullian  augments every thing equally and for that reason his comparative judgments are the most to be depended on The same remark may be extended to the following passage of  Aristides  the sophist who liv'd in the age of  Adrian The whole world  says he addressing himself to the  Romans seems to keep one holiday and mankind laying aside the swords they formerly wore now betake themselves to feasting and to joy The cities forgetting their antient contentions preserve only one emulation which shall embellish itself most by every art and ornament Theatres every where arise amphitheatres porticos aqueducts temples schools academies and one may safely pronounce that the sinking world has been again rais'd by your auspicious empire Nor have cities alone receiv'd an encrease of ornament and beauty but the whole earth like a garden or paradise is cultivated and adorn'd Insomuch that such of mankind as are plac'd out of the limits of your empire who are but few seem to merit our simpathy and compassion  Tis remarkable that tho'  Diodorus Siculus  makes the whole inhabitants of  Aegypt  when conquer'd by the  Romans  amount only to three millions yet  Josephus de bello Jud  lib cap says that its inhabitants excluding those of  Alexandria  were seven millions and a half in the reign of  Nero  And he expressly says that he drew this account from the books of the  Roman  publicans who levy'd the poll tax  Strabo  lib praises the superior police of the  Romans  with regard to the finances of  Aegypt  above that of its former monarchs And no part of administration is more essential to the happiness of a people Yet we read in  Athenaeus  lib cap who flourish'd during the reign of the  Antonines  that the town  Mareia  near  Alexandria  which was formerly a large city had dwindled into a village This is not properly speaking a contradiction  Suidas August  says that the emperor  Augustus  having number'd the whole  Roman  empire found it contain'd only men  There is here surely some great mistake either in the author or transcriber But this authority feeble as it is may be sufficient to counterbalance the exaggerated accounts of  Herodotus  and  Diodorus Siculus  with regard to more early times  But we are not told  that all extensive governments especially absolute monarchies are destructive to population and contain  a secret vice and poison which destroy the effect of all these promising appearances  L'Esprit des loix  livre chap  To confirm this there is a passage cited from  Plutarch  De orac defectu  which being somewhat singular we shall here examine it  THAT author endeavouring to account for the silence of many of the oracles says that it may be ascribed to the present desolation of the world proceeding from former wars and factions which common calamity he adds has fallen heavier upon  Greece  than on any other country insomuch that the whole cou'd scarce at present furnish out three thousand warriors which in the time of the  Median  war were supply'd by the single city of  Megara  The gods therefore who affect works of dignity and importance have supprest many of their oracles and deign not to use so many interpreters of their will to so diminutive a people  I MUST confess that this passage contains so many difficulties that I know not what to make of it You may observe that  Plutarch  assigns for a cause  of the decay of mankind not the extensive dominion of the  Romans  but the former wars and factions of the several nations all which were quieted by the  Roman  arms  Plutarch  's reasoning therefore is directly contrary to the inference which is drawn from the fact he advances  Polybius  supposes that  Greece  had become more prosperous and flourishing after the establishment of the  Roman  yoke  LIB cap It may perhaps be imagin'd that  Polybius  being dependent on  Rome  wou'd naturally extol the  Roman  dominion But in the  first  place  Polybius  tho' one sees sometimes instances of his caution discovers no symptoms of flattery  Secondly  This opinion is only deliver'd in a single stroke by the bye while he is intent upon another subject and 'tis allow'd if there be any suspicion of an author's insincerity that these oblique propositions discover his real opinion better than his more formal and direct assertions  and tho' that historian wrote before these conquerors had degenerated from being the patrons to be the plunderers of mankind yet as we find from  Tacitus  Annal  lib cap  that the severity of the emperors afterwards corrected the licence of the governors we have no reason to think that extensive monarchy so destructive as it is often represented  WE learn from  Strabo  LIB  that the  Romans  from their regard to the  Greeks  maintain'd to his time most of the privileges and liberties of that celebrated  nation and  Nero  afterwards rather encreas'd them  Plutarch De his qui sero a Numine puniuntur  How therefore can we imagine that the  Roman  yoke was so burthensome over that part of the world The oppression of the proconsuls was check'd and the magistracies in  Greece  being all bestow'd in the several cities by the free votes of the people there was no great necessity for the competitors to attend the emperor's court If great numbers went to seek their fortunes in  Rome  and advance themselves by learning or eloquence the commodities of their native country many of them wou'd return with the fortunes they had made and thereby enrich the  Grecian  commonwealths  BUT  Plutarch  says that the general depopulation had been more sensibly felt in  Greece  than in any other country How is this reconcileable to its superior privileges and advantages  BESIDES this passage by proving too much really proves nothing  Only three thousand men able to bear arms in all Greece  Who can admit so strange a proposition especially if we consider the great numbers of  Greek  cities whose names still remain in history and which are mention'd by writers long after the age of  Plutarch  There are there surely ten times more people at present when there scarce remains a city in all the bounds  of antient  Greece  That country is still tolerably cultivated and furnishes a sure supply of corn in case of any scarcity in  Spain Italy  or the South of  France  WE must observe that the antient frugality of the  Greeks  and their equality of property still subsisted during the age of  Plutarch  as appears from  Lucian  De mercede conductis  Nor is there any ground to imagine that that country was possest by a few masters and a great number of slaves  'TIS probable indeed that military discipline being entirely useless was extremely neglected in  Greece  after the establishment of the  Roman  empire and if these commonwealths formerly so warlike and ambitious maintain'd each of them a small city guard to prevent mobbish disorders 'tis all they had occasion for And these perhaps did not amount to three thousand men throughout all  Greece  I own that if  Plutarch  had this fact in his eye he is here guilty of a very gross paralogism and assigns causes no way proportion'd to the effects But is it so great a prodigy that an author shou'd fall into a mistake of this nature  I must confess that that discourse of  Plutarch  concerning the silence of the oracles is in general of so odd a texture and so unlike his other productions that one is at a loss what judgment to form of it 'Tis wrote in dialogue which is a method of composition that  Plutarch  commonly little affects The personages he introduces advance very wild absurd and contradictory opinions more like the visionary systems of  Plato  than the solid sense of  Plutarch  There runs also thro' the whole an air of superstition and credulity which resembles very little the spirit that appears in the other philosophical compositions of that author For 'tis remarkable that tho'  Plutarch  be an historian as superstitious as  Herodotus  or  Livy  yet there is scarcely in all antiquity a philosopher less superstitious excepting  Cicero  and  Lucian  I must therefore confess that a passage of  Plutarch  cited from this discourse has much less authority with me than if it had been found in most of his other compositions  THERE is only one other discourse of  Plutarch  liable to like objections  viz  that  concerning those whose punishment is delay'd by the Deity  It is also wrote in dialogue contains like superstitious wild visions and seems to have been chiefly compos'd in rivalship to  Plato  particularly his last book  de republica  AND here I cannot but observe that Mons  Fontenelle  a writer eminent for candour seems to have departed a little from his usual character when he endeavours to throw a ridicule upon  Plutarch  on account of passages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles The absurdities here put into the mouths of the several personages are not to be ascrib'd to  Plutarch  He makes them resute each other and in general he seems to intend the ridiculing of those very opinions which  Fontenelle  wou'd ridicule him for maintaining See  Histoire des Oracles  BUT whatever force may remain in this passage of  Plutarch  we shall endeavour to counterbalance it by as remarkable a passage in  Diodorus Siculus  where the historian after mentioning  Ninus  's army of foot and horse endeavours to support the credibility of this account by some posterior facts and adds that we must not form a notion of the antient populousness  of mankind from the present emptiness and depopulation which is spread over the world  LIB  Thus an author who liv'd at that very period of antiquity which is represented as most populous  HE was contemporary with  Caesar  and  Augustus  complains of the desolation which then prevail'd gives the preference to former times and has recourse to antient fables as a foundation for his opinion The humour of blaming the present and admiring the past is strongly rooted in human nature and has an influence even on persons endu'd with the profoundest judgment and most extensive learning  DISCOURSE XI  Of the Protestant Succession  I SUPPOSE that a member of parliament in the reign of king  William  or queen  Anne  while the establishment of the  protestant succession  was yet uncertain were deliberating concerning the party he wou'd chuse in that important question and weighing with impartiality the advantages and disadvantages on each side I believe the following particulars wou'd have enter'd into his consideration  HE wou'd easily perceive the great advantages resulting from the restoration of the  Stuart  family by which we shou'd preserve the succession clear and undisputed free from a pretender with such a specious title as that of blood which with the multitude is always the claim the strongest and most easily comprehended 'Tis in vain to say as many have done that the question with regard to  governors  independent of  government  is frivolous and little worth disputing much less fighting about The generality of mankind never will enter into these sentiments and 'tis much happier I believe for society that they do not but continue in their natural prejudices and prepossessions How cou'd  stability be preserv'd in any monarchical government which tho' perhaps not the best is and always has been the most common of any unless men had so passionate a regard for the true heir of their royal family and even tho' weak in understanding or infirm in years gave him so great a preference above persons the most accomplish'd in shining talents or celebrated for great atchievements Wou'd not every popular leader put in his claim at every vacancy or even without any vacancy and the kingdom become the theatre of perpetual wars and convulsions The condition of the  Roman  empire surely was not in this respect much to be envy'd nor is that of the  Eastern  nations who pay little regard to the title of their sovereigns but sacrifice them every day to the caprice or momentary humour of the populace or soldiery 'Tis but a foolish wisdom which is so carefully display'd in undervaluing princes and placing them on a level with the meanest of mankind To be sure an anatomist finds no more in the greatest monarch than in the lowest peasant or daylabourer and a moralist may perhaps frequently find less But what do all these reflections tend to We all of us still retain these prejudices in favour of birth and family and neither in our serious occupations nor most careless amusements can we ever get entirely rid of them A tragedy that wou'd represent the adventures of common sailors or porters or even of private  gentlemen wou'd presently disgust us but one that introduces kings and princes acquires in our eyes an air of importance and dignity Or shou'd a man be able by his superior wisdom to get entirely above such prepossessions he wou'd soon by means of the same wisdom again bring himself down to them for the sake of society whose welfare he wou'd perceive to be intimately connected with them Far from endeavouring to undeceive the people in this particular he wou'd cherish and foster such sentiments of reverence to their princes as requisite to preserve a due subordination in society And tho' the lives of twenty thousand men be often sacrific'd to maintain a king in possession of his throne or preserve the right of succession undisturbed he entertains no indignation at the loss on pretence that every individual of these was perhaps in himself as valuable as the prince he serv'd He considers the consequences of violating the hereditary right of kings Consequences which may be felt for many centuries while the loss of several thousand men brings so little prejudice to a large kingdom that it may not be perceiv'd a few years afterwards  THE advantages of the  Hanover  succession are of an opposite nature and arise from this very circumstance that it violates hereditary right and places on the throne a prince to whom birth gave no title to that dignity 'Tis evident to any one  who considers the history of this island that the privileges of the people have during the two last centuries been continually upon the encrease by the division of the church lands by the alienations of the barons estates by the progress of trade and above all by the happiness of our situation which for a long time gave us sufficient security without any standing army or military establishment On the contrary public liberty has almost in every other nation of  Europe  been during the same period extremely upon the decline while the people were disgusted at the hardships of the old  Gothic  militia and chose rather to entrust their prince with mercenary armies which he easily turn'd against themselves 'Twas nothing extraordinary therefore that some of our  British  sovereigns mistook the nature of the constitution and genius of the people and as they embrac'd all the favourable precedents left them by their ancestors they overlook'd all those which were contrary and which suppos'd a limitation in our government They were encourag'd in this mistake by the example of all the neighbouring princes who bearing the same title or appellation and being adorn'd with the same ensigns of authority naturally led them to claim the same powers and prerogatives  IT appears from the speeches and proclamations and whole train of king  James  the I 's actions as well as his son's that they consider'd the  English  government as a simple monarchy and never imagin'd that any considerable part of their subjects entertain'd a contrary idea This made them discover their pretensions without preparing any force to support them and even without reserve or disguise which are always employ'd by those who enter upon any new project or endeavour to innovate in any government King  James  told his parliament plainly when they meddled in state affairs  Ne sutor ultra crepidam  He us'd also at his table in promiscuous companies to advance his notions in a manner still more undisguis'd As we may learn from a story told in the life of Mr  Waller  and which that poet us'd frequently to repeat When Mr  Waller  was young he had the curiosity to go to court and he stood in the circle and saw king  James  dine where amongst other company there sat at table two bishops The king openly and aloud propos'd this question  Whether he might not take his subjects money when he had occasion for it without all this formality of parliament  The one bishop readily replied  God forbid you shou'd not For you are the breath of our nostrils  The other bishop declin'd answering and said he was not skill'd in parliamentary cases But upon the king's urging him and saying he wou'd admit of no evasion his lordship replied very pleasantly  Why then I think your majesty may lawfully take my brother's money For he offers it  In Sir  Walter Raleigh  's preface to the history of the world there is this remarkable passage Philip  the II by strong hand and main force attempted to make himself not only an  absolute monarch  over the  Netherlands  like unto the kings and sovereigns of  England  and  France  but  Turklike  to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws privileges and antient rights Spenser  speaking of some grants of the  English  kings to the  Irish  corporations says  All which tho' at the time of their first grant they were tolerable and perhaps reasonable yet now are most unreasonable and inconvenient But all these will easily be cut off with the superior power of her majesty's prerogative against which her own grants are not to be pleaded or enforc'd  State of Ireland  page Edit  As these were very common tho' not perhaps the universal notions of the times the two first princes of the house of  Stuart  were the more excusable for their mistake And  Rapin  the most judicious of historians seems sometimes to treat them with too much severity upon account of it  The flattery of courtiers farther blinded them and above all that of the clergy who from several passages of their  scripture  and these wrested too had erected a regular and avow'd system of  tyranny and despotic power The only method of destroying at once all these exorbitant claims and pretensions was to depart from the true hereditary line and chuse a prince who being plainly a creature of the public and receiving the crown on conditions exprest and avow'd found his authority establish'd on the same bottom with the privileges of the people By electing him in the royal line we cut off all hopes of ambitious subjects who might in future emergencies disturb the government by their cabals and pretensions By rendering the crown hereditary in his family we avoided all the inconveniencies of elective monarchy And by excluding the lineal heir we secur'd all our constitutional limitations and render'd our government uniform and of a piece The people cherish monarchy because protected by it The monarch favours liberty because created by it And thus every advantage is obtain'd by the new establishment as far as human skill and wisdom can extend itself  THESE are the separate advantages of fixing the succession either in the house of  Stuart  or in that of  Hanover  There are also disadvantages in each establishment which an impartial patriot wou'd ponder and examine in order to form a just judgment upon the whole  THE disadvantages of the protestant succession consist in the foreign dominions which are possest by the princes of the  Hanover  line and which it might be suppos'd wou'd engage us in the intrigues and wars of the continent and lose us in some measure the inestimable advantage we possess of being surrounded and guarded by the sea which we command The disadvantages of recalling the abdicated family consist chiefly in their religion which is more prejudicial to society than that establish'd amongst us is contrary to it and affords no toleration or peace or security to any other religion  IT appears to me that all these advantages and disadvantages are allow'd on both sides at least by every one who is at all susceptible of argument or reasoning No subject however loyal pretends to deny that the disputed title and foreign dominions of the present royal family are a loss nor is there any partizan of the  Stuart  family but will confess that the claim of hereditary indefeasible right and the  Roman  catholick religion are also disadvantages  in that family It belongs therefore to a philosopher alone who is of neither party to put all these circumstances in the scale and assign to each of them its proper poize and influence Such an one will readily at first acknowledge that all political questions are infinitely complicated and that there scarce ever occurs in any deliberation a choice which is either purely good or purely ill Consequences mix'd and vary'd may be foreseen to flow from every measure And many consequences unforeseen do always in fact result from it Hesitation and reserve and suspence are therefore the only sentiments he brings to this essay or trial Or if he indulges any passion 'tis that of derision and ridicule against the ignorant multitude who are always clamorous and dogmatical even in the nicest questions of which from want of temper perhaps still more than of understanding they are altogether unfit judges  BUT to say something more determinate on this head the following reflections will I hope show the temper if not the understanding of a philosopher  WERE we to judge merely by first appearance and by past experience we must allow that the advantages of a parliamentary title in the house of  Hanover  are much greater than those of an undisputed hereditary title in the house of  Stuart  and  that our fathers acted wisely in preferring the former to the latter So long as the house of  Stuart  reign'd in  Britain  which with some interruptions was above years the government was kept in a continual fever by the contentions betwixt the privileges of the people and the prerogatives of the crown If arms were dropt the noise of disputes continu'd Or if these were silenc'd jealousy still corroded the heart and threw the nation into an unnatural ferment and disorder And while we were thus occupy'd in domestic contentions a foreign power dangerous if not fatal to public liberty erected itself in  Europe  without any opposition from us and even sometimes with our assistance  BUT within these last sixty years when a parliamentary establishment has taken place whatever factions may have prevail'd either amongst the people or in public assemblies the whole force of our constitution has always fallen to one side and an uninterrupted harmony has been preserv'd betwixt our princes and our parliaments Public liberty with internal peace and order has flourish'd almost without interruption Trade and manufactures and agriculture have encreas'd The arts and sciences and philosophy have been cultivated Even religious parties have been necessitated to lay aside their mutual rancour And the glory of the nation has spread itself all over  Europe  while we  stand the bulwark against oppression and the great antagonist of that power which threatens every people with conquest and subjection So long and so glorious a period no nation almost can boast of nor is there another instance in the whole history of mankind that so many millions of people have during such a space of time been held together in a manner so free so rational and so suitable to the dignity of human nature  BUT tho' this recent instance seems clearly to decide in favour of the present establishment there are some circumstances to be thrown into the other scale and 'tis dangerous to regulate our judgment by one event or example  WE have had two rebellions during the flourishing period above mention'd besides plots and conspiracies without number And if none of these have produc'd any very fatal event we may ascribe our escape chiefly to the narrow genius of those princes who disputed our establishment and may esteem ourselves so far fortunate But the claims of the banish'd family I fear are not yet antiquated and who can foretel that their future attempts will produce no greater disorder  THE disputes betwixt privilege and prerogative may easily be compos'd by laws and votes and conferences and concessions where there is tolerable  temper or prudence on both sides or on either side Amongst contending titles the question can only be determin'd by the sword and by devastation and by civil war  A PRINCE who fills the throne with a disputed title dares not arm his subjects the only method of securing a people fully both against domestic oppression and foreign conquest  NOTWITHSTANDING all our riches and renown what a critical escape did we lately make from dangers which were owing not so much to bad conduct and ill success in war as to the pernicious practice of mortgaging our finances and the still more pernicious maxim of never paying off our incumbrances Such fatal measures cou'd never have been embrac'd had it not been to secure a precarious establishment  THOSE who consider how universal this pernicious practice of funding has become all over  Europe  may perhaps dispute this last opinion But we lay under less necessity than other states  BUT to convince us that an hereditary title is to be embrac'd rather than a parliamentary one which is not supported by any other views or motives a man needs only transport himself back to the aera of the restoration and suppose that he had had a seat in that parliament which recall'd the royal family and put a period to the greatest disorders  that ever arose from the opposite pretensions of prince and people What wou'd have been thought of one that had propos'd at that time to set aside  Charles  the second and settle the crown on the duke of  York  or  Gloucester  merely in order to exclude the high claims of their father and grandfather Wou'd not such an one have been regarded as a very extravagant projector who lov'd dangerous remedies and cou'd tamper and play with a government and national constitution like a quack with a sickly patient  THE advantages which result from a parliamentary title preferably to an hereditary one tho' they are great are too refin'd ever to enter into the conception of the vulgar The bulk of mankind wou'd never allow them to be sufficient for committing what wou'd be regarded as an injustice to the prince They must be supported by some gross popular and familiar topics and wise men tho' convinc'd of their force wou'd reject them in compliance with the weakness and prejudices of the people An encroaching tyrant or deluded bigot alone by his misconduct is able to enrage the nation and render practicable what was always perhaps desirable  IN reality the reason asiign'd by the nation for excluding the race of  Stuart  and so many other branches of the royal family is not on account of  their hereditary title which however just in itself wou'd to vulgar apprehensions have appear'd altogether absurd but on account of their religion Which leads us to compare the disadvantages above mention'd of each establishment  I CONFESS that considering the matter in general it were rather to be wish'd that our prince had no foreign dominions and cou'd confine all his attention to the government of this island For not to mention some real inconveniencies that may result from territories on the continent they afford such a handle for calumny and defamation as is greedily seiz'd by the people who are always dispos'd to think ill of their superiors It must however be acknowledg'd that  Hanover  is perhaps the spot of ground in  Europe  the least inconvenient for a king of  Britain  It lyes in the heart of  Germany  at a distance from the great powers which are our natural rivals It is protected by the laws of the empire as well as by the arms of its own sovereign And it serves only to connect us more closely with the house of  Austria  which is our natural ally  IN the last war it has been of service to us by furnishing us with a considerable body of auxiliary troops the bravest and most faithful in the world The elector of  Hanover  is the only considerable prince in the empire who has drove no separate  end and has rais'd up no stale pretensions during the late commotions of  Europe  but has acted all along with the dignity of a king of  Britain  And ever since the accession of that family 'twou'd be difficult to show any harm we have ever receiv'd from the electoral dominions except that short disgust in with  Charles  the twelfth who regulating himself by maxims very different from those of other princes made a personal quarrel of every public injury  THE religious persuasion of the house of  Stuart  is an inconvenience of a much deeper dye and wou'd threaten us with much more dismal consequences The  Roman  catholic religion with its huge train of priests and friers is vastly more expensive than ours Even tho' unaccompany'd with its natural attendants of inquisitors and stakes and gibbets it is less tolerating And not contented with dividing the sacerdotal from the regal office which must be prejudicial to any state it bestows the former on a foreigner who has always a separate and may often have an opposite interest to that of the public  BUT were this religion ever so advantageous to society it is contrary to that which is establish'd among us and which is likely to keep possession for a long time of the minds of the people And tho' it is much to be hop'd that the progress of reason  and philosophy will by degrees abate the virulent acrimony of opposite religious all over  Europe  yet the spirit of moderation has as yet made too slow advances to be entirely trusted The conduct of the  Saxon  family where the same person can be a catholic king and a protestant elector is perhaps the first instance in modern times of so reasonable and prudent a behaviour And the gradual progress of the catholic superstition does even there prognosticate a speedy alteration After which 'tis justly to be apprehended that persecutions will put a speedy period to the protestant religion in the place of its nativity  THUS upon the whole the advantages of the settlement in the family of  Stuart  which frees us from a disputed title seem to bear some proportion with those of the settlement in the family of  Hanover  which frees us from the claims of prerogative But at the same time its disadvantages by placing on the throne a  Roman  catholic are much greater than those of the other establishment in settling the crown on a foreign prince What party an impartial patriot in the reign of king  William  or queen  Anne  wou'd have chosen amidst these opposite views may perhaps to some appear hard to determine For my part I esteem liberty so invaluable a blessing in society that whatever favours its progress and security can scarce  be too fondly cherish'd by every one who is a lover of human kind  BUT the settlement in the house of  Hanover  has actually taken place The princes of that family without intrigue without cabal without sollicitation on their part have been call'd to mount our throne by the united voice of the whole legislative body They have since their accession display'd in all their actions the utmost mildness equity and regard to the laws and constitution Our own ministers our own parliaments ourselves have govern'd us and if aught ill has befallen us we can only blame fortune or ourselves What a reproach must we become amongst nations if disgusted with a settlement so deliberately made and whose conditions have been so religiously observ'd we shou'd throw every thing again into confusion and by our levity and rebellious disposition prove ourselves totally unfit for any state but that of absolute slavery and subjection  THE greatest inconvenience attending a disputed title is that it brings us in danger of civil wars and rebellions What wise man to avoid this inconvenience wou'd run directly upon a civil war and rebellion Not to mention that so long possession secur'd by so many laws must e're this time in the apprehension of a great part of the nation have begot a title in the house of  Hanover  independent of their present possession So that now we shou'd not even by a revolution obtain the end of avoiding a disputed title  No revolution made by national forces will ever be able without some other great necessity to abolish our debts and incumbrances in which the interest of so many persons is concern'd And a revolution made by foreign forces is a conquest A calamity with which the precarious balance of power very nearly threatens us and which our civil dissensions are likely above all other circumces to bring suddenly upon us  DISCOURSE XII  Idea of a perfect Commonwealth  OF all mankind there are none so pernicious as political projectors if they have power nor so ridiculous if they want it As on the other hand a wise politician is the most beneficial character in nature if accompany'd with authority and the most innocent and not altogether useless even if depriv'd of it 'Tis not with forms of government as with other artificial contrivances where an old engine may be rejected if we can discover another more accurate and commodious or where trials may safely be made even tho' the success be doubtful An establish'd government has an infinite advantage by that very circumstance of its being establish'd the bulk of mankind being govern'd by authority not reason and never attributing authority to any thing that has not the recommendation of antiquity To tamper therefore in this affair or try projects merely upon the credit of suppos'd argument and philosophy can never be the part of a wise magistrate who will bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age and tho' he may attempt some improvement for the public good yet will he adjust his innovations as much as possible to the antient fabric and preserve  entire the chief pillars and supports of the constitution  THE mathematicians in  Europe  have been much divided concerning that figure of a ship which is the most commodious for sailing and  Huygens  who at last fixt this controversy is justly thought to have oblig'd the learned as well as commercial world tho'  Columbus  had sail'd to  America  and Sir  Francis Drake  made the tour of the world without any such discovery As one form of government must be allow'd more perfect than another independent of the manners and humours of particular men Why may we not enquire what is the most perfect of all tho' the common botcht and inaccurate governments seem to serve the purposes of society and tho' it be not so easy to establish a new government as to build a vessel upon a new plan The subject is surely the most worthy curiosity of any the wit of man can possibly devise And who knows if this controversy were fixt by the universal consent of the learned but in some future age an opportunity might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice either by a dissolution of the old governments or the combination of men to form a new one in some distant part of the world In all cases it must be advantageous to know what is most perfect in the kind that we may be able to bring any real constitution or form of government as near it as possible by  such gentle alterations and innovations as may not give too great disturbance to society  ALL I'pretend to in the present essay is to revive this subject of speculation and therefore I shall deliver my sentiments in as few words as possible A long dissertation on that head wou'd not I apprehend be very acceptable to the public who will be apt to regard such disquisitions both as useless and chimerical  ALL plans of government which suppose great reformation in the manners of mankind are plainly imaginary Of this nature are the republic of  Plato  and the  Utopia  of Sir  Thomas More  The  Oceana  is the only valuable model of a commonwealth that has yet been offer'd to the public  THE chief defects of the  Oceana  seem to be these  First  Its rotation is inconvenient by throwing men of whatever ability by intervals out of public employments  Secondly  Its  Agrarian  is impracticable Men will soon learn the art which was practis'd in antient  Rome  of concealing their possessions under other peoples names till at last the abuse will become so common that they will throw off even the appearance of restraint  Thirdly  The  Oceana  provides not a sufficient security for liberty or the redress of grievances The senate must propose and the people consent by which  means the senate have not only a negative upon the people but what is of infinitely greater consequence their negative goes before the votes of the people Were the king's negative of the same nature in the  English  constitution and cou'd he prevent any bill from coming into parliament he wou'd be an absolute monarch As his negative follows the votes of the houses it is of little consequence Such a difference is there in the manner of placing the same thing When a popular bill has been debated in the two houses is brought to maturity all its conveniencies and inconveniencies weigh'd and balanc'd if afterwards it be presented for the royal assent few princes will venture to reject the unanimous desire of the people But cou'd the king crush a disagreeable bill in embryo as was the case for some time in the  Scotch  parliament by means of the lords of the articles the  British  government wou'd have no balance nor wou'd grievances ever be redrest And 'tis certain that exorbitant power proceeds not in any government from new laws so much as from neglecting to remedy the abuses which frequently rise upon the old ones A government says  Machiavel  must often be brought back to its original principles It appears then that in the  Oceana  the whole legislature may be said to rest in the senate which  Harrington  wou'd own to be an inconvenient form of government especially after the  Agrarian  is abolish'd  HERE is a form of government to which I cannot in theory discover any considerable objection Let  Great Britain  and  Ireland  or any territory of equal extent be divided into counties and each county into parishes making in all If the country purpos'd to be erected into a commonwealth be of more narrow extent we may diminish the number of counties but never bring them below thirty If it be of greater extent 'twere better to enlarge the parishes or throw more parishes into a county than encrease the number of counties  LET all the freeholders in the country parishes and those who pay scot and lot in the town parishes meet annually in the parish church and chuse by ballot some freeholder of the county for their member whom we shall call the county  representative  LET the county representatives two days after their election meet in the county town and chuse by ballot from their own body ten county  magistrates  and one  senator  There are therefore in the whole commonwealth senators county magistrates and county representatives For we shall bestow on all senators the authority of county magistrates and on all county magistrates the authority of county representatives  LET the senators meet in the capital and be endow'd with the whole executive power of the commonwealth the power of peace and war of giving orders to generals admirals and ambassadors and in short all the prerogatives of a  British  king except his negative  LET the county representatives meet in their particular counties and possess the whole legislative power of the commonwealth the greatest number of counties deciding the question and where these are equal let the senate have the casting vote  EVERY new law must first be debated in the senate and tho' rejected by it if ten senators insist and protest it must be sent down to the counties The senate may join to the copy of the law their reasons for receiving or rejecting it  BECAUSE it would be troublesome to assemble the whole county representatives for every trivial law that may be requisite the senate have their choice of sending down the law either to the county magistrates or county representatives  THE magistrates tho' the law be referr'd to them may if they please call the representatives and submit the affair to their determination  WHETHER the law be referr'd by the senate to the county magistrates or representatives a copy of it and of the senate's reasons must be sent to  every representative eight days before the day appointed for the assembling in order to deliberate concerning it And tho' the determination be by the senate referr'd to the magistrates if five representatives of the county order the magistrates to assemble the whole court of representatives and submit the affair to their determination they must obey  EITHER the county magistrates or representatives may give to the senator of the county the copy of a law to be propos'd to the senate and if five counties concur in the same order the law tho' refus'd by the senate must come either to the county magistrates or representatives as is contain'd in the order of the five counties  ANY twenty counties by a vote either of their magistrates or representatives may throw any man out of all public offices for a year Thirty counties for three years  THE senate has a power of throwing out any member or number of members of its own body not to be reelected for that year The senate cannot throw out twice in a year the senator of the same county  THE power of the old senate continues for three weeks after the annual election of the county representatives Then all the new senators are shut up in a conclave like the cardinals and by an intricate  ballot such as that of  Venice  or  Malta  they chuse the following magistrates a protector who represents the dignity of the commonwealth and presides in the senate two secretaries of state these six councils a council of state a council of religion and learning a council of trade a council of laws a council of war a council of the admiralty each council consisting of five persons Along with six commissioners of the treasury and a chief commissioner All these must be senators The senate also names all the ambassadors to foreign courts who may either be senators or not  THE senate may continue any or all of these but must reelect them every year  THE protector and two secretaries have session and suffrage in the council of state The business of that council is all foreign politics The council of state has session and suffrage in all the other councils  THE council of religion and learning inspects the universities and clergy That of trade inspects every thing that may affect commerce That of laws inspects all the abuses of laws by the inferior magistrates and examines what improvements may be made of the municipal law That of war inspects the militia and its discipline magazines stores  c  and when the republic is in war examines into the proper orders for generals The council of admiralty has the same power with regard  to the navy along with the nomination of the captains and all inferior officers  NONE of these councils can give orders themselves except where they receive such powers from the senate In other cases they must communicate every thing to the senate  WHEN the senate is under adjournment any of the councils may assemble it before the day appointed for its meeting  BESIDES these councils or courts there is another call'd the court of  competitors  which is thus constituted If any candidates for the office of senator have more votes than a third of the representatives that candidate which has most votes next to the senator elected becomes incapable for one year of all public offices even of being a magistrate or representative But he takes his seat in the court of competitors Here then is a court which may sometimes consist of a hundred members sometimes have no members at all and by that means be for a year abolish'd  THE court of competitors has no power in the commonwealth It has only the inspection of public accounts and the accusing any man before the senate If the senate acquit him the court of competitors may if they please appeal to the people either magistrates or representatives Upon that appeal the magistrates or representatives meet on the day appointed by the court of competitors  and chuse in each county three persons from which number every senator is excluded These to the number of meet in the capital and bring the person accus'd to a new trial  The court of competitors may propose any law to the senate and if refus'd may appeal to the people that is to the magistrates or representatives who examine it in their counties Every senator who is thrown out of the senate by a vote of the court takes his seat in the court of competitors  THE senate possesses all the judicative authority of the house of lords that is all the appeals from the inferior courts It likewise nominates the lord chancellor and all the officers of the law  EVERY county is a kind of republic within itself and the representatives may make county laws which have no authority 'till three months after they are voted A copy of the law is sent to the senate and to every other county The senate or any single county may at any time annul any law of another county  THE representatives have all the authority of the  British  justices of the peace in trials commitments  c  THE magistrates have the nomination of all the officers of the revenue in each county All causes with regard to the revenue are appeal'd ultimately  to the magistrates They pass the accompts of all the officers but must have all their own accompts examin'd and past at the end of the year by the representatives  THE magistrates name rectors or ministers to all the parishes  THE presbyterian government is establish'd and the highest ecclesiastical court is an assembly or synod of all the presbyters of the county The magistrates may take any cause from this court and determine it themselves  THE magistrates may try and depose or suspend any presbyter  THE militia is establish'd in imitation of that in  Swisserland  which being well known we shall not insist upon it 'Twill only be proper to make this addition that an army of be annually drawn out by rotation paid and encamp'd during six weeks in summer that the duty of a camp may not be altogether unknown  THE magistrates nominate all the colonels and downwards The senate all upwards During war the general nominates the colonel and downwards and his commission is good for a twelvemonth But after that it must be confirm'd by the magistrates of the county to which the regiment belongs The magistrates may break any officer in the county regiment And the senate may do the same to any officer in the service If the magistrates  do not think proper to confirm the general's choice they may nominate another officer in the place of him they reject  ALL crimes are try'd within the county by the magistrates and a jury But the senate can stop any trial and bring it before themselves  ANY county may indict any man before the senate for any crime  THE protector the two secretaries the council of state with any five more that the senate appoints on extraordinary emergencies are possest of  dictatorial  power for six months  THE protector may pardon any person condemn'd by the inferior courts  IN time of war no officer of the army that is in the field can have any civil office in the commonwealth  THE capital which we shall call  London  may be allow'd four members in the senate It may therefore be divided into four counties The representatives of each of these chuse one senator and ten magistrates There are therefore in the city four senators forty four magistrates and four hundred representatives The magistrates have the same authority as in the counties The representatives also have the same authority but they never meet in one general court They give their  votes in their particular county or division of hundreds  WHEN they enact any city law the greatest number of counties or divisions determines the matter And where these are equal the magistrates have the casting vote  THE magistrates chuse the mayor sheriff recorder and other officers of the city  IN the commonwealth no representative magistrate or senator as such has any salary The protector secretaries councils and ambassadors have salaries  THE first year in every century is set apart to correct all inequalities which time may have produc'd in the representation This must be done by the legislature  THE following political aphorisms may explain the reason of these orders  THE lower sort of people and small proprietors are good enough judges of one not very distant from them in rank or habitation and therefore in their parochial meetings will probably chuse the best or nearly the best representative But they are wholly unfit for county meetings and for electing into the higher offices of the republic Their ignorance gives the grandees an opportunity of deceiving them  TEN thousand even tho' they were not annually elected are a large enough basis for any free government 'Tis true the nobles in  Poland  are more than and yet these oppress the people But as power continues there always in the same persons and families this makes them in a manner a different nation from the people Besides the nobles are there united under a few heads of families  ALL free governments must consist of two councils a less and a greater or in other words of a senate and people The people as  Harrington  observes wou'd want wisdom without the senate The senate without the people wou'd want honesty  A LARGE assembly of for instance to represent the people if allow'd to debate wou'd fall into disorder If not allow'd to debate the senate has a negative upon them and the worst kind of negative that before resolution  HERE therefore is an inconvenience which no government has yet fully remedy'd but which is the easiest to be remedy'd in the world If the people debate all is confusion If they do not debate they can only resolve and then the senate carves for them Divide the people into many separate bodies and then they may debate with  safety and every inconvenience seems to be prevented  CARDINAL  de Retz  says that all numerous assemblies however compos'd are mere mob and sway'd in their debates by the least motive This we find confirm'd by daily experience When an absurdity strikes a member he conveys it to his neighbour and so on till the whole be infected Separate this great body and tho every member be only of middling sense 'tis not probable that any thing but reason can prevail over the whole Influence and example being remov'd good sense will always get the better of bad among a number of people Good sense is one thing But follies are numberless and every man has a different one The only way of making a people wise is to keep them from uniting into large assemblies  THERE are two things to be guarded against in every  senate  Its combination and its division Its combination is most dangerous and against this inconvenience we have provided the following remedies The great dependence of the senators on the people by annual elections and that not by an undistinguishing rabble like the  English  electors but by men of fortune and education The small power they are allow'd They have few offices to dispose of Almost all are given by the magistrates in the counties The court of  competitors which being compos'd of men that are their rivals next to them in interest and uneasy in their present situation will be sure to take all advantages against them  THE division of the senate is prevented By the smallness of their number As faction supposes a combination to a separate interest it is prevented by their dependence on the people They have a power of expelling any factious member 'Tis true when another member of the same spirit comes from the county they have no power of expelling him Nor is it fit they shou'd for that shows the humour to be in the people and probably arises from some ill conduct in public affairs Almost any man in a senate so regularly chosen by the people may be suppos'd fit for any civil office 'Twou'd be proper therefore for the senate to form some  general  resolutions with regard to the disposing of offices among the members Which resolutions wou'd not confine them in critical times when extraordinary parts on the one hand or extraordinary stupidity on the other appears in any senator but yet they wou'd be sufficient to prevent brigue and faction by making the disposal of the offices a thing of course For instance let it be a resolution that no man shall enjoy any office till he has sat four years in the senate That except ambassadors no man shall be in office two years following That  no man shall attain the higher offices but thro' the lower That no man shall be protector twice  c  The senate of  Venice  govern themselves by such resolutions  IN foreign politics the interest of the senate can scarc eever be divided from that of the people and therefore 'tis fit to make the senate absolute with regard to them otherwise there cou'd be no se crecy nor refin'd policy Besides without money no alliance can be executed and the senate is still sufficiently dependent Not to mention that the legislative power being always superior to the executive the magistrates or representatives may interpose whenever they think proper  THE chief support of the  British  government is the opposition of interests but that tho' in the main serviceable breeds endless factions In the foregoing plan it does all the good without any of the harm The  competitors  have no power of controlling the senate They have only the power of accusing and appealing to the people  'TIS necessary likewise to prevent both combination and division in the thousand magistrates This is done sufficiently by the separation of places and interests  BUT lest that shou'd not be enough their dependence on the for their elections serves to the same purpose  NOR is that all For the may resume the power whenever they please and not only when they all please but when any five of a hundred please which will happen upon the very first suspicion of a separate interest  THE are too large a body either to unite or divide except when they meet in one place and fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders Not to mention their annual election by almost the whole body of the people  A SMALL commonwealth is the happiest government in the world within itself because every thing lyes under the eye of the rulers But it may be subdu'd by great force from without This scheme seems to have all the advantages both of a great and a little commonwealth  EVERY county law may be anull'd either by the senate or another county because that shows an opposition of interests In which case no part ought to decide for itself The matter must be referr'd to the whole which will best determine what agrees with general interest  AS to the clergy and militia the reasons of these orders are obvious Without the dependence of the clergy on the civil magistrate and without a militia 'tis folly to think any free government will ever have security or stability  IN many governments the inferior magistrates have no rewards but what arise from their ambition vanity or public spirit The salaries of the  French  judges amount not to the interest of the sums they pay for their offices The  Dutch  burgomasters have little more immediate profit than the  English  justices of peace or the members of the house of commons formerly But lest any shou'd suspect that this wou'd beget negligence in the administration which is little to be fear'd considering the natural ambition of mankind let the magistrates have competent salaries The senators have access to so many honourable and lucrative offices that their attendance needs not be bought There is little attendance requir'd of the representatives  THAT the foregoing plan of government is practicable no one can doubt who considers the resemblance it bears to the commonwealth of the United provinces formerly one of the wisest and most renown'd governments that ever was in the world The alterations in the present scheme are all evidently to the better The representation is more equal The unlimited power of the burgomasters in the towns which forms a perfect aristocracy in the  Dutch  commonwealth is corrected by a well temper'd democracy in giving to the people the annual election of the county  representatives The negative which every province and town has upon the whole body of the  Dutch  republic with regard to alliances peace and war and the imposition of taxes is here remov'd The counties in the present plan are not so independent of each other nor do they form separate bodies so much as the seven provinces where the jealousy and envy of the smaller provinces and towns against the greater particularly  Holland  and  Amsterdam  have frequently disturb'd the government Larger powers tho' of the safest kind are entrusted to the senate than the States General possess by which means the former may become more expeditious and secret in their resolutions than 'tis possible for the latter  THE chief alterations that cou'd be made on the  British  government in order to bring it to the mo  t perfect model of limited monarchy seem to be the following  First  The plan of the republican parliament ought to be restor'd by making the representation equal and by allowing none to vote in the county elections who possess not a hundred a year  Secondly  As such a house of commons wou'd be too weighty for a frail house of lords like the present the bishops and  Scotch  peers ought to be remov'd whose behaviour  in former parliaments  destroy'd entirely the authority of that house The number of the upper house ought to be rais'd to three or four hundred Their seats not  hereditary but during life They ought to have the election of their own members and no commoner shou'd be allow'd to refuse a seat that was offer'd him By this means the house of lords wou'd consist entirely of the men of chief credit ability and interest of the nation and every turbulent leader in the house of commons might be taken off and connected in interest with the house of peers Such an aristocracy wou'd be an excellent barrier both to the monarchy and against it At present the balance of our government depends in some measure on the ability and behaviour of the sovereign which are variable and uncertain circumstances  I ALLOW that this plan of limited monarchy however corrected is still liable to three great inconveniencies  First  It removes not entirely tho it may soften the parties of  court  and  country Secondly  The king's personal character must still have a great influence on the government  Thirdly  The sword is in the hands of a single person who will always neglect to discipline the militia in order to have a pretext for keeping up a standing army 'Tis evident that this is a mortal distemper in the  British  government of which it must at last inevitably perish I must however confess that  Sweden  seems in some measure to have remedy'd this inconvenience and to have a militia along with its limited monarchy as well as a  standing army which is less dangerous than the  British  WE shall conclude this subject with observing the falshood of the common opinion that no large state such as  France  or  Britain  cou'd ever be modell'd into a commonwealth but that such a form of government can only take place in a city or small territory The contrary seems evident Tho' 'tis more difficult to form a republican government in an extensive country than in a city there is more facility when once it is form'd of preserving it steady and uniform without tumult and faction in the former than in the latter 'Tis not easy for the distant parts of a large state to combine in any plan of free government but they easily conspire in the esteem and reverence for a single person who by means of this popular favour may seize the power and forcing the more obstinate to submit may establish a monarchical government On the other hand a city readily concurs in the same notions of government the natural equality of property favours liberty and the nearness of habitation enables the citizens mutually to assist each other Even under absolute princes the subordinate government of cities is commonly republican while that of counties and provinces is monarchical But these same circumstances which facilitate the erection of commonwealths in cities render their constitution more frail and uncertain Democracies  are turbulent For however the people may be separated or divided into small parties either in their votes or elections their near habitation in a city will always make the force of popular tides and currents very sensible Aristocracies are better adapted for peace and order and accordingly were most admired by antient writers but they are jealous and oppressive In a large government which is modell'd with masterly skill there is compass and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people who may be admitted into the first elections or first concoction of the commonwealth to the higher magistrates who direct all the motions At the same time the parts are so distant and remote that 'tis very difficult either by intrigue prejudice or passion to hurry them into any measures against the public interest  'TIS needless to enquire whether such a government wou'd be immortal I allow the justness of the poet's exclamation on the endless projects of human race  Man and for ever  The world itself probably is not immortal Such consuming plagues may arise as wou'd leave even a perfect government a weak prey to its neighbours We know not how far enthusiasm or other extraordinary motions of the human mind may transport men to the neglect of all order and public good Where difference of interest is remov'd whimsical and unaccountable factions often arise from personal  favour or enmity Perhaps rust may grow to the springs of the most accurate political machine and disorder its motions Lastly extensive conquests when pursu'd must be the ruin of every free government and of the more perfect governments sooner than of the imperfect because of the very advantages which the former possess above the latter And tho' such a state ought to establish a fundamental law against conquests Yet republics have ambition as well as individuals and present interest makes men forgetful of their posterity 'Tis a sufficient incitement to human endeavours that such a government wou'd flourish for many ages without pretending to bestow on any work of man that immortality which the Almighty seems to have refus'd to his own productions  FINIS
