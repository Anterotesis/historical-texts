 Mr MAITLAND'S ACCOUNT OF INOCULATING THE SMALL POX Vindicated From Dr WAGSTAFFE's Misrepresentations of that PRACTICE with some Remarks on Mr MASSEY's Sermon  The Second Edition  To which is added His First ACCOUNT of  Inoculating  the SMALL POX  LONDON  Printed and Sold by J PEELE at  Lock  's  Head  in  PaternosterRow    TO THE HONOURED Sir  HANS SLOAN  Bart PRESIDENT Of the Colledge of PHYSICIANS  c  _PERMIT Me Honoured SIR to Inscribe these few Sheets to you They are written in  Vindication  of the  Practice of Inoculating the  SMALL POX  Your known Candour and Experience encourage me to submit them to your Censure with Regard not only to the Safety of the  Method  but likewise to the Truth of the  Facts  here contested I am under great and many Obligations  Honoured Sir  Your most Obedient Humble Servant CHARLES MAITLAND  Mr MAITLAND's Account of INOCULATING THE Small Pox Vindicated  c  _I Am very Sensible of the Respect that is due to the Profession and Character of the Author of the Letter against  Inoculating the Small Pox  but am no less sensible of the Obligation I lye under to vindicate my own Reputation which a violent Fit of Sickness hath hitherto hinder'd me from doing And I can do it with the more Freedom because I am conscious to my self that I began this Practice in  England  with the same View to the  Publick Good  with which I hope the Learned Author condemns it I must take the Liberty to say that allowing the Doctor's Abilities to be as great as possible in his own Profession he seems not quite so well qualify'd to write upon this Subject because of the Narrowness of his  Experience as far as appears by his Letter and his partial Credulity or Incredulity in Matters of Fact which he takes from others and lastly because of strong Prejudices which impose upon his most excellent Understanding and draw him into Reasonings which either are inconsequential or conclude strongly for the Practice of  Inoculation  which they are brought to overturn All these I believe will appear very plain to any Impartial Reader in the following  Animadversions  in which I will endeavour to be as short as the Subject will allow  The Letter pretends to be an Admonition to Physicians not to meddle in this Practice of  Inoculation  'till they are better ascertain'd by Experience of the Success of it At the same Time it is a most warm Dissuasive not only to Physicians but to all Sorts of People not to practise it at all and consequently to deprive them of all Possibility of coming by Experience Would it not found somewhat absurd if any one should say to a young Physician Pray Sir don't Practise 'till you have Experience But it is still more so in this Case because in a Practice that is entirely to be laid aside you can neither have the Benefit of your own nor other Peoples Experience  As to Physicians meddling with this Practice of  Inoculation  I can only say it may favour too much of Novelty to be bigotly  zealous for it and too much of a FacultyInterest to be so violent against it Physicians cannot ingraft People against their own or their Parents Consent and a Physician would be out of his Duty who should persuade them to it contrary to their Inclinations On the other Hand If a Person from the Experience of the Fatality of the  Small Pox  in general or in his own Family in particular should resolve to ingraft his Child any Physician who should dissuade him from it might in a great measure be chargeable with the fatal Consequences of the Neglect of a Method which the Parent had propos'd as the only Moans to save his Child's Life And he would be still as much to blame if when the Parent had resolv'd to ingraft his Child he should refuse to attend him It is very common with Parents not only to leave their Children in Houses infected with the  Small Pox  but to bring them into the Room where their Brethren or Sisters lye ill of them and a Parent who does so conveys the Infection to his Child as deliberately and according to the Doctor certainly more than he who orders him to be  Inoculated  Would it not then be equally impertinent in the Physician to deny his Attendance in either Case  I must put the Doctor in Mind that there are very few of the most useful Discoveries in Physick that have not been strenuously  oppos'd by many of the Faculty upon their first Appearance There is extant a Decree of the College of Physicians at  Paris  against the Use of Antimonial Vomits It were easy to assign many Instances of the like Nature  As the Doctor is surpriz'd  that an Experiment practis'd only by a few ignorant Women amongst an illiterate and unthinking People should on a Sudden and upon a slender Experience so far obtain in one of the Politest Nations in the World as to be receiv'd into the Royal Palace  I hope he has not forgot that the Practice of Curing Intermitting Fevers by the BARK was introduc'd of a Sudden by a barbarous  Indian  if not into the Royal Family into the Family of a Viceroy and thence transmitted to us  Page The  Blood  of the  English if we speak of it as National is the Product of the richest Dyet  c  Ergo  to bring 'em to a spare Dyet before they have the  Small Pox  must be extremely dangerous and hurtful This must be the Doctor's Conclusion mine I own would be the direct contradictory If the Inflammatory State of the Blood arising from the Richness of the Dyet makes the  Small Pox  in  England  very mortal That Practice which either takes the Advantage of a contrary State of the Blood or by a Spare Dyet introduces it must be beneficial  Page  The finest the most Volatile and indeed Insensible Particles of the Animal Juices are the most penetrating and consequently the most contagious  And for the same Reason the most  noxious  Does it follow therefore To convey the Infection by the grosser and sensible Parts must be extremely unfit and dangerous I confess I should have inferr'd the contrary  The Symptoms are more or less and the Distemper appears in a greater or a less Degree according to the State of the Blood at the Time of Infection  Therefore the Practice of  Inoculation  is highly to be encouraged because it either finds or puts the Blood into a good State before the Infection seems to be a more natural Conclusion than the contrary One  Page  If we could be assur'd that the Distemper would not be equally uncertain by  Inoculation  according to the Nature of the Injected Matter or the Disposition of the Fluids in the Person who receives it so that it would constantly prove of the mildest Kind  Inoculation  would no doubt be a very rational and useful Practice  The Doctor surely will not affirm that a Person  Inoculated  is equally uncertain of the Circumstances mention'd with one who catches the  Small Pox  by the common Way of Infection  First  He may be assur'd if the  Inoculation  takes Place of the Time when  he shall have the  Small Pox Secondly  That he has not the Infection by the insensible Particles which the Doctor owns to be the most contagious or which is near the same Thing convey the Contagion the strongest  Thirdly  He may be as sure as his Operator is careful that he is infected by a favourable Kind And  Fourthly  He may be much more sure of the Disposition of his Fluids than a Person who catches them by Chance after a Surfeit or a Debauch And after all this he may be assur'd if he has not absolute Certainty which I believe one has hardly in Bloodletting that he has a much greater Probability to escape which is sufficient Ground for human Prudence to act upon If the Doctor will deny those Things I think it is Folly to reason upon this Subject any longer And if as the Doctor says Inoculation  may be a more uncertain Method to give the Contagion than that which Nature has pursu'd  it may be notwithstanding that much more safe  Page  The very Choice that is made of a thick purulent Matter to intermix immediately with the Blood seems a little repugnant to our Reason since we know that the Particles have such a different Contexture and such different Powers to Attract  It may proceed from my Ignorance or Dulness but I confess I do not easily apprehend the Meaning of this Sentence Whether  by  the Particles  he means the Particles of purulent Matter or the Particles of Blood or whether the Particles of purulent Matter have different attractive Powers from those of the Blood is not obvious from the Construction of the Sentence I chuse rather to understand him in the last Sense because he has afterwards very sagaciously discover'd  That the blended Particles of Blood with Blood may in all Reason be thought more likely to unite and less liable to raise Commotions  But it happens unluckily in the Case of  Inoculation  the Design is to  raise a Commotion  and the purulent Matter for the Reason mention'd by him is fittest for that Purpose And his Observation that  purging Medicines injected into the Blood will Purge  does not prove that the  Pus  of the  Small Pox  mix'd with the Blood may not raise the  Small Pox  What he says in this Paragraph as likewise in the following concerning the Experiment of the  Mangey Dog  proves that  Pus  is a more proper Vehicle to convey Infection than Blood I cannot find any more in it  Page  It never came into the Heads  of the Practitioners abovemention'd  to raise Distempers by Art in a human Body  Then I will be bold to say it never came into their Heads to practise Physick which consider'd in a true Light is founded upon that single Principle of Curing  Natural  by raising  Artificial Diseases  What is Bleeding but an artificial Haemorrhagy Purging but raising an artificial Diarrhaea Does the Vomiting produc'd by a Surfeit and that procur'd by a Medicine differ so much as that the One must be call'd a Disease and the Other not Are not Blisters Issues and Setons artificial  Imposthumations I hope he has not forgot the of his great Master  Hippocrates  The Wounds and Amputations of Surgeons differ only from accidental Ones by the Manner and Intention  Morbus est ille corporis status qui functiones Animales laedit  And it may be likewise observ'd that Physicians produce those Diseases in their Patients often by Way of Prevention as well as Cure and in this they do nothing but imitate Nature which often attempts the Cure of one Disease by another  Page His next Argument is taken from  the fatal Consequences of this very Matter it self returning into the Blood in the very Height of the  Small Pox  where there seldom is a full and sufficient Discharge by the Skin  c One would imagine that the natural Inference from this would be to the Advantage of  Inoculation  For if there are terrible Symptoms which arise from Want of a sufficient Discharge of the purulent Matter in the  Small Pox    Inoculation  which provides for such a Discharge  by artificial Outlets must needs be useful and seems more proper than the Blisters which the Physicians apply on that Occasion As to the  fatal Consequences arising for Want of a sufficient Discharge upon the Skin  I am affraid the Case is quite different from what the Doctor represents for the more Matter is discharg'd upon the Skin the more is often return'd into the Blood witness the  confluent  Kind of  Small Pox  where the Discharge upon the Skin as well as the Symptoms arising from the Return of the Matter into the Blood are both the greatest And I believe it will be found the less the Discharge upon the Skin the less will be the Danger from these Symptoms The Doctor says  That one may always observe in this artificial Method even where the Distemper is the fairest and most kindly that the Pustules scarce ever plump up to that Degree or contain so laudable a Matter as they do in the natural Sort  Here is an odd Jumble of the Words  always scarce ever  Suppose for  scarce ever  one put  seldom  then the Sentence runs thus  One may always observe the Pustules seldom plump up  c What happens but seldom happens sometimes and to observe  always That  not to happen which happens sometimes is odd or oddly express'd I would be glad to know how many Cases the Doctor has observ'd to frame this so general a Proposition upon  of the contrary of which Hundreds of Persons about this Town who know the Disease perfectly have been EyeWitnesses  Page The Doctor foresees some Inconvenience that must happen from those  viscid Particles  intermixing with the Blood without undergoing the common Alterations of Aliment But they have that in common with the  Volatile  and most  Insensible Particles  But then they are  viscid  and therefore according to the Doctor's Reasoning don't convey the Infection so strong But they  occasion great Disorders  Not so great as the  Insensible  and  Volatile Particles  At last they  break through the Glands of the Skin  If only the small Quantity of purulent Matter that mixes with the Blood break thro' the Pores of the Skin the Eruption indeed would be very small But to cause an Eruption is the very Intention of the Operation the  Small Pox  cannot be produc'd without it And if the Doctor still insists that it is  only like the  Small Pox all I can say is If he had been pleas'd to attend Multitudes of Cases of  Inoculated Persons  here and elsewhere in  England  since this Practice began he must have been convinc'd that the  Eruptions  produc'd by  Inoculation  are the  Genuine Small Pox  If his Arguments so far prevail as to hinder any future  Inoculation  he must for ever continue in his Mistake If the Patient recovers then it was only something  like the  Small Pox  If any one dies then to be sure it was the  Small Pox  catch'd by  Inoculation  and of the worst Sort In this Paragraph it is no  Small Pox  by and by it is a  Small Pox  so bad that it is capable of  spreading the  Small Pox through  a whole City and an artificial Way of depopulating a whole Country  This Way of Arguing is a very plain Proof of the strong Prejudices the Doctor lyes under and that as he has taken up his Opinion early he is resolv'd to defend it obstinately  Page The  Inoculators  are charg'd with  Acting like Empirics  because  they are not ascertain'd of the different Doses for Children and Adults  There does not seem to be any great Matter in this Nicety by Experience as it stands hitherto a small Quantity will communicate the  Small Pox  and a greater has been found not to do hurt in any one Instance If the  Inoculation  is perform'd by Incision the different Apertures will answer that Intention However there is a great Difference between recommending Caution and forbidding the Practice It is still more strange to forbid the Practice 'till that is determin'd which can only be found out by Practice According to this Principle it had been impossible ever to have found out any Thing in Medicine for he that gave the first Dose of a Vomiting or Purging Medicine or of any other could  never be sure of the proper Dose nay farther according to this Doctrine it is impossible to give any Body their first Dose of any Medicine For who can tell what is the proper Dose for any particular Person there being often Singularities in every one's Constitution In all these Matters Mankind generally govern themselves by common Sense and strong Probabilities there being no absolute Certainty in any human Affairs  Page The Doctor returns to his former Point that it is  not the Genuine  Small Pox  and consequently no Security against that Disease  The Matters of Fact I will answer by themselves all I shall say at present is that if the Symptoms of the Ingrafted  Small Pox  are more mild than those of the natural Sort I hope the Doctor will not bring that as an Objection against the Practice I believe the Patient in this Case has just as great Certainty for not having the  Small Pox  again as any other Person who has had them  which is no absolute one  Those who are Infected by any Method I believe are much in the same Condition as to their Security from the Disease for the future for which I will give the Doctor this one plain Proof which is sufficient to establish a moral Certainty This Practice of  Inoculation  has been continu'd for many Years in several Countries if the  Inoculated  had been subject to catch the  Small Pox  a second Time something  of this Kind must have happen'd and a very few Instances of this must have put an End to the whole Practice For can any one imagine that People in their Senses would have continu'd a troublesome Experiment which was not effectual for the Purpose for which it was design'd I will take the Freedom to say that this single Reflection is a stronger Proof of this Point than all the Doctor's Doubts and Suggestions who knows nothing to the contrary as I shall shew by and by May it not at least be adviseable to allow a Truce in the Dispute 'till an uncontested Case of that Kind happens  Page But Innoculation  does not always take Place and produce the Disease  is Therefore the Practice to be left off There are some Persons who by a Speciality of their Constitutions seem hardly susceptible of the Distemper and others who have had the Disease but it has been mistaken or forgot They go farther in  Turky  and affirm that the very running Sores are a Security against the  Small Pox  There may be indeed a strong Presumption that Persons who have had so severe a Tryal as  Inoculation  may not be susceptible of the Distemper Besides there are several Incidents in performing the Operation which may not be carefully attended to if the Patient has not the  Small Pox  there is little Hurt done There are some whom a very strong Dose of Physick  will not purge What then must we never afterwards give a Purge  If the Doctor's Aphorism laid down  Page  That an  Experiment to make it useful always must be nearly uniform  there must be no such Thing as the Practice of Physick unless by the Word  nearly  he allows a very great Latitude  I cannot allow it as a solid Argument against  Inoculation  that the  French  and  Italians  have not begun it no more than that the House of  Bourbon  has never been  Inoculated  Were the Doctor's Letter publish'd in  Italian  too as it is in very elegant  French  both Nations to be sure will be sufficiently frighten'd from ever attempting this Practice And to make the Antidote still more universal let us have it in  Sclavonic  and  HighDutch    Welsh  and  Irish  also  What the Doctor says  Page  of  the Attention that is to be given to the natural Weaknesses of the Constitutions of the Persons  Inoculated is a very proper Caution and perhaps Miscarriages if any such there be may be owing to the Neglect of it But as I hinted before if the least ill Success even in the most innocent Branches of the Practice of Physick arising from Want of Care or Skill should be a perpetual  Bar  to the Repitition of them People must leave off to Purge Vomit Bleed or even to cut Corns of which Operation  several die in a Year within the Bills of Mortality  Page But it is  possible and even probable the Matter of the  Small Pox  may communicate the Diseases of the People from which it is taken  This is hard The Doctor will scarcely allow that the Matter of the  Small Pox  will communicate the  Small Pox  but it is  probable  that it will communicate any other  Disease Que vive  Thomas Diaphoinus  il n'a Jamais ete vaincu en dispute  How are we sure that the Aliment or Drugs both for External and Internal Uses don't communicate the Diseases nay the very natural Qualities of those Animals from which they are taken I think indeed the Election of wholsome Subjects to  Inoculate from  is a proper Caution but the Doctor demands absolute Certainty which cannot be found in any human Affair and less still in any Medical or Chyrurgical Practice Mankind in all those Matters govern themselves by the strongest Probabilities and that these are on the Side of  Inoculation  I shall plainly demonstrate  Page The Doctor's Argument from the  jarring Opinions  of the  Innoculators  if all he says were true is just as strong against the Practice of Physick in General For if no Body was to take any Medicine 'till  Doctors cease to differ  I believe the Faculty would starve May we not with more Truth  affirm that the  Antiinoculators  a Word more sonorous and longer by two Syllables than that of  Inoculators  are as inconsistent and changeable in their Opinions One while they asserted that it was impossible to give the  Small Pox  by this Method when Experience had convinc'd them some of 'em at least of the Untenableness of this Doctrine then they allow'd if it prov'd mortal that it was the  Small Pox  if they escaped to be sure they would have them again If it was a favourable Sort then there was some inveterate Distemper transplanted with it If any Boils or Imposthumations appear'd at the going off of the  Disease  those were the Effect of the  Inoculation  not the Consequence of the  Small Pox  in General or of the Constitution of the Patient These are certainly not the Reasonings of ingenious and inquisitive Philosophers but the Cavils of interested Disputants and it would be ridiculous for any Man to be determin'd by the jarring Opinions either of the one Side or t'other  There is nothing material in the Way of Argumentation 'till we come to  Page  There this  Practice  is condemn'd as it tends to propagate and continue an Infection in any Place Here again it is the  Small Pox  else why should it spread the  Small Pox  I answer if it be true that the Generality of Mankind have the  Small Pox  if they  are rare in some Years they must be rise in others because a new Stock of Subjects susceptible of the Distemper is produc'd and the Operation of this Distemper upon the Mass of Mankind in any particular Place is nearly uniform When this general Run of the  Small Pox  happens I take it to be indifferent to the Mass of the Inhabitants of any Place in general except in this one particular that when the Disease is produc'd by a bad Constitution of Air as it is most Epidemical so it is then most mortal Now if this Distemper should happen to be propagated by an artificial Method in a favourable Season would not this be rather an Advantage to Mankind than otherwise For example The Doctor alledgeth that hardly one of a hundred hath dy'd of the natural Sort this Year would it not then have been highly profitable to Mankind that a general Run of the  Small Pox  had happen'd in so favourable a Season and this would still operate more strongly for the Benefit of Mankind if not only the Season but the Method of Propagation had ten to one of odds of producing a mild Sort So that this Argument of the Doctor's has the Misfortune with a great many of the rest to prove the Contradictory of his Conclusion But without taking the Advantage of the Doctor's hardy Assertion that hardly one of a hundred have dy'd this Year of the  Small Pox  I will examine it a little by Numbers I have not all the Bills of Mortality by me but by a small Specimen the Accompt stands thus  Dy'd of all  Diseases  Dy'd of the  Small Pox                                                                                                                                            By which it appears that the single Branch of Mortality occasion'd by the  Small Pox  is some Years  and in a Circle of twelve Years about of the whole Mortality in general For is near of During this Term of Years  London  wanted an Addition of near People yearly to keep it equally full If all Mankind had the  Small Pox  then People one Year with another had it of which dy'd If  one half of Mankind had the  Small Pox  then out of who had the  Distemper  dy'd of it Which by the way shows the Doctor to be out in his Calculation for if only die this Year as perhaps may appear by the Bills must have been sick of the  Distemper  to make his Assertion true  that one only of a hundred dy'd  If he means it only of Children it is a strong Argument for  Inoculation  because it allows that to be a favourable Age  By the Bills of Mortality of  Breslaw  it appears that the Mass of Mankind lose above  per Cent  before they are a Year old that is of a that are born more than die that first Year I may say with great Probability that not of those have the  Small Pox  at all but die of other  Diseases  and that in the Account as it stands before us of of Infants may be reckon'd neither Subjects of the  Distemper  nor of this Practice but as it were  nonEntities  Therefore out of the People the yearly Recruits of  London  abovemention'd substracting there remains of which yearly there died above of the  Small Pox  that is  So that the  Small Pox  may be reckon'd to cut off  of Mankind above the Age of one Year I wish the World is not malicious enough to say that Physicians like the Clergy are now strugling for their Tenths But to proceed If as I said all Mankind above  a Year old have the  Distemper  I out of dies of it If one half then out of which have the  Distemper  the natural way dies of it If ¼ of Mankind have the  Small Pox  once in their Life then of them out of die If then out of which have the  Distemper  die of it According to D  Nettleton  's Calculation out of who had the natural  Small Pox  in some Neighbouring Towns in  Yorkshire  there died which is about out of a hundred As to the prudential Part of  Inoculation  it is all one whether a greater or lesser Number have the  Small Pox  for the Chance of not dying by the  Small Pox  the natural Way is made up of the Chance of escaping the  Distemper  and that of escaping in the  Distemper  If ½ of Mankind have the  Distemper  it is ½ of ⅕ or  ▪ If  of Mankind have the  Distemper  then it is ¾ ×    or  or  c  Still all Mankind must be consider'd with the Seeds of a Distemper within them which has the Chance of to to cut them off Then surely they don't merit such hard Names of  Homicides and Spreaders of Infection  who do but attempt to lessen the Dread and Danger of this terrible Pestilence  By the Accounts of the  Inoculation in England  and the  Plantations  tho' it is an early Practice and has not been manag'd with due Care and Circumspection out of about on whom it has been perform'd the Enemies  of the Practice have not produc'd the Names of above Persons that have died allowing their Deaths chargeable on this Practice which I believe is not in Fact true A Practice which brings the Mortality of the  Small Pox  from one in ten to one in a hundred if it obtain'd universally would save to the City of  London  at least People yearly and the same Odds wou'd be a sufficient prudential Motive to any private Person to proceed upon abstracting from the more occult and abstruse Causes which seem to favour this Operation It is a self evident Proposition that a Person who receives the Infection by  Inoculation  has a much fairer Chance for his Life than he who takes it the natural Way unless it can be affirmed that the having the Election of all the Circomstances of the Disease is of no manner of Advantage For Example it must be of some Benefit to know that one is to have the Distemper nine or ten Dayes before it comes rather than to be surpris'd or perhaps mistaken in it To have it at an Age when it is not so mortal To take it when the Body is in a temperate and cool State rather than in a contrary one When the Constitution of the Air is favourable rather than malignant After a cool Dyet and other due Preparations rather than after a Surfeit or a drunken Bout For if the principal Strokes towards the Cure are in the Regimen in the  Beginning of a Distemper it must be still more so in a Regimen before it begins If the Doctor will deny these Truths I have done But if the having all the Circumstances abovemention'd in one's Power be of some Advantage then the  Practice of Inoculation  cannot be hurtfull but beneficial to Mankind in general Then why must an Experiment already practis'd with Success in another Country that bids fair to save the Lives of Multitudes be entirely laid aside and crush'd in the Bud Cannot the learned Physicians who so zealously oppose it have a little Patience and Time will clear up many Things in it which perhaps may be now doubtful Therefore since this Practice cannot be hurtful but beneficial to Mankind in general it ought not to be discouraged  As to the Inconsistencies and Mistakes the Doctor is pleas'd to charge me withall I shall always be so ingenuous as to own such as my Inadvertency or Want of Experience have subjected me to What I wrote was according to the best Information or Experience I had at that Time General Propositions in practical Matters are not to be understood in the Strictness of a Logical Universality The Symptoms from which I exempted the Inoculated  Small Pox  are to be understood in a Comparative Sense with regard to those of the natural Sort the Word  usual  will justify this Meaning in  which any Reader not quite Captious will interpret them If with all these Restrictions I cannot be favourably understood I beg Pardon and as I said before I shall be always willing to recant any Mistake But as on the one hand I study to keep myself free from Prejudices so as to be susceptible of any future Conviction which may arise from  Experience  so I wou'd not submit a Point already establish'd to the silly Cavils of those who have none  I am sure I am not mistaken in the Account of the  Inoculation  at  Newgate  but the Doctor is I referr the Reader to my printed  Journal  whereby it appears that the Operation was fairly and equally perform'd on all And I can with great Truth declare that I had no Intention to make any Difference in the Incisions nor was there indeed any made The Doctor not having seen  Evans  the Man who had had the  Small Pox  before till next Day when they were partly heal'd this might occasion his Mistake Nor was the Matter taken from a violent Fluxkind but from a full distinct Coherent kind and at the proper Time Mrs  Tompions  Boil as he call's it on her Arm was not the same from the first Day of the Eruption nor the only one she had But was a fair regular Pustule of the  Small Pox  of which also she had others if he had been pleas'd to examine  Alcock    who had the  GoalDistemper  had also Pustules at least of the  Genuine Small Pox  with a gentle Fever before the Eruption As to all of them having had but few Eruptions I hope that is no Objection against the Practice And as to the Time and Manner of their Pustules going off they were much the same as in the gentler Sort of  Small Pox  Only that  Alcock  opening his with a Pin made them fall off sooner The Doctor might have taken Notice that  Eliz Harrison  who had them as gently at least as any of them has been employ'd since in Nursing above People in the  Small Pox  and never has catch'd them Which any impartial Person will judge to be a better Proof of the Genuinness of the Distemper than all his Observations can evince to the contrary  As to Mr  H  n  's Case it is true But the Inference is only that there was one Person on whom the  Inoculation  did not take place I hope the Doctor has not forgot that he own'd to me that Mr  Colt  's Children had the true  Small Pox  tho' their Case differ'd in nothing from those in  Newgate  but in the Degrees of the Distemper  As to the Experiment in St  Thomas  's  Hospital  after two vastly large Incisions and an immoderate Quantity of the Matter applay'd three Days and Nights Confinement of the Patient to his Bed without opening his Bandage a warm Regimen in a hot Season  I visited him to know the Truth of the Noise that was made on the sixth Day after the Operation and saw no Eruptions nor had he any nor were his Incisions digested I took the Freedom to ask Doctor  Wadsworth  then present whether the Sores pointing at them were like those he saw at  Newgate  And he fairly own'd he cou'd not say they were I again saw this Patient a Week after but still no Eruption If any Eruptions happen'd between these Times they could not be the  Small Pox  And I believe none who saw and attended both Experiments can truly say they were like those in  Newgate  I own that it seem'd probable that the six Persons in Mr  Batt  's Family might have catch'd the  Small Pox  of the Girl that was  Inoculated  but it is well known that the  Small Pox  were rife not only at  Hertford  but in several Villages round it many Months before any Person was  Inoculated  there Witness Mr  Dobb  's House in  Christ's Hospital  Buildings where he himself died of the worst Sort with Purples and his Children had it Some other Families there and particularly Mrs  Moss  's where the abovenamed  Elizabeth Harrison    Inoculated  in  Newgate  attended several Persons under it to prove whether she would catch the Distemper by Infection Both  Latin BoardingSchools  Mr  Stout  's and Mr  Loyd  's Families  Mr  John Dimsdale  's Coachman and his Wise and Mr  Santoon  's MaidServant who was brought to the same House and died of the Confluent kind of the  Small Pox  I took Matter from the said Coachman to  Inoculate  Mr  Batt  's Daughter in the Country Farm House the  first  Ingrafted in that Country After this I took Matter also from Mr  Stout  's MaidServant to  Inoculate  Mrs  Heath  's two Sons which were all I  Inoculated  in that Town Besides all these there were a great many more whose Names I cannot at present call to mind both in Town and Country about it who had the  Small Pox  and several died of it the Summer before I began this Practice These are Matters of Fact which the Doctor's Author cannot disprove To charge then the Spreading the  Infection  and the Consequences of it  that Town upon two single Boys who were  Inoculated  in a Court in a manner separated from all the rest of the Town which was fuller of the  Small Pox  before than after the  Inoculation  is not agreeable to that Ingenuity which the Doctor seems to demand of his Adversaries  The Case of Mr  De Grave  's Daughter which fills up three or four Pages in the Letter and upon which the Doctor lays the Foundation of his  Hypothesis  the Reader may please to take from her Father's own Words in his Letter annex'd From which it appears  that the Girl had the  Small Pox  but once of the favourable kind and in all Probability by  Inoculation  So far the Case is singular that it did not take place till eleven Weeks after the Operation and untill the Blood was put into a Ferment by violent Motion Here the Doctor triumphs in his  Dilemma    Either she had or she had not the  Small Pox  by Inoculation  If the first then it is plain  Inoculation  is no  preventive  of the  Disease  If the second the  Experiment  is good for nothing I think in this way of Argumentation to make it conclusive there ought to be a perfect  Enumeration  but here is a  Third  Case and the real one not enumerated which is that the Girl had the  Small Pox  and that but once by  Inoculation  tho' not at the same Time when the Doctor lays the Scene of his  Dilemma  But to consider the Second Branch allowing that this  Small Pox  was the natural Sort and not produc'd by  Inoculation  of which I think the contrary is plain sure it is a strange Inserence to say that because  Inoculation  has not taken Effect in one Subject it is therefore good for nothing The Doctor's excellent Judgment will instruct him to reason with more Temper and Solidity in other Matters of his Profession and not make Use of his  Aphorism    That one Instance  is as good as a thousand in Matters of Experience What the Doctor says of his  Fears of a great Class of Hypothetical Diseases is all vanish'd and the Girl is very well I refer the Doctor upon this Head of the Preventive Power of  Inoculation  to the Letter which he lays so much Stress upon from  Boston  where his Ally in this Dispute owns  That not one of the  Inoculated being about three Hundred  during the Space of five or six Months  in a general Run of the  Small Pox    has had the  Small Pox  the natural Way as far as we know  But of this more afterwards  As for his second Story of Captain  Hussart  it requires only a bare Reading to make it ridiculous For no unprejudic'd Person of common Sense can believe that one after having been  Inoculated  twice without any Effect would try it a third Time But after a third Time to try it a fourth fifth and sixth Time passeth all Degrees of Credibility But it seems this Captain was not very certain whether it was five or six Times one  Inoculation  had quite slipt out of his Memory he wanted one Quality which the Proverb demands in some Sort of People Since the Doctor can give Credit to this Story of Captain  and at the same Time question the  what is said by eminent Physicians who  from their own and other Peoples Observations on the Spot where  Inoculation  is practis'd daily I appeal to my Readers if I may not with Justice tax him of being partially  Credulous  or  Incredulous  as Facts make for or against his Purpose And with all due Respect to the Senate of  Boston  I question whether a Bill or an  Hypothesis  founded upon such a Fact is more extraordinary But allowing it to be true what is the Inference That a Person who could not catch the  Small Pox  by  Inoculation  had them the natural Way If that were granted will it prove that one who has the  Small Pox  by  Inoculation  may afterwards have them the natural Way If upon the same Authority the Doctor can believe the Story of the  Muscovite  Dragoon or the  Inoculated  Soldiers in the  French  Army I wish him much Joy I promise him I will not like the Gentry who went in quest of St  Alban  's Trough ride twenty Miles to be able to disprove it I should be glad to know which Way the Doctor supports so bold an Assertion  That  Page  by the Account Dr  Nettleton  gives as also by the best Observation upon those who have been  Inoculated  in this City scarcely a fourth Part of them have had a true and genuine  Small Pox I have read over carefully Dr  Nettleton  's Account contain'd in his Letters printed in the  Transactions  of the  Royal Society  N  o  and for my Life I cannot find any Thing to justify this Assertion on the contrary he says  We have not yet found that ever any had the Distemper twice neither is there any Reason to suppose it possible there being no Difference  that can be observ'd betwixt the natural and artificial Sort if we may be allow'd to call them so but only that in the latter the Pustules are commonly fewer in Number and all the rest of the Symptoms are in the same Proportion more favourable  I hope there is at least as much Credit due to an ingenious Practitioner who writes from a very extended Experience as to one who writes for the most Part by Hearsay  As to those who have been  Inoculated  in  London  to oppose my own and other Persons Testimony from ocular Inspection against his who talks by Report may seem perhaps too great Presumption I therefore challenge the Doctor to name the Cases and Authorities whereby he supports such a wild Assertion  As to Mr  Sp  r  's Case I will not preoccupy my Reader with any Reflection but refer him to the Matter of Fact here subjoin'd as it is testify'd by the Surgeon and Apothecaries that attended him  As to the Case of Lord  B  ts  's Servant I refer to the Account subjoin'd  He is just as much misinform'd of the Case of Lord  F  s  's Son who had a favourable Sort of  Small Pox  and was in no Danger of his Life as the Physician who attended him will readily own  As to the unfortunate Accidents which have happen'd to some of the First Rank by  this  Ingrafting Method  if I guess right who he means one of them is perfectly well without any unfortunate Accident and the Imposthumation which had no Dependance nor Communication with the Incision is perfectly cur'd without any Exfoliation of the Bone or any  Hectic Fever  But it is hard to charge the common Accidents of the  Small Pox  in general upon this Method in particular  It is no less a Misinformation that the Children of a Nobleman understood in his Letter were  Ingrafted  from a bad Sort of  Small Pox  As to what he says of the poorer Sort of  People of  Scotland  running about with the  Small Pox  upon them without either Shoes or Stockings  the Doctor seems here to intend a Reflection but I choose to avoid all Reflections either National or Domestick I believe the People of  England  as well as those of  Scotland  for the most Part neither wear  Shoes  nor  Stockings  in the  Small Pox  As to their Custom or Ability of  running about  they are much in the same Condition as they are here some have them favourably some otherwise and every one has Conveniencies and Helps according to their Circumstances  As for the three Letters from  Boston  in  New England  printed by Way of  Appendix  to the Doctor's It might suffice to say that they are only a severe and perhaps a just Invective  against the Clergy and others for meddling in this Branch of the Physicians Practice Upon which Encroachment some of the Faculty invoke the Vengeance of the Civil Magistrate and threaten the Offenders as  Poisoners  and  Spreaders of Infection  with Prisons and Gibbet's And if the Laws in being are somewhat deficient modestly call as some others have done upon the Legislature for new Ones This general Consideration is sufficient to invalidate the Credit of any Thing that is said by a Person so strongly interested But so great is the Force of Truth that it has extorted enough from this partial Complainant to justify the Practice which he so bitterly inveighs against For first he owns that the whole Practice of  Inoculation  was manag'd by unskillful Persons and that many  who dy'd or suffer'd much under  Inoculation  if they had had better Management might have had better Fate  That the Practitioners neglected  as trivial both the Advantages of a suitable Season and a well prepared Body That they  Inoculated  all Ages and Constitutions from the Beginning That they  Inoculated  Women with Child and Hysterical people  And after all  They practis'd it at first with indifferent good Success That it had been practis'd since the Middle of  June  to the Date of his Letter  Dec  upon above two hundred Subjects with various Succcess  He tells you in his second Letter  That they had at that Time the Experience of two or three Hundred  Inoculated And after all this in all his three Letters he gives you only two Letters of the Name of one  Inoculated  Person who dy'd Mrs  D  l  He says at Random  that others dy'd of it whom Time may bring to Light  Were the Bodies of those  Inoculated  Persons hid under Dunghills Had they not Christian Burial It is wondrous strange that in a Place where the Practitioners in Physick and the Magistrates both were against  Inoculation  he could not come at the Knowledge of a Mortal Case but one the  Inoculated  Mrs  D  l  who is trump'd up upon all Occasions He says  many of the  Inoculated  suffer much  Page What then A Person that has the  Small Pox  even in the gentlest Sort must suffer And at last Page he ingenuously acknowledges  That the  Small Pox acquir'd by  Inoculation    is frequently more favourable than in the common Way and not altogether so mortal  Secondly  That not one of the  Inoculated  during the Space of five or six Months has had the  Small Pox  in the natural Way so far as we know  that is of about three hundred People  Inoculated  some of which no doubt had only those Eruptions which they will not allow to be the genuine  Small Pox  In a Time when the  whole Town and Country was an Hospital of People sick  of the Distemper and few Persons exempt from its Rage for the Space of five or six Months  not so much as one had the  Small Pox  for  ought they knew  I say if such a Case had happen'd it is not probable it could have been conceal'd and that this Acknowledgment from one who is so zealous an Enemy to the Practice is a stronger Proof of the Efficacy of it for the Purpose intended than all the  Ifs  and  Maybe's  of this or any other LetterWriter  It had been fair in this Gentleman to have given in the Numbers that dy'd of the natural Sort of  Small Pox  during that Season or to have stated the Case fairly between two or three Hundred sick of the natural Sort and as many of the  Inoculated  Kind both under the Care and Direction of unskillful and unexperienc'd People And then perhaps as in the  Inoculated  Kind he could instance by Name only One that dy'd In the other Sort he would have been puzzled to find the Names of those who escap'd  But to this he will say that the  Inoculated Small Pox  propagated the Mortality of the natural Sort There is a full Answer given to this Objection of spreading Infection before I think it is hard to exclude Men from the Means of securing themselves from a great Pestilence upon a meer Suggestion The Influence of the natural  Small Pox  upon Mankind in any Place in a Circle of  Years may be affirm'd to be uniform with strong Probability and if the Air of any Place in a contagious  Season  is such as renders the Distemper very mortal it is a strong Motive for People to take the Advantage of a good Season and secure themselves in Time from a Plague which is so likely to destroy them And if Prudence only were to be consulted it would perhaps be much more the Duty of the Legislature to order than to forbid this Practice And no doubt according to the Acknowledgment of the Enemies of this Practice they would by this Method diminish the Mortality and encrease the Number of their People and the Magistrate is forc'd often upon more arbitrary Proceedings in any Pestilence But as that would seem too great an Encroachment upon the natural Rights of Mankind I should not approve of it But on the other Hand it would be a most Tyrannical Encroachment upon the same Rights to debar Mankind from the lawful Means of securing themselves from the Fear and Danger of so terrible a Plague  As for the particular  Faetor  that according to the Letter  attends the Sores of the Inoculated  it is much of a Piece with the Story of the  Kentish Long Tayls  It shews him to be an utter Stranger to the whole Practice and makes one doubt whether he ever saw a Case of  Inoculation  quite through And the  Pointing at the  Inoculated  in the  Streets  is as great an Instance of Barbarity as the other is of Ignorance  There is a Letter in Town from the Revd Mr  Mather  at  Boston  of a later Date which has several remarkable Passages in it  The Distemper  meaning the Small Pox  has lately visited and ransacked the City of  Boston  and in little more than half a Year of about five thousand Persons that have undergone it near nine hundred have died  But how many Lives might have been sav'd if our unhappy Physicians had not poison'd and bewitch'd our People with a blind Rage that has appear'd very like a Satanick Possession against the Method of Relief and Safety in the way of the  Small Pox  Inoculated I prevail'd with one Physician and for it I have had bloody Attempts made upon my Life by some of our Energumens to introduce the Practice and the Experiment has been made upon almost three hundred Subjects in our Neighbourhood young and old from one Year to seventy weak and strong Male and Female white and black in Midsummer in Autumn and Winter And it succeeds to Admiration  I cannot learn that any one has died of it tho' the Experiment has been made under various and marvellous Disadvantages Five or six have died upon it or after it but from other Accidents  He mentions afterward  that Cats had it    and takes notice of the same thing in Doctor  Leigh's  History of  Lancashire  and subjoins    That  it was generally complain'd that Pigeonhouses of the City continu'd unfruitful and the Pigeons did not lay or hatch as they us'd to do all the while that the  Small Pox  was in its Epidemical Progress And it is very strongly affirmed that our Dunghill Fowl felt much of the like upon them  At last concludes  with the great Benefit they have found by Blisters early apply'd and continu'd in the natural  Small Pox  and is sorry it was so late before they fell into this Way but it has constantly prosper'd I know not says he that it has once miscarried since we came into it  I refer the Reader to his Letter annex'd  It appears by this Letter that somewhat more than one out of five and less than one out of six died of the Distemper And likewise by the Effects mention'd upon Animals that the general Contagion was owing to a bad Disposition of the Air and not chargeable upon  Inoculation  And lastly notwithstanding the unfavourable Constitution of the Air the  Inoculated  did well  I doubt not but the impartial Reader is now satisfy'd that this Practice of  Inoculation  may be still beneficial to Mankind notwithstanding any thing that the Doctor has  adduc'd to the contrary either by way of Argument or Fact And that by the same zealous Partiality it had been easy to have crush'd any the most useful Practice in Medicine in the Beginning It is pretty remarkable that in a Neighbouring Nation where Agues are the best Branch of the Physicians Practice the Use of the Bark has been and is still in a great Measure suppress'd by Methods not much unlike what are us'd against  Inoculation  and indeed every one of the Doctor's Arguments would have concluded more strongly against the Use of the  Cortex  than against this Practice I will suppose any Stickler against the Bark to have reason'd thus in the Doctor's Strain  A Drug that has been only us'd among Slaves an illiterate unthinking People who have the Advantage of a warm Climate and a Spare Dyet is not fit to be immediately dispens'd to the  English  whose Blood speaking of it as National is the Product of the Richest Dyet Is it not plain by the Diseases that it often leaves behind it that it spoils the Constitution Witness the Jaundice Tumours of the Legs and other Cachexies that are often subsequent upon it Besides none but Empirics can give a Medicine of which they are not sure of the Dose Is it not plain that it will not answer the Design of preventing the Disease for the future For notwithstanding the Use of this Drug the Patient suffers many a Relapse Besides  there are not only one or two but innumerable Instances of People who have died after the Use of it and others who have had a diseased Constitution all the rest of their Lives The Dispensers of this Medicine disagree widely among themselves both as to the Manner of its Operation and the Dose Some give it in Tincture some in Substance some in greater some in lesser Quantities c In fine there are three Letters from a Friend in  New England  which inform me that many who have taken the Bark have suffer'd very much and Mrs  D  l  who had taken great Quantities of it actually died c Tho' I have not my self made Use of this Medicine nor seen much of the Effects of it I am well assur'd that not a fourth part of the Diseases it pretends to cure are Genuine Agues Before I had seen the Practice of this Medicine I affirmed that is was impossible it would cure an Ague but I am willing to retract that Opinion being convinc'd by an Experiment that it does so sometimes  It were easy to carry this Parallel reasoning thro' the whole Letter not only with equal but more Strength in most Places  The Doctor in appearing with so great Zeal against this Practice is not the Representative of the whole Faculty For there are many of them who from their Disinterestedness and Innate Love to Mankind are willing that an Experiment should go on  which in Proportion to the Extensiveness of the Practice must necessarily diminish the Mortality of the  Small Pox  in general This is a candid as well as decent Way of proceeding At the same Time I only blame the Author of the Letter and those who take part with him for their too early and strong Prejudices being unwilling to Censure their Intentions which I hope are for the Good of Mankind as well as my own  But there is still a stronger  Dr  Massey's Sermon  Page  Objection against this Practice  That it is unlawful and first introduc'd by the Devil who Ingrafted  Job  of the Confluent Sort of  Small Pox  From useful Discoveries there can always be drawn important Consequences  First  Hence learn we that the  Small Pox  is an ancient Disease for if it was convey'd to Job  by some such Way as  Inoculation the Matter must have been taken from some Body Infected with the Distemper  Secondly  That  Sydenham  was not the first that began the  cool Regimen  for  Job  fat down upon the Ashes in the open Air  his Friends saw him afar off Thirdly  That his Friends were tardy above three Weeks before they came to see him for in the Genuine Confluent Kind of  Small Pox  it will be that Time before they can bear scraping with a Potsherd  Fourthly  Beloved this confluent Sort of  Small Pox  were more gentle to be sure than the common natural Ones for he seems neither to have had Delirium sore Throat nor Shortness of Breath he talk'd distinctly and good Sense  Now here a Question ariseth Whether an honest Man can do that which the Devil has done I answer in the Affirmative there are three things mention'd of the Devil's Assembling himself as in this Place with the Sons of God Believing and Quoting of Scripture All these Things a good Man may not only do but is bound to do  I readily agree with this Reverend Divine that if  Inoculating  the  Small Pox  be an unlawful Action it cannot be justify'd by the Good which may ensue from it but that it is unlawful must be prov'd either by some natural or positive Law That this Reverend Gentleman has brought no such Proof either from natural or reveal'd Religion will appear plain upon a very short Review of his Discourse  Page He says he will attempt to prove  That Diseases are utterly unlawful to be inflicted by any who profess themselves Christians  He terms it very right for it is an Attempt to Prove and no more By restraining the Prohibition to Christians one would think there was some positive Command in the Gospel against it but he has brought none which  by the most forc'd Construction can prove  Inoculation  to be prohibited by the Christian Dispensation I know of no Immorality that is forbid to a Christian the Practice of which is allow'd to an Infidel Indeed Morality is more clearly taught and more strongly enforc'd by Rewards and Punishments amongst us but it does not change its Nature amongst the rest of Mankind He does not wonder that the Practice of  Inoculation  should obtain where the Doctrine of  Fatality  is believ'd but the Misfortune is that the Matter of Fact is quite otherwise For if he had carefully perus'd Dr  Wagstaffe  's Discourse which he so much commends that would have inform'd him  That no Body pretends to give us an Instance of an  Inoculated Turk And why Because their Belief of a Fatality makes them neglect very much the ordinary Helps of Medicine for preserving their Lives  Page The Instances which he gives of Almighty God's having given a miraculous Power to Mankind to inflict Diseases for their Punishment does not prove that He has not given them an ordinary one for their Benefit  And his saying Pag  That no Man was ever yet condemn'd to an immediate Sickness for Want of sufficient Authority  is without any Proof Diseases are External and In  the Magistrate very often inflicts both That Criminals are lawfully punish'd with the  Mutilation of their Body I suppose he will allow to be common Is not that inflicting a Disease with a Witness And are there not many Executions perform'd by Poison which is inflicting an Internal mortal Disease And here his own Argument turns upon him for  if Diseases are sent for the Punishment of our Sins  then it would seem to follow that the Magistrate who has a Power from God to punish our Crimes has likewise a Power to inflict Diseases  for Sins that are manifest to him and all the World  The greater Power of inflicting Death certainly includes the lesser in the Choice of the Means If for Example there should be a Law made to punish the  Inoculators  with the  Inoculation  of some Disease I fancy this Reverend Divine would not think it sinful or unreasonable  Page He spends a long Paragraph to prove what no Body ever deny'd That a Man cannot lawfully do all that is in his Power to do And another as evident That the Means as well as the Intention must be lawful but these are only general Propositions The Subsumption that inflicting Diseases for a good Purpose is unlawful is only suppos'd not prov'd  Page He  doubts whether the Life of Man be a Good or not  If the Life of Man is no Good then indeed to act for the Preservation of it is not to act for any good End and consequently not only this Practice  but all others in Medicine and many other charitable Actions must be given up The rest of the Argument of this Paragraph is grounded upon the Insufficiency of this Method for the Purpose intended The Doctor might have remember'd from his Exposition of his Text  Job  had the  Small Pox  by  Inoculation  from the Devil even of a favourable Sort that he recover'd of them and never had them again But in this he must forgive me if I put him in Mind that he is out of his Sphere and that notwithstanding his Professions to the contrary he lays aside the Divine and takes upon him the Physician The Question here is Whether giving a Disease with a good Intention be in it self an unlawful Action  Page Another Argument is  That a Law which forbids the Evil forbids also every thing that has a Tendency to it therefore all causeless and voluntary Mutilations are forbid  And yet notwithstanding this Law against Mutilation more express than any against  Inoculation  Surgeons cut off Peoples Limbs Here the Intention hallows the Action which is in itself expresly forbid and which is more I believe no Surgeon will affirm that in all Cases where Limbs are cut off there is a direct Impossibility to save the Patient's Life otherwise or that the Operation is always successful A Surgeon who cuts a Person for the  Stone  even if his Patient dies of the Operation  does not think he has committed a mortal Sin in inflicting a mortal Disease and yet the Patient perhaps might have liv'd many Years and not dy'd of the Distemper at last The Difference of the two Cases the one being for Cure the other for Prevention does not change the State of the Question which in general Terms is this Whether Mankind have a Lawful Power of inflicting Diseases for good Purposes A Person who has not had the  Small Pox  may be very justly consider'd as having the Seeds of a mortal Distemper within him and the Dread of it is surely a Suffering that will justify the Lawfulness of using Means which have the greatest Probability of saving him from a Danger which for ought he knows may be nearer and greater than that of a Stone in the Bladder Anxiety and Bodily Pain don't differ so much as to make an Action lawful in one Case sinful in the other  Page But it seems  it is a Tempting of Providence  And there is no great Difference between the  Devil's Proposal to our Saviour to cast himself down headlong and that of  Inoculation It is wonderful into what Absurdities Zeal for an Opinion will drive a Man even to assert that there is no Difference between a Man's running into a Danger absolutely unnecessary and from which nothing but a direct Miracle can save him and a Venturing on a small Hazard to  avoid a much greater The Case put it as disadvantagiously as possible more resembles that of a Person who leaps out of a Window for fear of Fire and surely that can never be reckon'd a Mistrust of Providence even if he did it before he was much in Danger for no body can say that God Almighty may not save a Man from Fire in the ordinary Course of his Providence And if a Person who being prompted by his too early Fears had taken this Course and lost his Life by the Fall no body will arraign him of  Selfmurder  He might have done an imprudent but not a sinful Action The Parents who suffer their Children to converse with their infected Relations which differs in no Moral Point from the Case of  Inoculation  would think it very hard to be treated as Homicides or Murderers of their Children when the very Action proceeds from the contrary Principle extreme Tenderness  Pag In the former Page it was a presumptuous Trust in this it is an intire Mistrust of Providence He is sure to have the  Inoculators  some way or other  Pag They cannot pray for a Blessing upon their Endeavours because Prayer supposes the Use of lawful Means  I believe the contrary is true for as a Person who is  Inoculated  puts himself more immediately into the Hands of God if he has any Sense of Religion cannot avoid  praying for a Blessing upon the Means which to be sure he thinks lawful and has not yet been prov'd to be otherwise  Page His Argument to prove that  Inoculation  tends to promote Vice and Immortality is the most extraordinary of all This it does by taking off the Dread of the  Small Pox  and consequently the Restraints of Sobriety that Mankind lie under upon that Account This Reverend Gentleman has very justly found fault with one Maxim to  do Evil that Good may come of it  But he has establish'd one just as dangerous in the room of it  not to do Good least Evil come of it  For if the Diminishing the Fear of Dying of Diseases catch'd by Irregularity is an Evil then an able Physician is a common Nuisance We have reason to be thankful that there are a sufficient Number left who cannot be charg'd with being Encouragers of Vice and Immorality upon this Score This Principle in its full Extent would destroy all Works of Charity and Mercy for the Hope of Forgiveness is an Encouragment to do Injuries and the Hope of being reliev'd in Want is a Discouragement to Industry  I am touch'd with the devout Reflections upon Providence that are all along spread thro' his Sermon to which I subscribe with all my Heart but I cannot so much commend the Distorting those great and solemn  Truths of our Holy Religion to mantain little Party Interests and fashionable Opinions The Text that is quoted Pag that the very Hairs of our Head are numbred I take to be a stronger Argument against Periwigs and Shaving than all that the Sermon contains against  Inoculation  Our Hairs of our Beards were given us for an Ornament by Providence and it is known that many have catch'd great Colds with mortal DisEases ensuing upon them by Shaving Is not a Man answerable for all the bad Effects that follow upon an unwarrantable Action that contradicts the very Intention of Providence  The Peroration Page is equal to any Piece of the whole Performance  Let the Atheist and the Scoffer the Heathen and the Unbeliever disclaim a Dependance upon Providence Let them  Inoculate  and be  Inoculated  c  I think this clinches the whole Matter and this Reverend Gentleman has furnish'd us with a new sensible and religious Test an Atheist or Infidel can be found out as a Witch by the Marks upon his Body And that as it has been intimated already that the Devil was the first  Inoculator  I think it is not impossible that the next zealous Preacher upon this Subject may prove the Cicatrices of  Inoculation  to be the Mark of the Beast Thus it appears that the Doctors Position of the Unlawfulness of inflicting Diseases for good Purposes is groundless and contrary to the common Usages of Mankind  I have been oblig'd to be the more particular in answering this  Sermon  because the Charge in it against the  Inoculators  is hea  than that in the Letter in as much as immorality is a greater Fault than bad Practice in Physick  From all that I have said I will draw this one Conclusion that there does not appear as yet any Objection of Weight enough to stop the Progress of the Practice of  Inoculation  But if upon future Trials it should be found that the Inconveniencies do overballance the Advantages of it I shall then be as ready to condemn as I am now to justify it  Certificate of the Honourable Mr WILLIAM SPENCER's DEATH  April  UPON Examining the Body of the Honourable  William Spencer  Son of the Right Honourable the late Earl of  Sunderland  We found the  Small Pox  of a mix'd Sort distinct in some Parts and confluent in others almost dry'd and seal'd throughout the Body All the Inward Parts were in their natural State and free from any Mark of the  Small Pox  In the Right Ventricle  of the  Heart  there were two  Polipus's  whereof of one was branch'd out into the  Arteria Pulmonalis  In the Head we found the Surface of the Brain full of Water and the Substance of it flabby the Ventricles of it being as full of Water as they could hold The  Plexus Choroides  being white by soaking in that Water The  Basis  of the  Brain  was also full of Water In the  Longitudinal Sinus  there was a long and pretty large  Polypus  and likewise one in the  Lateral Sinus  The  Cerebellum  was in its natural State  Apr  Sign'd thus  Claudius Amyand  Isaac Garnier  Apothecar  Thomas Garnier  Apothecar  John Reilliez  John Dolignon  N B  The Child

Claudius Amyand  Isaac Garnier  Apothecar  Thomas Garnier  Apothecar  The CASE of Mr DEGRAVE'S Daughter in a LETTER to Mr MAITLAND  SIR  I Find my Daughter's Case has made some Noise in Town and has been misrepresented It was thus She was  Inoculated  the d of  Febr  and as I saw her daily during the three Weeks that she was confin'd after the  Inoculation  so I can affirm no  Small Pox  ever appear'd uponher during that Time but only Heats and Flushings attended sometimes with Heaviness and Pain in her Head and a little more Quickness of Pulse than usual and oftentimes without any Disorder at all None of those Heats and Flushings ever came to Perfection or to any thing like the  Small Pox  which gave my Daughter some Uneasiness and the rather that the other Persons who had been  Inoculated  at the same Time and in the same House with her had a very fair distinct  Small Pox  and yet had less Sickness than She Nor did the Incisions in her Arms discharge so much and so long as theirs did and therefore were compleatly heal'd in less than three Weeks  Time when the Sores of the other Person were yet large and running Thus all Expectation of her having the  Small Pox  by the  Inoculation  being over she was purg'd once or twice and then discharg'd from her Confinement the th of  March  following Nay it was believ'd she never would have that Distemper for having been very much expos'd to the Infection when the was but two Years of Age and yet more when the was about Eight without contracting it this last Tryal being unsuccessful seem'd to give a tolerable Ground for this Opinion However my Daughter continu'd discompos'd and out of Order when the came Home the Heats and Flushings abovemention'd still subsisting on her though in a lesser Degree her Stomach loathing Fleshmeats and her Rest disturb'd with Dreams and Horrors She had likewise two small Boils one under her Arm and another on her Side But none of these Accidents were troublesome enough to hinder her Attendance on her accustom'd Business within and without the House However these continuing for about two Months after she came Home the was purg'd once or twice in order to remove them but still they subsisted upon her not to any Degree 'till the  Small Pox  broke out upon her which happen'd in this Manner Three Days before she had heated herself extraordinarily the first by going to the  Camp  and back again  on Foot in a very warm Day the second by walking heartily to the  CharterHouse  to see her Brother and returning Home and the third Day in going and sitting at the  PlayHouse  in  LincolnsInnFields  As she sat at this last Place the  Small Pox  broke out upon her at least I never perceiv'd it upon her 'till her Return at which my Daughter was surpriz'd she having had no Illness whatever that could hinder her Pleasure at the Play and her walking Home or any such precursory Warnings of that Distemper which I hear have been divulg'd Abroad As soon as the  Small Pox  had appear'd she recover'd her Stomach for those Fleshmeats she had loath'd before and came to that natural compos'd Sleep of which she had been depriv'd since the  Inoculation  And she having gone through the most favourable Periods of that Distemper she got well in Eight Days from That I perceiv'd the first Eruption so that I must conclude from the Symptoms which my Daughter was by Times afflicted with during Eleven Weeks after she had been  Inoculated  that it appears evident to me the  Small Pox  she had then was the Effect of the  Inoculation  although it has shew'd itself much later than is usual after that Operation As to the  Itch  that appear'd upon her about the same Time with the  Small Pox  I can only account for it thus She had been Infected by her Brother about  three Months before she was  Inoculated  and I thonght her cur'd of it by the same Means that were Efficacious for the Cure of her Brother It is certain that when she was there was no Appearance subsisting of that Distemper nor any Shew of it 'till that Time the  Small Pox  appear'd upon her However she is perfectly cur'd of the  Itch  by the same Means that were us'd at first And I thank God my Daughter is at present as well if not better in every Respect than ever she was in her Life  I am SIR Your most humble Servant ISAAC DEGRAVE  August  A Letter from Dr NETTLETON at  Halifax  in  Yorkshire  to Dr JURIN RSSecr  SIR  IN Answer to what you require from me as to what has been farther done I have only to add that since I writ to Dr  Whitaker  I have made the  Insition  upon about fifteen Persons who have all had the Distemper very favourably and got thro' it with a  great deal of Ease As nothing uncommon or extraordinary did happen in any of these Cases it will not be necessary to trouble you with a particular Account of any of them They were most of them at some Distance the  Small Pox  being in a great Measure gone from this Town and Neighbourhood  I am very sensible of the Favour done me by the Royal Society who were pleased to take Notice of my Letter to Dr  Whitaker  which you had nothing to move you to besides a generous Disposition to encourage the smallest Attempts towards any thing that may tend to publick Advantage I must own that all the Information I had concerning this Affair which I have happen'd to be engaged in was entirely from the  Philosophical Transactions  'Tis now about six Years since the Royal Society did communicate to the World some Letters from two very considerable Physicians residing in  Turky  whose good Sense or Integrity we had no reason to call in question these Gentlemen did solemnly assure us that the Method of  Inoculation  had been for many Years practis'd in those Parts of the World with almost constant Success I had as well as all others who have been engaged in the Practice with sufficient Sorrow and Concern been called to many in the  Small Pox  whose Cases were so deplorable as to admit of no Relief And therefore I could not but be very thoughtful  about this Method which promised to carry Persons thro' that cruel Distemper with so much Ease and Safety I was so far from knowing that it was a Crime that I always thought it the Duty of our Profession to do what we could to preserve the Lives of those who commit themselves to our Care And I know no Reason why we ought not with all humble Thankfulness to Almighty God to make Use of any Means which his good Providence shall bring to Light conducing to that End This Matter tho' of so great Importance lying dormant so long after it was known is I presume a sufficient Proof that none have been very forward to try Experiments But when we had the Account in the publick Papers that it had by their  RoyalHighness  's Command been done with Success at  London  I could not be satisfy'd without trying it here I was soon convinced that it would be of very great Use and the more Experience I have had of it since the more I am confirm'd in the same Opinion I believe all others who have seen any thing of this Practice are in the same Sentiment and there is no doubt but in a few Years the World will acknowledge the Service which the Royal Society have done to Mankind in first revealing to this Part of  Europe  a Thing so beneficial as it will certainly prove for tho' some few unfortunate Accidents may sometimes happen yet these will be very rare  in comparison of the many sad and disastrous Events which this Distemper has been and ever will be very fruitful of while it is left to rage in its full Force and Violence  Sir  I doubt not but when you Love collected a sufficient number of Observations for it you will be able to demonstrate that the Hazard in this Method is very inconsiderable in proportion to that in the ordinary way by accidental Contagion so small that it ought not to deter any body from making use of it In order to satisfy my self what Proportion the Number of those that die of the  Small Pox  might bear to the whole Number that is seized with the Distemper in the Natural way I have made some Enquiry hereabouts and I shall take the Freedom to transmit the Accounts to you because I believe you may depend upon their being taken with sufficient Care and Impartiality In  Halifax  since the Beginning of last Winter have had the  Small Pox  and out of that Number have died In  Rochdale  a small Neighbouring Market Town have had the Distemper and have died In  Leeds  have had the  Small Pox  and have died It is to be noted that in this Town the  Small Pox  have been more favourable this Season than usual and in  Leeds  they have been more than usually mortal but upon a  Medium  in these three Towns there have died nearly out of every hundred which is above a  fifth  Part  of all that have been infected in the natural way I have in these Accounts confin'd my self to the Limits of the Towns The Numbers that have had the  Small Pox  in the Country round about is vastly greater but the Proportion of those that die is much the same I have made the Enquiry in several Country Villages hereabouts in some I found the Proportion to be greater in others less but in the main it is nearly the same  I am  c  THOMAS NETTLETON  Halifax    June  Mr MATHERS Letter from  Boston  in  New England  March  th    SIR  SO considerable a Part of Mankind fearfully perishing by the  Small Pox  and many more of us grievously suffering by that miserable Distemper you will allow me to entertain you with a few more Communications and writ I think it's a fourth Letter upon it  The  Distemper  has lately visited and ransack'd the City of  Boston  and in little more than half a Year of more then five thousand Persons that have undergone it near nine hundred have died But how many Lives might have been saved if our unhappy  Physicians  had not  poison'd and bewitch'd  our People with a  blind Rage  that has appear'd very like a  Satanick Possession  against the Method of Relief and Safety in the way of the  Small Pox  Inoculated  I prevail'd with one Physician and for it I have had bloody Attempts made upon  my Life  by some of our  Energumens  to introduce the Practice and the Experiment has been made upon almost three hundred Objects in our Neighbourhoud Young and Old from one Year to seventy weak and strong Male and Female White and Black in Midsummer in Autumn in Winter and it succeeds to Admiration  I cannot learn that any one has died of it tho' the Experiment has been made under various and marvellous Disadvantages Five or six have died upon it or after it but from other Diseases or Accidents chiefly from having taken the Infection in the common way by Inspiration before it could be given them in this way of  Transplantation  However at present I need say no more of this having already given you some Report of our Proceedings in it  To them who are under the  Inoculation  of the  Small Pox  we commonly give a  Vomit  in the time of their  Decumbiture  a Day or two before the expected Eruption One of our Patients not vomiting so freely as he would have done thrust a Finger or two into his Throat which fetch'd up what was to be discharg'd from his uneasy Stomach He had but a few of the  Small Pox  and the Pustules were sufficiently of the  distinct Sort  as it uses to be where they have the  Small Pox Inoculated  but the Fingers that had been thus employ'd prov'd as full as they could hold of the  confluet Sort  which he now thought his whole Body would have been if we had not in this Way prevented it  Doctor  Leigh  in his  Natural History  of  Lancashire  counts it an Occurrence worth relating that there were some Catts known to catch the  Small Pox  and pass regularly thro' the State of it and then to die We have had among us the very same Occurrence  It was generally observ'd and complain'd that the Pigeon  Houses  of the City continu'd  and the  Pigeons  did not  hatch  or  lay  as they used to do all the while that the  Small Pox  was in its Epidemical Progress And it is very strongly affirm'd that our Dunghil Fowl felt much of the like Effect upon them  We have so many among us who have been visited with the  Plague  in other Countries many Years ago and who have never been arrested with the  Small Pox  after it tho' they have been exposed as much as any other People to it that it now begins to obtain a Belief with us that they who have had the  Plague  will never have the  Small Pox  after it  I will add but one Thing more For Succour under the  Small Pox  where Life is in Danger after all the Methods and Medicines that our  Sydenham  and others rely upon I can assure you we have yet found nothing so sure as this Procure for the Patient as early as may be by  Epispastiks  a plentiful Discharge at the  Handwrits  or Ancles or both I say as early as my be and keep them running till the Danger is over When the Venom of the  Small Pox  makes an evident or violent Invasion on the Nobler Parts this Discharge  does wonderfully  I am sorry it was so late before we fell into this Way but it has  constantly prosper'd  I know not that it has once miscarried since we came into it  March  My Lord  B  st  's Servants Case by one that constantly attended him  MY Lord  B  st's  Six Children were  Inoculated  the  th April  Five of them had got thro' the  Small Pox  before the  th  when his Servant was  Inoculated  He came from  Cirencester  to My Lord's House in  London  about the Time that his Children had the  Small Pox  on them with an Intent to be Inoculated but Matter could not be found so soon as desired and the Fellow in the mean time liv'd among the Servants that attended on My Lord's Children Whether he had contracted any Infection by that Commerce is not determin'd or whether the Disorder he had on him three or four Days before he was Inoculated may be ascribed to that as some have thought or to a Change of Dyet and Air or only to a Cold caught 'tis most certain he complain'd then of Pain in his Head and Bones and was feverish Doctor  Mead  was consulted and order'd him to be blooded vomited and other Medicines for his Relief and that the Inoculation should be Postpon'd till after his Recovery For this End he was remov'd out of My Lord's House to a Nurse who takes People in for the  Small Pox  He got well of his Complaints the  th April  and 'twas thought proper to Inoculate him the  th Ditto  He kept well till the  th May  and then had no other Disorder on him than what is usual before the Eruption of the  Small Pox  after Inoculation On the  th  the Eruptions were plain of the distinct large Kind and he was relieved on that Account but at Night his Complaints returned on him and were rather more severe than they had been he having then a kind of  Dilirium  frequent Vomitings and Stools These continuing the  th  Doctor  Arbothnot  was call'd to his Assistance Doctor  Mead  saw him also the next Day They prescrib'd several things which had the desir'd Success but at this Time his Body was cover'd with  Small Pox  and most of it of the confluent Sort He continu'd in a tolerable good Way till the  th  of  May  when his Fever was sharper on him with a  Dilirium  and Difficulty of Breathing He was then blooded and blisterd but without any Effect He died the  th  and was open'd the  th  Then upon Inspecting the Outside of his Body the Face and Limbs were found as full of  Small Pox  as they could hold as were also two Places in his Breast and Shoulders they all appearing of the Confluent Sort Nothing Material was observ'd in the Dissection of his Body saving that the Lungs were Inflamed and mortified and that in the Cavities of the Thorax there was a pretty large Quantity of bloody Matter extravasated  I Here think fit to declare that whatever  Pamphlets    Advertisements  or  Queries  are or shall hereafter be publish'd in  News Papers  or otherwise as some have lately been with unknown or fictitious Names of Persons Inoculated and false in Fact maliciously intended to Discredit this Practice and impose upon the Publick I will not take any Notice of them except the Author wi  own his Name and bring sufficient Vouchers for what he
