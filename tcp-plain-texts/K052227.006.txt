contingere metam  Multa tulit fecitque Puer  HOR  LONDON  Printed by W BOWYER for BERNARD LINTOT between the  TempleGates    THE TWENTYSECOND BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Death of  Hector  THE  Trojans  being safe within the Walls  Hector  only stays to oppose  Achilles Priam  is struck at his approach and tries to persuade his Son to reenter the Town  Hecuba  joins her Entreaties but in vain  Hector  consults within himself what Measures to take but at the advance of  Achilles  his Resolution fails him and he flies  Achilles  pursues him thrice round the Walls of  Troy  The Gods debate concerning the Fate of  Hector  at length  Minerva  descends to the aid of  Achilles  She deludes  Hector  in the Shape of  Deiphobus  he stands the Combate and is slain  Achilles  drags the dead Body at his Chariot in the sight of  Priam  and  Hecuba  Their Lamentations Tears and Despair Their Cries reach the Ears of  Andromache  who ignorant of this was retired into the inner part of the Palace She mounts up to the Walls and beholds her dead Husband She swoons at the Spectacle Her Excess of Grief and Lamentation  The thirtieth Day still continues The Scene lies under the Walls and on the Battlements of  Troy  THE TWENTYSECOND BOOK OF THE ILIAD  THUS to their Bulwarks smit with Panick Fear  The herded  Ilians  rush like driven Deer  There safe they wipe the briny Drops away  And drown in Bowls the Labours of the Day  Close to the Walls advancing o'er the Fields  Beneath one Roof of wellcompacted Shields  March bending on the  Greeks  embodied Pow'rs  Farstretching in the Shade of  Trojan  Tow'rs  Great  Hector  singly stay'd chain'd down by Fate  There fixt he stood before the  Scaean  Gate  Still his bold Arms determin'd to employ  The Guardian still of longdefended  Troy  Apollo  now to tir'd  Achilles  turns  The Pow'r confest in all his Glory burns  And what he cries has  Peleus'  Son in view  With mortal Speed a Godhead to pursue  For not to thee to know the Gods is giv'n  Unskill'd to trace the latent Marks of Heav'n  What boots thee now that  Troy  forsook the Plain  Vain thy past Labour and thy present vain  Safe in their Walls are now her Troops bestow'd  While here thy frantick Rage attacks a God  The Chief incens'dToo partial God of Day  To check my Conquests in the middle way  How few in  Ilion  else had Refuge found  What gasping Numbers now had bit the Ground  Thou robb'st me of a Glory justly mine  Pow'rful of Godhead and of Fraud Divine  Mean Fame alas for one of heav'nly Strain  To cheat a Mortal who repines in vain  Then to the City terrible and strong  With high and haughty steps he towr'd along  So the proud Courser victor of the prize  To the near Goal with doubled Ardor flies  Him as he blazing shot across the Field  The careful Eyes of  Priam  first beheld  Not half so dreadful rises to the Sight  Thro' the thick Gloom of some tempestuous Night  Orion  's Dog the Year when Autumn weighs  And o'er the feebler Stars exerts his Rays  Terrific Glory for his burning Breath  Taints the red Air with Fevers Plagues and Death  So flam'd his fiery Mail Then wept the Sage  He strikes his rev'rend Head now white with Age  He lifts his wither'd Arms obtests the Skies  He calls his much lov'd Son with feeble Cries  The Son resolv'd  Achilles'  Force to dare  Full at the  Scaean  Gates expects the War  While the sad Father on the Rampart stands  And thus adjures him with extended Hands  Ah stay not stay not guardless and alone  Hector  my lov'd my dearest bravest Son  Methinks already I behold thee slain  And stretch'd beneath that Fury of the Plain  Implacable  Achilles  might'st thou be  To all th' Immortals hateful as to me  Thee Vultures wild should scatter round the Shore  And bloody Dogs grow fiercer from thy Gore  How many valiant Sons I late enjoy'd  Valiant in vain by thy curst Arm destroy'd  Or worse than slaughter'd sold in distant Isles  To shameful Bondage and unworthy Toils  Two while I speak my Eyes in vain explore  Two from one Mother sprung my  Polydore  And lov'd  Lycaon  now perhaps no more  Oh if in yonder hostile Camp they live  What Heaps of Gold what Treasures would I give  Their Grandsire's Wealth by right of Birth their own  Consign'd his Daughter with  Lelegia  's Throne  But if which Heav'n forbid already lost  All pale they wander on the  Stygian  Coast  What Sorrows then must their sad Mother know  What Anguish I Unutterable Woe  Yet less that Anguish less to her to me  Less to all  Troy  if not depriv'd of thee  Yet shun  Achilles  enter yet the Wall  And spare thy self thy Father spare us all  Save thy dear Life or if a Soul so brave  Neglect that Thought thy dearer Glory save  Pity while yet I live these silver Hairs  While yet thy Father feels the Woes he bears  Yet curst with Sense a Wretch whom in his Rage  All trembling on the Verge of helpless Age  Great  Jove  has plac'd sad Spectacle of Pain  The bitter Dregs of Fortune's Cup to drain  To fill with Scenes of Death his closing Eyes  And number all his Days by Miseries  My Heroes slain my Bridal Bed o'erturn'd  My Daughters ravish'd and my City burn'd  My bleeding Infants dash'd against the Floor  These I have yet to see perhaps yet more  Perhaps ev'n I reserv'd by angry Fate  The last sad Relick of my ruin'd State  Dire Pomp of sov'reign Wretchedness must fall  And stain the Pavement of my regal Hall  Where famish'd Dogs late Guardians of my Door  Shall lick their mangled Master's spatter'd Gore  Yet for my Sons I thank ye Gods 'twas well  Well have they perish'd for in Fight they fell  Who dies in Youth and Vigor dies the best  Struck thro' with Wounds all honest on the Breast  But when the Fates in Fulness of their Rage  Spurn the hoar Head of unresisting Age  In Dust the rev'rend Lineaments deform  And pour to Dogs the Lifeblood scarcely warm  This this is Misery the last the worst  That Man can feel Man fated to be curst  He said and acting what no Words could say  Rent from his Head the silver Locks away  With him the mournful Mother bears a Part  Yet all their Sorrows turn not  Hector  's Heart  The Zone unbrac'd her Bosom she display'd  And thus fastfalling the salt Tears she said  Have mercy on me O my Son Revere  The Words of Age attend a Parent's Pray'r  If ever thee in these fond Arms I prest  Or still'd thy infant Clamours at this Breast  Ah do not thus our helpless Years foregoe  But by our Walls secur'd repel the Foe  Against his Rage if singly thou proceed  Should'st thou but Heav'n avert it should'st thou bleed  Nor must thy Corps lye honour'd on the Bier  Nor Spouse nor Mother grace thee with a Tear  Far from our pious Rites those dear Remains  Must feast the Vultures on the naked Plains  So they while down their Cheeks the Torrents roll  But fix'd remains the Purpose of his Soul  Resolv'd he stands and with a fiery Glance  Expects the Hero's terrible Advance  So roll'd up in his Den the swelling Snake  Beholds the Traveller approach the Brake  When fed with noxious Herbs his turgid Veins  Have gather'd half the Poisons of the Plains  He burns he stiffens with collected Ire  And his red Eyeballs glare with living Fire  Beneath a Turret on his Shield reclin'd  He stood and question'd thus his mighty Mind  Where lyes my Way To enter in the Wall  Honour and Shame th' ungen'rous Thought recall  Shall proud  Polydamas  before the Gate  Proclaim his Counsels are obey'd too late  Which timely follow'd but the former Night  What Numbers had been sav'd by  Hector  's Flight  That wise Advice rejected with Disdain  I feel my Folly in my People slain  Methinks my suff'ring Country's Voice I hear  But most her worthless Sons insult my Ear  On my rash Courage charge the Chance of War  And blame those Virtues which they cannot share  NoIf I e'er return return I must  Glorious my Country's Terror laid in Dust  Or if I perish let her see me fall  In Field at least and fighting for her Wall  And yet suppose these Measures I forego  Approach unarm'd and parly with the Foe  The WarriorShield the Helm and Lance lay down  And treat on Terms of Peace to save the Town  The Wife withheld the Treasure ill detain'd  Cause of the War and Grievance of the Land  With honourable Justice to restore  And add half  Ilion  's yet remaining Store  Which  Troy  shall sworn produce that injur'd  Greece  May share our Wealth and leave our Walls in Peace  But why this Thought Unarm'd if I should go  What hope of Mercy from this vengeful Foe  But Womanlike to fall and fall without a Blow  We greet not here as Man conversing Man  Met at an Oak or journeying o'er a Plain  No Season now for calm familiar Talk  Like Youths and Maidens in an Evening Walk  War is our Business but to whom is giv'n  To die or triumph that determine Heav'n  Thus pond'ring like a God the  Greek  drew nigh  His dreadful Plumage nodded from on high  The  Pelian  Jav'lin in his better Hand  Shot trembling Rays that glitter'd o'er the Land  And on his Breast the beamy Splendors shone  Like  Jove  's own Lightning or the rising Sun  As  Hector  sees unusual Terrors rise  Struck by some God he fears recedes and flies  He leaves the Gates he leaves the Walls behind  Achilles  follows like the winged Wind  Thus at the panting Dove a Falcon flies  The swiftest Racer of the liquid Skies  Just when he holds or thinks he holds his Prey  Obliquely wheeling thro' th' aerial Way  With open Beak and shrilling Cries he springs  And aims his Claws and shoots upon his Wings  No less foreright the rapid Chace they held  One urg'd by Fury one by Fear impell'd  Now circling round the Walls their Course maintain  Where the high Watchtow'r overlooks the Plain  Now where the Figtrees spread their Umbrage broad  A wider Compass smoak along the Road  Next by  Scamander  's double Source they bound  Where two fam'd Fountains burst the parted Ground  This hot thro' scorching Clefts is seen to rise  With Exhalations steaming to the Skies  That the green Banks in Summer's Heat o'erflows  Like Crystal clear and cold as WinterSnows  Each gushing Fount a marble Cistern fills  Whose polish'd Bed receives the falling Rills  Where  Trojan  Dames e'er yet alarm'd by  Greece    Wash'd their fair Garments in the Days of Peace  By these they past one chasing one in Flight  The Mighty fled pursu'd by stronger Might  Swift was the Course No vulgar Prize they play  No vulgar Victim must reward the Day  Such as in Races crown the speedy Strife  The Prize contended was great  Hector  's Life  As when some Hero's Fun'rals are decreed  In grateful Honour of the mighty Dead  Where high Rewards the vig'rous Youth inflame  Some golden Tripod or some lovely Dame  The panting Coursers swiftly turn the Goal  And with them turns the rais'd Spectator's Soul  Thus three times round the  Trojan  Wall they fly  The gazing Gods lean forward from the Sky  To whom while eager on the Chace they look  The Sire of Mortals and Immortals spoke  Unworthy Sight The Man belov'd of Heav'n  Behold inglorious round yon' City driv'n  My Heart partakes the gen'rous  Hector  's Pain  Hector  whose Zeal whole Hecatombs has slain  Whose grateful Fumes the Gods receiv'd with Joy  From  Ida  's Summits and the Tow'rs of  Troy  Now see him flying to his Fears resign'd  And Fate and fierce  Achilles  close behind  Consult ye Pow'rs 'tis worthy your Debate  Whether to snatch him from impending Fate  Or let him bear by stern  Pelides  slain  Good as he is the Lot impos'd on Man  Then  Pallas  thus Shall he whose Vengeance forms  The forky Bolt and blackens Heav'n with Storms  Shall he prolong one  Trojan  's forfeit Breath  A Man a Mortal preordain'd to Death  And will no Murmurs fill the Courts above  No Gods indignant blame their partial  Jove  Go then return'd the Sire without delay  Exert thy Will I give the Fates their Way  Swift at the Mandate pleas'd  Tritonia  flies  And stoops impetuous from the cleaving Skies  As thro' the Forest o'er the Vale and Lawn  The wellbreath'd Beagle drives the flying Fawn  In vain he tries the Covert of the Brakes  Or deep beneath the trembling Thicket shakes  Sure of the Vapour in the tainted Dews  The certain Hound his various Maze pursues  Thus step by step where'er the  Trojan  wheel'd  There swift  Achilles  compass'd round the Field  Oft' as to reach the  Dardan  Gates he bends  And hopes th' Assistance of his pitying Friends  Whose show'ring Arrows as he cours'd below  From the high Turrets might oppress the Foe  So oft'  Achilles  turns him to the Plain  He eyes the City but he eyes in vain  As Men in Slumbers seem with speedy pace  One to pursue and one to lead the Chace  Their sinking Limbs the fancy'd Course forsake  Nor this can fly nor that can overtake  No less the lab'ring Heroes pant and strain  While that but flies and this pursues in vain  What God O Muse assisted  Hector  's Force  With Fate itself so long to hold the Course  Phoebus  it was who in his latest Hour  Endu'd his Knees with strength his Nerves with Pow'r  And great  Achilles  lest some  Greek  's Advance  Should snatch the Glory from his lifted Lance  Sign'd to the Troops to yield his Foe the Way  And leave untouch'd the Honours of the Day  Jove  lifts the golden Balances that show  The Fates of mortal Men and things below  Here each contending Hero's Lot he tries  And weighs with equal Hand their Destinies  Low sinks the Scale surcharg'd with  Hector  's Fate  Heavy with Death it sinks and Hell receives the Weight  Then  Phoebus  left him Fierce  Minerva  flies  To stern  Pelides  and triumphing cries  Oh lov'd of  Jove  this Day our Labours cease  And Conquest blazes with full Beams on  Greece  Great  Hector  falls that  Hector  fam'd so far  Drunk with Renown insatiable of War  Falls by thy Hand and mine Nor Force nor Flight  Shall more avail him nor his God of Light  See where in vain he supplicates above  Roll'd at the Feet of unrelenting  Jove  Rest here My self will lead the  Trojan  on  And urge to meet the Fate he cannot shun  Her Voice divine the Chief with joyful Mind  Obey'd and rested on his Lance reclin'd  While like  Deïphobus  the martial Dame  Her Face her Gesture and her Arms the same  In show an Aid by hapless  Hector  's Side  Approach'd and greets him thus with Voice bely'd  Too long O  Hector  have I born the Sight  Of this Distress and sorrow'd in thy Flight  It fits us now a noble Stand to make  And here as Brothers equal Fates partake  Then he O Prince ally'd in Blood and Fame  Dearer than all that own a Brother's Name  Of all that  Hecuba  to  Priam  bore  Long try'd long lov'd much lov'd but honour'd more  Since You of all our num'rous Race alone  Defend my Life regardless of your own  Again the Goddess Much my Father's Pray'r  And much my Mother's prest me to forbear  My Friends embrac'd my Knees adjur'd my stay  But stronger Love impell'd and I obey  Come then the glorious Conflict let us try  Let the Steel sparkle and the Jav'lin fly  Or let us stretch  Achilles  on the Field  Or to his Arm our bloody Trophies yield  Fraudful she said then swiftly march'd before  The  Dardan  Hero shuns his Foe no more  Sternly they met The Silence  Hector  broke  His dreadful Plumage nodded as he spoke  Enough O Son of  Peleus Troy  has view'd  Her Walls thrice circled and her Chief pursu'd  But now some God within me bids me try  Thine or my Fate I kill thee or I die  Yet on the Verge of Battel let us stay  And for a Moment's space suspend the Day  Let Heav'ns high Pow'rs be call'd to arbitrate  The just Conditions of this stern Debate  Eternal Witnesses of all below  And faithful Guardians of the treasur'd Vow  To them I swear if Victor in the Strife  Jove  by these Hands shall shed thy noble Life  No vile Dishonour shall thy Corse pursue  Stript of its Arms alone the Conqu'rors Due  The rest to  Greece  uninjur'd I'll restore  Now plight thy mutual Oath I ask no more  Talk not of Oaths the dreadful Chief replies  While Anger flash'd from his disdainful Eyes  Detested as thou art and ought to be  Nor Oath nor Pact  Achilles  plights with thee  Such Pacts as Lambs and rabid Wolves combine  Such Leagues as Men and furious Lions join  To such I call the Gods One constant state  Of lashing Rancour and eternal Hate  No Thought but Rage and neverceasing Strife  Till Death extinguish Rage and Thought and Life  Rouze then thy Forces this important Hour  Collect thy Soul and call forth all thy Pow'r  No farther Subterfuge no farther Chance  'Tis  Pallas Pallas  gives thee to my Lance  Each  Grecian  Ghost by thee depriv'd of Breath  Now hovers round and calls thee to thy Death  He spoke and lanch'd his Jav'lin at the Foe  But  Hector  shun'd the meditated Blow  He stoop'd while o'er his Head the flying Spear  Sung innocent and spent its Force in Air  Minerva  watch'd it falling on the Land  Then drew and gave to great  Achilles'  Hand  Unseen of  Hector  who elate with Joy  Now shakes his Lance and braves the Dread of  Troy  The Life you boasted to that Jav'lin giv'n  Prince you have mist My Fate depends on Heav'n  To thee presumptuous as thou art unknown  Or what must prove my Fortune or thy own  Boasting is but an Art our Fears to blind  And with false Terrors sink another's Mind  But know whatever Fate I am to try  By no dishonest Wound shall  Hector  die  I shall not fall a Fugitive at least  My Soul shall bravely issue from my Breast  But first try thou my Arm and may this Dart  End all my Country's Woes deep buried in thy Heart  The Weapon flew its Course unerring held  Unerring but the heav'nly Shield repell'd  The mortal Dart resulting with a Bound  From off the ringing Orb it struck the Ground  Hector  beheld his Jav'lin fall in vain  Nor other Lance nor other Hope remain  He calls  Deïphobus  demands a Spear  In vain for no  Deïphobus  was there  All comfortless he stands Then with a Sigh  'Tis soHeav'n wills it and my Hour is nigh  I deem'd  Deïphobus  had heard my Call  But he secure lyes guarded in the Wall  A God deceiv'd me  Pallas  'twas thy Deed  Death and black Fate approach 'Tis I must bleed  No Refuge now no Succour from above  Great  Jove  deserts me and the Son of  Jove  Propitious once and kind Then welcome Fate  'Tis true I perish yet I' perish great  Yet in a mighty Deed I shall expire  Let future Ages hear it and admire  Fierce at the Word his weighty Sword he drew  And all collected on  Achilles  flew  So  Jove  's bold Bird highbalanc'd in the Air  Stoops from the Clouds to truss the quiv'ring Hare  Nor less  Achilles  his fierce Soul prepares  Before his Breast his flaming Shield he bears  Refulgent Orb Above his fourfold Cone  The gilded Horsehair sparkled in the Sun  Nodding at ev'ry Step  Vulcanian  Frame  And as he mov'd his Figure seem'd on flame  As radiant  Hesper  shines with keener Light  Farbeaming o'er the silver Host of Night  When all the starry Train emblaze the Sphere  So shone the Point of great  Achilles'  Spear  In his right Hand he waves the Weapon round  Eyes the whole Man and meditates the Wound  But the rich Mail  Patroclus  lately wore  Securely cas'd the Warrior's Body o'er  One at cealp length he spies to let in Fate  Where 'twixt the Neck and Throat the jointed Plate  Gave entrance Thro' that penetrable Part  Furious he drove the welldirected Dart  Nor pierc'd the Windpipe yet nor took the Pow'r  Of Speech Unhappy from thy dying Hour  Prone on the Field the bleeding Warrior lies  While thus triumphing stern  Achilles  cries  At last is  Hector  stretch'd upon the Plain  Who fear'd no Vengeance for  Patroclus  slain  Then Prince you should have fear'd what now you feel  Achilles  absent was  Achilles  still  Yet a short space the great Avenger stay'd  Then low in Dust thy Strength and Glory lay'd  Peaceful He sleeps with all our Rites adorn'd  For ever honour'd and for ever mourn'd  While cast to all the Rage of hostile Pow'r  Thee Birds shall mangle and the Dogs devour  Then  Hector  fainting at th'approach of Death  By thy own Soul by those who gave thee Breath  By all the sacred Prevalence of Pray'r  Ah leave me not for  Grecian  Dogs to tear  The common Rites of Sepulture bestow  To sooth a Father's and a Mother's Woe  Let their large Gifts procure an Urn at least  And  Hector  's Ashes in his Country rest  No Wretch accurst Relentless he replies  Flames as he spoke shot flashing from his Eyes  Not those who gave me Breath shou'd bid me spare  Nor all the sacred Prevalence of Pray'r  Could I my self the bloody Banquet join  Noto the Dogs that Carcase I resign  Shou'd  Troy  to bribe me bring forth all her Store  And giving thousands offer thousands more  Should  Dardan Priam  and the weeping Dame  Drain their whole Realm to buy one fun'ral Flame  Their  Hector  on the Pile they should not see  Nor rob the Vultures of one Limb of thee  Then thus the Chief his dying Accents drew  Thy Rage Implacable too well I knew  The Furies that relentless Breast have steel'd  And curs'd thee with a Heart that cannot yield  Yet think a Day will come when Fate's Decree  And angry Gods shall wreak this Wrong on thee  Phoebus  and  Paris  shall avenge my Fate  And stretch thee here before this  Scaean  Gate  He ceas'd The Fates supprest his lab'ring Breath  And his Eyes stiffen'd at the Hand of Death  To the dark Realm the Spirit wings its Way  The manly Body left a Load of Clay  And plaintive glides along the dreary Coast  A naked wandring melancholy Ghost  Achilles  musing as he roll'd his eyes  O'er the dead Hero thus unheard replies  Die thou the first When  Jove  and Heav'n ordain  I follow theeHe said and stripp'd the Slain  Then forcing backward from the gaping Wound  The reeking Jav'lin cast it on the Ground  The thronging  Greeks  behold with wond'ring Eyes  His manly Beauty and superiour Size  While some ignobler the great Dead deface  With Wounds ungen'rous or with Taunts disgrace  "How chang'd that  Hector  who like  Jove  of late  "Sent Lightning on our Fleets and scatter'd Fate  High o'er the Slain the great  Achilles  stands  Begirt with Heroes and surrounding Bands  And thus aloud while all the Host attends  Princes and Leaders Countrymen and Friends  Since now at length the pow'rful Will of Heav'n  The dire Destroyer to our Arm has giv'n  Is not  Troy  fall'n already Haste ye Pow'rs  See if already their deserted Tow'rs  Are left unman'd or if they yet retain  The Souls of Heroes their great  Hector  slain  But what is  Troy  or Glory what to me  Or why reflects my Mind on ought but thee  Divine  Patroclus  Death has seal'd his Eyes  Unwept unhonour'd uninterr'd he lies  Can his dear Image from my Soul depart  Long as the vital Spirit moves my Heart  If in the silent Shades of Hell below  The Flames of Friends and Lovers cease to glow  Yet mine shall sacred last mine undecay'd  Burn on thro' Death and animate my Shade  Meanwhile ye Sons of  Greece  in Triumph bring  The Corps of  Hector  and your  Paeans  sing  Be this the Song slowmoving tow'rd the Shore  "  Hector  is dead and  Ilion  is no more  Then his fell Soul a Thought of Vengeance bred  Unworthy of himself and of the Dead  The nervous Ancles bor'd his Feet he bound  With Thongs inserted thro' the double Wound  These fix'd up high behind the rolling Wain  His graceful Head was trail'd along the Plain  Proud on his Car th'insulting Victor stood  And bore aloft his Arms distilling Blood  He smites the Steeds the rapid Chariot flies  The sudden Clouds of circling Dust arise  Now lost is all that formidable Air  The Face divine and longdescending Hair  Purple the Ground and streak the sable Sand  Deform'd dishonour'd in his native Land  Giv'n to the Rage of an insulting Throng  And in his Parent's Sight now dragg'd along  The Mother first beheld with sad survey  She rent her Tresses venerably grey  And cast far off the regal Veils away  With piercing Shrieks his bitter Fate she moans  While the sad Father answers Groans with Groans  Tears after Tears his mournful Cheeks o'erflow  And the whole City wears one Face of Woe  No less than if the Rage of hostile Fires  From her Foundations curling to her Spires  O'er the proud Citadel at length should rise  And the last Blaze send  Ilion  to the Skies  The wretched Monarch of the falling State  Distracted presses to the  Dardan  Gate  Scarce the whole People stop his desp'rate Course  While strong Affliction gives the Feeble Force  Grief tears his Heart and drives him to and fro  In all the raging Impotence of Woe  At length he roll'd in Dust and thus begun  Imploring all and naming one by one  Ah let me let me go where Sorrow calls  I only I will issue from your Walls  Guide or Companion Friends I ask ye none  And bow before the Murd'rer of my Son  My Griefs perhaps his Pity may engage  Perhaps at least he may respect my Age  He has a Father too a Man like me  One not exempt from Age and Misery  Vig'rous no more as when his young Embrace  Begot this Pest of me and all my Race  How many valiant Sons in early Bloom  Has that curst Hand sent headlong to the Tomb  Thee  Hector  last Thy Loss divinely brave  Sinks my sad Soul with Sorrow to the Grave  Oh had thy gentle Spirit past in Peace  The Son expiring in the Sire's Embrace  While both thy Parents wept thy fatal Hour  And bending o'er thee mix'd the tender Show'r  Some Comfort that had been some sad Relief  To melt in full Satiety of Grief  Thus wail'd the Father grov'ling on the Ground  And all the Eyes of  Ilion  stream'd around  Amidst her Matrons  Hecuba  appears  A mourning Princess and a Train in Tears  Ah why has Heav'n prolong'd this hated Breath  Patient of Horrors to behold thy Death  O  Hector  late thy Parents Pride and Joy  The Boast of Nations the Defence of  Troy  To whom her Safety and her Fame she ow'd  Her Chief her Hero and almost her God  O fatal Change become in one sad Day  A senseless Corps inanimated Clay  But not as yet the fatal News had spread  To fair  Andromache  of  Hector  dead  As yet no Messenger had told his Fate  Nor ev'n his Stay without the  Scaean  Gate  Far in the close Recesses of the Dome  Pensive she ply'd the melancholy Loom  A growing Work employ'd her secret Hours  Confus'dly gay with intermingled Flowr's  Her fairhair'd Handmaids heat the brazen Urn  The Bath preparing for her Lord's Return  In vain Alas her Lord returns no more  Unbath'd he lies and bleeds along the Shore  Now from the Walls the Clamours reach her Ear  And all her Members shake with sudden Fear  Forth from her Iv'ry Hand the Shuttle falls  As thus astonish'd to her Maids she calls  Ah follow me she cry'd what plaintive Noise  Invades my Ear 'Tis sure my Mother's Voice  My falt'ring Knees their trembling Frame desert  A Pulse unusual flutters at my Heart  Some strange Disaster some reverse of Fate  Ye Gods avert it threats the  Trojan  State  Far be the Omen which my Thoughts suggest  But much I fear my  Hector  's dauntless Breast  Confronts  Achilles  chas'd along the Plain  Shut from our Walls I fear I fear him slain  Safe in the Crowd he ever scorn'd to wait  And sought for Glory in the Jaws of Fate  Perhaps that noble Heat has cost his Breath  Now quench'd for ever in the Arms of Death  She spoke and furious with distracted Pace  Fears in her Heart and Anguish in her Face  Flies thro' the Dome the Maids her Steps pursue  And mounts the Walls and sends around her View  Too soon her Eyes the killing Object found  The godlike  Hector  dragg'd along the Ground  A sudden Darkness shades her swimming Eyes  She faints she falls her Breath her Colour flies  Her Hair's fair Ornaments the Braids that bound  The Net that held them and the Wreath that crown'd  The Veil and Diadem flew far away  The Gift of  Venus  on her bridal Day  Around a Train of weeping Sisters stands  To raise her sinking with assistant Hands  Scarce from the Verge of Death recall'd again  She faints or but recovers to complain  O wretched Husband of a wretched Wife  Born with one Fate to one unhappy Life  For sure one Star its baneful Beam display'd  On  Priam  's Roof and  Hippoplacia  's Shade  From diff'rent Parents diff'rent Climes we came  At diff'rent Periods yet our Fate the same  Why was my Birth to great  Aëtion  ow'd  And why was all that tender Care bestow'd  Would I had never beenO thou the Ghost  Of my dead Husband miserably lost  Thou to the dismal Realms for ever gone  And I abandon'd desolate alone  An only Child once Comfort of my Pains  Sad Product now of hapless Love remains  No more to smile upon his Sire no Friend  To help him now No Father to defend  For should he 'scape the Sword the common Doom  What Wrongs attend him

Tear with Tear  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TwentySecond Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TWENTYSECOND BOOK  I  IT is impossible but the whole Attention of the Reader must be awaken'd in this Book The Heroes of the two Armies are now to encounter all the foregoing Battels have been but so many Preludes and Underactions in order to this great Event Wherein the whole Fate of  Greece  and  Troy  is to be decided by the Sword of  Achilles  and  Hector  This is the Book which of the whole Iliad appears to me the most charming It assembles in it all that can be imagined of great and important on the one hand and of tender and melancholy on the other  Terror  and  Pity  are here wrought up in Perfection and if the Reader is not sensible of both in a high degree either he is utterly void of all Taste or the Translator of all Skill in Poetry  II  VERSE  Not half so dreadful rises  c  With how much dreadful Pomp is  Achilles  here introduced How noble and in what bold Colours hath he drawn the blazing of his Arms  the Rapidity of his Advance the Terror of his Appearance the Desolation around him but above all the certain Death attending all his Motions and his very Looks what a Crowd of terrible Ideas in this one Simile  But immediately after this follows the moving Image of the two aged Parents trembling weeping and imploring their Son That is succeeded again by the dreadful gloomy Picture of  Hector  all on fire obstinately bent on Death and expecting  Achilles  admirably painted in the Simile of the Snake roll'd up in his Den and collecting his Poisons And indeed thro' the whole Book this wonderful Contrast and Opposition of the  Moving  and of the  Terrible  is perpetually kept up each heightening the other I can't find Words to express how so great Beauties affect me  III  VERSE  The Speech of  Priam  to  Hector  The Poet has entertain'd us all along with various Scenes of Slaughter and Horrour He now changes to the pathetick and fills the Mind of the Reader with tender Sorrows  Eustathius  observes that  Priam  preludes to his Words by Actions expressive of Misery The unhappy Orator introduces his Speech to  Hector  with Groans and Tears and rending his hoary Hair The Father and the King plead with  Hector  to preserve his Life and his Country He represents his own Age and the Loss of many of his Children and adds that if  Hector  falls he should then be inconsolable and the Empire of  Troy  at an end  It is a piece of great Judgment in  Homer  to make the Fall of  Troy  to depend upon the Death of  Hector  The Poet does not openly tell us that  Troy  was taken by the  Greeks  but that the Reader might not be unacquainted with what happen'd after the Period of his Poem he gives us to understand in this Speech that the City was taken and that  Priam  his Wives his Sons and Daughters were either kill'd or made Slaves  IV  VERSE  Enter yet the Wall and save  c  The Argument that  Priam  uses says  Eustathius  to induce  Hector  to secure himself in  Troy  is remarkable he draws it not from  Hector  's Fears nor does he tell him that he is to save his own Life but he insists upon stronger Motives He tells him he may preserve his FellowCitizens his Country and his Father and farther persuades him not to add Glory to his mortal Enemy by his Fall  V  VERSE  My bleeding Infants dash'd against the Floor    Cruelties which the  Barbarians  usually exercis'd in the sacking of Towns Thus  Isaiah  foretels to  Babylon  that her Children shall be dash'd in pieces before her Eyes by the  Medes Infantes eorum allidentur in oculis eorum  xii And  David  says to the same City  Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the Stones  Psal cxxxvii And in the Prophet  Hosea  xiii  Their Infants shall be dash'd in pieces Dacier  VI  VERSE  But when the Fates  c  Nothing can be more moving than the Image which  Homer  gives here in comparing the different Effects produc'd by the View of a young Man and that of an old one both bleeding and extended on the Dust The old Man 'tis certain touches us most and several Reasons may be given for it the principal is that the young Man defended himself and his Death is glorious whereas an old Man has no defence but his Weakness Prayers and Tears They must be very insensible of what is dreadful and have no Taste in Poetry who omit this Passage in a Translation and substitute things of a trivial and insipid Nature  Dacier  VII  VERSE  The Speech of  Hecuba  The Speech of  Hecuba  opens with as much Tenderness as that of  Priam  The Circumstance in particular of her shewing that Breast to her Son which had sustain'd his Infancy is highly moving It is a silent kind of Oratory and prepares the Heart to listen by prepossessing the Eye in favour of the Speaker  Eustathius  takes notice of the Difference between the Speeches of  Priam  and  Hecuba Priam  dissuades him from the Combat by enumerating not only the Loss of his own Family but of his whole Country  Hecuba  dwells entirely upon his single Death this is a great Beauty in the Poet to make  Priam  a Father to his whole Countrey but to describe the Fondness of the Mother as prevailing over all other Considerations and to mention that only which chiefly affects her  This puts me in mind of a judicious Stroke in  Milton  with regard to the several Characters of  Adam  and  Eve  When the Angel is driving them both out of Paradise  Adam  grieves that he must leave a place where he had convers'd with God and his Angels but  Eve  laments that she shall never more behold the fine Flowers of  Eden  Here  Adam  mourns like a Man and  Eve  like a Woman  VIII  VERSE  The Soliloquy of  Hector  There is much Greatness in the Sentiments of this whole Soliloquy  Hector  prefers Death to an ignominious Life He knows how to die with Glory but not how to live with Dishonour The Reproach of  Polydamas  affects him the Scandals of the meanest People have an Influence on his Thoughts  'Tis remarkable that he does not say he fears the Insults of the braver  Trojans  but of the most worthless only Men of Merit are always the most candid but others are ever for bringing all Men to a Level with themselves They cannot  bear that any one should be so bold as to excel and are ready to pull him down to them upon the least Miscarriage This Sentiment is perfectly fine and agreeable to the way of thinking natural to a great and sensible Mind  There is a very beautiful Break in the middle of this Speech  Hector  's Mind fluctuates every way he is calling a Council in his own Breast and consulting what Method to pursue He doubts if he should not propose Terms of Peace to  Achilles  and grants him very large Concessions but of a sudden he checks himself and leaves the Sentence unfinish'd The Paragraph runs thus  "If says  Hector  I should offer him the largest Conditions give all that  Troy  contains  There he stops and immediately subjoins  "But why do I delude myself  c  'Tis evident from this Speech that the Power of making Peace was in  Hector  's Hands For unless  Priam  had transfer'd it to him he could not have made these Propositions So that it was  Hector  who broke the Treaty in the third Book where the very same Conditions were propos'd by  Agamemnon  'Tis  Hector  therefore that is guilty he is blameable in continuing the War and involving the  Greeks  and  Trojans  in Blood This Conduct in  Homer  was necessary he observes a poetical Justice and shews us that  Hector  is a Criminal before he brings him to Death  Eustathius  IX  VERSE  Shall proud  Polydamas  c    Hector  alludes to the Counsel given him by  Polydamas  in the eighteenth Book which he then neglected to follow It was to withdraw to the City and fortify themselves there before  Achilles  return'd to the Battel  X  VERSE  We greet not here as Man conversing Man  Met at an Oak or journeying o'er a Plain  c  The Words literally are these  "  There is no talking with  Achilles    from an Oak or from a Rock  or about an Oak or a Rock  as a young Man and a Maiden talk together  It is thought an obscure Passage tho' I confess I am either too fond of my own Explication in the abovecited Verses or they make it a very clear one  "There is no conversing with this implacable Enemy in the Rage of Battel as when sauntring People talk at leisure to one another on the Road or when young Men and Women meet in a Field"  I think the Exposition of  Eustathius  more farfetch'd tho' it be ingenious and therefore I must do him the Justice not to suppress it It was a common Practice says he with the Heathens to expose such Children as they either could not or would not educate The Places where they deposited them were usually in the Cavities of  Rocks  or the Hollow of  Oaks  These Children being frequently found and preserv'd by Strangers were said to be the Offspring of those Oaks or Rocks where they were found This gave occasion to the Poets to feign that Men were born of  Oaks  and there was a famous Fable too of  Deucalion  and  Pyrrha  's repairing Mankind by casting  Stones  behind them It grew at last into a Proverb to signify idle Tales so that in the present Passage it imports that  Achilles will not listen to such idle Tales as may pass with silly Maids and fond Lovers  For Fables and Stories and particularly such Stories as the Preservation strange Fortune and Adventures of expos'd Children are the usual Conversation of young Men and Maidens  Eustathius  his Explanation may be corroborated by a Parallel Place in the Odyssey where the Poet says  The Meaning of which Passage is plainly this  Tell me of what Race you are for undoubtedly you had a Father and Mother you are not according to the old Story descended from an  Oak  or a  Rock Where the Word  shews that this was become an ancient Proverb even in  Homer  's Days  XI  VERSE  Struck by some God he fears recedes and flies    I doubt not most Readers are shock'd at the Flight of  Hector  It is indeed a high Exaltation of  Achilles  which was the Poets chief Care as he was his chief Hero that so brave a Man as  Hector  durst not stand him While  Achilles  was at a distance he had fortify'd his Heart with noble Resolutions but at his approach they all vanish and he flies This as exceptionable as some may think it may yet be allow'd to be a true Portrait of human Nature for Distance as it lessens all Objects so it does our Fears But where inevitable Danger approaches the stoutest Hearts will feel some Apprehensions at certain Fate It was the Saying of one of the bravest Men in this Age to one who told him he fear'd nothing  Shew me but a certain Danger and I shall be as much afraid as any of you  I don't absolutely pretend to justify this Passage in every point but only to have thus much granted me that  Hector  was in this desperate Circumstance  First  It will not be found in the whole Iliad that  Hector  ever thought himself a Match for  Achilles Homer  to keep this in our Minds had just now made  Priam  tell him as a thing known for certainly  Priam  would not insult him at that time that there was no Comparison between his own Strength and that of his Antagonist    Secondly  we may observe with  Dacier  the Degrees by which  Homer  prepares this Incident In the th Book the mere Sight and Voice of  Achilles  unarm'd has terrify'd and put the whole  Trojan  Army into Disorder In the th the very Sound of the coelestial Arms given him by  Vulcan  has affrighted his own  Myrmidons  as they stand about him In the th he has been upon the point of killing  Aeneas  and  Hector  himself was not sav'd from him but by  Apollo  's interposing In that and the following Book he makes an incredible Slaughter of all that oppose him he overtakes  most of those that fly from him and  Priam  himself opens the Gates of  Troy  to receive the rest  Thirdly Hector  stays not that he hopes to overcome  Achilles  but because Shame and the dread of Reproach forbid him to reenter the City a Shame says  Eustathius  which was a Fault that betray'd him out of his Life and ruin'd his Countrey Nay  Homer  adds farther that he only stay'd by the immediate  Will of Heaven  intoxicated and irresistibly bound down by  Fate  Fourthly  He had just been reflecting on the Injustice of the War he maintain'd his Spirits are deprest by Heaven he expects certain Death he perceives himself abandon'd by the Gods as he directly says in ℣  c  of the  Greek  and of the translation so that he might say to  Achilles  what  Turnus  does to  Aeneas  Dii  me terrent  Jupiter  hostis  This indeed is the strongest Reason that can be offer'd for the Flight of  Hector  He flies not from  Achilles  as a mortal Hero but from one whom he sees clad in impenetrable Armour seconded by  Minerva  and one who had put to flight the inferior Gods themselves This is not Cowardice according to the constant Principles of  Homer  who thought it no part of a Hero's Character to be impious or to fancy himself independent on the supreme Being  Indeed it had been a grievous Fault had our Author suffer'd the Courage of  Hector  entirely to forsake him even in this Extremity A brave Man's Soul is still capable of rouzing itself and acting honourably in the last Struggles Accordingly  Hector  tho' deliver'd over to his Destiny abandon'd by the Gods and certain of Death yet stops and attacks  Achilles  When he loses his Spear he draws his Sword it was impossible he should conquer it was only in his Power to fall gloriously this he did and it was all that Man could do  If the Reader after all cannot bring himself to like this Passage for his own particular yet to induce him to suspend  his absolute Censure he may consider that  Virgil  had an uncommon Esteem for it as he has testify'd in transferring it almost entirely to the Death of  Turnus  where there was no necessity of making use of the like Incidents But doubtless he was touch'd with this Episode as with one of those which interest us most of the whole Iliad by a Spectacle at once so terrible and so deplorable I must also add the Suffrage of  Aristotle  who was so far from looking upon this Passage as ridiculous or blameable that he esteem'd it marvellous and admirable  "The  wonderful  says he ought to have place in Tragedy but still more in Epic Poetry which proceeds in this Point even to the Unreasonable For as in Epic Poems one sees not the Persons acting so whatever passes the Bounds of Reason is proper to produce the admirable and the marvellous For example what  Homer  says of  Hector  pursued by  Achilles  would appear ridiculous on the Stage for the Spectators could not forbear laughing to see on one side the  Greeks  standing without any motion and on the other  Achilles  pursuing  Hector  and making Signs to the Troops not to dart at him But all this does not appear when we read the Poem For what is wonderful is always agreeable and as a proof of it we find that they who relate any thing usually add something to the Truth that it may the better please those who hear it  The same great Critick vindicates this Passage in the Chapter following  "A Poet says he is inexcusable if he introduces such things as are impossible according to the Rules of Poetry but this ceases to be a Fault if by those means he attains to the End he propos'd for he has then brought about what he intended For example if he renders by it any part of his Poem more astonishing or admirable Such is the Place in the Iliad where  Achilles  pursues  Hector  Arist  Poet chap  XII  VERSE  Where two fam'd Fountains    Strabo  blames  Homer  for saying that one of the Sources of  Scamander  was  a warm Fountain whereas says he there is but one Spring and that cold neither is this in the Place where  Homer  fixes it but in the Mountain It is observ'd by  Eustathius  that tho' this was not true in  Strabo  's Days yet it might in  Homer  's greater Changes having happen'd in less time than that which pass'd between those two Authors  Sandys  who was both a Geographer and Critick of great Accuracy as well as a Traveller of great Veracity affirms as an Eye witness that there are yet some Hotwater Springs in that part of the Country opposite to  Tenedos  I cannot but think that Gentleman must have been particularly diligent and curious in his Enquiries into the Remains of a Place so celebrated in Poetry as he was not only perhaps the most learned but one of the best Poets of his Time I am glad of this occasion to do his Memory so much Justice as to say the  English  Versification owes much of its Improvement to his Translations and especially that admirable one of  Job  What chiefly pleases me in this place is to see the exact Landskip of old  Troy  we have a clear Idea of the Town itself and of the Roads and Countrey about it the River the Figtrees and every part is set before our Eyes  XIII  VERSE  The gazing Gods lean forward from the Skies    We have here an Instance of the great Judgment of  Homer  The Death of  Hector  being the chief Action of the Poem he assembles the Gods and calls a Council in Heaven concerning it It is for the same Reason that he represents  Jupiter  with the greatest Solemnity weighing in his Scales the Fates of the two Heroes I have before observ'd at large upon the last Circumstance in a preceding Note so that there is no occasion to repeat it  I wonder that none of the Commentators have taken notice of this Beauty in my Opinion it is a very necessary Observation and shews the Art and Judgment of the Poet in that he has made the greatest and finishing Action of the Poem of such Importance that it engages the Gods in Debates  XIV  VERSE  From  Ida  's Summits    It was the Custom of the  Pagans  to sacrifice to the Gods upon the Hills and Mountains in Scripture Language upon the  high places  for they were persuaded that the Gods in a particular manner inhabited such Eminences Wherefore God order'd his People to destroy all those high places which the Nations had prophan'd by their Idolatry  You shall utterly destroy all the Places wherein the Nations which you shall possess served their Gods upon the high Mountains and upon the Hills and under every green Tree  Deut xii 'Tis for this Reason that so many Kings are reproach'd in Scripture for not  taking away the high Places  XV  VERSE  Thus Step by Step  c  There is some Difficulty in this Passage and it seems strange that  Achilles  could not overtake  Hector  when he is allow'd to excel so much in Swiftness especially when the Poet describes him as running in a narrower Circle than  Hector Eustathius  gives us many Solutions from the Ancients  Homer  has already told us that they run for the Life of  Hector  and consequently  Hector  would exert his utmost Speed whereas  Achilles  might only endeavour to keep him from entring the City Besides  Achilles  could not directly pursue him because he frequently made Efforts to shelter himself under the Wall and he being oblig'd to turn him from it he might be forced to take more Steps than  Hector  but the Poet to take away all Grounds of an Objection tells us afterwards that  Apollo  gave him a supernatural Swiftness  XVI  VERSE  As Men in Slumbers    This beautiful Comparison has been condemn'd by some of the Ancients even so far as to judge it unworthy of having a Place in the Iliad  They say the Diction is mean and the Similitude itself absurd because it compares the Swiftness of the Heroes to Men asleep who are in a state of Rest and Inactivity but surely there cannot be a more groundless Criticism The Poet is so far from drawing his Comparison from the Repose of Men asleep that he alludes only to their Dreams It is a Race in fancy that he describes and surely the Imagination is nimble enough to illustrate the greatest Degree of Swiftness Besides the Verses themselves run with the utmost Rapidity and imitate the Swiftness they describe  Eustathius  What sufficiently proves these Verses to be genuine is that  Virgil  has imitated them  Aen    Ac veluti in somnis  XVII  VERSE  Sign'd to the Troops  c  The Difference which  Homer  here makes between  Hector  and  Achilles  deserves to be taken notice of  Hector  in running away towards the Walls to the end that the  Trojans  who are upon them may overwhelm  Achilles  with their Darts and  Achilles  in turning  Hector  towards the Plain makes a Sign to his Troops not to attack him This shews the great Courage of  Achilles  and yet this Action which appears so generous has been very much condemn'd by the Ancients  Plutarch  in the Life of  Pompey  gives us to understand that it was look'd upon as the Action of a Fool too greedy of Glory Indeed this is not a single Combat of  Achilles  against  Hector  for in that case  Achilles  would have done very ill not to hinder his Troops from assaulting him this was a Rencounter in a Battel and so  Achilles  might and ought to take all Advantage to rid himself the readiest and the surest way of an Enemy whose Death would procure an entire Victory to his Party Wherefore does he leave this Victory to Chance Why expose himself to the Hazard of losing it Why does he prefer his private Glory to the publick Weal and the Safety of all the  Greeks  which he puts to the venture by delaying to conquer  and endangering his own Person I grant it is a Fault but it must be own'd to be the Fault of a Hero  Eustathius Dacier  XVIII  VERSE  Then  Phoebus  left him    This is a very beautiful and poetical manner of describing a plain Circumstance The Hour of  Hector  's Death was now come and the Poet expresses it by saying that  Apollo  or  Destiny  forsakes him That is the Fates no longer protect him  Eustathius  XIX  VERSE  idFierce  Minerva  flies to stern  Pelides  c    The Poet may seem to diminish the Glory of  Achilles  by ascribing the Victory over  Hector  to the Assistance of  Pallas  whereas in truth he fell by the Hand only of  Achilles  But Poetry loves to raise every thing into a Wonder it steps out of the common Road of Narration and aims to surprize and the Poet would farther insinuate that it is a greater Glory to  Achilles  to be belov'd by the Gods than to be only excellent in Valour For many Men have Valour but few the Favour of Heaven  Eustathius  XX  VERSE  Obey'd and rested    The whole Passage where  Pallas  deceives  Hector  is evidently an Allegory  Achilles  perceiving that he cannot overtake  Hector  pretends to be quite spent and wearied in the Pursuit the Stratagem takes effect and recalls his Enemy This the Poet expresses by saying that  Pallas  or  Wisdom  came to assist  Achilles Hector  observing his Enemy stay to rest concludes that he is quite fatigued and immediately takes Courage and advances upon him he thinks he has him at an Advantage but at last finds himself deceiv'd Thus making a wrong Judgment he  is betray'd into his Death so that his own  false Judgment  is the  treacherous Pallas  that deceives him  Eustathius  XXI  VERSE  The Speeches of  Hector  and of  Achilles  There is an Opposition between these Speeches excellently adapted to the Characters of both the Heroes That of  Hector  is full of Courage but mixt with Humanity That of  Achilles  of Resentment and Arrogance We see the great  Hector  disposing of his own Remains and that Thirst of Glory which has made him live with Honour now bids him provide as  Eustathius  observes that what once was  Hector  may not de dishonour'd Thus we see a sedate calm courage with a Contempt of Death in the Speeches of  Hector  But in that of  Achilles  there is a  Fiertè  and an insolent Air of Superiority his Magnanimity makes him scorn to steal a Victory he bids him prepare to defend himself with all his Forces and that Valour and Resentment which made him desirous that he might revenge himself upon  Hector  with his own Hand and forbade the  Greeks  to interpose now directs him not to take any Advantage over a brave Enemy I think both their Characters are admirably sustain'd and tho'  Achilles  be drawn with a great Violence of Features yet the Picture is undoubtedly like him and it had been the utmost Absurdity to have soften'd one Line upon this Occasion when the Soul of  Achilles  was all on fire to revenge the Death of his Friend  Patroclus  I must desire the Reader to carry this Observation in his Memory and particularly in that place where  Achilles  says he could eat the very Flesh of  Hector  tho' I have a little soften'd it in the Translation V  XXII  VERSE  So  Jove  's bold Bird  c  The Poet takes up some time in describing the two great Heroes before they close in Fight The Verses are pompous and magnificent and he illustrates his Description with two beautiful Similes He makes  a double use of this Conduct he not only raises our Imagination to attend to so momentous an Action but by lengthening his Narration he keeps the Mind in a pleasing Suspense and divides it between Hopes and Fears for the Fate of  Hector  or  Achilles  XXIII  VERSE  Thro' that penetrable Part furious he drove  c  It was necessary that the Poet shou'd be very particular in this Point because the Arms that  Hector  wore were the Arms of  Achilles  taken from  Patroclus  and consequently as they were the Work of  Vulcan  they would preserve  Hector  from the Possibility of a Wound The Poet therefore to give an Air of Probability to his Story tells us that they were  Patroclus  his Arms and as they were not made for  Hector  they might not exactly fit his Body So that it is not improbable but there might be some place about the Neck of  Hector  so open as to admit the Spear of  Achilles Eustathius  XXIV  VERSE  Could I my self the bloody Banquet join    I have before hinted that there is something very fierce and violent in this Passage but I fancy that what I there observ'd will justify  Homer  in his Relation tho' not  Achilles  in his savage Sentiments Yet the Poet softens the Expression by saying that  Achilles  only wishes that his Heart would permit him to devour him This is much more tolerable than a Passage in the  Thebais  of  Statius  where  Tydeus  in the very Pangs of Death is represented as knawing the Head of his Enemy  XXV  VERSE  Should  Troy  to bribe me  c  Such Resolutions as  Achilles  here makes are very natural to Men in Anger he tells  Hector  that no Motives shall ever prevail  with him to suffer his Body to be ransom'd yet when Time had cool'd his Heat and he had somewhat satisfy'd his Revenge by insulting his Remains he restores them to  Priam  this perfectly agrees with his Conduct in the ninth Book where at first he gives a rough Denial and afterwards softens into an easier Temper And this is very agreeable to the Nature of  Achilles  his Anger abates very slowly it is stubborn yet still it remits Had the Poet drawn him as never to be pacify'd he had outrag'd Nature and not represented his Hero as a Man but as a Monster  Eustathius  XXVI  VERSE  A Day will come    Hector  prophesies at his Death that  Achilles  shall fall by the Hand of  Paris  This confirms an Observation made in a former Note that the Words of dying Men were look'd upon as Prophecies but whether such Conjectures are true or false it appears from hence that such Opinions have prevail'd in the World above three thousand Years  XXVII  VERSE  The great Dead deface with Wounds c    Eustathius  tells us that  Homer  introduces the Soldiers wounding the dead Body of  Hector  in order to mitigate the Cruelties which  Achilles  exercises upon his Body For if every common Soldier takes a Pride in giving him a Wound what Insults may we not expect from the inexorable inflam'd  Achilles  But I must confess myself unable to vindicate the Poet in giving us such an Idea of his Countreymen I think the former Courage of their Enemy should have been so far from moving them to Revenge that it should have recommended him to their Esteem What  Achilles  afterwards acts is suitable to his Character and consequently the Poet is justify'd but surely all the  Greeks  were not of his Temper  Patroclus  was not so dear to them all as he  was to  Achilles  'Tis true the Poet represents  Achilles  as  Eustathius  observes enumerating the many Ills they had suffer'd from  Hector  and he seems to endeavour to infect the whole Army with his Resentment Had  Hector  been living they had been acted by a generous Indignation against him But these Men seem as if they only dared approach him dead in short what they say over his Body is a mean Insult and the Stabs they give it are cowardly and barbarous  XXXI  VERSE  The Speech of  Achilles  We have a very fine Observation of  Eustathius  on this Place that the Judgment and Address of  Homer  here is extreamly worthy of Remark He knew and had often said that the Gods and Fate had not granted  Achilles  the Glory of taking  Troy  There was then no reason to make him march against the Town after the Death of  Hector  since all his Efforts must have been ineffectual What has the Poet done in this Conjuncture It was but reasonable that the first Thought of  Achilles  should be to march directly to  Troy  and to profit himself of the general Consternation into which the Death of  Hector  had thrown the  Trojans  We here see he knows the Duty and does not want the Ability of a great General but after this on a sudden he changes his Design and derives a plausible Pretence from the Impatience he has to pay the last Devoirs to his Friend The Manners of  Achilles  and what he has already done for  Patroclus  make this very natural At the same time this turning off to the tender and pathetick has a fine Effect the Reader in the very Fury of the Hero's Vengeance perceives that  Achilles  is still a Man and capable of softer Passions  XXXII  VERSE "Hector  is dead and  Ilion  is no more    I have follow'd the Opinion of  Eustathius  who thought that what  Achilles  says here was the Chorus or Burden of  a Song of Triumph in which his Troops bear a part with him as he returns from this glorious Combate  Dacier  observes that this is very correspondent to the Manners of those Times and instances in that Passage of the Book of  Kings  when  David  returns from the Conquest of  Goliah  The Women there go out to meet him from all the Cities of  Israel  and sing a triumphal Song the Chorus whereof is Saul  has kill'd his Thousands and  David  his ten Thousands  XXXIII  VERSE  Unworthy of himself and of the Dead    This Inhumanity of  Achilles  in dragging the dead Body of  Hector  has been severely and I think indeed not without some Justice censur'd by several both Ancients and Moderns  Plato  in his third Book  de Republica  speaks of it with Detestation But methinks it is a great Injustice to  Homer  to reflect upon the Morals of the Author himself for things which he only paints as the Manners of a vicious Hero  It may justly be observ'd in general of all  Plato  's Objections against  Homer  that they are still in a View to Morality constantly blaming him for representing ill and immoral Things as the Opinions or Actions of his Persons To every one of these one general Answer will serve which is that  Homer  as often describes ill things in order to make us avoid them as good to induce us to follow them which is the Case with all Writers whatever But what is extremely remarkable and evidently shews the Injustice of  Plato  's Censure is that many of those very Actions for which he blames him are expressly characterized and marked by  Homer  himself as evil and detestable by previous Expressions or Cautions Thus in the present Place before he describes this Barbarity of  Achilles  he tells us it was a most unworthy Action    When  Achilles  sacrifices the twelve young  Trojans  in l he repeats the same Words When  Pandarus  broke the  Truce in l he told us it was a mad unjust Deed    And so of the rest  XXXIV  VERSE  The Face divine and longdescending Hair    It is impossible to read the Actions of great Men without having our Curiosity rais'd to know the least Circumstance that relates to them  Homer  to satisfy it has taken care in the Process of his Poem to give us the Shape of his Heroes and the very Colour of their Hair thus he has told us that  Achilles  's Locks were yellow and here the Epithet  shews us that those of  Hector  were of a darker Colour As to his Person he told us a little above that it was so handsome that all the  Greeks  were surpriz'd to see it  Plutarch  recites a remarkable Story of the Beauty of  Hector  It was reported in  Lacedaemon  that a handsome Youth who very much resembled  Hector  was arriv'd there immediately the whole City run in such Numbers to behold him that he was trampled to Death by the Crowd  Eustathius  XXXV  VERSE  Sinks my sad Soul with Sorrow to the Grave    It is in the  Greek  It is needless to observe to the Reader with what a beautiful Pathos the wretched Father laments his Son  Hector  It is impossible not to join with  Priam  in his Sorrows But what I would chiefly point out to my Reader is the Beauty of this Line which is particularly tender and almost Word for Word the same with that of the Patriarch  Jacob  who upon a like Occasion breaks out into the same Complaint and tells  his Children that if they deprive him of his Son  Benjamin  they will  bring down his grey Hairs with Sorrow to the Grave  XXXVI  VERSE  c  The Grief of  Andromache  which is painted in the following Part is far beyond all the Praises that can be given it but I must take notice of one Particular which shews the great Art of the Poet In order to make the Wife of  Hector  appear yet more afflicted than his Parents he has taken care to encrease her Affliction by Surprize It is finely prepar'd by the Circumstances of her being retir'd to her innermost Apartment of her Employment in weaving a Robe for her Husband as may be conjectur'd from what she says afterward ℣ and of her Maids preparing the Bath for his Return All which as the Criticks have observ'd augment the Surprize and render this Reverse of Fortune much more dreadful and afflicting  XXXVI  VERSE  Her Hair's fair Ornaments    Eustathius  remarks that in speaking of  Andromache  and  Hecuba Homer  expatiates upon the Ornaments of Dress in  Andromache  because she was a beautiful young Princess but is very concise about that of  Hecuba  because she was old and wore a Dress rather suitable to her Age and Gravity than to her State Birth and Condition I cannot pass over a Matter of such Importance as a young Lady's Dress without endeavouring to explain what sort of Heads were worn above three thousand Years ago  It is difficult to describe particularly every Ornament mention'd by the Poet but I shall lay before my female Readers the Bishop's Explanation The  was used  that is to tye backwards the Hair that grew on the forepart of the Head The  was a Veil of Network that cover'd the Hair when it was so  ty'd  was an Ornament us'd  to tye backwards the Hair that grew on the Temples and the  was a Fillet perhaps embroider'd with Gold from the Expression of  that bound the whole and compleated the Dress  The Ladies cannot but be pleas'd to see so much Learning and  Greek  upon this important Subject  Homer  is in nothing more excellent than in that Distinction of Characters which he maintains thro' his whole Poem What  Andromache  here says can be spoken properly by none but  Andromache  There is nothing general in her Sorrows nothing that can be transfer'd to another Character The Mother laments the Son and the Wife weeps over the Husband  XXXVIII  VERSE  The Day that to the Shades  c  The following Verses which so finely describe the Condition of an Orphan have been rejected by some ancient Criticks It is a Proof there were always Criticks of no manner of Taste it being impossible any where to meet with a more exquisite Passage I will venture to say there are not in all  Homer  any Lines more worthy of him The Beauty of this tender and Compassionate Image is such that it even makes amends for the many cruel ones with which the Iliad is too much stained These Censurers imagined this Description to be of too abject and mean a Nature for one of the Quality of  Astyanax  but had they consider'd says  Eustathius  that these are the Words of a fond Mother who fear'd every thing for her Son that Women are by Nature timorous and think all Misfortunes will happen because there is a Possibility that they may that  Andromache  is in the very height of her Sorrows in the Instant she is speaking I fancy they would have alter'd their Opinion  It is undoubtedly an Aggravation to our Misfortunes when they sink us in a Moment from the highest flow of Prosperity to the lowest Adversity The Poet judiciously makes use of this Circumstance the more to excite our Pity and introduces  the Mother with the utmost Tenderness lamenting this Reverse of Fortune in her Son chang'd all at once into a Slave a Beggar an Orphan Have we not Examples in our own Times of such unhappy Princes whose Condition renders this of  Astyanax  but too probable  XXXIX  VERSE  On Dainties fed    It is in the  Greek  "Who upon his Father's Knees us'd to eat Marrow and the Fat of Sheep  This would seem gross if it were literally translated but it is a figurative Expression and in the Style of the Orientals Marrow and Fatness are taken for whatever is best tenderest and most delicious Thus in  Job  xxi  Viscera ejus plena sunt adipe medullis ossa ejus  rigantur  And xxxvi  Requies autem mensae tuae erit plena pinguedine  In  Jer  xxxi God says that he will satiate the Soul of the Priests with Fatness  Inebriabo animam Sacerdotum pinguedine Dacier  XL  VERSE  The martial Scarf and Robe of Triumph wove    This Idea very naturally offers itself to a Woman who represents to herself the Body of her Husband dash'd to pieces and all his Limbs dragg'd upon the Ground uncover'd and nothing is more proper to excite Pity 'Tis well known that it was anciently the Custom among Princesses and great Ladies to have large Quantities of Stuffs and Moveables This Provision was more necessary in those Times than now because of the great Consumption made of them on those Occasions of Mourning  I am of Opinion that  Homer  had a farther View in expatiating thus largely upon the Death of  Hector  Every Word that  Hecuba Priam  and  Andromache  speaks shews us the Importance of  Hector  Every Word adds a Weight to the concluding Action of his Poem and at the same time represents the sad Effects of the Anger of  Achilles  which is the Subject of it  THE TWENTYTHIRD BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Funeral of  Patroclus  ACHILLES  and the  Myrmidons  do Honours to the Body of  Patroclus  After the funeral Feast he retires to the SeaShore where falling asleep the Ghost of his Friend appears to him and demands the Rites of Burial the next Morning the Soldiers are sent with Mules and Waggons to fetch Wood for the Pyre The funeral Procession and the offering of their Hair to the Dead  Achilles  sacrifices several Animals and lastly twelve  Trojan  Captives at the Pile then sets fire to it He pays Libations to the Winds which at the instance of  Iris  rise and raise the Flames When the Pile has burn'd all Night they gather the Bones place 'em in an Urn of Gold and raise the Tomb  Achilles  institutes the funeral Games The Chariot Race the Fight of the  Caestus  the Wrestling the FootRace the single Combate the  Discus  the shooting with Arrows the darting the Javelin The various Descriptions of which and the various Success of the several Antagonists make the greatest part of the Book  In this Book ends the thirtieth Day The Night following the Ghost of  Patroclus  appears to  Achilles  The one and thirtieth Day is employ'd in felling the Timber for the Pile the two and thirtieth in burning it and the three and thirtieth in the Games The Scene is generally on the SeaShore  THE TWENTYTHIRD BOOK OF THE ILIAD  THUS humbled in the Dust the pensive Train  Thro' the sad City mourn'd her Hero slain  The Body soil'd with Dust and black with Gore  Lyes on broad  Hellespont  's resounding Shore  The  Grecians  seek their Ships and clear the Strand  All but the martial  Myrmidonian  Band  These yet assembled great  Achilles  holds  And the stern purpose of his Mind unfolds  Not yet my brave Companions of the War  Release your smoaking Coursers from the Car  But with his Chariot each in order led  Perform due Honours to  Patroclus  dead  E'er yet from Rest or Food we seek Relief  Some Rites remain to glut our Rage of Grief  The Troops obey'd and thrice in order led    Achilles  first their Coursers round the Dead  And thrice their Sorrows and Laments renew  Tears drop the Sands and Tears their Arms bedew  For such a Warrior  Thetis  aids their Woe  Melts their strong Hearts and bids their Eyes to flow  But chief  Pelides  thicksucceeding Sighs  Burst from his Heart and Torrents from his Eyes  His slaught'ring Hands yet red with Blood he laid  On his dead Friend's cold Breast and thus he said  All hail  Patroclus  let thy honour'd Ghost  Hear and rejoice on  Pluto  's dreary Coast  Behold  Achilles'  Promise is compleat  The bloody  Hector  stretch'd before thy Feet  Lo to the Dogs his Carcass I resign  And twelve sad Victims of the  Trojan  Line  Sacred to Vengeance instant shall expire  Their Lives effus'd around thy fun'ral Pyre  Gloomy he said and horrible to view  Before the Bier the bleeding  Hector  threw  Prone on the Dust The  Myrmidons  around  Unbrac'd their Armour and the Steeds unbound  All to  Achilles'  sable Ship repair  Frequent and full the genial Feast to share  Now from the wellfed Swine black Smokes aspire  The bristly Victims hissing o'er the Fire  The huge Ox bellowing falls with feebler cries  Expires the Goat the Sheep in Silence dies  Around the Hero's prostrate Body flow'd  In one promiscuous Stream the reeking Blood  And now a Band of  Argive  Monarchs brings  The glorious Victor to the King of Kings  From his dead Friend the pensive Warrior went  With Steps unwilling to the regal Tent  Th' attending Heralds as by Office bound  With kindled Flames the TripodVase surround  To cleanse his conqu'ring Hands from hostile Gore  They urg'd in vain the Chief refus'd and swore  No Drop shall touch me by almighty  Jove  The first and greatest of the Gods above  Till on the Pyre I place thee till I rear  The grassy Mound and clip thy sacred Hair  Some Ease at least those pious Rites may give  And sooth my Sorrows while I bear to live  Howe'er reluctant as I am I stay  And share your Feast but with the Dawn of Day  O King of Men it claims thy royal Care  That  Greece  the Warrior's fun'ral Pile prepare  And bid the Forests fall Such Rites are paid  To Heroes slumb'ring in Eternal Shade  Then when his earthly Part shall mount in Fire  Let the leagu'd Squadrons to their Posts retire  He spoke they hear him and the Word obey  The Rage of Hunger and of Thirst allay  Then ease in Sleep the Labours of the Day  But great  Pelides  stretch'd along the Shore  Where dash'd on Rocks the broken Billows roar  Lies inly groaning while on either Hand  The martial  Myrmidons  confus'dly stand  Along the Grass his languid Members fall  Tir'd with his Chase around the  Trojan  Wall  Hush'd by the Murmurs of the rolling Deep  At length he sinks in the soft Arms of Sleep  When lo the Shade before his closing Eyes  Of sad  Patroclus  rose or seem'd to rise  In the same Robe the Living wore he came  In Stature Voice and pleasing Look the same  The Form familiar hover'd o'er his Head  And sleeps  Achilles  thus the Phantom said  Sleeps my  Achilles  his  Patroclus  dead  Living I seem'd his dearest tend'rest Care  But now forgot I wander in the Air  Let my pale Corse the Rites of Burial know  And give me Entrance in the Realms below  Till then the Spirit finds no resting place  But here and there th' unbody'd Spectres chace  The vagrant Dead around the dark Abode  Forbid to cross th' irremeable Flood  Now give thy Hand for to the farther Shore  When once we pass the Soul returns no more  When once the last Funereal Flames ascend  No more shall meet  Achilles  and his Friend  No more our Thoughts to those we lov'd make known  Or quit the dearest to converse alone  Me Fate has sever'd from the Sons of Earth  The Fate foredoom'd that waited from my Birth  Thee too it waits before the  Trojan  Wall  Ev'n great and godlike Thou art doom'd to fall  Hear then and as in Fate and Love we joyn  Ah suffer that my Bones may rest with thine  Together have we liv'd together bred  One House receiv'd us and one Table fed  That golden Urn thy Goddess Mother gave  May mix our Ashes in one common Grave  And is it thou he answers to my Sight  Once more return'st thou from the Realms of Night  Oh more than Brother Think each Office paid  Whate'er can rest a discontented Shade  But grant one last Embrace unhappy Boy  Afford at least that melancholy joy  He said and with his longing Arms essay'd  In vain to grasp the visionary Shade  Like a thin Smoke he sees the Spirit fly  And hears a feeble lamentable Cry  Confus'd he wakes Amazement breaks the Bands  Of golden Sleep and starting from the Sands  Pensive he muses with uplifted Hands  'Tis true 'tis certain Man tho' dead retains  Part of himself th'immortal Mind remains  The Form subsists without the Body's Aid  Aerial Semblance and an empty Shade  This night my Friend so late in Battel lost  Stood at my side a pensive plaintive Ghost  Ev'n now familiar as in Life he came  Alas how diff'rent yet how like the same  Thus while he spoke each Eye grew big with Tears  And now the rosyfinger'd Morn appears  Shews every mournful Face with Tears o'erspread  And glares on the pale Visage of the Dead  But  Agamemnon  as the Rites demand  With Mules and Waggons sends a chosen Band  To load the Timber and the Pile to rear  A Charge consign'd to  Merion  's faithful Care  With proper Instruments they take the Road  Axes to cut and Ropes to sling the Load  First march the heavy Mules securely slow  O'er Hills o'er Dales o'er Crags o'er Rocks they go  Jumping high o'er the Shrubs of the rough Ground  Rattle the clatt'ring Cars and the shockt Axles bound  But when arriv'd at  Ida  's spreading Woods  Fair  Ida  water'd with descending Floods  Loud sounds the Axe redoubling Strokes on Strokes  On all sides round the Forest hurles her Oaks  Headlong Deepechoing groan the Thickets brown  Then rustling crackling crashing thunder down  The Wood the  Grecians  cleave prepar'd to burn  And the slow Mules the same rough Road return  The sturdy Woodmen equal Burthens bore  Such charge was giv'n 'em to the sandy Shore  There on the Spot which great  Achilles  show'd  They eas'd their Shoulders and dispos'd the Load  Circling around the Place where Times to come  Shall view  Patroclus'  and  Achilles'  Tomb  The Hero bids his martial Troops appear  High on their Cars in all the Pomp of War  Each in refulgent Arms his Limbs attires  All mount their Chariots Combatants and Squires  The Chariots first proceed a shining Train  Then Clouds of Foot that smoak along the Plain  Next these a melancholy Band appear  Amidst lay dead  Patroclus  on the Bier  O'er all the Corse their scatter'd Locks they throw  Achilles  next opprest with mighty Woe  Supporting with his Hands the Hero's Head  Bends o'er th' extended Body of the Dead  The Body decent on th' appointed Ground  They place and heap the Sylvan Pile around  But great  Achilles  stands apart in Pray'r  And from his Head divides the yellow Hair  The curling Locks which from his Youth he vow'd  And sacred grew to  Sperchius  honour'd Flood  Then sighing to the Deep his Looks he cast  And roll'd his Eyes around the wat'ry Waste  Sperchius  whose Waves in mazy Errors lost  Delightful roll along my native Coast  To whom we vainly vow'd at our return  These Locks to fall and Hecatombs to burn  Full fifty Rams to bleed in Sacrifice  Where to the Day thy silver Fountains rise  And where in Shade of consecrated Bow'rs  Thy Altars stand perfum'd with native Flow'rs  So vow'd my Father but he vow'd in vain  No more  Achilles  sees his native Plain  In that vain Hope these Hairs no longer grow  Patroclus  bears them to the Shades below  Thus o'er  Patroclus  while the Hero pray'd  On his cold Hand the sacred Lock he laid  Once more afresh the  Grecian  Sorrows flow  And now the Sun had set upon their Woe  But to the King of Men thus spoke the Chief  Enough  Atrides  give the Troops Relief  Permit the mourning Legions to retire  And let the Chiefs alone attend the Pyre  The pious Care be ours the Dead to burn  He said The People to their Ships return  While those deputed to inter the Slain  Heap with a rising Pyramid the Plain  A hundred Foot in length a hundred wide  The growing Structure spreads on ev'ry Side  High on the Top the manly Corse they lay  And wellfed Sheep and sable Oxen slay  Achilles  cover'd with their Fat the Dead  And the pil'd Victims round the Body spread  Then Jars of Honey and of fragrant Oil  Suspends around lowbending o'er the Pile  Four sprightly Coursers with a deadly Groan  Pour forth their Lives and on the Pyre are thrown  Of nine large Dogs domestick at his Board  Fall two selected to attend their Lord  Then last of all and horrible to tell  Sad Sacrifice twelve  Trojan  Captives fell  On these the Rage of Fire victorious preys  Involves and joins them in one common Blaze  Smear'd with the bloody Rites he stands on high  And calls the Spirit with a dreadful Cry  All hail  Patroclus  let thy vengeful Ghost  Hear and exult on  Pluto  's dreary Coast  Behold  Achilles'  Promise fully paid  Twelve  Trojan  Heroes offer'd to thy Shade  But heavier Fates on  Hector  's Corse attend  Sav'd from the Flames for hungry Dogs to rend  So spake he threat'ning But the Gods made vain  His Threat and guard inviolate the Slain  Celestial  Venus  hover'd o'er his Head  And roseate Unguents heav'nly Fragrance shed  She watch'd him all the Night and all the Day  And drove the Bloodhounds from their destin'd Prey  Nor sacred  Phoebus  less employ'd his Care  He pour'd around a Veil of gather'd Air  And kept the Nerves undry'd the Flesh entire  Against the Solar Beam and  Sirian  Fire  Nor yet the Pile where dead  Patroclus  lies  Smokes nor as yet the sullen Flames arise  But fast beside  Achilles  stood in Pray'r  Invok'd the Gods whose Spirit moves the Air  And Victims promis'd and Libations cast  To gentle  Zephyr  and the  Boreal  Blast  He call'd th' Aerial Pow'rs along the Skies  To breathe and whisper to the Fires to rise  The winged  Iris  heard the Hero's Call  And instant hasten'd to their airy Hall  Where in old  Zephyr  's open Courts on high  Sate all the blustring Brethren of the Sky  She shone amidst them on her painted Bow  The rocky Pavement glitter'd with the Show  All from the Banquet rise and each invites  The Various Goddess to partake the Rites  Not so the Dame reply'd I haste to go  To sacred Ocean and the Floods below  Ev'n now our solemn Hecatombs attend  And Heav'n is feasting on the World's green End  With righteous  Aethiops  uncorrupted Train  Far on th'extreamest Limits of the Main  But  Peleus'  Son intreats with Sacrifice  The  Western Spirit  and the  North  to rise  Let on  Patroclus'  Pile your Blast be driv'n  And bear the blazing Honours high to Heav'n  Swift as the Word she vanish'd from their View  Swift as the Word the  Winds  tumultuous flew  Forth burst the stormy Band with thundring Roar  And Heaps on Heaps the Clouds are tost before  To the wide Main then stooping from the Skies  The heaving Deeps in wat'ry Mountains rise  Troy  feels the Blast along her shaking Walls  Till on the Pyle the gather'd Tempest falls  The Structure crackles in the roaring Fires  And all the Night the plenteous Flame aspires  All Night  Achilles  hails  Patroclus  Soul  With large Libation from the golden Bowl  As a poor Father helpless and undone  Mourns o'er the Ashes of an only Son  Takes a sad Pleasure the last Bones to burn  And pour in Tears e'er yet they close the Urn  So stay'd  Achilles  circling round the Shore  So watch'd the Flames till now they flam'd no more  'Twas when emerging thro' the Shades of Night  The Morning Planet told th'approach of Light  And fast behind  Aurora  's warmer Ray  O'er the broad Ocean pour'd the golden Day  Then sunk the Blaze the Pyle no longer burn'd  And to their Caves the whistling  Winds  return'd  Across the  Thracian  Seas their Course they bore  The ruffled Seas beneath their Passage roar  Then parting from the Pyle he ceas'd to weep  And sunk to Quiet in th' Embrace of Sleep  Exhausted with his Grief Meanwhile the Crowd  Of thronging  Grecians  round  Achilles  stood  The Tumult wak'd him From his Eyes he shook  Unwilling Slumber and the Chiefs bespoke  Ye Kings and Princes of th'  Achaian  Name  First let us quench the yetremaining Flame  With sable Wine then as the Rites direct  The Hero's Bones with careful view select  Apart and easy to be known they lye  Amidst the Heap and obvious to the Eye  The rest around the Margins will be seen  Promiscuous Steeds and immolated Men  These wrapt in double Cauls of Fat prepare  And in the golden Vase dispose with Care  There let them rest with decent Honour laid  Till I shall follow to th'Infernal Shade  Meantime erect the Tomb with pious Hands  A common Structure on the humble Sands  Hereafter  Greece  some nobler Work may raise  And late Posterity record our Praise  The  Greeks  obey where yet the Embers glow  Wide o'er the Pyle the sable Wine they throw  And deep subsides the ashy Heap below  Next the white Bones his sad Companions place  With Tears collected in the golden Vase  The sacred Relicks to the Tent they bore  The Urn a Veil of Linen cover'd o'er  That done they bid the Sepulchre aspire  And cast the deep Foundations round the Pyre  High in the midst they heap the swelling Bed  Of rising Earth Memorial of the Dead  The swarming Populace the Chief detains  And leads amidst a wide Extent of Plains  There plac'd 'em round Then from the Ships proceeds  A Train of Oxen Mules and stately Steeds  Vases and Tripods for the Fun'ral Games  Resplendent Brass and more resplendent Dames  First stood the Prizes to reward the Force  Of rapid Racers in the dusty Course  A Woman for the first in Beauty's Bloom  Skill'd in the Needle and the lab'ring Loom  And a large Vase where two bright Handles rise  Of twenty Measures its capacious Size  The second Victor claims a Mare unbroke  Big with a Mule unknowing of the Yoke  The third a Charger yet untouch'd by Flame  Four ample Measures held the shining Frame  Two golden Talents for the fourth were plac'd  An ample double Bowl contents the last  These in fair Order rang'd upon the Plain  The Hero rising thus addrest the Train  Behold the Prizes valiant  Greeks  decreed  To the brave Rulers of the racing Steed  Prizes which none beside our self could gain  Should our immortal Coursers take the Plain  A Race unrival'd which from Ocean's God  Peleus  receiv'd and on his Son bestow'd  But this no time our Vigour to display  Nor suit with them the Games of this sad Day  Lost is  Patroclus  now that wont to deck  Their flowing Manes and sleek their glossy Neck  Sad as they shar'd in human Grief they stand  And trail those graceful Honours on the Sand  Let others for the noble Task prepare  Who trust the Courser and the flying Car  Fir'd at his Word the Rival Racers rise  But far the first  Eumelus  hopes the Prize  Fam'd thro'  Pieria  for the fleetest Breed  And skill'd to manage the highbounding Steed  With equal Ardor bold  Tydides  swell'd  The Steeds of  Tros  beneath his Yoke compell'd  Which late obey'd the  Dardan  Chief's Command  When scarce a God redeem'd him from his Hand  Then  Menelaus  his  Podargus  brings  And the fam'd Courser of the King of Kings  Whom rich  Echepolus  more rich than brave  To 'scape the Wars to  Agamemnon  gave    Aethe  her Name at home to end his Days  Base Wealth preferring to eternal Praise  Next him  Antilochus  demands the Course  With beating Heart and chears his  Pylian  Horse  Experienc'd  Nestor  gives the Son the Reins  Directs his Judgment and his Heat restrains  Nor idly warns the hoary Sire nor hears  The prudent Son with unattending Ears  My Son tho' youthful Ardor fire thy Berast  The Gods have lov'd thee and with Arts have blest  Neptune  and  Jove  on thee conferr'd the Skill  Swift round the Goal to turn the flying Wheel  To guide thy Conduct little Precept needs  But slow and past their Vigour are my Steeds  Fear not thy Rivals tho' for Swiftness known  Compare those Rivals Judgment and thy own  It is not Strength but Art obtains the Prize  And to be swift is less than to be wise  'Tis more by Art than Force of num'rous Strokes  The dext'rous Woodman shapes the stubborn Oaks  By Art the Pilot thro' the boiling Deep  And howling Tempest stears the fearless Ship  And 'tis the Artist wins the glorious Course  Not those who trust in Chariots and in Horse  In vain unskilfull to the Goal they strive  And short or wide th'ungovern'd Courser drive  While with sure Skill tho' with inferior Steeds  The knowing Racer to his End proceeds  Fix'd on the Goal his Eye foreruns the Course  His Hand unerring steers the steady Horse  And now contracts or now extends the Rein  Observing still the foremost on the Plain  Mark then the Goal 'tis easy to be found  Yon' aged Trunk a Cubit from the Ground  Of some oncestately Oak the last Remains  Or hardy Fir unperish'd with the Rains  Inclos'd with Stones conspicuous from afar  And round a Circle for the wheeling Car  Some Tomb perhaps of old the Dead to grace  Or then as now the Limit of a Race  Bear close to this and warily proceed  A little bending to the lefthand Steed  But urge the Right and give him all the Reins  While thy strict Hand his Fellows Head restrains  And turns him short till doubling as they roll  The Wheel's round Naves appear to brush the Goal  Yet not to break the Car or lame the Horse  Clear of the stony Heap direct the Course  Lest thro' Incaution failing thou may'st be  A Joy to others a Reproach to me  So shalt thou pass the Goal secure of Mind  And leave unskilful Swiftness far behind  Tho' thy fierce Rival drove the matchless Steed  Which bore  Adrastus  of celestial Breed  Or the fam'd Race thro' all the Regions known  That whirl'd the Car of proud  Laomedon  Thus nought unsaid the muchadvising Sage  Concludes then sate stiff with unwieldy Age  Next bold  Meriones  was seen to rise  The last but not least ardent for the Prize  They mount their Seats the Lots their Place dispose  Roll'd in his Helmet these  Achilles  throws  Young  Nestor  leads the Race  Eumelus  then  And next the Brother of the King of Men  Thy Lot  Meriones  the fourth was cast  And far the bravest  Diomed  was last  They stand in order an impatient Train  Pelides  points the Barrier on the Plain  And sends before old  Phoenix  to the Place  To mark the Racers and to judge the Race  At once the Coursers from the Barrier bound  The lifted Scourges all at once resound  Their Heart their Eyes their Voice they send before  And up the Champain thunder from the Shore  Thick where they drive the dusty Clouds arise  And the lost Courser in the Whirlwind flies  Loose on their Shoulders the long Manes reclin'd  Float in their Speed and dance upon the Wind  The smoaking Chariots rapid as they bound  Now seem to touch the Sky and now the Ground  While hot for Fame and Conquest all their Care  Each o'er his flying Courser hung in Air  Erect with Ardour pois'd upon the Rein  They pant they stretch they shout along the Plain  Now the last Compass fetch'd around the Goal  At the near Prize each gathers all his Soul  Each burns with double Hope with double Pain  Tears up the Shore and thunders tow'rd the Main  First flew  Eumelus  on  Pheretian  Steeds  With those of  Tros  bold  Diomed  succeeds  Close on  Eumelus'  Back they puff the Wind  And seem just mounting on his Car behind  Full on his Neck he feels the sultry Breeze  And hov'ring o'er their stretching Shadows sees  Then had he lost or left a doubtful Prize  But angry  Phoebus  to  Tydides  flies  Strikes from his Hand the Scourge and renders vain  His matchless Horses labour on the Plain  Rage fills his Eye with Anguish to survey  Snatch'd from his Hope the Glories of the Day  The Fraud celestial  Pallas  sees with Pain  Springs to her Knight and gives the Scourge again  And fills his Steeds with Vigour At a Stroke  She breaks his Rivals Chariot from the Yoke  No more their Way the startled Horses held  The Car revers'd came rat'ling on the Field  Shot headlong from his Seat beside the Wheel  Prone on the Dust th' unhappy Master fell  His batter'd Face and Elbows strike the Ground  Nose Mouth and Front one undistinguish'd Wound  Grief stops his Voice a Torrent drowns his Eyes  Before him far the glad  Tydides  flies  Minerva  's Spirit drives his matchless Pace  And crowns him Victor of the labour'd Race  The next tho' distant  Menelas  succeeds  While thus young  Nestor  animates his Steeds  Now now my gen'rous Pair exert your Force  Not that we hope to match  Tydides'  Horse  Since great  Minerva  wings their rapid Way  And gives their Lord the Honours of the Day  But reach  Atrides  Shall his Mare outgo  Your Swiftness Vanquish'd by a female Foe  Thro' your neglect if lagging on the Plain  The last ignoble Gift be all we gain  No more shall  Nestor  's Hand your Food supply  The old Man's Fury rises and ye die  Haste then yon' narrow Road before our Sight  Presents th' occasion could we use it right  Thus He The Coursers at their Master's Threat  With quicker Steps the sounding Champain beat  And now  Antilochus  with nice survey  Observes the Compass of the hollow way  'Twas where by Force of wintry Torrents torn  Fast by the Road a Precipice was worn  Here where but one could pass to shun the Throng  The  Spartan  Hero's Chariot smoak'd along  Close up the vent'rous Youth resolves to keep  Still edging near and bears him tow'rd the Steep  Atrides  trembling casts his Eye below  And wonders at the Rashness of his Foe  Hold stay your SteedsWhat Madness thus to ride  This narrow way Take larger Field he cry'd  Or both mull fall  Atrides  cry'd in vain  He flies more fast and throws up all the Rein  Far as an able Arm the Disk can send  When youthful Rivals their full Force extend  So far  Antilochus  thy Chariot flew  Before the King He cautious backward drew  His Horse compell'd foreboding in his Fears  The rattling Ruin of the clashing Cars  The flound'ring Coursers rolling on the Plain  And Conquest lost thro' frantick Haste to gain  But thus upbraids his Rival as he flies  Go furious Youth ungen'rous and unwise  Go but expect not I'll the Prize resign  Add Perjury to Fraud and make it thine  Then to his Steeds with all his Force he cries  Be swift be vig'rous and regain the Prize  Your Rivals destitute of youthful Force  With fainting Knees shall labour in the Course  And yield the Glory yoursThe Steeds obey  Already at their Heels they wing their Way  And seem already to retrieve the Day  Meantime the  Grecians  in a Ring beheld  The Coursers bounding o'er the dusty Field  The first who markd them was the  Cretan  King  High on a rising Ground above the Ring  The Monarch sate from whence with sure survey  He well observ'd the Chief who led the way  And heard from far his animating Cries  And saw the foremost Steed with sharpen'd Eyes  On whose broad Front a Blaze of shining white  Like the full Moon stood obvious to the Sight  He saw and rising to the  Greeks  begun  Are yonder Horse discern'd by me alone  Or can ye all another Chief survey  And other Steeds than lately led the Way  Those tho' the swiftest by some God withheld  Lie sure disabled in the middle Field  For since the Goal they doubled round the Plain  I search to find them but I search in vain  Perchance the Reins forsook the Driver's Hand  And turn'd too short he tumbled on the Strand  Shot from the Chariot while his Coursers stray  With frantick Fury from the destin'd Way  Rise then some other and inform my Sight  For these dim Eyes perhaps discern not right  Yet sure he seems to judge by Shape and Air  The great  Aetolian  Chief renown'd in War  Old Man  Oïleus  rashly thus replies  Thy Tongue too hastily confers the Prize  Of those who view the Course not sharpest ey'd  Nor youngest yet the readiest to decide  Eumelus'  Steeds highbounding in the Chace  Still as at first unrivall'd lead the Race  I well discern him as he shakes the Rein  And hear his Shouts victorious o'er the Plain  Thus he  Idomeneus  incens'd rejoin'd  Barb'rous of Words and arrogant of Mind  Contentious Prince of all the  Greeks  beside  The last in Merit as the first in Pride  To vile Reproach what Answer can we make  A Goblet or a Tripod let us stake  And be the King the Judge The most unwise  Will learn their Rashness when they pay the Price  He said and  Ajax  by mad Passion born  Stern had reply'd fierce Scorn inhancing Scorn  To fell extreams But  Thetis'  godlike Son  Awful amidst them rose and thus begun  Forbear ye Chiefs reproachful to contend  Much would ye blame should others thus offend  And lo th'approaching Steeds your Contest end  No sooner had he spoke but thund'ring near  Drives thro' a Stream of Dust the Charioteer  High o'er his Head the circling Lash he wields  His bounding Horses scarcely touch the Fields  His Car amidst the dusty Whirlwind roll'd  Bright with the mingled Blaze of Tin and Gold  Refulgent thro' the Cloud no Eye could find  The Track his flying Wheels had left behind  And the fierce Coursers urg'd their rapid Pace  So swift it seem'd a Flight and not a Race  Now Victor at the Goal  Tydides  stands  Quits his bright Car and springs upon the Sands  From the hot Steeds the sweaty Torrents stream  The wellply'd Whip is hung athwart the Beam  With Joy brave  Sthenelus  receives the Prize  The TripodVase and Dame with radiant Eyes  These to the Ships his Train triumphant leads  The Chief himself unyokes the panting Steeds  Young  Nestor  follows who by Art not Force  O'erpast  Atrides  second in the Course  Behind  Atrides  urg'd the Race or more near  Than to the Courser in his swift Career  The following Car just touching with his Heel  And brushing with his Tail the whirling Wheel  Such and so narrow now the Space between  The Rivals late so distant on the Green  So soon swift  Aethe  her lost Ground regain'd  One Length one Moment had the Race obtain'd  Merion  pursu'd at greater Distance still  With tardier Coursers and inferior Skill  Last came  Admetus  thy unhappy Son  Slow dragg'd the Steeds his batter'd Chariot on  Achilles  saw and pitying thus begun  Behold the Man whose matchless Art surpast  The Sons of  Greece  the ablest yet the last  Fortune denies but Justice bids us pay  Since great  Tydides  bears the first away  To him the second Honours of the Day  The  Greeks  consent with loud applauding Cries  And then  Eumelus  had receiv'd the Prize  But youthful  Nestor  jealous of his Fame  Th' Award opposes and asserts his Claim  Think not he cries I tamely will resign  O  Peleus  Son the Mare so justly mine  What if the Gods the Skilful to confound  Have thrown the Horse and Horseman to the Ground  Perhaps he sought not Heav'n by Sacrifice  And Vows omitted forfeited the Prize  If yet Distinction to thy Friend to show  And please a Soul desirous to bestow  Some Gift must grace  Eumelus  view thy Store  Of beauteous Handmaids Steeds and shining Ore  An ample Present let him thence receive  And  Greece  shall praise thy gen'rous Thirst to give  But this my Prize I never shall forego  This who but touches Warriors is my Foe  Thus spake the Youth nor did his Words offend  Pleas'd with the wellturn'd Flattery of a Friend  Achilles  smil'd The Gift propos'd he cry'd  Antilochus  we shall our self provide  With Plates of Brass the Corselet cover'd o'er  The same renown'd  Asteropaeus  wore  Whose glitt'ring Margins rais'd with Silver shine  No vulgar Gift  Eumelus  shall be thine  He said  Automedon  at his Command  The Corselet brought and gave it to his Hand  Distinguish'd by his Friend his Bosom glows  With gen'rous Joy Then  Menelaus  rose  The Herald plac'd the Sceptre in his Hands  And still'd the Clamour of the shouting Bands  Not without Cause incens'd at  Nestor  's Son  And inly grieving thus the King begun  The Praise of Wisdom in thy Youth obtain'd  An Act so rash  Antilochus  has stain'd  Robb'd of my Glory and my just Reward  To you O  Grecians  be my Wrong declar'd  So not a Leader shall our Conduct blame  Or judge me envious of a Rival's Fame  But shall not we ourselves the Truth maintain  What needs appealing in a Fact so plain  What  Greek  shall blame me if I bid thee rise  And vindicate by Oath th'illgotten Prize  Rise if thou dar'st before thy Chariot stand  The driving Scourge highlifted in thy Hand  And touch thy Steeds and swear thy whole Intent  Was but to conquer not to circumvent  Swear by that God whose liquid Arms surround  The Globe and whose dread Earthquakes heave the Ground  The prudent Chief with calm Attention heard  Then mildly thus Excuse if Youth have err'd  Superior as thou art forgive th'Offence  Nor I thy Equal or in Years or Sense  Thou know'st the Errors of unripen'd Age  Weak are its Counsels headlong is its Rage  The Prize I quit if thou thy Wrath resign  The Mare or ought thou ask'st be freely thine  E'er I become from thy dear Friendship torn  Hateful to thee and to the Gods forsworn  So spoke  Antilochus  and at the Word  The Mare contested to the King restor'd  Joy swells his Soul as when the vernal Grain  Lifts the green Ear above the springing Plain  The Fields their Vegetable Life renew  And laugh and glitter with the Morning Dew  Such Joy the  Spartan  's shining Face o'erspread  And lifted his gay Heart while thus he said  Still may our Souls O gen'rous Youth agree  'Tis now  Atrides'  turn to yield to thee  Rash Heat perhaps a Moment might controul  Not break the settled Temper of thy Soul  Not but my Friend 'tis still the wiser way  To wave Contention with superior Sway  For ah how few who should like thee offend  Like thee have Talents to regain the Friend  To plead Indulgence and thy Fault attone  Suffice thy Father's Merits and thy own  Gen'rous alike for me the Sire and Son  Have greatly suffer'd and have greatly done  I yield that all may know my Soul can bend  Nor is my Pride preferr'd before my Friend  He said and pleas'd his Passion to command  Resign'd the Courser to  Noëmon  's Hand  Friend of the youthful Chief Himself content  The shining Charger to his Vessel sent  The golden Talents  Merion  next obtain'd  The fifth Reward the double Bowl remain'd  Achilles  this to rev'rend  Nestor  bears  And thus the purpose of his Gift declares  Accept thou this O sacred Sire he said  In dear Memorial of  Patroclus  dead  Dead and for ever lost  Patroclus  lies  For ever snatch'd from our desiring Eyes  Take thou this Token of a grateful Heart  Tho' 'tis not thine to hurl the distant Dart  The Quoit to toss the pond'rous Mace to wield  Or urge the Race or wrestle on the Field  Thy present Vigour Age has overthrown  But left the Glory of the past thy own  He said and plac'd the Goblet at his side  With Joy the venerable King reply'd  Wisely and well my Son thy Words have prov'd  A Senior honour'd and a Friend belov'd  Too true it is deserted of my Strength  These wither'd Arms and Limbs have fail'd at length  Oh had I now that Force I felt of yore  Known thro'  Buprasium  and the  Pylian  Shore  Victorious then in ev'ry solemn Game  Ordain'd to  Amarynces'  mighty Name  The brave  Epeians  gave my Glory way  Aetolians Pylians  all resign'd the Day  I quell'd  Clytomedes  in Fights of Hand  And backward hurl'd  Ancaeus  on the Sand  Surpast  Iphyclus  in the swift Career  Phyleus  and  Polydorus  with the Spear  The Sons of  Actor  won the Prize of Horse  But won by Numbers not by Art or Force  For the fam'd Twins impatient to survey  Prize after Prize by  Nestor  born away  Sprung to their Car and with united Pains  One lash'd the Coursers while one rul'd the Reins  Such once I was Now to these Tasks succeeds  A younger Race that emulate our Deeds  I yield alas to Age who must not yield  Tho' once the foremost Hero of the Field  Go thou my Son by gen'rous Friendship led  With martial Honours decorate the Dead  While pleas'd I take the Gift thy Hands present  Pledge of Benevolence and kind Intent  Rejoic'd of all the num'rous  Greeks  to see  Not one but honours sacred Age and me  Those due distinctions thou so well can'st pay  May the just Gods return another Day  Proud of the Gift thus spake the Full of Days  Achilles  heard him prouder of the Praise  The Prizes next are order'd to the Field  For the bold Champions who the  Caestus  wield  A stately Mule as yet by Toils unbroke  Of six years Age unconscious of the Yoke  Is to the  Circus  led and firmly bound  Next stands a Goblet massy large and round  Achilles  rising thus Let  Greece  excite  Two Heroes equal to this hardy Fight  Who dares his Foe with lifted Arms provoke  And rush beneath the longdescending Stroke  On whom  Apollo  shall the Palm bestow  And whom the  Greeks  supreme by Conquest know  This Mule his dauntless Labours shall repay  The Vanquish'd bear the massy Bowl away  This dreadful Combate great  Epaeus  chose  High o'er the Crowd enormous Bulk he rose  And seiz'd the Beast and thus began to say  Stand forth some Man to bear the Bowl away  Price of his Ruin For who dares deny  This Mule my right th'undoubted Victor I  Others 'tis own'd in Fields of Battle shine  But the first Honours of this Fight are mine  For who excells in all Then let my Foe  Draw near but first his certain Fortune know  Secure this Hand shall his whole Frame confound  Mash all his Bones and all his Body pound  So let his Friends be nigh a needful Train  To heave the batter'd Carcase off the Plain  The Giant spoke and in a stupid Gaze  The Host beheld him silent with Amaze  'Twas thou  Euryalus  who durst aspire  To meet his Might and emulate thy Sire  The great  Mecistheus  who in Days of yore  In  Theban  Games the noblest Trophy bore  The Games ordain'd dead  Oedipus  to grace  And singly vanquish'd the  Cadmaean  Race  Him great  Tydides  urges to contend  Warm with the Hopes of Conquest for his Friend  Officious with the Cincture girds him round  And to his Wrists the Gloves of Death are bound  Amid the Circle now each Champion stands  And poises high in Air his Iron Hands  With clashing Gantlets now they fiercely close  Their crackling Jaws reechoe to the Blows  And painful Sweat from all their Members flows  At length  Epaeus  dealt a weighty Blow  Full on the Cheek of his unwary Foe  Beneath that pond'rous Arm's resistless Sway  Down dropt he nerveless and extended lay  As a large Fish when Winds and Waters roar  By some huge Billow dash'd against the Shore  Lies panting Not less batter'd with his Wound  The bleeding Hero pants upon the Ground  To rear his fallen Foe the Victor lends  Scornful his Hand and gives him to his Friends  Whose Arms support him reeling thro' the Throng  And dragging his disabled Legs along  Nodding his Head hangs down his Shoulder o'er  His Mouth and Nostrils pour the clotted Gore  Wrapt round in Mists he lies and lost to Thought  His Friends receive the Bowl too dearly bought  The third bold Game  Achilles  next demands  And calls the Wrestlers to the level Sands  A massy Tripod for the Victor lies  Of twice six Oxen its reputed Price  And next the Losers Spirits to restore  A female Captive valu'd but at four  Scarce did the Chief the vig'rous Strife propose  When tow'rlike  Ajax  and  Ulysses  rose  Amid the Ring each nervous Rival stands  Embracing rigid with implicit Hands  Close lock'd above their Heads and Arms are mixt  Below their planted Feet at distance fixt  Like two strong Rafters which the Builder forms  Proof to the wintry Winds and howling Storms  Their Tops connected but at wider space  Fixt on the Center stands their solid Base  Now to the Grasp each manly Body bends  The humid Sweat from ev'ry Pore descends  Their Bones resound with Blows Sides Shoulders Thighs  Swell to each Gripe and bloody Tumours rise  Nor could  Ulysses  for his Art renown'd  O'erturn the Strength of  Ajax  on the Ground  Nor could the Strength of  Ajax  overthrow  The watchful Caution of his artful Foe  While the long Strife ev'n tir'd the Lookerson  Thus to  Ulysses  spoke great  Telamon  Or let me lift thee Chief or lift thou me  Prove we our Force and  Jove  the rest decree  He said and straining heav'd him off the Ground  With matchless Strength that time  Ulysses  found  The Strength t'evade and where the Nerves combine  His Ankle strook The Giant fell supine  Ulysses  following on his Bosom lies  Shouts of Applause run rattling thro the Skies  Ajax  to lift  Ulysses  next essays  He barely stirr'd him but he could not raise  His Knee lock'd fast the Foe's Attempt deny'd  And grappling close they tumble side by side  Defil'd with honourable Dust they roll  Still breathing Strife and unsubdu'd of Soul  Again they rage again to Combat rise  When great  Achilles  thus divides the Prize  Your noble Vigour oh my Friends restrain  Nor weary out your gen'rous Strength in vain  Ye both have won Let others who excell  Now prove that Prowess you have prov'd so well  The Hero's Words the willing Chiefs obey  From their tir'd Bodies wipe the Dust away  And cloth'd anew the following Games survey  And now succeed the Gifts ordain'd to grace  The Youths contending in the rapid Race  A silver Urn that full six Measures held  By none in Weight or Workmanship excell'd  Sidonian  Artists taught the Frame to shine  Elaborate with Artifice divine  Whence  Tyrian  Sailors did the Prize transport  And gave to  Thoas  at the  Lemnian  Port  From him descended good  Eunaeus  heir'd  The glorious Gift and for  Lycaon  spar'd  To brave  Patroclus  gave the rich Reward  Now the same Hero's Funeral Rites to grace  It stands the Prize of Swiftness in the Race  A wellfed Ox was for the second plac'd  And half a Talent must content the last  Achilles  rising then bespoke the Train  Who hopes the Palm of Swiftness to obtain  Stand forth and bear these Prizes from the Plain  The Hero said and starting from his Place  Oïlean Ajax  rises to the Race  Ulysses  next and he whose Speed surpast  His youthful Equals  Nestor  's Son the last  Rang'd in a Line the ready Racers stand  Pelides  points the Barrier with his Hand  All start at once  Oïleus  led the Race  The next  Ulysses  meas'ring Pace with Pace  Behind him diligently close he sped  As closely following as the running Thread  The Spindle follows and displays the Charms  Of the fair Spinster's Breast and moving Arms  Graceful in Motion thus his Foe he plies  And treads each Footstep e'er the Dust can rise  His glowing Breath upon his Shoulders plays  Th'admiring  Greeks  loud Acclamations raise  To him they give their Wishes Hearts and Eyes  And send their Souls before him as he flies  Now three times turn'd in prospect of the Goal  The panting Chief to  Pallas  lifts his Soul  Assist O Goddess thus in Thought he pray'd  And present at his Thought defcends the Maid  Buoy'd by her heav'nly Force he seems to swim  And feels a Pinion lifting ev'ry Limb  All fierce and ready now the Prize to gain  Unhappy  Ajax  stumbles on the Plain  O'erturn'd by  Pallas  where the slipp'ry Shore  Was clogg'd with slimy Dung and mingled Gore  The selfsame Place beside  Patroclus'  Pyre  Where late the slaughter'd Victims fed the Fire  Besmear'd with Filth and blotted o'er with Clay  Obscene to sight the ruefull Racer lay  The wellfed Bull the second Prize he shar'd  And left the Urn  Ulysses'  rich Reward  Then grasping by the Horn the mighty Beast  The baffled Hero thus the  Greeks  addrest  Accursed Fate the Conquest I forego  A Mortal I a Goddess was my Foe  She urg'd her Fav'rite on the rapid Way  And  Pallas  not  Ulysses  won the Day  Thus fow'rly wail'd he sputt'ring Dirt and Gore  A burst of Laughter echo'd thro' the Shore  Antilochus  more hum'rous than the rest  Takes the last Prize and takes it with a Jest  Why with our wiser Elders should we strive  The Gods still love them and they always thrive  Ye see to  Ajax  I must yield the Prize  He to  Ulysses  still more ag'd and wise  A green old Age unconscious of Decays  That proves the Hero born in better Days  Behold his Vigor in this active Race  Achilles  only boasts a swifter Pace  For who can match  Achilles  He who can  Must yet be more than Hero or than Man  Th'Effect succeeds the Speech  Pelides  cries  Thy artful Praise deserves a better Prize  Nor  Greece  in vain shall hear thy Friend extoll'd  Receive a Talent of the purest Gold  The Youth departs content The Hosts admire  The Son of  Nestor  worthy of his Sire  Next these a Buckler Spear and Helm he brings  Cast on the Plain the brazen Burthen rings  Arms which of late divine  Sarpedon  wore  And great  Patroclus  in short Triumph bore  Stand forth the bravest of our Host he cries  Whoever dares deserve so rich a Prize  Now grace the Lists before our Army's Sight  And sheath'd in Steel provoke his Foe to fight  Who first the jointed Armour shall explore  And stain his Rival's Mail with issuing Gore  The Sword  Asteropeus  possest of old  A  Thracian  Blade distinct with Studs of Gold  Shall pay the Stroke and grace the Striker's Side  These Arms in common let the Chief divide  For each brave Champion when the Combat ends  A sumptuous Banquet at our Tent attends  Fierce at the Word uprose great  Tydeus'  Son  And the huge Bulk of  Ajax Telamon  Clad in refulgent Steel on either hand  The dreadful Chiefs amid the Circle stand  Low'ring they meet tremendous to the Sight  Each  Argive  Bosom beats with fierce Delight  Oppos'd in Arms not long they idly stood  But thrice they clos'd and thrice the Charge renew'd  A furious Pass the Spear of  Ajax  made  Thro' the broad Shield but at the Corselet stay'd  Not thus the Foe His Jav'lin aim'd above  The Buckler's Margin at the Neck he drove  But  Greece  now trembling for her Hero's Life  Bade share the Honours and surcease the Strife  Yet still the Victor's Due  Tydides  gains  With him the Sword and studded Belt remains  Then hurl'd the Hero thund'ring on the Ground  A Mass of Iron an enormous Round  Whose Weight and Size the circling  Greeks  admire  Rude from the Furnace and but shap'd by Fire  This mighty Quoit  Aëtion  wont to rear  And from his whirling Arm dismiss in Air  The Giant by  Achilles  slain he stow'd  Among his Spoils this memorable Load  For this he bids those nervous Artists vie  That teach the Disk to sound along the Sky  Let him whose Might can hurl this Bowl arise  Who farthest hurls it take it as his Prize  If he be one enrich'd with large Domain  Of Downs for Flocks and Arable for Grain  Small Stock of Iron needs that Man provide  His Hinds and Swains whole years shall be supply'd  From hence Nor ask the neighb'ring City's Aid  For Plowshares Wheels and all the rural Trade  Stern  Polyphaetes  stept before the Throng  And great  Leonteus  more than mortal strong  Whose Force with rival Forces to oppose  Uprose great  Ajax  up  Epaeus  rose  Each stood in order First  Epaeus  threw  High o'er the wond'ring Crowds the whirling Circle flew  Leonteus  next a little space surpast  And third the Strength of godlike  Ajax  cast  O'er both their Marks it flew till fiercely flung  From  Polypaetes  Arm the  Discus  sung  Far as a Swain his whirling Sheephook throws  That distant falls among the grazing Cows  So past them all the rapid Circle flies  His Friends while loud Applauses shake the Skies  With Force conjoin'd heave off the weighty Prize  Those who in skilful Archery contend  He next invites the twanging Bow to bend  And twice ten Axes casts amidst the Round  Ten doubleedg'd and ten that singly wound  The Mast which late a firstrate Galley bore  The Hero fixes in the sandy Shore  To the tall Top a milkwhite Dove they tye  The trembling Mark at which their Arrows fly  Whose Weapon strikes yon' flutt'ring Bird shall bear  These twoedg'd Axes terrible in War  The single he whose Shaft divides the Cord  He said Experienc'd  Merion  took the Word  And skilful  Teucer  In the Helm they threw  Their Lots inscrib'd and forth the latter flew  Swift from the String the sounding Arrow flies  But flies unblest No grateful Sacrifice  No firstling Lambs unheedful didst thou vow  To  Phoebus  Patron of the Shaft and Bow  For this thy wellaim'd Arrow turn'd aside  Err'd from the Dove yet cut the Cord that ty'd  Adown the Mainmast fell the parted String  And the free Bird to Heav'n displays her Wing  Seas Shores and Skies with loud Applause resound  And  Merion  eager meditates the Wound  He takes the Bow directs the Shaft above  And following with his Eye the soaring Dove  Implores the God to speed it thro' the Skies  With Vows of firstling Lambs and grateful Sacrifice  The Dove in airy Circles as she wheels  Amid the Clouds the piercing Arrow feels  Quite thro' and thro' the Point its Passage found  And at his Feet fell bloody to the Ground  The wounded Bird e'er yet she breath'd her last  With flagging Wings alighted on the Mast  A Moment hung and spread her Pinions there  Then sudden dropt and left her Life in Air  From the pleas'd Crowd new Peals of Thunder rise  And to the Ships brave  Merion  bears the Prize  To close the Fun'ral Games  Achilles  last  A massy Spear amid the Circle plac'd  And ample Charger of unsullyed Frame  With Flow'rs highwrought not blacken'd yet by Flame  For these he bids the Heroes prove their Art  Whose dext'rous Skill directs the flying Dart  Here too great  Merion  hopes the noble Prize  Nor here disdain'd the King of Men to rise  With Joy  Pelides  saw the Honour paid  Rose to the Monarch and respectful said  Thee first in Virtue as in Pow'r supreme  O King of Nations all thy  Greeks  proclaim  In ev'ry martial Game thy Worth attest  And know thee both their Greatest and their Best  Take then the Prize but let brave  Merion  bear  This beamy Jav'lin in thy Brother's War  Pleas'd from the Hero's Lips his Praise to hear  The King to  Merion  gives the brazen Spear  But set apart for sacred Use commands  The glitt'ring Charger to  Talthybius'  Hands  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TwentyThird Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TWENTYTHIRD BOOK  I  THIS and the following Book which contain the Description of the Funeral of  Patroclus  and other Matters relating to  Hector  are undoubtedly superadded to the grand Catastrophe of the Poem for the Story is compleatly finish'd with the Death of that Hero in the  d  Book Many judicious Criticks have been of opinion that  Homer  is blameable for protracting it  Virgil  closes the whole Scene of Action with the Death of  Turnus  and leaves the rest to be imagin'd by the Mind of the Reader He does not draw the Picture at full Length but delineates it so far that we cannot fail of imagining the whole Draught There is however one thing to be said in favour of  Homer  which may perhaps justify him in his Method that what he undertook was to paint the  Anger of  Achilles And as that Anger does not die with  Hector  but persecutes his very remains so the Poet still keeps up to his Subject nay it seems to require that he should carry down the Relation of that Resentment which is the Foundation of his Poem till it is fully satisfy'd And as this survives  Hector  and gives the Poet an Opportunity of still shewing many sad Effects of  Achilles  's Anger the two following Books may be thought not to be Excrescencies but essential to the Poem  Virgil  had been inexcusable had he trod in  Homer  's Footsteps for it is evident that the Fall of  Turnus  by giving  Aeneas  a full Power over  Italy  answers the whole Design and Intention of the Poem had he gone farther he had overshot his Mark And tho'  Homer  proceeds after  Hector  's Death yet the Subject is still the Anger of  Achilles  We are now past the War and Violence of the  Ilias  the Scenes of Blood are closed during the rest of the Poem we may look back with a pleasing kind of Horror upon the Anger of  Achilles  and see what dire Effects it has wrought in the compass of nineteen Days  Troy  and  Greece  are both in Mourning for it Heaven and Earth Gods and Men have suffer'd in the Conflict The Reader seems landed upon the Shore after a violent Storm and has Leisure to survey the Consequences of the Tempest and the Wreck occasion'd by the former Commotions  Troy  weeping for  Hector  and  Greece  for  Patroclus  Our Passions have been in an Agitation since the opening of the Poem wherefore the Poet like some great Master in Musick softens his Notes and melts his Readers into Tenderness and Pity  II  VERSE  Tears bathe their Arms and tears the Sands bedew  Thetis  aids their Woe    It is not easy to give a reason why  Thetis  should be said to excite the Grief of the  Myrmidons  and of  Achilles  it had seem'd more natural for the Mother to have compos'd the Sorrows of the Son and restored his troubled Mind to Tranquillity  But such a Procedure would have outrag'd the Character of  Achilles  who is all along describ'd to be of such a Violence of Temper that he is not easy to be pacify'd at any time much less upon so great an Incident as the Death of his Friend  Patroclus  Perhaps the Poet made use of this Fiction in honour of  Achilles  he makes every Passion of his Hero considerable his Sorrow as well as Anger is important and he cannot grieve but a Goddess attends him and a whole Army weeps  Some Commentators fancy'd that  Homer  animates the very Sands of the Seas and the Arms of the  Myrmidons  and makes them sensible of the Loss of  Patroclus  the preceding Words seem to strengthen that Opinion because the Poet introduces a Goddess to raise the Sorrow of the Army But  Eustathius  seems not to give into this Conjecture and I think very judiciously for what Relation is there between the Sands of the Shores and the Arms of the  Myrmidons  It would have been more poetical to have said the Sands and the Rocks than the Sands and the Arms but it is very natural to say that the Soldiers wept so bitterly that their Armour and the very Sands were wet with their Tears I believe this Remark will appear very just by reading the Verse with a Comma after  thus  Then the Construction will be natural and easy Period will answer Period in the  Greek  and the Sense in  English  will be the Sands were wet and the Arms were wet with the Tears of the Mourners  But however this be there is a very remarkable Beauty in the run of the Verse in  Homer  every Word has a melancholy Cadence and the Poet has not only made the Sands and the Arms but even his very Verse to lament with  Achilles  III  VERSE  His slaught'ring Hands yet red with Blood he laid  On his dead Friend's cold Breast    I could not pass by this Passage without observing to my Reader the great Beauty of this Epithet  An ordinary Poet would have contented himself with saying he laid his Hand upon the Breast of  Patroclus  but  Homer  knows how to raise the most trivial Circumstance and by adding this one Word he laid his  deadly  Hands or his  murderous  Hands on  Patroclus  Breast he fills our Minds with great Ideas and  by a single Epithet recalls to our Thoughts all the noble Atchievements of  Achilles  thro' the Iliad  IV  VERSE  All hail  Patroclus  c    There is in this Apostrophe of  Achilles  to the Ghost of  Patroclus  a sort of Savageness and a mixture of Softness and Atrocity which are highly conformable to his Character  Dacier  V  VERSE  To cleanse his conqu'ring Hands  The Chief refus'd    This is conformable to the Custom of the Orientals  Achilles  will not be induc'd to wash and afterwards retires to the Seashore and sleeps on the Ground It is just thus that  David  mourns in the Scriptures he refuses to wash or to take any Repast but retires from Company and lies upon the Earth  VI  VERSE  The Ghost of  Patroclus  Homer  has introduc'd into the former parts of the Poem the Personages of Gods and Goddesses from Heaven and of Furies from Hell He has embellished it with Ornaments from Earth Sea and Air and he here opens a new Scene and brings to the view a Ghost the Shade of the departed Friend By these Methods he diversifies his Poem with new and surprizing Circumstances and awakens the Attention of the Reader at the same time he very poetically adapts his Language to the Circumstances of this imaginary  Patroclus  and teaches us the Opinions that prevail'd in his time concerning the State of separate Souls  VII  VERSE  Forbid to pass th'irremeable Flood    It was the common Opinion of the Ancients that the Souls of the Departed were not admitted into the Number of the Happy till their Bodies had receiv'd the funeral Rites they suppos'd those that wanted them wander'd an hundred Years before they were wafted over the infernal River  Virgil  perhaps had this Passage of  Homer  in his view in the sixth  Aeneis  at least he coincides with his Sentiments concerning the State of the departed Souls  Haec omnis quam cernis inops inhumata{que} Turba est  Nec ripas datur horrendas nec rauca fluenta  Transportare priùs quàm sedibus ossa quierunt  Centum errant annos volitant{que} haec littora circum  Tum demum admissi stagna exoptata revisunt  It was during this Interval between their Death and the Rites of Funeral that they suppos'd the only Time allow'd for separate Spirits to appear to Men therefore  Patroclus  here tells his Friend  To the farther Shore  When once we pass the Soul returns no more  For the fuller understanding of  Homer  it is necessary to be acquainted with his Notion of the State of the Soul after Death He follow'd the Philosophy of the  Aegyptians  who suppos'd Man to be compounded of three Parts an intelligent Mind a Vehicle for that Mind and a Body the Mind they call'd  or  the Vehicle    Image  or  Soul  and the gross Body  The Soul in which the Mind was lodg'd was suppos'd exactly to resemble the Body in Shape Magnitude and Features for this being in the Body as the Statue in its Mold so soon as it goes forth is properly the Image of that Body in which it was enclos'd This it was that appear'd to  Achilles  with the full Resemblance of his Friend  Patroclus Vid Dacier  on the Life of  Pythagoras  p  VIII  VERSE  May mix our Ashes in one common Grave    There is something very pathetical in this whole Speech of  Patroclus  he begins it with kind Reproaches and blames  Achilles  with a friendly Tenderness he recounts to him the inseparable Affection that had been between them in their Lives and makes it his last Request that they may not be parted even in Death but that their Bones may rest in the same Urn The Speech itself is of a due Length it ought not to be very short because this Apparition is an Incident entirely different from any other in the whole Poem and consequently the Reader would not have been satisfy'd with a cursory mention of it neither ought it to be long because this would have been contrary to the Nature of such Apparitions whose Stay upon Earth has ever been describ'd as very short and consequently they cannot be suppos'd to use many Words  The Circumstance of being buried in the same Urn is entirely conformable to the Eastern Custom There are innumerable Instances in the Scriptures of great Personages being buried with their Fathers So  Joseph  would not suffer his Bones to rest in  Aegypt  but commands his Brethren to carry them into  Canaan  to the Buryingplace of his Father  Jacob  IX  VERSE  The Form subsists without the Body's Aid  Aerial Semblance and an empty Shade    The Words of  Homer  are  In which there seems to be a great Difficulty it being not casy to explain how  Achilles  can say that the Ghost of his Friend had no Understanding when it had but just made such a rational and moving Speech Especially when the Poet introduces the Apparition with the very Shape Air and Voice of  Patroclus  But this Passage will be clearly understood by explaining the Notion which the Ancients entertain'd of the Souls of the Departed according to the forecited triple Division of  Mind Image  and  Body  They imagin'd that the Soul was not only separated from the Body at the Hour of Death but that there was a farther Separation of the  or Understanding from its  or Vehicle so that while the  or Image of the Body was in Hell the  or Understanding might be in Heaven And that this is a true Explication is evident from a Passage in the  Odysseis  Book ℣  Now I the Strength of  Hercules  behold  A tow'ring Spectre of gigantick Mold  A shadowy Form for high in Heav'n's Abodes  Himself resides a God among the Gods  There in the bright Assemblies of the Skies  He  Nectar  quaffs and  Hebe  crowns with Joys  By this it appears that  Homer  was of opinion that  Hercules  was in Heaven while his  or Image was in Hell So that when this second Separation is made the Image or Vehicle becomes a mere thoughtless Form  We have this whole Doctrine very distinctly deliver'd by  Plutarch  in these Words  "Man is a compound Subject but not of two Parts as is commonly believed because the  Understanding  is generally accounted a Part of the  Soul  whereas indeed it as far exceeds the Soul as the Soul is diviner than the Body Now the Soul when compounded with the Understanding makes Reason and when compounded with the Body Passion Whereof the one is the Source or Principle of Pleasure or Pain the other of Vice or Virtue Man therefore properly dies two Deaths the first Death makes him two of three and the second makes him one of two"  Plutarch  of the Face in the Moon  X  VERSE  O'er Hills o'er Dales o'er Rocks o'er Crags they go  On all sides round the Forest hurls her Oaks  Headlong    The Numbers in the Original of this whole Passage are admirably adapted to the Images the Verses convey to us Every Ear must have felt the Propriety of Sound in this Line  That other in its kind is no less exact    Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  has collected many Instances of these sorts of Beauties in  Homer  This Description of felling the Forests so excellent as it is is comprehended in a few Lines which has left room for a larger and more particular one in  Statius  one of the best I think in that Author  Cadit ardua fagus  Chaoniumque nemus brumaeque illaesa cupressus  Procumbunt piceae flammis alimenta supremis  Ornique iliceaeque trabes metuendaque sulco  Taxus infandos belli potura cruores  Fraxinus atque situ non expugnabile robur  Hinc audax abies odorae vulnere pinus  Scinditur acclinant intonsa cacumina terrae  Alnus amica fretis nec inhospita vitibus ulmus  c  I the rather cite this fine Passage because I find it copied by two of the greatest Poets of our own Nation  Chaucer  and  Spencer  The first in the  Assembly of Fowls  the second in his  Fairy Queen  lib  The sailing Pine the Cedar proud and tall  The Vineprop Elm the Poplar never dry  The builder Oak sole King of Forests all  The Aspine good for Staves the Cypress Funeral  The Laurel Meed of mighty Conquerors  And Poets sage The Fir that weepeth still  The Willow worn of forlorn Paramours  The Ewe obedient to the Bender's Will  The Birch for Shafts the Sallow for the Mill  The Myrrh sweet bleeding in the bitter Wound  The warlike Beech the Ash for nothing ill  The fruitful Olive and the Platane round  The Carver Holme the Maple seldom inward sound  XI  VERSE  Each in refulgent Arms  c  'Tis not to be suppos'd that this was a general Custom used at all Funerals but  Patroclus  being a Warrior he is buried like a Soldier with military Honours  Eustathius  XII  VERSE  O'er all the Corse their scatterd Locks they throw    The Ceremony of cutting off the Hair in honour of the Dead was practis'd not only among the  Greeks  but also among other Nations Thus  Statius Thebaid  VI  Tergoque pectore fusam  Caesariem  ferro minuit sectisque jacentis  Obnubit tenuia ora comis  This Custom is taken notice of in holy Scripture  Ezekiel  describing a great Lamentation says  They shall make themselves utterly bald for thee  ch ℣ I believe it was done not only in token of Sorrow but perhaps had a conceal'd Meaning that as the Hair was cut from the Head and was never more to be join'd to it so was the Dead for ever cut off from the Living never more to return  I must just observe that this Ceremony of cutting off the Hair was not always in token of Sorrow  Lycophron  in his  Cassandra  ℣ describing a general Lamentation says  A Length of unshorn Hair adorn'd their Backs  And that the Ancients sometimes had their Hair cut off in token of  Joy  is evident from  Juvenal Sat  ℣  Gaudent ibi vertice raso  Garrula securi narrare pericula Nautae  This seeming Contradiction will be solv'd by having respect to the different Practices of different Nations If it was the general Custom of any Country to wear long Hair then the cutting it off was a token of Sorrow but if it was the Custom to wear short Hair then the letting it grow long and neglecting it shew'd that such People were Mourners  XIII  VERSE  Supporting with his Hands the Hero's Head    Achilles  follows the Corpse as chief Mourner and sustains the Head of his Friend This last Circumstance seems to be neral thus  Euripides  in the Funeral of  Rhesus  ℣  What God O King with his Hands supports the Head of the deceased  XIV  VERSE  And sacred grew to  Sperchius  honour'd Flood    It was the Custom of the Ancients not only to offer their own Hair but likewise to consecrate that of their Children to the RiverGods of their Countrey This is what  Pausanias  shews in his  Attics Before you pass the  Cephisa says he  you find the Tomb of  Theodorus  who was the most excellent Actor of his Time for Tragedy and on the Banks you see two Statues one of  Mnesimachus  and the other of his Son who cut off his Hair in honour of the Rivers for that this was in all Ages  the Custom of the  Greeks  may be inferr'd from  Homer  's Poetry where  Peleus  promises by a solemn Vow to consecrate to the River  Sperchius  the Hair of his Son if he returns safe from the  Trojan  War  This Custom was likewise in  Aegypt  where  Philostratus  tells us that  Memnon  consecrated his Hair to the  Nile  This Practice of  Achilles  was imitated by  Alexander  at the Funeral of  Hephaestion Spondanus  XV  VERES  Coelestial  Venus  c    Homer  has here introduc'd a Series of Allegories in the Compass of a few Lines The Body of  Hector  may be suppos'd to have continued beautiful even after he was slain and  Venus  being the President of Beauty the Poet by a natural Fiction tells us it was preserv'd by that Goddess  Apollo  's covering the Body with a Cloud is a very natural Allegory For the Sun says  Eustathius  has a double Quality which produces contrary Effects the Heat of it causes a Dryness but at the same time it exhales the Vapours of the Earth from whence the Clouds of Heaven are form'd This Allegory may be founded upon Truth there might happen to be a cool Season while  Hector  lay unburied and  Apollo  or the Sun raising Clouds which intercept the Heat of his Beams by a very easy Fiction in Poetry may be introduc'd in Person to preserve the Body of  Hector  XVI  VERSE  The Allegory of the Winds    A Poet ought to express nothing vulgarly and sure no Poet ever trespass'd less against this Rule than  Homer  the Fruitfulness of his Invention is continually raising Incidents new and surprising Take this Passage out of its poetical Dress and it will be no more than this A strong Gale of Wind blew and so increased the Flame that it soon consum'd the Pile But  Homer  introduces the Gods of the Winds in Person And  Iris  or the Rainbow being as  Eustathius  observes a Sign not only  of Showers but of Winds he makes them come at her Summons  Every Circumstance is well adapted As soon as the Winds see  Iris  they rise that is when the Rainbow appears the the Wind rises She refuses to sit and immediately returns that is the Rainbow is never seen long at one time but soon appears and soon vanishes She returns over the Ocean that is the Bow is compos'd of Waters and it would have been an unnatural Fiction to have describ'd her as passing by Land  The Winds are all together in the Cave of  Zephyrus  which may imply that they were there as at their general Rendezvous or that the Nature of all the Winds is the same or that the Western Wind is in that Countrey the most constant and consequently it may be said that at such Seasons all the Winds are assembled in one Corner or rendezvous with  Zephyrus  Iris  will not enter the Cave It is the Nature of the Rainbow to be stretch'd entirely upon the Surface and therefore this Fiction is agreeable to Reason  When  Iris  says that the Gods are partaking Hecatombs in  Aethiopia  it is to be remember'd that the Gods are represented there in the first Book before the Scenes of War were open'd and now they are closed they return thither  Eustathius  Thus  Homer  makes the Anger of his Hero so important that it rouz'd Heaven to Arms and now when it is almost appeas'd  Achilles  as it were gives Peace to the Gods  XVII  VERSE  Hereafter  Greece  a nobler Pyle shall raise    We see how  Achilles  consults his own Glory the desire of it prevails over his Tenderness for  Patroclus  and he will not permit any Man not even his belov'd  Patroclus  to share an equality of Honour with himself even in the Grave  Eustathius  XVIII  VERSE  The Games for  Patroclus  The Conduct of  Homer  in enlarging upon the Games at the Funeral of  Patroclus  is very judicious There had undoubtedly been such Honours paid to several Heroes during this War as appears from a Passage in the ninth Book where  Agamemnon  to enhance the Value of the Horses which he offers  Achilles  says that any Person would be rich that had Treasures equal to the Value of the Prizes they had won which Races must have been run during the Seige for had they been before it the Horses would now have been too old to be of any Value this being the tenth Year of the War But he Poet passes all those Games over in Silence and reserves them for this Season not only in honour of  Patroclus  but also of his Hero  Achilles  who exhibits Games to a whole Army great Generals are Candidates for the Prizes and he himself sits the Judge and Arbitrator Thus in Peace as well as War the Poet maintains the Superiority of the Character of  Achilles  But there is another Reason why the Poet deferr'd to relate any Games that were exhibited at any preceding Funerals The Death of  Patroclus  was the most eminent Period and consequently the most proper Time for such Games  'Tis farther observable that he chuses this peculiar Time with great Judgment When the Fury of the War rag'd the Army could not well have found Leisure for the Games and they might have met with Interruption from the Enemy But  Hector  being dead all  Troy  is in Confusion They are in too great a Consternation to make any Attempts and therefore the Poet could not possibly have chosen a more happy Opportunity  Eustathius  XIX  VERSE  Lost is  Patroclus  now  c  I am not ignorant that  Homer  has frequently been blamed for such little Digressions as these in this Passage he gives us the  Genealogy of his Horses which he has frequently told us in the preceding part of the Poem But  Eustathius  justifies his Conduct and says that it was very proper to commend the Virtue of these Horses upon this Occasion when Horses were to contend for Victory At the same time he takes an Opportunity to make an honourable Mention of his Friend  Patroclus  in whose Honour these Games were exhibited  It may be added as a farther Justification of  Homer  that this last Circumstance is very natural  Achilles  while he commends his Horses remembers how careful  Patroclus  had been of them His Love for his Friend is so great that the minutest Circumstance recalls him to his Mind and such little Digressions such Avocations of Thought as these very naturally proceed from the Overflows of Love and Sorrow  XX  VERSE  Whom rich  Echepolus  c    One wou'd think that  Agamemnon  might be accus'd of Avarice in dispensing a Man from going to the War for the sake of a Horse but  Aristotle  very well observes that this Prince is praiseworthy for having preferr'd a Horse to a Person so cowardly and so uncapable of Service It may also be conjectur'd from this Passage that even in those elder Times it was the Custom that those who were willing to be excus'd from the War should give either a Horse or a Man and often both Thus  Scipio  going to  Africa  order'd the  Sicilians  either to attend him or to give him Horses or Men And  Agesilaus  being at  Ephesus  and wanting Cavalry made a Proclamation that the rich Men who wou'd not serve in the War should be dispens'd with provided they furnish'd a Man and a Horse in their stead In which says  Plutarch  he wisely follow'd the Example of King  Agamemnon  who excus'd a very rich Coward from serving in Person for a Present of a good Mare  Eustathius Dacier  XXI  VERSE  Experienc'd  Nestor  c    The Poet omits no Opportunity of paying Honour to his old favourite  Nestor  and I think he is no where more particularly complemented than in this Book His Age had disabled him from bearing any share in the Games and yet he artfully introduces him not as a mere Spectator but as an Actor in the Sports Thus he as it were wins the Prize for  Antilochus Antilochus  wins not by the Swiftness of his Horses but by the Wisdom of  Nestor  This fatherly Tenderness is wonderfully natural We see him in all imaginable Inquietude and Concern for his Son He comes to the Barrier stands beside the Chariot animates his Son by his Praises and directs him by his Lessons You think the old Man's Soul mounts on the Chariot with his  Antilochus  to partake the same Dangers and run the same Career  Nothing can be better adapted to the Character than this Speech he expatiates upon the Advantages of Wisdom over Strength which is a tacit Complement to himself And had there been a Prize for Wisdom undoubtedly the old Man would have claim'd it as his Right  Eustathius  XXII  VERSE  The Lots their place dispose    According to these Lots the Charioteers took their Places but to know whether they stood all in an equal Front or one behind the other is a Difficulty  Eustathius  says the Ancients were of Opinion that they did not stand in one Front because it is evident that he who had the first Lot had a great Advantage of the other Charioteers If he had not why should  Achilles  cast Lots Madam  Dacier  is of Opinion that they all stood abreast at the Barrier and that the first would still have a sufficient Advantage as he was nearer the Bound and stood  within the rest whereas the others must take a larger Circle and consequently were forc'd to run a greater Compass of Ground  Phoenix  was plac'd as an Inspector of the Race that is says  Eustathius  he was to make report whether they had observ'd the Laws of the Race in their several Turnings  Sophocles  observes the same Method with  Homer  in relation to the Lots and Inspectors in his  Electra    The constituted Judges assign'd the Places according to the Lots  The Ancients say that the Charioteers started at the  Sigaeum  where the Ships of  Achilles  lay and ran towards the  Rhaeteum  from the Ships towards the Shores But  Aristarchus  affirm'd that they run in the Compass of Ground of five Stadia which lay between the Wall and the Tents toward the Shore  Eustathius  XXIII  VERSE  And seem just mounting on his Car behind    A more natural Image than this could not be thought of The Poet makes us Spectators of the Race we see  Diomed  pressing upon  Eumelus  so closely that his Chariot seems to climb the Chariot of  Eumelus  XXIV  VERSE  Rage fills his Eye with Anguish to survey  c  We have seen  Diomed  surrounded with innumerable Dangers acting in the most perilous Scenes of Blood and Death yet never shed one Tear And now he weeps on a small occasion for a mere Trifle This must be ascrib'd to the Nature of Mankind who are often transported with Trifles and there are certain unguarded Moments in every Man's Life so that he who could meet the greatest Dangers with Intrepidity may thro' Anger be betray'd into an Indecency  Eustathius  The reason why  Apollo  is angry at  Diomed  according to  Eustathius  is because he was interested for  Eumelus  whose Mares he had fed when he serv'd  Admetus  but I fancy he is under a Mistake This indeed is a Reason why he should favour  Eumelus  but not why he should be angry at  Diomed  I rather think that the Quarrel of  Apollo  with  Diomed  was personal because he offer'd him a Violence in the first Book and  Apollo  still resents it  The Fiction of  Minerva  's assisting  Diomed  is grounded upon his being so wise as to take a couple of Whips to prevent any Mischance So that  Wisdom  or  Pallas  may be said to lend him one  Eustathius  XXV  VERSE  The Speech of  Antilochus  to his Horses    I fear  Antilochus  his Speech to his Horses is blameable  Eustathius  himself seems to think it a Fault that he should speak so much in the very Heat of the Race He commands and sooths counsels and threatens his Horses as if they were reasonable Creatures The subsequent Speech of  Menelaus  is more excusable as it is more short but both of them are spoken in a Passion and Anger we know makes us speak to every thing and we discharge it upon the most senseless Objects  XXVI  VERSE  The Dispute between  Idomeneus  and  Ajax  Nothing could be more naturally imagin'd than this Contention at a HorseRace The Leaders were divided into Parties and each was interested for his Friend The Poet had a twofold Design not only to embellish and diversity his Poem by such natural Circumstances but also to shew us as  Eustathius  observes from the Conduct of  Ajax  that passionate Men betray themselves into Follies and are themselves guilty of the Faults of which they accuse others  It is with a particular Decency that  Homer  makes  Achilles  the Arbitrator between  Idomeneus  and  Ajax Agamemnon  was  his Superior in the Army but as  Achilles  exhibited the Shows he was the proper Judge of any Difference that should arise about them had the Contest been between  Ajax  and  Idomeneus  consider'd as Soldiers the Cause must have been brought before  Agamemnon  but as they are to be consider'd as Spectators of the Games they ought to be determin'd by  Achilles  It may not be unnecessary just to observe to the Reader the Judiciousness of  Homer  's Conduct in making  Achilles  exhibit the Games and not  Agamemnon Achilles  is the Hero of the Poem and consequently must be the chief Actor in all the great Scenes of it He had remain'd inactive during a great Part of the Poem yet the Poet makes his very Inactivity contribute to the carrying on the Design of his  Ilias  And to supply his Absence from many of the busy Scenes of the preceding Parts of it he now in the Conclusion makes him almost the sole Agent By these means he leaves a noble Idea of his Hero upon the Mind of his Reader and as he rais'd our Expectations when he brought him upon the Stage of Action so he makes him go off with the utmost Pomp and Applause  XXVII  VERSE  High o'er his Head the circling Lash he wields    I am persuaded that the common Translation of the Word  in the Original of this Verse is faulty It is render'd  he lash'd the Horses continually over the Shoulders  whereas I fancy it should be translated thus  assiduè  Equos  agitabat scuticâ ab humero ductâ  This naturally expresses the very Action and whirl of the Whip over the Driver's Shoulder in the Act of lashing the Horses and agrees with the Use of the same Word in the  st  Line of this Book where  must be translated  Jactus Disci ab humero vibrati  XXVIII  VERSE  Fortune denies but Justice  c  Achilles  here intends to shew that it is not just Fortune should rule over Virtue but that a brave Man who had perform'd his Duty and who did not bring upon himself his Misfortune ought to have the Recompence he has deserv'd And this Principle is just provided we do not reward him at the Expence of another's Right  Eumelus  is a  Thessalian  and it is probable  Achilles  has a Partiality to his Countryman  Dacier  XXIX  VERSE  But this my Prize I never shall forego  There is an Air of Bravery in this Discourse of  Antilochus  He speaks with the Generosity of a gallant Soldier and prefers his Honour to his Interest he tells  Achilles  if he pleases he may make  Eumelus  a richer Present than his Prize he is not concern'd for the Value of it but as it was the Reward of Victory he would not resign it because that would be an Acknowledgment that  Eumelus  deserv'd it  The Character of  Antilochus  is admirably sustain'd thro' this whole Episode he is a very sensible Man but transported with youthful Heat and ambitious of Glory His Rashness in driving so furiously against  Menelaus  must be imputed to this but his Passions being gratify'd by the Conquest in the Race his Reason again returns he owns his Error and is full of Resignation to  Menelaus  XXX  VERSE  And touch the Steeds and swear    'Tis evident says  Eustathius  from hence that all Fraud was forbid in the ChariotRace but it is not very plain what unlawful Deceit  Antilochus  used against  Menelaus  perhaps  Antilochus  in his Haste had declin'd from the RaceGround  and avoided some of the uneven Places of it and consequently took an unfair Advantage of his Adversary or perhaps his driving so furiously against  Menelaus  as to endanger both their Chariots and their Lives might be reckon'd foul play and therefore  Antilochus  refuses to take the Oath  XXXI  VERSE  Joy swells his Soul as when the vernal Grain  c  Eustathius  is very large in the Explication of this Similitude which at the first view seems obscure His Words are these  As the Dew raises the Blades of Corn that are for want of it weak and depressed and by pervading the Pores of the Corn animates and makes it flourish so did the Behaviour of  Antilochus  raise the dejected Mind of  Menelaus  exalt his Spirits and restore him to a full Satisfaction  I have given the Reader his Interpretation and translated it with the Liberty of Poetry It is very much in the Language of Scripture and in the Spirit of the Orientals  XXXII  VERSE  Accept thou this O sacred Sire    The Poet in my Opinion preserves a great deal of Decency towards this old Hero and venerable Counsellour He gives him an honorary Reward for his superior Wisdom and therefore  Achilles  calls it  and not  a Prize and not a Present The Moral of  Homer  is that Princes ought no less to honour and recompense those who excel in Wisdom and Counsel than those who are capable of actual Service  Achilles  perhaps had a double view in paying him this Respect not only out of Deference to his Age and Wisdom but also because he had in a manner won the Prize by the Advice he gave his Son So that  Nestor  may be said to have conquer'd in the Person of  Antilochus Eustathius  XXXIII  VERSE Nestor  's Speech to  Achilles  This Speech is admirably well adapted to the Character of  Nestor  He aggrandizes with an Infirmity peculiar to Age his own Exploits and one would think  Horace  had him in his Eye  Laudatur temporis acti  Se puero  Neither is it any Blemish to the Character of  Nestor  thus to be a little talkative about his own Atchievements To have describ'd him otherwise would have been an Outrage to human Nature in as much as the wisest Man living is not free from the Infirmities of Man and as every Stage of Life has some Imperfection peculiar to it self      The Reader may observe that the old Man takes abundance of pains to give Reasons how his Rivals came to be Victors in the ChariotRace He is very solicitous to make it appear that it was not thro' any want of Skill or Power in himself And in my Opinion  Nestor  is never more vainglorious than in this recital of his own Disappointment  It is for the same reason he repeats the Words I have cited above He obtrudes by that Repetition the Disadvantages under which he labour'd upon the Observation of the Reader for fear he should impute the Loss of the Victory to his want of Skill  Nestor  says that these  Moliones  overpower'd him by their Number The Criticks as  Eustathius  remarks have labour'd hard to explain this Difficulty they tell us a formal Story that when  Nestor  was ready to enter the Lists against these Brothers he objected against them as unfair Adversaries for it must be remember'd that they were Monsters that grew together and consequently had four Hands to  Nestor  's two  but the Judges would not allow his plea but determin'd that as they grew together so they ought to be consider'd as one Man  Others tell us that they brought several Chariots into the Lists whose Charioteers combin'd together in favour of  Eurytus  and  Cteatus  these brotherMonsters  Others say that the Multitude of the Spectators conspir'd to disappoint  Nestor  I thought it necessary to give my Reader these several Conjectures that he might understand why  Nestor  says he was overpower'd by  or  Numbers  and also because it confirms my former Observation that  Nestor  is very careful to draw his own Picture in the strongest Colours and to shew it in the fairest Light  XXXIV  VERSE  A female Captive valu'd but at four    I cannot in Civility neglect a Remark made upon this Passage by Madam  Dacier  who highly resents the Affront put upon her Sex by the Ancients who set it seems thrice the Value upon a  Tripod  as upon a beautiful female Slave Nay she is afraid the Value of Women is not rais'd even in our Days for she says there are curious Persons now living who had rather have a true antique Kettle than the finest Woman alive I confess I entirely agree with the Lady and must impute such Opinions of the fair Sex to want of Taste in both Ancients and Moderns The Reader may remember that these Tripods were of no use but made entirely for Show and consequently the most satyrical Critick could only say the Woman and Tripod ought to have born an equal Value  XXXV  VERSE  Like two strong Rafters  c  I will give the Reader the Words of  Eustathius  upon this Similitude which very happily represents the Wrestlers in the Posture of Wrestling Their Heads lean'd one against the other  like the Rafters that support the Roof of a House at the Foot they are disjoin'd and stand at a greater Distance which naturally paints the Attitude of Body in these two Wrestlers while they contend for Victory  XXXVI  VERSE  He barely stirr'd him but he could not raise    The Poet by this Circumstance excellently maintains the Character of  Ajax  who has all along been describ'd as a strong unweildy Warrior He is so heavy that  Ulysses  can scarce lift him The Words that follow will bear a different Meaning either that  Ajax  lock'd his Leg within that of  Ulysses  or that  Ulysses  did it  Eustathius  observes that if  Ajax  gave  Ulysses  this Shock then he may be allow'd to have some appearance of an Equality in the Contest but if  Ulysses  gave it then  Ajax  must be acknowledg'd to have been foil'd But continues he it appear'd to be otherwise to  Achilles  who was the Judge of the Field and therefore he gives them an equal Prize because they were equal in the Contest  Madam  Dacier  misrepresents  Eustathius  on this Place in saying he thinks it was  Ulysses  who gave this second Stroke to  Ajax  whereas it appears by the foregoing Note that he rather determines otherwise in consent with the Judgment given by  Achilles  XXXVII  VERSE  Assist O Goddess thus in Thought he pray'd    Nothing could be better adapted to the present Circumstance of  Ulysses  than this Prayer It is short and ought to be so because the Time would not allow him to make a longer nay he prefers this Petition mentally  all his Faculties are so bent upon the Race that he does not call off his Attention from it even to speak so short a Petition as seven Words which comprehend the whole of it Such  Passages as these are Instances of great Judgment in the Poet  XXXVIII  VERSE  And takes it with a Jest    Antilochus  comes off very well and wittily prevents Raillery by attributing the Victory of his Rivals to the Protection which the Gods gave to Age By this he insinuates that he has something to comfort himself with for Youth is better than the Prize and that he may pretend hereafter to the same Protection since 'tis a Privilege of Seniority  Dacier  XXXIX  VERSE  For who can match  Achilles  There is great Art in these transient Complements to  Achilles  That Hero could not possibly shew his own Superiority in these Games by contending for any of the Prizes because he was the Exhibiter of the Sports But  Homer  has found out a way to give him the Victory in two of them In the ChariotRace  Achilles  is represented as being able to conquer every Opponent and tho' he speaks it himself the Poet brings it in so happily that he speaks it without any Indecency And in this place  Antilochus  with a very good grace tells  Achilles  that in the FootRace no one can dispute the Prize with him Thus tho'  Diomed  and  Ulysses  conquer in the Chariot and FootRace it is only because  Achilles  is not their Antagonist  XL  VERSE  Who first the jointed Armour shall explore    Some of the Ancients have been shock'd at this Combat thinking it a Barbarity that Men in Sport should thus contend for their Lives and therefore  Aristophanes  the  Grammarian  made this Alteration in the Verses    c  But it is evident that they entirely mistook the Meaning and Intention of  Achilles  for he that gave the first Wound was to be accounted the Victor How could  Achilles  promise to entertain them both in his Tent after the Combat if he intended that one of them should fall in it This Duel therefore was only a Tryal of Skill and as such single Combats were frequent in the Wars of those Ages against Adversaries so this was proposed only to shew the Dexterity of the Combatants in that Exercise  Eustathius  XLI  VERSE  Yet still the Victor's Due  Tydides  gains    Achilles  In this place acts the part of a very just Arbitrator Tho' the Combat did not proceed to a full issue yet  Diomed  had evidently the Advantage and consequently ought to be rewarded as Victor because he would have been victorious had not the  Greeks  interpos'd  I could have wish'd that the Poet had given  Ajax  the Prize in some of these Contests He undoubtedly was a very gallant Soldier and has been describ'd as repulsing a whole Army yet in all these Sports he is foil'd But perhaps the Poet had a double View in this Representation not only to shew that Strength without Conduct is usually unsuccessful but also his Design might be to complement the  Greeks  his Countreymen by shewing that this  Ajax  who had repell'd a whole Army of  Trojans  was not able to conquer any one of the  Grecian  Worthies For we find him overpower'd in three of these Exercises  XLII  VERSE  If he be one enrich'd  c  The Poet in this place speaks in the Simplicity of ancient Times The prodigious Weight and Size of the Quoit is describ'd with a noble Plainness peculiar to the oriental way and agreeable to the Manners of those heroick Ages He does not  set down the Quantity of this enormous piece of Iron neither as to its Bigness nor Weight but as to the Use it will be of to him who shall gain it We see from hence that the Ancients in the Prizes they propos'd had in view not only the Honourable but the Useful a Captive for Work a Bull for Tillage a Quoit for the Provision of Iron Besides it must be remember'd that in those Times Iron was very scarce and a sure sign of this Scarcity is that their Arms were Brass  Eustath Dacier  XLIII  VERSE  He takes the Bow    There having been many Editions of  Homer  that of  Marseilles  represents these two Rivals in Archery as using two Bows in the Contest and reads the Verses thus  Our common Editions follow the better Alteration of  Antimachus  with this only Difference that he reads it  And they  It is evident that these Archers had but one Bow as they that threw the Quoit had but one Quoit by these means the one had no Advantage over the other because both of them shot with the same Bow So that the common Reading is undoubtedly the best where the Lines stand thus  Eustath  This  Teucer  is the most eminent Man for Archery of any thro' the whole Iliad yet he is here excell'd by  Meriones  And the Poet ascribes his Miscarriage to the neglect of invoking  Apollo  the God of Archery whereas  Meriones  who invokes him is crown'd with Success There is an excellent Moral in this Passage and the Poet would teach us that without addressing to Heaven we cannot succeed  Meriones  does not conquer because he is the better Archer but because he is the better Man  XLIV  VERSE  Nor here disdain'd the King of Men to rise    There is an admirable Conduct in this Passage  Agamemnon  never contended for any of the former Prizes tho' of much greater Value so that he is a Candidate for this only to honour  Patroclus  and  Achilles  The decency which the Poet uses both in the choice of the Game in which  Agamemnon  is about to contend and the giving him the Prize without a Contest is very remarkable The Game was a warlike Exercise fit for the General of an Army the giving him the Prize without a Contest is a Decency judiciously observed because no one ought to be suppos'd to excel the General in any military Art  Agamemnon  does Justice to his own Character for whereas he had been represented by  Achilles  in the opening of the Poem as a covetous Person he now puts in for the Prize that is of the least Value and generously gives even that to  Talthybius Eustathius  As to this last Particular of  Agamemnon  's presenting the Charger to  Talthybius  I can't but be of a different Opinion It had been an Affront to  Achilles  not to have accepted of his Present on this Occasion and I believe the Words of  Homer  mean no more than that he put it into the Hands of this Herald to carry it to his Ships  Talthybius  being by his Office an Attendant upon  Agamemnon  XLV  It will be expected I should here say something tending to a Comparison between the Games of  Homer  and those of  Virgil  If I may own my private Opinion there is in general more Variety of natural Incidents and a more lively Picture of natural Passions in the Games and Persons of  Homer  On the other hand there seems to me more Art Contrivance Gradation and a greater Pomp of Verse in those of  Virgil  The ChariotRace is that which  Homer  has most labour'd of which  Virgil  being sensible he judiciously avoided the Imitation of what he could not improve and substituted in its place the NavalCourse or ShipRace It is in this the  Roman  Poet has employ'd all his Force as if on set purpose to rival his great Master but it is extremely observable how constantly he keeps  Homer  in his Eye and is afraid to depart from his very Track even when he had vary'd the Subject itself Accordingly the Accidents of the NavalCourse have a strange Resemblance with those of  Homer  's ChariotRace He could not forbear at the very Beginning to draw a part of that Description into a Simile Do not we see he has  Homer  's Chariots in his Head by these Lines  Non tam praecipites bijugó certamine campum  Corripuere ruuntque effusi carcere currus  Nec sic immissis aurigae undantia lora  Concussere jugis pronique in verbera pendent  Aen v ℣  What is the Encounter of  Cloanthus  and  Gyas  in the Strait between the Rocks but the same with that of  Menelaus  and  Antilochus  in the hollow Way Had the Galley of  Sergestus  been broken if the Chariot of  Eumelus  had not been demolish'd Or  Mnestheus  been cast from the Helm had not the other been thrown from his Seat Does not  Mnestheus  exhort his Rowers in the very Words  Antilochus  had us'd to his Horses  Non jamprima peto  Mnestheus  neque vincere cesto  Quamquam O sed superent quibus hoc  Neptune  dedisti  Extremos pudeat rediisse hoc vincite cives  Etprohibete nefas      Upon the whole the Description of the SeaRace I think has the more Poetry and Majesty that of the Chariots more Nature and lively Incidents There is nothing in  Virgil  so picturesque so animated or which so much marks the Characters as the Episodes of  Antilochus  and  Menelaus Ajax  and  Idomeneus  with that beautiful Interposition of old  Nestor  so naturally introduc'd into an Affair where one so little expects him On the other side in  Virgil  the Description itself is much nobler it has something more ostentatiously grand and seems a Spectacle more worthy the Presence of Princes and great Persons  In three other Games we find the  Roman  Poet contending openly with the  Grecian  That of the  Caestus  is in great part a verbal Translation But it must be own'd in favour of  Virgil  that he has vary'd from  Homer  in the Event of the Combate with admirable Judgment and with an Improvement of the Moral  Epaeus  and  Dares  are describ'd by both Poets as vain Boasters but  Virgil  with more poetical Justice punishes  Dares  for his Arrogance whereas the Presumption and Pride of  Epaeus  is rewarded by  Homer  On the contrary in the FootRace I am of opinion that  Homer  has shewn more Judgment and Morality than  Virgil Nisus  in the latter is unjust to his Adversary in favour of his Friend  Euryalus  so that  Euryalus  wins the Race by palpable Fraud and yet the Poet gives him the first Prize whereas  Homer  makes  Ulysses  victorious purely thro' the Mischance of  Ajax  and his own Piety in invoking  Minerva  The shooting is also a direct Copy but with the Addition of two Circumstances which make a beautiful Gradation In  Homer  the first Archer cuts the String that held the Bird and the other shoots him as he is mounting In  Virgil  the  first only hits the Mast which the Bird was fix'd upon the second cuts the String the third shoots him and the fourth to vaunt the Strength of his Arm directs his Arrow up to Heaven where it kindles into a Flame and makes a Prodigy This last is certainly superior to  Homer  in what they call the  Wonderful  but what is the Intent or Effect of this Prodigy or whether a Reader is not at least as much surprized at it as at the most unreasonable Parts in  Homer  I leave to those Criticks who are more inclin'd to find Faults than I am Nor shall I observe upon the many literal Imitations in the  Roman  Poet to object against which were to derogate from the Merit of those fine Passages which  Virgil  was so very sensible of that he was resolv'd to take them at any rate to himself  There remain in  Homer  three Games untouch'd by  Virgil  the Wrestling the single Combate and the  Discus  In  Virgil  there is only the  Lusus Trojae  added which is purely his own and must be confest to be inimitable I don't know whether I may be allow'd to say it is worth all those three of  Homer  I could not forgive my self if I omitted to mention in this place the Funeral Games in the sixth  Thebaïd  of  Statius  it is by much the most beautiful Book of that Poem It's very remarkable that he has follow'd  Homer  thro' the whole Course of his Games There is the ChariotRace the FootRace the  Discus  the  Caestus  the Wrestling the single Combate which is put off in the same manner as in  Homer  and the Shooting which last ends as in  Virgil  with a Prodigy Yet in the particular Descriptions of each of these Games this Poet has not borrow'd from either of his Predecessors and his Poem is so much the worse for it  THE TWENTYFOURTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  The ARGUMENT  The Redemption of the Body of  Hector  THE Gods deliberate about the Redemption of  Hector Jupiter  sends  Thetis  to  Achilles  to dispose him for the restoring it and  Iris  to  Priam  to encourage him to go in Person and treat for it The old King notwithstanding the Remonstrances of his Queen makes ready for the Journey to which he is encourag'd by an Omen from  Jupiter  He sets forth in his Chariot with a Waggon loaded with Presents under the Charge of  Idaeus  the Herald  Mercury  descends in the Shape of a young Man and conducts him to the Pavilion of  Achilles  Their Conversation on the way  Priam  finds  Achilles  at his Table casts himself at his Feet and begs for the Body of his Son  Achilles  mov'd with Compassion grants his Request detains him one Night in his Tent and the next Morning sends him home with the Body The  Trojans  run out to meet him The Lamentations of  Andromache Hecuba  and  Helen  with the Solemnities of the Funeral  The Time of twelve Days is employ'd in this Book while the Body of  Hector  lies in the Tent of  Achilles  And as many more are spent in the Truce allow'd for his Interment The Scene is partly in  Achilles  's Camp and partly in  Troy  THE TWENTYFOURTH BOOK OF THE ILIAD  NOW from the finish'd Games the  Grecian  Band  Sought their black Ships and clear'd the crowded Strand  All stretch'd at ease the genial Banquet share  And pleasing Slumbers quiet all their Care  Not so  Achilles  He to Grief resign'd  His Friend's dear Image present to his Mind  Takes his sad Couch more unobserv'd to weep  Nor tastes the Gifts of allcomposing Sleep  Restless he roll'd around his weary Bed  And all his Soul on his  Patroclus  fed  The Form so pleasing and the Heart so kind  That youthful Vigour and that manly Mind  What Toils they shar'd what martial Works they wrought  What Seas they measur'd and what Fields they fought  All past before him in Remembrance dear  Thought follows Thought and Tear succeeds to Tear  And now supine now prone the Hero lay  Now shifts his Side impatient for the Day  Then starting up disconsolate he goes  Wide on the lonely Beach to vent his Woes  There as the solitary Mourner raves  The ruddy Morning rises o'er the Waves  Soon as it rose his furious Steeds he join'd  The Chariot flies and  Hector  trails behind  And thrice  Patroclus  round thy Monument  Was  Hector  dragg'd then hurry'd to the Tent  There Sleep at last o'ercomes the Hero's Eyes  While foul in Dust th'unhonour'd Carcase lies  But not deserted by the pitying Skies  For  Phoebus  watch'd it with superior Care  Preserv'd from gaping Wounds and tainting Air  And ignominious as it swept the Field  Spread o'er the sacred Corse his golden Shield  All Heav'n was mov'd and  Hermes  will'd to go  By Stealth to snatch him from th'insulting Foe  But  Neptune  this and  Pallas  this denies  And th'unrelenting Empress of the Skies  E'er since that Day implacable to  Troy  What time young  Paris  simple Shepherd Boy  Won by destructive Lust Reward obscene  Their Charms rejected for the  Cyprian  Queen  But when the tenth coelestial Morning broke  To Heav'n assembled thus  Apollo  spoke  Unpitying Pow'rs how oft each holy Fane  Has  Hector  ting'd with Blood of Victims slain  And can ye still his cold Remains pursue  Still grudge his Body to the  Trojans  View  Deny to Consort Mother Son and Sire  The last sad Honours of the fun'ral Fire  Is then the dire  Achilles  all your Care  That Iron Heart inflexibly severe  A Lion not a Man who slaughters wide  In Strength of Rage and Impotence of Pride  Who hastes to murder with a savage Joy  Invades around and breathes but to destroy  Shame is not of his Soul nor understood  The greatest Evil and the greatest Good  Still for one Loss he rages unresign'd  Repugnant to the Lot of all Mankind  To lose a Friend a Brother or a Son  Heav'n dooms each Mortal and its Will is done  A while they sorrow then dismiss their Care  Fate gives the Wound and Man is born to bear  But this Insatiate the Commission giv'n  By Fate exceeds and tempts the Wrath of Heav'n  Lo how his Rage dishonest drags along  Hector  's dead Earth insensible of Wrong  Brave tho' he be yet by no Reason aw'd  He violates the Laws of Man and God  If equal Honours by the partial Skies  Are doom'd both Heroes  Juno  thus replies  If  Thetis'  Son must no Distinction know  Then hear ye Gods the Patron of the Bow  But  Hector  only boasts a mortal Claim  His Birth deriving from a mortal Dame  Achilles  of your own Aetherial Race  Springs from a Goddess by a Man's Embrace  A Goddess by our self to  Peleus  giv'n  A Man divine and chosen Friend of Heav'n  To grace those Nuptials from the bright Abode  Your selves were present where this MinstrelGod  Wellpleas'd to share the Feast amid the Quire  Stood proud to Hymn and tune his youthful Lyre  Then thus the Thund'rer checks th'imperial Dame  Let not thy Wrath the Court of Heav'n inflame  Their Merits nor their Honours are the same  But mine and ev'ry God's peculiar Grace  Hector  deserves of all the  Trojan  Race  Still on our Shrines his grateful Off'rings lay  The only Honours Men to Gods can pay  Nor ever from our smoking Altar ceast  The pure Libation and the holy Feast  Howe'er by Stealth to snatch the Corse away  We will not  Thetis  guards it Night and Day  But haste and summon to our Courts above  The Azure Queen let her Persuasion move  Her furious Son from  Priam  to receive  The proffer'd Ransom and the Corps to leave  He added not And  Iris  from the Skies  Swift as a Whirlwind on the Message flies  Meteorous  the Face of Ocean sweeps  Refulgent gliding o'er the sable Deeps  Between where  Samos  wide his Forests spreads  And rocky  Imbrus  lifts its pointed Heads  Down plung'd the Maid the parted Waves resound  She plung'd and instant shot the dark Profound  As bearing Death in the fallacious Bait  From the bent Angle sinks the loaden Weight  So past the Goddess thro' the closing Wave  Where  Thetis  sorrow'd in her secret Cave  There plac'd amidst her melancholy Train  The bluehair'd Sisters of the sacred Main  Pensive she sate revolving Fates to come  And wept her godlike Son's approaching Doom  Then thus the Goddess of the painted Bow  Arise O  Thetis  from thy Seats below  'Tis  Jove  that calls And why the Dame replies  Calls  Jove  his  Thetis  to the hated Skies  Sad Object as I am for heav'nly Sight  Ah may my Sorrows ever shun the Light  Howe'er be Heav'ns almighty Sire obey'd  She spake and veil'd her Head in sable Shade  Which flowing long her graceful Person clad  And forth she pac'd majestically sad  Then thro' the World of Waters they repair  The Way fair  Iris  led to upper Air  The Deeps dividing o'er the Coast they rise  And touch with momentary Flight the Skies  There in the Light'nings Blaze the Sire they found  And all the Gods in shining Synod round  Thetis  approach'd with Anguish in her Face    Minerva  rising gave the Mourner place  Ev'n  Juno  sought her Sorrows to console  And offer'd from her Hand the Nectar Bowl  She tasted and resign'd it Then began  The sacred Sire of Gods and mortal Man  Thou com'st fair  Thetis  but with Grief o'ercast  Maternal Sorrows long ah long to last  Suffice we know and we partake thy Cares  But yield to Fate and hear what  Jove  declares  Nine Days are past since all the Court above  In  Hector  's Cause have mov'd the Ear of  Jove  'Twas voted  Hermes  from his godlike Foe  By Stealth should bear him but we will'd not so  We will thy Son himself the Corse restore  And to his Conquest add this Glory more  Then hye thee to him and our Mandate bear  Tell him he tempts the Wrath of Heav'n too far  Nor let him more our Anger if he dread  Vent his mad Vengeance on the sacred Dead  But yield to Ransom and the Father's Pray'r  The mournful Father  Iris  shall prepare  With Gifts to sue and offer to his Hands  Whate'er his Honour asks or Heart demands  His Word the silverfooted Queen attends  And from  Olympus'  snowy Tops descends  Arriv'd she heard the Voice of loud Lament  And echoing Groans that shook the lofty Tent  His Friends prepare the Victim and dispose  Repast unheeded while he vents his Woes  The Goddess seats her by her pensive Son  She prest his Hand and tender thus begun  How long unhappy shall thy Sorrows flow  And thy Heart waste with lifeconsuming Woe  Mindless of Food or Love whose pleasing Reign  Sooths weary Life and softens human Pain  O snatch the Moments yet within thy Pow'r  Nor long to live indulge the am'rous Hour  Lo  Jove  himself for  Jove  's Command I bear  Forbids to tempt the Wrath of Heav'n too far  No longer then his Fury if thou dread  Detain the Relicks of great  Hector  dead  Nor vent on senseless Earth thy Vengeance vain  But yield to Ransom and restore the Slain  To whom  Achilles  Be the Ransom giv'n  And we submit since such the Will of Heav'n  While thus they commun'd from th'  Olympian  Bow'rs  Jove  orders  Iris  to the  Trojan  Tow'rs  Haste winged Goddess to the sacred Town  And urge her Monarch to redeem his Son  Alone the  Ilian  Ramparts let him leave  And bear what stern  Achilles  may receive  Alone for so we will No  Trojan  near  Except to place the Dead with decent Care  Some aged Herald who with gentle Hand  May the slow Mules and fun'ral Car command  Nor let him Death nor let him Danger dread  Safe thro' the Foe by our Protection led  Him  Hermes  to  Achilles  shall convey  Guard of his Life and Partner of his Way  Fierce as he is  Achilles  self shall spare  His Age nor touch one venerable Hair  Some Thought there must be in a Soul so brave  Some Sense of Duty some Desire to save  Then down her Bow the winged  Iris  drives  And swift at  Priam  's mournful Court arrives  Where the sad Sons beside their Father's Throne  Sate bath'd in Tears and answer'd Groan with Groan  And all amidst them lay the hoary Sire  Sad Scene of Woe His Face his wrapt Attire  Conceal'd from Sight With frantick Hands he spread  A Show'r of Ashes o'er his Neck and Head  From Room to Room his pensive Daughters roam  Whose Shrieks and Clamours fill the vaulted Dome  Mindful of those who late their Pride and Joy  Lye pale and breathless round the Fields of  Troy  Before the King  Jove  's Messenger appears  And thus in Whispers greets his trembling Ears  Fear not oh Father no ill News I bear  From  Jove  I come  Jove  makes thee still his Care  For  Hector  's sake these Walls he bids thee leave  And bear what stern  Achilles  may receive  Alone for so he wills No  Trojan  near  Except to place the Dead with decent Care  Some aged Herald who with gentle Hand  May the slow Mules and fun'ral Car command  Nor shalt thou Death nor shalt thou Danger dread  Safe thro' the Foe by his Protection led  Thee  Hermes  to  Pelides  shall convey  Guard of thy Life and Partner of thy Way  Fierce as he is  Achilles'  self shall spare  Thy Age nor touch one venerable Hair  Some Thought there must be in a Soul so brave  Some Sense of Duty some Desire to save  She spoke and vanish'd  Priam  bids prepare  His gentle Mules and harness to the Car  There for the Gifts a polish'd Casket lay  His pious Sons the King's Command obey  Then past the Monarch to his BridalRoom  Where CedarBeams the lofty Roofs perfume  And where the Treasures of his Empire lay  Then call'd his Queen and thus began to say  Unhappy Consort of a King distrest  Partake the Troubles of thy Husband's Breast  I saw descend the Messenger of  Jove  Who bids me try  Achilles'  Mind to move  Forsake these Ramparts and with Gifts obtain  The Corps of  Hector  at yon' Navy slain  Tell me thy Thought My Heart impells to go  Thro' hostile Camps and bears me to the Foe  The hoary Monarch thus Her piercing Cries  Sad  Hecuba  renews and then replies  Ah whither wanders thy distemper'd Mind  And where the Prudence now that aw'd Mankind  Thro'  Phrygia  once and foreign Regions known  Now all confus'd distracted overthrown  Singly to pass thro' Hosts of Foes to face  Oh Heart of Steel the Murd'rer of thy Race  To view that deathful Eye and wander o'er  Those Hands yet red with  Hector  's noble Gore  Alas my Lord he knows not how to spare  And what his Mercy thy slain Sons declare  So brave so many fall'n To calm his Rage  Vain were thy Dignity and vain thy Age  Nopent in this sad Palace let us give  To Grief the wretched Days we have to live  Still still for  Hector  let our Sorrows flow  Born to his own and to his Parents Woe  Doom'd from the Hour his luckless Life begun  To Dogs to Vultures and to  Peleus'  Son  Oh in his dearest Blood might I allay  My Rage and these Barbarities repay  For ah could  Hector  merit thus whose Breath  Expir'd not meanly in unactive Death  He pour'd his latest Blood in manly Fight  And fell a Hero in his Country's Right  Seek not to stay me nor my Soul affright  With Words of Omen like a Bird of Night  Reply'd unmov'd the venerable Man  'Tis Heav'n commands me and you urge in vain  Had any mortal Voice th' Injunction laid  Nor Augur Priest or Seer had been obey'd  A present Goddess brought the high Command  I saw I heard her and the Word shall stand  I go ye Gods obedient to your Call  If in yon' Camp your Pow'rs have doom'd my Fall  ContentBy the same Hand let me expire  Add to the slaughter'd Son the wretched Sire  One cold Embrace at least may be allow'd  And my last Tears flow mingled with his Blood  From forth his open'd Stores this said he drew  Twelve costly Carpets of refulgent Hue  As many Vests as many Mantles told  And twelve fair Veils and Garments stiff with Gold  Two Tripods next and twice two Chargers shine  With ten pure Talents from the richest Mine  And last a large welllabour'd Bowl had place  The Pledge of Treaties once with friendly  Thrace    Seem'd all too mean the Stores he could employ  For one last Look to buy him back to  Troy  Lo the sad Father frantick with his Pain  Around him furious drives his menial Train  In vain each Slave with duteous Care attends  Each Office hurts him and each Face offends  What make ye here Officious Crowds he cries  Hence Nor obtrude your Anguish on my Eyes  Have ye no Griefs at Home to fix ye there  Am I the only Object of Despair  Am I become my People's common Show  Set up by  Jove  your Spectacle of Woe  No you must feel him too your selves must fall  The same stern God to Ruin gives you all  Nor is great  Hector  lost by me alone  Your sole Defence your guardian Pow'r is gone  I see your Blood the Fields of  Phrygia  drown  I see the Ruins of your smoking Town  Oh send me Gods e'er that sad Day shall come  A willing Ghost to  Pluto  's dreary Dome  He said and feebly drives his Friends away  The sorrowing Friends his frantick Rage obey  Next on his Sons his erring Fury falls  Polites Paris Agathon  he calls  His Threats  Deïphobus  and  Dius  hear  Hippothous Pammon Helenus  the Seer  And gen'rous  Antiphon  For yet these nine  Surviv'd sad Relicks of his num'rous Line  Inglorious Sons of an unhappy Sire  Why did not all in  Hector  's Cause expire  Wretch that I am my bravest Offspring slain  You the Disgrace of  Priam  's House remain  Mestor  the brave renown'd in Ranks of War  With  Troilus  dreadful on his rushing Car  And last great  Hector  more than Man divine  For sure he seem'd not of terrestial Line  All those relentless  Mars  untimely slew  And left me these a soft and servile Crew  Whose Days the Feast and wanton Dance employ  Gluttons and Flatt'rers the Contempt of  Troy  Why teach ye not my rapid Wheels to run  And speed my Journey to redeem my Son  The Sons their Father's wretched Age revere  Forgive his Anger and produce the Car  High on the Seat the Cabinet they bind  The newmade Car with solid Beauty shin'd  Box was the Yoke embost with costly Pains  And hung with Ringlets to receive the Reins  Nine Cubits long the Traces swept the Ground  These to the Chariots polish'd Pole they bound  Then fix'd a Ring the running Reins to guide  And close beneath the gather'd Ends were ty'd  Next with the Gifts the Price of  Hector  slain  The sad Attendants load the groaning Wain  Last to the Yoke the wellmatch'd Mules they bring  The Gift of  Mysia  to the  Trojan  King  But the fair Horses long his darling Care  Himself receiv'd and harness'd to his Car  Griev'd as he was he not this

destin'd to the Pow'r divine  Held in her right before the Steeds she stands  And thus consigns it to the Monarch's Hands  Take this and pour to  Jove  that safe from Harms  His Grace restore thee to our Roof and Arms  Since Victor of thy Fears and slighting mine  Heav'n or thy Soul inspire this bold Design  Pray to that God who high on  Ida  's Brow  Surveys thy desolated Realms below  His winged Messenger to send from high  And lead thy way with heav'nly Augury  Let the strong Sov'reign of the plumy Race  Tow'r on the right of yon' aethereal Space  That Sign beheld and strengthen'd from above  Boldly pursue the Journey mark'd by  Jove  But if the God his Augury denies  Suppress thy Impulse nor reject Advice  'Tis just said  Priam  to the Sire above  To raise our Hands for who so good as  Jove  He spoke and bad th'attendant Handmaid bring  The purest Water of the living Spring  Her ready Hands the Ew'er and Bason held  Then took the golden Cup his Queen had fill'd  On the mid Pavement pours the rosy Wine  Uplifts his Eyes and calls the Pow'r divine  Oh First and Greatest Heav'ns Imperial Lord  On lofty  Ida  's holy Hill ador'd  To stern  Achilles  now direct my ways  And teach him Mercy when a Father prays  If such thy Will dispatch from yonder Sky  Thy sacred Bird coelestial Augury  Let the strong Sov'reign of the plumy Race  Tow'r on the right of you' aethereal Space  So shall thy Suppliant strengthen'd from above  Fearless pursue the Journey mark'd by  Jove  Jove  heard his Pray'r and from the Throne on high  Dispatch'd his Bird coelestial Augury  The swiftwing'd Chaser of the feather'd Game  And known to Gods by  Percnos'  lofty Name  Wide as appears some Palace Gate display'd  So broad his Pinions stretch their ample Shade  As stooping dexter with resounding Wings  Th'imperial Bird descends in airy Rings  A Dawn of Joy in ev'ry Face appears  The mourning Matron dries her tim'rous Tears  Swift on his Car th'impatient Monarch sprung  The brazen Portal in his Passage rung  The Mules preceding draw the loaded Wain  Charg'd with the Gifts  Idaeus  holds the Rein  The King himself his gentle Steeds controuls  And thro' surrounding Friends the Chariot rolls  On his slow Wheels the following People wait  Mourn at each Step and give him up to Fate  With Hands uplifted eye him as he past  And gaze upon him as they gaz'd their last  Now forward fares the Father on his way  Thro' the lone Fields and back to  Ilion  they  Great  Jove  beheld him as he crost the Plain  And felt the Woes of miserable Man  Then thus to  Hermes  Thou whose constant Cares  Still succour Mortals and attend their Pray'rs  Behold an Object to thy Charge consign'd  If ever Pity touch'd thee for Mankind  Go guard the Sire th'observing Foe prevent  And safe conduct him to  Achilles'  Tent  The God obeys his golden Pinions binds  And mounts incumbent on the Wings of Winds  That high thro' Fields of Air his Flight sustain  O'er the wide Earth and o'er the boundless Main  Then grasps the Wand that causes Sleep to fly  Or in soft Slumbers seals the wakeful Eye  Thus arm'd swift  Hermes  steers his airy way  And stoops on  Hellespont  's resounding Sea  A beauteous Youth majestick and divine  He seem'd fair Offspring of some princely Line  Now Twilight veil'd the glaring Face of Day  And clad the dusky Fields in sober Gray  What time the Herald and the hoary King  Their Chariots stopping at the silver Spring  That circling  Ilus'  ancient Marble flows  Allow'd their Mules and Steeds a short Repose  Thro' the dim Shade the Herald first espies  A Man's approach and thus to  Priam  cries  I mark some Foes Advance O King beware  This hard Adventure claims thy utmost Care  For much I fear Destruction hovers nigh  Our State asks Counsel is it best to fly  Or old and helpless at his Feet to fall  Two wretched Suppliants and for Mercy call  Th' afflicted Monarch shiver'd with Despair  Pale grew his Face and upright stood his Hair  Sunk was his Heart his Colour went and came  A sudden Trembling shook his aged Frame  When  Hermes  greeting touch'd his royal Hand  And gentle thus accosts with kind Demand  Say whither Father when each mortal Sight  Is seal'd in Sleep thou wander'st thro' the Night  Why roam thy Mules and Steeds the Plains along  Thro'  Grecian  Foes so num'rous and so strong  What couldst thou hope should these thy Treasures view  These who with endless Hate thy Race pursue  For what Defence alas couldst thou provide  Thy self not young a weak old Man thy Guide  Yet suffer not thy Soul to sink with Dread  From me no Harm shall touch thy rev'rend Head  From  Greece  I'll guard thee too for in those Lines  The living Image of my Father shines  Thy Words that speak Benevolence of Mind  Are true my Son the godlike Sire rejoin'd  Great are my Hazards but the Gods survey  My Steps and send thee Guardian of my way  Hail and be blest For scarce of mortal Kind  Appears thy Form thy Feature and thy Mind  Nor true are all thy Words nor erring wide  The sacred Messenger of Heav'n reply'd  But say convey'st thou thro' the lonely Plains  What yet most precious of thy Store remains  To lodge in safety with some friendly Hand  Prepar'd perchance to leave thy native Land  Or fly'st thou now What Hopes can  Troy  retain  Thy matchless Son her Guard and Glory slain  The King alarm'd Say what and whence thou art  Who search the Sorrows of a Parent's Heart  And know so well how godlike  Hector  dy'd  Thus  Priam  spoke and  Hermes  thus reply'd  You tempt me Father and with Pity touch  On this sad Subject you enquire too much  Oft have these Eyes that godlike  Hector  view'd  In glorious Fight with  Grecian  Blood embru'd  I saw him when like  Jove  his Flames he tost  On thousand Ships and wither'd half an Host  I saw but help'd not Stern  Achilles'  Ire  Forbad Assistance and enjoy'd the Fire  For him I serve of  Myrmidonian  Race  One Ship convey'd us from our native Place  Polyctor  is my Sire an honour'd Name  Old like thy self and not unknown to Fame  Of sev'n his Sons by whom the Lot was cast  To serve our Prince it fell on me the last  To watch this Quarter my Adventure falls  For with the Morn the  Greeks  attack your Walls  Sleepless they sit impatient to engage  And scarce their Rulers check the martial Rage  If then thou art of stern  Pelides'  Train  The mournful Monarch thus rejoin'd again  Ah tell me truly where oh where are laid  My Son's dear Relicks what befalls him dead  Have Dogs dismember'd on the naked Plains  Or yet unmangled rest his cold Remains  O favor'd of the Skies Thus answer'd then  The Pow'r that mediates between Gods and Men  Nor Dogs nor Vultures have thy  Hector  rent  But whole he lies neglected in the Tent  This the twelfth Evening since he rested there  Untouch'd by Worms untainted by the Air  Still as  Aurora  's ruddy Beam is spread  Round his Friend's Tomb  Achilles  drags the Dead  Yet undisfigur'd or in Limb or Face  All fresh he lies with ev'ry living Grace  Majestical in Death No Stains are found  O'er all the Corse and clos'd is ev'ry Wound  Tho' many a Wound they gave Some heav'nly Care  Some Hand divine preserves him ever fair  Or all the Host of Heav'n to whom he led  A Life so grateful still regard him dead  Thus spoke to  Priam  the coelestial Guide  And joyful thus the royal Sire reply'd  Blest is the Man who pays the Gods above  The constant Tribute of Respect and Love  Those who inhabit the  Olympian  Bow'r  My Son forgot not in exalted Pow'r  And Heav'n that ev'ry Virtue bears in mind  Ev'n to the Ashes of the Just is kind  But thou oh gen'rous Youth this Goblet take  A Pledge of Gratitude for  Hector  's sake  And while the fav'ring Gods our Steps survey  Safe to  Pelides'  Tent conduct my way  To whom the latent God O King forbear  To tempt my Youth for apt is Youth to err  But can I absent from my Prince's Sight  Take Gifts in secret that must shun the Light  What from our Master's Int'rest thus we draw  Is but a licens'd Theft that 'scapes the Law  Respecting him my Soul abjures th' Offence  And as the Crime I dread the Consequence  Thee far as  Argos  pleas'd I could convey  Guard of thy Life and Partner of thy Way  On thee attend thy Safety to maintain  O'er pathless Forests or the roaring Main  He said then took the Chariot at a Bound  And snatch'd the Reins and whirl'd the Lash around  Before th'inspiring God that urg'd them on  The Coursers fly with Spirit not their own  And now they reach'd the naval Walls and found  The Guards repasting while the Bowls go round  On these the Virtue of his Wand he tries  And pours deep Slumber on their watchful Eyes  Then heav'd the massy Gates remov'd the Bars  And o'er the Trenches led the rolling Cars  Unseen thro' all the hostile Camp they went  And now approach'd  Pelides'  lofty Tent  Of Fir the Roof was rais'd and cover'd o'er  With Reeds collected from the marshy Shore  And fenc'd with Palisades a Hall of State  The Work of Soldiers where the Hero sate  Large was the Door whose wellcompacted Strength  A solid Pinetree barr'd of wond'rous Length  Scarce three strong  Greeks  could lift its mighty Weight  But great  Achilles  singly clos'd the Gate  This  Hermes  such the Pow'r of Gods set wide  Then swift alighted the coelestial Guide  And thus reveal'dHear Prince and understand  Thou ow'st thy Guidance to no mortal Hand  Hermes  I am descended from above  The King of Arts the Messenger of  Jove  Farewell To shun  Achilles'  Sight I fly  Uncommon are such Favours of the Sky  Nor stand confest to frail Mortality  Now fearless enter and prefer thy Pray'rs  Adjure him by his Father's silver Hairs  His Son his Mother urge him to bestow  Whatever Pity that stern Heart can know  Thus having said he vanish'd from his Eyes  And in a moment shot into the Skies  The King confirm'd from Heav'n alighted there  And left his aged Herald on the Car  With solemn Pace thro' various Rooms he went  And found  Achilles  in his inner Tent  There sate the Hero  Alcimus  the brave  And great  Automedon  Attendance gave  These serv'd his Person at the royal Feast  Around at awful distance stood the rest  Unseen by these the King his Entry made  And prostrate now before  Achilles  laid  Sudden a venerable Sight appears  Embrac'd his Knees and bath'd his Hands in Tears  Those direful Hands his Kisses press'd embru'd  Ev'n with the best the dearest of his Blood  As when a Wretch who conscious of his Crime  Pursu'd for Murder flies his native Clime  Just gains some Frontier breathless pale amaz'd  All gaze all wonder Thus  Achilles  gaz'd  Thus stood th'Attendants stupid with Surprize  All mute yet seem'd to question with their Eyes  Each look'd on other none the Silence broke  Till thus at last the Kingly Suppliant spoke  Ah think thou favour'd of the Pow'rs Divine  Think of thy Father's Age and pity mine  In me that Father's rev'rend Image trace  Those silver Hairs that venerable Face  His trembling Limbs his helpless Person see  In all my Equal but in Misery  Yet now perhaps some Turn of human Fate  Expells him helpless from his peaceful State  Think from some pow'rful Foe tho see'st him fly  And beg Protection with a feeble Cry  Yet still one Comfort in his Soul may rise  He hears his Son still lives to glad his Eyes  And hearing still may hope a better Day  May send him thee to chase that Foe away  No Comfort to my Griefs no Hopes remain  The best the bravest of my Sons are slain  Yet what a Race e'er  Greece  to  Ilion  came  The Pledge of many a lov'd and loving Dame  Nineteen one Mother boreDead all are dead  How oft alas has wretched  Priam  bled  Still One was left their Loss to recompense  His Father's Hope his Country's last Defence  Him too thy Rage has slain beneath thy Steel  Unhappy in his Country's Cause he fell  For him thro' hostile Camps I bent my way  For him thus prostrate at thy Feet I lay  Large Gifts proportion'd to thy Wrath I bear  Oh hear the Wretched and the Gods revere  Think of thy Father and this Face behold  See him in me as helpless and as old  Tho' not so wretched There he yields to me  The First of Men in sov'reign Misery  Thus forc'd to kneel thus grov'ling to embrace  The Scourage and Ruin of my Realm and Race  Suppliant my Childrens Murd'rer to implore  And kiss those Hands yet reeking with their Gore  These Words soft Pity in the Chief inspire  Touch'd with the dear Remembrance of his Sire  Then with his Hand as prostrate still he lay  The Old Man's Cheek he gently turn'd away  Now each by turns indulg'd the Gush of Woe  And now the mingled Tides together flow  This low on Earth that gently bending o'er  A Father one and one a Son deplore  But great  Achilles  diff'rent Passions rend  And now his Sire he mourns and now his Friend  Th' infectious Softness thro' the Heroes ran  One universal solemn Show'r began  They bore as Heroes but they felt as Man  Satiate at length with unavailing Woes  From the high Throne divine  Achilles  rose  The rev'rend Monarch by the Hand he rais'd  On his white Beard and Form majestick gaz'd  Not unrelenting Then serene began  With Words to sooth the miserable Man  Alas what Weight of Anguish hast thou known  Unhappy Prince thus guardless and alone  To pass thro' Foes and thus undaunted face  The Man whose Fury has destroy'd thy Race  Heav'n sure has arm'd thee with a Heart of Steel  A Strength proportion'd to the Woes you feel  Rise then Let Reason mitigate our Care  To mourn avails not Man is born to bear  Such is alas the Gods severe Decree  They only they are blest and only free  Two Urns by  Jove  's high Throne have ever stood  The Source of Evil one and one of Good  From thence the Cup of mortal Man he fills  Blessings to these to those distributes Ills  To most he mingles both The Wretch decreed  To taste the bad unmix'd is curst indeed  Pursu'd by Wrongs by meagre Famine driv'n  He wanders Outcast both of Earth and Heav'n  The Happiest taste not Happiness sincere  But find the cordial Draught is dash'd with Care  Who more than  Peleus  shone in Wealth and Pow'r  What Stars concurring blest his natal Hour  A Realm a Goddess to his Wishes giv'n  Grac'd by the Gods with all the Gifts of Heav'n  One Evil yet o'ertakes his latest Day  No Race succeeding to imperial Sway  One only Son and he alas ordain'd  To fall untimely in a foreign Land  See him in  Troy  the pious Care decline  Of his weak Age to live the Curse of thine  Thou too Old Man hast happier Days beheld  In Riches once in Children once excell'd  Extended  Phrygia  own'd thy ample Reign  And all fair  Lesbos'  blissful Seats contain  And all wide  Hellespont  's unmeasur'd Main  But since the God his Hand has pleas'd to turn  And fill thy Measure from his bitter Urn  What sees the Sun but hapless Heroes Falls  War and the Blood of Men surround thy Walls  What must be must be Bear thy Lot nor shed  These unavailing Sorrows o'er the Dead  Thou can'st not call him from the  Stygian  Shore  But thou alas may'st live to suffer more  To whom the King Oh favour'd of the Skies  Here let me grow to Earth since  Hector  lies  On the bare Beach depriv'd of Obsequies  Oh give me  Hector  to my Eyes restore  His Corse and take the Gifts I ask no more  Thou as thou may'st these boundless Stores enjoy  Safe may'st thou sail and turn thy Wrath from  Troy  So shall thy Pity and Forbearance give  A weak old Man to see the Light and live  Move me no more  Achilles  thus replies  While kindling Anger sparkled in his Eyes  Nor seek by Tears my steady Soul to bend  To yield thy  Hector  I my self intend  For know from  Jove  my GoddessMother came  Old Ocean's Daughter silverfooted Dame  Nor com'st thou but by Heav'n nor com'st alone  Some God impells with Courage not thy own  No human Hand the weighty Gates unbarr'd  Nor could the boldest of our Youth have dar'd  To pass our Outworks or elude the Guard  Cease lest neglectful of high  Jove  's Command  I show thee King thou tread'st on hostile Land  Release my Knees thy suppliant Arts give o'er  And shake the Purpose of my Soul no more  The Sire obey'd him trembling and o'eraw'd  Achilles  like a Lion rush'd abroad  Automedon  and  Alcimus  attend  Whom most he honour'd since he lost his Friend  These to unyoke the Mules and Horses went  And led the hoary Herald to the Tent  Next heap'd on high the num'rous Presents bear  Great  Hector  's Ransome from the polish'd Car  Two splendid Mantles and a Carpet spread  They leave to cover and inwrap the Dead  Then call the Handmaids with assistant Toil  To wash the Body and anoint with Oil  Apart from  Priam  lest th' unhappy Sire  Provok'd to Passion once more rouze to Ire  The stern  Pelides  and nor sacred Age  Nor  Jove  's Command should check the rising Rage  This done the Garments o'er the Corse they spread  Achilles  lifts it to the fun'ral Bed  Then while the Body on the Car they laid  He groans and calls on lov'd  Patroclus'  Shade  If in that Gloom which never Light must know  The Deeds of Mortals touch the Ghosts below  O Friend forgive me that I thus fulfill  Restoring  Hector  Heav'ns unquestion'd Will  The Gifts the Father gave be ever thine  To grace thy  Manes  and adorn thy Shrine  He said and entring took his Seat of State  Where full before him rev'rend  Priam  sate  To whom compos'd the godlike Chief begun  Lo to thy Pray'r restor'd thy breathless Son  Extended on the Fun'ral Couch he lies  And soon as Morning paints the Eastern Skies  The Sight is granted to thy longing Eyes  But now the peaceful Hours of sacred Night  Demand Refection and to Rest invite  Nor thou O Father thus consum'd with Woe  The common Cares that nourish Life foregoe  Not thus did  Niobe  of Form divine  A Parent once whose Sorrows equal'd thine  Six youthful Sons as many blooming Maids  In one sad Day beheld the  Stygian  Shades  These by  Apollo  's silver Bow were slain  Those  Cynthia  's Arrows stretch'd upon the Plain  So was her Pride chastiz'd by Wrath divine  Who match'd her own with bright  Latona  's Line  But two the Goddess twelve the Queen enjoy'd  Those boasted twelve th'avenging two destroy'd  Steep'd in their Blood and in the Dust outspread  Nine Days neglected lay expos'd the Dead  None by to weep them to inhume them none  For  Jove  had turn'd the Nation all to Stone  The Gods themselves at length relenting gave  Th'unhappy Race the Honours of a Grave  Her self a Rock for such was Heav'ns high Will  Thro' Desarts wild now pours a weeping Rill  Where round the Bed whence  Acheloüs  springs  The wat'ry Fairies dance in mazy Rings  There high on  Sipylus  his shaggy Brow  She stands her own sad Monument of Woe  The Rock for ever lasts the Tears for ever flow  Such Griefs O King have other Parents known  Remember theirs and mitigate thy own  The Care of Heav'n thy  Hector  has appear'd  Nor shall he lye unwept and uninterr'd  Soon may thy aged Cheeks in Tears be drown'd  And all the Eyes of  Ilion  stream around  He said and rising chose the Victim Ewe  With silver Fleece which his Attendants slew  The Limbs they sever from the reeking Hyde  With Skill prepare them and in Parts divide  Each on the Coals the sep'rate Morsels lays  And hasty snatches from the rising Blaze  With Bread the glitt'ring Canisters they load  Which round the Board  Automedon  bestow'd  The Chief himself to each his Portion plac'd  And each indulging shar'd in sweet Repast  When now the Rage of Hunger was represt  The wond'ring Hero eyes his royal Guest  No less the royal Guest the Hero eyes  His godlike Aspect and majestick Size  Here youthful Grace and noble Fire engage  And there the mild Benevolence of Age  Thus gazing long the Silence neither broke  A solemn Scene at length the Father spoke  Permit me now belov'd of  Jove  to steep  My careful Temples in the Dew of Sleep  For since the Day that numbred with the Dead  My hapless Son the Dust has been my Bed  Soft Sleep a Stranger to my weeping Eyes  My only Food my Sorrows and my Sighs  Till now encourag'd by the Grace you give  I share thy Banquet and consent to live  With that  Achilles  bad prepare the Bed  With Purple soft and shaggy Carpets spread  Forth by the flaming Lights they bend their way  And place the Couches and the Cov'rings lay  Then he Now Father sleep but sleep not here  Consult thy Safety and forgive my Fear  Lest any  Argive  at this Hour awake  To ask our Counsel or our Orders take  Approaching sudden to our open'd Tent  Perchance behold thee and our Grace prevent  Should such

stay  Our slaught'ring Arm and bid the Hosts obey  If then thy Will permit the Monarch said  To finish all due Honours to the Dead  This of thy Grace accord To thee are known  The Fears of  Ilion  clos'd within her Town  And at what distance from our Walls aspire  The Hills of  Ide  and Forests for the Fire  Nine Days to vent our Sorrows I request  The tenth shall see the Fun'ral and the Feast  The next to raise his Monument be giv'n  The twelfth we war if War be doom'd by Heav'n  This thy Request reply'd the Chief enjoy  Till then our Arms suspend the Fall of  Troy  Then gave his Hand at parting to prevent  The Old Man's Fears and turn'd within the Tent  Where fair  Briseis  bright in blooming Charms  Expects her Hero with desiring Arms  But in the Porch the King and Herald rest  Sad Dreams of Care yet wand'ring in their Breast  Now Gods and Men the Gifts of Sleep partake  Industrious  Hermes  only was awake  The King's Return revolving in his Mind  To pass the Ramparts and the Watch to blind  The Pow'r descending hover'd o'er his Head  And sleep'st thou Father thus the Vision said  Now dost thou sleep when  Hector  is restor'd  Nor fear the  Grecian  Foes nor  Grecian  Lord  Thy Presence here shou'd stern  Atrides  see  Thy stillsurviving Sons may sue for thee  May offer all thy Treasures yet contain  To spare thy Age and offer all in vain  Wak'd with the Word the trembling Sire arose  And rais'd his Friend The God before him goes  He joins the Mules directs them with his Hand  And moves in Silence thro' the hostile Land  When now to  Xanthus'  yellow Stream they drove    Xanthus  immortal Progeny of  Jove    The winged Deity forsook their View  And in a Moment to  Olympus  flew  Now shed  Aurora  round her Saffron Ray  Sprung thro' the Gates of Light and gave the Day  Charg'd with their mournful Load to  Ilion  goe  The Sage and King majestically slow  Cassandra  first beholds from  Ilion  's Spire  The sad Procession of her hoary Sire  Then as the pensive Pomp advanc'd more near  Her breathless Brother stretch'd upon the Bier  A Show'r of Tears o'erflows her beauteous Eyes  Alarming thus all  Ilion  with her Cries  Turn here your steps and here your eyes employ  Ye wretched Daughters and ye Sons of  Troy  If e'er ye rush'd in Crowds with vast Delight  To hail your Hero glorious from the Fight  Now meet him dead and let your Sorrows flow  Your common Triumph and your common Woe  In thronging Crowds they issue to the Plains  Nor Man nor Woman in the Walls remains  In ev'ry Face the selfsame Grief is shown  And  Troy  sends forth one universal Groan  At  Scaea  's Gates they meet the mourning Wain  Hang on the Wheels and grovel round the Slain  The Wife and Mother frantic with Despair  Kiss his pale Cheek and rend their scatter'd Hair  Thus wildly wailing at the Gates they lay  And there had sigh'd and sorrow'd out the Day  But godlike  Priam  from the Chariot rose  Forbear he cry'd this Violence of Woes  First to the Palace let the Car proceed  Then pour your boundless Sorrows o'er the Dead  The Waves of People at his Word divide  Slow rolls the Chariot thro' the following Tide  Ev'n to the Palace the sad Pomp they wait  They weep and place him on the Bed of State  A melancholy Choir attend around  With plaintive Sighs and Musick's solemn Sound  Alternately they sing alternate flow  Th' obedient Tears melodious in their Woe  While deeper Sorrows groan from each full Heart  And Nature speaks at ev'ry Pause of Art  First to the Corse the weeping Consort flew  Around his Neck her milkwhite Arms she threw  And oh my  Hector  oh my Lord she cries  Snatch'd in thy Bloom from these desiring Eyes  Thou to the dismal Realms for ever gone  And I abandon'd desolate alone  An only Son once Comfort of our Pains  Sad Product now of hapless Love remains  Never to manly Age that Son shall rise  Or with increasing Graces glad my Eyes  For  Ilion  now her great Defender slain  Shall sink a smoaking Ruin on the Plain  Who now protects her Wives with guardian Care  Who saves her Infants from the Rage of War  Now hostile Fleets must waft those Infants o'er  Those Wives must wait 'em to a foreign Shore  Thou too my Son to barb'rous Climes shalt goe  The sad Companion of thy Mother's Woe  Driv'n hence a Slave before the Victor's Sword  Condemn'd to toil for some inhuman Lord  Or else some  Greek  whose Father prest the Plain  Or Son or Brother by great  Hector  slain  In  Hector  's Blood his Vengeance shall enjoy  And hurl thee headlong from the Tow'rs of  Troy  For thy stern Father never spar'd a Foe  Thence all these Tears and all this Scene of Woe  Thence many Evils his sad Parents bore  His Parents many but his Consort more  Why gav'st thou not to me thy dying Hand  And why receiv'd not I thy last Command  Some Word thou would'st have spoke which sadly dear  My Soul might keep or utter with a Tear  Which never never could be lost in Air  Fix'd in my Heart and oft repeated there  Thus to her weeping Maids she makes her Moan  Her weeping Handmaids echo Groan for Groan  The mournful Mother next sustains her Part  Oh thou the best the dearest to my Heart  Of all my Race thou most by Heav'n approv'd  And by th'Immortals ev'n in Death belov'd  While all my other Sons in barb'rous Bands  Achilles  bound and sold to foreign Lands  This felt no Chains but went a glorious Ghost  Free and a Hero to the  Stygian  Coast  Sentenc'd 'tis true by his inhuman Doom  Thy noble Corse was dragg'd around the Tomb  The Tomb of him thy warlike Arm had slain  Ungen'rous Insult impotent and vain  Yet glow'st thou fresh with ev'ry living Grace  No mark of Pain or Violence of Face  Rosy and fair as  Phoebus'  silver Bow  Dismiss'd thee gently to the Shades below  Thus spoke the Dame and melted into Tears  Sad  Helen  next in Pomp of Grief appears  Fast from the shining Sluices of her Eyes  Fall the round crystal Drops while thus she cries  Ah dearest Friend in whom the Gods had join'd  The mildest Manners with the bravest Mind  Now twice ten Years unhappy Years are o'er  Since  Paris  brought me to the  Trojan  Shore  Oh had I perish'd e'er that Form divine  Seduc'd this soft this easy Heart of mine  Yet was it ne'er my Fate from thee to find  A Deed ungentle or a Word unkind  When others curst the Auth'ress of their Woe  Thy Pity check'd my Sorrows in their Flow  If some proud Brother ey'd me with Disdain  Or scornful Sister with her sweeping Train  Thy gentle Accents soften'd all my Pain  For thee I mourn and mourn my self in thee  The wretched Source of all this Misery  The Fate I caus'd for ever I bemoan  Sad  Helen  has no Friend now thou art gone  Thro'  Troy  's wide Streets abandon'd shall I roam  In  Troy  deserted as abhorr'd at Home  So spoke the Fair with Sorrowstreaming Eye  Distressful Beauty melts each Standerby  On all around th'infectious Sorrow grows  But  Priam  check'd the Torrent as it rose  Perform ye  Trojans  what the Rites require  And fell the Forests for a fun'ral Pyre  Twelve Days nor Foes nor secret Ambush dread  Achilles  grants these Honours to the Dead  He spoke and at his Word the  Trojan  Train  Their Mules and Oxen harness to the Wain  Pour thro' the Gates and fell'd from  Ida  's Crown  Roll back the gather'd Forests to the Town  These Toils continue nine succeeding Days  And high in Air a Sylvan Structure raise  But when the tenth fair Morn began to shine  Forth to the Pile was born the Man divine  And plac'd aloft while all with streaming Eyes  Beheld the Flames and rolling Smokes arise  Soon as  Aurora  Daughter of the Dawn  With rosy Lustre streak'd the dewy Lawn  Again the mournful Crowds surround the Pyre  And quench with Wine the yet remaining Fire  The snowy Bones his Friends and Brothers place  With Tears collected in a golden Vase  The golden Vase in purple Palls they roll'd  Of softest Texture and inwrought with Gold  Last o'er the Urn the sacred Earth they spread  And rais'd the Tomb Memorial of the Dead  Strong Guards and Spies till all the Rites were done  Watch'd from the rising to the setting Sun  All  Troy  then moves to  Priam  's Court again  A solemn silent melancholy Train  Assembled there from pious Toil they rest  And sadly shar'd the last Sepulcral Feast  Such Honours  Ilion  to her Hero paid  And peaceful slept the mighty  Hector  's Shade  The End of the ILIAD  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TwentyFourth Book  OBSERVATIONS ON THE TWENTYFOURTH BOOK  I  VERSE  What Seas they measur'd  c  There is something very noble in these Sentiments of  Achilles  He does not recollect any soft Moments any Tendernesses that had pass'd between him and  Patroclus  but he revolves the many Difficulties the Toils by Land and the Dangers by Sea in which they had been Companions Thus the Poet on all Occasions admirably sustains the Character of  Achilles  when he play'd upon the Harp in the ninth Book he sung the Atchievements of Kings and in this place there is an air of Greatness in his very Sorrows  Achilles  is as much a Hero when he weeps as when he fights  This Passage in  Homer  has not escap'd the Censure of  Plato  who thought it a Diminution to his Character to be  thus transported with Grief but the Objection will vanish if we remember that all the Passions of  Achilles  are in the extreme his Nature is violent and it would have been an Outrage to his general Character to have represented him as mourning moderately for his Friend  Plato  spoke more like a Philosopher than a Critick when he blamed the Behaviour of  Achilles  as unmanly These Tears would have illbecome  Plato  but they are graceful in  Achilles  Besides there is something very instructive in this whole Representation it shews us the Power of a sincere Friendship and softens and recommends the Character of  Achilles  the Violence he us'd towards his Enemy is alleviated by the Sincerity he expresses towards his Friend he is a terrible Enemy but an amiable Friend  II  VERSE  For  Phoebus  watch'd it  c  Eustathius  says that by this Shield of  Apollo  are meant the Clouds that are drawn up by the Beams of the Sun which cooling and qualifying the Sultriness of the Air preserved the Body from Decay But perhaps the Poet had something farther in his Eye when he introduc'd  Apollo  upon this Occasion  Apollo  is a Physician and the God of Medicaments if therefore  Achilles  used any Arts to preserve  Hector  from Decay that he might be able the longer to insult his Remains  Apollo  may properly be said to protect it with his  Aegis  III  VERSE  But  Neptune  this and  Pallas  this denies    It is with excellent Art that the Poet carries on this part of his Poem he shews that he could have contriv'd another way to recover the Body of  Hector  but as a God is never to  be introduc'd but when human Means fail he rejects the Interposition of  Mercury  makes use of ordinary Methods and  Priam  redeems his Son This gives an Air of Probability to the Relation at the same time that it advances the Glory of  Achilles  for the greatest of his Enemies labours to purchase his Favour the Gods hold a Consultation and a King becomes his Suppliant  Eustathius  Those seven Lines from  to  have been thought spurious by some of the Ancients They judg'd it an Indecency that the Goddess of Wisdom and  Achilles  should be equally inexorable and that it was below the Majesty of the Gods to be said at all to steal Besides say they had  Homer  been acquainted with the Judgment of  Paris  he would undoubtedly have mention'd it before this time in his Poem and consequently that Story was of a later Invention And  Aristarchus  affirms that  is a more modern Word and never known before the Time of  Hesiod  who uses it when he speaks of the Daughters of  Praetus  and adds that it is appropriated to signify the Incontinence of Women and cannot be at all apply'd to Men Therefore others read the last Verse  These Objections are entirely gather'd from  Eustathius  to which we may add that  Macrobius  seems to have been one of those who rejected these Verses since he affirms that our Author never mentions the Judgment of  Paris  It may be answer'd that the Silence of  Homer  in the foregoing part of the Poem as to the Judgment of  Paris  is no Argument that he was ignorant of that Story Perhaps he might think it most proper to unfold the Cause of the Destruction of  Troy  in the Conclusion of the  Ilias  that the Reader seeing the Wrong done and the Punishment of that Wrong immediately following might acknowledge the Justice of it  The same Reason will be an answer to the Objection relating to the Anger of  Pallas  Wisdom cannot be satisfy'd without Justice and consequently  Pallas  ought not to cease from Resentment till  Troy  has suffer'd the Deserts of her Crimes  I cannot think that the Objection about the Word  is of any Weight the Date of Words is utterly uncertain and as no one has been able to determine the Ages of  Homer  and  Hesiod  so neither can any Person be assured that such Words were not in use in  Homer  's Days  IV  VERSE  A Lion not a Man  c  This is a very formal Condemnation of the Morals of  Achilles  which  Homer  puts into the Mouth of a God One may see from this alone that he was far from designing his Hero a virtuous Character yet the Poet artfully introduces  Apollo  in the midst of his Reproaches intermingling the Hero's Praises with his Blemishes  Brave tho' he be  c Thus what is the real Merit of  Achilles  is distinguish'd from what is blameable in his Character and we see  Apollo  or the God of Wisdom is no less impartial than just in his Representation of  Achilles  V  VERSE  And wept her god like Son's approaching Doom    These words are very artfully inserted by the Poet The Poem could not proceed to the Death of  Achilles  without breaking the Action and therefore to satisfy the Curiosity of the Reader concerning the Fate of this great Man he takes care to inform us that his Life draws to a Period and as it were celebrates his Funeral before his Death  Such Circumstances as these greatly raise the Character of  Achilles  he is so truly valiant that tho' he knows he must fall before  Troy  yet he does not abstain from the War but couragiously meets his Death And here I think it proper to insert an Observation that ought to have been made before which is that  Achilles  did not know that  Hector  was to fall by his Hand if he had known it where would have been the mighty Courage in engaging him in a single Combat in which he was sure to conquer The contrary  of this is evident from the Words of  Achilles  to  Hector  just before the Combat  c  I will make no Compacts with thee  says  Achilles but one of us shall fall  VI  VERSE  Nine Days are past since all the Court above  c  It may be thought that so many Interpositions of the Gods such Messages from Heaven to Earth and down to the Seas are needless Machines and it may be imagin'd that it is an Offence against Probability that so many Deities should be employ'd to pacify  Achilles  But I am of Opinion that the Poet conducts this whole Affair with admirable Judgment The Poem is now almost at the Conclusion and  Achilles  is to pass from a State of an almost inexorable Resentment to a State of perfect Tranquillity such a Change could not be brought about by human Means  Achilles  is too stubborn to obey any thing less than a God This is evident from his rejecting the Persuasion of the whole  Grecian  Army to return to the Battle So that it appears that this Machinery was necessary and consequently a Beauty to the Poem  It may be farther added that these several Incidents proceed from  Jupiter  It is by his Appointment that so many Gods are employ'd to attend  Achilles  By these means  Jupiter  fulfills the Promise mention'd in the first Book of honouring the Son of  Thetis  and the Poet excellently sustains his Character by representing the inexorable  Achilles  as not parting with the Body of his mortal Enemy but by the immediate Command of  Jupiter  If the Poet had conducted these Incidents merely by human Means or suppos'd  Achilles  to restore the Body of  Hector  entirely out of Compassion the Draught had been unnatural because unlike  Achilles  Such a Violence of Temper was not to be pacify'd by ordinary Methods Besides the Poet has  made use of the properest Personages to carry on the Affair for who could be suppos'd to have so great an Influence upon  Achilles  as his own Mother who is a Goddess  VII  VERSE  And thy Heart waste with lifeconsuming Woe    This Expression in the Original is very particular Were it to be translated literally it must be render'd how long wilt thou eat or prey upon thy own Heart by these Sorrows And it seems that it was a common way of expressing a deep Sorrow and  Pythagoras  uses it in this Sense  that is grieve not excessively let not sorrow make too great an Impression upon thy Heart  Eustathius  VIII  VERSE  Indulge the am'rous Hour    The Ancients says  Eustathius  rejected these Verses because of the indecent Idea they convey The Goddess in plain Terms advises  Achilles  to go to Bed to his Mistress and tells him a Woman will be a Comfort The good Bishop is of Opinion that they ought to be rejected but the Reason he gives is as extraordinary as that of  Thetis  Soldiers says he have more occasion for something to strengthen themselves with than for Women And this is the Reason continues he why Wrestlers are forbid all Commerce with that Sex during the whole Time of their Exercise  Dionysius  of  Halicarnassus  endeavours to justify  Homer  by observing that this Advice of  Thetis  was not given him to induce him to any Wantonness but was intended to indulge a nobler Passion his Desire of Glory She advises him to go to that Captive who was restor'd to him in a publick manner to satisfy his Honour To that Captive the Detention of whom had been so great a Punishment to the whole  Grecian  Army And therefore  Thetis  uses a very proper Motive to comfort her Son by advising him to gratify at once both his Love and his Glory  Plutarch  has likewise labour'd in  Homer  's Justification he observes that the Poet has set the Picture of  Achilles  in this place in a very fair and strong point of Light Tho'  Achilles  had so lately receiv'd his belov'd  Briseïs  from the Hands of  Agamemnon  tho' he knew that his own Life drew to a sudden Period yet the Hero prevails over the Lover and he does not haste to indulge his Love He does not lament  Patroclus  like a common Man by neglecting the Duties of Life but he abstains from all Pleasures by an Excess of Sorrow and the Love of his Mistress is lost in that of his Friend  This Observation excellently justifies  Achilles  in not indulging himself with the Company of his Mistress The Hero prevails so much over the Lover that  Thetis  thinks her self oblig'd to recall  Briseïs  to his Memory Yet still the Indecency remains All that can be said in favour of  Thetis  is that she was Mother to  Achilles  and consequently might take the greater Freedom with her Son  Madam  Dacier  disapproves of both the former Observations She has recourse to the Lawfulness of such a Practice between  Achilles  and  Briseïs  and because such Commerces in those times were reputed honest therefore she thinks the Advice was decent The married Ladies are oblig'd to her for this Observation and I hope all tender Mothers when their Sons are afflicted will advise them to comfort themselves in this manner  In short I am of Opinion that this Passage outrages Decency and 'tis a sign of some Weakness to have so much occasion of Justification Indeed the whole Passage is capable of a serious Construction and of such a Sense as a Mother might express to a Son with Decency And then it will run thus  "Why art thou my Son thus afflicted Why thus resign'd to Sorrow Can neither Sleep nor Love divert you Short is thy Date of Life spend it not all in weeping but allow some part of it to Love and Pleasure"  But still the Indecency lies in the manner of the Expression which must be allow'd to be almost obscene for such is the Word  misceri  all that can be said in Defence of it is that as we are not competent Judges of what Ideas Words might carry in  Homer  's Time so we ought not entirely to condemn  him because it is possible the Expression might not sound so indecently in ancient as in modern Ears  IX  VERSE  Him  Hermes  to  Achilles  shall convey    The Intervention of  Mercury  was very necessary at this Time and by it the Poet not only gives an Air of Probability to the Relation but also pays a Complement to his Countreymen the  Grecians  They kept so strict a Guard that nothing but a God could pass unobserv'd and this highly recommends their military Discipline and  Priam  not being able to carry the Ransom without a Chariot it would have been an Offence against Probability to have suppos'd him able to have pass'd all the Guards of the Army in his Chariot without the Assistance of some Deity  Horace  had this Passage in his view Ode the  th  of the first Book  Iniqua  Trojae  castra fefellit  X  VERSE  Achilles  self shall spare  His Age nor touch one venerable Hair  c  It is observable that every Word here is a Negative        Achilles  is still so angry that  Jupiter  cannot say he is wise judicious and merciful he only commends him negatively and barely says he is not a Madman nor perversely wicked  It is the Observation of the Ancients says  Eustathius  that all the Causes of the Sins of Man are included in those three Words Man offends either out of Ignorance and then he is  or thro' Inadvertency then he is  or wilfully and maliciously and then he is  So that this Description agrees very well with the present Disposition of  Achilles  he is not  because his Resentment begins to abate he is not  because his Mother has given him Instructions nor  because he will not offend against the Injunctions of  Jupiter  XI  VERSE  The winged  Iris  flies  c  Mons  Rapin  has been very free upon this Passage where so many Machines are made use of to cause  Priam  to obtain the Body of  Hector  from  Achilles  "This Father says he who has so much Tenderness for his Son who is so superstitious in observing the funeral Ceremonies and saving those precious Remains from the Dogs and Vultures ought not he to have thought of doing this himself without being thus expressly commanded by the Gods Was there need of a Machine to make him remember that he was a Father"  But this Critick entirely forgets what render'd such a Conduct of absolute Necessity namely the extreme Danger and in all Probability imminent Ruin both of the King and State upon  Priam  's putting himself into the Power of his most inveterate Enemy There was no other Method of recovering  Hector  and of discharging his funeral Rites which were look'd upon by the Ancients of so high Importance and therefore the Message from  Jupiter  to encourage  Priam  with the Assistance of  Mercury  to conduct him and to prepare  Achilles  to receive him with Favour was far from impertinent It was  Dignus vindice nodus  as  Horace  expresses it  XII  VERSE  His Face his wrapt Attire conceal'd from Sight    The Poet has observ'd a great Decency in this place he was not able to express the Grief of this royal Mourner and so covers what he could not represent From this Passage  Semanthes  the  Sicyonian  Painter borrow'd his Design in the Sacrifice of  Iphigenia  and represents his  Agamemnon  as  Homer  does his  Priam Aeschylus  has likewise imitated this Place and draws his  Niobe  exactly after the manner of  Homer Eustathius  XIII  VERSE  He pour'd his latest Blood in manly Fight  And fell a Hero    This whole Discourse of  Hecuba  is exceedingly natural she aggravates the Features of  Achilles  and softens those of  Hector  Her Anger blinds her so much that she can see nothing great in  Achilles  and her Fondness so much that she can discern no Defects in  Hector  Thus she draws  Achilles  in the fiercest Colours like a Barbarian and calls him  But at the same time forgets that  Hector  ever fled from  Achilles  and in the Original directly tells us that he  knew not how to fear or how to fly  Eustathius  XIV  VERSE  Lo the sad Father  c  This Behaviour of  Priam  is very natural to a Person in his Circumstances The Loss of his favourite Son makes so deep an Impression upon his Spirits that he is incapable of Consolation he is displeased with every body he is angry he knows not why the Disorder and Hurry of his Spirits make him break out into passionate Expressions and those Expressions are contain'd in short Periods very natural to Men in Anger who give not themselves Leisure to express their Sentiments at full length It is from the same Passion that  Priam  in the second Speech treats all his Sons with the utmost Indignity calls 'em Gluttons Dancers and Flatterers  Eustathius  very justly remarks that he had  Paris  particularly in his Eye but his Anger makes him transfer that Character to the rest of his Children not being calm enough to make a Distinction between the Innocent and Guilty  That Passage where he runs out into the Praises of  Hector  is particularly natural His Concern and Fondness makes him as extravagant in the Commendation of him as in the Disparagement of his other Sons They are less than Mortals he more than Man  Rapin  has censur'd this Anger of  Priam  as a Breach of the  Manners  and says he might have shewn himself a Father otherwise than by this Usage of his Children But whoever considers his Circumstances will judge after another manner  Priam  after having been the most wealthy most powerful and formidable Monarch of  Asia  becomes all at once the most miserable of Men He loses in less than eight Days the best of his Army and a great Number of virtuous Sons he loses the bravest of 'em all his Glory and his Defence the gallant  Hector  This last Blow sinks him quite and changes him so much that he is no longer the same He becomes impatient frantick unreasonable The terrible Effect of ill Fortune Whoever has the least Insight into Nature must admire so fine a Picture of the Force of Adversity on an unhappy old Man  XV  VERSE  Deiphobus  and  Dius    It has been a Dispute whether  or  in ℣ was a proper Name but  Pherecydes  says  Eustathius  determines it and assures us that  Dios  was a spurious Son of Priam  XVI  VERSE  The sad Attendants load the groaning Wain    It is necessary to observe to the Reader to avoid Confusion that two Cars are here prepared the one drawn by Mules to carry the Presents and to bring back the Body of  Hector  the other drawn by Horses in which the Herald and  Priam  rode  Eustathius  XVII  VERSE  Oh first and greatest  c  Eustathius  observes that there is not one Instance in the whole  Ilias  of any Prayer that was justly prefer'd that fail'd of Success This Procedure of  Homer  's is very judicious and answers exactly  to the true end of Poetry which is to please and instruct Thus  Priam  prays that  Achilles  may cease his Wrath and compassionate his Miseries and  Jupiter  grants his Request The unfortunate King obtains Compassion and in his most inveterate Enemy finds a Friend  XVIII  VERSE  The Description of  Mercury  A Man must have no Taste for Poetry that does not admire this sublime Description  Virgil  has translated it almost  verbatim  in the th Book of the  Aeneis  ℣  Ille patris magni parere parabat  Imperio primùm pedibus talaria nectit  Aurea quae sublimem alis sive aequora supra  Seu terram rapido pariter cum flamine portant  Tum virgam capit hâc animas ille evocat orco  Pallentes alias sub tristia tartara mittit  Dat somnos adimitque lumina morte resignat  It is hard to determine which is more excellent the Copy or the Original  Mercury  appears in both Pictures with equal Majesty and the  Roman  Dress becomes him as well as the  Grecian Virgil  has added the latter part of the fifth and the whole sixth Line to  Homer  which makes it still more full and majestical  Give me leave to produce a Passage out of  Milton  of near Affinity with the Lines above which is not inferior to  Homer  or  Virgil  It is the Description of the Descent of an Angel  Down thither prone in Flight  He speeds and thro' the vast Aethereal Sky  Sails between Worlds and Worlds with steady Wing  Now on the polar Winds Then with quick Force  Winnows the buxom Air  Of beaming sunny Rays a golden Tiar  Circled his Head nor less his Locks behind  Illustrious on his Shoulders fledg'd with Wings  Lay waving round  c  XIX  VERSE  Now Twilight veil'd the glaring Face of Day    The Poet by such Intimations as these recalls to our Minds the exact Time which  Priam  takes up in this Journey to  Achilles  He set out in the Evening and by the time that he reach'd the Tomb of  Ilus  it was grown somewhat dark which shews that this Tomb stood at some distance from the City Here  Mercury  meets him and when it was quite dark guides him into the Presence of  Achilles  By these Methods we may discover how exactly the Poet preserves the Unities of Time and Place that he allots Space sufficient for the Actions which he describes and yet does not crowd more Incidents into any Interval of Time than may be executed in as much as he allows Thus it being improbable that so stubborn a Man as  Achilles  should relent in a few Moments the Poet allows a whole Night for this Affair so that  Priam  has Leisure enough to go and return and Time enough remaining to persuade  Achilles  XX  VERSE  c The Speech of  Mercury  to  Priam  I shall not trouble the Reader with the Dreams of  Eustathius  who tells us that this Fiction of  Mercury  is partly true and partly false 'Tis true that his Father is old rich and has seven Children for  Jupiter  is King of the whole Universe was from Eternity and created both Men and Gods In like manner when  Mercury  says he is the seventh Child of his Father  Eustathius  affirms that he meant that there were six Planets besides  Mercury  Sure it requires great Pains and Thought to be so learnedly absurd The Supposition which he makes afterwards is far more natural  Priam  says he might by chance meet with one of the  Myrmidons  who might conduct him unobserv'd thro' the Camp into the Presence of  Achilles  and as the Execution of any wise Design is ascrib'd to  Pallas  so may this clandestine Enterprize be said to be manag'd by the Guidance of  Mercury  But perhaps this whole Passage may be better explain'd by having recourse to the Pagan Theology It was an Opinion that obtain'd in those early Days that  Jupiter  frequently sent some friendly Messengers to protect the Innocent so that  Homer  might intend to give his Readers a Lecture of Morality by telling us that this unhappy King was under the Protection of the Gods  Madam  Dacier  carries it farther  Homer  says she instructed by Tradition knew that God sends his Angels to the Succour of the afflicted The Scripture is full of Examples of this Truth The Story of  Tobit  has a wonderful Relation with this of  Homer Tobit  sent his Son to  Rages  a City of  Media  to receive a considerable Sum  Tobias  did not know the Way he found at his Door a young Man cloath'd with a majestick Glory which attracted Admiration It was an Angel under the Form of a Man This Angel being ask'd who he was answer'd as  Mercury  does here by a Fiction He said that he was of the Children of  Israel  that his Name was  Azarias  and that he was Son of  Ananias  This Angel conducted  Tobias  in Safety he gave him Instructions and when he was to receive the Recompence which the Father and Son offer'd him he declar'd that he was the Angel of the Lord took his Flight towards heaven and disappear'd Here is a great Conformity in the Ideas and in the Style and the Example of our Author so long before  Tobit  proves that this Opinion of God's sending his Angels to the Aid of Man was very common and much spread amongst the Pagans in those former Times  Dacier  XXI  VERSE  Blest is the Man  c  Homer  now begins after a beautiful and long Fable to give the Moral of it and display his poetical Justice in Rewards and Punishments Thus  Hector  fought in a bad Cause and therefore suffers in the Defence of it but because he was a good Man and obedient to the Gods in other Respects his very Remains become the Care of Heaven  I think it necessary to take notice to the Reader that nothing is more admirable than the Conduct of  Homer  throughout his whole Poem in respect to Morality He justifies the Character of  Horace  Quid pulchrum quid turpe quid utile quid non  Plenius melius Chrysippo Crantore dicit  If the Reader does not observe the Morality of the  Ilias  he loses half and the nobler part of its Beauty He reads it as a common Romance and mistakes the chief Aim of it which is to instruct  XXII  VERSE  But can I absent  c  In the Original of this Place which I have paraphras'd a little the Word  is remarkable  Priam  offers  Mercury  whom he looks upon as a Soldier of  Achilles  a Present which he refuses because his Prince is ignorant of it This Present he calls a direct  Theft  or  Robbery  which may shew us how strict the Notions of Justice were in the Days of  Homer  when if a Prince's Servant receiv'd any Present without the Knowledge of his Master he was esteem'd a Thief and a Robber  Eustathius  XXIII  VERSE  Of Fir the Roof was rais'd    I have in the course of these Observations describ'd the Method of encamping used by the  Grecians  The Reader has here a full and exact Description of the Tent of  Achilles  This royal Pavilion was built with long Palisadoes made of Firr the Top of it cover'd with Reeds and the Inside was divided into several Apartments Thus  Achilles  had his  or large Hall and behind it were lodging Rooms So in the ninth Book  Phoenix  has a Bed prepared for him in one Apartment  Patroclus  has another for himself and his Captive  Iphis  and  Achilles  has a third for himself and his Mistress  Diomeda  But we must not imagine that the other  Myrmidons  had Tents of the like Dimensions they were as  Eustathius  observes inferior to this royal one of  Achilles  Which indeed is no better than an Hovel yet agrees very well with the Duties of a Soldier and the Simplicity of those early Times  I am of Opinion that such fixed Tents were not used by the  Grecians  in their common Marches but only during the time of Sieges when their long stay in one Place made it necessary to build such Tents as are here describ'd at other times they lay like  Diomed  in the tenth Book in the open Air their Spears standing upright to be ready upon any Alarm and with the Hides of Beasts spread on the Ground instead of a Bed  It is worthy Observation that  Homer  even upon so trivial an Occasion as the describing the Tent of  Achilles  takes an Opportunity to shew the superior Strength of his Hero and tells us that three Men could scarce open the Door of his Pavilion but  Achilles  could open it alone  XXIV  VERSE  Nor stand confest to frail Mortality    Eustathius  thinks it was from this Maxim that the Princes of the East assum'd that Air of Majesty which separates them from the Sight of their Subjects but I should rather believe that  Homer  copied this after the Originals from some Kings of his Time it not being unlikely that this Policy is very ancient  Dacier  XXV  VERSE  Adjure him by his Father  c  Eustathius  observes that  Priam  does not entirely follow the Instructions of  Mercury  but only calls to his remembrance his aged Father  Peleus  And this was judiciously done by  Priam  For what Motive to Compassion could arise from the mention of  Thetis  who was a Goddess and incapable of Misfortune Or  how could  Neoptolemus  be any Inducement to make  Achilles  pity  Priam  when at the same time he flourish'd in the greatest Prosperity And therefore  Priam  only mentions his Father  Peleus  who like him stood upon the very Brink of the Grave and was liable to the same Misfortunes he then suffer'd These are the Remarks of  Eustathius  but how then shall we justify  Mercury  the God of Eloquence who gave him such improper Instructions with relation to  Thetis  All that can be said in defence of the Poet is that  Thetis  tho' a Goddess has thro' the whole Course of the  Ilias  been describ'd as a Partner in all the Afflictions of  Achilles  and consequently might be made use of as an Inducement to raise the Compassion of  Achilles Priam  might have said I conjure thee by the Love thou bearest to thy Mother take pity on me For if she who is a Goddess would grieve for the Loss of her beloved Son how greatly must the Loss of  Hector  afflict the unfortunate  Hecuba  and  Priam  XXVII  VERSE  Sudden a venerable Sight appears    I fancy this Interview between  Priam  and  Achilles  would furnish an admirable Subject for a Painter in the Surprize of  Achilles  and the other Spectators the Attitude of  Priam  and the Sorrows in the Countenance of this unfortunate King  That Circumstance of  Priam  's kissing the Hands of  Achilles  is inimitably fine he kiss'd says  Homer  the Hands of  Achilles  those terrible murderous Hands that had robb'd him of so many Sons By these two Words the Poet recalls to our Mind all the noble Actions perform'd by  Achilles  in the whole  Ilias  and at the same time strikes us with the utmost Compassion for this unhappy King who is reduc'd so low as to be oblig'd to kiss those Hands that had slain his Subjects and ruin'd his Kingdom and Family  XXVIII  VERSE  The Speech of  Priam  to  Achilles  The Curiosity of the Reader must needs be awaken'd to know how  Achilles  would behave to this unfortunate King it requires all the Art of the Poet to sustain the violent Character of  Achilles  and yet at the same time to soften him into Compassion To this end the Poet uses no Preamble but breaks directly into that Circumstance which is most likely to mollify him and the two first Words he utters are    see thy Father O  Achilles  in me  Nothing could be more happily imagin'd than this Entrance into his Speech  Achilles  has every where been describ'd as bearing a great Affection to his Father and by two Words the Poet recalls all the Tenderness that Love and Duty can suggest to an affectionate Son  Priam  tells  Achilles  that  Hector  fell in the Defence of his Country I am far from thinking that this was inserted accidentally it could not fail of having a very good Effect upon  Achilles  not only as one brave Man naturally loves another but as it implies that  Hector  had no particular Enmity against  Achilles  but that tho' he fought against him it was in Defence of his Country  The Reader will observe that  Priam  repeats the Beginning of his Speech and recalls his Father to his Memory in the Conclusion of it This is done with great Judgment the Poet takes care to enforce his Petition with the strongest Motive and leaves it fresh upon his Memory and possibly  Priam  might perceive that the mention of his Father had made a deeper Impression upon  Achilles  than any other part of his Petition therefore while the Mind of  Achilles  dwells upon it he again sets him before his Imagination by this Repetition and softens him into Compassion  XXIX  VERSE  These Words soft Pity  c  We are now come almost to the end of the Poem and consequently to  the end of the Anger of  Achilles  And  Homer  has describ'd the Abatement of it with excellent Judgment We may here observe how necessary the Conduct of  Homer  was in sending  Thetis  to prepare her Son to use  Priam  with Civility It would have ill suited with the violent Temper of  Achilles  to have used  Priam  with Tenderness without such Preadmonition nay the unexpected Sight of his Enemy might probably have carry'd him into Violence and Rage But  Homer  has avoided these Absurdities for  Achilles  being already prepared for a Reconciliation the Misery of this venerable Prince naturally melts him into Compassion  XXX  VERSE Achilles  's Speech to  Priam  There is not a more beautiful Passage in the whole  Ilias  than this before us  Homer  to shew that  Achilles  was not a mere Soldier here draws him as a Person of excellent Sense and sound reason  Plato  himself who condemns this Passage could not speak more like a true Philosopher And it was a piece of great Judgment thus to describe him for the Reader would have retain'd but a very indifferent Opinion of the Hero of a Poem that had no Qualification but mere Strength It also shews the Art of the Poet thus to defer this part of his Character till the very Conclusion of the Poem By these means he fixes an Idea of his Greatness upon our Minds and makes his Hero go off the Stage with Applause  Neither does he here ascribe more Wisdom to  Achilles  than he might really be Master of for as  Eustathius  observes he had  Chiron  and  Phoenix  for his Tutors and a Goddess for his Mother  XXXI  VERSE  Two Urns by  Jove  's high Throne  c  This is an admirable Allegory and very beautifully imagin'd by the Poet  Plato  has accus'd it as an Impiety to say that God gives Evil But it seems borrow'd from the Eastern way of  speaking and bears a great Resemblance to several Expressions in Scripture Thus in the  Psalms In the Hand of the Lord there is a Cup and he poureth out of the same as for the Dregs thereof all the Ungodly of the Earth shall drink them  It was the Custom of the  Jews  to give condemn'd Persons just before Execution  Wine mix'd with Myrrh to make them less sensible of Pain Thus  Proverbs  xxxi  Give strong Drink to him that is ready to perish  This Custom was so frequent among the  Jews  that the Cup which was given before Execution came to denote Death itself as in that Passage  Father let this Cup pass from me  Some have suppos'd that there were three Urns one of Good and two of Evil thus  Pindar  But as  Eustathius  observes the Word  shews that there were but two for that Word is never used when more than two are intended  XXXII  VERSE  Extended  Phrygia  c    Homer  here gives us a piece of Geography and shews the full Extent of  Priam  's Kingdom  Lesbos  bounded it on the South  Phrygia  on the East and the  Hellespont  on the North This Kingdom according to  Strabo  in the th Book was divided into nine Dynasties who all depended upon  Priam  as their King So that what  Homer  here relates of  Priam  's Power is literally true and confirm'd by History  Eustathius  XXXIII  VERSE  While kindling Anger sparkled in his Eyes    I believe every Reader must be surpriz'd as I confess I was to see  Achilles  fly out into so sudden a Passion without any apparent  Reason for it It can scarce be imagin'd that the Name of  Hector  as  Eustathius  thinks could throw him into so much Violence when he had heard it mention'd with Patience and Calmness by  Priam  in this very Conference Especially if we remember that  Achilles  had actually determin'd to restore the Body of  Hector  to  Priam  I was therefore very well pleas'd to find that the Words in the Original would bear another Interpretation and such a one as naturally solves the Difficulty The Meaning of the Passage I fancy may be this  Priam  perceiving that his address had mollify'd the Heart of  Achilles  takes this Opportunity to persuade him to give over the War and return home especially since his Anger was sufficiently satisfy'd by the Fall of  Hector  Immediately  Achilles  takes fire at this Proposal and answers  "Is it not enough that I have determin'd to restore thy Son Ask no more lest I retract that Resolution"  In this View we see a natural Reason for the sudden Passion of  Achilles  What may perhaps strengthen this Conjecture is the Word  and then the Sense will run thus Since I have found so much Favour in thy Sight as first to permit me to live O wouldst thou still enlarge my Happiness and return home to thy own Country  c  This Opinion may be farther establish'd from what follows in the latter end of this Interview where  Achilles  asks  Priam  how many Days he would request for the Interment of  Hector Achilles  had refus'd to give over the war but yet consents to intermit it a few Days and then the Sense will be this  "I will not consent to return home but ask a time for a Cessation and it shall be granted"  And what most strongly speaks for this Interpretation is the Answer of  Priam  I ask says he eleven Days to bury my Son and then let the War commence again since  it must be so  since you necessitate me to it or since you will not be persuaded to leave these Shores  XXXIV  VERSE  While kindling Anger sparkled in his Eyes    The Reader may be pleas'd to observe that this is the last  Sally of the Resentment of  Achilles  and the Poet judiciously describes him moderating it by his own Reflection So that his Reason now prevails over his Anger and the Design of the Poem is fully executed  XXXV  VERSE  For know from  Jove  my Goddess Mother came    The Injustice of  La Motte  's Criticism who blames  Homer  for representing  Achilles  so mercenary as to enquire into the Price offer'd for  Hector  's Body before he would restore it will appear plainly from this Passage where he makes  Achilles  expressly say it is not for any other Reason that he delivers the Body but that Heaven had directly commanded it The Words are very full    XXXVI  VERSE  Not thus did  Niobe  c    Achilles  to comfort  Priam  tells him a known History which was very proper to work this Effect  Niobe  had lost all her Children  Priam  had some remaining  Niobe  's Children had been nine Days extended on the Earth drown'd in their Blood in the Sight of their People without any one presenting himself to interr them  Hector  has likewise been twelve Days but in the midst of his Enemies therefore 'tis no wonder that no one has paid him the last Duties The Gods at last interr'd  Niobe  's Children and the Gods likewise are concern'd to procure honourable Funerals for  Hector Eustathius  XXXVII  VERSE  The royal Guest the Hero eyes  c  The Poet omits no Opportunity of praising his Hero  Achilles  and it is observable that he now commends him for his more amiable Qualities He softens the terrible Idea we have conceiv'd of him as a Warrior with several Virtues of Humanity and the angry vindictive Soldier is become calm and compassionate In this place he makes his very Enemy admire his Personage and be astonish'd at his manly Beauty So that tho' Courage be his most distinguishing Character yet  Achilles  is admirable both for the Endowments of Mind and Body  The Sense of this Word differs in this place from that it usually bears It does not imply  any reproachful Asperity of Language but  the raising of a false Fear in the old Man that he might not be concern'd at his being lodg'd in the outermost part of the Tent and by this method he gives  Priam  an Opportunity of going away in the Morning without Observation  Eustathius  XXXVIII  VERSE  To ask our Counsel or our Orders take    The Poet here shews the Importance of  Achilles  in the Army tho'  Agamemnon  be the General yet all the chief Commanders apply to him for Advice and thus he promises  Priam  a Cessation of Arms for several Days purely by his own Authority The Method that  Achilles  took to confirm the Truth of the Cessation agrees with the Custom which we use at this Day he gave him his Hand upon it      Eustathius  XXXIX  VERSE  A melancholy Choir  c  This was a Custom generally receiv'd and which passed from the  Hebrews  to the  Greeks Romans  and  Asiaticks  There were Weepers by Profession of both Sexes who sung doleful Tunes round the Dead  Ecclesiasticus  cap ℣  When a Man shall go into the House of his Eternity there shall encompass him Weepers  It appears from St  Matthew  xi that Children were likewise employed in this Office  Dacier  XL  VERSE  c The Lamentations over  Hector  The Poet judiciously makes  Priam  to be silent in this general Lamentation he has already born a sufficient Share in these Sorrows in the Tent of  Achilles  and said what Grief can dictate to a Father and a King upon such a melancholy Subject But he introduces three Women as chief Mourners and speaks only in general of the Lamentation of the Men of  Troy  an Excess of Sorrow being unmanly Whereas these Women might with Decency indulge themselves in all the Lamentation that Fondness and Grief could suggest The Wife the Mother of  Hector  and  Helen  are the three Persons introduced and tho' they all mourn upon the same Occasion yet their Lamentations are so different that not a Sentence that is spoken by the one could be made use of by the other  Andromache  speaks like a tender Wife  Hecuba  like a fond Mother and  Helen  mourns with a Sorrow rising from Selfaccusation  Andromache  commends his Bravery  Hecuba  his manly Beauty and  Helen  his Gentleness and Humanity  Homer  is very concise in describing the Funeral of  Hector  which was but a necessary piece of Conduct after he had been so full in that of  Patroclus  XLI  VERSE  Why gav'st thou not to me thy dying Hand  And why receiv'd not I thy last Command  I have taken these two Lines from Mr  Congreve  whose Translation of this Part was one of his first Essays in Poetry He has very justly render'd the Sense of    dictum prudens  which is meant of the Words of a dying Man or one in some dangerous Exigence at which times what is spoken is usually something of the utmost Importance and deliver'd with the utmost Care Which is the true Signification of the Epithet  in this place  XLII  We have now past thro' the  Iliad  and seen the Anger of  Achilles  and the terrible Effects of it at an end As that only was the Subject of the Poem and the Nature of Epic Poetry would not permit our Author to proceed to the Event of the War it may perhaps be acceptable to the common Reader to give a short Account of what happen'd to  Troy  and the chief Actors in this Poem after the Conclusion of it  I need not mention that  Troy  was taken soon after the Death of  Hector  by the Stratagem of the wooden Horse the Particulars of which are describ'd by  Virgil  in the second Book of the  Aeneis  Achilles  fell before  Troy  by the Hand of  Paris  by the Shot of an Arrow in his Heel as  Hector  had prophesied at his Death  Lib    The unfortunate  Priam  was kill'd by  Pyrrhus  the Son of  Achilles  Ajax  after the Death of  Achilles  had a Contest with  Ulysses  for the Armour of  Vulcan  but being defeated in his Aim he slew himself thro' Indignation  Helen  after the Death of  Paris  married  Deïphobus  his Brother and at the taking of  Troy  betray'd him in order  to reconcile herself to  Menelaus  her first Husband who receiv'd her again into Favour  Agamemnon  at his return was barbarously murther'd by  Aegysthus  at the Instigation of  Clytaemnestra  his Wife who in his Absence had dishonour'd his Bed with  Aegysthus  Diomed  after the Fall of  Troy  was expell'd his own Countrey and scarce escap'd with Life from his adulterous Wife  Aegiale  but at last was receiv'd by  Daunus  in  Apulia  and shar'd his Kingdom 'Tis uncertain how he died  Nestor  liv'd in Peace with his Children in  Pylos  his native Countrey  Ulysses  also after innumerable Troubles by Sea and Land at last return'd in Safety to  Ithaca  which is the Subject of  Homer  's  Odysses  I must end these Notes by discharging my Duty to two of my Friends which is the more an indispensable piece of Justice as the one of them is since dead The Merit of their Kindness to me will appear infinitely the greater as the Task they undertook was in its own nature of much more Labour than either Pleasure or Reputation The larger part of the Extracts from  Eustathius  together with several excellent Observations were sent me by Mr  Broome  And the whole Essay upon  Homer  was written upon such Memoirs as I had collected by the late Dr  Parnell  Archdeacon of  Clogher  in  Ireland  How very much that Gentleman's Friendship prevail'd over his Genius in detaining a Writer of his Spirit in the Drudgery of removing the Rubbish of past Pedants will soon appear to the World when they shall see those beautiful Pieces of Poetry the Publication of which he left to my Charge almost with his dying Breath  For what remains I beg to be excus'd from the Ceremonies of taking leave at the End of my Work and from embarassing myself or others with any Defences or Apologies about it But instead of endeavouring to raise a vain Monument to my self of the Merits or Difficulties of it which must be left to the World to Truth and to Posterity let me leave behind me a Memorial of my Friendship with one of the most valuable Men as well as finest Writers of my  Age and Countrey One who has try'd and knows by his own Experience how hard an Undertaking it is to do Justice to  Homer  And one who I am sure sincerely rejoices with me at the Period of my Labours To Him therefore having brought this long Work to a Conclusion I desire to  Dedicate  it and to have the Honour and Satisfaction of placing together in this manner the Names of Mr  CONGREVE  and of  A POPE  March    M
