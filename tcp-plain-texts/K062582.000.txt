Surreystreet  in the  Strand  in the th Year of his Age and on the  Sunday  following  January  th his Corps lay in State in the  Jerusalem  Chamber from whence the same Evening between the Hours of Nine and Ten it was carried with great Decency and Solemnity into King HENRY the VIIth's Chapel in  WestminsterAbbey  and Interred near the late Earl of  Godolphin  The PALL was supported by I the Duke of  Bridgewater  II Earl of  Godolphin  III Lord  Cobham  IV Lord  Wilmington  V The Honourable  George Berkeley  Esq  VI BrigadierGeneral  Churchill  And Colonel  Congreve  followed the Corps as Chief Mourner  CHARACTERS OF Mr  CONGREVE  IN  easy Dialogue  is FLETCHER's Praise  He mov'd the  Soul  but had not Power to  raise  Great JOHNSON did by  Strength of Judgment  please  Yet doubling FLETCHER  's Force  he wants his  Ease  In diff'ring Talents  Both  adorn'd their Age  One for the  Study  t'other for the  Stage  But  Both  to CONGREVE justly shall submit  ONE match'd in  Judgment  BOTH o'ermatch'd in  Wit  In  Him  All Beauties of this Age we see  ETHEREGE  's Courtship  SOUTHERN  's Purity  The  Satire Wit  and  Strength  of manly WYCHERLEY  DRYDEN  Mr  Addison  's Character OF THE Old  BATCHELOR  See  The TATLER N  o    IN the Character which gives Name to this Play there is excellently represented the Reluctance of a battered Debaucheé to come into the Trammels of Order and Decency He neither languishes nor burns but frets for Love The Gentlemen of more regular Behaviour are drawn with much Spirit and Wit and the  Drama  introduced by the Dialogue of the first Scene with uncommon yet natural Conversation The Part of  Fondlewife  is a lively Image of the unseasonable Fondness of Age and Impotence  Sir  Richard Blackmore  's CHARACTER OF THE Mourning Bride  See  His  Preface  to  Prince  ARTHUR Fol  THIS  Poem  has received and in my Opinion very justly universal Applause being look'd on as the most perfect  Tragedy  that has been wrote in this Age The  Fable  as far as I can judge at first Sight is a very artful and masterly Contrivance the  Characters  are well chosen and well  delineated that of ZARA is admirable The  Passions  are well touch'd and skilfully wrought up The  Diction  proper clear beautiful noble and diversified agreeably to the Variety of the Subject  Vice  as it ought to be is punish'd and  oppressedInnocence  at last rewarded  Nature  appears very happily imitated excepting one or two doubtful Instances thro' the whole Piece in which there are no immodest Images or Expressions no wild unnatural Rants but some Exceptions being allowed all Things are chaste just and decent  This  Tragedy  as I said before has mightily obtained and that without the unnatural and foolish Mixture of  Force  and  Buffoonery  without so much as a  Song  or a  Dance  to make it  more agreeable By this it appears that as a sufficient Genius can recommend itself and furnish out abundant Matter of Pleasure and Admiration without the paultry Helps above named so likewise that the Taste of the Nation is not so far deprav'd but that a regular and chaste Play will not only be forgiven but highly applauded  Major  PACK  's SENTIMENTS IN His  Essay  on  Study  CONGREVE of all the Moderns seems to me to have the rightest Turn for  Comedy  In all his Plays there is a great deal of  lively  and  uncommon Humour  and such as yet for the most Part is a  Picture  of  true Life  Besides he hath raised the Vein of  Ridicule  and made the STAGE which had been too much prostituted to the Mob  edifying  to Persons of the  first Condition And as his  Fable  is  Diverting  so is it wrought according to the  strictest Rules  The following EPISTLE  Of rightly improving the present Time  written to Lord  Cobham  is here printed from a Manuscript of the Author with which I was obliged by a Person of the first Rank The Public having been notoriously abused by a very erroneous Copy surreptitiously obtained by one LEWIS in  CoventGarden  and vended under the Cover of A DODD and E NUTT  VERSES To the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount  Cobham  Of Improving the present Time  SINCEREST Critic of my Prose or Rhime  Tell how thy pleasing STOWE  The Name of his Lordship's SEAT in  Buckinghamshire  employs thy Time  Say COBHAM what amuses thy Retreat  Or Stratagems of War or Schemes of State  Dost thou recal to Mind with Joy or Grief  Great  MARLBRO  's Actions That immortal  Chief  Whose slightest Trophy rais'd in each Campaign  More than suffic'd to signalize a Reign  Does thy Remembrance rising warm thy Heart  With Glory past where Thou thy self hadst Part  Or dost thou grieve indignant now to see  The fruitless End of all thy Victory  To see th' Audacious Foe so late subdu'd  Dispute those Terms for which so long they su'd  As if BRITANNIA now were sunk so low  To beg that PEACE she wonted to bestow  Be far that Guilt be never known that Shame  That ENGLAND shou'd retract her  rightful Claim  Or ceasing to be dreaded and ador'd  Stain with her Pen the Lustre of her Sword  Or dost thou give the Winds afar to blow  Each vexingThought and Heartdevouring Woe  And fix thy Mind alone on rural Scenes  To turn the level'd Lawns to liquid Plains  To raise the creeping Rills from humble Beds  And force the latent Springs to lift their Heads  On watry Columns Capitals to rear  That mix their flowing Curls with upper Air  Or dost Thou weary grown these Works neglect  No Temples Statues Obelisks erect  But catch the morning Breeze from fragrant Meads  Or shun the Noontide Ray in wholsom Shades  Or slowly walk along the mazy Wood  To meditate on all that's wise and good  For Nature bountiful in Thee has join'd  A Person pleasing with a worthy Mind  Not given the Form alone but Means and Art  To draw the Eye or to allure the Heart  Poor were the Praise in Fortune to excel  Yet want the Way to use that Fortune well  While thus adorn'd while thus with Virtue crown'd  At Home in Peace Abroad in Arms renown'd  Graceful in Form and winning in Address  While well you think what aptly you express  With Health with Honour with a fair Estate  A Table free and elegantly neat  What can be added more to mortal Bliss  What can he want that stands possest of This  What can the fondest wishing Mother more  Of Heaven attentive for her Son implore  And yet a  Happiness  remains  unknown  Or to  Philosophy  reveal'd  alone  A  Precept  which unpractis'd renders vain  Thy flowing Hopes and Pleasure turns to Pain  Shou'd Hope and Fear thy Heart alternate tear  Or Love or Hate or Rage or anxious Care  Whatever Passions may thy Mind infest  Where is that Mind which Passions ne'er molest  Amidst the Pangs of such intestine Strife  Still  think the  PRESENT DAY  the  LAST  of  LIFE  Defer not till to  Morrow  to be  Wise  To  Morrow's  SUN to  Thee  may never  rise  Or shou'd to  Morrow  chance to cheer thy  Sight  With her enliv'ning and unlooktfor  Light  How grateful will appear her  dawning Rays  As Favours  unexpected  doubly  please  Who thus can think and who such Thoughts pursues  Content may keep his Life or calmly lose  All Proofs of this Thou may'st thy self receive  When Leisure from Affairs will give thee Leave  Come see thy Friend retir'd without Regret  Forgetting Care or striving to forget  In easy Contemplation soothing Time  With Morals much and now and then with Rhime  Not so robust in Body as in Mind  And always undejected tho' declin'd  Not wond'ring at the World's new wicked Ways  Compar'd with those of our Forefathers Days  For Virtue now is neither more or less  And Vice is only vary'd in the Dress  Believe it  Men  have ever been the  same  And  Ovid  's GOLDEN AGE is but a  Dream  WILLIAM CONGREVE  THE TRUE COPY OF AN  AFFIDAVIT  Made before one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the City of  Westminster  THAT  four  LADIES whom the Deponent does not care to Name repair nightly to a certain convenient Place near St  James  's to meet their GALLANTS of the first Rank whom your Deponent will not Name but so far describe them that  two  of them are  Sallow  and  two  of the  ruddy  Complexion and that he verily believes they were most abominably painted  The LADIES when they begin their Gambols call their GALLANTS by the fond Nicknames of  Hercules Cupid Pit  and the  Gardiner  After a plentiful Service of the most costly Fare they begin their  Tricks  which they play like the  Tumblers  in  BartholomewFair  upon a Carpet  strip is the Word  nay your Deponent has known them strip a Gentleman who came accidently into the House At  first  they begin pretty courtly at least in their Expressions as  Madam by your leave  or so which the LADIES are so good as  seldom to deny  Afterwards it is shameful to describe the  Tricks  that are play'd by this  lewd Pack  By  an established  Rule  each  Lady  has the Choice of her  Gallant  in her  Turn  and some have been known so unreasonable after they have had  Three  to call for a  Fourth  Your Deponent has seen a  Lady  on her  Back  a  Man  o'Top of  her  and a  Lady  o'Top of  him  and he avers it has been known that a  Court Valet  has  stript them all  Sometimes they are thrown on their  Backs  sometimes on their  Bellies  now higgledy piggledy and anon they are  all  o'Top of  one another  and if  any one  is call'd upon they are oblig'd  to show  ALL Of the same Nature is their Discourse your Deponent has often overheard them talking of their  Aes  with the same Familiarity as their  Faces I have a Black  one says one and named the  Thing  directly  mine is better than yours  says the other  and Names her  Thing must I be laught at  says a Third  because I have a red one  There is  one monstrous Thing  that your Deponent is almost ashamed to mention after  Six  a  Lady  has asked  if they could do no more  nay a certain  Lady  has been known to play all the  Tricks over  by  her self  Your Deponent likewise avers that he has full Proof after the LADIES have been tired with their GALLANTS they have called for  fresh ones  In short the aforesaid LADIES have not only  spent their PinMoney but their Husband's Estates  upon  Hercules Cupid Pit  and the  Gardiner  and when they want more Money they commonly  Pawn  their  Jewels  c  Westminster ss  Jurat Coram me  T T  PS  The above  Information  is a faithful Description of the GAME of
