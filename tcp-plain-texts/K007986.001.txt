 MEMOIRS  OF THE PRESENT STATE OF THE Court and Councils OF SPAIN  In Two Parts  With the true Reasons why this Vast Monarchy which in the last Century made so considerable a Figure in the World is in this so Feeble and Paralytick  Done into  English  by  T Brown  Utile Dulci  LONDON  Printed for  D Brown  without  TempleBar    T Horn  at the  Royal Exchange    T Bennet  in St  Paul  's  ChurchYard  and  B Tooke  in  Fleetstreet    TO His Honest Friend Mr  WILLIAM PATE  Of  London  WoollenDraper  I Know no occasion wherein all sorts of People have taken greater liberty than in their Dedications both in regard of the Persons to whom the Complement is made and of the things that are usually said in them All Authors pretend to disclaim flattery upon these subjects and yet were Historians to draw Great Men according as they are represented in Dedications abundance of Persons would pass with Posterity for men of wit who never made a jest in their lives and for honest Patriots who were only mere  Fripons  at the bottom but tho most Authors are agreed to wheedle and flatter in their Dedications yet I see they are not so well agreed in the choice of their Patron some have chose whole Corporations or Societies for this Office and indeed this conduct would be politick enough if the Parties who are concerned in the Dedication were obliged to espouse the Author's quarrel others have gone a step further and Dedicated their Books to the respective Countries where they live and lastly some of a more Universal spirit have offered them to the whole World in general without any restrictions or limitations as it consists of the four known Parts  Europe    Asia    Africk  and  America  and comprehends persons of all sorts and characters those that can read as well as those that cannot and those that have a Religion as well as those that have none  at all But the generality of Writers decline this course of Dedication because Bodies Politick and Countries and the World it self as large as it is seldom reward the Author for as we say what is every mans business is no mans business and therefore they generally make choice of particular persons and those for the greatest part of the best Estates and Fortunes not because an Illustrious name gives any better protection to a Book than a Meaner would do altho this is always pretended but because such Persons are best able to reward an Author and consider him for his incense As I never knew a bad Book sell a farthing the better for having a gaudy Title prefixed to it so a good one never fared the worse because it appeared without a fine  Fiocco  For in short if the world has a mind to be censorious a Person of Quality's name is as feeble an Amulet against the Criticks as a Silver Horseshoe nailed upon a threshold would be against Witchery and Possession for I am of opinion that an Horseshoe made of Iron is full as powerful a preservative as the other Now I  two reasons Mr  Pate  to address the following Translation to your self the first is because you are my Friend with whose entertaining learned Conversation I have been often diverted and the next is because I can approach you without any of that Cerem  and Fine  which uses to embarras a young Author so much when he addresses himself to Quality  as he is obliged to say several things against his Cons  ence so he cannot assume that familiarity and  ness which makes all sorts of Discourses agreeable However I would not have you think that I am so unreasonable as to desire you to stand Surety or what in a few years will become a scandalous word with us Godfather to my Translation because I am sensible there are several faults in it nor to stand up for the Author of this Epistle for then you must resolve to combat all comers and geers All I require of you is  that if any of your acquaintance should enquire either after the Book or the Translator you would only tell them that the Book gives a good account of a certain Prince's Court who at this present writing is gazed at by all  Europe  and that the Translator is a very honest Fellow who between a little  French  and less  Latin  makes a shift to get a sorry Livelihood  I have been often reproached and particularly by your self for sitting idle a whole year and writing nothing of my own now tho I must confess a certain party amongst us has given us almost daily provocations to encounter them yet I find they are a generation that are never to be edified by Satyr and indeed all wholsome advice is effectually lost upon them Suppose you or I should tell honest Mr  Partridge  yonder of  CoventGarden  that it was not civilly done of him to leave the Thirtieth of  January    GoodFriday  and the Twenty ninth of  May  all at a clap cut of his Almanack and that  John Gadbury  and he may now shake hands together like a couple of Bigotted Rascals as they are perhaps another year as who knows how far a turbulent Reformer's zeal may carry him he will leave us never an Apostle in the Calendar to the utter confusion of the poor People in the Country who make no other use of the Apostles but only to direct them to the next Horserace or Fair To say the truth we have too many ridiculous follies and divisions amongst us ever to be cured by writing which puts me in mind of what Mr  Burgess  who has made all the Town merry with his Preaching said lately upon this Argument  We  Englishmen crys he  have been famous in all ages for our Wars and Jars and strife and life and so forth Why what do you think  Virgil  said of you sixteen hundred years ago Even  Penitus toto divises orbe Britannos i e  the  Britains  are the most divided people in the whole world  Thus you see Mr  Pate  what little encouragement a  man has to write since it is so unlikely that he should ever cure any of those distempers that are so in inveterate in our Climate but I have a more particular reason still behind which obliges me to sit a spectator and purely respects my self for as I have had the ill luck to displease the Moderate Party by attacking the merits of the Comprehension in my Dialogue so I have fallen under the indignation of the Criticks by being too profuse and lavish of my Similies As for the first I have nothing to say to them because they are a sort of Gentlemen to whom I never designed to make my Court and as for the last before I go about to justifie my self I will tell you a short Story I happened some years ago to make a Visit to an honest decayed old Captain in  Alsatia  and his Chamber was a perfect Wilderness Pipes and Napkins and ends of Candles and old Cloaks were jumbled all together but what was most remarkable a Loaf and a Cheese lay upon his Closesteel I asked him the reason of it and the Captain honestly told me that he did it only for want of  And this Mr  Pate  was my own Case exactly for there were several Persons in the world for whom I had a kindness and these for want of a better convenience I was often sorced to throw into a Simile and to say the truth some of them were such sad wretches that they did not deserve to have a Paragraph bestowed upon them  But now to speak a word or two in behalf of these Memoirs I am in good hopes they will be favourable  ved because they give us a true Idea of the  Spanish  Court with which the generality of men amongst us are utterly unacquainted and lastly because they p  vide an agreeable entertainment to all sorts of people For here is Rain and Sunshine and Earthquakes and Shows and Masquerades and Processions and the Lord knows how much History in Sippits to divert the  lous Admirers  Stow  and  Ho  enshead  And  then for Persons of better Palates here are abundance of Political reflections and judicious observations with the true reasons how this vast Monarchy which in the last Century made so considerable a figure in the world is in this become so feeble and Paralytic I will only take notice of one Instance among the rest to give you a true taste of this Author's Ingenuity Don  Juan  while the administration of affairs was lodged in his hands removed a poor Dominican from  Salamanca  which place you know a certain Doctor who pretends he has received more stripes on his Back than St  Paul  and all his Brethren did has made remarkable in Story by the Chimerical Degree he took there and made him the King's Confessor He thought by this means to have secured the Monk for ever to his own Interests and to have had a trusty Confident upon all occasions near his Majesty's Person but he found himself mightily mistaken in his expectation for this Beast of a Religious soon abandoned his Patron's party and herded amongst his profest Enemies  Some People  says this Author  pretend that he did it out of a Principle of Conscience but as for my self I am of another opinion It is impossible that Ingratitude should ever flow from any good Principle  I am sorry that this honest Doctrine is not in better Reputation with some People amongst us for I am satisfied that no pretence whatever can atone for so black and ungenerous a Sin as Ingratitude is  I should here according to the laudable Custom of all Authors take occasion to say something in your praise but besides that I will not offer that Violence to your Modesty I cannot handsomely commend you for so great a variety of Learning in so much Youth but at the expence of the City and you know I have too great a respect for our Honourable Metropolis to do any thing of that nature or indeed without a reproach to our selves who cannot pretend such excuses as the perpetual  distractions of Trade and Business Indeed if your good fortune in the world prove answerable to your merits you may for all I know dye a richer man than  Gresham  or  Sutton  But I must tell you my dear Friend that good Fortune and Merit are two as different things as any are in the world I knew a Gentleman who made a pleasant remark upon this occasion I have said he in my time laid out for two things  viz  Preferment and a Red Nose with as much zeal and applicaiton as any man in Town To attain the last I have dutifully drank my Gallon of Claret every night and a dull sober Sot a Neighbour of mine with his single penurious Pint has arrived to it before me and as for the former I have wearied out my Patience in waiting at Court and at Noblemens Levees and yet could never stumble upon any and so he concluded that several men come by Preferment and Red Noses who never deserved either of them  After all Mr  Pate  if my wishes will do you any good I wish you store of Customers but never a Poet or Courtier or disbanded Captain or Player amongst them all May I be so fortunate as to behold you advanced to the highest Pinacle of honour in the City to furnish new matter for  Elkanah Settle  's Triumphs of  London  to sentence light Butter and Bread on Horseback to terrify Sabbathbreakers and those that forget to hang out their Lights to appear in the next Edition of  Baker  or  Stow  and arrive to the Priviledge of sleeping in your Gold Chain at  Guildhall  Chappel In short may you be the wealthiest happiest man within the Bills of Mortality and may you ever continue to love  Your Friend and Servant  T Brown  AN ACCOUNT OF THE COURT OF SPAIN  WE must not expect to find in a general History those particular Relations of things that usually entertain the Reader better than the History it self but when any person is once acquainted with them he often reflects upon them with a great deal of Pleasure I imagine I may without any flattery pretend my self capable of writing several secret Passages that happened at  Madrid  from the year to the year However I think it not amiss to begin these Memoirs from the time of  Philip  the IV in order to render the following Discourse more intelligible and to give the Reader a better Idea of the Genius of the  Spanish Court  Elizabeth  of  France  his Queen being dead he esponsed  Mary Ann  of  Austria  Daughter of the Emperor  Ferdinand  and Sister of him that reigns at present She was young of a fair flaxen complexion her humour was lively and pleasant and she was no less agreeable than witty  She departed from  Vienna  in order to go to  Spain  in the year She loved the ArchDuke her Brother very affectionately and as both of them were weeping when they took their leave of one another she demanded of him what lay in her power to do for his service My dear Sister says he it lies in your power to have an Infanta there which you may give to me in marriage This accident is so much the more observable because the ArchDuke having at that time an Elder Brother who died afterwards King of the  Romans  and being himself designed for the Ecclesiastic State there was little probability that he should ever arrive to the Empire and marry as it since fell out the Eldest Daughter of the Queen his Sister  Amongst several other persons whom the Emperor gave the Queen his Daughter to accompany her into  Spain  he chose Father  John Evrard Nitard  a  German  Jesuit to be her Confessor His extraction was mean and obscure and he employed almost all his thoughts in the advancing of his fortune He was of a supple complaisant temper he exactly studied the respective characters of those persons to whom he belonged and took care never to differ much from them as to matters of opinion He finished his Studies in the Jesuits College at  Vienna  and there took upon him the Habit of his Order and afterwards was sent to govern one of their  Seminaries in which Office he acquitted himself very well When he came back again to  Vienna  he began to make himself known in the world and several Ladies of the Court desired him to be their Spiritual Director they omitted no opportunity to do him all the good offices they could with the Emperor and in fine spoke in such advantageous Terms of him that he was well enough contented to let the Queen take him along with her  This Princess was extreamly surprized at all the  Spanish  Customs which those who came to wait upon her from the King caused her to observe in the first Days of her Voyage I have been told that as she arrived to a certain City under the Dominion of the King of  Spain  where the principal Commodities of the place consisted in Frocks Wastcoats and Silk Stockings they made her a present of a great quantity of them of different Colours But her  Major Domo  who religiously observed the  Spanish  gravity despised the present and so taking up a Bundle of Silk Stockings threw them at the heads of the Deputies of the Town  Aveis de Saber  says he to them in a very furious Tone  que las Reynas de Espagna no teinen piernas  that is to say  I would have ye to know that the Queens of  Spain  have no Legs  meaning that they are so far elevated above others by vertue of their Rank that they have no Feet to touch the Ground like the rest of their Sex However it was the young Queen who was not as yet acquainted with the Niceties of the Spanish Language took it in the literal Sense and began to weep  saying that she was fully determined to go back to  Vienna  and if she had known before her departure from thence that they design'd to cut  off her Legs she would rather have died than stirred a Foot  It was no difficult Matter to assure her of the contrary and she continued her Voyage  When she came to  Madrid  they told the King of this innocent Simplicity of his Queen he was so mightily pleased at the Story that he vouchsafed to laugh a little at it and this was the most extraordinary thing in the world for him to do for whether it proceeded from affectation or was the effect of his Constitution it was observed of him that he never laugh'd above thrice in all his Life  The King show'd a great respect for Father  Nitard  because he was the Queen's Confessor who reposed an intire Confidence in him but whatever desires she had to see him advanced he left him peaceably in his post without conferring any other Dignities upon him and he had unquestionably continued a long time in the same condition if the King had not hapned to die  When that Prince found himself to be dangerously ill and saw he could not bequeath the care of his Kingdoms to Cardinal  Sandoval  upon whose Management of Affairs he always depended because he was at that time extremely sick and to say the truth died but hours after him he made his Will wherein he ordered that the Queen his Spouse should be Regent of the Kingdom and Governess of the young Prince who was then four years and an half old  Since the time of  Don Loys de Haro  the Kings of  Spain  have had no  Privado  or chief Minister The Duke  di Medina de las Torres  had the Management of the Northern Adairs and the Count  de Castrillo  of the rest  he named the Cardinal of  Arragon  Archbishop of  Toledo  and Inquisitor General the Count of  Castrillo  President of  Castile  the  Count  de Penarauda    Don Cristoval Crespi  Chancellor of  Arragon  and the Marquiss  d'Aytona  to the end that these six Ministers should assist the Queen in her Councils and thus the King died in the month of  September    The six Ministers that composed the Junta were those that were or should be Archbishop of  Toledo  the President of  Castile  ViceChancellor of  Arragon  and Inquisitor General And besides these a Grandee of  Spain  and a Counsellor of State  The Queen resented the great Loss she sustained with abundance of Sorrow but she had been still more sensible of it if she had found her self in the Condition of the other Queens of  Spain  who are obliged to enter into a Convent when they are Widows unless the King orders the contrary before his Decease Nor was she insensible of the Sweets of Governing The first use she made of her Authority was in favour of Father  Nitard  For  Don Pascal  of  Arragon  having been made Archbishop of  Toledo  and grand Inquisitor in the place of Cardinal  Sandoval  the Queen sent for him and by her repeated importunities prevailed with him to quit the last of these two Dignities  The Cardinal of  Arragon  being Grand Inquisitor and afterwards named to the Archbishoprick of  Toledo  quitted the post of grand Inquisitor because he could not have two places in the Junto  He could not be brought to comply with this Request without a great deal of trouble for he almost chose rather to be Inquisitor General than Archbishop of  Toledo  although that Archbishoprick is worth Thousand Crowns  per annum  But he was not able to refuse the Queen a thing she so passionately desired who as soon as she saw her self in a capacity to dispose of that important Charge bestow'd it upon her Consessor  As she engaged her self in this Affair of her own proper Inclination without consulting any thing else but the desire she had to see him made superior to the other Ministers so she took occasion to discourse of it to them who immediately began to murmur amongst themselves  They read over the will of the late King where they found it expresly ordered that the Queen should do nothing without consulting their advice and notwithstanding all this precaution of the deceased they saw with no little concern that she had without ever communicating the matter to them disposed of one of the most considerable Offices in the Kingdom and that to a meer Stranger who had been born and bred up in the  Altho 'tis very true that he had been formerly a Lutheran and it was objected to him yet he vehemently de  ed it because it might have made him uncapable of that Office  Lutheran Religion till he was years of Age The desire they had to preserve their own Authority and the jealousie which is natural for all Men to have of a Favourite made them speak very fiercely in the matter However the Queen being informed of their discontent took the true Measures to appease them The charming Manner of her Deportment and particularly the obliging things she spoke to them upon this occasion prevailed with them to lay aside their Murmurs so they agreed to dispatch Letters of Naturalization for the Confessor without which it was impossible for him to execute the Office the Queen had given him  Altho all those difficulties that at first threatned to hinder the Elevation of Father  Nitard  were removed without any great Trouble yet he did not fail to raise several secret Enemies upon  himself who envied his growing Fortune They beheld with great Disdain and Impatience the extraordinary Confidence that the Queen reposed in him for she determined nothing without advising with him and so great was his Credit and Interest with her that he durst offer to resolve things of the greatest Importance without speaking a word about them to the Queen  Don Juan  was one of those that was the most offended at the Advancement of Father  Nitard  He was sensible that they would turn him out of all by little and little upon this Score he gave way intirely to the Father Confessor whom the Q had made Counsellor of State he then retired to  Consuegra  the ordinary Residence of the Grand Prior of  Castile  of the order of  Malta  and said very imperiously  that after he had seen himself President of the Privy Council of the King his Father he could never endure a Companion that was so much his Inferior  But the Queen who was wholly busied in advancing her chief Minister never disquieted her self with thinking what Reflections People might make upon him so that without taking the least notice of  Don Juan  's discontent she suffered him to depart and he continued a long time without visiting the Court until the Queen sent him particular Orders at  Aranjues  whither he was gone to divert himself to come immediately for  Madrid  upon some important Affairs which she was willing to communicate to him  He was the natural Son of King  Philip  IV and a certain Actress whose name was  Maria Calderona  He was privately brought up at  Ocana  near  Madrid  and of all the natural Sons that King had he only acknowledged him whether it were because he loved his Mother better than any of his other Mistresses and to say the  truth she was the most charming person in the World or because Count  d'Olivarez  procured this good Fortune for him for 'tis commonly given out that the Count had a Son named  Don Julian de Gusman  whom he had a mind to own and therefore used this Artifice of perswading the King to begin with  Don Juan  that so he might follow his Example  Whatever the matter was  Philip  loved this young Prince very tenderly altho some people suspected he was the Son of the Duke of  Medina  of the House of  Gusman  who had formerly been passionately in love with the young  Calderona  and was in his time the most accomplish'd handsom Cavalier in  Spain  and  Don Juan  very much resembled him But if some persons were of this Opinion others could never believe it especially when they considered the great kindness and fatherly affection that the King had for him and besides reflected upon his extraordinary good Qualities which declared him to be worthy to be the Son of so great a Monarch He was brave even to a Contempt of all Dangers whatever gallant and agreeable wellshaped obliging liberal and a person of great Honour he had abundance of Wit and was Master of a Genius that extended it self to all Arts and Sciences As there is ne're a Court in  Europe  where natural Sons are treated with such advantageous Distinctions as they are in  Spain  so this Prince could scarce perceive that the unhappiness of his Birth did in the least prejudice his Advancement and tis indeed a certain truth that we see in this Country the legitimate Sons bred up with those that are not so in the same father's house without any Distinction between one and the other But this Custom is not altogether observed with relation to the natural Sons of the Kings of  Spain  For example they never bestow the title of  Infante  upon them and  Don Juan  who passionately desired to have it used his utmost efforts to accomplish it but had not the fortune to succeed in his designs  From the year the King had given him the Government of the  Low Countries  He held as his proper Right the Government of the  Low Countries  of  Burgundy  and  Charolois  and he always enjoyed it excepting the time when the Archduke  Leopold  governed there  Don Juan  contributed very much towards the reducing the Kingdom of  Naples  to the  Spanish  Obedience He took  Piombino  and  Portolongone  and in all his Campaigns he perform d a World of Actions that equally testified his Bravery and Conduct  The King his Father having conceived no less an esteem than Tenderness for him Communicated to him the most weighty Affairs of State and chose him to be chief of an Assembly of the chief Ministers of his Kingdom  He was scarcely arrived at  Madrid  but a Council was held where he came to be informed that the King of  France  was resolved to espouse the interests of his Queen to whom  Brabant  and some other states of the  Low Countries  escheated by right of Devolution upon the Death of the Infant  Don Balthazar  her Brother that his most Christian Majesty had published a Manifesto wherein he proved the Justice of his claim and that not thinking himself obliged to consume any time in unprofitable Contestations he had turned his Arms towards that side of the Country that he had marched his Troops with incredible diligence and made considerable conquests  as soon as ever he appeared Upon a serious examination of the present state of the Monarchy they were convinced that it was impossible at the same time to maintain War against  France  and  Portugal  and that it was necessary for them to lay hold of a certain conjuncture that made a very plausible appearance that  Don Alphonso  King of  Portugal  having by his extravagant conduct lost the hearts of his People was dispossest of the Government and his Subjects freed from the Allegiance they ow'd him that the Infanta  Don Pedro  his Brother had taken upon him the Administration of Affairs that things of this considerable importance could neither be begun nor ended without some disturbance during which they must have occasion for their own Troops and therefore if it was judged expedient they should lay hold of this opportunity to advance proposals for a Peace  After every one had delivered his own opinion of the matter the Queen came to this conclusion A Letter was dispatched to the Marquiss  de Liche  who was at that time Prisoner of War at  Lisbon  wherein he had all necessary instructions given him In fine he managed the affair so dexterously that the Regent  Don Pedro  listened favourably to the proposals and so a Treaty of Peace was concluded on the th of  Jan    This News was entertained at  Madrid  with a great deal of satisfaction because the affairs of  Flanders  grew every day worse and worse and it was necessary to take some speedy measures to preserve it or else to abandon it for good and all New Levies of Soldiers were ordered in  Gallicia  and elsewhere and the Queen cast her eyes upon  Don Juan  to send him thither to command the Troops for besides that no Body was more capable of so great a Trust than he was she  had observed that during the little stay he made at  Madrid  his Aversion to F  Nitard  daily increased and this reason alone was sufficient to incline her to resolve upon his Removal She was not able to indure those biting Reflections which  Don Juan  by way of Raillery very Liberally bestowed upon the Father Confessor One time among the rest when the Ministers demanded of him who was fit to send against the King of  France  I am clearly of Opinion says he that we had best send Father  Nitard  he is a Saint to whom Heaven can refuse nothing the post wherein we behold him at present is an undeniable Proof of those miracles which he can command upon all occasions  The Confessor answered with a very Melancholly Air  That he was of a Profession which taught him to hope every thing from the Divine Mercy but that it did not belong to his Function to be a General of an Army Oh my dear Father replies  Don Juan  and don't we see your Reverence every day Employed in things that are full as unsuitable to your Profession  As I said before it was resolved to send the Prince with the New Supplies to  Flanders  and a Recruit of nine hundred thousand Crowns with which they Furnished him out of the Silver that was brought in the Gallions  Necessary Orders were likewise dispatched to  Cales  and so the Admiral who had Charge given of this Sum set Sail with eight Vessels from thence at the same time when  Don Juan  was Marching towards the  Groyne  where the Rendezvous was appointed to be  The  French  Fleet Cruised upon the Coasts of  Gallicia  and was Composed of Vessels and Fireships  Don Juan  finding his Forces much Inferiour to the Enemy was not willing to hazard all in a Fight where in all probability he could  not avoid a total Defeat Therefore he thought it more advised to send his Troops in small Bodies to  Flanders  where they arrived without any Danger  The formidable Power of his most Christian Majesty not only alarm'd the  Spaniard  but the  English  and  Dutch  who after a bloody War at Fast concluded a Peace at  Breda  in and having ceast from all Acts of Hostility towards one another entred into a League in the beginning of to oblige the King of  Spain  to accept of one of the two alternatives proposed by the King of  France  who still persisted in his Offers  After their Example the Archbishop of  Triers  the Duke of  Bavaria  the Elector  Palatino  and Duke  Ernest Augustus  of  Brunswick  Bishop of  Osnabruck  concerted their Resolutions for the common Safety and made a League whereby they obliged themselves to endeavour the adjusting the differences between  France  and  Spain  or else to declare War against either of the two Crowns that should refuse their Mediation and act against the Treaty The Pope likewise entred into the League and a Peace was concluded at  Aix la Chapelle  But these things were not so speedily determined but that other matters of consequence happened at  Madrid  and other places which strangely perplexed those persons that were interested and concerned in them  Don Juan  as was before mentioned was at  Corogne  upon the point of imbarquing himself when he received certain Informations of the Death of  Joseph Mallades  a Gentleman of  Arragon  whom he entirely loved It was told him to his unexpressible Amazement that he had been secretly arrested at  Madrid  about eleven a clock at Night and that  by an order of the Queen written by her own hand he was strangled two hours after The great care they took to keep this execution private only contributed to make it spread the faster and it was not doubted but that the Queen sacrificed this unfortunate Gentleman to the security of her Confessor  Don Juan  was extremely concerned at the Tragical Death of a person whom he loved so well and yet more enraged at the injury which he imagined himself to have directly received from Father  Nitard  resolved not to go to  Flanders  They would never have exposed me to the puisance of the most Christian King says he to  Don Diego de Valasco  for whom he had an extraordinary Affection but only with a design to compleat my Ruine They will certainly take care to keep back those Succours from time to time of which I shall stand in need and whatsoever good Conduct I may use in the Management of the War there is no Question to be made but that they will make me answerable for all the ill Success we meet with You see I am now at the Port and yet they have executed a Man who was guilty of no other Crime than of wearing the Character of my Friend What will they do then if I were once in  Flanders  all my Friends would undoubtedly find themselves exposed to the Malice and Hatred of the new Favourite  He scarched the most plausible Pretences he could think of toexcuse his going for  Flanders  For some days he feigned himself to be indisposed and sent word to the Queen that he was troubled with a Defluxion on his Breast that the Physicians had made him apprehend the fatal Consequences of it if he undertook so long a Voyage and therefore he beseeched her to dispense  with him An Alteration so little expected made a great Noise at Court and gave no small Mortification to her Majesty and Father  Nitard  They easily guessed at the Cause and if they had imagined the Prince was no farther off perhaps they had not Sentenced  Malladas  to die so soon The Queen ordered  Don Juan  to resign his employ to the Constable of  Castile  who was to go to  Flanders  in his room and also Commanded him to go immediately to  Consuegra  without Presuming to come nearer than Leagues of  Madrid  which he accordingly Obey'd But it seems this Obedience was not enough to satisfie the Queen's Indignation who was so Exasperated at him that in  August  she carried into the Council with her own Hands a Decree against the Prince wherein she represented to them  the Disobedience he had shown at so pressing a Juncture and the Reasons which ought to have Obliged him to set Sail altho' the Indisposition he pretended had been really True that a Lye from a Subject to his Sovereign was always thought Worthy of the highest Punishments and especially under such important Circumstances  Don Juan  was informed of all that this Decree contained against him and he was the more sensibly concerned at this ill Usage since he had Trespassed so much upon Moderation in not making a louder Complaint of the Death of  Malladas  The Man that served altogether to estrange his Inclinations from the Queen was a Captain whose name was  Don Petro de Pinilla  who having asked leave to speak with the Queen threw himself at her Feet and Entertained her an hour in Private without any Bodies knowing what he said to her It is not doubted by what happened afterwards but that he discovered something of Importance against  Don Bernardo Pategno  Brother to  Don Juan  's chief Secretary because he was seized the next Morning with of his Servants These Informations were kept so Secret that no one knew the Matters they contain'd The Marquiss  de Salinas  Captain of the  Spanish  Guards received Orders from the Queen to Post away with fifty of the reformed Officers and Arrest the Prince at  Consuegra  but altho' he used the utmost diligence in this Affair yet he was not able to find him That as it happened did not prove Unlucky to him for  Don Juan  had about him at that time a great number of his Friends and Domesticks who would all have hazarded their Lives to preserve him from being taken but by his great Prudence he avoided the Exposing any single Man of them for being Advertised of what had passed he withdrew in time and only left a Letter behind him to the Queen dated  Octob  wherein he spoke to her with greater Liberty than he had hitherto used He there takes an occasion to acquaint her  That he would have certainly gone for  Flanders  if it had not been for the Surprizing and Tragical Death of his Friend  Malladas  that he had all the reason in the World to believe that Father  Nitard  was the Instrument and Author of it that so horrid an Injustice cried out aloud for Vengeance against the Man that had committed it that he found himself possest with an earnest Desire to contribute what lay in his Power towards the removal of so Wicked a Man that he humbly Beseeched her both for the good of the Kingdom in general as also for her Majesties Glory to consent to his Banishment that he hop'd he should never be constrained to have recourse to any other Methods than those of Prayer to chase him out of that place where his Presence was become  odious to all the World that he found himself obliged to go and seek a Sanctuary against the Violences of this Stranger and that this was a cruel necessity for a Person of his Quality that he hoped her Majesty would be pleased to make serious Reflections upon the whole and apply necessary Remedies accordingly  The Reading of this Letter awakened all the Resentment and Indignation that the Queen had naturally to  Don Juan  She flew into the greatest Passion imaginable and had made it appear in a terrible manner if the Grandees and People had not testified less Inclination for her I was a new Subject of Displeasure to the Queen and Father  Nitard  to see that all the World agreed to set themselves free from his Ministry and that they had the hardiness to tax him publickly with the murder of  Malladas  and the imprisonment of  Patigno  This obliged the Queen to set forth a Declaration wherein she assured the World that both those persons came to  Madrid  to execute the wicked Designs of  Don Juan  that she was fully inform'd of the whole by their own proper Confession and that she had never proceeded so far as to take away  Malladas  's life if she had not been assured of his Crime  At the same time Father  Nitard  printed and published a sort of an Apology in which he accuses  Don Juan  with having frequently endeavour'd to assassinate him he spoke of this design as a thing beyond Contest and declared his own innocence with relation to the Death of  Malladas  and the imprisonment of  Patigno  He pretended to give an undeniable Proof of this Assertion in alledging that when the former was strangled he was saying over his Breviary along with Frier  Bustos  and that when the second was arrested he  was setting his Papers in order in his Cabinet Then he took occasion to enlarge upon the Nobleness of his Birth and upon the considerable Services which his Ancestors had done for the Emperours This Article only served to set People on work to Examine the Obscurity of his Family He Addressed this writing to the Queen and she for her part forgot nothing that might make his Attestation be the better believed  Some time after she presented to the Council a second Complaint against the Prince charging him with having had his Nativity Calculated in  Flanders  in which 'twas easie to discover the high and mighty expectations with which he fed his Ambition That such an insufferable Curiosity had been always Punished as a Crime of High Treason that it was not only necessary to Examine the Fault but also the Quality of the Person that committed it that the debate was about a Man of Design who could by no means pretend to Sin out of Ignorance and an ungrateful rebellious Subject loaded with Favours and Rewards by the Crown that it was absolutely requisite to Chastise him for fear lest a connivance should Authorize his wicked Designs and put him in a Capacity of accomplishing them  The Prince had too many Friends not to find some amongst them who had the Courage to Defend him there was scarce any thing to be seen in all manner of company but multitude of writings the bitterness of which only served to animate the interested Parties and make them more Inveterate  Those that appear'd in behalf of  Don Juan  maintained that he was Incapable of forming so mean and low a Design as that of Assassinating Father  Nitard  that if it had ever entred into his Imagination the Execution of it could have been no difficult  Matter that the difference was only about a Stranger of an Ecclesiastic without Friends or Relations supported by a Queen who ought to have abandoned him to Vengeance when she was informed of his wicked Conduct that the best Proof one can bring to shew that the Prince had no inclination to do any such thing was because it was not done that far from endeavouring to take him off Privately he had demanded in publick to have him removed from his Ministry and that for attempting his removal he exposed himself to all the Indignation of the Queen That at the bottom Father  Nitard  would have no reason to complain of his ill Usage since he was permitted to retire with the Punishment only of a Pension of Crowns  per annum  which he has hitherto enjoyed besides some other Private Benevolences that don't appear that so considerable a Revenue one would think might Content the Ambition of a simple Ecclesiastic who was himself of so Vindicative a Nature that he would fain have Assassinated the Prince at  Barcelona  and  Consuegra  that it was not the Effect of any particular resentment which made  Don Juan  Press the Queen so earnestly to send him home to his own Country being generous enough to forget any Private Injuries but that he was too good a Subject to bear any longer with a Man whose rash and violent Counsels might some time or other prove the occasion of a general Revolution in the Kingdom of  Spain  To this they added several other things which I shall pass over in silence  The Court and the City were divided upon this Point every one engaging himself in the Affair either as his own Sentiments led him or as he was Influenced by the Reports of others Nay the Court Ladies entred into the quarrel  and for a Distinction of the Party they embraced some were called  Austrians  and others  Nitardines  Thus I have given you a Relation of what past at  Madrid  during the time that  Don Juan  kept himself at a distance from it and approached to  Barcelona  The Queen was Ignorant what way he took and her Disquietudes doubled upon her when she considered with her self what dangerous Effects an Affair of this Nature might carry along with it especially seeing it began with so much Heat When he was Arrived there he writ a very respectful Letter to the Queen but did not conceal the Resolution he had taken to Demand of her constantly the removal of her Confessor he advised her to it with very forcible Reasons but they only provoked her the more against him and she could never suffer her self to be perswaded that she ought to deprive her self of the Man in whom she reposed so intire a Co  ce and for whom she preserved so great an Affection  She found that  Don Juan  meddled with an Affair she had no Inclination to and that since the Council which the late King had Assigned her could find nothing to except against the Father's Conduct she was not obliged to gratifie an Aversion which the Prince had so unjustly entertained against him that it would be for her Glory to Testifie to the World the firmness of her Mind in this Rencounter and that if she Abandoned her Servants at the first Chimerical Objections that were raised against them it would be a dangerous Matter for any one to serve her  In fine the extream desire she had to keep Father  Nitard  with her furnished her with such specious Reasons that no Body durst Combat them  The Father on his Part knew not where to turn himself he was pleased without Question to  see himself beloved and protected by so great a Queen and to enjoy an absolute Power next to her but on the other hand he was not without sensible Emotions when he considered what an Enemy he had to deal with He was apprehensive of being poysoned or assassinated and tho the Council had not as yet spoken against him yet he was not ignorant that he was but ill beloved by all the Ministers And that if ever it was his Fortune to be turned out the greatest Part of the Grandees would commend the Courage and Constancy of  Don Juan  These Reflexions so palled his Spirits that he often went and threw himself at her Majesty's feet with Tears in his Eyes humbly to beg the favour of her to suffer him to depart but she always assur'd him of the Continuance of her Protection and forbad him any more to mention that thing which gave her so much Pain and Uneasiness  The Prince did not content himself w  writing to the Queen but writ also to the chief Ministers in such vehement Terms that they evidently saw what it was he desired to do with the Father Confessor and likewise that he would never depart from his Resolutions He pray'd them to second him with her Majesty and to represent to her of what a mighty Consequence it would be to the State to send this Stranger home  These Letters mightily augmented the Troubles of F  Nitard  his friends were afraid that  Don Juan  would betake himself to violent Methods and his Enemies had the Satisfaction to consider that the Prince would employ his utmost Efforts to turn him out of  Spain  But those that beheld the whole Scene calmly and without Passion judged that the Queens Obstinacy and the Opiniatrete of  Don Juan  would necessarily  involve the Kingdom in some great disorders where every thing would be equally confounded The Queen fell into the greatest Passion imaginable whenever the matter was mentioned to her and finding her person to be no where else in Safety she order'd the Cavalry to come to  Pardo  which is a Royal Palace within two Leagues of  Madrid  'Tis certain that if she had had less Fears upon her she had at that Moment declared  Don Juan  Rebel She communicated this Design to her Father Confessor who approved of this way of procedure well enough but others that were consulted about it opposed it with all their Might They represented to her  That in case this was done the Prince would no longer observe any Measures with her that perhaps he waited for a favourable Pretence to declare himself that he was brave in his own person well beloved by his Friends and besides had the people on his side that less causes have occasioned great Revolutions that there was nothing left but good Usage and Gentleness that could make him return to his Duty or at least convince him that nothing had been omitted to inspire him with a true Sense of it  Altho this Advice was extremely opposite to the Queens Resentments and by her good Will she would never have treated with a Prince by whom she supposed her self to be injured yet she was at last perswaded to follow this good Counsel So she wrote a very obliging Letter to him wherein she conjured him to return to  Corsuegra  and she engaged her Royal Word for the Security of his Person  Don Juan  made some Difficulty at first of obeying these Orders whether it were because he was apprehensive as he told the Queen of  putting himself into the Hands of Father  Nitard  whom he had but lately escaped or for some other reasons that are unknown But the Duke  d'Ossore  who was then at  Barcelona  spoke to him with so much Zeal and so vigorously Sollicited him to obey her Majesty's Orders that he submitted to his Reasons and so departed with three Companies of Horse which the Duke had given him for his Guard  The Queen having received Advice of it contrived to give him some Affronts upon the Road She knew that he was to pass through  Arragon  and therefore she writ to the States of that Kingdom to shew  Don Juan  no manner of Respect nay even to seek out some opportunities to disgust him but herein she was ill obey'd The States sent her word back again that they could not dispence with themselves from Paying to the Son of the late King and the Brother of their present Monarch those Devoirs that were due to his Quality and Merits To say the Truth they acquitted themselves herein with the greatest Zeal and when he approached  Saragossa  all the Inhabitants went out above two Leagues to meet him on the way The Press was so great that he had much ado to get through it they cried all with one voice  Let the King live and the Lord  Don Juan  let him always have the better of his Enemies ana Curses light on the Jesuit that Perssecutes him  Every one scatter'd Flowers before him such as the Season of the Year furnished them with and sprinkled him with perfumed Waters the Ladies better apparell'd than they used to be on the most Solemn Days made a double Lane for him with their Coaches the Air was filled with nothing but the Benedictions and Praises they  bestow'd upon him In a Word the Joy was Universal in this great City  The Queen and Father Confessor who received a faithful Relation of the whole proceedings were sensibly concerned She to see the Contempt wherewith her Orders were Entertain'd He to find himself so inveterately hated by the People  The Report of  Don Juan  's extraordinary Reception spread it self as far as  Madrid  and amongst several Persons that receiv'd it with Joy and Satisfaction there were many that Apprehended some Disorder at the return of the Prince  In Order to prevent those Evils that seemed to threaten them the Regidors and other Magistrates of that City Assembled on the first of  February  They sent four of their Body to the President of  Castile  to represent to him the great mischief that might be occasioned by  Don Juan  's Arrival with his Troops at a time when the Court was so weak and the People so insolent and disposed for a Revolt that notwithstanding the Prince was well Affectioned towards them yet he would not be able to prevent the lamentable Effects they had reason to fear  The President waited upon the Queen and the Council immediately met where it was ordered to dispatch a Courier to  Don Juan  with her Majesty's Orders to send back his Guards without delay  He received the Order but hastened his March making the Courier follow him two days on the third he gave him a Receipt for his Order and sent him back without any answer  In the mean time that he delay'd the Couriers coming back they were alarm'd at Court with the ill success of his Voyage and their uneasiness  was much increas'd in the Palace when they saw him sent back without any Letter Some of the Lords went thereupon to find out the President to desire him to tell the Queen that they were ready to undertake any thing in the World for her Service The Cavalry was drawn up together and Preparations were making at  Madrid  to sustain a Siege the event whereof appeared very doubtful altho they had to deal with a Prince who was only attended by Horse  'Twas in effect this Guard that occasioned the greatest trouble the Queen ordered the Marquess  de Penalva  to assemble the reformed Officers together with those that should offer themselves to go upon this occasion and tell the Prince that her Majesty ordered him to send back the three Troops of Horse he had brought along with him  The Marquess  de Penalva  was disposed to obey but he demanded an Order of the Council Royal and the Secretary of State refused to expedite it alledging that the Queen could do nothing without the Council of the Government and that she had never consulted them about this Affair The Queen being provoked sent the Secretary word  That he ought seriously to consider what Difficulties he was going to start at so ill an Exigence and how little they were to the purpose  The Cardinal  Arragon  the Count  de Penarauda  and the ViceChancellor came to wait upon her Majesty they represented to her that the Secretary was in the right and gave the President of  Castile  a severe Reprimand for giving way by his Counsels to an Order that might have produced very evil Consequences  They resolved at last not to take up Arms and to dissipate the Apprehensions the people  were under at  Madrid  'twas publickly proclaimed that  Don Juan  had sent back his Guards or that if he had not done it as yet yet he would send them back at the first warning  The Queen having no hopes at all of seeing her self obeyed by force betook her self to more gentle Methods to try if she could by that Conduct oblige  Don Juan  to send back his Soldiers She writ to him by  Don Diego de Velasco  who was his great Confident and the Letter was very courteous and civil  The Prince who came secretly to  Madrid  to discover the State of Affairs the Dispositions of his Friends and what he might be able to effect there very resolutely sent the Queen word again that there lay no Obligation upon him to expose himself to the Revenge of Father  Nitard  therefore he positively demanded to have him turn'd out of the Kingdom that after this were once done none of all her Subjects should pay a more dutiful Submission to her Orders than himself  This was to demand a thing of the Queen which she had no manner of inclination to grant The Nuncio  Borromée  the Council of State and the Grandees gave themselves a great deal of trouble to no purpose to adjust the matter In the mean time the Prince appeared so firm in his Resolution that all the World judged it would be very happy for the Confessor if he could escape with his Life He himself was sensible enough of the Danger he was in so he redoubled his Importunities with the Queen to suffer him to depart She returned him no answer but by her Tears and Sighs insomuch that he chose rather to expose his own Life to the utmost Extremity than disoblige her by leaving her Service  News arrived that the Prince was come with his Troops to  Torrejondardos  which is but four Leagues from  Madrid  Those that were of the Queens party were mightily disquieted at it and she her self was more afflicted than the rest They heard her several times repeat these words  Oh Heavens this good Father will be the first Sacrifice  The Council of the Government met and desired the Nuncio to carry  Don Juan  the Letter the Pope had written to him wherein he conjured him to preserve those Sentiments of respect and Submission for the Queen which a Subject ow'd his Soveraign  The Nuncio went to find him and came back about midnight No Body almost in this great City went to bed but attended his Return with impatience for they knew the occasion of his Journey and the people ran up and down the Streets in great Bodies asking each other who they were for The news the Nuncio brought back with him did not at all please the Queen he told her that he had earnestly requested the Prince to go to  Guadalajara  or at least to stay where he was a few days that new measures might be taken to satisfie him but that the Prince refused both the one and the other and said that if on the  Monday  following the Confessor would not go out of the Gate he would throw him out at the Window and enter  Madrid  on purpose to put it in execution It was afterwards known that this Negotiation passed after another manner  viz  that the Prince had agreed to let Father  Nitard  be with the Queen provided she would grant some advantages to him which he proposed but that the Nuncio who had no kindness for that Father was resolved to break the Treaty all to pieces  by concealing the favourable inclinations of  Don Juan  Father  Nitard  was informed of all that happened he Confessed the Queen the next morning and afterwards threw himself at her feet beseeching her not to expose him to the outrages which he might expect to suffer from an incensed Prince that his life was at stake and that there was no other way to preserve it but by submitting to the present necessity The Queen answered him with abundance of Tears that he should not disquiet himself at all for she would take care to set things to rights again  He was well enough satisfied of her own good will for him but he questioned whether her power answered her inclinations nevertheless he resolved at last that he would be torn in pieces by the people before he would leave  Madrid  without her Order So he tarried with her having all the Apprehensions upon him that a man who every moment expects his death can be capable of  These affairs came to this upshot at last that on  Monday  the  th  of  February  the great Court of the Palace was filled with numbers of people of all conditions who in a disorderly manner that was not easie to be suppressed loudly demanded to have the Confessor discarded without any more Delay  That no body was ignorant of what  Don Juan  had said to the Nuncio that the City would go near to be exposed to Plunder and Desolation for the sake of a Jesuit who was a Stranger and had no other merit to recommend him but his pleasing the Queen  The Duke  d'Infantado  and the Marquess  de Liche  seeing such a vast Multitude assembled together ran to the Queens Apartment who  was then in Bed She had not closed her Eyes all night long and had not enjoy'd one Moment of Rest having it seems received some information of what had past One of her Ladies whose name was  Donna Eugenia  was upon her Knees by her to comfort her in these Extremities  Alas  said the Queen to her  what signifies my Grandeur and these high Titles they give me since I am not allowed the Liberty to keep the good Man any longer with me upon whom the Consolation of my Life depends There is never a Lady in  Spain  but has the Priviledge of keeping her Chaplain and no Body finds Fault with it But I am the only Woman in the Kingdom that is persecuted upon this Score and whose Confessor must be taken away from her by Force  The Council sat immediately because the Disorder still increased in the City and it was to be feared that it would augment more and more Some of the Ministers who were in the Queens Interests were for finding out some Expedient to hinder the Departure of Father  Nitard  but others pretended there was no room left for an Accommodation and said that if the business was any longer delayed all would be lost That  Don Juan  would soon enter  Madrid  and the  Friends and Enemies would fare alike that their Debate at present was only about a poor Ecclesiastic whom the People hated even to Madness and never mentioned without the bitterest Exe+crations altho at the Bottom he never deserved them and was an honest Man  Her Majesty happening to be in Bed when the Duke  d'Infantado  and the Marquess  de Lich  demanded to speak with her they could no  see her because it is the Custom in  Spain  for n  Body to go into the Queens Chamber whe  she is gone to Bed So they went to the  Cava  cuela  which is a place under Ground belonging  to the Palace where the  Who is called in  Spain  Secretary  del Despacho  Univer    Secretaries of State abide They spoke to  Don Blasco de Loyola  and would have given him a Memoir to deliver to her Majesty but the great haste they made in running upto the Queens Apartment and afterwards in hurrying down Stairs again to the Privy Council together with the great ado they made to get in caused several persons that met them to follow after them so that when they entred the Chamber where the Ministers were assembled to inform themselves of what had past  These two Lords were not of the Junta of the Go  ernment  they found a great Rabble of People who entred along with them and began to cry out all together  Deliver us from the Jesuit and send him packing  The Ministers continued a while surprized and looking upon one another while the Rabble renewed their Importunities adding at the same time some Menaces against those that should offer to stand by the Father Confessor  Without demurring any longer upon the matter they resolved to send  Don Blasco de Loyola  to wait upon the Queen with a Decree with which they entrusted him He brought her word that the Council had determin'd that Father  Nitard  should depart  Madrid  within three hours warning The Order was already drawn and the Queen discovered no Emotion in reading it she signed it with great Steadiness of Mind and without shedding one Tear but being desirous that her Confessors removal should not seem to be extorted by Force but that he made an honourable Retreat she procured an Order of Leave to be drawn up in these Words  Whereas F  John Everard Nitard  of the Society of  Jesus  my Confessor Minister of State and Inquisitor General has humbly intreated me to give him leave to withdraw himself out of these Kingdoms altho I am fully satisfied not only of his integrity and his other good qualities but also of the great Zeal and Application wherewith he has always served the Crown yet nevertheless upon the account of his earnest Supplications as well as for divers other important reasons I have given him my Permission to go where he pleases And since I desire that this may be done in a manner that is suitable to his Merits and Dignity I have thought it expedient to give him his choice of going in the quality of Embassador Extraordinary either to  Germany  or  Rome  with all the Emoluments and Advantages that belong to that Charge Given at  Madrid  the    th of  February  As soon as  Don Blasco  was gone the Queen using no farther violence with her self to keep in her Tears shed them very plentifully and casting her self upon the bed with all the grief imaginable cryed out incessantly  Alas alas to what purpose is it to be a Queen and Regent  On the other hand the Council commanded the Cardinal of  Arragon  and the Count  de Penarauda  to go and acquaint Father  Nitard  with the order her Majesty had signed He who had long expected this Tempest seemed not to be surprized at the News but was perswaded by the Nuncio's importunities not to go to Council as he had designed for he told him the people were so highly incensed against him that he would infallibly run the risque of being torn to pieces if he offer'd to shew himself  The Superiors of the Jesuits were come to wait upon him to prepare him for this fatal Stroak The Admiral of  Castile  came thither also telling him with great Fierceness and the  freedom of Conversation that so peculiarly distinguishes Persons of Quality from others that he had drawn all these Misfortunes upon himself by his own ill Measures which he there particularly enumerated to him The Father who had been never accustomed to these Reprimands replyed that this Discourse was not fit for an Inquisitor General to hear before all the World  When the Cardinal of  Arragon  arrived he found the Father extremely afflicted The necessity of parting immediately without so much as taking leave of the Queen his Mistriss touch'd him to the quick The Cardinal was not able to refrain Tears at beholding it whether from a Consideration of the Incertainty of humane Affairs that have no sure Foundation or else from the particular Esteem he always had for him He offer'd to furnish him with a thousand Pistols for his Voyage and the Count  de Penarauda  with Letters of Exchange for thirty thousand Ducats but he would not accept of them saying that as he came thither a poor Ecclesiastic so he knew well enough how to depart from thence under the same Circumstances  The Cardinal comforted him as well as he was able and told him that he would accompany him to  Fuencaral  then he withdrew to leave him at Liberty to set his own things in Order and towards the Evening came to take him up in his Coach which was well guarded He asked him immediately whether all his things were ready I have no other things replies the Father save only my Habit and Breviary so they departed being accompanied by all the Officers of the Inquisition As soon as ever the people saw Father  Nitard  they fell a crying and throwing Stones at him and followed him with Curses and Imprecations  It happen'd well for him that he was in company with a person of the Cardinal's Dignity for otherwise he had been exposed to the fury of the Rabble The Grief that so rude a Treatment possess'd him with obliged him several times to say with Tears in his Eyes that God had now tryed him by throwing him into this Furnace of Tribulations and that he should be very happy to be found good Alloy As he passed through the Streets he said to the People who pursued him with contumelious Reproaches Farewel my Children farewel I am going  He was not willing to accept of the Embassy to  Rome  altho the Queen writ a very obliging Letter to him at  Fuencaral  and reiterated the Offer to him She sent him two thousand Pistoles for his Voyage to  Rome  some Precious Stones and an Augmentation of two thousand Crowns by way of Pension When he was gone his Domesticks found a Haircloth and some Disciplines in his Cabinet  When there was now no longer any Fear of displeasing the Father Confessor by shewing respect to  Don Juan  every one went to see him at  Consuegra  and testified their Zeal for him He wrote to the Queen to thank her for sending away his inveterate Enemy as well as that of the State and prayed her to give him leave to come to Court and kiss the Kings hands But instead of granting him that Request she order'd him to retire a dozen Leagues from  Madrid  He was sensibly touch'd at this unexpected Severity and complained of it as of a sort of Banishment Nevertheless this did not hinder him from demanding by Letters as well to the Queen as the Council to take the publick Good into their Consideration and fill Father  Nitard  's places with persons that were capable  of discharging them well he represented to them that those Dignities ought to be taken from him since it was equally as important a matter to hinder him from coming back again into the Kingdom as it was necessary to make him leave it  He demanded also that they should take away the Place of President of  Castile  from the Bishop of  Placentia  since he was the man that issued out the Decree by Virtue of which  Malladas  was strangled and that the Marquess  d'Aytone  his capital Enemy should no longer have the Liberty of passing his Judgment in those Affairs that concerned him  The Queen was very much offended at the manner wherein the Prince wrote to her and yet more enraged at what had happened sent him a very unpallatable Message and order'd him forthwith to discharge his Guards as he had engag'd to do  He complained of this to the Cardinal of  Arragon  and the Nuncio giving them as well as the Queen to understand that he could not part with his Friends that accompanied him till such time as he was certainly informed that Father  Nitard  was out of the Kingdom because he had still reason to fear some Mischief from that Quarter  Hereupon the Council met and judged it convenient that the Cardinal should go to  Guadalajara  to engage the Prince to comply with the Queens desires he consented to it at last and dismist his Guards after the Cardinal had managed a sort of a Treaty between that Princess and  Don Juan  by which she confirmed him in the Government of the  Low Countries  and passed her word that the Father Confessor should quit his places that the President of  Castile  and the Marquess  d'Aytone  should not meddle with the Cognizance of those things wherein the Prince was concerned that as for himself he might settle wherever he thought convenient that they would take particular care to ease the People of their Grievances that no body should be admitted to any of the Military Orders of  Castile  who had not served ten years by Land or by Sea that the Pope should be the Depository of the Queens word for the security of the Prince There were many other Articles besides these but not of the same weight and consideration all tending either to the satisfaction of  Don Juan  or the ease of the People  He forbore making his usual Remonstrances till the Month of  May  at which time he received information that the Queen was setting on foot a Regiment of Guards for the Kings Service whereof she had made the Marques  d'Aytone  Collonel  He wrote very sharply to her about this matter and represented to her that it was against the Custom of the Kings of  Spain  to have any other Guards but the Inhabitants of  Madrid  that this Regiment would be an everlasting Reproach to the City and would occasion abundance of ill Effects which he there enumerated at length It is worth the observing and I could not forbear to take notice of it that in this same Letter he complained that the Queen did not answer him with her own Hand but used that of the Cardinal of  Arragon  under pretence that she was troubled with a Megrim telling her in plain downright Terms  that a man of his Rank and Quality was not able to bear such a Contempt  The World may learn from this remarkable Passage on what Grounds the natural Sons of the Kings of  Spain  pretend to stand  All the Courts of Judicature as well the Chief as the Subaltern the Body of the City and the People made several Remonstrances to the Queen to hinder the setting up this Regiment in  Madrid  but to no purpose In fine they importuned her so often upon this Score that she signed an Order by which she prohibited them to speak to her any more about it and so without any more Delay she compleated the Regiment  She afterwards commanded  Don Juan  under very rigorous Penalties to remove from  Guadalajara  He obeyed her Orders with a great deal of Respect altho he was in a Condition by the Help of his Friends that were come to him from  Arragon  and other places to do what he pleased the Report ran that he was coming within a little Distance of  Madrid  and this gave several Persons abundance of uneasie Thoughts  To pacifie their Spirits the Queen wrote to him and desired him to repair to  Arragon  in the Quality of Viceroy and VicarGeneral of the Kingdom dependant upon it  This Order affected him with a very sensible Joy and he took care to testifie it by the Thanks he returned the Queen to whom he writ a very large Letter desiring her Majesty to consider seriously of the Education of the young King In it he represented to her the great Consequences of it as being a Man that was Master of a great deal of Wit and Honour He wrote likewise to the Pope on the  th  of  June  to conjure him to oblige Father  Nitard  to quit his Offices  In the mean time some of the Queens Enemies set about a sham Decree wherein she gave Orders to the Council to disarm the People immediately and return their Arms into the Common Hall It was an easie matter to perswade the World that this was her real Intention and  indeed this pretended Innovation so far estranged the Peoples Hearts from her Majesty that they were just upon the point of making an insurrection  This reason joyned with the horrible Disorders that were committed by the Regiment of the  Scambergues  for so the People nicknamed them because they were clad  a la Francoise  and the  Spaniards  copied this Mode from M  de Schomberg  this reason I say obliged the Council Ròyal to present another Remonstrance to the Queen wherein they desired her to send these new Soldiers to the Frontiers but she did not think fit to comply with their Requests because she imagined this Body of Military Men would keep the City in Awe and Subjection  Don Juan  was now at  Saragossa  beloved by the Nobility and adored by the People The Queen could never forgive him the irreparable Injury he did her in forcing her to part with her Confessor who made but a sorry Figure at  Rome  so that by way of Raillery it was frequently said  That the Queen of  Spain  had so invincible an Aversion to the  Spaniards  that she would never consent to the Ruine of Father  Nitard  till he was naturalized a  Spaniard  But however she still preserved so great an Esteem and Affection for him that she employed her utmost Endeavours to procure him a Cardinals Cap For this reason he gave secret Orders to the Màrquess  de S Romain  her Ambassador ordinary at  Rome  This soon came to be known at  Madrid  and the News alarm'd the People exceedingly every one apprehending that if ever the Father Confessor was made Cardinal he would certainly by those Steps come back to  Spain  and they were all perswaded that the Queen maintained the Regiment of the  Schombergs  for no other end but only to favour this Design  The Council being really afraid lest the Intrigue should succeed bethought themselves of some means to defeat Father  Nitard  in his Pretensions and for that purpose they dispatched a Courier to the Marquess  de S Romain  to propose to the Pope some other Subjects of  Spain  who better deserved the Purple The Queen made as if she consented to the Business but under hand renewed her Orders But the Ambassador who was no Friend at all to the Jesuits managed his Affairs so prudently that his Holiness rejected Father  Nitard  and besides obliged him to resign his other Places  The General of his Order whom he had formerly neglected and who for that reason owed him a great deal of ill will thought he had now an opportunity in the reverse of the Fathers fortune to pay the debt so he sent him immediately to one of their Houses near  Rome  He retired thither with a Spirit of Moderation that was very exemplary and of all his Train he kept no one with him but Friar  Bustos  his Companion Behold here a continued Series of Thunder Claps one upon the Neck of another This harsh Usage appeared so terrible to the poor Queen who did not in the least question the Success of her Negotiation that she fell sick of a Tertian Ague which continued a long time upon her  'Tis easie to believe by what I have already related that her Resentments became more violent than ever against  Don Juan  from her natural Disposition she was inclined to make him responsible for every thing that gave her any Disquiet and when she saw at the same time the Bulls for the Charge of Inquisitor General arrived at  Madrid  she did not doubt but it was all of the Prince's doing In fine that place  whieh she had seen so deservedly filled by Father  Nitard  was possess'd by  Don Antonio Balladores  President of  Castile  and Father  Nitard  for his part continued still near  Rome  but subject to all the ill Treatment with which the General of his Order thought fit to mortifie him  The Queen was not able to endure that a Man who had formerly enjoyed so great a share in her Friendship and Confidence and who had governed the whole Monarchy of  Spain  so absolutely should continue exposed to all the Resentments and Caprices of his General therefore she employed all the Credit she had at  Rome  to place Father  Nitard  in another Condition  Clement  IX dying in the Month of  December  Cardinal  Altieri  was chosen Pope and took upon him the name of  Clement  X The Queen who did not doubt but that this Pope would bestow a Cap upon her Confessor named the Father to be Embassador extraordinary of  Spain  at his Holiness's Court an Employment which she had formerly offer'd him when he departed from  Madrid  and which he was not then willing to accept of she procured leave for him to return to  Rome  and in fine managed this Affair with his Holiness so successfully that Father  Nitard  was created Archbishop of  Edessa  She continued to solicit his Promotion with a great deal of Vigour and Application The Pope being thus importuned made him Cardinal  Priest  in the Month of  April  and gave him in the Month of  August  following the Title of St  Bartholomew d'Isola  and gave him a place in the four Congregations  This News filled the Queen with a very sensible Joy and all those Persons who were of her party did not fail to compliment her upon this Occasion The new Cardinal writ a very obbliging  Letter to  Don Juan  in hopes that this civility would draw another from the Prince and that finding by this Correspondence a means to reconcile himself to him he would at last consent to his Return into  Spain  But he was mightily mistaken in his Project for  Don Juan  sent him no Answer back again Cardinal  Nitard  seeing that the Prince still continued his A version to him laid aside all Hopes of going to  Madrid  till the time of the King's Coronation  But since what I have written concerning Cardinal  Nitard  has insensibly led me to the time of  Don Fernand de Valenzuela  I think my self obliged to speak of him  He was originally of the City  de Ronda  in the Kingdom of  Granada  and was supposed to be an  Hidalgo  that is to say a Gentleman and not a  Cavallero  For they make this Difference in  Spain  between a Cavalier and a Gentleman that the former is descended of an ancient Family or at least allied to some illustrious House and pays neither Taxes nor Tribute whereas the latter is exempt from nothing tho he perhaps has acquired the Quality of a Gentleman  Valenzuela  came very young to  Madrid  where the Duke  de l'Infantado  took him for his Page when he went Ambassador to  Rome  He was handsom and wellshaped of an agreeable Meen had a great deal of Wit loved his Studies and was naturally a Poet The Character of his Verse was tender and passionate there are several pieces of his to be seen that are composed after Fashion and among the rest some Comedies which he caused to be represented for the Diversion of the QueenMother at the time when he first began to have the Honour of being in her good Graces  The Duke  de l'Infantado  being returned cut  of  Italy  made  Don Fernand  Knight of St  Jago  'Tis by this means ordinarily that great Persons begin to recompense those of their Domesticks for whom they have the greatest Consideration But he received nothing else but this bare Title for the many years Service he had waited upon his Master because it so happened that the Duke died before he did any farther kindness for him  He found himself therefore all at a Blow destitute of a Protector and so miserably poor that he was obliged to become  Passeante en Corte  which is as much as to say a man that lives by his Wits To say the truth he was Master of very happy Talents which put him in a Condition to accomplish every thing he undertook so that after he had seriously examined with himself the meanness of his Fortune he imagined the best Conduct he could use to advance it was to make himself acquainted and known to some persons that were particularly devoted to the Interests of the Queen He search'd out means to effect this Design with so continued an Application that at last he found access to Father  Nitard  he chose him immediately for his Patron and indeed could not have pitch'd upon a better and soon insinuated himself into his favour by his exemplary Submission and Diligence The Father taking notice that he wanted neither Address nor Wit and besides that he was capable of keeping a Secret communicated to him some of his own and afterwards entrusted him with those of the Queen acquainting him with the Resentments she had entertained against  Don Juan  of  Austria  He knew very well what Advantages to make both of the Discovery that was made him and of the favourable Disposition of the Father Confessor and rendred himself so necessary to him  that he could not almost be a Moment without him This obliged himto give him Admission into the Palace whether he often came to give him an account of the several things he had intrusted him with  As soon as ever  Valenzuela  was introduced into the Palace he lost no time there but improved all his favourable Moments to the best Advantages he plaid very well at Cards and being informed that amongst the other Women that waited upon the Queen there was a  German  Lady whose name was  Donna Eugenia  in whom her Mistress intirely confided he presently resolved to use all means to see her He walked often under her Chamber window and being an handsom agreeable young Fellow she for her part failed not to take due Notice of him  In short they spoke to one another he pleased her at least as well as she pleased him she gave him leave to  Galantear  her for that is the fashionable Word with them there when any Person devotes himself to the Service of any of the CourtLadies And 'tis a thing so common among them that altho a Man is married yet he does not forbear to treat his Mistress in publick with all those Ceremonies that are usually paid to the Lady whom they design to marry  Donna Eugenia  did not receive the Testimonies that young  Valenzuela  gave her of his Passion with the least coldness or indifference and he pursued the point so vigorously and press'd her so earnestly to consent to marry him that she discoursed the Queen about it  Her Majesty had already taken Notice of him and he had the good Fortune not to displease her so that to tye him the faster to her Interests she consented to let him marry her Favourite and afterwards bestowed a Gentleman Querry's place  upon the new Bridegroom About this time the Differences between the Queen and  Don Juan  daily increased and as  Don Fernand  was a Man of Address enough to sound the Bottom of any Intrigue so he did not omit to do the Queen all the useful Services that lay in his Power She beheld his Zeal with a great deal of Pleasure and took him so far into her Consideration that she daily gave him some fresh Assurances of her Confidence  Father  Nitard  placed all this to his own Account and voluntarily contributed to  Valenzuela  's Advancement because he looked upon him as his own Creature But tho Fortune now began to desert and leave him yet she absolutely declared her self in Favour of  Valenzuela  about the time when  Don Juan  returned from  Arragon  to  Castile  and caused the Father Confessor to be turned out of  Spain  Valenzuela  continued the Queen's sole Favourite without any Spy upon him for the Prince returned back to  Saragossa  in Quality of VicarGeneral of the Kingdom of  Arragon  The Queen was so extremely perplexed and mortified by the Removal of Father  Nitard  and her Enemies knew so well to make their Advantages of it that it was some time before she could tolerably recover herself from the Impression that so rude a Shock had made upon her but having considered the necessity she lay under to have a faithful Person near her whom she might entrust with her most secret Affairs she cast her Eyes upon  Valenzuela  who for his part still continued very much amaz'd at the Misfortunes of Father  Nitard  One day the Queen spoke to  Donna Eugenia  to bring her Husband with her privately towards the Evening because she had a mind to discourse  with him alone  Donna Eugenia  who wanted neither Wit nor Ambition was transported with Joy to think that  Valenzuela  was going to have such particular Conversations with the Queen and exactly obeyed the Orders she had received  The first time he entred into the Queen's Chamber he was very cautious and fearful for he came armed with a  Broquel  which is a sort of a Buckler that they generally carry with them in  Spain  when they go to a place where they apprehend any Danger His Hair that was very fine and delicate he had tyed up in a Ribbon knot he had not his  Golilia  on for 'tis the fashion there to leave them off at night in short he forgot nothing that might render himself charming and agreeable to the Queen She appeared in a  deshabille  that sat much better upon her than the Widows Habit she wore in the day time which very much resembles that of a religious Woman  Velanzuela  threw himself immediately at her feet and after he had returned her his most humble Thanks for the great Honour she was now pleased to do him he assured her that his Blood his Life in a word every thing that lay in his Power was so intirely resigned to her Service that he had the Presumption to believe none of all her Subjects was devoted to her Majesty after so particular a manner as himself The Queen gave credit to his words and after this meeting scarce a night pass'd over his Head but she caused him to come privately to her Apartment  His Wife always conducted him thither and the Queen ordered her to be present all the while to take away all Suspition and Umbrage Hereit was that he gave her a particular Account of every thing he knew and informed her of  all the most secret Intrigues that were carried on in Court or City of the Designs of  Don Juan  of those Lords that were of the Prince's Faction of the Measures that were taken against her so that she knew all the most private Affairs altho to appearance she spoke with no body It was commonly said at Court that there was a  Duende  in the Palace that is to say a familiar Spirit that acquainted the Queen with all the News and and secret Designs But some time after when it came to be publickly known that  Valenzuela  was this  Esprit folet  this familiar Spirit he was usually called  el Duende de la Reina  The Affection she had for him encreased to such a Degree that all the World knew it and the Courtiers all endeavoured to please the new Favourite No Favours were to be obtained but through his Intercession and the Credit of the other Ministers sunk solow that they stood only for Ciphers So they began to murmur amongst themselves  To what purpose was it  said they  to remove Father  Nitard  and send him away since a new Favourite is started up that succeeds him in his Place and acts with more Authority than the other ever did  This good Fortune of  Valenzuela  occasioned him a thousand Enemies they spoke of the Queen with all the Freedom and Liberty imaginable both Grandees and People made no Scruple of saying in publick that a young ignorant Favourite without Fortune or Merit governed all  Spain  and that it was a Shame to endure it The Queen being informed of what was said resolved to advance  Valenzuela  's fortune without delay to the end that he might feel the good Effects of her Protection before they were able to hurt him Upon this Consideration she gave him the charge of Master of the Horse without having any  regard to the Custom by which she was obliged to concert it with her Ministers as is the way in  Spain  when they are going to dispose of any considerable Post because she apprehended they would have opposed her Designs so that without entring into any matter of Consultation that is the usual Term in  Spain  she ordered his Commission to be dispatched  The Marquess  de CastelRodrigo  who was at that time Master of the Horse opposed it with all his Power and peremptorily refused to give him Admission into that Place alledging abundance of very disobliging Reasons against the Pretensions of  Don Fernand  and particularly that he had no Title to make him hope so great an Honour The Queen removed that Difficulty very easily for she created him Marquess  de Sanbortolome de los Pinares  When the World observed so advantageous an Alteration in the Fortune of  Valenzuela  no body questioned but that he was a  Valido  that is to say a Favourite The Report immediately spread it self through all  Spain  attended with some Circumstances that deeply concerned her Majesty's Reputation but she made no Account of them whether it were because she thought those Persons not worth her Consideration that had the Boldness to talk so freely of her or because she had some particular Reasons to herself not to alter this Conduct  Some time after the Marquess  de CastelRodrigo  Master of the Horse happened to die and the Queen bestow'd his Charge upon  Valenzuela  if the Grandees formerly murmured when he was advanced to a less considerable Post 'tis an easie matter to imagine the Excess of their Dissatisfaction and Jealousie when they beheld him settled in a place which all of them  could have wished to have enjoyed and of which they believed themselves to be infinitely more deserving But they ceased to make any farther Clamours about this Business when they found they had a Subject to talk of that was a great deal more surprizing Her Majesty made  Valenzuela  a Grandee of  Spain  of the first Class with a double gold Key At this piece of news all people looked upon one another and continued mute for some time not being able to express the Astonishment they were in The Lords as they met one another said nothing else but  Valenzuela made a Grandee O tempora O mores  In fine the Queen declared him her sole Favourite so that he issued out all Orders for her as chief Minister or to speak more properly as an absolute Master No Body was surprized at this new Honour that arrived to him for they made no Question but that after such strange unaccountable Beginnings he was marked out and designed for the Ministry  Being elevated to so eminent a post he wanted nothing but some Friends to help and support him if it ever should be his ill Fortune to make a wrong Step And it was no difficult Matter for him to effect it in so advantageous a Situation where all Favours all the Mony all the Offices and Benefices were at his intire Disposal But as soon as ever he procured a Favour for any single Grandee he at the same Moment disobliged above twenty more who from that time dated themselves his mortal Enemies and heartily wished his Ruin because he did not prefer them So that he was often heard to complain and regret his Fate for that he could not satisfie all the World And as the Number of his Friends was infinitely inferiour to that of his Enemies so the latter began to  cabal against him and think of some way or other to oblige  Don Juan  of  Austria  to return out of an Expectation that he was the fittest person to remove this universal Grievance this new Creature  Valenzuela  This Cabal of Malecontents increased so mightily that there was almost nothing to be seen but Pasquils Lampoons and Satyrs both in Prose and Verse against the Queen and against him Nay they had the boldness to give out that he hindered her Majesty from recompencing the Services of several Persons who otherwise might have expected considerable Employments In short their insolence proceeded so far that one Night very near the Palace they hung up the Portraiture of the Queen with  Valenzuela  He had at his feet all the Marks that represented his several places a Sword for Constable an Anchor for Admiral a Golden Key for Gentleman of the Bed Chamber a Collar of the Fleece for Knight of that Order and so of the rest He pointed at all these things with his hand and below was written  Este se Vende  that is to say all this is sold And the Queen leaning her Hand upon his Heart with this Inscription  Yeste se da  that is to say and this is given The Report ran very strong that he sold all Offices and Dignities at high Rates at which some Persons of the highest Quality were extremely offended and his Avarice drew upon him abundance of Enemies  But what is still the most remarkable is this that all these various Reports made not the least Impression on the Queen She said  That her rank placed her above these little Contumelies and that she should be angry with her self if she were capable of being disquieted at such miserable Reproaches that were so infinitely  below her indignation that the most effectual way to punish and extinguish these licentious Abuses was to take no notice of them that the reason why they were so inveterate against the Marquess  de Valenzuela  proceeded only from their Envie that she was resolved not to abandon and sacrifice one of the best Subjects that the King her Son had to gratifie the insatiable Humour of some Malecontents that were never to be satisfied  So that now it was apparent that all the Methods they took to destroy this Favourite served only to confirm him so much the deeper in the Affections and good Graces of the Queen  Nevertheless he used all possible Means to procure the good Will of the People he took care that  Madrid  should be always plentifully supplied with Provisions necessary for Life and that all sorts of Commodities should be sold at cheap easie Rates He often entertained the City with BullFeasts where he generally made his Appearance in a black Habit embroidered over with Silver and wore black and white Plumes as being in second Mourning because the Queen was a Widow But as soon as ever he entred the Lists and according to the Custom of those that design to combat the Bulls came under the Queen's Balcony making her a profound Reverence and demanding Permission  de Taurear  as they call it there she sent a Messenger to forbid him to expose himself 'Twas observable in one of these Courses that he wore a Scarf of black Taffata embroidered o're with Gold with the Device of an Eagle gazing stedfastly upon the Sun and for the Motto these words▪  Tengo solo Licentia  that is to say  is only permitted to me  Some days after he  eared at the running at the Ring having an Ea  painted up  on his Buckler for they always wear them at this sort of Course which is an ancient Diversion of the  Moors  armed with  Jupiter  's Thunder bearing the same Motto  It is only permitted to me  There being no hazard to run in this Sport the Queen was willing that  Valenzuela  should shew his Dexterity which he did and carried away the Prize from a great number of young Lords that disputed it with him and received from the Queen's hand a Sword beset with Diamonds They talked hotly at Court of the two Devices of the Favourite and every one was ready to explain them according to his own Fancy and Inclination He caused some Comedies of his composing to be publickly represented on the Theatre and all the Town had the liberty of seeing them for nothing This was the most taking way in the World to gain the hearts of the  Spaniards  for they are such passionate Admirers of all publick Shows that they will lay up the Mony which ought to be spent in maintaining their poor Families to purchase a dear Seat at a Bullfeast  Valenzuela  was not satisfied to cultivate the Affections of the people by these magnificences but sought other ways to win their hearts He set several noble Buildings on foot rebuilt the great Square the better part of which had been consumed by Fire and particularly the House where their Majesties went to behold the Courses at the Bullfeasts and running at the Ring He caused a Bridge to be built at the gate near  Toledo  over the  Mancanares  that cost a million of Ducats and another Bridge over the same River at  Pardo  which is a house of pleasure belonging to the King The Frontispiece and place before the Palace was finished by his order as also the Tower of the Queen's Apartment was raised much higher  He employed all his Thoughts in contributing to the diversion of the Queen and the King her Son this young Prince now began to go to all the meetings of Sport and Pleasure that were kept at  Aranjues  the  Escurial  and the other Royal Houses One day when the Marquess  de Valenzuela  had received Orders of the King to prepare a Chase for him and the Court was then at the  Escurial  the King designing to shoot a Stag shot his Favourite and wounded him on the Thigh the Queen being terribly affrighted broke out into great Lamentations and fainted away between the Arms of her Ladies This accident occasioned some People to predict the approaching Ruin of  Valenzuela  whereof this odd Adventure seemed to be a Presage  The time being now come to order the King's Houshold the Marquess made choice of all the Officers he made the Duke  d'Albuquerque  Mayor  Dome  Mayor the Admiral of  Castile    Cavallerizo  Mayor and the Duke  de Medinacelli Sumiller de Corps  this Officer is the same in Effect with High Chamberlain and puts on the Kings Shirt The name is originally French and comes from the Dukes of  Burgundy  from whom the House of  Austria  is descended After the same manner he disposed of the other places  Now as there were abundantly more Pretenders than places to fill he drew upon him by this means a considerable number of Enemies who could not digest the Affront of having nothing given them and were less inclined to Pardon him for that which directly concerned themselves than for what related to the Interest of State At this time they thought more earnestly than ever of  Don Juan  hoping that he would come to revenge their Quarrel upon  Valenzuela  and besides they laboured under hand to convince the  King how necessary it was for the better Management of Affairs to have the Prince about him  The Queen being informed of what was designed against her passed many sorrowful Days and more melancholy Nights altho she had almost continual Conference with the Marquess but she could never represent to her mind the killing thought that they would treat the Marquess after the same cruel manner as they had used Father  Nitard  but she fell a weeping and discovered all the Signs of a real Concern She knew very well that the Grandees frequently assembled together and that they spoke of the Government with all the freedom imaginable that the Libels and Pasquils that were insolently scattered abroad all tended to Defame her Administration were publickly owned and acknowledged by the Authors themselves and that she was obliged to seem as if she knew nothing of those matters because she was not in a Capacity to punish them  Valenzuela  for his part was not without his uneasie Moments the Elevation of his Fortune only served to make him sensible of the terrible Precipice he was falling down from which he did not perceive any visible means to secure himself  In the mean time  Don Juan  who continued still at  Saragossa  was discontented at his Banishment how honourable soever it appeared it is sufficient that it was not voluntary and that was enough to make him disrelish it The Queen and he had still the same natural Aversion to one another as formerly and notwithstanding the fair Appearances of his outward Behaviour he laboured underhand with his Friends to get himself declared Infant  de Castile  At least people report it of him 'tis indeed very true that he was never able to accomplish that Design but  they pretend that he was not absolutely without hopes to effect it  However it was he made so great a Faction by the means of some considerable persons about the King who were for promoting his Return that his Friends sent him word that the King desired it that every thing was disposed and ready to receive him and that the credit of the Queen would never be able to stand in Competition against his  This good news obliged him to quit  Arragon  and make all the haste he could to arrive at  Buenretiro    To bring about this Affair with more Facility they gave the King to understand  That he was not only under the Tutorage of the Queen his Mother but under that of  Valenzuela  They afterwards represented to him the Constraint he lived under in such lively Colours that he protested he would free himself immediately from this Servitude  And altho the Queen had always her Eye upon him for fear he should be seduced by any ill Counsels and take contrary measures to what she prescribed him yet he found the opportunity one night to steal out of the Palace with only one Gentleman of his Bedchamber who lay in his Room and so muffled up in his Cloak he walk'd on foot to  Retiro  which was far enough off From thence he dispatch'd an Order immediately to the Queen not to stir out of the Palace  It is easie to imagine what Entertainment such mortifying news found with her and what Effects this sudden reverse of Fortune caused in a Princess who had been accustomed to govern  She employed the remainder of the night in writing to the King conjuring him in the most  tender Terms to give her leave to visit him but he still refused it  While the King tarried at  Retiro  the people being informed of his Intentions flock'd in Multitudes to salute and acknowledge him All the Lords of the Court made him very considerable Presents so that some Persons valued them at a hundred thousand Crowns either in Mony Plate Tapistry or Diamonds There was an universal Joy at  Madrid  upon this occasion and that for these two reasons which equally caused it The first is the exceeding Affection the  Spaniards  have for their Prince the second because the Queen was so ill beloved and besides the People could never forget some words that drop'd from her once viz  That she should never be at rest till she had brought them all to be cloathed with Estera    This is a sort of a course Matt made of Rushes that serves them for Mattresses and their Bedding  The next night after the King's Retreat they made Illuminations in all the Streets  As soon as  Don Juan  arrived he obliged the King to remove the Queen from thence so she was sent to  Toledo  with positive orders not to stir out of that City The unfortunate  Valenzuela  took his Leave of her with all the Testimonies of Grief and Duty that so short a time would allow him and retired to the  Escurial  according to order  Thus there being a new face of Affairs every body made his Court and Application to  Don Juan  and the King by his extraordinary Caresses sufficiently testified how joyful he was to see him again He commanded him to take care of all his Affairs and indeed  Don Juan  rendred himself so absolute a Master that his Authority became much greater than that of the Queen and her two chief Ministers  Don Juan  earnestly desired to have  Valenzuela  's person in his Power but could not tell whither he was gone At last being informed that he was to be found at the  Escurial  he shewed a great deal of Joy at the news This is one of the King's Houses and is of so prodigious an extent that if we take in the Buildings the Park and a Convent of Religious  Jeronomits  which is contained within the Precincts of it 'tis thought it is several Leagues in compass and is all inclosed with Walls  The King commanded  Don Antonio de Toledo  Son to the Duke of  Alva  to go thither in person and arrest  Valenzuela  he departed immediately with the Duke  De Medina Sidonia  and the Marquess  de Valpa rayso    Don Fernand de Toledo  several persons of great quality and two hundred Horse The Marquess was then walking in an adjoyning Forrest full of Heaviness and Melancholy but hearing on a sudden a great noise about him and being informed at the same time of what had happened by a certain Messenger whom some of his Friends had sent in all speed to acquaint him with the News he returned hastily to the  Fscurial  and finding out the Prior of the Convent of the  Jeronomites  who was a very honest man and particularly concerned at the misfortunes of this Favourite he told him in a few words what danger he was in and what reasons he had to apprehend the loss of his Life in case he was taken praying and conjuring him with all imaginable earnestness to conceal him in some place of Safety  The Prior immediately ordered a Hole to be contrived in a Cell belonging to one of the Re+ligious of whose Confidence he was well assu+red This Cell it seems was all over Wainscoted so that taking down one of the Pannels of the  Wainscot and making a Cavity in the Wall which was of a considerable Thickness in manner of a Nitch they threw in a few Mats and there the poor Marquess was shut up  It being very well known that the Marquess was retired into the Convent there was no place or corner left unsearch'd by  Don Antonio de Toledo  and those that accompanied him They had so small a respect to the most holy places that they almost turned every thing in the Church upside down  But their Search was to no purpose and  Don Antonio  could not tell what to resolve upon He had been upon the hunt there several days to find out  Valenzuela  who as he now began to imagine had certainly found the means to save himself When the unhappy Marquess being almost stifled in the Hole for want of Air and besides disordered with his late Afflictions fell so dangerously ill that there were little hopes of his Life Finding himself therefore in this desparate Condition he cared not what became of him But the Father Prior having first taken the Chirurgion of the Convent's word to keep the secret inviolably sent him to the Marquess to let him Blood This treacherous Villain within a quarter of an hour after discovered the whole Mystery to  Don Antonio  who had been it seems in the Cell where poor  Valenzuela  lay immured almost every day since he began to make the Search after him He then immediately entred the Convent and all on the sudden commanded the Pannel which covered the Marquess to be taken down He found him fast asleep But very much altered by his Indisposition and Misfortunes his Arms lay ready by him and if he had been awake there is no question to be made but that he had resolutely defended  himself being a person of great Courage and Bravery And besides what would not a man attempt in so deplorable a Condition  He was conducted to the Castle  de Consuegra  which belongs to the Grand Priory of  Castile  of the order of  Malta Don Juan  chose to make this the Scene of his Confinement because the Castle depended upon him  Valenzuela  lay there dangerously sick and often said in the hearing of his Guards  Oh Heavens and there is no hope then that I shall die immediately must I still live after I have endured so many Afflictions  When he was somewhat better he was removed to the Castle  de los Puntales  at  Cadiz  where he suffered a very close Imprisonment nevertheless he shewed a great deal of Constancy and Resolution in the midst of all his ill Usage and Disgraces  At last he was imbarked in a Vessel to be sent to  Chile  in the  Philippines  These are certain Islands in the extreamest Part of the  EastIndies  almost adjoyning to  China  'Tis a lonḡ and tedious Voyage thither and they generally transport their most notorious Criminals in  Spain  to those Places where they are forced to work in the Quicksilver mines They seldom tarry above two years in that slavish Employment but they die or at least are troubled with a general trembling in their Limbs which makes them suffer infinitely more than Death it self  Valenzuela  was informed before his Departure that he was degraded from all his Honours and that the King had taken away all his Offices leaving only his bare name to him  I perceive then  says he very pensively  that I am under more unfortunate Circumstances by far than when I first came to Court and the Duke  de l'Infantado  took me for his Page  But tho they took care to acquaint him with what related particularly to himself yet he could learn nothing of the Queen's Destiny or what became of his Wife and Children They had shut up her Majesty together with them in a Convent at  Talavera de la Reine  and strictly commanded the Abbess not to let them stir abroad or speak to any body  'Tis commonly reported that at the time when he was at the Port of  Cales  ready to embarque a woman of an extraordinary size handsomly dress'd and covered with her Veil as it is the Spanish Fashion bustled through the Guards close up to him  Take courage  Valenzuela says she to him  thy Enemy will die and thou shalt once more see  Spain  Those that heard her say so would have stop'd her but she found out means to make her Escape What she told him afterwards proved in Effect to be true for  Don Juan  died and one of the first Graces that the QueenMother begged of the King at her Return to  Madrid  was to have  Valenzuela  recalled home So a Vessel was sent to the  Philippines  to bring him back but he found to his sorrow that  d'Eguya  hindered his return altho the Queen so earnestly desired it  The Pope having received Information of what had passed as well in the Church as in the Convent when they dragged  Valenzuela  by force out of the  Escurial  excommunicated all those that were concerned in the Fact so that before the Lords could prevail to have the Ecclesiastical Censure taken off which by this Violation of the Churches Liberty they had incurred they were obliged in white Sheets and Halters about their Necks to walk to the Imperial Colledge where Cardinal  Mellini  who  was then Nuncio at  Madrid  made each of them undergo some Blows of Discipline  All the Kingdom testified an extraordinary Satisfaction to see  Don Juan  enter upon the Government and we may safely say that all the Hopes and Expectations of  Spain  were lodged in him  As he was Master of a great deal of Wit and Vivacity so it was natural to believe that the different Employments of his Life whether in Peace or War rendred him extreamly capable of repairing the Breaches and reforming all the Irregularities of the State Several of the Grandees had entred into a sort of an Association for his Return and now they had leisure to make severe Reflections upon the weakness of the late Government where they found nothing but private Intreagues and little Factions that were extremely disadvantageous to the Publick Interest  A German Queen an Infant King a Foreigner Chief Minister of State and Confessor  Valenzuela  made a Favourite and Minister without Birth and without Capacity raised upon the sudden by a strange Caprice of Fortune and thrown down again into his primitive Nothing In fine all their hopes centred in  Don Juan  and they had long expected him almost to a Degree of Impatience But when he was once arrived and they beheld him at a nearer View presently all those great and glorious Ideas which they had conceived of him vanished away like a Dream  This is commonly the Fate and Destiny of all great Ministers the high place they possess only serves to expose them the more to the Envy of their Inferiours Even those persons that took the greatest Pains to place them in that Condition think they have laboured all the while for  an ungrateful Wretch and if he fails to shower down all his Favours upon them will be sure to give him less quarter than any men else So small a distance there is from publick Favour and Admiration to publick Hatred This Rule which generally holds at all times and in all places did not fail to be accomplished in the person of  Don Juan  Most people were concerned to see what harsh Usage he gave the Queen and could not forbear to accuse his Obstinacy for refusing to enter  Madrid  till the Queen was gone out and on her way to  Toledo  He was not content with this Affront that he put upon her at his first Appearance but to humble her still the more he added another that was full as mortifying he descended into a severe Examination of her past Conduct the particulars of which had the least Relation to the present State of Affairs and only tended to defame her  This Princess suffered with an incredible Grief a Treatment so unbesitting her high Quality and so injurious to her Reputation but all other ways of shewing her Resentments were denied her and she had nothing left to exercise save only her Patience and Virtue  But several Persons of Quality that were still linked to her whether out of Affection or Duty could not without a sensible Affliction behold the Oppression she lay under They generally spoke of it with Heat and Indignation and spread abroad a Report that altho  Don Juan  was no legitimate Prince yet he flattered himself that he should one day become absolute Master of the Monarchy  Abundance of people maintained the contrary alledging that he was never guilty of such a  Design and that if he had been capable of harbouring any such thoughts he might easily have succeeded in them by the assistance of his own Party which was very numerous and by his own Power that the King was but fifteen years old and besides was equally destitute of Authority and Experience  What occasion'd this Suspicion was his establishing of some Innovations that were never practised by any Minister before him One that made the greatest noise was this that in his Chamber of Audience he would never give the right Hand nor a Seat to the Ambassadors At first they shewed themselves extreamly disobliged at it but at last the Nuncio and the other foreign Ministers submitted to this Rule and visited him without Difficulty The Queen's Creatures made a greater bustle about this affair than even the Ambassadors themselves who were only concerned in it and whether they discoursed of it with too much freedom or  Don Juan  only suspected their private Sentiments he caused several of them to be banished Among the rest were the Admiral of  Castile  the Duke  de Ossone  the Prince  de Stillano  the Marquess  de Mansera  the Count  d'Humanez  the Count  d'Aquillar  and the Marquess  de Mondejar  The last of whom was accused for making the following Verses but they were mistaken in the Author for

they lie  Though too loudly they rail at the Plague of the Age  Their Zeal to thy Person excuses their Rage  And if they repine and are heard to complain  It proceeds from the Smart and Excess of their Pain  Don Juan  found these Verses upon his Toillette and in several other places of his Chamber he was more concerned at them than in reason he ought to be for certainly he could never be so vain as to imagine that he was equally acceptable to all the World These Resentments having sowred and exasperated his Spirit he observed that the Conversation of the Count  de Monterey  diverted the King this was enough to render him suspected and altho this Nobleman had set himself at the Head of a Party which declared for the Princes Return yet all his Services were forgot and the Prejudices of Jealousie which are sometimes too headstrong to be mastered made  Don Juan  send him to command in  Catalonia  He afterwards banished him and what is more ordered a Trial to be commenced against him about the affair of  Puicerda  Thus the unfortunate Count saw himself all in a Moment removed  from Court where he flattered himsel  long to continue in the King's and Princes fa+vour But that Monarch was young and desti+tute of Experience and besides laboured unde  the ill Effects of a bad Education for a Minister that regards nothing in the world but what has a particular relation to his own Interests will be sure to keep back those Lights from his Prince that may help him afterwards to discover by what an ill Conduct he is managed  Don Juan  was very well acquainted with the Policy of this Maxim and accordingly took care to conceal the affairs of State from the King with as much Precaution as the Priests keep their Mysteries from the People To make himself always necessary to him he never instructed him in the Art of governing but perpetually amused him with some little insignificant Diversions that possessed his tender years with a Spirit of Laziness which could never fail to produce ill Consequences afterwards and never gave him leave to stir a foot out of the Palace but in his own Company  The People that are never sensible of Events but at the very Moment when they feel the Smart had perhaps looked upon the Banishment of the Lords and the captivity of their King with an indifferent Eye if they had not been Sufferers themselves But the great Scarcity of Provisions that were daily inhanced the irregular Administration of Justice and the disorderly Management of the  Finances  made them soon sensible that the changing of Masters is not always for the better And as it is natural to run headlong from one extream into another and the just Limits of carrying on a Reformation are known but to a very few Peersons so they began to disrelish the Regency and to shew a Dissatisfaction  that might easily have been improv'd into an insurrection but that the anger of the People of  Spain  is generally week and feeble and 'tis not only upon these occasions that the apparent fierceness of that Nation goes off and vanishes For 'tis very true that the People content themselves there with railing and murmuring so that if there was any thing to be feared it was from the Grandees who nothwithstanding their banishment left very considerable Relations and Friends behind them at Court These being concerned to see them exiled began privately to join and associate for the same Cause they proceeded so far as to signifie to the Queen that they passionately desir'd her return and that she ought to attempt something on her side as they were resolv'd to do something on theirs and in short they took an occasion to discourse the King about the matter  They made him sensible that he was under a slavish ignominious dependance and confirmed him in his natural inclinations to take the Government of the State into his own hands  He relished very well the overtures they made him and the Queen likewise received her informations not without pleasure but it was not enough to wish well something of Action was necessary for the King was young wanted assistance and every one shifted it off from himself to another The pleasures of the Court and that laziness which is so peculiar to the  Spaniards  made them advance so slowly in their affairs that Don  Joan  had leisure enough to destroy in one day the Foundations they had been laying for several weeks The Queen for her part was under a consinement which held her chained to the place so that she could attempt nothing without being discovered She was affraid too of finding  Traitors among her own Servants and drawing new Disgraces upon her whilst she endeavoured to free her self from those she lay under at present What was past instructed her in some measure to fear and avoid what was to come  As she is naturally of a slow disposition so after long reflections upon the matter she was of the opinion that she ought not by any precipitate actions hazard the future repose of her life  Don Juan  on his side was alarm'd with continual fears and jealousies and having abundance of Spies about him he was instructed of what he did not care to hear the unwearied designs that were daily form'd against him Notwithstanding the great Authority and Power with which he was invested he could not for bear very sensibly to apprehend the bad consequences of an aversion that began to be entertained so generally against him  He was in a manner Responsible for all the good and all the bad successes of the State and the Weight of so cumbersom a Monarchy hung very heavy about him He sometimes considered with regret the Tranquility he had formerly enjoyed in  Flanders  and  Arragon  in fine his Spirit was not in its natural Sphere and we may say of him that he even over bought the pleasure of making so great a figure on the Theatre of the World  The War that was kindled between  France  and  Holland  interested several Princes of  Europe  who took their sides in it either according to their several Inclinations or else the particular engagements they had to the Powers that were then at variance  Spain  which is always inseparable from the interests of the Empire neither spared her Mony nor Forces upon  this occasion when the  Hollanders  made a peace with  France  first in the year The Emperor and some of the Princes of the Empire followed their Example nay  Spain  could not hinder it self from doing the like The King of  Denmark  and Elector of  Brandenburgh  who as yet kept their Swords in their hands still laid them down likewise and a Peace was concluded at  Nimeguen  that gave Repose to all  Europe  In the mean time the King of  Spain  was upon the point off marrying the ArchDutchess the Emperor's Daughter This Affair was so far advanced that the Articles were regulated and the Contract signed This Marriage was of the Queen's doing who earnestly desired the Accomplishment of it but  Don Juan  at his Return broke of this Match not being desirous to strengthen his Enemies Party as it must assuredly have been by the Accession of this young Princess who was of the same Name and same Country with the Queen and besides all this was her Grand Daughter and Neice He too much feared the ill Consequences of this Affair to give his consent to it  The King about his nineteenth year seemed to be settled in a healthful State of body which promised Successors to the Crown and he expressed a great Inclination to be married he considered that of the House of  Austria  he alone was left remaining of the Spanish Branch and that his whole Kingdom had an equal interest to see him have Children  The Circumstances of the Peace that hapned to be concluded at  Nimeguen  made him cast his Eyes upon Mademoiselle Eldest Daughter of Monsieur who was the Kings only Brother She was almost of his own age amiable wellshaped of a sweet Disposition witty and charming  All her inclinations were noble and vertuous and  Lewis  the Great took an extraordinary affection to her because her Humour so exactly suited with his so that all the Courtiers were surprized at it  The King had accidentally seen some Portraitures of this Princess and several Spanish Lords who had been at the Court of  France  spake of her as a Prodigy These advantagious Testimonies so luckily concurring sensibly affected him he could not take his rest a nights he carried her Picture next his Heart and held long Conversations with it as if it understood him But what is the most incredible thing of all and yet is related for a certain Truth is this that before he became enamoured he could not endure any Woman near him but these Dispositions were altered in him upon this occasion and he beheld the fair Sex never after with Aversion  All the People were ravished with Joy to hear that the King desired Mademoiselle The Memory of Queen  Elizabeth  of  France  the first Wife of  Philip  the IV was so deeply imprinted upon the Hearts of all the  Spaniards  that they desired to see one of the same blood sit upon the Throne again  Don Juan  agreed with the Kings inclinations as well as those of the People in Relation to this Princess He sent orders to the Marquess  de los Balbazez  in  Flanders  who was come from  Nimeguen  where he had assisted at the Treaty of Peace to go and demand Mademoiselle for the King his Master  Every one was surprized that the Prince lent his helping Hand to this Affair True Policy would have required him to protract as long as he was able and to delay the Marriage because  as it gave a Wife to the King so it might perhaps give an Enemy to the Favourite  And here many People could not forbear to call to mind the first Ideas of that Ambition of which he was suspected now it was for good and all to abandon the Design of making himself declared Infant to content himself with reigning after the King in case he had no Children Many Persons do likewise pretend that notwithstanding the great Earnestness he shewed in publick yet he had no over great Desire to have the Match succeed They alledge this for a Reason that he ought to have done something before so open an Embassy by way of secret Dispatches which might absolutely have had the Success of a Negotiation But that at the Bottom whatever he did or whatever he said to the contrary he did not heartily desire it that he was afraid lest a French Queen supported by the Authority of the greatest King in the World would never truckle to him that now he was Master but hereafter would become no more than a Companion Others were of the contrary opinion and said that he had a fair Prospect of being well received by Mademoiselle especially since he had broke off the Marriage with the Arch Dutchess and given the Preference to her These different Considerations embarrassed and perplexed  Don Juan  to such a Degree that he knew not which way to determine himself and even at the very time that the Marquess  de los Balbazez  demanded the Princess in  France  he very cunningly got the King at  Madrid  to see the Portraiture of the Infanta of  Portugal  who was a Lady of admirable Beauty He talked exceedingly of her Charms and not knowing as yet that her Marriage with the Duke of  Savoy  was agreed upon  he underhand made a Proposal to give her to the King but he was too deeply gone to alter his Affections  The Demand made by  Don Balbazez  was very agreeable to his most Christian Majesty and  Don Juan  who received Advice of it did not at first doubt of its Success Therefore he now endeavoured to overshoot the favourable Dispositions of  France  either to promote his own interest by it or else by demanding things that were too great to meet a Refusal and by that means to find a plausible Pretence to break off In effect he pretended that Mademoiselle not being the Daughter of a King they ought therefore for that reason on the side of the French Court to enter into particular Considerations and restore to  Spain  some of those Places that were yielded up to  France  by the last Treaty of  Nimeguen  Upon this he held a Council where he was desirous to insinuate his own Sentiments into them but he found no body inclined to hearken to them Every one concluded that they ought to have nothing else in view but the King's Satisfaction that they were happy enough in finding out a Princess that was beautiful and capable to give them a Soveraign and that they ought not to take pains to destroy a thing of that Consequence which all the World so earnestly desired to see accomplished  The Queen who continued still very solitary at  Toledo  and who was consulted in no affairs wrote a Letter to the King wherein she told him she had received Information that he was going to be married that she counselled him in the mean time while that Affair was carrying on to go to  Arragon  and  Catalonia  to confirm the ancient Privileges of those People The King sent  her barely word again that he would do it without explaining himself more openly upon his Marriage  Ever since the twenty fourth of  January  the King had nominated those Persons who were to fill up the respective Offices of the House of the new Queen The Dutchess  de Terra Nova  was made  Camarera Major  that is first Lady of Honour but her Power is of a greater Extent than that of the other Ladies of Honour because she is Mistress of all the Women that serve the Queen in her Palace She is the Widow of the Duke  de Terra Nova  who was of the House of  Pignatelli  and a Grandee of  Spain  She inherited a vast Fortune that descended to her from  Fernando Cortez  for her Mother bore the Name of that famous Captain who left her a small Kingdom in the  West Indies  tho he might if he pleased have left her a more considerable one in that Part of the World where he made so great a Progress  She is descended of a Branch of the House of  Arragon  that setled a long while ago in  Sicily  she is extreamly rich of a fierce imperious Humour towards Persons that are above her insupportable to her Equals but kind and obliging to her Inferiours She has a world of Wit is fixed in her Resolutions and is of a deep penetrating Spirit Her Temper cold and serious still preserving her Spanish Gravity and never steps a foot backward or forward unless she has well considered of it before She thunders out her  I will  or  I will not  enough to make one tremble  She is a meager pale Woman of a long and wrickled Visage her Eyes little and severe in short she makes a dangerous terrible Enemy  D  Ca  os  of  Arragon  her Cousin German was  the Banditti whom she caused expresly for that  to come from  Valentia    because he demanded of her Restitution of the Dutchy of  Terra Nova  which was in her Possession altho of right it belonged to him  The terrible Noise this Affair made in the World obliged her to retire into  Arragon  where  Don Juan  resided at that time deeply afflicted at his Misfortunes  Both of them imagined that they had reason to complain of the Severity of their Fortune and this soon occasioned a certain Friendship between them as it usually happens amongst Persons of their Quality when they come to be involved in the same Circumstances After they had frequently conversed with one another the Prince found out part of the Dutchesse's Humour he knew she was ambitious but as all the other ill qualities of her Soul were outwardly set off by the appearance of a great Devotion he never took her for so malicious and spightful a Devil as she really was He therefore cast his Eyes upon her to make her  Camarera Major  for the young Queen  The Marquess  d'Astorgas  was nominated at the same time to be Grand Master of her House  Don Juan  had some thoughts at first of conferring this Office upon  Don Vincente Gonzaga  of the House of  Mantua  and made him quit his Viceroyship of  Sicily  to come and possess it which the other freely left in Consideration of the Place that was now offered him But his Expectations were deceived for the Marquess  d'Astorgas  who had heaped up a prodigious Wealth when he was Viceroy or  Naples  having profered the use of it to  Don Juan  who mightily stood in need of Mony at that time and accepted the Profer was preferred to  Don Vincente  who was admitted however into the  Council of State where his great Abilities without Question did great Service  Altho the Duke  d'Ossone  continued as yet in exile  Don Juan  did not forget to nominate him for Master of the Horse to the Queen he bestowed that Place upon him only that he might have an opportunity to take away from him that of the President of the Orders where his Conduct it seems did not please him He affected a certain Air of Devotion that sat very disagreeably upon him because he mixed too much Bigotry with it and it was a strange sort of Bigotry too for this good Duke one evening caused the Count  d'Humanez  to be set upon in the Streets by some men of  Valencia  who never come to  Madrid  but to commit Murders and other Crimes of that nature The occasion of the Quarrel was this the Duke was passionately in Love with a certain Lady and soon after came to discover that the Count was a more fortunate man than himself Nevertheless the Count escaped the Danger This affair made a great Bustle  Don Juan  who was particularly disgusted at the Duke laid hold of this opportunity to banish him the Court but now procured this considerable post for him that he might gain over to his party a man of so great an importance besides it was his interest to see the Chief Offices of the Queen's House filled with those Persons that were at his Devotion and might prepossess the mind of that young Princess in favour of him The other Officers of her House were likewise nominated about the the beginning of  March  At the same time the Marquess  de Mansera    Major Domo  to the QueenMother was fined a hundred thousand Crowns which he paid upon the Nail After this manner the King sometimes  punishes the Crimes that the Grandees commit against him He was soon after banished to the Castle  de Cocchia  and his place was given to the Count  de Chinchon  But the Queen being highly incensed at these Proceedings declared that she would never suffer it alledging that the Widow of  Philip  the fourth and Mother of  Charles  the second ought not to be treated after this unworthy manner so they were forced to let the matter drop and proceed no farther in it  There happened a little after another business that occasioned a great Clamour  Don Francisco de Toledo  second Son of the Duke of  Alva  the Count  de Mirande  Grandee of  Spain  the Marquess  de Valero  Son of the Duke  de Bejar  and the eldest Son of the Duke  de Sessa  occasioned the Escape of a man that was accused of great Crimes The manner whereby they brought it about was this They sent a Woman with a Basket of Fish to stand near the Prison she sold such good Pennyworths there that a man appointed for the pupose having informed the Jaylor and the Keepers of it they presently ran to the place to by some Fish The Woman amused them with abundance of foolish Stories so well that she suceeded in her Design for in the mean time the abovementioned Lords broke open the Prison Gates  The King ordered all of them to be arrested however this Affair like others of the same nature at  Madrid  brought no ill Consequences upon them  The King took all the care imaginable to have the young Queens Apartments in the Palace fitted up and made ready He was to have gone according to the usual Custom in the Month of  April  to  Aranjues  but  Don Juan  hindred him because that place was too near  Tolcdo  so he went to  BuenRetiro  The QueenMother wrote to him thither desiring that he would be pleased to come and see her but tho she press'd it with a great deal of Tenderness and Importunity she was not able to succeed in her Desires  He diverted himself every day with hunting and seeing Comedies either at  Pardo  or  Zarzuela  which are two Houses of Pleasure belonging to the King of  Spain  The Opera  d'Alcine  was represented before him it cost a world of Mony but was miserably performed  There was likewise a Bullfeast kept where two young Cavaliers unfortunately perished On the following day there was running at the Ring  About this time the Prince  de Ligne  arrived and a day or two after kissed his Majesty's hand and took his Place at the Council of State Father  Francis de Relux  a Dominican came likewise from  Salamanca  where he had been Professor of Divinity and was chosen by  Don Juan  to be the Kings Confessor The Duke of  Alva  had engaged that he should submit himself intirely to  Don Juan  's Will who accepted him upon his Parole At this time the Cardinal  de Portacarero  Archbishop of  Toledo  returned from  Rome  The Court at  Madrid  was very full and numerous  On the twentieth of  January  the King o  France  named the Marquess  de Villars  to be hi  Ambassador in  Spain  who was at that tim  under the same Character at  Savoy  He wa  known to the Court of  Spain  for in the yea  he resided there in Quality of Ambassa+dor he arrived at  Madrid  on the seventeent  of  June  and those Persons that were well ac+quainted with the Disposition of  Don Juan  ve+ry much doubted whether he would meet with  that Reception which he might reasonably promise himself They knew well enough that the natural Haughtiness of  Don Juan  would never comply with the Instructions of that Minister who to be sure would never go to visit the Prince unless he were assured beforehand of receiving the honour of the Hand the Step and the Chair that  Don Juan  would never consent to this Proposal because it was not to be imagined that he would easily give up the rights he had obtained over the other Ambassadors and that it would be an inconvenient thing for him of  France  not to treat directly with the chief Minister What People surmised upon this occasion really happened for rhe Prince would not bate him an Ace and the Marquess  de Villars  kept fast to his Instructions Therefore they looked upon one another with great coldness but nevertheless this did not hinder the Ambassador from having a private Audience of the King on the eighth of  July  and a publick one a little after upon the conclusion of his Marriage with Mademoiselle  Don Juan  had three Fits of a Tertian Ague towards the beginning of  July  On the thirteenth the Secretary of the Marquess  de los Balbazez  arrived who brought word that the King had consented to the Marriage of Mademoiselle with the King of  Spain  Nothing is equal to the Joy that he shew'd upon this Account for he had expected the news with the greatest Impatience He ordered  Te Deum  to be sung at our Ladies  d'Atocha  all the Houses in the City were illuminated with white Wax Tapers and Bonefires were to be seen in every Street An hundred and fifty Cavaliers of the best Families in the Kingdom performed a Masquerate on horseback that consisted only of some Embroiderie  Tiffany Ribbons and Feathers for they were apparalled in black as they used to be but were not masqued at all After this manner they ran all night every man carrying a Flambeaux in his Hand All these Divertisements lasted three Days and three Nights A Courier arrived soon after who brought the Contract of the King's Marriage this was soon communicated to the QueenMother who express'd a great deal of Joy at it The Ratification was presently sent back and Bonefires were made as before  While the People did thus endeavour to express their Zeal to the King the Servants of the QueenMother were busied in finding out some means or other to advance her Return The Marquess  de Villars  had refused to follow the example of the other Ambassadors in the Conduct they used towards  Don Juan  upon the occasion of those new customs which they suffered him to establish and this seemed a favourable opportunity to perswade the Enemies of the Prince that Monsieur  de Villars  had some secret Instructions which were not favourable to him They flattered themselves immediately with the hopes of making him one of their party and believed it would extreamly strengthen their own side if they could once bring him over to them Upon this Consideration the greater Part of the Cortiers applauded him mightily for his Constauncy and made him abundance of Complements upon that Score He was respected at  Madrid  and had the good fortune to find out several of his Friends again and the QueenMother shewed a particular Esteem for him She gave him a very obliging proof of this when he came to wait upon her at  Toledo  for after publick Audience was over she was pleased to  entertain him in private about her own Affairs and testified what an entire Confidence she reposed in him But altho several Proposal were made to him to be of a Party against the Prince and besides his own natural Disposition led him to espouse the Quarrel of those Persons who opposed a Minister whose civilities he had no great reason to applaud yet he was of opinion that in this present Conjuncture it would be his best way to remain Neuter  He considered still that the Marriage of the King of  Spain  with Mademoiselle would bring along with it some Agreements that were not to be expected before the Arrival of that Princess that it was a sure unfailing way to oppose one Power to another that this young Princess would never suffer the Minister of  France  to be run down in that Court where she was to become the Mistress and sole Delight that it was certain she would link her self to the interests of the Queen Mother that the most Christian Queen who loved both the one and the other very affectionately would be sure to give her this in charge before her Departure amongst the other Counsels which she was always to observe that their Credit being united together and seconded by all those Persons that desired another Government  Don Juan  would without question find himself obliged to give way Most Persons reasoned after the same manner upon this Affair and encouraged one another to stand firm against the Favourite they now began to speak those Things aloud which before they were almost afraid to mutter in private they complained of him and importuned the King to call the Ex  es home and openly promoted the Return of the QueenMother  Don Juan  was now more  disquieted than ever The Appearance only of his fall had prevailed with several Persons who ought to have been his Creatures to abandon him for good and all and as for those that remained they had neither Authority nor Merit enough to support him He could scarce find any Comfort but when he was alone but this sort of Conduct does not always afford a man a Sanctuary for even the Silence the Retirement and the infinite Reflections we make are rather apt to perplex and disturb than to relieve our Spirits He was still more afflicted when he saw some of his Friends or at least such as he believed to be so embrace the interests that were directly opposite to his and he knew they employed the Confessor's credit with the King to bring all these matters about  I have already told you that  Don Juan  was the man who caused him to come from  Salamanca  and after he had advanced him to this Preferment thought he might ever after have him at his Devotion Nevertheless whether he had promised him nothing or really broke his word 'tis certain he quitted the Prince's party and caballed amongst his Enemies Some People pretend that this proceeded from a Principle of Conscience but it is impossible that ingratitude should ever flow from a good Principle However it was he obtained for the Princess  de Stillano  who was the Duke of  Alva  's Daughter the Return of her Husband  Don Juan  had absolutely refused it and found so little Credit upon this occasion that he was sensibly afflicted at it For the thing it seems was pushed so far that the King out of pure Complaisance to his Confessor said  it signifies nothing that  Don Juan  opposes it 'tis enough that I would  have it so  These few words very much increased the Prince's Melancholy but as Misfortunes seldom come unattended there happened another Mortification upon the Account of the Duke of  Ossone  who was in the number of the Exiles The Prince had sent him notice by some of his Friends that he desired him to throw up his Place of Master of the Horse to the new Queen which he had lately bestowed upon him but he rejected his Proposal with the greatest Scorn imaginable  Don Juan  was mightily enraged at it and would have banished him farther off to make him sensible of his Power and of the Affront he had done him in pretending to oppose his Intentions but he was so far from succeeding in his Project that he saw the Duke  de Medina Celi  who hitherto kept fair Measures with him had prevailed with the King to recall the Duke  d'Ossone  The Son of the Duke  de Medina Celi  had married the Daughter of the Duke  d'Ossone  and this occasioned the great Friendship between them The Pretence was that it was necessary for him to be with the Queen and the Duke  de Medina Celi  having found a favourable Opportunity told the King that he was not a little concerned to see a man of the Duke  d'Ossone  's Quality who had the honour to possess one of the highest Offices in the Queen's House banished so far from Court at a time when all those Persons that ought to serve her should be making Preparations to meet her The King consented to his Return as likewise to the Count  de Monterey  's upon Condition that they should neither make nor receive any Visits at  Madrid  A general Custom seldom fails to hold true for any particular Persons and 'tis an usual observation that when we begin to receive any one  Misfortune we ought to expect another  Don Juan  being perswaded that he was not happy enough to be excepted from this invidious Rule was desirous to strengthen his Party by the Authority of the Constable of  Castile  but he met with a very unlucky Rub in his way for having engaged the Duke of  Alva  to propose an Accommodation to him the Constable calling to mind the insupportable Pride wherewith  Don Juan  had formerly treated him and therefore still looking upon the Prince as his formidable Enemy answered very coldly that the time was past To encrease his troubles all those that were exiled came into favour for they took an opportunity to solicit their Return whilst he was sick and made such Advantages of that Conjuncture and pushed matters so home that the King was resolved to call home the QueenMother While they were deliberating upon the Conduct that was to be observed in this Affair the King held a long Conversation with the Inquisitor General he sent his Confessor to acquaint the Duke  de Medina Celï  of the House  de la Cerda  and the Count  d'Oropeza  of the House of  Braganza  to meet at an oppointed Hour at the Inquisitors When they were met the King sent them word by the aforementioned Father  Relux  to advise him of the best Method to remove  Don Juan  and recall the QueenMother The day was spent in Conference and after all it was unanimously agreed that the King should depart from the Palace as if he were going out to hunt and that before his Return he should send word to the Prince to withdraw immediately This Project was not put in Execution the Prince knew not a syllable of the matter and for want of resolution and courage the design fell  On the twenty sixth of  June  a Bullfeast was  kept where there was very good Sport at the same time the Marquess  de Fuentes  got to be made Counseller of the military Affairs The King gave Orders to the Gentlemen of his Bedchamber who were to meet the Queen upon the way to furnish themselves with three Suits of Clothes apeice and two of them were to be after the  French  fashion  Our Ambassador made his Entry on the thirteenth of  August  and we did not fail to go to some of our Friends to behold the Show 'Tis a Custom there for the King to send the Ambassador a certain number of Horses out of his own Stable both for himself and his Attendants for the Ambassadors make their Entry on Horseback next morning the  Major Domo  in waiting the Conductor of the Ambassadors and his Deputy accompanied him from his own House to the Palace In his publick Audience which he had of the King he always spoke in  French  the Procession of his Entry was a long time interrupted by the Opiniatreté of the Ambassador of  Malta  who pretended that his Coach ought immediately to follow that of the  Venetian  Ambassador who was the last Ambassador of the Chappel in such manner that he was got before the second Coaches of the Marquess  de Villars  But to put an End to the Dispute the Conductor of the Ambassadors was sent to the Palace where every thing was adjusted to the Advantage of the Ambassador of  France  and the Pretensions of him of  Malta  who was  Don Diego de Braeamonte  were adjudged to be ill grounded since the Ambassadors of Crowned Heads never gave him the right Hand at their Houses After some Instances on his side his Coach withdrew he is the first Ambassador of  Malta  that ever aspired to this Honour  Don Rodrigo de Silva de Mendoza  Duke  de Pastrane de l'Infantade  having been named by the King to go Ambassador extraordinary into  France  and to carry the presents of Marriage to Mademoiselle went immediately to  Toledo  to receive Orders of the QueenMother and being returned to  Madrid  he departed from thence with a dozen Postillions and six Trumpeters clad in green Velvet embroidered with Gold He had several Gentlemen and Pages with him and his two Brothers  Don Joseph  and  Don Gaspar de Silva  accompanied him in his Journey  Donna Catarina de Mendoza  his Mother gave him twenty thousand Pistoles and five thousand to each of his Brothers He was descended in a right line from Father to Son of  Rui Gomez  Prince  d'Eboli  who was made Duke  de Pastrane  by King  Philip  II whose  Privado  or principal Favourite he was as his Wife whose Beauty has made so great a Noise in the World was his Mistress The King named the Marchioness  de Mortare  the Marchioness  del Fresno  the Countess  de Santorcas  the Countess  Dayala  and the Marchioness  de Castra Forte  to be Ladies of Honour to the Queen and for Maids of Honour the Daughters of the Dutchess  de Sessa de Frias  those of the Marchioness  d'Alcanisa  of the Countess  de Villambrosa  of the Marchioness  de Villa Franca  of the Marchioness  de Villa Manriquez  those of the Dukes  d'Hijar  and  d'Albe  of the Counts  de Paredes  and  d'Arcos  the Sisters of the Duke  de Vareguas  and the Marquess  de Codar  the Daughters of the Duke  d'Hijar  and  Pastrane  were to be  Menines  or young Ladies of Honour They are not above ten years old and are the prettiest Ladies I have seen in  Spain Donna Laura d'Alarcon  was named to be the Mother of the Maids of Honour the Sons of the  Marquess  dè Villa Mariquez  and of the Count of St  Stephen  to be  Menins  or Pages to the Queen the Marquess  d'Astorgas Major Domo Major  the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  to be  Camarera Major  of the young Queen All these Ladies went to  Toledo  to take their Leave of the QueenMother and at their Return they went strait down to the Palace where he took Possession of those Chambers that were allotted to them The King presented a thousand Pistoles to every Maid of Honour to bear the expence of their Journey with a Pension of a thousand Ducats He gave the Title of Grandee to  Don Francis Maria Spinola  a Gentleman of  Genoa  Duke  de S Pierre  and Son in Law to the Marquess  de los Balbazez  He was a young Lord very well shaped and accomplished At the same time the Count  de Talara  brought the King a Resignation of his Office of Master of the Horse the Aversion between him and the Admiral of  Castile  made him unwilling to execute his Orders and since he saw himself recalled from Banishment he thought it the best way to leave the Court  A Courier arrived from  Cales  on the twentysecond of  August  who brought the News of the safe Arrival of the  Gallions  that were computed to be worth thirty Millions but above half the Treasure belonged to the Merchants They were once minded to seize the whole Cargo to defray the Charge of the Marriage and to serve for other occasional Expences However after a long consideration the Council finding it would utterly ruin all Commerce desisted from the Design  The Ministers and Grandees w  nt  complement the King on St  Le  's day because it was the Birthday of the young Queen he received them with a more pleasant  than was  his usual manner and having abundance of precious Stones in his Hat he told them that he wore them  for the sake of the Queen  The Cardinal  Portocarero  came to wait upon his Majesty he went from  Madrid  to  Toledo  very much discontented and told some persons that if the King did not receive him with more honour than he did the first time he would never come back again to Court but he had reason enough now to be satisfied for as he came out of the Coach he found the Halberdiers of the Guards under their Arms touching the Pavement with their Halberds as they always use to do when the King passes by So great and so welcom a Reception made him resolve not to give the right hand to Ambassadors and to the Grandees which at first a little displeased some People but the Dukes  de Medina Celi    d'Ossone  and  Alva  the Popes Nuncio and the  Venetian  Ambassador having made him a Visit were pleased to submit to the new Regulation he had established which some others followed after their Example  When it was known at  Madrid  that our King was to swear to the Peace at  Fountainbleau  on the last day of  August  the King of  Spain  came about four a clock in the afternoon to the great gilded Hall of the Palace to perform this Ceremony on his side The Marquess  de Villars  came to the Palace where he was received by the Master of the Ceremonies The Constable of  Castile  followed by all the  Major Domo  's received him at the Gate of the first Hall he passed through several Rooms each more magnificent than the other and hung with the richest Tapistry in the world At the upper end of the Hall there was a Scaffold erected cover+ed with  Persian  Tapistry grounded with Gold  was ascended by three Steps the King's Thron  was placed upon it all embroidered with large Pearls and precious Stones of admirable Beauty and Splendor The Cardinal  Portocarero  sat upon a Chair of State the Constable of  Castile  upon a little low Stool our Ambassador seated himself upon another Bench the Patriarch of the  Indies  continued standing The King came follawed by his Grandees and sat down and those whose right it was to sit down and be covered did it  Don Pedro Colonna  Secretary of State read with a loud Voice the Commission which our King had sent to the Marquess  de Villars  to assist at this Ceremony in his stead A little Silver Table was set before the King on which a Crucifix and the Gospel was placed The King kneeling set his right hand upon the Book all the while that the Cardinal read aloud the Oath which his Majesty took to keep Peace with  France  When this was over the Ambassador approached and made a Compliment to the King who briefly answered him according to the Custom and returned presently to his Apartment  All the Court was now filled with Joy A Masquerade on Horseback was kept in the great Court of the Palace it was divided into two Squadrons which ran against one another Prince  Alexander Farnese  Brother to the Duke of  Parma  led one and the Duke  de Medina de las Torres  led the other The King named the Constable of  Castile  and the Duke  de Medina Celi  to be Judges and Arbitrators of the Course  The Marquess  Defiat  arrived at  Madrid  from the part of Monsieur to make his Compliments to the King of  Spain  He received him very kindly and as a Person of his merit deserved he went to  Toledo  to wait upon the QueenMother and came back immediately On the  ninth of  August  a Courier from the Marquess  de los Balbazez  arrived at  Madrid  who brought the happy news that the marriage of the King with Mademoiselle had been solemnized at  Fountainbleau  and this gave occasion to Masquerades on Horseback and the Bonefires that were to be seen for three days together  All this publick Rejoycing did not in the least diminish  Don Juan  's melancholy and 'tis certain the great Perplexity of mind he was under very much impaired his Health and the Vigour of his Constitution He was at a stand what Party to take for as he had too much Bavery ever to think of giving way to his Enemies so his Credit was not strong enough to put him in Capacity of resisting them In this violent Condition he was sensible enough that he should never be able to sustain the Weight of his Affliction and to say the truth it cost him his Life at last But great men seldom complain when they become the Sport of Fortune and after their Example  Don Juan  expected his last day with the Constancy and Steadiness of a Heroe His Tertian Ague seized him again and on the seventh of  September  he found himself so extreamly ill that the Physicians acquainted the King that there was but little hopes of his Recovery At this News his Majesty wept and testified a sensible Grief He ordered Cardinal  Portocarero  to go to him and learn what Condition he was in he appeared but little concerned and prepared himself for Death like a good Christian and Philosopher He comforted all his Friends with a wonderful Presence of mind  A Man has lived long enough  said he to them  when he dies without having any thiog to reproach him I mean in Relation to Honour As for what Concerns my duty to God I have been too deficient    and the timeof my Repentance cannot be too long  He received the Holy  Viaticum  and the King almost every other moment came into his Chamber testifying a great deal of Friendship for him and tenderly complained that he would abandon him at a Juncture when his Assistance was become so necessary to him  Don Juan  made his Will by which he constituted the King his Heir he left almost all his Jewels to the young Queen and the QueenMother and named Cardinal  Portocarero  the Duke  de Medina Celi  the Duke of  Alva  and the President of  Castile  to be his Executors He likewise gave Order that as soon as ever he was dead they should remove his Cabinet which was filled with Papers of great Importance out of his own Apartment to that of the King This extream Illness of the Prince put some Stop to the publick Rejoycings that were resolved upon and particularly to a Bullfeast but however it did not hinder them from making fine artificial Fireworks in the Court of the Palace nay he desired it himself altho' he was troubled with a furious pain in his Head that might very well be increased with the Noise of Rockets and Crackers All this while his Physicians who knew nothing of the profound melancholy wherein he was plunged punished his body for an Indisposition that was properly lodged in the mind and made him suffer a sort of Martyrdom by the several Torments they inflicted upon him In fine this poor Prince died on the seventeenth of  September  on the very same day that his Father  Philip  IV did He was born in and abounded with a thousand good Qualities A little time after his Birth his Mother received the Habit of a religious Woman from the Hands of Pope  Innocent  X who was  then the Pope's Nuncio to King  Philip  IV this Action of her retiring out of the World justified her from abundance of Suspicions which People entertained upon the Score of her imprudent Conduct The King did not acknowledge him till the year He had the Grand Priory of  Malta  in  Castile  bestowed upon him and was sent against the  Portugueses  with the Title of  Generalissimo  of the Armies by Sea and Land After this he reduced the City of  Naples  to its obedience and went to  Flanders  to command the Troops there He was Governour of the Low Countries of  Burgundy  and  Charolois  but he came back to march once more against the  Portugueses  After the Death of the King his Father he passed his time as is abovementioned at  Consuegra  the Ordinary Residence of the Grand Prior of  Castile  and when the present King came to be of Age he continued near him On the twentieth his body was carried to the  Escurial  and was interred in the  Pantheon  for so the place is called where they lay the Bodies of the Kings of  Spain  but those of the Princes and Princesses of the Royal Family are placed in a Vault which is not far from it nay they don't lay the Bodies of the Queens of  Spain  in the  Pantheon  unless they have had Children He left a very beautiful Daughter behind him whom he had by a Person of great Quality She is a religious Person among the  Carmelites  at  Madrid  who are called  las Descalcas Reales  The first Journey the King made after the Death of  Don Juan  was to go and visit the QueenMother He parted the very same day from  Madrid  and lay on the way at  Aranjuez  and arrived the next day at  Toledo  The Queen received him with great Testimonies of Tenderness they mnigled their Tears together as they embraced  one another and dined and afterwards entertained one another a long time in private All those that accompanied the King kissed her Majesty's hand so after the day was agreed upon for her to come back to  Madrid  he left her We may easily believe that she took but little time to prepare her self for a Journey that was so welcome to her The King parted from  Madrid  on the twenty seventh he lay again at  Aranjuez  and the next day he set forward to meet the Queen on the way that leads to  Toledo  As soon as they met he desired her to come into his Coach that they might discourse in private and so he brought her to  Buen Retiro  which is one of the King's Houses scituate at the end of the City There she rested her self for some time till the House of the Duke  Duzeda  could be fitted up for her which it seems she chose to reside in because the Palace was not spacious enough to lodge the two Queens It would be an endless Piece of Trouble to reckon up all the Persons of Quality besides the vast Multitudes of People that accompanied their Majesties at their Arrival and indeed this mighty Alteration of Fortune was very remarkable on the QueenMother's side There was an universal Joy for her Return in the very same City where but two years ago  Don Juan  was seen to enter as the Deliverer of his Country and the Queen to go out like a meer Fugitive under all the weight of the publick Hatred The King tarried there till evening and there scarce passed a day over his Head from the time he went to meet the Queen first on the Road but he dined with her and staid a long time in her Company  All the new Queens Family were just upon the Point of going to meet her the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  made great Preparations and since every body in a manner envyed her for having so advantageous a Post and  Don Juan  her Protector was dead 'twas commonly believed that she would be obliged to resign it But she foresaw and prevented all this by taking Possession of her Apartment in the Palace from whence it was not so easie a matter to eject her now as it would have been before She departed on the twenty sixth of  September  with the Marquess  d'Astorgas  and the whole Family of the Queen except the Duke  d'Ossone  whose Equipage could not be got ready because he was but just returned from his Banishment  But before I carry on these  Memoirs  any farther I judge it not amiss to speak a few words of some of the Lords that belonged to the Court when I was there I shall particularly enlarge upon those that were of the Council of State for it will be no small Satisfaction to the Reader to know the Characters of those Persons whose names he meets so frequently I shall not here speak of the Duke  de Medina Celi  nor of the Constable of  Castile  neither do I pretend to name them according to their Rank and Order but shall only place them as they occur first to my Remembrance and shall begin with  The Duke of  Alva  or  Dalbe  of the Family of  Toledo  he has a vast Estate and a considerable Revenue and yet for all that is not before hand in the World he enjoys several good Places and a large Pension at Court He was a witty obliging Person and shew'd but little kindness to the QueenMother He was years old  Don Pedro de Arragon  was fomerly known by the name of the Marquess  de Pobar  he endeavoured to relieve  Perpignan  when he was General of the Horse but had the ill Luck to fall  into the Hands of the  French  amongst whom he continued a Prisoner for some time At his Return to  Madrid  the King made him Governour to the Prince  Don Baltazar  his Son who died by overheating himself and was afterwards let Blood in vain The King upon this was enraged against  Don Pedro  banished him When the King was dead the Queen Regent called him home and sent him Ambassador to  Rome  After this he was made Viceroy of  Naples  where according to the Custom he heaped a great Treasure together and what is more remarkable knew how to keep it for this is not the Genius of that Nation He was years old  The Admiral of  Castile  of the Family  d'Henriquez  descended from a Bastard of the Kings of  Castile  was a great Lord and better shaped than any in the Court He was tall of Stature and well proportioned the Air of his Face was great and noble and he had a world of Wit was of a gentle easie Deportment and had nothing to trouble him but only his being years old He had an excellent Tallent at writing of Verses which flowed naturally from him and in these Diversions he employed himself more than in his Domestick Affairs He was born a  Libertine  and lived private and could not fix himself so as to make a regular Court either to the King or the Chief Minister He was of opinion that whatever is done by Constraint cannot be recompensed by all the Favours of Fortune he communicated himself to a very few Persons whether it were because he had too exquisite and nice a Tast to accommodate himself to all the World or because he was a Lover of Solitude which the most delicious Gardens and the finest House in  Madrid  recommended to him Formerly he kept some Mistresses for whose Sakes he almost ruined  himself He was Master of the Horse to the King  The Marquess  d'Astorgas  of the Family  d'Ozorio  was in his time a person of the greatest Gallantry in the World and notwithstanding the Disadvantage of being years old continued still to be so He was of a chearful lively Spirit and talked justly and well upon all occasions He was Grand Master of the young Queens Horse His Lady having entertained an implacable Jealousie and Hatred against a young beautiful Woman for whom he had an extraordinanary Affection found an occasion to kill her took out her Heart and made a Ragoo of it When her Husband had eaten part of it she asked him how he liked it he answered very well I am much surprized at it says she for 'tis the Heart of your Mistress and immediately drew out her Head all bloody as it was from under her Farthingal and so threw it upon the Table where he was with several of his Friends 'Tis easie to imagine how deeply he was concerned at so Tragical a Sight she saved herself in a Convent whether she retired full of Rage and Jealousie and never stirred out of it The Marquess's affliction was so great that it had like to have made an end of him He was exceeding rich  The Prince  de Stillano  of the House of  Gusman  and Duke  de Medina de las Torres  had abundance of Wit and if he had joyned a little more Experience to his natural Parts had assuredly have been capable of the greatest Things Bu  he was never out of  Madrid  and lived an effeminate lazy Life there which alienated his mind from all manner of Business He lived at  Floride  near the Gates of  Madrid  where he ha  charming Gardens and continued there unde  so unconcerned a State that he neither received nor made any Visits and never endeavoured to draw any Advantages from the Court he had a prodigious Estate but for all that it was sufficiently intangled for want of putting every thing in order When he married the Daughter of Duke  d'Albe  he ordered a Sedan to be made for her all covered over with Plates of Gold and garnished with Coral but when it was finished no body was found strong enough to carry it He was years old and was deeply in the interests of the QueenMother  The Duke  d'Ossone  of the House  de' Giron  was Master both of good and bad Qualities that equally distinguished him He loved his Friends passionately and served them freely with his Credit and Purse he was of a liberal Temper and a great Adorer of Ladies sparing no Cost to ingratiate himself with them he was an irreconcileable Enemy and withal was of a proud haughty imperious Humour that made him insupportable to all the World And yet his Conversation was diverting and pleasant enough when he could leave off his Grandeur and Rhodomontadoes He was a man of an inflexible Steadiness and always had some Quarrel or other in Court or City He was one of the richest Noblemen in  Spain  and might be about years old He had been ViceRoy of  Catalonia  Governour of  Milan  President of the Orders and was Master of the Horse to the young Queen  The Count  de Chinchon  was formerly called Marquess  de Bayonna  He had been General of the Spanish Gallies was a brave man he neither was rich nor desired to be so He was years old  Don Vincente Gonzagua  Prince  de Guastalla  had never been married he was a very polite  witty Person and came very young to the Spanish Court where he ran through most of the considerable Posts and always acquitted himfelf well in them He had been ViceRoy of  Catalonia  and  Sicily  and being a man of singular Integrity  Don Juan  caused him to come to him to  Madrid  in order to give him a place in the Council He was years old  Don Louis Portocarero  Cardinal and ArchBishop of  Toledo  possessed the greatest Benefices in  Spain  He was extreamly rich and his Archbishoprick was worth three hundred and sixty thousand Crowns  per annum  to him He did abundance of good in his Station was very obliging and courteous of an easie Temper and had the Repute of being an honest man He might be about years old  The Marquess  de Liche  who carried the name of  de Haro Gusman  had two very opposite Qualities he was liberal and yet covetous he carried his magnisicence even to an excess considering his Rank in the World but especially towards his Mistresses nevertheless he sometimes shewed his Frugality in Things that did him no Credit He had but an ordinary meen and was ill favoured but was Master of all the Wit Penetration and Vivacity imaginable He was a great Lord full of Ambition and so naturally forward and adventurous that they feared him at Court and kept him always at a great Distance He was Ambassador at  Rome  and was years old  The Court  de Monterey  was Brother to the Marquess  de Liche  more medling in all Affairs and no less ambitious but more discreet and more moderate gallant liberal and witty He had a great deal of Experience and People were well contented with his Conduct in the Government  of  Flanders  He was not above years old 'Twas observable that he was wellshaped and his Wife very deformed whereas the Marquess  de Liche  his Brother was very deformed and his Wife exceeding beautiful  The Marquess  de los Balbazez  a  Genoese  of the House of  Spinola  was very rich He was not without justice reproached for falling into an excess in the management of his domestick concerns He married the Sister of the Constable  Colonna  The bigness and figure of that Lady were very remarkable It must be owned that he had both zeal and capacity for the service of his Master He had been Governour of  Milan  and afterwards was Ambassador at  Vienna  and at  France  and Plenipotentiary at  Nimeguen  He was years old  Don  Diego Sarmiento  was originally of  Gallicia  his birth was not illustrious The Queen Mother protected him and procured for him the place of Councellor of State because he was altogether devoted to her service He was a person of great abilities and prudence and reckoned to be years old  The Duke  de VillaHermosa  of the House of  Borgia  mightily increased his fortunes during his stay in  Flanders  where he was Governour He passed for a person of great bravery and had the Character of a sweet tempered affable man He was not very rich and might be about years old  Don  Melchior Navarra  owed his elevation to his good fortune and to the Queen Mother He was a man of great merit and knowledge and was a member of the Council Royal He lest  Spain  in the year to be ViceRoy of  Peru  and was supposed to be years old  The Marquess  de LosVelez  was Son to the Marchioness  de LosVelez  who had been Governante to the King He married the Sister of the Dutchess  de Medina Celi  he was ViceRoy of  Naples  and made himself to be beloved there for his good qualities He was master of a great fortune but of greater Vertues and was but years old  The Count  d Oropèsa  who carries the name of  Toledo  conjunctly with that of  Portugal  was young and not above years old His stature was somewhat of the lowest otherwise he was well enough made as to his person of a smiling agreeable countenance and a sweet and insinuating conversation open in appearance but in effect very reserved and close not always speaking as he thought and generally intent upon nothing but to deceive and amuse He pretended to be devout and under the exterior shew of unconcernedness for the world concealed his great ambition to which he might be prompted perhaps by his illustrious birth he was of the House of  Portugal  and presumptive Heir of that Kingdom in case the King had no Children The King at that time loved him exceedingly and this love has been since wonderfully increased he is become a favourite and chief Minister  The Marquess  de Mansera  had been formerly sent Ambassador into  Germany  and afterwards was made ViceRoy of  NewSpain  where he enriched himself and came back to  Madrid  He was of so unhealthful a constitution that he could not fill the chief places of the Government which otherwise he might have done being a person of great capacity in regard of his experience and judgment He was years old  The Duke  d'Albuquerque  was General at Sea he was very brave and was not destitute of wit He married the Daughter of his Eldest Brother to keep up the name of his Family which was that of  Cueva  and was very antient He might be about years old  Don  Juan Jeronimo d'Eguya  was born at  G  sne  but his family was of  Navarre  and his Father had been Gentleman to the Duke  de Turcis  he was well shaped and agreeable had abundance of wit and lived in the quality of a Page to Don  Pedro Fernandez del Campo  Secretary of State his Master loved him exceedingly and made him his chief Commissary He afterwards rose to be Secretary for Don  Pedro del Campo  not being in the good graces of  Valenzuela    d'Eguya  was chosen to officiate in his place by a Commission and after some time had the good fortune to get it for himself for he to whom it belonged died of grief because he was not permitted to exercise it any longer The King had a great kindness for him and he behaved himself towards his Majesty with all the Address imaginable His Office was under the King's apartment he was called Secretary of State and  del Despacho Universal  He was never of the Council his employment directly fastned him to the Person of the King and chief Minister He kept the  Bolsillo  without being obliged to give up his accounts Now these are the Fines that come to the King as well from  Spain  as the  Indies  they amount to a prodigious Sum and are employed for secret services either by way of Presents or Pensions  All these Persons whom I have mentioned were very eminent and considerable and possessed the Chief Offices and greatest employments  There is another Class of Courtiers still behind which is only composed of young Lords who are there called  Guaps  as we call them in  France les petits Maitres  The most witty and wellshaped among these are reckoned to be the Duke  d'Uuzeda  the Marquess  de Penaranda  the Count  d'Altamire  the Sons of the Duke  de Cessa  the Prince  de Montoleon  Don  Antonio  and Don  Francisco de Toledo  Sons of the Duke  Dalbe  and Don  Fernand de Toledo  his Nephew the two  Silva  Brothers to the Duke  de Pastrane  the Marquess  de Leyva  the Duke  de Medina Sidonia  the Marquess  de Quintana  and the Son of the Duke  de Medina Celi  Altho the eldest of these Lords is not above years old yet they were most of them married for they take care in  Spain  to make themselves acquainted with his Godship  Hymen  as soon as is possible  And now as for the Ladies I shall only say in general that there is no place in the world where they have a greater share of vivacity and wit and a better talent to please than they have in  Spain  amongst these without reckoning the Maids of Honour that belonged to the two Queens the most remarkable for wit were the Dutchesses  Dalbuquerque    de Terra Nova    d'Ossone    de Frias    de Medina Celi    d'Hijar    de Pastran  and the Countesses  de Monterey  and  de Villambrosa  for beauty the Marchioness  de Liche  the Princess  de Montelion  the Marchioness  de la Roche  the Countess  de Penaranda  the Princess  Stillano  the Dutchess  d'Osseda  the Wife of Don  Pedro of Arragon  that of Don  Henrique Henriques  and the Marchioness  de la Puebla  The constraint wherein they live the Climate of the Country and their own natural temper carry them to Gallantry on course They are for the most  part little lean and slender their skin is swarthy soft and painted their features regular their eyes full of fire their hair black and in great abundance and their feet small to admiration Their habit sits so ill upon them that unless one has been long accustomed to it she can scarce know how to endure it The men are no less disadvantageously apparelled they always come to Court in their  Golilia  and a black Cloak and hanging Sleeves and altho' they be never so well shaped and handsom with fine heads of hair and good features yet their awkward way of dressing and parting their hair on one side of their face and throwing it behind their ears does abominably disfigure them  This digression has caused me to interrupt the series of these Memoirs but now to reassume my discourse I must inform my Reader that the good understanding which passed between the King and the QueenMother occasioned abundance of people to make their Court to the latter They looked upon her as a Princess who had assumed all her former Authority for the King was still young and had need of good counsel and his Mother being accustomed to Govern was for all sorts of reasons more capable to direct him than any one besides Nay it was commonly believed that she would not be displeased to take the Government again into her hands and so some by inclination and others out of policy endeavoured to get into her favour in order to obtain some place or other under the new Ministry that was going to be formed as well upon the score of her return as the arrival of the young Queen  The world had reason to believe that the face of affairs would be absolutely changed  and therefore every one thought of himself in the present conjuncture 'Tis true abundance of persons that were very well read in Politicks judged that the QueenMother would not perhaps manage the Reins of the Government they pretended  that this would be always a weighty and troublesom Charge that she had been of late years accustomed to ease and quietness and having undergone all the varieties of an uncertain fortune she was afraid of seeing her self exposed to them the second time that there was hopes she would disswade the King from taking a chief Minister and that she would be forward enough to make him conceive an aversion for one that to effect this she only needed to put him in mind of the sorry figure he made when Don  Juan  had such an authority over him and that in fine she would endeavour to form a Junta which should be composed of her own Creatures that this would be the true way to R  n without making her self responsible for any events that all her Orders would be punctually executed and yet she not appear to have any hand in them  I ought to acquaint my Reader that a  Junta  is an extraordinary Council of State which the Kings of  to remedy the pressing necessities of the State For example  Philip  IV by his last Wi  created a  Junta  to serve and assist the  Council during the minority of the  his Son  Thus people searched after and as easily found out the Lords who were to compose this  Junta  the hatred or the friendship of those persons that made re  ections upon the present affairs enriched or impoverished those they had a  mind to they bestowed Offices and took them away they made vows to no purpose and had effectual fears and apprehensions upon them In a word all these busie Spirits were divided upon the point and the most quiet among them found themselves somewhat concerned for what was to come But the QueenMother made no stir she seemed in appearance to have no other thoughts than how to establish her self in the favour of the King her Son and serve her self in the same condition  This young Prince was passionately in love and was sensible of all the pleasure that accompanies those agreeable Ideas that love uses to inspire and flattered himself to see all his expectations suddenly crowned the possessing a Princess who was already become so dear to him employed his heart to such a degree that he could think of nothing else He pressed the time of his departure that he might be the sooner with her  The arrival of the Courier who brought the news that the Queen was advanced towards the frontiers was expected with extream impatience The Marquess  de l  s Balbazez  sent them word exactly on what day she was to arrive at  Irun  while she was in the territories of  France  the King's Houshold waited upon her The Prince  d'Harcourt  accompanied her in quality of Ambassador Extraordinary and the Princess his Wife likewise made the Journey The Marshal  de Clerambaut  ▪s Lady who was Governness to her waited upon her as Lady of Honour Mademoiselle  de Grance  as Lady of the Wardrobe and this place has left her the name of Madam instead of that of Mademoiselle Nothing was omitted in any of the Cities  through which her Majesty passed to receive her with a respect suitable to her high rank and we may say she so much set off the Grandeur of her Birth by her natural beauty and by her engaging and courteous deportment that all  France  was sensibly grieved to lose her  One of the first persons that took the freedom to speak to the Queen and give her advice was a Religious  Theatin  called Father  Vintimiglia  He was born in  Sicily  of an Illustrious Family and was Brother to the Count  de Prade  who happened to be Governour of  Palermo  at the time when that City revolted in the late troubles He had been seized and people thought it would have cost him his head but he got the favour to be sent to  Madrid  to justifie himself his Brother the  Theatin  went along with him to assist him with his credit He was a bold hardy adventurous man and devoted himself entirely to Don  Juan  and his zeal for that Prince carried him so far that in some of his Sermons he spoke of the QueenMother with very little respect This Father departed from  Madrid  in company with the Duke  d'Ossone  and tho' he had not now any hopes of being made the Queen's Consessor as he had before the death of Don  Juan  yet he could not forbear to go as far as  Bayonne  to salute her his deportment his birth and his knowledge of the  French  tongue which he spoke perfectly well because he had resided a long time at  Paris  procured him access enough to the young Queen to take his opportunity of prepossessing her with some suspicions and jealousies against the Queen her MotherinLaw and the  French  Ambassador By this piece of conduct he did not only design to injure those persons who had formerly  been enemies to Don  Juan  but he had a particular aim that Personally respected himself and wherein his ambition had by much the upper hand of his discretion and that was to perswade the Queen to endeavour the erecting of a  Junta  that was to depend solely upon her He told her that in order to bring this design about she was to chuse the Duke  d'Ossone  to be a member of it because he was a person of consummate abilities and besides had a great zeal for her Majesty he took care to reckon himself in the number of the Ministers and could not forbear to write a Scheme of the Government the Memoirs of which he gave to the Duke  d'Harcourt  to the end that he might present them to the Queen but 'tis very probable he never showed them to her Majesty  The Queen was now advanced as far as St  JohndeLuz  and she departed from thence about One a Clock in the Afternoon on the third of  November  followed by the Guards  du Corps  of the King She came to a Wooden house that was purposely prepared for her it was Gilded and Painted within and without there was a great Hall in it a Chamber and a moveable Closet of CrimsonDamask with Galloon and a rich Lace of Gold and Silver This House was scituate upon the brink of the River  de Bidassoa  which parts  France  from  Spain  As soon as the Queen arrived there she put on a most sumptuous Habit then coming into the Hall she took part of a noble Collation There she staid a little and afterwards retired into her Chamber after this she ascended a Scaffold and placed her self in a Chair of State under a noble Canopy at this very moment she was seized with an air of melancholy which shewed what a regret  she had to be so near leaving  France  The Prince  d'Harcourt  placed himself at her right hand the Princess  d'Harcourt  at her left the Mareshal  de Clerambaut  's Lady and Madam  de Grance  behind her Chair Monsieur  de Saintot  went to inform the Marquess  d'Astorgas  of it who was  Major Domo  to the Queen He was in a Boat upon the River near a little Island which the Treaty of the  Pyranees  has rendred since so famous and which was joyned to the Queen's House by a Bridge of Communication The Guards  de Corps  formed themselves into several Squadrons in this place The Marquess was waiting for his Orders in this Boat which was very magnificent and was prepared on purpose to carry her Majesty over to the other side  As soon as he was informed that the Queen expected him he set foot upon the ground and fourscore Persons Gentlemen Pages or Valets marched on foot before him he threw himself immediately at the feet of the Queen kissed her hand made her a Complement got up again and covered himself without staying for the Queen to say any thing to him The Prince  d Harcourt  covered himself likewise at the same time The Marquess spoke to her all the while in  Spanish  and presented her Majesty with two Letters from the King and QueenMother but before he gave them he touched them upon his Forehead his Eyes his Mouth and his Heart as the fashion is The Queen told him she was extreamly glad that the King her Husband had given him the charge of conducting her After this the old Marquess turned himself towards the Prince  d'Harcourt  and made him a Complement who answered that he had Orders from the King his Master to deliver the Queen of  Spain  into his hands Monsieur  de Chateauneuf  Counsellor of the Parliament of  Paris  read the Act of Deliverance in  French  and Don  Alanson    Carnero  Secretary of State read the Act of Reception in  Spanish  The Marquess presented several Persons of Quality to her Majesty who kissed her hand kneeling down upon one Knee The Bishop of  Pampelune  kissed her hand but did not kneel The Queen did not press to depart but the Marquess informed her that it was high time to march she immediately arose placing him on her right hand and a  Menin  of Honour on her left upon whose shoulder she leaned for he was a young Boy and thus she advanced towards the Bridge The Dutchess  de Terra Nova  met her just about the middle and kissed her hand with the Ladies of the Palace that followed her who threw themselves all at her Feet After the Dutchess had made her Complement she presented several  Spanish  Ladies to the Queen Monsieur  de Repaire  Lieutenant of the Kings Guards  du Corps  who carried the Queens Train gave it to the Dutchess The Queen entred into the Boat along with her her Chamber was glazed all over and thus being all alone with this old Dame she cast her eyes frequently towards that side of the Kingdom which she had quitted and her languishing air sufficiently testified by what commotions she was agitated within Twenty four Seamen placed in two Barks drew the Boat along and the  Spanish  Horse discharged their Musquetoons and Pistols as soon as it began to move the Artillery of  Fontarabia  answered them with a great firing The Prince and Princess  d'Harcourt  the other Ladies and all the Queens Attendants passed over in Boats that were prepared on  purpose The Queen setting foot upon the Ground towards the evening found her own Coach her Litter and a Chair with abundance of Men in Liveries she placed her self in her Chair and twenty Valets on foot lighted the way with long Flambeaux of White Wax when they came to  Irun    Te Deum  was sung and this was the first time her Supper was served after the  Spanish  fashion the repast was so little and so ill drest that she was extremely surprized at it and could scarce eat at all  Alas that a young Princess bred up in the most magnificent and refined Court in the World should be forced to pass so many sorrowful melancholy moments She had always had the liberty hitherto to eat in publick and it had not been denied to her upon the way she danced she rode on Horseback she knew and esteemed those that were her Companions and they if I may use the expression adored her And now she found her self all on a sudden amongst persons whom she knew not and consequently could not appear amiable enough to divert her grief she understood so very little of their Language that she could not tell what they meant or return them any answer without trouble then besides all this the manner wherein they served her appeared so strange and carried so small a resemblance to that of  France  that she was not a little discomposed at it All was Ceremony all was Restraint and Affectation from the very first day she appeared amongst them the  Spaniards  expected she should know and do every thing as readily as themselves who had been learning them the better part of their lives They never considered the difference between the two Nations that  are opposite to one another in every punctilio but believing that her Majesty ought immediately to be made acquainted with their way of living which she was religiously to observe for the rest of her life they dispensed with her in nothing so that from that time she suffered a kind of slavery to which the rigid humour of her  Camarera Major  contributed very much but the natural sweetness of the Queen's temper and her prudence made her receive all these things that naturally fatigued and displeased her with a world of patience  Nevertheless one would have been apt to conclude that out of meer policy the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  ought to have managed the good disposition of the Queen after another manner especially since having no interest in her at present she ought by a courteous deportment to have gained her favour because she had so great a number of considerable enemies and the greatest part of the Court Ladies were desirous of her place The Prince who advanced her to this Post was already dead all appearances seemed to predict her fall and she her self was very apprehensive of it However she took different measures from what any body would have thought she ought to observe for instead of shewing any complaisance to her young Mistress she became a spy upon her actions so that by this means she might merit the King's favour She studied all her inclinations and her humour she frequently caused some  French  Women that follow'd her to  Madrid  to be entertained she drew strange consequences from the slightest occasions and every thing became poyson in her hands She likewise drew for her self a Plan of the conduct she was to follow  and this effectually hindred her from being turned out of her Post  She was not only content with taking these remote measures to ingratiate her self with the King but likewise was of opinion that to secure her own interests she was to hinder the young Queen from ever having any friendly correspondence with the Queenmother or reposing any confidence in her because her party being absolutely opposite to that of Don  Juan  it was natural to believe that the first sacrifice she would demand of her DaughterinLaw would be the removal of the  Camarera  who was the Creature of her Enemy Besides she could not flatter her self that the young Queen would refuse to give the QueenMother this proof of her complaisance at a conjuncture that would deliver her from a sort of a Governess whom she had no great reason to love thus she could not think of a better expedient to support her self than by possessing the Queen  That the QueenMother was her secret enemy that she would oppose her in every thing that she could never forget that she was in part the cause that the marriage of the ArchDutchess her GrandDaughter was not consummated with the King her Son that she was always uneasy because she had not that ascendant as she desired over the King's affections that she was resolved to keep her under a subjection that was more befitting a DaughterinLaw than the Spouse of so great a Monarch  To effect this more easily she had instructed some persons that stood very near the Queen who acted their parts well enough When they first took the Liberty to discourse her about this affair she thought them to be altogether  devoted to her service and their pretended tears seem'd to engage for the sincerity of their apparent zeal  What have you lost Madam would they say to her sometimes with a mournful air What have you lost by the Death of Don  Juan  What would not he have done to please you If it had not been for him the King had married the Arch Dutchess and his breaking off that Match drew abundance of mortal enemies upon him Now if you could promise your self that the Ambassador of  France  would prove faithful to you you might find some consolation in him you might follow his advice and profit your self by his directions but considering his present dispositions Heaven preserve you Madam from taking his Counsel Alas he quarrelled with Don  Juan  only upon the Queen Mothers account he clearly declared himself for her in his first Embassie and she reposes an intire confidence in him Thus your Majesty cannot show your self too great a stranger to such a Minister that will never go cordially along with you and who will penetrate into your private sentiments for no other reason than only to make an ill use of them  The Queen was extreamly alarm'd at the things they told her and knew not which way to determine her self being so young and having no experience in this new world where she was acquainted with no body  She departed from  Irun  and lay that night at  Hernani  The next day she mounted on Horseback followed by the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  who made but a sorry figure upon her Mule Madam  de Grance  accompanied her The Marquess  d'Astorgas  and the Duke  d'Ossone    with each a pair of Spectacles upon their Nose as is the fashion of the Grandees bore their shares in the Cavalcade The Marquess placed himself next her Majesty because she was to be his charge till she saw the King but the Duke pretended a Right to the same place as being Master of the Horse and so took it by force menacing the Marquess very haughtily This dispute obliged the Queen to take Coach again She lay that night at  Tolositte  where as soon as she was arrived the Duke  d'Ossone  arrested the Guard who had abused his Coachman because he would not suffer the Coach of the Marquess  d'Astorgas  to go before his This quarrel was renewed upon the discharging of their Offices the Marquess pretended that all the honour of the Queens Reception belonged to him the Duke maintained that he being Master of the Horse ought therefore to have all the preeminences in her House To decide the matter they were forced to write to the King about it who decided it in favour of the Marquess The Duke not thinking himself justly dealt with continued his pretensions still but this obstinacy drew an Order upon him to return to  Madrid  with a prohibition to pass through  Burgos  where the King was at that time  In effect the King left  Madrid  on the twenty second of  October  being but slenderly accompanied The Duke  de Medina Celi  Lord Chamberlain the Constable and Don  Joseph de Silva  were all three in his Coach as for the Admiral of  Castile  he did not go along with them for he pretended that for want of mony he was not in a capacity to fit out any answerable equipage there might indeed be something of truth in this  pretence but it is certain that his natural laziness was the real occasion he loved his pleasure he shunned all trouble and carefully avoided whatever might make him uneasie and this was the true reason why he did not meet the King and Queen till they were within a days journey of  Madrid  The King continued fifteen days at  Burgos  because he was extreamly troubled with a Cold in the mean time the Queen advanced forwards by small journeys She wrote to him several times and he answered her again Her Majesty was forced to send to him to demand leave to dine in publick and sometime to ride on Horseback for those two terrible Creatures the Marquess  d'Astorgas  and the  Camerara Major  would not consent to it till they had received positive Orders He granted it very freely and she sent to him in this place a Watch beset with Diamonds and a Cravat with a Knot of a fire colour He immediately put on the Cravat and ordered five hundred Pistols to be given to the Gentleman who brought him the Present  The Count  d'Altamire  Grandee of  Spain  came to  Ognate  to complement the Queen from the King and presented her with a Bracelet of Diamonds and Rubies She arrived on the eleventh to  Victoria  where a lamentable Comedy was prepared to Regale her There it was that she drest her self first  à l'Espagnolle  and she appeared no less beautiful and charming in that than in her  French  Habit She went likewise to the Great Church where the Bishop of  Calahorra  received her at the Gate and held the Canopy over her she afterwards was pleased to go and see a Bullfeast in the Marketplace but there was little or no magnificence in the sight  because it was only performed by Citizens She received in this place a pair of Pendants for the Ears with Pearls to them of a Pear fashion this Present was sent to her from the Queen Mother and was valued at four hundred thousand Livers  Monsieur the Ambassador of  France  came to wait upon her at  Bribiesca  and tho' he tarried but a little time with her and their Conversation was but short yet he could very easily observe that she exprest a great uneasiness and a particular distrust of him he could not penetrate into the reason of it however he presently judged that these dispositions were not natural to her he told her several things that might be serviceable to her he advised her not to amuse her self with the different impressions that any persons might endeavour to make upon her that she ought to consider that the greatest part of those that waited on her only minded their own proper interests that her surest way would be to love the King cordially and so by that means engage him to love her to unite her self to the Queen Mother and concert all Affairs with her that she ought to rest satisfied that that Princess had a great kindness for her and that if she took care to make suitable returns she would find the affections of a true Mother in her The young Queen was already prepared for this discourse and particularly for what concerned the Queen Mother She had been tampered with upon that point before but if she had seriously examined what he spoke to her she had soon been made sensible as she was a person of extraordinary wit that the Ambassador dealt plainly with her and that whoever perswaded her to the contrary  endeavoured to disunite her from her real interests He took his leave of her and went back to the King at  Burgos  and during this short time he had the honour to discourse with her she still entertained him with great coldness and indifferency  The Prince  d'Harcourt  was advanced as far as  Burgos  to salute the King and since the Queen was to come to  Quintanapalla  which is within three leagues of it it was generally supposed that she would come to lie there on the nineteenth of  November  and that the Ceremony of the Marriage would be there solemnized But the Marquess  de Villars  having met as he was coming back the Patriarch of the  Indies  who was going to meet the Queen it came immediately into his head that the Marriage might perhaps be consummated without his being informed of it this thought made him inquire the news of Don  Geronimo d'Eguya  Secretary of State who only told him that the Queen was expected the next day at  Burgos  This doubtful answer which had nothing positive in it obliged our Ambassador to inform himself still more particularly and he understood at last that the King was to go the next day to  Quintanapalla  to celebrate the Marriage Being assured of this he took care to send advice of it to the Prince  d'Harcourt  and they departed together soon enough to be with the Queen before the King arrived thither  When they came there they found it no diffificult matter to discover that the  Spaniards  desired to have the Marriage solemnized without them The  Camerara Major  who was altogether of that opinion and to whom they spoke with abundance of honest freedom told them  coldly that they were not to assist at the Ceremony and that the King would have no body be there except only those whose presence was indispensably necessary such as the chief Officers and some Gentlemen of the BedChamber The Prinoe  d'Harcourt  and the Marquess  de Villars  answered that the King their Master had given them Orders to be present at it She fiercely replied that the King their Master had nothing to do to command in  Spain  Monsieur  de Villars  told her that the King his Master was used to command his Ambassadors and that they would obey him in every thing that if the King was not willing to have him assist at his Marriage he ought to signify to them by an Order in writing that they were not to be there The  Camerara  ravished with joy that she had an opportunity to show her zeal for the King of  Spain  altho this was a very improper time for it was so far transported with the matter and spoke several things so incoherent and fierce that the Ambassadors lest her and addressed themselves to the Marquess  d'Astorgas  he patiently listned to them and told them ingenuously that he would immediately dispatch a Gentleman to the King to know his pleasure herein This Gentleman found him on the way and he consented that the Messieurs  d'Harcourt  and  Villars  should assist at the Ceremony In short it was occasioned by the industrious diligence of some persons who had no inclination to the  French  that this thought was insinuated into the King They were of opinion that so August a Marriage ought not to be Celebrated in a poor Village where there were not above a dozen Houses and their  Spanish  vanity was so extreamly offended at it as to desire that the  Ambassadors of so great a King might not be witnesses of so great a negligence not to say misery And now to excuse the matter they gave out that the King was young and amorous that every thing that hastned the pleasure of seeing his Spouse touched him so sensibly that he even forgot the magnificence and grandeur of his Rank that love alone made up the Honours of his Feast and that the King thought this alone sufficient The Queen having passed the night at  Quintanapalla  about ten a clock in the morning was told that the King was arrived this news caused a small emotion in her and spread a colour upon her Cheeks that made her still appear more beautiful and lovely She went to receive him in her  Spanish  dress and having met him as he was just going to enter her AntiChamber she would have thrown her self several times at his feet and kissed his hand but he hindred her still and saluted her after the  Spanish  fashion that is without kissing her but pressing her arms close with his two hands and calling her often  Mireina    Mireina  my Queen my Queen They discoursed together a long time without being able to understand one another and this was certainly no little pain to them Monsieur  Villars  who perceived it advanced forward to serve as an Interpreter if he did not say every thing they said it is at least very certain that he spoiled nothing of their conversation and that he mingled a great deal of tenderness and passion with it The King was drest  à la Scombergue  which is properly after the  French  mode and all his attendants were clad after the same manner For the campagne habits of the  Spaniards  somewhat resemble ours  The Marquess  de Villars  having observed that the Gandees of  Spain  took the right hand spoke to the King about it and represented to him the rank the Marquess  de los Balbazez  had given to him at  Fountainbleau  when the Queen was espoused there This reason prevailed so the King ordered the Ambassadors of  France  to be treated after the same manner The Constable of  Castile  could not be brought to quit his place without some trouble he had still a small dispute upon the point which continued a little time between the Ambassador and him however civility was still preserved on both sides and the rest of the Grandees placed themselves behind the King  on  Antonio de Benavidez y Bazan  Patriarch of the  Indies  and Grand Almoner gave them a second benediction the Ceremony was performed  incognito  in the Queen's AntiChamber If the ArchBishop of  Burgos  had not been indisposed he had performed this Office Whilst Mass was saying they put a Ribbond of black Taffaty about the King and Queen tied up in a true Lovers knot and a white Gauze with a Silver Fringe upon the King's Shoulders and over the Queen's Head The Dutchess  de Terra Nova  held up her Train When the Ceremony was over the King and Queen withdrew into a Chamber by themselves where they continued two hours alone They dined afterwards in publick and parted from thence to go and lie at  Burgos  There was no body with them in the Coach and since they did understand one another but very little one can scarce imagine what they said however the King appeared very amorous and affectionate several Grandees of  Spain  went before their Majesties with very stately Liveries and  accompanied them to the Palace where a Comedy was acted and artificial Fireworks were to be seen  The next day the King came to a rich Abbey of Nuns that are called  Las Huelgas  which is not much beyond the Suburbs of  Burgos  She dined there and about three a Clock made her entry on Horseback being drest after the  Spanish  mode but appeared so beautiful and charming that she ravished the hearts of all the Spectators Three Grandees marched before her the Marquess  d'Astorgas  followed her a Canopy was carried over her Head the Old Dutchess  de Terra Nova  rode upon a Mule and the Maids of Honour accompanied her on Horseback On the twenty second of  November  Prince  d'Harcourt  made his entry and had Audience of the King and Queen after Dinner there was a Bullfeast which pleased the Queen exceedingly because the Cavaliers showed extraordinary dexterity and courage in the performance The day following she saw the  Parejas  that is to say an HorseRace in which nothing is observable but that two men who start together ride even without going a step one before the other altho they ride full speed Sixty Gentlemen clad in Silver Brocard ran after this manner  After they had thus spent three days in different pleasures and diversions it was high time to think of going to  Madrid  most of the  French  Gentlemen and Ladies that followed the Queen took leave of her in this place so that the greatest part of the Houshold went back to  France  but this was not done without shedding abundance of Tears The Queen had the liberty still to keep with her her two Nurses two  Women of the Chamber some  Valets de Chambre  a Gentleman to look after five or six  English  Horses she had ordered to be brought with her and some other Officers for her Table She presented the Prince and Princess  d'Harcourt  the Marshal  d'Clarembaut  's Lady and Madam  de Grance  with her Picture enriched with Diamonds of different prices according to the Quality of the persons to whom she gave them and the obliging manner wherewith she knew how to accompany her liberalities augmented the price of them exceedingly They pretend that the Present the King made the Prince  d'Harcourt  was worth twenty hundred thousand Crowns but it fell much short of it the Queen got a Pension of two thousand Crowns for Madam  de Grance  which was to be paid her whereever she lived  The Princess  d'Harcourt  and the other Ladies that followed the Queen went back to  France  while she and the King took the way to  Madrid  being both by themselves and sate in the back part of the Coach Several Officers of the Houshold went before and marched by different Roads to avoid an embarras the Counts  d'Arcos  and  de Talara  Don  Joseph de Silva  and the Duke  d'Hijar  Gentlemen of the Chamber were named by the King to accompany him in his journey he came back the very same way as he went to  Burgos  he lay at  Lerma  at  Aranda  at St  Stephen de Gormas  and at  Guadalajara  The Nuncio and the  Venetian  Ambassador came thither to make their Complements to the Queen The next day their Majesties arrived at  Torrejon  which is within three leagues of  Madrid  All the while that the Court was on the way from  Burgos  to this place the  Camerara Major  frequently discoursed the King in private She found it no difficult matter to insinuate those sentiments into him that are so natural to the  Spaniards  and he had for his share been educated in a Country where they make no reckoning of a Ladies virtue unless they take away from her all opportunities of transgressing  She represented to him the ill consequences of that liberty which the Women are allowed in  France  that it was absolutely necessary for the Queen to live after the retired manner that those of her sex observe at  Madrid  that she was young lively and of a brillant spirit accustomed to the  French  fashions that what is innocent in one place may become criminal in another but if he would be pleased to confide in her she would by her great diligence prevent every thing  The King commended her zeal and gave her sufficient assurances of his confidence  The Queen Mother was arrived at  Torrejon  before the King she quitted her Apartment to go and meet their Majesties when the King saw her he ran to her and embraced her very tenderly the young Queen advanced forward at the same time to kiss her hand but the Queen Mother would not suffer it She took her between her Arms and embraced her several times with great testimonies of friendship treating her still by the Name of  her Majesty  but the young Queen told her that she requested her to call her Daughter and love her as one and to be perswaded that she had all those dutiful sentiments for her that might make her worthy of this Honour The King  gave her his hand on one side and the Queen Mother on the other and thus going between them she entred the Palace that had been prepared to receive them The Queen Mother perceiving that the Queen had never a Muff presented her with her own about which was a great knot of Diamonds afterward she took from her a Ribbond that tied some of her Tresses and in exchange put upon her Arm a Bracelet that was computed to be worth three thousand Pistols In a word she showed the Queen all marks of her good inclinations to her from which she might promise her self all happy consequences She staid with their Majesties as long as she could but went home that evening because this place had not conveneincies enough to receive her The next day which was the second of  December  the King and Queen arrived at  Madrid  in a Coach with the Curtains open that they might be seen by the people They went down to our Ladies  Datocha  where  Te Deum  was sung and at night lay at  BuenRetiro  the next day a Comedy was acted and some  French  Musicians that followed the Queen prepared some  Opera's  The Dutchess  de Terra Nova  being resolved to take entirely from the Queen that little liberty that remained to her and desiring to continue sole Mistress of her Majesty's Will declared when she was arrived at  BuenRetiro  that no body of what quality or condition soever should see the Queen till after she had made her publick Entry This was a sorrowful state and a heavy restraint to the young Queen to find her self thus all on a sudden shut up from those persons that either might have afforded her some consolation or diversion or useful advice  She kept her in this solitary condition at  Retiro  without permitting her so much as to go out of her Apartment All the entertainment they regal'd her with was to see long fulsom tedious Comedies little of which they understood and the terrible  Camerara  was incessantly before her eyes with a severe affected air and never laught but was perpetually finding fault with something or other She was a professed enemy to all manner of pleasure and she treated her Mistress with as much Authority as a Governess would use towards a little Girl  The Marquess  de Villars  knew all that passed and was mightily concerned at it but it was not time as yet to speak of it He sent to the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  to know whether he might have leave to salute the Queen she answered him just as she did all the rest of the world that she was not to be seen till after the Entry was over This answer he looked upon to be so positive that not desirous to run the risque of meeting a second refusal he was sorced to acquiesce but the Queen being informed of what had happened by some of the French Women that still continued with her could not forbear to acquaint the King with it and obtained leave to see our Ambassador  de secreto  that is to say as a private person She immediately took care to inform him of it and the Marchioness  de Villars  imagining that she might likewise have the favour of the same priviledge sent to the  Camerara Major  to know whether she might be admitted to wait upon the Queen but she received the same answer that Monsieur the Ambassador had received from her before saying in a few words she had no order to let her in The Gentleman that discoursed the  matter with her still insisted that she had something of moment to say to her 'tis all one says the  Camerara  I'll never suffer any new customs to be introduced within these Walls  Her Majesty not knowing what had passed between the  Camerara  and the Ambassador's Lady charged her Confessor to tell her that she desired to see her and that she would extreamly oblige her by making her a visit But she was not in a capacity to obey the Orders she had received and the Confessor being informed what obstacles stood in the way very fairly gave the Queen an account of all She was not a little troubled at the ill services the Dutchess had done her and one may be able to judge by these few instances what an absolute power that old Lady assumed in the Queen's House and over the Queen's person The Queen Mother who came every day to  Retiro  observed an air of melancholy in the looks of the young Princess which sufficiently testified her disquietude within She easily apprehended that a person of her age could not chuse but be disgusted at the severity of the  Camerara  so she thought her self obliged to acquaint the King with it and desired him that he would be pleased to treat her after a more gentle method She succeeded in her Petition and procured leave for the Marchioness  de Villars  to go and wait upon the Queen who was introduced into her Apartment through that of the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  who appeared less savage and somewhat more respectful to her than she used to be The King according to the custom of  Spain  sate in a Chair of State the two Queens upon two low Stools and presently another was brought for the Ambassador's Lady Soon after the  Queen Mother going out along with the King she found her self alone with the Queen who seeing she was now at liberty to talk could not forbear to shed some Tears as she acquainted her with the sorrowful life she led After she somewhat eased her self by recounting to her the several ill usages that so much disturbed her the Ambassador's Lady did not fail to apply those consolations she judged expedient for one in her condition  She made her sensible that this life so full of constraint as it was and for which she expressed so great a reluctancy was yet the very same that all the Queens and Insanta's of  Spain  had ever been accustomed to that there was nothing particular in what she suffered and consequently was not designed to disoblige her that she ought to hope that when the King was better acquainted with her and saw he had an entire possession of her heart he might out of complaisance allow her some relaxations which hitherto her Predecessors had never enjoyed That since the Queen Mother loved her and cherished her interest as her own she could not do too much to cultivate that friendship which would be so advantageous and necessary to her that in the distribution of humane things the greatest happiness is always attended with some inconveniencies that she was now elevated to the supreamest Grandeur upon Earth which Heaven would have her purchase at the expence of a few mortifications but that her complaisance to the King and Queen Mother would soon deliver her out of them  She likewise told her several things which in the conduct she was to observe towards the rest of the Court might assist her to support the beginnings  and render what followed more agreeable to her  Madam  de Villars  spoke with a great deal of zeal of the Queen Mother but the young Queen being not as yet disingaged from those sentiments with which she had been lately possessed looked upon all this discourse as designed to mislead her and tho she ought to have considered that the Ambassadress could have no other views in what she told her than only to make her sensible of her own true interrests yet these advices did not at that time make those impressions upon her as one could have wished they had for her good Her prejudices to the Queen Mother which were perpetually inspired into her ballanced the confidence she had in Madam  de Villars  and her mind that was only accustom'd to be entertained with those agreeable things that use to employ persons of her youth her temper that was naturally free and lively dissipated the application she ought to have made in order to distinguish good counsels from bad She knew just enough to embarrass her and give her occasions of being uneasy but could not tell how to disintangle her self and for want of a steady resolution to free her self from these melancholy Ideas thought it too great a fatigue to solve these apparent contradictions So she continued under this uncertainty without being able to rescue her self from it and perhaps by this means lost a favourable juncture that then offer'd it self to deliver her from the Subjection under which the Dutchess kept her afterwards The Ambassador of  France  saw her sometimes whilst she continued at  Retiro  but this was before Company and besides the time they allotted him to be with her was so  short that in those general visits they could discourse of no particular affairs  The Queen Mother continued to visit the Queen often she desired her to dress herself after the French fashion because she never beheld her in that dress she did so and the Queen Mother liked it extremely well When she was returned to her Palace which is the House of the Duke  d'Uzeda  and is one of the finest in  Madrid  the Young Queen sent her two little Cabinets full of pretty curiosities she on the other hand procured her by way of exchange the diversion of going a hunting at  Pardo  She had not been on Horseback since she came to  Retiro  The King killed a wild Boar before her and after that day they went frequently to the Chase together  The Councils of the Inquisition of  Castile  of  Italy  of  Flanders  of  Arragon  of the  Indies  of War of the  Finances  of the Crusade and of the Orders went on New years day to wish a happy year to their Majesties for this is the Custom in  Spain  The Marquess  Sera  a  Genoese  offer'd to make the  Naples  Squadron consist of fourteen Gallies which was never more than seven and not put the King to any expence provided he would allow him the same conditions that the Duke  de Tursis  had at  Genoa  He had made this proposal to Don  Juan  some time before his death who found it to be very advantageous However their resolutions are so long a taking in  Spain  and they have so small a consideration for Novelties of whatsoever use they may prove that it is almost impossible to introduce one and this affair it seems met with the same fortune  The Marquess  de los Balbazez  took the Oath of fidelity for his place of Counsellor of State and Don  Manuel de Lira  did the same for that of Secretary of State in  Italy  The Duke  d'Ossone  still expected that they would accommodate the dispute between him and the Marquess  d'Astorgas  but seeing that they said nothing to him about it he took up a resolution to go no more to Court and appeared every day in the City with a great equipage This is often enough practised in  Spain  There are some people in the world that are never to be discountenanc'd by a repulse and Father  Vintimiglia  was of this number Altho' he had received no manner of answer to the Memorial he gave the Prince  d'Harcourt  at  Bayonna  to present to the Queen yet he could not forbear to draw up a second wherein he regulated all the Monarchy he intrusted a French Gentleman with it who promised to find out some means or other to give the Queen a sight of it But whether he show'd it her or not 'tis certain that  Vintimiglia  by an express Order of the King was banished out of all his Dominions He betook himself to the Ambassador of  France  and nothing more became of the matter  'Twas expected that immediately after the King's return some sort of Government would be established to settle affairs in their old course which had been intirely suspended ever since the Death of Don  Juan  Just as his Death happened every thing was making ready for the Journey which employ'd all the Court and the King in particular his Marriage might well enough detain him some time from making those applications he ought to use in the choice of an able Minister And the world was not at  all surprized to find him forget the concerns of the kingdom in general at a time when he was wholly possess'd with a Passion for his Queen and had his head full of those agreeable Idea's which all Lovers amuse themselves with But now when that business was over they impatiently expected to see him take up some fixed Resolutions The Queen Mother who was newly returned from her Exile thought of nothing else than how to preserve her self in the favourable Situation she in was in at present and no body in a manner was so interested with the King as to be able to pretend to the Ministry Thus the whole government was lodged in the hands of a Monarch who was but years old and who was never so well versed in things of lesser consequence as to have any just knowledge in greater Affairs  The only man that shared the Monarchy with him was Don  Jeronimo d'Eguya  who had been Secretary of State four years to which post he arrived from that of a simple Commissary His address together with his good fortune render'd him agreeable to the King who had followed no other Counsel than his unless  d'Eguya  who was fearful of giving it sometimes had not advised him to consult the Constable of  Castile  and the Duke  de Medina Celi  in certain affairs because he had no mind to answer for every thing himself It is indeed true that during the Journey nothing of importance was debated upon for they only busied themselves about that in particular and the Orders that are necessary to be given upon such occasions  The Court became now very full the King's marriage and the return of the Q Mother had brought together the most considerable persons  of the Kingdom Every Family was consulting about the measures that were to advance some particular man amongst them to the Chief Ministry Some wished their Relations had it others desired it for their Friends and abundance of people wished to enjoy it themselves Among those that had the justest pretensions were reckoned the Constable of  Castile  and the Duke  de Medina Celi  They were both of them furnished with great personal qualities were both of an illustrious birth and considerable fortune they possessed the chief Offices of the Crown were Counsellors of State and their merits equally distinguished them But nothing was more opposite than these two Lords were to one another An old Spirit of hatred which they were not able to suppress and which they had testified in a thousand Rencounters increased their common emulation their humors and inclinations were as contrary as night is to day Several of their common Friends had endeavoured to reconcile them but their pains were to no purpose They were all sensible that if they concerted matters together they would reciprocally render good Offices to one another which might serve to advance their Fortune This was one of the reasons they used to accomodate the matter between them but sometimes we meet with aversions that are never to be surmounted and this I have mentioned was of that number  The Duke  de Medina Celi  was years old his Humour sweet and good natur'd but too slow and careless in matters of moment of an insinuating agreeable Spirit He was descended of the illustrious Houses of  Castile  and  de Foix  he is seven times a Grandee of  Spain  His Wife  was Heiress of the House of  Arragon de Cardonne  she is very rich on her side as well as he is on his He was President of the Council of the  Indies    Sommellor du Corps  that is to say High Chamberlain he made his Court regularly and always testified a particular zeal for the person of the King and his Majesty as he never fails upon that point expressed a certain affection for him which he never show'd to any one besides This made the world believe that he stood fairer for the Ministry than all his Competitors  The Constable of  Castile  descended of the House  de Valasco  was years old and was Master of a considerable estate nevertheless he did not live easy amidst all his wealth he is the tenth Hereditary Constable of  Castile  Dean of the Council of State and Grand Master of the King's Houshold His Genius is vast his Abilities and Knowledge are surprizing and he was always concern'd in employments where he acquired experience The last of his Governments was that of  Flanders  and altho these posts ought to have made him sociable and familiar yet he always preserved so severe and rigid a character that it rendred him terrible access to him is very difficult and his humour is naturally so imperious that he can never submit And this is the reason why he was embroiled so deeply with Don  Juan  and hindring him from receiving several favours which that Prince would otherwise have willingly bestowed upon him to have brought him over to his own Party 'Tis true he declared himself very violently for the Queen Mother and this might be one of the principal causes that kept him from being of Don  Juan  's Faction  No body doubted but that the King respected him very much for what the Queen Mother might say in favour of him and the world was perswaded that among those persons whose merits she would recommend to the King the Constable would be the first who besides this would unquestionably find himself supported by all the party that had been ill treated by Don  Juan  and by all those that continued still in the Interests of the Queen Mother She was obliged for her own proper Interests to procure the Kings savour and the Favourite's place for the Constable But amidst all these flattering appearances he seemed to be very indifferent in the matter whether it were because the ill posture of affairs and the tender Age of the King made him apprehend some danger to be in the chief post or because he was sensible that he had not a prospect of obtaining it at one step and so was willing to ascend it by degrees He seem'd to desire that a Junto were established for the Government wherein he wou'd bear his share with the Inquisitor General and the Marquess  de Mansera  He sometimes told his Friends that the weight of great affairs astonished him and that he found it a harder matter to adjust them than those persons who behold them only at a distance can well imagine and that all his ambition was to contribute what in him lay to the erecting a Junto  The Queen Mother was not unwilling to have this project take effect because this was the way to keep the entire Authority in her own hands for the Council being composed of her creatures they would in all probability act according to her directions The Constable for his part secretly promised that by his conduct  and management he would always keep the upper hand over the other two and that thus his Companions would only enable him to bear the publick hatred in case any thing should meet with ill success  But this Junto that would lodge all the authority in the hands of three persons only destroyed at the same time the expectations of all those that would have it be divided amongst more out of a consideration of their own interest This party desired to have it full as numerous as it was during the Regency and would have it composed of the Cardinal  Portocarero  Archbishop of  Toledo  of Don  Melchior Navarra  who had been formerly ViceChancellor of  Arragon  of the Duke  de Medina Celi  and the other three whom I have mentioned  After so many different projects people were so well satisfied that the Council at last would be only composed of the QueenMother's Creatures that the alarm became general to those persons who had been devoted to Don  Juan  and were very apprehensive of the credit of the QueenMother and the advancement of the Constable Several of them assembled hereupon they beheld their ruine in the elevation of the contrary party and united themselves to the Duke  de Medina Celi  to find protection from him out of hopes of beholding him made Chief Minister They considered that it would be more advantageous to them to see one man made happy who was sure to befriend them than to see three happy persons depending upon one alone who had just reasons to wish them ill  The Duke  de Medina Celi  was of an equal and peaceable temper which rendred him agreeable to the King This good fortune which seem'd  particular to himself made him be looked upon by the greater part of the Courtiers as the only man that ought to pretend to this favour in a Court where the greatness of rank and birth is one of the most essential qualities to recommend a Chief Minister Those that penetrated into the true disposition of the King saw very well that in the midst of these different parties the Duke could not fail to get the better but whether it was an effect of his Prudence and Moderation or whether it was occasioned by the Intrigues of those persons that were on the contrary side he advanced but slowly It appears probable that the greatest part of his ambition came from his Friends and that he rather followed the advices they inspired into him than his own proper inclinations  I desire the same thing that you do would he say to them but in truth the tranquillity a man abandons to expose himself to all the murmurs of the people and to all publick inquietudes very much moderates the pleasure that is inseparable from so great a Post and unless it were for the service we hereby render to our Master I can't imagine how any man could find any satisfaction in a thing that draws so many hazards along with it  Thus people busied themselves about the two different factions that were formed by the Constable supported by the QueenMother and by the Duke  de Medina Celi  who was se  ended by all the Creatures of Don  Juan  But while these Rivals were openly disputing the Prize and all the Court seemed divided between them every one embracing a Party according to his own inclinations Don  Jeronimo d'Eguya  formed a third almost alone He saw himself all on the sudden made Secretary of  State when the Marquis  de Valenzuela  after the removal of F  Nitard  became the QueenMother's Favourite and took away that Office from Don  Pedro Fernandez del Campo  who did not behave himself supple and submissive enough to him so that we may say his haughtiness was the occasion of his Fall  Valenzuela  having no reason to be content with him obliged him to quit his Office and bestowed it upon  d'Eguya  He had too fresh an example before his eyes to fall into the same fault and being very adroit complaisant and well enough versed in dissimulation neglected nothing to please  Valenzuela  as long as he stood upon his feet but when he saw his Fortune declining and that the Court declared in favour of Don  Juan  he presently copied after them and presented himself during that Ministry by his exemplary Submission He was one of the first that espoused his party and was likewise one of the first that abandon'd the Prince when he saw his credit began to sink in the world Nay some time before the end of Don  Juan  he managed himself as he had done before  Valenzuela  's fall he entred into a correspondence with the QueenMother assuring her that he would only depend upon her so whether she was really perswaded of his sincerity or had not as yet a fit occasion to remove him from his Post she suffered him to continue in it without the least molestation  In all these Changes he only held his place by a Commission but as this furnished him with an occasion to see the King perpetually and to discourse him in private about all affairs so he made use of this opportunity to possess him with a distrust of all those that might with justice make pretensions to his savour nay even of the  most considerable Persons So that being only a simple Secretary of State by a Commission and in all appearance of a narrow unexperienced Genius he beheld himself in a capacity to ballance at one time two powerful Parties so that neither one nor the other could succeed in their affairs so long as he opposed them  Whatsoever Inclinations the King had for the Duke  de Medina Celi  Don  Jeronimo  frustrated them by awakening him with an Idea of Don  Juan  's Ministry  The Slavery he then suffered the Persecution of the QueenMother so many Persons of quality ill used without any occasion the Misery of the People and many other disorders that inevitably happen when the Government is abandoned to the Caprice of one man On the other hand he represented a Junto to him as a Company of Ministers that would command every body and everlastingly embarras their own affairs by their Jealousies and mutual Discords that it would be a burthen to himself as well as unprofitable to the State that Junto's might do some good under a Minority but that his Majesty was too far advanced in Age to want any Governors that suppose he were pleased to compose one vet the obligation he had to make the Constable one of the number would involve him in new difficulties that his temper was haughty and imperious in Authority and that he was wholly devoted to the QueenMother that she had been accustomed to govern and would easily come to be Mistress again by the help of a Junto composed of her own Creatures that since he was married and had Prudence and Wit sufficient he ought to manage himself and that if ever he was prevailed upon to do  otherwise he would find himself by little and little reduc'd to those sufferings from which he desir'd to free him  It is natural for a Young King to desire to be at large and independent so whilst he continued thus in suspence  Eguya  was Master of all affairs The Confessor possessed the King with the same sentiments to chuse no Chief Minister upon whom he must depend And the Dutchess  deTerra Nova  found herself equally concerned to keep off the Queen Mother a Junto and a Favourite During this Interregnum she had opportunity enough to fix and settle herself in the King's good opinion she did not question but if the Q Mother hapned to be once more Mistress she would endeavour either by herself or by her Creatures to turn her out of the Court this consideration obliged her to discourse frequently with the King and her only care was to perswade him that he ought to be apprehensive of the Queen Mothers designs She likewise inspired him with the same distrust of the Queen whose Youth and Easiness of Temper made her uncapable of taking strict measures She constantly whispered some disagreeable things or other into his Ear that only tended to disquiet him but he preserved so great a Love for his Queen that nothwithstanding he believed all the Stories this old Beldam told him he never had the less affection and tenderness for her  The Court continued still at  BuenRetiro  that is to say without  Madrid  expecting the Queen to make her Entry after which they were to go and lodge in the Palace the preparations for her Entry were very long it was commonly believed for some time that the Queen was with Child but all these hopes vanishing about the  beginning of  January  She made her Entry on the  th  of the same Month The Queen Mother went in the morning to  BuenRitiro  from whence she parted some time after along with the King they went together to see all the streets through which the Queen was to pass and stayed at the Countess  Dognates  in a Balcony made on purpose and having a Lattice Window gilt all over the Avenues that led to  Retiro  were all shut up and a prohibition was issued out for any Coach to go that way About eleven the Queen mounted on Horseback those that were to go before began to march and passed through a marble Gate which was but lately built The Kettle Drums and the Trumpets of the City in their Habits used in these Ceremonies marched at the head of all after them the Alcaldes of the Court the Nobility the Knights of the three Military Orders the Gentlemen of the King's house the Mayor domo's to the Queen and the Grandees of  Spain  followed by great number of Lacquays whose different Liveries of Brocard and Galloon of Gold and Silver of a mixt colour made an agreeable diversity the Querries of the Queen marched on foot immediately before her the Count  de Villa Mayana  was on her Right hand who was her Chief Gentleman Usher She was surrounded with her Menins and Pages of Honour when she walks on foot she always leans upon one of them the Dutchess  de Terra nova  followed her and Donna  Loura de Alargon  Governante of the Maids of Honour both of them mounted upon their Mules and in their Widdows habit which somewhat resembles that of Religious Women except that when they are on Horseback they wear great Hats on their Heads which made  no less terrible a figure than the rest of their garb But People saw after this with a great deal of pleasure Donna  Teresa de Toledo  Donna  Francisca Henriquez  Donna  Maria de Gusman    Josepha de Figueroa  and Donna  Manuela de Velasco  Maids of Honour to the Queen all very beautiful and richly drest they were on Horseback each of them was accompanied by their Relations in the midst of whom they marched There were several led Horses admirably fine led by Grooms clad in rich Liveries and the passage was shut up by the  Guards de la Lancilla  At the  Prado  which is one of the most agreeable walks in  Madrid  by reason of the several Fountains that water it continually was to be seen a Gallery open on every side with one and twenty Arches there were several jettings out in it on which the Arms of the several Kingdoms under the Dominion of  Spain  were affixed to Pillars that supported some gilt Statues which carried Devices in honour of the Queen with Crowns and Inscriptions that had a relation to the several Kingdoms The Queen found at the end of the Gallery a Triumphal Arch very magnificent and well design'd through which she entred into the City The Corrigidor and the Rigidors apparelled in Brocard of Gold of a red Crimson colour with Bonnets and Breeches such as the antient  Castilians  wore presented her with the Keys of the City and with a Canopy which they carried over her head during the procession The Streets were adorned with the richest Tapestries and the precious Stones that were to be seen in the Goldsmiths Row were valued at Eleven Millions It would take up too much time to describe all the magnificences of that day I shall only content my self to say that the Queen  was mounted upon a fine  Andaluzian  Horse which in this noble march seemed proud to carry so beautiful and great a Princess Her Habit was so covered with Embroidery that the Stuff was not to be seen she wore on her Hat white Plumes mixt with red and a Pearl called there the  Peregrina  which is as big as a small Catherine Pear and is of an inestimable value hung below a Clasp of Diamonds with which her Hat was beset She wore on her finger the great Diamond of the King which as they pretend surpasses in beauty any thing of that nature that was ever set in a Ring But the graceful deportment of the Queen in all her actions and particularly in the management of her Horse and the charms of her person made a greater lustre than all the pretious Stones she wore altho it is certain that people could scarce behold the glittering of them She made an halt before the Balcony of the Countess  Dognate  to salute the King and Queen Mother they opened the Lattice about broad fingers to see her and the K taking his Handerchief in his hand carried it several times to his Mouth his Eyes and his Heart which is the greatest piece of Gallantry in  Spain  She went on her Procession and the King with the Queen Mother received her in the Court of the Pailace he helped her to light off her Horse and the other taking her by the hand conducted her to her Apartment where she embraced her often telling her that she was ever happy to have so amiable a Daughter in Law That Evening there were  rious Fireworks and Illuminations for three nights together the King next day went to the Royal Chappel where the Queen was likewise in her Chair of State the Ambassadors  and Grandees were there according to the Custom and  Te Deum  was sung After dinner the King and Queen went out together which was the first time of their appearing in publick They were in a Chariot made like a Tiumphal Coach without a Crown upon it and open on all sides to shew themselves to the People they traversed the great Square before the Palace and passed through several Streets where the Balconies were full of Ladies who mingled their Acclamations with those of the people the Grandees followed their Majesties in very rich Coaches with a great number of Livery men There were abundance of these Lords who for nine days together had nine different Liveries and each finer than the other after this manner they went to our Ladies  Datocha  and it being already night before they returned to the Palace white wax Tapers were lighted at all the Windows and the Streets were so prettily illuminated by them that a man might almost see from one end of the City to the other The finest show of these Lights was at the  Placa Mayor  which is a very large noble Square the Houses are built with five Rows of Balconies one over another and could reckon above three Thousand Tapers in all As soon as the King and Queen were arrived there the Fireworks began Many other diversions lasted for several days sometimes their Majesties went a hunting at other times to a Comedy or took a Walk Sometimes they went to Sup with the Queen Mother or the Queen Mother came to eat with them at the Palace All the Ladies had the Honour to kiss the Queen's Hand the Councils and the Grandees complemented her also  Some days after her Entry a Bullfeast was kept at  Madrid  which was the most magnificent of the kind that had been seen for a long time The King and the Queen came to the Great Square about one a Clock in the Afternoon afterwards entred the Duke  de Medina Sidonia  the Marquess  Camaraza  Grandees of  Spain  Don  Felix de Cordova  Second Son of the Duke  de Sessa  Don  Francisco Moscoso  and Don  Fernando de Lea  a Gentleman of  Cordova  each of them followed by an hundred Lacqueys some dressed after the  Turkish  others ofter the  Grecian  fashion and after this manner they represented several Nations They combated the Bulls with extraordinary dexterity and courage the Son of the Duke  de Sessa  had two Horses killed under him This sport is an old remainder of the  Moors  whose Genius and Customs are not intirely extinguished in  Spain  altho they themselves have been long turned out of it The  Spaniards  still seem to preserve something of the barbarity of those people since they do so freely expose themselves to the rage of Mad Bulls to divert the Publick But to say the truth this representation is one of the finest things in the world and nothing can afford so agreeable a prospect as the place of the Combat which is prodigiously spacious encompassed with five ranks of Balconies all equal and regular and curiously set out with rich hangings and Furniture as well as filled with almost an infinite number of Spectators  The King on the eighteenth of  January  named the Marquess  d'Ossera  to go ViceRoy  per interim  of  Sardinia  because the Count  d'Egmon  was not as yet in a condition to go thither He named the same day the Marquess  de Fuentes    Son to him who had been Ambassador in  France  to go thither in that quality in the room of the Duke  de Giovenazzo  who from an Envoy to the Court of  Savoy  was nominated to that of  France  but it seems was at last destined to return to  Turin  In the mean time the Marquess  de Villa Mayna  Chief Gentleman Usher to the Queen discharged the Office of Master of the Horse in the place of the Duke  d'Ossone  who for his ill conduct was prohibited to come to the Palace The Marquess  d'Astorgas  took the advantage of his absence to make his own Court and altho he had been indisposed and continued to be so still yet he went every day with five Coaches of extraordinary fineness and a numerous retinue of Liverymen to wait upon the King The Duke  d'Ossone  being informed of it resolved to meet him and give him some affront so he took abundance of people with him and knowing which way the Marquess was to pass he ordered his Coachman to drive thither full speed and to overturn the Marquess's Coach in case he was within It happened he went that day in a Chair and his Coaches followed him but the Duke  d'Ossone  's Coachman for all that met with him so conveniently that he threw him along in the River This rencounter made a great noise and did not at all accommodate the affairs of the Duke which before this were in no good condition  Madam the Constable  Colonna  's Lady who went out of the Convent where she sojourned to behold the Queens Entry staid with the Marchioness  de los Balbazez  till the fifth of  February  when she was carried away by the King's Order to a Convent some leagues off  Madrid  'Tis the Custom of  Spain  that upon all solemn occasions whether of Joy or Grief all the Kingdoms and all the Principalities that depend upon the King send their Deputies to complement him Thus Don  Pedro de Salinas y Unda  came in the name of the Principality of  d'Avila  accompanied with the Duke  de Pastrane  and Don  Joseph de Silva  his Brother to kiss the King's hand and complement him upon the score of his marriage The Kingdoms of  Naples    Navar    Arragon    Granada  and divers other places sent likewise After the King had given them Audience he took the Queen along with him to a great hunting of the Wild Boar where they killed abundance of them The Duke  de Pastrane  who exercised the Office of Chief Ranger in the absence of the Marquess  de Liche  conducted the Queen to a place in the Forrest that was extreamly pleasant Several streams of water ran by the place and under some of the highest Trees a Pavilion of Gold Brocard adorned with a Fringe of the same was set up All the Trees were covered with little Apes Squirrels and Parrots and a thousand other Birds that were fastned to them young Boys that were drest like Fauns and Silvanes and Girls apparelled like Nymphs and Driades and Sphepherdesses served up a noble Collation to her Majesty who seemed to be at first extreamly pleased with the entertainment But altho no body knew what it was that disquieted her afterwards she appear'd to be very sad all the remainder of the day  On  Candlemas day  there was a procession in the Galleries of the Palace the Religious of the  Mendicant Orders  and all the Ecclesiasticks belonging to the Chappel walked before the Pages of the King and those of the Queen followed  after The Grandees of  Spain  marched before their Majesties the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  held up the Queens Train the Maids of Honour came next and there did not seem to be above eighteen or twenty of them 'Tis not here as in other Holidays where they all wait upon their Soveraign  Tho the young Queen changed her place of abode yet she did not change that solitary and disagreeable life she led at  Buen Retiro  under the guard of the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  She governed her like a Child and continued still to treat her after a worse manner unless it were that she was permitted to receive the visits of some Ladies which oftentimes appeared more tedious to her than even solitude it self not that they wanted wit for no body can reproach them with want of that But the Queen understood but a little of what they said and besides could not repose that confidence in them which gives liberty and life and spirit to Conversation all was Grandeur and Ceremony and Reverence and State Much about this time I had the honour to kiss her hand but she could not forbear smiling to see me so much altered for the worse by my  Spanish  Garb for unless her self alone I never saw a Stranger look well in that Habit After I had passed through her Apartments which to say the truth were exceeding pretty I found her in her Closet which was painted and gilded and set out with great Looking Glasses fastned to the ceiling she sate upon a little square Stool near the Window making Gold Net Work mingled with Blew Silk her Hair was parted in the middle of her Head which was bare only one knot of her Hair was curled and plaited with great  Pearls and reached down to her Waste she had a Velvet Robe on of a Rose Colour Embroidered with Silver and had Pendants in her Ears that touched her very Breast and so heavy that she gave her self the trouble to takeout one of them that I might pass my judgment on it and I was exceedingly surprized at it She spoke very little  French  to me affecting to talk  Spanish  before the  Camarera Major  She ordered me to send her all the Letters I received from  France  which had any news in them to which I replied that the news which was sent to me did not deserve the consideration of so great a Queen Ah good God cryed she lifting up her Eyes with a charming air I shall never think meanly of any thing that comes out of a Country which is so dear to me This affection said I to her which your Majesty preserves for your own Native Country makes me hope every thing Madam since as I have the happiness to be one so I have all the inclinations of a good  French  Woman She answered this with her usual goodness and whispered me in  French  that she would rather see me apparalled after the  French  fashion than that of  Spain  But Madam said I to her 'tis a sacrifice which I have made to the respect I have for your Majesty Say rather continued she with a smiling air that the rigid temper of the Dutchess has frightned you She appeared to me so very charming that day that I could not forbear to admire her for in spight of her melancholy she was plump and in good liking and that contributed to make her still more beautiful and agreeable  When I came back to my lodgings I found my Letters from  France  were arrived there was one amongst the rest which I supposed would  please the Queen so I made all the haste I could the next morning to carry it to her but the  Camarera  would not suffer me to have the honour of seeing the Queen two days together therefore I was contented to write to the Dutchess desiring her to present that Letter to the Queen Behold the Contents of it  I Am of opinion Madam that I cannot send you better news to day than that of the marriage of Mademoiselle  de Blois  with Monsieur the Prince  de Conty  The Contract of the Marriage was signed on the fifteenth of this month in the King's Chamber who went about seven a Clock at Night to the Queens Apartment and afterwards returned to his own with all the Royal Family The Prince  de Conty  led Mademoiselle  de Blois  she was set out with the finest Jewels in the world all which together did not glitter so brightly as her Eyes and whose lustre was inferiour to the Lillies and Roses of her Complexion All the Court was in a transport as soon as she appeared and the majesty of her stature was not a little increased by a Train five Ells long which Mademoiselle  de Nante  carried The King drew near to a Table that stood against the Wall the Queen was on his left hand and next after Monseignear Monsieur Madam Mademoiselle  d'Orleans  Madam the Dutchess of  Tuscany  Madam  de Guise  Monsieur the Prince and Monsieur the Duke and Madam the Dutchess the Prince de la Roche  SurYon  Mademoiselle  de Bourbon  the Princess  de Carignan  the Count  de Vermandois  the Count  du Maine  Mademoiselle  de Nante  and Mademoiselle  de Tours  all placed in a Demicircle about the Table The Prince  de Conty  and Mademoiselle  de Blois  came one after the other within the Demicircle over against the Table The Marquess  de Seignelay  drew near to the King and read the beginning of the Contract with a loud voice but he had scarce read the qualifications when the King told him 'twas enough and so signed the Contract After all the Royal Family had signed it the Cardinal  de Bouillon  entred and advanced forward to the middle of the Chamber then the Prince  de Conty  and Mademoiselle  de Blois  approached up to him and performed the Ceremony of the Betrothing The Princess's Name as you know is  Anna Maria  and the Prince's  Louis Armand  This Ceremony being over the King and all the Court went to see an  Opera  Next day the Cardinal  de Bouillon  married this young Prince and beautiful Princess in the Chappel of the Old Castle in the presence of the King the Queen and all the Court the King dined with all the Royal Family at night a Comedy was acted and after that there was a great Supper where without reckoning the Princes and Princesses of the Blood there were fifty Ladies that sate at one Table which was served with three services of two hundred dishes each The Cardinal  Bouillon  blessed the Bed the King gave the Shift to the Prince of  Conty  and the Queen to the Princess Next morning their Majesties went to see her at her Apartment in the New Castle The King has given her the Dutchy  de Vaujour  a Million of mony in hand a Pension of a hundred thousand Livers and abundance of Jewels to the Prince  de Conty  fifty thousand Crowns in hand and a Pension of twenty thousand to the Prince  de la Roche SurYon  From St  Germains  the th of  Jan    The Queen Mother had given all imaginable assistance to the Queen of  Spain  to deliver her from part of her troubles if she could have cured  her self of those suspicions with which some people had possest her against her but she unhappily imagining that the other still regretted the ArchDutchess and would have been glad to see her in her place that opinion made her extreamly distrustful and the Queen Mother who found nothing of that openness of heart and freedom as she desired was likewise troubled for her part for in effect she loved her tenderly and was ready to give her all possible testimonies of her affection  The Ambassador of  France  his Lady and the Confessor often reminded the Queen of that conduct she was to observe if she intended to be happy  They told her that she ought to give her self intirely up to the Queen her Mother in Law out of a principle of Duty and Gratitude for the friendship she showed her as out of a consideration of her own proper interests they represented to her that the Queen Mother ought not to be suspected by her and that altho the ArchDutchess was her Grand Daughter yet she had received such few tokens and assurances of friendship from the Emperour during her disgrace that she was too sensible ever to forget it that the Conduct of  France  towards her was directly opposite to this that there she had been pitied and obliged that her Most Christian Majesty had over preserved a strict correspondence and friendship with her and that the Queen Mother knew well enough that she could not by any returns oblige the Queen of  France  more than by showing back all that kindness to the young Queen of  Spain  that she had all the agreements in her which could engage her heart that besides this she hoped to see her give an  Heir to the Crown that this was necessary for the good of  Spain  that the melancholy humour to which she abandoned her self might hinder her from having one that they ought to concert all their affairs together in order to possess the good graces and inclinations of the King that it was natural to believe he would divide his power between his Mother and his Queen rather than bestow it upon a Favourite who would think of serving him no longer than his Family reaped advantage by it whereas the Souls of Sovereigns having something in them that was more noble and great than those of private persons the motives of Interest would never be supposed to influence two Queens so much as they would a Chief Minister that in fine there ought to be no separation between them but that they must begin with the union of their hearts  The Queen relished these reasons and found them plausible enough but for all that she relapsed all on a sudden into her old distrust into which the different things that had been said to her did cast her anew Besides the extream trouble she suffered from the rigid conduct of the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  she found her so absolute and inflexible that she began to fear her to which the tenderness of her youth her want of experience and her natural sweetness contributed not a little so that she could not open her self to the QueenMother when she considered that if she did not really love her but would make invidious reflections upon what she said this would be the way to throw her into new inconveniencies so that notwithstanding the desire she had to speak to her she was always  silent in her company The QueenMother perceived it well enough yet for all that she continued to visit her almost every day and sent her presents from time to time  At last the young Queen being entirely vanquished by all these demonstrations of amity resolved to submit her self wholly to her directions They had a long conference together where they took those measures which they judged were necessary to promote their common satisfaction After this the Queen Mother spoke to the King but found him in a cold reserved humour so she made him no discoveries of any thing but took her opportunity to withdraw imagining with her self that her Son would be obliged to come after her and that the world might take less notice of this alteration she gave out that she only desired to live easy and that she preferred her own repose to all other considerations whatsoever She talked after this rate before several persons in whom she reposed no ordinary confidence altho at the bottom she was clearly of a different opinion  The Constable was the first man that was aware of this alteration and was one of those who were mightily troubled at it He easily saw that the Queen Mother was leaving all thoughts of advancing him and as he had his own particular views so he used all the means in the world to effect his designs In fine he joined interests with the  Camarera major  Don  Jeronimo d'Eguya  and the King's Confessor who brought the Duke of  Alva  into the same confederacy the design of these three last was to set up the Constable against the Duke  de Medina Celi  whose favour with the King increased as they thought very fast and this gave them violent  jealousies of him The Constable for his part endeavoured to gain by them what they designed to make the Duke  de Medina Celi  lose his Emissaries began to promote the affair with very favourable appearances but after they had seriously reflected upon the imperious humour of the Constable  He is so arrogant and haughty said they that he would rather ruin every man of us than ever be brought to own that he was obliged to us for his e  evation and whatever Minister has his place will certainly be less dangerous than he  Don  Jeronimo d'Eguya  who thought of nothing else but how to ballance the credit  these two Lords one with the other did not ne  ect their reflections He mentioned them almost every day and endeavoured to make them more strong if it were possible he  ound it would be a great deal more advantageous to him to continue in the same condition than to see himself subjected to a new dependance and this reason obliged him to inspire the King with an aversion and jealousie for the Constable so that instead of doing him any service as he promised he did him underhand all the ill offices imaginable  When our own particular interest lies at stake and we are pursuing the dictates of our ambition we are so clearsighted that it is a difficult matter for any one to deceive us long We penetrate even into the most secret thoughts of him that calls himself our friend and easily find out whether he doth us good or ill Pursuant to this maxim the Constable soon perceived how well he was served by his friends and what designs each of them drove in particular It is no difficult matter to imagine how a person  of his temper as I have already described resented this usage and his uneasiness to be su  e was so much the more violent because he smother'd it for some time before he let it break out  Don  Jeronimo de Eguya  was the first person whom he attacked Having represented to them one day in a full Council and that with the greatest fierceness in the world how all affairs went from bad to worse he added that no body ought to be surprized to find it so since  d'Eguya  who pretended to manage every thing had neither Judgment nor Experience nor Capacity and that he ought to be confined to the Duties of his Post without medling with those things that had no relation at all to it When he had ended his discourse Don  Manuel de Lira  Secretary of State of the Council of  Italy  who was of the Constable's Faction presented to them at the same time a large memorial in which he laid open the vast prejudice which the State of Affairs received from the ill conduct of  de Eguya  and most of them there had been well enough satisfied if these complaints had obliged the King to remove him  Don  Manuel de Lira  did not act only out of Complaisance to the Constable but had his own private ends He imagined that if  d'Eguya  were once turned out of his Post he might perhaps succeed him in it Now nothing animates a man's zeal in any affair more than the prospect of some advantage or other to be gained by it However this same business did not meet with that success which he and the Constable proposed to themselves so after long consideration the Constable was obliged to come back to the Queen Mother and importune her to appear in  favour of him He represented to her  That if the chief Minister was not one of her party her repose would not be of long continuance that the Duke  de Medina Celi  stood very fair for it and altho he advanced insensibly yet it was probable he would soon find himself possessed of a place where he would make his Enemies severely feel the weight of his Indignation that in spight of Politicks to which he pretended he would not fail to set up the President of  Castile  against her who was a Creature of Don  Juan  and always ready to execute those resentments that had lodged in his breast so long that this Duke was the very person who formerly had the hardiness to carry her the Order for her Exile that he seem'd at that time to rejoyce at her misfortunes and perplexities that if ever he came to be Favourite she would find him to be a constant rub in her way and that this conjecture perhaps was not ill grounded since the Duke still possessed all the passions of Don  Juan  The Queen Mother was alarmed at what the Constable represented to her and gave him her word to act vigorously in his behalf but the Duke  de Medina Celi  being advertised of it was resolved to prevent the blow and judged it the best expedient to soften the Spirit of the Queen Mother by making a profound Submission to her In fine he went to her and told her  That he was resolved to be oblig'd to her for all the King's favours and desired to depend upon her out of an obligation of Gratitude as he had done a long time ago out of Duty and Inclination that he humbly begged of her to do him the justice as to believe that his Heart his Birth and his Fortune were too  great ever to suffer him to be one of Don  Juan  's Creatures that he would never receive that title but from his own Master and that the Party must wear a Crown who commanded the Duke  de Medina Celi  that altho he had declared himself for the President of  Castile  yet it was not out of a Consideration of Don  Juan  but the King's Service and he was ready to abandon his Interest at any time having no particular engagements of Friendship to him and that if he appeared in this affair it was only done with a design to defend the Authority of the King which the Nuncio had a mind to invade in the conduct which he used towards the President  The Queen Mother answered him that she did not without a great satisfaction believe what he said to be true that she had a great esteem for him and would not fail to give him convincing proofs of it in a short time  The Constable being informed on his side that Queen Mother had very favourably received the Submission of the Duke whether out of a Spirit of kindness or indifference to the choice the King might make of a Chief Minister dispaired at last of seeing himself succeed in any of his projects either of the Junto whereof he pretended to be a Member it one were erected or in the place of Favourite which he could have desired rather to fill alone He resolved to merit something at least of the Duke  de Medina Celi  by yielding up that Post with a good grace when he was in a capacity to dispute it with him still  In short he laid hold of the first opportunity he could find to tell the King that no Person was fitter to serve his Majesty and preserve  the Government in good order than the Duke  de Medina Celi  He bestowed wonderful commendations upon him for the good conduct he had ever used The free unconstrained manner wherein he spoke all this was exceeding remarkable especially in a man of the Constables haughty Temper who as the world imagined would dye a thousand times rather than offer this violence inwardly to himself But people at last believed that he design'd to render himself agreeable to the King by commending a man for whom his Majesty testified so great an Inclination After all it must be confessed that he showed a generosity which is not common in treating his declared Enemy after this manner  It cannot be easily imagin'd what a great detriment the Republick received by these Factions of the Courtiers and the King's Irresolution to take or not to take a Chief Minister Nothing was concluded nothing was done a Spirit of Lethargy seemed to be predominant at Court which helped to increase those perplexities under which the Kingdom laboured before Every body languished to see what would be the success of the smallest matters and business that had been carried into the Council tarried there whole years nay things that went directly into the King's hands were dispatched never the sooner Thus no one knew what Party to take or where to address himself  Our Ambassador who promised himself to find a better treatment than he had met with a long while and which he dexterously dissembled in expectation of the Queen's arrival perceived at last that they designed to satisfie him no  better than the other Ministers who made their Complaints Above five Months were passed since he demanded Justice for some violations of the Peace that were lately committed as well by the Governors of the Provinces as by the taking of several Vessels and the burning of others But at the time when he was urgent to have a positive answer he received a new injury by the insolence of an  Who is a kind of a Provost or Judge  Alcade and several  These are Serjeants and Bayliffs  Alguazils who passed before his House which was never done at  Madrid  in the quarter belonging to an Ambassador He was extreamly surprized at it but was so far from receiving the satisfaction that was due to him for this affront that they told him his Majesty had given Order that his quarter should be no longer exempt This Resolution so much the more disgusted him because it affected only himself and all the other Ambassadors enjoyed their Priviledges as formerly Not but that they had several other complaints upon their Hands as for example the Envoy from the Elector of  Brandenburgh  made a great noise because they had amused him a long time with specious promises that had no effect at all they ow'd his Master a great Sum of Money he demanded the payment of it but they shifted him off from time to time so that at last he perceived that they neither had the power nor inclination to satisfie him The Nuncio did not seem to be less disgusted for his part because he saw the President of  Castile  keep his Place and continue still in Favour altho  the Pope had declared him suspended and he himself omitted no application to have justice done upon him  In the mean time they wanted mony to raise four  Spanish  Regiments that were designed to be sent to  Milain  because they apprehended some motion from the Court of  France  but it was almost impossible to find any funds and besides this the Silver that came from the  Indies  in the  Flota  was so suddenly gone and with so little order that no body knew what was become of it so that it was a difficult matter to send any returns into  Flanders  or other places where there was occasion Those that used to advance mony upon these sorts of occasions would now do nothing at all they were all of them drained and the necessities were generally so great that they knew not where to take up mony to defray the ordinary expences of the King and Queens House This proceeded in part from the disorder of the mony a Pistole which ought to go for no more than fourty eight  Reals de Vellon  was raised up to a hundred and ten and the Patacoons that are only worth twelve  Reals  went at the rate of thirty The occasion of it was this a great part of the  Reals de Vellon  that are of Copper were bad and the common custom made them pass as well in commerce as if they had been good But at last they were called in all on the sudden by reason of the excessive price a Pistole was raised to and 'tis impossible to recount the disorders and inconveniences that attended this new Regulation The Court was of opinion in the month of  Februrary  that there was a necessity to find out some remedy or other  suddenly for it so a Pistole from a hundred and ten  Reals  was levelled to fourty eight the Patacoons to twelve and the other mony was so confounded one with the other that it was reduced to the eighth part of the ordinary value There was no body almost but lost more or less upon the account of this new Regulation and accordingly felt it that which before the sinking the value of the mony was worth fourty  Reals  which make four Livers of  French  mony since the reducing of it was worth a hundred and ten  Reals  which is ten Livers of our mony so that what Commodities a man could buy on  Monday  for fifty Sous went on the  Tuesday  for above a third part more and the Debtor who it may be on  Saturday  owed twenty thousand  Reals de Vellon  which made but two hundred Pistoles found to his sorrow the next day after that he owed near five hundred Pistoles This ruined a great number of Families and caused a mighty dejection in the spirits of the people for every thing a man has occasion to buy is dearer by much in  Madrid  than any where else because they are brought a great way off and there are few or no Manufactures at all in that part of the Country A kind of a mutiny happened at  Toledo  because after this sinking the value of mony no care was taken to regulate the price of Provisions for which they paid excessive rates It is still to be noted that the Civil Government in  Spain  is managed but after a very sorry manner and that the slow lazy humour of those persons who might if they pleased correct the ill conduct of others contributes exceedingly to the publick loss  All these disorders and continual complaints which made a noise from all quarters began at last to shake and undermine Don  Jeronimo d'Eguya  He knew very well that the Post wherein he stood was ticklish and dangerous and that after all his endeavours to disgust the world in case he remedied nothing the oblige maledictions and hatred would fall upon the Favourite The present ill state of affairs was attributed to his ill conduct so he thought within himself that he could not too soon deliver himself from the torrent of the popular fury and therefore resolved to omit nothing whereby he might incline the King to choose a Chief Minister The consideration of his own interest soon determined him to act vigorously in favour of the Duke  de Medina Celi  he knew the King had a particular affection for him and besides he perswaded himself that when the Duke was informed what good offices he had done him he would maintain him still in his Post as well out of a principle of acknowledgment as for the great services he might do him in these affairs since he had managed them for so long a time and consequently was in a capacity to furnish him with some necessary lights which all those persons that newly enter into the Government are altogether unacquainted with And then he knew the natural sweetness of the Duke's temper would never permit him to turn him out of his place and he was certain that as long as he continued in it he could manage the King's favour the functions of his place giving him opportunity to approach near the King's person very often  The  Camarera Major  and his Majesty's Confessor had each of them particular designs in their  head however they were both agreed as to the Duke's advancement so that all the world concurring with the favourable dispositions which the King had for him he signed a Decree that is the usual term with them in  Spain  wherein he declared the Duke  de Medina Celi  to be Chief Minister He immediately commanded Father  Relux  to carry it him who came to his House about ten a Clock at night on the twenty first of  February  and acquainted him with the good news  No body had any reason to be surprized at the Duke's elevation It seems he had promised himself the Place some time before whether it were because the King gave him his promise or that some outward appearances assured him of it  However it was it was agreed upon by all hands at Court that the King could not have made a better choice He was a Person in whom all good qualities were to be found his agreeable Conversation his obliging Character his noble and generous Deportment his free easie Temper made him beloved by all the world People only wondred that being so great a Lord as he was he would sacrifice his repose to the Administration of Affairs that were then in a miserable condition They could scarce imagine and perhaps he was of the same opinion himself how he could ever be able to remedy evils of so inveterate a malignity Before he could effect this he must in all appearance make an intire Change in the ordering of the Monarchy but this was an impracticable design and impossible to be executed  As soon as the Choice his Majesty had made in favour of the Duke came to be publickly known all Persons that were of any Quality went to complement him as well the Ministers of foreign Princes as the Grandees of  Spain  The next day being accompanied by all his Friends and Relations he repaired to Court to kiss his Majesty's hand and thank him most humbly for all his great favours On the following days he received visits in his Bed pretending a slight indisposition to exempt himself from the fatigue of Ceremonies His Apartment and Furniture were extreamly magnificent but it is an odd sight to see a  Spaniard  in his Bed of State because they wear no MorningGowns here but only their  Golilia  and black Cloaks and have their Hats on or else are bareheaded for the Men as well as the Women wear no Caps He had enjoyed the place of  Sumiller de Corps    i e  LordChamberlian for a long time and in this Quality he was the only Person that commanded in the King's Chamber and lay there  He did not delay to give publick Audience in the Hall which they call the  Rubis  and is the place where the Council of State uses to assemble 'tis under the King's Apartment Here it was that the Duke received the visit of the Nuncio and the  Venetian  Ambassador they did not seem to be pleased at the manner wherein the Chairs were disposed because it could not absolutely be determined whether either of them or he had the Chief Place of Honour Besides this he only reconducted them to the middle of the Hall of Audience They acquainted the Marquess  de Villars  with it who told them that he had designed  to make that visit along with them because the Ambassadors of the Chappel generally acquit themselves of these sorts of devoirs together but that he was not displeased with himself for not being there since he was resolved to take direction by the fault they had committed and that he would not neglect as they did to use all necessary precautions about the Step Place and Rank and would be assured both of the one and the other before he performed that Ceremony In short he sent to the Duke to know whether he would not receive him as Don  Louis de Haro  used to receive the Ambassadors of  France  he immediately agreed to it and that there might be no mistakes committed the places were marked out and every thing was adjusted before the day of Audience The other Ambassadors were concerned at the oversight they had committed and by this visit of our Ambassador regulated those they continued to make to the Chief Minister  The Count  de Monterey  kissed the King's hand and the Queen's he complemented them from the part of the City of St  Jago de Compostella  the Marquess  d'Astorgas  did the same from the City of  Avila  About this time Don  Francisco d'Agourto  was nominated by the King to be Master of the CampGeneral of the Cavalry The Envoy extraordinary from  England  surprized all the Court by the strict Prohibition he gave his Domesticks not to suffer any Ecclesiasticks or Religious to come within his doors  The young Queen was so taken up with the diversions of the Carnaval that she had scarce opportunity to perceive that this was a  set time of mirth and jollity Her best days were spent in hunting with the King and the three last days of the Carnaval there was a Comedy represented upon the Theatre at  BuenRetiro  which is a wellcontrived Building The King and the Queen saw it on the  Sunday  the next day it was acted before the several Councils and on  Tuesday  before the Officers of the City The Queen being informed that the Dutchess  de Bejar  and the Marchioness  de Castel Rodrigo  who had never bore any Children before were each of them delivered of a Son begged leave of the King to send them word that she wished them joy  I agree to it says the King smiling on condition that within nine months they will come in their turn to perform the same complement to you  All  Spain  impatiently expected to see what Remedies the new Ministers would apply to those disorders that seemed for a long time to be radicated in the Monarchy but whatever good intentions he had to rectifie them he found it a difficult matter to put them in execution The King's Treasury was exhausted several private Families ruined the price of all Commodities excessive high and these Perplexities were heightned by the connivance of the Magistrates and the length of time During the Ministry of Don  Juan  nothing had been set in order and since his death one would have thought they had affected to abandon all manner of business  To this we may add that the Duke  de Medina Celi  had never been in any employ where he might learn that experience which is so necessary for Government He was born  and bred in the Genius of  Madrid  which is so supine and careless that nothing almost is determined there Nay what is more he suffered the Master of the Council to deliberate about the Publick Affairs after the same manner as he did before his Ministry and submitted to take his Counsel he likewise erected  Junta's  to debate of those things which he supposed to carry any great difficulty with them  He erected one amongst the rest to which he nominated the Constable the Admiral and the Marquss  d'Astorgas  all which three were Councellors of State he also admitted three Divines whereof the King's Confessor was one and three Councellors of the King's Council to examine along with him the Affair of the President of  Castile  about which the Nuncio made so great a noise The occasion of this Dispute was this Monsieur  Mellini  the Nuncio had a mind to preside over a Chapter of Religious whom they call  Clericos Minores  who were going to choose a Provincial The President desired that one of his Friends might be named now he kew that the Nuncio had a kindness for another so he went the shortest way to work and obtained a Decree of the King which forbad him to preside in that Assembly and because he did not exactly obey it he was fined a thousand Crowns  The Nuncio suffered this strange treatment with indignation enough and complained of it to the Pope His Holiness writ to the King about it and Don  Juan  promised him to get the Fine revoked but the many disorders that happened after his death hindred  the execution of it The King thought the business was laid asleep because he writ a very submissive Letter to the Pope about it but for all that the Nuncio who was not to be appeased by a Letter renewed the Quarrel after the Prince's death He saw that the King had not as yet pitched upon a Chief Minister and judged that the President of  Castile  was not well supported he knew he had abundance of Enemies and that amongst the rest the QueenMother was the most inveterate against him All these considerations served to perswade him that he should obtain an intire satisfaction without any trouble  He pretended therefore that he ought to lose his Place and to go to  Rome  to have the Suspension taken off which he had incurred in the year The Court absolutely refused to grant him what he demanded upon this he complained very highly to the King telling him that he ill performed what he had promised the Pope in his Letter  The Duke  de Medina Celi  being advanced to the Ministry was willing to examine the Reasons of the Nuncio and those of the President by the  Junta  'Twas alledged in favour of the last that being a native of  Spain  the King could not abandon him to the Pope's resentments if at the bottom he did not deserve it that it was true indeed he had done irregular things upon several occasions but then his Place was of that nature that he could not forfeit it unless it were for Reasons of the greatest importance The Chief Minister declared that he should keep his Place of being President of the Council of the  Indies  and  that Don  Vincente Gonzaga  should perform all his Functions He received with extraordinary satisfaction the offer which the Admiral of  Castile  made to resign the Office of Master of the Horse to him which is generally possest by the Favourite but would not accept of it  He gave order to Don  Gabriel Quinones  Secretary of the Council of War to bring in his Accounts out of hopes of drawing some Money from thence and indeed the State was never in such extremity of want as now for since the publishing of the King's Declaration for sinking the value of Money all Commerce was intirely stopt the Shops continued shut up and the People groaned under the greatest Necessities imaginable The Duke used all his Power to remedy these pressing Grievances he designed to coin new Money and lessen the Price of all Commodities but the effect of his good Intentions was long delayed and the publick Misery increased more and more every day  Hereupon a Man of great business whose name was  Marcos Dias  presented a Memorial to the Duke wherein he proposed a Method to raise the King's Revenue and yet ease the People he offered to prove that the Magistrates of the City of  Madrid  under pretence of reimbursing themselves of the Money they had lent the late King had raised considerable Summs and had never given any account of them He proposed a way to force them to refund the overplus as well to supply the present want as to prevent the like Exactions for the time to come The Duke hearkned to him and told him  his Advice was good Immediately after this  Marcos Dias  presented another Memorial to him wherein he shewed that his Majesty's Dues were considerably diminished that he offered to pay the full worth of them and yet to make an Advance of two hundred thousand Crowns a Present of a hundred thousand Crowns to the King and lessen the Imposition of the Dues one half of what it amounted to the year when they were less by one third part than they were this present Year For this he demanded that the Rents of the GuildHall of the City of  Madrid  the Payments whereof were assigned for these Funds should be reduced to five in the hundred whereas they were risen to eight and what is more he still offered to reimburse those Persons who were not willing to suffer this diminution  It is natural to believe that he knew his own Accounts well enough not to lose any thing by his Project and to say the truth he had been no loser For the Disorders and Rapines were at that time so great that not a ninth part of the King's Rights came into his Coffers The Duke foreseeing the Event of this Affair advised  Marcos Dias  not to stir out of the Palace but he had a mind to go to  Alcala  and he returned with vomiting of Blood and Convulsions which occasioned the belief that he was poisoned For this Overture of accommodating the publick Affairs disgusted some particular Persons of great Estates who got prodigious Summs at the Expence of the King and People▪ These Persons to avert this Blow had written to  Dias  and threatned to have him infallibly  stabbed if he continued his proposals He was very apprehensive of the danger he incurred and besides this these very Magistrates offered the same terms to his Majesty But the Duke saw there was all the reason in the world to prefer  Dias  and so he refused the others Upon a consideration of what these differences might produce the Duke advised him to have a care of himself till the Treaty was concluded The advice was good if he had had the good fortune to have followed it but as he came back from  Alcala  to  Madrid  he met some men in Masques who gave him several blows with little bags full of Sand so that he spit abundance of blood at his mouth and being seized with a violent Feavor died on the first day of  April  The Corrigidor and some other Officers of the City were the men that were principally exasperated against him because he had discovered their Villanies a little before nevertheless they were willing to submit to some beneficial alterations in matters and so they reduced the Rents of the GuildHall of the City from eight to five in the hundred There was also some small regulation made in the Civil Government but the Duke could not forbear to be sensibly touched for losing by the death of  Dias  an opportunity to serve the King and ease the People  In the mean time the people who had fully flattered themselves that if the Proposals made by  Dias  had taken effect they should have met with plenty instead of want being informed of his indisposition flocked about his House and cryed out aloud that he was poisoned and that this business ought to be examined  to the bottom because he suffered for the good will he had expressed towards them They added menaces against those persons who had opposed such profitable advice and as the King accidentally passed by them in his Coach a great body of them got about the Coach and followed it crying  Vive el Roi y muera el mal Goviorno  that is to say  Let the King live and the ill Government dye  There were great endeavours used to moderate the first motions of the popular fury which exceedingly increased on the day that  Dias  died Above six thousand were got together who ran up and down the Streets complaining and weeping bitterly every one of them said that they had murdered the only man that wished them well They accompanied his body to the place of burial and the Streets were so full of people that the King durst not stir out of his Palace altho he was to go to a great Festival that was celebrated by the Jesuits and he had a great desire to be there There was little probability that they would ever be appeased but as good fortune would have it the multitude was only made up of poor irresolute people whose spirits were broken by the miseries of which they complained All this Tempest past over in vain menaces and some injuries against some considerable persons but however it did not alter the State of Affairs  At this same time word was sent to the Nuncio by an express Order from Court that he should enjoy no other priviledges than what the Ambassador of  Spain  did at  Rome  This was a new occasion of discontent to him but the Action was general and they took care to inform the other Forreign Ministers that for the future they would allow them only the same priviledges as their Princes allowed to the Ambassadors of his Catholick Majesty so that he had no reason to complain since he was treated but like the rest This resolution was taken upon this account Six  Alguazils de Corte  passing before the House of the  Venetian  Ambassador it seems three of his Footmen knew them and demanded of them how they durst have the impudence to go through their Quarter The  Alguazils  returned them a sawcy answer whereupon the servants drew their Swords but the  Alguazils  fired immediately upon them and killed them upon the place The Ambassador made great complaints about it they promised to give him full satisfaction but to avoid the doing of it they thought it more expedient to revoke all the Franchises  The King received a Letter from the ViceRoy of  Naples  and was extreamly glad to hear that he had found out a way to borrow three hundred thousand Crowns of the Merchants of  Genoa  for the raising four thousand men that were to be sent into the  Milanese  But they were perswaded at Court that it would be a long time before they could be in a condition to get there because they demanded a further supply of mony from  Madrid  and here they wanted it without exception for every thing However this did not hinder them from using all imaginable efforts to contribute towards the raising of  these four thousand men because they were exceedingly alarmed at the Treaty of  Casal  which they pretended our King had bought of the Duke of  Mantua  They apprehended this was an open pass to render himself Master of  Italy  when he pleased and they were fully perswaded that he had sent an Army thither upon this score  The  Genoese  first whispered and spread about these jealousies which at last reached the  Venetians  so that they drew their Soldiers out of their Garrisons in  Dalmatia  and bestowed them in their own Towns in  Lumbardy  where they made some new Fortifications The Emperor for his part was as much alarmed as the rest of his Neighbours for he sent his Troops to the  Milanese  to guard them and several Princes of  Italy  put themselves to a great deal of trouble out of an apprehension of a rupture But if there was any reason to fear one it was from the side of  Bisca  where the people of that Province who are under the dominion of  Spain  have almost every day some disputes with those that live under the dominion of  France  sometimes about the fishing at other times about other differences each of them appropriating the River  de Bidassoa  to themselves so that they seldom live in peace Matters came to that upshot at last that they burnt several Barques and took several of the  French  prisoners Our Ambassador was ordered to demand justice for these injuries and frequently spoke to the Ministers about it who contued deaf in these cases because they had no mind to redress them They persisted to be so stiff and obstinate upon this occasion  that the Ambassador declared at last to Don  Vinzente Gonzaga  that his Master would order his Troops to march towards the Frontiers by which means it would be more easie to get satisfaction for the insolence of the Biscayneers than by sending to the Council at  Madrid  that His Majesty was concerned for the tranquility of his Subjects and that he would take a due course to procure it  Gonzaga  heard Monsieur  de Villars  very patiently and told him at last that he was surprized to find him address himself to him because he was no longer Commissary and that the Marquess  de los Balbazez  had been nominated to his Place above a month before The Ambassador acquainted him that generally these sorts of Changes are not made without informing those persons who are interested in them and that as for himself he had never heard the least mention of it Don  Vincente  replied that Don  Pedro Colonna  had been ordered to inform him of it but that in truth he was a negligent person and had showed himself so not only on this occasion Upon this he made some particular reflections that were not very obliging to the new Secretary of State  Don  Pedro Fernandez del Campo  Marquess  de Majorada  who had been formerly Secretary of State and to whom the Marquess  de Valenzuela  when he became sole Favourite had an aversion because he would not blindly obey him died of grief for the loss of his Place and to see it still possessed by Don  Jeronimo d'Eguya  The number of the Maids of Honour belonging to the Queen was about this time  augmented The King added to them the Daughter of the Princess  Pio  those of the Countess  de Villambrosa  the Marquess  de Pouar  the Duke  d'Hijar  Donna  Eleonora  of the House  de Zapara  the Niece of the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  and Mademoiselle  de Lalain  who was a  Flemish  Woman But altho' this was a Testimony of the particular Consideration which the King had for his young Queen because ordinarily the Queens of  Spain  have not so many yet he could not forbear to be sensibly tormented at the Stories which the  Camerara  continually buzzed into his Ear Don  Melchior Navarra  who had formerly been ViceChancellor of  Arragon  and whom Don  Juan  banished to  Cienpuzuelos  was called home at the intreaties of the Queen Mother Nay it was even believed that the King would give him the Place of President of  Castile  in case the President who was then embroyled with the Nuncio were turned of his Place  The King and Queen had the pleasure of hearing Mass celebrated at the Jesuits College in the  ChaldeanLanguage  by a Priest of the City of  Muzal  which was heretofore called  Ninive  After it was over the Queen who was always desirous of informing her self in matters of Curiosity sent for him to come to her and by the means of an Interpreter she asked him several questions and amongst the rest whether the Women were as severely lock'd up at  Muzal  as they were at  Madrid  This Question altho' there was nothing criminal in it was so maliciously explained by the Dutchess  de Terra Nova  that the King was observed to look upon her with a great  deal of Coldness for some days after This did not hinder the QueenMother from going to visit her who assured her with all the Tenderness imaginable how sensibly she was concerned at these ill Offices that were done her They went together to St  Marie la Royalle  where was celebrated the Beatification of  Torribio Alphonso Mogrobejo  Second Archbishop of  Lima  The Musick of the Chappel was there their Majesties were informed at their return that the Great ArchDeacon of  Madrid  was dead The QueenMother seemed to be desirous of seeing this Dignity filled by one of her own Creatures and the Young Queen proposed to send to Cardinal  Portocarero  to demand it of him But now it was too late for the Cardinal to prevent all Sollicitations upon this Point made haste to gratify his Nephew Don  Pedro Portocarero  with it  In the mean time whilst these small things happened News was brought that a Squadron of  French  Men of War commanded by the Marquess  de Valbelle  was arrived before the Isle of  Majorca  to demand of the Viceroy some Merchantmen that had been taken by the Corsairs since the Peace and Monsieur  Valbelle  had in his hands an Order of the King of  Spain  for their Restitution The Viceroy would not restore their Prizes alledging  That the Persons who had taken them had already shared and divided them and that they were not all of them  Majorcans  that the Effects were all consumed and gone and for his part he demanded Damages for certain Hostilities which these Corsairs had suffered  Valbelle  continued his Instances but seeing they had no Effect he declared that  he would not forget to make use of the Right of Reprisals  That the Subjects of the King of  Spain  whenever he met them on the Sea should find it to their cost that the King his Master had reason to complain of the usage he found at their hands That several Governors and Viceroys dependant upon the King of  Spain  had taken liberty to commit all Injustices against the  French  that it was almost to no purpose to demand satisfaction from those at  Madrid  where the Councils were filled with Persons who had played the same Tricks when they were in the like Posts and consequently durst not condem and punish others for the very same crimes they had committed themselves that he was assured this was the reason that occasioned this impunity and all their frivolous Pretences In a word that he was going to take another course with them and do himself Justice  These Menaces one would have thought were sufficient to alarm those Persons that were concerned in them but they have this Maxim in  Spain  That provided the danger is a little remote they never fear it whether this happens through insolence or temerity and they rather chuse to suffer the disorders that always fall out in Military Executions than give themselves the trouble to do Justice upon the Complaints that are made  But before I finish the First Part of my Memoirs I think it will not be altogether amiss to say something of the Councils of  Spain  according to the best information I have received concerning them  The Council of  State  The number of these Councellors is not fixed they don't observe the right of Seniority amongst themselves but take their Places as they happen to come into the Chamber The King administers the Oath to them and they sit as the Secretaries of State do upon benches with backs to them every man hath his Cushion the Councellors are in the middle near the Table the Secretaries of State at both ends  When the King assists there he has a Table above that of the Councellors who for that time have only places and the Secretaries of State stand  This Council is held twice every  Saturday  and but once on  Mondays  and  Tuesdays  all of them are called his Counsellors and they deliberate here upon affairs of the greatest importance such as Peace and War Leagues and Truces Here they likewise treat of the Marriage of the Kings and Princes of the Royal Family and distribute the Viceroyships and all the Governments of the Provinces that are under the Obedience of the King of  Spain  and altho other affairs are examined in other Councils yet the Councellors of State don't for all that omit to give the King their advice about them  Behold a List of those that compose this Council at present  The Constable of  Castile  who is the Dean of it  The Duke of  Alva  Don  Pedro d'Arragon  The Admiral of  Castile  The Marquess  d'Astorgas  The Duke  D'Ossone  The Prince  de Stillano  Don  Vincente Gonzaga  Prince  de Guastallo  Don  Lovis Portocarero  Cardinal and Archbishop of  Toledo  The Marquess  de Liche  The Marquess  de Los Balbazez  Don  Diego Sarmiento  The Prince  de Ligne  The Duke  de Villa Hermosa  Don  Melchior Navarra  The Marquess  de los Velez  The Count  d▪Oropesa  The Marquess  de Mansera  And the Duke  d'Albuquerque  The Council Royal of  Castile  This Council is the chief of all and to distinguish it from the rest by a Title of Honour the King calls it  Our Council  It was established by St  Ferdinand  the third of that name in the year There are in this Council a President Sixteen Councellors a Fiscal Six Reporters six Secretaries a Register and a Keeper of the Registers a Receiver of the  Fines due to the Council another of the Fines adjudged to particular persons a Treasurer a Deputy and a dozen Porters The Council assembles every  Friday  in the Palace towards Evening the King comes there The Kings Don  Ferdinand  the Fourth and Don  Alonzo  the last of that name established this Custom This Council is divided into four Chambers where they distribute those Affairs that are under their Jurisdiction in  Castile  One of them goes by the name of the Chamber of the fifteen hundred Pistoles because such a Sum is to be consigned before any man can get a review of a process which is pretended to be unjustly judged by the Parliaments of  Vailladolid  and  Granada  which are the two Parliaments of  Castile  When the President of  Castile  goes out of the Council the Counsellors follow him to his Chair he never makes any Visits never gives the Right hand to any at his House he is to give the King an account of the most important affairs that pass in Council where they name a Council every Week to report them  When the King comes there they all uncover themselves and kneel down Afterwards they cover themselves and sit  When Audience is over the King retires into his Cabinet with the President who discourses him about business of the greatest moment for which the King gives his Orders and this does not return any more to the Chamber for the Counsellors to deliberate upon it  In the Year all  Castile  was divided into five Districts and every District is under a Counsellor of the Council Royal who takes cognizance of the conduct of the Judges the Lords Ecclesiasticks and other secular persons Besides this there is a particular Council that is called the Council of the Chamber of  Castile  the President is the Chief and the King names a certain number of Counsellors of the Council Royal whether they be three or four that compose it Here it is that they dispatch all Benefices in the King's Nomination Titles and Patents for the most considerable Places Letters of Naturalization and the Ratification of Orders to arrest the Grandees of  Spain  and the Graces and Favours to which his Majesty is pleased to give his Consent  The King receives prodigious Sums of Money for the Places that are sold by the means of these Counsellors He gives likewise the Patents and Commissions of several places of Justice and 'tis commonly pretended that in the two  Castiles  the Kingdom of  Leon    Guypuscoa    Biscay  the Province  de Hana  and in  Navarr  there are above thousand places of Judicature  Secretary of State and of the Universal Dispatch  This Secretary is in a condition to serve or injure people according as he stands affected to them for all the Requests and Petitions which they call Memorials here  and are presented to the King or Chief Minister pass through his hand  'Tis he who sends them to his Counsellors who are to give their advice concerning them After the consult is made for this is their Phrase in  Spain  these Petitions are sent back again to the Secretary of State and when he reports them to the King his Majesty orders what pleases him and this is called a Decree  This Decree is expedited by persons proposed for that Office so that when these Requests are carried to the King they say the Memorial is mounted and when they are answered they say the Memorial falls down or else the Consult ascended and the Decree descended  Without counting the Secretary of State whom I have been speaking of there are two more that enter the Council one of them dispatches the Affairs of  Arragon  of  Italy  and  Sicily  the other those of  Castile  and the  North  One of these is named Don  Manuel de Lira  who was formerly Master of the Ceremonies and Envoy Extraordinary in  Holland  he was made at his return Secretary of State The other is called Don  Pedro Colonna  he is descended of a good Family and those of his House have always possest great places They may give their advice in writing in matters of consequence  The King sends the Decrees to them and through their hands Affairs go to the Council of State They make a Report of them there and gather the voices and give an account of all to his Majesty who at last orders it  as he thinks fit They have power to assemble the Council out of the appointed days when they judge it convenient and when the King has a mind that they should have any extraordinary Meeting they send the Order immediately to all the Counsellors  Every Secretary of State has a chief Commissary who is called the Official Mayor and exercises his Master's Office when he happens to be absent The Secretary of State for  Italy  has eight Commissioners reckoning him that is the principal the King pays them And the Secretary of State for the  North  has seven under him They chuse them themselves and the King gives his consent These dispatch all Patents and generally those Persons that get into these Employments advance their Fortunes in the World  The Council of War  This began as soon as the Kingdoms of  Castile  and  Leon  were erected under King  Pelagius  in the year  It assembles on  Mondays    Wednesdays  and  Fridays  As for what concerns the Government of it the King is always President of it and the Counsellors are Men of the Sword They must be Men of Experience and Service the number of them is not fixed and it depends upon the King's pleasure to augment or to diminish them Their Places are not regulated in the Council but they sit as they come It  is indeed true that when the Counsellors of State are called thither they have the upper end but then they never come but at a time when a full Council of War is held They have two Secretaries who have each of them two Commissaries under them one of these is for the Seaaffairs and the others for those at Land  When they debate about matters of justice an Assessor of the Council Royal makes a report of them who has likewise the priviledge to give his opinion before the Dean of the Council The King comes there almost every day There are besides some other Chambers that depend upon this Council such as those of the Flota's the Gallies and the Garrisons The King nominates the Officers for these Chambers The Councils are the same with those of the Council of War and 'tis the Chief Minister or the President of  Castile  that presides there  Alcaldes of the Court  The word  Alcalde  signifies a Judge of any place This Tribunal is full as ancient as the Council Royal whoever is judged to be a criminal by it can make no appeals but is executed immediately For this reason it is named the  Quinta Sala  that is to say the fifth Hall Here they determine both Civil and Criminal Affairs but when these Councils were established in  Castile  the Judges thereof were reduced to four  Alcaldes  They have been augmented since and are nine at present two Reporters and  four Registers Their Jurisdiction is divided into two parts one as I said before relates only to Criminal Matters the other is like that of ordinary Judges and is to direct the management of Civil Affairs  The Supream Council of the Inquisition  This Council was erected in the year by Don  Ferdinand  and Donna  Isabella  King and Queen of  Castile  to defend and preserve the Catholick Religion altho it is certain that this Tribunal of the Inquisition was established ever since the year The President of this Council is called the Inquisitor General and the Counsellors the Apostolick Inquisitors They are named by the Pope and there are in  Spain  above twenty thousand Officers belonging to the Holy Inquisition whose business it is to seize the persons of Criminals Every Council consists of six Inquisitors the word signifies Enquirers the Fiscal who is the Accuser two Secretaries and Alguazil Principal two Reporters a Receiver of the Fines four Porters and a Sollicitor The Inquisition keeps its Tribunals at  Madrid  at  Toledo  at  Granada  at  Sevil  at  Cordova  at  Murcia  at  Guenza  at  Logrono  at  Lierena  in  Gallicia  and at  Vailladolid  The Council of Orders  This was erected in the year The Duke  de Sessa  of the House  de Cordonne  is  now rhe President of it he has two Counsellors of the Order of St  Jago  twoof  Calatrava  two of  Alcantara  a Fiscal and a Secretary who are all Knights  The King is Grand Master of these three Orders and is called the Perpetual Administrator of it  This Council takes Cognizance of the Temporal and Spiritual Government and of the Civil and Criminal Justice of these Orders  There are also Religious Men and Religious Women of it who bring their proofs and carry the mark of the Order 'Tis in concert with this Council that the King examines those of his Subjects who are capable of filling the places and vacant governments that depend upon the Order  The Sacred Royal and Supream Council of  Arragon  The King Don  Ferdinand  established this Council at  Madrid  in the year  Charles  the Fifth confirmed it in the year and appointed new Regulations of it in when he passed through  Catalonia  to go into  Italy  The Chief of this Council is called the ViceChancellor who at present is Don  Pedro d'Arragon  and the Prince  de Stillano  is Treasurer General This place is hereditary to the Family of the Duke  de Medina de las Torres  and this Duke is the Head of it Three of the Councellers

the Civil Government  The CouncilRoyal of the  Indies  The  Spaniards  having had the good fortune to find out this part of the World which was unknown before and to reduce it under the Dominion of  Spain  His Catholick Majesty in the year established a Council of the  Indies  at  Madrid    Charles  the Fifth in added a Clause to it about the preserving of Religion and ordained that it should be

that are named by the Council  The Council of the  Crusade  Pope  Julius  the Second in the year granted the Priviledge of the  Crusade  to the Kings of  Spain  to make War against the Infidels the
