I shall  I Give him a faithful Relation of the Phaenomenon it self and that from the original Accounts of some of the most intelligent of those that saw it for I my self saw nothing of it and shall draw the proper Inferences therefrom  II I shall give him like faithful Accounts of other Phaenomena of the same Nature so far as they have hitherto come to my Hand  III I shall give some Account of Dr  Wallis  's Hypothesis about such Meteors  viz  That they are  Comets  with my Reasons against that Hypothesis  IV I shall give a like Account of Dr  Halley  's Hypothesis about them  viz  That they are a sort of  fortuitous Collection of Vapours  in the vast Void about us which by Accident only sometimes fall into our Atmosphere without any other relation thereto with my Reasons against that Hypothesis  V I shall propose an Hypothesis of my own for the Solution of these Appearances  viz  That they are no other than prodigious Storms or Blasts of Thunder and Lightening in the upper Regions of our Air with my Reasons for that Hypothesis  VI I shall conclude with a few Observations relating to these Meteors and their Consequences  I I shall give the Reader a faithful Relation of this surprizing Phaenomenon it self from the original Accounts of some of the most intelligent of those that saw it which Accounts do here follow  Dear Sir  A Surprizing Phaenomenon was seen with us here in the Air at Eight at Night on  Thursday  last much like the Description of what was lately at  Venice  a sudden Appearance of a Globe of Fire equal to the apparent Bigness and Brightness of the Sun illuminating the whole Region as at Noonday After a small Pause at its first breaking out in the Southwest betwixt  Orion  's  Girdle  and the  Great Dog  at about ° Elev it shot horizontally with pretty great Velocity into the Southeast leaving a Stream of Light in the Air and disappear'd in about ″ from its first Appearance but the Streams of Light were continued for a quarter of an Hour separated into two or three  bended Figures of the Colour of red mottled Fire which also dy'd away I should be glad to know whether any of this was seen at  London  and in what Quarter that we may make some Judgment of its real Distance and Altitude  Your most affectionate Friend  c  Yelvertoft NorthamptonShire  Mar    NB  This utmost Altitude of about    Degrees at  Yelvertoft  agrees well with several Observations made at  London  which seems to have been about the same Distance from the Meteor with  Yelvertoft  For here it never appear'd considerably above    Degrees high  Dear Sir  NOT knowing whether or no the following Account of the Appearance may be of any use to you I thought fit to send it that you may use it or not as you think fit After the Appearance was over there appeared a duskish red Streak whence they said the Appearance came it did not seem to change its Place at all but gradually vanish'd away in about a quarter or half an Hour if the same was also observ'd at other Places the Heighth and Distance of it might easily be calculated If my Globe be rightly made it was between or Degrees high and about Degrees from the South counting Westward But when I look'd at the Appearance it self thro' the Window it was got further SouthEastward and could not  be above Degrees high and was between and Degrees from the South to the Westward  I am  c  Lyndon Rutland  Apr    Wednesday Portsmouth    March    Dear Sir  ON  Thursday  Night I saw the shaking Meteor you make mention of I was abroad in the Yard before our Commissioner's Door and observ'd both the Beginning and almost the whole Continuance of it which I take to be thus  At Minutes past a Clock due West from the Place I stood about Degrees high first appear'd a round reddish Ball as near as I could guess or ′ Diameter which descended slowly downwards a little inclining to the South and all the while encreasing its Magnitude when it came within Deg of the Horizon it alter'd its Motion more aslant to the Southward and increas'd its Brightness and Magnitude prodigiously till its least Diameter was about to Minutes its Light and Brightness being equal to the Sun but of a whiter Colour I take the Redness you mention to proceed from the smoaky Air you live in The Air was clear except two thin Clouds through which it pass'd as if the Clouds had been heated or set on Fire in that Part and which continu'd near half an Hour Your Letter and some other Accounts I have seen say it continued half a Minute but indeed I guest by the Slowness of the Motion it was near a Minute before it disappear'd and when it came within or Deg of the Horizon my Sight was obstructed at a Tarhouse that intercepted Many People affirm they heard a Noise sometime after it like to Thunder or a hot Iron quench'd in Water and I thought I heard such a Noise faintly  which seem'd to be about  Yarmouth  in the  Isle of Wight  I have seen and spoke with some that were about Miles farther Westward who affirm they did hear such a Noise very distinctly  Ashton  near  Exon  March    LAST Night a few Minutes before eight a Clock we had here the terriblest Flash of Lightening that I believe was ever seen it lasted about three Minutes as near as I can guess It was so great that it quite obscur'd the Light of the Moon tho' it was a very bright Night There appear'd in the Sky a Stream as it were of Fire for some Minutes after and at some Distance as it were a Cloud of Smoke The Phaenomenon was so very surprizing that I did not at first well know what to make of it till after gazing at it about three or four Minutes we heard a great Clap of Thunder which at first resembled the Noise of Canon the most I ever heard in my Life  Phillack  near St  Ives  in  Cornwall  ON  Thursday March  between and in the Evening there appeared in the Firmament first a red Star bigger than common and did increase more and more till at last it burst out in a splendid Light which did run from the North to the South and continued near a Minute so light as it was at NoonDay We were all astonish'd to see such a splendid Appearance this time a Night  March    I Could give you a particular Account of the Phaenomenon which was seen the th Instant in the Evening for the Explosion was heard here and by observing the Time between seeing the Light and hearing the Sound I have the Distance by which with the Angle it made above the Horizon by Trigonometry I calculate its perpendicular Height to be near Miles and that it was Vertical about  Sheepwash  or  Torrington  in  Devonshire  and that it was seen in other Countries besides  England  by reason of its great Height I suppose the Explosion was not took Notice of at  London  by reason it would not reach the Ear in less than Minutes after the Light  I am  c  Looe  in  Cornwall  March    NB  The same Author afterward gave a more particular Account of what he observ'd about this Meteor of which the Epitome follows  It broke out between the two foremost Stars in the Square of the little  Bear  but or Degrees to the Eastward at the Altitude of ° It ran along by the Star in the bending of the  Dragons Tail  and thro' the great  Bears Tail  a little below the middle Star and so away towards  Cor Caroli  and past pretty near it thence coming round again it fell down into our Horizon cutting it at  SSE  half South nearly but if any thing to the Eastward not coming nigh the  Moon  The Sound was certainly heard at  Guernsey  The Course was from the South to the East  The Sound makes its Altitude Miles nearly  NB  That this Author's own natural Thoughts of the Meteor's Altitude from his Observations was between    and    Miles tho' in this Letter he seems willing to extend it to about    Miles And that another Auditor near  Lempster  in  Herefordshire  estimated the Interval between the Light and the Sound by a Watch and found it about    Minutes Which gives about    Miles of Altitude also  From  Exeter  SITTING at the Fireside about Eight a Clock at Night the  Moon  shining then very bright and the Sky clear not the least Cloud to be seen on the sudden there appeared a very great Light far brighter than the Sun at Noonday accompanied with so great an Heat that the Arm of mine which was next to the Window burnt for many Hours as if it had been scalded There was so great a Smoak that I thought and so did many others that all the Ground had been on Fire but we soon perceived that it was in the Sky The Light came from the NorthEast which is the Situation of our Room it seem'd to go very swift over our House and so over the Church to the SouthWest In a very short time it returned back again but not near so big and as it appeared to us broke just over the Church like a SkyRocket but so large and with so many Sparks of Fire that it left so great a Redness seemingly to us just the breadth and length of the Church that it looked like all Blood and gave the same Reflexion into the Rooms on the other side of the House Some Minutes after this I should think at least seven or eight we heard a Report like a great Canon much greater than ever I heard It shook the House and Windows very much About a  Minute after there went off to our thinking about thirty not so big They sounded just as the TowerGuns did when we were in  Mincinglane  but shook the House and Windows much more After this we heard smaller with a Sound like Drums and Trumpets which lasted but a short Time After the Light went off although the Moon seemed to shine bright for about two Minutes it was so dark that we could not see our Hands  NB  That Resemblance of the latter Sounds to a Drum I have heard confirm'd by more than one Auditor besides  I Should not trouble you any longer but that we had a very extraordinary Meteor last  Thursday  Night the Nineteenth of this Instant I was walking in  Stephen  's Green and saw it distinctly about after Seven the Moon was pretty bright when on a sudden it was in a Manner extinguish'd by a prodigious Blaze two or three Times bigger than its Orb of very white clear Light It began about  ESE  moved forward to the  S  for about Degrees extreamly swift and then ended in a Point It shot like a Cone left a Train of reddish Light which soon vanish'd for all was over in eight or nine Seconds The Appearances of Meteors are so sudden and their Continuance so short that they are seldom observ'd and hard to be describ'd It was seen at  Drogheda  but I have heard no Account of it further off  TrinityCollege Dublin    Mar    London    March    COming Home this Evening about a Clock thro' St  Paul  's ChurchYard on the North side my Face being Westward I discern'd in the Sky a large Ball of Fire at about or ° height from the Horizon and bearing about  W  and by  N  or  WNW  when I first saw it It seem'd to be as large as the Moon at Full with a pale blewish Light and to have little Motion but in a Moment it was thrown into the Shape of a common Meteor the Head diminishing 'till it was all turn'd into a long Stream of Light which extended to about or ° in the Heavens toward  SW  and on an Angle of about or ° from a Parallel with the Horizon but the broadest part of this Stream was at least double to the Diameter of its first Appearance and made so strong a Light while it was in its greatest Extent that for a Moment the Moon which was above a Day past the first Quarter and all the Stars seem'd to disappear by the Superiority of this new Light and at that Moment one might have read the smallest Print by it While it was throwing it self into this beautiful Stream I thought I heard a Noise of hissing like what is made by the flying of a large Rocket in the Air but I heard no other Noise The Light tho' very strong was very agreeable to the Eye and as it vanish'd it turn'd from a bright Pale to a Yellowish Colour The Duration of the whole I do not think was above half a Minute and of the greatest Light not the tenth part of a Minute  An Account of the late  Meteor  as it appear'd at  Norwold  in  Norfolk  about nine Mile North West of  Thetford  March  the th  ABout a quarter past eight in the Evening the Sky being very clear and the Moon between a Day and two Days past the first Quarter there appeared a bright Star a little West of  Orion  and somewhat higher than his Belt at first it stood still but in a few Minutes began to glide slowly and almost parallel to the Horizon and increas'd in Velocity and Bigness till it came to be between the Belt and Sword of  Orion  by which time it was as big as the Moon in the Horizon and burst and fell down very swift with a Train of Light about the Breadth of a Rainbow which reached from  Orion  to the Horizon and gradually vanished in small Sparks like a Rocket It was a Minute or more before they were quite extinguished the Light was so great as to extinguish that of the Moon the Colour was very White and Blue like the common Composition of Stars in Rockets and several Persons both Abroad and in the House were positive of hearing distinctly a Noise like a great Number of Rockets going off together  diagram of path of meteor  Worcester  Mar    SIR  ON  Thursday  the th of  March  at h so estimated by a Pendulum Clock compar'd the next Day with an Horizontal Dial made at  London  but without allowing any thing for its deviating a little from the true  North  to the  Eastward  At that Time I say I was walking in my Chamber with my Face towards the Window made of a clear Glass from which I was at about three or four Foot Distance when I saw on a sudden through it at the  South West  a very great Flash of Fire express'd in the Figure by A B I open'd instantly the Window from whence I had a clear Prospect of that Part of Heaven except about three or four Degrees next to the Horizon The whole Space A B was fill'd up in an Instant with a very bright Flame which might last about four Seconds of Time and perhaps not above two or three Seconds and so did suddenly vanish leaving in the very same Place A B a small thin Cloud of a grey Colour somewhat reddish At the same Time a small Fire continu'd from B to run leisurely along the Line B E C leaving all along behind it a grey Stream about ′ broad The Line B E C was very uniform a little bending towards  Sirius  but the Edges or Sides of it were rough and not uniform as the Line it self this Part being in some Places a very little broader or narrower than in others The whole Figure A B E C resembled exactly a Rod or Staff The Fire might be about five Seconds in describing the Line B E C having its handle about d broad in A B in a direct continued Line with the rest While the Line B C was a forming it look'd exactly as if a Rocket or a Bomb had been thrown in our Neighbourhood The visible Remains of this whole Phenomenon  continuing about a Quarter of an Hour gave me an Opportunity of delineating it immediately with the Stars about it But because of the Impossibility of making a plain Figure representing truly so great a Part of Heaven unless it be in the Nature of a Projection I have reduc'd here my Figures to a Planisphere whereof the  Zenith  is the Center the Eye being suppos'd in the opposite Point in the Surface of the Sphere However I have placed the Stars only by Estimation as my Figures directed me without using any Table of the Stars  c  In my Draught I suppos'd for a Foundation that the highermost Star in  Orion  was about d high as I judg'd it to be by Estimation The Situations and Proportions are very near the Matter in the Figure including in it  Procyon  at least they are so near the Matter that from this Observation and any tolerable Observation beside made in  England  c from any Place fit for that Purpose it may be very safely determined how high this Phenomenon was from the Surface of the Globe what Places it was perpendicular upon what was its true Bigness and Figure and real Swiftness in Burning and how much it was leaning at its Extremity C either towards  Worcester  or from it and lastly whether the Line A B E C was really uniform in it self and almost streight or whether it only seemed so to me as being at  Worcester  As soon as we knew that this Phenomenon had been seen at  London  and that there as they said it gave as great a Light as in the Day Time I concluded that it had been seen in  Cornwall  too The printed Account in a Letter from  Plimouth March  the th though very general and upon that Account imperfect yet enables us to guess very well at the Height and Bigness and Situation of the bright Part A B of this Phenomenon and that with so much the more Certainty because the Part A B was very near the  Zenith  at  Plimouth  NB  That this curious Author's Computation of the middle Point of the larger Part of the Meteor or of it when it was bursting to Pieces in its Explosion is scarce  ½  Miles But then that is only on the Supposition that that Point was perpendicularly over  Plimouth  as some imperfect Accounts at first said whereas the Observations by the Stars which are among the exactest I have heard of compar'd with others already set down will prove That that Point was not then over  Plimouth  but rather over the middle of  Bretaign  in  France  which greater Distance will by the same Method of Computation afford us near forty Miles Altitude which agrees with the most accurate Observations of the Interval between the Sound and the Light and with the rest of the Observations by the Stars already set down and indeed with the Generality of the Observations every where that I have met with and may therefore I think be entirely depended on by us  NOW the proper Result of all these Accounts and of many others that I have seen and heard is this That this Meteor was compos'd of Nitrosulphureous Vapours or Exhalations collected first together in the upper Regions of the Air over  Radnorshire  in  Wales  or the neighbouring Counties That it was at first smaller and to Appearance like a large Star only that it gathered more Fewel as it rolled along and grew larger and larger all the Way that its Course was nearly Parallel to the Horizon and its Direction nearly South or a very small matter towards the SouthWest That by the time it came to be Vertical between  Cardiff  in  Wales  and and  Minehead  in  Somersetshire  over the  Severn  Sea it was become vastly large and bright so as to exceed the Noonday Sun in Splendor near that Line along which it pass'd and  to equal its apparent Magnitude also That it proceeded in this manner quite over  Devonshire  but much nearer the Eastern Limits of it than the Western That it past almost perpendicularly over the City of  Exeter  and so over the  British  Channel till it came over  Bretaign  in  France  That all this while its Magnitude and Light were not impair'd that it made a hissing Noise like a Rocket all the way and spread a prodigious and continued Lightening even to the utmost Limits of the whole Horizon That upon its coming near to  Bretaign  in  France  it began to burst to Pieces and dissolve with a prodigious Noise which endur'd for some time answering to the time of its bursting to Pieces all the while it was dissolving That it left a large Smoke or sort of Cloud along all that Space where it burst above Miles in Length over our Channel and  Bretaign  and perhaps somewhat further towards  BellIsle  That the Noise of this Explosionw as heard all along its Course and or Miles at least on both Sides of it first like a vast Number of great Guns discharg'd together and then like the rattling or interrupted Noise of Drums such as are in both Cases usual in and after great Claps of Thunder That this Meteor while it was dissolving seems to have sent out lesser Streams of Light backwards towards  Wales  from the Northend and backwards towards  Exeter  from the Southend before it intirely vanished After which certain Traces or Streams of the fiery Vapors continued sor a quarter of an Hour as Marks where it had passed That this Meteor must have been about or Miles in perpendicular Height from the Earth all along tho' perhaps somewhat lower towards its dissolution That it went from  Radnor  in  Wales  to the utmost Parts of  Bretaign  in  France  or about Miles in or ″ of Time or at the Rate of above Miles in a Minute That it must have been visible wherever Clouds did not interpose within the Compass of an Oval whose longer Axis drawn nearly through  Radnor  and  BellIsle  must have been about Miles and its lesser at right Angles thereto about Miles  i e  through  all  Great Britain  and  Ireland  through  Holland Flanders  the Western Parts of  Germany  all  France  and the NorthEast Parts of  Spain  with  Lombardy  in  Italy  And that it was really about a Mile in Diameter That therefore it was truly a  Meteor  or what properly during its whole Course was within the Limits of our Atmosphere As both the hissing Noise during its Passage and the terrible Thunder afterwards do plainly demonstrate It being well known that no Sound can be propagated but through the elastical Medium of the Air The remaining Traces of this Meteor left in the same Air and seen therein for a quarter of an Hour after it was gone are also evident Demonstrations of the same thing  II I shall now give the Reader faithful Accounts of other Phaenomena of the like Nature with this Meteor before us so far as they have hitherto come to my Hand  The first Meteor of this kind that I have met with as seen in this last Age for of the elder Ones we have generally such imperfect Accounts and that chiefly as Omens only that little Light can be gathered from them to any sober Enquirer's Satisfaction is that mentioned by Dr  Hook  in these Words  Hook  's  Posthumous Works  p  A like Phaenomenon to that in  Italy  says he was some Years before observ'd both here in  England  and in  Holland  It was seen by Sir  Rob Murray  if I misremember not and by Mr  Shortgrave  and I think also by Mons  Hugens  in  Holland  It was as big as the  Italian  Meteor and was judg'd to be of an exceeding great Height in the Atmosphere being seen at Places so far distant at the same time It appeared first about the NorthEast and passed by the NorthWest not rising as I remember so high as Degrees above the Horizon  The second Meteor of this kind that I have met with was in the Words of the same Dr  Hook  Ibid  p  A  Fax  or  Lampas volans  observ'd after Sunset the st of  March  at  Fau  by  Petrus de Lavina  at  Rome  by Monsieur  Auzout  at  Florence  by  Matthias del Arpi  at  Venice  by  Jo Jacob Hertz  and in several other Cities of  Italy  In all which it was seen also by very many others And at the same time also was observ'd in the lower Parts of  Germany  as at  Triers  by the Jesuits there Places very far distant from one another and yet the Time and Manner of the Appearance in all was much the same It seemed to rise out of the NorthEast and to pass by the Meridian to the SouthWest Parts of the Heavens near the same Tract that the Sun had gone that Day and disappear'd behind thick Clouds where with a mighty Noise it was suppos'd to be blown to pieces and dispers'd It appeared about the Bigness of the Full Moon and left behind it a Tail about three Diameters of a reddish Flame at first but turning blewish towards the last It lasted about a Minute or two Its Noise at last was like the Noise of an Earthquake at a Distance and made the Glass in the Windows shake From the comparing several Observations 'twas suppos'd about Miles high and near a Mile in Diameter  NB  This must in all Probability be the very same Meteor which  Montanari  the great Mathematician at  Bononia  saw and exactly measur'd of which presently For it was seen in the same Year in the same Month at the same time of the Night in the same Countries and passed along the very same Course and was of the same Bigness as will appear immediately How the Day of the Month  March  for  March  comes to be mistaken I do not certainly know only if they were both meant of the same Style it is very easily accounted for  NB  The real Altitude therefore of this Meteor was not    Mile as 'tis here in general stated but about    Miles rather as  Montanari  particularly measur'd it as we shall now see  The Third or rather the same Second Meteor of this kind I have met with is that on  March  about an Hour and three quarters after Sunset exactly to a few Minutes within two Days of Years before the last which was an eminent one indeed and was particularly observ'd at  Bononia  by that great Mathematician  Montanari  "It came over the  Adriatick  says Dr  Halley  in his Extract from him  Philosophical Transact  No  "as from  Dalmatia  crost over  Italy  and became nearly Vertical to  Rimini  and  Leghorn  Its perpendicular Altitude was at least Miles it made a hissing Noise as it passed which was heard near its Course From  Leghorn  it went off to Sea towards  Corsica  And at  Leghorn  it was heard to give a very great Blow beyond the Noise of a great Cannon with a Rattling which continued about a Minute or two Its Velocity was not less than Miles in a Minute It was of an oval Shape At Miles Distance its lesser Diameter was as large to the Eye as the Moon's Diameter and its larger above half as big again so that its real lesser Diameter was above half a Mile and the other more than three quarters of a Mile  The next Meteor of this kind was that mentioned by Dr  Wallis Sept  about at Night which he describes thus  Philosophical Transact  No  "There appeared a sudden Light equal to that of Noonday so that the smallest Pin or Straw might be seen lying on the Ground and above in the Air was seen at no great Distance as was suppos'd a long Appearance as of Fire like a long Arm with a great Knob at the End for so it was described to the Dr who did not himself see it  shooting along very swiftly And at its disappearing seem'd to break into small Sparks or Parcels of Fire like as Rockets and such artificial Fireworks in the Air are wont to do 'Twas so surprizing and of so short continuance that it was scarce seen by any who did not then happen to be abroad and lasted only while one might tell or at most It was seen in most of the Southern Counties of  England  at or near the same time Nor could the Dr satisfy himself which way this Meteor went  The next Meteor of this kind is that mentioned by  Kirchius  as seen at  Leipsick May    Philosophical Transact  No  "about three in the Morning as descending in the North and leaving behind it a long white Streak It was seen at several Places  English  Miles distant from  Leipsick  but met with no good Observers as it is no wonder at that time of the Night  The next Meteor of this kind was seen by  Kirchius  himself at  Leipsick July    Ibid  "at half an Hour past One in the Morning which mov'd but very little for half a quarter of an Hour its Diameter was about half as large as that of the Moon Its Light at first was such you might read by it but by degrees it vanished away It was seen in many Places at a considerable Distance from  Leipsick  and and was at least  English  Miles high  The next Meteor of this kind that I have met with was seen by Mons  Feuillee  a curious  Ir  Observer in the  SouthSea May    about Nine at Night His Words are these  Feuillee  's  Journal  p  We saw s ys be a flying Fire which being lighted all of a sudden perfectly resembled the Planet  Venus  it remaind in the Place where it first appear'd for a Minute and a half I took care to observe it by comparing it with the nearest of the fixed Stars On a sudden it extended it self and filled all the Horizon with Light in such a manner that we might have discover'd a Ship  in any Part of the Horizon This Light thus spread lasted but a short time  The next Meteor of this kind that I have met with was seen by the same Observer a little above two Months after the former in the same Voyage  July  His Words are these  Ibid  p  In the Night I saw a Phaenomenon very Particular almost like another that I had observed in the Northern Parts As Astronomy has been always my chief delight I was looking up to the Heavens to observe the Stars that make all its Beauty and which compose the Southern Constellations When I perceived on a sudden a Star much greater than  Jupiter  and  Venus  which continuing more than two Minutes in the same bigness and without losing any thing of its Light I began to think from its duration that it was a  New Star  Whilst I was employ'd in observing this New Phaenomenon it happen'd that this Luminary as I could properly call it at that time took Fire all on a sudden andextending it self throughout all our Hemisphere discover'd it to us intirely and made us see to the furthest Limits of it so that we might have seen a Ship at a great distance and if I may venture to say it even in any Part of the Horizon from whence one may judge how very great this Light must have been  The next Meteor of this kind was seen in  England July  between and a Clock at Night  Philosophical Transact  No  "It was between and Miles perpendicularly high and that over  Sheerness  or the  Buoy on the Nore  It was seen at  London  and in  Suffolk  and no doubt in the neighbouring Parts of  England    It appear'd at  London  to move horizontally from  E  by  N  to  E  by  S  and in  Suffolk  it appear'd as sliding obliquely downwards It was very bright at its first Appearance sufficient to take up a Pin and but a little inferior to the Light of the  Moon  and it died away at the End of its Course leaving a pale whiteness in the Place without any Noise  This is an Epitome of the several Histories of Meteors of this Nature that I have yet met with in the last Age  Nor do I know of any the like Meteors seen since till this before us Unless we reckon that mention'd in our  Gazette  and NewsPapers as seen over  Venice Feb  last But since it does not yet appear that this was seen at any considerable Distance perhaps it might be somewhat of another Nature and such a Meteor as is several times seen in our lower Air  III I shall now give some Account of Dr  Wallis's  Hypothesis about such Meteors namely that they are Comets with my Reasons against that Hypothesis  Now as to this Hypothesis take it in the Doctor's own Account  Philos Transact  No as set down by Mr  Lowthorp  in his Abridgment of those Transactions  "The Breadth of Ground says he where this  Meteor Sept  was seen was too much for any ordinary Meteor in our lower Region of the Air to be seen in at once which argues that either it was  higher  than it was imagin'd to be tho' the  Light  of it reached the Earth or else that it had a very  swift Motion  This made me then conjecture that it might be some small  Com t  whose  linea trajectori  passed very near our Earth or upon it and might when farther distant from us appear as a Comet And that Comet which hath since appeared in  Apri  and  May  confirms me in the same Opinion which I conjecture may be the very same which passed by us in  September  last  So far Dr  Wallis  Now tho this Hypothesis might be tolerable when it was written before the true Theory and Motions of Comets were discover'd by Sir  Isaac Newton  and when the Dr seems not to have been acquainted with any other Appearance of the like Nature yet will it now no way bear The Reason is obvious  viz  because these Meteors have no manner of Resemblance to Comets at all  either in their  Bigness  which is usually about or under a Mile in Diameter while Comets are usually of the Bigness of Planets or several thousand Miles in Diameter or in their  Nature  which is that of Light or Fire while Comets are ever as dark or opake in themselves as the Planets or in their  Trajectory  which in Comets is a Line descending to and ascending from the Sun and nearly parabolical while these Meteors still pass in a manner parallel to the Earth's Horizon or in their  Velocity  which in these Meteors is very different but in Comets near the Earth is always the same or in their  Atmospheres  of which these Meteors are still destitute but which almost always encompass the Bodies of Comets and that to a vast Distance or in their  Tails  of which we have no Signs in these Meteors but which almost as certainly accompany the Comets as do their Atmospheres themselves as indeed derived from them or in their  visible Duration  which in these Meteors is seldom many Minutes frequently not many Seconds but in Comets is usually many Days or Weeks nay sometimes Months To say nothing of the Impossibility there is that the same Comet which was near the Earth in  September  should continue near it or approach again to it seven or eight Months afterwards as the Dr supposes when the Earth was then not very far from the opposite Point of its Orbit or more than Miles distant from its former Place 'Tis therefore certain that these Meteors cannot belong to the Species of Bodies we call Comets  IV I shall now give a like Account of Dr  Halley  's Hypothesis about these Meteors  viz  That they are a sort of  fortuitous Collection of such Vapours  in the vast Void about us as by Accident only fall into our Atmosphere at certain times without any other relation thereto with my Reasons against that Hypothesis  Dr  Halley  gives us his Hypothesis  Transact No    p  in these Words  "I have says he much considered  this Appearance and think it one of the hardest things to account for that I have yet met with in the Phaenomena of Meteors and am induced to think that it must be some Collection of Matter form'd in the Aether  as it were by some fortuitous Concourse of Atoms  and that the Earth met with it as it past along in its Orb then but newly form'd and before it had conceiv'd any great  Impetus  of Descent toward the Sun For the direction of that over  Italy  was exactly opposite to that of the Earth that is its Course was from  WSW  to  ENE  wherefore the Meteor seem'd to move the contrary way and besides falling into the Power of the Earth's Gravity and losing its Motion from the Opposition to the Medium it seems that it descended towards the Earth and was extinguish'd in the  Tyrrhene  Sea to the West South West of  Leghorn  The great Blow being heard upon its first Immersion into the Water and the rattling like the driving a Cart over Stones being what succeeded upon its quenching something like which is always observ'd upon quenching a very hot Iron in Water  Thus far Dr  Halley  Now the plain Reasons why I can no way agree to this Hypothesis are these  'Tis very evident there neither is nor can be any such  Collection of Vapours form'd in the Aether as it were by some fortuitous Concourse of Atoms and without Gravity  which the Dr here supposes as the Foundation of his Hypothesis Such a Mass of Matter in an immense Vacuum without any Gravitation to the Sun the Dr well knows is a mere Chimaera contradicting all the certain Philosophy in the World Nor can it be possibly suppos'd but by immediate Creation out of nothing or by it self emerging out of nothing without being created before it could be thus  collected together  neither of which Notions I imagine will be justify'd by the Dr himself in his cool Thoughts But let us for once suppose such Masses of fiery Matter frequently collected in the Aether tho' we know they cannot possibly be so collected yet is it evident  That if such Meteors as these were thence deriv'd they would appear at all sorts of Distances within the reach of their Light or within the reach of a thousand or two of Miles For a Body so large and a Light so nearly equal to that of the Sun as these have would certainly be visible so far whereas it does not appear that any of them have been yet seen so far as Miles from the Earth  These Meteors would on such an Hypothesis be equally of all Magnitudes whatsoever such fortuitous Productions if such there were going for certain by no Rule at all Whereas those abovementioned seem never to have been of a larger Size than this last which was about a Mile in Diameter and the rest of no very great Variety therefrom  They would and must all upon this Hypothesis as the Dr allows in these Climates go nearly with the same Velocity and in the same Course as to our Sight  i e  from East to West because their Motion being only apparent must be deriv'd from the Earth's Motions Annual and Diurnal which are from West to East both the same way and of one tenor Whereas these Meteors go uncertainly and without any regard to those Motions at all Accordingly this last went almost directly South and much faster than even the annual Motion it self entirely contrary to this Hypothesis  If these Balls of Light or Fire were such Masses as did not belong to our Atmosphere but only pass'd through it accidentally as Dr  Halley  supposes why do we not see them before our Atmosphere reaches them and after it leaves them whenever it does so as well as while they pass through it not to say that the first Collection as well as last Dissolution of these Meteors does by the Observations themselves appear both to begin and end within the Limits of that Atmosphere and thereby shew they properly belong to it entirely contrary to the Dr's Hypothesis  If this was the Origin of these Meteors why do they seldom or never hit against the Body of the  Earth it self or terraqueous Globe but against the Air Or rather why does the Body of the Earth or terraqueous Globe seldom or never hit against these Meteors but only the Air nay the upper Regions of the Air Why do these Meteors seldom or never destroy a City or burn up a Fleet as well as pass over our Heads without doing us any Damage The Earth's Diameter is near Miles the Altitude of any sensible Atmosphere as Dr  Halley  has fully prov'd is not Miles and thence the Diameter of the whole not Miles Now the Disk or biggest Circle of the larger Sphere will be to the Disk or biggest Circle of the smaller here as the Squares of those Numbers or nearly as to and the Difference of those Squares or the Hazard of such a Ball's hitting against the Earth or the Atmosphere will be as the smaller Number to the Difference of those Numbers or as to Nay since only the upper Regions of the Air for in them alone these Meteors have been seen are to be compar'd with the Earth it will appear on a like Calculation that the Hazard of such a Ball's hitting against the Earth is to that of its hitting against the upper Parts of the Atmosphere at least as to or that one with another of these terrible Meteors will hit against the Earth it self and destroy all before them for one that hits against the upper Regions of the Air and above will hit against either the Earth or lower Regions of the Air for one that hits against those upper Regions to which yet we see Providence usually if not always confines them I say that these Meteors seem seldom or never to hit against the terraqueous Globe it self  'Tis true Dr  Halley  imagines that those which go off with a Report as the principal certainly and all probably do must fall into the Sea and in quenching make that Noise we hear after these Meteors and that one of those already mentioned descended towards the Earth and was extinguished particularly in the  Tyrrhene Sea  But then since that is a bare Hypothesis and without any Fact or History to support it nay contrary to the known Observations themselves  while Dr  Hook  's Account set down as above assures us that the  Italian Meteor  which Dr  Halley  suppos'd to fall into the Sea only set behind a Cloud I shall not need to confute it any farther In short this whole Hypothesis seems to me so very weak that it can only be excus'd and forgiven on account of the many other noble and truly excellent Performances of its Author Tho' I confess I think this Author should not easily forgive himself in one thing I mean that odd Insinuation here made as if there might be a  formation of Meteors  at least if not of other Bodies also  as it were by some fortuitous Concourse of Atoms  which I venture to say it is at this time of Day especially as little agreeable to sound Philosophy as to all the Notions we have of Providence and Religion  V I shall now propose a New Hypothesis of my own for the Solution of these Appearances  viz  That they are no other than prodigious Storms or Blasts of Thunder and Lightening in the upper Regions of our Air With my Reasons for that Hypothesis  Having therefore now given my Reasons why I cannot at all go into the Notions of either Dr  Wallis  or Dr  Halley  in this Matter I come to my own Hypothesis or Conjecture so I shall yet call it Tho' I confess the Evidence for it seems to me so strong that if the future Phaenomena of this kind do confirm it as much as I think those do which we are hitherto acquainted withal it may perhaps hereafter merit a higher Denomination  My Opinion therefore concerning such Meteors is plainly this That they properly deserve that Name of  Meteors  as belonging directly to our Atmosphere and that they are no other than prodigious Storms or blasts of Thunder and Lightening of such Thunder and Lightening as is proper and peculiar to those more elevated Regions of our Air in which they appear In order to the true understanding of my meaning in which Hypothesis the Reader must observe that the Air at Miles high is by Dr  Halley  's Calculation  agreed to now by all about times rarer and weaker than it is here with us that a Storm or Blast of this kind even here below seems to be a Collection of nitrosulphureous and fiery Vapors into a sort of a rolling Globe or Whirlwind of Fire that this is that  Fulmen  or  pernicious Lightning  which is so terrible in its Effects that it is still accompanied with that  Fulgur  or  Flash  we call  common Lightening  and with that  Tonitru  that great rolling or rattling Noise which we call  Thunder  and that such Collections of nitrosulphureous or fiery Vapors may be vastly larger before they are limited or determined by the external Air which by rarefaction is excluded from within where it is so vastly rare than the like Collections are with us That the prodigious Velocity of such Balls may also be better suppos'd in such a rare and thin Medium than in ours so much denser and thicker and that so much the greater Quantity of nitrosulphureous Vapors will be spent and exhausted by one such Ball or Blast than by one of ours here below as it is in Magnitude greater which will also render such Phaenomena in the same Proportion rarer and seldomer in any certain region there than here  These things being supposed which appear to me very reasonable it will be a natural Account of these Phaenomenona if we esteem them direct Blasts of this kind For certainly these Fireballs as we have shew'd are still within the Limits of our Air the Place of such Meteors They have all the three Characters of such and only of such Blasts the  Fulmen  the Ball or Whirlwind of pernicious Lightening the  Fulgur  the Flash or common Lightening and the  Tonitra  the Noise or Thunder They go with a Swiftness which we have no Examples of here in any Meteors unless it be in such Thunder and Lightening So that I do not see room for much doubt in the Case 'Tis true the rareness of the Air above will as in all like Cases greatly deaden and damp the sound of the Thunder as no doubt it does but this is no great difficulty here because the prodigious Vastness of the Blast if it be at all so much more violent as  the Fireball is greater in Quantity as it must naturally be will abundantly make up that Defect and afford us a sufficient Sound notwithstanding as will appear presently by Calculation I do not indeed know any mechanical Power that in such a fluid Medium as the Air can cause so sudden and so prodigious a Collection of fiery Vapors and carry them in one particular horizontal Direction with such an immense Velocity as we here meet with But then I am equally at a loss for the mechanical Cause of the strange Effects of Gunpowder and of the like Cause of the Velocity Force and Direction of Thunder and Lightening and indeed of many other Powers of Nature of whose Existence yet there is no manner of Question So that if it appear that this Meteor is no other than a Blast of Thunder and Lightening such as is proper and peculiar to the higher Regions of the Air as I hope it now does we ought not to object this Difficulty against the present Solution which is built on the known Properties of nitrosulphureous Vapors in all such Explosions whether of Gunpowder below or of Thunder and Lightening a little above  And now for a Conclusion I shall Observe a few things which may on this Occasion deserve the Attention of the Curious  Note That such a Collection of nitrosulphureous Vapours as this of a Mile in Diameter is to such a Collection of the like Vapours in the largest ThunderStorms here below of scarce Feet Diameter as the Cubes of those Diameters or as to So that the Explosion or Force of such a Ball of Fire as this would naturally as to Light Sound and Strength be in the same Proportion also Whence it is questionable whether if all the Gunpowder now in the World were laid together and fir'd at once it could make an Explosion equal to this before us  Note That therefore it is no Wonder that the Sound of this Explosion was heard at the Distance of at least or Miles from the Explosion it self even through that upper Air where it is about times  rarer and therefore in the same Proportion weaker than it is here below  Note That therefore if this Ball of Fire had been directed downward and come into our lower Air and been there exploded its Sound at the same Distances would have been about times as great as it now was So that besides the sad Desolation that might arise from the Ball of Fire which would have been vastly sudden and terrible the very Sound or Concussion of the Air would it self have been exceeding dreadful and very fatal also to all the neighbouring Animals Trees and Buildings whatsoever Some of the smaller  Meteors  of this kind afford no Sound at this Distance but the larger sort of which the last was the Principal did so always to a great Degree as the foregoing Histories inform us  Note That therefore a smaller  Meteor  of this sort or such as some of the foregoing Histories describe if it should descend to the Earth would be abundantly sufficient utterly to destroy a particular City and such an one as this no small part of a County and that in an instant without giving the least room for foreknowing preventing or escaping from the same  Note That we know of no mechanical Causes that can prevent such a Descent of these  Meteors  downwards For as our common Thunder and Lightening certainly do and that not seldom descend from the Clouds to the Earth and make lesser Destructions there so do some of the best Observations incline us to allow that even this as well as others of these  Meteors  have a little descended in their Course also Nor in case of the original Direction downwards do I know any sufficient Obstacle our lower Air how dense soever could lay in its way the Strength and Velocity of such a  Meteor  vastly exceeding any such inconsiderable Resistance Yet it is to be noted  That our late Histories of those  Meteors  of this kind whose Heights have been measur'd never give less than Miles Altitude to any of them Whence it appears that the Great and Good Author of Nature  has generally in the Course of his Providence confin'd them to the upper Regions of our Air and preserv'd the lower Parts of it with the Inhabitants of the Earth and Seas from the dismal Effects of them tho' that Confinement and Preservation be provided for by Causes which no way appear to us at present  That we accordingly have no certain Accounts of any great Destruction brought upon Mankind by such  Meteors  excepting that amazing and divine Judgment on  Sodom  and  Gomorrah Admah  and  Zeboim  which the Sacred Scriptures record and to which all the Heathen Accounts also agree The Scriptures describe it thus  Gen xix  Then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah Brimstone and Fire from the Lord out of Heaven And he overthrew those Cities and all the Plain and all the Inhabitants of the Cities and that which grew upon the Ground But Lot's Wife looked back from behind him and she became a Pillar of Salt  v  And the Smoak of the Countrey went up as the Smoak of a Furnace  Which is elsewhere alluded to also by  Moses  in these Words  Deut xxix  The whole Land thereof is Brimstone and burning Salt that it is not sown nor beareth nor any Grass groweth therein like the Overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah Admah and Zeboim which the Lord overthrew in his Anger and in his Wrath  Diodorus Siculus  says that Places near this  Asphaltites  or Lake of  Bitumen  Diodor XIX  are fiery and of an ill Savor and make the Bodies of the Inhabitants sickly and altogether shortliv'd  Strabo  says  Strabo XVI  There are many Indications of a burning Soil herewhich confirm the Tradition of the Inhabitants adjoining which say There were therein of old thirteen Cities the Principal of which was  Sodom  whose Circuit is still shewn of    Furlongs and that the Lake arose from Earthquakes with the Eruptions of Fire and of hot and brimstony Waters whereby the Stones took Fire while some of the Cities were swallowed up and others deserted by those who could get away  Tacitus  says that  Tacit V  vid  Plin v  These Plains are related to have been anciently very fruitful and with great Cities in them but that they were burnt by a Blast of Thunder and Lightening the Footsteps of which remain That the Land looks burnt and has lost its Fertility because all things that grew there whether of their own Accord or by Culture of the Labourer both the Herb and the Flower when they seem nearly ripe become black and empty and seem to vanish away into Ashes  Solinus  says  Solin  c    There is a large Bay that opens itself a great way from  Jerusalem  which was stricken from Heaven as a black Soil that turns into Ashes There were there two Cities  Sodom  and  Gomorrah  by Name the Apple of which Places when it seems to be ripe cannot be chewed for the paring on the outside which is thin contains within nothing but Soot and Ashes which when you press it never so little with your Hand sends out Smoak and vanishes away into Dust dispers'd by the Wind  Now how exactly these Descriptions agree to a Countrey destroy'd by such a terrible  Meteor  as this I dare appeal to all sober and considerate Naturalists while the  Rain of Fire and Brimstone  or of  Brimstone on Fire  with nitrous Salts intermixed is here literally true while the  Smoak like the Smoak of a Furnace  is also literally true it being evident in Fact that all Vulcano's great Guns and such  Meteors  as these directly leave a mighty Smoak after their Explosion while the Salt Lake itself would easily thence arise by the Penetration of such fierce and fiery Particles into the Bowels of a Countrey which was  full of Slimepits  Gen xiv  already and so prepared to take Fire while it would thus easily destroy itself by a  Subversion  an  Overthrow  or an Earthquake and thereupon admit the Waters of the River  Jordan  from the neighbouring  Sea of the Plain  and would infect them with its nitrous and sulphureous Vapours and so become one great  Salt  or  Dead Sea  for all future Generations while the Remains of all this would naturally produce such a barren Soil full of Smoak and Ashes as  we find adjoyning to the Salt Sea by the foregoing Descriptions This nitrosulphureous Shower would also naturally fall on  Lot  's Wife while she stayed a little behind  looking back  as not fully believing God's threatning concerning this terrible Destruction and would not only kill her in an instant but render her Body immediately stiff and fixed in the same Posture wherein she was when it fell on her which is no uncommon Circumstance with us when any Persons have been kill'd by Lightening and which would render her a standing  Pillar of Salt  of Nitrous Salt in a literal Sense however a  Pillar of Salt  for Perpetuity or a lasting Monument of this terrible Judgment for future Generations And so it prov'd for it was still in Being several Years after our Saviour's Death  See  Luk xvii  as the  Jewish  Historian  Josephus  himself assures us  Joseph Antiq  I  and whose Words seem to imply that himself had seen it also  Note That one great ordinary Intention and Use of these Meteors seems to be the same with that of the Tides for the Sea and of Storms whether of Wind or of Thunder and Lightening for the lower Air I mean not only the agitating the Air but chiefly the purging and purifying of it by spending and consuming such noxious Steams and Exhalations as otherwise might be pernicious to Mankind to the Bruit Animals and to the other Inhabitants thereof if such there be I say this seems to me at least  one of the Uses  of Thunder and Lightening both here below and there above without presuming to deny that there may be other Uses of the same or that these as well as other Meteors may be farther intended by Providence for Purposes which we have at present no certain Means of discovering It does not follow that because the fixed Stars are very useful to us in Astronomy that therefore Providence only designed them for that End And the Case is the same in other Instances  Note That there seem to have been of late more uncommon Meteors seen than have been usual  in the like Space of Time Thus we have had at least Eight or Nine of the Meteors of this kind taken Notice of in these Parts of the World within Years while we know not where to find so many in a much longer Space in any elder Histories Thus also there have been more frequent and remarkable  Aurorae Boreales  or  Northern Lights  observ'd within somewhat more than three Years last past than appear in our Historians in a much longer Space To say nothing of that pale Light like Twilight which is chiefly seen between the Horizon and the  Pleiades  about the End of  February  and Beginning of  March  which some have thought to be peculiar to the last or Years Nor can it well be said that all this has happened only by the Negligence of the elder Writers in transmitting such Things to us Since on the contrary they have generally been but over Superstitious in setting down such strange Appearances and of noting how ominous they thought them to Mankind  Note That it no way appears that the frequenter Phaenomena of these sorts have yet had any ill Influence on the natural World The Seasons the Air with the Fruits of the Earth and the living Creatures seeming in general to have received hitherto no Damage thereby And certainly if they tend to purge the Air as I imagine they may have received no small Benefit from them Nay indeed in case they should be deriv'd from any considerable or general Change in our Air of late I should think it more probable that such Change was for the Benefit and Advantage of the same than the contrary  Note That we have no reason to suppose that Comets or Northern Lights or these Meteors before us with the like more unusual Phaenomena of Nature are properly and generally  ominous  or directly forebode any future Judgments to the World or to particular Nations or Parties therein as the Vulgar are apt to imagine They are indeed with other celestial Phaenomena naturally Invitations to the abstracting our Minds from continually poring on things below they call on us to look upwards to the Works of  God that are above us to his superior Providence and to a proper Dependance on him They preach to us this Doctrine That God has it always in his Power to preserve or destroy the World and all the Creatures therein as he pleases and this without any new Miracles But they are I think of themselves and generally speaking no proper Indications of impending Judgments or of God's Will to punish or destroy any Part of his Creatures It may be indeed justly esteem'd a great Sign of the Guilt and conscious Wickedness of Mankind in general that all such extraordinary Phaenomena are still interpreted to the worse Sense as Forerunners of Wars Famines Plagues  c  but they are not I believe any Signs that God is really and particularly at such times bringing those or the like Judgments upon them However I have so fully spoken my Mind of this Matter and of the Limitations and Restrictions thereto belonging in my Account of the former surprising  Meteor March    pag  that I shall not repeat it here but refer the Reader thither who desires farther Satisfaction I conclude with one more important Observation which is this  Note That we ought here to observe and to acknowledge the good Providence of God the great Author of universal Nature of the Air in particular with its surprising Wonders and the great Disposer and Director of them all in usually confining the terrible  Meteors  of this kind to the upper Regions of the Air and not permitting them to descend low enough to hurt us here below And this deserves more particularly our regard because we know of no mechanical Causes that can hinder their Direction downward and because we know that ordinary Thunderblasts are frequently so directed and this sometimes to the terrible Destruction of Buildings and Animals here below Let us but consider what has been above shewn how certainly such a descending Ball or Whirlwind of Fire and Brimstone as this which was a full Mile in Diameter and mov'd at the rate of at least Miles in a Minute might have conquer'd all the Resistance  of our lower Air and in a moment before it could have been in the least foreseen or provided against by any might have destroy'd such a City as  London  it self How inevitably how immediately such a famous Emporium might then have  been as Sodom and like unto Gomorrah  Is  i  and not one Person might have escaped to tell the sad News to the rest of the World This would not seldom be the natural Result of such Blasts here below which are frequently seen above did not the divine Providence by some Means unknown to us restrain their Course and  six them their Bounds which they cannot pass  Ps  civ  and say  hitherto shall ye come and no further  and in such a Place above  shall your proud Waves  or  Blasts be stayed  Job  xxxviii  This is the rational the religious Consequence this is the just and the pious In+ference which the Consideration of such surprizing Meteors such wonderful Works of  him that dwelleth in the Heavens  naturally suggests to us I therefore end my Discourse on this nearly as I did that on the former Meteor  O ye Fire and Heat O ye Lightenings and Clouds O ye Children of Men bless ye the Lord praise and exalt him above all for ever  Song of the three Children  v  POSTSCRIPT  _I Have just now got some good Observations of this Meteor from our famous Observatory at  Greenwich  and what Accounts were there received  viz  that to us about  London  it arose from or but little under the Seven Stars which were then half a Point from the West to the North at the Altitude of ° or ° that it proceeded above ° upon the Horizon till it came under the Sword of  Orion  near the South West and about the Altitude of ° that the time of its Appearance was nearly ′ after and that it lasted about ″ making a hissing Noise as it passed along All which confirms what I have already advanc'd and particularly implies what I have noted above That the Meteor had the greatest Elevation at first or was not much less than Miles high which is nearly the utmost Limit of our Atmosphere that it gradually descended lower till it came over  Devonshire  where it was about Miles high and that where it brake over the Sea and over  Bretaign  in  France  its Altitude could not be very much above Miles  As to the Monastery burnt in  France  it was the Day before the Appearance of this Meteor and so had no Relation to it And the like is to be said of some other Accidents elsewhere none of which appear to have at all been occasion'd by it  WW  May
