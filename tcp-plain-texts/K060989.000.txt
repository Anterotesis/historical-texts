 A True Relation OF THE APPARITION OF ONE Mrs VEAL The next Day after Her DEATH TO ONE Mrs BARGRAVE At  Canterbury  The th of  September    LONDON  Printed for  B Bragg  at the  Black Raven  in  PaterNosterRow    THE PREFACE  THIS relation is Matter of Fact and attended with such Circumstances as may induce any Reasonable Man to believe it It was sent by a Gentleman a Justice of Peace at  Maidstone  in  Kent  and a very Intelligent Person to his Friend in  London  as it is here Worded which Discourse is attested by a very sober and understanding Gentlewoman a Kinswoman of the said Gentlemans who lives in  Canterbury  within a few Doors of the House in whi  the within named Mrs  Bargrave  lives who believes his Kinswoman to be of so discerning a Spirit as not to be put upon by any Fallacy and who possitively assured him that the whole Matter as it is here Related and laid down is what is really True and what She her self had in the same Words as near as may be from Mrs  Bargraves  own Mouth who she knows had no Reason to Invent and publish such a Story nor any design to forge and tell a Lye being a Woman of much Honesty and Virtue and her whole Life a Course as it were of Piety The use which we ought to make of it is to consider That there is a Life to come after this and a Just God who will retribute to every one according to the Deeds done in the Body and therefore to reflect upon our Past course of Life we have led in the World That our Time is Short and Ʋncertain and that if we would escape the Punishment of the Ungodly and receive the Reward of the Righteous which is the laying hold of Eternal Life we ought for the time to come to turn to God by a speedy Repentance ceasing to do Evil and Learning to do Well To seek after God Early if happily he may be found of us and lead such Lives for the future as may be well pleasing in his sight  A RELATION OF THE APPARITION Of Mrs VEAL  THIS thing is so rare in all its Circumstances and on so good Authority that my Reading and Conversation has not given me any thing like it it is fit to gratifie the most Ingenious and Serious Enquirer Mrs  Bargrave  is the Person to whom Mrs  Veal  Appeared after her Death she is my Intimate Friend and I can avouch for her Reputation for these last fifteen or sixteen Years on my own Knowledge and I can confirm the Good Character she had from her Youth to the time of my Acquaintance Tho' since this Relation she is Calumniated by some People that are Friends to the Brother of Mrs  Veal  who Appeared who think the Relation of this Appearance to be a Reflection and endeavour what they can to Blast Mrs  Bargrave  's Reputation and to Laugh the Story out of Countenance▪ But the Circumstances thereof and the Chearful Disposition of Mrs  Bargrave  notwithstanding the unheard of ill Usage of a very Wicked Husband there is not the least sign of Dejection in her Face nor did I ever hear her let fall a Desponding or Murmuring Expression nay not when actually under her Husbands Barbarity which I have been Witness to and several other Persons of undoubted Reputation  Now you must know that Mrs  Veal  was a Maiden Gentlewoman of about Years of Age and for some Years last past had been troubled with Fits which were perceived coming on her by her going off from her Discourse very abruptly to some impertinence She was maintain'd by an only Brother and kept his House in  Dover  She was a very Pious Woman and her Brother a very Sober Man to all appearance But now he does all he can to Null or Quash the Story Mrs  Veal  was intimately acquainted with Mrs  Bargrave  from her Childhood Mrs  Veals  Circumstances were then Mean her Father did not take care of his Children as he ought so that they were exposed to Hardships And Mrs  Bargrave  in those days had as Unkind a Father tho' She wanted for neither Food nor Cloathing whilst Mrs  Veal  wanted for both So that it was in the Power of Mrs  Bargrave  to be very much her Friend in several Instances which mightily endear'd Mrs  Veal  insomuch that she would often say Mrs  Bargrave you are not only the Best but the only Friend I have in the World and no Circumstances of Life shall ever dissolve my Friendship  They would often Condole each others adverse Fortune and read together  Drelincourt upon Death  and other good Books And so like two Christian Friends they comforted each other under their Sorrow  Sometime after Mr  Veals  Friends got him a Place in the CustomHouse at  Dover  which occasioned Mrs  Veal  by little and little to fall off from her Intimacy with Mrs  Bargrave  tho' there was never any such thing as a Quarrel but an Indifferency came on by degrees till at last Mrs  Bargrave  had not seen her in two Years and a half tho' above a Twelve Month of the time Mrs  Bargrave  had been absent from  Dover  and this last half Year has been in  Canterbury  about two Months of the time dwelling in a House of her own  In this House on the Eighth of  September  last  viz  She was sitting alone in the Forenoon thinking over her Unfortunate Life and arguing her self into a due Resignation to Providence tho' her condition seem'd hard And said she  I have been provided for hitherto and doubt not but I shall be still and am well satisfied that my Afflictions shall end when it is most fit for me  And then took up her SewingWork which she had no sooner done but she hears a Knocking at the Door she went to see who it was there and this prov'd to be Mrs  Veal  her Old Friend who was in a Riding Habit At that Moment of Time the Clock struck Twelve at Noon  Madam says Mrs  Bargrave  I am surprized to see you you have been so long a stranger but told her she was glad to see her and offer'd to Salute her which Mrs  Veal  complyed with till their Lips almost touched and then Mrs  Veal  drew her hand cross her own Eyes and said  I am not very well  and so waved it She told Mrs  Bargrave  she was going a Journey and had a great mind to see her first But says Mrs  Bargrave how came you to take a Journey alone I am amaz'd at it because I know you have so fond a Brother  O says Mrs  Veal I gave my Brother the Slip and came away because I had so great a Mind to see you before I took my Journy  So Mrs  Bargrave  went in with her into another Room within the first and Mrs  Veal  sat her self down in an Elbowchair in which Mrs  Bargrave  was sitting when she heard Mrs  Veal  Knock Then says Mrs  Veal My Dear Friend I am come to renew our Old Friendship again and to beg your Pardon for my breach of it and if you can forgive me you are one of the best of Women  O says Mrs  Bargrave don't mention such a thing I have not had an uneasie thought about it I can easily forgive it  What did you think of me says Mrs  Veal  Says Mrs  Bargrave I thought you were like the rest of the World and that Prosperity had made you forget your self and me  Then Mrs  Veal  reminded Mrs  Bargrave  of the many Friendly Offices she did her in former Days and much of the Conversation they had with each other in the time of their Adversity what Books they Read and what Comfort in particular they received from  Drelincourt  's  Book of Death  which was the best she said on that Subject was ever Wrote She also mentioned Dr  Sherlock  and two  Dutch  Books which were Translated Wrote upon Death and several others But  Drelincourt  she said had the clearest Notions of Death and of the Future State of any who have handled that Subject Then she asked Mrs  Bargrave  whether she had  Drelincourt  she said yes Says Mrs  Veal  fetch it and so Mrs  Bargrave  goes up Stairs and brings it down Says Mrs  Veal  Dear Mrs  Bargrave If the Eyes of our Faith were as open as the Eyes of our Body we should see numbers of Angels about us for our Guard The Notions we have of Heaven now are nothing like what it is as  Drelincourt  says Therefore be comforted under your Afflictions and believe that the Almighty has a particular regard to you and that your Afflictions are Marks of Gods Favour And when they have done the business they were sent for they shall be removed from you  And believe me my Dear Friend believe what I say to you  One Minute of future Happiness will infinitely reward you for  all your Sufferings For I can never believe  and claps her Hand upon her Knee with a great deal of Earnestness which indeed ran through all her Discourse  that ever God will suffer you to spend all your Days in this Afflicted State But be assured that your Afflictions shall leave you or you them in a short time  She spake in that Pathetical and Heavenly manner that Mrs  Bargrave  wept several times she was so deeply affected with it Then Mrs  Veal  mentioned Dr  Hornecks Ascetick  at the end of which he gives an account of the Lives of the Primitive Christians  Their Pattern she recommended to our Imitation  and said  their Conversation was not like this of our Age For now  says she  there is nothing but frothy vain Discourse which is far different from theirs Theirs was to Edification and to Build one another up in the Faith So that they were not as we are nor are we as they are but  said she  We might do as they did There was a Hearty Friendship among them but where is it now to be found  Says Mrs Bargrave  'tis hard indeed to find a true Friend in these days  Says Mrs  Veal  Mr  Norris  has a Fine Coppy of Verses call'd  Friendship in Perfection  which I wonderfully admire have you seen the Book says Mrs  Veal  No says Mrs  Bargrave but I have the Verses of my own writing out Have you  says Mrs  Veal then fetch them  which she did from above Stairs and offer'd them to Mrs  Veal  to read who refused and wav'd the thing saying  holding down her Head would make it ake  and then desired Mrs  Bargrave  to read them to her which she did As they were admiring Friendship Mrs  Veal  said Dear Mrs  Bargrave  I shall love you for ever In the Verses there is twice used the Word  Elysium  Ah says Mrs  Veal These Poets have such Names for Heaven  She would often draw her Hand cross her own Eyes and say Mrs  Bargrave Don't you think I am mightily impaired by my Fits  No says Mrs  Bargrave  I think you look as well as ever I knew you  After all this discourse which the Apparition put in Words much finer than Mrs  Bargrave  said she could pretend to and was much more than she can remember for it cannot be thought that an hour and three quarters Conversation could all be retained tho' the main of it she thinks she does She said to Mrs  Bargrave she would have her write a Letter to her Brother and tell him she would have him give Rings to such and such and that there was a Purse of Gold in her Cabinet and that she would have Two Broad Pieces given to her Cousin Watson  Talking at this Rate Mrs  Bargrave  thought that a Fit was coming upon her and so placed  her self in a Chair just before her Knees to keep her from falling to the Ground if her Fits should occasion it for the Elbow Chair she thought would keep her from falling on either side And to divert Mrs  Veal  as she thought she took hold of her Gown Sleeve several times and commended it Mrs  Veal  told her it was a Scower'd Silk and newly made up But for all this Mrs  Veal  persisted in her Request and told Mrs  Bargrave  she must not deny her and she would have her tell her Brother all their Conversation when she had an opportunity Dear Mrs  Veal  says Mrs  Bargrave this seems so impertinent that I cannot tell how to comply with it and what a mortifying Story will our Conversation be to a Young Gentleman  Well says Mrs  Veal I must not be deny'd  Why says Mrs  Bargrave 'tis much better methinks to do it your self  No says Mrs  Veal tho' it seems impertinent to you now you will see more reason for it hereafter  Mrs  Bargrave  then to satisfie her importunity was going to fetch a Pen and Ink but Mrs  Veal  said  let it alone now and do it when I am gone but you must be sure to do it  which was one of the last things she enjoin'd her at parting and so she promised her  Then Mrs  Veal  asked for Mrs  Bargraves  Daughter she said she was not at home but if you have a mind to see her says Mrs  Bargrave  I'le send for her  Do  says Mrs  Veal  On which she left her and went to a Neighbours to send for her and by the Time Mrs  Bargrave  was returning Mrs  Veal  was got without the Door in the Street in the face of the  BeastMarket  on a Saturday which is Market day and stood ready to part as soon as Mrs  Bargrave  came to her She askt her  why she was in such hast  she said  she must be going tho' perhaps she might not go her journey till Monday  And told  Mrs  Bargrave  she hoped she should see her again at her Cousin  Watsons  before she went whether she was a going  Then she said  she would not take her Leave of her  and walk'd from Mrs  Bargrave  in her view till a turning interrupted the sight of her which was three quarters after One in the Afternoon  Mrs  Veal  Dyed the th of  September  at a Clock at Noon of her Fits and had not above four hours Senses before her Death in which time she received the Sacrament The next day after Mrs  Veals  appearing being Sunday Mrs  Bargrave  was mightily indisposed with a Cold and a Sore Throat that she could not  go out that day but on Monday morning she sends a person to Captain  Watsons  to know if Mrs  Veal  were there They wondered at Mrs  Bargraves  enquiry and sent her Word that she was not there nor was expected At this Answer Mrs  Bargrave  told the Maid she had certainly mistook the Name or made some blunder And tho' she was ill sh  put on her Hood and went her self to Captain  Watsons  tho' she knew none of the Family to see if Mrs  Veal  was there or not They said they wondered at her asking for that she had not been in Town they were sure if she had she would have been there Says Mrs  Bargrave I am sure she was with me on Saturday almost two hours  They said it was impossible for they must have seen her if she had In comes Captain  Watson  while they were in Dispute and said that Mrs  Veal  was certainly Dead and her Escocheons were making This strangely surprised Mrs  Bargrave  who went to the Person immediately who had the care of them and found it true Then she related the whole Story to Captain  Watsons  Family and what Gown she had on and how striped And that Mrs  Veal  told her it was Scowred Then Mrs  Watson  cry'd out  you have seen her indeed for none knew but  Mrs  Veal and my self that the Gown was Scowr'd  and Mrs  Watson  own'd that she described the Gown exactly for said she  I helpt her to make it up  This Mrs  Watson  blaz'd all about the Town and avouch'd the Demonstration of the Truth of Mrs  Bargraves  seeing Mrs  Veal  's Apparition And Captain  Watson  carried two Gentlemen immediately to Mrs  Bargraves  House to hear the Relation from her own Mouth And then it spread so fast that Gentlemen and Persons of Quality the Judicious and Sceptical part of the World flock't in upon her which at last became such a Task that she was forc'd to go out of the way For they were in general extreamly satisfyed of the truth of the thing and plainly saw that Mrs  Bargrave  was no Hypochondriack for she always appears with such a chearful Air and pleasing Mien that she has gain'd the favor and esteem of all the Gentry And its thought a great favor if they can but get the Relation from her own Mouth I should have told you before that Mrs  Veal  told Mrs  Bargrave  that her Sister and Brother in Law were just come down from  London  to see her Says Mrs  Bargrave how came you to order matters so strangely it could not be helpt said  Mrs  Veal  and her Sister and Brother did come to see her and  entred the Town of  Dover  just as Mrs  Veal  was expiring Mrs  Bargrave  asked her whether she would not drink some Tea Says Mrs  Veal I do not care if I do But I'le Warrant this Mad Fellow  meaning Mrs  Bargraves  Husband  has broke all your Trinckets  But says Mrs  Bargrave I'le get something to Drink in for all that  but Mrs  Veal  wav'd it and said  it is no matter let it alone  and so it passed  All the time I sat with Mrs  Bargrave  which was some Hours she recollected fresh sayings of Mrs  Veal  And one material thing more she told Mrs  Bargrave  that Old Mr  Breton  allowed Mrs  Veal  Ten pounds a Year which was a secret and unknown to Mrs  Bargrave  till Mrs  Veal  told it her Mrs  Bargrave  never varies in her Story which puzzles those who doubt of the Truth or are unwilling to believe it A Servant in a Neighbours Yard adjoining to Mrs  Bargraves  House heard her talking to some body an hour of the Time Mrs  Veal  was with her Mrs  Bargrave  went out to her next Neighbours the very Moment she parted with Mrs  Veal  and told what Ravishing Conversation she had with an Old Friend and told the whole of it  Drelincourt  's  Book of Death  is since this happened Bought up strangely And it is to be observed that notwithstanding all this Trouble and Fatigue Mrs  Bargrave  has undergone upon this Account she never took the value of a Farthing nor suffer'd her Daughter to take any thing of any Body and therefore can have no Interest in telling the Story  But Mr  Veal  does what he can to stifle the matter and said he would see Mrs  Bargrave  but yet it is certain matter fact that he has been at Captain  Watsons  since the Death of his Sister and yet never went near Mrs  Bargrave  and some of his Friends report her to be a great Lyar and that she knew of Mr  Breton  's Ten Pounds a Year But the Person who pretends to say so has the Reputation of a Notorious Lyar among persons which I know to be of undoubted Repute Now Mr  Veal  is more a Gentleman than to say she Lyes but says a bad Husband has Craz'd her But she needs only to present her self and it will effectually confute that Pretence Mr  Veal  says he ask'd his Sister on her Death Bed whether she had a mind to dispose of any thing and she said No Now what the things which Mrs  Veals  Apparition would have disposed of were so Trifling and nothing of Justice aimed at in their disposal that the design of it appears to me to be only in order to make Mrs  Bargrave  so to demonstrate the Truth of her Appearance as to satisfie the World of the Reality thereof as to what she had seen and heard and to secure her Reputation among the Reasonable and understanding part of Mankind And then again Mr  Veal  owns that there was a Purse of Gold but it was not found in her Cabinet but in a CombBox This looks improbable for that Mrs  Watson  own'd that Mrs  Veal  was so very careful of the Key of her Cabinet that she would trust no Body with it And if so no doubt she would not trust her Gold out of it And Mrs  Veals  often drawing her hand over her Eyes and asking Mrs  Bargrave  whether her Fits had not impair'd her looks to me as if she did it on purpose to remind Mrs  Bargrave  of her Fits to prepare her not to think it strange that she should put her upon Writing to her Brother to dispose of Rings and Gold which lookt so much like a dying Persons Bequest and it took accordingly with Mrs  Bargrave  as the effect of her Fits coming upon her and was one of the many Instances of her Wonderful Love to her and Care of her that she should nor be affrighted which indeed appears in her whole management particularly in her coming to her in the day time waving the Salutation and when she was alone and then the manner of her parting to prevent a second attempt to Salute her  Now why Mr  Veal  should think this Relation a Reflection as 'tis plain he does by his endeavouring to stifle it I can't imagine because the Generality believe her to be a good Spirit her Discourse was so Heavenly Her two great Errands were to comfort Mrs  Bargrave  in her Affliction and to ask her Forgiveness for her Breach of Friendship and with a Pious Discourse to encourage her So that after all to suppose that Mrs  Bargrave  could Hatch such an Invention as this from  FridayNoon  till  SaturdayNoon  supposing that she knew of Mrs  Veals  Death the very first Moment without jumbling Circumstances and without any Interest too she must be more Witty Fortunate and Wicked too than any indifferent Person I dare say will allow I asked Mrs  Bargrave  several times  If she was sure she felt the Gown  She answered Modestly  if my Senses be to be relied on I am sure of it  I asked her  If she heard a Sound when she clapt her Hand upon her Knee  She said  she did not remember she did  And she said  she Appeared to be as much a Substance as I did who talked with her And I may  said she  be as soon persuaded that your Apparition is talking to me now as that I did not really see her for I was under no  manner of Fear I received her as a Friend and parted with her as such I would not  says she  give one Farthing to make any one believe it I have no Interest in it nothing but trouble is entail'd upon me for a long time for ought that I know and had it not come to Light by Accident it would never have been made Publick  But now she says  she will make her own Private Ʋse of it and keep her self out of the way as much as she can  And so she has done since She says  she had a Gentleman who came thirty Miles to her to hear the Relation and that she had told it to a Room full of People at a time  Several particular Gentlemen have had the Story from Mrs  Bargraves  own Mouth  This thing has very much affected me and I am as well satisfied as I am of the best grounded Matter of Fact And why should we dispute Matter of Fact because we cannot solve things of which we can have no certain or demonstrative Notions seems strange to me Mrs  Bargraves  's Authority and Sincerity alone would have been undoubted in any other Case  FINIS

Applause And its bearing so great a Character in this Relation the Impression is near Sold off
