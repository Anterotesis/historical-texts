Simpson as I informed my Readers in the Second Part of the Two Shoemakers had resolved to work together one hour every evening in order to p  for Tommy Williams's schooling This circumstance brought them to be a good deal together when the rest of the men were gone home Now it happened that Mr Stock had a mighty way o  endeavouring to turn all common events to some use and he thought it right on the present occa+sion to make the only return in his power to Will Simpson for his great kindness "For" said he "if Will gives up so much of his time to hel  me to provide for this poor boy it is the least can do to try to turn part of that time to the pu  +pose of promoting Will's spiritual good" No  as the bent of Stock's own mind was religious was easy to him to lead their talk to somethin  profitable He always took especial care how+ever that the subject should be introduced pro+perly cheerfully and without constraint As  well knew that great good may be sometimes done by a prudent attention in seizing proper opportunities so he knew that the cause of piety had been sometimes hurt by forcing serious subjects where here was clearly no disposition to receive them say he had found out that two things were neces  ary to the promoting of Religion among his friends warm zeal to be always on the watch for occa  ions and a cool judgment to distinguish which vas the right time and place to make use of them To know  how  to do good is a great matter but to  now  when  to do it is no small one  Simpson was an honest goodnatured fellow he was now become sober and rather religiously disposed But he was ignorant he did not know  uch of the grounds of Religion or of the cor  uption of his own nature he was regular at Church  ut was first drawn thither rather by his skill in  salmsinging than by any great devotion He had  eft off going to the Greyhound and often read the Bible or some other good book on the Sunday  vening This he thought was quite enough he  hought the Bible was the prettiest history book in  he world and that Religion was a very good thing or Sundays But he did not much understand what business people had with it on working days He had left off drinking because it had brought Williams to the grave and his wise to dirt and  ags but not because he himself had seen the evil  f sin He now considered swearing and Sabbath  reaking as scandalous and indecent but he had  ot found out that both were to be left off because  hey are highly offensive to GOD and grieve his Holy Spirit As Simpson was less selfconceited  than most ignorant people are Stock had alway  a good hope that when he should come to be be  +ter acquainted with the word of GOD and wi  the evil of his own heart he would become o  day a good Christian The great hindrance w  that he fancied himself so already  One evening Simpson had been calling to Stock  mind how disorderly the house and shop when they were now sitting quietly at work had formerly been and he went on thus  Will  How comfortably we live now master to what we used to do in Williams's time I used then never to be happy but when we were keep+ing it up all night but now I am as merry as the day is long I find I am twice as happy since I am grown good and sober  Stock  I am glad you are happy Will and I rejoice that you are sober but I would not have yo  take too much pride in your own goodness for fea  it should become a sin almost as great as some o  those you have left off Besides I would not have you make quite so sure that you  are  good  Will  Not good master why don't you find me regular and orderly at work  Stock  Very much so and accordingly I have a great respect for you  Will  I pay every one his own seldom miss Church have not been drunk since Williams died have handsome cloaths for Sundays and save  trifle every week  Stock  Very true And to all this you may add that you very generously work an hour for poo  Tommy's education every evening without fee o  reward  Will  Well master what can a man do more▪  f all this is not being good I don't know what  Stock  All these things are very right as far as  ey go and you could not well be a Christian  ithout doing them But I shall make you stare  erhaps when I tell you you may do all these  ings and many more and yet be no Christian  Will  No Christian surely master I do hope that  fter all I have done you will not be so unkind as  say I am no Christian  Stock  GOD forbid that I should say so Will I  ope better things of you But come now what  o you think it is to be a Christian  Will  What why to be christened when one is a  hild to learn the Catechism when one can read  be confirmed when one is a youth and to go  Church when one is a man  Stock  These are all very proper things and  ite necessary They make a part of a Christian's  se But for all that a man may be exact in them  l and yet not be a Christian  Will  Not be a Christian ha ha ha you are  ery comical master  Stock  No indeed I am very serious Will At is rate it would be a very easy thing to be a  hristian and every man who went through certain  rms would be a good man and one man who  oserved these forms would be as good as another Whereas if we come to examine ourselves by the  ord of GOD I am afraid there are but few com  ratively whom our Saviour would allow to be  al Christians What is your notion of a Chris  an's practice  Will  Why he must not rob nor murder nor  get drunk He must avoid scandalous things and do as other decent orderly people do  Stock  It is easy enough to be what the world calls a Christian but not to be what the Bible calls so  Will  Why master we working men are not expected to be saints and martyrs and apostles and ministers  Stock  We are not And yet Will there ar  not two sorts of Christianity we are called to prac+tise the same Religion which they practised an  something of the same spirit is expected in  which we reverence in them It was not sain  and martyrs only to whom our Saviour said tha  they must "crucify the world with it's affection and lusts" We are called to "be holy" in  measure and degree "as he who hath called  is holy" It was not only saints and martyrs w  were told that they must be "likeminded  Christ"That "they must do all to the glory  God"That they must renounce the spirit of  world and deny themselves" It was not to apost  only that Christ said "they must have their co  +versation in Heaven" It was not to a few ho  men set apart for the altar that he said "they  set their affections on things above"That th  "must not be conformed to the world""No  was to Fishermen to Publicans to Farmers to D  labourers to poor Tradesmen that he spoke wh  he told them they must love not the world nor  things of the world""That they must renou  the hidden things of dishonesty grow in grace  up for themselves treasures in Heaven"  Will  All this might be very proper for them  be taught because they had not been bred  Christians but Heathens or Jews and Christ wanted to make them his followers that is Christians But thank God we do not want to be taught  ll this for we  are  Christians born in a Christian  ountry of Christian parents  Stock  I suppose then you fancy that Christianity  omes to people in a Christian country by nature  Will  I think it comes by a good education or  good example When a fellow who has got any  ense sees a man cut off in his prime by drinking  think he will begin to leave it off When he  ees another man respected like you master for ho  esty and sobriety and going to Church why he  ill grow honest and sober and go to Church that  he will see it is his advantage to be a Chris  an  Stock  Will What you say is the truth but  is not the whole truth You are right as far as you  o but you do not go far enough The worldly  dvantages of piety are as you suppose in gene  l great Credit prosperity and health almost  aturally attend on a religious life both because  religious life supposes a sober and industrious  fe and because a man who lives in a course of  aty puts himself in the way of God's blessing  ut a true Christian has a still higher aim in  ew and will follow Religion even under cir  mstances when it may hurt his credit and ruin  s prosperity if it should ever happen to be the  ll of God that he should be brought into such a  ing state  Will  Well master to speak the truth if I go  Church on Sundays and follow my work in  e week I must say I think that is being good  Stock  I agree with you that he who does both  gives the best outward signs that he is good But our going to Church and even reading the Bible are no proofs that we are as good as we need be but rather that we do both these in order to make us better than we are We do both on Sundays as means by God's blessing to make us better all the week We are to bring the fruits of that Chapter or of that Sermon into our daily life and try to get our inmost heart and secret thoughts as well as our daily conduct amended by them  Will  Why sure master you won't be so unreasonable as to want a body to be religious always I can't do that neither I'm not such a hypocrite as to pretend to it  Stock  Yes you can in every action of your life  Will  What master always to be thinking about Religion  Stock  No far from it Will much less to be always talking about it But you must be always acting under it's power and spirit  Will  But surely 'tis pretty well if I do this when I go to Church or while I am saying my prayers Even you master as strict as you are would not have me always on my knees nor always at Church I suppose for then how would your work be carried on and how would our town be supplied with shoes  Stock  Very true Will 'Twould be no proof of our Religion to let our customers go barefoot but 'twould be a proof of our laziness and we should starve as we ought to do The business of the world must not only be carried on but carried on with spirit and activity We have the same authority for not being "slothful in business as we have for being fervent in spirit" Religion has  ut Godliness and laziness as wide asunder as any  wo things in the world and what God has sepa  ated let no man pretend to join Indeed the  pirit of religion can have no fellowship with sloth  dolence and selfindulgence But still a Chris  an does not carry on his common trade quite like  nother man neither For something of the spirit  hich he labours to attain at Church he carries  ith him into his worldly concerns While there  re some who set up for Sunday Christians who  ave no notion that they are bound to be Week  ay Christians too  Will  Why master I do think if God Almighty  contented with one day in seven he won't thank  ou for throwing him the other six into the bargain  thought he gave us them for our own use and I  m sure nobody works harder all the week than  ou do  Stock  God it is true sets apart one day in even for actual rest from labour and for more im  ediate devotion to his service But shew me that  ext wherein he says thou shalt love the Lord thy God on  Sundays  Thou shalt keep my command  ents on the  Sabbath Day  To be carnally minded  n  Sundays is death  Cease to do evil and learn  o do well  one day in seven  Grow in grace on the  Lord's Day  Is there any such text  Will  No to be sure there is not for that would  e encouraging sin in all the other days  Stock  Yes just as you do when you make Re  gion a thing for the Church and not for the world There is no one lawful calling in pursuing which we  ay not serve GOD acceptably You and I may  erve him while we are stitching this pair of Boots  armer Furrow while he is plowing yonder field  Betsy West over the way whilst she is nursing her sick mother Neighbour Incle in measuring out him tapes and ribbons I say all these may serve God just as acceptably in those employments as at Church I had almost said more so  Will  Aye indeedhow can that be Now you're too much on t'other side  Stock  Because a man's trials in trade being often greater they give him fresh means of glorifying God and proving the sincerity of his religion A man who mixes in business is naturally brought into continual temptations and difficulties These will lead him if he be a good man to look more to GOD than he perhaps would otherwise do He sees temptations on the right hand and on the left he knows that there are snares all around him this makes him watchful he feels that the enemy within is too ready to betray him this makes him humble himself while a sense of his own difficulties make him tender to the failings of others  Will  Then you would make one believe after all that trade and business must be sinful in itself since it brings a man into all these snares and scrapes  Stock  No no Will trade and business don't create evil passionsthey were in the heart before Only now and then they seem to lie snug a littleour concerns with the world bring them out into action a little more and thus shew both others and ourselves what we really are But then as the world offers more trials on the one hand so on the other it holds out more duties If we are called to battle oftener we have more opportunities o  victory Every temptation resisted is an enemy subdued and he that ruleth his own spirit is better than he that taketh a city  Will  I don't quite understand you master  Stock  I will try to explain myself There is no assion more called out by the transactions of trade  an covetousness Now 'tis impossible to with  and such a master sin as that without carrying a  ood deal of the spirit of religion into one's trade  Will  Well I own I don't yet see how I am to  e religious when I'm hard at work or busy settling  n account I can't do two things at once 'tis as  f I were to pretend to make a shoe and cut out a  oot at the same moment  Stock  I tell you both must subsist together Nay  he one must be the motive to the other GOD commands us to be industrious and if we love  im the desire of pleasing him should be the main  pring of our industry  Will  I don't see how I can always be thinking  bout pleasing GOD  Stock  Suppose now a man had a wife and children whom he loved and wished to serve would  ot he be often thinking about them while he was at work and though he would not be  always  thinking about them yet would not the very love he  bore them be a constant spur to his industry He would always be pursuing the same course from the same motive though his words and even his thoughts must often be taken up in the common transactions of life  Will  Well I say first one then the other now for labour now for religion  Stock  I will shew that both must go together I will suppose you were going to buy so many skins of our currierthat is quite a worldly transaction you can't see what a spirit of religion has to do with buying a few calves' skins Now I tell you  it has a great deal to do with it Covetousness a desire to make a good bargain may rise up in your heart Selfishness a spirit of monopoly a wish to get all in order to distress others these are evil desires and must be subdued Some opportunity of unfair gain offers in which there may be much sin and yet little scandal Here a Christian will stop short he will recollect that "he who maketh haste to be rich shall hardly be innocent" Perhaps the sin may be on the side of your dealer  be  may want to overreach  you  this is provokingyou are tempted to violent anger perhaps to swear Here is a fresh demand on you for a spirit of patience and moderation as there was before for a spirit of justice and selfdenial If by God's grace you get the victory over these temptations you are the better man for having been called out to them Always provided that the temptation be not of your own seeking If you give way and sink under these temptations don't go and say that trade and business have made you covetous passionate and prosane No no depend upon it you were so before you would have had all these evil seeds lurking in your heart if you had been loitering about at home and doing nothing with the additional sin of idleness into the bargain When you are busy the devil often tempts you when you are idle you tempt the devil If business and the world call these evil tempers into action business and the world call that Religion into action too which teaches us to resist them And in this you see the Weekday fruit of the Sunday's piety 'Tis trade and business in the Week which call us to put our Sunday readings praying and Church going into practice  Will  Well Master you have a comical way  ome how of coming over one I never should  ave thought there would have been any religion vanted in buying and selling a few calves' skins But I begin to see there is a good deal in what  ou sayAnd whenever I am doing a common action I will try to remember that it must be done 'after a Godly sort"  Stock  I hear the clock strike ninelet us leave off our work I will only observe farther that one good end of our bringing Religion into our busi  ess is to put us in mind not to undertake more  usiness than we can carry on consistently with our Religion I shall never commend that man's diligence though it is often commended by the world who is not diligent about the salvation of his soul We are as much forbidden to be overcharged with  he  cares  of life as with it's  pleasures  I only wish  o prove to you that a discreet Christian may be wise for both worlds that he may employ his hands without entangling his soul and labour for the heat that perisheth without neglecting that which  ndureth unto eternal life that he may be prudent or time while he is wise for eternity  Z  THE HYMN  I  O THAT the Lord wou'd guide my ways  To keep his statutes still  O that my GOD wou'd give
