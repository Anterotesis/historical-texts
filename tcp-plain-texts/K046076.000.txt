 THE Tears of the Muses IN A CONFERENCE BETWEEN Prince  GERMANICUS  AND A Malecontent Party  LONDON  Printed for T WARD near  Paternoster Row  MDCCXXXVII  TO THE Right Honorable and PublickSpirited The  President Officers  and  Committee  OF THE SOCIETY FOR  Encouragement  of LEARNING  My Lords and Gentlemen  LEST it shou'd be consider'd as a Disregard of Propriety when a Poem of a  Satirical  Species is address'd to the Patronage most distinguish'd for Extent of Humanity please to receive it as a poetical  Janus  of whose Opposite two Faces the fairest and best drawn you will find to be  Panegyric    BUT on That Side you were  attach'd  And such devoted Admirers of the  Life  wou'd with Difficulty have been brought to allow a  Resemblance  in the  Picture  Whereas on the Side of the  Satire  you cou'd not possibly  be Parties concerned and were therefore best qualify'd to judge it impartially  YET since it is not by any Merit of mine that you are so safe on the Satirical Quarter It was fit I shou'd do  something  that might have room to expect your Acknowledgment I have therefore declin'd any  Encomium  on your generous Society or on Any of its particular Members tho' to Every Reader  not such  It wou'd have increas'd the  Delight  of the Poem  BUT You are such Enemies to every Kind of  Corruption  that I apprehended the very Appearance of an Attempt at evading your  Judgment  by engaging your  Generosity  in my Favour  IN this Situation there are preserv'd to you all the natural Rights of the  Critic  Yet I am under no Pain from the Use you may make of that Freedom For what candid Writer wou'd wish to escape a Reproach where being sure of its  Justice  he can be made but the Wiser from Effect of its  Severity  And as to the more desirable  Reverse  of the Prospect no Man is in Danger of missing your  Approbation  unless he has no where  deserved  it  THE  Muses  have used you too kindly not to expect your  Concern  for the Fate you will find 'em reduc'd to And to hear of  your  Grief and good Wishes in their Behalf may from the Knowledge they have of your  Consequence    deserve to be thought little less than a  Balance  for the Neglect they are under from Thousands  BUT to speak a plain Truth without  Metaphor  whatever Advantage the Poetical World wou'd have deriv'd from imaginary  Muses  might be  really  an Effect of some such confederate Influence as yours in good Earnest exerted  HOW many great and desirable Changes in literate Taste may we not reasonably expect from the associated Prevalence of Numbers united as  you  are upon the most generous Principle in Nature an unprofitable and voluntary Pursuit of the Benefit of Others from Effect of your own Cost and Labour  TO instance in One the most obvious and easy of many How soon wou'd our present low Relish for  dramatical Buffoonery  give Way to your  nobler Example  persevering indeed with some necessary Obstinacy to applaud and support good  Tragedy  and  Comedy  till what is now but mere  Reason  might have the Honour to be consider'd as  Fashion  by Concurrence of your munificent Endeavours but for one or two short Winters  AND yet what a National Deliverance were ThisWith what Effusion of  unmercenary  Gratitude would it immortalize those generous Conquerors who protecting the noblest of our Youth from bad Principles had by  expelling Meanspiritedness Corruption and Folly from our  Theatres  intercepted them in their Passage upward into Situations whence their Effects extended wider become in Proportion more dreadful  WHATEVER Misconceptions have arisen with View to your more immediate and particular good Purpose from its Relation to the  Profession  of a considerable Body in Trade whose Interest may appear to be concern'd not in the  Intention  but  Effect  of your Establishment There will never I am persuaded lie any Objection at all against this opener and easier Road to the Redemption of one Branch of Polite Learning that stands in too visible Need of your Patronage  AND now since All the Motive I had to this distant Address was the Pleasure of professing in public my Respect for so  public  a  Spirit  you will forgive me that I withhold from your Knowledge a Discovery of so little Importance as the  Name  of  My Lords and Gentlemen  Your devoted Humble Servant  The Author  ADVERTISEMENT TO THE READER  NOT assuming such an Air of Authority as to give Rules much less  Examples  of Writing the Author in the following Verses intended no more than an humble Attempt from mere private Curiosity upon an Idea of  Satire  which appear'd to be  New  or not  practis'd    There is indeed something so like  Cruelty  in the  Face  of that Species of Poetry that it can only be reconcil'd to  Humanity  by the general Benevolence of its  Purpose  attacking Particulars for the Public Advantage  But methinks It gives up this  End  which is Reformation when mistaking the  Means  It attempts the good Work with a Hand either too  rough  or too  gentle    In the first Case It  corrodes  where It professes to  cure  In the second It is only sportive and wanton with what It shou'd  correct  and discountenance  The  Medium  perhaps might be found in an Art like that of the  Painters  who by opposing their  Shades  against  LIGHTS  call out Darkness into open Distinction  So Enormities which  Satirists  wou'd censure are but dimly and imperfectly mark'd till the  Defect  admits Disgrace from the Neighbourhood of  Perfection  Then Contempt stings more scarply in  One  by the compar'd Admiration of the  Other  Besides that the Censur'd are driven at the same Time from their la  t little Refuge of Vanity and can no longer recriminate upon the Censurer his  Illnature  and Malevolence of Purpose  I am afraid there is another Particular that calls aloud for the Regard of the  Satirist  and That is a Reflexion how far Decency may make it a  Duty  to abandon his personal Self and insinuate Opinions with  Modesty  I mean from the Mouth of some  figurative Speaker  whom He ought to  suppose  of more Consequence and whose Sentiments the Reader will  be sure  to receive with less Scruple  There is a Meaning in the very  Name  of a  Poet  that shou'd seem to prescribe us this Duty And the Use and Necessity of  Invention  can never be more manifest than where the Subject is so  vidious as  Satire    Who is there to say Truth so unguilty of the Follies of Life that he dares in his own proper Person stand out and  justify  the Right he assumes of reproaching the Conduct of Others  Reproof is too bitter a Potion to be welcome from our Sense of its  Use  And the administring Hand shou'd be  dear  not  disgustful  if it would incline us to taste it with Pleasure  I thought it but necessary to prefix this short Note to an Essay toward a  New Kind of Satire  I will not pretend to assert my own System because it is the most probable Thing in the World that I shou'd conceive a  mistaken Idea  Yet since by frequent Attempts and Miscarriages there are started at least some good  Hints  He whose false Steps have contributed either to the Caution or Direction of Others may be said to have  err'd with Good Fortune    THE Tears of the Muses A POEM  GERMANICUS  for Love and Empire born  At once to  govern  Kingdoms and  adorn    Too good for Greatness but that Kings can  bless    Too firm for Fear but of his  Friend  's Distress  Foretemp'ring Pow'r by Reason's generous Plan  To task the  Monarch  meditates the  Man    IN a Town Grove whence Dryads  Noise  exclude  And hush loud Streets to Sylvan Solitude  Veil'd by a verdant Skreen's incircling Shade  Whose angly Sides eight arching Lights pervade  Friend to Mankind their pensive Fav'rite stood  Revolving previous Plans of purpos'd Good  SOFT to his Sight a  Female Suppliant  press'd  In all the speaking Marks of Mis'ry dress'd  Downlook'd relax'd of Mien oft bending low  Now stopping short now readvancing slow  Pardon she cry'd th' intruding Sighs of Grief  Hope is the friendless Wretche's  last  Relief  GERMANICUS  who when Distress draws nigh  Catches quick Sorrow from the Suff'rer's Eye  With gentle Waft invites her back'ning Fears  And smiles the Warmth of Pity on her Tears  Her while advancing heedful he survey'd  Chance stretch'd his Eye to the remoter Shade  Where dimly obvious from the bord'ring Wood  Dark'ning the Arches Eight new Phantoms stood  All like the First thin Forms of shivering Woe  Wept Allin dumb sad solemn circly Show  THINK cry'd th' Approacher prostrate at his Feet  How sharp is Insult and Relief how sweet  Pity a wretched Sisterhood of Tears  Nine friendless Mourners whom no Comfort chears  All Arts were Ours that polish'd Life cou'd gain  But Arts and polish'd Life were Ours in vain  See what Reward wish'd Knowledge cou'd impart  Where Fool is Fashion Ignorance is  Art    Urg'd by Derision and escaping Hate  We sad slow Exiles seek some gentler Fate  To the bleak  North's  newrising Coasts we go  Less  cold  than These amidst eternal  Snow    Glory's gay Beams to whose felt Warmth we run  More than supply the Absence of their Sun  There mourning Merit cannot miss Relief  Where watchful  Pow'r  supplants  prevented  Grief  Fam'd for Munificence Thy princely Hand  Singly  absolves  an unbestowing Land  Ah Save the FriendlessHelp the Wrong'd away  Too  poor  to go yet too  unlov'd  to stay  Pay  but wish'd  Passage  from this cruel Shore  And never never will we trust it more  SCARCE had th' imploring Accents voic'd her Pray'r  When the known Sounds and recollected Air  Through the false Semblance natively convey'd  To the charm'd Prince a speaking  Muse  betray'd  Round while uncrediting the storied Woe  His curious Eyes discov'ring Glances throw  Th' examin'd Umbrage as he turn'd reveal'd  Each  Muse  that every distant Arch conceal'd  Waiting impatient for the finish'd Tale  Quit your vain Hope he cry'd by  Want's  thin Veil  Unhid  to 'scape the Rev'rence of my Zeal  Who all your Power through all your Changes feel  JOYFUL He snatch'd th' Implorer from the Ground  Then turning graceful bow'd progressive round  Press'd their joint Access undisguis'd and gay  And shone receptive of each effluent Ray  SEATED and circled by the beamy Train  Their Shapes resuming and Themselves again  Tell me said HeYe Soulinspiring  Nine  Ye living Fires that give the Great to  shine  Who quick'ning Regal Courage into Flame  Guide it by Justice to immortal Fame  Why wou'd ye  leave  a Land distinguish'd long  For Love of Valour and for Hate of Wrong  Where Freedom unrestrain'd her Empire holds  And Legal Monarchy new Bloom unfolds  HE paus'dand CLIO answering thus began  Perish pale  Malice  It oblit'rates  Man    Where Envy  blasts  the Muse inspires in vain  No human Culture there extends its Reign  Lost in Malignity by civil Hate  Virtues that clash with Virtues curse a State  Stifled in Faction Arts unfriended sink  Or pigmy'd into partial Flatt'ry shrink  Hist'ry  must blush the Wiles of  Spleen  to pen  And grace the bloodless Broils of angry Men  SMOTHER'D in  Self  there breathes no public Soul  Where sep'rate Strugglings gen'ral Strength controul  There Policy's old gen'rous Straitness  bends    And shifting  Medium  crawls to sidelong Ends  There Fraud  triumphant  tempts the Just to fall  And every one Man's Gain is Loss to All  There Love internal checking Sighs that roam  Begins and ends all Charityat Home  Each Pray'r appropriates one Man's modest Aim  And humbly trusts to  God  the Common Claim  Crush'd by Contempt of Praise  Exertion  dies  And Public Spirit laugh'd at shuns to rise  THITHER when Hope misleads th' Historic Muse  Swift let her seek some Scene of nobler Views  Where guileless Pow'r no Praise to  Graft  ascribes  Where Courage scorns  Deceit  and Duty  Bribes    Where nervous Meaning dares  directly  speak  And crooked Windings teach no Truth to  sneak    'TIS  found  for seeThe icy  Pole  dissolves  Honour's new Warmth with sunny Force evolves  There glows  Event  There more than  Roman  Arms  Clash their  prophetic  Thunder's fear'd Alarms  There the puls'd Public beats in ev'ry Vein  Strong to one Purpose lifts with equal Strain  No  vile  Pretension there at  Titles  aims  No Prideswoln Lumber  lazy Lordship  shames  There shines the  Sword  in Honour's guarded Track  No Knighthood blushes on a  Miser  's Back  No bought Emblaz'nings Eminence efface  No dirty Dignity sublimes Disgrace  There  Heroes  multiply and labouring Fame  Grows busyto record each sparkling Name  SHE ceas'dThe Prince his Patriot Eyes withdrew  Weigh'd the long Charge and wish'd it Half untrue  Sigh'd at the Waste domestic Discord made  And mourn'd unfriended Arts by Spleen betray'd  Then view'd the Sisters reprepar'd to hear  While ERATO soft sighing charm'd his Ear  LUR'D said the  am'rous  Muse from Realms above  Pleas'd I descended on this Land of  Love    Look'd  and  approv'd  and form'd aerial Schemes  Of heartfelt Tyes and Hope's elusive Dreams  Vainly propos'dEach Sex by Each to mend  And smooth the rugged Paths of Life with  Friend    Snatch'd at  One  sweet Example  New  to  Fame    Urg'd its dear Pow'r th'  Unhappier  to reclaim  Misguided Millions hail'd th' acknowledg'd Charms  And lov'd Perfection when it bless'd  Thy  Arms  But ah too lost a Length  Themselves  were gone  They worship'd and confess'dbut still  sinn'd  on  Yet I vain Hoper Still new Helps apply  And ever failing wou'd for ever  try    To slighted Beauty wou'd new Powers impart  And stretch the aided Empire of the Heart  Teach Man that Woman's Strength in Softness lies  Teach Woman why the Modest charm the Wise  Useless to Either I from Both remove  Money  's th' inspiring  Muse  of modish Love  O'er Truth and Passion Avarice prevails  All Vows are venal and all Sighs are  Sales    Int'rest and Vanity and Self disarm  Mutual Esteem till neither Sex can charm  Then blanc unnat'ral Whims pervert Desire  Attraction failing they exchange  Attire    Then Man's  lac'd Lightness  apes the Lady's Air  And bluff big Boldness  masculates  the Fair  With changing Sexes Love's lost Motives change  From Wish to Wish the shortliv'd Passions range  Recorded Constancy becomes  Romance  And among Millions Two may loveby Chance  WHY should I then supporting present Scorn  Stretch my too patient Hope to Times unborn  When to the  North  where Nature shines unstain'd  Confiding Sexes love with Faith unfeign'd  Their native Beauties in no Clime excell'd  To rising Force by conscious Worth impell'd  While through the sparkling Eye taught Spirit breaks  And the felt Lustre of their Fame partakes  THE Lover Prince unwillingly believ'd  Faults which his nobler Nature scarce conceiv'd  Touch'd for the Honour of the Human Heart  His own glow'd painful with ideal Smart  When loftier Accents from URANIA broke  And snatch'd his list'ning Soul while  Science  spoke  FROM Heav'n's unsounded Depth she cry'd I stole  Angelic Fire and form'd a NEWTON's  Soul    Taught him the secret Walks of God to tread  And 'twixt the starry Worlds his Spirit led  All  Aether  op'ning to a Mortal's Eyes  Till Earth sent Colonies and held the Skies  What King for This magnificently just  Bless'd him in Life or dignified his Dust  What voted Honours  mark  th' Aspirer's Race  What  thinking Statues  emulate his Face  He who immortaliz'd his Country's Name  Beyond Ten Thousand  Conqu'rors  bounded Fame  He who to lift Mankind new Heav'ns display'd  And every Human Breather nobler made  Did He to public Fame All Nature raise  And is He poorly left to private Praise  In such a Land ah what can Arts expect  What Claim has hopeless Science but Neglect  O Fate of wintry Worth by Climate cross'd  Budding untimely to be nip'd in Frost  NEWTON has multiplied the  Suns  yet pours  In vain the Light of all their Orbs on Ours  When will th' incurious Courts for which He found  New Worlds find Will to trace an Old one round  What promis'd Pension ships th' unshaken Soul  To dare Discov'ry and ungloom the Pole  What coasting Keel indenting  Southern  Strands  Starts the long Shores of Cloudbenighted Lands  No annual Bounty persevering kind  Draws the dark Veil that covers half Mankind  What regal Influ'nce easing Learning's Birth  Now adds new Stars to Heav'n or Arts to Earth  Who  sows Munificence to root up Sloth  And call forth Harvests of eternal Growth  HAIL to the Land where War makes  Science  Room  Where Realms from Desarts rise and Ruins bloom  Where Conquest spreading to embrace Distress  Lets loose Ambition not to waste but bless  There Pow'r inverts Destruction into  Birth    And the  prolific  Sword empeoples Earth  There Desolation fruitful in Decay  Fades into Opulence and strengthens Sway  There Ports unnative indrawn Seas confine  And climbing Streams o'er channel'd Mountains shine  There public Splendor  swallows  private Pride  And Claims which All Men share in All Men  guide    There Art rewarded strains excited Skill  Till dazling Wonders wid'ning Empire fill  The fierce free  Tartar  sees the  Tartar taught    Grins at advancing  Rule  and pants for  Thought    Then in long Link new Nations forward draw  And the drain'd Wilds of Nature crowd to  Law    Hail

the ravish'd Ear quick Transports bound  Tim'd to the tuneful Voice each trembling Tree  Strain'd its tugg'd Roots and labour'd to be free  Warm'd through the wak'ning  Stone  the sculptur'd Ear  Of every starting Statue seem'd to  hear    Air catch'd and length'ning back the mazy Notes  Curls while the undulating Music floats  Earth list'ning to  inhale  harmonious Pain  Sigh'd it in soft Vibration back again  PARDON a mourning Muse that leaves with Tears  The Land that lov'd GERMANICUS endears  But ah what Toils what Anguish shalt thou bear  What endless Labour must o'erload thy Care  Ere thy lost Views a Taste like Thine inspire  And sparkling Kingdoms catch Thy manly Fire  NEAR  Opera  's fribling  Fugues  what Muse can stay  Where wordless Warblings winnow  Thought  away  Music when  Purpose  points her not the Road  Charms to betray and softens to  corrode    Empty of Sense the Soulseducing Art  Thrills a slow Poison to the sick'ning Heart  Soft sinks  Idea  dissolute in Ease  And all Life's feeble Lesson is to  please    Spirit and Taste and generous Toil take Flight  And lazy Love and indolent Delight  And low luxurious Weariness of Pain  Lull the lost Mindand all its Powers are vain  HENCE to the Realms of  Fame  ye Muses fly  There to the Drum's big Beat the Heart leaps high  There sighing Flutes but temp'ring Martial Heat  Teach distant Pity and Revenge to  meet    The manly Pipe there scorns th' expanded  Shakes    That wind wav'd Nothings till Attention  akes    There  now  concurring Keys and Chords increase  The Heart's soft social Tyes and cherish  Peace    Then  Trumpets answ'ring Trumpets shrill and far  Swell to the sounding Wind th' inspiring  War    There the rows'd Soul in Exercise grows strong  Nor  pools  to puddly Foulness stopp'd too long  Strength'ning and strengthned by the Poet's Fire  There Music's meaning Voice  exalts  Desire  There Harmony not drowns but quickens Thought  And Fools unfeeling Words by Notes are  caught    SOFT sigh'd the Prince for suff'ring Music pain'd  And POLYHYMNIA rising warm complain'd  Deign to be told Impartial Gen'rous Wise  Why fruitless  Eloquence  indignant flies  Gall'd at lost Time in Cases vainly clear'd  At Truths  untouching  and at Sounds  unheard    Blushing while Oratory's lab'ring Strains  On  Praedecision  waste derided Pains  And flourish'd Periods to no Purpose  fine    Like Suns in Desarts without  Notice  shine  Hating  grave  Insult I disdain to stay  Where Talk but trifles and where Tropes but play  If serious Rhet'ric sweats where sneering  Mutes  Hast'ning the hurried  Question  crop Disputes  If  Law  sells Argument yet  Forms  must reign  And Custom pleading Equity is vain  If the dark  Pulpit  's short mysterious Art  Lifts  Faith  to Heav'n and damns the  Moral Heart    Bear me dishonour'd God to some plain State  Where Truth in spite of  Aye  and  No  is Weight  Where Pleas of Right a reas'ning Bench persuade  And Justice scorns in  Precedent  to

cry'd is Mine Mine the gay Skill  To paint the Fancy and adorn the Will  But where dry  Avarice  has Taste betray'd  Pleasure is  Robbery  in  Masquerade    Contending Sexes push One common Aim  And Youth and Wit and Beauty meet to  game  At Cards to conquer or at Dice to sweep  Is all the humble Joy the  Polish'd  reap  OR if aspiring to robuster Praise  Some livelier Genius Warmth more  active

Proudly display'd looks back and shouts to find  Poor conscious  John  less glorious hang behind  NOT  so  th'  Olympian  Rivals charm'd of Old  When fiery Youths in whirling Chariots roll'd  Then the watch'd Signal bad the Rank disjoin  And rushing Wheels dissolv'd the breaking Line  Strain'd to th' expanded Whip's impulsive Sound  Light leap'd th' exulting Axles o'er the Ground  'Twixt crowding Nations partial panting gay  The prais'd plum'd Heroe  skim'd  the less'ning Way  The smoaking Steeds obey'd the watchful Rein  And winding warlike swept the shouting Plain  Now graceful  rais'd  now
