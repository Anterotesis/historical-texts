Printed for J OSBORN S BIRT D BROWNE J HODGES A MILLAR J WHISTON and J ROBINSON MDCCXLII  A TOUR Through the ISLAND of  GREAT BRITAIN  VOL III  LETTER I Containing a Description of the Counties of  LINCOLN RUTLAND NORTHAMPTON HUNTINGDON  and  BEDFORD    SIR  _FROM  Newark  still keeping the Fossway which lies as strait as a Line can mark it out we went on to  Lincoln  having a View of the great Church call'd the  Minster  all the Way before us the River  Trent  on the Left and the  Downs  call'd  LincolnHeath  on the Right  Lincoln  is an antient City govern'd by a Mayor Aldermen  c  It is so full of the Ruins of Monasteries and Religious Houses that the very Barns Stables Outhouses and as they shew'd me some of the very Hogstyes are built Churchfashion that is to say with StoneWalls and arch'd Windows and Doors Here are Churches but the meanest to look on that are anywhere to be seen The Cathedral indeed and the Ruins of the old Castle are very venerable Pieces of Antiquity  Lincoln  was a Colony of the  Romans  and by them nam'd  Lindum Colonia  which very easily falls into the present abbreviated Appellation  Lincoln  From its bold and noble Situation upon an high Hill it seems a Collection of Five Cities For first below the Hill and Westward of the City the River throws itself into a great Pool called  Swanpool  from the Multitude of Swans upon it All around this Place the Ground is moory and full of Bogs and Islets and the Place is called now  Carham  i e a Dwelling upon the  Car  or Fen Here was the  British  City in the most early Times which they used as a Fastness for themselves and Cattle in Times of deep Distress From this  Carham  is a pleasant View of the WestFront of the Cathedral  The  Romans  pleas'd with this Eminence placed their City upon it which they first built in the Form of a large Square the Southern Wall being sufficiently secur'd by the Precipice Quite round the other Three Sides they carried a deep Trench which still remains except on the Southeast Angle This City was divided into Four equal Parts by Two cross Streets The Two Southern Quarters were taken up one by the Castle the other by the Church which  Remigius  built But when Bishop  Alexander  projected a Structure of much larger Dimensions the Inclosure was carried beyond the Eastern Bounds of the City and a new Wall built  farther that way as at present with Battlements and Towers The North  Roman  Gate of this Part of the City still remains intire call'd  Newport  Gate and the noblest Remnant of this Sort in  Britain  It is a vast Semicircle of Stones laid together without Morter and cemented only by their wedgelike Shape This magnificent Arch is Feet Diameter the Stones Four Feet thick at Bottom From this Gate Eastward some Part of the old  Roman  Wall is to be seen made of Stone and very strong Mortar The West Gate towards the Gallows was pulled down within Memory That on the South Side still shews one Jamb from between the Houses and two or three Stones of the same Make as the former the rest has been pull'd down by Mr  Houghton  On the East Side one Postern is visible and big enough for a Bed to stand in By  Newport  Gate is another large and curious Piece of  Roman  Workmanship call'd the Mintwall This is still Feet high and above Feet long composed of Brick and Stone laid alternately  The  Romans  finding this City well situated for Navigation added another to it as big as the former This they did Southward upon the Declivity of the Hill and so made it parallel with the other and the most Southern Side lay upon the River Eastward the Ditch without is turn'd into a broad Street call'd  The BeastMarket  and there below  Claskgate  a great Part of the old  Roman  Wall is left made of Stone One Piece of it is now Feet long and high A little of it lower down is Feet long and as much high Between that Gate upwards and the old Citywall by the  Greestonestairs  the old Ditch call'd  Weredyke  is to be seen To the West the Ditch and Foundation of the Wall are still lost tho' many times repaired and demolished in the frequent Sieges this Town has sustain'd especially in the Wars of the Empress  Maud  At the Bottom  of it towards the Water is a round Tower named  Lucytower  much known in her History  Another great Addition to the Length of this City Northward above the Hill was call'd  Newport  or the new City Paces long This probably was done in the Time of the  Saxon  Kings It lies on both Sides the  Hermenstreet  and was fenc'd with a Wall and Ditch hewn out of the Rock At the Two farther Corners were round Towers and a Gate the Foundations of which remain There were several Churches and religious Houses in this Place It was chiefly inhabited by  Jews  who had settled here in great Numbers and grown rich by Trade There is a Well still nam'd  Grantham'swell  from a Child they impiously crucified as was said and threw it into that Place  After the  Norman  Conquest when a great Part of the first City was turn'd into a Castle by King  William  I it is probable they added the last Intake Southward in the Angle of the  Witham  and made a new Cut call'd  Sinsildyke  on the South and East Side for its Security It is observable that the  Normans  could not well pronounce  Lincoln  but vitiated it to  Nichol  as we find it written in some old Authors and to this Day a Part of the  Swanpool  is call'd  Nicholpool    Tho' since those Times the City has much declin'd of late it seems to revive and Trade and Manufactures to flourish  In this last Part of  Lincoln  on both Sides the  Roman  Road were many of that People's funeral Monuments some of which they now dig up There is an Inscription of that Sort behind the House where the Lord  Hussey  was beheaded for Rebellion in the Time of King  Henry  VIII The great Bowwindow thro' which he pass'd to the Scaffold was lately taken down It stands overagainst another Stone Building of an antique Model which was  the Palace of  John  of  Gaunt  Duke of  Lancaster  who lived here in Royal State and had the Privilege of Coining His Arms are here carv'd in Stone Overagainst the Castle Westward is an Entrenchment made by King  Stephen    The Situation of the City from what I have said must appear very particular one Part is on the flat and in a Bottom so that the  Witham  a little River that runs through the Town flows sometimes into the Street the other Part lies upon the Top of a high Hill where the Cathedral stands and the very steepest Part of the Ascent of the Hill is the best Part of the City for Trade and Business  Nothing is more troublesome than the Communication of the upper and lower Town the Street is so steep and so strait that the Coaches and Horses are oblig'd to fetch a Compass another Way as well on one Hand as on the other  The River  Witham  is arch'd over so that you see nothing of it as you go through the main Street but it makes a large Lake on the West Side and has a Canal called the  Possdike  by which it has a Communication with the  Trent  whereby the Navigation of that River is made useful for Trade to the City This River must have run into the  Humber  had it not been broken off in the Middle by that great Valley under  Lincoln  and turned into the Saltmarshes Hence it is that the Stone upon this Western Cliff is full of Seashells For the Shellfish when by the restless Motion of the Waters in the universal Delage they were carried into the midland Places were hinder'd by the Weight of their Shells from regaining their original Stations and thus were confin'd within the growing Stone As a Testimony of which the Skeleton of a Crocodile or some such Animal inclosed in a broad flat Stone was sent to the Royal Society from these Parts by Dr  Stukeley  from whom we borrow this Observation  There are very good Buildings in the upper City and several Families of Gentlemen have Houses there besides those of the Prebendaries and other Clergy belonging to the Cathedral  The Cathedral is a magnificent Fabrick and is reputed the largest in Extent of any Cathedral in  England  except  York  But there are in it many obvious Blemishes which I shall particularly take Notice of in comparing it hereafter with  York  Minster The Situation is infinitely to its Advantage as it stands upon a high Hill and is seen into five or six Counties It has a double Cross or Transept The West End receives a great Addition to its Breadth by reason of Two Chapels on each Side of the SideAyles but the Two Towers and Spires are very mean tho' not for want of Height  This Cathedral has many Bells and particularly the Northern Tower is filled up as one may say with the finest great Bell in  England  which is called  Tom of Lincoln  being probably consecrated to  Thomas Becket  Archbishop of  CanterburyAs loud as Tom of Lincoln  is a Proverb It weighs Tons Pounds and will hold Gallons Alemeasure the Circumference is Feet Inches  The Middle or Rood Tower is the highest in the whole Kingdom and when the Spire was standing on it it must in Proportion to the Height of the Tower have exceeded that of old  St Paul's  which was Feet The Monks were so proud of this Structure that they would have it that the Devil looked upon it with an envious Eye whence the Proverb of a Man who looks invidious and malignant  He looks as the Devil over Lincoln  At present there are only four very ordinary Pinacles one at each Corner It has Two great Gatehouses or Entrances from the West The lower Part of the Fr  t and of the Two Towers are of  Remigius  's Building as is easily discoverable by the Colour of  the Stones and by the Manner of Architecture but  Alexander  built the Additions upon it as likewise the Body of the Cathedral the Choir and  St Mary  's Tower which once had a very lofty Spire St  Hugh  the  Burgundian  built the East End or  St Mary  's Chapel where he had a Shrine and the Chapterhouse which is ceil'd with a beautiful Stone Roof and one Pillar in the Middle  The Cloisters and the Library are fine and the latter is well furnished with printed Books and Manuscripts  Two Catharinewheel Windows as they are term'd at the Ends of the larger Transepts are remarkably fine for Bullionwork and painted Glass  Here are great Numbers of antique Brasses and Monuments  South of the Church upon the very Brow of the Hill is the Bishop's Palace built by  Robert de Chesney  who gave Two great Bells Bishop  Bek  and other Successors improv'd it into a Magnificence equal to the Cathedral It stands just South of the  Roman  Wall It had many large Bowwindows of curious Workmanship looking over the lower City into  Nottinghamshire  The Kitchen had Seven Chimneys The Hall was stately The Gatehouse remains intire with the A  of the Founders This Palace was ruined in the Time of the Civil Wars but might be rebuilt with no very great Expence As the Church is very large so is the Revenue of the Bishoprick which was formerly immensely great as may be seen by the  Monasticon  where is an astonishing Account of the Wealth of the Place  The Church as it is the Seat of the Bishoprick is not so antient as some others the See being remov'd since the  Norman  Conquest from  Dorchester  a little Town in  Oxfordshire  on the River  Thames  not far from  Tame  of which I have spoken in its  Place but the City is truly antient and the Ruins of it tell us as much  Mr  Camden  says King  Vortimer  the valiant  Briton  dy'd here and was buried in the Church of the great Monastery  It is certain as I have observ'd that  William the Conqueror  built the Castle to curb the potent Citizens and the Ruins shew that it was a most magnificent Work well fortify'd and capable of receiving a numerous Garison  The Bishoprick of  Lincoln  at that Time contain'd all that now is compris'd in the Dioceses of  Ely Peterborough  and  Oxford  besides what is now its own and 'tis still the largest Diocese in  England  containing the several Counties of  Lincoln Leicester Huntingdon Bedford Bucks  and Part of  Hertford  and in them Parishes whereof are Impropriations and there are in these Bounds six Archdeacons  viz Lincoln Leicester Bedford Buckingham Stow  and  Huntingdon    Here was the famous Battle fought between the Friends of the Empress  Maud  Mother to King  Henry  II and King  Stephen  in which that magnanimous Prince was overthrown and taken Prisoner  Lincoln  stands in a most rich pleasant and agreeable Country for on the North and Southeast the noble Plain call'd  Lincoln Heath  extends itself like the Plain about  Salisbury  for above Miles  viz  from  Sleeford  and  Ancaster  South to the Bank of the  Humber  North tho' not with a Breadth equal to the Length for the Plain is hardly anywhere above Three or Four Miles broad  On the West Side of this Plain the  Trent  Waters make a pleasant and rich Valley running from  Newark  to  Gainsburgh  thence to  Burton  and so into the  Humber    Gainsburgh  hath a large and fine Market and is very flourishing for Trade and Business which hath  increased of late Years to the Detriment of  Boston  and  Hull    The Body of the Parishchurch of this Place had been under a general Decay and the Walls Arches and Pillars so shaken and declin'd from their proper Position that it was judged incapable of Repair An Act of Parliament therefore passed in for pulling down and rebuilding it It is famous for the  Danes  having landed here when they came up the  Trent    Passing the  Trent  by a Ferry you land in the Isle of  Axholm  which is environ'd by the  Trent  and the  Dun Littleborough  is the  Agelocum  or  Segelocum  of the  Romans  a small Village Three Miles above  Gainsburgh  just upon the Edge of the Water and in a Nook It seems only to have been environ'd with a Ditch and was of a square Form The Water ran quite round it for to the West where  White'sbridge  is a watry Valley hems it in so that it was sufficiently strong The Church stands upon the highest Ground The  Trent  has wash'd away Part of the Eastern Side of the Town Foundations and Pavements are visible in the Bank Here an Urn with the Coin of  Domitian  was found and great Numbers of Coins have been taken up in ploughing and digging which they call  Swinepennies  because those Creatures sometimes rout them up and the Inhabitants take little Care to preserve them Mr  Ella  Vicar of  Rampton  hard by has collected several and some valuable  In Two Altars handsomely moulded of coarse Gritstone were dug up which are set as Piers in a Wall on the Side of the Steps which lead from the River to the Inn Many very small Coins like flatted Peas call'd  Mites  are also found Mr  Hardy  has a large Urn with a Female Face on the Outside  In this Field near  White'sbridge  are great Foundations of Buildings Coins are often found at the lowest Edge of the Water when the Tide is gone off and in dry Seasons On the East Side of the River has been a Camp  By  Tilbridgelane  upon the Top of the Heath is a Spring which according to the vulgar Report flows and ebbs with the  Trent  tho' at Five Miles Distance The like is said of several others hereabout  Ten Miles from  Lincoln  Northward is  Spittle  all the Way to which Place are Milliary Stones 'Tis very pleasant Riding being wholly Champaign or Heath Of these Stones I believe some are  Roman  others later Crosses to supply their Place This was no doubt a Mansion because hard by a little Beck runs thro' it Here is an Hospital said to be founded in the Year There are great Foundations all around some of which perhaps are  Roman  At present the Village consists of Two Farmhouses a Chapel an Inn and a Sessionshouse Upon the latter is this Inscription  Haecce domus dat amat punit conservat honorat  Aequitiam pacem crimina jura bonos    That is  This Court does Right loves Peace preserves the Laws  Detects the wrong rewards the righteous Cause  To the Left is  Normanby  where the last but one Duke of  Bucks  was born and whence he assum'd his Title of Marquis  Half a Mile East of the present  Wintringham  stood the old  Roman  Town now a Common bounded by the Marshes upon the  Humber  The City was plough'd up of late Years and many Antiquities found  The present  Wintringham  is a dirty poor Place but still a Corporation and the Mayor is chosen only out of one Street next the old Town where was a Chapel The Bell of it now hangs in a wooden Frame by the Pillory Here is a vast Jawbone or Rib of a Whale which has remain'd Time out of Mind  As the Middle of the Country is all hilly and the West Side low so the East Side is the richest most fruitful and best cultivated of any County in  England  so far from  London  One Part is all Fen or Marsh Grounds and extends itself South to the Isle of  Ely  And here it is that so vast a Quantity of Sheep are fed as makes this County and that of  Leicester  an inexhaustible Fountain of Wool for all the manufacturing Counties in  England  as before observ'd  There are some good Towns on the Seacoast but I include not  Barton  which stands on the  Humber  as one of them being a straggling mean Town noted for nothing but an illfavoured dangerous Passage or Ferry over the  Humber  to  Hull  where in an open Boat in which we had about Horses and or Cows mingled with about or Passengers we were about Hours toss'd about on the  Humber  before we could get into the Harbour at  Hull    Well may the  Humber  take its Name from the Noise it makes for in a high Wind it is incredibly great and terrible like the Crash and Dashing together of Ships  Passing over  Whitton  Brook a  Roman  Road goes directly to  Aukborough  by that People call'd  Aquis  Their Camp is now call'd  Countessclose  from a Countess of  Warwick  who they say liv'd there at least own'd the Estate The  Roman  Castle is square Feet each Side very conveniently plac'd in the Northwest Angle of  Lincolnshire  as a Watchtower  over all  Nottinghamshire  and  Yorkshire  The Church is of good Stone and has a square Tower but the Choir is ruinous and separated from the rest of the Church by a wooden Partition Here are numerous Reliques of the Deluge as Seashells subterraneous Trees  c  In a square Plot call'd  The Green  is a round Labyrinth nam'd  Julian's Bower  probably from the warlike Games in Use among the  Roman  and  British  Youth call'd  Ludi Trojani  and said by  Virgil  to be first introduc'd into  Italy  by  Iulus  the Son of  Aeneas  And the Boys to this Day divert themselves with running in it one after another and eluding their Playfellows by their intricate Mazes It seems that our Tournaments so much in Fashion till Queen  Elizabeth  's Time are Remainders of these antient Diversions  Burton  makes a pretty Prospect has several Mills and the Houses are pleasantly intermix'd with Trees There are also Two Churches one of which is so low in respect of the Precipice under which it stands that a Person may almost leap from thence upon the Steeple  At  Barrow  is a  British  Temple vulgarly call'd a Castle  A little Eastward hence is  Thornton  College a great Abbey founded by  William le Gros  Earl of  Albemarle  in the Year The Gatehouse is very perfect being a vast Tower or Castle of great Strength both for Offence and Defence Before it is a large Ditch across which is laid a Bridge with Walls on each Hand and Arches which support a broad Battlement to keep off the Enemy Before it are Two round Towers There was a Portcullis at the great Gate and behind it another Gate of Oak Over the Gate are Three old clumsy Statues in the ordinary Niches a Woman seeming a Queen or the Virgin  Mary  to the Right a Man with a Lamb  probably St  John  Baptist and to the Left a Bishop or Abbat with a Crosier Upon taking down an old Wall they found a Man with a Candlestick Table and Book who was supposed to have been immur'd The whole Monastery was encompassed by a deep Ditch and high Rampart to secure the Religious from Robbers because near the Sea  A Mile East of  Thornton  are the Ruins of another great Castle call'd  Kelingholme    In  Goswel  Parish Northward is  Burham  once a Chapel which belong'd to the Monastery now a Farmhouse  In the same Parish near the  Humber  is  Verecourt  which belong'd to the antient Family of that Name  The Land hereabout is good and wellwooded and many  Roman  Coins are found  Two Miles West of  Thornton  are the Ruins of a great  Roman  Camp call'd  Yarborough  which surveys the whole Hundred denominated from it Mr  Howson  of  Kenington  which is hard by has Pecks of  Roman  Coins found here  Grimsby  lies also on the  Humber  but lower down towards the Ocean It is a Mayortown and Seaport But its Harbour is not very safe for Ships to ride in as appeared at the Time of the great Storm in when all the Ships in that Road were driven from their Anchors and most of them lost Here is a very large sumptuous Church  We took the Round of the Seacoast from hence Southward all the Way to  Boston  and pass'd thro'  Saltfleet Burgh  and  Wainfleet  besides several Villages lying on the Seaside The Two first are but inconsiderable Markettowns but  Wainfleet  is a wellcompacted Town and neat tho' situated in the Fens 'Tis noted for a fine Freeschool and giving an Addition to the Name of the Founder of it who was call'd  William  of  Wainfleet  afterwards Bishop of  Winchester  and who founded also  Winchester  College  The River  Witham  crosses the County from  Lincoln  to  Boston  where it disembogues at the Source of it is a little River of the same Name  Between this River and the Seacoast Northeast the several inland Towns of  Bolinbroke  famous for giving Birth and Title to King  Henry  IV also Title to Mr Secretary  St John  one of the greatest Genius's of the Age tho' unhappy in some of his Politics  Spilsby Horncastle  and  Tattersal  on the South About the Middle of this Division made by the  Witham  lie  Stanton Marketrasen Louth  and  Binbroke  and higher up Northward stand  Kirton Glandsord Brigs  and  Caster    Spilsby  is a pretty good Town and has a wellfrequented Market  Horncastle  is almost surrounded with Water and is a large wellbuilt Town But the rest are inconsiderable except  Louth  and  Caster  the first has Two weekly considerable Markets and is famous for a fine Spire Steeple as high as that of  Grantham    Caster  is the ancient  Durobrivis  tho'  Dornford  retains somewhat of the old Name where the  Hermenstreet  cross'd the River by a Bridge of Brass according to the Vulgar At  Chesterton  is a large Tract of Ground call'd  The Castlefield  with a Ditch and Rampart around it The  Roman  Road runs directly thro' it and still retains its high Ridge Beyond the River it extends for some Space upon the Meadow along the Bank then forms an Angle and proceeds full North  Caster  is above half a Mile from it upon the Hill A Part of the Foundation of the Wall of the old  Roman  Camp is visible in the Street to the Northwest Corner of the Church under the Wall of the House where the Minister lives It may be known by the great Strength of the Morter built of the white Slabstone of the Country Underneath this lay the City for below the Churchyard  the Ground is full of Foundations and  Mosaics    In the  Boot  Alehouse Cellar is a Piece of a Pavement as are many at Mr  Wright  's and in a Garden an intire one besides great Numbers of  Roman  Coins in the Possession of Mons  Baillardeau  In the plough'd Fields between the Town and the River toward  Fordgreen  is a Tract which runs quite thro' whereon Corn grows very scantily This is nothing but a Road laid with a deep Bed of Gravel tho' the superstitious Countrypeople believe it was cursed by the Lady  Kyneburg  the Abbess who built a religious House which stood Eastward of the Church and some Part of which still remains This Meadow is call'd  Normangate  or more properly  Dormangate  Field from the Town whose Foundations are found all about this Place and also innumerable Coins call'd  Dormanpence  Part of this is  Berrystead  where Antiquities are daily dug up  Millfield  stands higher toward  Peterborough  where Mosaic Pavements  c  are found and seems to have been a little Citadel belonging to the Town  Part of the Church is an antique Building but newmodell'd Upon a Stone over the Choirdoor is a curious Inscription importing that the Church was consecrated on the th of  April  The Steeple stands in the Middle of the Church The Tower is a fine Piece of antient Architecture with semicircular Arches The square Well by the Porch is  Roman  surrounded with hewn Stone and tho' it stands on a Hill the Water is very high At the Eastend of the Church is a very old Cross  A little higher up the River near  Wansford  Bridge a Gold  British  Coin was found which is in the Possession of Mr  Maurice Johnson  an eminent Counsellor  The  Fen  Country begins about  Wainfleet  which is within Twenty Miles of  Grimsby  and extends itself to the Isle of  Ely  South and to the Grounds opposite to  Lynnregis  in  Norfolk  East  This Part is indeed very properly called  Holland  for 'tis a flat level and often drowned Country like the Province of the same Name in the  Low Countries  insomuch that the very Ditches are navigable and the People pass from Town to Town in Boats as they do there Here we had the uncouth Musick of the  Bittern  a Bird formerly counted ominous and presaging and which as some say thrusts its Bill into a Reed and others into a Bog and then gives the dull heavy Groan or Sound like a Sigh which is so loud that 'tis heard Two or Three Miles Distance as some People say  Here we first saw  Boston  and making towards it found it a Seaport Town at the Mouth of the  Witham    The Tower is the highest and noblest in  Europe  being Yards and is seen plainly Miles round this level Country and farther by Sea The Octagon Lantern on the Top is very beautiful and admirable for the Thinness of the Stonework Mariners find it particularly useful to guide them into this Port and even into the Mouth of the River  Ouse  for in clear Weather 'tis seen quite out at Sea to the Entrance of those Chanels which they call  Lynn Deeps  and  Boston Deeps  which are as difficult Places as most upon the Eastern Shore of  Britain  This is particularly taken Notice of in an Act passed in the Reign of the late Queen  Anne for enabling Assessments to be made for Repairing and keeping in Repair this Church  in the Preamble to which it is described as it deserves as an antient wellbuilt Fabrick that the Tower thereof is very high and an useful Seamark and that it being situate near the Haven a great Sum is necessary yearly to be raised  to preserve it from a violent constantly ebbing and flowing Water  There was a prodigious ClockBell which could be heard Six or Seven Miles round it had many old Verses round it but  Anno  was knocked in Pieces and the Inscription not taken  Twenty Yards from the Foundation of this Tower runs the rapid  Witham  thro' a wooden Bridge  This Town abounded with religious Houses whose Lands King  Henry  VIII gave to the Town  Queen  Mary  I was a great Benefactress likewise to it and gave them Lands called  Erection  Lands to pay a Vicar Lecturer and Two Schoolmasters  The Church is reckon'd the largest Parishchurch without cross Ayles in the Universe 'tis Feet wide and long within the Walls The Roof is handsomely ceiled with  Irish  Oak supported by tall and slender Pillars  Formerly the Town laboured under the Want of fresh Water which was a great Discouragement to Merchants and others settling there To remedy which Inconvenience  John Smyth  of  Heath  in the County of  York    Esq  procur'd an Act of Parliament which passed in the Reign of Queen  Anne  to inclose Two Acres of the great Common called  The West Fen  for a Pond or Cistern and to erect a Waterhouse and Mill upon the said Common and other proper Edifices and to lay Pipes from the Pond for supplying the Town  The Town is large populous and wellbuilt full of Merchants and has a good Share of foreign Trade as well as  Lynn  'Tis built on both Sides of the River  Witham  It is a Corporation governed by a Mayor and Aldermen It has two Markets weekly and a commodious Haven Here is held one of those annual Fairs which preserve the antient Title of a  Mart  whereof I remember only Four in  England  of any considerable Note  viz Lynn Gainsburgh  Beverly  and  Boston  Its Trade of late Years has not increased  East of  Boston  was a Chapel called  Hiptoft  and in the Town a Church dedicated to St  John  but both demolish'd Queen  Elizabeth  gave the Corporation a Court of Admiralty over all the Seacoasts hereabouts  The Country round this Place is all  Fen  and Marsh Grounds the Land is very rich and feeds prodigious Numbers of large Sheep and also Oxen of the largest Size the best of which are driven to  London  Market and from this Part as also from the Downs or Heath abovementioned comes as I have before noted a great Part of the Wool known as a creditable Distinction because of its Fineness by the Name of  Lincolnshire Wool  which is sent in great Quantities into  Norfolk  and  Suffolk  for the Manufacturers of those Countries and indeed to several other of the trading Counties in  England    These Fens are very considerable for their Extent for they reach in Length in some Places Miles and in Breadth above and as they are so level that there is no Interruption to the Sight any Building of extraordinary Height is seen a long Way For Example  Boston  Steeple is seen upon  Lincoln  Heath near Miles  Peterborough  and  Ely  Minsters are seen almost thoughout the whole Level so are the Spires of  Lynn Whittlesea  and  Crowland  seen at a very great Distance which adds some Beauty to the Country  From  Boston  we came on thro' the  Fen  Country to  Holbech  a little Markettown and so on to  Spalding  which is another Seaport in the Level but standing far within the Land on the River  Welland  which almost incloses it Here was nothing very remarkable to be seen as to Antiquity but the Ruins of an old Monastery of which the  Monasticon  gives a particular Description There is a Bridge  over the  Welland  and Vessels of about or Tons may come up to the Town and that is sufficient for the Trade of  Spalding  which is chiefly in Corn and Coal  We must not pass by  Crowland  another Place of great religious Antiquity here being once a famous Monastery the Remains of which are still to be seen The Monks of  Crowland  were eminent in History and a great many Stories are told of the Devils of  Crowland  also and what Conversation they had with the Monks which Tales are more out of Date now than they were formerly  The Abbey was founded Years ago by  Athelbald  King of  Mercia  in the midst of Bogs and Thorns in Honour of his Chaplain  Guthlac  who chose this Place to mortify in The Foundation is laid on Piles of Wood several of which have been found in tearing up the Ruins of the Eastern Part of the Church for what remains is only Part of the Westend and of that only one Corner in tolerable Repair which is at present their Parishchurch In the Middle of the Cross stood once a lofty Tower and in it was a remarkably fine Ring of Bells the first as is said in the County The Roof which was of  Irish  Oak finely carv'd and gilt fell down about Years ago and Pieces of it are to be found in almost every House People at Pleasure dig up the monumental Stones for private Use and what are left in the Pavement are cover'd over with Shrubs It was made a Garison in the late Civil Wars and the Soldiers destroy'd the painted Glass in it All the Eastern Part of the Body of the Church is intirely raz'd to the Foundation The monastick Buildings Cloisters Hall Abbat's Lodgings are absolutely demolish'd In the Northwest Corner of the Church stands a strong Tower with a very obtuse Spire and a pleasant Ring of small Bells Over the West Gate are the Images of divers Kings Abbats  c  among the rest  Guthlac  with a Whip and Knife his usual Symbols  Not far from the Abbey is the Remnant of a little Stone Cottage called  Anchorchurchhouse  where was a Chapel in which St  Guthlac  was bury'd and where he lived a Hermit  Overagainst the Westend of the Abbey is the famous triangular Bridge hardly to be equalled in  Britain  if in  Europe  It being too steep for Horses and Carriages to go over they pass under it 'Tis formed on Three Segments of a Circle meeting in one Point and each Base they say stands in a different County Here meet the Rivers  Nyne  and  Welland  So that the Bridge being fixed at the very Point where they join stands upon a Centre in the Middle of the united Waters and then parting into Two Bridges lands you one to the Right on  Thorney  and one to the Left upon  Holland  On one Side fits an Image of King  Athelbald  Founder of  CrowlandAbbey  with a Globe in his Hand  The Town of  Spalding  is not large but pretty well built and well inhabited and is a handsome and large Markettown but for the Healthiness or Pleasantness of it I have no more to say than that I was very glad when I got out of it as well as out of the rest of the Fen Country for 'tis a horrid Air for a Stranger to breathe in  The History of the Draining these Fens by a Set of Gentlemen called the  Adventurers  the several Laws for securing and preserving the Banks and dividing the Lands how they were by the extraordinary Conflux of Waters from all the Inland Counties of  England  frequently overflowed and sometimes lay under Water most Part of the Year how all the Waters in this Part of  England  which do not run into the  Thames  the  Trent  or the  Severn  fall together into these low Grounds and empty themselves into the Sea by those Drains as thro' a  Sink and how by the Skill of these Adventurers and at a prodigious Expence they have cut new Chanels and even whole Rivers with particular Drains from one River to another to carry off the great Flux of Waters when Floods or Freshes come down either on one Side or on the other and how notwithstanding all that Hands could do or Art contrive yet sometimes the Waters do still prevail the Banks break and whole Levels are overflowed together All this and much more that might be said on so copious a Subject tho' it would be very useful to have it fully and geographically describ'd yet it would take up so much Room that I cannot think of entering any farther into it than just to mention That an Act of Parliament lately passed to enable the Adventurers Owners and Proprietors of the taxable Lands and the Owners and Proprietors of the free Lands in  Deeping Fen Pinchbeck  and  Spalding South Fen Therlby Fen Bourn South Fen  and  Croyland Fen  c in the County of  Lincoln  containing in the Whole about Acres to raise a competent Sum for the effectual Draining and future Preservation of all the said Fens according to their Agreement in that behalf dated  Febr  and to carry the said Agreement into Execution  We shall only observe further that Sir  John Heathcote  Bart hath made so good a Progress in draining Acres of the  Therlby Fen  Pastures belonging to him that he is particularly exempted from paying toward the Sums levied upon others by this Act  These Fens of  Lincolnshire  are of the same Kind with and contiguous to those already mentioned in the Isle of  Ely  in the Counties of  Cambridge  and  Huntingdon  and here as well as there we see prodigious Numbers of Cattle which are fed up to an extraordinary Size by the Richness of the Soil  Here are also an infinite Number of WildFowl such as Duck and Mallard Teal and Wigeon BrandGeese  WildGeese  c  For the taking of the four first Kinds here are a great many  Decoys  from all which the vast Number of Fowls they take are sent up to  London    The Accounts which the Country People give of the Numbers they sometimes take are such that one scarce dares report it from them But this I can say of my certain Knowlege that some of these Decoys are of so great an Extent and take such great Numbers of Fowl that they are let from  l  to and  l  a Year Rent  The Art of taking the Fowls and especiaally of Breeding up a Set of Creatures called  DecoyDucks  to intice and then betray their FellowDucks into the several Decoys is very ingenious and tho' 'tis not very easy to describe it I will give it in as few Words as I can  The DecoyDucks are hatched and bred up in the Decoy Ponds in which are certain Places where they are constantly fed and being made tame they are used to come to the DecoyMan's Hand for their Food  When they fly abroad it is not known whither they go but some conjecture they fly quite over into  Holland  and  Germany  where they meet with others of their own Kind and sorting with them they by some Art unknown to us draw together a vast Number of the Fowls and in a Word  kidnap  them from their own Country for being once brought out of their Knowlege they follow the Decoys as a Dog follows the Sportsman and 'tis frequent to see these subtle Creatures return with a vast Flight of Fowls along with them after they have been absent several Weeks together  When they have brought them over the first Thing they do is to settle with them in the Ponds to which the DecoyDucks belong Here they chatter and gabble to them in their own Language  as if they were telling them that here they should soon see how well they should live  When the DecoyMen perceive they are come and that they are gathering and increasing they go secretly to the Pond's Side under the Cover which they have made with Reeds so that they cannot be seen where they throw over the Reeds Handfuls of Corn in such shallow Places as the DecoyDucks are usually fed and whither they are sure to come for it and to bring their new Guests with them for their Entertainment  This they do for two or three Days together and no Harm follows to the poor Strangers till throwing in this Bait one time in an open wide Place another time in another wide Place the third time it is thrown in a narrower Place where the Trees which hang over the Water and the Banks stand closer together and then in another yet narrower where the said Trees are overhead like an Arbour tho' at a good Height from the Water  Here the Boughs are so artfully managed that a large Net is spread near the Tops of the Trees among the Branches and fastened to Hoops which reach from Side to Side This is so high and so wide and the Room is so much below and the Water so open that the Fowls do not perceive the Net above them  Here the DecoyMan keeping unseen behind the Hedges of Reeds which are made perfectly close goes forward throwing Corn over the Reeds into the Water The DecoyDucks greedily fall upon it and calling their foreign Guests seem to tell them that now they may find how well the Ducks live in  England  so inviting or rather wheedling them forward 'till by degrees they are all gotten under the Arch or Sweep of the Net which is on the Trees and which by degrees imperceptibly to them declines lower and lower and also narrower and narrower  till at the farther End it comes to a Point like a Purse though this farther End is quite out of Sight and perhaps two or three hundred Yards from the first Entrance  When the whole Flight of Ducks are thus greedily following the Decoys and feeding plentifully as they go and the DecoyMan sees they are all so far within the Arch of the Net as not to be able to escape on a sudden a Dog which till then keeps close by him and which is perfectly taught his Business rushes from behind the Reeds and jumps into the Water swimming directly after the Ducks and barks as he swims  Immediately the frighted Ducks rise upon the Wing to make their Escape but are beaten down again by the arched Net which is over their Heads Being then forced into the Water they necessarily swim forward for fear of the Dog and thus they croud on 'till by Degrees the Net growing lower and narrower they are hurried to the very farther End where another DecoyMan stands ready to receive them and who takes them out alive with his Hands  As for the Traitors that drew the poor Ducks into this Snare they are taught to rise but a little Way and so not reaching to the Net they fly back to the Ponds and make their Escape or else being used to the DecoyMan they go to him fearless and are taken out as the rest but instead of being killed with them are strok'd made much of and put into a little Pond just by him and plentifully fed for their Services  There are many Particulars in the managing and draining these Levels throwing off the Water by Mills and Engines and cultivating the Grounds in an unusual manner which would be very useful to be described but the needful Brevity of this Work will not admit of it yet something of it may be touched upon  That here are some wonderful Engines for throwing up Water and such as are not to be seen anywhere else whereof one in particular threw up as they assured us Tons of Water in half an Hour and goes by WindSails Wings or Sails to a Mill  Here are the greatest Improvements by Planting of Hemp that I think are to be seen in  England  particularly on the  Norfolk  and  Cambridge  Sides of the  Fens  as about  Wisbech Wells  and several other Places where we saw many hundred Acres of Ground bearing great Crops of Hemp  Here is a particular Trade carried on with  London  which is nowhere else practised in the whole Kingdom that I have met with or heard of  viz  For carrying Fish alive by LandCarriage this they do by carrying great Buts filled with Water in Waggons as the Carriers draw other Goods The Buts have a little square Flap instead of a Bung about or Inches square which being opened gives Air to the Fish and every Night when they come to the Inn they draw off the Water and let more fresh and sweet Water run into them again In these Carriages they chiefly carry Tench and Pike Pearch and Eels but especially the two former of which here are some of the largest in  England    Whittlesea  and  Ramsey  Meres are Two Lakes made by the River  Nyne  which runs through them the first is between Five and Six Miles long and Three Miles broad and is indeed full of excellent Fish for this Trade  The  Hermenstreet  goes in a strait Line thro' great and little  Stukely  antiently written  Styvecle  which Name it acquir'd from its  stiff clay  Soil In  Great Stukely  Church is a Font of a very antique Make  The  Hermenstreet  after this becomes notorious by the Name of  Stangate  Near  Stilton  some Parts appear still pav'd with Stone which strengthens the Conjecture that the Name  Stangate  was given it from thence It traverses great Woods between the Two  Saltries  where was a religious Foundation of  Simon Silvanect  the second Earl of  Huntingdon  and  Northampton  among the Ruins of which lie buried  Robert Brus  Lord of  Anandale  in  Scotland  and of  Cleveland  in  England  with  Isabel  his Consort from whom the  Scotish  Branch of our Royal Family is descended Near the Road Side  Roman  Urns have been dug up  Half a Mile out of the Road is the Seat of Sir  Robert Cotton  the learned Friend of the great  Camden  where he had a choice Collection of  Roman  Inscriptions from all Parts of the Kingdom The House was built in a magnificent manner of hewn Stone but now lies in dismal Ruins By it is a most beautiful Church with a Tower and in the Windows is fine painted Glass From those Woods abovemention'd your Eye commands the whole Level of the Fens particularly  Whitleseymere  where the Gentry have little Vessels to sail in for Pleasure Sir  Robert Cotton  digging the Foundation of a House on the Hill whence you enjoy this Prospect found the Skeleton of a Fish Feet long  A little to the Right lies  Ramsey  famed for a rich Abbey little of which is now left but a Part of the old Gatehouse In the Yard I saw a neglected Statue of the Founder  Alwyn  who was called  Alderman of all  England and was Cousin to King  Edgar  and Son of Duke  Athelstan  surnamed  HalfKing  This is one of the most antient Pieces of  English  Sculpture which we know of The Keys and ragged Staff in his Hand denote his Office The Abbey was dedicated to St  Dunstan  of  Canterbury  and St  Oswald  of  York  and was a rich Foundation  and at the Dissolution valued at  l per Annum  for the Maintenance of Monks In the Year a great Quantity of  Roman  Coins were found at  Ramsey  which were believed to be hid there by the Monks upon some Inroad of the  Danes    At every Mile from  Grantham  to  Stangate  are Stones set up by Mr  Boulter  which he design'd to have carry'd on to  London  for the general Benefit  All the Country between  Huntingdon  River and  Peterborough  River is Clay Sand and Gravel but beyond that to the  Humber  Stone  At  Gunworth  Ferry over  Peterborough  River is a Bridge a few Years ago erected where Boats pay Toll The People of  Peterborough  were a good while averse to having their River made navigable out of an absurd Notion that it would spoil their Trade But they begin to be better inform'd or as I may say to have more Wit on the Progress made in that Navigation which I shall mention more particularly byandby when I come to  Oundle    From the  Fens  longing to be delivered from Fogs and stagnate Air and Water of the Colour of brewed Ale like the Rivers of the  Peak  we first set Foot on dry Land  as I called it  at  Peterborough    But before we enter it we must not omit to take some Notice of  Foderinghay  Castle situate on a Branch of the  Nyne  famous for the Imprisonment and Decollation of the unfortunate  Mary  Queen of  Scots  It seems to have been very strong and it had a high Mount or Keep inviron'd with a deep Ditch 'Tis mostly demolish'd and all the Materials carry'd off some say it was destroy'd by Order of King  James  I in Revenge of his Mother's Sufferings They pretended to shew me here the Ruins of the Hall where that Princess was beheaded It was the Seat of  Edmund  of  Langley  Duke of  York  whose Body was bury'd in the Collegiate Church here a  very neat Building founded by  Edward  Duke of  York  likewise interred here The Chancel in which they were bury'd was intirely demolished at the Suppression but these Monuments were restored by Queen  Elizabeth  The Church Windows are filled with handsome painted Glass sav'd by a Sum of Money to the Soldiery in the late Civil War and represent St  Denys  St  Guthlac  Abp  Scrope  c  Peterborough  stands in  Northamptonshire  and is a little City of great Antiquity seated on the River  Nyne  and indeed 'tis the least in  England  for  Bath  or  Wells  or  Ely  or  Carlisle  are all much bigger yet  Peterborough  is no contemptible Place neither Here are some good Houses a handsome Marketplace and the Streets are fair and wellbuilt but the Glory of  Peterborough  is the Cathedral which is truly fine and beautiful and the noblest Piece of  Gothick  Building in  England  but it appears to be more modern than the Story of raising this Pile implies which was near Years ago It wants only to make it complete a fine Tower Steeple and Spire on the Top of it A Mayor Aldermen and Recorder are the chief Magistrates here  In this Church was buried the Body of the unhappy  Mary  Queen of  Scots  abovementioned but it was afterwards removed by King  James  I her Son into  WestminsterAbbey  where a Monument is erected for her in King  Henry  VIIth's Chapel tho' some do not stick to tell us that tho' the Monument was erected the Body was never remov'd  Here also lies interred  Catharine  of  Spain  another unhappy Queen and the divorc'd Wife of King  Henry  VIII and Mother to Queen  Mary  I Her Monument is not very magnificent but 'tis far from mean Here is an old decayed Monument of Bishop  Wulfer  the Founder of the Church but this Church has so often been burnt and demolished since tha  Time that 'tis doubtful whether the Monument be authentick or not  In the Cathedral is the Figure of one  Scarlet  a Sexton who buried the above named Two Queens one Years after the other and under it the following Inscription  You see old  Scarlet  's Picture stand on high  But at your Feet there doth his Body lie  He did interr Two Queens within this Place  And this Town's Housholders in his Life's Space  Twice over but at length his own Turn came  Another Man for him should do the same  He died at Years old  The Chapel here called St  Mary  's is a very curious Building tho' now not in Use The Choir has been often repaired and beautify'd and is now very fine but the West End or great Gate is a Prodigy for Beauty and Variety 'Tis remarkable that as this Church when a Monastery was famous for its great Revenues so now as reduced 'tis one of the poorest Bishopricks in  England    In the Year at  Thorp  the Seat of Sir  Francis St John  by  Peterborough  a Mosaick Pavement was found This was undoubtedly a  Villa  of some  Roman  of Distinction In the Garden are some fine antique Marble Statues which suffer more from the Weather than from Age In the Middle is a  Livia  of a  Colossean  Proportion in the Four Quarters  Diana Amphion  an Orator and a Gladiator upon the Terrace an admirable  Hercules  killing the  Hydra  in the Court Two Equestrian Figures in Copper King  Henry  IV of  France  and Don  John  of  Austria  Over most of the Doors of the House are placed Bustoes of  Bassianus Caracalla  and others These Antiquities were of the  Arundel  Collection  As great Part of  Lincolnshire  which is a vastly extended County remained yet unseen by me I was obliged to turn North from  Peterborough  and take a View of the  Fens  again tho' we kept them at some Distance too Here we pass'd the  Welland  at  Market Deeping  an old illbuilt and dirty Town Then we went thro'  Bourn  to  Folkingham  near which we saw two Pieces of decay'd Magnificence one was the old demolish'd Monastery of  Sempringham  the Seat of the  Gilbertine  Nuns famous for Austerity and the other was the antient House of the Lord  Clinton  Queen  Elizabeth  's Admiral where that great and noble Person once lived in the utmost Splendor The House tho' in its full Decay shews what it has been and the Plaister of the Ceilings and Walls in some Rooms is so fine so firm and so intire that they break it off in large Flakes and it will bear Writing on with a Pencil or Steel Pen like the Leaves of a Tablebook This Sort of Plaister I have not seen anywhere so prodigiously fine except in the Palace of  Nonesuch  in  Surrey  near  Epsom  before it was demolished by the Lord  Berkley    From hence we cross'd Part of the great Heath mentioned before and came into the high Road again at  Ancaster  a small but antient  Roman  Village call'd  Segeloci  It is full of Remnants of Antiquity a sufficient Testimony of which may be deduc'd from the Traffick which the Town'speople have for many Years carry'd on with the Sale of them After a Shower the Schoolboys and Shepherds look for them on the Declivities and never return empty  The Town consists of one Street running North and South along the Road There is a Spring at both Ends of the Town which no doubt was the Reason for the  Romans  pitching it at this Place for there is no more Water from hence to  Lincoln    On the West Side of the Town is a Road formerly design'd for the Convenience of those who  travelled when the Gates were shut In the Churchyard are two Priests cut in Stone  This must have been a populous Place from the large Quarries about it and the Rock lying a very little way beneath the Surface  From  Ancaster  we came to  Grantham  famous for a very fine Church and its Spire Steeple The general Notion that this Steeple stands leaning is certainly a vulgar Error I had no Instrument indeed to judge it by but according to the strictest Observation I could not perceive it or any thing like it and am much of Opinion with that excellent Poet  'Tis Height makes  Grantham  Steeple stand awry  The chief Magistrate here is an Alderman assisted by Twelve Justices This is a neat pleasant wellbuilt and populous Town has a good Market and the Inhabitants are said to have a very good Trade and to be generally rich  It was certainly a  Roman  Town and Remains of a Castle have been formerly dug up there The Spire Steeple is Yards high and equalled only by another in this County at  Louth  besides the Tower of  Boston  Here were many Religious Houses Ruins of some of which still remain In one just by the Marketplace is a very pretty little Chapel or Oratory adorned with Imagery Here is a good Freeschool erected by  Richard Fox  Bishop of  Winchestor  where Sir  Isaac Newton  received the first Principles of Literature under the famous  William Walker  then Schoolmaster This Town lying on the great Northern Road is famous as well as  Stamford  for abundance of very good Inns some of them fit to entertain Persons of the greatest Quality and their Retinues and it is a great Advantage to the Place  Within a Mile of  Grantham  stands  Belton  a latebuilt House belonging to the Family of  Brownlow  Lord  Tyrconnel  in  Ireland  one of the most regular  and beautiful Seats in this County adorned with curious Gardens and a large Park But I should not omit to take some Notice before I quit  Lincolnshire  of the Duke of  Ancaster  's pleasant Seat at  Grimsthorpe  It is a handsome and commodious House the Park is large and beautiful the  Lawn  there whereon is an annual Horserace is delightful In the Middle of the Park stood  Vaudy Abbey  founded  Anno  some small Ruins of which are still to be seen  From a Hill about a Mile beyond this Town Northwest being on the great  York  Road we had a Prospect again into the Vale of  Bever  or  Belvoir  which I mentioned before and which spreads itself here into three Counties to wit  Lincoln Leicester  and  Rutlandshires  also here we had a distant View of  Belvoir  Castle which 'tis supposed took its Name from the Situation from whence there is so fine a Prospect over the Country that you see from the Hill into  Lincoln Nottingham Derby Leicester Rutland  and  Northamptonshires  The Castle or Palace for such it now is of  Belvoir  is the Seat of the noble Family of  Manners  Dukes of  Rutland  who have also a very noble Estate equal to the Demesnes of some Sovereign Princes extending itself into  Nottingham  and  Derbyshires  far and wide and in which Estate they have an immense subterranean Treasure never to be exhausted I mean the Leadmines and Coalpits of which I shall say more in their Place  In the fine Gallery of this noble Seat are very antient and modern Family and other Pictures particularly the Original one of King  Charles  I as he sat at his Trial  At  Bottesworth  on the Edge of  Lincolnshire  we visited the Tombs of the  Manners  noble Family which are worth seeing  The other Towns which lie on the Southwest of the  Witham  in this County not already mentioned are    Beckingham  an inconsiderable little Place lying North of  Grantham      Dunnington  a good Markettown noted for large Quantities of Hemp and Hemp Seed    Seaford  situate in a Valley on a little River which is so rapid that its Streams never freeze It has a good Market and a long square Marketplace facing Three Streets And also    Bourne  famous for the Inauguration of  Edmund  King of the  EastAngles    Turning Southward from hence we enter'd  Rutlandshire  remarkable for being the least County in  England  having but Two Markettowns in it  viz Okeham  and  Uppingham    Okeham  stands in the rich Valley of  Cathross  It has a Castle in which the Assizes are held an Hospital for the Poor and a Freeschool for the Education of Youth 'Tis a Custom in this Town that when a Nobleman comes on Horseback within its Precincts he is obliged to pay Homage of a Shoe from his Horse or to commute for it in Money  Uppingham  is a new wellbuilt Town standing on a Hill and has also an Hospital and Freeschool  This County tho' so small is famous for abundance of fine Seats of the Gentlemen and some of first Rank as particularly the Earls of  Gainsborough  and  Winchelsea  The late Earl of  Nottingham  at a very great Expence rebuilt the antient Seat of  Burleigh on the Hill  near  Oakham  and on the Edge of the Vale of  Cathross  It would take up too much of my Room to describe as I ought this noble House with its curious Paintings fine Library and delightful Gardens I can only observe that tho' there may be some sumptuous Palaces  in  England  which abounds with so many fine ones that excel in this or that Particular I do not know a House in  Britain  which excels all the rest in so many Particulars  I cannot help mentioning here that I was drawn to make a Visit in my Journey to the Reverend Mr  Edward Roberts  of  Glaston  in this little County purely for the sake of his excellent Character and we were received by him with great Courtesy This Gentleman had a very small Living in the County the Income of which with the Surplus of his Estate he devoted to the Necessitous and of late Years had provided himself with all Sorts of Medicines from  London  so that his Time was spent in relieving the Poor in a double Capacity as a Divine and a Physician He often refused Promotions in the Church tho' his Rectorship was accounted the poorest in the County he disapproved Pluralities and always look'd with Love on his Parish as his Family but this excellent Clergyman died a few Months after we were there in  March  universally lamented His Brother  Thomas Roberts    Esq  died about Twelve Months before him with as good a Character for a Lawyer as this Gentleman had for a Divine for he would give his Advice  gratis  as well as his Practice to all without Exception and tho' a great Friend to the present Royal Family would never accept of Place or Pension and never would interfere in Elections which he thought should always be left free and uninfluenced  From hence we came to  St Martins  and stopp'd at the  George  out of Curiosity because it is reckoned one of the greatest Inns in  England  and thence proceeded to  Stamford  This Town is placed in a kind of an Angle of the County of  Lincoln  just upon the Edge of Three Counties  viz Lincoln Northampton  and  Rutland  this Town boasts greatly too  of its Antiquity and indeed it has evident Marks of its having been a very great Place in former Days  History tells us it was burnt by the  Danes  above Years ago being then a flourishing City it was also once an University and here are still the Remains of Two Colleges one called  Blackhall  and the other  Brazen Nose  on the Gate whereof is a great  Brazen Nose  and a Ring through it like that at  Oxford  nor could it take this from  Oxford  but  Oxford  from that which is as old as  Edward  III at the least while that at  Oxford  was not built before  Henry  VII But the famous Camps and Military Ways which still appear at and near this Town are a more visible Testimony of its having been a very antient Town and that it was considerable in the  Romans  Time  It is now a very fair wellbuilt and wealthy Town consisting of Six Parishes including that of  St Martin  in  Stamfordbaron  that is to say in that Part of the Town which stands over the River which tho' it is not a Part of the Town critically speaking being not in the Liberty and in another County yet 'tis all called  Stamford  and is rated with it in the Taxes  The Government of this Town is by a Mayor and Aldermen and not as some write by an Alderman and Comburgesses  They boast in this Town of very great Privileges especially to their Mayor such as being freed from the Sheriff's Jurisdiction and from being impanelled on Juries out of the Town to have the Return of all Writs to be freed from all LordsLieutenants and from their Musters and for having the Militia of the Town commanded by their own Officers the Mayor being the King's LordLieutenant and immediately under his Majesty's Command and to be esteemed within the Liberties and Jurisdiction of the Town the second Man in the Kingdom and  the Grant of those Privileges concludes thus  Ut ab antiquo usu fuerunt  As of antient Time they had been accustomed so that this Charter which was granted by  Edward  IV  Anno  seems to be only a Confirmation of former Privileges not a Grant of new ones  In the Church of  St Martin  in  Stamfordbaron  is a very noble Monument of  William Cecil  Lord  Burleigh  who lies buried there in a large Vault just under it and opposite to it on the North Side is a more antient but handsome Monument tho' not so magnificent as the former in Memory of  Richard Cecil    Esq  and  Jane  his Wife the Father and Mother of the said famous Lord  Burleigh  also a more modern Monument for the great Earl who reedify'd the House and for his Countess a Sister of the late Duke of  Devonshire  this is a finished Piece 'tis all of the finest Marble and was made at  Florence  and sent over The said Earl died on his Return from  Rome  at  Issy  near  Paris Aug    There is a very fine Stone Bridge over the River  Welland  of Five Arches and the Townhall is in the Upperpart of the Gate upon or at the End of the Bridge which is a very handsome Building Here are Two constant Weekly Markets Three annual Fairs and a great Midlent Mart but the latter is not now so considerable as it is reported to have been formerly  But the Beauty of  Stamford  is the Neighbourhood of the noble Palace of the Earl of  Exeter  called  Burleighhouse  built by the said Lord  Burleigh  Lord High Treasurer to Queen  Elizabeth    This House is situated in  Northamptonshire  it is built all of Freestone looks more like a Town than a House at which Avenue soever you come to it the Towers and the Pinacles so high and placed at such a Distance from one another look like so  many distant Parish Churches in a great Town and a large Spire covered with Lead over the Clock in the Centre looks like the Cathedral or chief Church of the Town  The House stands on an Eminence which rises from the North Entrance of the Park coming from  Stamford  on the other Side  viz  South and West the Country lies on a Level with the House and is a fine Plain with Posts and other Marks for Horseraces As the Entrance looks towards the flat low Grounds of  Lincolnshire  it gives the House a most extraordinary Prospect into the  Fens  so that you may see from thence near Miles without any thing to intercept the Sight  As you mount the Hill you come to a fine Esplanade before the great Gate or first Entrance of the House where is a small but very handsome Semicircle taken in with an Iron Balustrade and from this rising a few Steps you enter a most noble Hall but made infinitely more noble by the invaluable Paintings with which it is so filled that there is not room to place any thing between them  John  Earl of  Exeter  Grandfather of his present Lordship had a great Genius for Painting and Architecture and a superior Judgment in both as every Part of this noble Structure will testify for he changed the whole Face of the Building pulled down great Part of the Front next the Garden and turned the old  Gothick  Windows into those spacious Sashes which are now seen there and tho' the Founder who had also an exquisite Taste as the Manner of Buildings then was had so well ordered the Situation and Avenues of the whole Fabrick that nothing was wanting of that Kind and had also contrived the House itself in a most magnificent manner the Rooms spacious the Ceilings lofty and the Decorations just yet the late Earl found Room for Alterations infinitely to the Advantage of the Whole  as particularly a noble Staircase a whole Suite of fine Apartments with Rooms of State fit for the Entertainment of a Prince especially those on the Garden Side  As the noble Lord abovementioned loved Paintings so he had infinite Advantage in procuring them for he not only travelled Three times into  Italy  and stay'd every time a considerable while at  Florence  but his princely Deportment and fine Accomplishments procured him the personal Esteem of the Great Duke who assisted him in the Purchace of many excellent Pieces and likewise presented him with several others of great Value  Among the rest there is in the great Hall his Lordship's Picture on Horseback done by the Great Duke's principal Painter at his Highness's Charge and given to his Lordship as a Mark of special Favour there is also a fine Piece of  Seneca  bleeding to Death in the warm Bath and dictating his last Morals to his Scholars a Piece so excellent that I have been told the late King of  France  offered the Earl Pistoles for it  The Staircase the Ceilings of all the fine Lodgings the Chapel the Hall the late Earl's Closet are all finely painted by the celebrated VARRIO whom the Earl kept Years in his Family wholly imploy'd in them and allow'd him a Coach and Horses an Equipage a Table and Servants and a very considerable Pension  By the Park Wall or as some think thro' the Park adjoining to  Burleighhouse  passed an old  Roman  Highway beginning at  Caster  a little Village near  Peterborough  but which was antiently the  Roman  Station or Colony  Durobrevum  as I have said This whole Town takes in Three Squares of full Feet each two of which are allotted to the Castle the third is an Area lying to the East before it between the Castle and the Hill which is still the  Marketplace From under the Castlewalls almost quite round rise many quick Springs but of these the  Syfer  Spring is the most noted having now Four Fluxes of Water from between the Joints of great Stones laid flat like a Wall and join'd together with Lead probably by the  Romans  being under their Wall It is very pleasantly overshaded with Trees Its Name is  Saxon  and signifies  pure  which Appellation it well deserves The  Roman  Way is still to be seen and is now called  The Fortyfeet Way  passing from  Gunworth Ferry  and  Peterborough  to  Stamford  This was as the Antiquaries are of Opinion the great Road into the  North  which is since turned from  Stilton  in  Huntingdonshire  to  Wandsworth  or  Wandsford  where is a very good Bridge over the the River  Nyne  which coming down from  Northampton  as I have observed already passed thence by  Peterborough  and so into the  Fen  Country But I am of Opinion neither this nor  Wandsford  was the antient  Northern  Road used by the  Romans  for 'tis evident that the great  Roman  Causway is still seen on the Lefthand of that Road and passing the  Nyne  at a Place called  Water Neuton  went directly to  Stamford  and passed the  Welland  just above that Town but not in the Place where the Bridge stands now and this  Roman  Way is still to be seen both on the South and the North Side of the  Welland  stretching itself on to  Brig Casterton  a little Town upon the River  Guash  about Three Miles beyond  Stamford  which was as all Writers agree another  Roman  Station and was called  Guasennae  by the Antients from whence the River is supposed also to take its Name whence it went on to  Panton  another very considerable Colony and so to  Newark  where it crossed the  Foss    Hence the Road goes by  Stretton  then leaves a little on the Lefthand  Colsterworth  highly memorable  for being the Birthplace of the great Philosopher Sir  Isaac Newton    This  Fortyfoot Way  then must be a Crossroad from  Caster  and by that from the  Fen  Country so leading into the great Highway at  Stamford  as likewise another Crossroad went out of the said great Road at  Panton  a Village of Antiquity near  Ancaster  to the Town of  Ancaster  where a  Roman  Cohort was stationed and thence joined the  Foss  again at  Lincoln    Near this little Village of  Caster  lives the Lord  Fitzwilliams  of an antient Family but of an  Irish  Title his Lordship some Years ago built a very fine Stone Bridge over the River  Nyne  near  Gunworth  where formerly was the Ferry as I have mentioned before for the passing of which in a Coach we paid  s    d  As we pass by  Burleighpark  Wall on the great Road we see on the West Side not above a Mile from it another House built by the same Lord  Burleigh  and which might pass for a very noble Seat  were not  Burleigh  by  This is called  Wathorp  and stands just on the great  Roman  Way mentioned above this is the House of which the old Earl is reputed to have said he built it to  remove to and to be out of the Dust while  Burleighhouse  was sweeping    From hence we went to  Oundle  being told that the famous Drum was to be heard at that time in the Well but tho' we saw the Well we heard no Drum or any Noise at all No Doubt it is owing if there be any thing in it to the Passage of the Water and Air Here are two long Stone Bridges  Lowick  Church on the Side of a Hill is very fine The Monuments of the Founder  John de Drayton  of the  Veres  and  Staffords  Earl of  Wiltshire  c are to be seen here as is that of the late Duchess of  Norfolk  who after her Divorce married Sir  John  Germayn  of  Draytonhouse  who in a manner intirely new built this antient Seat  Oundle  is almost surrounded by the River over which it has Two handsome Stone Bridges It is a neat uniformbuilt Town  The  Nyne  has a Range of eminent Towns along the Banks of it  viz Northampton Wellingborough Highamferris Thrapston Oundle Foderinghay Wandsford  and  Peterborough  all in this County The two first I have already mention'd  Highamferris  is a small neat and healthful Mayortown pleasantly seated on a rising Ground and is also an antient Borough  Thrapston  is delightfully situated in a fine Valley and surrounded wlth a rich Soil and well water'd It has a fine Bridge over the  Nyne  but is not eminent either for Trade or Buildings tho' it will probably soon change its Face by virtue of an Act passed for making the  Nyne  navigable which has had so good an Effect that when I was last there the th of  November  on that very Day Boats were brought up to  Thrapston  for the first time which occasioned much Joy in the Town  Here also is a most beautiful Range of Meadows and Pastures perhaps not to be equalled in  England  for Length They stretch uninterrupted from  Peterborough  to  Northampton  which is near Miles in Length and in some Places are near two Miles in Breadth the Land rich the Grass fine and the Cattle which feed on them hardly to be number'd  Northwest of this River lies  Kettering  a handsome wellfrequented Town upon a rising Ground and beyond that again is  Rothwell  a pretty good Markettown  From  Oundle  we travelled Northeast into  Yarley  in  Huntingdonshire  a little Town tolerably well built  The Church has a neat lofty Spire In our Way hither we crossed the  Watlingstreet  Way At  Overton  now called  Cherry Orton  a Village near  Gunworth  Ferry is an old Mansionhouse formerly belonging to a very antient and almost forgotten Family of great Men called  Lovetoft  On the other Side of the River is the fine House I mentioned before belonging to Sir  Francis St John  Bart which affords a very beautiful Prospect to Travellers as they pass from the Hill beyond  Stilton  to  Wandsford  Bridge This  Wandsford  has obtained an idle Addition to its Name from a Story firmly believed by the Country People  viz  That a great Flood coming hastily down the River  Nyne  in Haymakingtime a Country Fellow having taken up his Lodging on a Cock of Hay in the Meadow was driven on the Hay down the Stream in the Night while he was fast asleep towards  Wisbech  in the  Fens  when being wakened he was seen and taken up by some Fishermen almost in the open Sea and being asked Where he lived he answered  At  Wansford  in  England And we saw at the great Inn by the South End of the Bridge the Sign of a Man floating on a Cock of Hay and over him written  Wandsford in England    Falling down Southward we come to  Stilton  a Town famous for Cheese which is called our  English Parmesan  and is brought to Table so full of Mites or Maggots that they use a Spoon to eat them We came again into the  Roman  Way at  Stilton  which comes from  Caster  aforementioned and runs all the way to  Huntingdon  which we followed thro'  Sauterylane  a deep Descent between two Hills in which is  Stangatehole  noted for being the greatest Robbingplace in all this Part of the County and so came to  Huntingdon  antiently called  Huntersdune  the Countytown situated on a rising Ground on the North Side of the  Ouse  It is a great Thoroughfair on the Northern Road and is full of very good  Inns and is a strong Pass upon the  Ouse  and in the late Civil Wars it was esteemed so by both Parties It was given by King  Stephen  to  David  King of  Scots  as an Augmentation to his Estate and taken away by King  Henry  II However the  Scotish  Kings always claimed it  It is a Mayortown and had antiently Fifteen Churches of later Days but Four and in the Civil Wars they were reduced to Two The Cause of its Decay at first is said to be owing to a Court Minion who procur'd the Passage of the  Ouse  to be stopped which had been navigable to the Town The said River is now made navigable for smaller Vessels to  Bedford    The Witches of  Warbois  in this County have made so much Noise that I shall just mention the fatal End of a Man his Wife and Daughter who were all Three hanged for torturing the Children of a Gentleman in the Parish the History of it is kept in  Queen's  College Library in  Cambridge  and one of their Fellows preaches yearly at  Huntingdon  on that Occasion The Children being sick their Urine was sent to Master Dr  Dorrington  at  Cambridge  who sent a Medicine against Worms That prevailing nothing the Doctor upon second Thoughts pronounced the Symptoms were from Witchcraft It was not long before a proper Family was suspected the Woman and her Daughter were frequently sent for and kept with the Children and the Disease remitted upon the Sight of them but chiefly upon a Confession and a sort of Petition added to it To this Effect was the Girl's  As I am a Witch and a greater Witch than my Mother so I desire that the Pains shall go off from this Child  These Confessions were the chief Point against the Prisoners which they had been prevailed upon to repeat by the Strandersby who had observed the Children relieved upon it as they imagined And  thus Three unhappy Persons were sacrificed to Ignorance and Superstition  I shall take farther Notice of this Subject when I come to  Lancashire  a County formerly famous for Witches and where Persons likewise suffered for this pretended Crime  Here are the most beautiful Meadows on the Banks of the River  Ouse  that I think are to be seen in any Part of  England  which in the Summer Season are covered with such numerous Herds of Cattle and Flocks of Sheep as are hardly credible  This Town is one long continued Street pretty well built especially from the Ground Plot where the Castle stood Here was born  Oliver Cromwell  of genteel and worthy Parents The House is newbuilt but the Room in which he was born is preserved in its first State It has a good Marketplace but the Freestone Bridge or Bridges rather and Causway over the  Ouse  are a very great Ornament as well as Benefit to the Place Here is a good Publick School  Between  Godmanchester  or  Gormanchester  a  Roman  Camp and  Huntingdon  is a wooden Bridge erected over a Rivulet upon Principles of Gratitude and publick Charity with this Inscription  ROBERTUS COOK  emergens aquis hoc viatoribus  Sacrum DD    That is  ROBERT COOK  having escaped the Danger of Drowning consecrated this for the Use of Travellers    On the West Side of this Town and in View of the plain lower Side of the County is a noble tho' antient Seat of the Earl of  Sandwich  the Gardens very fine and well kept the Situation seems a little obscured by the Town of  Huntingdon  In the same  Plain we saw  Bugden  a small Village in which is a very pleasant tho' antient House or Palace of the Bishops of  Lincoln  the House and Garden surrounded by a very large and deep Moat of Water The Chapel is very pretty tho' small There is an Organ painted against the Wall in a seeming Organloft and so properly placed and well painted that we at first believed it really to be one  Erith  is a large Town but without a Market  St Ives  is a pretty neat Markettown but is lessen'd and suffer'd greatly by Fire Here  Cromwell  after he had prodigally wasted his paternal Estate rented a Farm before he was elected Burgess for  Cambridge    Hinchinbrokehouse  which gives Title of a Viscount to the eldest Son of the Earl of  Sandwich  and the Village of the same Name lie at a small Distance from  Huntingdon  And a little Way Southwest stands the Town of  Kimbolton  and that most nobly situated and pleasant Seat of the Duke of  Manchester Kimbolton  Castle where no Pains or Cost has been spared tu improve the most beautiful Situation in Nature with the Works and Ornaments of Art  Kimbolton  Town is the  Kiniubantum  of the  Romans  Here Queen  Catharine  after she was divorced resided for some time  At  Ailweston  in this County are two Springs one of fresh Water good for dim Eyes the other brackish of Use for curing of Scabs Leprosy  c  From  Huntingdon  we came to  St Neots  on the  Ouse  over which is a good Stone Bridge The Church is strong and well built and the Steeple manifests the Skill of the Artist much to his Advantage The Town takes its Name from  Neotus  a learned and pious Man who was interred here from whom likewise  St Neots  in  Cornwall  takes its Name where he for some time resided Hither  Coals are brought by Water and convey'd by Land around the Country  Here we enter'd  Bedfordshire  and came to  Bedford  the chief Town for it has no City in it tho' this Town is larger and more populous than several Cities in  England  It is one of the Seven Counties which they say lie together and have not one City among them namely  Huntingdon Bedford Bucks Berks Hertford Essex  and  Suffolk    It is remarkable that tho' a great Part of this County  viz  the two whole Hundreds of  Stodden  and  Bedford  lie on the North of the  Ouse  yet there is but one Markettown in all that Side of the  Ouse  beside  Bedford    It is also remarkable that tho' the  Ouse  by a long and winding Course cuts thro' the County so as to make above Miles between  Oulney  and  St Neots  not above by Land yet in all that Course it receives only the little River  Ivel  which falls into it a little above  Temsford    Bedford  is a large populous thriving pleasant and wellbuilt Mayortown it has five Parish Churches a very fine Stone Bridge over the  Ouse  and the High Street especially is very handsome and wellbuilt here is also a fair Marketplace but it is much improved lately in new Buildings The River hath also been made navigable and runs thro' the Town It had formerly a Castle and now where it stood is one of the most beautiful Bowlinggreens in the Kingdom It has Two Hospitals for Lazars and another for Eight poor People Here is a Freeschool well endow'd and a Charityschool for Forty Children and tho' the Town is not upon any of the great Roads in  England  yet it is full of very good Inns which afford elegant Entertainment for here is the best Market for all Sorts of Provisions that is to be seen at any Country Town in all these  Parts of  England  and the Reason of it is that tho' it is so far from  London  yet the Higglers or Carriers buy great Quantities of Provisions here for the  London  Markets here also is a very good Trade down the River to  Lynn    Here likewise is a great Cornmarket and vast Quantities of Grain are bought here and carried down by large Vessels and Barges to  Lynn  where it is again shipped and carried by Sea to  Holland  The Soil hereabouts is exceeding rich and fertile and particularly produces great Quantities of the best Wheat in  England  which is carried by Waggons from hence and from the North Part of the Country Miles beyond this to the Markets of  Hitchin  and  Hertford  and bought again there and ground and carried in the Meal still by Land to  London    Indeed the whole Product of this County may be said to be Wheat and Malt for  London  for here are very few Manufactures except those of Straw Hats and Bone Lace of which by itself There are but Ten Markettowns in the whole County which I shall recount as I took them in my Course  Potton  which lies on the Borders of  Cambridgeshire  and of no Note Southward stands  Biggleswade  a pleasant situated Place on the  Ivel  and furnished with a great Number of good Inns for accommodating Travellers between  London  and  York  Still more Southward lies  Shefford  between two Rivulets over each of which is a Bridge  West of this Town stands  Ampthill  a pretty Town delightfully seated between two Hills Near it is a large Park with a great Mansionhouse in it which King  Charles  II gave to the Noble Family of  Bruce  who had their Title of Viscount from this Town notwithstanding which and that they were always Hereditary Stewards of the  Manor  of  Ampthill    yet the present Lord  Bruce  lately sold his whole Estate here to his Grace the Duke of  Bedford    Queen  Catharine  after she was divorced chose this Town as one of her Retiringplaces Farther Southward is  Woburn  noted for having Plenty of Fullers Earth near it and likewise another Kind of Earth which petrifies Wood into Stone This Town having been almost demolished by a terrible Fire which happened a few Years ago is now rebuilt and makes no mean Appearance It belongs almost all of it to his Grace the Duke of  Bedford  who finished in  Feb  a fine and commodious Marketplace here  The Duke's House called  Woburn Abbey  is just by the Town a good old House and exceedingly pleasant by its Situation which is in a fine large Park walled round The Duke had once designed to have pulled down the old House and to rebuild it in a magnificent manner but laid aside that Resolution and only repaired it There are many noble Rooms in it and particularly a very capacious and long Gallery furnished with a great Variety of fine Pictures chiefly of the  Russel  Family the Wainscoting of this noble Apartment is strewed as one may say with gilded Stars which have a pretty Effect among the Pictures A Room has been laid into this Gallery at one End where a good Billiardtable is placed  Before the House is a very large Bason of Water surrounded with a fine broad Gravelwalk which is bounded with Posts and Iron Chains On the Water is a most beautiful Yacht of between and Tons Burden elegantly carved and gilt and completely rigged and mounts Ten Guns which are fired on Occasion of Entertainments  c  given on Board her by his Grace There is also an elegant Boat with a fine Awning over it a Wherry of the common Shape and a Skiff which are very neat and  make a beautiful Appearance on this noble Bason of Water  Near  Woburn  is  Battlesden  the Seat of  Thomas Page    Esq  abounding with many Beauties and still daily improving by additional Works in a very fine Taste  Dunstable  is seated on a Hill in a chalky Ground in the County of  Bedford  It consists of Four principal Streets answering to the Four Quarters of the World It is well inhabited and furnished with many good Inns for the Accommodation of Travellers In the Centre stood one of Queen  Eleanor  's beautiful Crosses which was demolished by the Parliament Soldiers The Situation of this Place being high and no running Water near they are forced to draw it up from deep Wells by means of great Wheels and they have Four large Ponds to receive the Rainwater which as a Mark of the holding Quality of the Soil are never dry tho' they have no other Supply They have sometimes dug Fathoms deep in Search of Springs to no Purpose  Kingsbury  once a Royal Seat overagainst the Church is now a Farmhouse The Church is composed of many Pieces tacked together as it were some of which are very old It was Part of the Priory and Archbishop  Cranmer  was the last Prior who here pronounced the Sentence of Divorce against Queen  Catharine    The Gentlemen of  Bedford  lately came to a laudable Resolution of levelling the Chalkhill near this Town for the Benefit of the Road which in a Frost or after a Snower of Rain used to be so slippery that neither Man nor Horse could keep their Feet which occasioned often great Damage to both to prevent which for the future they imploy'd a Number of Hands to lower it  Dunstable  stands on the  Roman Watlingstreet  just where it is crossed by  Icknildstreet  Here have  been  Roman  Coins frequently found and on the Descent of  Chiltern  Hills not far from the Town is a large round Area of Nine Acres surrounded with a deep Ditch and Rampire called  Mardinhour  It was burnt by the  Danes  and rebuilt by  Henry  I to repress a vast Number of Robbers which infested the Country thereabouts and it takes its Name from  Dunning  one of the Thieves and from  Dunningcestaple  it is now by Contraction called  Dunstable    On the Borders of  Buckinghamshire  stands  Leighton  famous for a great Cattle and Horsefair  Northeast of  Dunstable  on the Edge of  Hertfordshire  lies  Luton  a little pretty Town seated very pleasantly amongst Hills and noted for a good Market and Marketplace  This County is remarkable for having more Noblemens and Gentlemens Seats in it than any County in  England  The Middle Part of the County is well stored with Wood which affords a great deal of Game  Thro' the whole South Part of this County as far as the Borders of  Buckinghamshire  and  Hertfordshire  the People are taken up with the Manufacture of Bonelace in which they are wonderfully increased and improved  Also the Manufactures of Strawwork especially Straw Hats spreads itself from  Hertfordshire  into this County and is greatly increased within a few Years past  Having thus viewed this County in all its most considerable Towns we came from  Dunstable  to  St Albans  where we saw the handsome Almshouses built and endow'd by the  Marlborough  Family and so returned to  London    Yours c  LETTER II CONTAINING A Description of Part of  Nottinghamshire  of  Derbyshire  and Part of Yorkshire  SIR  _HAVING finished the Account of my several Circuits which complete the Southern Part of  Britain  I am now to begin this Circuit from the River  Trent  and to confine my Observations to the Country which is called by some  North by Trent    The River  Trent  is deemed by antient Writers as the fourth capital River in  England  the other three being the  Thames  the  Severn  and the  Humber    Tho' the  Trent  is not the largest yet it may be said to run the longest Course and rises nearer to the West Side of the Island than any of the others it is also the largest and of the longest Course of any River in  England  which does not empty its Waters immediately into the Sea for the  Trent  runs into the  Humber  and so loses its Name before it reaches the Ocean  It rises in the Highlands of  Staffordshire  called the  Moorlands  receiving from the Edge of  Cheshire  and towards  Lancashire  a great many some say and that thence it had its Name for  Trent  in  French  is little Rivulets into it very near its Head so that it soon becomes one large River and comes down from the Hills with a violent Current into the flat Country where being increased by several other little Rivers it carries a deeper Chanel and a stiller Current and having given its Name to  Trentham  a small Markettown in the same County it goes on to  Stone  a considerable Town on the great Road to  West Chester    One Branch of the  Trent  rises within a Quarter of a Mile of the  Dane  from a Moor adjoining to a little Ridge of Hills called  Molecop Hill  near  Congleton  within Miles of the  Irish  Sea As the  Dane  runs into the  Weaver  and both into that Arm of the Sea which the  Mersee  makes from  Frodsham  to  Liverpool  and  Hylelake  and as the  Trent  runs into the  Humber  which opens into the great  German  Ocean these Rivers may be said to cut the Island across in the middle  It is true the Northern Part is much larger than the Southern now  Scotland  is united otherwise the Country South by  Trent  including  Wales  is by far the largest as well as the richest and most populous occasioned chiefly by the Commerce of the City of  London  As for the Towns of  Bristol Exeter Lynn Norwich Yarmouth c  which are large and very populous and carry on a prodigious Trade as well in Merchandize as Manufacture we shall find them pretty near equalled by the Towns of  Liverpool Hull Leeds Newcastle  and  Manchester  and the Cities of  Edinburgh  and  Glasgow    The  Trent  runs a Course of near Miles thro' the four Counties of  Stafford Derby Nottingham  and  Lincoln  It receives besides lesser  Waters the larger Rivers of the  Sowe  from the West Side of the County and from the Town of  Stafford  the  Tame  from  Birmingham  and  Tamworth  the  Soar  from  Leicester  and the  Dove  and  Derwent  two furiously rapid Streams from the  Peak  of  Derby  the  Idle  a gentle navigable Stream from  Rhetford  and  Nottinghamshire  with part of the  Witham  called the  Fossdike  from  Lincoln  also navigable and the greatest of them all the  Dun  from  Doncaster Rotheram  and  Sheffield  after a long and rapid Course thro' the Moors called  Stanecross  on the Edge of  Derby  and the West Riding of  Yorkshire    The  Trent  is navigable by Ships of good Burden as high as  Gainsborough  which is near Miles from the  Humber  by the River The Barges without the Help of Locks or Stops go as high as  Nottingham  and farther by the Help of Art to  Burton  upon this River in  Staffordshire  The Stream is full the Chanel deep and safe and the Tide flows up to  Gainsborough  and  Newark  The Navigation by these Advantages is a great Support to the Trade of those Counties which border upon it especially the Cheese Trade from  Cheshire  and  Warwickshire  which have otherwise no Navigation but from these Parts about  West Chester  to  London  whereas by this River it is brought by Water to  Hull  and from thence to all the South and North Coasts on the East Side of  Britain    The only Towns of Note standing upon the North Shore of  Trent  are  Nottingham  and  Burton  of which I shall speak in their Order  The Counties North of  Trent  are  Yorkshire  which may not improperly be called three Counties as it is divided into three Ridings each equal to some large Counties  Lancashire  which is very large  Derbyshire  and  Nottinghamshire  which are more Southerly I shall begin with these two and take them together  Beginning at the Mouth of  Trent  the first Town of Note that I met with is  Nottingham  the Capital of that Shire and the most considerable in all that Part of  England  The County is small but like the  Peak  full of Wonders 'Tis remarkable for its Situation being bounded intirely by four Counties and those towards the four Cardinal Points a Circumstance peculiar to this County only For its Soil which on the South Part is the richest and most fruitful and in the North Part the most wild and waste even almost to Barrenness of any Part of  England  within many Miles of it For the fine Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen especially those of the Dukes of  Norfolk Kingston Rutland Newcastle  Lord  Middleton  and several others  Nottingham  is one of the most pleasant and beautiful Towns in  England  from its Situation were its Buildings not to be named  It is situated on the steep Ascent of a Hill or Rock overlooking a fine Range of Meadows of great Extent a little Rivulet running on the North Side of them almost close to the Town and the noble River  Trent  parallel with both on the South Side of the Meadows Over the  Trent  is a stately Stone Bridge of Arches where the River is very large and deep having received the Addition of the  Dove  the  Derwent  the  Irwash  and the  Soar  three of them very great Rivers of themselves which fall into it after its passing by  Burton  in  Staffordshire  mentioned before  The Rock whereon the Town stands is of a sandy kind and so soft that it is hewed into Vaults and Cellars and yet so firm as to support the Roofs of these Cellars two or three under one another The Stairs which lead to these Vaults are cut out of the Rock two or three Stories deep to Steps sometimes And these Cellars are well stock'd with excellent Ale of which the Inhabitants are very liberal  among their Acquaintance as some in our Company experienc'd  The Hill or Rock was called of old the  Dolorous Hill  or  Golgotha  because of a great Slaughter of the antient  Britons  there by King  Humber  a piratical Northern Monarch who being afterwards drowned between  Hull  and  Barton  gave Name as 'tis said to that Arm of the Sea which is now called the  Humber  and receives the  Trent  and almost all the great Rivers of  Yorkshire  into it tho' others derive the Name from the dreadful Noise of its Waves  They tell us that these Caves and Cellars served the People for a Retreat from their Enemies and that from thence the Town first took its Name which was  Snottengaham  signifying hollow Vaults in a Rock  Speluncarum Domus  and as Mr  Camden  observes the  British  Word was  Tui ogo bauc  which signifies the same as the  Latin  a House of Dens or secret Caves to hide in  Besides the delightful Situation of  Nottingham  towards the River it is equally pleasant to the Land Side towards the Forest on the North of the Town where is a fine Plain for a Horsecourse where Races used to be run once a Year  At the West End of the Town is a very steep Hill and at the South Side of it a Cliff which falls in a Precipice down to the River On this Hill stood a Castle of so great Antiquity that the Time of its first Erection could never be traced The first Account we read of it is that there was a Tower here which the  Danes  obstinately defended against King  Alfred  and his Brother  Aethelred    Upon the same Situation  William  the Conqueror or as others with greater Probability maintain  William Peverell  his natural Son built another Castle which was afterwards repaired or rather rebuilt by  Edward  IV who added fine Apartments to it  which  Richard  III his Brother still farther inlarg'd whereby it became in time very considerable and so strong that nothing could reduce it but Famine 'Tis certain it has not undergone the ordinary Fate of other fortified Places to be often taken and retaken for it was never storm'd Once indeed it was taken by Surprize in the Barons Wars by  Robert  Earl  Ferrers  who also plundered the Town or City as it was then called  The People here tell us of one of the  Davids  King of  Scotland  being kept Prisoner in it and that  Roger Mortimer  Earl of  March  was hid in a Vault under Ground which they call  Mortimer'shole  whence he was taken and hang'd for Treason  This Report has some Foundation in History but is so obscured by vulgar Tradition that it led Mr  Camden  first into some Mistakes in his Narration and afterwards into a Disbelief of it  Mortimer  with the Queen the Bishop of  Lincoln  and others being possessed of the Castle could have no Reason to hide himself under Ground but it was by this private Passage which goes by Steps thro' the Rock up to the  Keep  that Sir  William Montacute  with others  Edw  III found means in the Dead of the Night to seize him and sending him up to the Tower he was there beheaded  The Castle was granted by K  James  I to  Francis  Earl of  Rutland  and K  Charles  I made it remarkable by erecting there his Royal Standard but he soon quitted it and the Parliament kept Possession of it till the End of the War when it was ordered to be demolished Some Parts of it however were standing at the Restoration when  George Villiers  Duke of  Buckingham  whose Mother was the sole Heir of the foresaid Earl of  Rutland  sold it to  William Cavendish  Marquis of  Newcastle  He in cleared the Foundations of the old Tower a small Part excepted and founded the noble Structure which is now standing  and devolved to the House of  Pelham  The present Duke of  Newcastle  beautified it and wainscoted the Rooms with Cedar and had laid out a Plan for the finest Gardens in all that Part of  England  being to contain no less than Acres but the Design is changed and the intended Gardens are made a Park  The Castle built on a high perpendicular Rock as I have hinted seems to have been modell'd after some of the Draughts of  Inigo Jones  There are many good Pictures in it and it commands a vast Prospect The South Side of the Rock is altogether inaccessible and vast subterraneous Grottoes are cut underneath and a winding Staircase quite to the Bottom ends in  Mortimer'shole  abovemention'd  This Castle at present is much neglected being stripp'd of its best Furniture and Hangings and the Floors of some of the noblest Apartments suffer'd to fall in  St Mary  's Church is a fine lightsome  Gothick  Building with a good Ring of Bells but the great Tower makes a mean Appearance The Butchers Shambles is an old Edifice built for a Granary  They shew'd us the Gardens of Count  Tallard  who in his Confinement here after having been taken Prisoner by the renowned Duke of  Marlborough  at the glorious Battle of  Blenheim  amused himself with making a small but beautiful Parterre after the  French  Taste which happens not to be the reigning one with us at present 'Tis said likewise that this gallant Gentleman left behind him here some  living  Memorandums of his great Affection and Esteem for the  English  Ladies  A handsome Townhouse upon Piazzas has been erected within these few Years for the transacting of the Business of the Corporation Not many Years ago the Hall where the Assizes were held  gave such a Crack that the People were exceedingly frighted and all ran out of it leaving Mr Justice  Powis  upon the Bench calling out after them  Is there nobody will take care of the Judge  for he was so aged and infirm that he could hardly walk But finding himself neglected he made shift to descend from the Bench and hobble out at the Door where he denounc'd Vengeance against the Town which with a very seasonable Piece of Justice he fin'd for neglecting to keep the Hall in Repair  The Town has been at great Expence in making the  Trent  navigable here for Vessels or Barges of Burden by which all their heavy and bulky Goods are brought from the  Humber  and even from  Hull  such as Iron Blocktin Salt Hops Grocery Dyers Wares Wine Oil Tar Hemp Flax  c  and the same Vessels bring down Lead Coal Wood and Corn as also Cheese in great Quantities from  Warwickshire  and  Staffordshire  as I have already mentioned  When I said the Bridge over  Trent  had nineteen Arches I might have said also it was a Mile long for the  Trent  the last Time I was there being swelled over its ordinary Bounds reached quite up to the Town yet a high Causeway with Arches at proper Distances carried us dry over the whole Breadth of the Meadows which I think is at least a Mile and may justly be called a Bridge as that at  Swarston  and also that of  Poul Spooder  in  Wales  are called  The chief Manufacture carried on here is Frameworkknitting of Stockens the same as at  Leicester  and some Glass and earthen Ware The latter is much increased by the Consumption of Teapots Cups  c  since the Increase of Teadrinking as the Glasshouses I think are of late rather decreas'd A Proof one would think that the Luxury of the  Males is less predominant than that of the Females or rather as some would say that the Men are brought over by the Ladies to join with them in the Love of the Teatable and indeed the latter seems pretty much the Case whether it be owing to Gallantry and Complaisance or to Effeminacy and Indolence let those concerned in the Observation answer  As they brew very good Liquor here so they make the best Malt and more of it of any Town in this Part of  England  and send it by Landcarriage to  Derby  thro' all the  Peak  as far as  Manchester  and to other Towns in  Lancashire Cheshire  and even into  Yorkshire  itself for which Purpose all the Low Lands of this County and especially on the Banks of the  Trent  are made to yield prodigious Crops of Barley  The Government of  Nottingham  is in a Mayor Recorder six Aldermen two Coroners two Sheriffs two Chamberlains and Commoncouncil whereof six are called Juniors Here they hold a Court of Pleas They have two Sergeants at Mace and another Officer which they call a Billbearer and two more called Pindars one for the Fields and the other for the Meadows The first is also the Town Woodward and attends the Forest Courts for this Town is within the Jurisdiction of the Forest  I might enter into a long Description of all the modern Buildings erected lately at  Nottingham  but that would be too great a Task only I must take Notice of the House of Mr  Plumtre  which is justly to be admired for its elegant Front and observe in general that as the Castle has oftener been the Residence of Kings and Queens than any other Place so far distant from  London  so the Town has more Gentlemens Houses than any other of its Bigness in  Great Britain  One may easily guess  Nottingham  to have been an antient Town of the  Britons  As soon as they had proper Tools they fell to work upon the Rocks which everywhere offer themselves so commodiously to make Houses in one Instance of which tho' perhaps not old enough to be form'd on theirs is a Ledge of perpendicular Rock in the Duke of  Newcastle  's Park hewn into a Church Houses Chambers Dovehouses  c  The Church is like those in the Rocks of  Bethlehem  in the  Holy Land  The Altar is natural Rock and there has been Painting on the Wall a Steeple where perhaps was a Bell and regular Pillars The River here winding about makes a Fortification to it for it comes to both Ends of the Cliff leaving a Plain before the middle The Way to it was by Gates cut out of the Rock and with an  oblique  Entrance for more Safety  Between this and the Castle is an Hermitage of like Workmanship  Clifton  in this Neighbourhood is a good Seat with pretty Gardens and a noble Prospect and in the Church are many old Brasses of the  Clifton  Family  Three Miles from  Nottingham  is  Wallatonhall  the Seat of my Lord  Middleton  and the noblest Building in this County except  Belvoir  which only exceeds it in Spaciousness but not in Beauty  The Park inclosed within a Brick Wall is much finer than the great Park adjoming to the Castle of  Nottingham  being much better planted with Timber whereas that at  Nottingham  was all cut down and sequestred in the late Wars  There is a pretty Summerhouse panelled and ceiled with Lookingglass which produces a pleasant Effect Underneath is a Waterhouse with grotesque Work of Shells  c  The Hall at the first Entrance into the House is so high that a Man on Horseback might exercise a Pike in it  The Forest of  Shirwood  is an Addition to  Nottingham  for the Pleasure it affords of Hunting There are also some fine Parks and noble Houses in it as  Welbeck  the late Duke of  Newcastle  's now Lord  Oxford  's and  Thoresby  the present noble Seat of the  Pierrepoints  Dukes of  Kingston  which lies at the farthest Edge of the Forest But this Forest is now given up in a manner to Waste even the Woods which formerly made it famous for Thieves are destroyed so that  Robin Hood  would now hardly find Shelter for a Week nor is there any Store of Deer now left at least not worth mentioning  From this Forest I went purposely out of my intended Way to take a View of the Collegiate Church of  Southwell    Southwell  is a Markettown in  Nottinghamshire  its Church is both Parochial and Collegiate which I think is the Case of no other in  England  except  Rippon  in  Yorkshire  To it belong sixteen Prebendaries or Canons six Vicars Choral an Organist six Singing Men six Choristers besides six Boys who attend as Probationers a Register to the Chapter a Treasurer an Auditor a Virger  c  This Church is generally supposed to be founded by  Paulinus  the first Archbishop of  York  about the Year It was surrendered to the King d  Henry  VIII and was actually in the King's Possession until by Act of Parliament  Henry  VIII it was refounded and restored to its antient Privilege and incorporated by the Name of  The Chapter of the Collegiate Church of the blessed  Mary  the Virgin of  Southwell  Queen  Elizabeth  confirmed its Privileges as did afterwards on a Tryal at Law King  James  I  The Chapter have a peculiar Jurisdiction and there are Parishes subject to it to most of which they have the Right of Presentation besides some others in  Lincolnshire  and  Yorkshire  This Jurisdiction is exercised by a Commissary or Vicar  General chosen by the Chapter out of their Body who holds Visitations  c  twice a Year And besides these there are two Synods yearly to which all the Clergy of the County of  Nottingham  pay their Attendance and a certain Number of the Prebendaries and others of the considerable Clergy are appointed Commissioners by a Commission granted by the Archbishop of  York  to preside at the Synods  The Civil Government of the Jurisdiction of  Southwell  is distinct from the County at large It is called the  Soke  of  Southwell cum Scrooby  which is another Town in this County There are about twenty Towns subject to this Jurisdiction  The  Custos Rotulorum  and the Justices of the Peace are nominated by the Archbishop of  York  and constituted by a Commission under the Great Seal of  England  who hold their Session both at  Southwell  and  Scrooby  and perform all other Justiciary Acts distinct from the County  The Church is a strong plain  Gothick  Building it has no painted Figures in the Glass Work nor Images nor so much as a Niche capable of placing an Image in And from hence it has been conjectured that it was probably built before Imageworship was practised among Christians  On  Monday  the fifth of  November  about Ten a Clock at Night the Top of the Ball on one of the South Spires of this Church was fired by Lightning which backed by a furious Wind that drove it almost directly on the Body of the Church in a few Hours burnt down the Spire and Roof melted the Bells and spared nothing which was combustible except the other Spire till it came to the Choir where after it had consumed the Organs it was by singular Providence stopt and extinguish'd The Damage was computed at near Four thousand Pounds  The Church is built in Form of a Cross a great Tower in the Middle in which are eight Bells and  two Spires at the West End There is a handsome Chapterhouse on the North Side of the Choir  The Length of the Church from East to West is Feet the Length of the cross Isle from North to South is Feet the Breadth of the Church is Feet  There are no very remarkable Monuments in this Church except one of Archbishop  Sands  which is within the Communion Rails and is a fair Tomb of Alabaster with his Effigies lying on it at full Length with a fine Inscription upon it in  Latin  greatly to his Honour but which being very long I have not Room to insert  Here was formerly a Palace belonging to the Archbishop of  York  which stood on the South Side of the Church the Ruins of which still remain by which it appears to have been a large and stately Building It was demolished in the Time of the late Civil Wars The Church escaped the Fury of those Times by the good Offices of one  Edward Cludd  Esquire one of the Parliament Side who lived at  Norwood  in the Parish of  Southwell  in a House belonging to the Archbishop Here were no less than three Parks belonging to the Archbishop which though disparked still retain the Name one of which is  Norwood  Park in which is a good House which has been very much inlarged and beautified by Mr  Burton  a Descendant of the above  Edward Cludd    Esq  who lives in it some Part of the Year  There is a Freeschool adjoining to the Church under the Care of the Chapter where the Choiristers are taught  gratis  and other Boys belonging to the Town The Master is chosen by the Chapter and is to be approved by the Archbishop of  York    There are also two Fellowships and two Scholarships in St  John  's College in  Cambridge  founded by Dr  Keton  Canon of  Salisbury  in the d Year of  King  Henry  VIII to be chosen by the Master and Fellows of the said College out of such as have been Choiristers of the Church of  Southwell    From  Southwell  I turned to the Left to  Newsted  to visit the antient Seat of the very antient Family of the  Byrons  who even in the  Conqueror  's Time were wealthy It was a small Priory founded by King  Henry  II and given by King  Henry  VIII to Sir  John Byron  one of which Name having signalized himself very remarkably for his Loyalty to King  Charles  I was created a Baron which Honour still continues in the Family Near this Place is the Head of the little River  Lin    We came next to  Ainsley  which Town gave Name to a Family that were possessed of it from the Conquest to the Time of King  Henry  VI from whence are descended the Earls of  Anglesey  but for want of Heirs Male it came then by Marriage into the Family of the  Chaworths  who have a good Seat here well wooded and watered with beautiful Fishponds  We then turned again on the Right to  Mansfield  which lies in the Forest a large wellbuilt Markettown noted now for its Trade in Malt and for haveing been formerly the Place to which the Kings of  England  used to retire for the Pleasure of Hunting in the Forest of  Shirwood  insomuch that a Manor was held in this County by  Henry Fauconberg  for Shoeing the King's Horse whenever he came to  Mansfield    From hence we kept still to the Right Northeast and came to  Taxford in the Clays  an ordinary dirty Markettown on the great Road to  York  and of no other Note than being situated in a miry clayey Country and call'd by King  James  I  Taxford in the Td  We kept the Road North to  East Retford  so called as it lies on the East Side of the River  Idle  It  is an antient Bailiwicktown and noted for an Exemption of all Tolls and foreign Services It holds Pleas without Limitation of Sums and enjoys many other valuable Privileges and Immunities It has a Steward who is generally a Person of Quality  West Retford  is so call'd from its Situation in regard to the other tho' they seem to be but one Town the  Idle  only dividing them This is famous for a fine Hospital founded by Dr  Dorrel  in and since incorporated It has a Master Brethren a Steward and a Nurse and they have a Garden and Orchard divided into Shares  Chaworth  is a Village just by noted for a fine Rectory of  l  a Year  Higher up stands  Blith  which is a kind of Markettown where are a very large good Church and some old Ruins of a Castle and a Priory  We then fell down Southward and visited the noble Seats of the Duke of  Kingston  at  Thoresby  of the Lord  Oxford  at  Welbeck  and of the late Marquis of  Halifax  but now of Sir  George Savil  at  Rufford  or  Rugford  Abbey all very magnificent Structures though antient especially that at  Welbeck  which is beautified with large Additions fine Apartments and good Gardens but particularly the Park which is well stocked with large Timber of the finest Kind and with great Numbers of Deer For the late Duke of  Newcastle  's Delight whose Property it was before it came by Marriage into the  Harley  Family being chiefly on Horseback and in the Chace it is not to be wondered if he rather made his Parks fine than his Gardens and his Stables than his Mansionhouse yet the House is noble large and magnificent  Hard by  Welbeck  near the Head of the River  Ryton  is  Wirksop Manor  the sometime stately Seat of the noble Family of  Talbot  descended by a long Line of Ancestors from another Family illustrious  though not innobled of  Lovetofts  one of whom being Lord of this Place under the  Normans  built a Priory here and  John  the second Earl of  Shrewsbury  being slain at the Battle of  Northampton    Henry  VI was buried in it which afterwards at the Dissolution of Monasteries was settled on  Francis  his Great Grandson This House though in its antient Figure is outdone by none of the best and greatest in the County It now belongs to the Duke of  Norfolk    Here is a good Markettown also of the Name of  Wirksop  where are the Ruins of a Monastery to be seen in the Meadows on the East Side of it and the West End of the Church which is still standing and has Two beautiful and fair Towers This Place is noted for Liquorice and Malt  From hence leaving  Nottinghamshire  the West Part of which abounds with Lead and Coal we came to  Balsover  in  Derbyshire  which stands on a rising Ground and has a Castle and is the Property of the Duke of  Newcastle  but is no Markettown  From hence we intended to pass directly to  Derby  but being informed that the Moors by reason of the Rocks and Bogs which render the Roads difficult and hazardous were too dangerous to travel over we left them on the West of us and passing thro'  Mansfield  in  Nottinghamshire  and  Alfreton  a small Markettown within the Skirts of  Derbyshire  we arriv'd at  Derby  the Countytown But tho' we avoided the Moors yet we had some Reason to complain of the Roads which we took from the North of  Nottinghamshire  where we were informed that if we had come directly from  Nottingham  to this Town and kept the Midway between the  Trent  on the Left and the Mountains on the Right we should have found the Miles which lie between them as agreeable with respect to the Situation of the Country  the Soil and the well planting of it as any of the same Length in  England    The Town of  Derby  is situate on the West Bank of the  Derwent  over which it has a very fine Stone Bridge wellbuilt but antient and a Chapel upon the Bridge now converted into a Dwellinghouse It is a fine beautiful and pleasant Town and has more Families of Gentlemen in it than is usual in Towns so remote perhaps the more because the  Peak  which takes up the larger Part of the County is so inhospitable rugged and wild a Place that the Gentry chuse to reside at  Derby  rather than upon their Estates as they do elsewhere  Here is a Curiosity of a very extraordinary Nature and the only one of the Kind in  England  I mean those Mills on the  Derwent  which work the three capital  Italian  Engines for making Organzine or Thrown Silk which before these Mills were erected was purchased by the  English  Merchants with ready Money in  Italy  by which Invention one Hand will twist as much Silk as before could be done by Fifty and that in a much truer and better Manner This Engine contains Wheels and Movements which work Yards of Silkthread every time the Waterwheel goes round which is three times in one Minute and Yards in one Day and Night One Waterwheel gives Motion to all the rest of the Wheels and Movements of which any one may be stopt separately One Fireengine likewise conveys warm Air to every individual Part of the Machine and the whole Work is govern'd by one Regulator The House which contains this Engine is of a vast Bulk and Five or Six Stories high  A Patent passed  George  I to secure to Sir  Thomas Lombe  the sole Property of this Invention for Years but the requisite Buildings and Engines and the instructing of proper Persons to work them took  up so much Time and when all was completed the King of  Sardinia  prohibiting the Importation of the Raw Silk made by the said Engines into his Dominions all which render'd the Undertaking expensive and difficult and the Term of Years being near elapsed without any great Benefit accruing from the useful Invention Sir  Thomas  apply'd for a Consideration from the Publick and the Parliament accordingly to preserve so useful an Undertaking for the Benefit of the Kingdom in general allotted  l  to be paid to Sir  Thomas  on Condition that he should allow a perfect Model to be taken of his newinvented Engines in order to secure and perpetuate the Art of making the same The Preamble to this Act sets forth That Sir  Thomas Lombe  did with the utmost Difficulty and Hazard and at a very great Expence discover the Art of making and working the Three Capital Engines made use of by the  Italians  to make their Organzine Silk and did introduce those Arts and Inventions into this Kingdom  This wonderful Piece of Machinery was under the Direction of Sir  Thomas Lombe  or as some say of his Brother erected by one  Soracole  a Man expert in making Millwork especially for raising Water to supply Towns for Family Use  Derby  as I have said is a Town of Gentry rather than Trade yet it is populous wellbuilt has Five Parishes a large Marketplace a beautiful Townhouse of Freestone and very handsome Streets But the Entrance into it every Way is so choaked up with Dirt and Mire that it is no small Matter of Reproach to the Inhabitants  In the Church of  All Saints  is the Burialplace of the noble  Cavendish  Family and an Hospital close by the Church built by one of that Family for Eight poor Men and Four Women  This Church is remarkable for the Architecture of its beautiful  Gothick  Tower Feet high and for the Elegance of its Ornaments as well as Height is not to be equalled in this or in any of the adjacent Counties  According to an Inscription in this Church the Steeple was erected about Queen  Mary  's Reign at the Charge of the Maidens and Batchelors of the Town on which Account whenever a Maiden a Native of the Town was married the Bells used to be rung by Batchelors How long the Custom lasted I have not read but I do not find it is now continued This Union of the Maidens and Batchelors to build a Steeple reminds me of a Bell cast by a like Contribution upon which was this Device  Materiem Juvenes Formam tribuere Puellae  The Government of this Town is in a Mayor High Steward Aldermen a Recorder Brothers Capital Burgesses and a Town Clerk What Trade there is in the Town is chiefly in good Malt and good Ale  Beyond  Derby  along the  Ricning Way  is  Burton upon Trent  where is a Bridge of Arches Here was an old Abbey out of whose Ruins they have within these few Years built a new Church  A Mile below  Derby  upon the  Derwent  stood the old  Roman Derventio  now  Little Chester  Remains of the old Walls Vaults Wells  Roman  Coins Aqueducts Human Bones Brass Rings and other Marks of Antiquity have been from time to time discovered and dug up The River being too rapid for a Ford a Bridge was antiently there the Foundations of which with a Staff they can still feel  A little further North is  Horreston  Castle whose Ruins on a hoary Rock are scarce discernible  It is observable that as the  Trent  bounds the County of  Derby  South so the  Dove  and the  Erwash  make the Bounds East and West and the  Derwent  runs thro' the Centre all of them beginning and ending their Course in the same County for they rise in the  Peak  and end in the  Trent  The  Derwent  is remarkable for its Brownness the  Dove  for its blue Transparency from whence it probably took its Name It is endued with such a peculiar Fecundity supposed to arise from a Bed of Lime thro' which it passes that it has often been compared to the River  Nile    It is not less swift in its Operations than effectual for by hasty Rains which fall from the Hills it sometimes strays over the Meadows and having impregnated them in Hours time retires into its Bed again  It was in one of these temporary Inundations I saw it when having gone from  Derby  to  Dowbridge  as it is called I passed it with Difficulty to see Two Markettowns  Ashbourn  and  Utoxeter  the  Utocetum  of the Antients  The first lies on the East Side of the River in a very rich Soil to the Northwest of  Derby  and the other commonly called  Utcester  is situate due West of  Derby  on the other Side of the River in  Staffordshire  upon a delicious rising Ground of an easy Ascent and very fruitful overlooking a Track of fine rich Meadowgrounds The Town is very ordinarily built but has a good and commodious Marketplace and an excellent Market for all sorts of living Kine besides Butter Cheese and Corn and also all kinds of Provisions  In our Way to the  High Peak  we passed an antient Seat large but not very gay of Sir  Nathanael Curson  From hence we kept the  Derwent  on our Righthand which having overflowed its Banks by the Accession of Floods pouring down from the  Peak  Hills  render'd it so frightful that we contented ourselves with hearing at a Distance its shocking Roar and so came to  Quarn  or  Quarnden  a little ragged but noted Village where is a famous Chalybeat Spring to which abundance of People resort in the Season to drink the Water as likewise a Cold Bath There are also several other Mineral Waters in this Part of the Country a hot Bath at  Matlock  and another at  Buxton  of which in their Places Besides these there are hot Springs in several Places which run waste into the Ditches and Brooks and are taken no notice of being remote among the Mountains and out of the Way of common Resort  We found the Wells at  Quarn  pretty full of Company the Waters good and very physical but wretched Lodging and Entertainment  From  Quarnden  we advanced due North and mounting the Hills gradually for Four or Five Miles we soon had a most dismal View of the black Mountains of the  Peak  however as they were at a Distance and a good Town lay on our Left called  Wirksworth  we turned thither for Refreshment Here we found verify'd what I had often heard before that however dreary the Hills might appear the Vales were everywhere fruitful and delightful to the Eye also wellinhabited and having in them good Markettowns abounding with all necessary Provisions and as for the Ale the further we went Northward the better it seemed to be  Wirksworth  is a large wellfrequented Markettown tho' there is no very great Trade carry'd on in it but what relates to the Leadworks  The  Peakrills  as they are called are a rude boorish kind of People but bold daring and even desperate in their Search into the Bowels of the Earth for which Reason they are often imployed by our Engineers in the Wars to carry on the  Sap  when they lay Siege to strong fortified Places  The  Barmoot Court  kept at  Wirksworth  to judge Controversies among the Miners and adjust subterranean Quarrels and Disputes is very remarkable It consists of a Master and Jurors who when any Person has found a Vein of Ore in another's Land except it be in Orchards or Gardens assign two Meres of Ground in a  Pipe  as they term it and a  Flat  the former being Yards long and the latter Yards Square appointing to the Finder one Mere and the other to the Owner of the Land half at each End of the Finder's and moreover certain Fees and Perquisites for the Passage of Carts the Use of Timber and the like This Court not only prescribes Rules to the Miners and limits their Proceedings in the Works underground but is Judge of all their little Quarrels above  The Produce of the Mines in this Hundred is very considerable the King claims the th Peny Duty for which they compound at the Rate of  l  a Year nay I have been informed that the Tythe of  Wirksworth  alone has been worth to the Incumbent yearly that Sum  Not far from hence lies  Hartington  which gives Title of Marquis to the eldest Son of the Duke of  Devonshire    Near  Wirksworth  and upon the very Edge of  Derwent  is a Village called  Matlock  where as I said are several warm Springs One of these is secured by a Stone Wall on every Side by which the Water is brought to rise to a due Height and if it is too high there is a Sluice to let it out as low as you please It has a House built over it and room within the Building to walk round the Bath and so by Steps go down gradually into it The Water is but just Milkwarm so that it is no less pleasant to go into than sanative  This Bath would be much more frequented than it is if a sad stony mountainous Road which leads  to it and no good Accommodation when you are there did not hinder for from the Bath you are to cross over the Meadows and then ascend a  Derbyshire  Hill before you meet with a House of Refreshment  For some Miles before you come to  Matlock  you pass over barren Moors in perpetual Danger of slipping into Coalpits and Leadmines or ride for Miles together on the Edge of a steep Hill on solid slippery Rock or loose Stones with a Valley underneath the Bottom of which you can hardly discover with your Eye Instead of Trees and Hedges they fencein their poor Meadow for Arable with Walls made of loose Stones pick'd from under their Feet The extended Sides of the Mountains are generally powder'd over as it were with Rocks Streams of Water dribbling down every where and sometimes bolder Cataracts diversify the romantick Scene  At the Smeltingmills they melt down the Lead Ore and run it into a Mold whence it becomes  Pigs  as they call them The Bellows are kept in continual Motion by running Water We were complimented to be let down Yards deep into the Mines if we pleas'd Overagainst this warm Bath and on the Eastside of the  Derwent  we came to a monstrous Parcel of gigantick Rocks seemingly pil'd on one another called the  Torr  A few Inhabitants in little Cottages trusted themselves at Bottom under so ruinous a Shelter I took the Pains on Hands and Knees to clamber near the Top and enter'd an Hermit's Cell hewn in the Rock with a most dreary Prospect before it On one End is a Crucifix and a little Nich where I suppose the Anchorite plac'd his Saint Overagainst it about half a Mile off is such another Cliff but by the Care of a Gentleman who lives underneath Mr  Ashe  is hewn out of the Rock an easy Ascent by Steps and there are abundance of Alcoves Grotts Summerhouses  Cellars Pinacles Dials Balustrades Urns  c  all of the same Materials And by the Help of Earth carry'd up to the Top there are fine Grass Walks with Greens planted along them upon this hanging Terrace whence you have a fine View over many a craggy Mountain  A little on the other Side of  Wirksworth  begins a long Plain called  Brassington Moor  which reaches from  Brassington  to  Buxton  full Miles from  Wirksworth  it is not quite so much The  Peak  People who are mighty fond of raising the Admiration of Strangers told us here of another high Mountain where a Giant was buried which they called the  Giant's Tomb    We rode up the Hill which seem'd to be round with a Precipice almost on every Side of it While we were in quest of the Tomb of the Dead we found the Rock afforded an Habitation for a poor Woman and her Children We entered into their Mansion divided by a Curtain into its several Offices and a Funnel work'd thro' the Top to carry the Smoke out where the celebrated Tombstone was Her Husband she said was a Miner who if he had good Luck could earn his Five Pence and she could also earn her Three Pence a Day were it not for the Care of so many Children but she blessed God they lived very comfortably An Instance of that happy Contentment oftener met with in Habitations like this than in gilded Palaces  We went next by the Direction of the good Woman to a Valley on the Side of a rising Hill where were several Grooves for so they call the Mouth of the Shaft or Pit by which they go down into a Lead Mine As we were standing still to look at one of them admiring how small they were and scarce believing a poor Man who told us they went down those narrow Holes to a great Depth in the Earth we were surprised with seeing a Hand and then an  Arm and quickly after a Head thrust up out of the very Groove we were looking at  Immediately we rode closer up to the Place where we saw the poor Wretch working and heaving himself up gradually as we thought with Difficulty but when he shewed us that it was by setting his Feet and Elbows upon Pieces of Wood fixt cross the Angles of the Groove like a Ladder we found the Difficulty was not much and that if the Groove had been larger he could not go up and down with so much Ease or Safety  Those who would have a more perfect Idea of those Grooves need only see the square Wells in the Church of St  Paul  by which the Workmen go down from the Top of the Church into the very Vaults under it to place the Leaden Pipes which carry the Rain Water from the Flat of the Roof to the Commonsewer They have small Iron Bars placed cross the Angles for the Men to set their Feet on in the manner here represented  When this subterranean Creature was come quite out with all his Furniture about him he afforded us new matter of Wonder which satisfy'd our Curiosity without venturing down ourselves For the Man was a most uncouth Spectacle he was cloathed all in Leather had a Cap of the same without Brims some Tools in a little Basket which he drew up with him not one of the Names of which we could understand but by the Help of an Interpreter Nor indeed could we understand any of the Man's Discourse so as to make out a whole Sentence and yet he was pretty free of his Tongue too He was lean as a Skeleton pale as a dead Corps his Hair and Beard a deep black what little Flesh he had was lank and as we thought something of the Colour of the Lead itself Besides his Basket of Tools he brought up with him about three Quarters of a hundred  Weight of Ore which was no small Load considering the Manner of his coming up and it was this which occasioned that Heaving and Struggling at his first Appearance and it seems he was at work Fathoms deep but that there were five Men of his Party two of whom were Fathoms and the other three Fathoms deeper The Man seemed to regret that he was not at work with these three for they had a Way out at the Side of the Hill without coming up so high as he was obliged to do We then looked on the Ore and got the poor Man's Leave to bring every one a small Piece of it away with us for which we gave him two Pieces of better Metal  From hence entering upon  Brassington Moor  mentioned above we had eight Miles smooth Green Riding to  Buxton  Bath which they call  One  of the Seven Wonders of the  Peak  comprised in that noted Verse of Mr  Hobbs    Aedes Mons Barathrum binus Fons Antraque bina  House Mountain Depth two Fountains and two Caves  This Place has some Advantages beyond what the City of  Bath  can pretend to Here is an open and healthy Country a Variety of fine Views to entertain the Curious and a beautiful Down for the Ladies to take the Air in much more agreeable than the close City of  Bath  which is very deficient in this Particular  And as to the Medicinal Nature of the Waters at  Buxton  hear what Dr  Leigh  says of their Virtues and the Manner of their Operation in his  Natural History of  Lancashire  and of the  Peak His Words are as follow  "The Waters are Sulphurous and Saline yet not fetid but very palatable because the Sulphur is not united with any Vitriolic Particles or but very few Saline it tinges not Silver nor is it Purgative because its Saline Parts are dispensed in such small Proportions  "If drank they create a good Appetite open Obstructions and no doubt if mixed with the Chalybeat Waters that are there also may answer all the Intentions of the  Bath  Water in  Somersetshire  and that of St  Vincent  's too at  Bristol  so noted for curing the  Diabetes  of which I have seen several Instances in these Parts and likewise for curing of Bloody Urines of which I saw a most noted Instance at  Liverpool    "This Bath is of a temperate Heat and without question by a reverberating  Halitus  might be brought to any Degree of Heat but I think in its own natural Heat it may in general be said to be more agreeable to the Constitution and where the hot Baths cannot be safely used this may This last Summer I saw remarkable Instances of its Effects in scorbutick Rheumatisms in Persons that could not go before without the Help of Crutches who came from thence to  Manchester  on Foot without them distant from  Buxton  full Northern Miles"  The Village where the principal Springs are is called  Buxton  tho' there are several of them for they rise unregarded in the Banks of the Inclosures and on the Sides of the Hill so that their Number is hardly known  The Duke of  Devonshire  Lord of the Village has built a large and convenient House for the Reception of Strangers The Bathroom is arched overhead and the Whole made handsome convenient and delightful This Collection of tepid Waters exceeding clear will receive People at a time to walk and  swim in The Temper of the Water is equal to new Milk or Bloodwarm procuring a moderate Perspiration Its Effect is remarkable for giving that gentle Relaxation of the Solids which takes off the Weariness and Fatigue of a Journey and refreshes instantly 'Tis physically useful in many Cases and may be indulg'd in more than the Hotbaths of  Somersetshire  which frequently do Harm thro' imprudent Use Such a one as this naturally is was aimed at by the sumptuous Bagnio's of the  Roman  Emperors  Sir  Thomas Delves  who received a Cure here gave the Pump and a pretty Stone Alcove over the Drinkingspring in the Yard The Water may be raised at pleasure to any Height We found in one of the Rooms these Verses written upon the Wall by a Physician who formerly frequented the Place  Corpore debilior  Grani  se proluit undis  Quaerit aquas  Aponi  quem febris atra necat  Ut penitus renem purget cur  Psaulia  tanti  Vel quae Lucinae gaudia  Calderiae  Sola mihi  Buxtona  placet  Buxtona Britannis  Undae  Grani Aponus Psaulia Calderiae  Which may be thus translated  In  Gran  's fam'd Baths the weakly Patient laves  Whom dismal Fevers seize in  Apon  's Waves  At  Psaulia  shall a Purge so dear be bought  In teeming Throes  Calderiae  far be sought  When here at  Buxton    Britain  's Choice appear  Places abroad noted for the Virtue of their Waters  Gran Apon Psaulia  and  Calderiae  near  As to the Antiquity of these Baths tho' there is not a King  Bladud  to testify for them as for those at  Bath  in  Somersetshire  yet the learned Author  abovementioned observes  "That it is certain they were eminent in the Time of the  Romans Lucan  and others acquaint us that they were extraordinary hot  c  and the Highroad called the  Roman Bathgate  as Mr  Camden  says farther confirms it But it is especially evident from a  Roman  Wall cemented with red  Roman  Plaister close by St  Anne  's Well where we may see the Ruins of the antient Bath its Dimensions and Length"  The Queen of  Scots  took her Leave of this Place with a Distich of  Julius Caesar  somewhat altered which is still shewn written with a Diamond on a Pane of Glass as the last Classical Authority of Antiquity  Buxtona  quae calidae celebrabere nomine lymphae  Forte mihi posthac non adeunda vale  Buxton  whose Fame thy Baths shall ever tell  Whom I perhaps shall see no more farewell  About half a Mile off is that stupendous Cavern called  Poole'shole  at the Foot of a great Mountain and deemed the  Second  Wonder of the  Peak  The Entrance is so low and narrow that you must stoop to get in but immediately it dilates into a wide and lofty Concavity which reaches above a Quarter of a Mile endwise and farther as they say Some old Women with lighted Candles are Guides in this dark Way Water drops everywhere from the Roof and incrusts all the Stones with long Crystals and Fluors whence a thousand imaginary Figures are shewn you by the Name of Lions Fonts Lanterns Organs Flitch of Bacon  c  At length you come to the Queen of  Scots Pillar  as the Boundary of most Peoples Curiosity It was so named by that unhappy Princess when she visited this  Place Nor needed she any other Monument for by this Incident she may be said to have erected one to her Memory which will probably last as long as the Works of Nature tho' every one almost that comes hither carries away a Piece of it in Memory of the Princess or the Place It is a clear bright Stone like Alabaster or rather like that kind of Spar which is found about Lead and considering the Country where it grows is probably something of that Sort  A Stream of Water runs along the Middle among the falling Rocks with a hideous Noise reecho'd from all Sides of the horrid Concave On the Lefthand is a Sort of Chamber where they say  Poole  a famous Robber lived and whose Kitchen as well as Bedchamber they shew you after you have crept Yards on all Fours  The most surprising Thing you meet with in it is the extraordinary Height of the Arch which however is far from what a late Author has magnified it to a Quarter of a Mile perpendicular Dr  Leigh  spends some Time in admiring the spangled Roof  Cotton  and  Hobbes  are exceedingly witty upon it Dr  Leigh  calls it  Fretwork Organ  and  Choirwork  The Whole of the Matter is this The Rock being everywhere moist and dropping some of the Drops are fallen which you see below some are falling and others are pendent in the Roof Now as you have Guides before you and behind carrying every one a Candle the Light of the Candles reflected by the globular Drops of Water dazle your Eyes like the Dew in a Sunshine Morning whereas were any Part of the Arch of this Vault to be seen by a clear Light all this Beauty would disappear  Let any Person therefore who goes into  Poole's Hole  and has a Mind to make the Experiment take a long Pole in his Hand with a Cloth tied to the End of it and wipe the Drops of Water away he  will at once extinguish all those Glories Then let him wait till other Drops emerge and he will find the Stars and Spangles glittering as before  As to the several Stones called  Cotton's Stone Haycock's Stone Poole's Chair Flitch of Bacon  and the like they do not enough resemble what they are said to represent as to be the Foundation of even a Poetick Metamorphosis  The petrifying Water indeed might have exercised  Ovid  's Fancy for you see Drops pendent like Icicles or rising up like Pyramids and hardening into Stone just the Reverse of what the Poet describes of Stones being soften'd into Men  The  Third  Wonder of the  Peak  is  Mam Tor  or as the Word in the Mountain Jargon or rather in the  British  signifies the  Mother Rock  for  Mam  is the  British  Word for Mother upon a Suggestion that the soft crumbling Earth which falls from its Summit produces several other Mountains below The Whole of the Wonder is this On the South Side of this Hill is a Precipice very steep from the Top to the Bottom and the Substance being of a crumbling loose Earth mingled with small Stones is continually falling down in small Quantities as the heavy Rains loosen and wash it off or as Frosts and Thaws operate upon it Now the great Hill which is thick as well as high parts with this loose Stuff without being sensibly diminished so the Bottom into which it falls being narrow is more easily perceived to swell Here then is the pretended Wonder That the little Heap below should grow up into a Hill without any Decrease of the great Hill as it should seem notwithstanding so much has fallen from it But the Fact is certainly otherwise tho' not perceivable  This Hill lies on the North Side of the Road from  Buxton  to  Castleton  at which Place you come to the  Fourth  much famed Wonder styled  The Devil's  Arse in the Peak  The short Account of it is this On the steep Side of a Mountain is a large Opening almost in the Form of an old  Gothick  Arch from its Centre only that the Entrance is horizontal It is upwards of Feet perpendicular and twice as much broad at the Bottom at least  It continues thus wide but a little Way yet far enough to have several small Cottages built on either Side of it within the Entrance like a little Town in a Vault In the Middle as it were of the Street is a running Stream of Water in poetical Descriptions it is called a River tho' not the River  Styx    As you go on the Roof descends gradually and is now so far from having Houses that a Man cannot stand upright in it till stooping for a little Way and passing over another Rill of Water likewise called a River you find more Room over your Head But going a little farther you come to a third Water which crosses your Way and the Rock stooping as it were down almost to the Surface of the Water puts an End to the Traveller's Search  But when we read in Scripture that the Caves of  Adullam  and  Macpelah  were able to receive  David  and his Troop of Men and what Travellers relate of a Cave in the  Apennine  Mountains near  Florence  large enough to contain an Army and when we know that there are many others in the  Alpes  and the Hills of  Dauphiné  and  Savoy  and other Parts of the World this surely can be thought no Wonder unless we credit  Gervaise  of  Tilbury  who tells us of a Shepherd that ventured into the third River in this Den and being either carried over it or down the Stream he knew not whether saw a beautiful heavenly Country beyond it with a spacious Plain watered with many clear Rivers pleasant Brooks and several Lakes of standing Water  Castleton  takes its Name from the Castle that lies near it which is a very antient Building and so situated as to be only one Way accessible being erected on an high steep Rock and the Way that goes to it is so full of Twinings and Turnings that it is Two Miles from the Bottom to the Top  Not far off is a little Village called  Burgh  frequented by the  Romans  on account of the Baths as appears evidently by a Causway leading from hence thither  The  Fifth  Wonder is called  Tideswell  or  Weedenwell  a Spring which according to some Writers ebbs and flows as the Sea does The Basin or Receiver for the Water is about Three Foot Square the Water seems to have some other Receiver within the Rock which when it fills by the Force of the original Stream the Air being contracted or pent in forces the Water out with a bubbling Noise and so fills the Receiver without but when the Force is spent within then it stops till the Place is filled again and in the mean time the Water without runs off till the Quantity within swells again and then the same Cause produces the same Effect So that this  Oceanet  as Mr  Cotton  calls it which has been the Subject of several Philosophick Inquiries is owing wholly to the Figure of the Place and is only a mere Accident in Nature and if any Person were to dig into the narrow Cavities and give vent to the Air which is pent up within they would soon see  Tideswell  turned into an ordinary Stream  This Spring lies near the little Markettown of  Tiddeswall  wherein are a very good Church and a Freeschool  So much for the  Five fictitious  Wonders I come now to the  Two  real Wonders  Elden Hole  and the Duke of  Devonshire  's fine House at  Chatsworth  the one natural the other artificial  In the Middle of a plain open Field gently descending to the South is this frightful Chasm in the Earth or rather in the Rock called  Elden Hole  The Mouth of it is about Feet over one Way and or the other descending down perpendicular to the Earth how deep could never yet be discovered notwithstanding several Attempts have been made to find its Bottom Mr  Cotton  says he let down Fathom of Line which is Yards near a Mile perpendicular  The Author has poetically enough described the Noise the huge massy Stones make which the Country People often throw down here The Hissing of Spears and Arrows is seldom omitted in Poetry to describe the Terror they bring he has here improved a similar Noise into a Mark of Fear  When one's turn'd off it as it parts the Air  A kind of Sighing makes as if it were  Capable of the trembling Passion  Fear  'Till the first Hit strikes the astonish'd Ear  Like Thunder under Ground thence it invades  With louder Thunder those  Tartarean  Shades  Which groan forth Horror at each pond'rous Stroke  Th' unnat'ral Issue gives the Parent Rock  Whilst as it strikes the Sound by Turns we note  When nearer flat sharper when more remote  When after falling long it seems to hiss  Like the old Serpent in the dark Abyss  They tell a dismal Story here of a Traveller who inquiring his Way to  Castleton  or to  Buxton  in a dark Night two Villains offered to guide him but intending to rob him led him to the Edge of this Gulph and either thrust him in or made him believe there was a little Gull of Water and bad him take a large Step which he did into this Abyss and into that of Eternity at the same time One of the  Villains being hanged at  Derby  some Years after for some other Roguery confessed this diabolical Action at the Gallows  It raises an Horror in the Imagination when one does but look into this frightful Hole and so I shall leave it with the Words of the forementioned Author who supposing it one of the Entrances to the Infernal World says  For he who standing on the Brink of Hell  Can carry it so unconcern'd and well  As to betray no Fear is certainly  A  better  Christian or a  worse  than I  I come now to the magnificent Seat of the Earls and Dukes of  Devonshire  called  Chatsworthhouse    This glorious Fabrick may be said to have had two or three different Founders who have all improved upon one another in the Completion of this great Design  The House was begun on a much narrower Plan than it now takes up by Sir  William Cavendish  of  Cavendish  in  Suffolk  who by Marriage with the Countess Dowager of  Shrewsbury  became intitled to a noble Fortune in this Country  Sir  William  died after having done little more than build one End of the Fabrick and lay out the Plan of the Whole But his Lady finished it in the magnificent manner which it appeared in when it was was first ranked among the Wonders of the  Peak  And if it deserved to be so ranked then how much more does it now with the additional Improvements made by the first Duke of  Devonshire  One Thing is observable That the very Disadvantages of Situation contribute to the Beauty of the Place and by the most exquisite Management are made subservient to the Builder's Design On the East Side not far distant rises a prodigious high  Mountain which is so thick planted with beautiful Trees that you only see a rising Wood gradually ascending as if the Trees crouded one above the other to admire the stately Pile before them  Upon the Top of this Mountain they dig Millstones and here begins a vast extended Moor which for or Miles together due North has neither Hedge House or Tree but a waste and houling Wilderness over which when Strangers travel 'tis impossible to find their Way without Guides  Nothing can be more surprising of its Kind to a Traveller who comes from the North when after a tedious Progress thro' such a dismal Desart on a sudden the Guide brings him to this Precipice where he looks down from a comfortless barren and as he thought endless Moor into the most delightful Valley and sees a beautiful Palace adorn'd with fine Gardens If Contraries illustrate each other here they are seen in the strongest Opposition It is really surprising to think what a Genius it must be that should lay out so great a Design in such a Place where the Mountains intercept the Clouds and threaten were Earthquakes frequent here to bury whole Towns and what seems equal to a Town this House in their Ruins  On the Plain which extends from the Top of this Mountain is a large Body of Water which takes up near Acres and from the Ascents round it receives as into a Cistern all the Water that falls which thro' Pipes supplies the Cascades Waterworks Ponds and Canals in the Gardens  Before the West Front of the House which is the most beautiful and where the first Foundress built a very august Portal runs the River  Derwent  which tho' not many Miles here from its Source yet is a rapid River when by hasty Rains or the melting of Snows the Hills pour down their Waters into its Chanel for the Current by reason of its many  contracted Passages among the Rocks Pieces of which of an incredible Bulk come sometimes rolling down its Stream on the least Motion of its Waters above their ordinary Height roars like the Breaches on the Shores of the Sea  Over this River is a stately Stone Bridge with an antient Tower upon it and in an Island in the River an antient Fabrick all of Stone and built like a Castle which are the Works of the said Foundress and shew the Greatness of the original Design but are all except the Bridge eclipsed as it were by the modern Glories of the late Edifice  The Front to the Garden is a regular Piece of Architecture The Frize under the Cornice has the Motto of the Family upon it in gilt Letters so large as to take up the whole Front tho' the Words are these two CAVENDO TVTVS which is no less applicable to the Situation of the House than the Name of the Family  The Sashes of the second Story we were told are Feet high of polished Lookingglass two Feet wide and the Woodwork doublegilt  Under this Front lie the Gardens exquisitely fine and to make a clear Vista or Prospect beyond into the flat Country towards  Hardwick  another Seat of the same Owner the Duke to whom those Things which others thought impossible were practicable removed a great Mountain that stood in the Way and which interrupted the Prospect  In the usual Approach to this noble Fabrick it presents itself thus First the River which in calm Weather glides gently by then a venerable Walk of Trees where the famous  Hobbes  used often to contemplate a noble Piece of Ironwork Gates and Balusters expose the Front of the House and Court terminated at the Corners next the Road with two large Stone Pedestals of  Attick  Work curiously adorned with Trophies of War and Utensils of all  the Sciences in  Basso Relievo  This Part of the Building is  Ionick  the Whole being a Square of a single Order but every Side of a different Model a Court in the Middle with a Piazza of  Dorick  Columns of one Stone each overlaid with prodigious Architraves The Stone is of an excellent Sort veined like Marble hewn out of the neighbouring Quarries and tumbled down the adjacent Hill In the Anteroom to the Hall are flat Stones of Feet square laid upon the Heads of Four Pillars and so throughout In the Hallstairs the Landingsteps are of the same Dimensions the Doors Chimneys Windowcases Stairs  c  all of Marble the Ceilings and Walls of all the Apartments charged with rare Painting of  Varrio  and other famous Hands the Bathroom all of Marble curiously wrought  The Chapel is a most ravishing Place the Altarend and Floor Marble the Seats and Gallery Cedar the rest of the Wall and Ceiling painted  The Gardens abound with Greenhouses Summerhouses Walks Wildernesses Orangeries with all the proper Furniture of Statues Urns Greens  c  with Canals Basons and Waterworks of various Forms and Contrivance as Seahorses Drakes Dolphins and other Fountains that throw up the Water An artificial Willowtree of Copper spouts dropping Water from every Leaf A wonderful Cascade where from a neat House of Stone like a Temple out of the Mouths of Beasts Pipes Urns  c  a whole River descends the Slope of a Hill a Quarter of a Mile in Length over Steps with a terrible Noise and broken Appearance till it is lost underground Beyond the Garden upon the Hills is a Park and that overlook'd by a very high and rocky Mountain Here are some Statues and other Antiquities  I should never have done were I to say all that might be said of this august Palace But two historical  Circumstances in its Honour must not be forgotten  viz  That  Mary  Queen of  Scots  whom we had occasion to mention as a Visitant of the  Peak  was for Years in Custody in this House under the Care of the celebrated Foundress of it In Memory of this Royal Captive the new Lodgings that are built instead of the old are still called the  Queen's of  Scots  Apartment  Happy for her could she have been allow'd to have paid the same fine Compliment to the Owner of it which the Count  de Tallard  did and is our other historical Circumstance when he had been entertained for a few Days by the late Duke of  Devonshire When I return  said he  into my own Country and reckon up the Days of my Captivity I shall leave out those I spent at  Chatsworth  I will close all I have to say of this famous Palace as I may call it with the following brief Extract from the Letter of an ingenious Gentleman to his Friend  "This Place  says he  exceeds all the high Ideas and Descriptions that were ever given me of it The House yields to nothing in  Europe  it is prodigiously great in every Part I never saw such a Number of fine Rooms but the Situation surpasses all Nature has laid herself out in amazing Variety of Greatness and Prospects a fine River below with fine Banks some naked and rocky others declining and woody many smooth and proper for Walking large Groves and Fishponds and Canals between the River and the House which rises proudly upon several Terraces and has behind it a great Lawn intermixed with Plantations and great Walks all rising one above another at first gently afterwards over vast Precipices to the Top of a high Mountain which was all covered upon the Brows with high Trees two or three Miles on either Side then breaks into a thousand Vales and green Hills then resuming  its former Height and Bulk proceeds again a mighty Mountain covered with Rocks and Heath its Sides in many Places adorned with Wood the Whole yielding a most extensive Prospect of many Miles Every body has heard of the great Cascade"  There are likewise other Curiosities in the  Peak  which I need but just mention as the Tottering Stones at  Byrch Over  standing upon a hard Rock one of them said to be four Yards high round and yet rests upon a Point so equally poised that it may be moved with a Finger the  Roman  Causeway called  Bathgate  the several Minerals found in the Hills and in the Lead Mines as Black Lead  Stibium  or Antimony and Crystal  Bakewell  is the best Town in the Northwest Side of the  Peak  it lies on the Banks of the  Wye  and has a good Market the Parish is exempt from Episcopal Jurisdiction Near this the Duke of  Rutland  has a very noble Palace called  Haddon  now intirely uninhabited It was antiently the Seat of the  Vernons  some of whom were Members of Parliament for this County as early as  Edward  III Sir  George Vernon  in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time was styled King of the  Peak  and his Daughter being married to  Thomas  the Son of the first Earl of  Rutland  it came into the Family of the  Manners    The extended Angle of this County which runs a great way Northwest by  Chappel  in the  Frith  which was formerly a Markettown and which they call  High Peak  is perhaps the most desolate wild and abandoned Country in  Great Britain  The Mountains of the  Peak  of which I have been speaking seem to be but the Beginning of Wonders to this Part of the Country the Tops of whose Hills seem to be as much above the Clouds as the Clouds are above the ordinary Hills  Nor is this all the Countenance of these Mountains is such that they have no Bounds to them but the Sea they run on in a continued Ridge from one to another even to the Highlands in  Scotland  so that they may be said to divide  Britain  as the  Apennine  Mountains divide  Italy  Thus joining to  Blackstone Edge  they divide  Yorkshire  from  Lancashire  and going on North divide the Bishoprick of  Durham  from  Westmorland  and so on All the Rivers in the North of  England  take their Rise from them those on the East Side run into the  German  Ocean those on the West Side into the  Irish  for instance the  Dove  and the  Derwent  rise both at the South End of them and come away South to the  Trent  but all the Rivers afterwards run as above East or West and first the  Mersee  rises on the West Side and the  Dun  on the East the first runs to  Warrington  and into the Sea at  Liverpoole  the other to  Doncaster  and into the Sea at  Humber  I shall confirm this Observation as I go on for to give an Account of Rivers is the best Guide to the Geography of a Country But to return to my Progress  We went next to  Chesterfield  a handsome populous Town situate between Rivulets on the South Side of a Hill Northeast from  Chatsworth  well built and well inhabited notwithstanding it stands in the Extremity of this rocky Country for being on the North Side of the County next to  Yorkshire  it leads into the Hundred of  Scarsdale  which is a rich fertile Part of the Country tho' surrounded with barren Moors and Mountains for such the Name  Scarsdale  signifies It is a Mayortown of great Antiquity and was made a free Borough by King  John  It is now a Place of considerable Merchandice and Dealings in Lead Grocery Mercery Melting of Barley Tanning Stockens Blankets Bedding  c  in which they have great Intercourse to and  with  Yorkshire Nottinghamshire Lincolnshire Leicestershire  and  London  also to and with the Towns and Places of  Bakewell Tiddeswell Wirksworth Ashbourne  the  Peak  and West of  Derbyshire  with  Chester Manchester Liverpoole  c It has a fair Church The Spire of its Steeple being Timber covered with Lead is warped all awry It has also a Freeschool and a new large Marketplace which is well supply'd with Lead and with the Commodities abovemention'd  Dornfield  is a small Markettown noted only for its high Situation just on the Edge of the  Peak    We are now entered into the County of  York  which is of larger Extent than any two Counties in  England  joined together being in Compass Miles Its Figure is a large Square and is adequate to the Dukedom of  Wirtemburgh  in  Germany  and contains more Ground than all the Seven  United Provinces  I was at first puzzled which way to direct my Course in this large County but at last resolved to strike thro' the Middle of the County and along the Northeast Part of the West Riding up as far as  Rippon  which is about the Centre of the County  This great County is divided into Three Ridings North East and West Riding This last which I chuse first to speak of is much the largest and most populous and has in it the greatest Number of Towns as well as the most considerable and likewise the best Manufactures and consequently the greatest Share of Riches  Sheffield  situated on a rising Ground is the first Town we came to from  Derbyshire  It is famous for Whittlemaking Cutlery Wares and Ironwork there being a great many good Iron Mines about it and likewise some of Alum The Town is very antient and has been always considerable tho' no Corporation and that it was noted in  Chaucer  's  Time for the same Trade appears by those Lines of his  A Miller  With a rizzled Beard and a hooked Nose  And a  Sheffield  Whittle in his Hose  The Town is very populous and large and the Houses built with Stone but look dark and black by the continued Smoke of the Forges which are always at Work and the Streets are narrow Here were set up the first Mills for turning Grindstones in  England    The Church is very large and spacious in the Form of a Cross and has a fine high Spire  Sheffield  is reputed to excel  Birmingham  in Cutlery Wares and Files and  Birmingham  is allow'd to outdo  Sheffield  in Locks Hinges Nails and polish'd Steel  The Cutlers here are incorporated by the Style of  The Cutlers of Hallamshire  and have many Privileges They are said to be in Number and are called  Mastercutlers  each of whom gives a particular Stamp to his Wares The Corporation chuse a Master and other Officers yearly and it is judged that no less than are imploy'd in the Irontrade in  Sheffield  and the adjacent Tract of Land called  Hallamshire    From hence it will be judged that the said Parishchurch the only one in this populous Town was not able to contain one half of the People of  Sheffield  which induced one Mr  Robert Downes  Goldsmith of this Town to contribute a large Sum and to procure other Sums by Contributions for erecting a Chapel of Ease and accordingly he got Leave  Anno  from  William  Archbishop of  York  to proceed in so good a Work and built a handsome and stately Structure on a Piece of Ground called  Shawclose  purchased by the said Mr  Downes  who also settled to the Value of  l  a Year for ever on  a Preacher to be elected and nominated by him his Heirs and Assigns  But tho' the Building was thus finished and Mr  Downes  had actually nominated to it his Nephew  Joseph Downes  yet the Nomination being contested by the Patrons of the Vicarage of  Sheffield  and the Vicar also it remained unconsecrated till the Year when the Parties differing coming to an Agreement an Act of Parliament passed confirming the same and it is now consecrated by the Name of  The Chapel of  St Paul  in the Town of  Sheffield  Formerly here was a very fine Castle with a noble Mansionhouse the Seat of the Dukes of  Norfolk  but it is now all demolished and decayed tho' the Manor remains still in the Family  In the great Church in this Town are several very antient Monuments of the Family of  Talbots  Earls of  Shrewsbury  who once had great Possessions in this and the next County  In particular  George  the first Earl of  Shrewsbury  who died  George  the second Grandson to the first under whose Care the Queen of  Scots  was here in Custody for Years who died and  Gilbert  his Son who founded the stately Hospital in this Town all lie buried here  The Gift of this Hospital is perpetuated in the following Inscription  The Hospital of the Right Honourable  GILBERT  Earl of  Shrewsbury  erected and settled by the Right Honourable  HENRY  Earl of  Norwich  Earl Marshal of  ENGLAND  great Grandson of the said Earl in pursuance of his last Will and Testament  Anno  Here is a fine Engine for raising Water to supply the Town Here is also a very large and strong  Bridge over the  Dun  as there is another at  Rotherham  a Markettown Six Miles lower Of late several Acts of Parliament have passed to make this River further navigable to different Places which will greatly increase the Trade of those Parts  It is in the Park here that the great Oaktree grew formerly of which Mr  Evelyn  gives a long Account in his Book of Foresttrees And what became of the Chesnuttree near  Aderclift  mention'd by  Camden  's Continuator the Body of which could hardly be fathomed by three Men I could hear no Account of  The Remains of the  Roman  Fortification between  Sheffield  and  Rotherham  are still to be seen and probably will continue to the End of Time  Here is also the famous Trench by some called  Devil's Bank  other  Danes Bank  which is said to run Five Miles in Length and in some Places is called  Kemp Bank  in others  Temple's Bank    Rotherham  is the next Markettown Northeast of  Sheffield  It is noted for its fine Stone Bridge over the  Dun  which is here increased by the River  Rother  from whence the Town no doubt took its Name  The Church is built in the Form of a Cathedral and is a fair Stone Building with a handsome Spire Steeple  From  Rotherham  we turned Northwest to  Wentworth  on purpose to see the old Seat of the  Wentworths  who have flourished here ever since the Conquest and been possessed of the Estate of  Woodhouse  from the Time of  Henry  III Among the several noble Persons of this Family who have resided here was the great  Thomas Wentworth  Earl of  Strafford  beheaded in the Time of King  Charles  I whose Body lies buried in this Church His Honours were extinct in his Son but his Seat is still in the Possession of Sir  Thomas Wentworth  Earl of  Malton  his Great Grandson who has made such Improvements to it  that it is inferior to few in  Great Britain  It is situated on the Side of a Hill defended from the North and West but opens to the South and East towards which Quarters it commands a very extensive Prospect over a rich and beautiful Country which belongs to the Family  The Gardens are large and adorn'd with Obelisks Statues  c  having a Greenhouse and Bathingroom On one Side there is an uninterrupted View into the Park and Neighbourhood Here are two Beauties rarely to be met with anywhere else a Grove of old Firtrees and a Mount of above Feet high perpendicularly measured The Circumference of the Parks is about eight Miles and is beautified with Fishponds Woods of Timber of an uncommon Size and with Plantations innumerable The Turf is of a fine Verdure and the Soil fruitful  The House with the Additions lately made and now carrying on will extend Yards in Front and is built in Imitation of  Wanstead  in  Essex  the Seat of Earl  Tilney  And an Improvement has been added to the Park and Fishponds one whereof consisting of Acres of Ground receives a small Brook which being conducted through a winding Cut for Yards falling down six Steps is brought by a Canal of Yards into the Lake and so affords a pretty Prospect of Water for near a Mile together  From hence we went to see  Stamborough  a fine Seat now belonging to the Earl of  Strafford  the late Earl built the House here which has an exceeding noble Front and adorn'd it with large Plantations fine Waterworks and Gardens to which if we add the Vista's Walks and Woods which are large and numerous it may vie with most Seats in  Great Britain  for Elegancy  We afterwards steer'd our Course back again to  Rotherham  and leaving that Town came to  Sandbeck  a fine Seat of the Earl of  Scarborough  which considering the beautiful Lawn before the House and the Extent of the adjoining Woods remarkable for the Improvements of Art as well as for the Bigness and flourishing State of the Trees may vie with most Seats in respect to Situation  From hence we pursued a Bytrack in order to see a famous Yewtree which stands in a Field called  Cuckolds Haven  and is a very surprising Production of Nature and which I shall attempt to describe It has a strait smooth Stem about Feet high from which the Branches extend in Circles above each other like the Divisions of a Pineapple and of that Shape and of equal Exactness The Figure of the Tree is much more beautiful than could have been made by Art of Man The Branches from Top to Bottom are so thick that a Bird can scarce creep through them in any Part and every Shoot and Fibre put out the same Length each Year and are of so bright and pleasant a Green in all Seasons that at some Distance the Cloathing of the Tree appears like Velvet There is a Hedge planted round it for a Fence and many People have thought it worth their while to ride Miles to view it  Upon Sight of this Curiosity and Thousands of other Trees of the same Species in its Neighbourhood I could not but lament that Avarice should so far prevail especially with Gentlemen as to consent to grant what I call a dead Warrant for the selling of many noble stately ones in the Height of their Glory which for some Hundred of Years had been an Ornament to the Places where they grew when perhaps one of the largest of them which in a Garden or Park would be esteemed above any Price  is sold for no more than or Shillings to make Naves for Wheels  Afterwards we struck into a Byroad which brought us to the Ruins of  Roch  or  Rock Abby  hid by a steep woody Cliff towards the South and by large Rocks every other Way except Eastward One Side of the Nef of this Building from North to South under the middle Tower and some odd Pillars and Arches are all that is now left great Part having been carried away from time to time to repair adjacent Churches or build Gentlemens Seats tho' now Care is taken by the present Earl of  Scarborough  to preserve what remains These Ruins among which large Trees are now grown up and the contiguous Borders make a Picture inexpressibly charming especially when viewed with the Lights and Shadows they receive from a Western Sun and its recluse Situation still from every Noise except the Murmur of a limpid Rivulet together with the Fragments of sepulchral Monuments and the gloomy Shades of those venerable Greens Ivy and Yew which creep up and luxuriantly branch out and mix with the beautiful Whiteness of the Rocks give such a Solemnity to this Scene as demands a serious Reverence from the Beholder and inspires a contemplative Melancholy oftentimes pleasing as well as proper to indulge  The Stone of which this Abbey is built was dug out of the famous Quarry near adjoining and so well known to Masons by the Name of  Roch Abbeystone  which for Whiteness and Beauty is not to be equalled  Another thing worthy of Notice in this Neighbourhood is the Tower and Spire of the Church  Laughton  which for a Delicacy and Justness of Proportion is not excelled by any other  Gothi  Piece of the kind How it happened that so  elegant and ornamental a Structure superior by far to all others round it was bestow'd upon a Villagechurch is matter of some Wonder  The Building stands upon a very high Hill which appears at Distance like that at  Harrow  in the County of  Middlesex  The Height of the Steeple to the Weathercock is Feet and by its Situation the most conspicuous every way of any perhaps in the whole Kingdom being seen from many Places and Miles It has a peculiar Beauty when view'd in the diagonal Line the Pinacles at the Corners of the Tower being join'd by Arches to the Spire as are others above them which break its Outlines and give at the same time a beautiful Diminution but Time will not permit it to stand much longer without considerable Repairs  The Duke of  Leeds  whose Seat at  Kiveton  is at about three Miles Distance has cut a Vista through the Woods of his Park to take this Steeple into his View  About two Miles from  Laughton  we saw the said Seat of  Kiveton  It is an elegant House and the Apartments and Offices are disposed with great Conveniency The Situation is in a wholsome Air and commands fine Prospects Here are pleasant Gardens and a beautiful Park  We omitted visiting many other Places in these Parts which had Time allowed would have answer'd the Trouble of riding uneven Roads which are tiresome hereabouts and hastened to reach  Tickhill  which is a small Markettown and very antient  Here is an old Castle which is large but surrounded with a single Wall only and an huge Mount with a round Tower on the Top of it it was antiently of such Dignity that all the Manors round about it belonging to it were styled  The Honour of Tickhill  The Church in this Town is very large and a handsome Building  We now return'd once more to  Rotherham  and pursued our Course higher up on the River  Dun  to  Coningsborough  Castle called in British  Caer Conan  situate on a Rock where  Matthew  of  Westminster  says That  Aurelius Ambrosius  a  British  Prince vanquish'd  Hengist  the  Saxon  General and took him Prisoner where in Revenge of his barbarous Murder of the  British  Nobility in cold Blood near  Stonehenge  in  Wiltshire  he cut off his Head  Before the Gate is an Agger said to be the Buryingplace of  Hengist  It is not only famous for its Antiquity but its Situation too upon a pleasant Ascent having six large Markettowns Villages many large Woods of Oak some containing Acres and others beautifully cut through into Walks six Iron Furnaces many Mines of Coal and Iron Quarries of Stone for Building nine large Stone Bridges Watermills six Seats of Noblemen of Gentlemen Parks and two navigable Rivers Upon the  Dun  also a little Way from  Coningsborough  is a Place called  Templebrough  a  Roman  Fortification of which the Northeast Corner is wash'd away by the River The Area is about Paces long besides the Agger and on the Outside of it is a large Trench Paces deep on the other Side of it is another Trench cover'd with large Trees  Travelling Northeast from hence we came to  Bantry  which stands just at the Entrance from  Nottinghamshire  into the Westriding a Town blessed with two great Conveniencies which contribute to its Support and make it a very wellfrequented Place  That it stands upon the great Postroad from  London  to  Scotland  which makes it full of very good Inns and Houses of Entertainment  That the little but pleasant River  Idle  runs by it which contrary to the Import of its Name is  a full and  quick  tho' not rapid and unsafe Stream with a deep Chanel which carries Lighters and flatbottom'd Vessels into the  Trent  that comes within seven Miles of it to a Place called  Stockwith  from thence to  Burton  and from thence if the Weather be fair to  Hull  if not 'tis sufficient to go to  Stockwith  where Vessels of Tons Burden may come up laden to the Town  By this Navigation  Bantry  becomes the Centre of all the Exportation of this Part of the Country especially for heavy Goods which are brought down hither from all the adjacent Countries such as Lead Millstones and Grindstones from  Derbyshire  wrought Iron and edged Tools of all Sorts from the Forges at  Sheffield  and from the adjacent Country called  Hallamshire    From hence to  Doncaster  is a pleasant Road that never wants Repair which is something extraordinary in any Part of this lower Side of the Country  Doncaster  so called from the River on which it stands and the Castle which is now ruined is a noble large spacious Town and exceeding populous govern'd by a Mayor and carrying on a great Manufacture principally for Stockens Gloves and knit Waistcoats and as it stands upon the great Northern Postroad is full of good Inns There is a remarkable old Column called a Cross at the End of the Town with a  Norman  Inscription upon it  Here we saw the first Remains of the great  Roman  Highway which tho' we could not perceive before were eminent and remarkable just at the Entrance into the Town and soon after appeared in many Places Here are also two strong Stone Bridges over the  Dun  besides a long Causeway beyond them the Waters of the River being dangerous to Passengers when they swell over its Banks as is sometimes the Case  This Town Mr  Camden  says  "was burnt intirely to the Ground  Anno  and was hardly recovered in his Time"  But it now looks more decayed by Time than Accident and the Houses which seem ready to fall might rise again to more Advantage after another Conflagration  It has but one Church which is large and its Tower of admirable Work There is a remarkable Epitaph on one  Robert Byrk  a famous Man of  Doncaster  who gave a Place called  Rossington Wood  to the Poor  Howe Howe who's here  I  Robin  of  Doncastere  And  Margaret  my Fere  That I spent that I had  That I gave that I have  That I left that I lost  A D    Quoth  Robertus Byrks  who in this World did reign  Threescore Years and seven but liv'd not ane  Here lies also under a plain Gravestone in the Church the Body of one  Thomas Ellis  memorable for having been five times Mayor of the Town for founding an Hospital there called  St Thomas's the Apostle  and endowing it plentifully  We ought not to forget that the celebrated Sailor Sir  Martin Frobisher  was born in this Town He was the first  Englishman  who in the Reign of Q  Elizabeth  discover'd the North Passage to  China  and  Cathai  and found some Streights which he called after his own Name and a Foreland after the Queen's At his first Voyage one of the Company brought back some black Stones out of which the Refiners it is said extracted Gold which encouraged him to load his Ship with them afterwards but they were then found to be fit for nothing but to mend the Highways He signalized himself against  the  Spanish Armada  and received his Death Wound by a Shot at  Brest  in  Britany  the Surgeon having extracted the Bullet left the Wadding behind by which means the Wound mortified and he died as soon as he had brought back the Fleet to  Plymouth    We set forward directly West and came to  Barnesley  a little Markettown wellbuilt of Stone where a Manufacture and Iron and Steel Work flourishes It has a smoaky Aspect and is called  BlackBarnesley  but whether on that Account or from the Moors which look all black like  Bagshot Heath  I know not  After we had passed these Moors we came thro' a most rich pleasant and populous Country to  Wakefield    Wakefield  is a large Town situate upon the River  Calder  which was made navigable in the Year since which Time the Town has increased considerably in Riches and Number of Inhabitants There is a handsome Stone Bridge over the River upon which stands a Chapel erected by King  Edward  IV in Memory of his Father  Richard  Duke of  York  who was slain near this Place as I shall mention byandby The Chapel is Yards long and six broad and tho' very much defaced by Time it appears to have been wrought in a very curious manner A little above the Bridge is a Wash or Dam over which the Water rolling forms an admirable Cascade of a great Length  This Town consists of three great Streets which meet in a Centre near the Church where there might be formed a very spacious Marketplace but by reason of the great Number of Inhabitants it is so crouded with Buildings that there is only a small Area round the Marketcross which is a very elegant Building being an open Colonnade of the  Dorick  Order supporting a Dome to which you ascend by an open circular Pair of Stairs in the Centre of the  Building This brings you to a Room which receives Light from a Turret on the Top and may be called the Townhall for here they transact all their publick Business  The Church is a very large and lofty  Gothick  Building the Body of which was repaired in the Year but the Spire which is one of the highest in the County remains in the same State it was  In this Town was born  John Green  the famous Pinder who fought  Robin Hood  so manfully  From the Bridge you have an agreeable View to the Southeast where by the Side of the River rises a Hill covered with Wood at about a Mile Distance This joins to an open Moor or Common called  Heathmoor  upon which are several Gentlemens Seats very pleasantly situated  South between  Wakefield  and a Village called  Sand  they shewed us a small square Piece of Ground which was fenced off by itself and on which before the late Civil War stood a large Stone Cross just upon the Spot where the Duke of  York  fighting desperately and refusing to yield tho' surrounded with Enemies was killed But tho' Religion has suffered the Cross to fall the Chapel I mentioned on the Bridge at  Wakefield  the other Monument of this Battle is still preserved by being made use of for Civil Affairs Some say there are more People here than in the City of  York  and yet it is no Corporation Town  Here is a Market every  Friday  for Woollen Cloths after the manner of that at  Leeds  tho' not so great yet as all the Clothing Trade is prodigiously increased and still increasing in this County so this M  ket flourishes with the rest  I cannot here pass by my former Observation that all the great Rivers take their Beginning in the Mountains of  Blackstone Edge  and  High Peak  which as I have said part the Counties of  Lancaster  and  York  and that these Rivers all take their Course due East The  Dun  is the first the next is the  Calder  now becoming a very large River at  Wakefield  and the  Aire  is the next which rises at the Foot of the Mountain  Penigent  on the Edge of  Lancashire  of which 'tis said proverbially  PendleHill  and  Penigent  Are the highest Hills between  Scotland  and  Trent  As the  Calder  runs by  Halifax Huthersfield  and thro'  Wakefield  so the  Aire  runs by  Skipton Bradford  and thro'  Leeds  and then both join at  Castleford  Bridge near  Pontefract  three Miles from  Bradford  and in an united Stream form that Navigation from this trading Part of  Yorkshire  to  Hull  which is of so much Advantage to the whole County  I went to see the antient Town of  Pontefract  with the Castle where so much Blood has been spilt in different Ages for here  Henry  the great Earl of  Lancaster  who was Lord of the Castle and whose Ancestors had beautified inlarged and fortified it was beheaded by his Nephew King  Edward  II with three or four more of the  English  Barons Here  Richard  II was murder'd and if History may be credited in a most cruel manner and here  Antony  Earl of  Rivers  and Sir  Richard Gray  the first Uncle and the other Brotherinlaw to King  Edward  V were beheaded by King  Richard  III In the late Civil Wars a small Party of brave Fellows took this Castle by Surprize for the King and desperately defended it to the last Extremity but being at length obliged to yield five of them attempted to break thro' the Besiegers Camp three of whom perished in the Attempt  The Town is large and well built but much smaller than it has been The Castle lies in its Ruins though not demolished It is a Corporation by Prescription and the Mayor and Aldermen are always  Justices of the Peace 'Tis said that antiently none could be arrested at the Marketcross call'd  Oswald  's Cross and a free Way leading to the Cross with about two Yards around it was kept unpav'd in Memory of that Privilege But in the Year the old Cross was pulled down and a handsome Dome supported by a Colonnade of  Dorick  Pillars the Charge whereof was defrayed by a Legacy left by one  Dupere  an Inhabitant of the Town was erected for that Purpose  The Ruins of the Castle shew it to have been a noble Pile A round Tower yet standing is intire in or near which the Tradition is King  Richard  II was slain Adjoining to this Tower are Windingstairs which descend into several Vaults and subterraneous Passages  The Parish Church which stands near the Castle and was prodigiously large received so much Damage in the late Civil Wars that no more than the Shell is now left standing It is a handsome  Gothick  Building in the Form of a Cross with a Tower in the middle which is in good Proportion and was formerly crown'd with a magnificent Lantern enriched with carved Work but it received such Damage from a Cannon Shot during the Siege of the Castle that it was soon after blown down and upon the Surrender of the Castle the Parliament did by Resolution of the House of the th of  March  grant One thousand Pounds to be raised by Sale of the Materials of the said Castle to the Town of  Pontefract  towards the repairing of their Place of publick Worship and reedifying an Habitation for a Minister Part of this Grant might be applied in erecting a plain Octagon Building upon the Tower which finishes the Whole in a manner not disagreeable tho' far inferior to the former In the North west Corner of this Tower are two circular Flights of Stairs winding about the same Centre  with separate Entrances below and distinct Landings above The Inhabitants of the Town still continue to bury in this Churchyard but Divine Service is perform'd in a Chapel adjoining to the Marketplace which is very spacious  At the Bottom of the Marketplace stands the Townhall  Near the Road is a noble Seat which belonged to the late Lord  Bingley  'Tis a newbuilt beautiful House with curious Gardens tho' not very large  At  Pontefract  the great  Roman  Highway which I mentioned at  Doncaster  and is visible from thence hither in several Places tho' not in the open Road is plain to be discern'd and from  Castleford  Bridge which crosses over the united Rivers of  Aire  and  Calder  it goes on to  Aberforth  and so thro'  Tadcaster  to  York    In some Places where this Causeway is broken up the Courses appear to be of different Materials the Bottom of Clay upon that is Chalk then Gravel and upon the Gravel is Stone and then Gravel upon that and so other kinds of Earth where the first was not to be had  In several Places between this Bridge and  Aberforth  the Causeway being disused for the common Road it appears as intire as at its first making tho' a Work undoubtedly of or Years old I take notice of it here because I have not seen any thing like it in any other Place of  England    Castleford  is a Village that stands near the Confluence of the two Rivers above and was formerly a Place of great Consideration insomuch that some Authors call it a City There have been dug up here divers Pieces of  Roman  Coin  Aberforth  is a small Markettown a few Miles Northeast of  Pontefract  and is noted for Pinmaking only  From  Ferrybridge  within a Mile of  Pontefract  extends a large Stone Causeway about a Mile in Length to a Village called  Brotherton  where  Margaret  Wife of King  Edward  I was forced to take up as she was hunting and was delivered of a Son called from the Village  Thomas  of  Brotherton  This Son was afterwards made Earl of  Norfolk  and Marshal of  England  Not far from the Church is a Piece of Ground of Acres surrounded with a Trench and a Wall where as Tradition informs us stood the House in which the Queen was delivered and the Tenants are obliged by Tenure to keep it surrounded with a Wall of Stone  Brotherton  is now noted for burning Limestone which is brought from  Tadcaster  in great Quantities and carrying and dispersing it into the Southern Parts which turns to very good Account and imploys a great many Hands  A little to the South of this Village the great Road divides in two Parts one goes on to the Right to  York  and the other thro'  Aberforth  and  Wetherby  over  Brahammoor  to  Scotland    At  Brahammoor  a Battle was fought between the Royalists and General  Fairfax  where he was worsted and wounded but made so Soldierlike a Retreat that it gained him as great a Reputation as a Victory would have done  But we followed neither of these two Roads leaving the Towns that way for the Entertainment of another Journey so we pass'd directly West along the Banks of the  Aire  to  Leeds  which is a large wealthy and populous Town standing on the North Side of the River  Aire  with large Suburbs on the South Side and both joined by a stately strong Stone Bridge so large and so wide that formerly the Clothmarket was kept upon it and therefore the Refreshment given the Clothiers by the Innkeepers being a Pot of Ale a Noggin of Pottage  and a Trencher of broil'd or roast Beef for Twopence is called the  Briggshot  to this Day  The Increase of the Manufactures and of the Trade soon made the Market too great to be confined to the Brigg so that it is now kept in the High Street beginning from the Bridge and runing up North almost to the Markethouse where the ordinary Market for Provisions begins which also is the greatest of its kind in all the North of  England  You may judge of the Plenty of it when Loads of Apples have been numbered by the Mayor's Officers in a Day  But the Cloth Market is chiefly to be admired as a Prodigy of its Kind and perhaps not to be equalled in the World The Market for Serges at  Exeter  is indeed a wonderful Thing and the Money returned very great but it is there but once a Week whereas here it is every  Tuesday  and  Saturday    Early in the Morning Tressels are placed in two Rows in the Street sometimes two Rows on a Side cross which Boards are laid which make a kind of temporary Counter on either Side from one End of the Street to the other  The Clothiers come early in the Morning with their Cloth and as few bring more than one Piece the Marketdays being so frequent they goin to the Inns and Publickhouses with it and there set it down  At about Six o'Clock in the Summer and about Seven in the Winter the Clothiers being all come by that Time the Market Bell at the old Chapel by the Bridge rings upon which it would surprise a Stranger to see in how few Minutes without Hurry Noise or the least Disorder the whole Market is filled and all the Boards upon the Tressels covered with Cloth as close to one another as the Pieces can lie longways each Proprietor standing behind his own Piece who form a Mercantile Regiment  as it were drawn up in a double Line in as great Order as a Military one  As soon as the Bell has done Ringing the Factors and Buyers of all Sorts enter the Market and walk up and down between the Rows as their Occasions direct Some of them have their foreign Letters of Orders with Patterns sealed on them in their Hands the Colours of which they match by holding them to the Cloths they think they agree to When they have pitched upon their Cloth they lean over to the Clothier and by a Whisper in the fewest Words imaginable the Price is stated one asks the other bids and they agree or disagree in a Moment  The Reason of this prudent Silence is owing to the Clothiers standing so near to one another for 'tis not reasonable that one Trader should know another's Traffick  If a Merchant has bidden a Clothier a Price and he will not take it he may go after him to his House and tell him he has considered of it and is willing to let him have it but they are not to make any new Agreement for it so as to remove the Market from the Street to the Merchant's House  The Buyers generally walk up and down twice on each Side of the Rows and in little more than an Hour all the Business is done In less than half an Hour you will perceive the Cloth begin to move off the Clothier taking it up upon his Shoulder to carry it to the Merchant's House At about half an Hour after Eight the Market Bell rings again upon which the Buyers immediately disappear the Cloth is all sold or if any remains it is carried back into the Inn By Nine o'Clock the Boards and Tressels are removed and the Street left at Liberty for the Marketpeople of other Professions the Linendrapers Shoemakers Hardware Men and the like  Thus you see or  l  worth of Cloth and sometimes much more bought and sold in little more than an Hour the Laws of the Market being the most strictly observed that I ever saw in any Market in  England    If it be asked How all these Goods at this Place at  Wakefield  and at  Halifax  are vended and disposed of I would observe  First That there is a Homeconsumption to supply which several considerable Traders in  Leeds  go with Droves of Packhorses loaden with those Goods to all the Fairs and Markettowns almost over the whole Island not to sell by Retail but to the Shops by Wholesale giving large Credit 'Tis ordinary for one of these Men to carry a thousand Pounds worth of Cloth with him at a Time and having sold that to send his Horses back for as much more and this very often in a Summer for they travel chiefly at that Season because of the Badness of the Roads  There are others who have Commissions from  London  to buy or who give Commissions to Factors and Warehousekeepers in  London  to sell for them who not only supply all the Shopkeepers and Wholesale Men in  London  but sell also very great Quantities to the Merchants as well for Exportation to the  English  Colonies in  America  which take off great Quantities of the coarse Goods especially  New England New York Virginia  c as also to the  Russia  Merchants who send exceeding great Quantities to  Petersburg Riga Dantzick Narva  and to  Sweden  and  Pomerania  tho' of late the Manufactures of this kind set up in  Prussia  and other Northern Parts of  Germany  interfere a little with them  The third Sorts are such as receive Commissions from abroad to buy Cloth for the Merchants chiefly in  Hamburg  and in  Holland c  These are not only  many in Number but some of them very considerable in their Dealings and correspond with the farthest Provinces in  Germany    On account of this Trade it was that the Rivers  Aire  and  Calder  were made navigable under the Direction of Alderman  Pickering  the celebrated Author of the  Marrow of Mathematicks  and performed at the Expence of several private Merchants without calling in the Assistance of the Nobility and Gentry By this means a Communication was opened from  Leeds  and  Wakefield  to  York  and  Hull  so that all the Woollen Manufactures now exported are carried by Water to  Hull  and there shipped for  Holland Bremen Hamburgh  and the  Baltick  And encouraged by the Success of this Act in the Session of Parliament  Anno  an Act passed for continuing the Navigation of the River  Calder  from  Wakefield  to  Ealand  and  Halifax  which will be a farther Benefit to the Trade of those Parts and at the same time several other Acts passed for mending of Highways around all these Parts to  Halifax Ealand Doncaster York c  which will no less promote the Commerce and Trade of this noble County  There is another Trade in this Part of the Country become very considerable since the opening the above Navigation which is the Carriage of Coals down from  Wakefield  and  Leeds  at both which Places they have inexhaustible Stores These are carried quite down into the  Ouse  and then either go up that River to  York  or down to the  Humber  where the  Trent  and  Ouse  meet together and which in a few Miles falls into the Sea In this Passage abundance of large Towns are supplied with Coal with this Advantage too that whereas the  Newcastle  Coals pay four Shillings  per  Chaldron Duty to the Publick these being only  Riverborne Coal  are exempted and pay nothing So that the City of  York  which strenuously opposed the first Navigation of these  Rivers in this Particular as well as in many others daily experiences the Benefit of it  I need not add that by the same Navigation all heavy Goods imported to  Hull  are brought up these Rivers as well as Goods brought from  London  and other Parts of the Kingdom such as Butter Cheese Lead Iron Salt Sugars Tobacco Fruit Spice Hops Oil Wine Brandy Spirits and the like  The Antiquity of  Leeds  is very great being mentioned by Venerable  Bede  but it was not incorporated till  Car  I when Sir  John Savile  afterwards Lord  Savile  was made the first honorary Alderman in Memory of whom the Arms of the Town are adorned with his Supporters and those very suitable being the two  Athenian  Birds sacred to that Goddess who was deem'd the Patroness of Spinning and Weaving as well as Arts in general  At the West End of the Town formerly stood a Castle wherein King  Richard  II was imprisoned before he was carried to  Pontefract  And on the Scite thereof now stands the antient Manorhouse with the Park  c  lately belonging to Mr  Richard Sy  es  Here are two magnificent Halls both built about the Year one for White Cloths supported by Pillars and Arches which form a Quadrangle like the Royal Exchange with a handsome Cupola and Bell on the Top to give Notice when the Market for these Sort of Goods begins The other is the Guild or Moot Hall the Front of which is built likewise on Arches with rustick Coins and Tabling where in a Nich is placed a fine Statue of Queen  Anne  done by Mr  Carpenter  at the Expence of Alderman  Milner    Here are three Churches  St Peter's  the Parish Church is built in the Form of a Cross with a Tower rising from the Middle with eight Bells in it In the Ceiling is  the Giving of the Law  finely  painted in Fresco by  Parmentier  who voluntarily gave this Specimen of his Art in Gratitude for the Encouragement he had met with here  St John  's was built in at the sole Expence of Mr  Harrison  who likewise built the Almshouses adjoining a Freeschool a Marketcross and the Street called  Newstreet  the Rents of which he appropriated to pious Uses  I must not omit the New Chapel as it is called erected by the  Presbyterians  in which is said to have been the first as it certainly is the stateliest they have in the North of  England    From  Leeds  we advanced Northward and came to  Harwood  a pretty little Town on the River  Wherfe  over which is a very costly Bridge and there formerly was a strong Castle The Church here is remarkable for several things particularly for the Interrment of Sir  William Gascoigne  who had the Courage to commit Prince  Henry  afterwards K  Henry  V to the  King's Bench  for affronting him while he was in the Seat of Justice letting him know that though the Son might bear the Image of the King's  Person  the Judge bore that of his  Authority    We passed the  Wherfe  over a fine Stone Bridge of Arches The River runs in a Bed of Stone which makes it look as clear as Rock Water  The Plenty of Stone in the North is no doubt the Reason why there are so many noble Bridges in that Part of  England  insomuch that I don't remember to have seen one of Timber from the  Trent  to the  Tweed    We travelled along the  Wherfe  into the  Dale  that takes its Name from the River which reaches from  York  about Miles enlivened almost all the Way with Gentlemens Seats at a little Distance from each other and left  Ottley  on the Southside of the River a small Markettown no otherwise of Note than  for its Situation which is under a large craggy Cliff If  Yorkshire  owed us any Pleasure for the Fatigues of a former Day it was abundantly made up to us here for I cannot but think this one of the most delightful Parts of  England  and I have met with Travellers who have compared it to the Plain of  Palermo  itself Nor ought you to be surprised to hear some Parts of the North compared with  Italy  The Testimony of Bishop  Tonstal  is well known who in his Progress to  York  with King  Henry  VIII in the Year declared that the Country North of  Doncaster  and South of  Haslewood  was the richest he had found in his Travels thro'  Europe  It would be endless to mention all the Seats we passed but the Motto at least of Mr  Ibbotson  's at  Denton  will naturally engage the Speculation of every Traveller  QVOD NEC IOVIS IRA NEC IGNIS NEC POTERIT FERRVM  The House it seems belonged once to Lord  Fairfax  General of the Parliament Forces and was about to be demolished by Prince  Rupert  but was happily saved by the Sight of a Picture of one of the General's worthy Ancestors It was afterwards burnt down by Accident and rebuilt by the present Possessor and now after the Rage of War and Devastation of Fire in a Poetical Rant defies them both  Knaresborough  known among Foreigners by the Name of the  Yorkshire Spaw  stands near  Ripley  a Markettown upon the River  Nyd  In the Town and the Lands adjacent are no less than four different Mineral Waters One of the Springs is a petrifying Water which in a little Cave drops from the Roof of the Cavity and as they say turns Wood into Stone  The other two Springs are indeed the most valuable Rarities of the kind in  England    The first is the  Sweet Spaw  or a Vitriolick Water It was discovered by one Mr  Slingsby Anno  and all Physicians acknowlege it to be a very sovereign Medicine in several particular Distempers  See Dr  Leigh'  s Natural History of  Lancashire  The other is the  Stinking Spaw  or according to the Learned the  Sulphur Well  This Water is clear as Crystal but so fetid and nauseous to the Smell that many are obliged to hold their Noses when they drink it yet it is a valuable Medicine in Scorbutick Hypochondriack and especially in Hydropick Distempers  The People formerly for many Years only drank these Waters but they now make use of them as a Cold Bath and in this manner they must necessarily be very good for Rheumatick Pains Paralytick Numbnesses and many other Distempers  These Baths were heretofore well frequented insomuch that I have been told  l per Annum  Rent has been given for a Cold Bath But now  Scarborough  has the Vogue  At  Rippon  are two good Stone Bridges one of which has I think thirteen Arches or more over the  Eure  and is a very stately one There is another over the same River at  Burrowbrigg  four Miles lower than  Rippon  which has indeed but four or five Arches but then these Arches are near Feet wide and one of the middlemost much more and are high in proportion the Ends of the Bridge are likewise continued by high Causeways built of Stone to keep the Water in its Course which however sometimes overflows them  From these Bridges as well as that abovementioned at  Harwood  it may be observed that however low these Waters are in the Summer they are high and furious enough in the Winter and yet the  River  Aire  tho' its Source is in the same Ridge of Mountains as the other is gentle and mild in its Stream whereas the others are raging and furious The only Reasons I can give for it are that this River runs in a thousand Windings and Turnings more than any other in these Parts insomuch that as  Camden  expresses it near its Head in  Craven  it seems doubtful whether it should run forward to the Sea or return to its Spring and from  Skipton  to  Gargrave  it is observed to be passed over eight times within the Compass of three Miles The next Reason is that after it has descended from the Mountains it has a deeper Chanel  Rippon  the  Isurium  of the  Romans  is a very neat pleasant wellbuilt Town and an antient Corporation it has not only an agreeable Situation on a rising Ground between two Rivers but the Buildings are good likewise particularly the Marketplace which is accounted the finest and most beautiful Square of its kind in  England    In the middle of it stands a curious Obelisk built by Mr  Aislaby  whose Seat at  Studley  is about a Mile distant The Town is govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen  Here is a large Collegiate Church and tho' but a Deanry in the Diocese of  York  yet it is a very handsome antient and venerable Pile and shews itself a great way in the Country Mr  Camden  says  Rippon  owes its Greatness to Religion And that here was a famous Monastery built by  Wilfrid  Archbishop of  York  in the first Ages of Christianity in this Island is certain but this pious Gift of the Bishop was lost some Years after for the  Danes  overrunning  Yorkshire  rifled and burnt it to the Ground together with the whole Town of  Rippon  It afterwards flourished again as a Monastery but that with the rest being given up in the Reign of King  Henry  VIII the Church only was preserved  While it was a Monastery here was a famous Sanctuary a Thing much abused in foreign Countries This Privilege was it seems granted to the Church of  Rippon  by King  Athelstan  and whoever broke the Rights of Sanctuary which he extended a Mile around the Church were to forfeit Life and Estate so that in short not the Church only but the whole Town and a Circle of two Miles diameter was a Refuge for all that fled to it where they lived safe and out of the Reach of all Law  Annexed to this Monastery was an Hospital the Purposes of which are very remarkable and would be worthy Imitation in our Days of Protestant Charity The House was called the Hospital of St  Mary Magdalene  where according to the Foundation were to be maintained two Chaplains to perform Divine Service and if any begging Clergyman or other needy Person should happen to travel or stray out of his Way and call at the said Hospital he should be relieved there for one Night only with Food and a Bed and so be gone in the Morning and every poor Person that came craving an Alms on St  Mary Magdalene  's Day yearly should have one Loaf Value an Halfpeny when Corn was at the Price of five Shillings  per  Quarter and one Herring  'Tis also recorded that one Branch of this Hospital was given to a Society of religious Sisters to maintain a Chaplain to perform Divine Service and to keep all the  Lepers  born and bred in  Hipschire  but the Sisters being in time removed a Brotherhood was established in their stead which continued for a while and after that a Mastership At length all except the Church was demolished together and the House with the Monastery suppressed  The Church is an antient  Gothick  Building firm strong and plain no Imagery or Statues to be seen about it there are three Towers on which formerly were Spires  The whole Revenues were seized by King  Henry  VIII so that little or nothing remained for an officiating Clergyman But King  James  I having the Case represented to him by his Queen was pleased to found and endow in this Church one Dean and seven Prebendaries besides Petitcanons Singingmen and Choiristers of his own Royal Bounty and Benevolence under the Jurisdiction of the Archbishop of  York    But I must not leave  Rippon  without mentioning St  Wilfrid's Needle  a Place famous in antient Times being a narrow Hole in a close vaulted Room under Ground in which Womens Chastity was tried and if chaste they passed thro' but if otherwise the Whim was they could not Some  Saxon  Coins were found here in the Year  In the Churchyard of this Minster lies a plain Monument or Gravestone over the Remains of a generous Soul who gave Two thousand Pounds to pious Uses and yet has no other Epitaph than the following  Hic jacet  Zacharias Jepson  cujus Aetas fuit    per paucos annos tantum vixit  We spent a considerable Part of a Day in the celebrated Park or rather Garden belonging to Mr  Aislabie  which is visited by all the Curious and admired as a Wonder not only with regard to the various Beauties which Nature has so lavishly bestowed but those of Art and Cultivation wherewith it is so liberally adorned the latter exhibit a noble Specimen of that exquisite fine Taste for Architecture and Gardening in which the present worthy Owner is allowed to excel The Temples and Loggio's built in many delightful Recesses may vie with the best Models of the Antients and the wide extended Plantations are judiciously varied as the Objects of the Landschape become new In one Part the Hills  gradually ascend with Tufts of Shade interspers'd over the Verdure in another they precipitately rise with Rocks projecting from their rough Sides and tall Woods covering their Brows Above these a beautiful  Gothick  but unconsecrated Tower lifts up its Head and below the Skirts of the Cliffs are watered by a River which wanders in one Place with a silent Current and in another falls down in Cascades An easy Eminence commands a Prospect of the Town and Minster of  Rippon  with a large Extent of Country beyond and the stately Ruins of  FountainAbbey  are seen from another besides Gentlemens Seats in the Centre of many Views The fine Turf of the Park is constantly cleared of Weeds and equal Care is taken to preserve the best Trees from Decay Through the whole Scene of Variety the Improvements are adapted to follow the luxuriant Fancy of Nature and humour her different Propensities You see her deck'd out and inrich'd where Necessity or Propriety bespeak such Indulgence but in the Simplicity of her own Dress where Ornament would disfigure her beautiful Attire  The House is an old Building but a noble Plan is laid down for a new one and in a better Situation of the Park There are Stables built which are very grand  The late Bishop of  Namur  Abbot  Strickland  when he resided in  England  in the Year took a Journey from  London  to  Studley  with Intention to transplant some of the Beauties of this Place as near as might be in the Disposition of his Plantations adjoining to a magnificent Palace he was then about to build at his episcopal Residence  A Mile from  Rippon  or less is a stately beautiful Seat called  Newbie  built some Years since by Sir  Edward Blacket  The Park is extended to the Bank of the River  Eure  and is sometimes in part laid under Water by the River which coming down  from the Western Mountains thro' a marly loamy Soil fructifies the Earth they say as the River  Nile  does the  Egyptian  Fields about  Grand Cairo    As Sir  Edward  spared no Cost in the Building and Sir  Christopher Wren  laid out the Design as well as chose the Situation I shall only say tbat nothing can be added to the one or the other The Building is of Brick the Avenues to it are very fine and the Gardens not only well laid out but well planted and as well kept But for want of fine Gravel the Walks cannot shew themselves as they would do were they in the Southern Part of  England  The House has a fine Prospect over the Country almost to  York  with the River in View most of the Way and it has a very noble Appearance to the great North Road which lies at  Burrowbridge  within two Miles of it  As you begin to come into the  Northriding  for the  Eure  parts the  Westriding  from it you find yourself in a Place noted in the North of  England  for the best and largest Oxen and the finest galloping Horses bred either for the light Saddle for the Race or the Chace for Running or Hunting Sir  Edward  was a Grazier and took such Delight in Breeding and Feeding large Black Cattle that he had two or three times an Ox out of his Park led about the Country for a Sight and shewed as far as  Newcastle  and even to  Scotland  for the biggest Bullock in  England  and 'twas very seldom if ever he was overmatch'd  From the Town of  Rippon  the North Road and the  Roman  Way also which comes from  Castlefordbridge  parting at  Aberforth  leads away from the Town of  Bedal  in the  Northriding  and in a strait Line called  LeemingLane  leaving  Richmond  about two Miles on the West goes on to  Piersbridge  on the River  Tees  which are the utmost Limits of this vast County of  York    But as I proposed at my entering into this  Westriding  to go no further than  Rippon  which stands on the Northern Boundary of it I must stop here and likewise make it the Boundary as well of this Journey as of this Letter since I find it impracticable to take a Survey of this large populous and wealthy Division on one Journey without wandering to and fro up and down backward and forward on purpose which would be exceedingly fatiguing and uneasy and as I was resolved to make as perfect Observations as I possibly could of every thing that I could find remarkable in my way and especially of the Manufactures of the Country which I account as well worthy a Traveller's Notice as the Curiosities and Wonders of Nature and the most refin'd Operations of the Liberal Arts and Sciences I have therefore concluded upon another Journey into these Parts and to enter by the Way of  Lancashire  and to coast it along the West and Northwest Sides of the Country up to the River  Tees  and the Southern Side of the Bishoprick of  Durham  and from thence strike down South into the Centre of the County and so take a Trip East into the Heart of the  Northriding  to see the Towns that lie that Way and then return West into  York  and passing thence Southeast take in such Towns as stand on the Eastside of the  Westriding  till I arrive at the Fall of the  Trent  into the  Humber  and crossing that River view the Towns in the  Eastriding  and lastly follow the Seacoast all the Way up into  Durham  which will complete my Tour through the whole County  I am Sir Yours c  LETTER III CONTAINING A Description of Part of the  Westriding  of  Yorkshire  and of all the  North  and  Eastridings  the Bishoprick of  Durham  and the County of  Northumberland    SIR  _ACcording to what I proposed in my last I am now going to enter the  Westriding  of  Yorkshire  from the Eastside of  Lancashire  I must premise to you that all this Part of the County is so considerable for its Trade that the Postmaster General has thought fit to establish a Crosspost through all the Western Part of  England  into it to maintain the Correspondence of Merchants and Men of Business of which all this Side of the Island is full This is a Confirmation of what I have so often repeated of the Greatness of the Trade carried on in this Part of the Island This Crosspost begins at  Plymouth  in the Southwest Part of  England  and leaving the great  Western Postroad of  Excester  behind comes away North to  Taunton Bridgwater  and  Bristol  from thence goes on thro' all the great Cities and Towns up the  Severn  such as  Gloucester Worcester Bridgenorth  and  Shrewsbury  thence by  West Chester  to  Liverpool  and  Warrington  from whence it turns away East and passes to  Manchester Bury Rochdale Halifax Leeds  and  York  and ends at  Hull    By this Means the Merchants at  Hull  have immediate Advice of their Ships which go out of the Chanel and come in by their Letters from  Plymouth  as readily as the Merchants of  London  and without the double Charge of Postage The Shopkeepers and Manufacturers can correspond with their Dealers at  Manchester Liverpool  and  Bristol  nay even with  Ireland  directly without the tedious Interruption of sending their Letters about by  London    I followed this Postroad from  Liverpool  to  Bury  both manufacturing Towns in  Lancashire  and the last very considerable for a Sort of coarse Goods called  Halfthicks  and  Kersies  The Market for them is very great tho' the Town is situated so remote so out of the way and at the very Foot of the Mountains that it would otherwise be but little frequented  Rochdale  farther on in our Way to  Blackstone Edge  is a good Markettown and is of late very much improved in the Woollen Manufacture as are also the Villages in its Neighbourhood  Here for our great Encouragement tho' it was but about the Middle of  August  and in some Places the Harvest hardly got in we saw the Mountains covered with Snow and felt the Cold very acute and piercing but we found as in all those Northern Countries the People had a happy Way of mixing the Warm and the Cold together for the Store of good Ale which flows plentifully in the most mountainous Part of this Country seems abundantly to  make up for all the Inclemencies of the Season or Difficulties of Travelling adding also the Plenty of Coals for Firing of which all those Hills are full  We mounted the Hills fortified with a little of this Precaution early in the Morning and tho' the Snow which had fallen in the Night lay a little upon the Ground yet we thought it was not much and the Morning being calm and clear we had no Apprehension of an uneasy Passage neither did the People at  Rochdale  who kindly directed us the Way and even offered to guide us over the first Mountains apprehend any Difficulty for us so we complimented ourselves out of their Assistance which we afterwards very much wanted  For tho' the Sun shone when we came out of the Town of  Rochdale  yet when we began to mount the Hills about a Mile from it we found the Wind rise and the higher we went the more it increased upon us by which I soon perceived that it had blown before and perhaps all Night upon the Hills though it was calm below And so we were obliged in a most discouraging manner to travel thro' trackless Drifts of Snow and it continuing snowing too in our Faces over  Blackstone Edge  we knew not whether we were wrong or right till we perceived some Landmarks that the honest  Rochdale  Men had told us of which gave us great Comfort  But after we had passed this dismal  Edge  it was our constant Labour as soon as we were at the Top of a Hill to come down it again on the other Side and then another Hill arose I do not remember that there was one Bottom that had any considerable Breadth of plain Ground in it but always a Brook in the Valley running from those Gulls and Deeps between the Hills and it was observable that they always cross'd our Way in the Bottoms from the Righthand to the Left the Reason of which you shall see presently  From  Blackstone Edge  to  Halifax  is eight Miles and all the Way except from  Sorby  to  Halifax  is thus up Hill and down so that I suppose we mounted to the Clouds and descended to the Waterlevel about eight times in that little Part of the Journey  But now I must observe to you that after we had passed the second Hill and come down into the Valley again and so still the nearer we came to  Halifax  we found the Houses thicker and the Villages greater in every Bottom and not only so but the Sides of the Hills which were very steep every way were spread with Houses for the Land being divided into small Inclosures from two Acres to six or seven each seldom more every three or four Pieces of Land had a House belonging to them  In short after we had mounted the third Hill we found the Country one continued Village tho' every way mountainous hardly a House standing out of a Speakingdistance from another and as the Day cleared up we could see at every House a Tenter and on almost every Tenter a Piece of Cloth Kersie or Shalloon which are the three Articles of this Country's Labour  In the Course of our Road among the Houses we found at every one of them a little Rill or Gutter of running Water if the House was above the Road it came from it and crossed the Way to run to another if the House was below us it crossed  from some other distant House above it and at every considerable House was a Manufactory which not being able to be carried on without Water these little Streams were so parted and guided by Gutters or Pipes that not one of the Houses wanted its necessary Appendage of a Rivulet  Again as the Dyinghouses Scouringshops and Places where they use this Water emit it ting'd with the Drugs of the Dyingvat and with the Oil the  Soap the Tallow and other Ingredients used by the Clothiers in Dressing and Scouring  c  the Lands thro' which it passes which otherwise would be exceeding barren are enrich'd by it to a Degree beyond Imagination  Then as every Clothier must necessarily keep one Horse at least to fetch home his Wooll and his Provisions from the Market to carry his Yarn to the Spinners his Manufacture to the Fullingmill and when finished to the Market to be sold and the like so every one generally keeps a Cow or two for his Family By this means the small Pieces of inclosed Land about each House are occupied and by being thus fed are still farther improved from the Dung of the Cattle As for Corn they scarce sow enough to feed their Cocks and Hens  Such it seems has been the Bounty of Nature to this Country that two Things essential to Life and more particularly to the Business followed here are found in it and in such a Situation as is not to be met with in any Part of  England  if in the World beside I mean Coals and running Water on the Tops of the highest Hills I doubt not but there are both Springs and Coals lower in these Hills but were they to fetch them thence 'tis probable the Pits would be too full of Water 'tis easy however to fetch them from the upper Pits the Horses going light up and coming down loaden This Place then seems to have been designed by Providence for the very Purposes to which it is now allotted for carrying on a Manufacture which can nowhere be so easily supplied with the Conveniencies necessary for it Nor is the Industry of the People wanting to second these Advantages Tho' we met few People without Doors yet within we saw the Houses full of lusty Fellows some at the Dyevat some at the Loom others dressing the Cloths the  Women and Children carding or spinning all imployed from the youngest to the oldest scarce any thing above four Years old but its Hands were sufficient for its own Support Not a Beggar to be seen not an idle Person except here and there in an Almshouse built for those that are antient and past working The People in general live long they enjoy a good Air and under such Circumstances hard Labour is naturally attended with the Blessing of Health if not Riches  From this Account you'll easily imagine that some of these remote Parts of the North are the most populous Places of  Great Britain London  and its Neighbourhood excepted  We have all this while been in the Parish of  Halifax  and before I come to the Town I must add a Word or two of the River  Calder  to complete the Description of the Country I passed through As I said before that all the Rills of Water which we crossed one at least in every Bottom went away to the Left or North Side of us as we went Eastward I am to add that following those little Brooks with our Eye we could observe that at some Distance to the Left there appeared a larger Valley than the rest into which not only all the Brooks which we passed emptied themselves but abundance more from the hollow deep Bottoms among the Hills on the Northside beyond it which emptied this way South as those on our Side run that way North And at the next Village called  Sorby  or  Sowerby  we passed a considerable River form'd from those Brooks and the melted Snows over a stately Stone Bridge of several great Arches And this was the main River  Calder  which I mentioned at  Wakefield  where it begins to be navigable and which without any Spring may be called the Head of it  The same Observation will hold on most of the great Rivers in the North there being hardly any  that have their Beginning in any publick Springs or Lakes as the Rivers in the South of  England  generally have which is the Case particularly of the  Derwent  and the  Don  from the  High Peak  and the Hills of the same Range more South of the  Edge  of the  Aire  the  Wherfe  the  Swale  the  Eure  the  Nyd  the  Tees  and the  Were  all in the same County of  York  and the  Tyne  the  Cockett  the  Till  and the  Tweed  farther North and even the  Forth  the  Tay  the  Clyde  the  Nyd  in  Scotland  and the  Mersee  the  Ribble  the  Rocke  and the  Lune  the West  Calder  the  Lowther  and the  Eden  on the other Side of these Mountains in  Lancashire Westmorland  and  Cumberland    Having thus accounted for them all at once I shall only mention them now as they come in my way for you will observe I crossed one or other of them at every considerable Town all the Rivers as well in  England  as in  Scotland  North of this Place running from the middle of the Country where these Mountains rise either East into the  German  or West into the  Irish  Sea None of them run like the  Severn  or the  Wye  or the Rivers in South  Wales  or the  Exe  in  Devon  or the  Avon  in  Wilts  or the  Arun  in  Sussex  and others North and South But I return to my Journey  Having passed the  Calder  at  Sorby Bridge  I now came to the Town of  Halifax  the most populous Parish or Vicarage in  England  for it is but one though Miles in Diameter but it has or Chapels of Ease besides about Meetinghouses which they call also Chapels being conformable in Fashion to them having Bells and Buryingground to most of them not reckoning those of the  Quakers  into the Number  In the Year there were but Houses in it but in the next Century it was much increased for History tells us that Queen  Elizabeth  being  petition'd by the Inhabitants of  Halifax  to grant them some Privileges they set forth as an Instance of their Loyalty that no less than young Men went out armed from this one Parish and at her Majesty's Call joined her Troops to fight the Popish Army then in Rebellion under the Earl of  Westmorland    If they then were so populous what must they be now their Trade is so vastly inlarged by the great Demand of Kerseys for cloathing the Armies abroad Some maintain that it is increased a fourth at least within these Years from their having entred upon a Manufacture of Shalloons which were never made in these Parts before at least not in any Quantities and 'tis computed that Pieces are work'd up in this Parish only and yet they do not make much fewer Kerseys than they did before for I was assured that there was one Dealer in the Vicarage who traded by Commission for  l  a Year in Kerseys only to  Holland  and  Hamburgh  And of late Years it is still more increased by the People of a neighbouring Part driving away about  Irish  Manufacturers who with about others accompanying them settled there As the Vicarage is thus far extended and so populous what must the Market be which supplies this vast Number of Inhabitants And yet these are all brought from other Parts of the Country For as to Corn they sow little and they feed very few Oxen or Sheep and as they are surrounded with large manufacturing Towns on every Side all of them imployed like themselves in the Clothing Trade they must necessarily have their Provisions from other more distant Parts  The Consequence then is plain their Corn comes up in great Quantities out of  Lincoln  and  Nottinghamshire  and the  Eastriding  the Black Cattle from thence and from  Lancashire  Sheep and  Mutton from the adjacent Counties every way Butter from the  East  and  Northridings  and Cheese out of  Cheshire  and  Warwickshire    The Markets in the Months of  September  and  October  are prodigiously thronged that being the Time when the Clothiers buy up as many Oxen as will serve their Family for the whole Year which they used to drive Home kill salt and hang up in the Smoke to dry This was heretofore their common Diet but now they live more upon fresh Meats  Thus one trading manufacturing Part of the Country in a barren Soil gives and receives Support from all the Countries round it  There is nothing extraordinary in the Town itself but the Multitude of People who resort to it on a Marketday as well to sell their Manufactures as to buy Provisions is prodigious in this respect no Places equal it in all the North Part of  England  except  Leeds  and  Wakefield    The Church is old but stately and venerable and has in it many extraordinary Monuments but most of them of great Antiquity Here is a very good Hospital and a Workhouse of an antient Establishment and there are several Charities of like Sort in different Parts of the Parish  Halifax  gave Birth to  John  of  Halifax  or  de Sacro Bosco  the chief Mathematician of his Age who was buried at the publick Expence of the University of  Paris  and to the late Archbishop  Tillotson  the Model of true rational Preaching tho' a new Sect lately sprung up called  Methodists  with great Pretences to  Meekness  and intolerable  Conceit  and  Vanity  at present seek publickly to depreciate the Memory and Works of that truly great Man  The Course of Justice antiently made use of here to prevent the stealing of Cloth is very remarkable Modern Authors pretend to say it was for all Sorts  of Felons but I am well assured it was first erected purely or at least principally for such Thieves as were detected in stealing Cloth from the Tenters and it seems very reasonable to think it was so because of the Conditions of the Trial The following is a brief Account of it  The Woollen Manufacture was erected here about the Year when King  Henry  VII caused an Act to pass prohibiting the Exportation of unwrought Wooll and to encourage foreign Manufacturers to settle in  England  several of whom coming over established different Manufactures of Cloths in different Parts of the Kingdom as that of Bays at  Colchester  Says at  Sudbury  Broadcloth in  Wilts  and other Counties and the Trade of Kerseys and narrow Cloth at this Place and other adjacent Towns And as at the Time when this Trade began nothing was more frequent than for young Workmen to leave their Cloths out all Night upon Tenters which gave an Opportunity for the idle Fellows to steal them a severe Law was made against stealing Cloth which gave the Power of Life and Death into the Hands of the Magistrates of  Halifax  But this Law was extended to no other Crime and the Conditions of it as I have said intimate as much for the Power was not given to the Magistrates to give Sentence unless in one of these three plain Cases    Hand Napping  that is when the Criminal was taken in the very Fact    Back Bearing  that is when the Cloth was found upon him    Tongue Confessing  which needs no Explanation  The Fact likewise was to be committed within the Liberties or Precincts of the Forest of  Hardwick  and the Value of the Goods stolen was to be above thirteen Pence Halfpeny  When the Criminal was taken he was brought before the Magistrates of the Town and they judged  sentenced and executed the Offender or cleared him within so many Days I think it was three Market Days If the Offence was committed out of the Vicarage but within the Bounds of the Forest then there were  Frith Bourgers  also to judge of the Fact who were to be summoned out of the  Forest Holders  as they are called who were to hold of that Frith that is of the Forest If they acquitted him of the Fact he was immediately discharged if they condemned him nobody could reprieve him but the Town The Country People were it seems so terrified at the Severity of this Proceeding that hence came that Proverbial Litany which was used all over  Yorkshire  From  Hell Hull  and  Halifax  Good Lord deliver us  Hull  was included in this Petition on account of their rigid Discipline to Beggars for they whipt out the foreign Poor and set their own to work  The Manner of Execution was very remarkable by an Ax drawn up by a Pulley and fastened with a Pin to the Side of a Wooden Engine which when pulled out the Axe fell swiftly down and did its Office  The Engine is now gone but the Basis on which it stood still remains being a square Foundation of Stone to which you go up by Steps The Engine was removed as we were told in the Year during the Reign of K  James  I  In the Reign of the same Prince the Earl of  Morton  Regent of  Scotland  passing thro'  Halifax  and seeing one of these Executions caused a Model to be taken and carried into his own Country where it is made use of at this Day But his Lordship's own Head was the first that was cut off with it and it being many Years before that happened the  Engine got the Name of the  Maiden  before it was handselled by the Execution of the Earl and this it retains tho' it has cut off many a Head since  The Ways to  Halifax  used to be exceedingly bad and except at the West Entrance almost inaccessible but of late Years they have been much mended and several Acts of Parliament have passed very lately which will greatly increase the Conveniences of the People thereabouts as well as improve its Commerce and Communication all around it to  Lancaster  as well as to  Leeds Doncaster  and all the great trading Towns even to the City of  York  itself  Due East from  Halifax  is  Kirkley  a small Village situated on the  Calder  near which is the Monument of the famous  Robin Hood  and upon the Moor his  Butts  Two little Hills so called about a Quarter of a Mile asunder I have now traced this Hero from the Forest of  Shirwood  the Scene of his Exploits to his Grave I before doubted whether there ever was such an one but Epitaphs as great Liars as they are I suppose are Evidence that such a Man once existed His is as follows  Here undernead dislaid Stean  Lais  Robert  Earl of  Huntingtun  Nea areir ver az hie sa geud  An Pipl kauld im  Robin Heud  Lick Utlawz hi an is Men  Vil  England  niver see agen  Near this Place is a little Town called  Burstall  where they make Broad Cloth so called in Distinction from Kerseys and Druggets and the like tho' the Cloths in this Country are called Narrow when they are spoken of in  London  and compared with the Broad Cloths made in  Wilts Gloucester Somerset  and  Devonshire    This Town is famed for Dying and there are made here a sort of Cloth in Imitation of  Gloucester Whites    which tho' they may not be so fine yet their Colours are as good  From hence to  Leeds  and every way round the Country appears exceedingly busy and diligent The Houses are not scatter'd and dispersed as in the Parish of  Halifax  but crouded up in large Villages and thronged with People  A few Miles Southwest of  Halifax  is  Huthersfield  upon the  Calder  which is the first noted Town it comes to This Town is one of the Five where that vast Clothingtrade which I have already mentioned is carried on They have a Market here for Kerseys every  Tuesday    While I am speaking of their Manufactures I must not forget that very essential one called  Yorkshire Ale  which indeed is in its Perfection in all this Part of the County But I cannot pass over  Huthersfield  without taking notice of its old Neighbour  Almondbury  a famous Town in the Time of the  Romans  and called  Campodunum  but 'tis now a Village only Mr  Camden  calls it a Royal Town and says it had a Cathedral Church in it dedicated to St  Alban  from whom it was called  Albanbury  whence its present Name The Ruins of a Stone Castle and Rampire are still to be seen near it  The River  Calder  having been made navigable to  Wakefield  and great Benefit arising from it it is now  Ann  about to be made further navigable to the Towns of  Ealand  and  Halifax  which will be of inexpressible Service to those populous and improving Places and all the Villages and Towns adjacent And as there have just passed new Acts to mend the Road from  Selby  to  Leeds Bradford  and  Halifax  and from  Ealand  to  Leeds  which have been torn in Pieces by the heavy Carriages passing to and fro in the carrying on the vast extended Trade of those Parts 'tis hardly to be conceived what Benefit will accrue from these publick Works  The first Town we came to from  Halifax  was  Bradford  It has a Market but is of no other Note than having given Birth to Dr  Sharp  the good Archbishop of  York    We soon enter'd  Craven  which is a very hilly and craggy Country as the Name signifies for  Craven  comes from the  British  Word  Craig  a Rock But however unpleasant  We proceeded farther Northwest and arrived at  Skipton  a good wellbuilt Town encompassed with Hills on every Side The Market is well frequented and supplied Here is a large handsome Church and a good Grammar School to which one Mr  Petyt  who had been principal of  Bernard  's  Inn London  gave a considerable Parcel of Books and likewise erected a good Library in the Church We were agreeably surprised to find so handsome a Town and such good Accommodations in so mountainous a Country  This is a healthy Country however and the Inhabitants live to a great Age a Father and Son giving Evidence at the Assizes at  York  it appeared the first was and the Son Years old  Here the Road turns almost due West which brought us to a Town called  Settle  a much better Town than we expected in such a Country It lies on the Road to  Lancaster  at the Foot of the Mountains which part that County from  Yorkshire  upon the River  Ribble    And a little lower upon the same River upon the Borders of  Lancashire  stands  Gisborne  but has nothing remarkable in it  Looking forwards to the Northwest of us we saw nothing but high Mountains which had a terrible Aspect and more frightful than any in  Monmouthshire  or  Derbyshire  especially  Pingent Hill  which  Camden  derives from the  British  Word  Pengwin  i e  Whitehead  from the Snow lying upon it so  that having no manner of Inclination to encounter them merely for the sake of seeing only a few Villages and a Parcel of wild People we turned short Northeast and came to the great Road leading Northward to  Richmond  at a Village called  Brumstal  noted for the Birth of Sir  William Craven  an Alderman of  London  who was a great Founder and Builder of Churches Bridges Causways and other publick Edifices in this Country  Having passed thro' some other inconsiderable Villages we enter'd  Midlam  a little Markettown on the River  Youre  and the Northriding of  Yorkshire  together and so leaving  Masham  another inconsiderable Markettown which lay upon the same River to the Southeast of us we passed along to  Bedal  which is likewise of no great Note saving that the Living is worth  l  a Year and that we met here again the  Roman  Causway which leads up through  Richmond  to  Barnards Castle  in the Bishoprick of  Durham  and is called  Leeminglane  for Miles together We put ourselves upon this Way and were not long before we arrived at  Richmond    Tho' I met with nothing else within the Town of  Bedal  worth observing yet the Country round it as indeed the whole County is more or less full of Jockies and Dealers in Horses and the Breed in this and the next County is so well known that tho' the Pedigree of them is not preserved for a Succession of Ages as 'tis said they do in  Arabia  yet are their Stallions denominated by certain Names that never fail to advance the Price of a Horse according to the Reputation of the Sire he comes of  And indeed let Foreigners boast what they will of  Barbs  and  Turkish  Horses or of the  Spanish  Jennets from  Cordoua  for which  l  apiece have been given I believe that some of the Gallopers of this County and of the Bishoprick of  Durham  which joins to it will outdo for Speed and Strength the swiftest Horse  that was ever bred in  Turkey  or  Barbary  take both Advantages together For tho' the  Barb  may beat  Yorkshire  for a Mile Course  Yorkshire  shall distance him at the End of the Four Miles the  Barb  shall carry the Day with Seven and a half but  Yorkshire  with and Stone In a word  Yorkshire  shall carry the Man and the  Barb  a Feather But they are universally allowed to be the best Hunting and Road Horses in the World and are bought up by Foreigners on that Account  As this Part of the Country is so much imployed in Horses the young Fellows are bred up in the Stable and make excellent Grooms  Besides their Fame for Horses they have the Reputation also of being good Grafiers over this whole Country and produce a large noble Breed of Oxen as may be seen at  North Allerton  Fairs where incredible Numbers of them are bought Eight times every Year and brought Southward as far as the Fens in  Lincolnshire  and the  Isle of Ely  where they are fed up to the Grossness of Fat we see in  London  Markets The Market these North Country Cattle are generally brought to is at  St Ives  a Town between  Huntingdon  and  Cambridge  upon the River  Ouse    Richmond  is so called from its Situation upon a Hill or Mount fruitful tho' the Country about it is rocky and barren and it gives the Name of  Richmondshire  to the District it is in as another East of this is called  Allertonshire  the former is in the Diocese of  Chester  and the latter in that of  Durham    This Town in the Time of  Richard  II was annexed to the Duchy of  Lancaster  and so still continues Earl  Edwin  built a Castle here the Tower o  which is still standing as is also the Steeple of the old Priory It is a Borough governed by a Mayor  c  and holds Pleas in all kinds of Action has a good Marketplace and Three Gates which lead to  Three different Suburbs It is well built all of Stone and some Houses of Freestone  We were told That in the Year Mr  Wharton  of  Newcastle  Agent to his Grace the Duke of  Richmond  by ordering several Places here to be dug very deep discovered the Drawbridge and Moat belonging to  Richmond  Castle which were of very curious Workmanship  Here thrives a kind of Manufactory of knit Yarn Stockens for Servants and ordinary People Every Family is imployed that way both great and small and here you may buy the smallest sized Stockens for Children for  s    d  the Dozen Pair sometimes less  This Trade extends itself also into  Westmorland  or rather from  Westmorland  hither for at  Kendal KirkbyStephen  and such other Places in this County as border upon  Yorkshire  the chief Manufacture of Yarn Stockens is carried on which is indeed a very considerable one and of late greatly increased  We made some Excursions from this Town into the Country round it and followed the River  Swal  West which runs under the Wall of the Castle of  Richmond  and by reason of Rocks which intercept its Passage forms here a natural Cataract This River tho' not extraordinary large is noted for giving Name to the Lands which it runs through for some Length called  Swale Dale  and to an antient Family of that Name the last of whom was Sir  Solomon Swale  Bart who wrote himself of  Swale Hall  in  Swale Dale  by the River  Swale  This Gentleman became unfortunate and was supplanted by a Person not long since dead who was a Clerk in the Exchequer Office and observing this Family held their Estate of the Crown and that they had omitted to renew for many Years procured a Grant from the Crown of this Estate for himself A great many Lawsuits ensued but to no other Effect  than to increase the Misfortunes of this Gentleman who died a Prisoner in the Fleet but I think not till his Adversary had first made away with himself  Swale Dale  is a low pleasant and rich Valley abounding with Grass but very bare of Wood tho' here is a Place just by called  Swale Dale Forest  it might have been so antiently but there are hardly Trees enough in it now to denominate it a Forest  Not  ar from this Forest lies  Wensdale  a very rich and fruitful Valley well covered with delicate green Grass and stocked with vast Herds of Cattle and in some Places produces Lead Ore The  Eure  runs thro' the Midst of it and rises in th  Western Mountains very near the S  rce of the  Swale  which as it were leaps into it from a Precipice at  Myton  Both these Rivers are plentifully stocked with Fish and  Eure  has Cra  sh in it  But let me stop in this  ce to take Notice of one of the greatest Ra  es that  England  ever produced I mean  Henry Jenkins  whose remarkable great Age deserves our particular Notice He was born in the Year and died in being then Years of Age There are no Registers of so long a Date and therefore his Age must be guessed at by other Circumstances either from his own Account or the probable Evidences of others Which are these  First  Being demanded by a Gentlewoman who was curious to know as exactly as possible how old he was What Kings he remembred he answered after a little Pause  "That he thought himself about or Years old and that he could remember  Plowden  meaning  Floddon    Field  fought against the  Scots  in King  Henry  VIII's Reign"  She then ask'd him  "Was the King himself there"  He replied  "No he was in  France  and the Earl of  Surrey  was General"  She asked him then  "How old he was then"  He said  "About Years old"  That Battle was fought  September  King  Henry  being then at  Tournay    Secondly  There were Four or Five of the same Parish at that time of an Years old or very near it who all declared That they never knew him any other than an elderly Man and that he told them he was Butler to the Lord  Coniers  The last of that Name died without Issue      Philip  and  Mary  I  An Dom  And he remembred the Abbot of  Fountains  before the Dissolution in King  Henry  VIII's Time  Thirdly  He went often to the Assizes on Foot and was used as a Witness in other Courts whose Records speak largely of his Age In the  Chancery  he was sworn to the Remembrance of above Years and as much often at  York  Assizes In the King's  Remembrancer's Office  in the  Exchequer  a Record saith  "That  Henry Jenkins  Labourer aged Years deposed as a Witness in and to confirm his Age divers antient Men who were Witnesses swore that he was a very old Man when they first knew him"  He was for the last Century of his Life a Fisherman and used to wade and swim in the Rivers even after he was an hundred Years old and lived upon very coarse Diet In some of his last Years being unable to work at his Trade he went a begging to Gentlemens Houses who used to relieve him chearfully as a great Curiosity And his great Age was the more to be credited because he could neither write nor read and so what he reported was from Strength of Memory Two Years before his Death he was able to bind Sheaves after the Reapers and had his Sight and Hearing to the last  The next Excursion we made was up to the Banks of the  Tees  thro'  Gilling Eggleston  and  Bowes  now ordinary Towns or rather Villages tho' the  first had formerly a great Castle which in the  Conqueror  's Time and long afterwards was the Seat of the Lords of that Country whereas  Richmond  which has since rose out of the Ruins of  Gilling  was but a Fort and in Subordination to it  Eggleston  is famous for Marble which they dig out of the Rocks there and imploys a great many Hands  Bowes  stands upon the Military  Roman  Way and has been therefore undoubtedly a Place of great Note  In this Part of  Richmondshire  and up Northward are no less than Three Forests viz  Applegarth  Forest  New  Forest and  Lune  Forest and all these within a Tract of Ground of no great Extent Not far off is besides the Forest of  Swale Dale  beforementioned  The  Tees  is famous for Salmon and is a rapid River and sometimes swells up so suddenly that a Man in passing the Ford in the Road to  Darlington  on Foot whilst the Water was low and hardly up to his Knees was overtaken as he was going over by a sudden Swell of the Stream and carried off and drown'd The People this way talk much of an antient City they had formerly hereabout The Antiquaries agree there was one called by the  Romans Cataractonium  but differ as to its Situation but I think Mr  Salmon  has placed it most probably upon the Confluences of the  Tees  and  Greta  at a Place called  Merton  where indeed the Remains of it are very visible and also about  Gretabridge  which is just by it  We crossed the River and entered  Bernard'scastle  which lies on the North Side of it and consequently within the Bishoprick of  Durham  It was built by the Grandfather of  Baliol  King of  Scotland  and is an antient wellbuilt Town but not large Here they have an excellent Art of dressing  their Hides into Leather out of which they make the best Bridles Reins and Belts as at  Rippon  they were wont to furnish you with the best Spurs and Stirrups  The Manufacture for Stockens continues thus far and flourishes here and at  Marwood  and other little Villages on the Borders of  Durham  but the Jockeytrade extends much farther  Between this Part of the Bishoprick where this Town stands on the East and  Lancaster  on the West a mountainous Tract of  Yorkshire  runs like a Promontory up Northward a great way Hill upon upon Hill Cliffs Rocks and terrible Precipices most astonishing to behold This rugged Part of the Country is called  Stanmore Hills  which are desolate and solitary excepting one Inn for the Entertainment of such as may be hardy enough to go among them As for us we did not think it worth our while But here are it seems abundance of the Frolicks of Nature in Stone which exactly resemble Serpents and other various Forms  The West Side of the Bishoprick being very mountainous too and corresponding with that of  Stanmore  we turned Northeast to visit a little Markettown but a little way off called  Stainthorp  but being of no other Note than having a stately Tomb in the Church to the Memory of one of the  Nevils  and his two Wives we passed on to  Raby  Castle which stands just by it the antient Seat of that Family but now of the Lord  Vane  But it has nothing remarkable in it  We came next to  Piersbridge  to which the  Roman  Causway leads or as they call it  Leeminglane  Here have been many remarkable Remains of Antiquity dug up and particularly an old Altarpiece We thought to have returned by this Bridge into  Yorkshire  but were desirous to take in  Darlington  first and pass over the  Tees  there  Darlington  is remarkable for its dirty Situation for a beautiful Church with a high Spire rising up from the Midst of it and for a good long Stone Bridge over very little or no Water It is a large considerable Markettown of great Resort and well supplied The Marketplace is large and convenient It is noted for the Linen Manufacture as the Water of the  Skern  on which it is situated is exceeding good for Bleeching insomuch that Linen has been sent hither from  Scotland  to bleech but it particularly excels in Huggabags of Ten Quarters wide which are made nowhere else in  England  and of which as well as other Linencloth it sends up large Quantities to  London    A greater Rarity I may mention in this Town was our Landlord at the  Fleece  Inn by Name  Henry Lovell  who died in  May  in the d Year of his Age and had kept this Inn ever since He was never known to have one Hour's Sickness nor even the Headach tho' a free Toper of Ale sometimes for Days and Nights successively but had an Aversion to Drams of all kinds retained his Hearing Sight and Memory to his last Moments He never made use of Spectacles nor ever lost a Tooth He was esteemed in his Life and lamented at his Death being of a humane Temper and had the Deportment of a Gentleman  At  Oxehall  near this Town we saw the famous  Hell Kettles  which are Three deep Pits full of Water which have occasioned many fabulous Stories among the Countrypeople and divers Conjectures among the Learned but they seem to be nothing else but old Coal pits and yet there is no Coal near them now filled by the Water of the  Tees  thro' some subterraneous Passage as 'tis said Bishop  Tunstal  experienced by marking a Goose and putting her into one of the Pits which he found next Day in the  Tees  Others say they were occasioned by an  Earthquake which is recorded in the Chronicle of  Tinmouth  for the Year when the Earthquake happened  We passed on East and came to  Yarum  Bridge where we recrossed the  Tees  It is a very good and wellbuilt Bridge The Town is incorporated and but small lying near the Influx of the little River  Levan  into the  Tees  It has seen much better Days but however of late Years it is a little recovered and carries a pretty Trade by Water for Lead Corn and Butter with  London    Stokesby  is also but a small Markettown and stands near the Source of the same River a few Miles East of  Yarum  inland which lies in a little Tract of rich and fruitful Ground called  Allertonshire  and water'd by the River  Wysk  It is a corporate Town consisting of one Street about half a Mile long wellbuilt with a very good Market and is noted for having the greatest Beastfair in  England    Here was a bloody Battle fought in King  Stephen  's Time between  David  King of  Scotland  and Archbishop  Tunstall  who was Lieutenant in these Parts for King  Stephen  which was called  the Battle of the Standard  which it seems never used to be erected but when the Kingdom was in imminent danger The Bishop prevailed and routed the  Scots  tho'  Henry  King  David  's Son kept the Field of Battle with a Band of hardy Soldiers after the Bulk of the Army was fled with their King after them and fought valiantly till he was overpower'd and oblig'd to follow his Father  From hence we advanced still South and passed thro'  Thirsk  a corporate Town which has but an ordinary Market to  Aldborough  and  Boroughbrigg  which lie within Three Miles of  Rippon  upon the River  Eure    These are Two Borough Towns each sending Two Members to Parliament which is a Circumstance  peculiar to this Place and to  Weymouth  and  Melcomb  in  Dorsetshire    Boroughbrigg  or  Bridge  seems to be the modern Town risen up out of  Aldborough  the very Names importing as much the one being  Borough at the Bridge  and the other  Old Borough  that was before it All the Antiquaries are agreed in this who place on the Side of  Aldborough  or  Old Borough  an antient City and  Roman  Colony called  Isurium Brigantium  At present there are not so much as the Ruins of a City to be seen above Ground But the Coins Urns Vaults Pavements and the like frequently dug up there give Evidence to the Thing and some of them are so very remarkable that I cannot chuse to refer you to Mr  Camden  and his Continuator for farther Satisfaction only adding to what they have observed that a curious Piece of Antiquity was discover'd a few Years ago which is a Mosaick Pavement of singular Form and Beauty brought to light on digging the Foundation of a House and which is now about Two Feet from the Level of the Street  At the Door of the College is another tesselated Pavement of a different Form from the other and tho' not above Three Yards from it it is a Foot nearer the Surface of the Street The former is composed of white and black Squares with a Border of red but the Stones of this are lesser Squares and are white yellow red and blue  Not long since more Pavements of this kind were discover'd on an Eminence called  Boroughhill  as also the Foundations of a considerable Building two Bases of Pillars of some regular Order large Stones of the grit Kind with Joints for Cramping sacrificing Vessels Flews for Conveyance of Smoke or warm Air Bones and Horns of Beasts mostly Stags an Ivory Needle and a Copper  Roman Stylus  from all which it may reasonably be supposed  that a Temple formerly stood in this Place I had not so much Curiosity as to go to see the Three great pyramidal Stones in the Fields on the Lefthand as you go thro'  Boroughbridge  which the Country People being unable to comprehend how they came there will have to be brought by the Devil and so call them  The Devil's Arrows  Mr  Camden  describes them as also does Mr  Drake  in his  History of the Antiquities of  York to whom therefore I refer  Boroughbridge  the latest built of the two Towns I have mentioned is undoubtedly very old for here in the Barons Wars was a Battle and on this Bridge the great  Humphrey de Bohun  Earl of  Hereford  was killed by a Soldier who lay concealed under the Bridge and wounded him by thrusting a Spear or Pike thro' a Chink into his Body as he was passing over it From whence we may conclude with Mr  Camden  that it was a Timber Bridge then and not built of Stone as it is now  At  Boroughbrigg  the Battle was fought between King  Edward  II and his Barons who were defeated and after ensued the bloody Execution at  Pontefract  of the Earl of  Lancaster  and others of the Barons as I mentioned when I spoke of  Pontefract    These Two Borough Towns lying near the Centre of this vast County and on the Skirts of the North and West Ridings and there being a great many Towns about the Middle of the first that we could not more conveniently visit than from hence we therefore struck away East and Northeast through the Towns of  Hovingham Rydell Hemesley  and  Kirkby Moore Side  which is so called because it lies on the Side of  Blackamoore  But they were far from answering our Trouble of going so far out of the Way excepting that  Hemesley  seemed to be tolerably wellbuilt with Stone and the Houses covered with Slate the Two first having hardly a Market But the Situation of  Rydell  is pleasant  being in a fine fruitful Vale wherein are Parishchurches  We then turned Southeast and came to  Pickering  a pretty large wellbuilt Town which has a wellfurnished Market and belongs to the Duchy of  Lancaster  having Jurisdiction over several neighbouring Villages and is called  The Honour of Pickering  It has formerly been a fortified Place as appears by the Ruins of a Castle which lie upon a Hill  It is situate on the West Side of a wild hilly Country and a Forest which is within the Liberty of the Town and called  Pickering Forest  which we did not care to traverse over and so passed Southwest down to  Malton  on the  Derwent    This Town is divided into Two Parts by the River which are called  Old  and  New Malton  The  Old  is the  Camalodunum  of the  Romans  and was burnt by  Thurstan  Archbishop of  York  in King  Stephen  's Cause against  Eustace  the Lord of it who had betray'd Part of this Country into the Hands of the  Scots  but  Eustace  being afterwards received into Favour rebuilt it and it has been ever since called  New Malton  Here has been a famous Abbey and the Church of it is still standing but very ruinous tho' the Castle is quite demolished  This Town is wellbuilt and inhabited and has Two wellsupplied weekly Markets which are held by Prescription for it is not incorporated It is the best Market in the County for Horses Cattle and Provisions and is noted for Utensils in Husbandry It has likewise Three handsome Parish Churches and a good Stone Bridge over the  Derwent  Near this Town is a Well whose Water is said to have the same Virtue as that of  Scarborough    We set out from hence and for some Miles coasted along the Banks of  Derwent  towards  York  taking  Hinderskell  in our Way where the late Earl of  Carlisle  built the magnificent Seat of  Castle Howard  upon the Spot of Ground where the old Castle stood in the middle of a Wood but his Lordship died before it was finish'd I shall mention this again byandby  But I must not omit that on the Southside of the  Derwent  we saw  Auldby  a little Village where 'tis said stood in the  Roman  Times a City called  Derventis  where a Company named  Derventienses  was station'd  The  Derwent  is a River very full of Water and overflows its Banks and all the neighbouring Meadows always after Rain It is likewise wellstock'd with Fish and runs between the East and North Ridings  We are now entering the great City of  York  the  Eboracum  of the  Romans  and of such Account in their Time that no less than Three Military Ways pass'd thro' it and it was not only a  Roman  Colony but the Seat of some of the Emperors and principal Generals particularly of  Severus  and  Constantius Chlorus  the Father of  Constantine the Great    In our Approach to it we discovered many visible Marks of Antiquity not reducible to Description and tho' Time and Misfortunes have so deeply effaced all Traces of its once glorious Splendor yet some noble Remains of Majesty are still to be seen there especially as we viewed it from a rising Hill at some small Distance on the  London  Road nay after we were within the Walls and had Leisure to look about we found ourselves not disappointed in the Idea we had before conceived of it and every Traveller who is inquisitive in the Search of Antiquities or Curiosities will be tempted to make some Stay at  York  there being a very great Variety of each to detain and amuse him  Among the former I shall only mention the Arch at  Micklegatebar  and the multangular Tower and Wall near a Place called the  Mintyard  both built in the Time of the  Romans  But whether the Two Statues now prostrate on the Wall of St  Laurence Churchyard  be  Roman  or  Saxon  is hard to determine certain it is that the sepulchral Monument of the Standardbearer to the Ninth Legion of the  Roman  Army was dug up near  Micklegate  and in other Parts of the City have been found many  Roman  Altars Inscriptions Urns Coins and the like now in the Possession of the Curious  I do not include the Ruins of Abbeys Churches and Castles now to be seen in this Place among the Antiquities of it because they are but of a late Date compared with the antient Remains of the  Roman  Skill and Grandeur and because they would take up more Time and Room than the Nature of my Work will allow  The City of  York  is surrounded by a strong Wall kept in good Repair in which are four Gates and five Posterns It is a County of itself extending ever all the  Wapontake  called  Ainsty  and is governed by a Mayor who is styled Lord as at  London  a Recorder Aldermen in Commission of the Peace two Sheriffs Prime Commoncouncil Men eight Chamberlains Commoncouncil Men a Townclerk Swordbearer and Common Sergeant and the Mayor and Aldermen have Conservation of the Rivers  Ouze Humber Wherse Derwent Air  and  Dun  within certain Limits of each  This City always gives Title to the second Prince of the Blood Royal and the two Citizens they return to Parliament have a Privilege of taking their Places in the House of Commons next the Citizens of  London  upon what is called the Privy Counsellor's Bench a Privilege which if neglected to be claimed ought to be made known as it appertains to the  Citizens of  London  and  York  only and is by those of  London  exercised the first Day of the Meeting of every new Parliament  The Situation of  York  is in a Plain on both Sides the River  Ouse  It was formerly very populous and had a great Trade but has declined since the Reformation and the Difuse of the Court of President of the North In  Henry  the Vth's Time there were Parishes Chapels Hospitals and nine Abbeys besides the Cathedral and now there are only Churches in Use  The present Support of the City is chiefly owing to the Gentry who make it their Winter Residence as there is great Plenty of Provisions of all kinds to furnish an elegant Table at a moderate Expence so that the Altar which was found there with a  Roman  Inscription is applicable to the present Circumstances of the Place DIS DEABUSQUE HOSPITALIBUS And as the Inhabitants abound with the Conveniencies of Life they likewise partake of its Diversions there being Plays Assemblies MusickMeetings or some Entertainments every Night in the Week  The publick Edifices which most deserve Mention I shall now take Notice of and first of the Bridge over the  Ouse  It consists of five Arches the Diameter of the middle Arch which was the largest in the Kingdom before that at  Blenheim  House was built is Feet and its Height Feet The Reason it was built so wide was on occasion of an Accident which once happen'd to it when upon a sudden Thaw which occasion'd a great Flood a prodigious Weight of Ice drove down two Arches of the old Bridge by which Houses were demolished and several Persons drown'd  The great Councilchamber for this City near which the Records are kept as also the Exchequer and Courts of the Sheriffs and beneath them the  two City Prisons for Debtors and Felons are all upon this Bridge  The Castle which stands at the Confluence of the  Ouse  and the  Foss  was built by  William  the Conqueror  Anno  and tho' the Face it now wears and the Use made of it are so different from that which was the primitive State of this Fortress yet in its present Disguise it brought to my Memory that Tragical Scene of Bloodshed perpetrated within its Walls upon the th of  March  which being to be met with in very few Historians I shall give a brief Account of it  The  Jews  from their first Introduction into  England  growing immensly rich by Traffick never failed to become the Objects of Envy and Hatred both to Prince and People and the slightest Pretences were always eagerly laid hold of to plunder them so that on every new Accession or Turn of Affairs they were forced to compound for their Safety by large Presents to the Prince  At the Accession of  Richard  I tho' that Prince gave them no Disturbance yet he issued out an Order that no  Jew  should be present at the Ceremony of his Coronation either at Church or at Dinner  However the chief of the  Jews  from all Parts being summoned to  London  by their Brethren there in order to agree upon a rich Gift to the new King to obtain his Favour and Protection many of them notwithstanding the Injunction had the Curiosity to see the Ceremony and being discovered among the Croud by the Guards they were beat abused and some of them killed  The People hereupon being possessed with a Notion that the King had given Orders that the  Jews  be destroyed began a Massacre of them in  and plundered and burnt their Houses and  them many of their Wives and Children  And tho' the King immediately ordered a Proclamation to stop these Proceedings yet the Example at  London  was followed at  Norwich Lynn  and  Stamford  and with still greater Fury at  York  notwithstanding the King at his Departure to the  Holy Land  left Orders for the Protection of the  Jews  and the Punishment of such as should molest them for being inflamed by a wicked Priest certain bloody Wretches who had resolved upon the Destruction of the  Jews  and to inrich themselves with their Pillage set Fire to a Part of the City of  York  and while the Citizens were busy in extinguishing the Flames broke into the House of a principal  Jew  who had been murder'd at  London  and whose Wife had strengthened it for her Defence and murdering the whole Family and all who had taken Refuge there burnt the House to the Ground  The  Jews  hereupon in the utmost Terror got Leave to convey all their Wealth into the Castle and obtain'd Shelter there for their own Persons and for their Wives and Children except some few who were sacrific'd to the Rage of the Populace who burnt all the Houses of the  Jews  throughout the City  It unluckily happen'd that the Governor of the Castle having Business in the Town the poor  Jews  being afraid he went out to agree upon delivering them up to their Enemies refused him Admittance into it which incensing him he apply'd to the High Sheriff who raising the  Posse Comitatus  besieged the Castle and reduced the  Jews  to so great Extremity that being refused Mercy tho' they offer'd to buy it at the Expence of immense Sums they took the dreadful Advice of one of their Rabbi's come lately among them from abroad and first having burnt all their rich Goods and so damnify'd even their Plate that their barbarous Enemies could not be much the better for their Spoils they set Fire to all the Towers of the Castle and fell each Man to  cutting of the Throats of his own Family till they had destroy'd all who came into this dreadful Scheme of their Rabbi's who in the last Place followed the Advice he had given  In the mean time the Fire of the Castle increasing a Number of unhappy  Jews  who would not come into this bloody Action in vain endeavouring to extinguish it from the Walls besought the Mercy of the Besiegers acquainting them with what had happened and threw over the dead Bodies of their Brethren in Confirmation of the Truth of what they said and offering to become Christians had Hopes given them of their Lives but no sooner did their merciless Enemies gain Admittance than they butcher'd every one of the  Jews  calling aloud for Baptism in hopes of escaping their worse than  Paganish  Cruelty  Not satisfy'd with this the barbarous Robbers as well as Murderers ran next to the Cathedral where were deposited the Bonds and other Securities of the Money owing to the  Jews  by the Christians broke open the Chests and destroyed them all  There were Men who took Shelter in the Castle besides Women and Children So that the whole Number of the  Jews  thus miserably slaughter'd must be between and besides those who were massacred in the City  We must do this Justice to the King who was then in the  Holy Land  that as soon as he heard of this unparalleled Proceeding he was highly incensed and sent Orders to the Bishop of  Ely  his Chancellor and Regent to go down in Person to  York  and execute strict Justice without Favour or Affection on all Offenders The Bishop came to the City but the chief Authors of the Riot had fled to  Scotland  However the Citizens were laid under a large Fine and the Sheriff and Governor of the Castle were removed from their Places and committed  to Prison and the Soldiers concerned in the Fray were punished and turned out of Service but not one Man either then or afterwards was executed for the unheardof Villainy  The Strength of this Castle has been often experienced in Times of War and become famous in History upon Account of several memorable Events We hope for the future there will never be occasion to make any other Use of it than to the same necessary Purpose to which it is now converted namely a Prison but a Prison the most stately and complete of any in the whole Kingdom if not in  Europe  The present Edifice was erected in the Year In the left Wing of the Building is a handsome Chapel neatly adorned with suitable Furniture and an Allowance of  l  a Year is settled upon a Minister for performing Divine Service and Preaching to the Prisoners weekly and such of the Debtors as attend at Sermons are allowed each a large Loaf of fine Bread The Justices of the Peace take great Care that the Gaol shall be kept as neat withinside as it is noble without The Felons are allowed Straw and their Beds are now raised from the Ground and there is an Infirmary apart from the common Prison to which the Sick are conveyed and a Surgeon has an appointed Salary to attend them  The Castleyard is larger than the Areas of the  Fleet  or  King'sBench  in  London  and the Situation is so high pleasant and airy that 'tis surprising any Prisoners should remove themselves by  Habeas Corpus  to either of those Prisons unless it be with a View of purchasing the Liberty of the Rules because here they are never permitted to go without the Walls Strangers who visit the Inside of it seldom depart without making a trifling Purchace of some of the small Manufactures the Prisoners work up for Subsistence  The next Building we come to is the Assemblyroom for the Entertainment of the Nobility and Gentry who reside at  York  during the Races It was designed by the Earl of  Burlington  That Part which is the  Egyptian  Hall taken from a Draught of  Palladio  is in Length Feet broad and rather more in Height This Hall communicates with the common Ballroom in Length Feet in Height and Breadth Feet besides other Rooms for Cards and Tea all richly decorated and illuminated with magnificent Lustres The Front to the Street is an exceeding fine Piece of Architecture but the  Egyptian  Hall if you except the Banquetinghouse at  Whitehall  may undoubtedly claim the Preference of any other Room in the Kingdom if not in  Europe  The Expence of this Edifice amounting to several thousand Pounds was defrayed by Subscriptions chiefly among the Nobility and Gentry of the County who contributed some  l  and none less than  l  In the Year a very handsome Mansionhouse was erected for the LordMayor the Basement is a Rustick Arcade which supports an  Ionick  Order with a Pediment in it There is a large Room the Length of the Front Feet by so that this City has had the Honour to begin a Precedent for the City of  London  to copy after  The GuildHall is a Building very well deserving Notice as likewise are several other publick Edifices which are equally useful and ornamental to this antient City  But what exceeds all others in it is the Cathedral Church which for Magnificence of Structure challenges the Preeminence of all other  Gothick  Churches not only in this Kingdom but throughout  Europe  if I may rely upon the Opinion of a Gentleman with whom I viewed it and who had seen the Churches at  Strasburgh Milan  and  Notre Dame  in  Paris    The City of  Lincoln  indeed contends with this of  York  for a Preference to its Cathedral and as this is a Point in which both Cities are very tenacious I will distinguish the Particulars wherein each of them have the Advantage over the other as I have promised in Page  In the first Place then  Lincoln  Cathedral has greatly the Advantage of  York  in the Height of its Situation and by different Accounts given by several Authors of the Dimensions of both Churches it appears  Lincoln  exceeds  York  in Length from East to West either or or three Feet and a half in the middle Cross or Transept from North to South five Feet in the outward Breadth of the West End by the Addition of two Chapels as at St  Paul  's  London  Feet in the Height of the West Towers and Spires Feet and of the middle Tower including the Pinacles Feet  York  exceeds  Lincoln  in the Breadth of its middle Nef and Side Ayles withinside Feet in the Height of the middle Nef to its Canopy Feet and in the inside Height of the middle Lantern Feet and a half  The Breadth of the West End of  Lincoln  will not the least avail in this Dispute as it has so many egregious Defects not to say Absurdities The two Steeples are crouded together instead of being placed at the Extremities of the Front which by that means would have had an Appearance much more grand They rise up above the Body of the Church as if behind a Screen without the least Affinity to any Part of the Building below Their Ornaments are but mean and the Leaden Spires upon them still meaner The whole Front extending in a strait Line wants Boldness when viewed at some Distance and there is such an Expansion of solid Wall without Windows or any sort of Aperture as gives a Heaviness throughout The cloistred Work or Niches  for Images which is the chief ornamental Part of  Gothick  Structures is disposed with a shameful Disregard to every thing like Design in one Place crouded with needless Profusion in another wanted to fill up where now there is nothing but a naked and dead Space and in the Ornaments the Fancy is so irregularly varied that all kind of Connexion and Harmony is destroyed so that the Building to Appearance has the same Effect as if it were Pieces of different Structures patched up together  The Plan of the Church is very irregular the middle Transept from North to South having no Ayles on the Westside to answer those on the East The upper Transept or double Cross can never be considered as a beautiful Addition especially since this and the Eastern Parts beyond are surrounded with Chapels and Vestries erected without Uniformity and the Windows of the Church are meanly small crouded and out of Proportion  'Tis to be observed there is a great Resemblance between the Groundplat of  Lincoln  and that of  Canterbury  and the one was certainly built after the Model of the other  The only Defect objected to  York  is that the middle Tower or Lantern wants Height and that the Cross or Transept from North to South is built in a different Style and Manner from the rest of the Cathedral Both these must be admitted to be Faults but by the way the middle Lantern is as lofty as the celebrated Towers of  Canterbury  and  Gloucester  exclusive of their Pinacles tho' not sufficiently high in proportion to its Breadth being Feet square or to the Height of the Church They have a Tradition in this City that a Wooden Spire was once intended to have been raised upon this Tower which in that Case would have exceeded the Height of  Salisbury  Steeple as the present Battlements are higher by six Feet and of a  larger Square than the present Tower at  Salisbury    I am not sorry this Project failed because 'tis obvious all Wooden Spires have a most wretched Aspect  The only Amendment that can be made would be to pull down the Bellturret at one Corner and to raise the Battlements about Feet piercing them thro' with proper Ornaments and carry four Pinacles above them about Feet more  However this Building has two remarkable Beauties not to be found in any other  Gothick  Edifice which are that the Height and Breadth of the Nef and Side Ayles of the Church and of all the Arches and Windows come very near if not agree with the Dimensions laid down by the established Rules of  Roman  Architecture that the Span of the Roof from East to West rises very near equal to the modern Proportion the excessive Height of the Roofs being the chief Blemishes in most Cathedrals as may be seen at  Lincoln Salisbury Westminster  and particularly  Winchester    The Plan of the whole Church is uniform as well as the Superstructure especially from East to West the Windows are of a Size and Distance proper to the Magnitude of the Structure and are admirable for their Workmanship neither is it crouded and encumbered on the Outside by its Butresses but every Part is inrich'd with Ornaments which receive an additional Beauty from the Colour of the Stone as it retains almost its original Whiteness  Thus far what I have said of this Building in general was necessary in comparing it with  Lincoln  I will now take some Notice of its several Parts distinctly both withinside and without beginning first at the Outside  The West End which is Feet in Breadth shews a Grandeur inexpressible this Front contains  two uniform Towers diminished by several Contractions all cloistred for Imagery and inrich'd with other Ornaments In the South Tower hangs a deep Peal of Bells the Tenor weighing hundred Weight  Between these Towers over the principal Entrance into the Church is a large Window whose Tracery in Masons Work is of a Figure so beautiful that it cannot be equalled anywhere The several Windows in the Towers are large and their Tracery and Ornaments well fansied  The South Entrance is ascended by several Courses of Steps and Tradition assures us there was once as great an Ascent to the West Door Here a remarkable Spiral Turret is erected on the middle of the Pediment and called the  Fiddlers Turret  from an Image of a Fidler on the Top Over the Door is a Dial both Horary and Solar on each Side of which two Images strike the Quarters on two Bells  In viewing the Building from this Part Eastward we easily discerned it to be much newer than that Westward tho' conformable to it  The East Front is exceeding noble and has the finest Window in the World  The North Side is the same as the South only a Wall is built to prevent Nightwalkers and other disorderly Persons from nesting and intriguing in the obscure Corners of the Buttresses  The Lantern Steeple of which I have spoken already is ornamented in a fine Taste wanting nothing but a better Finishing at the Top it has eight Windows two on each Side to give Light within these Windows from Top to Bottom are Feet high  We now entered the Inside at the West Door opening into the middle Nef of the Church under the largest  Gothick  Arch in  Europe  which binds and supports the two Towers The Nef is the most  spacious of any in  Europe  except  St Peter  's at  Rome  it exceeds the Dimensions of the Nef of  St Paul  's Cathedral four Feet six Inches in Width and Feet in Height and that of  Westminster Abbey  Feet six Inches in Breadth but its Height is two Feet less This is an Instance of what I took Notice of before with regard to the Justness of the Proportion of  York  Cathedral and at the same time shews the Extravagance of that of  Westminster Abbey  in this Particular The Canopy at Top is inriched with curious Knots of Carving  From thence we proceeded under the Middle Lantern to a Stone Screen that parts the Choir from the Body of the Church adorned with curious Workmanship among which are placed the Statues of the  British  Kings from the Conquest to  Henry  VI  Over the Entrance into the Choir stands the Organ having a double Front it had before been removed from thence by King  Charles  I to one Side opposite to the Bishop's Throne The Reason his Majesty gave for doing it was That it spoil'd the Prospect of the fine East Windows from the Body of the Church  The Choir is adorned with antient Woodwork carved and set up with Clusters of knotted Pinacles of different Heights The Ascent from the Body of the Church thro' the Choir to the Altar is by a Gradation of Steps The Altar has lately received a considerable Improvement as to its Situation and the whole Church in its Beauty by taking away a large wooden Screen which almost obstructed the View of the East Window By this means it was carried one Arch farther back to a Stone Screen of excellent  Gothick  Architecture which now not only shews a Beauty in itself before hid but opens a View to one of the noblest Lights in the World both for Masonry and Glazing which is the aforementioned East Window  This Window is Feet Nine Inches broad and Feet high the Upperpart is a Piece of fine Tracery but in my Opinion not so beautiful as that at the West End Below the Tracery are Partitions wherein are represented in fine painted Glass most of the History of the  Bible  This Window was glazed in by one  John Thornton  Glazier of  Coventry  who received for his own Work  s  a Week and contracted to finish the Whole in Three Years  In a circular Window at the South End of the Church is another fine Piece of Masonry in the Form of a Wheel called  The Marygold Window  from its painted Glass which resembles the Colour of that Flower The North End has Five noble Lights each constitute one large Window and reach almost from Top to Bottom There is a Tradition that Five Maiden Sisters were at the Expence of these Lights The Painting of the Glass represents a kind of Embroidery or  Mosaick  Needlework which might perhaps give Occasion to the Story  I ought not to omit mentioning that all the Windows of the Church except one or two are adorned with painted Glass representing the Sacred History and the Portraitures of eminent Persons This Painting was preserved at the Time of the Civil Wars by the Lord  Fairfax  General of the Parliament's Army who at the Request of the Gentry and Citizens of  York  placed a Guard of Soldiers about the Church for that Purpose  The Body of the Church has been lately new paved the Plan of which was drawn by that ingenious Architect Mr  Kent  under the Direction of the Earl of  Burlington  the Figure is  Mosaick  and properly adapted to a  Gothick  Building  The Monuments in this Church are numerous many of them very antient and several very magnificent  but to enumerate them distinctly would take up more Room than I can spare  After taking this View of the Cathedral we were conducted into the Chapterhouse a Building which for a  Gothick  Piece disdains to allow an Equal in the Universe and well deserves the Encomium bestowed upon it as is said by a great Traveller in an old Monkish Verse inscribed on the Wall in Golden Letters as follows  Ut rosa phlos phlorum sic est domus ista domorum  'Tis an Octagon of Feet Diameter The Height to the Middle Knot of the Roof is Feet ten Inches unsupported by any Pillars and intirely dependent upon one Pin geometrically placed in the Centre The whole Roof has been richly painted and the Knots of carved Work gilt but is now defaced and sullied by Time Over the Roof is a Spire of Timberwork covered with Lead admired as a masterly Piece of Work in the Carpenter's Art The Eight Squares of the Octagon have each a Window beautifully adorned and imbellished with painted Glass  The next Place we saw was the Vestryroom its Dimensions Feet by wherein are kept several Antiquities particularly the famous Horn so called made of an Elephant's Tooth which is indeed the greatest Piece of Antiquity the Church can exhibit and to which they ought to pay a high Veneration on Account of the Benefit they reap from the Act that it witnessed to The Account  Camden  gives of it is  "That  Ulphus  the Son of  Toraldus  who governed in the West Parts of  Deira  by reason of a Difference likely to happen betwixt his eldest Son and his youngest about his Lordship when he was dead presently took this Course Without Delay he went to  York  and taking the Horn wherein he was wont to drink  with him he filled it with Wine and kneeling before the Altar bestowed upon God and the blessed St  Peter  all his Lands"  The Lands are still called  de Terra Ulphi  The Horn was imagined to have been quite lost but  Thomas  Lord  Fairfax  was the Occasion of its being preserved Where it had lain or where he got it is uncertain but stripp'd of its Golden Ornaments it was restored by his Successor The Chapter thought fit to decorate it anew and bestowed the following Inscription to the Memory of the Restorer upon it  CORNU HOC ULPHUS IN OCCIDENTALI PARTE  DEIRAE PRINCEPS UNA CUM OMNIBUS TERRIS  ET REDDITIBUS SUIS OLIM DONAVIT  AMISSVM VEL ABREPTVM  HENRICUS DOM FAIRFAX DEMVM RESTITVIT  DEC ET CAPIT DE NOVO ORNAVIT  A D MDCLXXV  I will now conclude my Account of this noble Pile of Building with the Character given of it as Mr  Camden  informs us by  Aeneas Sylvius  afterwards Pope  Pius  II  "It is says he famous for its Magnificence and Workmanship all the World over but especially for a fine lightsome  Chapel  with shining Walls and small thin wasted Pillars quite round"  The South Side of the Church is inriched by a Library to which Archbishop  Matthews  's Widow was a great Benefactress A Bishop was her Father and an Archbishop her Fatherinlaw she had Four Bishops for her Brethren and an Archbishop for her second Husband  The Bishop had a Palace in the Minsteryard where great Hospitality was wont to be kept but it has been long since leased out And to shew the  wondrous Change of Times one End of it is now converted into a Dancingschool and the other into a Playhouse  In the Archbishop's Register and Prerogative Office is a noble Repository of antient Ecclesiastick Records bearing Date Years earlier than any at  Lambeth  or  Canterbury    The Church of  AllSaints  in the  Pavement  is a beautiful old Church with a  Gothick  Steeple of exquisite Workmanship Upon the Tower is a fine Lantern with Pinacles of a considerable Height not much unlike that of  Boston  in  Lincolnshire    St Margaret  's Church has one of the most extraordinary Porches I ever saw It is a most sumptuous and elaborate Piece of  Gothick  Architecture with our Saviour on the Cross on the Top of it but what seems still more surprising is that they say it did not originally belong to the Church but was brought hither from the dissolved Hospital of  St Nicolas    St Mary's  in  Castlegate  is admired for a pyramidical Steeple as  Christ  's Church is for a very fine modern one  In the Month of  August  a Subscription was set on Foot for an Infirmary in this City like those begun at  London Winchester  c which we have mentioned And this excellent Charity has found much Encouragement and Support here  A Manufacture of Cotton is lately established in this City and is arrived at a very great Perfection and I could not but be greatly pleased when I was there last to see a very handsome Procession made on this Occasion  viz  on  Mayday  at which Time Mr  Clough  the Master of the Manufactory together with the several Artificers concern'd therein marched thro' the City in the following manner preceded by the City Musick  viz  There were Three Stages borne each by Six Porters On the first Stage were the Teazer Carder Rover Spinner  and Reeler of the Cottonwool On the second the Bleecher and Winder of the Linenyarn On the third the Quillwinder and Weaver Each Person exercising their several Branches from the picking of the Wool to the finishing the Cloth The Men Women and Children imploy'd in the Manufactory closed the Procession all of them cloathed with Cottons or striped and figured Fustians of their own making provided for them by the generous Contributions of the Citizens  This Manufactory being so well fix'd and establish'd in so short a time is principally owing to the great Encouragement given by the City who are determin'd to spare no Pains or Expences to support it The Bells in the Cathedral and in all the Parish Churches rung the whole Time of the Procession  The City of  York  stands upon more Ground perhaps than any in  England  except  London  and  Norwich  but then the Buildings are not so close as at  Bristol  or  Durham  nor is it so populous as either  Bristol  or  Norwich  But as  York  is full of Gentry and Persons of Distinction so they have Houses proportioned to their Quality which makes the City lie so far extended on both Sides of the River  While we were here we took one Day's Time to see the fatal Field called  Marston Moor  where Prince  Rupert  a third time by his Excess of Valour and Defect of Conduct lost the Royal Army and had a Victory wrung out of his Hands after he had all the Advantage he could desire  I made another Excursion to the Duke of  Leeds  's House at  Kiveton  then to the Earl of  Carlisle  's called  Castle Howard  and the Earl of  Burlington  's at  Lanesborough  in the Eastriding  Carlislehouse  or  Castle Howard  is in the Middle of a Wood which is as great a Wonder in its Kind▪ as Mr  Aislabie  's Park The House is of a vast Extent▪ and tho' it makes a fine Appearance at a Distance▪  yet will it not bear a critical Examination of the Architecture when viewed near There goes a Story That the Architect was so sensible of his Errors in one of the Fronts that he would fain have persuaded the late Earl of  Carlisle  to pull it down again The Whole is not yet finished  The Earl of  Burlington  's in an oldbuilt House most advantageously situated on a rising Ground with a noble Prospect as well towards the  Humber  as towards the  Woulds    I passed likewise thro' the Forest of  Galtres  a little North of the City It is in some Places very thick of Trees and in others very moorish and boggy it formerly extended to the very Gates of the City but now 'tis much lessen'd and several considerable Villages are built in it  Having mentioned so many Forests you'll undoubtedly conclude there is no want of Firing in this County 'Tis very true for here is not only Wood enough but Coal too which is a very great Comfort to the Poor against the Inclemency of this cold Northern Climate which indeed has very great need of Firing  At  Hambletondown  are the Races where the King's Plate of an hundred Guineas is run for once a Year by FiveYearOlds a Gift nowhere better bestowed than on that County which is so famous for breeding of Horses for the rest of the Kingdom  From  York  we enter'd again into the Westriding and travelling due West we came to  Wetherby  upon the River  Aire  which we omitted to take in our Course as we passed by this River in our former Journey being then more out of our Way than here It is a good Trading Town but has nothing remarkable in it  Some Miles farther to the South stands  Tadcaster  upon the South Side of the River  Wherfe  where the Road from  Chester  and that from  Cambridge  to  York    meet and is consequently well provided for the Reception of Travellers It is principally noted for Limestones and a fine Stone Bridge over the River But it has nothing that we could see to testify the Antiquity it boasts of but some old  Roman  Coins which our Landlord the Postmaster shewed us among which was one of  Domitian  of the same Kind I believe as that which Mr  Camden  gives an Account of but so very much defaced with Age that we could read but DO and AV at a Distance Here is the Hospital and School still remaining founded by Dr  Oglethorp  Bishop of  Carlisle  who for want of a Protestant Archbishop set the Crown on the Head of Queen  Elizabeth  but she afterwards notwithstanding that Circumstance deprived him  Here also we saw plainly the  Roman  Causway which I have beforementioned at  Aberforth  and a stately Stone Bridge over the  Wherfe    Mr  Camden  gives us a Distich of a learned Passenger upon this River and the old Bridge at  Tadcaster  I suppose he passed it in a dry Summer  Nil  Tadcaster  habes Musis vel carmine dignum    Praeter magnifice structum fine fiumine pontem  In  English  thus  Nought  Tadcaster  can thee to Fame bequeath  But a proud Bridgewith ne'er a Stream beneath  But I can assure you to the contrary of this for tho' when I travelled this Way it was about the Middle of  June  I found the River pretty full  On this Road we passed over  Towton  that famous Field where a most cruel and bloody Battle was fought between the Two Houses of  Lancaster  and  York  in the Reign of  Edward  IV I call it most cruel and bloody because the Animosity of the Par+ties was so great that tho' they were Countrymen and Neighbours nay as History says Relations  for here Fathers killed their Sons and Sons their Fathers for some time they fought with such Obstinacy and Rancour that they gave no Quarter 'Tis certain such Numbers were never slain in one Battle in  England  since that fought between King  Harold  and  William the Conqueror  at  Battle  in  Sussex  for here fell in the Whole Men and the  Yorkists  proved victorious  Tradition guided us to the very Spot but there remain no visible Marks of the Action The Ploughmen indeed say that sometimes they turn up Arrowheads Spearheads broken Javelins Helmets and the like  Farther South still or rather Southeast on the Road to  Doncaster  stands  Shirbourn  a pretty good Town famous for a well endow'd Hospital erected by one  Hungate  a Protestant for the Maintenance at Bed Board and Cloathing  c  of Children from Seven till Fifteen Years old when according to their Genius and Capacity some are sent to the University or apprenticed out to Trades for which there is a Provision which including the Maintenance of the Hospital amounts to  l  a Year A noble and well chosen Piece of Charity  We turned East to  Selby  situate on the South Side of the  Ouse  a small Markettown but very well inhabited and is famous for giving Birth to our  Henry  I The  Conqueror  built an Abbey here  We then fell down directly South and came to  Snath  upon the  Aire  which is but an inconsiderable Town but like  Selby  has a pretty good Trade I should have mention'd that there are several Merchants that live at  Selby  and that the  Ouse  is navigable up to the Town for large Vessels and has a good Share of Trade that Way  We fell down still lower South to  Thorn  on the River  Dun  an indifferent Town of no other Not  than its Situation within the Marshes which is  called  Marshland Island  for it is incompassed by the  Dun  the  Aire  the  Ouse  and another little River which parts it from the Isle of  Axholm  on the Edge of  Lincolnshire  already spoken of so that these Two River Islands are contiguous  Being now come to the Banks of the  Ouse  near the Influx of the  Trent  into the  Humber  I shall after reminding you that I have now accomplished another Part of the Proposition in my last Letter cross over the  Ouse  to  Howdon    Howdon  lies on the  Ouse  North in the Eastriding of  Yorkshire  It is a pretty large Town and is subject to great Inundations from the River occasioned by the Freshes which come down from the  Woulds  and has been so it seems ever since when a Bishop of  Durham  built a very tall Steeple to the Church that in case of a sudden Inundation the People might save themselves in it And there have been within these few Years several Commissions for Repairing the Banks  The Fair or Mart held here for Eight Days together is very considerable for Inland Trade and several Wholesale Tradesmen come to it from  London  But the Town is more famous for the Birth or Residence of one of our antient Historians  Roger  of  Hoveden  or  Howdon  a Monk of this Abbey Mr  Camden  's Continuator is mistaken in saying this Town stands upon the  Derwent  for it is above Three Miles Southeast of it tho' the  Derwent  was made navigable pursuant to Act of Parliament  Annae  to the  Ouse    The Bishop of  Durham  has a Temporal Jurisdiction in this Part of the Country which is called  Howdonshire    I found nothing in this low Part of the Country but a wonderful Conflux of great Rivers all pouring down into the  Humber  which receiving the  Aire    the  Ouse  the  Dun  and the  Trent  becomes rather a Sea than a River  I observed that the Middle of this Division of  Yorkshire  is very thin of Towns and People being overspread with  Woulds  which are Plains and Downs like those of  Salisbury  which feed great Numbers of Sheep Black Cattle and Horses and produce Corn The Northern Part especially is more mountainous which makes Part of the Northriding But the East and West Parts are populous and rich and full of Towns the one lying on the Sea Coast and the other upon the River  Derwent  as above The Sea Coast or Southeast Side is called  Holderness    From hence we travelled Northeast up to  Wighton  being but a very little out of the Way to  Beverley  It is a small but antient Markettown seated on the Banks of a little River called  Foulness  Here are some  Roman  as well as  British  Antiquities 'Tis supposed to be the  Delgovitia  Station of the  Romans  from the  British  Word  Ddelw  or  Delgive  signifying  Image  Some have conjectured that here has been a Temple of the  Druids  and that their Groves were in the Wood of  Dierwald  which they interpret as derived from the  British  Word  Derwen  an  Oak    On the Northwest of  Wighton  towards the  Derwent  stands the Markettown of  Pocklington  which we were told was so inconsiderable that it would not be worth our while to go so much out of our Way to see it So keeping on East under the  Woulds  we arrived at  Beverley  which is situate just at the Foot of them about a Mile from the River  Hull  It is a large populous corporate Town under the Government of a Mayor Aldermen  c  It takes its Name from the great Number of Beavers with which that River abounded It had formerly a considerable Trade by means of a Creek or Cut commonly called  Beverleybeck  of old made from the Town to the River  Hull  which runs into the  Humber  for the Passage of  Ships and Boats Keels Wherries Hoys  c  to and from the said Town and as it had likewise divers Staiths or Landingplaces adjoining to the said Beech for the Lading and Unlading of all sorts of Merchandize the Town was wont to receive no small Advantage from this Cut or River But there being no settled Fund for keeping it open and cleansing it and the Expence of doing it being beyond the Ability of the Corporation the said Beck was in time choaked up and the Staiths grew out of Repair whence an Act passed  Anno  for Cleansing Deepening and Widening the Creek and for Repairing the Staiths and for Mending the Roads leading from the said Cut to the Town and at the same time providing for the Cleansing of the Town itself all which has had a very good Effect for before the Creek lying in the lower Part of the Town th  Filth Dirt and Soil of the Town was washed int  it which very much contributed to choak it up  Beverley  is the chief Town of the Eastriding and began to be of great Note from the Time that  John  of  Beverly  Archbishop of  York  the first Doctor of Divinity in  Oxford  and Preceptor to Venerable  Bede  built a Monastery here and afterwards retired into it himself where he died  A D  King  Athelstan  having made a Vow at the Altar of St  John  before he proceeded against the  Scots  in his Return  A D  instituted a new College of Secular Canons and granted to the Town many Immunities particularly to the Freemen of it an Exemption from all manner of Tolls which was afterwards confirmed by King  Henry  I  and by all or most of the Kings and Queens of this Realm to this Time  as the Mayor's Certificate expresses it which he gives to such Freemen as apply for it in the Form following  Villa de  Beverley  in Com  ' Ebor  ss  To all Persons to whom these Presents shall come  A B  Esq  Mayor of the aforesaid Town of  Beverley  sendeth greeting  KNow ye that King  Athelstan  of famous Memory did grant and also King  Henry  the First did grant and confirm to the Men of the said Town of  Beverley  and afterwards to them by the Name of the Governors or Keepers and Burgesses of  Beverley  an Exemption of all manner of Imposts Toll Tallage Stallage Tunnage Lastage Pickage Wharsage and of and from all and every the like Exactions Payments and Duties throughout and in all Places whatsoever by Sea and Land within all their Dominions of  England  and  Wales  Which said Grants were confirmed by all or most of the succeeding Kings and Queens to the Time of Queen  Elizabeth  who confirmed the same to them by the Name of the Mayor Governors and Burgesses of  Beverley  with several Grants which have been also confirmed by all or most of the Kings and Queens of this Realm till this Time as by many and sundry Charters under their Great Seals more at large may appear These are therefore to certify that  C D  is a Burgess of the said Town of  Beverley  and is therefore discharged of and from all and every the said Exactions Payments and Duties In Testimony whereof the said Mayor hath hereunto subscribed his Name and caused the Common Seal of the said Town used in this Behalf to be affixed this Day  c  By these and the like Privileges the Town keeps up its flourishing Condition notwithstanding it is within Six Miles of so powerful a Rival as  Hull    It has all the Advantage indeed of a good Situation to invite Gentlemen to reside in it and being the nearest Town of Note to the Centre of this Riding the Sessions are always held here in a spacious and beautiful Hall which has a publick Garden and Walks not inferior to any of their kind in  England  In this  Hallgarth  as it is called is a handsome Registeroffice for Deeds and Wills within this Division which is the only County in  England  besides  Middlesex  which has such a Registry to the great Reproach of the Nation be it said especially when it shall be remembered that no less than two Bills one for a Registry for the County of  Surrey  and another after that for a General Registry over the whole Kingdom were respectively opposed and miscarried very lately in Parliament  Here are Two weekly Markets one on  Wednesdays  for Cattle the other on  Saturdays  for Corn The Marketplace is as large as most having a beautiful Cross supported by Eight Freestone Columns of one intire Stone each erected at the Charge of Sir  Charles Hotham  and Sir  Michael Wharton  upon which was this Inscription  HAEC SEDES LAPIDEA FREEDSTOOLE DICITUR i e PACIS CATHEDRA AD QUAM REVS FVGIENDO PERVENIENS OMNIMODAM HABET SECVRITATEM  That is  This Stone Seat is called  FreedStoole  or Chair of Peace to which if any Criminal flee he shall have full Protection  The Common Gaol has been lately reedified at a considerable Expence the Windows well sashed and as if Works of Piety were more peculiarly adapted to this Place there are Seven Almshouses in the Town and Legacies left for Two more  besides a Workhouse which has cost  l  It has a Freeschool to the Scholars of which are appropriated Two Fellowships at  St John's  College in  Cambridge  and Nine Exhibitions  Here were formerly Four Churches now only Two but the largest and finest Parochial ones in the Kingdom  viz  the late Collegiate Church of  St John the Evangelist  still called the  Minster  and  St Mary's  The Minster being very ruinous a Brief was procured for the Repair of it in the Year the Produce of which and the Subscription Money being placed in the publick Funds was farther augmented by the Rise of  SouthSea  Stock which enabled the prudent Managers to complete their pious Design in the most beautiful manner assisted by the Advice of that noted Architect  Nicolas Hawksmore    Esq  King  George  I encouraged this Work not only by a liberal Donation of Money but of Stone likewise from the dissolved Monastery of  St Mary's  in  York  Sir  Michael Wharton  gave in his Lifetime  l  and by Will  l  as a perpetual Fund towards keeping it in Repair  The Choir is paved with Marble of Four different Colours Lozengewise appearing cubical to the Eye Over the Altar is a large and magnificent wooden Arch curiously engraven standing upon Eight fluted Columns of the  Corinthian  Order The Altartable is one intire Stone of white Marble finely polished the Gift of Mr  Moyser  The East Window is of painted Glass collected out of the several Windows about the Church but so artfully joined that they make throughout one regular and intire Figure The Screen between the Choir and the Nef has been lately rebuilt of Rochabbey Stone in the  Gothick  Style and is deservedly esteemed one of the chief Ornaments of the Church The Body of the Church is paved with the said Stone intermixed with black Marble The Pulpit  Readingdesk and Cover of the Font are all new and of excellent Workmanship the Galleries also are new and beautifully finished supported by Columns of the  Dorick  Order But not the least surprising Thing in this Pile is the North End Wall of the great cross Ayle which hung over Three Feet and a half but was screwed up to its proper Level by the ingenious Contrivance of Mr  Thornton  of  York  who prepared an admirable Machine for the Purpose  On the th of  September Anno  upon opening a Grave they met with a Vault of square Free Stone Feet long and Two Feet broad within it was a Sheet of Lead Four Feet long and in that the Ashes and Six Beads whereof Three crumbled to Dust with a Touch of the Three remaining Two were supposed to be  Cornelian  with Three great Brass Pins and Four large Iron Nails Upon the Sheet lay a leaden Plate with this Inscription in Capital Letters  Anno ab Incarnatione Domini  MCLXXXVIII  com  fuit haec Ecclesia in mense Septembri in sequenti  post festum sancti Matthaei apostoli Et in Anno  MCXCVII  sexto idus Martii facta fuit inquisitio retiquiarum beati Joannis in hoc loco et inventa sunt haec ossa in orientali parte sepulchri et hic recondita et pulvis cemento mixtus ibidem inventus est et reconditus  Thus  English'd  In the Year of the Lord's Incarnation in  September  the Night after the Festival of St  Matthew  the Apostle this Church was consumed by Fire and in the Year on the th of  March  Search was made for the Reliques of St  John  in this Place and these Bones were found in the Eastern Part of the  Sepulchre and here deposited and a Mixture of Dust and Mortar was found in the same Place and deposited  Over this lay a Box of Lead about Seven Inches long Six broad and Five deep wherein were several Pieces of Bones mixed with a little Dust and yielding a sweet Smell All these Things were carefully reinterred in the Middle Ayle of the Body of the Minster with this Inscription added in Capital Letters  Reliquiae eaedem effossae et ibidem compositae fornice lateritio dignabantur  XXVI  die mensis Martii Anno Domini  MDCCXXVI  quando  v  tesselatum ecclesiae hujus pavimentum primo fuit instauratum  Thus  English'd  The same Reliques which were dug up and replaced were adorned with an Arch of Brickwork on the th Day of  March  when the Fifth tesselated Pavement of this Church was first repaired  Over it directly upon the Roof is an Inscription to shew where the Reliques are interr'd  In this Church are several Monuments of the  Piercies  Earls of  Northumberland  who have added a little Chapel to the Choir On the Right Side of the Altarplace stands the Freedstool mentioned above made of one intire Stone and said to have been removed from  Dunbar  in  Scotland  with a Well of Water behind it At the upper End of the Body of the Church next the Choir hangs an antient Table with the Picture of St  John  the Evangelist from whom the Church is named and of King  Athelstan  the Founder of it and between them this Distich  Als free make I thee  As Heart can wish or Egh can see  In the Body of the Church stands an antient Monument which they call the  Virgins Tomb  because Two Virgin Sisters lay buried there who gave the Town a Piece of Land into which any Freeman may put Three Milch Kine from  Ladyday  to  Michaelmas  At the lower End of the Body of the Church stands a fair large Font of Agat Stone  The principal Trade of the Town is making Malt Oatmeal and tann'd Leather but the poor People mostly support themselves by working Bonelace which of late has met with particular Encouragement the Children being maintained at School to learn to read and to work this Sort of Lace The Clothingtrade was formerly followed in this Town but  Leland  tells us that even in his Time it was very much decayed  They have several Fairs but one more especially remarkable called the  Mart  beginning about Nine Days before  Ascensionday  and kept in a Street leading to the  Minster Garth  called  Londonersstreet  for the  Londoners  bring down their Wares and furnish the Country Tradesmen by Wholesale  About a Mile from  Beverly  to the East in a Pasture belonging to the Town is a kind of  Spaw  tho' they say it cannot be judged by the Taste whether it comes from any Mineral or not yet taken inwardly it is a great Drier and bathed in dries scorbutick Scurf and all Sorts of Scabs and also very much helps against the King's Evil  From  Beverley  I came to  Hull  properly called  Kingston upon Hull  Distance Six Miles If you would have an Idea of  Hamburgh Dantzick Rotterdam  or any of the second Cities abroad which are famed for their Commerce you may visit this Town It is not indeed so large as those but in  proportion to the Dimensions of it I believe more Business is done in  Hull  than in any Town in  Europe Liverpoole  of late comes very near it but it has not the Advantage of a  London  Trade which  Hull  has  In the last War the Fleets from  Hull  to  London  were frequently Sail sometimes including the other Creeks in the  Humber  Sail at a time and to  Holland  their Trade was so considerable that the  Dutch  always imployed Two Men of War to convoy the Merchantmen to and from  Hull  and those were as many as they sent to  London    In a word all the Trade at  Leeds Wakefield  and  Halifax  of which I have spoken so particularly is negotiated here All the Lead Trade of  Derbyshire  and  Nottinghamshire  from  Bautry  Wharf the Butter of the East and Northriding brought down the  Ouse  to  York  the Cheese down the  Trent  from  Stafford Warwick  and  Cheshire  and the Corn from all the Counties adjacent are shipped off here  So again they supply all these Countries with foreign Goods for which they trade to all Parts of the known World nor have the Merchants of any Port in  Britain  greater Credit or a fairer Character than the Merchants of  Hull  as well for the Justice of their Dealings as the Greatness of their Substance From  Norway  and the  Baltick Dantzick Riga Narva  and  Petersburg  they make large Returns in Iron Copper Hemp Flax Canvas  Muscovy  Linen and Yarn and other Things all which they get Vend for in the Country in prodigious Quantities They have also a great Importation of Wine Linen Oil Fruit  c  from  Holland France  and  Spain  The Trade of Tobacco and Sugars from the  WestIndies  they chiefly manage by the Way of  London  But besides all this their Export of Corn as well to  London  as to  Holland  and  France  exceeds all of the  Kind that is or can be at any Port in  England London  excepted  Their Shipping is a great Article in which they exceed all the Towns and Ports on that Coast except  Yarmouth  saving that their Shipping consists chiefly in smaller Vessels than the Coaltrade is supplied with tho' they have a great many large Vessels too which are imployed in their foreign Trade  The Town is situated at the Mouth of the River  Hull  where it falls into the  Humber  and where the  Humber  opens into the  German  Ocean so that one Side of the Town lies upon the Sea the other upon the Land This makes the Situation naturally very strong and were there occasion it is capable of being made impregnable by reason of the low Grounds round it  The Advantages of this Situation struck King  Edward  I as he was riding a hunting after his Return from the Defeat of the  Scots  in the Year Upon which he immediately granted several Privileges and Immunities to those who would build and settle here erected a Manorhall himself and fitted up an Harbour from whence it received the Name of  Kingstown  It held out against King  Charles  I who went in Person to demand it when Sir  John Hotham  told his Majesty  "He kept it for the Parliament against him"  Yet both the  Hothams viz  Father and Son lost their Heads by that very Parliament  King  Charles  II on occasion of the frequent  Dutch  Wars in his Reign had once resolved to appoint a Station for a Squadron of Men of War here with a Yard and Dock for building Ships and on this Occasion resolved to make the Place strong in proportion to what those Affairs required upon which a large Citadel was marked out on the other Side of the River but it was never finished  The Town is exceeding close built and populous even to an Inconvenience having really no room to extend itself by Buildings There are but Two Churches  Trinity  and  St Mary's  the former is very large in which is a fine Altarpiece by  Parmentier  the latter is thought to have been once larger than it is King  Henry  VIII used it as his Chapel Royal and with the same Freedom for this Defender of the Faith and Protector of the Church pulled down the Steeple because it stood opposite to the Place where he resided The Inhabitants afterwards built it up again at their own Expence  They shew us still in their Townhall the Figure of a Northern Fisherman supposed to be of  Greenland  He was taken up at Sea in a Leathern Boat which he sat in and was covered with Skins which drew together about his Waist so that the Boat could not take in Water and he could not sink The Creature would neither feed nor speak and so died  They have a very handsome Exchange here where the Merchants from foreign Countries and others from the different Parts of the Kingdom meet as at  London  The Business arising from the Navigation of all the great Rivers which fall into the  Humber  is transacted here There is also a fine Freeschool founded by  John Alcock  Bishop of  Worcester  afterwards of  Ely  who was born at  Beverley  but chose to extend his Liberality to this Place Over the School is the Merchant's Hall  But the Trinity House here is the Glory of the Town It is a Corporation of itself composed of a Society of Merchants It was begun by voluntary Contribution for Relief of distressed and aged Seamen and their Wives or Widows but was afterwards improved by the Government and incorporated They have a very good Revenue which increases every Day by Charities  They maintain Sisters now actually in the House Widows of Seamen They have a Government by Elder Brethern and Six Assistants Out of the they chuse annually Two Wardens but the whole vote in electing them and Two Stewards These have a Power to decide Disputes between Masters of Ships and their Crews in Matters relating to Sea Affairs and with this Limitation that their Judgment be not contrary to the Laws of the Land but so great Deference is paid to it that in Trials at Law in such Affairs they are often called to give their Opinions  Here is a noble Stone Bridge over the River  Hull  consisting of Arches A  Greenland  Fishery set up in this Town went on with Success for a while but it decayed in the Time of the  Dutch  Wars and the House built by the  Greenland  Merchants is now turned into Granaries for Corn and Warehouses for other Goods  The old Hospital call'd GOD'S HOUSE stands near it with a Chapel both which were pulled down in the Civil Wars but were rebuilt in and the Arms of the  de la Poles  being found among the Ruins were placed over the Door of the Hospital with this Inscription  DEO ET PAVPERIBVS POSVIT  MICHAEL DE LA POLE  This  Michael  was the Son of  William de la Pole  sometime a Merchant at  Ravenspurn  formerly a flourishing Town of Trade at the Mouth of the  Humber  but being removed to this new Town of  Kingston  in the Time of  Edward  III gave that King a magnificent Entertainment when in the Sixth Year of his Reign he came to take a View of the Place upon which our Merchant was knighted The King afterwards going into  Flanders  against the  French  met Sir  William  at  Antwerp  where he supplied  him with several Thousands of Pounds and even mortgaged his Estate for his Royal Master's Use Such Services could not go unrewarded from so generous and so successful a Prince He made him Knight Banneret in the Field settled on him and his Heirs Lands at  Kingston  to the Value of Marks a Year and upon his Return into  England  increased them to and advanced him in Time to be Chief Baron of the Exchequer  Sir  William  died about after he had begun a Monastery here for the  Carthusians  His Son Sir  Michael  who  Richard  II was made Lord Chancellor not only finished it but founded likewise the Hospital called GOD'S HOUSE abovementioned He built moreover a stately Palace called the Duke of  Suffolk  's which Honour he obtained in Right of his Wife  Elizabeth  eldest Daughter of Sir  John Wingfield  who married the Heiress of  Gilbert Granville  Earl of  Suffolk  But the Happiness of him and his Family being now arrived to the Height set in Misfortunes for in the Year he was impeached of High Treason and fled for his Life into  France  where he died  William de la Pole  was Prime Minister to King  Henry  VI and suspected to be too familiar with his heroick Queen He was impeached by the Commons  Anno  and banished but his Head was struck off by the Management of his Enemies as soon as he set his Foot on the  French  Shore  John de la Pole  married the Sister of King  Edward  IV and so became allied to Royal Blood and by that means exposed to various Misfortunes and the famous Cardinal  Polé  who flourished in the Reign of Queen  Mary  I descended from that Marriage  Here are a great many other Hospitals besides and likewise a Workhouse and a good Freeschool  Tho' this Town and a small adjacent Territory be generally reckoned in  Yorkshire  yet 'tis really a distinct Liberty and County of itself governed by a Mayor a Sheriff Aldermen  c  The Corporation has Two Swords one a Present from King  Richard  II and the other from King  Henry  VIII one of which is on publick Occasions carried before the Mayor and a Cap of Maintenance and Oar of  Lignumvitae  as Ensigns of Honour the last being also a Badge of his Admiralty within the Limits of the  Humber    Farther East from  Hull  is a little pleasant Corporate and Mayortown called  Heydon  'tis handsome wellbuilt and hath a little Haven from the Sea which increases daily  The Sea incroaches much upon the Land on all the Shore about this Town and 'tis said that many large Fields as well as Towns which have been formerly known to have been there have been wash'd away and lost  History tells us that a Town called  Ravensburgh  stood somewhere this way and 'tis memorable for  Baliol  King of  Scotland  having set out thence to recover his Kingdom against  Bruce  and also for the Landing of  Henry  IV when Duke of  Hereford  and the Reception he met with there from the  English  Nobility against  Richard  II and yet there are no Vestigia or Traces of this Town to be now met with  The  Spurn Head  a long Promontory thrusting out into the Sea and making the North Point of  Humber  is very remarkable But I leave that till I come to the Description of the Sea Coasts I can only observe that there is nothing worth Observation upon this Side for above Miles together not a Port not a Gentleman's Seat not a Town of any Note except  Patrington  which is a very antient corporate Town and very pleasantly seated within  the Promontory and had likewise formerly a good Harbour on one Side it looks into the  Humber  and on the other over sweet delicious green Fields which renders its Situation very agreeable It is supposed to be the  Praetorium  of  Ptolemy  The  Roman  Way from the  Picts  Wall ends here as indeed it can hardly go further unless it should extend to  Kelnsey  a little Village standing at the Head of the Promontory  Spurnhead  is likewise supposed to be the  Occellum  of  Ptolemy  deriv'd from the  British  Word  Y  hell  which signifies a high Place on the Eastside of this Promontory on the  German  Sea The Villages lie very thick but I met with nothing of Note till we came up to  Hornsey  which is almost surrounded with a little Arm of the Sea The Steeple here is a notable Seamark but is much fallen into Ruin Here was a whole Street wash'd away by the Sea as 'tis said a Village called  Hide  was a little to the North as well as many other Villages on this Coast  Northwest of  Hornsey  some Distance from the Sea stands  Kilham  a Markettown in the  Woulds  but of no Note  We next come to  Burlington  or  Birdlington  a good large Markettown situate on a Creek of the Sea It is a Place of good Trade and has a safe Harbour for Ships and a good Quay to load and unload them It is much frequented by the Colliers The Harbour is made still better and yet improving by virtue of several Acts of Parliament passed for Repair of its Piers the last of which inforcing the former and supplying Defects was in Here  William  of  Newborough  a Village just by one of our Historians was a Canon Regular and resided when he fell so violently upon  Geoffrey  of  Monmouth  's History and treated him very abusively which  Leland  blames him very much for as irreverent and uncharitable to a Bishop after his Death  It seems there was a personal Enmity between  William  and some of  Geoffrey  's Family tho' the last is in no wise to be justified in some of his fictitious Assertions no more than the other is for absolutely denying there was such a Man as King  Arthur  and that the Ground at  Battle Abbey  where  Harold  was slain in fighting against the  Conqueror  always sweats Blood after Rain  The Country People told us a Story here of  Gipsies  which visit them often in a surprising Manner We were strangely amused with their Discourse at first forming our Ideas from the Word which in ordinary Signification with us denotes a Sort of str  lling Vagabonds But we were soon made to understand that the People meant by them certain Streams of Water which at different Seasons for none knows when they will happen gush out of the Earth with great Violence and Noise spouting up to a great Height being natural  Jette d' Eaux  or Fountains which afterwards joining together form little Rivers and so hasten to the Sea I had not time to examine into the Particulars and as the Irruption was not just then to be seen we could say little to it That which was most observable to us was that the Country People have a Notion that whenever those  Gipsies  or as some call them  Vipsies  break out there will certainly ensue either Famine or Plague This puts me in mind that the very same thing is said to happen at  Swintham  Bottom in  Surrey  beyond  Croydon  and that the Water gushing out of the chalky Hills about eight Miles from  Croydon  on the Road to  Ryegate  fills the whole Bottom and makes a large River running just to the Town's End of  Croydon  and then turning to the Left runs into the River which rises in the Town and so to  Cashalton  I mention it because the Country People here have exactly the same Notion that this Water never breaks out but against a Famine  and as I am sure it has not now broken out for more than Years it may for aught I know be true  Near  Burlington  stands  Flamboroughhead  a little Promontory which bends a little into the Sea and forms the Bay of  Burlington  It takes its Name from  Flam  a  British  Word for a Firelight and not far from this Promontory is a very large Ditch which some of the antient Earls of  Holderness  threw up as a Boundary to their Jurisdiction and Estate It is call'd  Earls Dyke    Humanby  stands next but is so inconsiderable that it has lost the Privilege of its Market if it ever had any  At  Lebberston  a little Village a small Way from the Sea the famous River  Derwent  takes its Rise and makes its Way West instead of running into the Sea here And here I take Leave of the  Eastriding  which is in no wise so fruitful as the other two Ridings by reason that the middle Part of it is overrun with the  Woulds  which are high Grounds barren and moorish but are however wellstock'd with Sheep yet the Eastern Part upon the Sea is fruitful and pleasant which as well as the Southern Part produces all Sort of Grain and Grass But then if you take in its Trade and Traffick it excels both the other Ridings  Scarborough  is the first Town we come to upon the Coast in the  Northriding  it is a Borough Bailiwick Town the Situation of which is perfectly romantick bending in the Form of a Crescent to the main Ocean of which you have almost an unbounded Prospect from all Parts it being built on a steep Rock and the Declivity of a lofty Hill on the Top of which stood an antient Castle founded by  William le Gros  in the Time of King  Stephen  and repaired and inlarg'd afterwards by King  Henry  II but demolished in the late Civil Wars The Summit of this  Hill contains no less than or Acres of Meadowground The Town is populous almost incompassed by the Sea and walled where it joins not to the Castle or is more strongly defended by the Sea It has one of the best Harbours in the Kingdom especially since the passing of an Act of Parliament  Anno  to inlarge its Piers and Harbour by which they have gained Feet Depth of Water which enables the Harbour to receive Vessels of greater Burden than it could do before And it is the best Place between  Newcastle  and the  Humber  capable of receiving in Distress of Weather Ships coming from the Eastern Seas along our Northern Coast  The  Spaw  Waters whose admirable Virtues yearly occasion a great Concourse of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom were first discovered by Mrs  Ferrow  about Years ago then an Inhabitant of the Place  They are reckoned Cathartick and Diuretick  much in their Nature like those of  Pyrmont  in  Germany and are apparently tinged with a Collection of Mineral Salts as of Vitriol Alum Iron and perhaps Sulphur but being deemed of the same Nature as those of  Cheltenham  in  Gloucestershire  before describ'd I refer to them  Scarborough  may be said even to rival the  Bath  itself and on several Accounts is more eligible and inviting to Strangers It is well for the  Bath  that its Seasons interfere not with theirs for it is frequented chiefly in the hot Months of the Summer  There are many new Buildings in it and more going forward so that there is now good Accommodation for great Numbers even of the highest Quality and they have Assemblies and Publick Balls in long Rooms built on purpose  The unfortunate Accident that happen'd in  December  whereby this famous  Spaw  had like to  have been lost deserves to be mentioned here Take then the Account as follows  The  Spaw  as to its Situation lay South from the Town on the Sands and fronting the Sea to the East under a high Cliff on the Back of it West the Top of the Cliff being above the Highwater Level Yards and all about a Quarter of a Mile from the Town  The Staith or Wharf adjoining to the Spawhouse was a large Body of Stone bound by Timbers and was a Fence against the Sea for the Security of the House it was Feet long and Feet high and in Weight by Computation Tons The House and Buildings were upon a Level with the Staith at the North End of which and near adjoining to it upon a small Rise above the level Sands and at the Foot of the Stairs that lead up to the Top of the said Staith and to the House were the  Spaw  Wells  On  Wednesday December  in the Morning a great Crack was heard from the Cellar of the  Spaw  House and upon Search the Cellar was found rent but at the Time no farther Notice was taken of it  The Night following another Crack was heard and in the Morning the Inhabitants were surprised to see the strange Posture it stood in and got several Gentlemen to view it who being of Opinion the House could not stand long advised them to get out their Goods but they still continued in it  On  Thursday  following between Two and Three in the Afternoon another Crack was heard and the Top of the Cliff behind it rent Yards in Length and in Breadth and was all in Motion slowly descending and so continued till dark The Ground thus rent contained about an Acre of Pastureland and had Cattle then feeding upon it and was on a Level with the main Land but sunk near Yards perpendicular The Sides of the Cliff nearest the  Spaw  stood as before but were rent and broken in  many Places and forced forwards to the Sea The Ground when sunk lay upon a Level and the Cattle next Morning were still feeding on it the main Land being as a Wall on the West and some Part of the Side of the Cliff as a Wall to the East but the Whole to View gave such a confused Prospect as could hardly be described  The Rent of the Top of the Cliff aforesaid from the main Land was Yards The Rent continued from each End down the Side of the Cliff to the Sands was measured on the Sands from one End to the other Yards  viz  South of the Staith and  Spaw  Wells and to the North of the  Spaw    As the Ground sunk the Earth or Sand on which the People used to walk under the Cliff rose upwards out of its natural Position for above Yards in Length on each Side of the Staith North and South and was in some Places six and in others seven Yards above its former Level The  Spaw  Wells rose with it but as soon as it began to rise the Water at the  Spaw  Well ceas'd running and was gone  The Ground thus risen was Yards broad the Staith which was computed at Tons rose intire and whole Feet higher than its former Position but rent a little in the Front and was forced forwards towards the Sea Yards  The most reasonable Account then given for this Phaenomenon and the Occasion of the Destruction of the Staith and  Spaw  House and the Loss for some time of the  Spaw  Spring is as follows  When this Staith or Wharf was lately rebuilt it being thrown down by the Violence of the Sea Mr  Vincent  Engineer for the building of the new Pier at  Scarborough  was desir'd to rebuild this Staith at the  Spaw  and digging a Trench to lay the Foundation thereof with great Difficulty clear'd it  of Water and when he had done it could at several Parts thereof very easily thrust his Stick or Cane up to the Handle from whence it is concluded that all the Earth under the Staith was of a porous spongy swampy Nature and was much the same below the Foundation of the  Spaw  House and all under the Sides of the Cliff adjoining as well North as South  Allowing this to be Fact the solid Earth sinking on the Top of the Cliff as aforemention'd which was of so vast a Weight as by Computation to amount to Tons pressing gradually upon and into the swampy boggy Earth beneath it would of course and did raise the Earth and Sands as before noticed and so effected the Mischief we have particulariz'd  But very luckily for the Town after a diligent Search and clearing away the Ruins as we may say they found again the  Spaw  Spring and on Trial had the Pleasure to find the Water rather better'd than impair'd by the Disaster And now the Whole is in a more flourishing Condition than ever  Here is such plenty of all Sorts of Fish that I have hardly seen the like To describe the Herring the Cod the Whiting is only to repeat what is said in other Places and what we shall have occasion to repeat more than once now we begin to go far North  We travelled a long Way from  Scarborough  before we came to the next Markettown which is  Whitby  situate at the Influx of the little River  Esk  into the Sea It has an excellent Harbour and a good Trade by Sea and 'tis said to have above Ships belonging to it Here are built a great Number of good Ships for the Coal Trade It hath a good Customhouse The Market is well furnish'd and supply'd with all Sorts of Provisions  The Harbour and Piers being somewhat decay'd they were repair'd by virtue of Two Acts of Parliament in the First and Seventh Years of Queen  Anne  and in an Act pass'd to preserve continue and keep the said Piers in Repair for ever  By means of these several Acts of Parliament the Piers of  Whitby  have been rebuilt and completed but yet for some Years past the Entrance into the Port has been rendered very narrow and difficult by reason of a Bank of Sand which has been gathering about the Head of the West Pier insomuch that it bid fair to choak up the Harbour nor could this Inconvenience be redress'd in the Opinion of the best Judges but by lengthening and extending the West Pier and its Head about Yards farther into the Sea For this Reason another Act passed in the Eighth of King  George  II for lengthening the West Pier and for improving the Harbour  At the Foot of some Rocks at this Town have been found Stones naturally as round as a Bullet which when broken stony Serpents are found in them for the most part headless look'd upon as a  Lusus Naturae    This Place was antiently called  Streanshall  and  Oswy  King of  Northumberland  held a Council here in to determine the Controversy between those who kept  Easter  after the  British  manner and those who kept it after the  Roman  manner which  Augustine  the Monk had lately introduced After the Party for the first had spoken the other answering insisted they kept  Easter  after the manner of St  Peter  on whom Christ promised to build his Church and had the Keys of Heaven Upon which the King ask'd If it was true that Christ had spoken so to St  Peter  Which the adverse Party allowing the King swore a great Oath That he would not disoblige this Porter of Heaven lest when he came to the Gates he should remember him and  so establish'd the Celebration of  Easter  after the  Roman  Manner  Near this Place are some Alum Mines belonging to her Grace the Dutchess of  Bucks  in which there is carry'd on a very considerable Trade  We inquir'd as to that strange and wonderful Phenomenon relating to the Air here which as the wild Geese fly over a Piece of Ground near this Place in hard Winters to the Lakes in the Southern Countries makes them drop down all of a sudden to the Ground and had it assur'd to us for Truth though none could assign any Reason for it  There are  Spaw  Waters at  Whitby  which have had great Reputation Several curious and antique Coins have been dug up in this Neighbourhood and a Monastery was founded here by St  Hilda  about the Year and being destroyed by the  Danes  was afterwards rebuilt the Ruins of which very considerable are still to be seen In the Month of  November  such a dreadful Storm happen'd here that the Damage to the Shipping  c  was computed at  l  Here the Coast inclines Northwest and we followed it till we came to  Gisborough  a Markettown pretty well built a little way from the Sea upon a small nameless River It is a fine and delicious Situation endued with such a grateful Variety and Advantages of Nature as renders it most delightfully pleasant a fine Scene of Verdure overspreads all the Grounds about it which are deck'd with Plenty of Fieldflowers almost all the Year round Some compare it to  Puteoli  in  Italy  but allow that it exceeds it in Healthiness It stands high and would have been incommoded with cold Breezes as it stands so Northerly from the Sea but that some Hills conveniently interfere so as to qualify the Cold  The Behaviour of the Inhabitants too participates of the Pleasantness of the Place for they are very courteous wellbred and obliging and very neat and cleanly in their Houses  Here are likewise some Alum Mines but not so considerable and easy wrought as those of  Whitby  which has taken off a great Part of that Trade from hence  This pleasant Town is the last on the Eastside towards the Sea in this  Northriding  in our Way to  Durham  It made so delightful an Impression on my Mind that I left the whole County in general but this Place and truly pleasurable Country about it in particular with Regret  And thus have I accomplish'd the third and last Part of my Proposition with respect to my Circuit through this large and far extended County and though I have been not a little circumstantial in my Accounts of it yet there are many curious Matters that still remain untouch'd and could not be brought within the Compass of an Epistolary Correspondence of this kind  But as I have given you only a Description of the County above Ground take the following Memorandums of the Treasures which are contained in its Bowels  Alum Jet or Black Amber Copperas Marble Pitcoal Lead Copper Limestone and Kelp  The first Markettown we come to in the Bishoprick of  Durham  on the Eastside is  Stockton  which lies on the Northside of the  Teis  It has risen at the Expence of  Yarum  from a poor pitiful Village with Clay Walls and Straw Covering to the Houses to a wellbuilt Corporate Town of great Resort and Business govern'd by a Mayor  c  'Tis famous for its Ale and a good Trade which it carries on in  Lead and Butter by the  Teis  with  London  which formerly was altogether at  Yarum  But this Town lying nearer the Sea and consequently more convenient has almost engross'd the whole Trade to itself  Coasting along the Seaside we come next to  Hartlepool  which is a famous corporate Mayortown and seated on a little Promontory which juts out into the Sea with which it is encompass'd on all Sides except the West The Market was much more considerable formerly than now and its chief Subsistence rises only from its good Harbour which frequently receives the Coalfleet from  Newcastle  in bad Weather  We turn'd from hence to the Left Northwest and came to  Durham  next which is a fine City pretty large compact wellcontriv'd and well situated high pleasant and healthy and surrounded almost with the River  Were  over which are two good Stone Bridges The Castle stands on an Eminence with which the River incloses the City as the Castle does also the Cathedral the Bishop's Palace and the fine Houses of the Clergy where they live in great Splendor and Magnificence All Sorts of Provisions and other Necessaries and Conveniencies for Life are very cheap as well as very good here tho' it has but one weekly Market which is kept in a large spacious Area in the Town It is govern'd by a Mayor Aldermen Recorder and Sheriffs and has six Parish Churches besides the Cathedral which is very noble and magnificent adorn'd with a high Tower which rises from the Midst of it and two Spires at the West End  Thus from a poor Oratory of wreathen Wands and Hurdles with which the indigent Monks of  Landisfarn  had first built it it is become one of the most sumptuous Buildings of the Kind in  England    and was erected out of the Offerings which were made by the superstitious Multitude at the Shrine of St  Cuthbert  And yet notwithstanding the Residence of so many dignified Protestant Clergy 'tis said there are still great Numbers of  Roman Catholicks  in this City  I need not tell you that the Bishop of  Durham  is a Temporal Prince that he keeps a Court of Equity and also Courts of Justice in ordinary Causes within himself He is still Earl of  Sadberg  and takes Place as Bishop immediately after the Bishop of  London  As the Country about  Rome  is called St  Peter  's Patrimony so that about  Durham  is St  Cuthbert  's to whom the Church is dedicated as 'tis said it was founded by the Monks of  Landisfarn David  King of  Scots  laying all Waste with Fire and Sword while King  Edward  III was at  Calais Zouch  the valiant Bishop fought the  Scots  at  Nevil's Cross  where they were cut in Pieces and their King taken Prisoner He was the sixth Bishop of  Landisfarn  or  Holy Island  from whence the See was removed hither  The Bishoprick is esteemed one of the best in  England  and the Prebends and other Church Livings in the Gift of the Bishop are the richest in the Kingdom They told me there that the Bishop had thirteen Livings in his Gift from  l  to  l  a Year and the Living of the little Town of  Sedgfield  a few Miles South of the City is said to be worth  l  a Year besides the small Tythes which maintain a Curate or might do so  This Church is very rich they have excellent Musick The old Vestments which the Clergy before the Reformation wore are still us'd on  Sundays  and other Holydays by the Residents They are so rich with Embroidery and emboss'd Work of Silver as must needs make it uneasy for the Wearers to sustain In this Cathedral lies the Body of the V  rable  Bede    One of the old Bishops of  Durham  purchased for a round Sum of Money all the Rights of the Palatinate and other Jurisdiction in this County from King  Richard  I and by his last Will left them to the succeeding Bishops But King  Henry  VIII by Act of Parliament greatly abridged the Temporal Power and Jurisdiction of this Bishoprick and King  Edward  VI or rather his Uncle  Somerset  by Act of Parliament dissolved the Bishoprick intirely but it was restored by Queen  Mary  Neither City nor County ever sent Members to the House of Commons till the Vacancy of the See by the Death of Bishop  Cosins Anno  and since they return each of them Two which is all that the County send  We took a Trip from  Durham  South to see  Bishops Auckland  which is a Markettown pleasantly seated upon a Hill in a very good Air and is noted for a most noble Palace beautified with Turrets belonging to the Bishop and also a fine Chapel founded and built by Bishop  Cosins  who reedified the Palace after the Enthusiastick Rage of the late Civil Wars had ruin'd it  Here we turn'd West and following the  Were  pass'd thro'  Wolsingham  a little Town of no Note to  Stanhop  a little Town also which had once a Market but 'tis now discontinued It is only noted for a very good Park which lies near it where King  Edward  III besieging the  Scots  in their Camp had like to have been surpris'd in his Tent by one  Douglas  an adventurous  Scot  had not the King's Chaplain defended him with the Loss of his own Life  These Western Parts of the County all to the upper Part of it are very hilly and mountainous and the Fields near them look naked and barren but the Iron Mines they produce within their Bowels make ample Amends for the Barrenness of the Surface  We return'd from these inhospitable Parts to  Durham  from whence we kept the common Road to  Chester in the Street  an old dirty thoroughfare Town void of all Remains of the Greatness which Antiquaries say were to be seen there when it was a  Roman  Colony Here is a Stone Bridge but instead of riding over it we rode under it thro' one of the Arches the Stream not being over the Horses Hoofs in Water yet on Inquiry we found that sometimes they have Use enough for it  Lumleycastle  belonging to the Earl of  Scarborough  is just on the other Side of the Road as you pass between  Durham  and  Chester  pleasantly seated in a fine Park near the East Bank of the River  Were  The Park besides the Pleasantness of it has this much more valuable Circumstance to recommend it that it is full of excellent Veins of the best Coal in the Country for the  Lumley  Coals are known for their Goodness at  London  as well as there This with a sometimes navigable River just at hand by which the Coals are carried down to  Sunderland  to the Ships makes  Lumley  Park an inexhaustible Treasure to the Family  They tell us that King  James  I lodged in this Castle at his Entrance into  England  to take Possession of the Throne and seeing a fine Picture of the antient Pedigree of the Family which carried it very far beyond what his Majesty thought credible turned this good Jest upon it to the Bishop of  Durham  who shewed it him  That indeed he did not know that  Adam  's Surname was  Lumley  before    Here we turned from the Road and crossing the  Were  followed it East to  Sunderland  a Corporate Seaport Town in the County Palatine of  Durham  populous and wellbuilt with a very handsome Church in it and tho' the River be not large it carries on a great Trade in Coals at high Water  It is a Peninsula almost surrounded by the Sea It has a very fine Church and its Rector the Rev and worthy Mr  Daniel Newcome  was the principal Architect in the building of it This Gentleman spent the greatest Part of his Income in beautifying and adorning it He began by building a Dome adjoining to the Eastend into which he removed the Altar placing it under a Canopy of inlaid Work supported in Front by Two fluted Pillars of the  Corinthian  Order with proper Capitals His Benevolence and Charity were equally extensive to all who were proper Objects of them and he delighted in doing Good This worthy Man however liv'd not to see his new Works to the Church quite completed dying very much lamented on  Jan    The Eastern Side of the County along the Sea Coast and indeed the Southern Side along the Banks of the  Teis  is very fertile and delightful thick of little Towns and Villages which are very populous and as the Mountains on the West produce Iron Mines this Side is full of those of Coals which lie so very near the Surface of the Ground that the Cart Wheels press into them  And indeed from  Durham  the Road to  Newcastle  gives a View of the inexhausted Store of Coals and Coal Pits from whence not  London  only but all the South Part of  England  is continually supplied and tho' at  London  when we see the prodigious Fleets of Ships which come constantly in with Coals we are apt to wonder how it is possible for them to be supplied and that they do not bring the whole Coal Country away yet when in this Country we see the prodigious Heaps I might say Mountains of Coals which are dug up at every Pit and how many of those Pits there are we are filled with equal Wonder to consider where the People should live that consume them  At the Mouth of the  Tyne  which parts  Durham  from  Northumberland  stands the Village of  Sheals  the Station of the Sea Coal Fleets where there have been some Marks of  Roman  Antiquity discovered not many Years since  Yarrow  noted for the Birthplace of the Venerable  Bede  stands a little higher upon the same River and upon the other Side of the  Tyne  stands  Gateshead  the Receptacle of the Coalpit Men just overagainst  Newcastle  and is supposed to have been antiently Part of it tho' divided by the River over which there is a stately Stonebridge with an Irongate in the Middle which serves as a Boundary between the Bishoprick and the County of  Northumberland    The Air in this Bishoprick is pretty cold and piercing and 'tis well for the Poor that Nature has supplied them so abundantly with Fuel for Firing and indeed all other Provisions and Necessaries are very cheap here It seems as if the whole County had been originally appropriated to Religion and War for it is full of the Ruins of Religious Houses and Castles  We are now entering into the large and extensive County of  Northumberland  which for many Ages was the Bone of Contention and Seat of War between  England  and  Scotland    Newcastle  is a large and exceeding populous Town under the Government of a Mayor Aldermen Recorder  c  and is situate between the Wall of  Severus  and the  Tyne  which becomes here a fine deep and noble River insomuch that Ships of a middling Burden may come safely up to the very Town tho' the large Colliery Ships are station'd at  Sheals  It may be consider'd as divided into Two Parts whereof  Gateshead  before spoken of on  Durham  Side is one They are both joined by the Bridge which consists of Seven Arches as large at least as those of  London  Bridge and support a Street of Houses as that does  The Liberty of the Town as it is a Corporation extends no farther than the Gate upon the Bridge which some Years since was the Preservation of it by stopping a terrible Fire that otherwise had perhaps burnt the whole Street of Houses on the City Side of the Bridge as it did those beyond it On the East Side of this Gate the Arms of the Bishop of  Durham  are carved as those of the Town of  Newcastle  are on the West Side  There is also a very noble  Exchange  here and the Wall of the Town runs parallel from it with the River leaving a spacious Piece of Ground before it between the Water and the Wall which being well wharfed up and faced with Freestone makes the longest and largest Quay for landing and lading Goods that is to be seen in  England  except that at  Yarmouth  in  Norfolk  it being much longer than that at  Bristol    Here is a large Hospital built by Contribution of the Keel Men by way of Friendly Society for the Maintenance of the Poor of their Fraternity and which had it not met with Discouragements from those who ought rather to have assisted so good a Work might have been a noble Provision for that numerous and laborious People The Keel Men are those who manage the Lighters which they call  Keels  by which the Coals are taken from the Staiths or Wharfs and carried on board the Ships at  Sheals  to load them for  London    Here are several large publick Buildings also particularly a House of State for the Mayor of the Town for the Time being to remove to and dwell in during his Mayoralty Here is also a Hall  for the Surgeons to meet in where they have Two Skeletons of human Bodies one a Man and the other a Woman and some other Rarities  And since this Work went to the Press I am inform'd that the Rev Dr  Robert Thomlinson  Rector of  Whickham  in the County of  Durham  and Prebendary of  St Paul  's gave to this Corporation a valuable Collection of Books consisting of upwards of Volumes and also settled a Rentcharge of Five Pounds  per Annum  for ever for buying new Books And  Walter Blackett    Esq  one of their Representatives in Parliament has at his own Expence built a handsome Fabrick for the Reception of those Books and settled in Mortmain a Rentcharge of  l per Annum  for ever for a Librarian  The Town is defended by an exceeding strong Wall wherein are Seven Gates and as many Turrets The Castle tho' old and ruinous overlooks the whole Town The worst is that the Situation of the Town b  ing on the Declivity of Two high Hills and the Buildings being very close and old render it incommodious to which the Smoke of the Coals contributes not a little and consequently excludes such who seek a Residence of Pleasure but then as the River which runs between the Two Hills makes it a Place of great Trade and Business that Inconvenience is abundantly recompensed  They have Two Articles of Trade here which are particularly owing to the Coals  viz  Glasshouses and Saltpans the first are in the Town the last are at  Sheals  Seven Miles below it but their Coals are brought chiefly from the Town Prodigious are the Quantities of Coals which those Salt Works consume and the Fires make such a Smoke that we saw it ascend in huge Clouds over the Hills Four Miles before we came to  Durham  which is at least Miles from the Place In short the  Town is almost surrounded with Coalpits and  London  is reckoned to take off upwards of Chaldrons yearly at Thirtysix Bushels to the Chaldron  Here I met with a Remark which was quite new to me and will be so I suppose to many others You well know we receive at  London  every Year a great Quantity of Salmon pickled or cured and sent up in the Pickle in Kits or Tubs which we call  Newcastle  Salmon In consequence of this when I came to  Newcastle  I expected to see great Plenty of Salmon there but was surprised to find it on the contrary so scarce that a good large fresh Salmon was not to be had under Five or Six Shillings Upon Inquiry I learnt that really this Salmon which we call  Newcastle  Salmon is taken as far off as the  Tweed  which is near Miles further and is brought by Land on Horses to  Sheals  where it is cured pickled and sent to  London  as above so that it is more properly  Berwick  Salmon than  Newcastle    There is but one Parochial Church called  St Nicolas  built by St  David  King of  Scotland  but several Chapels as large as Churches Here are likewise some Meetinghouses and a great many wellendowed Charityschools It is not only inriched by the Coal Trade but there are also very considerable Merchants in it who carry on Traffick to divers Parts of the World especially to  Holland Hamburgh Norway  and the  Baltick    They build Ships here to Perfection as to Strength and Firmness and to bear the Sea as the Coal Trade requires This gives an Addition to the Merchants Business it requiring a Supply of all Sorts of Naval Stores to fit out those Ships  Here is also a considerable Manufacture of Hard Ware or Wrought Iron of late Years erected after the manner of  Sheffield  which is very helpful for  imploying the Poor of which the Town has always a prodigious Number  This Town was taken and plundered by the  Scots  in the Beginning of the late Civil Wars and here it was to their eternal Reproach be it remember'd that the  Scots  perfidiously sold their King for  l  in hand and Security for  l  more after he had in Confidence intrusted himself in their Hands and without any Conditions made for him a Transaction equally detestable with that of cutting off his Head or more if possible as those who did the last were his avow'd and implacable Enemies whereas the others received him as his Friends and Protectors  On the th of  January  Part of the antient Gate leading to the  CastleGarth  fell down and tho' several Shops joined to it yet nobody receiv'd any Hurt  The Town was formerly fortify'd with a great Castle the Walls of which are still standing Its antient Name was  MonkChester  but on the building of a new Castle in the Time of  William the Conqueror  it obtain'd its present Name It enjoys great Privileges by the Favour of Queen  Elizabeth  and being one of those which are called Countytowns governs itself independently of the Lord Lieutenant  West from  Newcastle  lies the BailiwickTown of  Hexham  the  Axelodunum  of the  Romans  a Pass upon the  Tyne  famous or rather infamous for having the first Blood drawn near it in the late Civil War and where a Detachment of  English  tho' advantageously posted were scandalously defeated by the  Scots  who gain'd the Pass fought thro' the River and killed about Men the rest basely running away after which the Town of  Newcastle  was as easily seized upon without striking a Stroke  The Country round this Town is vulgarly called  Hexhamshire  It was formerly the Seat of a Bishop till  Henry  VIII annexed it to that of  Durham  Its Cathedral was stately before the  Scots  ruin'd the greatest Part of it in one of their Excursions On the other Side of the  Tyne  from  Hexhamshire  you see a House very beautifully situated belonging to the Family of  Errington  called  Bifront  and within Two Miles of  Hexham  is a fine House built by the late unfortunate Earl of  Derwentwater  called  Dilston    I was greatly tempted here to trace the famous Wall built by the  Romans  or rather rebuilt by them from hence to  Carlisle  the Particulats of which and the Remains of Antiquity seen upon it our Histories are full of I went to several Places in the Fields thro' which it passed where I saw the Remains of it some almost lost and some very visible But of this more in another Place  Northumberland  is a long coasting County lying chiefly on the Sea to the East and bounded by the Mountains of  Stainmore  on the West which are in some Places inaccessible but in many others unpassable  Here is abundant Business for an Antiquary every Place shews you ruined Castles  Roman  Altars Inscriptions Monuments of Battles of Heroes killed Armies routed and the like The Towns of  Morpeth Alnwick Warkworth Tickill  and many others shew their old Castles and some of them still in tolerable Repair  Alnwick  in particular and  Warkworth  others as  Bambrough Norham Chillingham Horton Dunstar Wark  and a great many more are sunk in their own Ruins by mere Length of Time  We had  Cheviot  Hills so plain in view that we could not but inquire of the Inhabitants everywhere whether they had heard of the Fight at  ChevyChace  they not only told us they had heard of it but had all the Account of it at their Fingers End whereupon taking a Guide at  Wooller  a small Town lying as it were under the Hills he led us on toward the Top of the Hill for by the way altho' there are many Hills and Reachings for many Miles which bear the Name of  Cheviot Hills  yet there is one of them a great deal higher than the rest which at a Distance looks like the  PicoTeneriffe  in the  Canaries  and is so high that it is plainly seen from the  Rosemary Top  in the EastRiding of  Yorkshire  which is near Miles off  We were preparing to clamber up this Hill on Foot when our Guide told us he would find a Way for us to get up on Horseback He then very artfully led us round to a Part of the Hill where in the Winterseason great Streams of Water come pouring down from it in several Chanels which were pretty broad and overgrown on each Side with Aldertrees so close and thick that we rode under them as in an Arbour In one of these Chanels we mounted the Hill as Besiegers approach a fortified Town by Trenches and were got a great way up before we were well aware of it for we were already so far advanced that we could see some of the Hills which before we thought very high lying under us as if they were a Part of the Plain below As we mounted higher we found the Hill steeper than at first and our Horses being very much fatigu'd we alighted and proceeded on Foot When we had gain'd the Top we were agreeably surprised to see a smooth and pleasant Plain half a Mile in Diameter with a large Pond in the middle of it for we had a Notion when at Bottom that the Hill narrow'd to a Point and that when we came to the Top we should be as upon a Pinacle with a Precipice every Way round us  The Day to our great Satisfaction happen'd to be very calm and so clear that we could plainly see the Smoke of the Saltpans at  Sheals  at the Mouth of the  Tyne  which was about Miles South from this We saw likewise several Hills which our Guide told us were in  England  and others in the West of  Scotland  the Names of which I have forgot Eastward we saw  Berwick  and to the North the Hills called  Soutra  Hills which are in Sight of  Edinburgh  In short we had a surprizing View of the united Kingdom and tho' all the Country round us looked very well yet it must be owned the  Scots  Side seemed the pleasantest and had the best Ground  Satisfied with this Prospect and not thinking our Time or Pains ill bestowed we came down the Hill by the same Rout we went up Our Guide afterwards carried us to a single House called  Wooller Haughhead  a much better Inn than we expected to meet with thereabouts  At this Inn we inquired after the Particulars of the famous Story of  Chevy Chase  and found that the People had the following Notion of it That it was an Inroad of the Earl of  Douglas  into  England  in order to ravage burn and plunder the Country as was usual in those Days That  Piercy  Earl of  Northumberland  march'd with his Friends and Followers to meet the  Scots  both Parties encounter'd at the Foot of  Cheviot Hills  and a bloody Battle ensued wherein both the Earls were slain desperately fighting at the Head of their Troops and so many fell on both Sides that it could not be determin'd which had the Victory  They shewed us the Place where this Battle was fought which if their Tradition does not mislead them is on the Side of the Hill near the Road It is said the  Scots  were mostly Horse and therefore the  English  Archers placed themselves on the Side of  a steep Ascent that they might not be broken in upon by them The Spots of Ground where the Two Earls are said to have fallen are distinguished by Two Stones to this Day The Fight the  Scots  call the Battle of  Otterburn  and make a very famous Story of it to the Honour of their Nation  About Six or Seven Miles from hence we saw the ever memorable  Floddenfield  where  James  IV King of  Scotland  invading  England  with a great Army when  Henry  VIII was engaged abroad in the Siege of  Tournay  was met by the gallant Earl of  Surrey  in which after a bloody Battle the  Scots  were totally defeated and their King fighting valiantly at the Head of his Nobility was slain  The River  Till  which our Historians call a deep and swift River where many of the  Scots  were drown'd in their Flight seemed to me everywhere passable with great Ease but perhaps it might at that time be swelled with some sudden Rain which the Historians ought to have taken notice of  I must not quit  Northumberland  without taking notice that the Natives of this Country of the ancient original Race or Families are distinguished by a  Shibboleth  upon their Tongues in pronouncing the Letter  R  which they cannot utter without a hollow Jarring in the Throat by which they are as plainly known as a Foreigner is in pronouncing the  Th  this they call the  Northumberland R  or  Wharle  and the Natives value themselves upon that Imperfection because forsooth it shews the Antiquity of their Blood  From hence lay a Road into  Scotland  by the Town of  Kelso  which I afterwards passed thro' but at present inclining to see  Berwick upon Tweed  we turned to the West and visited that old Frontier where is a fine Bridge over the  Tweed  built by Queen  Elizabeth  a noble stately Work consisting of Arches and joining as may be said  the Two Kingdoms The chief Trade I found here was in Corn and Salmon  I am now on the Borders of  Scotland  and must call to mind that I have not yet gone over the Western Coast of  England  viz  Lancaster Westmorland  and  Cumberland    I must needs own that since I entered upon the View of these Northern Counties I have many times regretted that my Limits forbid me often to decline the delightful View of Antiquity of which there is so great and so surprizing a Variety every Day discovered for the religious as well as military Remains of the  Britons Romans Saxons  and  Normans  like Wounds hastily healed up appear presently when the  Callus  which was spread over them is removed and though the Earth has defaced the Figures and Inscriptions upon most of these Curiosities yet they are beautiful even in their Decay and the venerable Face of Antiquity has something so pleasing so surprising so satisfactory in it especially to those who have with any Attention read the Histories of past Ages that I know nothing which renders Travelling more pleasant and more agreeable  The Description of the other Three Counties will be the Subject of my next Letter Mean time I am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  LETTER IV CONTAINING A Description of the Counties of  Lancaster Westmorland  and  Cumberland    SIR  _I Entered  Lancashire  at the remotest Western Point of that County having been at  West Chester  upon a particular Occasion and from thence ferry'd over from the  Cestrian Chersonesus  as I have already called it to  Liverpoole  This narrow Slip of Land rich fertile and full of Inhabitants tho' formerly as Authors say a mere waste and desolate Forest is called  Wirall  or by some  Wirehall  Here is a Ferry over the  Mersee  which at full Sea is more than two Miles over You land on the flat Shore on the other Side and must be content to ride thro' the Water for some Length not on Horseback but on the Shoulders of some  Lancashire  Clown who comes Kneedeep to the Boat's Side to truss one up and then runs away more nimbly than one desires to ride unless his Trot were easier  Liverpoole  is one of the Wonders of  Britain  because of its prodigious Increase of Trade and Buildings  within the Compass of a very few Years rivalling  Bristol  in the Trade to  Virginia  and the  English  Colonies in  America  They trade also round the whole Island send Ships to  Norway  to  Hamburg  and to the  Baltick  as also to  Holland  and  Flanders  so that they are almost become like the  Londoners  universal Merchants  The Trade of  Liverpoole  consists not only in Merchandizing and Correspondencies beyond Seas but as they import almost all Kinds of foreign Goods they have consequently a large Inland Trade and a great Correspondence with  Ireland  and  Scotland  for Consumption of their Goods exactly as it is with  Bristol  and they really divide the Trade with  Bristol  upon very remarkable Equalities  Bristol  lies upon the  Irish  Sea so does  Liverpoole Bristol  trades chiefly to the South and West Parts of  Ireland  from  Dublin  in the East to  Galloway  West  Liverpoole  has all the Trade of the East Shore and the North from the Harbour of  Dublin  to  Londonderry Bristol  has the Trade of  South Wales    Liverpoole  great Part of the Trade of  North Wales Bristol  has the Southwest Counties of  England  and some North of it as high as  BridgeNorth  and perhaps to  Shrewsbury    Liverpoole  has all the Northern Counties and a large Consumption of Goods in  Cheshire  and  Staffordshire  is supplied from thence  Ireland  is also shared between both and for the Northern Coast of it if the  Liverpoole  Men have not the whole Fishery or at least in Company with the Merchants of  Londonderry  the Fault is their own The Situation of  Liverpoole  is very advantageous towards improving its Commerce and extending it into the Northern Inland Counties of  England  particularly into  Cheshire  and  Staffordshire  by the new Navigation of the Rivers  Mersee  the  Weaver  and the  Dane  By the last the Merchants come so near  the  Trent  with their Goods that they make no Difficulty to carry them by Land to  Burton  and from thence correspond quite thro' the Kingdom even to  Hull  and they begin to be very sensible of the Profit of such a Commerce  It is some Advantage to the growing Commerce of this Town that the Freemen of it are in consequence of that Freedom free also of  Bristol  as they are of the Corporations of  Waterford  and  Wexford  in the Kingdom of  Ireland  Not that these Corporation Privileges are of any great Value to  Liverpoole  in its foreign Trade but in particular Cases it may be some Advantage as in Town Duties in admitting them to set up Trades in those Corporations and the like  The Town has no Fortifications either to the Land or the Sea tho' when the late Northern Insurrection reached to  Preston  the Inhabitants would have been glad of Walls and Gates and indeed had the Rebel Party had time to have advanced to  Warrington  seized the Pass there and taken  Manchester  as they would certainly have done in three Days more it would have fared but very ill with  Liverpoole  which could have made but little Resistance against an armed and desperate Body of Men besides the Rebels would have not only found the Sweets of Plunder here but Arms Ammunition Powder and Lead all which they extremely wanted They would have had Ships also to have facilitated a Communication with  Ireland  from whence Numbers would have landed if it had been only in hopes of Plunder But happy for  Liverpoole  as well as the whole Kingdom the Rebels were defeated before they proceeded so far  The Situation of  Liverpoole  being on the North Bank of the River with the Disadvantage of a flat Shore the Merchants were laid under great Difficulties in their Business for tho' the Harbour was  good and the Ships rode well in the  Offing  yet they were obliged to ride there as in a Road rather than a Harbour Here was no Mole or Haven to bring in their Ships and lay them up as the Seamen call it for the Winter nor any Quay for the delivering their Goods as at  Bristol Biddiford Newcastle Hull  and other Sea Ports Upon this the Inhabitants and Merchants by the Aid of an Act of Parliament passed in the Eighth Year of the Reign of the late Queen  Anne  which was prolonged by another passed in the Third Year of his Majesty King  George  I made a large Basin or wet Dock at the East End of the Town where at a very great Charge the Place considered they have brought the Tide from the  Mersee  to flow up by an Opening that looks to the South and the Ships go in North so that the Town shelters it from the Westerly and Northerly Winds the Hills from the Easterly and the Ships lie as in a Millpond with the utmost Safety and Convenience As this is so great a Benefit to the Town the like of which is not to be seen in any Place of  England  for the Merchants Service  London  excepted it is well worth the Imitation of many other tradeing Places in  Britain  who for want of such a Convenience lose their Trade for indeed the Inhabitants of  Liverpoole  suffered not a little for want of it in the great Storm  Anno  This Dock is capable of holding Sail of Ships  But tho' these new Works have been of such Advantage to this flourishing Town yet something more appeared wanting to crown the Work for it seems the Entrance into the Dock or Basin from the open Harbour was so streight that Ships and Vessels lying in the Dock were often hinder'd from getting out to Sea and those without the Dock in the open Harbour were frequently forced ashore and lost To remedy this Inconvenience an Act passed  Anno  for inlarging the said Entrance and for erecting  a Pier in the open Harbour on the North and South Sides of the said Entrance And as the Lives of divers Persons were endanger'd and lost and Goods often run and smuggled for want of keeping proper and sufficient Lights in the Nighttime about the said Wetdock or Basin the same Act impowers the Corporation to set up such a Number of Lamps to enlighten the Dock as they shall think requisite all which must be of the highest Benefit to this fine Town and a great Furtherance to its Trade and Navigation  The Customhouse adjoining to the Dock is also but the Work of a few Years past and is not only a commodious but an elegant Piece of Building  Liverpoole  had formerly but one Church dedicated to our Lady and St  Nicolas  and that dependent on the Parish of  Walton  but upon the Increase of Inhabitants and of new Buildings in so extraordinary a manner an Act of Parliament passed in the Tenth Year of King  William  III enabling the Corporation to build and endow a new one and to make  Liverpoole  independent of  Walton Anno  the Church of  St Peter  's on the Eastside of the Town which had been built at the Charge of the Parish to which it was appropriated was consecrated But this being still not sufficient for this flourishing Town her late Majesty Queen  Anne  in the Third Year of her Reign granted to the Corporation for Years a Lease of the Scite of  Liverpoole  Castle which had long lain in Ruins whereon to erect a third Church and other Edifices under the yearly Rent of  l    s    d  together with Liberty to use the Materials of the old Castle for that Purpose And his late Majesty King  George  I by Act of Parliament was pleased to make over to the Corporation for ever on a Reserve of the same annual Rent the said Scite of the old Castle whereon the Inhabitants erected the said third Church and in Honour to that Prince  dedicated it to St  George  It was finish'd in the Year from the Revenues arising from the CorporationLands and the Duty on Merchandize which are estimated at  l per Ann  These Churches are very handsome and capacious Buildings That on the North of the Town has in it a fine Font of Marble placed in the Body of the Church surrounded with a beautiful Iron Palisado the Gift of the late Mr  Heysham  a Merchant of  London  but considerably concerned in Trade on this Side and for many Years Member of Parliament for  Lancaster  There is a beautiful Tower to this Church and a new Ring of eight Bells  The Townhouse is a fine modern Building standing all upon Pillars of Freestone the Place under it is their  Tolsey  or Exchange for the Meeting of their Merchants but they begin to want more Room and talk of inlarging it or removing the Exchange to the other part of the Town where the Ships and Merchants Business is nearer at hand  Here is also a good Freeschool well endow'd and likewise a very noble Charityschool which was built and is supported by the generous Contributions of the Inhabitants for Boys and Girls who are maintained with Cloaths Meat and Lodging and have proper Education bestow'd upon them  Here are also several Almshouses for the Support of Sailors Widows and other old and indigent People and since the Year a Workhouse for the Poor has also been erected which by good Management has reduc'd the Poor's Rate from two Shillings in the Pound to Tenpence and they made no Doubt when I was there last that in a Year or two it would be brought under Sixpence in the Pound  It is a Corporate Town govern'd by a Mayor and Aldermen The Harbour is defended on the Southside by a Castle and the West by a Tower on the River  Mersee    In a Word there is no Town in  England  except  London  that can equal  Liverpoole  for the Fineness of the Streets and Beauty of the Buildings Many of the Houses are built of Freestone and completely finished and all the rest of the new Part I mean of Brick as handsomely built as  London  itself  Formerly  Liverpoole  was but indifferently supply'd with fresh Water but they have been for many Years well accommodated in that respect by virtue of an Act of Parliament pass'd for that Purpose in the Eighth Year of the Reign of her late Majesty Queen  Anne    I shall only add that some of the Streets are named from their Relation to the Family of the  Mores  of  Blankhall  formerly chief Lords and Owners of the greatest Part of  Liverpoole  and who first began to beautify and adorn it with fine Stone Buildings  From hence the  Mersee  opening into the  Irish  Sea we could see the great and famous Road of  Hile Lake  remarkable for the shipping off or rather Rendezvous of the Army and Fleet under King  William  for the Conquest of  Ireland Anno  for here the Men of War rode as our Ships do in the  Downs  till the Transports came to them from  Chester  and this Town  Going East we pass'd through  Prescot  a large Markettown but thinly inhabited and came to  Warrington    This is a large oldbuilt Markettown upon the River  Mersee  over which is erected a stately Stone Bridge which is the only Bridge of Communication for the whole County with that of  Chester  It is on the great Road from  London  leading to  Carlisle  and  Scotland  and in case of War has always been esteemed a Pass of the utmost Importance It was found to be so upon several Occasions in the Time of the late Civil War and had the Rebel  Scots  advanced thus far in the late  Preston  Affair so as to  have made themselves Masters of it it would have been so again and on that Account the King's Forces took special Care by a speedy Advance to secure it  Warrington  is populous and rich and full of good Country Tradesmen Here is particularly a weekly Market for Linen as I saw at  Wrexham  in  Wales  a Market for Flanel The Linen sold at this Market is generally speaking a Sort of Table Linen called  Hukabuk  It is likewise noted for excellent Malt I was told there are generally as many Pieces of this Linen sold here every Marketday as amount to  l  sometimes much more and all made in the Neighbourhood of the Place  Not far off is the Village of  Winick  fam'd for its Rectory worth about  l  a Year  From hence on the Road to  Manchester  we passed the great Bog or Waste called  Chatmoss  the first of that Kind that we saw in  England  from any of the South Parts hither It extends on the Leftside of the Road for five or six Miles East and West and they told us it was in some Places seven or eight Miles from North to South There are many of these Mosses in this County take this for a Description of all the rest  The Surface at a Distance looks black and dirty and is indeed frightful to think of for it will bear neither Horse nor Man unless in an exceeding dry Season and then so as not to be travelled over with Safety  The Surface seems to be a Collection of the small Roots of innumerable Vegetables matted together interwoven so thick as well the larger Roots as the smaller Fibres that it makes a Substance hard enough to cut out into Turf or Peat which in some Places the People pile up in the Sun and dry for their Fuel The Roots I speak of are in general small and soft not unlike the Roots of  Asparagus  or of  Bearbind  and have no Earth among them except what they contract from the Air and Dust flying in it but the Rain keeps them as it were always growing tho' not much increasing  In some Places the Surface of this is very thick in others less We saw it sometimes eight or nine Feet thick and the Water that drained from it looked clear but of a deep brown like stale Beer What Nature meant by such an useless Production is hard to imagine but the Land is intirely waste except as above for the poor Cottagers Fuel and the Quantity used for that is very small  Under the Moss or rather in the very Body of it and not here only but in several like Places perhaps in all of them those antient Firtrees are found which are so unaccountable that much Learning has been shewn to very little Purpose on this Subject for after all whatever has been said must be mere Conjecture and Uncertainty but in my weak Judgment it may be thus accounted for That Nature whose Works are all directed by a superior Hand has been guided to produce Trees here under Ground as she does in other Places above Ground that as the Trees above the Surface grow erect and high these lie prone and horizontal those shoot forth Branches and Leaves these shoot forth none yet have a Vegetation by Methods directed by Nature and particular to that Kind and 'tis remarkable that if they lie buried they will grow and increase but if you take them up and plant them in the Air they will wither and die  It is observable that these Trees are a Kind of Fir and are very full of Turpentine Whether there is any Tar in them I am not positive but I suppose there is and yet I do not see that for this Reason they should not be a natural ordinary Product as other Vegetables are  As to their being brought hither by the general Convulsion of the Globe at the Deluge the Thought is so repugnant to common Sense that I think it neither needs nor deserves any other Notice  From hence we came on to  Manchester  one of the greatest if not really  the  greatest mere Village in  England  It is neither a Town City nor Corporation nor sends Members to Parliament The highest Magistrate is a Constable or Headborough and yet it has a Collegiate Church takes up a large Space of Ground and including the Suburbs or that Part of the Town on the other Side of the Bridge it is said to contain above People  The Increase of Buildings at  Manchester  within these few Years is a Confirmation of the Increase of People for here as at  Liverpoole  and as at  Froom  in  Somersetshire  the Town is extended in a surprising Manner abundance of newbuilt Streets are added as also a new Church dedicated to St  Anne  and they talk of founding another and a fine new Square by which means the Town is almost double to what it was some Years ago  So that you have here an open Village which is greater and more populous than many nay than most Cities in  England  Neither  York Lincoln Chester Salisbury Winchester Worcester Gloucester  nor  Norwich  itself can come up to it and for lesser Cities two or three put together would not equal it such as  Peterborough Ely  and  Carlisle  or such as  Bath Wells  and  Litchfield  and some others  The Town of  Manchester  boasts of Four extraordinary Foundations a College an Hospital a Freeschool and a Library all very well supported  The College was the Charity of  Thomas West  Lord  Delaware  who being but the Cadet of the Family was bred a Scholar took Orders and became Rector of the Parish which he enjoyed many Years but by the Decease of his elder Brother without  Heirs succeeding to his Honour and Estate he founded the College in the Year The Pope in Consideration that the Family was likely to be extinct is said to have allowed him to marry on his performing so beneficial a Penance It was dedicated to the Virgin  Mary  and the two Patron Saints of  France  and  England  St  Denys  and St  George    This Foundation escaping the general Ruin under  Henry  VIII was dissolved in the first Year of King  Edward  VI After this it was refounded by Queen  Mary  and then anew by Queen  Elizabeth Anno  by the Name of  Christ's Church  in  Manchester  and last of all it was refounded by King  Charles  I  Anno  consisting then of one Warden four Fellows two Chaplains four Singing Men and four Choristers incorporating them as they were by Queen  Elizabeth  by the Name of the Wardens and Fellows of  Christ's Church  in  Manchester  the Statutes for the same being drawn up by Archbishop  Laud    The Visitor of this Collegiate Church is the Bishop of  Chester  and his late Majesty King  George  I haveing made Dr  Peploe  Bishop of  Chester  who at the same time was Warden of the Church the Visitatorial Power and the Wardenship being incompatible an Act passed  Anno  impowering his Majesty to be the Visitor whensoever the Warden of  Manchester  happened to be Bishop of  Chester    The  Hospital  was founded by  Humphrey Chetham    Esq  and incorporated by King  Charles  II designed by the said bountiful Benefactor for the Maintenance of poor Boys out of the Town and Parish of  Manchester  and some other neighbouring Parishes but it is inlarged since to the Number of by the Governors of the said Hospital who have improved the Revenues of it  The said Founder also erected a very fair and spacious Library which is furnished with a competent Stock  of choice and valuable Books and daily increasing with the Income of  l per Annum  settled to buy Books for ever and to afford a competent Salary for a Librarykeeper There is also a large School for the Hospital Boys where they are daily instructed and taught to read and write  The Publick School was founded  A D  by  Hugh Oldham  D D Bishop of  Exeter  and the Revenues left by him are of late very much increased and the School has been suitably improved from them  Besides these publick Benefactions and Endowments there have been several other considerable Sums of Money and annual Revenues left and bequeathed to the Poor of the said Town who are thereby with the Kindness and Charity of the present Inhabitants competently provided for without starving at Home or being forced to seek Relief Abroad  As for the Antiquity of the Place it is the  Mancunium  of the  Romans  and what is now called  Knockcastle  was the Scite of the  Roman Castrum  and many Antiquities have been found here The Foundation of the Castle Wall and Ditch still remain in  Castlefield  as some time called  The new Church I have mentioned was finished about the Year by voluntary Subscriptions the Choir is Alcovefashion and the Pilasters painted of  Lapis Lazuli  Colour The old Church is very large and has Three Rows of neat Pillars They have Looms that work Laces at a time an Invention they borrow'd from the  Dutch  For the Space of Three Miles upwards they have no less than Watermills The Town stands chiefly on a Rock and across the River the large Town as it may be called is named  Salthorp    The Antiquity of the Manufacture is indeed worth taking notice of which tho' we cannot trace  it by History we have reason to believe began something earlier than the Woollen Manufactures in other Parts of  England  of which I have spoken so often because the Cotton might itself come from the  Mediterranean  and be known by Correspondents in those Counties when that of Wool was not pushed at because our Neighbours wrought the Goods and tho' they bought the Wooll from  England  yet we did not want the Goods whereas without making the Cotton Goods at Home our People could not have them at all and that Necessity which is the Mother of Invention might put them upon this and without such Necessity Ignorance and Necessity prevented the other  The River  Irwell  runs close by  Manchester  and receives the little River  Irke  just above on the North and Northeast Side There is a very firm but antient Stone Bridge over the  Irwell  which is built exceeding high because this River tho' not great yet coming from the mountainous Part of the Country swells sometimes so suddenly that in one Night's time they told me Waters would frequently rise Four or Five Yards and the next Day fall as hastily as they rose  About Eight Miles from  Manchester  Northwest lies  Bolton  We saw nothing remarkable in it but that the Cotton Manufacture reached hither tho' the Place did not like  Manchester  seem increasing  Here the old Earl of  Derby  was beheaded  Oct  for proclaiming King  Charles  II  As I have noted above we turned East here and came to  Bury  a small Markettown on the River  Roch  which is the utmost Bound of the Cotton Manufacture which flourishes so well at  Manchester  c And here the Woollen Manufacture of coarse Sorts called  Halfthicks  and  Kersies  begins which imploys this and all the Villages about it  From thence we went to  Rochdale  a Markettown of good Traffick a larger and more populous Town than  Bury  it lies under the Hills called  Blackstone Edge  which having mentioned at my Entrance this Way into  Yorkshire  I must now go back again to the Sea Coast for I took my Course that Way up to  Preston  and  Lancaster  in this Journey having travelled thus far from  Liverpoole  in my former Journey to  Halifax  c But must first observe that there are on this Eastern Side of the County Northward of  Rochdale  the Towns of  Haslington Burnley  and  Coln  which lie just under the Mountains and likewise  Blackburn  and  Clithero  a little West of them all which being merely Markettowns and of no other Note I shall say no more of them other than that  Clithero  stands upon the  Ribble  and is the most considerable and that at  Coln  and  Burnley  have been discovered a great many  Roman  Coins  I take  Wigan  first in my Way back to the Sea Coast it lies on the high Postroad to  Lancaster  This Town has a good Market and is noted for its Manufacture in Coverlids Rugs Blankets and other Sort of Bedding Furniture and likewise for Pitcoal and Ironwork  Between  Wigan  and  Bolton  in the Estate of Sir  Roger Bradshaw  is found great Plenty of what they call  Canel  or  Candle Coal  the like of which is not to be seen in  Britain  or perhaps in the World By putting a lighted Candle to them they are presently in a Flame and yet hold Fire as long as any Coals whatever and burn more or less as they are placed in the Grate flat or edgewise They are smooth and sleek when the Pieces part from one another and will polish like Alabaster A Lady may take them up in a Cambrick Hankerchief and they will not soil it tho' they are as black as the deepest Jet They are the most pleasant and agreeable Fuel  that can be found but are so remote from  London  that the Carriage makes them too dear for common Use We saw some of them at  Warrington  too but all from the same Pits  I must not pass over the  Burning Well  as it is called near  Wigan  the Account of which take in the Words of Mr  Camden  's Continuator  "Within a Mile and a half of  Wigan  is a Well which does not appear to be a Spring but rather Rainwater at first Sight There is nothing about it that seems extraordinary but upon emptying it there presently breaks out a sulphureous Vapour which makes the Water bubble up as if it boiled a Candle being put to it it presently takes Fire and burns like Brandy the Flame in a calm Season will continue a whole Day by the Heat whereof they can boil Eggs Meat  c  tho' the Water itself be cold By this Bubbling the Water does not increase but is only kept in Motion by the sudden  Halitus  of the Vapours breaking out The same Water taken out of the Well will not burn as neither the Mud upon which the  Halitus  has beat"  Dr  Leigh  in his  Natural History of  Lancashire not only describes it but accounts very judiciously for the Thing itself and by it for the Warmth of all hot Baths  On the same Road a little South stands  Newton  which had once a Market but is now difused It is only noted for a very eminent Charityschool founded in by one  Hornby  a Yeoman of the same Place The poorer Sort of Children are taught to read write and cast Accounts and have Dinners every Schoolday besides There are also Ten Boys and Ten Girls who lodge in an Hospital contiguous to the School where they are provided with all other Necessaries till Years old The Fund for this  Charity was  l  A large Sum for a Yeoman to give  From hence we passed to  Ormskirk  West towards the Seacoast It is a Markettown that has a good Inlandtrade but we saw nothing remarkable here but the Monuments of some of the antient Family of the  Stanleys  before they were ennobled And here they still continue to bury the Family whose Seat is called  Latham  not far from this Town to which belongs a very large Estate and a fine Park  Latham  House is noted for having been gallantly defended in the late Civil Wars by a Woman the Lady  Charlotte  Countess of  Derby  who held it to the last Extremity against the Parliament Forces which could never reduce her to capitulate but kept the Place gloriously till she was relieved by Prince  Rupert  It was however ruined in a second Siege and is now sold out of the Family and in Possession of  Thomas Bootle    Esq  who is building a magnificent House there  Fernby  a Village lies near the Seaside in the marshy Grounds where they dig Turf that serves both for Fire and Candle These marshy Grounds extend a great Way North up beyond  Eccleston  and almost up to  Preston  On the Edge of it Eastward is  Marton Mere  which has been very large but much of it is now drained  Eccleston  is a Markettown where nothing remarkable is to be seen Nor at  Charley  a Town of the same Kind which lies a little Northeast of it  Preston  stands next a corporate Mayor Town having Three weekly Markets well supplied and frequented It is a large fine Town situated on the  Ribble  it is pretty full of People but not like  Liverpoole  or  Manchester  for we now come beyond the trading Part of the County But tho' there is no Manufacture the Town being honoured with the  Court of Chancery  and the Officers of Justices for  Lancaster  is full of Gentlemen Attorneys Proctors and Notaries the Process of Law being here of a different Nature from that in other Places by reason that it is a Duchy and County Palatine and has particular Privileges of its own The People are gay here tho' not perhaps the richer for that but it has on this Account obtained the Name of  Proud Preston  Here is a great deal of good Company but not so much they say as was before the late bloody Action with the Northern Rebels not that the Battle hurt many of the immediate Inhabitants but the Consequences of it so severely affected many Families thereabout that they still retain the Remembrance of it  Not far from  Preston  is  Ribchester  supposed to be the  Bretonomacum  of the Antients a Town which in its flourishing State was said to be the richest in  Christendom  So many Pieces of Antiquity have been dug up in its Neighbourhood that it was most probably a Place of great Importance among the antient  Romans    Between the  Ribble  and a little River some Miles South of  Lancaster  the Land elbows out in the Form of a Semicircle into the Sea and this Tract they call the  Fieldlands  in which is a small Markettown called  Kirkham  only remarkable for a good Freeschool which has Three Masters  Poulton  is another Markettown in the same Tract very convenient in its Situation for Trade being near the Mouth of the River  Wire  We followed the Postroad and passed through  Garstang  which stands upon it about Midway between  Preston  and  Lancaster  and is of no other Note than having a Market and so leaving  Wiredale  Forest on our Right we arrived at  Lancaster  the County Town situate near the Mouth of the River  Lone  or  Lune  The Town is antient and has little else to recommend it than that and to have given Title to many Branches of  the Royal Family of  England  It has a decayed Castle and a more decayed Port not capable of receiving Ships of any considerable Burden The Bridge has Five Arches and is handsome and strong but here is little or no Trade and few People It surprised me to hear that there are not above Parishes in all this large County but many of them are consequently very large and there are above Chapels of Ease no less than of which are in one Parish  The Castle of  Lancaster  is now the County Gaol and the Assizes are held in it The Town has only one Parish Church which is fair and spacious  It is governed by a Mayor  c  to whom  Edw  III granted the Privilege That Pleas and Sessions in the County should be held nowhere but at  Lancaster  It is the  Longovicum  of the  Romans  who have had a Station here On the steepest Side of the Hill below the Church hangs a Piece of a  Roman  Wall called  Werywall  derived as  Camden  thinks from the  British  Word  Caerwirdd  a green City from the Verdure of the Hills  As we came along the Seaside we observed a Kind of strange Crows whose Bodies are blue and Heads and Wings black  Not far from  Lancaster  at the Foot of a high Hill called  Warton Crag  on the Top of which is a Beacon stands an agreeable little obscure Town named  Warton  upon the Side of a Lake where is a good Grammarschool with Accommodations and a Library for the Benefit of the Masters which together with an Hospital for Six poor Men was founded and endowed by Dr  Hutton  then Bishop of  Durham  in who was afterwards translated to  York  which certainly must have been then a Bishoprick of very great Value to have induced him to quit  Durham  for it notwithstanding its being an Archbishoprick and the Title of  Grace  annexed to its Prelate Here is also a very neatbuilt Church  Higher up North towards the Extremity of the County next  Westmorland  is  Hornby  Castle upon the River  L  n  which is an excellent Building the Seat of the Lords of  Monteagle  a Branch of the  Stanleys  and since of the  Parkers  one of whom marrying into that Family had in King  James  I's Time the same Title conferr'd on him and 'twas this Nobleman who discover'd the Powderplot  This Part of the Country seemed very strange and dismal to us after coming from the Southside which is so rich and fertile that it is noted for shewing the largest Breed of Cows and Oxen in the Kingdom whose Bulk as well as Horns are of such a Magnitude as is very astonishing besides their fine spotted Deer which are said to be peculiar to that Part of the County  Here among the Mountains our Curiosity was frequently moved to inquire what high Hill this was or that and we soon were saluted with that old Verse in  Camden    Ingleborough Pendlehill  and  Penigent  Are the highest Hills between  Scotland  and  Trent  Indeed they were all in my Judgment of a stupendous Height but in a Country all mountainous and full of high Hills it was not easy for a Traveller to judge which was highest  As these Hills were lofty so they had an Aspect of Terror Here were no rich pleasant Valleys between them as among the  Alps  no Lead Mines and Veins of rich Ore as in the  Peak  no Coalpits as in the Hills about  Halifax  but all barren and wild and of no Use either to Man or Beast Indeed here were formerly as far back as the Time of Queen  Elizabeth  some Copper Mines and they wrought them to good Advantage but whether the Vein of Ore failed or what else was the Reason  we know not but they are all given over long since and this Part of the Country yields little or nothing at all  West of  Hornby  Castle is a considerable Tract of Ground which is Part of this County and runs North parallel with the Westside of  Westmorland  and the Westside of  Cumberland  and on the South it runs out in a Promontory into the Sea it is called  Fourness  We passed over the Sands into it which are very dangerous and unpassable without Guides who are kept here for that Purpose at the Expence of the Government It contains besides Villages Four Markettowns called  Cartmel Dalton Ulverston  and  Howkshead  but are of no great Note It is very mountainous and full of Lakes or Meres the largest is  Winander Mere  which makes the utmost Northern Bound of this Tract of Ground as of this Shire It is famous for producing the Charfish seldom found unless it be at  Ulleswater  bordering on  Westmorland  and in  NorthWales  as I have mention'd before It is a curious Fish and as a Dainty is potted and sent far and near by way of Present It must needs be a great Rarity since the Quantity they take even here is but small Mr  Camden  's Continuator calls it very happily the  Golden Alpine Trout  This Mere is Miles in Circumference in Length and Two in Diameter and the Bottom is paved as it were with one continued Rock  Lancashire  as has been said is a County Palatine and was wont to give Title of Duke to a Branch of the Royal Family and till the Two Roses the White and Red were united in the Marriage of  Henry  VII of the  Lancaster  Line with  Elizabeth  Heiress of the House of  York  these Two Branches of the Royal Family by their different Pretensions to the Crown gave Occasion to the Wars and Confusions which for many Years made  England  a Scene of  Blood and Desolation Three successive Princes  Hen  IV V and VI were of the  Lancaster  Line and the latter lost his Crown and Life as did his princely Son to  Edward  IV of the House of  York  whose Two Sons being murder'd by their Uncle  Richard  III and he himself killed at  Bosworthfield  the  Lancaster  Line was again restored in  Henry  VII who married the Heiress of the House of  York  as has been said  Lancashire Witches  are so much a Phrase that I have reserved to this Place to mention that an Act passed the th of his present Majesty King  George  II to rescue those poor old Creatures who by the Ignorance and Superstition of the rustick Rabble were styled Witches from the Terror of the Laws which tho' in some sort looked upon as obsolete were nevertheless in Force against them and had given too much Occasion till within these few Years past that the Tryal and Acquittal of  Jane Wenman  as I have mentioned in  p    Vol  II discouraged the wild Fury and superstitious Ignorance of the Vulgar for persecuting poor Wretches whose Age and Infirmities as well as miserable Poverty were enough one would have thought to intitle them to Pity rather than to the barbarous Usage they were wont to meet with  This Act repeals the Statute made in the First Year of the Reign of that Witchmaking Prince  'Tis well known that this Act was  ssed in Compliment to the King's Opinion of Devils and Witch  and to the Book he wrote intitled  Demonology    King  James  I who shew'd himself no more in this than in other Actions of his Life a Conjurer intitled  An Act against Conjuration Witchcraft and dealing with evil and wicked Spirits  and also repeals an Act of the Parliament of  Scotland Anents Witchcrafts  c  And here we may be allowed to give a Caution to many of our fair Readers as well as to the lower Class of Fortunecasters by Coffeegrounds  c  For by this Act Persons pretending to tell Fortunes  and to discover lost or stollen Goods by virtue of any occult Art or Science shall be imprisoned a Year and once every Quarter of that Year be pillory'd and oblig'd to find Security for their good Behaviour at the Pleasure of the Court in which Conviction shall pass And here let me be further indulged to observe that certain married Ladies who may incur the Penalty of this Act may be still worse off than Maidens because perhaps their Husbands can the least of all others be expected to be bound for their requisite  good Behaviour    I now enter'd  Westmorland  a County eminent only for being the wildest most barren and frightful of any that I have passed over in  England  or in  Wales  The West Side which borders on  Cumberland  is indeed bounded by a Chain of almost unpassable Mountains which in the Language of the Country are called  Fells  and these are called  Fourness Fells  from the Promontory which I just mentioned and an Abbey built also in antient Times called  Fourness  The whole County is divided into the Barony of  Kendal  which is very mountainous and in the Diocese of  Chester  and the Barony of  Westmorland  a large champaign Country in the Diocese of  Carlisle    It must be owned however that here are some very pleasant manufacturing Towns and consequently populous  The Manufacture in which the People are imployed are chiefly Woollen Cloths especially at  KirkbyLonsdale  and  Kendal    Kendal  is a rich and populous Town has a Freeschool well endow'd and drives a great Trade in Woollen Cloth Cottons Druggets Serges Hats and Stockens  Over the River  Ken  whereon  Kendal  stands are Two Bridges of Stone and another of Wood At  some small Distance from the last are to be seen the Ruins of a Castle which was the Birthplace of  Catharine Parr  the Sixth Wife of  Henry  VIII The Church is fair and spacious and there are Two Chapels of Ease to it Near the Churchyard stands a fair publick School whence a certain Number of Scholars are elected to  Queen'scollege Oxon  It gives Title of Duchess to  Erengard Schulemberg  a Lady of prime Consequence in the Reign of King  George  I  Lonsdale  or  KirkbyLonsdale  is a large Town has a fair Church Stone Bridge and a good Trade for Cloth and gives Title of Viscount to the noble Family of  Louther    The Upper or Northern Part of the County has Two manufacturing Towns called  KirkbyStephen  and  Appleby  the last is the Capital of the County has a Freeschool and Hospital and is the only Town in the County that sends Members to Parliament A great Manufacture of Yarn Stockens is carried on at  KirkbyStephen    My Lord  Lonsdale  of the Family of  Louther  had a very noble and antient Seat at  Louther  and upon the River  Louther  which all together add a Dignity to the Family and are Tests of its Antiquity The House was beautiful but the Stables were the Wonder of  England  being esteemed the largest and finest that any Nobleman or Gentleman in  Britain  is Master of and his Lordship breeds as good Running Horses and Hunters as most in  England  But the House was of late unfortunately burnt down and all its fine Pictures and Furniture consumed and is not yet rebuilt  Near the River  Louther  is a Spring which ebbs and flows several times in a Day  In this County the noble Family of  Wharton  had their Seat in a Place of the same Name  When we enter'd at the South Part of this County I began indeed to think of  Merionethshire  and the  Mountains of  Snowden  in  North Wales  seeing nothing round me in many Places but unpassable Hills whose Tops covered with Snow seemed to tell us all the pleasant Part of  England  was at an End The great  Winander Mere  extending itself like a Sea on the West Side from  North Bridge  on the South where it contracts itself again into a River up to  Gresemere  North and is the Boundary of the County as I have said on that Side and the  English Apennines  as Mr  Camden  calls the Mountains of  Yorkshire  Northriding lie like a Wall of Brass on the other and indeed in the most literal Sense they are so for it is the Opinion of the most skilful and knowing People in the County that they are full of inexhaustible Mines of Copper which is convertible into Brass and a Quantity of Gold in them also nay of late Years they worked at some Copper Mines here but the Ore lies so deep and is so hard to come at that they did not seem to go chearfully on  But notwithstanding the terrible Aspect of the Hills when we had passed by  Kendal  and descended from the frightful Mountains the flat Country began to shew itself and we soon found the North and Northeast Part of the County to be pleasant rich fruitful and if compared to the other Part may be said to be populous The River  Eden  the last River of  England  on this Side as the  Tyne  is on the other rises in this Part out of the Side of a prodigious high Mountain called  Mowill Hill  or  Wildbore Fell  which you please after which it runs thro' the Middle of this Vale which as I said before is a very agreeable and pleasant Country or perhaps seems to be so the more in Comparison with the horrid Height and Narrowness of the Eastern and Southern Parts An Act passed some Years ago to make this River navigable in which the neighbouring Country find great Advantage  In the Vale and on the Bank of this River stands  Appleby  or  Apulby  the  Abalaba  of the Antients once a flourishing City now a scattering decayed and halfdemolished Town the fatal Effects of the antient Inroads of the  Scots  who used to make frequent Incursions on this County and became several times Masters of this Town and at length burnt it to the Ground a Blow it has not yet recovered  There are not many Seats of the Nobility in this Part tho' several antient Families receive their Names from hence as  Strickland  from the Lands of  Strickland Wharton  now extinct from  Whartonhall Louther  from the River  Louther Warcop  of  Warcop Langdale  of  Langdale Musgrave  from  Musgrave  c  The  Roman  Highway which I have so often mentioned and which in my last Letter I left at  Leeminglane  and  Peersbridge  in the Northriding of  York  enters this County from  Rearcross  or  Reecross  upon  Stanmore  and crossing it almost due East and West goes through  Appleby  passing the  Eden  a little North from  Perith  at an antient  Roman  Station called  Brovoniacum  where was a large and stately Stone Bridge but now the great Road leads to the Lefthand to  Perith  in going to which we first pass the  Eden  at a very good Stone Bridge called  Louther Bridge  and then the  Elnot  over another  Perith  or  Penrith  called by the  Romans Verterae  is a handsome Markettown populous and wellbuilt and for an Inland Town has a very good Share of Trade It was unhappily possessed by the late Party of  Scots  Highland Rebels when they made that desperate Push into  England  which ended at  Preston  In the Moor or Heath on the North Part of this Town the Militia of the County making a brave Appearance and infinitely outnumbering the Highlanders were drawn up yet with their  usual  Bravery they ran away as soon as the  Scots  began to advance to charge them and never  fired a Gun leaving the Town at their Mercy However to do Justice to the Rebels they offered no Injury to the Town only quartered in it one Night took what Arms and Ammunition they could find and advanced towards  Kendal    In  Westmorland  not far from the River  Louther  is a Row of Pyramidal Stones Eight or Nine Feet high pitch'd directly in a Row for a Mile together and placed at equal Distances from each other  From hence in one Stage thro' a Country full of Castles for almost every Gentleman's House is a Castle we came to  Carlisle  a small but well fortified City the Frontier Place and Key of  England  on the West Sea as  Berwick  upon  Tweed  is on the East in both which there have been for many Years I might say Ages strong Garisons kept to check the invading  Scots  From below this Town the famous  Picts  Wall began which crossed the whole Island to  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  which was built upon the following Occasion  When the  Romans  settled here by Force of Arms they were always harass'd by the  Picts  on the Side of  Scotland  To stop their Inroads the Emperor  Adrian  caused a Wall of Earth to be built extending from the  German  to the  Irish  Sea the Space of Miles or  French  Leagues and caused it to be palisado'd  Anno    Severus  the Emperor built it up of Stone with Turrets from Mile to Mile and kept a Garison therein But the  Picts  nevertheless broke in thro' this Wall more than once At last  Aetius  a  Roman  General rebuilt it of Brick in but 'twas not long before it was pulled down by the  Picts  It was Eight Feet thick and Feet high from the Ground some Part of it is still to be seen both in  Northumberland  and  Cumberland    Here also the great  Roman  Highway just before named has its End this being the utmost Station of the  Roman  Soldiers on this Side  But before I go on to speak of  Carlisle  I must return to the Sea Coast which in this Northern County is more remarkable than that of  Lancashire  tho' the other is extended much farther in length for here are some Towns of good Trade whereas in  Lancashire Liverpoole  excepted there is nothing of Trade to be seen upon the Coast  The first Place I shall mention is  Ravenglass  in the South End of the County which runs between  Fourness  and the Sea 'Tis a wellbuilt Sea Port and Markettown upon the River  Esk  and on each Side of it run down to the Sea two other small Rivers which together with the Sea make a good Harbour for Ships and surrounds three Parts of the Town which occasions a pretty good Trade to it  The Cape or Headland of  St Bees  deriv'd from St  Bega  an  Irish  Female Saint still preserves its Name  In the Town is a very good Freeschool founded by Archbishop  Grindal  who was born here It was very well endowed by him and the Charity much increased by the late Dr  Lamplugh  Archbishop of  York  Dr  Smith  Bishop of  Carlisle  Sir  John Louther  and others  The Library annexed to this Foundation is very valuable and still increasing by several Gifts daily added to it Tho' the Parish is vastly large the Vicarage is very poorly endowed  Near  St Bees  stands a little Markettown call'd  Egremont  noted only for its antient Castle and Barons and for losing their Privilege of returning Members  Under this Shore higher up North and near the Cape is the Town of  Whitehaven  grown up by the Encouragement of the  Louther  Family from a small Place to be very considerable by the Coal Trade which is so much increased of late that it is the most eminent Port in  England  for it next  Newcastle    for the City of  Dublin  and all the Towns of  Ireland  on that Coast and some Parts of  Scotland  and the  Isle of Man  are wholly supply'd from hence 'Tis frequent in time of War or upon Occasion of cross Winds to have Sail of Ships at a time go from this Place to  Dublin  loaden with Coals And Sir  James Louther  particularly is said to send from hence to  Ireland  annually as many Coals as bring him in near  l  a Year  This Increase of Shipping has led them on to Merchandizing but the Town is but of few Years standing in Trade for Mr  Camden  does not so much as name the Place and his Continuator says very little of it  And indeed the Town must be allow'd to owe principally its flourishing Condition to Two Acts of Parliament one of the th the other of the th of Queen  Anne  by virtue of which the Harbour was so considerably deepened and improved and such strong and substantial Moles and Bulwarks erected that Ships which before were liable to be driven and cast away on the Rocks and Shoals on that Coast could lie in Safety and be secure from the Violence of the Sea The happy Success of these Works encourag'd the Town to apply to Parliament for Powers still farther to improve the good Design that so by inlarging the Moles and Works and extending them to Lowwater Mark such Depth might be obtained that the largest Ships belonging to the Town might sail in and out of the Harbour at Neap Tides and that other Ships frequenting these Seas might sail in at Halfflood And accordingly an Act passed for this laudable Purpose in the Self which will prebably effectuate these good Ends and not only preserve the Lives of many Mariners but still further improve the Trade and Navigation of this already flourishing Town The same Act provides likewise for the Repair of the Roads about and  leading to  Whitehaven  which were become ruinous and bad by the great Use made of them since the Improvements made in the Harbour for before that they were very narrow and seldom made use of by Carts and Wheelcarriages All these Advantages and Increase of Trade have occasion'd a new Church to be lately built at  Whitehaven  Here is likewise a good Trade for Salt  Still a little higher to the North is  Moresby  where 'tis supposed has been a  Roman  Fort there appearing a great many Ruins of Fortifications along the Sea Coast and other Antiquities  About ten Miles Northeast from  Whitehaven  lies  Cockermouth  between two Hills upon the little River  Cocker  just where it falls into the  Derwent  and is almost incompassed by the Two Rivers The former runs thro' it and is joined again by Two Bridges It is a Town of good Trade and wellbuilt It has a Castle on one Hill and a fair Church on the other It is about Miles from the Sea and Vessels of good Burden may securely come up to it The  Derwent  is famous for its springing out of those Hills called  Derwent Fells  where the antient Copper Mines were found in Queen  Elizabeth  's Time and in which it was said there was a large Quantity of Gold But they are discontinued since some say because Gold being found among the Ore the Queen claimed the Royalty and so nobody would work them but this is rather a Reason why they should have applied to the Search with more Vigour therefore the more probable Cause is that the Charge of working them was too great for the Profits  A little East of  Cockermouth  stands  Keswick  a little Markettown in Decay inhabited chiefly by Miners who have their Smeltinghouses here there being near this Place Mines of Blacklead which turn to very good Account and I think are the only Mines of the kind in  Britain    Here we saw  Skiddaw  which is there reported to be the highest Hill in  England  It seems the higher because it is not surrounded with other Mountains like most of other Counties as at  Cheviot Penigent  and other Places From the Top of  Skiddaw  one sees plainly into  Scotland  and quite into  Dumfriesshire  and farther  The Duke of  Somerset  is chief Lord of  Cockermouth  in Right of his late Duchess the only Heiress of the antient Family of the  Piercies  Earls of  Northumberland    The Castles and great Houses of this Estate fall to Ruin as indeed all the Castles in this County do for the two Kingdoms being now united into one strong Holds are of no more Use here than in any other Part of the Kingdom I think they told us the Duke has no less than Castles in this County and in  Northumberland    This  Derwent  is noted for Trout and also for very good Salmon which from  Workington  a Fishingtown at the Mouth of this River they carry fresh as they take them up to  London  upon Horses which changing often go Night and Day without Intermission and as they say outgo the Post so that the Fish come very sweet and good to  London  where the extraordinary Price they yield from two Shillings and Sixpence to four Shillings  per  Pound pays very well for the Carriage They do the same from  Carlisle    Jerby  now a considerable Markettown stands Northeast of  Cockermouth  It is supposed to be the  Arbeia  of the Antients  From the Mouth of the  Derwent  to that of the  Elen  is supposed to have been fortified by the  Romans  to prevent the Landing of the  Scots  and  Irish  who infested these Coasts for here have been several Ruins of Fortifications discovered and some of them since  Camden  's Time At  Elenborough  'tis said the  first Cohort of  Dalmatians  were garison'd where are great Remains of them still to be seen old Vaults open'd Altars Stones and Statues with Inscriptions dug up on them And at  Wigton  a small Markettown further North in the Forest of  Allerdale  are several Altars pitch'd which they say were brought from  Elenborough  and old  Carlisle  But if I was to dwell upon Antiquities I should find Work enough in this County and therefore must refer you to such Writers as have treated of them  In  Whitfield  Park at the Borders of this County they shew you a  Hawthorn  Tree against which the Heads of a Stag and a Dog were formerly nailed up in Memory of a famous Chace It seems the Dog not a Greyhound as Mr  Camden  's Continuator calls it but a stanch Buckhound singly chased a Stag from this Park as far as the  Red Kirk  in  Scotland  which they say is sixty Miles at least and back again to the same Place where being both spent the Stag exerting his last Force leap'd the Park Pales and died on the Inside the Hound attempting to leap after him had not Strength enough to get over and fell back and died on the Outside just opposite The Heads of both were nailed upon the Tree and underneath this Distich on them The Hound's Name it seems was  Hercules  Hercules  kill'd HartaGreese  And HartaGreese kill'd  Hercules  In the same Park were three Oak Trees which were called  the Three Brether  the least of which was Yards about but two of them being quite gone and only the Stump of the other remaining I did not think it worth my Time to visit such a decayed Curiosity  West of the  Hawthorn  Tree and upon the old  Roman  Way is the famous Column called the  Countess Pillar  the best and most beautiful Piece of its  Kind in  Britain  It is a fine Column of Freestone curiously wrought and enchas'd and in some Places painted It has an Obelisk on the Top several Coats of Arms and other Ornaments in proper Places all over it with Dials also on every Side and a Brass Plate with the following Inscription in Capital Letters  This Pillar was erected  Anno  by the Right Honourable  ANNE  Countess Dowager of  Pembroke  and sole Heir of the Right Honourable  George  Earl of  Cumberland c  for a Memorial of her last parting in this Place with her good and pious Mother the Right Honourable  Margaret  Countess Dowager of  Cumberland  the Second of  April  in Memory whereof she also left an Annuity of Four Pounds to be distributed to the Poor within this Parish of  Brougham  every Second Day of  April  for ever upon the Stone Table here by  This Countess of  Pembroke  had a noble and great Estate in this County and a great many fine old Seats all which she repaired and beautified and dwelt sometimes at one and sometimes at another for the Benefit of her Tenants and of the Poor whom she always made desirous of her Presence constantly relieving them by her Bounty and Hospitality But those Estates are since that Time gone into other Families particularly into that of the Earl of  Thanet  who has great Estates in  Westmorland    This Lady was of the Family of  Clifford  she had no less than Four Castles in this County of which  Pendragon  Castle was the chief which is a fine Building to this Day  Penrith  is accounted the second Town in the County for Wealth and Trade It is large and wellbuilt has a very good Market for all Sorts of  Commodities and Beasts The Markethouse is convenient and spacious the Church is large and noble the Westside was defended with a Royal Castle tho' now in Ruins In the Churchyard we saw Two Pillars or Feet asunder and the lowest of them Feet high tho' they seem equal The People told us that they were the Monument of Sir  Owen Caesar  but there is no Inscription upon them This Sir  Owen  they tell us was a Champion of mighty Strength and of gigantick Stature and so he was to be sure if as they say he was as tall as one of the Columns and could touch both Pillars with his Hands at the same time They relate no other great Actions of him but that he killed Robbers and destroyed wild Boars  On the Northside of the Vestry of this Church is erected in the Wall an antient square Stone with a Memorial intimating that in the Year there was a dreadful Plague in those Parts in which there died in  Kendal  Persons in  Penrith  in  Richmond  in  Carlisle    By this Account it should seem that every one of those Towns had separately more People than the City of  Carlisle  or else the Distemper was not so pestilential there and that  Kendal  which is the only manufacturing Town of them was the most populous  We did not go into the Grotto on the Bank of the River  Eden  of which mention is made by  Camden  's Continuator the People informing us that the Passage was blocked up with Earth so I must be content with telling you that it seems to have been a Lurkingplace for Robbers in old Time A Place of Strength it could not be for its Security seems to have consisted solely in its Secrecy It had certainly been worth seeing had it been passable The Entry is long and dark but whether strait or crooked I cannot say The Iron Gates leading to  it are gone nor is there any Sign of them or what they were hung to  Higher up on the  Eden  the Eastside of the County is  KirkOswald  an indifferent Markettown that has nothing of Note and  Brampton  stands N E of  Carlisle  on the River  Itching  about a Mile beyond the  Picts  Wall which has likewise nothing worth remarking saving an Hospital built by the Lady  Carlisle  Grandmother to the present Earl for Six poor Men and as many Women  At  Burgh upon the Sands  a little Distance from  Carlisle  is the Monument of our victorious Prince  Edward  I who having so far subdued the  Scots  as to bring away the sacred Stone at  Scone  Abbey whereon their Kings used to be crowned died here in his Camp on his March against them like a true Soldier guarding his Frontiers with his latest Breath In Memory of him there was afterwards erected a fair square Pillar nine Yards and a half high with these Inscriptions on Three Sides  On the West Side  Memoriae aeternae  EDVARDI I  Regis Angliae longe clarissimi qui in belli apparatu contra  Scotos  occupatus hic in castris obiit  Julii  A D      On the South Side  Nobilissimus Princeps  HENRICUS HOWARD  dux  Norfolciae  comes Mareschal Angliae comes Arund c ab  EDVARDO I  Rege Angliae oriundus P    On the North Side  JOHANNES AGLIONBY J C F  Beneath  THO LANGSTONE  fecit    Caerlisle  the  Lugovallum  or rather  Brovoniacum  of the  Romans  is situated exceedingly pleasant by the  Picts  Wall and guarded by Three Rivers by the  Eden  on the North by the  Peterel  on the East and on the West by the  Caude  It is a Place of great Antiquity being first builtby an antient  British  Prince named  Luel  and from him called  Caer Luel  i e  Luel  's Town to which it retains an Affinity of Sound to this Day It has suffer'd the Fate of most Frontier Towns been taken retaken burnt and destroyed several times by the  Scots Danes  and  Norwegians  and lay once in its Ruins for near Years till  William Rufus  rebuilt it who sent a Colony of Southern  Englishmen  to it and who is said likewise to have built the Castle  Henry  I dignified it with an Episcopal See and fortified it as a proper Barrier against the  Scots    The Cathedral Church is a venerable old Pile but seems to have been built at Two different times or as it were rebuilt the upper Part being much more modern than the lower A great Part of it was built by St  David  King of  Scotland  who held this County together with  Westmorland  and  Northumberland  in Vassalage from the Crown of  England  He and many of his Successors were great Benefactors to it and nominated several of the Bishops but almost the whole Nave or West Part of it was demolished by the  Scots  in the Civil Wars There is another Church called  St Cuthbert  's  King  Henry  VIII fortified this City against the  Scots  and built an additional Castle to it on the East Side which  Camden  calls a Citadel On the Northwest is a Garison The City has Three Gates and the Walls round it are so thick that Three Men may walk abreast on them within the Parapet Over the  Eden  is a Bridge which soon lets you into  Scotland  the Limits not being above Six Miles off for the South Part of it on this Side comes at least Miles farther into  England  than at  Berwick    Carlisle  is a wealthy and populous Place and the Houses are wellbuilt but it is not very large Here flourishes a good Trade in Fustians  I made a Trip when I was in these Parts to  Parton  in this County which I the rather mention because of the Improvements made in its Harbour of late Years by virtue of Acts of Parliament made for that Purpose  For in the fourth and fifth of the late Queen  Anne  an Act had passed for inlarging the Piers and Harbour of that Town but by the Negligence or Death of Trustees the Works intended by the Act were not carried to Effect This proving a great Disappointment to the Inhabitants who had built Houses on a Prospect of a considerable Trade in Exportation of Coals and other Commodities of the County in the Year another Act passed for Rebuilding the said Piers and Harbour In Consequence of this Act the Pier was rebuilt and the Harbour made capable of receiving several small Ships and a Trade for Coals to  Ireland  and other Parts commenced This gave Encouragement for another Act which passed  Anno  to inlarge the Term for Years after the Expiration of the former in order to make the Harbour still more complete for the Reception of Ships of greater Burden and to inlarge the River cleanse the Harbour and to bring into it a small Brook called  Maresbybeck  which runs near it All which will be of great Use to the Place as well as to Trade and Navigation in general  In this Northern County are more noted  Roman  Antiquities found than almost in any other It has a Lake called  Ulleswater  noted for producing the excellent Fish called Char almost peculiar to it and to  Winandermere Wrynose  one of its highest Hills is remarkable for its Three Shire Stones a Foot Distance each one in  Cumberland  one in  Westmorland  and the third in  Lancashire    Near  Salkeld  in this County is a Trophy erected vulgarly call'd  Long Meg and her Daughters  consisting of Stones  Long Meg  Feet above Ground and the rest but  This having been a Frontier County the antient Houses of the Nobility and Gentry are built for the most part Castlewise and are called Castles Thus  Greystock  Castle and  Drumbough  Castle belong to the Duke of  Norfolk    Cockermouth  Castle to the Duke of  Somerset    Naworth  Castle to the Earl of  Carlisle    Dacre  Castle to the late Earl of  Sussex    Corby  Castle Mr  Howard  's And here I must be a little more particular on the last which deserves the Observation of the Curious  Corby  Castle is situated about Four Miles S E of  Carlisle  and is the Seat of the said Mr  Howard  a Descendant from the Duke of  Norfolk  's Family The Building is of Stone neat but plain The Entrance to this House is by a large square Courtyard On the Righthand are the Gardens and on the Left Offices for the Servants and Stabling for Horses It is plentifully water'd by Springs in several large Reservoirs made about the House which stands on the Precipice of a high Rock which is in the Backpart about Feet high In this Rock is cut a regular Pair of Stairs of about Six Feet wide with all their Ornaments down to the Bottom As you descend these Stairs you pass by several Rooms hewn out of the Rock of about Feet square which have no other Furniture than Tables and Seats made out of the Stone At the Bottom of those Stairs you ascend another Pair about Feet high which leads to a Terrace made in Form of a Semicircle by the Side of which runs the River  Eden  having a Pair of Stairs to take Water at The Terrace presents a fine View of another Part of the Rock of equal Height with the former from the Top of which is placed a Cascade so wonderfully  curious that I know nothing like it It is at least Feet high and the Water is broken by the pointed Ridges of the Rock into so many various Shapes and the Springs fly about you in so delightfully rude a manner as to entertain you with a great Instance of the Power of Art in imbellishing Nature which is further heighten'd by a natural Cascade effected by this artificial one of which you have a distinct Prospect when you arrive at the Landingstairs  From hence you have another View of half a Mile long of the River on the Righthand and a hanging Grove of Trees just as Nature has placed them on the Left As you pass along a Gravelwalk you see several Figures placed there for Ornament at the End of the Walk is a small Banquetingroom with a Portico in the Front facing this Walk it is call'd  Tempealter  ' In this River is a Weir wellstock'd with Salmon and other Fish On the other Side of the River overagainst the House are the Remains of an old Castle which is called  WeatheralTower  under which is an Hermit's Cave  Westward of  Lancashire  and  Cumberland  lies the  Isle of Man  of which I shall take Notice among the Western Isles of  Scotland  See VOL IV p  Cumberland  gives Title of Duke to his Royal Highness Prince  William  his Majesty's second Son as it did before to his Royal Highness  George  Prince of  Denmark  Consort of the late Queen  Anne    Being now at the utmost Extent of  England  this Way I shall conclude my Letter with a few Observations upon the ROADS of this Part of the United Kingdom in general And first of the natural Soil in many Places where not mended by Turnpikes  The Soil of all the Midland Part of  England  even from Sea to Sea is of a deep stiff Clay or marly Earth and it carries a Breadth of near Miles at least in some Places much more nor is it possible to go from  London  to any Part of  Britain  North without crossing this clayey dirty Part For Example  Suppose we had been to take the great  Northern  Post Road from  London  to  York  and so into  Scotland  you have tolerable good Ways and hard Ground till you reach  Royston  about Miles and to  Kneesworth  a Mile farther but from thence you used to enter upon the Clays which beginning at the famous  ArringtonLanes  and going on to  Caxton Huntingdon Stilton Stamford Grantham Newark Tuxford  called for its Deepness  Tuxford  in the Clays hold on till we come almost to  Bautree  which is the first Town in  Yorkshire  and there the Country is naturally hard and sound being Part of  Shirwood  Forest  Suppose you had been to take the other  Northern  Road by  St Albans Dunstable Hockley NewportPagnel Northampton Leicester  and  Nottingham  or  Derby  After you are pass'd  Dunstable  which is about Miles you used to enter the deep Clays which were so surprisingly soft that it was perfectly frightful to Travellers and had been the Wonder of Foreigners how considering the great Numbers of Carriages which are continually passing with heavy Loads those Ways have been made practicable From  Hockley  to  Northampton  thence to  Harborough  and  Leicester  and thence to the very Banks of  Trent  these terrible Clays continue at  Nottingham  you are past them and the Forest of  Shirwood  naturally yields a hard and pleasant Road for Miles together  Take the same Road as it leads to  Coventry  and from thence to  WestChester  the deep Clays  reach through all the Towns of  Brickhill Fenny  and  Stony Stratford Towcester Daventry HillMorton  or  Dunchurch Coventry Coleshill  and even to  Birmingham  for near Miles  If we took the Road to  Worcester  it used to be the same through the Vale of  Ailesbury  to  Buckingham  and Westward to  Banbury Keynton  and the Vale of  Evesham  where the Clays reach with some Intermissions even to the Bank of  Severn  as they do more Northerly quite to  WestChester    This natural Difficulty of the Soil thro' all the midland Country where the Carriage at the same time was so prodigious and made some of the Highways in a manner impassable necessarily brought the Country to apply to Parliament and the Consequence has been that Turnpikes or Tollbars have been set up on the several great Roads of  England  beginning at  London  and proceeding thro' almost all those dirty deep Roads in the Midland Counties especially at which Turnpikes all Carriages Droves of Cattle and Travellers on Horseback are obliged to pay an easy Toll which bears no Comparison with the Benefit reap'd thereby and 'tis well worth recording for the Honour of the present Age that this Work has been begun and is in an extraordinary manner carry'd on and perhaps may in a great measure be completed within our Memory as to the worst and most dangerous Roads in the Kingdom And this is a Work of so much general Good that certainly no publick Edifice Almshouse Hospital or Nobleman's Palace can be of equal Value to the Country with this nor at the same time more an Honour and Ornament to it  The Benefit of these Turnpikes appears now to be so great and the People in all Places begin to be so sensible of it that it is incredible what Effect it has already had upon Trade in the Counties where  the Roads are completely finished even the Carriage of Goods is abated in some Places  d per  hundred Weight in others  d per  Hundred which is abundantly more Advantage to Commerce than the Charge paid amounts to and yet at the same time the Expence is paid by the Carriers too who make the Abatement so that the Benefit in abating the Rate of Carriage is wholly and simply the Tradesmens not the Carriers  Yet the Advantage is evident to the latter also another way for they can bring more Weight with the same Number of Horses nor are their Horses so hardwork'd and fatigu'd with their Labour as they were before in which one Particular 'tis acknowleged by the Carriers they perform their Work with more Ease and the Masters are at less Expence  The Advantage is also inexpressible to all other kinds of Travelling such as the Safety and Ease to Gentlemen journeying up to  London  on all Occasions whether to the Term to Parliament to Court or on any other necessary Occasion  Also the Riding Post as well for the ordinary carrying of the Mails as for Gentlemen when their Occasions require Speed is made extremely easy safe and pleasant by this Alteration of the Roads  The Safety of Travelling on this Occasion is the more to be insisted on because the Commissioners for these Repairs of the Highways do daily order Bridges to be repair'd and inlarg'd and new ones built where they find Occasion which not only serve to carry the Water off where it otherwise often spreads and lies as it were damm'd up upon the Road and spoils the Way but where it rises sometimes by sudden Rains to a dangerous Height for it is to be observ'd that there is more Hazard and more Lives lost in passing or attempting to pass little Brooks and Streams which are swell'd by sudden  Showers of Rain and where Passengers expect no Stoppage than in passing great Rivers where the Danger is known and therefore more carefully avoided  In many of these Places the Commissioners have not only built large and substantial Bridges but have set up Sluices to stop and open Chanels to carry off the Waters where they used to swell into the Highway and I have been told Years ago that the several Commissioners in the respective Districts where they are concerned had then built between and new Bridges where there were none before or where the former were small and insufficient to carry the Traveller safe over the Waters Many of these are within a few Miles of  London  especially for Example on the great Road from  London  to  Edgeworth  from  London  to  Enfield  from  London  to  St Albans  from  London  to  Croydon  c  Besides the Benefits accruing from this laudable Method we may add the Conveniency to those who bring fat Cattle especially Sheep to  London  in the Winter from the remoter Counties of  Leicester  and  Lincoln  where they are bred for before the Country Graziers were oblig'd to sell their Stocks off in  September  and  October  when the Roads began to be bad and when they generally sell cheap and the Butchers and Farmers near  London  used to engross them and keep them till  December  and  January  and then sell them tho' not an Ounce fatter than before for an advanced Price to the Citizens of  London  whereas now the Roads are in a Way to be made everywhere passable the City will be serv'd with Mutton almost as cheap in the Winter as in the Summer or the Profit of the Advance will be to the Country Graziers who are the original Breeders and take all the Pains  This is evidenced to a Demonstration in the Counties where the Roads are already repair'd from  whence they bring their fat Cattle and particularly their Mutton in Droves from Sixty Seventy or Eighty Miles without fatiguing harassing or sinking the Flesh of the Creatures even in the Depth of Winter  I might give Examples of other Branches of Inland Commerce which are and still will be further alter'd for the better by this Repairing the Roads and particularly that of carrying Cheese a Species of Provision so considerable that nothing except that of live Cattle can exceed it  This is chiefly made in the Three  Northwest  Counties of  England  viz  Cheshire Gloucestershire  and  Warwickshire  and the Parts adjacent from whence the Nation used to be very meanly supply'd by reason of the great Distance of the Country where the Cheese is made from those where it is chiefly expended  The  Cheshire  Men indeed carry great Quantities about by long Sea as they call it to  London  a terrible long and sometimes dangerous Voyage being thro' the  Irish Chanel  round all  Wales  cross the  Bristol Chanel  round the  Land's End  of  Cornwall  and up the  English Chanel  to the Mouth of the  Thames  and so up to  London  or else by Land to  Burton upon Trent  and so down that River to  Gainsborough  and  Hull  and so by Sea to  London    Again the  Gloucestershire  Men carry all by LandCarriage to  Lechlade  and  Cricklade  on the  Thames  and so carry it down the River to  London    But the  Warwickshire  Men have no WaterCarriage at all or at least not till they have carry'd it a long Way by Land to  Oxford  but as their Quantity is exceeding great and they supply not only the City of  London  but also the Counties of  Essex Suffolk Norfolk Cambridge Huntingdon Hertford Bedford  and  Northampton  the Gross of their Carriage is by mere dead Draught and they carry it  either to  London  by Land which is full Miles and so the  London  Cheesemongers supply the said Counties of  Essex Suffolk  and  Norfolk  besides  Kent  and  Sussex  and  Surrey  by Sea and River Navigation or the  Warwickshire  Men carry it by Land once a Year to  Sturbridge  Fair whence the Shopkeepers of all the Inland Country abovenam'd come to buy it in all which Cases LandCarriage being long when the Ways were generally bad it made it very dear to the Poor who are the chief Consumers  I could also inlarge here upon the Convenience that accrues to the Trade in fresh Fish from the Sea Coasts to the Inner Parts of the Kingdom whither when the Ways are bad they cannot carry them sweet This of course must greatly increase the Consumption of Fish in its Season and imploy a considerable Number of Horses and Men as well as increase the Shipping by that Consumption  By this I do not only mean the carrying of Herrings and Mackerel to  London  as is practised on the Coasts of  Sussex  and  Kent  in particular and bringing Salmon from the remote Rivers of  Severn  and  Trent  but the carrying of Herrings Mackerel and Sprats in their Season and Whitings and flat Fish at other times from the Coasts of  Yarmouth Swole Ipswich Colchester Malden  c and supplying all the Inland Counties with them sweet and good even as far as  Northampton  and  Coventry  c  I might give Examples where the Herrings which are not the best Fish to keep used even before these Reparations were set on foot to be carried to those Towns and up to  Warwick Birmingham Tamworth  and  Stafford  and tho' they frequently stunk before they got thither yet the People were so eager for them that they bought them up at a dear Rate whereas when the Roads are everywhere good they will come in less Time by at least Two Days  in Six of what they used to do and times the Quantity will be consum'd  These and many others are the Advantages to our Inland Commerce which we may have room to hope for upon the general Repair of the Roads and which I shall have great Occasion to speak of again in my  Northern  Circuit  Nor are the laudable Undertakings which have of late Years been set on foot for rendering many of the Inland Rivers of this Kingdom navigable a less profitable Improvement to the Publick many of which have been completed and others are completing according to Acts of Parliament already passed for that Purpose many of which I have taken notice of in the Course of my Letters And hardly a Session passes but Bills are still continued to be brought in for making others navigable All which must greatly tend with the repairing of the publick Roads as above to increase the Trade of this Nation  But 'tis time to conclude this Letter which I shall do with the following Transcription from the famous  Milton  which not unsuitably to the Subject I have just been upon thus enumerates the principal Rivers of  England  with their distinguishing Characters  Rivers arise whether thou be

am SIR Your humble S  ant  LETTER V GIVING A brief Account of the Isles of  Jersey Guernsey Alderney  and  Sarke    SIR  _THAT nothing may be wanting to complete this Work I shall briefly in this Place touch upon the Isles of  Jersey Guernsey Alderney  and  Sarke  which are the only Remains of the Dukedom of  Normandy  now in Possession of the  English  Crown And first of JERSEY  Various Names have been affix'd to this Island in the Time of the  Romans  it was nam'd  Caesarea  probably from the Dictator who subdued several Nations along this Tract which Conjecture is confirm'd by the present Name of one of its Forts which is  Le Fort de César  In the North of the Island at  Rosel  is an Intrenchment preserving the Name of  La petite Césarée  That the  Romans  were here is plain from the Remains of an antient Camp near the Manor of  Dilament  as also from Coins which have been found in different Parts of the Island particularly  One of  Commodus  and Two of  Probus  and  Posthumus  all in the Parish of  St Oûen  Its modern Appellation is no more than a Corruption of its old one  Jer  being a Contraction of  Caesar  and  Ey  signifying Island q d  Caesar  's Island  Augia  was a Name still elder than the Time when the  Romans  were acquainted with the Place and supposed to be the original one  The Island has sustained several Revolutions first by  Rollo  Duke of  Normandy  By the  French  By the  Normans  restored By the Uniting of it to the Crown of  England  The Inhabitants behav'd very valiantly in Defence of  Charles  I and his Son  Charles  II but were at last reduced by the irresistible Power of the  English  Parliament altho' they are supposed to have been the last who submitted to the common Fate of the Times by a Capitulation equally advantageous and honourable  We shall now proceed to give as clear an Account of the Situation and remarkable Places of this Island as the Narrowness of our Limits will admit  Jersey  is computed to be ° ′ N L and ° ′ W L from the Meridian of  London  Its Length is Miles its utmost Breadth between Six and Seven Its Northside from its lofty Cliffs is or Fathoms perpendicular from the Sea which renders it inaccessible that way but the South is much lower and almost level with the Water Its Form seems to resemble a Wedge or a rectangular Triangle  The higher Lands are diversify'd by gritty and gravelly stony and rocky fine and sweet Mould the lower by heavy deep and rich Soil All kinds of Forest and Fruittrees Shrubs Roots Flowers and Herbs flourish here with Pulse and Corn tho' their Wheat is smaller than  English    The Decay of Tillage so evident in this Isle is owing to three Causes The Increase of the Stocken Manufacture which naturally inclined the People to slight the more laborious Imployment of Agriculture The Improvement of Navigation and Foreign Traffick which had the same Effect The Culture of Cyder by converting the Arable Lands into Orchards for that Purpose which Commodity is the ordinary Drink of the Inhabitants who are now overstock'd with it so that there is Hope of their returning to the Plough and to their former Industry The Increase of Inclosures and Highways of the latter whereof here are three Sorts the first call'd  Le Chemin du Roy  or The King's Highway sixteen Feet in Breadth the second  Le Chemin de huit Pieds  or The Eightfoot way which with its Sides makes up Feet and the third  Le Chemin de quatre Pieds  or the Fourfoot Way for Horsecarriages  On the Rocks about the Island Seaweed grows plentifully which is an Equivalent for the Deficiency of other Things useful in Husbandry and is the common Manure of the Land in  Jersey    Here is Plenty of good Water from the inexhaustible Stores of Springs gushing from the numerous  Strata  of Rocks everywhere conspicuous Meat also and Butter are equally good and sweet here tho' the Cattle are inferior in Size to those elsewhere  The Ewes of this Isle had four Horns but the Rams six in  Camden  's Time tho' rarely now to be seen Fowl of all Kinds are here in great Quantities But none of the volatile Tribe exceed in Beauty the  Jersey  Partridge having the bright Eyes natural to that Bird red Legs and variegated Feathers The Flesh however is not much preferable to that of the common Partridge  This Island abounds with Fish the Species of which we may range thus Roughcoated Fish  such as Rousses Haus  c  the coarsest of all Shell and Rockfish among which is the  Ormer  supposed peculiar to these Parts and deriving its Name which is  French  from its Resemblance to a human Ear The Inside of the Shell is made use of in inlaid Works as Mother of Pearl to the bright Colour of which it approaches There is no Undershell but the Fish adheres to the Rock with its Back and is a solid Mass of white Pulp very grateful to the Taste which it regales like the Flesh of Land Animals In great Spring Tides at lowwater Mark it is found Flatfish as Rays Thornbacks Soles Plaise large Turbots  c  Scalefish Of these one Draught of Base has equall'd a Cartload Besides which here is the Mullet red and grey the Vrac or Seacarp and the Bar an exquisite Fish sometimes two Feet in Length Other Fish here are which for their Singularity we cannot pass by in Silence  The  Gronnard  is so call'd from its  grunting  Noise when taken Its Head is almost as big as the Body and its Colour is a deep Scarlet resembling Blood  The  Lançon  or  little Lance  from its Shape is never found in the Water but in some moving Sandbank deserted by the Sea when the Sand being mov'd with an iron Hook the Fish spring up and are caught by Handfuls The young Men and Maids take great Delight during the warm Summer Nights in this Sport which is render'd easy to them by the Glistering of the Prey above the Sand This they term  aller au Lançon  It is prepar'd as an Anchovy and welldress'd gives an agreeable Relish  Another odd Fish is the  Sirene  which is furnish'd with Teats like a Woman's  The ugly but harmless and perhaps wholsome Animal the Toad abounds here as do innoxious Creatures of the Serpentine Kind particularly Lizards which gaze on Passengers as they lie basking  in the Sun But the worst of the reptile Kind are Moles which damage the Corn and Grass though they compensate that Detriment by affording a freer Passage to the Rain thro' their  Latibula    The Climate here is in general wholsome tho' as Luxury has gain'd Ground Diseases unknown to former Ages have been its constant Attendants so that it cannot now boast of that Character given it by  Camden That here was no Room for the Physicians    The Rocks are vast and terrible the Tides rapid and strong as an Evidence of which here is no Stillwater at any time as in other Parts of the  British  Chanel  The whole Island consists of Parishes which are divided into  Vintaines  from the Houses which formerly as is said constituted each Parish tho' now some Parishes vastly exceed that Number  Cueillettes  is the Name for these Divisions in the Parish of  St Oûen  alone  But to be more particular The Parish just mention'd contains six  Cueillettes  namely  De Vinchelés des Millés de Leoville des Grontés Grande Cueillette  and  Petite Cueillette  The Seigneur  de St Oûen  has a large Pond in the West of the Island containing about Acres of Land wherein are Carp of so extraordinary a Size as scarce to be equalled in  Europe  some of them being four Feet four Inches in Length Part of the great Bay of  St Oûen  had been a rich Vale which was swallow'd up by the Sea    St Peter  contains six  Vintaines  which are  Des Angueres du Coin Varin du Doet de St Nicolas de la Vallée  and  Grande Vintaine    In  St Brelade  are four  Vintaines  call'd  Des Quenves de la Moye du Coin  and  de Noirmont  In this Parish stands the Town of  St Aubin  the second of the Island and from it the Bay adjoining  derives its Name which consists of white Sand level and firm and thence the Travelling from this Town to  St Helier  the Capital is render'd smooth and easy And as the Church is at a Distance and intercepted by a bleak Hill the Inhabitants who are in plentiful Circumstances were building when I was there a convenient Chapel by way of Contribution The Port which is the best and most frequented in  Jersey  has a strong Pier carry'd into the Sea which receives and affords a safe Harbour for Ships Here a Sixthrate just floats at a dead Neap and a Ship of Tons at all times At Halfflood a Vessel of Tons may find Entrance Larger Ships indeed and Men of War must remain in the Road where is good Anchorage The Pier joins to the Fort of  St Aubin  which renders the Place very defensible These Advantages have brought hither many Merchants and Masters of Ships and every  Monday  is held what is improperly call'd a Market for it is rather an Exchange where Merchants and others meet for transacting Affairs of Navigation and Traffick The Houses are mostly new    St Mary  has two Vintaines  Du Nord  and  du Sud  In this Parish was discover'd a Spring strongly impregnated with a purging Mineral the Water of which was approved of by Dr  Charleton  an eminent  English  Physician    St Laurence  contains four Vintaines  viz Du Coin Motier du Coin Tourgis du Coin és Hastains  and  de la Vallée      St John  has three Vintaines which are  Du Nord du Doet de Herupe  In this Parish is a Hill call'd  Montmado  whereon is a rich Quarry of excellent Stone capable of being cut into regular Squares like  Portland  Stone  In  Trinity  are five Vintaines namely  De la Ville à l' Evesque du Rondin de Rosel des Augrés  and  de la Croizerie      St Helier  comprehends four Vintaines which are  Du Mont à l' Abbée du Mont au Prétre du Mont Cochon  and  de la Ville  The Situation of  St Helier  is pleasant as well as commodious having on the Southwest the Sea with a full Prospect of  Elizabeth  Castle and of the Road for Ships To the North are Hills which are an excellent Defence against the Cold and at their Feet a Flat of Meadows inliven'd by a pure Stream which from hence enters the Streets and even the Houses so that the Water is easily brought up by Buckets let down thro' a Trapdoor or from the Reservoirs of Wells and Pumps Another huge Hill projects in a manner over the Town and being a Common affords to the Cattle Herbage and to Gentlemen and Ladies an agreeable Walk with the Advantage of an extensive Prospect The usual Name of this Hill is  Le Mont de la Ville  The unfortunate Duke of  Somerset  Protector of the King and Kingdom had probably intended to protect himself from the Malice of his Enemies by building a new Town here as he did a Citadel at  Alderney  both which Designs became abortive by his Death In  St Helier  at present are about Houses disposed into divers wide and wellpav'd Streets  La Cohue Royale  or the Seat of Justice stands in a large Quadrangle on each Side of which are handsome Structures Here is held every  Saturday  a Market or rather a Fair whither People flock from all Parts of the Island to enjoy their Friends or transact Business In the Town live few landed Gentlemen but many Shopkeepers Artificers and Retailers of Liquor Scarce any thing is wanting to the Uses of Necessity or Convenience  La Halle la Boucherie  or the Shambles is a large Room inclosed so that the Sight and Smell of Carcases do not here annoy the Eyes and Nostrils of People as they do in most Country Towns The Number of Inhabitants exclusive of  some Hundreds in the OutVintaines who are Parishioners tho' not Townsmen is supposed to amount to Two thousand And the Church tho' very capacious by the Accession of Galleries when I was there was crouded with them    St Saviour  has six Vintaines of the following Denominations  De Maufant de sous la Hogue des Pigneaux de sous l' Eglise de le Grande Longueville  and  de la Petite Longueville    Under  St Martin  are comprehended these five Vintaines  De Rosel de la Queruée de sous l' Eglise du Fief du Roy  and  de Faldoit      Gronville  comprises four Vintaines  De la Rue des Marais de Longueville  and  de la Roque    In  St Clement  are three Vintaines by Name  Du Mont Roquier de Samaréz  and  Grand Vintaine  In the Canal call'd  Samaréz  are great Numbers of Carp and Eel the only freshwater Fish in the Island  The Cueillettes and Vintaines are in all The Buildings are all of Stone as may well be supposed in a Country which is nothing but a huge Rock cover'd with  Strata  of Earth The common Sort is Ragstone The Stone on  Montmado  mention'd above is of a reddish White the whiter the better of a fine Grain and may be wrought almost as sleek as polish'd Marble The Churches and finest Edifices are cover'd with blue Slate the ordinary Houses are thatch'd with long Wheatstraw  The principal Trade is that to  Newfoundland  whither in the Year were sent Ships from thence to proceed to the  Mediterranean  in order to dispose of their Fish Another Branch of Trade is that of knit Hose or Stockens which are every  Saturday  sold at  St Helier  to the Merchants and many thousand Pairs are made weekly in the Island  The Language as you may guess from the Names of Places is  French  tho' obsolete and thence to be  esteem'd barbarous This Remark however is not to be extended to their Religious Worship Judicatures or even the Conversation of the more polite in all which the pure  French  is used Tho' this is the original Language yet one may observe a pretty good Smattering of  English  even among the lower Class of People owing to the Intermixture of the Soldiers in the Garison at  St Helier  in the Church of which Town Prayers are alternately in  French  and  English    The chief Officer who represents the King's Person is the Governor His Excellency at the Time when I was there was the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount  Cobham    Harliston  Tower was so call'd from Sir  Richard Harliston  Governor of the Island in the Time of King  Henry  VII who built it in  Mont Orgueil  Castle The great Sir  Walter Ralegh  bore this high Office to which his Name does Honour  MontOrgueil  is of so great Antiquity that no Record subsists old enough to determine its Origin 'Tis at present slighted and in a ruinous Condition and what it was formerly  ElizabethCastle  now is equal to any Fortress within the  British  Dominions It is nam'd  Le Château de l' Islet  or simply  L' Islet  from its Situation on a small Island In Circuit it is little less than a Mile In all the Bells in  Jersey  excepting one to each Church were sold towards defraying the Expence of the Building In the  Upper Ward  was erected which is properly Queen  Elizabeth  's Castle every House in the Island furnishing four Days Work The  Lower Ward  is King  Charles  I's Castle and was begun in During the Civil War  CharlesFort  was added and in the  French  threatening the Place the  Green  was inclosed within a Wall  The Fort of  St Aubin  is of good Use towards clearing the Road and for a Safeguard to Ships  within the Pier which it secures by its Cannon planted on the Bastions tho' in antient Times it was no more than a great Tower on a Rock thence nam'd  La Tour    There are five Regiments of regular Forces on the Island which are reviewed every th of  May  the Anniversary of the Restoration  The Civil Government is administer'd by a Bailly assisted by Jurats  Here are divers Monuments of the  Druidical Superstitions  which are flat Ragstones of vast Size and Weight raised three or four Feet from the Ground and sustain'd by others of less Bulk These the Natives call  Poquelayes  and are the Altars on which Sacrifices often human were immolated particularly in the Parish of  St Helier  three of them contiguous to each other and on the Summit of a Place call'd  Le Rouge Bouillon  another besides one on  St Helier's Hill  Another larger near  MontOrgueil  Castle and near  Roselhaven  on a Cliff nam'd  Le Couperon  an Antiquity seeming to be a little Temple of theirs At a Place call'd  Les Landes Pallot  in the Parish of  St Saviour  was a Rockingstone like that I shall mention in  Scotland  destroy'd by the  Cromwellians  erected by the  Druids  probably to awe the People into a Belief of their Miracles This also has been demolish'd  Here are also Monuments of the  Popish Superstition  two more particularly The first call'd  La Chapelle de nôtre Dame des Pas  from the Blessed Virgin who is said to have left the Print of her Steps on the very Spot of the Rock whereon the Chapel is erected and this too after her Body was moulder'd into Dust The second is term'd  Hoguebie  a Chapel over a Tomb built according to Tradition by the disconsolate Widow of the  Seigneur de Hambie  a  Norman  who fell by Treachery in this Island and whose Loss was so afflicting to his Lady that she erected it on  Purpose to have the melancholy Pleasure of seeing the Place where her Lord's Corps was interr'd from her Window in  Normandy  and to procure his Soul the great Benefit of Masses Afterwards one  Mabon  who had been a Pilgrimage to  Jerusalem  took a Fancy to lengthen the Chapel toward the East and to hollow a Place under the Altar in order to represent our Lord's Sepulchre This Place was made the chief Seat of the Popish Delusion  Notwithstanding the prevailing Terrors of the Papal Empire in the Days of Queen  Mary  the Magistrates of  Jersey  had the Courage to put to Death  Richard Averty  a Priest and furious Prosecutor of the marry'd Clergy for murdering his Bastard Child which he effected without the Mother's Knowlege  The Mace borne before the Bailly and Magistrates at the Convention of the States  c  has this Inscription  Tali haud omnes dignatur honore  CAROLUS Secundus Magnae Britanniae Franciae Hiberniae Rex serenissimus affectum regium erga insulam de JERSEY in qua bis habuit receptum dum caeteris ditionibus excluderetur hocce monumento vere regio posteris consecratum voluit jussitque ut deinceps Balivis praeferatur in perpetuam memoriam fidei tum augustissimo parenti CAROLO I tum suae majestati saevientibus bellis civilibus servatae a viris clarissimis Philippo Georgio de Carteret equitibus auratis hujus insulae Baliv Reg Praefect  Of which this is the Translation  Not all are with such Honour grac'd  CHARLES the Second the most serene King of  Great Britain France  and  Ireland  has resolved  that his Royal Favour towards the Isle of JERSEY in which he twice met with a Place of Refuge while he was excluded from the rest of his Dominions should be consecrated to Posterity by this truly Royal Monument And commanded that thenceforward it should be borne before the Baillies in perpetual Memory of the Loyalty preserv'd both to his most August Father CHARLES I and to his Majesty during the Rage of the Civil Wars by the most excellent Men Sir  Philip  and Sir  George de Carteret  Knights Baillies and Chief Governors of this Island  St  Magloire  the Apostle of  Jersey  lies bury'd in a little Chapel near a Freeschool corruptly call'd from him  L' Ecole de St Magloire  and founded with another nam'd  St Anastase  by King  Henry  VII who granted a Charter for that useful Purpose  This Place gives Title of Earl to the Lord Viscount  Villiers  the second who has enjoy'd that Dignity  II The next Isle I am to speak of is GUERNSEY the antient Name of which was  Sarnia  From  Jersey  it is distant Miles to the Northwest yet equals not the former either in point of Fruitfulness or Extent of Territory for it has but Parishes This Advantage however it enjoys above  Jersey  That here no venomous Creatures can subsist It is also naturally better fortify'd from Invasion by craggy Rocks and Precipices On the contrary its Situation compar'd with that of  Jersey  renders this inferior for whereas the North of  Jersey  is much higher than the South as we have said the South Side of  Guernsey  is high and the North low which produces a double Obliquity of the Sun and Land and hence the Difference in the Soil and Air of each  Notwithstanding this they both agree as to their Original their Productions and the Civil Military and Ecclesiastical Government Among the circumjacent Rocks is found the sharp and hard Stone call'd  Smyris  or  Emeril  and used by Glaziers for cutting Glass as well as by Jewellers for polishing their Work  In Trade it is superior to its Neighbour  Jersey  by having a more convenient Port at its Eastern Extremity adjoining to the South where the Shore retiring inward in the Form of a Crescent makes the Place capable of holding large Vessels The Foundation of its Pier was laid in the Beginning of  Edward  I's Reign by prodigious Stones heap'd on each other to a considerable Height and regularly cemented The Shipping here is not only safe and may be brought close up to the Town which we shall presently mention but the Pier itself is adorn'd with large smooth Flags and guarded by Parapets so that being of sufficient Length and Breadth it is used as the chief Place for Rendezvouses on Parties of Pleasure by the fashionable People of the Town as well as for its noble Prospect over the Sea and adjacent Isles  On the Rightside of the Port stands  CornetCastle  which at high Tides is surrounded by the Sea Sir  Leonard Chamberlan  who was Governor of  Guernsey  in  Mary  I's Time and his Successor Sir  Thomas Leighton  improved it with Fortifications In the Year the Governor Lord Viscount  Hatton  lost his Lady and himself escaped with great Difficulty from a prodigious Storm of Lightning which catching the Powderstore blew up the lofty Tower with the Standard so that the Castle must have formerly made a much more grand Appearance than at present However what it wants in Beauty it makes up in real Usefulness for it has the Command of the Town and Harbour  and its Situation alone renders it strong being divided from the Land by an Arm of the Sea about Yards wide except in great Springtides when it is fordable  On the Leftside too is a mean old Castle  The only Town is call'd  St Peter  's has a free Trade which is however render'd ineffectual by Privateering has a Market is well stor'd with Implements of War and consists of one long Street which is narrow being confin'd between the Sea and the impending Hills The Market is always plentifully supply'd with Fish  To the North joins a Peninsula nam'd  Le Val  where once was a Priory And  To the West near the Sea is a Lake a Mile and a half in Circumference stock'd with Fish especially a kind of Carp of extraordinary Size and delicious to the Taste  The Governor of  Guernsey  was when I was on the Spot the late Marquis of  Montandre  and his Lieutenant  John Graham    Esq  From hence the Second Son of  Heneage  late Earl of  Nottingham  and Lord High Chancellor by Name  Heneage Finch  was promoted to the Dignity of a Peer of  England  by the Style of Baron of  Guernsey    In  Guernsey  there are Eight Ministers to its Ten Parishes Four of them being united  I cannot take Leave of this Island without a short Recital of a  flagrant  Instance of Popish Inhumanity which not content to roll in Seas of Blood all over  England  extended itself to this remote Corner The Fact was thus In the Days of that Firebrand of her Country  Mary  I a poor Widow and her Two Daughters one the Wife of  Perrotine Massey  a Minister who had happily escaped the impending Fate by leaving his native Soil were sentenced to the Stake for what was call'd  Heresy  The  marry'd Woman's Body during the Execution bursting by the Violence of the Flames discharg'd the Pledge of her conjugal Affection a beautiful Male Infant which was hastily caught up by the Ministers of  Justice  and carried before the Magistrates whose  tender Mercies  commanded That it should be thrown in with the Mother which was accordingly done  Hoc fera religio potuit suadere malorum▪  How far the Practices of this Sect may have been changed by the Illumination of  Truth  instead of  Faggots  notwithstanding their obstinate Perseverance in their former  Principles  I will not pretend to determine but sure I am That from bad  Principles  to bad  Practices  the Transition is extremely easy and Experience has more than once especially within the  British  Dominions testify'd the Truth of this Observation I now proceed to mention tho' very briefly an Isle dependent on the Government of  Guernsey  This is  III ALDERNEY supposed by  Camden  to be the  Arica  of  Antoninus  by others the  Ebodia  or  Evodia  of  P Diaconus  It is situated about a League and a half from  Cape la Hogue  in  Normandy  is in Circumference about Eight Miles and contains One Church with a Town in which are about Houses which lodge to the Number of Inhabitants The Soil is good for Pasture or Arable And I was shewn one Field here of about Acres which as I was told had not once lain fallow for Years before Their Manure is Seaweed call'd  Vraic  of which we have taken notice above The Land lies high and to the South is a Harbour admitting only small Vessels  The Streight which divides this Isle from  France  term'd  Le Ras de Blanchart  or  The Race of Alderney  is esteem'd a dangerous Passage in stormy Weather when the Winds happen to encounter with  the strong Currents In calm Seasons it is very safe and the largest Ships may ride here with Ease Nay in Part of the  French  Fleet escap'd this Way after the Blow they had met with at  la Hogue  The last Place I shall mention in this Letter is the Isle of  IV SARKE which as well as  Alderney  is dependent on the Government of  Guernsey  It is no more than Two Miles in Length and is situated in the midst of all the others and guarded with steep Rocks Its Corn is excellent the Land very high which together with its Situation renders it one of the strongest Places in the World Its Water is very good Formerly here was no Way for Draughts and Carriages from the Sea till  Philip de Carteret Seigneur ae St Oúen  who had a Grant of the Island from Queen  Elizabeth  and in whose Descendants the Property is vested caused one to be cut thro' the impending Cliff which for some Space is carry'd on in subterranean Darkness till it emerges within the Island and is fortify'd with Cannon and by a Gate In the Reign of  Edward  III was standing the Convent of  St Magloire  with a Pension from the Exchequer where that holy Person is said to have resided  The Island fell into the Hands of the  French  but in the Reign of Queen  Mary  I was recover'd and the Inhabitants have ever since enjoy'd the mild Influence of the  British  Government equally approving of their present happy Condition and detesting the Fetters of  French  Slavery Their Number amounts to about and one Minister performs their divine Offices Thus having completed what I promised I rest from my TOUR and am  SIR  Your most humble Servant  APPENDIX  _WE have purposely reserv'd the Account of several material Things and Places to the Conclusion of this Volume for the Sake of being more perfect in the Description of them than we had Opportunity to be at the Time of printing the several Letters And we shall now insert the following Articles under this Title but which however may be incorporated in their proper Places in future Editions of this Work  We shall begin with a brief Description of the famous Gardens of the Right Hon the Lord Viscount  Cobham  at  Stow  in  Buckinghamshire    VOL II p  WE enter'd on the Southside of the Garden between Two square Pavilions of the  Dorick  Order the Work of Sir  John Vanbrugh  and were struck with the surprising Grandeur and Variety of the Objects that presented themselves to our View of which I shall give a brief Account in Order as we passed them  First then in the Middle of a large Octagon Piece of Water stands an Obelisk of near Feet  which is design'd for a  Jetd' Eau  to cascade from the Top of it At a good Distance we beheld Two beautiful Rivers which join and enter the Octagon in One Stream Over One of the Rivers is a  Palladian  Bridge which is an agreeable Object A  Gothick  Building Feet high presents itself on the Summit of a fine Hill which we were told is intended to be dedicated to  Liberty    Here we had likewise a View of the South Front of the House up an Avenue of stately Trees but great Objections have been made to the Narrowness of it which is no doubt an essential Fault However since every Tree may be deem'd a sort of Obelisk to the Honour of the noble Planter it makes a good Excuse for their standing and the rather as if they were taken away it would create an Evil which could not be remedied in Years  As the  Gothick  Building is on the Righthand so on the Lest appears an  Egyptian  Pyramid dedicated to the Memory of Sir  John Vanbrugh    In short here is such a Scene of Magnificence and Nature display'd the Fields abounding with Cattle the Trees and Water so delightfully intermingled and such a charming Verdure Symmetry and Proportion everywhere presenting to the Eye that the Judgment is agreeably puzzled which singly to prefer of so many collected Beauties  Leaving this Point and on the Lefthand passing by Three Statues we came to the Coldbath from whence we beheld a natural Cascade falling down from the beforementioned Octagon in Three different Sheets of Water into a large Lake One of the Sheets glides thro' an Arch or Piece of Ruin which is mostly hid by a Clump of Evergreens but his Lordship as we are told designs to make a good deal of Amendment to it tho' at present it has a very natural and agreeable Appearance  From hence we proceeded to the Hermitage which is agreeably situated in a rising Wood and by the Side of the Lake and passing thro' the Wood we came to the Statues of  Cain  and  Abel  fronting the  Veneris Hortus  a very neat Structure designed by Mr  Kent  the Inside of it painted by Mr  Sleats  and on the Frize is the following Motto alluding to the Painting in the Cave  Nunc amet qui nondum amavit  Quique amavit nunc amet  Which is  He who ne'er lov'd a Lover grow  And he who has continue so  Here is likewise a  Sophia  Each Way from the Entrance of the Room is a handsome Colonnade leading to square Tabernacles or Pavilions Here are also Four venerable antique Bustoes of  Vespasian Nero Cleopatra  and  Faustina    Hence to the Head of the Lake we had a pleasant View of the Cascade and from hence to  Gibbs  's Building or the  Belvidere  which is placed on the Top of the Mount is a noble Prospect of the House the Church the Effigies of his present Majesty and the late Queen the Rotonda the Castle which a Farmer now inhabits and was built for that Purpose but on account of its being seated on the Side of a fine rising Hill makes a beautiful Appearance as well from hence as from many other Places  In the Garden is likewise the Temple of  Friendship  from which the Pavilion at the Entrance the Cascade the Lake one of the Fields that is inclosed in the Garden all together afford a Scene truly charming  From hence to  Boycoat  Buildings passing thro' a pleasant Wood with several agreeable Prospects into the Country we saw on our Righthand a noble  Terrace One of the Buildings is a very good habitable House the other stands on a square Bottom in the Garden and in the Inside of it are Four Statues at full Length in Niches viz  Cicero Faustina Marcus Aurelius  and  Livia  The Buildings are both finish'd with pyramidical Tops by  Gibbs  Betwixt them is a very handsome Gateway which is the second Entrance to the House from which leads up a noble Avenue planted with double Lines of thriving Trees  From hence to the  Egyptian  Pyramid mentioned before which is Feet high and about half Way up is this Inscription in very large Characters  Inter plurima hortorum horum aedificia a JOHANNE VANBRUGH equite designata hanc pyramidem illius memoriae sacram esse voluit COBHAM  In  English  thus  Among a very great Number of Structures in these Gardens designed by Sir JOHN VANBRUGH Knight COBHAM thought fit that this Pyramid should be sacred to his Memory  And in the Inside of the Building is the following Inscription  Lusisti satis edisti satis atque bibisti  Tempus abire tibi est ne potum largius aequo  Rideat pulset lasciva decentius aetas  Which may be thus translated  Enough you've sported quaff'd the Bowl and eat  'Tis Time that from the Banquet you retreat  Lest Youth more fitly frolicksome may join  To push you reeling under Loads of Wine  From hence going along a sort of Fortification Walk on our Lefthand the Wood on the other  Hand we enter'd the Field which is inclosed in a military Way with a staked Fence At the first Angle on the middle of the Gravelwalk are the Statues of  Hercules  and  Antëus  Hence we proceeded to  St Augustine  's Cave which is a Building of Roots of Trees and Moss and in it a Straw Couch with Three Inscriptions in  Monkish Latin  Verse It is placed in a natural Wood and from the Oddness of the Fabrick and the agreeable Simplicity which is round it makes a very entertaining Variety  Leaving this Place we approached a Building of a very different Nature the Temple of  Bacchus  built of Brick with Paintings in the Inside alluding to the Name Here we had a fine distant Prospect toward  Aylesbury  and  Wendover  Hills  c  In the Garden we had in full View the Temple of  Venus  and between the Two is an Obelisk erected to the Memory of a Clergyman with this Inscription  To the Memory of  ROBIN COUCHER  We proceeded from hence to the  Saxon  Temple which is a solemn Grove with the Seven  Saxon  Deities presiding over the several Days of the Week placed in Niches and in the Middle of them stands an Altar as for Sacrifice All the Statues are extremely good and this Scene agreeably strikes the Mind with Serenity and Composure  Our Eye after being confined in the Wood breaking at once out of it we were surprised with a fine open Country on the North on the South the Rotonda appears on the West the  Boycoat  Buildings on the East the Equestrian Statue of the late King which stands in the Front of the House These Objects present themselves from  Nelson's  Seat which is an oblong square Recess in a Clump of Evergreens To the Southeast is a View of the Mansionhouse which is an extraordinary good one but his Lordship annually adding to and improving  it one may safely say that it will not be much inferior to the best House in  England  if his Lordship's Design be finished  The Offices on the Northside are all inclosed within a most elegant Wall with Niches and grand Gateways into the Offices and Gardens The House and Offices when perfected will be about Feet in Length fronting North and South As  Nelson  's Seat lies to the Northwest from the Portico of the House there is on the Northeast a new Bastion building to answer it and some grand Walks are now making by the Side of a fine Lawn from which we see numerous Herds of Deer A Semicircle of fine Timber appears at some Miles Distance with an agreeable Country between  On the South Front of the House is a very handsome Parterre decorated with  Apollo  and the Muses gilt Vessels and Two Orangeries but it is likely this will be intirely altered for if the lower End is laid open there will appear a noble Scene where Nature and Art are curiously blended  The next Object of our View was a  Corinthian  Column on which is the Statue of his present Majesty with this Inscription  GEORGIO AVGVSTO  Here we had a most delightful Prospect over the Country and in the Garden several of the Buildings present themselves with great Pomp The Lake whose Bounds are beautifully concealed adds much to the general Agreeableness of the Place  Dido  's Cave was the next Subject of our Attention this is a Stone Building in a Wood and raised on a sort of Amphitheatre with this Inscription  Speluncam  Dido  dux  Trojanus  eandem  Deveniunt  In  English  thus  Repairing to the same dark Cave are seen  The  Trojan  Hero and the  Tyrian  Queen  From hence we advanced to the Rotonda which is a neat airy Building by Sir  John Vanbrugh  The Dome of it supported on Ten  Dorick  Columns and in the Centre standing on a circular Pedestal a  Venus à Medicis  From this Place we had a View of Part of the Octagon the Lake the Fields and several of the Buildings presenting themselves alternately as we turned ourselves round  As we went from hence to the late Queen's Statue by the Side of a Canal we were delighted with an Alteration of his Lordship's  viz  On each Side the Ground is broken and planted with Clumps of various kinds of Trees intermixt with Statues which are promiscuously placed Her late Majesty's Effigies is erected on Four  Ionick  Columns which are placed on a large Pedestal with this Inscription in Golden Letters  Honori Laudi Virtuti Divae CAROLINAE  To the Honour Praise and Virtue of the Divine CAROLINE  It is situated on a neat Amphitheatre of Slopes with pastoral Figures each Way from it Nature and Art here joining together make an agreeable Contraste  Next we were led into the Sleeping Parlour which is a square Building placed in a Wood with Six Walks centring in it Within are painted the  Caesars  Heads with several Festons of Fruit  c  On the Frize is this Inscription  Cum omnia sint in incerto save tibi  Which is  Since all Things are uncertain indulge thyself  Leaving this Place and crossing the Avenue beforementioned from the Pavilions we came to the Witchhouse a square Building the Inside of which is painted by my Lord's Gentleman with several Devices alluding to the Name  We arrived next at the Temple of  Antient Virtue  a Rotonda of the  Dorick  Order by Mr  Kent  and in Four Niches standing at full Lengths are the Four following Statues  viz  I EPAMINONDAS with this Inscription over his Head  Cujus a virtute prudentia verecundia  Thebanorum respublica  Libertatem simul imperium  Disciplinam bellicam civilem domesticam  Accepit  Eoque amisso perdidit  That is  From whose Valour Prudence and Moderation the Republick of  Thebes  received both Liberty and Empire its military civil and domestick Discipline and with him lost them  II LYCURGUS with this  Qui summo cum consilio inventis legibus  Omnemque contra corruptelam munitis optime  Pater patriae  Libertatem firmissimam  Et mores sanctissimos  Expulsa cum divitiis avaritia luxuria libidine  In multa secula  Civibus suis instituit  Thus translated  Who having invented Laws with the greatest Wisdom and most excellently fenced them against all Corruption as a Father of his Country instituted for his Countrymen the firmest Liberty and the soundest Morality which endured  for many Ages he having together with Riches banished Avarice Luxury and Lust  III SOCRATES  Qui corruptissima in civitate innocens  Bonorum hortator unici cultor DEI  Ab inutili otio vanis disputationibus  Ad officia vitae societatis commoda  Philosophiam avocavit  Hominum sapientissimus  That is  Who being innocent in a most corrupt State an Encourager of the Good a Worshipper of One only GOD as the wisest of Men reduced Philosophy from useless Indolence and vain Disputations to the Duties of Life and the Advantages of Society  IV HOMERUS  Qui poetarum princeps idem maximus  Virtutis praeco immortalitatis largitor  Divino carmine  Ad pulcre audendum patiendum fortiter  Omnibus notus gentibus omnes incitat  Thus rendered  Who being the First of Poets as he was the greatest the Herald of Virtue and Bestower of Immortality known to all Nations incites all in a Divine Poem honourably to dare and resolutely to suffer  Over one Door is this Inscription  Charum esse civem bene de republica mereri laudari coli diligi gloriosum est metui vero in odio esse invidiosum detestabile imbecillum caducum  Which is  To be dear to our Country to deserve well of the State to be praised honoured and beloved  is glorious but to be dreaded and hated is matter of Illwill detestable weak ruinous  Over the other Door this  Justitiam cole pietatem quae cum sit magna in parentibus propinquis tum in patria maxima est Ea vita via est in coelum in hunc coetum eorum qui jam vixerunt  In  English  thus  Maintain Justice and thy relative Duty which as it is great when exercised toward our Parents and Kindred so is greatest toward our Country That Life is the Way to Heaven and to this Assembly of those who have already lived  From this Place we had no distant Prospect but notwithstanding that it abounds with lasting Beauties it is really placed in a sort of Paradise and Things rising adequate to that Name you see  Friendship  flourishing in immortal Youth in the  Elysian Fields  are many great and virtuous Mens Names perpetuated who have distinguished themselves in  this  World by answering the End of their Creation Near this Place also is a good Emblem of those who have deviated from it in the Ruin Here are sweet purling Streams resembling the melodious Sounds of Birds  c  We were now not far from the Parish Church which is so closely surrounded with a Wood as not to be seen From hence we came to the Side of a River where  Unpolish'd Nature cannot boast a Part  For Chance too regular too rude for Art  And by its winding Banks we were led up to a Grotto which is to be decorated with Shells Pebbles and Minerals Here is likewise a Shellpavilion  the Dome of which is supported by Six wreathed Columns The Inside of it hath several Marks performed from Shells and divers other Imbellishments On the opposite Side is to be another of Pebbles  Hence we proceeded to the Threearch'd Building which is a pleasant Recess by the Banks of the River and in passing we saw  Antient Virtue  peeping on the Southside of us The Church we had in full View on the West To the East is situated the  Chinese  House a Building in the Pond the Outside of it painted very ingeniously in the  Chinese  Taste by the celebrated Mr  Sleats  The Inside of it is  Indian  Japan  The Shell Bridge led us from hence into the  Elysian Fields  the most charming Place that ever Eyes beheld It may not be improper here to give the following Lines which were left by an unknown Gentleman on his Entrance into them  To Lord  COBHAM  Charm'd with the Sight my ravish'd Breast is fir'd  With Hints like those which antient Bards inspir'd  All the feign'd Tales by Superstition told  All the bright Train of fabled Nymphs of old  Th' enthusiastick Muse believes are true  Thinks the Spot sacred and its Genius YOU  Lost in wild Rapture would she fain disclose  How by Degrees the pleasing Wonder rose  Industrious in a faithful Verse to trace  The various Beauties of the lovely Place  And while she keeps the glowing Work in View  Thro' ev'ry Maze your artful Hand pursue  c  We are now come to the Monuments of  British  Worthies the First of which is Mr POPE with no Inscription  The next is Sir THOMAS GRESHAM with this Inscription  Who by the honourable Profession of Merchant having enriched himself and his Country for carrying on the Commerce of the World built the ROYAL EXCHANGE  INIGO

Universe  Sir FRANCIS BACON Lord VERULAM  Who by the Strength of a superior Genius rejecting vain Speculation and fallacious Theory taught to pursue and improve Philosophy by the certain Method of Experiment  In the Niche of a Pyramid is placed a  Mercury  with these Words subscribed  CAMPOS DUCIT AD ELYSIOS  Leads to th'  Elysian  Fields  And below this Figure is fix'd a Square of black Marble with the following Lines  Hic manus ob patriam pugnando vulnera passi  Quique pii vates Phoebo digna locuti  Inventas aut qui vitam excoluere per artes  Quique sui memores alios fecere merendo  Thus

Ability began a noble Opposition to an arbitrary Court in Defence of the Liberties of his Country supported them in Parliament and died for them in the Field  Sir JOHN BARNARD With no Inscription  Leaving this incomparably sweet Place with great Regret as every one who sees it must we came to a Monument with this Inscription  Signor FIDO  An  Italian  of good Extraction who came into  England  not to bite us like most of his Countrymen but to gain an honourable Livelihood he hunted not after Fame yet acquired it regardless of the Praise of his Friends but most sensible of their Love Tho' he

was a perfect Philosopher a faithful Friend and an agreeable Companion a loving Husband and distinguished by a numerous Offspring all which he lived to see take good Courses and in his Oldage retired  to the House of a Clergyman in the Country where he finished his earthly Race and died an Honour and Example to the whole Species Reader this Stone is guiltless of Flattery for he to whom it was inscribed was not a Man but a  Crossing the Field to the  Gothick  Building before described we had a boundless Prospect round the Building From hence we descended a fine Hill and on our Lefthand saw a Plantation of Evergreens on our Right the Well designed and Rivers described from the Pavilion This Walk led us down to a very handsome Bridge over one of the Rivers The Roof on the Side facing the Water is supported by  Ionick  Columns the Backside of it by an  AltoRelievo  of the Four Quarters of the World bringing their Products to  Britannia  Here are likewise painted by Mr  Sleats  Sir  Walter Ralegh  with a Map of  Virginia  in his Hand and Sir  William Penn  holding a Book styled  The Laws of  Pensylvania Here are besides a great many modern and antique Bustoes of Marble  We now visited the  Imperial  Closet which is a Room very near the Form of a Cube and in it are the three following Figures painted at full Length by Mr  Sleats  IMP TITUS CAES VESPASIAN  With his Saying over his Head  Diem perdidi I have lost a Day    IMP TRAJAN CAES  With his Saying  Pro me si merear in me For me but if I deserve it against me  IMP MARCUS AURELIUS CAESAR ANTONINUS  With his Saying  Ita regas imperator ut privatus regi velis So govern when an Emperor as if a private Person you would desire to be governed  Passing a noble Iron Gate at the End of a fine Terrace of Feet in Length and Breadth proportionable which leads to the  Veneris Hortus  we came to the Temple of  Friendship  a lofty square Building of the  Dorick  Order with Three noble Porticoes on the Sides which appear to the Garden The Cave and Ceiling are painted with Historypieces by Mr  Sleats  At the Bottom of the Room are placed Ten Pedestals which are designed for the Bustoes of his Lordship and Nine of his select Friends Those of his Royal Highness the Prince of  Wales  the Earl of  Chesterfield  Lord  Cobham  and Mr  William Pitt  are already erected but who the other are to be is not yet known  The Pebble Alcove is a neat Recess and very artfully imbellished with Pebbles His Lordship's Arms are performed with the same and display'd in proper Colours  Congreve  's Monument is an Urn which with great Art expresses the Genius of the Man and at the Top of it is placed a Monkey beholding himself in a Mirror and under him this Writing  Vitae imitatio  Consuetudinis speculum  Comoedia  That is  Comedy is the Imitation of Life and the Glass of Fashion  The Poet's Effigies lying in a careless Posture has the following Inscription  Ingenio  Aeri faceto expolito  Moribusque  Urbanis candidis

Monument of his Loss of the piercing elegant polished Wit and civilized candid most unaffected Manners of  WILLIAM CONGREVE  We were now very near the Pavilions and in going to them walked by the Side of the River and Octagon passing on our Lefthand Three  Satyrs  and a  Dancing Venus    I have now gone round giving you a faint Description of an unparalleled Chain of artificial and natural Beauty and to make use of Mr  Pope  's Lines  Here Order in Variety you see  Where all things differ yet where all agree  His Lordship's Judgment and refin'd Taste are not less conspicuous in his Woods and Park  Vol II p  Instead of what is there said of the Earl of  Burlington  's Seat at  Chiswick  insert the following  BUT I must not pass over so slightly the noble Seat of the Right Honourable the Earl of  Burlington  which was a plain useful House with a Number of good Offices about it but as a Part of the old House was destroyed some Years ago by Fire his Lordship erected a most beautiful Villa near to  the old House which for Elegance of Taste surpasses every thing of its kind in  England  if not in  Europe  The Court in Front of the House is of a proportionable Size to the Building which is gravelled and kept always very neat On each Side are Yew Hedges in Panels with  Termini  placed at proper Distance in Front of which are planted two Rows of Cedars of  Libanus  which at present have a fine Effect to the Eye at a small Distance from the House for the dark Shade of these solemn evergreen Trees occasions a fine Contraste with the elegant white Building which appears between them  The Ascent to the House is by a noble Flight of Stone Steps on one Side of which is the Statue of  Inigo Jones  and on the other that of  Palladio  The Portico is supported by fine fluted Pillars of the  Corinthian  Order and the Cornice Frize and Architrave are as rich as possible so that the Front of this Building strikes every Person tho' not a nice Judge of Architecture with uncommon Pleasure  The other Front towards the Garden is plainer but yet is very bold and grand having a pleasing Simplicity as hath also the SideFront toward the  Serpentine River  which is different from the other Two  The Inside of the House is finished in the highest Taste the Ceilings being richly gilt and painted and the Rooms are filled with some of the best Pictures in  Europe  and tho' the House is small yet it would take up more Room than can be allowed here to describe the particular Beauties of it  The Gardens are also laid out in an elegant Taste When you descend from the House you enter on a Lawn of Grass planted with Clumps of evergreen Trees between which are two Rows of large Stone Vases At the Ends next the House are two fine Wolves in Stone cut by Mr  Sceidmaker  the famous Statuary and at the farther End are two large Lions and to terminate this View are three  fine antique Statues which were dug up in  Adrian  's Garden at  Rome  with Stone Seats between each and on the Back of the Statues is a close Plantation of Evergreens which terminates the Prospect  On the Righthand as you go from the House you look thro' an open Grove of Foresttrees to the Orangery which is separated from the Lawn by a Faussee to secure the Orangetrees from being injured by Persons who are admitted to walk in the Garden so that they are seen as perfectly and when the Orangetrees are in Flower the Scent is diffused over the whole Lawn to the House as if the Trees were placed on the Lawn  On the Lefthand you have an easy Slope of Grass down to the Serpentine River on the Side of which are Clumps of Evergreens which make agreeable Breaks to the Eye between which the Water is seen and at the farther End is a Peep into an Inclosure where are an Obelisk and a  Roman  Temple with Grass Slopes and a circular Piece of Water in the Middle  From this Lawn you are led to the Wilderness through which are three strait Avenues terminated by three different Buildings and within the Quarters are Serpentine Walks thro' which you may walk near a Mile in constant Shade  On each Side the Serpentine River is a Grass Walk which follow the Turns of the River and on the Righthand of the River is a Building which is the exact Model of the Portico of  Covent Garden  Church and on the Left is a Wilderness which is laid out in regular Walks with clipp'd Hedges on each Side which is too mean for the other Parts of the Garden and it is much to be wondered his Lordship should suffer them to remain in the present Form  Over the River in the middle Part is a  Palladian  Bridge of Wood which his Lordship crosses in his  Coach to come round to the House for there is a Coach Road thro' the Garden by which his Lordship passes when he comes from  London  so that the Earl seldom goes thro' the Town of  Chiswick  to his House  At the End of the River next the Road is a fine Cascade lately erected which by an Engine to raise the Water his Lordship proposed to have a constant Fall into the River but the Engine failing it is but seldom the Cascade can play and then but for a short time  Next the Road his Lordship has raised a Terrace with the Earth which came out of the River from whence you have a Prospect of the adjacent Country and when the Tide is up you see the Water of the  Thames  with the Boats and Barges passing which greatly enlivens the Prospect In a Word there is more Variety in this Garden than can be found in any other of the same Size in  England  or perhaps in  Europe    To the preceding Account of the Lord  Burlington  's Seat at  Chiswick  I shall subjoin the following Description of  GunnersburyHouse  IT is situated near  Ealing  between the two great Western Roads and stands on an Eminence the Ground falling gradually from it to the  Brentford  Road so that from the Portico in the Backfront of the House you have an exceeding fine Prospect of the County of  Surrey  the River of  Thames  and all the Meadows on the Borders for some Miles as also a good Prospect of  London  in clear Weather This House was built by Mr  Web  who was Soninlaw to the famous  Inigo Jones  and indeed the Architecture shews it was contrived by him or at least by a Scholar of his for altho' the Building is as plain on the Outside as possible yet there is a simple  Boldness in it which graces all the Buildings of  Inigo Jones  rarely to be found in the Works of other Architects The Apartments in the House are extremely convenient and well contrived The Hall is very large having Rows of Columns on each Side From thence you ascend by a noble Flight of Stairs to a Salon which is a double Cube of Twentyfive Feet This Room the present Possessor  Henry Furness    Esq  is fitting up in a most elegant Taste and he is possessed of a fine Collection of capital Pictures so he proposes to hang this Room intirely with them which when finished will render it one of the finest Rooms in  England    From this Room is the Entrance to the Portico on the Backfront of the House which is supported by Columns and is a delightful Place to sit in in the Afternoon during the Summer Season for as it faces the Southeast so the Sun is gone from it by two o' the Clock and shining on the Country which is open to the View renders the Prospect very delightful  Upon going out of the House into the Garden you come upon a noble Terrace the whole Width of the Garden from whence you have a fine Prospect of the neighbouring Country and on which you may walk dry after the greatest Rains from this Terrace you descend to the Garden by a noble Flight of Stone Steps the upper Part of which is concave and the lower convex with a noble Stone Balustrade on each Side as also upon the Coping of the Wall the Length of the House which makes a fine Appearance from the Road but the Gardens are laid out too plain having the Walls in View on every Side and at present the Offices are too mean for the House which I hear the present Possessor intends to alter in a most elegant Taste which will render it the finest Seat near  London    Vol I p  AT  Peckham  is the Seat of the late Lord  Trevor  which was built in the Reign of King  James  II by Sir  Thomas Bond  who was deeply engaged with that unfortunate Prince in his Schemes and was obliged to quit the Kingdom with him so the House was plundered by the Populace and became a Forfeit to the Crown In the Building and the Gardens large Sums of Money were expended for the Whole was executed according to the politest Taste of those Times The Front of the House stands to the North having Two Rows of large Elmtrees of a considerable Length before it thro' which the Tower of  London  appears as a Termination to the Prospect but on each Side of this Avenue you have a View of  London  from  Westminster  to  Greenwich  and at high Water the Masts of the Vessels on the River of  Thames  appear over the Trees and Houses like a Wood which greatly improves the Prospect The Fields in Front and on each Side of the House being well cultivated render them very agreeable and the Town of  Peckham  lies on the Backside of the Gardens but is shut out from the View by Plantations The Wilderness indeed was planted too regular having diagonal Walks intersecting each other with Hedges on each Side but this was the Taste which prevailed when those Gardens were laid out The Kitchengarden and the Walls were planted with the choicest Fruittrees from  France  and an experienced Fruitgardener was sent for from  Paris  to have the Management of them so that the Collection of Fruits in this Garden has been accounted one of the best in  England    A private Gentleman purchased this Seat soon after the Death of the late Lord  Trevor  and had begun  to make very great Alterations particularly in cutting down Hedges removing Walls and Buildings which intercepted the Prospect of the neighbouring Fields and had the Gentleman lived a few Years longer he would have intirely altered it to the modern Taste of Gardening and rendred it a sweet Retirement considering its Vicinity to  London    Vol I p  after Line add as follows  IN the Year on the Promotion of Dr  Gilbert  Dean of this Church to the Bishoprick of  Llandaff  his Majesty was pleas'd to confer the Deanry on Dr  Alured Clarke  who was installed in the Month of  January  in that Year and if we may be allowed to judge from the pious Acts he began with in that Station a more worthy Man could not have been preferr'd thereto  The House an antient Building belonging to that Dignity had thro' the Remissness of its former Possessors been too long neglected wherefore his First Work was to set about altering and repairing that which he did within Nine Months of his Installment at an Expence of about  l  Before this was perfected  viz  in the Spring he drew up and published Proposals for founding an Hospital in this City for Lodging Dieting and Curing the Sick and Lame Poor thereof and of the County of  Devon  on the like Plan of that which he had before founded at  Winchester  for the Benefit of that City and County of  Hants  A Design so good recommended by the pious Eloquence of a Divine so learned and judicious on Views so visibly disinterested and so clearly abstracted from all Party Schemes or Intentions met with the general Applause and Assistance of the Gentry and Clergy of all Parties Sects and Denominations who however  different in Religion and Politicks unanimously join'd in this pious Undertaking and a Subscription being opened in  March  hath already  November  brought in about  l  of which near  l  are annual Engagements which 'tis highly probable will be not only continued but much augmented so that 'tis hoped that Patients at a time may be provided for  John Tuckfield  of  Raddon    Esq  was pleased to accommodate the Governors with a Plot of Ground near  Southernhay  without the Citywalls at a very moderate Price and to give  l  towards carrying on the Building for the intended Hospital the Plan of which was commodiously designed by the Direction of the Dean and the First Stone thereof laid by him assisted by the Bishop of  Exon  Sir  William Courtenay  Knight of the Shire Sir  Henry Northcote  and  Humphry Sydenham    Esq  the Citizens in Parliament the Honourable  Henry Rolle  and  John Tuckfield    Esq  attended by a great Number of Clergy and Gentry that are Subscribers and Thousands of joyful Spectators on the th of  August  The Building contains upwards of Feet in Length and is already in a good Forwardness In digging the Ground for the Foundation the Workmen found a  Roman  Coin of  Nerva  and another of  Constantine    The Charityschools founded here by the pious Bishop  Blackall  in the Year the good Dean not only bountifully subscribed to but preached a Sermon before a large Assembly of Governors and Contributors and after the Sermon at a Court held for that Purpose inspected the Rules inquired into the Causes of Complaint and prevail'd on the Governors to visit the Schools oftener and diligently endeavour to render that Charity as useful as possible  Vol I p  AT  Painshill  near  Cobham  in  Surrey  is the Seat of the Hon  Charles Hamilton  where is a great Improvement making by inclosing a large Tract of Land designed for a Park which was most of it so poor as not to produce any thing but  Heath  and  Broom  but by burning of the  Heath  and spreading of the Ashes on the Ground a Crop of  Turneps  was obtained and by feeding Sheep on the  Turneps  their Dung become a good Manure to the Land so that a good Sward of Grass is now upon the Land where it was judged by most People impossible to get any Herbage This is the sort of Improvement which was mentioned in  Norfolk  where Land has been raised from Five Shillings an Acre  per Ann  to Thirty or Forty Shillings and were this sort of Husbandry practised in many other Parts of  England  it would be of great Service to the Publick and greatly increase the Value of the Lands to the Proprietor  And this leads me to a Reflection on the present advanced Price of  Butter  and  Cheese    Anno  which many People attribute intirely to the Two last hard Winters and the succeeding dry Summers which must be allowed have greatly contributed towards it yet these are not the only Causes of it but there has of late Years been a great Neglect of the Dairyfarms either from the Poverty of the Farmers who could not keep up their Stock of Cows or by ploughing too much of their Grassground for raising of Corn And many Landlords it is to be feared have permitted their Tenants to break up too much of their Land for Corn because of the great Demand there has been for it abroad of late Years and this has enabled their Tenants to pay their Rent better than otherwise they could have done  But the Consequence will be severely felt for some Years for as the Farmers Stock of Cattle has been reduced greatly by this Alteration in the Husbandry  so it will be impossible for them to get Manure enough to keep their Land in Heart and when this fresh Ground is worn out by Crops the yearly Value of it will be reduced to less than one Third of what it has produced so that it is greatly to be feared most of the Estates in  England  will be lessened in their Rent and unless the Owners will be at some Expence to lay down properly a Proportion of their Lands for Grass they can hardly expect ever to see a proper Sward on their Estates for the Farmers in general have not the least Skill in this particular Branch of Husbandry  But to return from this Digression The Lands which Mr  Hamilton  has inclosed have fine Inequalities for every Yards there are great Hollows then rising Grounds again so that the Prospect is continually changing as you walk over it and if we may guess by what this Gentleman has already done the Whole will be laid out conformable to the natural Situation of the Ground and when the Plantations which are already made are grown up it will be a delightful Place and this upon a Spot of Ground which lay almost neglected before this Gentleman became possessed of it so that whatever is here laid cut will be intirely an Improvement since without it the Land would have produced very little Rent to the Proprietor And would the Gentlemen who inclose large Tracts of Land into Parks follow this Gentleman's Method of inclosing such Land as is of little Value and improve it by making a good Sward upon it their Estates would be greatly benefited by it  The House which at present is on this Spot is very small being what Mr  Hamilton  found built on it by his Predecessor to which he has only added one handsome Room on the Backside which is elegantly fitted up and completely furnished with good Pictures but as there are so many better Situations  for a House in the middle of the Park so it is supposed this Gentleman will erect a new Mansionhouse answerable to the Design of his Plantations  The River  Mole  which rises near  Darking  passes along by the Side of this Park and in its Course serpents about in so pretty a manner as that you frequently lose the Sight of it and by its Windings make the Course almost Four Miles within the Compass of this Inclosure Indeed this River is very narrow and in dry Weather the Current is exceeding slow and the Water not well coloured which it must be allowed takes off from its Beauty yet there is room for great Improvements by sloping off the Banks so as to have a better View of the Water and in many Places by taking away some of the little Projection of the Banks it may be widened so as to appear considerable at some Distance which if done will add much to the Beauty of the Place  Near this Place is the House of Mr  Bridges  which is built in a very singular Taste something after the Model of an  Italian Villa  but very plain on the Outside The Apartments within seem very commodious and the principal Rooms are elegantly fitted up the Ceilings being gilt and all the Members are richly ornamented the Offices below are very convenient and judiciously contrived to answer the Purposes for which they were designed But what chiefly struck my Curiosity on seeing it was a false Story contrived on each Side of the House taken from the Difference in the Height of the Siderooms from those principal Apartments and these are converted into long Galleries with a small Apartment at one End which affords a Communication between them In the  Attick  Story there are very good Lodgingrooms which are well laid together so that for the Size of this House there is hardly any other near  London  which has more useful and elegant Apartments  The Situation of the House is on an Eminence so that it commands the Prospect of the adjacent Fields which are kept in very exact Order and there is a Declivity from the House to the River  Mole  which passes along by the Side of this Gentleman's Garden and here it appears much more considerable than in any other Part of its Course for Mr  Bridges  has taken away so much of the Earth of the Banks as to make the River in some Places Four or Five times broader than it was naturally so that it makes a handsome Appearance And by the Side of the Water he has disposed the Earth into a natural Slope with a broad Grasswalk planted with sweet Shrubs on each Side and at the End of the Walk is a fine Room which has a View of the Water lengthwise and is a sweet Retreat in hot Weather being shaded by large Elmtrees on the Southside and having the Water on the North and Eastsides which renders it very cool and pleasant This House is situated about half a Mile from the publick Road to  Portsmouth  and is so much hid by the Trees near it as not to be seen until you rise on the Common or Heath beyond  Cobham  where in several Parts of the Road between that and  Ripley  you have a fine View of it  Vol I p  FROM  Blandford  I took a Turn to view one of the largest and most stately new Fabricks in the Kingdom I mean the House or rather Palace belonging to the Right Hon  George Dodington    Esq  It is situated in the Parish of  Gunville  Four Miles from  Blandford  and Six from  Shaftesbury  and  Cranborn  The House Gardens and Park containing in all about Eight Miles in Circumference are now named  Eastbury    It is a vast and magnificent Structure its very Offices at a Distance resembling no inconsiderable  Parish You approach it through one of the most beautiful Lawns which the Imagination can conceive and passing through the grand Court on each Side of which the Offices are ranged in treble Rows from four Bass Courts a most stately Portico presents itself supported by large and beautiful Pillars Here you ascend by many Steps between the Statues of Two Sphinxes and having passed the Area of the Portico you enter a most magnificent Hall adorned with many Statues and Bustoes and its Roof painted in a most delicate Taste  Hence you proceed to the Salon one of the noblest Rooms in  Europe  and which with its fine Proportion no less than the Splendor of its Gilding cannot but strike the most indifferent Beholder  At one End of this Salon is a princely Apartment consisting of Three large Rooms furnished one with Crimson another with flowered Velvet and the third with Satin all richly laced with Gold At the other End of the Salon is a Drawingroom and very large Diningroom both magnificently gilt as is indeed every Room in this Floor except only the Hall  The First Floor above Stairs is distributed into several grand Apartments but as it is not our Intention nor have we Room to describe it minutely we shall pass to the Gardens which are laid out with surprising Art but what is most remarkable in them is the vast Collection of foreign Trees of various Kinds the beautiful Verdure of the Walks in the midst of a Country whose Turf is of another Colour especially in Summer This House was begun by the late Mr  Dodington  and finished by the present The Architect was Sir  John Vanbrugh    THE
