there are so many Impostors and Imitators Abroad it is highly requisite the Public should be satisfied that this is the true and genuine  Dunciad  of Mrs  Mary Midnight  to which End I have wrote this short Preface The Reader therefore is desir'd to attend to me with a little Patience before he enters upon this great and wonderful Work The extensive Fame our Author has gain'd by her  learned Lucubrations  in all the  Courts  and  Universities  in  Europe  has excited many who have by some Means or other met with some of her Fragments to vend among them their Heaps of Trash in her Name but it is hop'd the World will do her the Justice to think she is not the Author of such poor paultry wishy washy shimsham Performances  To reward among many others the Authors of such Proceedings in a Manner due to their Deserts Mrs  Midnight  has design'd and executed this Work but as an Affair of so much Consequence could not but get Air in the World several of these who were conscious of their Guilt applied to her to  be excus'd a Place  or in other Words  to be left out  of her  Dunciad  Among which came the celebrated  Pentweazle  and meanly offer'd her  five Guineas  in part on Subscription to her Miscellany of Poems to be publish'd some Time in  February  next But Mrs  Midnight  being above any mercenary View was deaf to all Overtures however considerable of this kind Upon which with their usual Assurance her Enemies advertis'd even this intended Work  the Old Woman's Dunciad  in her's and in my Name intending to impose some Trumpery or other on the World before this Poem could appear and with the most consummate Impudence put out Advertisements against the fictitious  Imitators of Mrs  Midnight's  Works to outface if possible the very Truth itself But we have thro' a surprising Quickness of Genius peculiar to our Author anticipated their Designs to their utter Confusion Since the World will by reading the following Work be convinc'd of the genuine and elevated Spirit of Mrs  Midnight  and will not for the future be so easily impos'd on I shall just add a Word or two on our Author's Character in general and on this Work in particular As to Mrs  Midnight's  Reputation as an Author notwithstanding she has made herself known but lately under that Name yet it has been very extensive under the more general one of  Old Woman  she having had the principal Hand in most of the Performances that have been wrote within these few Years past all which have been infallibly known by the Critics who upon Perusal of them have immediately laid them down and crying out  the Author's  an  Old Woman  intimating thereby their Knowledge of her Works and her establish'd Reputation that rais'd them above Criticism As to this Poem in particular the Publick can never enough acknowledge the Obligations they owe her in these Improvements of our Language which however fall vastly short of what she purposes to do having selected several thousands of the most curious and copious in the  See Eulogium on the  Welch  Tongue  Cambria  Book II Line  Gemerian  or  Welch  Tongue which will far exceed any Embellishment whatsoever drawn from the  Greek  or  Latin  MARGELINA SCRIBELINDA MACULARIA  THE Old Woman's DUNCIAD  O Thou whatever Title to thine Ear  Whether  Tom Jones Joe Andrews  or what not  Sound pleasing thou to my aspiring Song  Indulgent smile while to high  Pindus  Top  Line I  O thou c  Our judicious and learned Author Mrs  Midnight  seems at first setting out to give us an Instance that she knows what she is about by this Imitation of the great Satyrist Mr  Pope  in whose  Dunciad  are the following Lines address'd to  Swift  as are the above to  Fielding  O thou whatever Title please thine Ear  Swift Drapier Bickerstaff  or

Instance of the superexcellent Beauty of Expression made use of by our modern Poets in endeavouring to make our Tongue so nearly resemble that truly noble and elevated Language the Latin  Martina Scribeinda Macularia  Line  Of Nose obesetesnotty Noses  This Epithet which as a compound one is not a little to be commended is yet more admirable as it has its Derivation from the  Latin  in which Language a judicious and witty Man is signified by a Man with his  Nose wip'd  and a Blockhead by a Fellow with a nasty or  fat Nose  according to our vulgar Phrase a  snotty  one  Martina Scribelinda Macularia  Line  Cull more Flowersnor Rosemary cull  The Text is here extremely well express'd in the Interpretation as the so often repeated Thought of the Muses gathering Flowers upon the Banks of the River  Avon  for  Shakespear  can certainly mean no more than the old fashioned Custom of gathering Rosemary for the DeadThe Reader may find the above Thought in the  Pleasures of Imagination  also in a late Piece called the  Rosciad  and many others whose Merit is a sufficient Reason I suppose for its being inserted here  For high on Pegasean Wing I mean  To soar velocitate O swifter far  Than fleet the winged Atoms in the Air  When Auster its Euroclydon dilates  Or when pervading Night excessive pours  The Twilight dun with archimagic Art  A thrice repeated Charm by  Hecate  taught  The Dame venefic on a Virgult borne  Or courser stramentitious Aether Wings  Line  When Austor  its  Euroclydon dilates  Mrs  Midnight  is here openly indebted to the Author of the  Rosciad  Line We have before observed the Beauty of  Latinizing  our Language we have in this Line a happy Instance of both  Greek  and  Latin  without the least Variation in the Idiom becoming easy and flowing English very intelligible to the  meanest  Reader and notwithstanding the Herd of Critics of  low  Taste inveigh bitterly against this Practice and call it a bastardiz'd Innovation of Dialect I advise all who would make any Figure in these Days to lug in by the Ears all Manner of uncommon Phrases and Epithets they can lay hold of and subject them to their own Use as lawful Prizes  Margelina Scribelinda Macularia  Thanks to the Power of Verse lo now I soar  And lo the House of Dullness is in view  See tow'ring  Paul's  eeclesiastic Dome  Its Head rears altitudinate O far  The meaner

of that surprizing Beauty in this Line by the Position of the Preposition  above  it seeming to me that she has borrowed the Hint from the celebrated Dr  Young  whose Elegances of that Kind are numerous he says if I mistake not  Life is a Stage  Inch high the Grave above  Line  Like Alps on Alps  c This and the following Line are taken from  Cambria  where they seem to be the Effect to use the Author's own Words of a Regard for  A Land renown'd of old for nobelst Deeds  For which Reason every Mountain must be the highest in the World as he says  The  Pyrenoeans Appenine  and  Alps  With meaner Altitude invade the Skies  Than  Cambrian  Mountains  Now it is not to be supposed that the Author has ever seen  Italy France  or  Spain  or that he has taken the Altitude of his own Country Hills with the BarometerNo Reader there is a Figure in  Rhetoric  called the  Hyperbole  by which a Man may assert what he knows nothing at all of and tell as many Lies as he pleasesIt is by this Figure Reader that Mrs  Midnight  has ornamented her Poem by this Simile from the above famous Writer for it is impossible she should know so little as to imagine the  Alps  c stand in the same Comparison below the  Welch  Mountains as the common Parish Churches do to St  Paul'sMargelina Seribelinda Macularia  High as  Olympus  lose in airy Height  Their Heads as antient as the Pen of Time

on  Line  As antient as the Pen of Time  Endless have been the Disputes that Mrs  Midnight  has had with some Critics to which she has communicated this Design on this Passage they assert that it is the first Time  Time  ever was taken for an Author as giving him a Pen seems to imitate he is but that on the contrary they are a Set of People he has a mortal Aversion to as they are Enemies to his Employment by immortalizing those very Persons and Things he endeavours to erasein answer to this let them only see  Cambria  Line Book I and be satisfied from the Credit of that Author of its Propriety whose very Words she has borrow'd  Margelina Scribelinda Macularia  Rushing sonorous Falls the hoarse Cascade  Th' illucid Lapse adown with Torrent thick  Regurgling lutulent The Cave within  The torpid Wretch by igneal Glimmer seen  Line  Th' illucid Lopse  c The Reader may observe how our Author has imitated the great Men of our own Day in five or six of the preceding Lines in which she has not an  elegant  Word but belongs to some of them Nay she has even almost copied whole Lines from them in particular from  Cambria  and the beautiful Expression of the  lucid Lapse  from the  Excursion  of Mr  Mallet  I am somewhat surprized however that Mrs  Midnight  could condescend to imitate in so unpoetical a Line as  There is a Cave fast by this House of Pray'r  a Writer of so little Credit in Point of Language as  Milton  since it might have been modernized beautifully thus  This Deme eretial near a Cave exists  but there is no Work as Mr  Pope  says without some Blemish  Whoever thinks a faultless Piece to see  Thinks what ne'er was nor is nor e'er shall be  it is therefore excuseable if in a Poem like this so  crammed  with Beauties there should he found  one  Fault  Line  The torpid Wretch  The Reader to taste the Beauty of this Picture and come to a right Understanding of our Author must turn to the Frontispiece of the  Old Woman's Magazine  a Work of which Notice has been taken in our Preface where he will find the Pictures of  Dullness  and  Poverty  represented under the Characters of Mrs  Mary Midnight  and her Consederate  Succubus Canidia  See Front to  Old Wom Mag  and Page No III  With  Succubus Canidia  by that Name  If rightly she be call'd sit hov'ring So  In culmiferous Fields or frondose Woods  With all their Opulence and native Worth  Th' Egyptian Tribe itinerant repose  At prandial Noon and dire mundungus Fume  Line  By that Name  c It is a Matter of no little Dispute whether the Consederate of  Dullness  should be called  Succubus Canidia  the  Christian  Name signifying a Devil in the Shape of an old Woman and the Surname being taken from that of a  Neapolitan Jezebel  whom  Horace  calls a Witch the Query is since we know the Figure represented is  Poverty  whether  Poverty  can be justly called a Witch Some have asserted yes because Witches are always poor and old But this is consuted by the learned and judicious Author of the  Spectator  who says that tho' Poverty and Age make Women  suspected  of being Witches it is nevertheless no  Proof  of their being so And as to  Shakespear's  representing his Witches in this Manner every Body knows his poetical Genius never consined himself to historical Truth It is in fine so abstruse and intricate a Point that tho' I have consulted  Glanville Moreton  and others I must leave it to the Decision of abler Critics  Line  In culmiferous  c The Propriety of these Epithets are admirable and particularly consonant to  Horace's  Rule they seem to be borrow'd from  Cambria  and are not a little akin to the Author of this Line  And tam'd the rough Ferocity of Men  ROSCIAD  here we see the Beauty of the  latinized English  since it would else have been the  rough Roughness  which would have been a very  rough  Expression indeed  Martina Scribelinda Macularia  So they the lov'd Nicotian masticate  Or thro' Shiptonian Syrinx it inhale  Fumifical while in her better Hand  The Goddess a Pyxidicule sustains  And Autographs and Schedals grace her Right  Her daily Lucubrations Thoughts prelaute  Thoughts which her meditative Owl inspires  Line  In her better Hand  Doubtless many People will wonder why the  Left  Hand should be here expressed by the  better  and will dispute why one Hand is better than the other but Mrs  Midnight  has not wrote this without a Precedent the Reader will find this same Epithet in the  Rosciad  Ver to specify the Right Hand which she has here given to the Left admirably intimating that  Dullness  is Lefthanded or in other Terms unlucky  Martina Scribelinda Macularia  Line  Daily Lucubrations  The Reader will do well to consider that as  Dullness  lives in a Cellar it is no Wonder she burns Candle in the DayTimebeside the Text says they are Thoughts her Owl inspires And who knows but her Owl may be in as bad a Situation as Mr  Smart  who wanted Light to see that it was dark as a late Epigram intimatesSee  Kapelion  No It is however certain that all Authors have not the clearest Ideas of Day and NightYou will find in the  Rosciad  that at  Night  The  lunar  Queen  Shines forth with Splendor round the dimmer  Day  Line  Thoughts prelaute  Doubtless the Critics of a fine Ear for the Flow of Verse will be as much offended at the disagreeable Sound I might have said Cacophony of these two open Words coming together as were the fine tympanum'd Gentry in the Court of  Angustus  against a certain Line in  Virgil  which as I don't remember I must pass over but Mrs  Midnight  has in this shewn her Respect for the Modernizes of PoetryI will give you an InstanceA certain Writer who stands much on his Merit in this Point has used often these two Words together  natal Land  Now there is a surprising Harshness in the two Els and almost an Impossibility of pronouncing them both without making a Stop between the WordsIt is true Mr  Rowe  with wonderful Sweetness has used the Word  native here  More than myself I prize my native Land  Here now is a softening Syllable to harmonize the Strength of the preceding and following onesbut what of this  Native  is a vulgar Word and every Consideration should be given up for an Epithet obsolete or uncommon as the abovementioned Refiner of plain  English  has shewn us such as  Patriotic  WorthTreaty of  Pacification  and numberless othersit must be owned  Patriot worthTreaty of Peace  would be equally expressive and a thousand Times more elegant and beautiful but as that would be a common Way of Speech the Dignity of the Language would have been degraded  For he the Sodale of her studious Hours  Sung ululatious contemplating deep  Bright Contemplation dignate of himself  Illustrious Son of  Hebetudo  's Race  O all ye num'rous Tribe who in her Cave  Delight to dwell of you the Muse shall sing  The Verse as a Mnemosynum accept  And erst with poplicolal Hand repay  Within this sacred Cave where  Hebes  dwells

Thought on Thought  As 'tween his Nods meditabundate Want  And Hunger gaunt awake his bardate Soul  Line  Steed pendent  It is probable some of the witty Gentlemen of the present Age may laugh here and accuse the Author of  Hibernianism  and say it is only a mean Imitation of a Saying of the celebrated  Barnaby Buxtm  who told an Acquaintance  he steed like a Man hanging in Chains  But with Submission to these facetious Critics if they reflect upon the Situation of a Bird perched in a hanging Cage it is possible they may reconcile this Passage to  English  Line  As'tween her Nods  This is a true and lively Image of any Author who writes for Pay whose Genius is never awake but when he is hungry  Ah Miser those who fall in Dulness snare  More fatal hers than  Circe's  Charms of Yore

hapless once solertial Smart  Line  How  Ebenezer  Ebenezer Pentweazle of Truro  in the County of  Cornwall  Esq  a celebrated Epigrammatist  Line  Into bubonic Form  The Metamorphosis of  Pentweazle  into an Owl is so admirably fancied that I can't help preferring it to every thing I have met with in  Ovid  The Similitude of an Author's being confined to Study in his or his Bookseller's Garret for Means of Livelihood is prodigiously similar to an Owl's perching on the Beam of a Barn meditating on the Mice which she is to have  if she can catch them  Line  Solertial Smart  This Passage bears some Dispute as it is questioned by many whether there should be a Comma between these two WordsSome assert the former to be an Adjective and the last a Substantive and suspect Mrs  Midnight  of a Pun in Heroics others will have the Comma stand and assert they are hoth Adjectives I have considered the Point very seriously and finding so many Reasons on both Sides must leave it to the Decision of the  Grammarians  He laugh'd and sung e'er yet  Canidia  curst  Her macerated Corps in Sacell laid  Where in the Form of  Vacuum  she dwelt  And banish'd ev'ry  Golden Rhyming  Thought  Just then in fatal Hour grave  Hebes  woke  And in her leaden Hand a Crustule bore  Line  Woere in the Form of Vacuum  It is likely many of our Brother Authors especially those of the mathematical and philosophical Turn will very learnedly and wittily ask in what Form is the Form of nothing however I must confess for my own part that I think Mrs  Midnight  goes in this Place as infinitely beyond herself as all other Authors have fallen short of herthis is a very bold and caring Expression and is beyond Criticism itself and whether the Writers of the present Day will allow the Beauty and Justice of this Passage or not they have undoubtedly often experienced it So that I think their Disputes of the Existence of a Vacuum in the Universe would be better supplied by a Study to destroy the Vacuum they find in their Pockets  Line  Golden rhyming Thought  Notwithstanding  Tom Brown  has written a long and learned Dissertation in Praise of Poverty and Mr  Moore  an admirable Fable to prove that  Want  is ths greatest Help to Genius yet there are few even Poets I believe but think the jingling of one Guinea against another infinitely better Rhime than  Pope Gay  or  Moore  ever wrote in their Lives and would approve a Bank Note of an hundred Pounds as the best Prose they ever read Nay I believe with a little Persuasion Mr  Rt  himself would be brought to accept it notwithstanding there should be no hard Word in it  Charm more coercive to th' inedial  Goût  Then noctial Incantation of an Hag  Than orient Tal'sman or mysterious Cast  By learn'd  Genethliac  made Ah luckless Ah  He took and eat and from that Moment sunk  Mancipial Immolation to her Will  And now whene'er the Coenal Hour is nigh  Behold her potent Wand her Paxil waves  And he in Cell sublime a Bird of Night

Anicular he verrates coenal Trash  With miscellaneous Art cracks kernell'd Nuts  Line Or he's pent  Line  In Shape mustelar  This is the second Time in this Work where a Pun may be suspectedin the former Passage I forbore to give my Judgment but here I must own the Words point immediately to the Name  Pentweazle  yet is not this Passage to be degraded since it is only introducing a new and bold Figure called the  Allus  la  which I would recommend to all the Refiners of Language whatever  Margelina Seribelinda Macularia  Line  Cracks kernell'd Nuts  Some of our Readers may perhaps imagine

great deal of Prepriety in his being converted to a Jackdaw as his natural Gift of chattering might probably inspire Dullness with that Intention We are however serry this Misfortune should happen to him before the finishing of the Tragedy he is engaged in as a Work of Nature requires undoubtedly a great deal of Solidity  Line  Rostrate th' ingenial Cloac  This is admirably natural and peculiarly adapted to the Nature of a Jackdaw who is pecking among all the Filth and Rubbish he comes near  Line  Domes too dearly bought  The Gentleman who is the Owner of these Castles and employs this mighty

and Trouble he himself takes to tell People he is a great Man which is undoubtedly the reverse Way to Fame  Line  Manducating Thoughts  Here is not a little Beauty in this Expression which it is probable the Reader of little Penetration will suffer to escape him  chewing Thoughts  intimating hereby that this Author chews his Sentiments so long that they come from him with all the Sweetness

Cud a Picture of Reflection so I never gave myself the Trouble to ask any one what she was thinking of I imagine our Author Mrs  Midnight  is indebted for this Thought to a late Work where is this Passage  Stretch'd in the Clover Ditch saintlowing Herds  Couch ruminant  You see from hence that the Sentiment is however a very  good  one But perhaps this Gentleman as well as Mrs  Midnight  might

vile Conceit in pompous Words exprest Is like a Clown in regal Purple drest An undeniable Proof of the injudicicus Taste of this Author in so material a Point and how widely does he mistake the Truth

the Naiads An Instance as well as Mrs  Midnight  's of  fine Writing  Line  In monomachial War  Our Author seems here to have an Eye to a Passage in the  Kapelion  See  Archimagirus  's Address to his Customers where he challenges his Brother Scribblers to fight them  Pen Ink  and  Paper  upon any Spot of Ground in  England  and sends them the Length of his Quills and the Price of his Paper to shew he scorns to engage them at unequal Weapons  Line  Dunciadus thou  The Reader for an Information concerning this Character may turn to the  Magazines blown up Whimsey Banter  says there  his Bookseller's Sign is his Emblem and that he is the Packhorse of Authors  Another Evidence says  he is a Beast of Prey and loves Carrion and bad Meat  Thou greatest Crocodile and greater yet  Illustrious  Woodville  Ha what do I see  Our eastern  Bramin  raise his virile Hoar  Most venerable with each motley Scribe  Magirist Student Disputant what not  Line  Thou greatest Crocodile and greater yet  A particular Description of all these Characters may be found in the above mentioned PamphletDoubtless the Critics will here fall foul upon Mrs  Midnight  and desire to know if  Crocodile  is  greatest  how  Woodville  can be  greater  but sure Gentlemen it is impossible but you must have heard of the new Degree of Comparison founded on a bold Figure in Rhetorick and called the  supersuperLnive  It is by this that the celebrated Author of the ACTOR says that the  Tragic  Player requires fire in the  greatest  Degree but the  Comic  Player in a much g  ater  Margelina Scribelinda Macularia  Line  Our castern  BRAMINIt is presum'd no Body is ignorant of the celebrated Author of the  Oeconomy of Human Life  whose Name coming from so great a Distance has made the World not a little suspicious of an ImpostureThe contest here pointed at is that between the original  Bramin  and the Authors of  second Parts  Suppliments c which Gentlemen are a Set of Writers who rather than go without a Dinner at all are contented to take up with the Victuals half cold after others have made a Meal yet boast much of their Dining at the same TableIt is however to be disputed

Archimagirus Metaphoricus  Author of the  Kapelion  a Work that requires no Celebration By the  Student  is hinted the Author of a  Sixpenny  Pamphet under that Name published Monthly by the Assistance and Approbation of the two famous  Universities  OXFORD and CAMBRIDGE A surprizing and wonderful Example of the vast and extensive productions of those two great Seminaries both of which we are told are employed in the composing of this PAMPHLET  of important Articles  What then may not the World expect from their joint Assistance in so great a Work  Muse shut the Scene the Soul enslaving Scene  Or  Hebetudo  's potent Wand will make  Ev'n me to nod  Now is that Work compleat that mighty Work  Which dignate in insculptur'd Brass to shine  Or macrocolum typ'd so long shall

wilful Neglect which however would be unpardonable in a Work of less Merit than  this Dunciad Virgil's Aeneids  and some others of equal Worth in this Day  Line  Now is that Work  c Mrs  Midnight  has clos'd this Poem with as much Confidence and as justly as the celebrated  Ovid  whose Words are  Jam opus exegi quod nec jovis ira nec ignis  Nec poterit ferrum nec edax abolere vetustas  The following Lines to the End are borrow'd from the most modest Writer of the present Age  Call it a  Cacosyntheton  or me  Stygmatize with  Hyberbation  Name  But if fond Regard fot modern Verse  Deserve  Exsibilation  or the Frown  Of quaint Derision If 'tis so let loose  The Storm of  Momus  I can bear it all  The Reader will no doubt much approve this Design of Printing the Interpretation to this Work for the Sake of the Herd of Readers who are void of a Taste for the Sublime tho' it was for a much greater End which our celebrated Author intended it and this was the extensive Utility it would be of in our Academies and in particular to the Students of our two  Universities  as she was very sensible this Work would be as now being published it is esteem'd  Classical  and as such be put on the same sooting with  Hemer Virgil Ovid  c and be taught as a Pattern of Language in all the distinguish'd Schools in  Europe Martina Scribelinda Macularia  INTERPRETATION  O thou whatever Name sound easy  Jones Andrews  or what else may please you  Do thou look pleasant on my Rhime  While  Pindus  Top high Top I climb  Of Dunces which the Verse supposes  The Sons of Ink with snotty Noses  I sing nor call our Rhyming Domine  But beg my fav'rite Wench MELPOMENE  My surest Friend of all the Nine  To lend a Hand to this Design  And leave thou  Thaly Avon's  Shore  Nor Rosemary cull for  Shakespear  more  But help my Trot around  Parnassus  Swift on your ambling Nag  Pegasus  Swifter than scamper Snow or Sleet  When Seaman's Plague drives on the Fleet  Or when at Night by Magic

view  Look where the Church of great St  Paul  Rears up its losty Head so tall  Above the Parish Churches all  So  notified  Welch Mountains high  Rear up their Heads above the Sky  Alps Alps  and  Pelion Ossa  pile  The Lord knows how many hundred Mile  But by the nearest Guess that's giv'n  Within Hop Step and Jump of Heav'n  Stand lost in Clouds and Fogs and Rime  As antient as the Pen of Time  Now by this Church there is a Cellar  Where Goddess  Dullness  is the Dweller  So very  low  that it may well  Deserve the Title of a Cell  Its Groundfil a Stone's Throw or more  From where the rushing  common Shore  Runs bubbling down the muddy Place  Roaring with Dirt and Nastiness  Within this Cellar scarce discern'd  By Cinders into Embers burn'd  There hov'ring sits the  Humdrum  Wretch  With  Canid  call'd if right a Witch  As in Corn Fields or leasy Woods  With all their Chattles and their Goods  The wandering Gypsies sit them down  And smoke their Dinner Pipe at Noon  So they the dear Tobacco  Quid  Or suck short Pipe as  Shipton  did  While in the Goddess better Hand  A 'bacco Box is at Command  And the waste Book of common Place  And written Sheets her left doth grace  Her daily Works of Candle Light  Works which her screech Owl doth indite  For he Companion of their Studies  Was us'd to hoot to please the Goddess  In a brown Study always gone  Oh ever worthy  Dullness  Son  O you whoe'er delight to dwell  Within the Threshold of her Cell  Of you the Muse her Song shall tell  Yet in Remembrance beas the Lay  And as the Time may serve repay  Within the Cell where  Dullness  Lives  Constant each Son attendance gives  Let her but nod or wink her Eyes  Whip Presto  in a Trice he flies  Here chief her Owl sedate and Sage  Stands hanging  in his mounted Cage  While Thoughts succeed in nodding Fits  As musing in the Dumps he sits  And Hunger jogs and wakes his Wits  Unlucky those whom  Dullness  curses  Her charms more fatal are than  Circe  's  That made of old such horrid Work  And turn'd  Greek  Sailors into Pork  Say Muse how 'cause it hap'd to please her  From human Form poor  Ebenezer  For some vile End which she had purpos'd  Into an Owl was metamorphos'd  As once was serv'd the tatling son  Ascalaphus  of  Acheron  Late witty  Smart  he laugh'd and sung  E'er curst  Conidia  on him hung  Who meagre in his Pocket crept  And there in form of nothing slept  Whence ev'ry golden Cross she banish'd  And ev'n the Sound of Chinking vanish'd  Then  Dullness  shew'd in Hour accurs'd  Within her leaden Hand a Crust  More pow'rful o'er the hungry Stomach  Than nightly Charm the Witches do make  Then eastern Tal'sman or strange Scrawls  On the learn'd Fortuneteller's Walls  He took and eatLord bless my Eyes  And fell her slavish Sacrifice  And now whene'er he wants a Supper  She waves her pow'rful 'Baccostopper  And he aloft a screech Owl screams  Or gets into his tantrum Dreams  Fancies himself an Eagle there  And raises Castles in the Air  Or else into a  Weazel Pent  He serves the Goddess's intent  Or else in an old Woman seen  Sweeps Rubbish for a  Magazine  Cracks Nuts that have been crack'd before  Or toothless mumbles Grace twice o'er  Next him who next in Point of Knowledge is  Brought up in one of  Oxon  's Colleges  For whom on  Isis  ' Banks the Strumpet  Fame  founded  Student  thro' her Trumpet  Now turn'd into a  Jackdaw  chatters  Or in the  Jakes of Genius  spatters  Or drest in Female Petticoat  Helps Fame to sound a louder Note  While the wise screech Owl in  Chimaera  Builds mighty Castles bought too dear Ah  For here no GroundRent is requir'd  Nor Carvers Work to be admir'd  Nor Glow the Brickkilns piping hot  To bake the Clay trod under foot  And yet by this his Dinner's got  Next Dullness' third and fav'rite Son  Frigidio  bids the Verse go on  Frigidio  fam'd whose great Renown  Fame loudly farts about the Town  See down i' th' Mouth with Brow contracted  With Headach and the Hipdistracted  He sits i' th' Dumps so ruminating  As thoughtless Cows do when they're eating  For ah and oh in filthy Breeches  An Egg fresh laid his Bum bewitches  For what O heav'nly Muse pray tell  This shitten Curse her Child befell  So luck would have't in evil Hour  Smack'em  a wicked Son of a Whore  Enter'd the darksome Cave and told 'em  He'd make the House too hot to hold 'em  Roar'd curst and swore and play'd the Devil  Still threatn'ing some approaching Evil  Just then  Frigidio  's Blood ran cold  And down his Guts loud Grumbles roll'd  That some descending Evil spoke  Which now but who can help ill Luck  He runs t'avoid But ah undone  He finds the Closestool Refuge gone  Amid the Fire behold it blazing  To Cinders burnt Ah most amazing  Now all his Fears behind burst out  And he besmear'd stinks all about  As when  Tom Turdman  on his Cart  Poisons the Night with filthy Art  At first we find the spicy Scent  Perfumes the Nostrils violent  Till the Air cleansing by Degrees  The gently dying Stink decays  Thou Type of  Curl  O fam'd  Carnan  Be thou the Safeguard of the Pan  If any future Force attempt it  And when 'tis full take care to empt it  Or dip thy Fingers in the Flood  And paint and gild with native Mud  Until thy rubrick Post so fine  Shall like a shitten Barndoor shine  But hark what Noise is this I hear  What else remains that's Worth my Care  A Crowd of Scribblers yon in Limbo  Like Oyster Nymphs with Arms akimbo  Lunge with sharppointed Pens as cruel  As palefac'd Beaux do in a Duel  Those chiefly who of late notorious  Knock'd under  Smack'em  's Arm inglorious  Dunciadus Entity  whose Name is  So universal and so famous  Thou  Crocodile  by Name and Nature  The greatest and thou  Woodville  greater  But who the Duce  marry and Amen  Our Eastern venerable  Bramin  Old Father grey Beard's whiten'd Locks  'Mong  Students  Disputants and Cooks  Muse shut the Scene▪ and drop the Curtain  Or even I shall sleep for certain  Now is that mighty Work compleat  That should on Brass be 'graven neat  Or printed on the Royal Sheet  Where lasting Worth shall be admir'd  Till Masters are with Flogging tir'd  Then let no snarling Critic dream  A Trump'ryBallad is my Theme  Or call because they think they're wife  This  Fustian  me a  Fustianizer  But if a Love for modern Verse  Deserve th' unluky Play'rs Curse  Or to be laugh'd at be its Merit  Laugh and be pox'd for I can bear it  FINIS
