 REFLECTIONS ON THE LATE ALARMING BANKRUPTCIES IN SCOTLAND  ADDRESSED To ALL RANKS But particularly to the different Classes of Men from whom Payments may soon be demanded WITH ADVICE to SUCH how to conduct themselves at this Crisis  EDINBURGH Printed in the Year MDCCLXXII and sold by all the Booksellers in Scotland PRICE SIXPENCE  REFLECTIONS ON THE Late alarming BANKRUPTCIES in  Scotland  c c  WAR famine and pestilence used formerly to fill up the number of the general calamities of mankind but in the present age one has been added  viz  Bankruptcy The year will ever be remembered as a year of confusion dismay and distress All  Scotland  has been shaken by a kind of commercial earthquake while like a company connected by an electrical wire the people in every corner of the country have almost instantaneously received the same shock  But it is to be feared that the evil has as yet had very little effect in comparison of what it will have The term of  Martinmas  is just at hand and that of  Candlemas  is not far off at these terms payments must and will be demanded and there is great reason to apprehend that very miserable consequences will ensue  There cannot therefore be a fitter subject than that which I have chosen for a pamphlet  of such a size as to be easily purchased and generally read In times of national distress there have been very useful hints suggested by individuals It is related that during the famous siege of  Leyden  when the inhabitants who then defended themselves with a most determined bravery were meditating a surrender because they were in absolute want of provision an aged citizen of no considerable note stept forth and told them that while there remained an old shoe within the walls they should not give up for that he had for several days supported himself by leather boiled long enough to become tender which though not a very palatable dish afforded sufficient nourishment to prevent him from starving The experiment was made and found to succeed and thus the city was enabled to hold out till relieved by the Prince of  Orange  At such times too the minds of men are more than usually disposed to listen to sober advice and profit by friendly instruction and therefore it may be hoped that these few pages will meet with an agreeable reception  The public odium is at present directed against that class of men called  bankers  but it were to be wished that a proper distinction were made between true and false or real and fictitious bankers Those of the former kind are described in so just and  lively a manner by a writer in England that his words shall be transcribed  Bankers are an honourable and an useful set of men in civil society and absolutely necessary in such a trading nation as ours they in turn trust the Lord the merchant and the mechanic with sums that give life vigour and dispatch to business  Banking is a most laudable useful and advantageous refinement on business It collects together sums of useless cash and brings a large fund into circulation which otherwise must lie unemployed for the time each man may not want it or in other words the Iodgments at a banker's shop are made up of such sums as each of his customers may not want for the present hour The general fund aids every man in turn in proportion to his credit and interchangeably serves each his purposes as their various occasions may at different periods require like a large reservoir made up from small shallow and useless rivulets it supplies all its neighbours in plentiful draughts satisfies their common and extraordinary wants at each man's requisition and then turns that which was before beneficial to no one into a wonderful and extensive advantage  Bankers are generally entitled to confidence by fair character a close attention  to business and by fortunes of their own which not only give security but are interwoven and blended with the credit and various purposes of their customers and friends  Such are real bankers and although we have none exactly such in  Scotland  yet we have among us several merchants who answer the same purposes in somewhat a different form and I shall hold  them  as real bankers on whom we can depend Let us comfort ourselves that we have a few such among us The late convulsions of the commercial world have winnowed our traders and separated the wheat from the chaff we now know the men of substanceof knowledge in businessof prudence to confine their views within moderate boundsand let me add of honesty A few such men we have and let us esteem them accordingly  On the other hand what shall be said of those who have held themselves forth to the world as possessed of good stocks while at the same time they were conscious that they were worse than nothing who in order to carry on the cheat and at the same time gratify the wretched vanity of figuring for a while in borrowed feathers have lived with a degree of elegance becoming in people of the first rank but ridiculous and offensive in men of low extraction Such unprincipled  men having been entrusted with the money of numbers and with the  all  of some have villanously consumed it and involved their creditors in the same ruin though not in the same guilt with themselves On such men let the consequences of their dishonesty fall heavy for me How inconsistent is it that in a country where we hang a man who steals or robs to the extent of a trifle we should be so tender to  fraudulent bankrupts  though they have actually deprived their neighbours of sums enormous and occasioned universal and deep distress I will however do what is in my power to show that I can distinguish between good and evil I am not to be soothed by the whining of their artful emissaries to accept of a paultry composition and suffer  them  to live at large nay better than I can afford to do Nofor the sake of justice for the sake of deterring them and such corrupt hardhearted impostors from again making a prey of their neighbours my voice is  Spare not  If they will strut let it be in prison if they will be merry let it be within those walls where culprits dwell as wellborn as remorseless and as jovial as they  Yet let us not forget that there are a few unfortunate a few whose ruin has been occasioned through their connections with the unworthy For these I can make all the  allowance that the tenderest humanity would wish But let us be sure that the excuse is true before we dispense with the punishment The compassionate remedy of a  Cessiobonorum  is not granted but to such debtors as have  proved that their failure has been occasioned through misfortune  We must have some evidence in favour of all our bankrupts or insolvent debtors or by whatever other name they chuse to pass before they have our indulgence What that evidence should be I do not pretend to define I leave it to the conscience of every enquirer I myself am agreeably satisfied with the innocence of some Woe be to those villains who have thrown a cloud of suspicion over all and made it so hard for the truly honest to get themselves distinguished  Although men in trade have been the prominent and firstdiscovered victims in the late broad and sudden crush we have already seen several men of other professions and some too of the lowest throwing their shattered personal estates into the Court of Session which by the new bankruptact is become the perpetual lighthouse for tempestuous fortunes and universal guardian of shipwrecked goods Were none but traders swallowed up in this gulf of bankruptcy less would be my regret but it is a melancholy truth that almost all will be sufferers in a greater or lesser degrace for I  am sorry to say it that almost all are adventurers in the article of money and credit owing either to extravagance negligence or the desire of being precipitantly rich  Of the extravagance of certain men I have already spoken with a due severity but I am coming round and shall have a word with most of my neighbours The mischief is that for some years past there has been in Scotland an abominable spirit of levelling all those distinctions which ages of civilized society have through all the gradations of politeness introduced amongst mankind  Ill fares the land to hast'ning ills a prey  Where wealth accumulates and men decay  says Dr  Goldsmith  and I apply his elegant lines to the decay of gentlemen Ever since the seat of government has been removed from among us we have been encreasing in riches and barbarity as a body in proportion as it grows fat becomes coarse Interest or amusement draw the greatest number of our people of fashion up to London and those who remain are hardly to be perceived as most of them suffer themselves to mingle undistinguished with the general mass Upstarts who have picked up fortunes abroad they best know how and puppies at home who have obtained possession of wealth by various means have flashed among  us with all the splendor of prodigality lavishing away perhaps in one week as much as supported their father's family and might still support a family of their nearest relations for a whole year Our real gentry who have had every mechanical business nay in some instances every servile office performed to them by the fathers of these men have been mean enough to associate with them as equals and foolish enough to vie with them in expence till drowned in debt their lands have fallen to the lot of these very people And hence it has happened that there is no distinction of tables as there is no distinction of ranks all must have an equal number of dishes all must have wines equally costly as all think themselves equally  gentlemen  as the word is now used so that it may be justly said Our feasts are noble and our manners plebeian This though an iron age with a vengeance in the true sense of the expression is in one respect a golden age for gold is the object on which all inclinations are fixed and which procures all those advantages which in times of higher spirit and nobler sentiments no riches could obtain I have said that gold procures such advantagesI would alter the phrase a little for from the very nature of things the genuine distinction which good birth commands cannot be the subject of commerce therefore the lowborn enjoy it not as it  can never be acquired but like the compliant drunken companion who said to his friend who had fallen upon the ground 'I cannot help you up but I'll lie down beside you' our people of birth bring themselves to a level with the mean so that when the genuine honours due to birth are destroyed gold may then purchase every thing that remains  In  England  there is a court in  Ireland  the representation of a court which nearly answers the same purpose and in both these countries a distinction of ranks is preserved whereas in  Edinburgh  except at a dancingmaster's ball the weekly assembly for dancing or the annual levee of his Majesty's commissioner to the general assembly of the kirk and sometimes a funeral there is not the least room for precedency I do not desire to have a lordlieutenant but I could wish that we had some deputy at the palace of Holyroodhouse to keep us a little in mind of the distinction of ranks However some factious spirits may attempt to destroy it our government limited as it is is certainly a monarchical government and until it is solemnly changed to another we ought to keep alive the true spirit of it which cannot be done without observing the distinction of ranks "In a monarchical state says an ingenious French writer are two orders essentially separate and distinct the nobles  and the plebeians the functions of the former are to defend it those of the latter to feed and to enrich it without ever aspiring to useless honours which are not made for them"  Nor should those of the inferior ranks of life think themselves disparaged or treated with tyrannical contempt when they are kept apart from those whom they ought habitually to reverence They may be esteemed as reputable men in their station while they remain in their own places with contentment and quietness and do not fret their minds by a vain and restless contention for equality They may lead perhaps as comfortable lives as those above them and if ambition stirs within them they may feed it with some probability while they please themselves with the idea that the wealth acquired by their industry may lay the foundation of a family which in a long course of time may be as respectable and noble as any  Let me not be branded as a niggard or an unsocial fellow for what I am now going to say Take it as you please I am persuaded that there is truth and justice in the remark that one great source of extravagance at present is the practice of extensive and indiscriminate entertaining which prevails amongst us I remember the time when no body dined or supped at our  houses but relations or particular friends and connections except at the houses of men of high rank or in public offices who were therefore obliged in point of decorum and for the purposes of good policy to give entertainments to large and general companies Indifferent people paid us a morning visit or drank a dish of tea at our houses in the afternoon Whereas now what a wide circle of dining and supping acquaintance has every one of usA man resolves on having a dinner or a supper He sends about cards and he is never at rest till he has secured as many as will fill his table The slightest acquaintance suffices for giving and receiving such invitations and from their being so promiscuous and such a continual round of them true hospitality no longer exists We ask chiefly those who will ask us again and we ask so many that with one half of them we have no connection and no such reciprocation of regard as should be found between the master of a house and his guests On the contrary it is very common to find them attack each other behind their backs if not with rancorous abuse at least with bitter sarcasm or debasing buffoonery  Non hospes ab hospite tutus  Such indiscriminate entertaining is the worse that not only do we think ourselves obliged to have our tables more plentifully  covered than in most houses in London but we must drink hard upon almost every occasion I will venture to say that there is at this time more harddrinking in  Scotland  than in any other country in Europe  Ireland  not excepted The regular artillery of the glasses the bumpers the varieties of toasting in short all the  Pride pomp and circumstance of glorious drinking  are still in full observance amongst us It may seem extraordinary that this fashion should have increased in  Scotland  when it is wearing out both in  England  and  Ireland  but so is most certainly the fact account for it who will  There can be no doubt that the fashion of hard drinking at every table has contributed much to roughen our manners Our gentlemen of the last age were much more polite than those of the present they had their jovial clubs of an evening but they rose from dinner time enough to pay their compliments to the ladies in the drawingroom The Edinburgh Miscellany Allan Ramsay's Teatable Miscellany and even Mr Hamilton of Bangour's Poems which are of a much later date shew us that there was in Scotland a genteel mode of society which seems now to be quite given up Our ladies and gentlemen assembled at tea in the afternoons where they had the most agreeable opportunities of improving themselves  in a genteel address and gay conversation Colonel  Forrester  who wrote  The Polite Philosopher  was formed in such society  Whereas now every drawingroom is like a nunnery and the ladies hardly see the gentlemen but at some public place where they often appear when much intoxicated a monstrous degree of indecency peculiar to Scotland Surely being accustomed to see men drunk a situation into which the Athenians forced their slaves that their youth might by beholding its ugly effects have an abhorrence at the vice must not a little hurt the delicacy of our ladies Although the gentlemen should not be what is called  mortal  their being inflamed with liquor must make their conversation and behaviour such as ought to shock our ladies and if they are much accustomed to it sure I am the enamel is off their minds and blunted are those finer feelings of which an elegant woman ought to be possessed  As another proof of our present coarseness I cannot but observe that amidst all our extravagance we are shamefully deficient in dress which is the least hurtful mode of expence as it can do no harm either to body or mind while it encourages the labours of the industrious and affords a pretty exercise for taste and fancy  Negligence or want of attention to oeconomy is the second general cause of bankruptcy  Sir  Francis Osborne  who wrote a great many years ago in  England  has a passage in his advice to his son which with a few variations might be addressed at this day to numbers in  Scotland  The substance of it will apply so I shall give it in his own words  I find the  oeconomicks  though most useful to being the least esteemed with our  gallants  looked upon by some as trivial by others as dishonourable and unbecoming a masculine employment yet a total neglect of them may be found in experience the ruin of the greatest families in  England  as their more exact prosecution keeps up men's estates in  Italy  where the inhabitants are celebrated as most generally wise and therefore not unfitly proposed in this for an universal pattern but where they border too near the confines of penury and baseness most unbecoming the custom and plenty of  England  and where in this particular till the sword received a commission from GOD to devour all things good and honourable in the land our noblemen equalled the princes and our king exceeded in hospitality all the monarchs in the known world and might yet have done more had the true elements of thrift been maintained in equal proportion by providing all things at the best hand and making use of times and seasons in which I confess so much as purely  belongs to housewifery ought if not in discretion yet in reverence to custom to be left to women provided they own abilities competent for the employment which is yet sometimes so far contradicted by experience as the first leak of a husband's fortune is found to rise in the kitchen and such rooms as a man of quality cannot decently visit Nor is there a better way patent to obviate this falling into a hectic through a dysentery than by an equal balancing all weekly accounts never noted by wisdom any more blemish to honour than to know how many horses he keeps in the stable a place that cannot be denied to be made by use rather than reason more becoming his presence than the pastry or larder nor is the keeping of a regulated expence magnified rather than decried in the highest courts of wisdom neglected so much out of scorn as defect fathers especially rich ones being so far to learn themselves what is most fit their children should be taught as they keep them so long in their Latin school till the time is lapsed most proper for reading and to make a perfect accountant the most necessary part of the mathematics and so much as cannot be in any commerce spared it remaining indubitable that none so industrious as to call himself to a weekly or at least an annual reckoning did ever through his own default spend an estate whereas the  want of this first rudiment of thrift hath within the compass of my experience brought divers to a bit of bread and demolished the houses of the most ancient gentry in  England  Now if any desire to understand how our more illiterate fathers came to escape this curse an answer lies ready That the greatest part of their revenues did consist in provisions of all sorts paid punctually at a day and so easily accounted for and remembered And this abundance they enjoyed kept them pleased and in friendship with their estates wanting neither company nor respect through which they became less liquorish after the glory and small delights of  London  and the court towards which they did seldom look but upon constraint having never tasted them in youth as now they do the only time to contract an affection to any place or thing So as that we call  the breeding of our gentry  is the main reason of their undoing the glorious aspects the city affords rendering the more solid pleasures of the country contemptible and distasteful And thus infatuated from the hope of a redemption by an  office  or  wife  they drop into an ocean of debts between the  Scylla  and  Charybdis  of a  London  and country house which for want of moderating their expence a thing arithmetic is the readiest if not the only means to reform it becomes no less terrible to look upon in relation to  solitude  and  dilapidations  than unsafe to abide in for fear of the  Sheriff  So far  Sir Francis Osborne  And indeed every man of observation and reflection must subscribe to the truth of what he has said As judicious divines have remarked that none who are constant in the duty of prayer by which their lives are daily reviewed by them with at least some degree of awe will be very wicked so none who are regular in keeping accounts will be very extravagant But negligence is often produced by extravagance People perceive their expence to be so great that they are afraid to examine into the state of their affairs which they know are in a ruinous condition but they have not courage to retrieve them and abandon themselves to despair Such is the situation of some but the greatest number of those whom I have in my view have not even an apprehension or suspicion of their danger they repose in ignorant negligence while debt like corroding rust is silently and surely devouring their substance While thus deluded with easy dreams they are unsolicitous with regard to their own expence and thoughtlessly become bound as security for others another unhappy circumstance which is now so common that to refuse it will irritate and you have no thanks for granting it And here again  Sir Francis Osborne  comes in who cautions his  son in a strong and lively manner "Such as are betrayed by their easy nature to be ordinary security for their friends leave so little to themselves as their liberty remains ever after arbitrary at the will of others Experience having recorded many whom their fathers had left elbowroom enough that by suretyship have expired in a dungeon But if you cannot avoid this labyrinth enter no further than the thread of your own stock will reach the observation of which will at worst enable you to bail yourself"  The desire of being precipitantly rich is the third general cause of bankruptcy The old prudent maxims of frugality by which our fathers acquired wealth and kept it or by which they at least left their fortunes in no worse situation than they found them are exploded and we must all attain to riches by means of project and adventure A few men of enterprize may be of use in a country but what must become of that country where all are men of enterprize The consequence must be that labourers mechanicks traders and farmers by all struggling to get into a situation higher than that to which they have any probable means of attaining must like the frog in the fable burst in the attempt Our landed gentlemen again observing the artificial and temporary rise in the price of all provisions demand exorbitant  rents which distracted men in some cases agree to pay and in other cases the gentlemen think themselves sure of getting after keeping their grounds for sometime in their own possession and laying out large sums of money upon their improvement not considering that in a few years their tenants break and that the calculations of profits which they have framed upon their improvements turn out to be fallacious They are offended if you would hint such things to them while they are living up to the full extent of their imaginary rents Let us see the result of all this Our newspapers are filled with sales of lands and the rolls of the court of session crouded with adjudications and  Cessio Bonorums  in the course of which it has come out that footmen common soldiers and in short the lowest of mankind have obtained credit for hundreds nay thousands of pounds  This unhappy subject of credit brings before us those numerous banks and banking companies that most astonishing circulation of paper currency and that amazing multitude of cash accounts which are at this time in  Scotland  and to which many of the bankruptcies must be imputed Such has been the rage of making profits by banking and such the flattering expectations that if any failures did happen those who issued notes would either be so fortunate as not to be the  sufferers or would be indemnified by the interest drawn for their mere paper that they have given cashaccounts to many people who they could not but be sensible had neither money nor effects equal to the extent of the sum and such men becoming mutual security for each other could not mend the matter but only serve to encourage the delusion by having the appearance of some strength without any reality  In the view of what I have already supposed that at the ensuing terms payments must and will be demanded all over  Scotland  with a degree of rigour which we have never before experienced I would say a few words to three different classes of readers those who can immediately pay those who if let alone for a time may be able to pay and those who must be conscious that they neither can at present nor have a probability of ever being able to pay  As to those who are able to pay let them consider that they are called upon not only by justice but by every motive of humanity not to plead any affected excuse or avail themselves of any evasive delays but on the contrary to exert themselves with the utmost diligence and anxiety to make punctual payment because their failing so to do may be the occasion of breaking the credit of many who if they could get exact payment of what is due to them might still be able to support themselves with decency and be  useful members of society They ought to consider that delaying on this critical and distressing occasion to pay back the money which they have borrowed till their creditors have suffered is like delaying in the time of a famine to pay back bread which they have borrowed till their neighbours are dead nor is it enough that the law is open to all for we well know that notwithstanding the present dispatch in the court of session the forms which justice has devised to prevent crude decisions being passed and hasty advantages being taken afford an opportunity for chicane to contrive that we shall feel what  Shakespeare  justly enumerates as one of the most galling evils "the law's delay" and a good deal more is expended on every lawsuit than what is repaid when costs are allowed Besides they ought to recollect that there is no proportion between the injury done to  them  by a lawsuit and that which is done by it to men of less confirmed credit than theirs The blasts that hardly shake the deeprooted tree will tear up one that is not so advantageously situated  As for those who cannot pay immediately but if let alone for a time may be able to pay of which I do believe there will be found a considerable number I would advise them when pushed by any of their creditors candidly and fairly to explain their situation and their prospects If they are gentlemen of estates who have laid out money  judiciously let them shew that in a few years they will be able to discharge what they owe and be richer than at present Gentlemen who have estates are however the least to be pitied for if their improvements be solid they may always command credit but those who have laid out their borrowed money in farming or in trade in the expectation of considerable profits and of being allowed to pay off their debt gradually as their profits come in must be in a very unhappy situation if a sudden demand is made upon them Let them then be in condition to lay their circumstances before their creditors both with accuracy and openness so as to obtain their confidence and sympathy while they may at the same time demonstrate to them that it will be their own interest to have patience as harsh measures would have the effect to forfeit those leases and frustrate those advantageous schemes which would in time afford a fund for full payment instead of the small share which would now be drawn I would hope that following the rules which have been now pointed out may be attended with very beneficial consequences  As for those who must be conscious that they neither can at present nor have a probability of ever being able to pay I would earnestly exhort them to brave it out no longerno longer to go on accumulating  distress on  hers and guilt on themselves they can never have a better opportunity for stopping than the present time when they have so many neighbours to keep them in countenance I would advise them too to seize the opportunity for another reason which may strike a knell to some of their hearts for next session of parliament an act may be passed against fraudulent and even prodigal bankrupts fraught with such severity as I wish from my soul had been passed several years ago All of them will yet meet with the greater indulgence the sooner they discover themselves and I promise them they will find much more ease in their own minds than in their present state when they are miserably assuming a false appearance and hourly in terror of detection while every man whom they do not know they suspect to be a messenger and every packet that is delivered to them they dread contains a charge of horning  I cannot conclude without expressing my hopes that the late bankruptcies however distressing to individuals deserving and undeserving may be of general utility if they have the effect which we may suppose they will have on every rational and welldisposed person by restoring just notions of subordination frugality and every other principle by which the good order of society is maintained  The END
