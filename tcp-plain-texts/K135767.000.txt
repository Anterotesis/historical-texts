 AN ESSAY ON SLAVERY Proving from SCRIPTURE its Inconsistency with HUMANITY and RELIGION In Answer to a late Publication entitled  The AFRICAN TRADE for Negro Slaves shewn to be consistent with Principles of HUMANITY and with the LAWS of REVEALED RELIGION  BY GRANVILLE SHARP ESQ  With an introductory PREFACE containing the Senti∣ments of the Monthly Reviewers on that Publication and the Opinion of several eminent Writers on the Subject  TO WHICH IS ADDED An ELEGY on the miserable State of an African Slave by the celebrated and inge∣nious WILLIAM SHENSTONE Esq  The Lord also will be a Refuge for the Oppresseda Refuge in Time of Trouble  Psal ix  BURLINGTON  Printed and Sold by ISAAC COLLINS MDCCLXXIII  PREFACE  THE following Essay though wrote as the Author signifies in haste is thought to have such merit as to de∣serve a publicationThe copy was sent to one of the Writer's particular friends whe∣ther for his own peculiar satisfaction or the press is uncertain but as the subject is  Liber∣ty  so it is expected the  Freedom  which is here taken cannot justly give him offence or be unacceptable to the publick  IT was designed to confute a piece wrote by Thomas Thompson M A some time fellow of C C C entitled  The African trade for Negro Slaves shewn to be consistent with principles of humanity and with the laws of revealed religion  Printed at Can∣terbury  IN order to shew that the Essay Writer has not misrepresented the text nor is single in his observations upon it the sentiments of the Monthly Reviewers on that pamphlet in May are here inserted  "We must acknowledge" say they  that the branch of trade here under consi∣deration is a species of traffick which we  have never been able to reconcile with the dictates of humanity and much less with those of religion The principal ar∣gument in its behalf seems to be the  ne∣cessity  of such a resource in order to carry on the works in our plantations which we are told it is otherwise impossible to perform But this though the urgency of the case may be very great is not by any means sufficient to justify the practice There is a farther consideration which has a plausible appearance and may be thought to carry some weight it is that the mer∣chant only purchases those who were slaves before and possibly may rather than otherwise render their situation more tole∣rable But it is well known that the lot of our Slaves when most favourably consi∣dered is very hard and miserable be∣sides which such a trade is taking the advantage of the ignorance and bruta∣lity of unenlightened nations who are encouraged to war with each other for this very purpose and it is to be feared are sometimes tempted to seize those of their own tribes or families that they may ob∣tain the hoped for advantage and it is owned with regard to our merchants that upon occasion they observe the like practices which are thought to be allow∣able because they are done by way of reprisal for theft or damage committed by the natives We were pleased however  to meet with a pamphlet on the other side of the question and we entered upon its perusal with the hopes of finding some∣what advanced which might afford us satis∣faction on this difficult point The writer appears to be a sensible man and capa∣ble of discussing the argument but the limits to which he is confined render his performance rather superficial The plea he produces from the Jewish law is not in our view of the matter at all conclusive The people of Israel were under a  theo∣cracy  in which the Supreme Being was in a peculiar sense their King and might therefore issue forth some orders for them which it would not be warrantable for ano∣ther people who were in different circum∣stances to observe Such for instance was the command given concerning the extirpation of the Canaanites whom the sovereign Arbiter of life and death might if he had pleased have destroyed by plague or famine or other of those means which we term natural causes and by which a wise Providence fulfils its own purposes But it would be unreasonable to infer from the manner in which the Israelites dealt with the people of Canaan that any other nations have a right to pur∣sue the same method Neither can we imagine that St Paul's exhortation to ser∣vants or slaves upon their conversion to continue in the state in which christianity  found them affords any argument favour∣able to the practice here pleaded for It is no more than saying that Christianity did not particularly enter into the regula∣tions of civil society at that time that it taught persons to be contented and diligent in their stations but certainly it did not forbid them in a proper and lawful way if it was in their power to render their circumstances more comfortable Upon the whole we must own that this little treatise is not convincing to us though as different persons are differently affected by the same considerations it may prove more satisfactory to others  IN another place they observe  since we are  all brethren  and God has given to  all  men a natural right to  Liberty  we allow of no  Slavery  among us unless a person for∣feits his freedom by his crimes  THAT Slavery is not consistent with the English constitution nor admissable in GreatBritain appears evidently by the late solemn determination in the court of King's Bench at Westminster in the case of So∣merset the Negroand why it should be revived and continued in the colonies peo∣pled by the descendents of Britain and bles∣sed with sentiments as truly noble and free as any of their fellow subjects in the mother country is not easily conceived nor can the distinction be well founded  IF  natural rights such as  life  and  Liberty  receive no additional strength from muni∣cipal laws nor any  human legislature  has  power  to abridge or  destroy them  unless the owner commits some act that amounts to a forfeiture  Blackstone's Commentaries  If  the natural  Li∣berty of mankind  consists properly in a power of acting as one thinks fit without any restraint or controul unless by the  law of nature  being a  right inherent in us by birth  and one of the  Gifts of God to man  at his creation when he endued him with the faculty of  free will  do  If an  act of Parliament  is  controulable by the laws of God and nature  Bacon's Abridg  and  in its consequences  may be  rendered void for  absurdity or a  manifest contradiction to common reason  Black Com  If  Chri∣stianity is a part of the law of Eng∣land  Stra Reports  and Christ expressly com∣mands  Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you do ye even so to them  at the same time declaring  for this is the law and the prophets  Matt vii  And if our forefathers who emigrated from Eng∣land hither brought with them all the rights liberties and privileges of the Bri∣tish constitutionwhich hath of late years been often asserted and repeatedly contended for by Americans why is it that the poor sooty African meets with so different a mea∣sure  of justice in England and America as to be  adjudged free  in the one and in the other held in the most  abject Slavery  WE are expressly restrained from making laws "repugnant to" and directed to fa∣shion them  as nearly as may be agreeable to the laws of England  Hence and be∣cause of its total inconsistency with the prin∣ciples of the constitution neither in Eng∣land or any of the Colonies is there one law directly in favour of or enacting  Slavery  but by a kind of sidewind admitting its existence though only founded on a barbarous cus∣tom originated by foreigners attempt its regulation How far the point litigated in Somerset's case would bear a fober candid discussion before an impartial judica∣ture in the colonies I cannot determine but for the credit of my country should hope it would meet with a like decision that it might appear and be known that  Liberty  in America is not a partial privilege but extends to every individual in it  I MIGHT here in the language of the famous JAMES OTIS Esq ask  Is it pos∣sible for a man to have a natural right to make a Slave of himself or of his posteri∣ty What man is or ever was born free if every man is not Can a father supersede the laws of nature Is not every man born as free by nature as his father  American Tracts by Otis  There can be no prescription old enough  to supersede the law of nature and the grant of God Almighty who has given to every man a natural right to be free  American Tracts by Otis  The Colonists are by the law of nature free born as indeed all men are white or black No better reason can be given for the enslaving those of any colour than such as Baron Montesquieu has humourously assigned as the founda∣tion of that cruel Slavery exercised over the poor Ethiopeans which threatens one day to reduce both Europe and Ame∣rica to the ignorance and barbarity of the darkest ages Does it follow that it is right to enslave a man because he is black Will short curled hair like wool instead of christians hair as it is called by those whose hearts are as hard as the nether millstone help the argument Can any logical inference in favour of Slavery be drawn from a flat nose a long or a short face Nothing better can be said in favour of  a trade  that is the most shocking violation of the laws of nature has a di∣rect tendency to diminish every idea of the inestimable value of Liberty and makes every dealer in it a tyrant from the director of an African company to the petty chap∣man in needles and pins on the unhap∣py coast  d    To those who think Slavery founded in Scripture a careful and attentive perusal of the Sacred Writings would contribute more than any thing to eradicate the error they will not find even the name  Slave  once mention∣ed therein and applied to a servitude to be continued from parent to child in perpetuity with approbationThe term used on the oc∣casion in the sacred text is  Servant  and upon a fair construction of those writings there is no necessity nor can the service consistent with the whole tenor of the Scripture be extended further than the generation spoken of it was never intended to include the posterity  THE mistaken proverb which prevailed in that early age that  The fathers had eaten four grapes and the childrens teeth were set on edge  was rectified by the pro∣phets Jeremiah and Ezekiel who declared to the people that  they should not have oc∣casion to use that proverb any more Behold all souls are mine as the soul of the father so the soul of the son the soul that sinneth it shall diethe son shall not bear the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the sonthe righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him  Jer xxxi Ezek xviii and  And the apostle Peter assures us after the ascen∣sion of our Saviour that  God is no re∣specter of persons but in every  nation  he  that feareth him is accepted of him  Acts x  It is also remarkable that at that time an  Ethiopean  "a man of great authority"  Acts viii  was admitted to the freedom of a Christian whatever we may think of the colour now as being unworthy of it  BUT admitting Slavery to be established by Scripture the command of the Sove∣reign Ruler of the universe whose eye takes in all things and who for good reasons beyond our comprehension might justly create a perpetual Slavery to effect his own purposes against the enemies of his chosen people in that day cannot be pleaded now against any people on earth it is not even pretended to in justification of Negro Sla∣very nor can the sons of Ethiopia with any degree of clearness be proved to have descended from any of those nations who so came under the Divine displeasure as to be brought into servitude if they are and those denunciations given in the Old Testament were perpetual and continue in force must we not look upon it meritorious to execute them fully upon all the offspring of that unhappy people upon whom they fell without giving quarter to any  MANY who admit the indefensibility of Slavery considering the subject rather too superficially declare it would be impolitick to emancipate those we are possessed of and say they generally behave ill when set at  liberty I believe very few of the advocates for freedom think that all ought to be manu∣mitted nay think it would be unjust to turn out those who have spent their prime of life and now require a support but many are in a fit capacity to do for themselves and the publick as to these let every master or mi∣stress do their duty and leave consequences to the Disposer of events who I believe will always bless our actions in proportion to the purity of their spring But many in∣stances might be given of Negroes and Mu∣lattoes once in Slavery who after they have obtained their liberty and sometimes even in a state of bondage have given strik∣ing proofs of their integrity ingenuity in∣dustry tenderness and nobility of mind of which if the limits of this little Piece per∣mitted I could mention many examples and why instances of this kind are not more fre∣quent we may very naturally impute to the smallness of the number tried with freedom and the servility and meanness of their education whilst in Slavery Let us never forget that an equal if not a greater proportion of our own colour behave worse with all the advantages of birth education and circumstances and we shall blush to oppose an equitable emancipa∣tion by this or the like arguments  LIBERTY the most manly and exalting of the gifts of Heaven consists in a free and generous exercise of all the human facul∣ties as far as they are compatible with the  good of society to which we belong and the most delicious part of the enjoyment of the inestimable blessing lies in a con∣sciousness that we are  free  This happy persuasion when it meets with a noble na∣ture raises the soul and rectifies the heart it gives dignity to the countenance and animates every word and gesture it elevates the mind above the little arts of deceit makes it benevolent open inge∣nuous and just and adds a new relish to every better sentiment of humanity  Blackwell's Court of Agustus  On the contrary  Man is bereaved of half his virtues that day when he is cast into bondage  Homer  THE end of the christian dispensation with which we are at present favoured ap∣pears in our Saviour's own words  The spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the  broken hearted  to preach deliverance to the captives and recovery of  sight to the blind  to set at  liberty them that are bruised  to preach the  acceptable year of the Lord  Luke iv  THE Editor is united in opinion with the author of the Essay that Slavery is contrary to the laws of reason and the principles of revealed religion and believes it alike ini∣mical and impolitick in every state and coun∣try for as  righteousness exalteth a nation  so sm is a reproach to any people  Prov xiv  Hence whatever violates the purity of equal justice and the harmony of true liberty in time debases the mind and ultimately draws down the displeasure of that Almighty Being who  is of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on iniquity  Habakkuk i  Yet he is far from censuring those who are not under the same convictions and hopes to be understood with charity and tenderness to all Every one does not see alike the same propositions who may be equally friends to truth as our education and opportunities of knowledge are various as our faces He will candidly confess to any one who shall kindly point it out any error which in this inquiry hath fell from his pen There can be but one beatific point of rectitude but many paths leading to it in which persons differing in modes and nonessentials may walk with freedom to their own opinions we may much more innocently be under a mis∣take than continue in it after a hint given which occasions our adverting thereto for it seems a duty to investigate the way of truth and justice with our utmost ability  A much more extensive and perfect view of the subject under consideration has of late prevailed than formerly and he believes nothing is wanting but an impartial dis∣interested attention to make still greater advances Thus by a gradual progression he hopes the name of  Slavery  will be eradicated  by the general voice of mankind in this land of  Liberty  THE mode of manumitting negroes in NewJersey is such as appears terrific and amounts almost to a prohibition because of its incum∣bering consequences which few prudent peo∣ple choose to leave their families liable to It is much easier in several other colonies In Pennsylvania a recognizance entered into in THIRTY POUNDS to indemnify the township is a complete discharge In Ma∣ryland where Negroes are so numerous I am informed the master or mistress may at pleasure give Liberty to their Slaves without the least obligation and be clear of any future burden Both these are exceptionable and may be improved Proper distinctions are necessary for as the freedom of all gra∣tis might be unjust not only to the publick but the Slave so any clog upon the owner who gives up his right at an age when he cannot have received much or any advantage from the labour of the individual would be unreasona∣ble The wisdom of a legislature earnestly dis∣posed to do good will I hope be directed to surmount every little difficulty in pointing out a scheme more equal and perfect by steering a middle course and proper care being kindly taken to assist and provide for the usefulness of those deserving objects of be∣nevolence the approbation of Divine Provi∣dence will I doubt not attend such laudable endeavours and crown them with success  That the legislative body of each province in America may give due attention to this im∣portant engaging subject and be blessed to frame and establish a plan worthy of the united jurisprudence wisdom and benevo∣lence of the  Guardians of Liberty  is the sincere wish of  THE EDITOR  AN ESSAY ON SLAVERY  c  AREVEREND author Mr Thomas Thompson M A has lately attempt∣ed to prove  that the African trade for Negro Slaves is consistent with the prin∣ciples of  humanity  and  revealed religion  FROM Leviticus xxv to he draws his principal conclusion viz  that the buy∣ing and selling of Slaves  is not contrary to the law of nature  for says he the  Jewish constitutions  were strictly therewith consist∣ent  in all points  and these are in certain cases the rule by which is determined by  learned lawyers  and casuists what is or is not  contrary to nature  I have not leisure to follow this author methodically but will nevertheless examine his ground  in a general way  in order to prevent any ill use that may  be made of it against the important question now depending before the judges  Meaning I suppose the case of Somerset which then depended  THE reverend Mr Thompson'  s premises are not true  for the Jewish constitutions  were not "strictly consistent"  with the  law of na∣ture  in all points as he supposes and conse∣quently his principal  conclusion  thereupon is erroneous Many things were formerly tole∣rated among the Israelites merely through the mercy and forbearance of God in consi∣deration of their extreme frailty and inabili∣ty at that time to bear a more perfect system of law Other laws there are in the five books besides the ceremonial laws now abro∣gated which are merely  municipal  being a∣dapted to the peculiar polity of the Israelitish commonwealth on account of its situation in the midst of the most barbarous nations whom the Hebrews were at all times but too much inclined to imitate  THE universal  moral laws  and those of  na∣tural equity  are indeed every where plenti∣fully interspersed among the  peculiar laws  abovementioned but they may very easily be distinguished by every sincere christian who examines them with  a liberal mind  because the  benevolent purpose  of the Divine Author is  always apparent  in those laws which are to be  eternally binding  for  it is  the reason  of the law which constitutes the  life of the law  according to an allowed maxim of our own  country "Ratio Legis est anima Legis" Jenk Cent And with respect to these  moral  and  equitable  laws I will readily agree with the reverend Mr Thompson that they are the best rule by which  learned judges and casuists can determine what is or is not  contrary to nature  BUT I will now give a few examples of laws which are in  themselves contrary to na∣ture or natural equity  in order to shew that Mr Thompson'  s premises  are totally false  THE Israelites were expressly  permitted by the law of Moses  to give a bill of divorce to their wives whenever they pleased and to marry  other women  and the women who were put away were also expressly permitted by the Mosaic Law  to marry again  during the lives of their former husbands  ALL which practices were manifestly con∣trary to  the law of nature  in its purity though not perhaps to  the nature of our corrupt affec∣tions and desires  for Christ himself declared that  "from the beginning it was not so"  Matt xix and at the same time our Lord informed the Jews that  Moses because of  the hardness of their hearts  suffered them to put away their wives  NEITHER was it  according to the law of na∣ture  that the Jews were  permitted  in their be∣haviour and dealings to make a partial dis∣tinction between their  brethren  of the house of Israel and strangers This national partiality was not indeed either commanded or re∣commended  in their lawbut it was clearly  permitted  or  tolerated  and probably for the same reason as the last mentioned instance  thou  shalt not lend  upon usury to  thy bro∣ther  c  unto  a stranger  thou mayst  lend upon usury  c Deut xxiii Again  of  a foreigner  thou  mayst exact  that is whatsoever  has been lent  as appears by the preceding verses but that which is "thine  with thy brother  thine hand shall release" Deut xv  Now all these laws were  contrary to the law of nature  or  "natural equity"  whatever Mr Thompson may think and were certainly annulled or rather  superseded  as it were by the more perfect doctrines of  universal benevolence  taught by Christ himself who  came not to destroy but to fulfil the law  IN the law of Moses we also read  Thou shalt not avenge or bear grudge against  the children of thy people but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself  Leviticus xix  THE Jews accordingly thought themselves sufficiently justified if they confined this glo∣rious perfection of charity viz  the loving others as themselves  to the persons mentioned in the same verse viz  the children of their own people  for they had no idea that so much love could possibly be due to any other sort of  neighbours  or  brethren  But Christ taught them by the parable of  the good Sama∣ritan  that  all strangers whatever  even those  who are declared enemies as were the Sama∣ritans to the Jews are to be esteemed our  neighbours  or  brethren  whenever they stand in need of our charitable assistance  "THE Jewish institution" indeed as Mr Thompson remarks  permitted the use of  Bondservants  but did not permit the  bondage of brethren  STRANGERS ONLY could be  lawfully  retained as  Bondmen    of the heathen  or more agreeably to the Hebrew word  of the nations  that are round about you of  them  shall ye buy  Bond  men and  Bond  maids Moreo∣ver of the children of  strangers  that do so∣journ among you  of them shall ye buy  c "  They  shall be your  Bondmen forever  " Levit xxv to  THIS was the law I must acknowledge with respect to  a stranger  that was  purchased  but with respect to  a brother  or Hebrew of the seed of Abraham it was far otherwise as the same chapter testifies th verse for  If thy  brother  that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor and be  sold  unto thee thou  shalt not compel him to serve as a Bondservant  but as a hired servant and as a sojourner he shall be with thee and shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee and  then shall he depart from thee both he and his children with him  c This was the  utmost servitude  that a Hebrew could  lawfully  exact from any of his  brethren  of the house of Israel unless the servant en∣tered  voluntarily  into a perpetual servitude  and let me add that it is also the very  utmost servitude  that can  lawfully  be admitted  among christians  because we are bound as christians to esteem  every man our brother  and  our neighbour  which I have already prov∣ed so that this consequence which I have drawn is absolutely  unavoidable  The Jews indeed who do not yet acknowledge the commands of Christ may perhaps still think themselves  justified  by the law of Moses in making partial distinctions between  their bre∣thren  of Israel  and other men  but it would  be inexcusable  in christians to do so and therefore I conclude that we certainly have no right to exceed the  limits of servitude  which the Jews were bound to observe when∣ever their poor  brethren  were sold to them and I apprehend that we must not venture  even to go so far  because the laws of  bro∣therly love  are infinitely enlarged and ex∣tended by the gospel of peace which pro∣claims  "good will towards men"  without distinction and because we cannot be said to  "love our neighbours as ourselves"  or to  do to others as we would they should do unto us  whilst we retain them against their  will  in a despicable servitude as  Slaves  and  private property  or  mere chattels  THE glorious system of the gospel destroys all  narrow national partiality  and makes  us citizens of the world  by obliging us to profess  universal benevolence  but more especially are we bound as christians to commiserate and  assist to the utmost of our power all persons in  distress  or  captivity  whatever the  worshipful  committee of the company of merchants trading to Africa  may think of it or their advocate the reverend Mr Thompson  CHARITY indeed begins at home and we ought most certainly to give the prefer∣ence to our own countrymen whenever we can do so without injustice but we may "  not do evil that  good may come" though our statesmen and their political deceivers may think otherwise we must not for the sake of  OldEngland  and its  African Trade  or for the supposed advantage or imaginary necessities of our American colonies lay aside our  christian charity  which we owe to  all the rest of mankind  because  whenever we do so  we certainly deserve to be considered in no better light than as an overgrown  soci∣ety of robbers  a  mere banditti  who perhaps may  love one another  but at the same time are at enmity with  all the rest of the world  Is this  according to the law of nature  For shame Mr Thompson  I HAVE much more to communicate but no more time to writeif I had I could draw from the scriptures the most alarm∣ing examples of God's severe judgments up∣on the Jews for tyrannizing over  their bre∣thren  and  expressly  for exceeding the  li∣mits  of  servitude  just now mentioned I must find time however to adopt one observa∣tion  even from the reverend Mr Thompson p viz  This subject will grow more serious upon our hands when we consider the  buying and selling Negroes  not as a clandestine or piratical business but as an  open publick trade encouraged  and promoted by acts of parliament for so if being  contrary to religion it must be deemed a nati∣onal sin  and as such may have a conse∣quence that  would be always to be dreaded  May God give us grace to repent of this abo∣minable national oppression before it is too ate  If I have vindicated the law of Moses much easier can I vindicate the benevolent apostle Paul from Mr Thompson's insinua∣tions with respect to Slavery for he  did not  entreat  Philemon  to take back his servant One∣simus "in his former capacity" as Mr Thompson has asserted in order to render Bondage  consistent with the principles of revealed religion  but St Paul said  ex∣pressly  not now as a servant but above a servant  a  brother beloved  c So that Mr Thompson has notoriously wrested St Paul's words  IN the other texts where St Paul re∣commends submission to  Servants  for con∣sciencesake he at the same time enjoins the master to entertain such a measure of  brotherly love  towards his Servants as must be entirely subversive of the African trade and WestIndian Slavery And though St  Paul recommends christian patience under servitude yet at the same time he plainly insinuates that it is inconsistent with christi∣anity and the dignity of Christ's kingdom that a  christian brother  should be a  Slave  "Can'st thou be made free" says he to the christian servants  choose it rather  for he that is  called  of the Lord  being a servant  is the  Freeman  of the Lord and in like man∣ner he that is called  being free  is the  ser∣vant of Christ    Ye are bought with a price  BE NOT THEREFORE THE SER∣VANTS OF MEN  The apostle indeed had just before recommended to his disciples to  abide in the same calling  wherein they were called and  "being servants not to care for it"  That is not to grieve on account of  their temporal  state for he was unwilling to ad∣vance any doctrine that might seem to inter∣fere with the  temporal establishments  of govern∣ment and the supposed rights of men yet it plainly appears by the insinuations which immediately follow that he thought it dero∣gatory to the honour of christianity that men  who "are bought"  with the inestimable  price of Christ's blood  should be esteemed  servants  that is  the Slaves  and private pro∣perty of other men and had christianity been established by  temporal  authority in those countries where Paul preached as it is at present in these kingdoms we need not doubt but that he would have  urged  nay compelled the masters  as he did Philemon  by the most pressing arguments to treat their quondam Slaves  NOT NOW AS SERVANTS BUT ABOVE SERVANTS AS BRETHREN BELOVED  AN ELEGY On the miserable STATE of an AFRICAN SLAVE by the celebrated and ingenious WILLIAM SHENSTONE Esq  SEE the poor native quit the Lybian shores  Ah not in love's delightful fetters bound  No radiant smile his dying peace restores  Nor love nor fame nor friendship heals his wound  Let vacant bards display their boasted woes  Shall I the mockery of grief display  No let the muse his piercing pangs disclose  Who bleeds and weeps his sum of life away  On the wild beach in mournful guise he stood  Ere the shrill boatswain gave the hated sign  He dropt a tear unseen into the flood  He stole one secret moment to repine  Yet the muse listen'd to the plaints he made  Such moving plaints as nature could inspire  To me the muse his tender plea convey'd  But smooth'd and suited to the sounding lyre  "Why am I ravish'd from my native strand  What savage race protects this impious gain  Shall foreign plagues infest this teeming land  And more than seaborn monsters plough the main  Here the dire locusts horrid swarms prevail  Here the blue asps with livid poison swell  Here the dry dipsa wriths his sinuous mail  Can we not here secure from envy dwell  When the grim lion urg'd his cruel chace  When the stern panther sought his midnight prey  What fate reserv'd me for this  Spoke by a savage  christian race  O race more polish'd more severe than they  Ye prouling wolves pursue my latest cries  Thou hungry tyger leave thy reeking den  Ye sandy wastes in rapid eddies rise  O tear me from the whips and scorns of men  Yet in their face superior beauty glows  Are smiles the mien of rapine and of wrong  Yet from their lip the voice of mercy flows  And ev'n religion dwells upon their tongue  Of blissful haunts they tell and brighter climes  Where gentle minds convey'd by death repair  But stain'd with blood and crimson'd o'er with crimes  Say shall they merit what they paint so fair  No careless hopeless of those fertile plains  Rich by our toils and by our sorrows gay  They ply our labours and enhance our pains  And feign these distant regions to repay  For them our tusky elephant expires  For them we drain the mine's embowel'd gold  Where rove the brutal nations wild desires  Our limbs are purchas'd and our life is sold  Yet shores there are blest shores for us remain  And favour'd isles with golden fruitage crown'd  Where tufted flow'rets paint the verdant plain  Where ev'ry breeze shall med'cine ev'ry wound  There the stern tyrant that embitters life  Shall vainly suppliant spread his asking hand  There shall we view the billow's raging strife  Aid the kind breast and waft his boat to land"
