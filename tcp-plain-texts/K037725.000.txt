 HE'S MUCH TO BLAME A COMEDY IN FIVE ACTS  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRE ROYAL COVENT GARDEN  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW  MDCCXCVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE author of HE'S MUCH TO BLAME is in some small degree indebted to Le Complaisant a comedy attributed to Monsieur De Ferriol PontdeVeyle and to the tragedy of Clavigo by Goethe  PROLOGUE  PROLOGUES in these sagacious days must not  Repeat the story and betray the plot  For deep laid plots we sometimes have no doubt  'Tis pity you can't always find them out  The secret must be kept and not be told  In this at least we beat the bards of old  We can't endure our meaning you should guess  And here again we boast complete success  Cautious lest you the mystery should discover  We keep you in the darktill all is over  Since these important points we must not name  The title let's discuss He's much▪to blame  To blame Ay surely very much But who  The author Well that's nothing very new  And what does blame induce Why punishment  Rashly we sin and leisurely repent  Lured by that tempting bait a nine nights' bonus  These scribbling sinners multiply upon us  Then prologues write to whine cajole and tickle  Begging you'll burn the rod you've laid in pickle  Shielding himself by these and such like arts  He hopes to hurl with surer aim his darts  But strike and cry when we receive a blow  Is arrant cowardice I told him so  He's mad who would the field of battle tread  Unless he hoped to have a broken head  There's honor in such scarshe'll win and wear it▪  Then give him honor plenty Never spare it  But should it be your pleasure not to quarrel  He'll very kindly bear his load of laurel  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Lord Vibrate  Mr Quick  Sir George Versatile  Mr Lewis  Mr Delaval  Mr Pope  Dr Gosterman  Mr

family Where is Lady Jane  THOM  I thought that would be your question They are all in this house  DEL  Indeed  THOM  I knew when Lady Jane left Italy your stay there would be short  DEL  Ay ay The follies and frenzies of the madman are visible to all eyes except his own  THOM  I see you are dissatisfied  DEL  Tortured till my thoughts and temper are so changed that I am almost as odious to myself as the world is become hateful to me  THOM  I own you have some cause  DEL  Would  my  injuries were all But there are other and still deeper stabs It is not yet ten months since I returned from India my heart how light my eve how cheerful and my hand prompt at any commendable act I could then be moved to joy and sorrow and every sympathising passion Smiles and mock courtesy passed current on me the word of man and woman was taken on trust and I lived in the sunshine of an open unsuspecting soul But I am now otherwise taught I am changed My better part is brutalized and the wrongs that lie rankling here have stripped me of human affections and made me almost savage  THOM  What can be said Patience is the  DEL  Talk not of patience I must act I  may then perhaps enquire whether I have acted rightly But I must first see Lady Jane and Lord Vibrate  THOM  Shall I inform his lordship of your arrival  DEL  By no means Having injured he may wish not to see me and I would not afford him time to invent excuses and avoid giving me a hearing Though my wrongs must be endured they shall be told  THOM  I own they are great  DEL  Those that you know are heavy yet severe as the struggle would be 'tis possible they might be hushed to rest but there are others▪ which blood only can obliterate which can only sleep in death Such is the road I must travel Not long since nature was jocund the azure heavens were bright and pleasure was in every path but now darkness fathomless gulphs guilty terrors and all the dreadful phantoms of meditated desolation lie before me  Exeunt  ACT II  SCENE I  LORD VIBRATE  at a table with a quarto volume reading  LORD VIBRATE  THE ancient sceptics doubted of every thing affirmed nothing and kept the judgment always in suspense All things said they are equally indifferent uncertain and indeterminate The mind is never to assent to any thing that it may never be astonished or disturbed but enjoy  a perfect calm  Rises with important wisdom in his looks  Such were the maxims of Pyrrho and his disciples those renowned sages of antiquity Well And such too have been my maxims practically All my life have I been wavering uncertain and indeterminate A sagacious sceptic without knowing it and as it were by instinct It was but lately I discovered what a wise man I am And yet it seems to me as if I were scarcely half wise enough for I am told that I am to doubt of every thing which I find rather difficult For example that my wife Lady Vibrate is an extravagant rackety rantipole woman of fashion can I doubt that No That she squanders my money disturbs my peace and contradicts for contradiction's sake can I doubt that No Then have I not a daughter to marry a law suit to begin and a thousand perplexing affairs so that I do not know which way to turn Why all this appears true to me but the sceptics teach that appearances deceive and that nothing is certain I may be Lord Vibrate or I may be the Grand Turk These doctrines are prodigiously deep  Considers  But I must think of something else just now I have a thousand things to do and know as little where to begin as where they will end Ay All is uncertainty

trifles I must attend to this law business I wish I could determine What am I to do Thompson  THOM  In what my lord  LORD V  The affair of the ejectment If I once embroil myself in law there will be no end and if I do not the consequences are still worse  THOM  Then they are bad indeed my lord  LORD V  'Tis strange that I can come to no resolution on this subject  THOM  Aside  Nor on any other  LORD V  I must decide this very day or the time will be elapsed  THOM  A lawyer I should suppose my lord would give you the best advice  LORD V  How Are you mad Thompson A lawyer give good advice

No my lord  LORD V  I can get nothing done My whole life long I have been distracted with the multiplicity of my affairs  THOM  And so I am afraid my lord you always will be  LORD V  Why so sir  THOM

only person in the family who begin your miseries so soon in a morning  LORD V  The crosses and cares that prey upon me are enough to make any man on earth miserable  THOM  Pardon me my lord but if you would care less both yourself and your servants would sleep the more My lady cares for nothing and she can sleep when she is in bed and sing and dance and laugh at your lordship's cares and fears when she is up  LORD V  She will drive me mad  THOM  Going  Ah Here she is as it were for the purpose  LORD V  Tell Harry to admit the DoctorNo Not just yet Yes In five minutes I don't know when  Exit Thompson  SCENE VI  Enter  LADY VIBRATE  LADY V  Upon my honor my lord you are the most insupportable person imaginable You vociferate worse than the man who calls when my carriage stops the way Is

LORD V  You always give me such shocking heartachs of an evening  LADY V  Did not I send to you last night to request your lordship would not disturb me  LORD V  It has been your ladyship's amusement to disturb me all your life  LADY V  Your lordship knows I love amusement  LORD V  I have not slept a wink since  LADY V  You had slept quite enough before Pray how long are we to remain in this hotel Your lordship should remember it is degrading for a man of rank to doze away life in the stile of a colonel reduced to half pay  LORD V  Your ladyship should remember it is degrading for a woman of rank to riot away life and reduce her creditors to live without pay  LADY V  Pshaw That is the old story  LORD V  But it is a very true story It is a great misfortune that persons so opposite should pair  LADY V  A terrible one indeed I am all gaiety and good humour you are all turmoil and lamentation I sing laugh and welcome pleasure  wherever I find it you take your lantern to look for misery

cruelty to deny me a last interview till when I take my leave Only suffer me to remark that had you discovered in me any secret vice any defects dangerous to the happiness of the woman I adore you

Which way  LADY J  His character is too pliant If others are merry so is he if they are sad he is the same Their joys and sorrows play upon his countenance but though they may slightly graze they do not penetrate his heart Even while he relieves he scarcely feels them  LADY V  Pshaw He is a delightful man  LADY J  I grant he does his utmost But it is a folly to be the slave even of an endeavour to please  LADY V  Ha ha ha Upon my honor you are a whimsical young lady Afraid of marrying  a man because of his assiduous endeavours to please As if that were a husband's failing You can prefer no such accusation against Mr Delaval  LADY J  I own he is of a very different character Firm and inflexible he imagines he makes virtue his rule and reason his guide  LADY V  Firm indeed No no ferocious

has he not thought proper to let me know of his arrival  LADY V  No no The haughty gentleman has only thought proper to reproach Lord Vibrate for admitting the pretensions of Sir George He is too proud to endure a competitor  LADY J  Indeed Such pride is the very way to insure his competitor success Insulted my father  LADY V  I will leave you to judge how deeply when I tell you that

say If I pay this money for you I shall but encourage all around me to run in debt  THOM  It is a favour too great for me to hope  LORD V  You are a worthy man and a prison is a bad placeIyouPray what is your opinion Sir George Is it not dangerous for a man to have the character of being charitable  SIR G  No doubt my lord It is the very certain way for his house to be besieged by beggars  LORD V  The master who pays the debts of one domestic makes himself the debtor of all the rest  SIR G  He changes a set of servants into a set  of duns He first encourages them to be extravagant and then makes it incumbent upon himself to pay for their follies and vices He not only bribes them to be idle and insolent but to waste his property as well as their own  LORD V  It is as you say a very serious case II am sorry for your misfortune Mr Thompsonvery sorrybutreally  SIR G  Misfortune What misfortune  LORD V  He has foolishly been bound for his sister's husband and must go to prison for the debt  SIR G  To prison  LORD V  You have shewn me how dangerous it would be for me to interfere  SIR G  Very true very trueHe has lived with your lordship several years  LORD V  He has and I esteem him highly  SIR G  A worthy man whom it would be no disgrace to call your friend  LORD V  None Still however consequences must be weighed I must take time to consider 'Tis folly to act in a hurry  SIR G  Very truecautioncautionIs it a large sum  LORD V  No less than two hundred and forty pounds  SIR G  Caution is a very excellent thingTwo hundred and fortyA fine virtueTwoI would advise

a moment  LORD V  What can be done in this affair Mr Thompson  THOM  Nothing my lord I am resigned When I assisted my brother I did no more than my duty Those who lock me up in a prison may for aught I know do theirs yet though they are at liberty and I shall be confined I would neither change duties nor hearts with them  Going  SIR G  Harkye Harkye Mr Thompson Will you just desire this to be taken as it is directed  Aside to him  Don't say a word 'tis a draft on my banker Discharge your debt and be silentYou are very right my lord we cannot be too considerate lest by mistaken benevolence we should encourage vice  THOM  Sir George My lord  SIR G  Why now will you not oblige me Mr Thompson Pray let that be delivered as it is directed You surely will not deny me such a favorFor you know my lord if we give  THOM  Indeed I  SIR G  Will you begone Will you begone  Pushes him kindly off▪  If we give withoutwithout  LORD V  Poor fellow I suppose he is afraid of being taken  SIR G  Oh Is that itIf we give I say withtooPshaw I have lost the thread of my argument  LORD V  I must own this is a dubious case Perhaps I ought to pay the money  Calls  Mr ThompsonI don't think I ought to let him go to prison What shall I do Sir George  SIR G  Whatever your lordship thinks best  LORD V  But there is the difficultyMr Thompson He is gone How foolish this is now  As he is going off  Harry Run after Mr Thompson and call him back One would think a man going to prison would like me be wise enough to doubt and take time to consider of it  Exit  SCENE X  Enter  LADY VIBRATE  LADY V  I assure

so he told me with other particulars  DEL  Absurd Dr Gosterman has not seen me for several months  SIR G  He said sir you were a woman and  perhaps from that error I may have unconsciously provoked you to behaviour which would else have been rather strange Have I given you any other offence  DEL  Yes sir a mortal one  SIR G  Mortal  DEL  And mortal must be the atonement  SIR G  If so the sooner

anxious to see the two persons dearest  to his heart happy before he expired and the marriage was determined on the day fixed and the friends of the family invited The intended bridegroom appeared half frantic with his approaching bliss Now sir mark his proceeding In this short interval by sudden and unexpected deaths he becomes the heir to a title and large estate Well Does he not fly to the

to destroy  Comes forward  How dangerous are extremes Sometimes we doubt and indecision is our bane at others hurried away by the sudden impulse of passion our course is marked with misery One man is too compliant another too intractable Yet happiness is the aim of all Since then all are so liable to be misled let gentle forbearance indulgent thoughts and a mild forgiving spirit be ever held as

Recollecting  Something about the anxious months he spent  Pompously  His garret traversing his brain intent  On this and that and t'other action plot  Wit humour passion and the lord knows what  And
