 THE VALIDITY OF THE RENUNCIATIONS OF Former Powers Enquired into AND THE Present Renunciation OF THE Duke of  ANJOU  Impartially Considered WITH A PREFACE relating to the Guarantee for the Protestant Succession  LONDON  Printed and Sold by  J Marphew  near  StationersHall    THE PREFACE  AS the following Sheets are written to undeceive and quiet the Minds of the People of this Nation in the Case of the Renunciation mentioned in Her Majesties Speech to the Parliament so I could not let them come abroad into the World without taking some Notice of a Case which has happened since the finishing the other and which some People take hold off to the Disadvantage of the Government making Ʋse of it to encrease our unhappy Distractions in this Nation  It was observed by some that when the House of Commons made their late Address to Her Majesty no Mention was made therein of the Protestant Succession and the House of  Hannover  this the Party whose peculiar Zeal seems to have no other Way left to shew itself than in their continued repeating the Danger of the Protestant Succession took hold of as a mighty Advantage as if the House of  Hannover  the Succession  c  had been purposely affronted on that Occasion  But if they made some Noise on that Account the Alarm they pretend to is doubled Now  when on a Motion made in the House the th of  June  to Address Her Majesty for the making all the Confederates Guarantees of the Protestant Succession  it passed in the Negative    This fills our Zealous  Hannoverians as they would be thought to be  with Astonishment and with a feigned Sadness upon their Countenances they look at one another with Disorder and Amazement  The Gloss they put upon this is indeed very popular as if they did foresee the Pretender coming in at the Breach this has made and that because the House would not put Her Majesty upon the most Incongruous and Inconsistent Step in the World Needless to us and Irrational in itsself but pretended to be for the Propagation of the Interest of the Succession that therefore the House of Commons should be Enemies to the Protestant Interest and to the House of  Hannover    The House indeed have acted in this with their wonted Prudence and the Vote they have passed is certainly a much stronger Testimony of their firm Adherence to the  Hannover  Succescession than that Address could have been  viz  'That they have an entire Confidence in Her Majesty and cannot doubt but that she will take all needful Cautions for the Security of the Protestant Succession in the House of  Hannover  ' c  as may be seen in the Votes  June  the th  The Antient Lawmaker  Lycurgus  being asked why be made no Law against Paricide gave this wise Answer that he would not have such a Crime named among his Citizens nor would he suggest that any of his Citizens were capable of so much Degeneracy of Nature as to be guilty of it and therefore he made no Punishment for it By this the wise Legislator put a greater Brand of Infamy upon the Crime than he could possibly have done by making the severeest Law against it imaginable  The like is the Conduct of the House of Commons who having put this as a Matter they think lyes so near and is so much Her Majesties Concern as that it is impossible She should forget to secure it they have thereby more effectually obliged Her Majesty to take that Part upon Herself than they could have done by leading Her to the Ways and Means these People have prescribed them  The Expression they have now used to Her Majesty by their said Vote implies most strongly Two Things  That the Protestant Succession is a Thing of the highest Concern to the Nation so great that it would be undutiful and unnatural in them to suppose Her Majesty could so far neglect such an Essential and Fundamental Part of Her Peoples Safety as to Want that they should remind her of it and therefore they say  they cannot doubt it    That the entire Confidence the Commons place in Her Majesties Zeal for Her Peoples  Good is the greatest Obligation that a faithful People can put upon their Sovereign to do all that can possibly be done in the Thing itself and much stronger in all Respects than such an Address could have been  So that upon the whole it seems that the Settlement of the Protestant Succession is so far from having receiv'd any Shock by the Negative of the aforesaid Vote that in every Impartial Eye it must rather have Weight added to it and Her Majesty is farther loaded with Obligations to secure it if that be possible than She was before  THE VALIDITY OF THE RENUNCIATIONS OF Former Powers Enquired into AND THE Present Renunciation OF THE Duke of  ANJOU  Impartially Considered  IT has been the received Maxim of the Present Age that no Peace can be Safe or Honourable while any Part of the  Spanish  Monarchy remains in the Possession of the House of  Bourbon  The Votes and  Unanimous Addresses of both Houses of Parliament Here the frequent Declarations of our Allies Abroad and the Speeches of our Sovereign from the Throne together with infinite other Circumstances in Treaties in Conferences Missives Memorials  c  have both at Home and Abroad concurred to Print this Notion so indelibly in the Minds of the common People that it appears very difficult to remove their Thoughts or bring them to understand or conceive of any other Measures or the Reasons which may have been given or pretended for differing Measures But Time has taught us to see that neither the Opinion of Princes or Parliaments are so infallible as not to be Subject to the Mutations and Alterations which the Accidents of Government and the Revolutions of Nations bring upon them and that which may to Day be esteemed dangerous and impracticable to Morrow becomes not only safe but necessary so that it ceases to be an Argument against a Thing to say that such was the Opinion of such or such at such or such a Time for as Circumstances alter the Judgments of Men will and ought to be altered  This seems the Case in the Affair of Peace now on the Stage and which I am here to enquire into in the Examination whereof I shall with the utmost Impartiality search into the Thing itself its Nature and Circumstances  without taking any Advantages from the Measures now in Hand or the Quality of the Persons whose Sanction is added to give Authority to the Opinion It shall be of no Weight in this Case that Her Majesties Speech says so or so it shall not be brought as an Argument that the Government are satisfied with these Measures or that the Present Ministry have carried this Thing on upon such and such a Foundation the true Merits of this Cause shall according to the Title of this Tract be impartially considered and every Thing therein be weighed with the utmost Calmness and Coolness of Reasoning that nothing may Byass the Reader either for or against one Way or other but Matters of Fact placed in the clearest Light possible  The Terms of the Peace which is now to be made with  France  are at large set down in Her Majesties Speech the quoting them from thence serves not to give them any Sanction in the present Discourse more than the Certainty that those are the Real Terms now in Debate which Certainty has never till now been determined by any undisputed Authority  By these Terms it is allowed that contrary to all which has hitherto been Voted Declared or Concluded among us here the Kingdoms of Old  Spain  and the  Indies  are Given or Allotted to  Philip  of  Bourbon    Duke of  Anjou  now  Philip  V King of  Spain  which is the First and Main Point in Dispute  The Contradiction this Step taken now bears to the former Resolutions Declarations and Determinations of this Government and of the Confederates and how it is brought to be consistent with the Words Safe and Honourable so long and so often insisted on before depends upon the Novelty of the following Circumstances The King of  France  a Subtil and Politick Prince had boldly adventured to break off the Treaty at  Geertruydenbergh  although his Affairs were then in but a very low and threatning Posture he had found it more difficult to manage the Confederates at a Treaty than it had formerly been and the Councils of  France  began to apprehend Evil Consequences from the ensuing Campaign all they had for it was that their Troops in  Spain  were in a pretty good Condition and the Duke  de Vendosme  a Commander of Reputation having joined the  Spanish  Army with Brigades of  French  Infantry and about  French  Horse they had some Hopes of putting a Stop to the Troops of King  Charles  who after the Battle of of  Saragossa  had found the  Castilians  not so much in his Interest as he expected and began to be in Want of all Things having his Troops dispersed many Towns of Importance to keep Possession of and the  Rivers Passes and open Country possest by the  French  so that they began to think of drawing together in a Body and retreating towards the Frontiers of  Arragon  In  Flanders  and everywhere else the utmost the  French  could propose to do was to act upon the Defensive and if possible to keep the Confederates from besieging  Arras  or St  Omer    They succeeded however in these Things beyond Expectation the Campaign in  Flanders  ended with the single Loss of  Bouchain  and in  Spain  the Duke  de Vendosme  had the Satisfaction of Surrounding the  English  Troops in  Briheugha  beating Count  Staremberg  's Left Wing at  Villa Vicosa  and pushing the whole  German  Army back to  Catalonia  taking from them all the Castles and Passes they had seized besieging  Gironne  taking  Balaguer Cervera  and in brief pushing the  Germans  into the very City of  Barcelona  where the Duke threatened to Besiege them in the Spring Campaign  These Things buoyed up the King of  France  's Affairs to such a Height as made the War seem more fixed and Peace more remote than ever when on a sudden an Accident fell in which gave a new Turn to all the Affairs of  Europe  for Heaven who seemed before to have left the Cause to the Arm of Flesh and who suffered the several Nations to depend wholly  upon their Swords yet now all on a suddain took the Cause into his own Hand and taught both Sides that the Views they had either Way were not agreeable to him but that other Measures were to be taken to settle the Peace of  Europe  than those of War Conquest and Destruction of Mankind In Pursuance of these Measures Death was sent with his Black Express to Summon out of the World the several Persons whose being in the World prevented either Side from seeing their own Interest and from knowing wherein the Peace of  Europe  really consisted On the Confederate Side the Stroke began with the Emperor whose Death without Male Issue made Way on one Hand for the Advancement of King  Charles  to the  Imperial  Dignity but at the same Time gave new Prospects and new Schemes to the Politicks of  Europe  cooled several of the Powers and Princes of the Confederacy in their Pursuit of the War from the just Apprehension of lodging a dangerous Superiority of Power in the Hands of the House of  Austria  a Family who had been so justly dreaded by a great Part of the Christian World in the Fifteenth Century and whose Power as the  French  has done now had employed all the Powers and engag'd almost all the Princes of  Europe  in a long War for above Forty Years  At the same Time that this blow gave  France  some Hopes of new Measures and that a Peace might be made on a differing Poot than before Death falls furiously on the Royal Family of  France  takes away Three Dauphines the immediate Successors to the Crown and the Dauphiness Wife of the Duke of  Burgundy  and Daughter of the Duke of  Savoy  and all these within the Compass of One Year There now remained but One of the Children of the Family between the Crown of  France  and  Philip  King of  Spain  and this an Infant of about One Year and half old the Fortune of  France  weak like the State and not in the Judgment even of Physicians themselves likely to live long this Blow tho' it very sensibly affected the Old Monarch yet it immediately put him upon new Measures with the Confederates Two Schemes lay in his View One in Case the little Dauphine should die before the other could be brought to Perfection was the tendring the Crown and Monarchy of  Spain  to the Duke of  Savoy  which as it might be acceptable enough to some of the Confederates yet was much the Interest of  France  to manage it so as that the Duke should owe his Advancement to the Court of  France  and not to the Confederates by which Means if the Emperor and his Allies should oppose it as no doubt some of them would be perswaded he was sure on one Hand to bring  the Duke of  Savoy  off from the Confederacy and on the other Hand should be able to carry the War again into  Italy  and by attempting to put the Duke in Possession of  Spain  might keep such a Share in the Dominions and Commerce of  Spain  as should be for his Purpose The Second Scheme founded upon the Supposition of the Life of the little Dauphine for a while was to oblige King  Philip  of  Spain  to a formal Renunciation of his Claim to the Crown of  France  tho' the same should fall by the Death of the present Dauphine and that the Duke of  Berry  should be declared Dauphine in Case of the Death of the said present Dauphine and the Crown to descend to him and his Heirs  This Scheme had several Views but principally to obviate the great Objection which was made on all Occasions by the Confederates and which seem'd to be the Foundation of the War  viz  the Danger of uniting the Kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  in one and the same Person  It seems needless to repeat here the Difficulty  France  had found to bring the Confederates to enter upon any such a Thing as a Treaty After her rejecting the Preliminaries and breaking off the Subsequent Treaties at  Geertruydenbergh  it seem'd as if the Confederates were resolv'd to have no Peace at all but to push at the Ruin of the  French  Monarchy or that they were so confident  of their Strength as that they resolved to oblige  France  to offer  Charte Blanc  and beg Peace as we use to say on their Knees But  France  found out a Way to convince some of the Confederates that their Affairs were not brought so very low and the  British  Court as well moved with the Disorder of their own People as tired with the unequal Burthen of the War which had lain on them so heavy and so long began to shew an Inclination to renew a Treaty The Court of  France  fail'd not to lay hold of the Occasion and obtaining Leave at the  British  Court to make New Proposals a Minister was accordingly sent over thither who having on the Part of  France  made Proposals for treating of a General Peace in the usual Manner and promising largely to give Reasonable Satisfaction to all the Allies Her Majesty was prevailed with to interpose her Interest and Authority to obtain an Appointment and a Place was accordingly named  viz    Ʋtrecht  the particular History of which is not to the present Purpose and therefore is omitted here The Difficulties which many of the Confederates started and the Opposition they made to the Proposal of a Treaty are too publickly known to need that I repeat them here But their Management at the Treaty when they came there will take up some Room in the future History of that Affair and may be briefly hinted at  here The Imperial Court was long er'e they resolv'd to send any Plenipotentiaries at all the  StatesGeneral  appointed Four Ministers tho' as some reported they were rather Commissioners than Plenipotentiaries or Ambassadors and at length with great Difficulty the Treaty began Papers of Specific Demands were given in on either Hand when according to the usual Method of Treaties it was expected the Conferences among the Plenipotentiaries should have begun and each Party should have debated their own Pretensions when on a sudden the  Imperial  and  Dutch  Plenipotentiaries or Ministers refused absolutely to treat by Conference but demanded Answers in Writing of the  French  The  French  were surpriz'd at this Demand alledging  'That they had given in their Proposals to the Confederates at first and received the Demands of the Confederates and they were ready to enter upon the Particulars by Conference according to the usual Methods of Treaties That Answers in Writing tended only to prolong Time and to set the whole World making their popular Use of them That some of the Confederate Ministers had made use of the former Proposal to exasperate the rest of their Allies and to irrithe People against the  French  without entring into the particular Explications which they were ready to make of every  Head and had discovered that they came not with a Design to carry on a Treaty but to find an Occasion to break off the Treaty That there was no manner of Pretence for demanding more Answers in Writing but to have them Printed in every Country with such Representations however false as their Enemies thought fit to make of them and thereby to animate their People for carrying on their particular Designs that as to a Peace if it was sincerely intended there could be no Occasion for further writing of Papers or Proposals since they were all upon the Spot ready to enter into Conference with every Minister upon the particular Demands of their Principals in order to give Satisfaction to every one'  Now indeed the other Ministers had some Debates and the  British  Plenipotentiaries according to the Queen's Real Intention thought it was most reasonable to avoid Delays and to bring Things to a Head that they should enter on the Treaty by Conference but they were overruled and the Majority insisting upon the aforesaid Demand  viz  that the  French  should give in their Answer in Writing to the Demands of the Allies the  British  Ministers submitted and the  French  Ministers insisting on it and in particular that they had no Instructions on that Head all the Conferences broke off and the Treaty seem'd to be at a  full Stop Here it was that the Ministers of some of the Allies discovered that their Business at  Ʋtrecht  was not to Treat but to put a Stop to the Treaty and that they laid hold of every Occasion to interrupt and prevent the Proceedings much more the Conclusion of any such Thing as a Treaty of Peace for the said Ministers thinking they had effectually gained their Point did not stick to be very open upon this Head But they have been disappointed in this Design as they have been in many more by the Vigilance and Conduct of the  British  Ministers for Her Majesty finding this Secret Management of the said Ministers push'd plainly at destroying all the Hopes of a Peace by interrupting the Conferences took Occasion to let them know she would not be bound Apprentice to the War at the Will and Pleasure of the Allies but that since all which she was engaged to fight for and on which as a Foundation the War was begun being to be obtained by a Peace the Obligation to carry on the War ceased neither could any Christian Prince justifie the carrying on a Destructive War and the Shedding so much Blood if the Reasonable Satisfaction for which the War was begun might be obtain'd without it  Upon these Just and Rational Principles the Queen of  Great Britain  proceeded to adjust with the  French  the Conditions of Peace which Her Majesty thought fit to demand for Her own Subjects with most of which the  French  having complied there only remains the Satisfaction which Her Majesty demands for the rest of Her Allies and here it is to be remark'd for the Conviction of such as have reproached the Queen with forsaking her Engagements and Alliances that albeit Her Majesty might with good Reason have left the Allies to make the best Terms they could with  France  after Her own Terms were adjusted as above they having offered to impose the War upon Her in a Manner altogether unjustifiable yet Her Majesty far from suffering Herself to be guided by Her Resentments however Just has nevertheless made the Interest of the Allies Her own in every Particular and has forgotten no Material Demand which she thought fit for them to ask or  France  to grant to them but has insisted upon the same Demands which the said Confederates had made before so far as Her Majesty saw a Reason sufficient to demand the same  This is the Scheme then of the Treaty of Peace which is contained in Her Majesty's Speech to the Parliament wherein as there are several surprizing Concessions made by  France  which it was never thought he would be brought to comply with on the Part  of  GreatBritain  and for which the People of  Britain  have a great Reason not only to Bless Her Majesties Concern for the Good and Prosperity of Her own Subjects and Kingdoms but also to be very glad that the said Peace was not concluded in former Treaties where it was observable that no Provision was made for the Commerce or Interest of the People of  GreatBritain  but all the Interest of  Britain  employed in obtaining Powers and Advantages for the Confederates and for promoting the Interests and Greatness and Securities of the Emperor and the StatesGeneral upon Supposition that all our Security and Greatness was contained in the special and particular Interests of those Powers without any other Provisions for our own  These particular Advantages to  Britain  now obtain'd by this Treaty appears by a Scheme of a Peace laid by Her Majesty before Her Parliament  June  in Her late Speech and are as follows  A Treaty of Commerce entred upon and brought to this Perfection between  GreatBritain  and  France viz  that the rest being referr'd to a farther Regulation in the mean Time  the same Priviledges and Advantages as shall be granted to any other Nation by  France  shall be granted in like Manner to us  This is more than either was propos'd at the Treaty of the  Preliminaries or was obtain'd by the Treaty of  Reswick  all being left there to a Future Treaty of Commerce without putting that Treaty into any Method or making any previous Conditions as above for the maintaining the Advantages of  Britain  equal with other Nations in  France    The putting the whole Island of Sr  Christophers  into the Hands of the Queen of  GreatBritain  This is altogether New nor is the Advantage so inconsiderable as not to be very well worth Her Majesties Concern to demand and our Satisfaction in obtaining the Partition of that Island between us and the  French  having not only occasioned much Dammage and Blood but at last the utter Ruin of the  English  Settlement on that Island and of the poor Planters there by the cruel Devastation of the  French    The Security and Ease of our Colonies in  NorthAmerica  have likewise in former Treaties been too much forgotten the  English  Colonies in  Hudson  's  Bay  entirely ruined and possessed by the  French  even in time of Peace the  Newfoundland  Trade has been invaded and almost lost the  French  possessing the Fort of  Placentia  and the chief of the Fishing and the said Fort of  Placentia  not being at all restored in any former Treaty we shall now be absolute Masters of the Beaver Trade  to  Hudson  's  Bay  and the  Newfoundland  Fishing and the Colony of  NewEngland c  will be more particularly be secured and made safe by removing the  French  from  Accadia Nova Scotia  c where they became very troublesome Neighbours  The Island of  Minorca  in the  Mediterranean  is a Thing so Considerable to us as it cannot easily be judg'd of till future Occasions make it better understood not so much for the Advantage of Dominion on the Island itself tho' that is not inconsiderable as for the Possession of the greatest and best Harbour in the  Mediterranean  in which not only the Merchants of  Britain  will always have Shelter and Protection but where Her Majesty's Fleet may on all Occasions have a Station a Retreat a safe and commodious Harbour in Case of War especially in Case of War with the  Algerines Tripolins Tuniseens  and other Rovers of  Barbary  whose Coast is directly opposite to the said Island of  Minorca    The Town and Fortifications of  Gibraltar  are so good an Equivalent for the Loss of  Tangier  in former Times that it is hoped the Remembrance of the last may be forgotten in the much greater Advantages of the former without either the Expence or the Blood that always attended the Possession of  Tangier  and the Usefulness  of possessing a Road and a Town in the very Entrance of the  Straights  is too well understood to need any farther Enquiry about it  The securing to the  British  Merchants all the Advantages Rights and Priviledges of Trade in  Spain  that shall be granted to any other Nation This takes away that General Notion which was that a Difference should be made between the Subjects of  France  and those of other Nations in  Spain  with respect to Trade to the Advantage of the  French    The last Advantage of Trade we are to observe in this New Treaty is the  Assiento  or Contract with the  Spaniards  for furnishing the  Spanish WestIndies  with Negroes for Thirty Years this speaks itself and needs not that I should add any Thing but what is Natural  viz  that it is an Encrease of Trade to the  Britsh  Merchants and Traders to  Africa  of such a Consequence that we shall no Question improve to a very great Degree  These Seven are Particulars wholly left out or very much neglected in all the former Articles of whatever Kind which we have yet seen transacted with the  French  and which at least may afford us this Deduction  viz  that Her Majesty has been just so much more concern'd for the Good of Her own  Subjects than she was allow'd to be in the late Administration  As to the General Articles relating to the Pretender the Protestant Succession and the House of  Hannover  they stand as before  Come we now to enquire into the General Security and the Publick Peace and Interest of  Europe The Ballance of Power  has been always laid down as the First and most Essential Thing to be provided for as that on which the Safety of  Europe  depended and as the only Method which could be found out to prevent the Exorbitant Greatness of  France  and keep him from Overrunning the rest of Christendom and to keep up the general Harmony among the rest of the Powers of  Europe  This Ballance of Power was thought to be effectually destroyed by the Seizing of the  Spanish  Monarchy into the Hands of a Branch of the House of  Bourbon  by which was most justly apprehended that in Consequence of the usual Methods of the  French  Government the Great and Powerful Monarchies of  Spain  and  France  should immediately be united in the same Person which would be the apparent Ruin of the Peace of  Europe  To prevent this Melancholy View of the Publick Affairs of  Europe  the other Powers of that Part of  Europe  principally concerned took Arms and joined with the  Imperial  Armies which were then entred upon Action against  France  the Emperor  having begun the War the Year before This was called the Grand Alliance in which the abovesaid manifest Breach of the said Ballance of Power was made the most Essential Foundation and the obtaining a safe and lasting Peace was made the ultimate End as is more particularly exprest in the Preamble to and Article of the said Grand Alliance of which  Haec sunt Verba    'Whereas  Charles  II King of  Spain  of most Glorious Memory being not long since dead without Issue his Sacred Imperial Majesty has claimed the Succession in the Kingdoms and Provinces of the deceased King as lawfully belonging to his August Family but the most Christian King aiming at the same Succession for his Grandson Duke of  Anjou  and pretending a Right did accrue to him by a certain Will of the deceased King has usurped the Possession of the intire Inheritance for the aforesaid Duke of  Anjou  and Invaded by his Arms the Provinces of the  Spanish LowCountries  and the Dutchy of  Milan  has a Fleet ready fitted in the Port of  Cadiz  has sent several Ships of War to the  Spanish WestIndies  and by this and many other Ways the Kingdoms of  Spain  and  France  are so closely united and cemented that they may seem henceforward not to be otherwise considered than as  one and the same Kingdom so that it sufficiently appears unless timely Care be taken that his Imperial Majesty will be destitute of all Hopes of ever receiving Satisfaction in his Pretention the Sacred  Roman  Empire will lose its Rights in the Fiefs belonging to it in  Italy  and the  Spanish Netherlands  the free Intercourse of Navigation and Commerce which the  English  and  Dutch  have in the  Mediterranean  the  Indies  and other Places will be utterly destroyed and the  Ʋnited Provinces  will be deprived of the Security which they enjoyed by the Provinces of the  SpanishNetherlands  lying between them and the  French  which is commonly called a Barrier Lastly that the  French  and  Spaniards  being thus united will in a short Time become so formidable to all that they may easily assume to them the Dominion over all  Europe  and therefore by this Way of Proceeding of the most Christian King his  Imperial  Majesty was brought under a Necessity of sending an Army for the Preservation as well of his own Interest as the Fiefs of the Empire The King of  GreatBritain  has thought it requisite to send his Forces to the Assistance of the StatesGeneral whose Affairs are in the same Condition as if they were actually Invaded and the States whose Frontiers lye as it were in a manner exposed on all Sides by the breaking  and taking away of that since commonly called a Barrier which screened them from the Neighbourhood of the  French  are forced to do all these Things for the Safety of the Commonwealth which they should and could do if they were in a War and whereas so dubious a Posture of their Affairs is more dangerous than a War itself and that  France  and  Spain  take Advantage of this State of their Affairs to make a stronger and firmer Union among themselves for oppressing the Liberty of  Europe  and taking away the Freedom of Commerce these Reasons induced his Sacred  Imperial  Majesty his Sacred Royal Majesty of  GreatBritain  and the High and Mighty Lords the StatesGeneral of the  ƲnitedProvinces  to obviate so great Evils as might rise from thence and desiring as much as lyes in their Power to apply Remedies thereto have thought a strict Conjunction and Alliance between themselves necessary for repelling the Greatness of the common Danger'  This Ballance of Power being then the Foundation of the War it follows to enquire what were the Steps taken by each Party to preserve the same in the Prosecution of the War And for this we shall find the Method taken in the Beginning was to allot to each Power such Shares as  the whole thought fit and proper for them to enjoy and to cause them to enjoy and to cause them to acknowledge themselves satisfied with the same and solemnly to renounce any Claim to the other Parts which they may have other Rights unto this will appear in the Two several Treaties of Partition the first made by the late King  William  and the StatesGeneral with the King of  France  in Favour of the Electoral Prince of  Bavaria  deceased and the latter in Favour of the then Archduke  Charles  since become King of  Spain  and now Emperor from whence it appears that however some Complaints may have been made of the  French  King's little Regard to the Renunciation of the  Pyrenees  that yet not King  William  only but the StatesGeneral and other Princes of  Europe  did find it convenient and think it sufficicient to depend upon such Solemn Renunciations as sufficient Securities together with the other Provisions of those Treaties against the future Attempts as well of  France  as of other Powers concerned in those Treaties This is expressed more plainly in the said Treaties of Partition thus  'On the Account of which said Kingdoms Islands Provinces Places the said most Christian King as well in his own as in the Name of  Monseigneur  the  Dauphin  his Male Children or  c  who hath also given his full Power to the Count  de Tallard  and to the Count  de Briord  Promising and Engaging themselves to renounce at the opening of the said Succession of  Spain  as in this Case they have at this Time renounced by these Presents all their Rights and Pretensions to the said Crown of  Spain  and to all the other Kingdoms Islands States Lands and Places which at this Time depend thereupon except what is above excepted for his Part all which they shall confirm by Solemn Acts in the most Authentick and best Form'  And again on the contrary Part of the same Treaty where you have the following Words  'And the said Emperor as well in his own Names as in that of the King of the  Romans  the most Serene Archduke  Charles  his Second Son the Archdutchess his Daughters his Children Male  c  or their Issue As also the said King of the  Romans  in his own Name shall renounce when they shall enter into and ratifie the Present Treaty and the most Serene Archduke  Charles  as soon as he shall be of Age all other Rights and Pretensions to the said Kingdoms Islands States Lands and Places which compose  the Share or Portion assign'd to  Monseigneur  the  Dauphin  and of him who shall have the Dutchy of  Milan  in Exchange of what shall be given to  Monseigneur  the  Dauphin  of all which they shall cause the most Solemn and Authentick Acts to be made that may be that is to say the Emperor and the King of the  Romans  when they shall ratifie this Present Treaty of the most Serene ArchDuke as soon as he shall come of Age which shall be delivered to his  Britannick  Majesty and the said StatesGeneral'  By these Articles it appears that notwithstanding all the Pretensions made against the King of  France  for the Breaches made by him of such former Treaties and the pretended Insufficiency of such Acts of Renunciation to bind the King of  France  where his Interest interferes therewith yet that the said late King  William  the StatesGeneral as well as the other Protestant Powers of  Europe  either did think such Renunciations sufficient or found no other Way Practicable to bind the said Princes and Powers than such Renunciations and that therefore they were not the less to be made Use of or had Recourse to on such Occasions however the King of  France  might have disregarded the former Renunciations of the  Pyrenees    The Queen of  GreatBritain  having then found it necessary in the Prosecution of this War to hearken to such Proposals of Peace as have been made on the Part of  France  in order to put an End to this Bloody and Tedious War it cannot seem so strange a Thing as some People would imagine or perswade us that Her Majesty should lay some Stress on the Validity of a Formal Renunciation on the Part of the Duke of  Anjou  as it respects the Claim the said Duke of  Anjou  has or may have in case of the Demise of the present  Dauphin  of  France  to the Dominions of his Grandfather the present King of  France    Having then proved the Reasonableness of continuing the said Form in Treaties of Peace I shall now examine what Difference there appears between the said former Renunciations of the King of  France  and the present Renunciation proposed and wherein the Security of this present Renunciation consists In Order to this it seems necessary to look back into the Nature and Reason of the Proposals of Peace It is known as above that the Breach of the said Ballance of Power in  Europe  consisted in the Conjunction of the Interests and Powers of the respective Monarchies of  France  and  Spain  it is confest it were to have been wish'd on this Account that it had pleased God that either the Electoral  Prince of  Bavaria  to whom  Spain  was allotted by the first Treaty of Partition mentioned above or the Late Emperor  Joseph  had not died without Heirs so as that the Possession of the  Imperal  Dignity or the Dominions of the House of  Austria  had not descended to the Person of the present Emperor But these Events having fallen in and it being impossible to prevent the Consequences attending the Case must therefore be considered as it is not as it were wished to have been The King of  France  and the Emperor of  Germany  are the only Competitors for the  Spanish  Monarchy There is no room to doubt but the Ballance of Power is entirely broken whichsoever of these Two we to possess the whole of this new Prize So that it seems necessary to the Peace of  Europe  that some Medium be found out to adjust this Matter  It is not the present Work to offer Mediums but to consider the Validity of those already offered Her Majesty has in Her Speech to the Parliament given in a Scheme on which this great Work is to be or may be founded and has added under Her own Royal Authority that by this Scheme the Three greatest Things in the present Disputes about Peace are provided for  viz  That  France  and  Spain  are more effectually divided than ever  That a real Ballance of Power will be fixed in  Europe  liable to as few Accidents as Human Affairs can be exempted from  That the Nature of the Proposal is such that it executes itself  These Articles seem to be thus explained    That  France  and  Spain  are more effectually divided than ever  that is that the Duke of  Berry  being declared next Heir in Case of the Death of the  Dauphin  without Heirs  France  will be Embark'd by him  he being in immediate Possession  against  Spain  which may be supposed to assist King  Philip  and that the Duke of  Berry  will not fail to defend his own Pretensions this seems to be founded upon so good Authority that if he should be supposed to give it up he must act against Reason and Nature    That a real Ballance of Power will be fixed in  Europe  liable to as few Accidents as Human Affairs can be exempted from  This is built on the Supposition of the respective Parties being divided as above the Consequence of which may be that they will be ever fortifying their Interest with Friends and Confederates Leagues and Treaties one against the other  viz  the House of  Austria  will not fail to be strictly Allied to and in the Interest of the King of  Spain  as ever in so far as the Alliance respects  France  because of the View that House will have to  their own Claim of the Crown which is for ever to be excluded from the House of  Bourbon  after the Failure of the Heirs of King  Philip      That the Nature of the Proposal is such that it executes itself  this is the just Inference from the other Two signifying that  as before  the Successors of the King of  France  in Failure of the  Dauphin  will naturally stand up against  Philip  and insist upon the Renunciation made at this Treaty and will therefore exclude him from any Pretensions with all their Power The Confederates will naturally and for the same Reasons which induced them to commence and carry on this War fall in and join themselves to the said Sons of  France  to keep out the King of  Spain  and prevent his succeeding from that one received Maxim which I mentioned at the first of this Work  viz  that it is inconsistent with the Safety and Peace of  Europe  that the Monarchies of  France  and  Spain  should be possessed by the same Person and on the other Hand  Spain  itself will unwillingly Succour or Further the Pretensions of their Kings as what is several Ways against their Interest and would reduce their Country to be but a Dependent on and as a Province to the Kingdom of  France    To come a little into the Sense of these Things it seems necessary to observe here That the effectually establishing a Ballance of Power in  Europe  is the real End and Design of this War all the Declarations all the Publick Papers all the Arguments on both Sides are full of this both the Treaties of Partition the Renunciation at the  Pyrencan  Treaty the setting up King  Charles  the opposing the Possession of King  Philip  all these are founded on this Notion that the Safety of  Europe  consists in maintaining an equal Ballance of Power among the several Princes and States concerned in this War That the effectual dividing of the Interests of  Spain  and  France  is the only effectual Method for preserving this Ballance of Power And then it will come to be enquired Whether the present Scheme of  Philip  's Renunciation be an effectual dividing the Interests of  Spain  and  France  yea or no  That the effectual establishing a Ballance of Power in  Europe  is the real End and Design of the War Her Majesties Declaration of War and the Declarations of the Princes and Powers now engaged in this War together with the Grand Alliance among the Confederates will all testifie in Defence of this Proposition and to them I refer my Reader wherein the Liberty of  Europe  the Publick Tranquility the Ballance of  Europe  are Terms used to  signifie the same Thing and are all along made Use of as the Reasons of the War as in Her Majesties Declaration of War  May  and likewise in the Declaration or  Manifesto  of the StatesGeneral  May    Many the like might be produced to prove if it were needful that these were the true Grounds of the War but this being sufficient I pass to the next Head  viz    That effectual dividing the Interest of  France  and  Spain  is the only way to preserve or restore the Ballance of Power in  Europe This also is as evident from the Course of the whole War the setting up King  Charles  as King of  Spain  had no other Foundation for he had at that Time no Pretence to Claim the Crown of  Spain  his Elder Brother being alive and having Children to succeed but the Crown of  Spain  was allotted to him on this very Foundation that the Monarchy of  France  might have nothing to do with the Dominions of  Spain  in all the Treaties that have been set on Foot on every Hand for the putting an End to the War this has been the Foundation of all the rest  viz  that the Kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  might not come into the Possession of the same Prince Nay the King of  France  himself has acknowledged it to be a just Foundation and has made it the Foot upon which he has always made his Proposals of Peace as is apparent from the  late Proposals called the Six Preliminaries wherein he owns in express Terms that it is not safe for  Europe  that  France  and  Spain  should come to be Governed by the same Person at the same Time and therefore proposes to give sufficient Security to the Allies that such a Thing should never happen This Maxim is deduced from the former  viz  the preserving the Ballance of Power in  Europe  and is the main Point for which this Bloody War has been so long carried on  But all the Schemes for bringing this to pass have hitherto proved ineffectual the War hath proved tedious and tiresome and the Nations have been exhausted to such a Degree by it that the Subjects on every Side call for Peace the  French  tho' pushed with great Success and with infinite Losses every Year yet lose their Ground by Inches Twice they have beaten the Confederates out of  Spain  although they had possessed even the Capital City and the Principal Provinces and they still appear in a Formidable Posture on the Frontiers so that it seems to be still the Work of many Years to Reduce them On the other Hand the several Offers  France  has made of evacuating  Spain  has been look'd upon as unsafe or insincere But Providence having removed the Princes of the House of  Bourbon  on the one Hand and brought King  Charles  to the  Imperial  Dignity on the  other by which it appears that the same Reasons for settling the Crown of  Spain  on his Head doth not exist as before and that it might be equally dangerous to  Europe  to make one and the same Person Emperor and King of  Spain  as King of  France  and  Spain  the said Ballance of  Europe  being thereby destroyed as much the one Way as the other this being the Case a new Expedient offers  viz  to make a new Establishment or Entail of the several Crowns of  France  and  Spain  so that the Interests of several Princes might be rendered Incompatible and that it might appear divided in those Interests so that it being naturally impossible for them to agree as to Soveraignity the Peace of  Europe  might be secured as the Consequence  To bring this to pass mutual Renunciations have been also needful but as these Things called Renunciations have suffered some Scandal in the Eyes of the Confederates it might be expected the Opposers of Peace would immediately object against the very Word itself as unsatisfactory But considering Men always distinguish of Matters in order to judge rightly and in doing this it will appear that as in Her Majesties Speech it is observed this Treaty executes itself so that the Validity of this Article does not  so much  consist in the Validity of the Renunciation as the Validity of the Renunciation depends upon the Nature of the  Thing for Example supposing the Crown of  France  falls as may be said by Descent to the present  Philip  the Duke of  Berry  being declared  Dauphin  by Virtue of this Treaty and being immediately in Possession of the Crown of  France  no Man can think so absurdly as to suppose he will demit to his Brother  Philip  who also has given up his Right Nor can any Man suggest that  Philip  can force him to it after he is in Possession for it will always be allowed that there will be a great Difference between a King of  Spain  renouncing  France  and a King of  France  renouncing  Spain  as to the Power of forcing their Pretensions This then being the Case here there remains no more Difficulty but that the Circumstances of the Two Persons will effectually divide the Kingdoms for if the Duke of  Berry  who is the younger Brother keeps the Crown of  France  not the House of  Austria  would be more inconsistent with his Interest than his Brother  Philip  who cannot but with Regret see him established on a Throne which was his Birthright and which he had with  Esau  given up for a Mess of  Spanish  Pottage  The Renunciation join'd with Want of Power has double Efficacy in this Case and I see nothing remaining to doubt the Duke of  Berry  being able to maintain himself against  Philip  unless we should suppose a Faction in  France  to Favour King  Philip  which considering the absolute Dominions of the Kings of  France  is also not very probable but if this should happen then are all the Confederates engaged as Allies to the Duke of  Berry  to support him in his Claim and so  France Britain Holland  and the  Empire  are in Confederacy against  Spain  which is such a wild Disproportion that the Danger cannot be thought sufficient to any wise Man to make the least Uneasiness in our Minds On the other Hand if the present  Dauphin  lives and should have Children as may very probably happen then the whole  Chimera  vanishes at once and the Renunciation may never come to take Place or if it do it may be so many Ages hence that no Man can so much as suggest what the Circumstances  of that Time may be or make any Provision against it Be  then that either of these Cases are the present State of  Europe  as one of them must be what rational Doubt can any Man start in the present Case why this is not a sufficient Security to  Europe  against the Fear of uniting the Kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  since to argue against it must be to argue against Human Nature And suppose the young Duke of  Berry  who is a Prince of as much Fire as most Men in  Europe  should tamely and quietly give up his Claim to the Crown of  France  and that too after he is in Possession of it and quit it to his Brother who has been expung'd by his own voluntary Act and Deed and by a Formal Renunciation which is made Legal and accepted in all the most effectual and strongest Terms in the  French  Constitution and all this to be done by the strongest Prince to the weakest by the Prince who hath Power in his Hands to keep Possession to that Prince who hath no Power forcibly to dispossess him  These are Absurdities necessary only to a baffled Argument and which none but the weakest People in the World would lay any Weight upon and serve only to confirm any reasonable Person in the Validity of this Renunciation and in the Truth of what Her Majesty has laid down in these Three Heads  That the Ballance of Power is secured  That the Kingdoms of  France  and  Spain  are divided effectually  That the Nature of the Treaty is such that it executes itself  FINIS
