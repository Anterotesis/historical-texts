THE  Apollo Press  BY THE MARTINS  Anno    ODES ON SEVERAL SUBJECTS IN TWO BOOKS  BOOK I ODE I PREFACE  I  ON yonder verdant hillock laid  Where oaks and elms a friendly shade  O'erlook the falling stream  O master of the Latin lyre  A while with thee will I retire  From summer's noontide beam  II  And lo within my lonely bow'r  Th' industrious bee from many a flow'r  Collects her balmy dews  "For me" she sings "the gems are born  "For me their silken robe adorn  "Their fragrant breath diffuse"  III  Sweet Murmurer may no rude storm  This hospitable scene deform  Nor check thy gladsome toils  Still may the buds unsully'd spring  Still show'rs and sunshine court thy wing  To these ambrosial spoils  IV  Nor shall my Muse hereafter fail  Her sellowlab'rer thee to hail  And lucky be the strains  For long ago did Nature frame  Your seasons and your arts the same  Your pleasures and your pains  V  Like thee in lowly sylvan scenes  On riverbanks and flow'ry greens  My Muse delighted plays  Nor thro' the desert of the air  Tho' swans or eagles triumph there  With fond ambition strays  VI  Nor where the boding raven chants  Nor near the owl's unhallow'd haunts  Will she her cares employ  But flies from ruins and from tombs  From Superstition's horrid glooms  To daylight and to joy  VII  Nor will she tempt the barren waste  Nor deigns the lurking strength to taste  Of any noxious thing  But leaves with scorn to Envy's use  Th' insipid nightshade's baneful juice  The nettle's sordid sting  VIII  From all which Nature fairest knows  The vernal blooms the summer rose  She draws her blameless wealth  And when the gen'rous task is done  She consecrates a double boon  To pleasure and to health  ODE II ON THE WINTER SOLSTICE MDCCXL  I  THE radiant ruler of the year  At length his wintry goal attains  Soon to reverse the long career  And northward bend his steady reins  Now piercing half Potosi's height  Prone rush the siery floods of light  Ripening the mountain's silver stores  While in some cavern's horrid shade  The panting Indian hides his head  And oft' th' approach of eve implores  II  But lo on this deserted coast  How pale the sun how thick the air  Must'ring his storms a sordid host  Lo Winter desolates the year  The fields resign their latest bloom  No more the breezes waft perfume  No more the streams in musick roll  But snows fall dark or rains resound  And while great Nature mourns around  Her griefs infect the human soul  III  Hence the loud city's busy throngs  Urge the warm bowl and splendid sire  Harmonious dances festive songs  Against the spiteful heav'n conspire  Meantime perhaps with tender fears  Some villagedame the curfew hears  While round the hearth her children play  At morn their father went abroad  The moon is sunk and deep the road  She sighs and wonders at his stay  IV  But thou my Lyre awake arise  And hail the sun's returning force  Ev'n now he climbs the northern skies  And health and hope attend his course  Then louder howl th' aerial waste  Be earth with keener cold embrac'd  Yet gentle hours advance their wing  And Fancy mocking Winter's might  With flow'rs and dews and streaming light  Already decks the newborn spring  V  O Fountain of the golden day  Could mortal vows promote thy speed  How soon before thy vernal ray  Should each unkindly damp recede  How soon each hov'ring tempest fly  Whose stores for mischief arm the sky  Prompt on our heads to burst amain  To rend the forest from the steep  Or thund'ring o'er the Baltick deep  To whelm the merchant's hopes of gain  VI  But let not man's unequal views  Presume o'er Nature and her laws  'Tis his with grateful joy to use  Th' indulgence of the Sovran Cause  Secure that health and beauty springs  Thro' this majestick frame of things  Beyond what he can reach to know  And that Heav'n's allsubduing will  With good the progeny of ill  Attemp'reth ev'ry state below  VII  How pleasing wears the wintry night  Spent with the old illustrious dead  While by the taper's trembling light  I seem those awful scenes to tread  Where chiefs or legislators lie  Whose triumphs move before my eye  In arms and antick pomp array'd  While now I taste th' Ionian song  Now bend to Plato's godlike tongue  Resounding thro' the olive shade  VIII  But should some cheerful equal friend  Bid leave the studious page a while  Let Mirth on Wisdom then attend  And social Ease on learned Toil  Then while at Love's uncareful shrine  Each dictates to the god of Wine  Her name whom all his hopes obey  What flatt'ring dreams each bosom warm  While absence height'ning ev'ry charm  Invokes the slowreturning May  IX  May thou delight of heav'n and earth  When will thy genial star arise  Th' auspicious morn which gives thee birth  Shall bring Eudora to my eyes  Within her sylvan haunt behold  As in the happy garden old  She moves like that primeval fair  Thither ye silversounding Lyres  Ye tender Smiles ye chaste Desires  Fond Hope and mutual Faith repair  X  And if believing Love can read  His better omens in her eye  Then shall my fears O charming Maid  And ev'ry pain of absence die  Then shall my jocund harp attun'd  To thy true ear with sweeter sound  Pursue the free Horatian song  Old Tyne shall listen to my tale  And Echo down the bord'ring vale  The liquid melody prolong  ODE II FOR THE WINTER SOLSTICE December  This Ode was afterwards entirely altered as may be seen p The reader will not be displeased to see it as it was originally written    I  Now to the utmost southern goal  The sun has trac'd his annual way  And backward now prepares to roll  And bless the North with earlier day  Prone on Potosi's lofty brow  Floods of sublimer splendour flow  Ripening the latent seeds of gold  Whilst panting in the lonely shade  Th' afflicted Indian hides his head  Nor dares the blaze of noon behold  II  But lo' on this deserted coast  How faint the light how chill the air  Lo arm'd with whirlwind hail and frost  Fierce Winter desolates the year  The fields resign their cheerful bloom  No more the breezes breathe perfume  No more the warbling waters roll  Deserts of snow fatigue the eye  Successive tempests bloat the sky  And gloomy damps oppress the soul  III  But let my drooping genius rise  And hail the sun's remotest ray  Now now he climbs the northern skies  Tomorrow nearer than today  Then louder howl the stormy waste  By sand and ocean worse defac'd  Yet brighter hours are on the wing  And Fancy thro' the wintry gloom  Radiant with dews and flow'rs in bloom  Already hails th' emerging spring  IV  O Fountain of the golden day  Could mortal vows but urge thy speed  How soon before the vernal ray  Should each unkindly damp recede  How soon each tempest hov'ring fly  That now fermenting loads the sky  Prompt on our heads to burst amain  To rend the forest from the steep  And thund'ring o'er the Baltick deep  To whelm the merchant's hopes of gain  V  But let not man's imperfect views  Presume to tax wise Nature's laws  'Tis his with silent joy to use  Th' indulgence of the Sov'reign Cause  Secure that from the whole of things  Beauty and good consummate springs  Beyond what he can reach to know  And that the providence of Heav'n  Has some peculiar blessing giv'n  To each allotted state below  VI  Ev'n now how sweet the wintry night  Spent with the old illustrious dead  While by the taper's trembling light  I seem the awful course to tread  Where chiefs and legislators lie  Whose triumphs move before my eye  With ev'ry laurel fresh display'd  While charm'd I rove in classick song  Or bend to Freedom's fearless tongue  Or walk the academick shade  ODE III TO A FRIEND UNSUCCESSFUL IN LOVE  I  INDEED my Phaedria if to find  That wealth can female wishes gain  Had e'er disturb'd your thoughtful mind  Or cost one serious moment's pain  I should have said that all the rules  You learn'd of moralists and schools  Were very useless very vain  II  Yet I perhaps mistake the case  Say tho' with this heroick air  Like one that holds a nobler chase  Y  u try the tender loss to bear  Does not your heart renounce your tongue  Seems not my censure strangely wrong  To count it such a slight affair  III  When Hesper gilds the shaded sky  Oft' as you seek the wellknown grove  Methinks I see you cast your eye  Back to the morning scenes of love  Each pleasing word you heard her say  Her gentle look her graceful way  Again your struggling fan  y move  IV  Then tell me is your soul entire  Does Wisdom calmly hold her throne  Then can you question each desire  Bid this remain and that be gone  No tear half starting from your eye  No kindling blush you know not why  No stealing sigh nor stifled groan  V  Away with this unmanly mood  See where the hoary churl appears  Whose hand hath seiz'd the fav'rite good  Which you reserv'd for happier years  While side by side the blushing maid  Shrinks from his visage half afraid  Spite of the sickly joy she wears  VI  Ye guardian Pow'rs of Love and Fame  This chaste harmonious pair behold  And thus reward the gen'rous flame  Of all who barter vows for gold  O bloom of youth O tender charms  Well bury'd in a dotard's arms  O equal price of beauty sold  VII  Cease then to gaze with looks of love  Bid her adieu the venal fair  Unworthy she your bless to prove  Then wherefore should she prove your care  No lay your myrtle garland down  And let a while the willow's crown  With luckier omens bind your hair  VIII  O just ecaped the faithless main  Tho' driv'n unwilling on the land  To guide your favour'd steps again  Behold your better genius stand  Where Truth revolves her page divine  Where Virtue leads to Honour's shrine  Behold he lifts his awful hand  IX  Fix but on these your ruling aim  And Time the sire of manly care  Will Fancy's dazzling colours tame  A sob'rer dress will Beauty wear  Then shall Esteem by Knowledge led  Inthrone within your heart and head  Some happier love some truer fair  ODE IV AFFECTED INDIFFERENCE TO THE SAME  I  YES you contemn the perjur'd maid  Who all your fav'rite hopes betray'd  Nor tho' her heart should home return  Her tuneful tongue its falsehood mourn  Her winning eyes your faith implore  Would you her hand receive again  Or once dissemble your disdain  Or listen to the Siren's theme  Or stoop to love since now esteem  And confidence and friendship is no more  II  Yet tell me Phaedria tell me why  When summoning your pride you try  To meet her looks with cool neglect  Or cross her walk with slight respect  For so is falsehood best repaid  Whence do your cheeks indignant glow  Why is your struggling tongue so slow  What means that darkness on your brow  As if with all her broken vow  You meant the fair apostate to upbraid  ODE V AGAINST SUSPICION  I  On fly it is dire Suspicion's mien  And meditating plagues unseen  The sorc'ress hither bends  Behold her torch in gall imbru'd  Beholdher garment drops with blood  Of lovers and of friends  II  Fly far already in your eyes  I see a pale suffusion rise  And soon thro' ev'ry vein  Soon will her secret venom spread  And all your heart and all your head  Imbibe the potent stain  III  Then many a demon will she raise  To vex your sleep to haunt your ways  While gleams of lost delight  Raise the dark tempest of the brain  As lightning shines across the main  Thro' whirlwinds and thro' night  IV  No more can Faith or Candour move  But each ingenuous deed of love  Which Reason would applaud  Now smiling o'er her dark distress  Fancy malignant strives to dress  Like Injury and Fraud  V  Farewell to Virtue's peaceful times  Soon will you stoop to act the crimes  Which thus you stoop to fear  Guilt follows guilt and where the train  Begins with wrongs of such a stain  What horrours form the rear  VI  'Tis thus to work her baleful pow'r  Suspicion waits the sullen hour  Of fretfulness and strife  When care th' infirmer bosom wrings  Or Eurus waves his murky wings  To damp the seats of life  VII  But come forsake the scene unblest  Which first beheld your faithful breast  To groundless fears a prey  Come where with my prevailing lyre  The skies the streams the groves conspire  To charm your doubts away  VIII  Thron'd in the Sun's descending car  What pow'r unseen diffuseth far  This tenderness of mind  What genius smiles on yonder flood  What god in whispers from the wood  Bids ev'ry thought be kind  IX  O thou whate'er thy awful name  Whose wisdom our untoward frame  With social love restrains  Thou who by fair affection's ties  Giv'st us to double all our joys  And half disarm our pains  X  Let universal candour still  Clear as yon' heav'nreflecting rill  Preserve my open mind  Nor this nor that man's crooked ways  One sordid doubt within me raise  To injure humankind  ODE VI HYMN TO CHEERFULNESS  How thick the shades of ev'ning close  How pale the sky with weight of snows  Haste light the tapers urge the fire  And bid the joyless day retire  Alas in vain I try within  To brighten the dejected scene  While rous'd by grief these fiery pains  Tear the frail texture of my veins  While Winter's voice that storms around  And yon' deep deathbell's groaning sound  Renew my mind's oppressive gloom  Till starting Horrour shakes the room  Is there in Nature no kind pow'r  To sooth Affliction's lonely hour  To blunt the edge of dire disease  And teach these wintry shades to please  Come Cheerfulness triumphant Fair  Shine thro' the hov'ring cloud of care  O sweet of language mild of mien  O Virtue's friend and Pleasure's queen  Assuage the flames that burn my breast  Compose my jarring thoughts to rest  And while thy gracious gifts I feel  My song shall all thy praise reveal  As once it was in Astrea's reign  The vernal pow'rs renew'd their train  It happen'd that immortal Love  Was ranging thro' the spheres above  And downward hither cast his eye  The year's returning pomp to spy  He saw the radiant god of Day  Waft in his car the rosy May  The fragrant Airs and genial Hours  Were shedding round him dews and flow'rs  Before his wheels Aurora past  And Hesper's golden lamp was last  But fairest of the blooming throng  When Health majestick mov'd along  Delighted to survey below  The joys which from her presence flow  While earth enliven'd hears her voice  And swains and flocks and fields rejoice  Then mighty Love her charms confest  And soon his vows inclin'd her breast  And known from that auspicious morn  The pleasing Cheerfulness was born  Thou Cheerfulness by Heav'n design'd  To sway the movements of the mind  Whatever fretful passion springs  Whatever wayward fortune brings  To disarrange the pow'r within  And strain the musical machine  Thou Coddess thy attemp'ring hand  Doth each discordant string command  Refines the soft and swells the strong  And joining Nature's gen'ral song  Thro' many a varying tone unfolds  The harmony of human souls  Fair Guardian of domestick life  Kind Banisher of homebred strife  Nor sullen lip nor taunting eye  Deforms the scene where thou art by  No sick'ning husband damns the hour  Which bound his joys to female pow'r  No pining mother weeps the cares  Which parents waste on thankless heirs  Th' officious daughters pleas'd attend  The brother adds the name of friend  By thee with flow'rs their board is crown'd  With songs from thee their walks resound  And morn with welcome lustre shines  And ev'ning unperceiv'd declines  Is there a youth whose anxious heart  Labours with love's unpity'd smart  Tho' now he stray by rills and bow'rs  And weeping waste the lonely hours  Or if the nymph her audience deign  Debase the story of his pain  With slavish looks discolour'd eyes  And accents falt'ring into sighs  Yet thou auspicious Pow'r with ease  Canst yield him happier arts to please  Inform his mien with manlier charms  Instruct his tongue with nobler arms  With more commanding passion move  And teach the dignity of love  Friend to the Muse and all her train  For thee I court the Muse again  The Muse for thee may well exert  Her pomp her charms her fondest art  Who owes to thee that pleasing sway  Which earth and peopled heav'n obey  Let Melancholy's plaintive tongue  Repeat what later bards have sung  But thine was Homer's ancient might  And thine victorious Pindar's flight  Thy hand each Lesbian wreath attir'd  Thy lips Sicilian reeds inspir'd  Thy spirit lent the glad perfume  Whence yet the stow'rs of Teos bloom  Whence yet from Tibur's Sabine vale  Delicious blows th' enliv'ning gale  While Horace calls thy sportive choir  Heroes and nymphs around his lyre  But see where yonder pensive sage  A prey perhaps to Fortune's rage  Perhaps by tender griefs opprest  Or glooms congenial to his breast  Retires in desert scenes to dwell  And bids the joyless world farewell  Alone he treads th' autumnal shade  Alone beneath the mountain laid  He sees the nightly damps ascend  And gath'ring storms aloft impend  He hears the neighb'ring surges roll  And raging thunders shake the pole  Then struck by ev'ry object round  And stunn'd by ev'ry horrid sound  He asks a clue for Nature's ways  But evil haunts him thro' the maze  He sees ten thousand demons rise  To wield the empire of the skies  And Chance and Fate assume the rod  And Malice blot the throne of God  O thou whose pleasing pow'r I sing  Thy lenient influence hither bring  Compose the storm dispel the gloom  Till Nature wear her wonted bloom  Till fields and shades their sweets exhale  And musick swell each op'ning gale  Then o'er his breast thy sostness pour  And let him learn the timely hour  To trace the world's benignant laws  And judge of that Presiding Cause  Who founds on discord Beauty's reign  Converts to pleasure ev'ry pain  Subdues each hostile form to rest  And bids the universe be blest  O thou whose pleasing pow'r I sing  If right I touch the votive string  If equal praise I yield thy name  Still govern thou thy poet's flame  Still with the Muse my bosom share  And sooth to peace intruding care  But most exert thy pleasing pow'r  On friendship's consecrated hour  And while my Sophron points the road  To godlike Wisdom's calm abode  Or warm in freedom's ancient cause  Traceth the source of Albion's laws  Add thou o'er all the gen'rous toil  The light of thy unclouded smile  But if by Fortune's stubborn sway  From him and friendship torn away  I court the Muse's healing spell  For griefs that still with absence dwell  Do thou conduct my fancy's dreams  To such indulgent placid themes  As just the struggling breast may cheer  And just suspend the starting tear  Yet leave that sacred sense of wo  Which none but friends and lovers know  ODE VII ON THE USE OF POETRY  I  NOT for themselves did humankind  Contrive the parts by Heav'n assign'd  On life's wide scene to play  Not Scipio's force nor Caesar's skill  Can conquer glory's arduous hill  If Fortune close the way  II  Yet still the selfdepending soul  Tho' last and least in Fortune's roll  His proper sphere commands  And knows what Nature's seal bestow'd  And sees before the throne of God  The rank in which he stands  III  Who train'd by laws the future age  Who rescu'd nations from the rage  Of partial factious pow'r  My heart with distant homage views  Content if thou celestial Muse  Didst rule my natal hour  IV  Not far beneath the hero's feet  Nor from the legislator's seat  Stands far remote the bard  Tho' not with publick terrours crown'd  Yet wider shall his rule be found  More lasting his award  V  Lycurgus fashion'd Sparta's fame  And Pompey to the Roman name  Gave universal sway  Where are theyHomer's rev'rend page  Holds empire to the thirtieth age  And tongues and climes obey  VI  And thus when William's acts divine  No longer shall from Bourbon's line  Draw one vindictive vow  When Sidney shall with Cato rest  And Russel move the patriot's breast  No more than Brutus now  VII  Yet then shall Shakespeare's pow'rful art  O'er ev'ry passion ev'ry heart  Confirm his awful throne  Tyrants shall bow before his laws  And freedom's glory's virtue's cause  Their dread assertor own  ODE VIII ON LEAVING HOLLAND  I  FAREWELL to Leyden's lonely bound  The Belgian Muse's sober seat  Where dealing frugal gifts around  To all the fav'rites at her feet  She trains the body's bulky frame  For passive persevering toils  And lest from any prouder aim  The daring mind should scorn her homely spoils  She breathes maternal fogs to damp its restless flame  I  Farewell the grave pacifick air  Where never mountain zephir blew  The marshy levels lank and bare  Which Pan which Ceres never knew  The Naiads with obscene attire  Urging in vain their urns to flow  While round them chant the croking choir  And haply sooth some lover's prudent wo  Or prompt some restive bard and modulate his lyre  I  Farewell ye Nymphs whom sober care of gain  Snatch'd in your cradles from the god of Love  She render'd all his boasted arrows vain  And all his gifts did he in spite remove  Ye too the slowey'd Fathers of the land  With whom dominion steals from hand to hand  Unown'd undignify'd by publick choice  I go where Liberty to all is known  And tells a monarch on his throne  He reigns not but by her preserving voice  II  O my lov'd England when with thee  Shall I sit down to part no more  Far from this pale discolour'd sea  That sleeps upon the reedy shore  When shall I plough thy azure tide  When on thy hills the flocks admire  Like mountain snows till down their side  I trace the village and the sacred spire  While bow'rs and copses green the golden slope divide  II  Ye Nymphs who guard the pathless grove  Ye Blueey'd Sisters of the streams  With whom I wont at morn to rove  With whom at noon I talk'd in dreams  O take me to your haunts again  The rocky spring the greenwood glade  To guide my lonely footsteps deign  To prompt my slumbers in the murm'ring shade  And sooth my vacant ear with many an airy strain  II  And thou my faithful Harp no longer mourn  Thy drooping master's inauspicious hand  Now brighter skies and fresher gales return  Now fairer maids thy melody demand  Daughters of Albion listen to my lyre  O Phoebus guardian of th'Aonian choir  Why sounds not mine harmonious as thy own  When all the virgin deities above  With Venus and with Juno move  In concert round th' Olympian Father's throne  III  Thee too Protectress of my lays  Elate with whose majestick call  Above degen'rate Latium's praise  Above the slavish boast of Gaul  I dare from impious thrones reclaim  And wanton Sloth's ignoble charms  The honours of a poet's name  To Somers' counsels or to Hamden's arms  Thee Freedom I rejoin and bless thy genuine flame  III  Great Citizen of Albion thee  Heroick Valour still attends  And useful Science pleas'd to see  How Art her studious toil extends  While Truth diffusing from on high  A lustre unconfin'd as day  Fills and commands the publick eye  Till pierc'd and sinking by her pow'rful ray  Tame Faith and monkish Awe like nightly demons fly  III  Hence the whole land the patriot's ardour shares  Hence dread Religion dwells with social Joy  And holy passions and unsully'd cares  In youth in age domestick life employ  O fair Britannia hailWith partial love  The tribes of men their native seats approve  Unjust and hostile to each foreign fame  But when for gen'rous minds and manly laws  A nation holds her prime applause  There publick zeal shall all reproof disclaim  ODE IX TO CURIO  See The Epistle to Curio in this volume  MDCCXLIV  I  THRICE hath the spring beheld thy faded fame  Since I exulting grasp'd the tuneful shell  Eager thro' endless years to sound thy name  Proud that my memory with thine should dwell  How hast thou stain'd the splendour of my choice  Those godlike forms which hover'd round thy voice  Laws Freedom Glory whither are they flown  What can I now of thee to time report  Save thy fond Country made thy impious sport  Her fortune and her hope the victims of thy own  II  There are with eyes unmov'd and reckless heart  Who saw thee from thy summit fall thus low  Who deem'd thy arm extended but to dart  The publick vengeance on thy private foe  But spite of ev'ry gloss of envious minds  The owley'd race whom virtue's lustre blinds  Who sagely prove that each man hath his price  I still believ'd thy aim from blemish free  I yet ev'n yet believe it spite of thee  And all thy painted pleas to greatness and to vice  III  "Thou didst not dream of Liberty decay'd  "Nor wish to make her guardian laws more strong  "But the rash many first by thee misled  "Bore thee at length unwillingly along"  Rise from your sad abodes ye curst of old  For faith deserted or for cities sold  Own here one untry'd unexampled deed  One mystery of shame from Curio learn  To beg the infamy he did not earn  And 'scape in Guilt's disguise from Virtue's offer'd meed  IV  For saw we not that dang'rous pow'r avow'd  Whom Freedom oft' hath found her mortal bane  Whom Publick Wisdom ever strove t' exclude  And but with blushes suff'reth in her train  Corruption vaunted her bewitching spoils  O'er court o'er senate spread in pomp her toils  And call'd herself the states directing soul  Till Curio like a good magician try'd  With Eloquence and Reason at his side  By strength of holier spells th' enchantress to control  V  Soon with thy country's hope thy fame extends  The rescu'd merchant oft' thy words resounds  Thee and thy cause the rural hearth defends  His bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns  The learn'd recluse with awful zeal who read  Of Grecian heroes Roman patriots dead  Now with like awe doth living merit scan  While he whom virtue in his blest retreat  Bad social ease and publick passions meet  Ascends the civil scene and knows to be a man  VI  At length in view the glorious end appear'd  We saw thy spirit thro' the senate reign  And Freedom's friends thy instant omen heard  Of laws for which their fathers bled in vain  Wak'd in the strise the publick Genius rose  More keen more ardent from his long repose  Deep thro' her bounds the City felt his call  Each crowded haunt was stirr'd beneath his pow'r  And murm'ring challeng'd the deciding hour  Of that too vast event the hope and dread of all  VII  O ye good Pow'rs who look on humankind  Instruct the mighty moments as they rowl  And watch the fleeting shapes in Curio's mind  And steer his passions steady to the goal  O Alfred father of the English name  O valiant Edward first in civil fame  O William height of publick virtue pure  Bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye  Behold the sum of all your labours nigh  Your plans of law complete your ends of rule secure  VIII  'Twas thenO shame O soul from faith estrang'd  O Albion oft' to flatt'ring vows a prey  'Twas thenthy thought what sudden frenzy chang'd  What rushing palsy took thy strength away  Is this the man in freedom's cause approv'd  The man so great so honour'd so belov'd  Whom the dead envy'd and the living blest  This patient slave by tinsel bonds allur'd  This wretched suitor for a boon abjur'd  Whom those that fear'd him scorn that trusted him detest  IX  O lost alike to action and repose  With all that habit of familiar fame  Sold to the mock'ry of relentless foes  And doom'd t' exhaust the dregs of life in shame  To act with burning brow and throbbing heart  A poor deserter's dull exploded part  To slight the favour thou canst hope no more  Renounce the giddy crowd the vulgar wind  Charge thy own lightness on thy Country's mind  And from her voice appeal to each tame foreign shore  X  But England's sons to purchase thence applause  Shall ne'er the loyalty of slaves pretend  By courtly passions try the publick cause  Nor to the forms of rule betray the end  O Race erect by manliest passions mov'd  The labours which to Virtue stand approv'd  Prompt with a lover's fondness to survey  Yet where Injustice works her wilful claim  Fierce as the flight of Jove's destroying flame  Impatient to confront and dreadful to repay  XI  These thy heart owns no longer In their room  See the grave queen of pageants Honour dwell  Couch'd in thy bosom's deep tempestuous gloom  Like some grim idol in a sorc'rer's cell  Before her rites thy sick'ning reason flew  Divine Persuasion from thy tongue withdrew  While Laughter mock'd or Pity stole a sigh  Can Wit her tender movements rightly frame  Where the prime function of the foul is lame  Can Fancy's feeble springs the force of truth supply  XII  But come it is time strong destiny impends  To shut thee from the joys thou hast betray'd  With princes fill'd the solemn fane ascends  By Infamy the mindful demon sway'd  There vengeful vows for guardian laws essac'd  From nations fetter'd and from towns laid waste  For ever thro' the spacious courts resound  There long Posterity's united groan  And the sad charge of horrours not their own  Assail the giant chiefs and press them to the ground  XIII  In sight old Time imperious judge awaits  Above revenge or fear or pity just  He urgeth onward to those guilty gates  The Great the Sage the Happy and August  And still he asks them of the hidden plan  Whence ev'ry treaty ev'ry war began  Evolves their secrets and their guilt proclaims  And still his hands despoil them on the road  Of each vain wreath by lying bards bestow'd  And crush their trophies huge and raze their sculptur'd names  XIV  Ye mighty Shades arise give place attend  Here his eternal mansion Curio seeks  Low doth proud Wentworth to the stranger bend  And his dire welcome hardy Clifford speaks  "He comes whom Fate with surer arts prepar'd  "T' accomplish all which we but vainly dar'd  "Whom o'er the stubborn herd she taught to reign  "Who sooth'd with gaudy dreams their raging pow'r  "Even to its last irrevocable hour  "Then baffled their rude strength and broke them to the chain"  XV  But ye whom yet wise Liberty inspires  Whom for her champions o'er the world she claims  That household godhead whom of old your sires  Sought in the woods of Elbe and bore to Thames  Drive ye this hostile omen far away  Their own fell efforts on her foes repay  Your wealth your arts your fame be her's alone  Still gird your swords to combat on her side  Still frame your laws her gen'rous test t' abide  And win to her defence the altar and the throne  XVI  Protect her from yourselves ere yet the flood  Of golden luxury which commerce pours  Hath spread that selfish fierceness thro' your blood  Which not her lightest discipline endures  Snatch from fantastick demagogues her cause  Dream not of Numa's manners Plato's laws  A wiser founder and a nobler plan  O Sons of Alfred were for you assign'd  Bring to that birthright but an equal mind  And no sublimer lot will Fate reserve for man  ODE X TO THE MUSE  I  QUEEN of my songs harmonious Maid  Ah why hast thou withdrawn thy aid  Ah why forsaken thus my breast  With inauspicious damps opprest  Where is the dread prophetick heat  With which my bosom wont to beat  Where all the bright mysterious dreams  Of haunted groves and tuneful streams  That woo'd my genius to divinest themes  II  Say Goddess can the festal board  Or young Olympia's form ador'd  Say can the pomp of promis'd fame  Relume thy faint thy dying flame  Or have melodious airs the pow'r  To give one free poetick hour  Or from amid th' Elysian train  The soul of Milton shall I gain  To win thee back with some celestial strain  III  O pow'rful strain O sacred soul  His numbers ev'ry sense control  And now again my bosom burns  The Muse the Muse herself returns  Such on the banks of Tyne confest  I hail'd the fair immortal guest  When first she seal'd me for her own  Made all her blissful treasures known  And bad me swear to follow her alone  ODE XI ON LOVE TO A FRIEND  I  NO foolish YouthTo virtuous fame  If now thy early hopes be vow'd  If true ambition's nobler flame  Command thy footsteps from the crowd  Lean not to Love's enchanting snare  His songs his words his looks beware  Nor join his votaries the young and fair  II  By thought by dangers and by toils  The wreath of just renown is worn  Nor will Ambition's awful spoils  The flow'ry pomp of Ease adorn  But love unbends the force of thought  By love unmanly fears are taught  And love's reward with gaudy sloth is bought  III  Yet thou hast read in tuneful lays  And heard from many a zealous breast  The pleasing tale of Beauty's praise  In Wisdom's lofty language drest  Of Beauty pow'rful to impart  Each finer sense each comelier art  And sooth and polish man's ungentle heart  IV  If then from Love's deceit secure  Thus far alone thy wishes tend  Go see the whitewing'd ev'ning hour  On Delia's vernal walk descend  Go while the golden light serene  The grove the lawn the soften'd scene  Becomes the presence of the rural queen  V  Attend while that harmonious tongue  Each bosom each desire commands  Apollo's lute by Hermes strung  And touch'd by chaste Minerva's hands  Attend I feel a force divine  O Delia win my thoughts to thine  That half the colour of thy life is mine  VI  Yet conscious of the dang'rous charm  Soon would I turn my steps away  Nor oft' provoke the lovely harm  Nor lull my reason's watchful sway  But thou my FriendI hear thy sighs  Alas I read thy downcast eyes  And thy tongue salters and thy colour flies  VII  So soon again to meet the fair  So pensive all this absent hour  O yet unlucky Youth beware  While yet to think is in thy pow'r  In vain with friendship's flatt'ring name  Thy passion veils its inward shame  Friendship the treach'rous fuel of thy flame  VIII  Once I remember new to Love  And dreading his tyrannick chain  I sought a gentle maid to prove  What peaceful joys in friendship reign  Whence we forsooth might safely stand  And pitying view the lovesick band  And mock the winged boy's malicious hand  IX  Thus frequent past the cloudless day  To smiles and sweet discourse resign'd  While I exulted to survey  One gen'rous woman's real mind  Till friendship soon my languid breast  Each night with unknown cares possest  Dash'd my coy slumbers or my dreams distrest  X  Fool that I wasAnd now ev'n now  While thus I preach the Stoick strain  Unless I shun Olympia's view  An hour unsays it all again  O Friendwhen Love directs her eyes  To pierce where ev'ry passion lies  Where is the firm the cautious or the wise  ODE XII TO SIR FRANCIS HENRY DRAKE BARONET  I  BEHOLD the Balance in the sky  Swift on the wintry scale inclines  To earthy caves the Dryads fly  And the bare pastures Pan resigns  Late did the farmer's fork o'erspread  With recent soil the twicemown mead  Tainting the bloom which autumn knows  He whets the rusty coulter now  He binds his oxen to the plough  And wide his future harvest throws  II  Now London's busy confines round  By Kensington's imperial tow'rs  From Highgate's rough descent profound  Essexian heaths or Kentish bow'rs  Where'er I pass I see approach  Some rural statesman's eager coach  Hurry'd by senatorial cares  While rural nymphs alike within  Aspiring courtly praise to win  Debate their dress reform their airs  III  Say what can now the country boast  O Drake thy footsteps to detain  When peevish winds and gloomy frost  The sunshine of the temper stain  Say are the priests of Devon grown  Friends to this tolerating throne  Champions for George's legal right  Have gen'ral freedom equal law  Won to the glory of Nassau  Each bold Wessexian squire and knight  IV  I doubt it much and guess at least  That when the day which made us free  Shall next return that sacred feast  Thou better may'st observe with me  With me the sulph'rous treason old  A far inferiour part shall hold  In that glad day's triumphal strain  And gen'rous William be rever'd  Nor one untimely accent heard  Of James or his ignoble reign  V  Then while the Gascon's fragrant wine  With modest cups our joy supplies  We 'll truly thank the pow'r divine  Who bad the chief the patriot rise  Rise from heroick case the spoil  Due for his youth's Herculean toil  From Belgium to her saviour son  Rise with the same unconquer'd zeal  For our Britannia's injur'd weal  Her laws defac'd her shrines o'erthrown  VI  He came the tyrant from our shore  Like a forbidden demon fled  And to eternal exile bore  Pontifick rage and vassal dread  There sunk the mould'ring Gothick reign  New years came forth a lib'ral train  Call'd by the people's great decree  That day my Friend let blessings crown  Fill to the demigod's renown  From whom thou hast that thou art free  VII  Then Drake for wherefore should we part  The publick and the private weal  In vows to her who sways thy heart  Fair health glad fortune will we deal  Whether Aglaia's blooming cheek  Or the soft ornaments that speak  So eloquent in Daphne's smile  Whether the piercing lights that fly  From the dark heav'n of Myrto's eye  Haply thy fancy then beguile  VIII  For so it is thy stubborn breast  Tho' touch'd by many a slighter wound  Hath no full conquest yet confest  Nor the one fatal charmer found  While I a true and loyal swain  My fair Olympia's gentle reign  Thro' all the varying seasons own  Her genius still my bosom warms  No other maid for me hath charms  Or I have eyes for her alone  ODE XIII ON LYRICK POETRY  I  ONCE more I join the Thespian choir  And taste th' inspiring fount again  O parent of the Grecian lyre  Admit me to thy pow'rful strain  And lo with ease my step invades  The pathless vale and op'ning shades  Till now I spy her verdant seat  And now at large I drink the sound  While these her offspring list'ning round  By turns her melody repeat  I  I see Anacreon smile and sing  His silver tresses breathe perfume  His cheek displays a second spring  Of roses taught by wine to bloom  Away deceitful Cares away  And let me listen to his lay  Let me the wanton pomp enjoy  While in smooth dance the lightwing'd Hours  Lead round his lyre its patron pow'rs  Kind Laughter and convivial Joy  I  Broke from the fetters of his native land  Devoting shame and vengeance to her lords  With louder impulse and a threat'ning hand  The Lesbian patriot  Alcaeus  smites the sounding chords  Ye wretches ye perfidious train  Ye ours'd of gods and freeborn men  Ye murderers of the laws  Tho' now ye glory in your lust  Tho' now ye tread the feeble neck in dust  Yet Time and righteous Jove will judge your dreadful cause  II  But lo to Sappho's melting airs  Descends the radiant queen of Love  She smiles and asks what fonder cares  Her suppliant's plaintive measures move  Why is my faithful maid distrest  Who Sappho wounds thy tender breast  Say flies heSoon he shall pursue  Shuns he thy giftsHe soon shall give  Slights he thy sorrowsHe shall grieve  And soon to all thy wishes bow  II  But O Melpomene for whom  Awakes thy golden shell again  What mortal breath shall e'er presume  To echo that unbounded strain  Majestick in the frown of years  Behold the man of Thebes  Pindar  appears  For some there are whose mighty frame  The hand of Jove at birth endow'd  With hopes that mock the gazing crowd  As eagles drink the noontide flame  II  While the dim raven beats her weary wings  And clamours far belowPropitious Muse  While I so late unlock thy purer springs  And breathe whate'er thy ancient airs infuse  Wilt thou for Albion's sons around  Ne'er hadst thou audience more renown'd  Thy charming arts employ  As when the winds from shore to shore  Thro' Greece thy lyre's persuasive language bore  Till towns and isles and seas return'd the vocal joy  III  Yet then did Pleasure's lawless throng  Oft' rushing forth in loose attire  Thy virgin dance thy graceful song  Pollute with impious revels dire  O fair O chaste thy echoing shade  May no foul discord here invade  Nor let thy strings one accent move  Except what earth's untroubled ear  'Mid all her social tribes may hear  And Heav'n's unerring throne approve  III  Queen of the Lyre in thy retreat  The fairest flow'rs of Pindus glow  The vine aspires to crown thy seat  And myrtles round thy laurel grow  Thy strings adapt their vary'd strain  To ev'ry pleasure ev'ry pain  Which mortal tribes were born to prove  And straight our passions rise or fall  As at the wind's imperious call  The ocean swells the billows move  III  When Midnight listens o'er the slumb'ring earth  Let me O Muse thy solemn whispers hear  When Morning sends her fragrant breezes forth  With airy murmurs touch my op'ning ear  And ever watchful at thy side  Let Wisdom's awful suff'rage guide  The tenour of thy lay  To her of old by Jove was giv'n  To judge the various deeds of earth and heav'n  'Twas thine by gentle arts to win us to her sway  IV  Oft' as to wellearn'd ease resign'd  I quit the maze where Science toils  Do thou retresh my yielding mind  With all thy gay delusive spoils  But O indulgent come not nigh  The busy steps the jealous eye  Of wealthy Care or gainful Age  Whose barren souls thy joys disdain  And hold as foes to Reason's reign  Whome'er thy lovely works engage  IV  When  iendship and when letter'd Mirth  Haply partake my simple board  Then let thy blameless hand call forth  The musick of the Teian chord  Or if invok'd at softer hours  O  seek with me the happy bow'rs  That hear Olympia's gentle tongue  To Beauty link'd with Virtue's train  To Love devoid of jealous pain  There let the Sapphick lute be strung  IV  But when from envy and from death to claim  A hero bleeding for his native land  When to throw incense on the Vestal flame  Of Liberty my genius gives command  Nor Theban voice nor Lesbian lyre  From thee O Muse do I require  While my presaging mind  Conscious of pow'rs she never knew  Astonish'd grasps at things beyond her view  Nor by another's fate submits to be confin'd  ODE XIV TO THE HON CHARLES TOWNSHLND FROM THE COUNTRY  I  SAY Townshend what can London boast  pay thee for the pleasures lost  The health today resign'd  When Spring from this her fav'rite seat  Bad Winter hasten his retreat  And met the western wind  II  Oh knew'st thou how the balmy air  The sun the azure heav'ns prepare  To heal thy languid frame  No more would noisy courts engage  In vain would lying Faction's rage  Thy sacred leisure claim  III  Oft' I look'd forth and oft' admir'd  Till with the studious volume tir'd  I sought the open day  "And sure" I cry'd "the rural gods  "Expect me in their green abodes  "And chide my tardy lay"  IV  But ah in vain my restless feet  Trac'd ev'ry silent shady seat  Which knew their forms of old  Nor Naiad by her fountain laid  Nor Woodnymph tripping thro' her glade  Did now their rites unfold  V  Whether to nurse some infant oak  They turn the slowlytinkling brook  And catch the pearly show'rs  Or brush the mildew from the woods  Or paint with noontide beams the buds  Or breathe on op'ning flow'rs  VI  Such rites which they with spring renew  The eyes of Care can never view  And care hath long been mine  And hence offended with their guest  Since grief of love my soul opprest  They hide their toils divine  VII  But soon shall thy enliv'ning tongue  This heart by dear affliction wrung  With noble hope inspire  Then will the sylvan pow'rs again  Receive me in their genial train  And listen to my lyre  VIII  Beneath yon' Dryad's lonely shade  A rustick altar shall be paid  Of turf with laurel fram'd  And thou th' inscription wilt approve  "This for the peace which lost by love  "By friendship was reclaim'd"  ODE XV TO THE EVENING STAR  I  TONIGHT retir'd the queen of Heav'n  With young Endymion stays  And now to Hesper is it giv'n  A while to rule the vacant sky  Till she shall to her lamp supply  A stream of brighter rays  II  O Hesper while the starry throng  With awe thy path surrounds  Oh listen to my suppliant song  If haply now the vocal sphere  Can suffer thy delighted ear  To stoop to mortal sounds  III  So may the bridegroom's genial strain  Thee still invoke to shine  So may the bride's unmarry'd train  To Hymen chant their flatt'ring vow  Still that his lucky torch may glow  With lustre pure as thine  IV  Far other vows must I prefer  To thy indulgent pow'r  Alas but now I paid my tear  On fair Olympia's virgin tomb  And lo from thence in quest I roam  Of Philomela's bow'r  V  Propitious send thy golden ray  Thou purest light above  Let no false flame seduce to stray  Where gulf or steep lie hid for harm  But lead where musick's healing charm  May sooth afflicted love  VI  To them by many a grateful song  In happier season vow'd  These lawns Olympia's haunt belong  Oft' by yon' silver stream we walk'd  Or fix'd while Philomela talk'd  Beneath yon' copses stood  VII  Nor seldom where the beechen boughs  That roofless tow'r invade  We came while her enchanting Muse  The radiant moon above us held  Till by a clam'rous owl compell'd  She fled the solemn shade  VIII  But hark I hear her liquid tone  Now Hesper guide my feet  Down the red marl with moss o'ergrown  Thro' yon' wild thicket next the plain  Whose hawthorns choke the winding lane  Which leads to her retreat  IX  See the green space on either hand  Enlarg'd it spreads around  See in the midst she takes her stand  Where one old oak his awful shade  Extends o'er half the level mead  Enclos'd in woods profound  X  Hark how thro' many a melting note  She now prolongs her lays  How sweetly down the void they float  The breeze their magick path attends  The stars shine out the forest bends  The wakeful heifers gaze  XI  Whoe'er thou art whom Chance may bring  To this sequester'd spot  If then the plaintive Siren sing  Oh softly tread beneath her bow'r  And think of Heav'n's disposing pow'r  Of man's uncertain lot  XII  Oh think o'er all this mortal stage  What mournful scenes arise  What ruin waits on kingly rage  How often Virtue dwells with Wo  How many griefs from knowledge flow  How swiftly pleasure flies  XIII  O sacred Bird let me at eve  Thus wand'ring all alone  Thy tender counsel oft' receive  Bear witness to thy pensive airs  And pity Nature's common cares  Till I forget my own  ODE XVI TO CALEB HARDINGE M D  I  WITH sordid floods the wintry urn  Aquarius  Hath stain'd fair Richmond's level green  Her naked hill the Dryads mourn  No longer a poetick scene  No longer there thy raptur'd eye  The beauteous forms of earth or sky  Surveys as in their Author's mind  And London shelters from the year  Those whom thy social hours to share  The Attick Muse design'd  II  From Hampstead's airy summit me  Her guest the City shall behold  What day the people's stern decree  To unbelieving kings is told  When common men the dread of Fame  Adjudg'd as one of evil name  Before the sun th' anointed head  Then seek thou too the pious Town  With no unworthy cares to crown  That ev'ning's awful shade  III  Deem not I call thee to deplore  The sacred martyr of the day  By fast and penitential lore  To purge our ancient guilt away  For this on humble faith I rest  That still our advocate the priest  From heav'nly wrath will save the land  Nor ask what rites our pardon gain  Nor how his potent sounds restrain  The Thund'rer's lifted hand  IV  No Hardinge peace to church and state  That ev'ning let the Muse give law  While I anew the theme relate  Which my first youth enamour'd saw  Then will I oft' explore thy thought  What to reject which Locke hath taught  What to pursue in Virgil's lay  Till hope ascends to lostiest things  Nor envies demagogues or kings  Their frail and vulgar sway  V  O vers'd in all the human frame  Lead thou where'er my labour lies  And English Fancy's eager flame  To Grecian purity chastize  While hand in hand at Wisdom's shrine  Beauty with Truth I strive to join  And grave Assent with glad Applause  To paint the story of the soul  And Plato's visions to control  By Verulamian  Verulam gave one of his titles to Francis Bacon author of the Novum Organum  laws  ODE XVII ON A SERMON AGAINST GLORY MDCCXLVII  I  COME then tell me Sage Divine  Is it an offence to own  That our bosoms e'er incline  Toward immortal glory's throne  For with me nor Pomp nor Pleasure  Bourbon's might Braganza's treasure  So can Fancy's dream rejoice  So conciliate Reason's choice  As one approving word of her impartial voice  II  If to spurn at noble praise  Be the passport to thy heav'n  Follow thou these gloomy ways  No such law to me was giv'n  Nor I trust shall I deplore me  Faring like my friends before me  Nor an holier place desire  Than Timoleon's arms acquire  And Tully's curule chair and Milton's golden lyre  ODE XVIII TO THE RIGHT HON FRANCIS EARL OF HUNTINGDON MDCCXLVII  I  THE wise and great of ev'ry clime  Thro' all the spacious walks of Time  Where'er the Muse her pow'r display'd  With joy have listen'd and obey'd  For taught of Heav'n the sacred Nine  Persuasive numbers forms divine  To mortal sense impart  They best the soul with glory fire  They noblest counsels boldest deeds inspire  And high o'er Fortune's rage inthrone the fixed heart  I  Nor less prevailing is their charm  The vengeful bosom to disarm  To melt the proud with human wo  And prompt unwilling tears to flow  Can wealth a pow'r like this afford  Can Cromwell's arts or Marlb'rough's sword  An equal empire claim  No Hastings thou my words wilt own  Thy breast the gifts of ev'ry Muse hath known  Nor shall the giver's love disgrace thy noble name  I  The Muse's awful art  And the blest function of the poet's tongue  Ne'er shalt thou blush to honour to assert  From all that scorned Vice or slavish Fear hath sung  Nor shall the blandishment of Tuscan strings  Warbling at will in Pleasure's myrtle bow'r  Nor shall the servile notes to Celtick kings  By flatt'ring minstrels paid in evil hour  Move thee to spurn the heav'nly Muse's reign  A diff'rent strain  And other themes  From her prophetick shades and hallow'd streams  Thou well canst witness meet the purg'd ear  Such as when Greece to her immortal shell  Rejoicing listen'd godlike sounds to hear  To hear the sweet instructress tell  While men and heroes throug'd around  How life its noblest use may find  How well for freedom be resign'd  And how by Glory Virtue shall be crown'd  II  Such was the Chian father's strain  To many a kind domestick train  Whose pious hearth and genial bowl  Had cheer'd the rev'rend pilgrim's soul  When ev'ry hospitable rite  With equal bounty to requite  He struck his magick strings  And pour'd spontaneous numbers forth  And seiz'd their ears with tales of ancient worth  And fill'd their musing hearts with vast heroick things  II  Stanza  II Lycurgus the Lacedaemonian lawgiver brought into Greece from Asia Minor the first complete copy of Homer's WorksAt Plataea was fought the decifive battle between the Persian army and the united militia of Greece under Pausanias and AristidesCimon the Athenian erected a trophy in Cyprus for two great victories gained on the same day over the Persians by sea and land Diodorus Siculus has preserved the inscription which the Athenians affixed to the consecrated spoils after this great success in which it is very remarkable that the greatness of the occasion has raised the manner of expression above the usual simplicity and modesty of all other ancient inscriptions It is this  The following translation is almost literal  Since first the sea from Asia's hostile coast  Divided Europe and the god of War  Assail'd imperious cities never yet  At once among the waves and on the shore  Hath such a labour been achiev'd by men  Who earth inhabit They whose arms the M  es  In Cyprus felt pernicious they the same  Have won from skilful Tyre an hundred ships  Crowded with warriours Asia groans in both  Her hands  smitten by the might of war  Now oft' where happy spirits dwell  Where yet he tunes his charming shell  Oft' near him with applauding hands  The Genius of his country stands  To list'ning gods he makes him known  That man divine by whom were sown  The seeds of Grecian fame  Who first the race with freedom fir'd  From whom Lycurgus Sparta's sons inspir'd  From whom Placaean palms and Cyprian trophies came  II  Stanza  II Pindar was contemporary with Aristides and Cimon in whom the glory of ancient Greece was at its height When Xerxes invaded Greece Pindar was true to the common interest of his country though his fellowcitizens the Thebans had sold themselves to the Persian king In one of his odes he expresses the great distress and anxiety of his mind occasioned by the vast preparations of Xerxes against Greece    Isthm  viii  in another he celebrates the victories of Salamis Plataea and Himera    Pyth  i  It will be necessary to add two or three other particulars of his life real or fabulous in order to explain what follows in the text concerning him First then he was thought to be so great a favourite of Apollo that the priests of that deity allotted him a constant share of their offerings It was said of him as of some other illustrious men that at his birth a swarm of bees lighted on his lips and fed him with their honey it was also a tradition concerning him that Pan was heard to recite his poetry and seen dancing to one of his hymns on the mountains near Thebes But a real historical fact in his life is that the Thebans imposed a large fine upon him on account of the veneration which he expressed in his poems for that heroick spirit shewn by the people of Athens in defence of the common liberty which his own fellowcitizens had shamefully betrayed and as the argument of this ode implies that great poetical talents and high sentiments of liberty do reciprocaily produce and assist each other so Pindar is perhaps the most exemplary proof of this connexion which occurs in history The Thebans were remarkable in general for a slavish disposition through all the fortunes of their commonwealth at the time of its ruin by Philip and even in its best state under the administration of Pelopidas and Epaminondas and every one knows they were no less remarkable for great dulness and want of all genius That Pindar should have equally distinguished himself from the rest of his fellowcitizens in both these respects seems somewhat extraordinary and is scarce to be accounted for but by the preceding observation  O noblest happiest age  When Aristides rul'd and Cimon sought  When all the gen'rous fruits of Homer's page  Exulting Pindar saw to full perfection brought  O Pindar ost' shalt thou be hail'd of me  Not that Apollo fed thee from his shrine  Not that thy lips drank sweetness from the bee  Nor yet that studious of thy notes divine  Pan danc'd their measure with the sylvan throng  But that thy song  Was proud t' unfold  What thy base rulers trembled to behold  Amid corrupted Thebes was proud to tell  The deeds of Athens and the Persian shame  Hence on thy head their impious vengeance fell  But thou O faithful to thy fame  The Muse's law didst rightly know  That who would animate his lays  And other minds to virtue raise  Must feel his own with all her spirit glow  III  Are there approv'd of later times  Whose verse adorn'd a tyrant's  Octavianus Caesar  crimes  Who saw majestick Rome betray'd  And lent th' imperial ruffian aid  Alas not one polluted bard  No not the strains that Mincius heard  Or Tibur's hills reply'd  Dare to the Muse's ear aspire  Save that instructed by the Grecian lyre  With freedom's ancient notes their shameful task they hide  III  Mark how the dread Pantheon stands  Amid the domes of modern hands  Amid the toys of idle state  How simply how severely great  Then turn and while each western clime  Presents her tuneful sons to Time  So mark thou Milton's name  And add "Thus dissers from the throng  "The spirit which inform'd thy awsul song  "Which bad thy potent voice protect thy country's same"  III  Stanza  III Alluding to his Defence of the People of England against Salmasius See particularly the manner in which he himself speaks of that undertaking in the Introduction to his Reply to  us  Yet hence barbarick Zeal  His mem'ry with unholy rage pursues  While from these arduous cares of publick weal  She bids each bard begone and rest him with his Muse  O Fool to think the man whose ample mind  Must grasp at all that yonder stars survey  Must join the noblest forms of ev'ry kind  The world's most perfect image to display  Can  'er his country's majesty behold  Unmov'd or cold  O fool to deem  That he whose thought must visit ev'ry theme  Whose heart must ev'ry strong emotion know  Inspir'd by Nature or by Fortune taught  That he if haply some presumptuous foe  With false ignoble science fraught  Shall spurn at Freedom's faithful band  That he their dear desence will shun  Or hide their glories from the sun  Or deal their vengeance with a woman's hand  IV  I care not that in Arno's plain  Or on the sportive banks of Seine  From publick themes the Muses' quire  Content with polish'd Ease retire  Where priests studious head command  Where tyrants bow the warlike hand  To vile Ambition's aim  Say what can publick themes assord  Save venal honours to an hateful lord  Reserv'd for angry Heav'n and scorn'd of honest Fame  IV  But here where Freedom's equal throne  To all her valiant sons is known  Where all are conscious of her carcs  And each the pow'r that rules him shares  Here let the bard whose dastard tongue  Leaves publick arguments unsung  Bid publick praise farewell  Let him to fitter climes remove  Far from the hero's and the patriot's love  And lull mysterious monks to slumber in their cell  IV  Stanza  IV Edward III from whom descended Henry Hastings third Earl of Huntingdon by the daughter of the Duke of Clarence brother to Edward IV  O Hastings not to all  Can ruling Heav'n the same endowments lend  Yet still doth Nature to her offspring call  That to one gen'ral weal their diff'rent pow'rs they bend  Unenvious Thus alone tho' strains divine  Inform the bosom of the Muse's son  Tho' with new honours the Patrician's line  Advance from age to age yet thus alone  They win the suffrage of impartial Fame  The poet's name  He best shall prove  Whose lays the soul with noblest passions move  But thee O Progeny of heroes old  Thee to severer toils thy fate requires  The fate which form'd thee in a chosen mould  The grateful country of thy sires  Thee to sublimer paths demand  Sublimer than thy sires could trace  Or thy own Edward teach his race  Tho' Gaul's proud Genius sank beneath his hand  V  From rich domains and subject farms  They led the rustick youth to arms  And kings their stern achievements fear'd  While private strife their banners rear'd  But loftier scenes to thee are shown  Where empire's wide establish'd throne  No private master fills  Where long foretold the people reigns  Where each a vassal's humble heart disdains  And judgeth what he sees and as he judgeth wills  V  Here be it thine to calm and guide  The swelling Democratick tide  To watch the state's uncertain frame  And baffle Faction's partial aim  But chiefly with determin'd zeal  To quell that servile band who kneel  To Freedom's banish'd soes  That monster which is daily found  Expert and bold thy country's peace to wound  Yet dreads to handle arms nor manly counsel knows  V  Stanza  V At Whittington a village on the edge of Scarsdale in Derbyshire the Earls of Devonshire and Danby with the Lord Delamere privately concerted the plan of the Revolution The house in which they met is at present a farmhouse and the country people distinguish the room where they sat by the name of The Plotting Parlour  'Tis highest Heav'ns command  That guilty aims should sordid paths pursue  That what ensnares the heart should maim the hand  And Virtue's worthless foes be false to glory too  But look on Freedom see thro' ev'ry age  What labours perils griefs hath she disdain'd  What arms what regal pride what priestly rage  Have her dread offspring conquer'd or sustain'd  For Albion well have conquer'd Let the strains  Of happy swains  Which now resound  Where Scarsdale's cliffs the swelling pastures bound  Bear witness there oft' let the farmer hail  The sacred orchard which imbow'rs his gate  And shew to strangers passing down the vale  Where Cav'ndish Booth and Osborne sat  When bursting from their country's chain  Ev'n in the midst of deadly harms  Of papal snares and lawless arms  They plann'd for Freedom this her noblest reign  VI  This reign these laws this publick care  Which Nassau gave us all to share  Had ne'er adorn'd the English name  Could Fear have silenc'd Freedom's claim  But Fear in vain attempts to bind  Those lofty efforts of the mind  Which social good inspires  Where men for this assault a throne  Each adds the common welfare to his own  And each unconquer'd heart the strength of all acquires  VI  Say was it thus when late we view'd  Our fields in civil blood imbru'd  When Fortune crown'd the barb'rous host  And half th' astonish'd isle was lost  Did one of all that vaunting train  Who dare affront a peaceful reign  Durst one in arms appear  Durst one in counsels pledge his life  Stake his luxurious fortunes in the strife  Or lend his boasted name his vagrant friends to cheer  VI  Yet Hastings these are they  Who challenge to themselves thy country's love  The true the constant who alone can weigh  What glory should demand or liberty approve  But let their works declare them Thy free pow'rs  The gen'rous pow'r of thy prevailing mind  Not for the tasks of their confed'rate hours  Lewd brawls and lurking slander were design'd  Be thou thy own approver Honest praise  Oft' nobly sways  Ingenuous youth  But sought from cowards and the lying mouth  Praise is reproach Eternal God alone  For mortals fixeth that sublime award  He from the faithful records of his throne  Bids the historian and the bard  Dispose of honour and of scorn  Discern the patriot from the slave  And write the good the wise the brave  For lessons to the multitude unborn  END OF BOOK FIRST  ODES ON

art refuse  Or tho' the frankness of my hardy style  Mock the nice touches of the critick's file  Yet what my age and climate held to view  Impartial I survey'd and fearless drew  And say ye skilful in the human heart  Who know to prize a poet's noblest part  What age what clime could e'er an ampler field  For lofty thought for daring fancy yield  I saw this England break the shameful bands  Forg'd for the souls of men by sacred hands  I saw each groaning realm her aid implore  Her sons the heroes of each warlike shore  Her naval standard the dire Spaniard's bane  Obey'd thro' all the circuit of the main  Then too great Commerce for a latefound world  Around your coast her eager sails unfurl'd  New hopes new passions thence the bosom  ir'd  New plans new arts the genius thence inspir'd  Thence ev'ry scence which private fortune knows  In stronger life with bolder spirit rose  Disgrac'd I this full prospect which I drew  My colours languid or my strokes untrue  Have not your sages warriours swains and kings  Confess'd the living draught of men and things  What other bard in any clime appears  Alike the master of your smiles and tears  Yet have I deign'd your audience to entice  With wretched bribes to luxury and vice  Or have my various scenes a purpose known  Which Freedom Virtue Glory might not own  Such from the first was my dramatick plan  It should be yours to crown what I began  And now that England spurns her Gothick chain  And equal laws and social science reign  I thought now surely shall my zealous eyes  View nobler bards and juster criticks rise  Intent with learned labour to refine  The copious ore of Albion's native mine  Our stately Muse more graceful airs to teach  And form her tongue to more attractive speech  Till rival nations listen at her feet  And own her polish'd as they own'd her great  But do you thus my fav'rite hopes fulfil  Is France at last the standard of your skill  Alas for you that so betray a mind  Of art unconscious and to beauty blind  Say does her language your ambition raise  Her barren trivial unharmonious phrase  Which fetters eloquence to scantiest bounds  And maims the cadence of poetick sounds  Say does your humble admiration chuse  The gentle prattle of her Comick Muse  While wits plaindealers fops and fools appear  Charg'd to say nought but what the king may hear  Or rather melt your sympathizing hearts  Won by her Tragick scenes' romantick arts  Where old and young declaim on soft desire  And heroes never but for love expire  No tho' the charms of novelty a while  Perhaps too fondly win your thoughtless smile  Yet not for you design'd indulgent Fate  The modes or manners of the Bourbon state  And ill your minds my partial judgment reads  And many an augury my hope misleads  If the fair maids of yonder blooming train  To their light courtship would an audience deign  Or those chaste matrons a Parisian wife  Chuse for the model of domestick life  Or if one youth of all that gen'rous band  The strength and splendour of their native land  Would yield his portion of his country's same  And quit old Freedom's patrimonial claim  With lying smiles Oppression's pomp to see  And judge of glory by a king's decree  O blest at home with justly envy'd laws  O long the chiefs of Europe's gen'ral cause  Whom Heav'n hath chosen at each dang'rous hour  To check the inroads of barbarick Pow'r  The rights of trampled nations to reclaim  And guard the social world from bonds and shame  Oh let not Luxury's fantastick charms  Thus give the lie to your heroick arms  Nor for the ornaments of life embrace  Dishonest lessons from that vaunting race  Whom Fate's dread laws for in eternal Fate  Despotick Rule was heir to Freedom's hate  Whom in each warlike each commercial part  In civil counsel and in pleasing art  The Judge of earth predestin'd for your foes  And made it same and virtue to oppose  ODE II TO SLEEP  I  THOU silent Pow'r whose welcome sway  Charms ev'ry anxious thought away  In whose divine oblivion drown'd  Sore pain and weary toil grow mild  Love is with kinder looks beguil'd  And Grief forgets her fondlycherish'd wound  Oh whither hast thou flown indulgent God  God of kind shadows and of healing dews  Whom dost thou touch with thy Lethaean rod  Around whose temples now thy opiate airs diffuse  II  Lo Midnight from her starry reign  Looks awful down on earth and main  The tuneful birds lie hush'd in sleep  With all that crop the verdant food  With all that skim the crystal flood  Or haunt the caverns of the rocky steep  No rushing winds disturb the tufted bow'rs  No wakeful sound the moonlight valley knows  Save where the brook its liquid murmur pours  And lulls the waving scene to more profound repose  III  Oh let not me alone complain  Alone invoke thy pow'r in vain  Descend propitious on my eyes  Not from the couch that bears a crown  Not from the courtly statesman's down  Nor where the miser and his treasure lies  Bring not the shapes that break the murd'rer's rest  Nor those the hireling soldier loves to see  Nor those which haunt the bigot's gloomy breast  Far be their guilty nights and far their dreams from me  IV  Nor yet those awful forms present  For chiefs and heroes only meant  The figur'd brass the choral song  The rescu'd people's glad applause  The list'ning senate and the laws  Fix'd by the counsels of Timoleon's  After Timoleon had delivered Syracuse from the tyranny of Dionysius the people on every important deliberation sent for him into the publick assembly asked his advice and voted according to it  P    tongue  Are scenes too grand for Fortune's private ways  And tho' they shine in youth's ingenuous view  The sober gainful arts of modern days  To such romantick thoughts have bid a long adieu  V  I ask not god of Dreams thy care  To banish Love's presentments fair  Nor rosy cheek nor radiant eye  Can arm him with such strong command  That the young sorc'rer's fatal hand  Should round my soul his pleasing fetters tie  Nor yet the courtier's hope the giving smile  A lighter phantom and a baser chain  Did e'er in slumber my proud lyre beguile  To lend the pomp of thrones her illaccording strain  VI  But Morpheus on thy balmy wing  Such honourable visions bring  As sooth'd great Milton's injur'd age  When in prophetick dreams he saw  The race unborn with pious awe  Imbibe each virtue from his heav'nly page  Or such as Mead's benignant fancy knows  When health's deep treasures by his art explor'd  Have sav'd the infant from an orphan's woes  Or to the trembling sire his age's hope restor'd  ODE III TO THE CUCKOO  I  O Rustick herald of the spring  At length in yonder woody vale  Fast by the brook I hear thee sing  And studious of thy homely tale  Amid the vespers of the grove  Amid the chanting choir of love  Thy sage responses hail  II  The time has been when I have frown'd  To hear thy voice the woods invade  And while thy solemn accent drown'd  Some sweeter poet of the shade  Thus thought I thus the sons of Care  Some constant youth or gen'rous fair  With dull advice upbraid  III  I said "While Philomela's song  "Proclaims the passion of the grove  "It ill beseems a Cuckoo's tongue  "Her charming language to reprove"  Alas how much a lover's ear  Hates all the sober truth to hear  The sober truth of love  IV  When hearts are in each other blest  When nought but lofty faith can rule  The nymph's and swain's consenting breast  How Cuckoolike in Cupid's school  With store of grave prudential saws  On Fortune's pow'r and Custom's laws  Appears each friendly fool  V  Yet think betimes ye gentle Train  Whom love and hope and fancy sway  Who ev'ry harsher care disdain  Who by the morning judge the day  Think that in April's fairest hours  To warbling shades and painted flow'rs  The Cuckoo joins his lay  ODE IV TO THE HON CHARLES TOWNSHEND In the Country  I  How oft' shall I survey  This humble roof the lawn the greenwood shade  The vale with sheaves o'erspread  The glassy brook the flocks which round thee stray  When will thy cheerful mind  Of these have utter'd all her dear esteem  Or tell me dost thou deem  No more to join in glory's toilsome race  But here content embrace  That happy leisure which thou hadst resign'd  I  Alas ye happy hours  When books and youthful sport the soul could share  Ere one ambitious care  Of civil life had aw'd her simpler pow'rs  Oft' as your winged train  Revisit here my friend in white array  Oh fail not to display  Each fairer scene where I perchance had part  That so his gen'rous heart  Th' abode of even Friendship may remain  I  For not imprudent of my loss to come  I saw from Contemplation's quiet cell  His feet ascending to another home  Where publick Praise and envy'd Greatness dwell  But shall we therefore O my Lyre  Reprove Ambition's best desire  Extinguish Glory's flame  Far other was the task enjoin'd  When to my hand thy strings were first assign'd  Far other faith belongs to Friendship's honour'd name  II  Thee Townshend not the arms  Of slumb'ring Ease nor Pleasure's rosy chain  Were destin'd to detain  No nor bright Science nor the Muse's charms  For them high Heav'n prepares  Their proper votaries an humbler band  And ne'er world Spenser's hand  Have deign'd to strike the warbling Tuscan shell  Nor Harrington to tell  What habit an immortal city wears  II  Had this been born to shield  The cause which Cromwell's impious hand betray'd  Or that like Vere diiplay'd  His Redcross banner o'er the Belgian field  Yet where the will divine  Hsth shut those loftiest paths it next remains  With reason clad in strains  Of harmony selected minds t' inspire  And Virtue's living fire  To feed and eternize in hearts like thine  II  For never shall the herd whom Envy sways  So quell my purpose or my tongue control  That I should fear illustrious worth to praise  Because its master's friendship mov'd my soul  Yet if this undissembling strain  Should now perhaps thine ear detain  With any pleasing sound  Remember thou that righteous Fame  From hoary Age a strict account will claim  Of each auspicious palm with which thy youth was crown'd  III  Nor obvious is the way  Where Heav'n expects thee nor the traveller leads  Thro' flow'rs or fragrant meads  Or groves that hark to Philomela's lay  The impartial laws of Fate  To nobler virtues wed severer cares  Is there a man who shares  The summit next where heav'nly natures dwell  Ask him for he can tell  What storms beat round that rough laborious height  III  Ye Heroes who of old  Did gen'rous England Freedom's throne ordain  From Alfred's parent reign  To Nassau great deliv'rer wise and bold  I know your perils hard  Your wounds your painful marches wintry seas  The night estrang'd from ease  The day by cowardice and falsehood vex'd  The head with doubt perplex'd  Th' indignant heart disdaining the reward  III  Which Envy hardly grants But O renown  O praise from judging Heav'n and virtuous men  If thus they purchas'd thy divinest crown  Say who shall hesitate or who complain  And now they sit on thrones above  And when among the gods they move  Before the Sovran Mind  "Lo these" he saith "Lo these are they  "Who to the laws of mine eternal sway  "From violence and fear asserted humankind"  IV  Thus honour'd while the train  Of legislators in his presence dwell  If I may aught foretel  The statesman shall the second palm obtain  For dreadful deeds of arms  Let vulgar bards with undiscerning praise  More glitt'ring trophies raise  But wisest Heav'n what deeds may chiefly move  To favour and to love  What save wide blessings or averted harms  IV  Nor to th' embattled field  Shall these achievments of the peaceful gown  The green immortal crown  Of valour or the songs of conquest yield  Not Fairfax wildly bold  While bare of crest he hew'd his fatal way  Thro' Naseby's firm array  To heavier dangers did his breast oppose  Than Pym's free virtue chose  When the proud force of Strafford he controll'd  IV  But what is man at enmity with truth  What were the fruits of Wentworth's copious mind  When blighted all the promise of his youth  The patriot in a tyrant's league had join'd  Let Ireland's loud lamenting plains  Let Tyne's and Humber's trampled swains  Let menac'd London tell  How impious Guile made Wisdom base  How gen'rous Zeal to cruel Rage gave place  And how unbless'd he liv'd and how dishonour'd fell  V  Thence never hath the Muse  Around his tomb Pierian roses flung  Nor shall one poet's tongue  His name for musick's pleasing labour chuse  And sure when Nature kind  Hath deck'd some favour'd breast above the throng  That man with grievous wrong  Affronts and wounds his genius if he bends  To Guilt's ignoble ends  The functions of his illsubmitting mind  V  For worthy of the wise  Nothing can seem but virtue nor earth yield  Their fame an equal field  Save where impartial Freedom gives the prize  There Somers fix'd his name  Enroll'd the next to William there shall Time  To ev'ry wond'ring clime  Point out that Somers who from Faction's crowd  The sland'rous and the loud  Could fair assent and modest rev'rence claim  V  Nor aught did laws or social arts acquire  Nor this majestick weal of Albion's land  Did aught accomplish or to aught aspire  Without his guidance his superiour hand  And rightly shall the Muse's care  Wreaths like her own for him prepare  Whose mind's enamour'd aim  Could forms of civil beauty draw  Sublime as ever sage or poet saw  Yet still to life's rude scene the proud ideas tame  VI  Let none profane be near  The Muse was never foreign to his breast  On Pow'r's grave seat confest  Still to her voice he bent a lover's ear  And if the blessed know  Their ancient cares ev'n now th' unfading groves  Where haply Milton roves  With Spenser hear th' enchanted echoes round  Thro' farthest heav'n resound  Wise Somers guardian of their fame below  VI  He knew the patriot knew  That letters and the Muses' pow'rful art  Exalt th' ingenuous heart  And brighten ev'ry form of just and true  They lend a nobler sway  To civil Wisdom than Corruption's lure  Could ever yet procure  They too from Envy's pale malignant light  Conduct her forth to sight  Cloth'd in the fairest colours of the day  VI  O Townshend thus may Time the judge severe  Instruct my happy tongue of thee to tell  And when I speak of one to freedom dear  For planning wisely and for acting well  Of one whom glory loves to own  Who still by lib'ral means alone  Hath lib'ral ends pursu'd  Then for the guerdon of my lay  "This man with faithful friendship" will I say  "From youth to honour'd age my arts and me hath view'd"  ODE V ON LOVE OF PRAISE  I  OF all the springs within the mind  Which prompt her steps in Fortune's maze  From none more pleasing aid we find  Than from the genuine love of praise  II  Nor any partial private end  Such rev'rence to the publick bears  Nor any passion Virtue's friend  So like to Virtue's self appears  III  For who in glory can delight  Without delight in glorious deeds  What man a charming voice can slight  Who courts the echo that succeeds  IV  But not the echo on the voice  More than on virtue praise depends  To which of course its real price  The judgment of the praiser lends  V  If praise then with religious awe  From the sole perfect Judge be sought  A nobler aim a purer law  Nor priest nor bard nor sage hath taught  VI  With which in character the same  Tho' in an humbler sphere it lies  I count that soul of human fame  The suffrage of the good and wise  ODE VI TO W HALL ESQ WITH THE WORKS OF CHAULIEU  I  ATTEND to Chaulieu's wanton lyre  While fluent as the skylark sings  When first the morn allures its wings  The epicure his theme pursues  And tell me if among the choir  Whose musick charms the banks of Seine  So full so free so rich a strain  E'er dictated the warbling Muse  II  Yet Hall while thy judicious ear  Admires the welldissembled art  That can such harmony impart  To the lame pace of Gallick rhymes  While wit from affectation clear  Bright images and passions true  Recall to thy assenting view  The envy'd bards of nobler times  III  Say is not oft' his doctrine wrong  This priest of Pleasure who aspires  To lead us to her sacred fires  Knows he the ritual of her shrine  Say her sweet influence to thy song  So may the goddess still afford  Doth she consent to be ador'd  With shameless love and frantick wine  IV  Nor Cato nor Chrysippus here  Need we in high indignant phrase  From their Elysian quiet raise  But Pleasure's oracle alone  Consult attentive not severe  O Pleasure we blaspheme not thee  Nor emulate the rigid knee  Which bends but at the Stoick throne  V  We own had Fate to man assign'd  Nor sense nor wish but what obey  Or Venus soft or Bacchus gay  Then might our bard's voluptuous creed  Most aptly govern humankind  Unless perchance what he hath sung  Of tortur'd joints and nerves unstrung  Some wrangling heretick should plead  VI  But now with all these proud desires  For dauntless truth and honest fame  With that strong master of our frame  Th' inexorable judge within  What can be done Alas ye fires  Of love alas ye rosy smiles  Ye nectar'd cups from happier soils  Ye have no bribe his grace to win  ODE VII TO THOMAS EDWARDS ESQ On the late Edition of Mr Pope's Works  I  BELIEVE me Edwards to restrain  The licence of a railer's tongue  Is what but seldom men obtain  By sense or wit by prose or song  A task for more Herculean pow'rs  Nor suited to the sacred hours  Of leisure in the Muses' bow'rs  II  In bow'rs where laurel weds with palm  The Muse the blameless queen resides  Fair Fame attends and Wisdom calm  Her eloquence harmonious guides  While shut for ever from her gate  Oft' trying still repining wait  Fierce Envy and calumnious Hate  III  Who then from her delightful bounds  Would step one moment forth to heed  What impotent and savage sounds  From their unhappy mouths proceed  No rather Spenser's lyre again  Prepare and let thy pious strain  For Pope's dishonour'd shade complain  IV  Tell how displeas'd was ev'ry bard  When lately in th' Elysian grove  They of his Muse's guardian heard  His delegate to fame above  And what with one accord they said  Of Wit in drooping age misled  And Warburton's officious aid  V  Stanza  V During Mr Pope's war with Theobald Concanen and the rest of their tribe Mr Warburton the present Lord Bishop of Gloucester did with great zeal cultivate their friendship having been introduced forsooth at the meetings of that respectable confederacy a favour which he afterwards spoke of in very high terms of complacency and thankfulness at the same time in his intercourse with them he treated Mr Pope in a most contemptuous manner and as a writer without genius Of the truth of these assertions his Lordship can have no doubt if he recollects his own correspondence with Concanen a part of which is still in being and will probably be remembered as long as any of this prelate's writings  How Virgil mourn'd the sordid fate  To that melodious lyre assign'd  Beneath a tutor who so late  With Midas and his rout combin'd  By spiteful Clamour to confound  That very lyre's enchanting sound  Tho' list'ning realms admir'd around  VI  How Horace own'd he thought the fire  Of his friend Pope's satirick line  Did farther fuel scarce require  From such a militant divine  How Milton scorn'd the sophist vain  Who durst approach his hallow'd strain  With unwash'd hands and lips profane  VII  Then Shakespeare debonnair and mild  Brought that strange Comment forth to view  "Conceits more deep" he said and smil'd  "Than his own fools or madmen knew"  But thank'd a gen'rous friend above  Who did with free advent'rous love  Such pageants from his tomb remove  VIII  And if to Pope in equal need  The same kind office thou wouldst pay  Then Edwards all the band decreed  That future bards with frequent lay  Should call on thy auspicious name  From each absurd intruder's claim  To keep inviolate their fame  ODE VIII TO THE AUTHOR OF MEMOIRS OF THE HOUSE OF BRANDENBURGH  In the year appeared a very splendid edition in to of  Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire de la Maison de Brandebourg a Berlin et la Haye  with a privilege signed  Frederick  the same being engraved in imitation of handwriting In this edition among other extraordinary passages are the two following to which the third stanza of this ode more particularly refers  Page    "Il se fit une migration the author is speaking of what happened of the revocation of the Edict of Nantz dont on n'avoit guere vu d'exemples dans l'histoire un peuple entier sortit du royaume par l'esprit de parti en haine du pape et pour recevoir sous un autre ciel la communion sous les deux especes quatre cens mille ames s'expatrierent ainsi et abandonnerent tous leur biens pour detonne  dans d'autres temples les vieuxpseaumesde Clement Marot"  Page    "La crainte donna le jour a la credulite et l'amour propre interessa bientot le ciel au destin des hommes"    I  THE men renow'd as chiefs of human race  And born to lead in counsels or in arms  Have seldom turn'd their feet from Glory's chase  To dwell with books or court the Muse's charms  Yet to our eyes if haply time hath brought  Some genuine transcript of their calmer thought  There still we own the wise the great or good  And Caesar there and Xenophon are seen  As clear in spirit and sublime of mien  As on Pharsalian plains or by th'Assyrian slood  II  Say thou too Fred'rick was not this thy aim  Thy vigils could the student's lamp engage  Except for this except that future fame  Might read thy genius in the faithful page  That if hereafter Envy shall presume  With words irrev'rent to inscribe thy tomb  And baser weeds upon thy palms to fling  That hence posterity may try thy reign  Assert thy treaties and thy wars explain  And view in native lights the hero and the king  III  O evil foresight and pernicious care  Wilt thou indeed abide by this appeal  Shall we the lessons of thy pen compare  With private honour or with publick zeal  Whence then at things divine those darts of scorn  Why are the woes which virtuous men have borne  For sacred Truth a prey to Laughter giv'n  What fiend what foe of Nature urg'd thy arm  Th' Almighty of his sceptre to disarm  To push this earth adrist and leave it loose from heav'n  IV  Ye godlike Shades of legislators old  Ye who made Rome victorious Athens wise  Ye first of mortals with the blest enroll'd  Say did not horrour in your bosoms rise  When thus by impious Vanity impell'd  A magistrate a monarch ye beheld  Affronting civil Order's holiest bands  Those bands which ye so labour'd to improve  Those hopes and fears of justice from above  Which tam'd the savage world to your divine commands  ODE IX TO THE RIGHT REV BENJAMIN LORD BISHOP OF WINCHESTER  I  FOR toils which patriots have endur'd  For treason quell'd and laws secur'd  In ev'ry nation Time displays  The palm of honourable praise  Envy may rail and Faction fierce  May strive but what alas can those  Tho' bold yet blind and sordid foes  To gratitude and love oppose  To faithful story and persuasive verse  I  O Nurse of freedom Albion say  Thou tamer of despotick sway  What man among thy sons around  Thus heir to glory hast thou found  What page in all thy annals bright  Hast thou with purer joy survey'd  Than that where truth by Hoadley's aid  Shines thro' imposture's solemn shade  Thro' kingly and thro' sacerdotal night  I  To him the Teacher blest  Who sent religion from the palmy field  By Jordan like the morn to cheer the west  And lifted up the veil which Heav'n from earth conceal'd  To Hoadley thus his mandate he addrest  "Go thou and rescue my dishonour'd law  "From hands rapacious and from tongues impure  "Let not my peaceful name be made a lure  "Fell Persecution's mortal snares to aid  "Let not my words be impious chains to draw  "The freeborn soul in more than brutal awe  "To faith without assent allegiance unrepaid"  II  Stanza  II Mr Locke died in when Mr Hoadley was beginning to distinguish himself in the cause of civil and religious liberty Lord Godolphin in when the doctrines of the Jacobite faction were chiefly favoured by those in power Lord Somers in amid the practices of the Nonjuring clergy against the Protestant establishment and Lord Stanhope in during the controversy with the lower  ouse of Convocation  No cold or unperforming hand  Was arm'd by Heav'n with this command  The world soon felt it and on high  To William's ear with welcome joy  Did Locke among the blest unfold  The rising hope of Hoadley's name  Godolphin then confirm'd the fame  And Somers when from earth he came  And gen'rous Stanhope the fair sequel told  II  Then drew the lawgivers around  Sires of the Grecian name renown'd  And list'ning ask'd and wond'ring knew  What private force could thus subdue  The vulgar and the great combin'd  Could war with sacred folly wage  Could a whole nation disengage  From the dread bonds of many an age  And to new habits mould the publick mind  II  For not a conqueror's sword  Nor the strong pow'rs to civil founders known  Were his but truth by faithful search explor'd  And social sense like seed in genial plenty sown  Wherever it took root the soul restor'd  To freedom freedom too for others sought  Not monkish craft the tyrant's claim divine  Not regal zeal the bigot's cruel shrine  Could longer guard from Reason's warfare sage  Not the wild rabble to sedition wrought  Nor synods by the papal Genius taught  Nor St John's spirit loose nor Atterbury's rage  III  But where shall recompense be found  Or how such arduous merit crown'd  For look on life's laborious scene  What rugged spaces he between  Advent'rous Virtue's early toils  And her triumphal throne the shade  Of death meantime does oft' invade  Her progress nor to us display'd  Wears the bright heroine her expected spoils  III  Yet born to conquer is her pow'r  O Hoadley if that fav'rite hour  On earth arrive with thankful awe  We own just Heav'n's indulgent law  And proudly thy success behold  We attend thy rev'rend length of days  With benediction and with praise  And hail thee in our publick ways  Like some great spirit fam'd in ages old  III  While thus our vows prolong  Thy steps on earth and when by us resign'd  Thou join'st thy seniors that heroick throng  Who rescu'd or preserv'd the rights of humankind  O not unworthy may thy Albion's tongue  Thee still her friend and benefactor name  O never Hoadley in thy country's eyes  May impious gold or pleasure's gaudy prize  Make publick  tue publick freedom vile  Nor our own manners tempt us to disclaim  That heritage our noblest wealth and same  Which thou hast kept entire from force and factious guile  ODE X  I  IF rightly tuneful bards decide  If it be fix'd in Love's decrees  That beauty ought not to be try'd  But by its native pow'r to please  Then tell me Youths and Lovers tell  What fair can Amoret excel  II  Behold that bright unfully'd smile  And Wisdom speaking in her mien  Yet she so artless all the while  So little studious to be seen  We nought but instant gladness know  Nor think to whom the gift we owe  III  But neither musick nor the pow'rs  Of youth and mirth and frolick cheer  Add half that sunshine to the hours  Or make life's prospect half so clear  As mem'ry brings it to the eye  From scenes where Amoret was by  IV  Yet not a satirist could there  Or fault or indiscretion find  Nor any prouder sage declare  One virtue pictur'd in his mind  Whose form with lovelier colours glows  Than Amoret's demeanour shows  V  This sure is beauty's happiest part  This gives the most unbounded sway  This shall enchant the subject heart  When rose and lily fade away  And she be still in spite of time  Sweet Amoret in all her prime  ODE XI AT STUDY  I  WHITHER did my fancy stray  By what magick drawn away  Have I left my studious theme  From this philosophick page  From the problems of the sage  Wand'ring thro' a pleasing dream  II  'Tis in vain alas I find  Much in vain my zealous mind  Would to learned Wisdom's throne  Dedicate each thoughtful hour  Nature bids a softer pow'r  Claim some minutes for his own  III  Let the busy or the wise  View him with contemptuous eyes  Love is native to the heart  Guide its wishes as you will  Without love you 'll find it still  Void in one essential part  IV  Me tho' no peculiar fair  Touches with a lover's care  Tho' the pride of my desire  Asks immortal Friendship's name  Asks the palm of honest fame  And the old heroick lyre  V  Tho' the day have smoothly gone  Or to letter'd leisure known  Or in social duty spent  Yet at eve my lonely breast  Seeks in vain for perfect rest  Languishes for true content  ODE XII TO THE COUNTRY GENTLEMEN OF ENGLAND  I  WHITHER is Europe's ancient spirit fled  Where are those valiant tenants of her shore  Who from the warriourbow the strong dart sped  Or with firm hand the rapid poleaxe bore  Freeman and Soldier was their common name  Who late with reapers to the furrow came  Now in the front of battle charg'd the foe  Who taught the steer the wintry plough t' endure  Now in full councils check'd encroaching pow'r  And gave the guardian laws their majesty to know  II  But who are ye from Ebro's loit'ring sons  To Tiber's pageants to the sports of Seine  From Rhine's frail palaces to Danube's thrones  And cities looking on the Cimbrick main  Ye lost ye selfdeserted whose proud lords  Have baffled your tame hands and giv'n you swords  To slavish ruffians hir'd for their command  These at some greedy monk's or harlot's nod  See rifled nations crouch beneath their rod  These are the publick will the reason of the land  III  Thou heedless Albion what alas the while  Dost thou presume O inexpert in arms  Yet vain of freedom how dost thou beguile  With dreams of hope these near and loud alarms  Thy splendid home thy plan of laws renown'd  The praise and envy of the nations round  What care hast thou to guard from Fortune's sway  Amid the storms of war how soon may all  The lofty pile from its foundations fall  Of ages the proud toil the ruin of a day  IV  No thou art rich thy streams and fertile vales  Add industry's wise gifts to Nature's store  And ev'ry port is crowded with thy fails  And ev'ry wave throws treasure on thy shore  What boots it if luxurious plenty charm  Thy selfish heart from glory if thy arm  Shrink at the frowns of danger and of pain  Those gifts that treasure is no longer thine  Oh rather far be poor Thy gold will shine  Tempting the eye of Force and deck thee to thy bane  V  But what hath force or war to do with thee  Girt by the azure tide and thron'd sublime  Amid thy floating bulwarks thou canst see  With scorn the fury of each hostile clime  Dash'd ere it reach thee Sacred from the foe  Are thy fair fields Athwart thy guardian prow  No bold invader's foot shall tempt the strand  Yet say my Country will the waves and wind  Obey thee hast thou all thy hopes resign'd  To the sky's fickle faith the pilot's wav'ring hand  VI  For oh may neither fear nor stronger love  Love by thy virtuous princes nobly won  Thee last of many wretched nations move  With mighty armies station'd round the throne  To trust thy safety Then farewell the claims  Of Freedom her proud records to the flames  Then bear an off'ring at Ambition's shrine  Whate'er thy ancient patriots dar'd demand  From furious John's or faithless Charles's hand  Or what great William seal'd for his adopted line  VII  But if thy sons be worthy of their name  If lib'ral laws with lib'ral hearts they prize  Let them from conquest and from servile shame  In war's glad school their own protectors rise  Ye chiefly heirs of Albion's cultur'd plains  Ye leaders of her bold and faithful swains  Now not unequal to your birth be found  The publick voice bids arm your rural state  Paternal hamlets for your ensigns wait  And grange and fold prepare to pour their youth around  VIII  Why are ye tardy what inglorious care  Detains you from their head your native post  Who most their country's fame and fortune share  'Tis theirs to share her toils her perils most  Each man his task in social life sustains  With partial labours with domestick gains  Let others dwell to you indulgent Heav'n  By counsel and by arms the publick cause  To serve for publick love and love's applause  The first employment far the noblest hire hath giv'n  IX  Have ye not heard of Lacedaemon's fame  Of Attick chiefs in Freedom's war divine  Of Rome's dread gen'rals the Valerian name  The Fabian sons the Scipios matchless line  Your lot was theirs The farmer and the swain  Met his lov'd patron's summons from the plain  The legions gather'd the bright Eagles flew  Barbarian monarchs in the triumph mourn'd  The conq'rors to their household gods return'd  And fed Calabrian flocks and steer'd the Sabine plough  X  Shall then this glory of the antick age  This pride of men be lost among mankind  Shall war's heroick arts no more engage  The unbought hand the unsubjected mind  Doth valour to the race no more belong  No more with scorn of violence and wrong  Doth forming Nature now her sons inspire  That like some mystery to few reveal'd  The skill of arms abash'd and aw'd they yield  And from their own defence with hopeless hearts retire  XI  O shame to human life to human laws  The loose advent'rer hireling of a day  Who his fell sword without affection draws  Whose god whose country is a tyrant's pay  This man the lessons of the field can learn  Can ev'ry palm which decks a warriour earn  And ev'ry pledge of conquest while in vain  To guard your altars your paternal lands  Are social arms held out to your free hands  Too arduous is the lore too irksome were the pain  XII  Meantime by Pleasure's lying tales allur'd  From the bright sun and living breeze ye stray  And deep in London's gloomy haunts immur'd  Brood o'er your fortune's freedom's health's decay  O blind of choice and to yourselves untrue  The young grove shoots their bloom the fields renew  The mansion asks its lord the swains their friend  While he doth Riot's orgies haply share  Or tempt the gamester's dark destroying snare  Or at some courtly shrine with slavish incense bend  XIII  And yet full oft' your anxious tongues complain  That lawless tumult prompts the rustick throng  That the rude village inmates now disdain  Those homely ties which rul'd their fathers long  Alas your fathers did by other arts  Draw those kind ties around their simple hearts  And led in other parts their ductile will  By succour faithful counsel courteous cheer  Won them the ancient manners to revere  To prize their country's peace and Heav'n's duerites fulfil  XIV  But mark the judgment of experienc'd Time  Tutor of nations Doth light discord tear  A state and impotent sedition's crime  The pow'rs of warlike prudence dwell not there  The pow'rs who to command and to obey  Instruct the valiant There would civil sway  The rising race to manly concord tame  Oft' let the marshall'd field their steps unite  And in glad splendour bring before their sight  One common cause and one hereditary fame  XV  Nor yet be aw'd nor yet your task disown  Tho' war's proud votaries look on severe  Tho' secrets taught erewhile to them alone  They deem profan'd by your intruding ear  Let them in vain your martial hope to quell  Of new refinements fiercer weapons tell  And mock the old simplicity in vain  To the time's warfare simple or refin'd  The time itself adapts the warriour's mind  And equal prowess still shall equal palms obtain  XVI  Say then if England's youth in earlier days  On Glory's field with well train'd armies vy'd  Why shall they now renounce that gen'rous praise  Why dread the foreign mercenary's pride  Tho' Valois brav'd young Edward's gentle hand  And Albert rush'd on Henry's wayworn band  With Europe's chosen sons in arms renown'd  Yet not on Vere's bold archers long they look'd  Nor Audley's squires nor Mowbray'sycomen brook'd  They saw their standard fall and left their monarch bound  XVII  Such were the laurels which your fathers won  Such Glory's dictates in their dauntless breast  Is there no voice that speaks to ev'ry son  No nobler holier call to you addrest  O by majestick Freedom righteous Laws  By heav'nly Truth's by manly Reason's cause  Awake attend be indolent no more  By Friendship social Peace domestick Love  Rise arm your Country's living safety prove  And train her valiant youth and watch around her shore  ODE XIII ON RECOVERING FROM A FIT OF SICKNESS In the Country  I  THY verdant scenes O Goulder's Hill  Once more I seek a languid guest  With throbbing temples and with burden'd breast  Once more I climb thy steep aerial way  O faithful cure of oft'returning ill  Now call thy sprightly breezes round  Dissolve this rigid cough profound  And bid the springs of life with gentler movement play  II  How gladly 'mid the dews of dawn  My weary lungs thy healing gale  The balmy west or the fresh north inhale  How gladly while my musing footsteps rove  Round the cool orchard or the sunny lawn  Awak'd I stop and look to find  What shrub perfumes the pleasant wind  Or what wild songster charms the Dryads of the grove  III  Now ere the morning walk is done  The distant voice of Health I hear  Welcome as Beauty's to the lover's ear  "Droop not nor doubt of my return" she cries  "Here will I 'mid the radiant calm of noon  "Meet thee beneath yon' chestnut bow'r  "And lenient on thy bosom pour  "That indolence divine which lulls the earth and skies"  IV  The goddess promis'd not in vain  I found her at my fav'rite time  Nor wish'd to breathe in any softer clime  While halfreclin'd halfslumb'ring as I lay  She hover'd o'er me then among her train  Of Nymphs and Zephirs to my view  Thy gracious form appear'd anew  Then first O heav'nly Muse unseen for many a day  V  In that soft pomp the tuneful maid  Shone like the golden star of Love  I saw her hand in careless measures move  I heard sweet preludes dancing on her lyre  While my whole frame the sacred sound obey'd  New sunshine o'er my fancy springs  New colours clothe external things  And the last glooms of pain and sickly plaint retire  VI  O Goulder's Hill by thee restor'd  Once more to this enliven'd hand  My harp which late resounded o'er the land  The voice of Glory solemn and severe  My Dorian harp shall now with mild accord  To thee her joyful tribute pay  And send a less ambitious lay  Of friendship and of love to greet thy master's ear  VII  For when within thy shady seat  First from the sultry Town he chose  And the tir'd senate's cares his wish'd repose  Then wast thou mine to me a happier home  For social leisure where my welcome feet  Estrang'd from all th' intangling ways  In which the restless vulgar strays  Thro' Nature's simple paths with ancient Faith might roam  VIII  And while around his sylvan scene  My Dyson led the white wing'd Hours  Oft' from th' Athenian Academick bow'rs  Their sages came oft' heard our ling'ring walk  The Mantuan musick warbling o'er the green  And oft' did Tully's rev'rend shade  Tho' much for liberty afraid  With us of letter'd ease or virtuous glory talk  IX  But other guests were on their way  And reach'd ere long this favour'd grove  Ev'n the celestial progeny of Jove  Bright Venus with her allsubduing son  Whose golden shaft most willingly obey  The best and wisest As they came  Glad Hymen wav'd his genial flame  And sang their happy gifts and prais'd their spotless throne  X  I saw when thro' yon' festive gate  He led along his chosen maid  And to my friend with smiles presenting said  "Receive that fairest wealth which Heav'n assign'd  "To human fortune Did thy lonely state  "One wish one utmost hope confess  "Behold she comes t' adorn and bless  "Comes worthy of thy heart and equal to thy mind"  ODE XIV THE COMPLAINT  I  AWAY away  Tempt me no more insidious Love  Thy soothing sway  Long did my youthful bosom prove  At length thy treason is discern'd  At length some dearbought caution earn'd  Away nor hope my riper age to move  II  I know I see  Her merit Needs it now be shewn  Alas to me  How often to myself unknown  The graceful gentle virtuous maid  Have I admir'd how often said  What joy to call a heart like her's one's own  III  But flattering God  O squand'rer of content and ease  In thy abode  Will Care's rude lesson learn to please  O say Deceiver hast thou won  Proud Fortune to attend thy throne  Or plac'd thy friends above her stern decrees  ODE XV ON DOMESTICK MANNERS UNFINISHED  I  MEEK Honour female shame  O whither sweetest offspring of the sky  From Albion dost thou fly  Of Albion's daughters once the fav'rite fame  O Beauty's only friend  Who giv'st her pleasing rev'rence to inspire  Who selfish bold desire  Dost to esteem and dear affection turn  Alas of thee forlorn  What joy what praise what hope can life pretend  II  Behold our youths in vain  Concerning nuptial happiness inquire  Our maids no more aspire  The arts of bashful Hymen to attain  But with triumphant eyes  And cheeks impassive as they move along  Ask homage of the throng  The lover swears that in a harlot's arms  Are found the selfsame charms  And worthless and deserted lives and dies  III  Behold unbless'd at home  The father of the cheerless household mourns  The night in vain returns  For Love and glad Content at distance roam  While she in whom his mind  Seeks refuge from the day's dull task of cares  To meet him she prepares  Thro' noise and spleen and all the gamester's art  A listless harrass'd heart  Where not one tender thought can welcome find  IV  'Twas thus along the shore  Of Thames Britannia's guardian Genius heard  From many a tongue preferr'd  Of strife and grief the fond invective lore  At which the queen divine  Indignant with her adamantine spear  Like thunder sounding near  Smote the Redcross upon her silver shield  And thus her wrath reveal'd  I watch'd her awful words and made them mine  * * * * * * * * * *  END OF BOOK SECOND  MISCELLANIES  AN EPISTLE TO CURIO  Curio was a young Roman Senator of distinguished rank and parts Being profusely extravagant he soon dissipated a splendid fortune to supply the want of which he entered into the designs of Caesar against the liberties of his country altho' he had formerly been a professed enemy to him Cicero to whose care he had been committed upon his first entrance into the Forum exerted himself to prevent his ruin but without effect and he became one of the first victims in the Civil war This Epistle was first published in the when a celebrated patriot was supposed to have deserted the cause of his country The Author afterwards transformed it into the Ode to Curio  "a performance disgraceful only to its Author"  says a celebrated writer The Epistle which is too curious to be omitted we here give in its original form The Ode is printed p of this volume    THRICE has the spring beheld thy faded fame  And the fourth winter rises on thy shame  Since I exulting grasp'd the votive shell  In sounds of triumph all thy praise to tell  Blest could my skill thro' ages make thee shine  And proud to mix my memory with thine  But now the cause that wak'd my song before  With praise with triumph crowns the toil no more  If to the glorious man whose faithful cares  Nor quell'd by malice nor relax'd by years  Had aw'd Ambition's wild audacious hate  And dragg'd at length Corruption to her fate  If ev'ry tongue its large applauses ow'd  And wellearn'd laurels ev'ry Muse bestow'd  If publick justice urg'd the high reward  And Freedom smil'd on the devoted bard  Say then to him whose levity or lust  Laid all a people's gen'rous hopes in dust  Who taught Ambition firmer heights of pow'r  And sav'd Corruption at her hopeless hour  Does not each tongue its execrations owe  Shall not each Muse a wreath of shame bestow  And publick justice fanctify th' award  And Freedom's hand protect th' impartial bard  Yet long reluctant I forbore thy name  Long watch'd thy virtue like a dying flame  Hung o'er each glimm'ring spark with anxious eyes  And wish'd and hop'd the light again would rise  Put since thy guilt still more entire appears  Since no art hides no supposition clears  Since vengeful Slander now too sinks her blast  And the first rage of partyhate is past  Calm as the judge of Truth at length I come  To weigh thy merits and pronounce thy doom  So may my trust from all reproach be free  And Earth and Time confirm the fair decree  There are who say they view'd without amaze  Thy sad reverse of all thy former praise  That thro' the pageants of a patriot's name  They pierc'd the foulness of thy secret aim  Or deem'd thy arm exalted but to throw  The publick thunder on a private foe  But I whose soul consented to thy cause  Who felt thy genius stamp its own applause  Who saw the spirits of each glorious age  Move in thy bosom and direct thy rage  I scorn'd th' ungen'rous gloss of slavish minds  The owley'd race whom Virtue's lustre blinds  Spite of the learned in the ways of vice  And all who prove that each man has his price  I still believ'd thy end was just and free  And yet ev'n yet believe itspite of thee  Ev'n tho' thy mouth impure has dar'd disclaim  Urg'd by the wretched impotence of shame  Whatever filial cares thy zeal had paid  To laws infirm and liberty decay'd  Has begg'd Ambition to forgive the show  Has told Corruption thou wert ne'er her foe  Has boasted in thy country's awful ear  Her gross delusion when she held thee dear  How tame she follow'd thy tempestuous call  And heard thy pompous tales and trusted all  Rise from your sad abodes ye curst of old  For laws subverted and for cities sold  Paint all the noblest trophies of your guilt  The oaths you perjur'd and the blood you spilt  Yet must you one untempted vileness own  One dreadful palm reserv'd for him alone  With study'd arts his country's praise to spurn  To beg the infamy he did not earn  To challenge hate when honour was his due  And plead his crimes where all his virtue knew  Do robes of state the guarded heart enclose  From each fair feeling human nature knows  Can pompous titles stun th' enchanted ear  To all that reason all that sense would hear  Else couldst thou e'er desert thy sacred post  In such unthankful baseness to be lost  Else couldst thou wed the emptiness of vice  And yield thy glories at an idiot's price  When they who loud for liberty and laws  In doubtful times had fought their country's cause  When now of conquest and dominion sure  They  ought alone to hold their fruits secure  When taught by these Oppression hid the face  To leave Corruption stronger in her place  By silent spells to work the publick fate  And taint the vitals of the passive state  Till healing Wisdom should avail no more  And Freedom loath to tread the poison'd shore  Then like some guardian god that slies to save  The weary pilgrim from an instant grave  Whom sleeping and secure the guileful snake  Steals near and nearer thro' the peaceful brake  Then Curio rose toward the publick wo  To wake the heedless and incite the slow  Against Corruption Liberty to arm  And quell th' enchantress by a mightier charm  Swift o'er the land the fair contagion  lew  And with thy country's hopes thy honours grew  Thee patriot the Patrician roof confest  Thy pow'rful voice the rescu'd merchant blest  Of thee with awe the rural hearth resounds  The bowl to thee the grateful sailor crowns  Touch'd in the sighing shade with manlier sires  To trace thy steps the lovesick youth aspires  The learn'd recluse who oft' amaz'd had read  Of Grecian heroes Roman patriots dead  With new amazement hears a living name  Pretend to share in such forgotten fame  And he who scorning courts and courtly ways  Left the tame track of these dejected days  The life of nobler ages to renew  In virtues sacred from a monarch's view  Rous'd by thy labours from the bless'd retreat  Where social ease and publick passions meet  Again ascending treads the civil scene  To act and be a man as thou hadst been  Thus by degrees thy cause superiour grew  And the great end appear'd at last in view  We heard the people in thy hopes rejoice  We saw the senate bending to thy voice  The friends of freedom hail'd th' approaching reign  Of laws for which our fathers bled in vain  While venal Faction struck with new dismay  Shrunk at their frown and selfabandon'd lay  Wak'd in the shock the Publick Genius rose  Abash'd and keener from his long repose  Sublime in ancient pride he rais'd the spear  Which slaves and tyrants long were wont to fear  The City felt his call from man to man  From street to street the glorious horrour ran  Each crowded haunt was stirr'd beneath his pow'r  And murm'ring challeng'd the deciding hour  Lo the deciding hour at last appears  The hour of ev'ry freeman's hopes and fears  Thou Genius guardian of the Roman name  O ever prompt tyrannick rage to tame  Instruct the mighty moments as they rowl  And guide each movement steady to the goal  Ye Spirits by whose providential art  Succeeding motives turn the changeful heart  Keep keep the best in view to Curio's mind  And watch his fancy and his passions bind  Ye Shades immortal who by Freedom led  Or in the field or on the scaffold bled  Bend from your radiant seats a joyful eye  And view the crown of all your labours nigh  See Freedom mounting her eternal throne  The sword submitted and the laws her own  See publick Pow'r chastis'd beneath her stands  With eyes intent and uncorrupted hands  See private life by wisest arts reclaim'd  See ardent youth to noblest manners fram'd  See us acquire whate'er was sought by you  If Curio only Curio will be true  'Twas thenO shame O trust how ill repaid  O Latium oft' by faithless sons betray'd  'Twas thenWhat frenzy on thy reason stole  What spells unsinew'd thy determin'd soul  Is this the man in Freedom's cause approv'd  The man so great so honour'd so belov'd  This patient slave by tinsel chains allur'd  This wretched suitor for a boon abjur'd  This Curio hated and despis'd by all  Who fell himself to work his country's fall  O lost alike to action and repose  Unknown unpity'd in the worst of woes  With all that conscious undissembled pride  Sold to the insults of a foe defy'd  With all that habit of familiar same  Doom'd to exhaust the dregs of life in shame  The sole sad refuge of thy baffled art  To act a statesman's dull exploded part  Renounce the praise no longer in thy pow'r  Display thy virtue tho' without a dow'r  Contemn the giddy crowd the vulgar wind  And shut thy eyes that others may be blind  Forgive me Romans that I bear to smile  When shameless mouths your majesty defile  Paint you a thoughless frantick headlong crew  And cast their own impieties on you  For witness Freedom to whose sacred pow'r  My soul was vow'd from reason's earliest hour  How have I stood exulting to survey  My country's virtues op'ning in thy ray  How with the sons of ev'ry foreign shore  The more I match'd them honour'd her's the more  O Race erect whose native strength of soul  Which kings nor priests nor sordid laws control  Bursts the tame round of animal affairs  And seeks a nobler centre for its cares  Intent the laws of life to comprehend  And fix dominion's limits by its end  Who bold and equal in their love or hate  By conscious reason judging ev'ry state  The man forget not tho' in rags he lies  And know the mortal thro' a crown's disguise  Thence prompt alike with witty scorn to view  Fastidious Grandeur lift his solemn brow  Or all awake at Pity's soft command  Bend the mild ear and stretch the gracious hand  Thence large of heart from envy far remov'd  When publick toils to virtue stand approv'd  Not the young lover fonder to admire  Nor more indulgent the delighted sire  Yet high and jealous of their freeborn name  Fierce as the flight of Jove's destroying flame  Where'er Oppression works her wanton sway  Proud to confront and dreadful to repay  But if to purchase Curio's sage applause  My country must with him renounce her cause  Quit with a slave the path a patriot trod  Bow the meek knee and kiss the regal rod  Then still ye Pow'rs instruct his tongue to rail  Nor let his zeal nor let his subject fail  Else ere he change the style bear me away  To where the Gracchi where the Bruti  The two brothers Tiberius and Caius Gracchus lost their lives in attempting to introduce the only regulation that could give stability and good order to the Roman republick  Junius Brutus founded the commonwealth and died in its defence  stay  O long rever'd and late resign'd to shame  If this uncourtly page thy notice claim  When the loud cares of bus'ness are withdrawn  Nor welldrest beggars round thy footsteps fawn  In that still thoughtful solitary hour  When Truth exerts her unresisted pow'r  Breaks the false opticks ting'd with Fortune's glare  Unlocks the breast and lays the passions bare  Then turn thy eyes on that important scene  And ask thyselfif all be well within  Where is the heartfelt worth and weight of soul  Which labour could not stop nor fear control  Where the known dignity the stamp of awe  Which halfabash'd the proud and venal saw  Where the calm triumphs of an honest cause  Where the delightful taste of just applause  Where the strong reason the commanding tongue  On which the Senate fir'd or trembling hung  All vanish'd all are soldand in their room  Couch'd in thy bosom's deep distracted gloom  See the pale form of barb'rous Grandeur dwell  Like some grim idol in a sorc'rer's cell  To her in chains thy dignity was led  At her polluted shrine thy honour bled  With blasted weeds thy awful brow she crown'd  Thy pow'rful tongue with poison'd philters bound  That baffled Reason straight indignant flew  And fair Persuasion from her seat withdrew  For now no longer Truth supports thy cause  No longer Glory prompts thee to applause  No longer Virtue breathing in thy breast  With all her conscious majesty confest  Still bright and brighter wakes th' almighty flame  To rouse the feeble and the wilful tame  And where she sees the catching glimpses rowl  Spreads the strong blaze and all involves the soul  But cold restraints thy conscious fancy chill  And formal passions mock thy struggling will  Or if thy Genius e'er forget his chain  And reach impatient at a nobler strain  Soon the sad bodings of contemptuous mirth  Shoot thro' thy breast and stab the gen'rous birth  Till blind with smart from truth to frenzy tost  And all the tenour of thy reason lost  Perhaps thy anguish drains a real tear  While some with pity some with laughter hear  Can art alas or genius guide the head  Where truth and freedom from the heart are fled  Can lesser wheels repeat their native stroke  When the prime function of the soul is broke  But come unhappy Man thy sates impend  Come quit thy friends if yet thou hast a friend  Turn from the poor rewards of guilt like thine  Renounce thy titles and thy robes resign  For see the hand of Destiny display'd  To shut thee from the joys thou hast betray'd  See the dire fane of Infamy arise  Dark as the grave and spacious as the skies  Where from the first of time thy kindred train  The chiefs and princes of th' unjust remain  Eternal barriers guard the pathless road  To warn the wand'rer of the curs'd abode  But prone as whirlwinds scour the passive sky  The heights surmounted down the steep they fly  There black with frowns relentless Time awaits  And goads their footsteps to the guilty gates  And still he asks them of their unknown aims  Evolves their secrets and their guilt proclaims  And still his hands despoil them on the road  Of each vain wreath by lying bards bestow'd  Break their proud marbles crush their festal cars  And rend the lawless trophies of their wars  At last the gates his potent voice obey  Fierce to their dark abode he drives his prey  Where ever arm'd with adamantine chains  The watchful demon o'er her vassals reigns  O'er mighty names and giant pow'rs of lust  The Great the Sage the Happy and August  Titles which have been generally ascribed to the most pernicious of men    No gleam of hope their baleful mansion cheers  No sound of honour hails their unbless'd cars  But dire reproaches from the friend betray'd  The childless fire and violated maid  But vengeful vows for guardian laws essac'd  From towns enslav'd and continents laid waste  But long Posterity's united groan  And the sad charge of horrours not their own  For ever thro' the trembling space resound  And sink eaxh impious forehead to the ground  Ye mighty foes of Liberty and Rest  Give way do homage to a mightier guest  Ye daring Spirits of the Roman race  See Curio's toil your proudest claims efface  Aw'd at the name fierce Appius  Appius Claudius the Decemvir and L Cornelius Cinna both attempted toestablish a tyrannical dominion in Rome and both perished by the treason  rising bends  And hardy Cinna from his throne attends  "He comes" they cry "to whom the Fates assign'd  "With surer arts to work what we design'd  "From year to year the stubborn herd to sway  "Month all their wrongs and all their rage obey  "Till own'd their guide and trusted with their pow'r  "He mock'd their hopes in one decisive hour  "Then tir'd and yielding led them to the chain  "And quench'd the spirit we provok'd in vain"  But thou Supreme by whose eternal hands  Fair Liberty's heroick empire stands  Whose thunders the rebellious deep control  And quell the triumphs of the traitor's soul  O turn this dreadful omen far away  On Freedom's foes their own attempts repay  Relume her sacred fire so near supprest  And six her shrine in ev'ry Roman breast  Tho' bold Corruption boast around the land  "Let Virtue if she can my baits withstand"  Tho' bolder now she urge th' accursed claim  Gay with her trophies rais'd on Curio's shame  Yet some there are who scorn her impious mirth  Who know what conscience and a heart are worth  O Friend and Father of the human mind  Whose art for noblest ends our frame design'd  If I tho' fated to the studious shade  Which partystrife nor anxious pow'r invade  If I aspire in publick virtue's cause  To guide the Muses by sublimer laws  Do thou her own authority impart  And give my numbers entrance to the heart  Perhaps the verse might rouse her smother'd flame  And snatch the fainting patriot back to fame  Perhaps by worthy thoughts of humankind  To worthy deeds exalt the conscious mind  Or dash Corruption in her proud career  And teach her slaves that Vice was born to fear  LOVE AN ELEGY  Too much my heart of Beauty's pow'r hath known  Too long to Love hath Reason left her throne  Too long my Genius mourn'd his myrtle chain  And three rich years of youth consum'd in vain  My wishes lull'd with soft inglorious dreams  Forgot the patriot's and the sage's themes  Thro' each Elysian vale and Fairy grove  Thro' all th' enchanted paradise of Love  Misled by sickly Hope's deceitful flame  Averse to action and renouncing fame  At last the visionary scenes decay  My eyes exulting bless the newborn day  Whose faithful beams detect the dang'rous road  In which my heedless feet securely trod  And strip the phantoms of their lying charms  That lur'd my soul from Wisdom's peaceful arms  For silver streams and banks bespread with flow'rs  For mossy couches and harmonious bow'rs  Lo barren heaths appear and pathless woods  And rocks hung dreadful o'er unfathom'd floods  For openness of heart for tender smiles  Looks fraught with love and wrathdisarming wiles  Lo sullen Spite and perjur'd Lust of Gain  And cruel Pride and crueller Disdain  Lo cordial Faith to idiot airs re  in'd  Now coolly civil now transporting kind  For graceful Ease lo Affectation walks  And dull Halfsense for Wit and Wisdom talks  New to each hour what low delight succeeds  What precious furniture of hearts and heads  By nought their prudence but by getting known  And all their courage in deceiving shown  See next what plagues attend the lover's state  What frightful forms of Terrour Scorn and Hate  See burning Fury heav'n and earth defy  See dumb Despair in icy fetters lie  See black Suspicion bend his gloomy brow  The hideous image of himself to view  And fond Belief with all a lover's flame  Sinks in those arms that points his head with shame  There wan Dejection falt'ring as he goes  In shades and silence vainly seeks repose  Musing thro' pathless wilds consumes the day  Then lost in darkness weeps the hours away  Here the gay crowd of Luxury advance  Some touch the lyre and others urge the dance  On ev'ry head the rosy garland glows  In ev'ry hand the golden goblet flows  The Siren views them with exulting eyes  And laughs at bashful Virtue as she flies  But see behind where Scorn and Want appear  The grave remonstrance and the witty sneer  See fell Remorse in action prompt to dart  Her shaky poison thro' the conscious heart  And Sloth to cancel with oblivious shame  The fair memorial of recording Fame  Are these delights that one would wish to gain  Is this th' Elysium of a sober brain  To wait for happiness in female smiles  Bear all her scorn be caught with all her wiles  With pray'rs with bribes with lies her pity crave  Bless her hard bonds and boast to be her slave  To feel for trifles a distracting train  Of hopes and terrours equally in vain  This hour to tremble and the next to glow  Can Pride can Sense can Reason stoop so low  When Virtue at an easier price displays  The sacred wreaths of honourable praise  When Wisdom utters her divine decree  To laugh at pompous Folly and be free  I bid adieu then to these woful scenes  I bid adieu to all the sex of queens  Adieu to ev'ry suff'ring simple soul  That lets a woman's will his ease control  There laugh ye Witty and rebuke ye Grave  For me I scorn to boast that I'm a slave  I bid the whining brotherhood be gone  Joy to my heart my wishes are my own  Farewell the female heav'n the female hell  To the great god of Love a glad farewell  Is this the triumph of thy awful name  Are these the splendid hopes that urg'd thy aim  When first my bosom own'd thy haughty sway  When thus Minerva heard thee boasting say  "Go martial Maid elsewhere thy arts employ  "Nor hope to shelter that devoted boy  "Go teach the solemn sons of Care and Age  "The pensive statesmen and the midnight sage  "The young with me must other lessons prove  "Youth calls for Pleasure Pleasure calls for Love  "Behold his heart thy grave advice disdains  "Behold I bind him in eternal chains"  Alas great Love how idle was the boast  Thy chains are broken and thy lessons lost  Thy wilful rage has tir'd my suff'ring heart  And passion reason forc'd thee to depart  But wherefore dost thou linger on thy way  Why vainly search for some pretence to stay  When crowds of vassals court thy pleasing yoke  And countless victims bow them to the stroke  Lo round thy shrine a thousand youths advance  Warm with the gentle ardours of romance  Each longs t' assert th cause with feats of arms  And make the world consess Dulcinea's charms  Ten thousand girls with flow'ry chaplets crown'd  To groves and streams thy tender triumph  ound  Each bids the stream in murmurs speak her flame  Each calls the grove to sigh her shepherd's name  But if thy pride such easy honours scorn  If nobler trophies must thy toil adorn  Behold yon' flow'ry antiquated maid  Bright in the bloom of threescore years display'd  Her shalt thou bind in thy delightful chains  And thrill with gentle pangs her wither'd veins  Her frosty cheek with crimson blushes dye  With dreams of rapture melt her maudlin eye  Turn then thy labours to the servile crowd  Entice the wary and control the proud  Make the sad miser his best gains forego  The solemn statesman sigh to be a beau  The bold coquette with fondest passion burn  The Bacchanalian o'er his bottle mourn  And that chief glory of thy pow'r maintain  "To poise ambition in a female brain"  Be these thy triumphs but no more presume  That my rebellious heart will yield thee room  I know thy puny force thy simple wiles  I break triumphant thro' thy slimsy toils  I see thy dying lamp's last languid glow  Thy arrows blunted and unbrac'd thy bow  I feel diviner fires my breast inflame  To active science and ingenuous fame  Resume the paths my earliest choice began  And lose with pride the lover in the man  A BRITISH PHILIPPICK OCCASIONED BY THE INSULTS OF THE SPANIARDS AND THE PRESENT PREPARATIONS FOR WAR  WHENCE this unwonted transport in my breast  Why glow my thoughts and whither would the Muse  Aspire with rapid wing Her country's cause  Demands her efforts at that sacred call  She summons all her ardour throws aside  The trembling lyre and with the warriour's trump  She means to thunder in each British ear  And if one spark of honour

honour of their several fun  ons and of the relations which they bear to the natural and to the moral world Their origin is deduced from the first allegorical deities or powers of Nature according to the doctrine of the old mythological poets concerning the generation of the gods and the rise of things They are then successively considered as giving motion to the air and exciting summer breezes as nourishing and beautifying the vegetable creation as contributing to the fulness of navigable rivers and consequently to the maintenance of commerce and by that means to the maritime part of military p  er Next is represented their favourable influence upon health when assisted by rural exercise which introduces their connexion with the art of physick and the happy effects of mineral medicinal springs Lastly they are celebrated for the friendship which the Muses  them and for the true inspiration which temperance only can receive in opposition to the enthusiasm of the more licentious poets  O'ER yonder eastern hill the Twilight pale  Walks forth from darkness and the god of Day  With bright Astraea seated by his side  Waits yet to leave the ocean Tarry Nymphs  Ye Nymphs ye blueey'd progeny of Thames  Who now the mazes of this rugged heath  Trace with your fleeting steps who all night long  Repeat amid the cool and tranquil air  Your lonely murmurs tarry and receive  My offer'd lay To pay you homage due  I leave the gates of Sleep nor shall my lyre  Too far into the splendid hours of Morn  Engage your audience my observant hand  Shall close the strain ere any sultry beam  Approach you to your subterranean haunts  Ye then may timely steal to pace with care  The humid sands to loosen from the soil  The bubbling sources to direct the rills  To meet in wider channels or beneath  Some grotto's dripping arch at height of noon  To slumber shelter'd from the burning heav'n  Where shall my song begin ye Nymphs or end  Wide is your praise and copiousFirst of things  First of the lonely pow'rs ere Time arose  Were Love and Chaos Love the fire of Fate  ℣  LoveElder than Chaos  Hesiod in his Theogony gives a different account and makes Chaos the eldest of beings though he assigns to Love neither father nor superiour which circumstance is particularly mentioned by Phaedrus in Plato's Banquet as being observable not only in Hesiod but in all other writers both of verse and prose and on the same occasion he cites a line from Parmenides in which Love is expressly styled the eldest of all the gods Yet Aristophanes in The Birds affirms that  "Chaos and Night and Erebus and Tartarus were first and that Love was produced from an egg which the sablewinged Night deposited in the immense bosom of Erebus"  But it must be observed that the Love designed by this comick poet was always distinguished from the other from that original and selfexistent being the ΤΟ ΟΝ or ΑΓΑΘΟΝ of Plato and meant only the ΔΗΜΙΟΥΡΓΟΣ or second person of the old Grecian trinity to whom is inscribed an hymn among those which pass under the name of Orpheus where he is called Protogonos or the Firstbegotten is said to have been born of an egg and is represented as the principal or origin of all these external appearances of Nature In the Fragments of Orpheus collected by Henry Stephens he is named Phanes the Discoverer or Discloser who unfolded the ideas of the Supreme Intelligence and exposed them to the perception of inferiour beings in this visible frame of the world as Mocrobius and Proclus and Athenagoras all agree to interpret the several passages of Orpheus which they have preserved  But the Love designed in our text is the one selfexistent and Infinite Mind whom if the generality of ancient mythologists have not introduced or truly described in accounting for the production of the world and its appearances yet to a modern poet it can be no objection that he hath ventured to differ from them in this particular though in other respects he professeth to imitate their manner and conform to their opinions for in these great points of natural theology they differ no less remarkably among themselves and are perpetually confounding the philosophical relations of things with the traditionary circumstances of mythick history upon which very account Callimachus in his Hymn to Jupiter declareth his dissent from them concerning even an article of the national creed adding that the ancient bards were by no means to be depended on And yet in the exordium of the old Argonautick poem ascribed to Orpheus it is said that  "Love whom mortals in later times call Phanes was the father of the eternally begotten Night"  who is generally represented by these mytholOgical poets as being herself the parent of all things and who in The Indigitamenta or Orphick Hymns is said to be the same with Cypris or Love itself Moreover in the body of this Argonautick poem where the personated Orpheus introduceth himself singing to his lyre in reply to Chiron he celebrateth  "the obscure memory of Chaos and the natures which it contained within itself in a state of perpetual vicissitude how the heaven had its boundary determined the generation of the earth the depth of the ocean and also the sapient Love the most ancient the selfsufficient with all the beings which he produced when he separated one thing from another"  which noble passage is more directly to Aristotle's purpose in the first book of his Metaphysicks than any of those which he has there quoted to shew that the ancient poets and mythologists agreed with Empedocles Anaxagoras and the other more sober philosophers in that natural anticipation and common notion of mankind concerning the necessity of mind and reason to account for the connexion motion and good order of the world For though neither this poem nor the hymns which pass under the same name are it should seem the work of the real Orpheus yet beyond all question they are very ancient The hymns more particularly are allowed to be older than the invasion of Greece by Xerxes and were probably a set of publick and solemn forms of devotion as appears by a passage in one of them which Demosthenes hath almost literally cited in his first oration against Aristogiton as the saying of Orpheus the founder of their most holy mysteries On this account they are of higher authority than any other mythological work now extant the Theogony of Hesiod himself not excepted The poetry of them is often extremely noble and the mysterious air which prevails in them together with its delightful impression upon the mind cannot be better expressed than in that remarkable description with which they inspired the German editor Eschenbach when he accidentally met with them at Leipsick  "Thesaurum me reperisse credidi"  says he  "et prosecto thesaurum reperi Incredibile dictu quo me sacro horrore afflaverint indigitamenta ista deorum nam et tempus ad illorum lectionem eligere cogebar quod vel solum horrorem incutere animo potest nocturnum cum enim totam diem consumserim in contemplando urbis splendore et in adeundis quibus scatet urbs illa viris doctis sola nox restabat quam Orpheo consecrare potui In abyssum quendam mysteriorum venerandae antiquitatis descendere videbar quotiescunque silente mundo solis vigilantibus astris et luna  istos hymnos ad manus sumsi"  ℣  Chaos  The unformed undigested mass of Moses and Plato which Milton calls  "The womb of Nature"  Ibid Love the sire of Fate  Fate is the universal system of natural causes the work of the Omnipotent Mind or of Love so Minucius Felix  "Quid enim aliud eft fatum quam quod de unoquoque nostrum deus fatus est"  So also Cicero in the first Book on Divination  "Fatum autem id appello quod Graeci ΕΙΡΜΑΡΜΕΝΗΝ id est ordinem seriemque causarum cum causa causae nexa rem ex se gignatex quo intelligitur ut fatum sit non id quod superstitiose sed id quod physice dicitur causa aeterna rerum"  To the same purpose is the doctrine of Hierocles in that excellent fragment concerning Providence and Destiny As to the three Fates or Destinies of the poets they represented that part of the general system of natural causes which relate to man and to other mortal beings for so we are told in the hymn addressed to them among the Orphick Indigitamenta where they are called the daughters of Night or Love and contrary to the vulgar notion are distinguished by the epithets of Gentle and Tenderhearted According to  Hesiod  Theog  ver  they were the daughters of Jupiter and Themis but in the Orphick Hymn to Venus or Love that goddess is directly styled the mother of Necessity and is represented immediately after as governing the three Destinies and conducting the whole system of Natural causes  Elder than Chaos Born of Fate was Time  ℣  Born of Fate was Time  Cronos Saturn or Time was according to Apollodorus the son of Coelum and Tellus but the author of the Hymns gives it quite undisguised by mythological language and calls him plainly the offspring of the Earth and the starry Heaven that is of Fate as explained in the preceding note  Who many sons and many comely births  Devour'd relentless Father till the child  ℣  Who many sons devour'd  The known fable of Saturn devouring his children was certainly meant to imply the dissolution of natural bodies which are produced and destroyed by Time  ℣  The childOf Rhea  Jupiter so called by Pindar  Of Rhea drove him from the upper sky  ℣  Drove him from the upper sky  That Jupiter dethroned his father Saturn is recorded by all the mythologists Phurnutus or Cornutus the author of a little Greek treatise on the nature of the gods informs us that by Jupiter was meant the vegetable soul of the world which restrained and prevented those uncertain alterations which Saturn or Time used formerly to cause in the mundane system  And quell'd his deadly might Then social reign'd  ℣  Then social reign'd  c Our mythology here supposeth that before the establishment of the vital vegetative plastick nature represented by Jupiter the four elements were in a variable and unsettled condition but afterwards welldisposed and at peace among themselves Tethys was the wife of the Ocean Ops or Rhea the earth Vesta the eldest daughter of Saturn fire and the Cloudcompeller or  the air though he also represented the plastick principle of nature as may be seen in the Orphick hymn inscribed to him  The kindred pow'rs Tethys and rev'rend Ops  And spotless Vesta while supreme of sway  Remain'd the Cloudcompeller From the couch  Of Tethys sprang the sedgycrowned race  ℣  The sedgycrowned race  The rivergods who according to Hesiod's Theogony were the sons of Oceanus and Tethys  Who from a thousand urns o'er ev'ry clime  Send tribute to their parent and from them  ℣  From themAre ye O Naiads  The descent of the Naiads is less certain than most points of the Greek mythology  Homer  Odyss  xiii  Virgil in the eighth book of the Aeneid speaks as if the Nymphs or Naiads were the parents of the rivers but in this he contradicts the testimony of Hesiod and evidently departs from the orthodox system which representeth several nymphs as retaining to every single river On the other hand Callimachus who was very learned in all the schooldivinity of those times in his Hymn to Delos maketh Peneus the great Thessalian rivergodthe father of his nymphs and Ovid in the fourteenth book of his Metamorphoses mentions the Naiads of Latium as the immediate daughters of the neighbouring rivergods Accordingly the Naiads of particular rivers are occasionally both by Ovid and Statius called by a patronymick from the name of the river to which they belong  Are ye O Naiads Arethusa fair  And tuneful Aganippe that sweet name  Bandusia that soft family which dwelt  With Syrian Daphne and the honour'd tribes  ℣  Syrian Daphne  The grove of Daphne in Syria near Antioch was famous for its delightful fountains  Ibid The tribesBelov'd of Paeon  Mineral and medicinal

languid pinions aid from you  They ask Favonius and the mild Southwest  From you relief implore your sallying streams  ℣  Your sallying streams  The state of the atmosphere with respect to rest and motion is in several ways affected by rivers and running streams and that more especially in hot seasons first they destroy its equilibrium by cooling those parts of it with which they are in contact and secondly they communicate their own motion and the air which is thus moved by them being left heated is of consequence more elastick than other parts of the atmosphere and therefore fitter to preserve and to propagate that motion  Fresh vigour to their weary wings impart  Again they fly disporting from the mead  Half ripen'd and the tender blades of corn  To sweep the noxious mildew or

Thames  Ye love to wander Amalthea pours  ℣  Amalthea  The mother of the first Bacchus whose birth and education was written as Diodorus Siculus informs us in the old Pelasgick character by Thymoetes grandson to Laomedon and contemporary with Orpheus Thymoetes had travelled over Libya to the country which borders on the western ocean there he saw the island of Nysa and learned from the inhabitants that  "Ammon king of Libya was married in former ages to Rhea sister of Saturn and the Titans that he afterwards fell in love with a beautiful virgin whose name was Amalthea had by her a son and gave her possession of a neighbouring track of land wonderfully fertile which in shape nearly resembling the horn of an ox was thence called the Hesperian horn and afterwards the horn of Amalthea that fearing the jealousy of Rhea he concealed the young Bacchus with his mother in the island of Nysa"  the beauty of which Diodorus describes with great dignity and pomp of style This fable is one of the noblest in all the ancient mythology and seems to have made a particular impression on the imagination of Milton the only modern poet unless perhaps it be necessary to except Spenser who in these mysterious traditions of the poetick story had a heart to feel and words to express the simple and solitary genius of Antiquity To raise the idea of his Paradise he prefers it even to  "that Nysean isle  "Girt by the river Triton where old Cham  "Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove  "Hid Amalthea and her florid son  "Young Bacchus from his stepdame Rhea's eye"  Wellpleas'd the wealth of

air  The ivymantled thyrsus or the torch  Thro' black smoke flaming to the Phrygian pipe's  ℣  Phrygian pipe's  The Phrygian musick was fantastick and turbulent and fit to excite disorderly passions  Shrill voice and to the clashing cymbals mix'd  With shrieks and frantick uproar May the gods  From ev'ry unpolluted ear avert  Their orgies If within the seats of men  Within the walls the gates where Pallas holds  ℣  The gates where Pallas holdsThe guardian key  It was the office of Minerva to be the guardian of walled cities whence she was named ΠΟΑΙΑΣ and ΠΟΔΙΟΥΧΟΣ and had her statues placed in their gates being supposed to keep the keys and on that account styled ΚΑΗΔΟΥΧΟΣ  The guardian key if haply there be found  Who loves to mingle with the revel band  And hearken to their accents who aspires  From such instructers to inform his breast  With verse let him fit votarist implore  Their inspiration He perchance the gifts  Of young Lyaeus and the dread exploits  May sing in aptest numbers he the fate  ℣  FateOf sober Pentheus  Pentheus was torn in pieces by the Bacchanalian priests and women for despising their mysteries  Of sober Pentheus he the Paphian rites  And naked Mars with Cytherea chain'd  And strong Alcides in the spinster's robes  May celebrate applauded but with you  O Naiads far from that unhallow'd rout  Must dwell the man whoe'er to praised themes  Invokes th' immortal Muse Th' immortal Muse  To your calm habitations to the cave  ℣  The caveCorycian  Of this cave Pausanias in his tenth book gives the following description  "Between Delphi and the eminences of Parnassus is a road to the grotto of Corycium which has its name from the nymph Corycia and is by far the most remarkable which I have seen One may walk a great way into it without a torch It is of a considerable height and hath several springs within it and yet a much greater quantity of water distils from the shell and roof so as to be continually dropping on the ground The people round Parnassus hold it sacred to the Corycian nymphs and to Pan"  Corycian or the Delphick mount will guide  ℣  Delphick mount  Delphi the seat and oracle of Apollo had a mountainous and rocky situation on the skirts of Parnassus  His footsteps and with your unsully'd streams  His lips will bathe whether th' eternal lore  Of Themis or the majesty of Jove  To mortals he reveal or teach his lyre  Th' unenvy'd guerdon of the patriot's toils  In those unfading islands of the blest  Where sacred bards abide Hail honour'd Nymphs  Thrice hail for you the Cyrenaick shell  ℣  Cyrenaick  Cyrene was the native country of Callimachus whose Hymns are the most remarkable example of that mythological passion which is assumed in the preceding poem and have always afforded particular pleasure to the author of it by reason of the mysterious solemnity with which they affect the mind On this account he was induced to attempt somewhat in the same manner solely by way of exercise the manner itself being now almost entirely abandoned in poetry and as the mere genealogy or the personal adventures of Heathen gods could have been but little interesting to a modern reader it was therefore thought proper to select some convenient part of the history of Nature and to employ these ancient divinities as it is probable they were first employed to wit in personifying natural causes and in representing the mutual agreement or opposition of the corporeal and moral powers of the world which hath been accounted the very highest office of poetry  Behold I touch revering to my songs  Be present ye with favourable feet  And all profaner audience far remove  HYMN TO SCIENCE  "O vitae philosophia dux O virtutis indagatrix expultrixque vitiorumTu urbes peperisti tu inventrix legum tu magistra morum et disciplinae fuisti ad te confugimus a te opem petimus"  CIC  Tusc Quaest  I  SCIENCE thou fair effusive ray  From the great source of mental day  Free gen'rous and refin'd  Descend with all thy treasures fraught  Illumine each bewilder'd thought  And bless my lab'ring mind  II  But first with thy resistless light  Disperse those phantoms from my sight  Those mimick shades of thee  The scholiast's learning sophist's cant  The visionary bigot's rant  The monk's philosophy  III  O let thy pow'rful charms impart  The patient head the candid heart  Devoted to thy sway  Which no weak passions e'er mislead  Which still with dauntless steps proceed  Where Reason points the way  IV  Give me to learn each secret cause  Let Number's Figure's Motion's laws  Reveal'd before me stand  These to great Nature's scenes apply  And round the globe and thro' the sky  Disclose her working hand  V  Next to thy nobler search resign'd  The busy restless human mind  Thro' ev'ry maze pursue  Detect perception where it lies  Catch the ideas as they rise  And all their changes view  VI  Say from what simple springs began  The vast ambitious thoughts of man  Which range beyond control  Which seek eternity to trace  Dive thro' th' infinity of space  And strain to grasp the whole  VII  Her secret stores let Mem'ry tell  Bid Fancy quit her Fairy cell  In all her colours drest  While prompt her sallies to control  Reason the judge recalls the soul  To truth's severest test  VIII  Then lanch thro' Being's wide extent  Let the fair scale with just ascent  And cautious steps be trod  And from the dead corporeal mass  Thro' each progressive order pass  To Instinct Reason God  IX  There Science veil thy daring eye  Nor dive too deep nor soar too high  In that divine abyss  To Faith content thy beams to lend  Her hopes t' assure her steps befriend  And light her way to bless  X  Then downwards take thy flight again  Mix with the policies of men  And social Nature's ties  The plan the genius of each state  Its int'rest and its pow'rs relate  Its fortunes and its rise  XI  Thro' private life pursue thy course  Trace ev'ry action to its source  And means and motives weigh  Put tempters passions in the scale  Mark what degrees in each prevail  And fix the doubtful sway  XII  That last best effort of thy skill  To form the life and rule the will  Propitious Pow'r impart  Teach me to cool my passions' fires  Make me the judge of my desires  The master of my heart  XIII  Raise me above the vulgar's breath  Pursuit of fortune fear of death  And all in life that is mean  Still true to reason be my plan  Still let my actions speak the man  Thro' ev'ry various scene  XIV  Hail queen of Manners light of truth  Hail charm of age and guide of youth  Sweet refuge of distress  In bus'ness thou exact polite  Thou giv'st retirement its delight  Prosperity its grace  XV  Of wealth pow'r freedom thou the cause  Foundress of order cities laws  Of arts inventress thou  Without thee what were humankind  How vast their wants their thoughts how blind  Their joys how mean how few  XVI  Sun of the soul thy beams unveil  Let others spread the daring sail  On Fortune's faithless sea  While undeluded happier I  From the vain tumult timely fly  And sit in peace with thee  INSCRIPTIONS  I FOR A GROTTO  To me whom in their lays the shepherds call  Actaea daughter of the neighb'ring stream  This cave belongs The figtree and the vine  Which o'er the rocky entrance downward shoot  Were plac'd by Glycon he with cowslips pale  Primrose and purple lychnis deck'd the green  Before my threshold and my shelving walls  With honeysuckle cover'd Here at noon  Lall'd by the murmur of my rising fount  I slumber here my clust'ring fruits I tend  Or from the humid flow'rs at break of day  Fresh garlands weave and chase from all my bounds  Each thing impure or noxious Enter in  O Stranger undismay'd nor bat nor toad  Here lurks and if thy breast of blameless thoughts  Approve thee not unwelcome shalt thou tread  My quiet mansion chiefly if thy name  Wise Pallas and th' immortal Muses own  II FOR A STATUE OF CHAUCER AT WOODSTOCK  SUCH was old Chaucer such the placid mien  Of him who first with harmony inform'd  The language of our fathers Here he dwelt  For many a cheerful day These ancient walls  Have often heard him while his legends blithe  He sang of love or knighthood or the wiles  Of homely life thro' each estate and age  The fashions and the follies of the world  With cunning hand portraying Tho' perchance  From Blenheim's tow'rs O Stranger thou art come  Glowing with Churchill's trophies yet in vain  Dost thou applaud them if thy breast be cold  To him this other hero who in times  Dark and untaught began with charming verse  To tame the rudeness of his native land  III  WHOE'ER thou art whose path in summer lies  Thro' yonder village turn thee where the grove  Of branching oaks a rural palace old  Imbosoms there dwells Albert gen'rous lord  Of all the harvest round and onward thence  A low plain chapel fronts the morning light  Fast by a silent rivulet Humbly walk  O Stranger o'er the consecrated ground  And on that verdant hillock which thou seest  Beset with osiers let thy pious hand  Sprinkle fresh water from the brook and strew  Sweetsmelling flow'rs for there doth Edmund rest  The learned shepherd for each rural art  Fam'd and for sons harmonious and the woes  Of illrequited love The faithless pride  Of fair Matilda sank him to the grave  In manhood's prime but soon did righteous Heav'n  With tears with sharp remorse and pining care  Avenge her falsehood nor could all the gold  And nuptial pomp which lur'd her plighted faith  From Edmund to a lostier husband's home  Relieve her breaking heart or turn aside  The strokes of Death Go Traveller relate  The mournful story haply some fair maid  May hold it in remembrance and be taught  That riches cannot pay for truth or love  IV  O Youths and Virgins O declining Eld  O pale Misfortune's slaves O ye who dwell  Unknown with humble Quiet ye who wait  In courts or fill the golden seat of kings  O sons of Sport and Pleasure O thou Wretch  That weepst for jealous love or the sore wounds  Of conscious guilt or Death's rapacious hand  Which left thee void of hope O ye who roam  In exile ye who thro' th' embattled field  Seek bright renown or who for nobler palms  Contend the leaders of a publick cause  Approach behold this Marble know ye not  The features hath not oft' his faithful tongue  Told you the fashion of your own estate  The secrets of your bosom Here then round  His monument with rev'rence while ye stand  Say to each other "This was Shakespeare's form  "Who walk'd in ev'ry path of human life  "Felt ev'ry passion and to all mankind  "Doth now will ever that experience yield  "Which his own genius only could acquire"  V  GVLIELMVS III FORTIS PIVS LIBERATOR CVM INEVNTE AETATE PATRIAE LABENTI ADFVISSET SALVS IPSE VNICA

and the scene  Around contemplate well This is the place  Where England's ancient Barons clad in arms  And stern with conquest from their tyrant king  Then render'd tame did challenge and secure  The Charter of thy freedom Pass not on  Till thou hast bless'd their memory and paid  Those thanks which God appointed the reward  Of publick virtue And if chance thy home  Salute thee with a father's honour'd name  Go call thy sons instruct them what a debt  They owe their ancestors and make them swear  To pay it by transmitting down entire  Those sacred rights to which themselves were born  VII THE WOODNYMPH  APPROACH in silence it is no vulgar tale  Which I the Dryad of this hoary oak  Pronounce to mortal ears The second age  Now hasteneth to its period since I rose  On this fair lawn The groves of yonder vale  Are all my offspring and each Nymph who guards  The copses and the surrow'd fields beyond  Obeys me Many changes have I seen  In human things and many awful deeds  Of justice when the ruling hand of Jove  Against the tyrants of the land against  The unhallow'd sons of Luxury and Guile  Was arm'd for retribution Thus at length  Expert in laws divine I know the paths  Of Wisdom and erroneous Tolly's end  Have oft' presag'd and now wellpleas'd I wait  Each ev'ning till a noble youth who loves  My shade a while releas'd from publick cares  Yon' peaceful gate shall enter and sit down  Beneath my branches then his musing mind  I p  ompt unseen and place before his view  Sincerest forms of good and move his heart  With the dread bounties of the Sire Supreme  Of gods and men with Freedom's gen'rous deeds  The losty voice of Glory and the faith  Of sacred Friendship Stranger I have told  My function if within thy bosom dwell  Aught which may challenge praise thou wilt not leave  Unhonour'd my abode nor shall I hear  A sparing benediction from thy tongue  VIII  YE Pow'rs unseen to whom the bards of Greece  Erected altars ye who to the mind  More lofty views unfold and prompt the heart  With more divine emotions if erewhile  Not quite unpleasing have my votive rites  Of you been deem'd when oft' this lonely seat  To you I consecrated then vonchsafe  Here with your instant energy to crown  My happy solitude It is the hour  When most I love t' invoke you and have felt  Most frequent your glad ministry divine  The air is calm the sun's unveiled orb  Shines in the middle heav'n the harvest round  Stands quiet and among the golden sheaves  The reapers lie reclin'd the neighb'ring groves  Are mute nor ev'n a linnet's random strain  Echoeth amid the silence Let me feel  Your influence ye kind Pow'rs Aloft in heav'n  Abide ye or on those transparent clouds  Pass ye from hill to hill or on the shades  Which yonder elms cast o'er the lake below  Do you converse retir'd From what lov'd haunt  Shall I expect you Let me once more feel  Your influence O ye kind inspiring Pow'rs  And I will guard it well nor shall a thought  Rise in my mind nor shall a passion move  Across my bosom unobserv'd unstor'd  By faithful Memory and then at some  More active moment will I call them forth  Anew and join them in majestick forms  And give them utt'rance in harmonious strains  That all mankind shall wonder at your sway  IX  ME tho' in life's sequester'd vale  Th' Almighty Sire ordain'd to dwell  Remote from Glory's toilsome ways  And the great scenes of publick praise  Yet let me still with grateful pride  Remember how my infant frame  He temper'd with prophetick flame  And early musick to my tongue supply'd  'Twas then my future fate he weigh'd  And this be thy concern he said  At once with Passion's keen alarms  And Beauty's pleasurable charms  And sacred Truth's eternal light  To move the various mind of man  Till under one unblemish'd plan  His reason fancy and his heart unite  CONTENTS  ODES  Book I Ode I Page  Book I Ode II On the Winter Solstice  Book I Ditto as it was originally written  Book I Ode III To a Friend unsuccessful in
