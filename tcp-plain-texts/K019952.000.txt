 AN ODE TO THE NAIADS OF FLEETDITCH  By ARTHUR MURPHY  Esq  Out with it Dunciad let the Secret pass  That Secret to each Fool that he's an Ass  POPE  Aspice num mag√® sit nostrum penetrabile telum  VIRG  LONDON Printed for M COOPER in Paternoster Row MDCCLXI  ADVERTISEMENT  IT is a just image given us by Mr  Congreve  of the situation of an author where he mentions a POET ambitious of praise and a CRITIC picking his pocket It is indeed almost impossible for any man to distinguish himself in the literary world without having a gang of these people swarming about him though he has at the same time this consolation that all such  petty larceny  attempts are a mark of his fame and the unprovoked abuse of illdesigning persons is in its own nature involuntary praise  The author of the following trifle has had his share of this kind of trouble ever since his name has been heard of he has boasted upon a former occasion of the honour a certain reverend writer did him by his calumny but as if that was not sufficient his name is now adorned with a PARSON CHURCHILL This last person's hand he has felt in his pocket twice in a very short time in the  Rosciad  it was but a dip and away but as if  this astonishing genius who has lately amazed mankind had improved in his trade in his  Apology  he has attempted to make an intire rummage Whether he has taken any thing out of the present writer's pocket is a point not very certain so that the loss however cannot be very great  But it may be asked Can the Reverend Mr  Churchill  Curate of  St John's Westminster  be considered as Mr  Murphy  's literary pickpocket when he boldly owns his name and shews himself to the publicIn answer to this it should be considered that these people have various ways of doing their business Some of them sneak in alleys and little lurking holes and as a gentleman passes by they make a snatch at his pocket and should they prove so unfortunate as to give an alarm and meet with a short turn "  Pray remember the poorfor the love of  " Others of them go more daringly to work  Bob  do you see that gentleman yondershall I  DO  him    Ay ay  cries Bob  do him by all means    So I willLink your honourlight your honour across the streetmy name is  CHARLEY DUNGHILL  I ply here every night your honour    Then on he runs twirling his link almost in your facegives you an unlucky splash and in your sudden confusion makes a snap at your handkerchief his friends admire his dexterity he is proclaimed abroad for a notable clever fellow you are told he is a bruiser into the bargain and handles an OAKSTICK wonderfully  This will be acknowledged to be the case among the pilferers in our common streets and among their brethren of the quill the conduct is so similar that the writer of the subsequent Ode cannot consider the REVEREND CHARLES CHURCHILL in any other light than that of a CRITIC PICKING HIS POCKET and as he is well informed that Mr  John Fielding  has attained many points highly serviceable to society by  quick notice and sudden pursuit  among the nimblefingered race who infest this metropolis he is in hopes that the same means will operate equally in the literary world For this purpose he now thinks proper to celebrate the egregious endowments of this New Adventurer desiring it may be remembered that this is the first notice he has given of him for notwithstanding the insinuations of Mr  Churchill  and his friends be it hereby known that Mr  Murphy  never wrote or caused to be written directly or indirectly a single line in the  Critical Review  In justice however to the public and himself he thinks it now incumbent on him to give the best description he can of the man who has at two different times made an attempt upon him Should this furious  Drawcansir  after this think proper to proceed in his design Mr  Murphy  in consideration of his being  unbeneficed  and reflecting how hard the present dearness of provisions and the  late Tax  upon PORTER must bear upon the Reverend Bard most heartily gives his consent to be abused by him  "Body Soul and Muse"  as often as thirst or  hunger shall prompt his genius and should he be told hereafter that the author of unpoetic libels is not hurt in his preferment but that "to one bishop  Churchill  seems a wit" he promises him to repine less at his success though provoked than Mr  Churchill  and his little faction seem unprovoked to have done at Mr  Murphy  's  Lincoln'sInn    th June      P S  To some particular ideas and modes of expression which will be found in the following lines the author persuades himself that they who are acquainted with the stile and colouring of Mr  Dryden  in the  Mac Flecknoe  and Mr  Pope  in the  Dunciad  will take no exception unless they should chuse to criticise the too manifest inferiority of his genius  ODE TO THE NAIADS OF FLEETDITCH  I  _YE nutbrown Naiads of that sable flood  To which auxiliar sewers their homage pay  And little rills meand'ring o'er the mud  Wind from a thousand urinals their way  To swell his course what time the king of dykes  Into the silver  Thames  impetuous strikes  Each weed  that on the margin grows  Drinks  life and stench  as on he flows  Now the rich stream of Nusance foul and strong  With kenneldrains confederated pours along  O'er filth and  Cloacina  's yellow reign  Now swelling o'er his banks amain  See him devolve in sullen pride  Dead cats and dogs and drunken bards down headlong with the tide  II  Yes nymphs ye blackey'd daughters of  Fleetditch  When Midnight in her mantle black as pitch  Led forth her shadowy train  On  Parnassus'  high domain  The Muse hath heard your piteous cry  Hath heard ye pierce the vaulted sky  And like ten thousand grinding scizzars shrill  Your screams her ears with discord harsh did fill  While you perform'd thro' all the mire  The orgies of your sooty quire  Then sitting on the swampy bank  With sable ooze your tresses dank  Dirt still inspiring all your throng  From ev'ry breast burst forth the miserable song  III  "Perdition quick perdition seize  "The caitiff the pernicious man  "Who first the citizens to please  "Of a new bridge devis'd the plan  "No longer our muchlov'd domain  "In dear stagnation shall remain  "No more the mudnymphs here shall keep  "Their lazy courts no more shall sleep  "In puddle here but o'er the bed  "Where gentle SMEDLEY plunged his head  "Where fam'd OLDMIXON awful sire  "Souc'd in and wallow'd in the mire  "Where all our fav'rites lov'd to sink  "Inhaling vigour from the stink  "This bed the scene of all our joys  "In evil hour you bridge destroys  "May quick perdition seize the man  "Who big with ruin form'd the plan  IV  These were the notes that reach'd the Muse's ears  The Muses mark'd your unmelodious  "Without the meed of some melodious tear"  MILTON  tears  Then saw ye headlong down the steep  Explore the bottom of the deep  Plung'd into endless night  Ev'n now in ev'ry cell beneath  Where toads obscene and adders breathe  Conceal'd from human sight  The virgins of poetic eye  Can your disastrous state descry  Can see from your dripping hair  The faded honours rend away  Each feature fell with dire dismay  And all your slattern bosoms bare  V  Your screams too pierc'd the watchman's soul  Soho he cried and couch'd his quiv'ring pole  Ah Naiads cureless is your woe  Then let your sorrows flow  Yes rant and rave and yell and hiss  The more you cry the less you'll  Yes o'er your heads a street shall rise  Through which fair  Albion  with surprize  Shall see rough Industry with eye intent  Adown his cheek while wholesome dewdrops roll  Urge eager on on schemes of riches bent  And lay his burden at the wish'dfor goal  Thither  Pomona  her first fruits shall send  The gifts of  Golden  CERES that way bend  Wellloaded Commerce o'er your heads shall bound  And with the gilded carr th' ecchoing pavement shall resound  VI  Ah deem not burghers of the dyke  That to insult ye all forlorn  My willing hand the lyre doth strike  Alas you have full cause to mourn  To you no more shall muchlov'd SHIRLEY come  No more reveal the honours of his bum  No more you'll see him drunk with gin  No more admire his ghastly grin  With him no longer now you'll flirt  And fling the mud and fling the dirt  No more alas you'll bruise the toad  For him its venom to unload  And fill him with rank poison to the brim  But now he'll look both impotent and grim  His eyes sunk hollow in their pit  And nothing from his mouth to spit  VII  Where shall your CHURCHILL in that dismal hour  When stopt are all your sewers and all your pow'r  Where shall he wander Not thy warbling fount  Aonian Aganippe  not thy shades  Laurell'd  Parnassus  nor thy sacred mount  Thricehonour'd  Pindus  not the tuneful maids  That with sweet airs bid  Isis  banks resound  Or knit in dance where  Camus  winds along  With the young Graces o'er th' enamell'd ground  Move to some measure of immortal song  Not these could ever charm not these detain  His steps unhallow'd from your drear domain  Your dripping arches where the lazy flood  Just oozes thro' and stagnates into mud  He still preferr'd  There oft was heard  To your delighted ears to read his page  His modern  Atalantis  of the Stage  How wanton LUCY spreads her charms  And clasps her fav'rite in her arms  He told of wounds obscene and am'rous scars  In the soft conflict gain'd of  Venus'  wars  Of the sweet thefts and kind deceits  The falshoods perjuries and cheats  Of ev'ry actress and her crony  Through the whole DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Through your vast courts while all your strumpet brood  Heard the lewd loves with wanton glee  And testify'd their joy in frantic mood  From ha ha hato he he he  VIII  Not ev'n the solemn bell that tolls  The signal of departed souls  And bodies waiting fun'ral rite  Withheld him from his dear delight  Tho' the pale corse from ev'ry sable shroud  Call'd for the last sad obsequies aloud  "Inter us Doctor by the Pow'rs above  "Nor grudge malignant to our claycold limbs  "One particle of earthso lightly fall  "Whate'er the  Critical Review  indites  "Whate'er the MIMIC in his pleasant vein  "Conceives of clumsy Curatesso may  Flexney  "For each dull work afford thee half a crown  "And in  St Giles  's none be happier thought  "Than thy unclassic Musethough now in haste  "Yet tarry Doctor in mere pity tarry  "The dust thrice thrown you then may wing your flight"  He wings his flight allheedless of their prayer  No dirge he mutters o'er the tomb  But wages war with ev'ry nameless play'r  Irrev'rend warbut now his doom  With yours impendswhat shall he do  With tears and sighs and groans he'll rue  Your empire's fallno more he'll sit  In foremost row before the astonish'd pit  In brawn OLDMIXON'S rival as in wit  And grin dislike  And kiss the spike  And twist his mouth and wreath his head awry  The arch absurd quick glancing from his eye  And giggle  And wriggle  And fiddle  And piddle  And piddlepaddle  And fiddlefaddle  And shew with pious leer and double chin  That arrogance and gospel dwell within  IX  Ah  Parodissa Ironissa  too  Soft  Simperilla  mild but never true  Envyna  pale  Waggilla  once a maid  But now call'd in to each lewd scribbler's aid  Oh all ye mudnymphs Ah the hours are fled  When at his wellknown voice your ev'ry head  Above the filth you rais'd and at the sight  Of the dear Bard with frantic cries  Of hideous joy the realms of light  You pierc'd then headlong from the skies  As  Arethusa  her son sprung from Gods  You led him flound'ring to your drear abodes  From hollow cells he heard the adders hiss  As first he enter'd on this world of p  No water there from limpid sources springs  To chafe his head no nymph the towel brings  Far other rites your sisterhood employ  Far other orgies of obscener joy  With ordure fresh his body one anoints  And wakes new vigour in his languid joints  Another stradling o'er his head with grace  Lets fly the briny torrent in his face  The briny torrent down his temples ran  He breath'd  Fleetditch  and stunk above a man  Then rowl'd his eyes and star'd tremendous wit  Though to mere mortals but a priest b  Then bow'd his uncouth form and smil'd  And with soft prate the hours beguil'd  With wonder ey'd the secret store  Of Inf'rence sly and quaint conceit  Like embryos on the swampy floor  Waiting from him their birth to meet  He saw where essays against each good play  And much of libel upon merit lay  'Gainst  Gray  and  Mason  much pert flimsy ode  Of yellowtinctur'd ROSCIAD many a load  Much  Gazetteer  much  Craftsman  struck his view  Much of himself and much of  Shirley  too  He saw where scandal's streams arise  And wind their urinary course along  From Grubstreet bards the fount of lies  Scanty at first but swelling strong  From tributary urns  Joy o'er his visage burns  As a view around he takes  Of  Criticism  's dull stagnate lakes  As  Defamation  pours and stinks along  As  Inuendo  's rills creep softly by  As  Irony  its bottom to the eye  Betrays all foul and  Malice  deep and strong  Now flows amain with tide profound  Now shallow grown just murmurs o'er the ground  X  Joy fills his soul joy sheds a mellower grace  O'er the brown horrors of his walnut face  Of ev'ry stream he quaffs deep drafts immense  And drinks oblivion of all truth and sense  Intoxicates his brains until in fuming rills  At  Flexney  's door he all again distils  But ah ye Naiads now your reign is o'er  And now your  Unborn Bard  no more  To your beloved haunts shall go  And woo his loves impure in grots of mud below  No more seek inspiration at your shrine  But all alone unheard unknown he'll pine  Mirth shall no more revisit those dim eyes  Unless he hear when patient Merit sighs  But Merit still shall hold her steady flight  Though Malice all her deadliest shafts should aim  Though clouds oft interpose shall rise to light  And soar on wings which her own hands have form'd to Fame  FINIS
