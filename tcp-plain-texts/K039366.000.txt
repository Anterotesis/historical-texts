 THE MAID of the OAKS A New Dramatic Entertainment AS IT IS PERFORMED AT THE THEATREROYAL in DRURYLANE  nec dulces amores  Sperne Puer neque tu choreas  Donec virenti canities abest  Morosa  HOR  LONDON  Printed for T BECKET the Corner of the Adelphi in the Strand Bookseller to their Royal Highnesses the PRINCE of WALES BISHOP of OSNABRUG PRINCE WILLIAM and PRINCE EDWARD MDCCLXXIV PRICE ONE SHILLING AND SIXPENCE  PREFACE  THE Author of the following Scenes fully sensible how much he owes to the talents of the  Actor  the  Musician  and the  Painter  can derive no confidence from the success of the representation when he delivers them over to the judgement of the closet But deficient as he may be in the execution of this essay he cannot submit to be thought ignorant in the principles of Dramatic Writing and would willingly premise the origin and progress of his design as an explanation if not a justification of some of its imperfections  Every one may remember how much the Fête Champétre given by a noble Lord last summer engaged the public curiosity It was thought that to preserve for a more general display an entertainment of so singular and elegant a kind would be not only pleasing to the public but serviceable to the polite arts Accordingly permission having been obtained to employ the music and to copy some of the decorations a plan was projected for adapting them to the Stage  The Fable by the means of which they were to be introduced being only the secondary object and the intention  then  to confine the representation to two acts a plot of the utmost simplicity was judged the most proper and in that decision the Author rests upon the example of Moliere and many of the best criticks of perhaps the best age in Theatrical History who in pieces of this nature though they introduced characters of comedy purposely avoided in several instances those intricacies and combinations of incidents which generally but perhaps falsly are supposed essential to a regular Drama  It is not the business of this preface to draw a parallel between the English and French Stages but it may not be out of place just to touch the characters of each provided it be permitted to lay Shakespear out of the question He stands single and inimitable his excellencies cannot be weighed because it is impossible to counterballance the scale Without appeal therefore to his almost supernatural powers we may pronounce the properties of our Stage whether considered in Tragedy or Comedy to consist in energy spirit sublimity force of character and of expressionlike the Hercules of Farnese all is muscle and nervewith equal truth it must be confessed that a few examples excepted and those not much in the course of acting at present we must turn to France to find the graces of the Apolloart regularity elegance delicacy touches of sentiment adapted only to the  most polished manners distinguish their Theatres In literary warfare we call their compositions insipid they describe ours as barbarousboth are unjustall will agree that to blend strength and refinement would be to attain perfection  No candid reader will suppose the Author of this piece means to infer that he has in any degree accomplished this union in the part which has fallen to his share but he will be bold to say it is the only part which has been wanting to complete a species of entertainment new to this country elegant in its principle and innocent if not beneficial in its tendency He will be amply rewarded even in the failure of his specimen if it excites others who may be better qualified to pursue the same ideas  They who suppose an English audience because used to plain entertainment are incapable of relishing the most refined are greatly mistaken It is true there will ever be spectators in the two extremes of the house who are tasteless and despicableto the honour of the town be it said they are but fewand whether they bawl for a hornpipe from the Upper Gallery or yawn in the weariness of dissipapation in the Boxes they equally betray stupidity prejudice or caprice But the middle class and bulk of the assembly like that of the kingdom at large will ever be on the side of nature truth and sense Let the piece be founded upon those principles  and applause will follow every circumstance of elegance and decoration that can accompany them  A sincere zeal for the improvement of the stage has prompted this digression It is requisite now to return for a moment to the history of the undertaking  Mr Garrick after perusing the outlines of the two original acts thought he discovered in the writer some talents for the higher species of comedy and encouraged him to extend his plan The scenery also which in the first sketches promised a brilliant effect the composition of the music and the names of the dancers who were engaged all seemed to require more distinction than could be given to them in an afterpiece But the most prevalent incentive to the Author was the promise of Mr Garrick's assistance his judgement pervaded the whole and though it may diminish the poet it is the pride of the friend to make a public acknowledgement to that gentleman in the words of Horace to Melpomene  Quod spiro et placeo si placeo tuum est  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr KING  UNLIKE to  ancient Fame  all eyes tongues ears  See  modern Fame  dress'd capapee appears  In

DUPELEY meeting  Sir HARRY  DEAR Charles welcome to England and doubly welcome to Oldsworth's OaksFriendship I see has wings as well as loveyou arrive at the moment I wished I hope in your haste you have not forgot a fancy dress  DUPELEY  No no I am a true friend and prepar'd for all your whimsies amorous and poetical Your summons found me the day after my arrival and I took post immediatelynext to my eagerness to  see you was that of being in time for the Fête ChampétreNovelty and pleasure are the beings I pursueThey have led me half the world over already and for ought I know they may sometime or other carry me to the Otaheite  Sir HARRY  You have pursued but their shadowshere they reign in the manners of this New Arcadia and the smiles of the sweet Maid of the Oaks  DUPELEY  Who in the name of curiosity is she that bears this romantic title for your letter was a mere eclogue the devil a thing could I make out but a rhapsody upon rural innocence and an invitation from a gentleman I did not know to an entertainment I never sawWhat are we to have a representation of the Pastorfido in a Garden  Sir HARRY  The Pastorfido is before you  in propria persona  the business of the day is a wedding and Charles Dupeley is invited to see his friend Sir Harry Grovebey united to the most charming of her sex  DUPELEY  The devil it is What a young fellow of your hopes and fortune sacrificed to a marriage of romance But prithee relieve my impatience and tell me who she is  Sir HARRY  An orphan ward of the worthy old gentleman at whose seat you now are His character is singular and as amiable in its way as her's Inheriting a great estate and liberally educated his  disposition led him early to a country life where his benevolence and hospitality are boundless and these qualities joined with an imagination bordering upon the whimsical have given a peculiar turn to the manners of the neighbourhood that in my opinion degrades the polish of courtsbut judge of the original  Enter OLDWORTH  Mr Oldworth I present you my friend he is just arrived from abroad I will not repeat how much he is worthy of your friendship  OLDWORTH  To be worthy of your's Sir Harry is the best recommendation  To Dupeley  Sir your friend is going to receive from my hands a lovely girl whose merit he has discern'd and lov'd for its own sake Such nuptials should recal the ideas of a better age he has permitted me to celebrate them upon my own plan and I shall be happy to receive the judgement of an accomplish'd critic  DUPELEY  Sir by what I already see of Oldworth's Oaks and know of the character of the master I am persuaded the talent most necessary for the company will be that of giving due praise  Enter HURRY  HURRY  Lord Sir come down to the building directlyall the trades are together by the earsit is for all the world like the tower of Babylonthey have drove a broadwheel waggon over two hampers of wine and it is all running among lilies and honeysuckles  one of the cooks stumbled over one of the clouds and threw a ham and chickens into a tub of white washa lamplighter spilt a gallon of oil into a cream'd appletart and they have sent for more roses and there is not one left within twenty miles  OLDWORTH  Why honest Hurry if there is none to be had you need not be in such haste about 'emMercy on us my Fête has turn'd this poor fellow's head already he will certainly get a fever  HURRY  Get a favour Sirwhy there has not been one left these three hours all the girls in the parish have been scrambling for them and I must get a hundred yards moreLord a mercy there is so much to do at once and nobody to do it that it is enough to moider one's head  Oldworth and Hurry talk together  DUPELEY  Ha ha ha is this one of the examples you produce Sir Harry to degrade the polish of courts  Sir HARRY  If I did have you never met with a courtier in your travels as busy as important and as insignificant upon yet more trifling occasionsWhy my friend Hurry's is the true bustle of an antichamber with this difference that there is rather more attachment and fidelity to the master at the bottom of it  During this speech Hurry is expressing by his action his impatience for Oldworth to go  HURRY  Law Sir if you loiter longer I tell you they will all be at loggerheadsthey were very near it when I came away  Exit  OLDWORTH  Mr Dupeley you'll excuse meHurry convinces me my presence is necessary elsewherethis is a busy day  DUPELY  The greatest compliment you can pay me is not not to look upon me as a stranger  OLDWORTH  I forgot to tell you Sir Harry that Lady Bab Lardoon is in the neighbourhood and I expect her every momentshe promised to be with us long before the hour of general invitation  DUPELY  Who is she pray  Sir HARRY  Oh she's a superioura phoenixmore worthy your curiosity than any object of your travelsShe is an epitome or rather a caricature of what is call'd  very  fine life and the first female gamester of the time  OLDWORTH  For all that she is amiableone cannot help discerning and admiring the natural excellence of her heart and understanding though she is an example that neither is proof against a false education and a rage for fashionable excessesBut when you see her she will best explain herselfThis fellow will give me no rest  HURRY returns  Rest Sir why I have not slept this fortnight come along Sir pray make hastenothing's to be done without it  OLDWORTH  Nor with it honest Hurry  Exit with Hurry  DUPELEY  A cunning old fellow I warrantwith  his ward and his love of merit for its own sake  ha ha hapr'ythee how came your acquaintance in this odd family  Sir HARRY  Don't sneer and I will tell youBy mere chance' in a progress of amusement to this side the country The story is too delicate for thy relish suffice it that I came saw and lov'dI laid my rank and fortune at the fair one's feet and would have married instantly but that Oldworth opposed my precipitancy and insisted upon a probation of six months absenceIt has been a purgatory  DUPELEY  All this is perfectly  en regle  for a man of home educationI should like to see the woman that could entangle  me  in this manner  Sir HARRY  There is not a fellow in England has a more susceptible heart You may have learnt in your foreign tour to disguise it but if you have lost it put all your acquisitions together and the ballance will be against you  DUPELEY  I have learned at least not to have it imposed upon Shew me but a woman from an Italian  Princess to a figurante at the French opera or change the scene and carry me to the rural nymphs from a vintage in Burgundy to a dance round a maypole at Oldsworth's Oaksand at the first glance I will discover the whole extent of their artifice find their true lure and bring them to my hand as easily as a tame sparrow  Sir HARRY  And pray my sagacious friend upon what circumstances have you formed your suspicions that  I  am more likely to be impos'd upon than yourself  DUPELEY  Upon every one I have seen and heard but above all upon that natural propensity of every true homebred Englishman to think one woman different from anotherNow I hold there is but one woman in the world  Sir HARRY  I perfectly agree and Maria is that charming one  DUPELEY  Ay but Maria and Lady Bab and Pamela Andrews and Clarissa Harlowe and the girl that steals a heart in a country church or she that picks your pocket in CoventGarden are one and the same creature for all thatI am always too quick for them and make fools of them firstOh do but try them by the principle I have laid down you'll find them as transparent as glass  Sir HARRY  My own principle will answer my purpose just as well with that perspective I have looked through  the woman and discovered the angel and you will do the same when you see her or never brag of your eyesight more  DUPELEY  Rhapsody and enthusiasmI should as soon discover Mahomet's seventh heaven but what says your uncle old Groveby to this match  Sir HARRY  Faith I have asked him no questions and why should I when I know what must be his answer  DUPELEY  Oh he can never disapprove a passion that soars above the stars  Sir HARRY  He has all the prejudices of his years and wordly knowledge the common old Gentleman's characterYou may see it in every drama from the days of Terence to those of Congreve though not perhaps with quite so much good humour and so little obstinacy as my Uncle shews He is ever most impetuous when most kind and I dare trust his resentment will end with a dramatic forgiveness Should it not I may have pride in the sacrifice of his estate but no regretSo much for fortune Charlesare there any other means to reconcile me to your approbation  DUPELEY  'Gad I know but one moreHave you laid any plan for succeeding at the divorceshop next winter It would be some comfort to your friends to see you had a retreat in your head  Sir HARRY  Charles I have listened to your raillery with  more patience than it deserves and should at last be out of humour with such an importation of conceit and affectation if I was not sure your good sense would soon get the better of it This is called knowing the worldto form notions without perhaps ever seeing a man in his natural character or conversing with a woman of principle and then for fear of being imposed upon be really dup'd out of the most valuable feelings in human nature confidence in friendship and esteem in love  Enter HURRY  Lord Sir I am out of breath to find you why almost every thing is ready except yourself and Madam Maria is gone to the Grove and she is so dress'd and looks so charming  Sir HARRY  Propitious be the hourhere Hurry find out this Gentleman's servant and shew him where he is to dress  Exit  DUPELEY  Oh take care of yourself Corydon the first I shall be time enough Hurry shall first shew me a little of the preparationwhat is going forward here  Approaching the side scene  HURRY  Hold Sir not that way my Master lets no body see his devices and figaries there  DUPELEY  Why what is he doing there Hurry  HURRY  Doingas you are a gentleman I will tell you what he is doingI hope no body hears us  Looking  about  Why he is going to make the sun shin at midnight and he is covering it with a thousand yards of sailcloth for fear the rain should put it outlord such doingshere this way your honour  DUPELEY  But hark'ee honest Hurry do stand still a moment to oblige me  HURRY  Stand still Sirlord Sir if I stand still every thing stands still and then what a fine  ShamPeter  should we make of it  Always restless  DUPELEY  You seem to know every thing here  HURRY  To be sure I doI am no fool I believewhat think you Sir  DUPELEY  He that takes you for a fool is not over wise I warrant him therefore let me ask you a question or two  HURRY  Tomorrow Sir with all my heart but I have so many questions to ask myself and so many answers to give that I have not five minutes to spare  DUPELEY  Three minutes will do my business Who is this Maid of the Oaks friend Hurry  HURRY  A young lady Sir  DUPELEY  I thought as much  Smiling  You are a courtier friend Hurry  HURRY  I court herheaven forbidshe's going to be married Sir  DUPELEY  Well said simplicity If you won't tell me  who  she is tell me  what  she is  HURRY  She is one of the most charmingest sweetest delightfulest mildest beutifulest modestest genteelest never to be prais'd enough young creature in all the world  DUPELEY  True courtier again Who is her father pray  HURRY  It's a wise child that knows its own father lord bless her she does not want a father  DUPELEY  Not while Mr Oldworth lives  HURRY  Nor when he is dead neither every body would be glad to be her father and every body wishes to be her husband and so Sir if you have more questions to ask I'll answer them another time for I am wanted here and there and every where  Bustles about  DUPELEY  Shew me my chamber to dress and I'll desire no more of you at present  HURRY  Bless your honour for letting me go I have been very miserable all the while you were talking to methis way this way Sir  Exit  DUPELEY  What a characteryet he has his cunning though the simplest swain in this region

DA CAPO  Come sing c  Enter OLDWORTH  OLDWORTH  Joy to my sweet Maria may long succeeding years resemble this her bridal hour may health and peace and love still inspire her song and make the harmony of her voice an emblem of her life but come my girl if there is a wish remaining in your heart within my power to gratify I hope in this last hour of my cares I shall not be a stranger to it  MARIA  If I have a wish you have not indulged Sir I fear it must be an improper one or it would not have escaped you  OLDWORTH  You seem disconcerted Maria be more explicit  MARIA  My mind is incapable of reserve with you the most generous of men is on the point of giving his hand to yourwhat shall I call myself I am almost nameless but as the creature of your bounty and cares this title gives me a value in my own eyes but I fear it is all I have to boast The mystery you have kept makes me apprehensive there is something in my origin ought to be concealedwhat am I to interpret from your smiles  OLDWORTH  Every thing that is contrary to your surmises be patient sweet Maid of the Oaks before night all mysteries shall be cleared It is not an ordinary wedding I celebrate I prepare a feast for the heartLady Bab Lardoon as I livethe princess of dissipation catch an observation of her while you can Maria for though she has been but three days out of London she is as uneasy as a mole in sunshine and would expire if she did not soon dive into her old element again  Enter Lady BAB  Lady BAB  Dear Maria I am happy to be the first of your company to congratulate youwell Mr Oldworth I am delighted with the idea of your Féte it is so novel so French so expressive of what every body  understands and nobody can explain then there is something so spirited in an undertaking of ex+pence where a shower of rain would spoil it all  OLDWORTH  I did not expect to escape from so fine a lady but you and the world have free leave to comment upon all you see here  Laugh where you must be candid where you can  I only hope that to celebrate a joyful event upon any plan that neither hurts the morals or politeness of the company and at the same time sets thousands of the industrious to work cannot be thought blame worthy  Lady BAB  Oh quite the contrary and I am sure it will have a run a force upon the seasons and the manners is the true test of a refined taste and it holds good from a cucumber at Christmas to an Italian opera  MARIA  Is the rule the same among the ladies lady Bab is it also a definition of their refinement to act in all things contrary to nature  Lady BAB  Not absolutely in all things though more so than people are apt to imagine for even in circumstances that seem most natural fashion prompts ten times where inclination prompts once and there would be an end of gallantry in this country if it was not for the sake of reputation  OLDWORTH  What do you mean  Lady BAB  Why that a woman without a connection  grows every day a more awkward personage one might as well go into company without powderif one does not  really  despise old vulgar prejudices it is absolutely necessary to affect it or one must sit at home alone  OLDWORTH  Indeed  Lady BAB  Yes like lady Sprose and talk morals to the parrot  MARIA  This is new indeed I always supposed that in places where freedom of manners was most countenanced a woman of unimpeachable conduct carried a certain respect  Lady BAB  Only fit for sheepwalks and  Oakeries  I beg your pardon Mr Oldworthin town it wou'd just raise you to the whistparty of old lady Cypher Mrs Squabble and lord Flimzey and at every public place you wou'd stand among the footmen to call your own chair while all the maccaronies passed by whistling a song through their toothpicks and giving a shrug  dem it 'tis pity that so fine a woman shou'd be lost to all common decency  MARIA  smiling  I believe I had better stay in the  Oakery  as you call it for I am afraid I shall never procure any  civility  in town upon the terms required  Lady BAB  Oh my dear you have chose a horrid word to express the intercourse of the bon ton  civility  may be very proper in a mercer when one is chusing a  silk but  familiarity  is the life of good company I believe this is quite since your time Mr Oldworth but 'tis by far the greatest improvement the beau monde ever made  OLDWORTH  A certain ease was always an essential part of good breeding but lady Bab must explain her meaning a little further before we can decide upon the improvement  Lady BAB  I mean that participation of society in which the French used to excel and we have now so much outdone our modelsI maintain that among the  superior  setmind I only speak of themour men and women are put more upon a footing together in London than they ever were before in any age or country  OLDWORTH  And pray how has this happy resolution been effected  Lady BAB  By the most charming of all institutions wherein we shew the world that liberty is as well understood by our women as by our men we have our  Bill of Rights  and our  Constitution  too as well as theywe drop in at all hours play at all parties pay our own reckonings and in every circumstance petticoats excepted are true lively jolly fellows  MARIA  But does not this give occasion to a thousand malicious insinuations  Lady BAB  Ten  thousand my dearbut no  great measures  can be effected without a contempt of popular clamour  OLDWORTH  Paying of reckonings is I confess new since my time and I should be afraid it might sometimes be a little heavy upon a lady's pocket  Lady BAB  A mere trifleone generally wins themJack Saunter of the guards lost a hundred and thirty to me upon score at one time I have not eat him half out yethe will keep me best part of next winter but exclusive of that the club is the greatest system of oeconomy for married families ever yet established  OLDWORTH  Indeed but how so pray  Lady BAB  Why all the servants may be put to board wages or sent into the country except the footmenno plunder of housekeepers or maitres de hotel no long butcher's billsLady Squander protests she has wanted no provision in her family these six months except potatoes to feed the children and a few frogs for the French governessthen our dinnersocieties are so amusing all the doves and hawks together and one converses so freely there's no topick of White's or Almack's in which we do not bear a part  MARIA  Upon my word I should be a little afraid that some of those subjects might not always be managed with sufficient delicacy for a lady's ear especially an unmarried one  Lady BAB  Bless me why where's the difference Miss must have had a strange education indeed not to know as much as her Chapron I hope you would not have the daughters blackball'd when the mothers are chose Why it is almost the only place where some of them are likely to see each other  Enter Sir HARRY GROVEBY  Sir HARRY  I come to claim my lovely bridehere at her favourite tree I claim her minethe hour is almost on the point the whole country is beginning to assemble every preparation of Mr Oldworth's fancy is preparing  And while the priest accuse the Bride's delay  Roses and myrtles shall obstruct her way  MARIA  Repugnance would be affectation my heart is all your own and I scorn the look or action that does not avow it  OLDWORTH  Come Sir Harry leave your protestations which my girl does not want and see a fair stranger  Lady BAB  Sir Harry I rejoice at your happinessand do not think me so tasteless Maria as not to acknowledge an attachment like yours preferable to all others when it can be had  filer le parfait amour  is the first happiness in life But that you know is totally out of the question in town the matrimonial comforts in  our  way are absolutely reduced to two to  plague a man and to bury him the glory is to plague him first and  bury him  afterwards  Sir HARRY  I heartily congratulate Lady Bab and all who are to partake of her conversation upon her being able to bring so much vivacity into the country  Lady BAB  Nothing but the Fête Champétre could have effected it for I set out in miserable spiritsI had a horrid run before I left townI suppose you saw my name in the papers  Sir HARRY  I did and therefore concluded there was not a word of truth in the report  MARIA  Your name in the papers Lady Bab for what pray  Lady BAB  The old storyit is a mark of insignificance now to be left out Have not they begun with you yet Maria  MARIA  Not that I know of and I am not at all ambitious of the honour  Lady BAB  Oh but you will have itthe Fête Champétre will be a delightful subjectTo be complimented one day laugh'd at the next and abused the third you can't imagine how amusing it is to read one's own name at breakfast in a morning paper  MARIA  Pray how long may your ladyship have been accustomed to this pleasure  Lady BAB  Lord a great while and in all its stages They first began with a modest inuendo "  we hear a certain Lady not a hundred miles from Hanoversquare lost at one sitting some nights ago two thousund guineas  O tempora O mores"  OLDWORTH  laughing  Pray Lady Bab is this concluding ejaculation your own or was it the Printer's  Lady BAB  His you may be sure a dab of Latin adds surprizing force to a paragraph besides shewing the learning of the author  OLDWORTH  Well but really I don't see such a great matter in this why should you suppose any body applied this paragraph to you  Lady BAB  None but my intimates did for it was applicable to half St George's parish but about a week after they honoured me with initials and italicks "It is said Lady B L's ill success still continues at the quinze table it was observed the same Lady appeared yesterday at court in a  ribband collier  having laid aside her  diamond  necklace diamond in italicks as totally bourgeoise and unnecessary for the dress of a woman of fashion"  OLDWORTH  To be sure this  was  advancing a little in  familiarity  Lady BAB  At last to my infinite amusement out I came at full length "  Lady Bab Lardoon has tumbled down  three nights successively a certain colonel has done the same and we hear that both parties keep house with sprained ancles  "  OLDWORTH  This last paragraph sounds a little enigmatical  MARIA  And do you really feel no resentment at all this  Lady BAB  Resentmentpoor silly devils if they did but know with what thorough contempt those of my circle treat a remonstrancebut hark I hear the pastoral's beginning  Music behind  Lord I hope I shall find a shepherd  OLDWORTH  The most elegant one in the world Mr Dupeley Sir Harry's friend  Lady BAB  You don't mean Charles Dupeley who has been so long abroad  Sir HARRY  The very same but I'm afraid he will never do he is but half a maccaroni  Lady BAB  And very possibly the worst half It is a vulgar idea to think foreign accomplishments fit a man for the polite world  Sir HARRY  Lady Bab I wish you would undertake him he seems to have contracted all the commonplace affectation of travel and thinks himself quite an  overmatch for the fair sex of whom his opinion is as ill founded as it is degrading  Lady BAB  O is that his turn what he has been studying some late posthumous letters I suppose'twould be a delight to make a fool of such a fellowwhere is he  Sir HARRY  He is only gone to dress I appointed to meet him on the other side the Grove he'll be here in twenty minutes  Lady BAB  I'll attend him there in your placeI have itI'll try my hand a little at  naivetè  he never saw methe dress I am going to put on for the Fête will do admirably to impose upon him I'll make an example of his hypocrisy and his  graces  and his  usage du monde  Sir HARRY  My life for it he will begin an acquaintance with you  Lady BAB  If he don't I'll begin with him There are two characters under which one may say any thing to a man that of perfect assurance and of perfect innocence Maria may be the best critick of the last but under the

 Yes he is looking out for us  Lady BAB  Step behind that stump of shrubs and you shall see what an excellent actress I should have made if fortune had not unluckily brought me into the world an Earl's daughter  OLDWORTH  Don't be too hasty for it is a pity Sir Harry should not be a witness he owes him vengeance too  Lady BAB  Away away  Exit Oldworth  Lady Bab retires to a corner of the stage  Enter DUPELEY  DUPELEY  Where the devil is Sir Harry this is certainly the place where I was appointed to find him but I suppose I shall spring him and his bride from under a rosebush by and by like two pheasants in pairingtime  observing Lady Bab  Hah I wish that was a piece of game she should not want a mate is that a dress now for the day or is she one of the natives of this extraordinary regionOh I see now it is all pure Arcadian her eyes have been used to nothing but daisy hunting they are as awkward to her when she looks at a man as her elbows would be in a French Berline  Lady BAB  aside  My spark does not seem to want observation he is only deficient in expression but I will help him to that presently Now to my character  settles herself  DUPELEY  aside  What a neck she has how beautifully nature works when she is not spoil'd by a damn'd town staymaker what a pity she is so awkward I hope she is not foolish  During this observation he keeps his eye fixed upon her neck Lady Bab looks first at him then at herself unpins her nosegay and with an air of the most perfect  naiveté  presents it to him  Lady BAB  You seem to wish for my nosegay Sir it is much at your service  Offers the flowers and curtseys awkward  DUPELEY  Oh the charming innocentmy wishes extend a little further A thousand thanks my fair one I accept it as a faint image of your own sweets To whom am I so much obliged  Lady BAB  To the gardenman to be sure he has made flowers grow all over the garden and they smell so sweet pray smell 'em they are charming sweet I assure you and have such fine colourslaw you are a fine nosegay yourself I think  simpers and looks at him  DUPELEY  Exquisite simplicity  half aside  sweet contrast to  fashionable affectationAh I knew at first glance you were a compound of innocence and sensibility  Lady BAB  Lackadazy heart how could you hit upon my temper so exactly  DUPELEY  By a certain instinct I have for I have seen few or none of the sort before but my dear girl what is your name and situation  Lady BAB  Situation  DUPELEY  Ay what are you  Lady BAB  I am a bride maid  DUPELEY  But my sweet image of simplicity when you are not a bride maid what

the delicious descriptionbeachen shades bleating flocks Pan pipes and pastorals  Aside  What an acquisition to my fame as well as pleasure to carry off this quintessence of Champétre'tis but an annuity jobI'll do it  During this soliloquy she examines him round and round  Lady BAB  And pray what may you be for I never  saw any thing so out of the way in all my lifehe he he  Simpering  DUPELEY  Be my dearI am a gentleman  Lady BAB  What a  fine  gentleman bless me what a thing it isthis is a fine gentlemanha ha ha I never saw any thing so comical in all my lifeha ha ha and this is a fine gentleman of which I have heard so much  DUPELEY  What is the matter my dear is there any thing ridiculous about me that makes you laugh What have you heard of fine gentlemen my sweet innocence  Lady BAB  That they are as gaudy as peacocks as mischievous as jays as chattering as magpies as wild as hawks  DUPELEY  And as loving as sparrowsmy beauteous Delia do not leave out the best property of the feathered creation  Lady BAB  No no I did not mean to leave out that I know you are very lovingof yourselves ha ha ha You are a sort of birds that  flock  but never  pair  DUPELEY  Why you are satirical my fairest and have you heard any thing else of fine gentlemen  Lady BAB  Yes a great deal moreThat they take wives for fortunes and mistresses for shew squander their money among taylors barbers cooks and fidlers  pawn their honour to sharpers and their estates to Jews and at last run to foreign countries to repair a pale face a flimzy carcase and an empty pocketthat's a fine gentleman for you  DUPELEY  Surprized  Heyday where has my Arcadian picked up this jumble  Lady BAB  I am afraid I have gone to far  Aside  DUPELEY  Still surprized  Pray my dear what is really your name  Lady BAB  Resuming her simplicity  My name is Philly  DUPELEY  Philly  Lady BAB  Philly Nettletop of the vale  DUPELEY  Still suspicious  And pray my sweet Philly where did you learn this character of a fine gentleman  Lady BAB  O I learnt it with my catechismMr Oldworth has it taught to all the young maidens here about  DUPELEY  Aside  O the gluttonhave I found at last the  clue  I'll be hang'd if old slyboots has not a rural seraglio and this is the favourite sultana  Lady BAB  Aside  I fancy I have put him upon a new scentwhy a real fool now would not have afforded half this diversion  DUPELEY  significantly  So it is from Mr Oldworth is it my charming  innocence  that you have learnt to be so much afraid of fine gentlemen  Lady BAB  No not at all afraid I believe you are perfectly harmless if one treats you right as I do our young mastiff at home  DUPELEY  And how is that pray  Lady BAB  Why while one keeps at a distance he frisks and he flies and he barks and tears and grumbles and makes a sad rout about itLord you'd think he would devour one at a mouthful but if one does but walk boldly up and look him in the face and ask him what he wants he drops his ears and runs away directly  DUPELEY  Well said rural simplicity againOh damn it I need not be so squeamish hereWell but my dear heavenly creature don't commit such a sin as to waste your youth and your charms upon a set of rusticks here fly with me to the true region of pleasuremy chaise and four shall be ready at the back gate of the park and we will take the opportunity when all the servants are drunk as they certainly will be and the company is gone tired to bed  Lady BAB  fondly  And would you really love me dearly now Saturdays and Sundays and all  DUPELEY  aside  Oh this will do without an annuity I see  Lady BAB  You'll forget all this prittleprattle gibberish to me now as soon as you see the fine strange ladies by and bythere's Lady Bab Larpoon I think they call her from London  DUPELEY  Lady Bab Lardoon indeedOh you have named a special object for a passionI should as soon be in love with the figure of the Great Mogul at the back of a pack of cardsIf  she  has any thing to do with  hearts  it must be when they are trumps and she pulls them out of her pocketNo sweet Philly thank heaven that gave me insight into the sex and reserv'd me for a woman in her native charmshere alone she is to be found and paradise is on her lips  struggling to kiss her  Thus let me thank you for my nosegay  During the struggle enter HURRY  HURRY  Oh Lady Bab I come to call your ladyship  pauses  Lord I thought they never kiss'd at a wedding till after the ceremony but they cannot begin too soonI ask pardon for interruption  going  Dupeley stares Lady Bab laughs  DUPELEY  Stay Hurry who was you looking for  HURRY  Why I came with a message for Lady Bab Larder and would have carried her answer but you stop'd her mouth  DUPELEY  Who what whoThis is Philly Nettletop  HURRY  Philly

he knows all women by instinct  Sir HARRY  From a Princess to a figurante from a vintage to a MaypoleI am rejoiced I came in time for the catastrophe  Lady BAB  Mr Oldworth there is your travell'd man for you and I think I have given a pretty good account of him  Pointing at Dupeley who is disconcerted  OLDWORTH  I hope the ladies are not the only characters in which Mr Dupeley has been mistaken  Lady BAB  Upon my word Mr Dupeley considering you have not been two hours in the house you have succeeded admirably to recommend yourself to your company why you look as if you had gone your  va toute  upon a false card  DUPELEY  The devil's in her I believe she overbears me so that I have not a word to say for myself  Lady BAB  Well tho' I laugh now I am sure I have most reason to be disconcerted for that blundering fellow spoiled my fortune  Sir HARRY  How so  Lady BAB  Why I should have had an annuity  OLDWORTH  Come come my good folks you have both acquitted yourselves admirably Mr Dupeley must forgive the innocent deceit and you Lady Bab like a generous conqueror should bear the triumph moderately  DUPELEY  I own myself her captive bound in her chains and thus I lay all my former laurels at her feet  Kneels  Lady BAB  The laurels have been mostly poeticalgathered in imagination only he he he  DUPELEY  Quarter quarter my dear invincible  Sir HARRY  Now this scene is finished

Sir Harry  Lady BAB  If she has sweetened that old Crab that his sourness will not set our teeth an edge she has work'd miracles indeed  Sir HARRY  There you totally mistake his character Lady Babnohe has the heart of an Oldworth  addressing himself to Mr Oldworth  Though I confess with very different manners his expression often puts me in mind of the harsh preparation of instruments  your ear is jarred before it is delightedbut attend to his sentiments and as Hamlet says  He will discourse most excellent Musick  He never said or did an illnatured thing in his life  Lady BAB  I wish I had him in town to contrast with some  smooth  successful characters of my acquaintance who will smile upon you even though you affront them and always flatter your judgement when they mean to pick your pocketbut here he is I declare and looks if he was quite in tune  Enter GROVEBY with MARIA under his arm  Sir HARRY  running to her  I was coming to seek you my Maria  GROVEBY  Your  Maria Sir my Maria  she  will own me if you won'tthere Sir let her teach you your duty  Quitting Maria who retires with Sir Harry to the bottom of the stage  OLDWORTH  Sir I have many pardons to ask of you but Sir

found your kindness paternal and you now give me the best proof of it  GROVEBY  No Sir had I been your father and you had surprised me with a match like this I should have taken another method  Sir HARRY  What would that have been my dear Uncle  GROVEBY  I would have loaded you with all the rents and you should have been forced to keep me at your own expence for the rest of my life Sirrah  Lady BAB  There is a sort of humour about this old fellow that is not unpleasant I must have a little laugh with her before the day is over  GROVEBY  Well Mr Oldworth I intend there shall be no more ceremony between us I shall not quit your Champétre I assure youbut what shall I do to equip myself one shall look like a fool it seems dressed in one's own cloaths  OLDWORTH  Sir your good humour and compliance will be a new compliment to the dayyou shall be supplied  I took care to be provided with plenty of habits for chance comers  GROVEBY  Why then this lady who looks like a merry one shall

conduct has made it a proud one  MARIA  How how SirI am lost in rapture and amazement  GROVEBY  So we are all  OLDWORTH  Excuse me brother Madam allmy story is very short Maria the hour of your birth made  me  a widower and  you  a splendid heiress I trembled at the dangers of that situation made more dangerous by the loss of your motherto be the object of flattery in the very cradle and made a prey to interest is the common lot attending itThese reflections call them whim call them singularities what you please induced me to conceal your birth being abroad at the time the plan was easily executed  MARIA  How blind have I been Benevolent as you are to all I might still have perceived and interpreted the distinction of your unremitting tendernesshow could I mistake the parent's partiality the parent's fondness  OLDWORTH  Your happiness has been the motive of my actions be it my excuseThe design has answered wonderfullyfor though Maria's virtues would have found their lustre under any tryal there would have wanted the humble station of the Maid of the Oaks to give her due proof of a disinterested lover  MARIA  O Sir expect not  words  where shall I find even  sentiments  of tenderness gratitude and duty that were not yours before  OLDWORTH  The life of my ward is a pledge for that of the daughter and the wifeTo you Sir Harry I shall make no apology for my secrecy it

you of a pleasure I know you also had your eye upon my Maid of the Oaks for an exercise of your generosity  GROVEBY  It is very true I should have been as well pleased as her lover to receive her only with an under petticoat though not quite for the same reasonbut you may perceive how cursedly vexed I am at the disappointment  pauses  Ay I must alter the disposition of my acres once moreI will have no Nabobs nor Nabobbesses in my family  Lady BAB  The females would be the better of the two for all that they would not be guilty of so much rapacity to acquire a fortune and they would spend it to better purposes  DUPELEY  By as much as a province is better disposed of in a jewel at the breast of a Cleopatra than when it is melted down in the fat guts of mayors and burgesses of country corporations  GROVEBY  I agree in your preference between the two but an honest country gentleman and a plain English wife is more respectable and useful than bothso do you hear Madam take care to

Druid of these Oaks long doom'd to dwell  Invisible 'till beauty broke the spell  Beauty which here erects her throne  And every spell dissolves except her own  Intended to be sung  Beauty breaks the magic spell  Her pow'r can ev'ry power subdue  Can charm the Druid from his cell  To revel and rejoice with you  What cannot beauty spotless beauty do  Stand all apart while mortals learn  The recompence their virtues earn  When thus the gen'rous court  their  power  Celestial guardians find the dower  And these are mansions they prepare  For the disint'rested and fair  He waves his wand  The Scene breaks away and discovers the PALACE OF CELESTIAL LOVE  MARIA take this oaken crown  The region round is all your own  See ev'ry Driad of the groves  With bending head salute your loves  And

rational systems of happiness than oursshou'd my fair instructress become a convert my ambition wou'd be still to follow her  Lady BAB  I am no convertmy mind has ever been on the side of reason though the torrent in which I have lived has not allowed me time to practice or even to contemplate it as I oughtbut to follow fashion where we feel shame is surely the strongest of all hypocrisy and from this moment I renounce it  GROVEBY  And you never made a better renounce in your life  Lady BAB  Lady Groveby accept the friendship of one sincerely desirous to imitate your virtuesMr Oldworth you do not know me yet you forbad your company masks upon their faces I have worn one upon my character to you and to the world  OLDWORTH  Lady Bab wanted but the resolution to appear in her genuine charms to make her a model to her rank and to the age  DUPELEY  To those charms I owe my conversionand my heart hitherto a prodigal justly fixes with her from whom it received the first impression of love and reasonThere wants but the hand of Lady Bab to make Oldworth's Oaks distinguished by another union founded on merit in her sex and discernment in mine  Lady BAB  Sir your proposal does me honour but it is time enough to talk of hearts and handsLet us follow the example before us in every thingafter the life we have led six months probation may be very proper for us both  OLDWORTH

our industry yields  CHORUS  Ye fine fangled folks c  No temple we raise to the idol of wealth  No alter to interest smokes  To the blessing of love kind seasons and health  Is devoted the Feast of the Oaks  CHORUS  No temple we raise c  SHEPHERDESS  From the thicket and plain each favourite haunt  The villagers hasten away  Your encouraging smile is the bounty they want  To compensate the toils of the day  CHORUS  From the thicket c  The milkmaid abandons her pail and her cow  In the furrow the plowman unyokes  From the valley and meadow all press to the brow  To assist at the Feast of the Oaks  CHORUS  The milk maid c  SHEPHERD  The precept we teach is contentment and truth  That our girls may not learn to beguile  By reason to govern the pleasures of youth  And decorate age with a smile  CHORUS  The precept we teach c  No serpent approaches with venemous tooth  No raven with ominous croaks  Nor rancorous critick more fatal than both  Shall poison the Feast of the Oaks  CHORUS  No serpent approaches c  SHEPHERDESS  Bring roses and myrtles new circlets to weave  Ply the flutes in new measures to move  And lengthen the song to the star of the eve  The favouring planet of love  CHORUS  Bring roses and myrtles c  Oh Venus propitious attend to the lay  Each shepherd the blessing invokes  May he who is true like the youth of today  Find a prize like the Maid of the Oaks  CHORUS  Oh Venus propitious c  DRUID  Stopping the Musicians  Yet holdthough Druid now no more  He's wrong who thinks my spells are o'er  Thus midst you all I throw them round  Oh may they fall on genial ground  May ev'ry breast their influence prove  The magic lies in  truth of Love  'Tis that irradiates ev'ry scene  Restores from clouds the blue serene  And makes without a regal dome  A palace of each humble home  Exeunt  The Whole finishes with A GRAND DANCE  FINIS
