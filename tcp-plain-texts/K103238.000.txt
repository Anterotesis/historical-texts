 CALCULATIONS TO DETERMINE AT WHAT POINT IN THE SIDE OF A HILL ITS ATTRACTION WILL BE THE GREATEST c  BY CHARLES HUTTON LL D AND F R S  Read at the ROYAL SOCIETY Nov  LONDON Printed by J NICHOLS Successor to Mr BOWYER  M DCC LXXX  CALCULATIONS c  TO NEVIL MASKELYNE D D F R S AND ASTRONOMER ROYAL  Royal Military Acad  Sept  DEAR SIR  AS the experiment of determining the universal at∣traction of matter which you lately conducted with so much accuracy and success is of so great im∣portance and curiosity that it may probably be here∣after repeated by the learned in other countries and in other situations and as the utmost precision is desirable  in so nice an experiment I have composed the inclosed paper to determine the best part of a hill for making the observations so as to obtain the greatest quantity of attraction  I have no doubt Sir that the determination of this point will appear of some consequence in the opinion of one who has the improvement of useful knowledge so much at heart and if the manner in which it is here made meet your approbation I shall desire the favour of your presenting it to the Royal Society  I have the honour to be c  The great success of the experiment lately made by the Royal Society on the hill Schehallien to deter∣mine the universal attraction of matter and the im∣portant consequences that have resulted from it may probably give occasion to other experiments of the same kind to be made elsewhere and as all possible means of accuracy and facility are to be desired in so delicate and laborious an undertaking it has occurred to me that it might not be unuseful to add by way of sup∣plement to my paper of calculations relative to the a∣bovementioned experiment an investigation of the height above the bottom of a hill at which its horizon∣tal attraction shall be the greatest since that is the height at which commonly the observations ought to be made and since this best point of observation has never been any where determined that I know of but has been va∣riously spoken of or guessed at it being sometimes ac∣counted at ⅓ and sometimes at ½ of the height of the hill whereas from these investigations it is found to be generally at about only ¼ of the altitude from the bottom  Let ABCEDA be part of a cuneus of matter its sides or faces being the two similar rightangled trian∣gles ABC ADE meeting in the point A and forming the indefinitely small angle BAD Then of any section  bced perpendicular to the planes ABD and ADE the attraction on a body at A in the direction AB is equal to the constant quantity s  s  where s = sin ›BAC and  s  = sin ›BAD to the ra∣dius  diagram  For first since the magnitude of the flowing sec∣tion is every where as A  b    and the attraction of the particles of matter inversely as the same or as A  b    therefore their product or A  b    A  b    or a constant quantity is as the force of attraction of bced  Then to find what that quantity is Put AB =  a  and BC =  x  then BD or CE the distance between the two planes at the distance AB is =  as  Now the force of a particle in the line CE is as AC    in the direction AC and therefore it is as AB AC    in the direction AB consequently the force of the whole lineola CE in the direction AB is ABCE AC    and therefore the fluxion of the force of the section BCED or  ḟ  is  and the fluent gives  for the attraction itself  To find now the attraction of the whole rightangled cuneus on a body at A in the direction AB Since the force of each section is s  s  by the last article therefore the force of all the sections the number of them being AB or  a  is  as  s =  s  AB BC AC the force of the whole cuneus ABCEDA  diagram  To find the attraction of the rect∣angular part ABCD on A in the direction AB ABCD being one side of the cune∣us and AD its edgePut AD = BC =  b  and AB =  x  Then the force of any section as BC being always as s  s  by Art the fluxion of the force or  ḟ  will be  and the fluent is  the attraction of ABCD  diagram  To find the attraction of the rightangled part BCD of a cuneus whose edge passes through A the place of the body attractedPut AB =  a  BC =  b  BD =  c  DA =  d  =  a    c  DC =  e  AC =  g  and DP =  x  Then the force of any section PQ being still as s  s  the fluxion of the force of the part DPQ is  and the correct fluent  when  x  =  c  is  the force of a body at A in the direction AB  diagram  To find the attraction of the rightangled part BCD on the point AUsing here again the same notation as in the last article we have  The correct fluent of which when  x  =  c  is    To apply now these premises to the finding of the place where the attraction of a hill is greatest it will be necessary to suppose the hill to have some certain fi∣gure That position is most convenient for observing the attraction in which the hill is most extended in the east and west direction Supposing then such a position of a hill and that it is also of a uniform height and meridional section throughout the point of observa∣tion must evidently be equally distant from the two ends But instead of being only considerably extended I shall suppose the hill to be indefinitely extended to the east and to the west of the point of observation in order that the investigation may be mathematically true and yet at the same time sufficiently exact for the beforesaid limited extent also It will also come nearest to the  practical experiment to suppose the hill to be a long triangular prism so that all its meridional sections may be similar triangles Let therefore the triangle ABC re∣present its section by a verti∣cal plane passing through the meridian or one side of an indefinitely thin cuneus whose edge is in PG or rather PBCGP the side of one cuneus and PAG the side of another their common edge being the line PG perpendicular to the base AC P being the required point in the side AB where the attrac∣tion of the section ABC  indefinitely thin cuneus shall be greatest in a direction parallel to the horizon AC And then from the foregoing suppositions it is evident that in whatever point of AB the attraction of ABC is greatest there also will the attraction of the whole hill be the greatest  diagram  Now draw HPDEF parallel to AC and AH PG BI CF perpendicular to the same Then it is evident that at the point P in the direction PF the attraction of PBCGP is affirmative and that of PAG negative But PBCGP is = PBD + BDE + PFCG EFC and PAG = PHAG PHA Therefore the attractions of PBD BDE PFCG PHA are affirmative and those of EFC PHAG negative  Put now BI =  a  AI =  b  IC =  c  AB =  d  BC =  e  AC =  g  =  b  +  c  and PG =  x  the altitude of the point P above the bottom Also let  s  = the sine of the indefinitely small angle of the cuneus to rad and    Then by Art the attraction  of PBD is  s  PD BD BP =  sb  ×  a    x    d  of PHA is  s  PH PG PA =  sb  ×  x    d  By Art the attraction  PFCG is  s  PG × h l PF+PC PG =  sx  × h l  ag    bx  +  qq    ax  PGAH is  s  PG × h l PH+PA PG =  sx  × h l  b  +  d    a  By Art the attraction of EFC is    Lastly by Art the attraction of BDE is    These quantities being collected together with their proper signs and contracted we have  for the whole attraction in the direction PE  Having now obtained a general formula for the measure of the attraction in any sort of triangle if the particular values of the letters be substituted which any practical case may require and the fluxion of this at∣traction be put = the root of the resulting equation will be the required height from the bottom of the hill  But for a more particular solution in simpler terms let us suppose the triangle ABC to be isosceles in which case we shall have  d  =  e  and  g  =  b  =  c  and then the above general formula will become  for the value of the attraction in the case of the isos∣celes triangle where  q    is  And the fluxion of this expression being equated to the equation will give the relation between  a  and  x  for any values of  b  and  d  by a process not very trouble∣some  Now it is probable that the relation between  a  and  x  when the attraction is greatest will vary with the various relations between  b  and  d  or between  b  and  a  Let us therefore find the limits of that relation between which it may always be taken by using two particular extreme cases the one in which the hill is  very steep and the other in which it is very flat or  a  very small in respect of  b  or  d  And first let us suppose the triangular section to be equilateral in which case the angle of elevation is ° which being a degree of steepness that can scarce∣ly ever happen this may be accounted the first extreme case Here then we shall have  d  =  b  = ⅔  a  √ and the formula in Art will become  s  ×  a    r    x  +  x  × h l  a  +  r    x    x  +  a    x  × h l  a  +  r  +  x    a    x  for the value of the attraction in the case of the equilateral triangle in which  r  is    Or if we take  x  =  na  where  n  expresses what part of  a  is denoted by  x  the last formula will become  for the case of the equila∣teral triangle  To find the maximum of the expression in the last article put its fluxion = and there will result this equation  the root of which is  n  = Which shews that in the equilateral triangle the height from the bottom to the point of greatest attraction is  only  th  part more than ¼ of the whole altitude of the triangle And this is the limit for the steepest kind of hills  Let us find now the particular values of the mea∣sure of attraction arising by taking certain values of  n  varying by some small difference in order to discover what part of the greatest attraction is wanting by ob∣serving at different altitudes  And first using the value of  n  as found in the  th  article the general formula in Art gives  sa  × for the measure of the greatest at∣traction  If  n  = or  x  =  a  the same formula gives  sa  × √ + h l +√ + h l +√ =  sa  × for the attraction at of the altitude which is something less than the other  If  n  = = ⅖ the formula gives  sa  × √ + h l +√ + h l +√ =  sa  × for the attraction at or ⅖ of the altitude less again than the last was  If  n  = = ½ the formula gives  for the attraction at half way up the hill still less again than the last  If  n  = = ⅗ the formula gives  sa  × √ + h l +√ + h l +√ =  sa  × for the attraction at or ⅗ of the altitude from the bottom being still less than the last was And thus the quantity of attraction is continually less and less the higher we ascend up the hill above the part or in round numbers part of the altitude Let us now descend by trying the numbers below and first  If  n  = = ¼ the same formula in Art gives ⅛  sa  × √ + h l +√ + h l +√ =  sa  × for the attraction at ¼ of the altitude and is very little less than the maximum  If  n  = = ⅕ the formula gives  sa  × √ + h l +√ + hl +√ =  sa  × √ + h l +√ =  sa  × for the attraction at or ⅕ of the altitude and is something less than at ¼ of the altitude  If  n  = the formula gives  sa  × √ + hl +√ + h l +√ =  sa  × for the attraction at of the altitude still less than the last was And lastly  If  n  = or the point be at the bottom of the  hill the formula gives  for the attraction at the bottom of the hill which is between ⅔ and ¾ of the greatest attraction being some∣thing greater than ⅔ but less than ¾ of it  The annexed table exhibits a summary of the      ¼                          ¼                        calculations made in the preceding articles where the first column shews at what part of the altitude of the hill the observation is made the second column contains the corresponding numbers which are proportional to the attraction and the third column shews what part of the greatest attraction is lost at each respective place of observation or how much each is less than the greatest  Having now so fully illustrated the case of the first extreme or limit let us search what is the limit for the other extreme that is when the hill is very low or flat In this case  b  is nearly equal to  d  and they are both very great in respect of  a  consequently the for∣mula for the attraction in Art will become barely  the fluxion of which being put = we obtain  hence therefore  and    Which shews that the other limit is that is when the hill is extremely low the point of great∣est attraction is at of the altitude like as it is at when the hill is very steep And between these limits it is always found it being nearer to the one or the other of them as the hill is flatter or steeper  Thus then we find that at ¼ of the altitude or very little more is the best place for observation to have the greatest attraction from a hill in the form of a tri∣angular prism of an indefinite length But when its length is limited the point of greatest attraction will descend a little lower and the shorter the hill is the lower will that point descend For the same reason all pyramidal hills have their place of greatest attraction a little below that above determined But if the hill have a considerable space flat at the top after the manner of a frustum then the said point will be a little higher than as above found Commonly however ¼ of the altitude may be used for the best place of observation as the point of greatest attraction will seldom differ sensibly from that place And when uncommon circumstances may produce a difference too great to be intirely neglect∣ed the observer must exercise his judgment in guessing at the necessary change he ought to make in the place of observation so as to obtain the best effect which the concomitant circumstances will admit of
