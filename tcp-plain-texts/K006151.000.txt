 ODES BY Mr GRAY Author of an Elegy in a Country ChurchYard  ΦΩΝΑΝΤΑ ΣΥΝΕΤΟΙΣΙ  PINDAR Olymp II  DUBLIN  Printed for G FAULKNER in  Essexstreet  and J RUDD at the  Apollo  in  DameStreet  MDCCLVII  ODE  I  AWAKE Aeolian lyre awake  And give to rapture all thy trembling strings  From Helicon's harmonious springs  A thousand rills their mazy progress take  The laughing flowers that round them blow  Drink life and fragrance as they flow  Now the rich stream of musick winds along  Deep majestic smooth and strong  Thro' verdant vales and Ceres' golden reign  Now rowling down the steep amain  Headlong impetuous see it pour  The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar  I  Oh Sovereign of the willing soul  Parent of sweet and solemnbreathing airs  Enchanting shell the sullen Cares  And frantic Passions hear thy soft controul  On Thracia's hills the Lord of War  Has curb'd the fury of his car  And drop'd his thirsty lance at thy command  Perching on the scept'red hand  Of Jove thy magic lulls the feather'd king  With ruffled Plumes and flagging wing  Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber lie  The terror of his beak and light'nings of his eye  I  Thee the voice the dance obey  Temper'd to thy warbled lay  O'er Idalia's velvetgreen  The rosycrowned Loves are seen  On Cytherea's day  With antic Sports and blueey'd Pleasures  Frisking light in frolic measures  Now pursuing now retreating  Now in circling troops they meet  To brisk notes in cadence beating  Glance their manytwinkling feet  Slow melting strains their Queen's approach declare  Where'er she turns the Graces homage pay  With arms sublime that float upon the air  In gliding state she wins her easy way  O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom move  The bloom of young Desire and purple light of Love  II  Man's feeble race what Ills await  Labour and Penury the racks of Pain  Disease and Sorrow's weeping train  And Death sad refuge from the storms of Fate  The fond complaint my Song disprove  And justify the laws of Jove  Say has he giv'n in vain the heav'nly Muse  Night and all her sickly dews  Her Spectres wan and Birds of boding cry  He gives to range the dreary sky  Till down the eastern cliffs afar  Hyperion's march they spy and glitt'ring shafts of war  II  In climes beyond the solar road  Where shaggy forms o'er icebuilt mountains roam  The Muse has broke the twilightgloom  To chear the shiv'ring Natives dull abode  And oft beneath the od'rous shade  Of Chili's boundless forests laid  She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat  In loose numbers wildly sweet  Their feathercinctured Chiefs and dusky Loves  Her track where'er the Goddess roves  Glory pursue and generous Shame  Th' unconquerable Mind and Freedom's holy flame  II  Woods that wave o'er Delphi's steep  Isles that crown th' Egaean deep  Fields that cool Ilissus laves  Or where Maeander's amber waves  In lingering Lab'rinths creep  How do your tuneful Echo's lanquish  Mute but to the voice of Anguish  Where each old poetic Mountain  Inspiration breath'd around  Ev'ry shade and hallow'd Fountain  Murmur'd deep a solemn sound  Till the sad Nine in Greece's evil hour  Left their Parnassus for the Latian plains  Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrantPower  And coward Vice that revels in her chains  When Latium had her lofty spirit lost  They sought oh Albion next thy seaencircled coast  III  Far from the sun and summergale  In thy green lap was Nature's Darling laid  What time where lucid Avon stray'd  To him the mighty Mother did unveil  Her awful face The dauntless Child  Stretch'd forth his little arms and smiled  This pencil take she said whose colours clear  Richly paint the vernal year  Thine too these golden keys immortal Boy  This can unlock the gates of Joy  Of Horrour that and thrilling Fears  Or ope the sacred source of sympathetic Tears  III  Nor second He that rode sublime  Upon the seraphwings of Extasy  The secrets of th' Abyss to spy  He pass'd the flaming bounds of Place and Time  The living Throne the saphireblaze  Where Angels tremble while they gaze  He saw but blasted with excess of light  Closed his eyes in endless night  Behold where Dryden's less presumptuous car  Wide o'er the fields of Glory bear  Two Coursers of ethereal race  With necks in thunder cloath'd and longresounding pace  III  Hark his hands the lyre explore  Brighteyed Fancy hovering o'er  Scatters from her pictur'd urn  Thoughts that breath and words that burn  But ah 'tis heard no more  Oh Lyre divine what daring Spirit  Wakes thee now tho' he inherit  Nor the pride nor ample pinion  That the Theban Eagle bear  Sailing with supreme dominion  'Thro' the azure deep of air  Yet oft before his infant eyes would run  Such forms as glitter in the Muse's ray  With orient hues unborrow'd of the Sun  Yet shall he mount and keep his distant way  Beyond the limits of a vulgar fate  Beneath the Good how farbut far above the Great  THE following Ode is founded on a Tradition current in Wales that  EDWARD THE FIRST  when he compleated the conquest of that country ordered all the Bards that fell into his hands to be put to death  ODE II  I  'RUIN seize thee ruthless King  'Confusion on thy banners wait  'Tho' fann'd by Conquest's crimson wing  'They mock the air with idle state  'Helm nor Hauberk's twisted mail  'Nor even thy virtues Tyrant shall avail  'To save thy secret soul from nightly fears  'From Cambria's curse from Cambria's tears'  Such were the sounds that o'er the crested pride  Of the first Edward scatter'd wild dismay  As down the steep of Snowdon's shaggy side  He wound with toilsome march his long array  Stout Gloster stood aghast in speechless trance  To arms cried Mortimer and couch'd his quiv'ring lance  I  On a rock whose haughty brow  Frowns o'er old Conway's foaming flood  Robed in the sable garb of woe  With haggard eyes the Poet stood  Loose his beard and hoary hair  Stream'd like a meteor to the troubled air  And with a Master's hand and Prophet's fire  Struck the deep sorrows of his lyre  'Hark how each giantoak and desert cave  'Sighs to the torrent's aweful voice beneath  'O'er thee oh King their hundred arms they wave  'Revenge on thee in hoarser murmurs breath  'Vocal no more since Cambria's fatal day  'To highborn Hoel's harp or soft Llewellyn's lay  I  'Cold is Cadwallo's tongue  'That hush'd the stormy main  'Brave Urien sleeps upon his craggy bed  'Mountains ye mourn in vain  'Modred whose magic song  'Made huge Plinlimmon bow his cloudtop'd head  'On dreary Arvon's shore they lie  'Smear'd with gore and ghastly pale  'Far far aloof th' affrighted ravens sail  'The famish'd Eagle screams and passes by  'Dear lost companions of my tuneful art  'Dear as the light that visits these sad eyes  'Dear as the ruddy drops that warm my heart  'Ye died amidst your dying country's cries  'No more I weep They do not sleep  'On yonder cliffs a griesly band  'I see them sit they linger yet  'Avengers of their native land  'With me in dreadful harmony they join  'And weave with bloody hands the tissue of thy line  II  "Weave the warp and weave the woof  "The windingsheet of Edward's race  "Give ample room and verge enough  "The characters of hell to trace  "Mark the year and mark the night  "When Severn shall reeccho with affright  "The shrieks of death thro' Berkley's roofs that ring  "Shrieks of an agonizing King  "SheWolf of France with unrelenting fangs  "That tear'st the bowels of thy mangled Mate  "From thee be born who o'er thy country hangs  "The scourge of Heav'n What Terrors round him wait  "Amazement in his van with Flight combined  "And sorrow's faded form and solitude behind  II  "Mighty Victor mighty Lord  "Low on his funeral couch he lies  "No pitying heart no eye afford  "A tear to grace his obsequies  "Is the sable Warriour fled  "Thy son is gone He rests among the Dead  "The Swarm that in thy noontide beam were born  "Gone to salute the rising Morn  "Fair laughs the Morn and soft the Zephyr blows  "While proudly riding o'er the azure realm  "In gallant trim the gilded Vessel goes  "Youth on the prow and Pleasure at the helm  "Regardless of the sweeping Whirlwind's sway  "That hush'd in grim repose expects his eveningprey  II  "  Richard the Second as we are told by Archbishop Scroop Thomas of Walsingham and all the older Writers was starved to death The story of his assassination by Sir Piers of Exon is of much later date  Fill high the sparkling bowl  "The rich repast prepare  "Reft of a crown he yet may share the feast  "Close by the regal chair  "Fell Thirst and Famine scowl  "A baleful smile upon their baffled Guest  "Heard ye the din of battle bray  "Lance to lance and horse to horse  "Long years of havock urge their destined course  "And thro' the kindred squadrons mow their way  "Ye Towers of Julius London's lasting shame  "With many a foul and midnight murther fed  "Revere his Consort's faith his Father's fame  "And spare the meek Usurper's holy head  "Above below the rose of snow  "Twined with her blushing foe we spread  "The bristled Boar in infantgore  "Wallows beneath the thorny shade  "Now Brothers bending o'er th' accursed loom  "Stamp we our vengeance deep and ratify his doom  III  "Edward lo to sudden fate  "Weave we the woof The thread is spun  "  Eleanor of Castile died a few years after the conquest of Wales The heroic proof she gave of her affection for her Lord is well known The monuments of his regret and sorrow sor the loss of her are still to be seen in several parts of England  Half of thy heart we consecrate  "The web is wove The work is done  'Stay oh stay nor thus forlorn  'Leave me unblessed unpitied here to mourn  'In yon bright track that fires the western skies  'They melt they vanish from my eyes  'But oh what solemn scenes on Snowdon's height  'Descending slow their glitt'ring skirts unroll  'Visions of glory spare my aching sight  'Ye unborn Ages crowd not on my soul  'No more our longlost Arthur we bewail  'Allhail  Accession of the Line of Tudor  ye genuine Kings Britannia's Issue hail  III  'Girt with many a Baron bold  'Sublime their starry fronts they rear  'And gorgeous Dames and Statesmen old  'In bearded majesty appear  'In the midst a Form divine  'Her eye proclaims her of the BritonLine  'Her lyonport her awecommanding face  'Attemper'd sweet to virgingrace  'What strings symphonious tremble in the air  'What strains of vocal transport round her play  'Hear from the grave great Taliessin  Taliessin Chief of the Bards flourish'd in the VIth Century His works are still preserved and his memory held in high veneration among his Countrymen  hear  'They breath a soul to animate thy clay  'Bright Rapture calls and soaring as she sings  'Waves in the eye of Heav'n her manycolour'd wings  III  'The verse adorn again  'Fierce War and faithful Love  'And Truth severe by fairy Fiction drest  'In buskin'd measures move  'Pale Grief and pleasing Pain  'With Horrour Tyrant of the throbbing breast  'A Voice as of the CherubChoir  'Gales from blooming Eden bear  'And distant warblings lessen on my ear  'That lost in long futurity expire  'Fond impious Man think'st thou yon sanguine cloud  'Rais'd by thy breath has quench'd the Orb of day  'Tomorrow he repairs the golden flood  'And warms the nations with redoubled ray  'Enough for me With joy I see  'The different doom our Fates assign  'Be thine Despair and scept'red Care  'To triumph and to die are mine'  He spoke and headlong from the mountain's height  Deep in the roaring tide he plung'd to endless night  FINIS
