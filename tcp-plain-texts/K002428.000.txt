 THE LIFE OF THE Lady  JANE GRAY  WITH SOME REMARKS ON THE PLAY In a LETTER to a FRIEND  By  William Rufus Chetwood  DUBLIN  Printed for  G Risk  Bookseller at the  London  in  Damesstreet  overagainst the  HorseGuard  where New Plays and Novels are to be Sold And the Tragedy of  Jane Grey    THE LIFE OF THE Lady  JANE GRAY c  SIR  YOU desired me to send you the Life of the Lady  Jane Gray  I do assure you my Friend and hope to be believ'd that I spent a whole Day in the search and to as little purpose as he that carry'd a lighted Torch at Noonday to look for an honest Man But however you shan't altogether lose your Longing For you may if you please read this following Account Collected out of the best and most exactest Historians  THis Incomparable Lady was Eldest Daughter to  Henry  Lord  Grey  Duke of  Suffolk  She was born in the Year She was Endow'd with all the Graces both of Mind and Body She gave in her earliest Infancy many Proofs of her growing Piety and her Veneration for Holy Writ For once being diverting herself with her Companions one had an occasion to have something that was above her reach and taking a large Bible to tread on to get it the young Lady seeing her wou'd not suffer her and exprest her Resentment She was so taken with it that she broke off their sport and retir'd to her Closet more than ordinary Melancholly  She was a Lady indeed that seem'd cut out by Heaven for Greatness As She was a Beautiful and a Graceful Person so  she was Endow'd with all those Virtues that are esteem'd by Heaven and all good Men as is express'd in the Tragedy of her by the Poet  Candour with Goodness Fortitude with Sweetness  Strict Piety and love of Truth with Learning  More than the Schools of  Athens  ever knew  Or her own  Plato  taught  When she came to years of more solid Understanding Dr  Elmer  afterwards Bishop of  London  was her Tutor And from him she learn'd Latin and Greek to a Perfection and wou'd Discourse in those Language upon any Subject and wou'd give her Sentiments to Admiration Nay she delighted in such Conferences For when others of her Sex and Age were taking their Diversion abroad she employ'd her time in Reading The Lady  Elizabeth  's Tutor  Roger Ascham  coming once to wait on her at her Father's House in the Country was surpriz'd to find her alone reading of  Plato  's Works in Greek while the rest of the Family were diverting themselves with Hunting in her Father's Park and other Rural Diversions He ask'd her how she could lose the share of such Diversion She answer'd Those were but faint Shadows of what she enjoy'd in Contemplation there  pointing to  Plato's Phoedon  that lay before her  And added she I esteem it one of the greatest Blessings of my Life that I have had severe Parents and a Milder Master which have made me delight with those Companions which were not like Mankind for when I find my self weary I can lay by their Company without commiting a Soliecism against good Manners  The young King was ever fond of her Company and as their Ages were much the same so was their Fancies and Desires As the Poet has it  From their first early Days of Infant Life  A gentle Band of Friendship grew betwixt 'em  As Brother and as Sister bred together  Beneath one Common Parents Care they liv'd  In every Innocent Delight they shar'd  They Sung and Danc'd and Sat and Walk'd together  She left the shining Courts to share his Toil  To turn with him the Grave Historian's Page  And taste the Rapture of the Poets Song  She was well read in Sacred as well as Prophane History and had attain'd to a large Knowledge in Divinity And at the Age when others were but tasting the Notions of Philosophy she had Capacity enough to make a full Feast And with all these Advantages of Birth and Parts she was so Humble so Meek and Pious that all People both Admir'd and Lov'd her She had a Mind wonderfully rais'd above the World and the Pleasures of it she call'd Vanities  Lord  Guilford  Son to the Aspiring Duke of  Northumberland  by his Father's Politick means was Marry'd to her on the Third of  June  and as well as I can make out in the Twentieth Year of her Age She exprest all the sorrow imaginable at the King's Death and in his Sickness gave him most constant Attendance which is finely exprest in the Poets Lines by  Northumberland  on the occasion  All desolate and drown'd in flowing Tears  By  Edward  's Bed the Pious Princes sits  Fast from her lifted Eyes the pearly Drops  Fall trickling o'er her Cheek while strong Devotion  And fervent Zeal pour forth her lab'ring Soul  And every sigh is wing'd with Prayers so potent  As strive with Heaven to save her dying Lord  When her Father the Duke of  Northumberland  with the rest of the Privy Council came to attend and hail her Queen she exprest a great deal of Reluctancy and was rather forc'd to take it out of an Obedience to her Parents than any desire of her own She said the Crown by Right of Inheritance was to descend to the Sisters of the late King and that she was unwilling to burden her Conscience to enrich herself with the spoils of others At last for the Safety of the People and the Maintaining and Preserving the Reformation she was won upon to accept the Crown The Author of the Tragedy of Lady  Jane  has exprest her unwillingness in this manner  Take me Crown me  Invest me with this Royal Wretchedness  Let me not know one happy Minute more  Let all my sleepless Nights be spent in Care  My Days be vex'd with Tumults and Alarms  If only I can save you if my Fate  Has mark'd me out to be the Publick Victim  I take the Lot with JoyYes I will Die  For that Eternal Truth my Faith is fix'd on  And that dear Native Land which gave me Birth  All that I ask is tho' my Fortune frown  And bury me beneath this Fatal Crown  Let this one good be added to my Doom  To save this Land from Tyranny and  Rome  She was neither lifted up when she wore the Crown nor cast down when her Palace became her Prison but carry'd herself in an even Temper of Mind in those great inequalities of Fortune that so suddenly exalted and depress'd her All the Passion she exprest was that her Father Mother and Husband were involv'd in her ill Fortune When she had notice that her Sentence of Death was past she did not express the least concern but bore it with a Constancy of Mind beyond thought The Queen sent Dr  Fecknam  Three Days before to prepare her for Death He had a long Conversation with her and answer'd to all his Questions with that calmness of Mind and clearness of Reason that it was a Wonder to hear how so Young a Person of her Sex cou'd look on Death so nigh her with so little concern She sent a Letter to her Father to mitigate his Sorrow for her Unhappy End She rejoyced at aproaching Death and thought the nigher it appear'd it look'd less dreadful She exprest a great deal of tenderness when she saw her Husband led out first to Execution He had desir'd to take leave of her before he dy'd but she declin'd it since she said it wou'd rather be an Addition to her Grief And she hop'd to meet shortly and be united in a much happier State She saw her Husband's Headless Trunk carry'd by her without any outward concern or Woman's Wailings and consol'd herself in knowing she shou'd soon follow him When she was brought to the Scaffold which for fear of the People was built within the Tower she confest she had Sin'd in taking the Crown when it was proffer'd her but she took it to a good end She declar'd she dy d a true Christian in the reform'd Faith but hoped to be sav'd only thro the Merits and Sufferings of her Blessed Lord and and Saviour Jesus Christ Then having desir'd the Peoples Prayers she repeated the st  Psam  when after some private Devotion she undress'd herself put her Hankerchief herself upon her Eyes then laying her Head upon the fatal Block she resign'd her Breath to him who gave it her  Thus fell this Great this Good and Pious Lady which seem'd by Virtue to be form'd for Greatness which may be as an Example to the World of the Mutability of Fortune And I think our Poet has been very exact in his Characters in following the truth of History Nothing can Describe the Haughty Ambitious  Northumberland  better than himself in the following Lines where he seems to have laid the Scheme of his designs even before the King's Death  She must be here and lodg'd in  Guilford  's Arms  E're  Edward  Dyes or all we have done is Marr'd  Ha  Pembroke  that's a Bar that thwarts my way  His fiery Temper brooks not opposition  And must be met with soft and subtile Arts  With crouching Courtesie and Hony'd Words  Such as Asswage the fierce and bend the Strong  See  Baker  's Chronicle in giving an account of  Northumberland  Marching with his Troops out of  London  The th of  July  he March'd thro'  Shoreditch  with Horse and Foot and tho' there were many Spectators in the Streets as he pass'd none wish'd him Success Now judge how high the Poet comes where he makes  Pembroke  a Spectator  I saw him Marching at his Army's Head  I mark'd him Issuing thro' the City Gates  And for he wore his Beaver up cou'd read  Upon his Visage Horror and Dismay  No Voice of friendly Salutation cheer'd him  None wish'd his Arms might thrive or bad Heaven speed him  But thro' a Staring ghastly looking Croud  Unhail'd Unblest with heavy Heart he went  The Duke of  Northumberland  went back to  Cambridge  to wait for more Succours from  London  but hearing how Matters were carry'd he dismist his Troops and went to the Marketplace only Accompanied with the Mayor and himself for want of a Herald flung up his Cap for Joy and cry'd God Save Queen  Mary  But the Earl of  Arundel  came with orders from the Queen to apprehend him as one guilty of Treason and brought him from  Cambridge  to the Tower on the th of  July  and on the d of  August  was Beheaded This passage is describ'd by the Duke of  Suffolk  to his Daughter the Lady  Jane  With some sew Followers he arriv'd at  Cambridge  But there even they forsook him and himself  Was forc'd with heavy Heart and watry Eye  To cast his Cap up with dissembled Chear  And cry God save Queen  Mary  But alass  Little avail'd the Semblance of that Loyalty  For soon thereafter by the Earl of  Arundel  With Treason was he charg'd and there Arrested  And now they bring him Prisoner up to  London  I must confess in my Judgment there is a great many fine thoughts in this Play but I leave 'em to yours only I must beg leave to point you out one and so conclude for I reckon by this time you're as tir'd with Reading as I with Writing  It is in the Conclusion of the th Act where  Guilford  is bewailing the Loss of each other in Death But she endeavours to comfort him by telling him they shall meet again  Behold the Universal Works of Nature  Where Life still Springs from Death To us the Sun  Dies every Night and every Morn revives  The Flow'rs which Winter's Icy Head destroy'd  Lift their fair Heads and live agen in Spring  Mark with what Hopes upon the furrow'd Plain  The Careful Ploughman casts the pregnant Grain▪  There hid as in a Grave a while it lies  Till the revolving Season bids it rise  Till Natures Genial Pow'rs Command a Birth  And potent call it from the teeming Earth  Then large increase the buried Treasures yeild  And with full Harvest Crown the plenteous Field  I shall trouble you no farther and I shall think my Pains amply required if this Succinct but true Account can give any satisfaction to the entire Frend of▪  Sir  Your Humble Servant W R C  FINIS
