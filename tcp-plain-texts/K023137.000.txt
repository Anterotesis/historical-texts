by POISON On the Body of Mr  Edm Curll  c  HISTORY furnishes us with Examples of many Satyrical Authors who have fallen Sacrifices to Revenge but not of any Booksellers that I know of except the unfortunate Subject of the following Papers I mean Mr  Edmund Curll  at the  Bible  and  Dial  in  Fleetstreet  who was Yesterday poison'd by Mr  Pope  after having liv'd many Years an Instance of the mild Temper of the  British  Nation  Every Body knows that the said Mr  Edmund Curll  on Monday the th Instant publish'd a Satyrical Piece entituled  Court Poems  in the Preface whereof they were attributed to a  Lady of Quality  Mr  Pope  or Mr  Gay  by which indiscreet Method though he had escaped one Revenge there were still two behind in reserve  Now on the Wednesday ensuing between the Hours of and Mr  Lintott  a neighb'ring Bookseller desir'd a Conference with Mr  Curll  about settling the  Title Page  of  Wiquefort  's  Ambassador  inviting him at the same Time to take a Whet together Mr  Pope  who is not the only Instance how Persons of bright Parts may be carry'd away by the Instigations of the Devil found Means to convey himself into the same Room under pretence of Business with Mr  Lintott  who it  seems is the Printer of his  Homer  This Gentleman with a seeming Coolness reprimanded Mr  Curll  for wrongfully ascribing to him the aforesaid Poems He excused himself by declaring that one of his Authors Mr  Oldmixon  by Name gave the Copies to the Press and wrote the  Preface  Upon this Mr  Pope  being to all appearance reconcil'd very civilly drank a Glass of Sack to Mr  Curll  which he as civilly pledged and tho' the Liquor in Colour and Taste differ'd not from common Sack yet was it plain by the Pangs this unhappy Stationer felt soon after that some poisonous Drug had been secretly infused therein  About Eleven a Clock he went home where his Wife observing his Colour chang'd said  Are you not Sick my Dear  He reply'd  Bloody Sick  and incontinently fell a vomiting and straining in an uncommon and unnatural Manner the Contents of his vomiting being as Green as Grass His Wife had been just reading a Book of her Husband's printing concerning  Jane Wenham  the famous Witch of  Hartford  and her Mind misgave her that he was bewitch'd but he soon let her know that he suspected  Poison  and recounted to her between the Intervals of his Yawnings and Reachings every Circumstance of his Interview with Mr  Pope  Mr  Lintott  in the mean Time coming in was extremely afrighted at the sudden Alteration he observed in him  Brother  Curll says he  I fear you have got the vomiting Distemper which I have heard kills in half an Hour This comes from your not following my Advice to drink old Hock as I do and abstain from Sack  Mr  Curll  reply'd in a moving Tone  Your Author's Sack I fear has done my Business Z  ds  says Mr  Lintott My AuthorWhy did not you drink old Hock  Notwithstanding which rough Remonstrance he did in the most friendly Manner press him to take warm Water but Mr  Curll  did with great Obstinacy refuse it which made Mr  Lintott  infer that he chose to die as thinking to recover greater Damages  All this Time the Symptoms encreas'd violently with acute Pains in the lower Belly  Brother  Lintott says he  I perceive my last Hour approaching do me the friendly Office to call my Partner Mr  Pemberton  that we may settle our Worldly Affairs  Mr  Lintott  like a kind Neighbour was hastening out of the Room while Mr  Curll  rav'd aloud in this Manner  If I survive this I will be revenged on  Tonson  it was he first detected me as the Printer of these Poems and I will reprint these very Poems in his Name  His Wife admonish'd him not to think of Revenge but to take care of his Stock and his Soul And in the same Instant Mr  Lintott  whose Goodness can never be enough applauded return'd with Mr  Pemberton  After some Tears jointly shed by these Humane Booksellers Mr  Curll  being as he said in his perfect Senses though in great bodily Pain immediately proceeded to make a verbal Will Mrs  Curll  having first put on his Night Cap in the following Manner  GENTLEMEN in the first Place I do sincerely pray Forgiveness for those indirect Methods I have pursued in inventing new Titles to old Books putting Authors Names to Things they never saw publishing private Quarrels for publick Entertainment all which I hope will be pardoned as being done to get an honest livelihood  I do also heartily beg Pardon of all Persons of Honour Lords Spiritual and Temporal Gentry Burgesses and Commonalty to whose Abuse I have any or every way contributed by my Publications Particularly I hope it will be considered that if I have vilify'd his Grace the Duke of  M  gh  I have likewise aspers'd the late Duke of  O  d  if I have abused the honourable Mr  W  le  I have also libell'd the late Lord  B  ke  so that I have preserv'd that Equality and Impartiality which becomes an honest Man in Times of Faction and Division  I call my Conscience to Witness that many of these Things which may seem malicious were done out of Charity I having made it wholly my Business to print for poor disconsolate Authors whom all other Booksellers refuse Only God bless Sir  Richard Bl  re  you know he takes no Copy Money  The Book of the  Conduct  of the  Earl of N  m  is yet unpublished as you are to have the Profit of it Mr  Pemberton  you are to run the Risque of the Resentments of all that Noble Family Indeed I caused the Author to assert several Things in it as Facts which are only idle Stories of the Town because I thought it would make the Book sell Do you pay the Author for Copy Money and the Printer and Publisher I heartily beg God's and my L  d  N  m  's Pardon but all Trades must live  The second Collection of Poems which I groundlesly called Mr  Prior  's will sell for Nothing and hath not yet paid the Charge of the Advertisements which I was obliged to publish against him Therefore you may as well suppress the Edition and beg that Gentleman's Pardon in the Name of a dying Christian  The  French Cato  with the Criticism showing how superior it is to Mr  Addison  's which I wickedly inscribed to Madam  Dacier  may be suppress'd at a reasonable Rate being damnably translated  I protest I have no Animosity to Mr  Rowe  having printed Part of his  Callipaedia  and an incorrect Edition of his Poems without his Leave in Quarto Mr  Gildon  's  Rehearsal  or  Bays the Younger  did more harm to me than to Mr  Rowe  though upon the Faith of an honest Man I paid him double for abusing both him and Mr  Pope  Heaven pardon me for publishing the  Trials of Sodomy  in an  Elzevir  Letter but I humbly hope my printing Sir  Richard Bl  re  's Essays will attone for them I beg that you will take what remains of these last which is near the whole Impression Presents excepted and let  my poor Widow have in Exchange the sole Propriety of the Copy of Madam  Mascranny  Here Mr  Pemberton  interrupted and would by no Means consent to this Article about which some Dispute might have arisen unbecoming a dying Person if Mr  Lintott  had not interposed and Mr  Curll  vomited  What this poor unfortunate Man spoke afterwards was so indistinct and in such broken Accents being perpetually interrupted by Vomitings that the Reader is intreated to excuse the Confusion and Imperfection of this Account  Dear Mr  Pemberton  I beg you to beware of the Indictment at  Hicks'sHall  for publishing  Rochester  's bawdy Poems that Copy will otherwise be my best Legacy to my dear Wife and helpless Child  The Case of Impotence  was my best Support all the last long Vacation  In this last Paragraph Mr  Curll  's Voice grew more free for his Vomitings abated upon his Dejections and he spoke what follows from his Closestole  For the Copies of Noblemen's and Bishop's  Last Wills and Testaments  I solemnly declare I printed them not with any Purpose of Defamation but meerly as I thought those Copies lawfully purchased from  Doctors Commons  at  One Shilling  a Piece Our Trade in Wills turning to small Account we may divide them blindfold  For Mr  Manwaring  's  Life  I ask Mrs  Old  d  's Pardon Neither  His  nor my Lord  Halifax  's Lives though they were of great Service to their Country were of any to me But I was resolved since I could not print their Works while they liv'd to print their Lives after they were dead  While he was speaking these Words Mr  Oldmixon  enter'd  Ah Mr  Oldmixon said poor Mr  Curll    to what a Condition have your Works reduced me I die a Martyr to that unlucky Preface However in these my last Moments I will be just to all Men you shall have your Third Share of the  Court Poems  as was stipulated When I am dead where will you find another Bookseller Your  Protestant Packet  might have supported you had you writ a little less scurrilously There is a mean in all things  Then turning to Mr  Pemberton  he told him he had several  Taking Title Pages  that only wanted Treatises to be wrote to them and earnestly entreated that when they were writ his Heirs might have some Share of the Profit of them  After he had said this he fell into horrible Gripings upon which Mr  Lintott  advis'd him to repeat the Lord's Prayer He desir'd his Wife to step into the Shop for a CommonPrayerBook and read it by the Help of a Candle without Hesitation He clos'd the Book fetch'd a Groan and recommended to Mrs  Curll  to give Forty Shillings to the Poor of the Parish of St  Dunstan  's and a Week's Wages Advance to each of his  Gentlemen Authors with some small Gratuity in particular to Mrs  Centlivre  The poor Man continued for some Hours with all his disconsolate Family about him in Tears expecting his final Dissolution when of a sudden he was surprizingly relieved by a plentiful foetid Stool which obliged them all to retire out of the Room Notwithstanding it is judged by Sir  Richard Bl  e  that the Poyson is still latent in his Body and will infallibly destroy him by slow Degrees in less than a Month It is to be hoped the other Enemies of this wretched Stationer will not further pursue their Revenge or shorten this small Period of his miserable Life  FINIS
