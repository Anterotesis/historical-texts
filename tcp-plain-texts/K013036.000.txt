SHADOWS OF SHAKESPEARE  I  SOON as the breath of Rumour blew  This solemn theme into the general ear  To holy Solitude I flew  And bade the Muse her sympathy prepare  There closeted with  Thought  The brain its shapeless travail wrought  The season to the subject solemnly did suit  Day's dazzling orb was wholly down  Pale Cynthia sat upon her silver throne  Th' obtrusions of the light were clos'd  It seem'd as SILENCE  self  repos'd  For with the Air the Earth and all her sons were mute  All but the  wretched  who like me  The gentle vigils kept of sympathy  With cordial awe I hail'd the shading night  And kiss'd her dusky robe which muffled thus the light  II  Base busy World begone  begone  I said  To mighty GARRICK yield the serious mind  This awful  Now  be sacred to the dead  And turn the cautious key on human kind  III  The Deadah me  what  deadHere it began  The florid Poet felt himself a Man  And is  he  dead whose wonderworking art  So often  tore  and  touch'd  and  tun'd  the heart  Whose piercing  eye  intelligence could give  And bid  longburied  beings look and live  Whose voice enrich'd the verse  his Shakespeare  writ  And gave to every word its weight of wit  No sentence blemish'd marr'd no golden line  But  polish'd  as he drew it from the mine  Whose tongue grew wanton in his Shakespeare's cause  And gave to crowded Theatres their laws  Whose powerful accents soften'd or sublime  Free from all frippery false pause false chime  Chain'd as to th' attracting centre every ear  And all commanding sawy'd the smile and tear  Is it to Him the Muse must pay  Her tributary lay  For  him  must aching Memory pour the strain  Must she her darling GARRICK'S loss complain  IV  The heart was hurtIt could no more  Along each finer nerve swift shot the misery  Even  Nature  shed her pensive shower  The mighty Mother wept alas with me  Th' imperial Goddess mourn'd her own decay  Mix'd universal with our human clay  And wish'd she could a  second  birth bestow  On this her  Representative below  But ah it cannot be  So the rich debt was paid to poor  Humanity  V  Then in the sable stole of woe  All conscious of the blow  Pale her cheek her eye declining  Half obedient half repining  Her visage mark'd by many a tear  Pour'd from the crystal source of grief sincere  In awful state  Unfortunate and great  MELPOMENE came on  Afflicted for her Son  And thrice methought the BOWL she lifted high  And thrice she threw on Heaven the pitymoving eye  Then like the statue of Despair  Stood fix'dher DAGGER pois'd in air  VI  Now 'twas THALIA first conceiv'd a  pain  'Twas now she echo'd back her sister's sighs again  The jest the laugh the look were o'er  Her cunning was no more  The comic mirth the comic pride  Her wit her whim with GARRICK dy'd  Disdainful then the mask she flung  To vacant airand thus forlorn she sung  And ah away with random rhyme  Tinsel illsuited to the time  Away with leisure's coxcomb line  The couplet quaint the stanza fine  Far from  our  verse be now the pun the point  The period measured joint by joint  Th' elaborate  trade  of poesy forbear  Or rather paint the workings of despair  Scorn the vain edging  able Verse assumes  And let dark  Elegy  pass on in all her pompous plumes  The honour of the Dead in view  A juster path will we pursue  SHAKESPEARE HIMSELF who best our state can feel  Shall the sad tale in his  own language  tell  VII  Th' inspiring Goddess mortals FANCY name  With all her magic arm'd now near me came  Her waving wand deep midnight deeper made  With her I wentto where our GARRICK laid  Cynthia lent a feeble ray  To light us on our way  FANCY with printless footsteps trod  As if advancing towards a GOD  Methought we easy entrance found  And the drear Abbey walk'd around  How fearful thus ye Heavens to tread  The dampsome vaults which close the dead  VIII  But soft  As at the foot of mighty SHAKESPEARE'S tomb  I kneelsudden along the fretted ailes  Innumerous SHADY FORMS by the pale moon's  Imperfect beam beheld in various guise  Each in the habit worn in days of Nature  Appear and pour their potent spells upon me  Aw'd by a sight so strange aloft I stood  And wist not what to dothe figures  mov'd  On near approach I knew them for the TRAIN  Of SHAKESPEARE In procession sad  Strait one by one his hallow'd homage paid  O'er GARRICK'S grave all bending  IX  ARIEL first  Not sightdeceiving as her custom was  When in the bowels of the earth she div'd  "Or mounted on the sharp wind of the North  "Or on the curling clouds or sunny ray  "Nor like a spirit at ease" but with step  DeliberateShe and her fellowministers  "Brimful of sorrow and dismay" stood mute  Then gaz'd upon the grave then sunk in sighs  X  PROSPERO  The great magician nextwhose high command  "Wak'd sleepers in their graves and let them forth"  Beheld the vanishing instruments of 's art  And spake  "Have  ye  which are but  air  "A touch a feeling of our loss extreme  "And shall not  I  one of his  kind  be  kindlier  "Our revel then is done and this our  Actor  "Is no more Lost is the book of Conjuration  "He regulated all our mystic charmsHe's dead  "The cloudcapt tow'rs the gorgeous palaces  "The solemn temples the great globe itself  "Yea all which it inherit shall dissolve  "And like the baseless fabrick of a vision  "Leave not a wreck behind"  XI  He said and pass'd  The  weir'd Sisters  then hagborn and horrid  Mutter'd  their  melancholy homage hoarse  Cold distillations of distress extreme  Fell down the furrows of each wint'ry cheek  Thrice pac'd they piteous round the hallow'd earth  Acknowledging their Lord To GARRICK'S grave  Bow'd every  swarthy She  To end their rites  Imagination's OWL flapp'd her fell wing  And wailing shriek'd as 'cross the dome she slew  Sudden the whirring wizards disappear  And  horse  themselves upon the viewless winds  XII  The gentle ROMEO was the third which came  And oh he said "Turn back dull Earthah me  "Can I go forward when my  friend  is here  "It is even soThen I defy you stars  "Romeo shall never  more  be Romeo now  "His occupation's gone"  XIII  The noble CORIOLANUS was the fourth  Whose very shade look'd martialfirm he strode  And thus with Roman dignity exclaim'd  In honour of the Dead  "  My  fame like  thine  "Demands an equal voice an equal tongue  "All eyes spoke of thee and the bleared sights  "Were spectacled to see theethe veil'd dames  "Commit the wave of white and damask in  "Their nicely gauded cheeks to th'wanton spoil  "Of Phoebus' burning kisses such a pother  "As if that whatsoever God that tun'd thy throat  "Were slyly crept into thy human powers  "To give thee grace and posture Oft great shade  "The dumb men throng'd to  see  thee and the blind  "To  hear  thee speak To thee have Nobles bended  "As to Jove's Statue and the Commons made  "A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts  "As ne'er were seen the like"The soldier pass'd  XIV  The fifth sad spirit that stalk'd by was LEAR'S  Mad as the vext sea still and singing oft  Crown'd as of old by Shakespeare's hand with fumiter  With hardocks hemlocks nettles cuckoo flowers  Darnel and all the idle weeds that grow  In the suftaining corn  At sight of GARRICK'S tomb his wounds again  Bled fresh Tottering he mov'd his words were wild  "You do me wrong to call me out o' th' grave  "And yet I know thee ManHeav'n has thee now  "Thou wer't Lear's friendIn faith I do remember  "Yes we were both as stout a pairbut why  "This truant disposition Is the  greatest  man  "So poor and forked an animal in death  "Off off you lendings come unbutton herePoor shade  "No more of that no more of that  XV  The figure swift succeeding was the THANE'S  Languid and penitentHis hand he wav'd  As 'twere in honour of the man whose voice  Did blow his base design in every ear  Malice was dead within him and he wept  Then striking thrice his bosom  thus  he cried  "Oh Nature how thyself thou blazon'dst  "In this thy Son form'd in thy prodigality  "To hold  thy  mirror up and give the time  "Its very  form  and  pressure  when he spoke  "Each  aged  ear play'd truant at his tales  "And  younger  hearers were quite ravish'd  "So valuable was his discourseYet being dead  "I am a man again"He rush'd along  XVI  The gallant ANTHONY then onward strode  And paus'das 'erst o'er Caesar's corsethen spake  "Thou art the ruins of the noblest man  "That ever liv'd in the tide of Times  "Here was an Actorwhen comes such ANOTHER  XVII  The next a  female  form of PERCY's line  A race for ever noblethus  her  tribute gave  "Thou wert the very glass  "Wherein the noblest youth did  dress  themselves  "There were no  legs  that practis'd not  thy gait  "There were no  eyes  that practis'd not thy looks  "Even those that spoke but low and tardily  "Would turn their own  perfections  to abuse  "To seem like Thee So that in speech in gait  "In accents and affections of delight  "Thou wert the mark and glass copy and book  "To fashion others and on  thee  as on  "  My  Harry and the Sun bright  Honour  stuck  "As sticks the Sun in the grey vault of Heaven"  XVIII  And now the melancholy JAQUES advanc'd  And full of matter thus in few exclaim'd  "Why all the World's a stage  "And all the Men and Women merely players  "They have their  exits  and their entrances  "And THIS MAN in his time play'd many parts  "  Life  No more on't it is a tale told  "By an idiot signifying nothing"  XIX  At last with philosophic step  Swiftstreaming eye and arms entwined close  The sacred shade of his OWN HAMLET came  Long time he paus'dlong time around he look'd  Then fix'd his view upon the grave and spoke  "'Tis not  now seems  in verity it  is  "Oh what a grace was seated on that brow  "An  eye  like Mars to threaten or command  "A combination and a form indeed  "Where every God did seem to set his seal  "To give the world assurance of a Man  "And is it come to thisbut hush my heart  "He was a Man take him for all in all  "We may not look upon his like aga  XX  While wrapt in wonder of these various shews  The sovereign shade of SHAKESPEARE awful rose  His manycolour'd wand he wav'd  And soon the mournful train again were grav'd  Now was His genius even more divine  And all  alone  he stood before  his  GARRICK'S shrine  Rest rest perturbed spirits then he said  To  me  belongs th'inestimable dead  To each 'tis given to breathe to fall  'Tis the fix'd lot of all that soar or crawl  For  Thee  much honour'd friend  What glories mark'd thy end  Applauding nations own thy fame  And with their SHAKSPEARE'S blend their GARRICK'S name  Together then we mount on high  'Tis OUR'S to TRIUMPH 'tis the WORLD'S to SIGH  THE END
