 MEMOIRS OF MAJORGENERAL  HEATH  CONTAINING ANECDOTES DETAILS of SKIRMISHES BATTLES and other MILITARY EVENTS DURING THE AMERICAN WAR  WRITTEN BY HIMSELF  Published according to Act of Congress  PRINTED AT BOSTON BY I THOMAS AND E T ANDREWS FAUST'S STATUE No NEWBURYSTREET Sold by them by I THOMAS Worcester by THOMAS ANDREWS    PENNIMAN Albany by THOMAS ANDREWS    BUTLER Baltimore and by the Booksellers throughout the Continent  AUG    Advertisement  IT was not the intention to publish the Memoirs during the lifetime of the writer They were penned for his own review and the information and satisfaction of his own family as well as posterity If any should think their present publication in any respects relative to himself as too ostentatious candour it is presumed will decide that there is no alternative unless the Memoirs are  mutilated in facts  or  denied at present a publication  The pressing importunity of very many is the sole reason of their appearance at this time  SUCH of the facts as happened under the observation or within the immediate knowledge of the writer have been impartially narrated Those which he has been obliged to collect from other information have been as faithfully attempted but their authenticity cannot be equally vouched for There are doubtless many errors It is the lot of man to be fallible  THE AUTHOR  INTRODUCTION  NATURE seems to have decreed that not only the minor branches of families when they arrive at a proper age of maturity shall separate from their parents and become distinct families but that Colonies when they arrive at a certain degree of population and affluence shall separate from the mother State and become independent and sovereign Howsoever fit and proper this economy of nature may be experience has taught the world that it has been the mistaken policy of nations in almost all ages to oppose such separations as the period approximates by an impolitic exercise of power thereby alienating the affections of the Colonists and rousing in their breasts those innate principles of liberty which nature hath implanted but which had they not been awakened by a severity of conduct would have much longer reposed on the bosom of a mother and even have spurned the idea of separation and have also made use of armed force in the most unnatural and cruel manner to hold in subjection those by nature in every respect free as themselves And in the prosecution of a war thus enkindled alliances are sought for and formed by both parties even with those who before were considered as the enemies of each This has been exemplified in the conduct of GreatBritain towards her American Colonies and by the people of the now United States of America in their struggle for freedom and the establishment of independence and sovereignty  IT is not the intention of the writer to go into a detail of the first settlement of this country or the vicissitudes which have attended it at different periods nor of the rise of the late revolution as these have already been attempted by several writers and probably will hereafter be further elucidated by other pens  To preserve and perpetuate a  daily Journal of occurrences  through nearly the whole of the late American war is the present object And although the following pages are not decorated with the flowers of Greece or Rome and for their diction cannot claim the patronage of the learned they contain a state of facts in detail which may not be unpleasing to posterity who will wish as much as is possible to learn from every remaining vestige the conduct and successes of their ancestors in that revolution which laid the foundation of the independence and sovereignty of their country To them therefore are the following Memoirs bequeathed by him who was an eyewitness to many of the facts which are related and who collected the others from the best information the then moment and circumstances would admit  THAT the United States of America by their virtue their wisdom and their valour may support and maintain the noble achievements of their ancestors and render them still more brilliant is the earnest wish of their devoted  Humble Servant W HEATH  ROIBURY    MEMOIRS  c  _MAJORGENERAL  WILLIAM HEATH  descended from an ancient family in Roxbury near Boston in Massachusetts and is of the fifth generation of the family who have inherited the same real estae taken up in a state of nature not large but fertile and pleasantly situated He was born March d old stile was brought up a farmer of which profession he is yet passionately fond He is of middling stature light complexion very corpulent and baldheaded which led the French officers who served in America very frequently to compare him to the Marquis of Granby  Chastellux's Travels  From his childhood he was remarkably fond of military exercises which passion grew up with him and as he arrived at years of maturity led him to procure and attentively to study every military treatise in the English language which was obtainable This with a strong memory rendered him fully acquainted with the  theory  of war in all its branches and duties from the private soldier to the Commander in Chief  Through the inactive state of the militia company to which he belonged in the spring of the year  he went over to Boston and entered a member of the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company This immediately recommended him to the notice of the Colonel of the first regiment of militia in the county of Suffolk who sent for him and importuned him to take the command of his own company to which Mr Heath was reluctant apprehensive that his youth and stepping over those who had a better claim by former office in the company to the command of it might produce an uneasiness He was however commissioned by Gov Barnard and his apprehensions of uneasiness proved to be groundless  In the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company he was chosen and served first as Lieutenant and afterwards as Captain  In the first regiment of the militia of Suffolk he became the military favourite of Gov Barnard who publickly declared that he would not only make him Colonel of the regiment but if it were in his power a General Officer also  As the dispute between GreatBritain and her American Colonies put on a more serious aspect our Captain did not hesitate for a moment to declare his sentiments in favour of the rights and liberties of his fellowcountrymen This alarmed Gov Barnard's apprehensions but did not alter his open conduct towards our Captain though he privately intimated that if he should promote him he might injure the cause of his royal master It was afterwards intimated to our Captain that if he was not advanced to the command of the regiment he might rest assured that his feelings would never during Gov Barnard's administration be hurt by any other officer being promoted over him which was verified Gov Barnard leaving the province with this regiment unorganized  Capt Heath convinced that the cloud was rapidly gathering and would assuredly burst over America in the beginning of the year commenced his addresses to the public under the signature of  A Military Countryman  and which were occasionally continued until hostilities commenced In them he urged the importance of military discipline and skill in the use of arms as the only means under Heaven that could save the country from falling a prey to any daring invader  Gov Hutchinson succeeded Gov Barnard He organized the first regiment in Suffolk and as might be expected our Captain had a respite from command  When it was recommended to the  people  of Massachusetts to choose officers themselves to command them our Captain was unanimously chosen to take the command of the first company in the town of Roxbury his old and favourite company and on the meeting of the Captains and subalterns of the first regiment of militia in Suffolk he was chosen Colonel  The people of Massachusetts having determined to support their rights and liberties at every hazard finding that such was the sense of the people of their sister Colonies after the dissolution of their General Court elected a Provincial Congress This Congress appointed a  Committee of Safety  of whom our Colonel was one vested with executive powers and another committee called the  Committee of Supplies  The latter were to purchase military stores provisions c and deposit them in such places as the former should direct Both committees entered on the duties of their respective functions The Provincial Congress voted a sum of money for the purpose of procuring military stores and provisions and a quantity of both were collected and stored in the town of Concord  The militia and the corps of minutemen as they were called the latter composed of the young and active were furnished with officers of their own choosing The greatest attention was exhibited by the officers which was as cheerfully seconded by the citizen soldiers to acquire a knowledge of military duty  In the month of February the Provincial Congress passed the following resolutions  In Provincial Congress  Cambridge  February  th  Resolved That the Hon  Jedidiah Prebble  Esq  Hon  Artemas Ward  Esq  Col  Seth Pomeroy  Col  John Thomas  and Col  William Heath  be and they hereby are appointed General Officers whose business and duty it shall be with such and so many of the militia of this province as shall be assembled by order of the Committee of Safety effectually to oppose and resist such attempt or attempts as shall be made for carrying into execution an act of the British Parliament entitled "An Act for the better regulation of the Government of the Province of Massachusetts Bay in NewEngland"or who shall attempt the carrying into execution by force another act of the British Parliament entitled "An Act for the more impartial administration of justice in cases of persons questioned for any act done by them in the execution of the law or for the suppression of riots and tumults in the Province of Massachusetts Bay"so long as the said militia shall be retained by the Committee of Safety and no longer And the said General Officers shall while in the said service command lead and conduct in such opposition in the order in which they are above named any order of any former Congress varying herefrom notwithstanding  In Provincial Congress  Cambridge  February  th  Resolved That the Hon  John Whitcomb  Esq  be added to the General Officers  A true extract from the minutes  Signed BENJ LINCOLN  Sec'ry  Gen Prebble declined the service  In the month of March following the Provincial Congress appointed a committee to make a minute inquiry into the state of the operations of the British army On the th of the same month the committee reported that the British army then consisted of about men distributed as follows On Boston common about on FortHill on Boston neck in barracks at the Castle quartered in Kingstreet that they were erecting works on Boston neck on both sides of the way well constructed and well executed the works were in forwardness and then mounted with ten brass and two iron cannon that the old fortification at the entrance of the town was repaired and rendered much stronger by the addition of timber and earth to the parapet that ten pieces of iron cannon were mounted on the old platforms that a blockhouse brought from Governor's Island was erecting on the south side of the neck between the old fortification and the new works advanced on the neck  On the th of April our General had been sitting with the Committee of Safety at Menotomy in Cambridge and on his return home soon after he left the committee and about sunsetting he met eight or nine British officers on horseback with their swords and pistols riding up the road towards Lexington The time of day and distance from Boston excited suspicion of some design They indeed were out reconnoitring and getting intelligence but were not molested  On the th at daybreak our General was awoke called from his bed and informed that a detachment of the British army were out that they had crossed from Boston to Phipps's farm in boats and had gone towards Concord as was supposed with intent to destroy the public stores They probably had notice that the committees had met the preceding day at Wetherby's tavern at Menotomy for when they came opposite to the house they halted Several of the gentlemen slept there during the night Among them were Col Orne Col Lee and Mr Gerry One of them awoke and informed the others that a body of the British were before the house They immediately made their escape without time to dress themselves at the back door receiving some injury from obstacles in the way in their undressed state They made their way into the fields The country was immediately alarmed and the minutemen and militia turned out with great spirit Near Lexington meetinghouse the British found the militia of that town drawn up by the road Towards these they advanced ordered them to disperse huzzaed and fired upon them when several were killed and wounded and the rest dispersed This was the first shedding of blood in the American war  This company continuing to stand so near to the road after they had certain notice of the advancing of the British in force was but a too much braving of danger for they were sure to meet with insult or injury which they could not repel Bravery when called to action should always take the strong ground on the basis of reason  The British proceeded on to Concord where they destroyed a part of the stores while others were saved by the vigilance activity or policy of the inhabitants In the latter a Capt Wheeler practised with  such address as to save a considerable quantity of flour although exposed to the  critical examination  of a British officer  The British had sent a party to the North Bridge while they were destroying the stores in the town A body of militia who had retreated beyond the bridge and collected in this quarter now marched up resolutely to the bridge The British officer finding their firmness ordered his men to fire which they did and two men of the militia were killed The fire was briskly returned some were killed and wounded of the enemy and an officer taken prisoner The British party retreated with precipitation to their main body and the whole soon commenced their retreat towards Boston the militia galling them on all sides This detatchment under the command of Col Smith must have been worn down and the whole of them killed or taken prisoners had it not been for the reinforcement sent out to them under the command of Lord Percy with two fieldpieces who joined them in the lower part of the town of Lexington  Our General in the morning proceeded to the Committee of Safety From the committee he took a cross road to Watertown the British being in possession of the Lexington road At Watertown finding some militia who had not marched but applied for orders he sent them down to Cambridge with directions to take up the planks barricade the south end of the bridge and there to take post that in case the British should on their return take that road to Boston their retreat might be impeded He then pushed to join the militia taking a cross road towards Lexington in which he was joined by Dr  Joseph Warren  afterwards a MajorGeneral who kept with him  Our General joined the militia just after Lord Percy had joined the British and having assisted in forming a regiment which had been broken by the shot from the British fieldpieces for the discharge of these together with the flames and smoke of several buildings to which the British nearly at the same time had set fire opened a new and more terrific scene and the British having again taken up their retreat were closely pursued On descending from the high grounds in Menotomy on to the plain the fire was brisk At this instant a musketball came so near to the head of Dr Warren as to  strike the pin out of the hair of his earlock  Soon after the right flank of the British was exposed to the fire of a body of militia which had come from Roxbury Brooklyn Dorchester c For a few minutes the fire was brisk on both sides and the British had here recourse to their fieldpieces again but they were now more familiar than before Here the militia were so close on the rear of the British that Dr  Downer  an active and enterprising man came to single combat with a British soldier whom he killed with his bayonet  Not far from this place several of the militia among whom was Isaac Gardner  Esq  of Brooklyn a valuable citizen imprudently posted themselves behind some dry casks at Watson's Corner and near to the road unsuspicious of the enemy's flankguard which came behind them and killed every one of them dead on the spot  The militia continued to hang on the rear of the British until they reached Bunker's Hill in Charlestown and it had become so dusk as to render the flashes of the muskets very visible At this instant an officer on horseback came up from the Medford road and inquired the circumstances of the enemy adding that about men were close behind on  their way from Salem to join the militia Had these arrived a few minutes sooner the left flank of the British must have been greatly exposed and suffered considerably perhaps their retreat would have been cut off As soon as the British gained Bunker's Hill they immediately formed in a line opposite to the neck when our General judged it expedient to order the militia who were now at the common to halt and give over the pursuit as any further attempt upon the enemy in that position would have been futile  Our General immediately assembled the officers around him at the foot of Prospect Hill and ordered a guard to be formed and posted near that place centinels to be planted down to the neck and patroles to be vigilant in moving during the night and an immediate report to him in case the enemy made any movements The militia were then ordered to march to the town of Cambridge where after forming and sending off another guard to the points below the town the whole were ordered to lie on their arms  About midnight there was an alarm that the enemy were coming up the river It proved to be only an armed schooner probably sent to make discovery She got aground and continued so until the next tide and if there had been a single fieldpiece with the militia she might have been taken The marsh was too deep to approach sufficiently near to do any execution with smallarms and the first day's hos+tilities of the ever memorable American war was on their part without a single piece of cannon in the field Gen WHITCOMB was in this day's battle  On the morning of the th our General ordered Capt  John Battle  of Dedham with his company of militia to pass over the ground which had been the scene of action the preceding day and to bury such of the slain as he should find unburied The grounds  around Cambridge were immediately reconnoitred and alarmposts assigned to the several corps and in case the British should come out in superior force and drive the militia from the town they were ordered to rally and form on the high grounds towards Watertown  How to  feed  the assembled and assembling militia was now the great object All the eatables in the town of Cambridge which could be spared were collected for breakfast and the college kitchen and utensils procured for cooking Some carcasses of beef and pork prepared for the Boston market on the th at Little Cambridge were sent for and obtained and a large quantity of shipbread at Roxbury said to belong to the British navy was taken for the militia These were the first provisions which were obtained  At o'clock A M our General appointed Mr  Joseph Ward  a gentleman of abilities his Aiddecamp and Secretary afterwards MusterMasterGeneral of the army who entered on the duties of his new officeThis was the first appointment of the kind in the American army Before noon a letter was received from the Committee of Supplies at Concord expressing their joy at the event of the preceding day with assurances that every exertion in their power should be put in exercise to forward supplies to the militia in arms In the afternoon Gen WARD arrived at Cambridge who being senior in the order of appointment took the command accordingly  In the battle on the th the British were said to have killed wounded and made prisoners in all Of the militia were killed and wounded in all It might have been expected that in a retreat of so many miles the British loss would have been greater but it is to be remembered that as they kept the road the fences  a large proportion of which are stone walls covered their flanks almost to the height of their shoulders It will also be observed that the wounded of the militia did not bear the common proportion with the killed and is an evidence that the British did not choose to encumber themselves with prisoners either wounded or not as the marks left at  Watson's Corner  and on the height above Menotomy meetinghouse evinced Nor was the dashing in of many windows the firing of musketballs into the houses in some of which there were only women and children or the soldiers leaving their ranks and going into the houses to plunder in consequence of which a number lost their lives marks of humanity or discipline  Stedman  in his History of the American War vol st p says "Several of Smith's party were scalped by the Americans" than which nothing can be more untrue Both the wounded and the dead were treated with every mark of humanity and decency  Their whole force on this enterprise including the reinforcement was from to of their best troops  Gen WARD was now the Commander in Chief of the assembled army and exercised the immediate command on the Cambridge side while Gen Thomas had the immediate command on the Roxbury side A few days after this the Cambridge camp being very numerous and the Roxbury camp judged to be too weak the British having gone over from Charlestown to Boston Gen Ward ordered our General with three or four regiments to march from Cambridge and reinforce Gen Thomas and he continued in the Roxbury camp until after the arrival of Gen WASHINGTON in the month of July  In the month of May the Provincial Congress passed resolutions for raising twentyfour regiments to serve during the remainder of the year The  General Officers were each to have a regiment As the new regiments began to recruit the militia went home and the camps became very weak that at Roxbury did not exceed men Had the British sallied at that time there would have been but few to oppose them on that side However the army soon became strong it being reinforced by the arrival of Gen Putnam from Connecticut Gen Sullivan from NewHampshire and Gen Greene from RhodeIsland each with a respectable body of troops and in the month of June it was determined to take possession of the heights of Charlestown Preparations were made for the purpose and on the th at night a strong detachment from the American army marched on and broke ground on  Breed's Hill  in front of Bunker's Hill The latter ought to have been taken possession of at the same time but it was some how omitted  By the morning of the th the troops had a redoubt and line on its left flank in good forwardness when they were discovered by the British The Lively manofwar first began to cannonade the Americans she was soon seconded by other ships floating batteries and some heavy cannon on  Cop's Hill  on the Boston side which the Americans bore with a good degree of firmness and continued at their work The British army in Boston were greatly alarmed at this near approach and immediately resolved on an attack before the works could be completed A detachment was formed for the purpose consisting of ten companies of Grenadiers ten of Light Infantry and the th th d and d regiments and a corps of Artillery under the command of Maj Gen Howe and Brig Gen Pigot In the afternoon they landed on Charlestown Point without opposition where they were afterwards reinforced by the th regiment and first battalion of marines The  regiments in Cambridge camp were ordered down to support the detachment at Charlestown and to occupy other posts thought to be essential and contiguous thereto The British began their attack with a severe fire of artillery and advanced in a slow and regular pace The Americans who had marched on to the aid of the detachment consisting of the NewHampshire Massachusetts and Connecticut troops hastily formed a line of defence composed of rails and other materials found nearest at hand This line extended down towards the low ground on the left and was nobly defended The Americans reserved their fire until the British came very near when they gave it to great effect it staggered and even broke them but they rallied and returning to the charge again and again drove the Americans from the lines on the left of the redoubt and had nearly surrounded it when the Americans rushed out of the redoubt their ammunition being expended and made their retreat even through a part of the British forces About this time Maj Gen  Warren  who had been but a few days before commissioned and was then on the hill as a spectator only was killed A number of the Americans were killed in retreating from Breed's Hill to Bunker Hill and some in passing off over the neck Perhaps there never was a better fought battle than this all things considered and too much praise can never be bestowed on the conduct of Col  William Prescott  who notwithstanding any thing that may have been said  was the proper commanding officer  at the redoubt and nobly acted his part as such during the whole action  Just before the action began Gen Putnam came to the redoubt and told Col Prescott that the entrenching tools must be sent off or they would be lost the Colonel replied that if he sent any of the  men away with the tools not one of them would return to this the General answered they shall every man return A large party was then sent off with the tools and not one of them returned in this instance the Colonel was the best judge of human nature  In the time of action Col Prescott observing that the brave Gen Warren was near the works he immediately stepped up to him and asked him if he had any orders to give him The General replied that he had none that he exercised no command there  "The commana"  said the General  "is yours"  While many officers and soldiers gallantly distinguished themselves in this action others were blamed and some were brought to trial by courtmartial This was a sore battle to the British who did not forget it during several campaigns nor until a tide of successes in their favour had removed it from their minds Their whole force on this day which was in action was supposed to be about and their whole loss in killed and wounded was said to be upwards of of whom were killed and of these were commissioned officers including one LieutenantColonel two Majors and seven Captains Another account stated their killed and wounded to be privates serjeants and corporals and commissioned officers in the whole The loss of the Americans in killed wounded and prisoners about  At the time the British made their attack the houses in Charlestown were set on fire and burnt most furiously which increased the horrors of the scene At the same time a furious cannonade and throwing of shells took place at the lines on Boston neck against Roxbury with intent to burn that town but although several shells fell among the houses and some carcasses near them and balls went  through some no other damage was sustained than the loss of one man killed by a shot driving a stone from a wall against him  On the th Congress appointed GEORGE WASHINGTON Commander in Chief and on the th Artemas Ward first MajorGeneralCharles Lee second MajorGeneralHoratio Gates AdjutantGeneral with the rank of BrigadierGeneral and on the th Philip Schuyler third MajorGeneral and Israel Putnam fourth MajorGeneral and on the d Seth Pomeroy first BrigadierGeneralRichard Montgomery second do David Wooster third do William Heath fourth do Joseph Spencer fifth do John Thomas sixth do John Sullivan seventh do Nathaniel Green eighth do and made provision for raising an army for the defence of the United Colonies Before these appointments were made known at camp on the st of June our General received from the Provincial Congress a commission of MajorGeneral Generals Ward Thomas and Warren had before received their commissions the latter just before he was slain Gen Pomeroy declining an acceptance of the commission from Congress that Honorable Body on the th of July resolved that Gen Thomas be appointed first BrigadierGeneral in the army of the United Colonies in the room of Gen Pomeroy who never acted under the commission sent to him and that Gen Thomas's commission bear the same date that Gen Pomeroy's did indeed this was the rank to which Gen Thomas was entitled by former standing Congress now also appointed Joseph Trumbull to be CommissaryGeneral of stores and provisions for the army but left the appointment of a QuarterMasterGeneral and some other officers to Gen Washington who appointed the able and very active Col Thomas Mifflin QuarterMasterGeneral  who did himself much honour and his country service in this important department  Immediately after the battle of Bunker Hill the Americans began to erect works on Prospect Hill a very commanding height above Charlestown common and at several other places Several works were also constructed at Roxbury and the British confined to Boston and Charlestown within the neck  The works now going on both on the Cambridge and Roxbury side were considerable and there was a great want of engineers Col Gridley was chief Engineer and was aided by his son But the strength of body activity and genius of the Americans capable of constructing with surprising dispatch any works in which they were guided called for many instructors in this department Lieut Col Rufus Putnam of Col David Brewer's regiment was very serviceable in this line on the Roxbury side as was also Capt Josiah Waters of Boston and Capt Baldwin of Brookfield afterwards Colonel of Artificers and others on the Cambridge side and Capt Henry Knox who had been an officer in the Boston Grenadier Company and who was afterwards at the head of the American artillery to the close of the war occasionally lent his aid His military genius and acquaintance with our General led him to be importunate with Capt Knox to join the army nor did he need persuasion to join in the cause of his country His removal out of Boston and the then state of his domestic concerns required some previous arrangement as soon as this was effected he joined the army  thAbout noon a heavy cannonade and throwing of shells from the lines on Boston neck into Roxburybut no damage done Two American soldiers attempting to set fire to Brown's barn  on Boston neck were killed by the British The same evening two heavy cannon were brought to the work on the hill above Roxbury workhouse  thAt night an attempt was made to burn the buildings on Boston neck a

British retreated  July  stA platform in the work above Roxbury workhouse being laid a pounder was mounted and discharged twice at the British lines the second shot grazed the parapet and struck on the parade and occasioned some confusion There was more or less firing of cannon on both sides daily All the works were pushed with the utmost diligence  dAbout two o'clock P M Gen WASHINGTON attended by several officers arrived at the camp in Cambridge  On the morning of this day the British cannonaded briskly from their lines on Boston neck against Roxbury and threw some shells a carcass set fire

fire from the enemy  thGen Washington accompanied by MajorGen Lee visited the Roxbury camp works c  thA little after two o'clock in the morning a number of volunteers under the command of Majors  Tupper  and  Crane  attacked the British advance guard at Brown's house on Boston neck and routed them took a halbert a musket and two bayonets and burnt the two houses the store and  barn escaped the

considerable force by way of the lakes They had advanced as far as Fort St John's but finding that this fort would make considerable resistance they fell back Schuyler returned to Albany to hold a treaty with the Indians and Montgomery waited for the arrival of his artillery that he might reduce the forts  Some time before this Col Ethan Allen of the NewHampshire Grants since Vermont with a number of volunteers took possession of Ticonderoga The artillery secured by Allen were an acquisition to the Americans and Col Knox went up the next winter and selected and brought forward a number of pieces to the camp before Boston The garrison of this place which was commanded by a Captain apprehending no danger were negligent and remiss in duty Allen was acquainted at the place and now as is said requested a part of the garrison to aid him in transporting some goods Nearly half of the garrison were granted him These were plentifully served with liquor and in the night Allen entered the fort and demanded a delivery of it The commandant asking by what authority he required him to surrender Allen replied"I demand it in the name of the great Jehovah and the Continental Congress" He also took possession of CrownPoint and before Montgomery was ready to proceed against the Forts Chambly and St John's Allen determined to surprise Montreal For this purpose he marched across with a body of

and landed on Leechmore's Point The centinels on the point came off the alarm was given and several hundred Americans forded over the causeway in the face of the British the water at least two feet deep The British seeing the spirit of the Americans although they were very advantageously posted made a precipitate retreat to their boats Three or four Americans were wounded one mortally The

General with a detachment of similar strength to that of the preceding night  were ordered to Cobble Hill to complete the works A sally from the British was expected and Col Bridge with his regiment was ordered to the foot of the hill and to patrole towards the bay and neck constantly during the night The picket at Prospect Hill was also ordered to be in readiness to succour the troops at the works if they were attacked and Col Bond's regiment also lay on their arms but the British did not move Two of the British centinels came off in the night to the detachment the whole came off at daybreak and other troops were ordered on the works in the day time now in good forwardness and defensible  thAn additional ship came up and took station at the ferry Upon a few shot being fired by the American advance centinels the British drums on Bunker's Hill beat to arms which were followed by the Americans At this time the British were erecting several bombbatteries at Boston to annoy the Americans Col Enos who was of Col Arnold's detachment from the army destined to cross the woods by a northeastern route into Canada having proceeded a very considerable distance Arnold's sick returning back and his own men growing sickly returned with his part of the detachment This lessened the expectation of success to the American army in Canada  thIntelligence was received from CapeAnn that a vessel from England laden with warlike stores had been taken and brought into that place There was on board one inch brass mortar stand of arms flints tons of leaden ball c c A fortunate capture for the Americans  December  dThe brass inch mortar and sundry military stores taken in the ordnance prize were brought to camp  thIntelligence was received that Col Arnold had made his way safely into Canada  thA causeway was begun over the marsh to Leechmore's Point Two pounders were brought from Roxbury and mounted at Cobble Hill  thAn express arrived from Marblehead with advice that three British menofwar were standing for that harbour Col Glover's regiment with Capt Forster's company of artillery and a company of riflemen were ordered to march to Marblehead with all expedition  th th and thApproaches were carried briskly on to Leechmore's Point and nearly to the top of the hill  thThe morning was foggy A detachment of men under the direction of Gen Putnam broke ground on the top of the hill on Leechmore's Point at a distance of not more than half a mile from the ship Between twelve and one o'clock the fog cleared away and the ship began to cannonade the Americans with round and grape shot and some shells were thrown from WestBoston One soldier was wounded and the party driven from the works Several cannon were fired from Cobble Hill at the ship one shot was supposed to have struck her  thOur General was ordered with men to prosecute the work begun on Leechmore's Point It was expected that this would have been a bloody day and Dr Downer one of the surgeons was ordered down with the detachment with his instruments c to assist the wounded Fortunately for the detachment Capt Smith of the artillery had in the morning discharged an pounder from Cobble Hill at the ship which induced her to weigh anchor and run below the ferryway  When our General arrived nearly at the summit of the hill he halted the detachment and went forward himself and took a view of the state of the works which in some places were but just begun  in others were carried half way up He then ordered the front company to move up the hill ground their arms and move into a part of the works assigned to themand so on through the whole to prevent confusion in entering the works and thereby increasing an object to the British gunners As soon as the men were placed in the works two centinels were posted to watch the British batteries with orders on discovering the discharge of cannon to call out  a shot  The men in the works were ordered to be steady on the signal of a shot to settle down and remain so until the shot had struck or if a shell until it had burst then to rise and prosecute the workno man to step out of his place In a very short time a shot was cried by the centinels It proved to be a shell which fell and burst within a few feet of a part of the workmen throwing the dirt among them and a piece of the shell hitting a soldier's hat On the second discharge the men fell as before when on rising two or three heavy cannonshot struck in the face of the work the British having discharged the cannon in such time after the mortar as that the shot might take effect just as the men arose after the bursting of the shell but in this they did not succeed the men being ordered to keep down until both had struck Finding this deception to fail a shell was broke in the air directly over the party at or feet high This also had as little effect upon the Americans The fire continued until the afternoon when it ceased and it was afterwards learnt that the commandingofficer of the British artillery who stood and observed the effect of their fire upon the Americans went to their General and informed him that from his own observation their fire had no other effect than to inure the Americans to danger and advised its discontinuance In the afternoon Gen Washington and several  other General Officers came on to the Point Towards night the detachment were ordered to move out of the works by companies as they went in take up their arms move under the hill and form the detachment from whence it was marched to Cambridge attended by their surgeon who had been in waiting all the day but had no occasion to draw his instruments from their case or a bandage or dressing from his box  thThe prosecution of the works on Leechmore's Point was continued The British cannonaded and bombarded the new detachment but to no effect The same took place on the th On this day a inch shell was thrown almost up to No It was probably thrown either at the works before mentioned or at the colleges It did not burst Nearly five pounds of powder was taken out of the shell  dThe British threw one shell and fired two shot from Bunker's Hill in Charlestown at the works on Leechmore's Point The cannonade c continued on the d and th but to no effect  thA strong detachment from Winter Hill marched in the night to surprise the British outposts in Charlestown They passed on the south side of Cobble Hill and were to cross the cove on the ice When they came to the channel it was found to be open A soldier slipping down on the ice his piece accidentally went off which caused an alarm and the detachment returned  stIntelligence was received that there had been an action at Norfolk in Virginia between Dunmore's army and the Virginians to the advantage of the latter Fifty of the regular toops were said to have been killed and wounded among the former was Capt  Fordyce  of the th British regiment an active and good officer The Virginians had  not a man killed Dunmore's force was supposed to be about  January  st presented a great change in the American army The officers and men of the new regiments were joining their respective corps those of the old regiments were going home by hundreds and by thousands The best arms such as were fit for service were detained from the soldiers who were going home they were to be paid for but it created much uneasiness Such a change in the very teeth of an enemy is a most delicate manoeuvre but the British did not attempt to take any advantage of it  thIt having been thought expedient to deprive the British of the houses in Charlestown below Bunker's Hill a detachment was ordered for the purpose One hundred men from the First Brigade and a like number from Frye's Brigade with Captains Williams Gould and Wyman Lieutenants Foster Shaw Patterson and Trafton and Ensign Cheney the whole under the command of Major Knoulton aided by BrigadeMajors Henly and Carey The detachment marched between and o'clock in the evening and the object was effected without the loss of a man Several British soldiers were taken prisoners The garrison of Bunker Hill works commenced a brisk fire down the hill towards the houses but no damage was sustained There had been a number of deserters from the British since those heretofore mentioned  thIntelligence was received that on the st of December at three o'clock A M Gen Montgomery made an attempt to carry Quebec by assault Col Arnold had entered the lower city and Gen Montgomery was ascending the barriers at the other end when he was killed by a musketball as was his Aiddecamp A number of those who had  entered the lower city were killed or taken prisoners and the enterprise defeated No account of the American loss was at this time reported  Great address and gallantry were exhibited on this expedition The Americans ascending Kennebeck river crossing the height of land and descending into Canada was an arduous undertaking Montgomery was fired with a noble ardor He had been successful hitherto and the reduction of the city of Quebec would have been the finishing stroke With this he hoped to close the year To reduce the city by siege would require a long time if not relieved nor had he a train of artillery for the purpose With this day would expire the time of service of many of his troops He therefore resolved to attempt to carry the place by assault Two real attacks were to be made on the lower city at the opposite ends one guided by himself the other by Arnold and there were to be two false attacks made on the upper city to divide and distract the enemy Every thing was well arranged Arnold forced his way in was wounded and carried awayhis party fighting on Montgomery passed along a very narrow defile next to the bank to a barrier obstinately defended and here he fellhere was an end to his attack The other party fought on but these being now the only enemy to oppose the British turned their whole force to that quarter They could not well retreat the whole were killed wounded or taken prisoners There was here barely a prospect of success unless fortune should prove more favourable to merit than she is wont to do Nothing more could be done on the score of gallantry How far the attempt was a prudent one is another question It is a military maxim that "fortune may fail us but a prudent conduct never will" At the same time some of the most brilliant victories have been obtained by a dating stroke  thCol Knox of the artillery came to camp He brought from Ticonderoga a fine train of artillery which had been taken from the British both cannon and mortars and which were ordered to be stopped at Framingham  dSeveral Indians came to camp from the westward Intelligence was received from Canada that the blockade of Quebec was continued notwithstanding the rebuff on the morning of the st of December  February  stA number of British soldiers from Bunker's Hill went to pulling down the tidemill at Charlestown A cannon was discharged at them from Cobble Hill which dispersed them for a short time but they returned again  thThree cows were feeding near the British outpost at Charlestown neck A party of the British came out got above them drove them to the neck and killed them This brought on a brisk firing at the outposts and some cannon were discharged from Bunker's Hill It was supposed that the British had one man killed and one wounded  thAt night a party of Americans from Winter Hill went down and burnt the old tidemill in Charlestown  thIn the morning a party of British troops from the Castle and another from Boston crossed over to Dorchester neck with intent to surprise the American guard which they came well nigh effecting the guard but just escaping them There was but one musket fired on the side of the Americans An old inhabitant and his son were taken prisoners The British burnt the houses on the point and then returned  thIntelligence was received from Canada that some of the British garrison of Quebec having made a sally in order to get fuel they were driven  back with the loss of twelve killed and fifteen wounded  The heights round Boston  except those at Dorchester  having been taken possession of it was now determined that these also should be occupied and great previous preparation was made for the purpose It was imagined that so near an approach to the British would induce them to make a sally to dislodge the Americans It was therefore deliberated in Council that in case the British should come forth a strong detachment of Americans from the Cambridge camp in  boats  should proceed down the river and land at the bottom of the common in Boston To this our General made a most pointed opposition alleging that it would most assuredly produce only deseat and disgrace to the American army that the British General must be supposed to be a master of his profession that as such he would first provide for the defence of the town in every part which was the great deposit of all his stores that when this was done if his troops would afford a redundancy sufficient for a sally he might attempt it but it was to be remembered that at any rate the town would be defended that it was impossible for troops armed and disciplined as the Americans then were to be pushed down in boats at least one mile and a half open to the fire of all the British batteries on the west side of the town and to their whole park of artillery which might be drawn to the bottom of the common long before the Americans could reach it and be flanked also by the works on the neck that under such a tremendous fire the troops could not effect a landing and that he would never give his vote for it It was however carried that the attempt should be made  thIt being Lord's day after public service a proclamation from the General Assembly of Massa  chusetts for the reformation of manners was read to the first division by the Rev Mr Leonard  stA picket of men was ordered to Leechmore's Point and Col Sargent's regiment at Inman's farm was ordered to be in readiness to support them in case they should be attacked by the British as some grounds for suspecting it had been discovered  dEnsign Lyman of Huntington's regiment with a small party took a Corporal and two men who were centinels at Brown's chimneys on Boston neck without firing a gun These prisoners reported that the heavy cannon were removed from Bunker's Hill and put on board ship  thSome heavy cannon were mounted on the works at Leechmore's Point The same day the British were busily employed in erecting a work a little to the north of the powder magazine in Boston  thThe British threw some shells to Leechmore's Point  March  stSeveral mortars were sent over to Roxbury and great preparations made to annoy the enemy Bundles of screwed hay were brought from Chelsea to be used in the works  dAt night a cannonade and bombardment began at the American works on Cobble Hill and Leechmore's Point on the Cambridge side and at Lamb's Dam on the Roxbury side against the British works and a number of shells were thrown into Boston The British returned the fire and threw out a number of shells one of which of inches reached Prospect Hill One of the American mortars of inches and two of inches were burst They were not properly bedded as the ground was hard frozen  thThere was an almost incessant roar of cannon and mortars during the night on both sides  The Americans took possession of Dorchester heights and nearly completed their works on both the hills by morning Perhaps there never was so much work done in so short a space of time The adjoining orchards were cut down to make the abbattis and a very curious and novel mode of defence was added to these works The hills on which they were erected were steep and clear of trees and bushes Rows of barrels filled with earth were placed round the works They presented only the appearance of strengthening the works but the real design was in case the enemy made an attack to have rolled them down the hill They would have descended with such increasing velocity as must have thrown the assailants into the utmost confusion and have killed and wounded great numbers This project was suggested by Mr  William Davis  merchant of Boston to our General who immediately communicated it to the Commander in Chief who highly approved of it as did all the other officers But the credit of it is justly due to Mr  Davis  and to him the writer gives it As the regiments at Roxbury were parading in the afternoon of this day to march to Dorchester a shot from the British lines on Boston neck carried away a thigh of Lieut John Mayo of Learned's regiment he soon after died One man was killed by a shell at Leechmore's Point in the night  thThe British it was expected would attempt to dislodge the Americans from Dorchester heights Signals had been prepared at Roxbury meetinghouse to mark the moment The detachment at Cambridge designed to push into Boston in the boats was paraded not far from No where it remained a good part of the day But kind Heaven which more than once saved the Americans when they would have destroyed themselves did not allow the  signals to be made About of the British troops it was said had been sent down to the Castle with the intent to have made an attack on the Americans but about midnight the wind blew almost a hurricane from the south many windows were forced in sheds and fences blown down and some vessels drove on shore and no attempt was made on the works  Some  were ready to blame our General for the sentiments which he expressed against the going into Boston as was proposed in the boats and attributed it to the want of sirmness But the opinion of every  military  man since that time whether  American French  or  British  who have taken a view of the land and water which was to have been the scene of action with the concomitant circumstances as far as we have heard hath been coincident and those who may in future review them will for themselves determine whether the  independence of spirit and sentiments  of our General expressed on the occasion merited  applause  or  censure  For himself he has been frequently heard to say that he  gloried in them  On the night of the th Capt Erving made his escape out of Boston He reported that the British were preparing to leave the town that they were putting their cannon mortars shot shells c on board the storeships that some of the shot and shells sent into the town by the Americans had been well directed  thThe Americans at Dorchester neck opened a battery to the northeast of Bird's Hill near the water with the intent to annoy the British shipping This night a strong detachment went down to open a work on Nook Hill in Dorchester still nearer to Boston Some of the men imprudently kindled a fire behind the hill previous to the hour for breaking of ground The enemy discovered the light  of the fire and there was during the evening and night a continual roar of cannon and mortars from the Castle and lines on Boston neck south end of that town as well as from the Americans at Roxbury Cobble Hill and Leechmore's Point at Cambridge The second shot from the British at the old fortification south end of the town of Boston killed Americans who were standing around the fire before mentioned at Nook Hill one of whom was Dr Dow of Connecticut Another man was killed at the point next to the Castle This suspended the work for the night during which more than shot were fired  thThe cannonade continued The British were putting their cannon military stores and baggage on board the storeships and transports This evening two pieces of cannon and two small mortars were carried on to Noddle's Island to disturb the British shipping but the enemy being quiet at their different works they were not molested from that quarter  thIn the evening there was a brisk cannonade from the British at the south end of Boston and the lines on the neck  thA Mr Woodward came out of Boston He reported that the British were making the greatest preparations to leave the town that a number of guncarriages ammunitionwaggons c had been broken to pieces and thrown off the wharves that some furniture had been destroyed and that many dry goods had been seized c  thSix regiments of the American army viz Greaton's Stark's Patterson's Bond's Webb's and the rifle regiment were put under orders to march for NewYork of these our General was to take the command A detachment of artillery was also ordered to march with this brigade  On the evening of the th a fire broke out in Patterson's barracks at Cambridge which consumed six rooms destroyed some musketcartridges c This day the rifle regiment commenced their march for NewYork  thIn the morning the British evacuated Boston their rear guard with some marks of precipitation A number of cannon were left spiked and two large marine mortars which they in vain attempted to burst The garrison at Bunker's Hill practised some deception to cover their retreat They fixed some images representing men in the places of their centinels with muskets placed on their shoulders c Their immoveable position led to the discovery of the deception and a detachment of the Americans marched in and took possession The troops on the Roxbury side moved over the neck and took possession of Boston as did others from Cambridge in boats On the Americans entering the town the inhabitants discovered joy inexpressible The town had been much injured in its buildings and some individuals had been plundered Some British stores were left The British army went on board their transports below the Castle A number of American adherents to them and the British cause went away with the army  thThe brigade destined for NewYork marched from the vincinity of Boston  thThe British blew up Castle William and burnt some of the barracks  thThe British cannonaded from the Castle the Americans on Dorchester neck The same morning our General left Roxbury for NewYork He reached Mendon from whence on the same evening he observed the light in the air of the finishing stroke of burning the barracks c at the Castle The British destroyed the guncarriages  and knocked the trunnions off the cannon and left them spiked The cannon were afterwards drilled free and mounted on a new construction in stocks placed on carriages and were thereby rendered serviceable  dOur General reached Norwich in Connecticut The troops marched with great expedition but by

They reported that the fleet from Halifax with Gen Howe's army were hourly expected to arrive at NewYork Every exertion was now in exercise to complete the works and to obstruct the river The latter was near Fort Washington and prosecuted by sinking a number of large hulks and frames called  chevauxdefrise  composed of large and long timbers framed together with  points elevated to pierce and stop the way of vessels meeting of them These were boxed at the bottom to contain a vast weight of stones which were put into them and with which they sunk A line of these and hulks was formed across the river some of them sunk very well others rather irregular and some of the hulks which were strapped together with large timbers separated in going down A passage was left open for vessels to pass

passed the city up the Hudson A brisk cannonade took place from Red Hook Governor's Island Paulus Hook and all the batteries on the North River side The ships were several times struck by the shot but received no material damage The ships returned the fire as they passed the batteries and the encampment of our General's brigade the right flank of which being Col Shepard's regiment was on the bank of the river The tents were struck and dropped on the ground before the ships came abreast of them Several shot fell on the encampment and one entered the embrasure of a small redoubt on the flank of the encampment and struck in the banquette on the opposite side of the redoubt between the legs of two soliders but did no damage Several American artillerists were killed and wounded by the bursting of some of our own cannon The ships ran nearly up to Tappan Bay and came to anchor  thA British officer came up with a flag with a letter to Gen Washington but the letter not being properly addressed it was not received The same day a flag was sent by Lord Howe to Amboy with sundry letters directed to the chief magistrates of several of the Colonies and a declaration offering the King's pardon to such Colonies towns or boroughs as should submit to his Majesty's laws c Lord and Gen Howe were Commissioners appointed to receive submissions  thAnother flag came up from Lord Howe with a letter

was intended to attempt burning the British ships in Tappan Bay The American army was now very sickly four soldiers were buried on this day from our General's brigade only About and a  little after  this time the army was more sickly than at any other period The newspapers at Philadelphia and Boston rated the army at strong and in high spirits and that they would soon clear the enemy from America This was not a little mortifying to Gen Washington who had the evidence that the army did not exceed officers  included and a large portion of these were levies and militia called out for short periods and unacquainted with a camp life Hence the number of sick amounted to near nor was it possible to find proper hospitals or proper necessaries for them In almost every barn stable shed and even under the fences and bushes were the sick to be seen whose countenances were but an index of the dejection of spirit and the distress they endured  thIt was learnt that the British were preparing for an attack and were putting their heavy artillery c on board ship  In reconnoitring the position of NewYork long before this time all were agreed that the upper end of the island and above Kingsbridge must be secured or there could be no security to an army on the island but there was some difference in opinion as to the place A commanding height near Morris's house some distance below the bridge within the island was thought by some among whom was Gen Putnam a position which if properly fortified would be almost impregnable While others among whom was our General and his brother Gen Greene who were generally in sentiment insisted that there could be no security on the island although the post before mentioned was made as strong as Gibralter if the heights above the bridge were left unfortified as the enemy might at any time in an hour or two possess themselves of those heights above the bridge and completely entrap the army and each declared positively that he would not rest easy or satisfied until those grounds were taken possession of Fort Washington was begun on the hill first mentioned and the works were pushed as fast as possible and it was determined to erect another fort above the bridge which was also begun and called Independence Every exertion was now in exercise to complete the  works in and about the city some of which were strong Indeed immense labour had been bestowed on the works at the city on LongIsland at Horn's Hook near Hell Gate and at Paulus Hook on the Jersey side opposite the city on Governor's Island c  thOur General received a commission from Congress dated the th appointing him a MajorGeneral in the army of the United States of America Generals Spencer Sullivan and Green received at the same time commissions of the same tenor  thIn the afternoon or British vessels came through the Narrows and joined the fleet  thA number more of ships some of them very large came in and joined the fleet the ships up the river fell a little lower down  thOur General rode to Horn's Hook and Kingsbridge The person who had the direction of the firevessels requested him to be a spectator on the bank of the river of an attempt intended to be made on that night to burn the ships Attended by Gen Clinton and several other officers they waited on the bank until about midnight but no attempt on the ships was made and they returned disappointed  thOur General was again requested to be a spectator on the bank of the river the approaching night with the most positive assurances that he should not be again disappointed he accordingly went attended as on the preceding time and took a proper position on the bank The night was pretty dark they soon found that the gallies and firevessels were silently moving up with the tide After some time and almost immediately after the centinels on board the British ships had passed the word  "all is well"  two of the firevessels flashed into a blaze the one close on the side of the Phenix the other grappling  one of the tenders To appearance the flames were against the side of the Phenix and there was much confusion on board A number of cannon were discharged into the firevessel in order to sink her A number of seamen ascended and got out on the yardarm supposed to clear away some grapplings The firevessel was along side as was judged near ten minutes when the Phenix either cut or slipt her cable let fall her foretopsail wore round and stood up the river being immediately veiled from the spectators by the darkness of the night The tender burnt down to the water's edge and was towed to the shore by the Americans out of which was taken one iron sixpounder two threepounders one twopounder ten swivels a caboose some gunbarrels cutlasses grapplings chains c The Rose and the other two tenders remained at their moorings but it was said that one of the tenders was deserted by her crew for a time Several of our gallies were said to have been inactive otherwise a very considerable advantage would have been reaped The Americans sustained no loss or injury saving one man who in communicating fire to one of the vessels got considerably burnt in the face hands c  thThe Commander in Chief having ordered our General to take the command of the troops and posts at the north end of the island and above Kingsbridge within which command fell the Forts Washington and Independence and a number of other works he took the command accordingly  thVery early in the morning the wind being pretty fresh and it being very rainy the ships and tenders which were up the river got under sail and ran down keeping as close under the east bank as they could in passing our works They were however briskly cannonaded at Fort Washington and the works below were several times struck but  received no material damage They joined their fleet near StatenIsland  thIt was made pretty certain that the British were upon the point of making an attack somewhere By an express which our General received from Gen Washington at half past o'clock A M of the d he was pleased to communicate that by intelligence which he had received the enemy had intentions of making attacks on LongIsland up the North River upon Bergen Point ElizabethTown Point Amboy c Perhaps so many places were mentioned in order to divide the force of and distract the Americans On this morning however they landed near Gravesend Bay on Long Island about men Col Hand with his rifle corps retreating moderately before them and destroying some wheat which would fall into their hands The British advanced as far as Flatbush where they halted Six American regiments were sent over as a reinforcement Gen Sullivan had the command on the island  thThere were some skirmishes on LongIsland but nothing very material  thA number of the enemy's ships fell down towards the Narrows it was supposed with intent to land more troops on LongIsland  thIn the morning a brisk cannonade on LongIsland for some time The British had thrown up some works at Flatbush from which they fired at the Americans  thEarly in the morning two ships and a brig came to anchor a little above Frog Point Our General immediately detached Col Graham with his regiment to prevent their landing to plunder or burn Before he arrived several barges full of men landed on New City Island and killed a number of cattle Two companies of the regiment immediately  on their arrival ferried over to the island The enemy carried off one man and cattlethe remainder of the cattle were secured  On the same day there was a most bloody battle on LongIsland between the Americans and the British The British by a long circuitous march in the night of the th with a part of their army found the left of the Americans not so well secured as it ought to have been and they had an opportunity to reach ground which gave them great advantage while it equally exposed the Americans in the strong grounds towards Flatbush There was here also another circumstance of ground which now proved very disadvantageous to the Americans There was a considerable marsh into which a creek ran and on which there was a mill known by the name of M'Gowen's At the mill there was a passway over but unluckily when  some  of the Americans had retreated by this mill for they were soon routed by the British who formed an attack almost in a semicircle it was set on fire This would have been a politic step had  all  the Americans on the other side in that quarter previously passed but those still beyond the creek were now driven to almost desperate circumstances they could not pass at the head of the creek for the British column which made the circuitous movement were in possession of the ground on the left consequently many were here killed or taken prisoners and numbers perished in attempting to get over the creek some of them sticking in the mud Those who escaped retreated to the American works The British sustained a considerable loss in killed and wounded and a subaltern and men were taken prisoners but the American loss was far greater in killed wounded and prisoners Among the latter were Gen Sullivan and Lord Sterling Several field  pieces were also lost At evening the British army encamped in front of the Americans  On the morning of the th there was a skirmish between the Americans and British which terminated rather in favour of the former The same night the British began to open works at the distance of about yards from the American works on the left Gen Washington wrote to our General to send down to the city all the boats that could be spared from Kingsbridge and Fort Washington intimating that he might possibly find it necessary at night to throw over more troops to LongIsland This order was immediately complied with and the boats sent down while the real intention of their use was fully understood  thThe ships in the East River fell down to Hunt's Point On the same night the Americans evacuated LongIsland bringing off their military stores provisions c Some heavy cannon were left In this retreat from the island and which was well conducted an instance of discipline and of true fortitude was exhibited by the American guards and pickets In order that the British should not get knowledge of the withdraw of the Americans until their main body had embarked in the boats and pushed off from the shore which was a matter of the highest importance to their safety the guards were ordered to continue at their respective posts with centinels alert as if nothing extraordinary was taking place until the troops had embarked they were then to come off march briskly to the ferry and embark themselves But somehow or other the guards came off and had got well toward the landingplace when they were ordered to face about march back and reoccupy their former posts which they instantly obeyed and continued at them until called off to cross the ferry Whoever has  seen troops in a similar situation or duly contemplates the human heart in such trials well know how to appreciate the conduct of these brave men on this occasion  stIn the forenoon the British appeared at Newton where they pitched a number of tents Governor's Island was evacuated the preceding night by the Americans It was now evident that the next object of the enemy would be to get the city and it was equally so that they would land somewhere on the island without it This night several of the regiments of Gen Misslin's brigade of our General's division lay on the hills towards NewYork and Gen Clinton's brigade on their arms The same evening Hand's Shee's Magaw's Broadhead's and Miles's battalions joined our General's division Some of these corps had suffered greatly in the action on LongIsland  September  stThe British appeared to be encamped in several places on LongIsland They had run a ship in between Nutten Island and Red Hook  dThey ran a ship past the city up the East River she was several times struck by the shot of a pounder which was drawn to the river's bank Major Crane of the artillery was wounded in the foot by a cannon shot from this ship It was now a question whether to defend the city or evacuate it and occupy the strong grounds above Every exertion had been made to render the works both numerous and strong and immense labour and expense had been bestowed on them and it was now determined that the city should be obstinately defended  thGen Washington came up and dined at our General's quarters The same day a detachment of the artillery with one pounder three pounders three pounders and a howitzer  joined the division The enemy were plundering cattle on LongIsland now fully in their possession  thOur General ordered a chain of videtts and centinels to be formed at Morrissania Hunt's and Frog's Point c The British were pressing a great number of teams on LongIslandtheir HeadQuarters were at Bedford  thThe militia on LongIsland were ordered to muster to raise recruits for the King The General Officers of the American army were in council at HeadQuarters in NewYork The British were now erecting a work nearly opposite to our's at Horn's Hook and the distance not great  thThe British opened their battery against Horn's Hook Fort The fire was briskly returned The Americans had one man killed and two wounded  thIn the morning there was a brisk cannonade on both sides At Horn's Hook the American artillery was so well plied that the British ceased firing The British were said to be encamped in three divisions one at Newton which was HeadQuarters one at Flushing and one at Jamaica  thThe British landed a number of troops on Montresors Island  thThe British continued to cannonade and bombard our fort at Horn's Hook and to land more troops on Montresors Island  thThe cannonade continued against our fort at Horn's Hook and the British were moving their troops towards the East River This day Col Ward's regiment of Connecticut troops removed from Burditt's Ferry and joined our General's division The General Officers were in council A former resolution to defend the city was rescinded with three dissentients  thFour British ships one of which was a twodecker ran by the city up the East River The  cannonade and bombardment at Horn's Hook continued This evening Col Chester with five regiments joined our General's division  thThe British sent three or four ships up the North River as far as Greenwich The cannon and stores were removing from NewYork during the night  thAbout noon the British landed at Kepps's Bay They met with but small resistance and pushed towards the city of which they took possession in the afternoon They availed themselves of some cannon and stores but their booty was not very great Here the Americans we are sorry to say did not behave well and here it was as fame hath said that Gen Washington threw his hat on the ground and exclaimed "Are these the men with which I am to defend America" But several things may have weight herethe wounds received on LongIsland were yet bleeding and the officers if not the men knew that the city was not to be defended Maj Chapman was killed and Brig Maj Wyllis was taken prisoner A few others were killed wounded and taken prisoners The Americans retreated up the island and some few who could not get out of the city that way escaped in boats over to Paulus Hook across the river The house in the fort at Horn's Hook was set on fire by a shell and burnt down The fort was afterwards abandoned  thA little before noon a smart skirmish happened on the heights west of Haarlem Plain and south of Morris's house between a party of Hessian Yagers British LightInfantry and Highlanders and the American riflemen and some other troops which ended in favour of the latter The troops fought well on both sides and gave great proof of their marksmanship The Americans had several officers killed and wounded among the former Lieut  Col Knoulton of the Connecticut line and Capt Gleason of Nixon's Massachusetts regiment two excellent officers and Maj Beech of one of the southern regiments a brave officer was among the latter This skirmish might have brought on a general action for both armies were then within supporting distance of the troops which were engaged  It now became an object of high importance to calculate if possible where the British would make their next attempt and here the General Officers were divided in opinion A part of them imagined that the British would first endeavour to make themselves masters of the whole of NewYork Island and that therefore the reduction of Fort Washington and its dependencies would be their object Others supposed that they would make a landing either at Morrissania Hunt's or Frog's Point which eventually would produce as certain a reduction of the works on the island with very little loss to the British It was therefore determined in council to guard against both and for this purpose men were to be retained on the island at and near Fort Washington Our General's division was to be augmented to men and a floating bridge was to be thrown across Haarlem Creek that these two bodies might communicate with and support each other as circumstances might require and MajorGen Greene was to command the flying camp on the Jersey side of the Hudson which was to consist of The different arrangements took place accordingly  thThe remains of Lieut Col Knoulton were interred with military honours The same day a troop of militia lighthorse arrived from Connecticut others and many of the militia were on their way to join the army  thGen Parsons's and Scott's brigades and the brigade commanded by Col Dudley Sargent  joined our General's division and Shee's Magaw's Haslett's Atlee's and Broadhead's battalions were ordered away The British army encamped between the American army and the city  A picket from our General's division of men constantly mounted by relief at Morrissania from which a chain of centinels within half gunshot of each other were planted from the one side of the shore to the other and near the water passage between Morrissania and Montresors Island which in some places is very narrow The centinels on the American side were ordered not to presume to fire at those of the British unless the latter began but the British were so fond of beginning that there was frequently a firing between them This having been the case one day and a British officer walking along the bank on the Montresors side an American centinel who had been exchanging some shots with a British centinel seeing the officer and concluding him to be better game gave him a shot and wounded him He was carried up to the house on the island An officer with a flag soon came down to the creek and called for the American officer of the picket and informed him that if the American centinels fired any more the commandingofficer on the island would cannonade Col Morris's house in which the officers of the picket quartered The American officer immediately sent up to our General to know what answer should be returned He was directed to inform the British officer that the American centinels had always been instructed not to fire on  centinels  unless they were first fired upon and then to return the fire that such would be their conduct as to the cannonading of Col Morris's house they might act their pleasure The firing ceased for some time but a raw Scotch centinel having been planted one day he very soon after discharged his piece at an  American centinel nearest to him which was immediately returned upon which a British officer came down and called to the American officers observing that he thought there was to be no firing between the centinels He was answered that their own began upon which he replied "He shall then pay for it" The centinel was directly after relieved and there was no firing between the centinels at that place any more and they were so civil to each other on their posts that one day at a part of the creek where it was practicable the British centinel asked the American who was nearly opposite to him if he could give him a chew of tobacco the latter having in his pocket a piece of a thick twisted roll sent it across the creek to the British centinel who after taking off his bite sent the remainder back again  thThe Commander in Chief Maj Gen Putnam and some other officers came up to our General's division and rode round the camp which by the return given in on the next day consisted of but of these there was sick present and sick absent  On the morning of the st between one and two o'clock the light of a great fire was discovered to the southward which proved to be at NewYork when a considerable part of the city was consumed  dTwo seamen belonging to the La Brune a British ship of war which lay near Montresors Island deserted and came to our General's quarters and informed him upon examination that the British had then but a few men on the island stating the number that the piece of cannon which had been put on the island was taken back again on board the La Brune that there were a number of officers at the house in which there was a considerable quantity of baggage deposited c Our General supposed that these troops might be easily taken  and having called the General Officers of his division together took their opinion who all coincided with him in sentiment He then communicated his intention to the Commander in Chief who gave it his approbation Two hundred and forty men were destined for this enterprise the command was given to Lieut Col Michael Jackson of the Massachusetts line with Majors Logan and whose name cannot be recollected of the NewYork troops They were to embark on board three flatboats covered by a fourth with a detachment of artillery with a light threepounder in case it should be found necessary in retreating from the island The mode of attack was settled and every circumstance secured to promise success They were to fall down Haarlem Creek with the ebb The time was so calculated that the young flood was to be so much made at the break of day as to cover the flats at the island sufficiently for the boats to float Matters being thus settled our General ordered the two sailors to be brought in he then told them that in consequence of their information an enterprise against the British troops on Montresors Island was to take place that night that he had ordered them to be kept in safe custody until the next morning when if their declarations respecting the state of the British on the island proved to be true he would give them a passport to the back country whither they wished to go but in case their information was false he would order them hanged immediately as spies that he gave them the opportunity if they had made a wrong statement to him then to correct it They both answered with perfect composure that they would cheerfully submit to the condition Major Thomas Henly was now one of our General's Aidsdecamp He importuned that he might go with the detachment He was refused and told that he had no business  there that he could exercise no command He grew quite impatient returned again to the General's room and addressed him "Pray Sir consent to my going with the partylet me have the pleasure of introducing the prisoners to you tomorrow" All his friends present advised him not to go The General finally consented The troops at the hour assigned embarked Our General informed them that he with others would be spectators of the scene from a certain point near Haarlem Creek Notice had been given to the guards and pickets on the  York Island  side not to hail the party as they went down Unfortunately the lower centinel had not been so instructed He was nearly opposite to the point where our General was to be and just at the instant when he arrived had challenged the boats and ordered them to come to the shore From the boats they answered "Lo we are friends" The challenge was repeated The answer was "We tell you we are friendshold your tongue" A bounce into the water was heard and instantly Maj Henly came wading to the shore stepped up to our General catched him by the hand and said "Sir will it do" Our General holding him by the hand replied "I see nothing to the contrary" to which Henly concluded by saying  "Then it shall do"  He waded back to his boat and got in The centinel called again "If you don't come to the shore I tell you I'll fire" A voice from some one in the boats was  "Pull away"  The boats went on and the centinel fired his piece The boats reached the island almost at the moment intended just as the glimmer of the dawn was discoverable The three fieldofficers were in the first boats Their intention on the moment of landing was for the two seconds in command to spring the one to the right and the other to the left and lead on the troops from the other  two boats which were to land on each side of the first boat The fieldofficers landed and the men from their boat The enemy's guard charged them but were instantly driven back The men in the other two boats instead of landing lay upon their oars The British seeing this returned warmly to the charge The Americans finding themselves thus deserted returned to their boat but not until Lieut Col Jackson received a musketball in his leg and Maj Henly as he was getting into the boat one through his heart which put an instant end to his life The boat joined the others and they all returned having in the whole about killed wounded and missing Maj Henly deeply regretted Had only one of the other boats landed her men the success would have been very probable but the two would have insured an execution of the whole plan in the opinion of all concerned The delinquents in the other boats were arrested and tried by courtmartial and one of the Captains cashiered  On the night of the d the British got possession of the works at Paulus Hook The Americans had previously taken off all the cannon and stores On the afternoon of the th the remains of Maj Henly were interred by the side of Lieut Col Knoulton on NewYork Island with military honours  thThe militia which had come out from the western parts of the State of Connecticut were discharged  thThe General Officers were in council with a committee of Congress sent to make inquiry into the condition of the army and agree upon the necessary augmentation  thThe Council set again The same day Maj Gen Sullivan who had for some time been a prisoner with the British came to HeadQuarters The American prisoners which were taken in Canada  were sent round by water and landed at Bergen Point NewJersey where they were set at liberty Gen Thompson was among them  thSeven recruits for Maj Rogers's corps raising for British service were taken going to LongIsland and sent in  thThere was an unusual movement of boats from LongIsland to Montresors Island and an attack was soon expected  thThe moving over of boats to Montresors Island continued The same day a frigate went through Hell Gate and came to anchor about o'clock A M near the La Brune At o'clock she came to sail and stood to the eastward Just at evening another ship came up and the next morning  October  st was at anchor in the channel between Haarlem and Baman's or Eldridge's Island  dThe BrigadierGenerals of our General's division were in council and several new works were laid out among others a redoubt on the hill above  Williams's Bridge  Our General in reconnoitring his position accompanied by Col  Hand  below the camp of the rifle corps being apprehensive that the British might land on Frog's Neck took a view of the causeway between WestChester and the point Upon the neck which runs between these two is a tidemill and a plank bridge at the mill at the west end of the causeway the side of the American army was at this time a range of cordwood as advantageously situated to cover a party to defend the pass as if constructed for the very purpose After taking a full view our General directed Col Hand immediately upon his return to his camp to fix upon one of the best subaltern officers and picked men of his corps and assign them to this pass as their alarmpost at all times and in case the enemy made a landing on Frog's Neck to direct  this officer immediately to take up the planks of the bridge to have every thing in readiness to set the mill on fire but not to do it unless the fire of the riflemen should appear insufficient to check the advance of the enemy on to the causeway to assign another party to the head of the creek to reinforce both in case the enemy landed and that he should be supported Col Hand made his arrangements accordingly  thThe brig and tenders in the East River came down and cast anchor near the La Brune frigate and the Roebuck and Phenix sailed up the North River and joined the other ships which lay at anchor there  thThere were some movements among the British and a party appeared to be very busy at work a little below Haarlem The same night the Americans left the heights of Bergen They were upwards of strong They retreated as far back as Burditt's Ferry  thOrders were given for throwing up a new work on Haarlem Creek below the wood at Morrissania  thGen  Lincoln  came to camp He had come from Massachusetts with a body of militia This was the first of his joining the main army The same day the British were putting over horses from Horn's Hook to LongIsland and fixing their pontoons  thEarly in the morning three ships two of guns and one frigate with two or three tenders stood up the North River They were briskly cannonaded from Fort Washington and Fort Constitution They however passed our works and the  chevauxdefrise  the American galleys small craft and two large ships standing on before them The two ships were ran on shore near Phillips's mills  and two of the galleys near Dobb's Ferry The enemy took possession of the two galleys and got them off A boat landed a number of men who plundered a store stove the casks and then set the store on fire and left it The Americans soon extinguished the fire  Our General ordered Col Sargent with infantry lighthorse Capt Horton of the artillery with two pounders and Capt Crafts with a howitzer to march immediately with all possible expedition to Dobb's Ferry The enemy took a schooner loaded with rum sugar wine c and sunk a sloop which had on board the machine invented by and under the direction of a Mr  Bushnell  intended to blow up the British ships This machine was worked under water It conveyed a magazine of powder which was to be fixed under the keel of a ship then freed from the machine and left with clockwork going which was to produce fire when the machine had got out of the way Mr Bushnell had great confidence of its success and had made several experiments which seemed to give him countenance but its fate was truly a contrast to its design  Our General's division was formed in line with its advance reserve flankguards and artillery all in order of battle when they were moved down over the different grounds which it was supposed might be the scene of action Some of this ground was very broken and there were many fences These afforded frequent opportunities for the troops to break off and form for the pioneers to open avenues c and for the whole to become acquainted with every part of the ground and the best choice of it if suddenly called to action  thOne of the ships which was ran aground was got off by the Americans Col Sargent returned having left men to watch the motions of the British up the river  thThere was a considerable movement among the British boats below This afternoon Gen Washington's pleasureboat coming down the river with a fresh breeze and a topsail hoisted was supposed by the artillerists at Mount Washington to be one of the British tenders running down A pounder was discharged at her which was so exactly pointed as unfortunately to kill three Americans who were much lamented The same day several of Gen Lincoln's regiments arrived two of which were posted on the North River  thEarly in the morning or British boats full of men stood up the sound from Montresors Island LongIsland c The troops landed at Frog's Neck and their advance pushed towards the causeway and bridge at WestChester mill Col Hand's riflemen took up the planks of the bridge as had been directed and commenced a firing with their rifles The British moved towards the head of the creek but found here also the Americans in possession of the pass Our General immediately as he had assured Col Hand he would do ordered Col Prescott the hero of Bunker Hill with his regiment and Capt Lieut Bryant of the artillery with a pounder to reinforce the riflemen at WestChester causeway and Col Graham of the NewYork line with his regiment and Lieut Jackson of the artillery with a pounder to reinforce at the head of the creek all of which was promptly done to the check and disappointment of the enemy The British encamped on the neck The riflemen and Yagers kept up a scattering popping at each other across the marsh and the Americans on their side and the British on the other threw up a work at the end of the causeway Capt Bryant now and then when there was an object saluted the British with a fieldpiece  In the afternoon or sail of vessels passed up and came to anchor off Frog's Point The same evening Gen M'Dougal's brigade joined our General's division  thThe brigade formerly under the command of our General when he was Brigadier joined his division The division now became very strong The General Officers of the army were this day in council at our General's Quarters  thOur General with the Generals under his command reconnoitred the enemy at Frog's Neck afterwards the General Officers of the army reconnoitred the various grounds The same day Maj Gen Lee was ordered to the command of the troops above Kingsbridge now become the largest part of the American army But Gen Washington had desired him not to exercise the command for a day or two until he could make himself acquainted with the post its circumstances and arrangements of duty A great number of sloops boats c were passing the sound eastward just at duskprobably conveying ammunition provisions c to the troops at Frog's Point  thFive sailors came off from the La Brune They informed that there was a large body of the British on Frog's Point and that an attack might be soon expected The scattering fire across the marsh continued and now and then a man was killed  thTwo works were discovered on Frog's Neck nearly finished The General Officers of the army rode to reconnoitre the ground at  Pell's Neck  c and it was determined that the position of the American army should be immediately changed the left flank to be extended more northerly to prevent its being turned by the British  thWadsworth's and Fellows's brigades came to Kingsbridge The British shipping c continued moving eastward  thThe regiment at WestChester causeway had been relieved by another The officer on command there this morning sent up an express to our General informing him that the British were opening an embrasure in their work at the end of the causeway and that he apprehended they intended under a cannonade from this to attempt to pass Our General ordered one of his Aids to gallop his horse to the officer commanding the brigade near Volentine's the nearest to WestChester and order him to form his brigade instantly Arriving himself by the time the brigade was formed he ordered the officer to march with the utmost expedition to the head of the causeway to reinforce the troops there himself moving on with them When the troops had advanced to about half the way between the head of the creek and the post at the head of the causeway another express met him informing him that the whole British army were in motion and seemed to be moving towards the pass at the head of the creek Upon this the brigade was ordered to halt the whole to prime and load and the rear regiment to file off by the left and march briskly to reinforce the Americans at the pass at the head of the creek At this instant Gen Washington came up and having inquired of our General the state of things ordered him to return immediately and have his division formed ready for action and to take such a position as might appear best calculated to oppose the enemy should they attempt to land another body of troops on Morrissania which he thought not improbable Our General immediately obeyed the order  The wind was now fresh at southwest The British crossed to the other side of Frog's Neck embarked on board their boats crossed over the cove landed on Pell's Neck and moved briskly upwards  Three or four of the American regiments advanced towards them and took a good position behind a stone fence When the British had advanced sufficiently near they gave them a pretty close fire which checked them and even obliged them to fall back but being immediately supported they returned vigorously to the charge The action was sharp for a short time but the Americans were soon obliged to give way to superior force  Shepard's Read's Baldwin's  and  Glover's  regiments had the principal share in this action The Americans had between and men killed and wounded among the latter Col Shepard in the throat not mortally although the ball came well nigh effecting instant death The loss of the British was not known but must have been considerable They advanced almost to New Rochelle and halted The American army extended its left  A number of boats went down towards NewYork It now became necessary immediately to quit the position in the neighbourhood of Kingsbridge the British being in the rear of the left of our army and it is not a little unaccountable that they did not attempt to stretch themselves across to the Hudson which might have been done with great ease They only moved higher up on the other side of the little rivulet  Brunx  which was generally fordable The White Plains were fixed upon for the next position of the American army A strong garrison was to be left at Fort Washington and our General was to leave one of his regiments to garrison Fort Independence  stAt about o'clock P M our General's division moved from above Kingsbridge having besides their light fieldpieces two heavy iron twelvepounders About o'clock in the evening they passed Gen Lincoln's quarters on Volentine's Hill  where the Commander in Chief was to spend the night Our General waited upon him to know if he had any particular commands for him The Commander in Chief only advised to send forward one of his regiments to occupy the road coming from  Ward's Bridge  nearly to whose farm the British had now advanced left apprised of his moving they should annoy his right flank which if it had been daylight would have been open to their view But before the column reached this cross road it was learnt that Col Jonathan Brewer's regiment of artificers who were pretty strong and well armed were to pass the night at the entrance of the road leading to the bridge before mentioned The division reached Chaderton's Hill to the south of White Plains at o'clock in the morning of the d having marched all night The instant our General ascended the hill he noticed to appearance many flashes resembling the flash of the pan of a musket on the other side of the lot on which he immediately ordered a Captain with a party to discover what it was who returned that he could not make discovery of any thing These were indeed the flashes of discharged muskets at some distance the height of ground having decoyed the appearance of the distance Lord Sterling who was before in this vicinity with his brigade had formed an enterprise against Maj Rogers's corps The old Indian hunter in the last French war who had now engaged in the British service with his corps now lay on the outpost of the British army near Marroneck The enterprise was conducted with good address and if the Americans had known exactly how Rogers's corps lay they would probably have killed or taken the whole As it was prisoners muskets and some other articles were taken The Major conformably to his former general conduct escaped  with the rest of his corps This was a pretty affair and if the writer could recollect the name of the commandingofficer with pride and pleasure he would insert it He belonged to one of the southern lines of the army and the whole of the party were southern troops  The same day our General moved his division and took post on the high strong ground to the north of the courthouse Gen Sullivan's division reached the Plains in the course of the succeeding night In the position of White Plains our General's division was on the left of the line On his left was a deep hollow through which ran a small brook which came from a millpond a little above On the east side of this hollow was a very commanding ground which would enfilade the division The top of this high ground was covered with wood To this hill he ordered Col Malcolm with his regiment of NewYork troops and Lieut Fenno of the artillery with a fieldpiece directing them to take post in the skirt of the wood at the south brow of the hill The ground from our General's left to the right descended gradually a very considerable distance and then gradually ascended up to the plain and still on to the right to more commanding ground On this was the American army formed the line running nearly from northeast to southwest There were some strong works thrown up on the plain across the road and still to the right of it Chaderton's Hill was a little advanced of the line and separated from it by the little rivulet Brunx A body of the Americans were posted on this hill HeadQuarters were on the plain near the cross roads Our General's division had only slight works for musketry  dA cannonade was heard towards the Hudson The same evening Col Tyler's Huntington's  and Throop's regiments of General Parsons's brigade and of our General's division moved and took post at the head of Kingstreet near Rye Pond Gen Lee's division had not yet got up to the army  thAt o'clock A M a firing of smallarms was heard to the southward It was a skirmish between men of Gen Lee's division and Hessians of the latter were killed and two taken prisoners The British continued moving up but with great caution their rear scarcely advancing when they came to encamp again much further than where the advance had moved fromthey advanced in two columns  thEight American regiments were ordered to be ready to march in the approaching night Gen Putnam was to command them and they were intended to make an attack on the enemy's advance if it should appear to be practicable The same morning one pounder at Dobb's Ferry drove the British manofwar off that place from her station  thGen Lee's division jointed the army In ascending some of the hills on the road this division encumbered with many waggons was obliged to halt and double the teams in open view of the British and at no considerable distance who did not attempt to disturb them which had they done the loss of the cannon waggons c could not have been avoided The troops would have bent their march unencumbered towards the Hudson but the waggons c must have been left Two or three British soldiers and a Hessian were taken prisoners and sent in  thIn the forenoon a heavy cannonade was heard towards Fort Washington Thirteen Hessians and two or three British soldiers were sent in on this day From the American camp to the westsouth  west there appeared to be a very commanding height worthy of attention The Commander in Chief ordered the General Officers who were off duty to attend him to reconnoitre this ground on this morning When arrived at the ground although very commanding it did not appear so much so as other grounds to the north and almost parallel with the left of the army as it was then formed "Yonder" says MajorGen Lee pointing to the grounds just mentioned "is the ground we ought to occupy" "Let us then go and view it" replied the Commander in Chief When on the way a lighthorseman came up in full gallop his horse almost out of breath and addressed Gen Washington"The British are on the camp Sir" The General observed"Gentlemen we have now other business than reconnoitring" putting his horse in full gallop for the camp and followed by the other officers When arrived at HeadQuarters the AdjutantGeneral Read who had remained at camp informed the Commander in Chief that the guards had been all beat in and the whole American army were now at their respective posts in order of battle The Commander in Chief turned round to the officers and only said "Gentlemen you will repair to your respective posts and do the best you can" Our General on arriving at his own division found them all in the lines and from the height of his post found that the first attack was directed against the Americans on Chaderton's Hill The little river Brunx which ran between the American right and this hill after running round its north side turned and ran down on the east and southeast The British advanced in two columns At this instant the cannonade was brisk on both sides directed by the British across the hollow and Brunx against the Americans on the hill and by them returned Almost  at the same instant the right column composed of British troops preceded by about lighthorse in full gallop and brandishing their swords appeared on the road leading to the courthouse and now directly in the front of our General's division The lighthorse leaped the fence of a wheatfield at the foot of the hill on which Col Malcolm's regiment was posted of which the lighthorse were not aware until a shot from Lieut Fenno's fieldpiece gave them notice by striking in the midst of them and a horseman pitching from his horse They then wheeled short about galloped out of the field as fast as they came in rode behind a little hill in the road and faced about the tops of their caps only being visible to our General where he stood The column came no further up the road but wheeled to the left by platoons as they came up and passing through a bar or gateway directed their head towards the troops on Chaderton's Hill now engaged When the head of the column had got nearly across the lot their front got out of sight nor could the extent of their rear be now discovered The sun shone bright their arms glittered and perhaps troops never were shewn to more advantage than these now appeared The whole now halted and for a few minutes the men all sat down in the same order in which they stood no one appearing to move out of his place The cannonade continued brisk across the Brunx A part of the left column composed of British and Hessians forded the river and marched along under the cover of the hill until they had gained sufficient ground to the left of the Americans when by facing to the left their column became a line parallel with the Americans When they briskly ascended the hill the first column resumed a quick march As the troops which were advancing to the attack ascended the hill the cannonade on the side of the  British ceased as their own men became exposed to their fire if continued The fire of smallarms was now very heavy and without any distinction of sounds This led some American officers who were looking on to observe that the British were worsted as their cannon had ceased firing but a few minutes evinced that the Americans were giving way They moved off the hill in a great body neither running nor observing the best order The British ascended the hill very slowly and when arrived at its summit formed and dressed their line without the least attempt to pursue the Americans The loss on the side of the Americans was inconsiderable that of the British was not then known The British having got possession of this hill it gave them a vast advantage of the American lines almost down to the centre  thThe British began to throw up some small works on the hill of which they had got possession The Americans were drawing back and a position was to be taken on the high strong grounds before in the rear of a part of the army The left of our General's division was not to move but the remainder of his division and all the other divisions of the army were to fall back and form nearly east and west About this time Col Lasher who belonged to our General's division and who had been lest with his regiment to garrison Fort Independence near Kingsbridge sent an express who passed the enemy in the night to know what he should do the regiment growing weak and sickly Our General applied to the Commander in Chief to know his pleasure who directed that the Colonel should give notice to Col Magaw who commanded at Fort Washington that he might take away the cannon stores c and that Col Lasher after destroying the barracks huts c should join the army which he  soon effected This day prisoners were sent in and the Americans were now throwing up some strong works on the high grounds  thThe British remained upon the ground they had taken  stThe British continued as before throwing up a work c At night the Americans evacuated their works on the plain near late HeadQuarters setting fire to several barns and one house which contained forage and some stores that could not be removed  November  stIn the morning the British advanced with a number of fieldpieces to the north of the road near late HeadQuarters a heavy column appearing behind on the hill ready to move forward and commenced a furious cannonade on our General's division which was nobly returned by Capt Lieut Bryant and Lieut Jackson of the artillery Our General's first anxiety was for Col Malcolm's regiment on the hill to the east of the hollow on the left lest the enemy should push a column into the hollow and cut the regiment off from the division He therefore ordered Maj Keith one of his Aids to gallop over and order Col Malcolm to come off immediately with Lieut Fenno's artillery But upon a more critical view of the ground in the hollow at the head of which there was a heavy stone wall well situated to cover a body of troops to throw a heavy fire directly down it while an oblique fire could be thrown in on both sides he ordered Maj Pollard his other aid to gallop after Keith and countermand the first order and direct the Colonel to remain at his post and he should be supported A strong regiment was ordered to the head of the hollow to occupy the wall The cannonade was brisk on both sides through which the two Aidsdecamp passed in going and returning  At this instant Gen Washington rode up to the hill His first question to our General was "H  is your division" He was answered "They are all in order" "Have you" said the Commander in Chief "any troops on the hill over the hollow" He was answered "Malcolm's regiment is there" "If you do not call them off immediately" says the General "you may lose them if the enemy push a column up the hollow" He was answered that even in that case their retreat should be made safe that a strong regiment was posted at the head of the hollow behind the wall that this regiment with the oblique fire of the division would so check the enemy as to allow Malcolm to make a safe retreat The Commander in Chief concluded by saying "Take care that you do not lose them" The artillery of the division was so well directed as to throw the British artillerymen several times into confusion and finding that they could not here make any impression drew back their pieces the column not advancing The British artillery now made a circuitous movement and came down toward the American right Here unknown to them were some pounders upon the discharge of which they made off with their fieldpieces as fast as their horses could draw them A shot from the American cannon at this place took off the head of a Hessian artilleryman They also left one of the artillery horses dead on the field What other loss they sustained was not known Of our General's division one man only belonging to Col Paulding's regiment of NewYork troops was killed The British made no other attempt on the Americans while they remained at White Plains The two armies lay looking at each other and within long cannonshot In the night time the British lighted up a vast number of fires the weather growing pretty cold These fires some on the level  ground some at the foot of the hills and at all distances to their brows some of which were lofty seemed to the eye to mix with the stars and to be of different magnitudes The American side doubtless exhibited to them a similar appearance On this day our General ordered three redoubts with a line in front to be thrown up on the summit of his post so constructed that the whole of them could make a defence and support each other at the same time if attacked These to the enemy in whose view they fully were must have appeared very formidable although they were designed principally for defence against smallarms and perhaps works were never raised quicker There were the stalks of a large cornfield at the spot the pulling these up in hills took up a large lump of earth with each The roots of the stalks and earth on them placed in the face of the works answered the purpose of sods or facines The tops being placed inwards as the loose earth was thrown upon them became as so many ties to the work which was carried up with a dispatch scarcely conceivable  The British as they say had meditated an attack on the Americans which was only prevented by the wetness of the night Be this as it may our General had ordered his division at evening rollcall to be at their alarmposts which they every morning manned whilst at this place half an hour sooner than usual He had then no other reason for doing this than the near position of the enemy and the probability that they would soon make an attack But the Commander in Chief must have made some other discovery for after our General was in bed Col Carey who was one of the Aidsdecamp of Gen Washington came to the door of his marque and calling to him informed him that the whole army were to be at their alarmposts the next morning  half an hour sooner than usual and that he was to govern himself accordingly Our General replied that he had fortunately given such orders to his division at evening rollcall He therefore neither got up himself nor disturbed any other of his division  Stedman  mistakes greatly in his history where in vol I page he asserts that the Americans "evacuated their lines on the morning of the  first  and retired across the Croten River to NorthCastle setting fire in their retreat to all the houses on White Plains" The Americans did not quit their strong position at the  back  of White Plains until the British had retreated towards Kingsbridge as far as Dobb's Ferry and had there encamped as is fully shewn in these Memoirs  dThe centinels reported that during the preceding night they heard the rumbling of carriages to the southeastward and it was apprehended that the British were changing their position  thThe British centinels were withdrawn from their advanced posts It was apprehended that they meant a movement The American army was immediately ordered under arms At o'clock P M the enemy appeared formed on Chaderton's Hill and on several hills to the westward of it Several reconnoitring parties who were sent out reported that the enemy were withdrawing About o'clock this night a party of the Americans wantonly set fire to the courthouse Dr Graham's house and several other private houses which stood between the two armies This gave great disgust to the whole American army and drew from the Commander in Chief the following paragraph in his orders of the th "It is with the utmost astonishment and abhorrence the General is informed that some base and cowardly wretches have last night set fire to the courthouse and other buildings which the enemy left The army may rely upon it that they shall be brought to justice and meet with the punishment they deserve"  The British were moving down towards Dobb's Ferry A detachment from the American army was sent out in the morning to harass their rear but could not come up with them  thSeveral deserters came in from the enemy they reported that they were removing towards NewYork The reconnoitring parties discovered them encamped near Dobb's Ferry They were foraging grain and hay and driving in the cattle Two storeships had run up past Fort Washington  thThe enemy continued encamped at and below Dobb's Ferry A new disposition of the American army was now to take place The southern troops were to cross over into the Jersies Gen Lee with his own Spencer's and Sullivan's divisions were to remain to secure and bring off the stores and were then to follow into the Jersies Our General was ordered to march with his division to Peek's Kill  thThe division moved from near White Plains and the same night halted at NorthCastle  thIn the afternoon the division reached Peck's Kill Gen Washington arrived at the same place about sunset It was this day learnt that Gen Carleton's army in Canada after pushing the Americans in that quarter from post to post until they arrived at Ticonderoga just made their appearance before that place and then retired towards Quebec  thThe Commander in Chief directed our General to attend him in taking a view of Fort Montgomery and the other works up the river Lord Sterling Generals James and George Clinton Gen Mifflin and others were of the company They went as far up the river as Constitution Island which is opposite to WestPoint the latter of which was not then taken possession of but the glance of the eye at it without going on shore evinced that this  post was not to be neglected There was a small work and a blockhouse on Constitution Island Fort Montgomery was in considerable forwardness  thThe Commander in Chief directed our General to ride early in the morning with him to reconnoitre the grounds at the Gorge of the Highlands and on his return gave him the command of the troops and posts in the Highlands on both sides of the river with written instructions to secure and fortify them with all possible expedition making a distribution of his troops to the different posts and at about o'clock A M Gen Washington crossed over the river into the Jersies  thOur General made a disposition of the troops under his command to their several destinations Col Huntington's and Tyler's regiments to the west side of the Hudson to Sidnum's Bridge on Ramapaugh River to cover the passes into the Highlands on that side Prescott's Ward's and Wyllis's regiments of Parsons's brigade as were the other two regiments to the south entrance of the Highlands beyond Robinson's Bridge Gen George Clinton's brigade to the heights above Peek's Kill Landing Gen Scott's brigade with the three regiments of Gen Parsons's brigade Gen James Clinton with the troops under his command were at the forts up the river The British moved down near to Kingsbridge  On the th the British made their attack on Fort Washington Gen Knyphausen with a heavy column of Hessians advanced by Kingsbridge They were discovered by the Americans from the high grounds north of Fort Washington as the day broke and cannonaded from the fieldpieces placed at this advanced post The Hessian column divided into two the right ascending the strong broken ground towards SpittenDevil Creek the left nearer  to the road towards the Gorge The first obtained the ground without much difficulty but the Americans made a most noble opposition against the latter and for a considerable time kept them from ascending the hill making a terrible slaughter among them but the great superiority of the assailants with an unabating firmness finally prevailed their loss was greater here than at any other place Meanwhile the British crossed Haarlem Creek in two different places charged and finally routed the Americans on that side and possessed themselves of the strong post of Laurel Hill on the other side of the road from Fort Washington and not very distant from it Lord Percy at the same time advancing with the troops under his command on the island towards the fort on that side The Americans now generally driven from their outworks retired to the fort which was crowded full A single shell now dropping among them must have made dreadful havock  Gen Washington was now a spectator of this distressing scene from the high bank at Fort Lee on the opposite side of the Hudson and having a wish to communicate something to Col Magaw the commanding officer at Fort Washington Capt Gooch of Boston a brave and daring man offered to be the bearer of it He ran down to the river jumped into a small boat pushed over the river landed under the bank ran up to the fort and delivered the messagecame out ran and jumped over the broken ground dodging the Hessians some of whom struck at him with their pieces and others attempted to thrust him with their bayonetsescaping through them he got to his boat and returned to Fort Lee The British had summoned Col Magaw to surrender and were preparing their batteries to play on the fort when Col Magaw thought it best to surrender the post which he did accordingly between two and  three thousand men becoming prisoners The loss in killed and wounded on the American side was inconsiderable but the loss in prisoners was a serious blow indeed The prisoners were marched to NewYork where being crowded in prisons and sugarhouses many of them being militia from the Jersey flyingcamp who had been sent over to reinforce the garrison and were unused to a soldier's life much less to the poisonous stagnant air of a crowded prison they fell sick and daily died in a most shocking manner It was common on a morning for the carmen to come and take away the bodies for burial  by loads  O ye officers of the provost to whatever nation or people you belong when the unfortunate of your fellowmen are thus committed to your charge clothe yourselves with humanity and soothe distress as far as in your power for by this you will secure a better reward than your present wages And you who have the honour to command armies when your victories have filled provosts and prisons think it not beneath you to visit the prisons that with your own eyes you may see the state of your prisoners for such  visits  the great CAPTAIN OF YOUR SALVATION hath said shall be considered as made to Himself while it also gives you a name among men closely allied to that of the conqueror The truly brave are always humane  Elated with the easy reduction of Fort Washington the British determined to cross into the Jersies and attack Gen Washington on that side  On the th Lord Cornwallis with a strong body of the British forces landed at Closter Landing on the Jersey side above Fort Lee the garrison of which were obliged to leave that post and some cannon stores and provisions which could not be removed fell into the hands of the enemy  thJust at evening an express which our General had sent down to Gen Washington before he had any knowledge of what had happened returned with a most alarming account of what he had seen with his own eyes viz that the Americans were rapidly retreating and the British as rapidly pursuing The AdjutantGeneral Read wished to write to Gen Lee but he had neither pen ink or paper with him The lighthorseman had a rough piece of wrappingpaper in his pocket and the AdjutantGeneral had an old pencil Bringing these two together he wrote to Gen Lee"Dear General we are flying before the British I pray"and the pencil broke He then told the lighthorseman to carry the paper to Gen Lee and tell him that he was verbally ordered to add after  I pray  "you to push and join us" The lighthorseman when he arrived at our General's was both fatigued and wet He requested that one of his brother horsemen might proceed to Gen Lee but he was told that no other could discharge the duty enjoined on him by the AdjutantGeneral and that Gen Lee might wish to make many inquiries of him He was therefore refreshed and pushed on Gen Lee instead of moving his division or any part of it wrote our General by the returning express the following letter  CAMP  Nov st    DEAR GENERAL  I HAVE just received a recommendation not a positive order from the General to move the corps under my command to the other side of the river This recommendation was I imagine on the presumption that I had already moved nearer to Peek's Kill There is no possibility of crossing over Dobb's Ferry or at any place lower than King's Ferry which to us would be such an immense round that we  could never answer any purpose I must therefore desire and request that you will order of your corps under a BrigadierGeneral to cross the river opposite the General and wait his further orders As soon as we have finished a necessary job I will replace this number from hence which job will I believe be finished tomorrow  I am dear General your's Signed CHARLES LEE  Gen HEATH  Upon receiving this letter from Gen Lee for our General did not receive the least hint from Gen Washington to move any part of the troops under his command by the express who brought the order to Lee he took up his instructions from Gen Washington to see if he might dare to make any detachment upon which he wrote Gen Lee the following answer to his letter  PEEK'S KILL  Nov st  o'clock at night  DEAR GENERAL  I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favours of this date the former of which I had answered early in the evening With respect to the latter upon having recourse to my instructions I find they are such as not to admit of moving any part of the troops from the posts assigned to me unless it be by express orders from his Excellency or to support you in case you are attacked My instructions among other things are as follow  Your division with such troops as are now at Forts Montgomery Independence and Constitution are to be under your command and remain in this quarter for the security of the above posts and the passes through the Highlands from this place and the one on the west side of Hudson's  River Unnecessary it is for me to say any thing to evince the importance of securing the land and water communication through these passes or to prove the indispensable necessity of using every exertion in your power to have such works erected for the defence of them as your own judgment assisted by that of your Brigadiers and Engineer may shew the expediency of You will not only keep in view the importance of securing these passes but the necessity of doing it without delay not only from the probability of the enemy's attempting to seize them but from the advanced season which will not admit of any spadework after the frost which may daily be expected sets in  Lose not a moment therefore in choosing the grounds on the east and west side of the river on which your intended works are to be erected Let your men designed for each post be speedily allotted  c  After instructions so positive and pressing you will readily agree that it would be very improper in me to order any of the troops from posts to which they are so expressly assigned and from business which in his Excellency's view is so very important Add to this their present disposition is such that to collect any thing near the number you mention would occasion as great delay and cause many of them to march nearly as far as if sent immediately from your quarter  I am dear General with esteem Your's respectfully Signed W HEATH  Gen LEE  This did not seem to satisfy Gen Lee who wrote our General the following  CAMP  Nov d    SIR  BY your mode of reasoning the General's instructions are so binding that not a tittle must be broke through for the salvation of the General and the army I have ordered Glover's brigade to march up towards Peek's Kill to put the passage of the Highlands out of danger but I intend to take from your division with me into the Jersies so I must desire that you will have that number in readiness by the day after tomorrow when I shall be with you early in the forenoon  And am Sir Your most obedient servant Signed CHARLES LEE  Maj Gen HEATH  To which our General returned the following answer  PEEK'S KILL  Nov th    SIR  BE my mode of reasoning as it may I conceive it to be my duty to obey my instructions especially those which are positive and poignant and that to deviate from them even in extreme cases would be an error though perhaps an error on the right side  I can assure you Sir that I have the salvation of the General and army so much at heart that the least recommendation from him to march my division or any part of them over the river should have been instantly obeyed without waiting for a positive order  My conduct must be approved or censured as I adhere to or depart from my orders and as it is my duty I shall strictly abide by them until they are countermanded in such manner as will justify  a deviation from them to him who instructed me and to the world  I shall be happy in being honoured with your company tomorrow  And am with respect and esteem Your obedient humble servant Signed W HEATH  Gen LEE  After the foregoing was sent off our General reflected for a moment that as circumstances alter cases Gen Washington being now pressed and the army with him but feeble he might possibly wish for some aid from his division He therefore sat down and wrote him a short letter stating in what manner he had disposed of the troops under his command and wishing to know his pleasure whether any part of them should join him enclosing copies of the letters he had received from Gen Lee and of his answers The express was directed to make the utmost dispatch out and returning which he effected on the th several days before Gen Lee got up to Peek's Kill bringing with him the following letter from Secretary Harrison  NEWARK  Nov th    DEAR GENERAL  I AM directed by his Excellency to acknowledge his receipt of your letter of yesterday and to inform you the disposition of the troops mentioned in your former letter has his approbation  In respect to the troops intended to come to this quarter his Excellency never meant that they should be from your division He has wrote Gen Lee since so fully and explicitly upon the subject that any misapprehensions he may have been under at first must be now done away He will most probably  have reached Peek's Kill before now with his division and be pushing to join us No new event has taken place  I am Sir very respectfully Your most obedient servant Signed R H HARRISON  Maj Gen HEATH  stA heavy cannonade was heard towards Amboy  dCol Tupper who was down near Tappan got up to King's Ferry He brought off the two pounders which were at Dobb's Ferry and a quantity of provisions The same evening our General ordered the Washington Galley to take station at King's Ferry  thOur General gave orders for Clinton's and Scott's brigades to hold themselves in readiness to march to the Jersey side  thScott's brigade was ordered over to Haverstraw and Col Tyler's regiment then at Ramapaugh River to march down to Tappan to secure and bring off the provisions which were at that place  thCapt Treadwell of the artillery with a threepounder was ordered to move over the river and join Gen Scott's brigade It was learnt that many of the inhabitants of NewJersey especially in the neighbourhood of Hackensack were swearing allegiance to King George taking letters of protection c  thMr Livingston came from Congress to advise with our General on measures to obstruct the river The same day Capt Harrod brought off from Tappan a considerable quantity of pearlash beeswax oil c  thTwo of the regiments of Gen Clinton's brigade were ordered to move to Fort Constitution  in order to attempt the forming of obstructions in the river near Polipins Island  thJust before dinner Gen Sullivan arrived at our General's quarters and in the afternoon Gen Lee arrived He called at the door when our General waiting upon him requested him to alight he asked if he could have a cup of tea and was answered that he should have a good one Upon coming into the house before he sat down he wished to speak in private which being instantly granted he told our General that in a military view or to use his own words exactly "In  point of law  you are right but in point of policy I think you are wrong I am going into the Jersies for the salvation of America I wish to take with me a larger force than I now have and request you to order of your men to march with me" Our General answered that he could not spare that number He was then asked to order to which he replied that the business might be as well brought to a point at oncethat not a single man should march from the post by  his  order Gen Lee replied that he would then order them himself He was answered that there was a wide difference between the two that Gen Lee was acknowledged by our General to be his senior but as he had received positive written instructions from him who was superior to both he would not  himself  break those orders If Gen Lee was disposed to counteract them its being done by him could not be imputed to any other person and that he knew the Commander in Chief did not intend any of the troops should be removed from that posthaving expressed it not only in his instructions but also in a letter just received from him On the letter being shewn to Gen Lee he observed "The Commander in Chief is now at a distance and does not know what is necessary here so well as I do"asked if he might  be favoured with the returnbook of the division Major Huntington the Deputy AdjutantGeneral was directed to hand it Gen Lee ran his eye over it and said "I will take Prescott's and Wyllis's regiments"and turning to Major Huntington said "You will order those two regiments to march early tomorrow morning to join me" Our General turning to the Major said "Issue such orders at your peril" and then turning to Gen Lee addressed him "Sir if you come to this post and mean to issue orders here which will break those positive ones which I have received I pray you to do it completely yourself and through your own Deputy AdjutantGeneral who is present and not draw me or any of my family in as partners in the guilt" Gen Lee replied "It is right Col Scammel do you issue the order" which he did and Huntington communicated it to the regiments who were now posted at the Gorge of the mountains near Robinson's Bridge afterwards called the Continental Village Matters carried thus far our General turned to Gen Lee again "Sir I have one more request to make and that is that you will be pleased to give me a certificate that you  exercise command  at this post and do order from it Prescott's and Wyllis's regiments" Lee replied "I do not know that I will comply with your request" Gen Clinton who was present observed "Gen Lee you cannot refuse a request so reasonable" Upon which Gen Lee wrote as follows  PEEK'S KILL  Dec st    FOR the satisfaction of Gen Heath and at his request I do certify that I am commanding officer at this present writing in this post and that I have in that capacity ordered Prescott's and Wyllis's regiments to march  Signed CHARLES LEE Maj Gen  Gen Lee stepping out on the piazza observed to an officer "Gen Heath is right" Early the next morning the regiments moved from their cantonment towards Peek's Kill but before they had reached it Gen Lee now ready to pass into the Jersies rode up to our General's door and calling him observed "Upon further consideration I have concluded not to take the two regiments with meyou may order them to return to their former post" This conduct of Gen Lee's appeared not a little extraordinary and one is almost at a loss to account for it He had been a soldier from his youth had a perfect knowledge of service in all its branches but was rather obstinate in his temper and could scarcely brook being crossed in any thing in the line of his profession Gen Lee took with him into the Jersies some as good troops as any in the service but many of them were so destitute of shoes that the blood left on the rugged frozen ground in many places marked the route they had taken and a considerable number unable to march were left at Peek's Kill The time of service for which Gen Scott's brigade was engaged to serve expired when the whole except about went home notwithstanding the generous encouragement offered them by their State NewYork if they would continue one month longer  d and dGen Lee's troops were passing the ferry Gen Carleton having returned into Canada a number of Gen Gates's regiments were now moving to reinforce Gen Washingtontheir van as far as Morristownthe enemy as far as Brunswick  thIntelligence was received that on the th about sunset sail of ships of war and transports passed in the sound towards NewEngland Our General immediately sent off expresses to Gen Washington Gov Trumbull Mr Bowdoin at Boston the Convention of NewYork c  thThree regiments viz Greaton's Bond's and Porter's arrived off the landing from Albany on their way to Gen Washington Matters now looked serious in Jersey The British were extending themselves in all directions and the inhabitants obliged to become passive if not worse Gen Gates had ordered the troops moving from the northward to rendezvous at Goshen  thOur General wrote Gen Lee that the troops were moving on from the northward and as Gen Gates had not yet overtaken them some of the commandingofficers appeared to wish for orders how to proceed Gen Washington it was said was as far as TrentonLee the preceding night as far as Pompton A flag schooner came up from NewYork to obtain leave for some families to go in A Parson Inglish was on board Orders were given to treat the flag with politeness and at the same time with proper precaution and the business was laid before the Convention of the State  The same day Gen Clinton with two British and two Hessian brigades with a squadron of ships under the command of Sir Peter Parker took possession of RhodeIsland without the loss of a man the Americans quitting the island without making any opposition RhodeIsland was a great acquisition to the British for quarters forage and a safe harbour but lessened their ability for other more important operations in the field  On the evening of the th our General received orders from the Commander in Chief to move over the Hudson with Parsons's brigade and to move on so as to give protection to the country and vigour to the cause in Jersey  thA little after noon Parsons's brigade marched down to King's Ferry the greatest alertness having  been discovered by both officers and men on the occasion  thAbout eleven o'clock A M our General left Peek's Kill and proceeded for the Jersies on crossing King's Ferry gave orders for the flag to be detained from returning until further orders The troops crossed the ferry and marched as far as Col Hays' at Haverstraw Huntington's and Tyler's regiments were ordered to advance from Ramapaugh Bridge to Paramus Our General received a letter from Gen Lee in answer to the one he wrote on the th from Peek's Kill as follows  CHATHAM  Dec th    DEAR GENERAL  I AM very much obliged to you for your welcome tidings and have only to beg that you will direct the regiments you speak of to march without loss of time to Morristown I sent an express to you last night from the General ordering your division over the river which I confess for my own part I am heartily sorry for as I think we shall be strong enough without you and NewEngland with your district will be too bare of troops I am in hopes here to reconquer if I may so express myself the Jersies It was really in the hands of the enemy before my arrival  Adieu dear Sir Signed CHARLES LEE  Maj Gen HEATH  The foregoing letter appears very different from the former ones  thEarly in the morning the troops took up their line of march from Haverstraw and before sunset reached Tappan  thSent out a reconnoitring party towards Hackensack to get intelligence c This day Gen Lee was taken prisoner near Chatham by a party of lighthorse commanded by Col Harcourt Lee took quarters at a small distance from his troops an inhabitant gave notice of it to Col Harcourt who was out reconnoitring near that neighbourhood and who had the address to take and carry him off  thOur General held up every appearance of moving to Paramus and sent off his baggage under escort to that place and between and o'clock marched briskly for Hackensack having sent orders for Huntington's and Tyler's regiments to move from Paramus at the same time Buskirk's regiment was at Hackensack Bridge the preceding day where they did duty and it was expected they were still at the same place To surprise and take them was the object but it was found that Buskirk's men had moved the preceding day to Bergen in order to draw new arms The town was completely surprised not having an idea that any but British troops were near them One British soldier and or of their adherents were taken a number of arms c and at the wharf several vessels loaded with hay c on the point of sailing for NewYork A brig had come to sail in the morning and run some distance down the river and came to anchor An officer with a party was sent down to take her and bring her up but the wind was so strong ahead that it could not be effected The officer was then directed to destroy the vessel as she had a large quantity of forage on board destined for NewYork but it was said there were some valuable articles on board which might be taken out and brought up in the boats The orders were varied accordingly with directions that in case the enemy advanced before the business was completed to set the brig on  fire The boats brought up one load but on returning to the brig they discovered a body of the enemy advancing when the brig was abandoned without being set on fire The enemy immediately took possession of her Among the articles taken out was a large chest of plate This was conveyed to Peek's Kill and delivered to the Deputy QuarterMasterGeneral and when the British afterwards destroyed the public stores at that place the chest of plate was removed by the QuarterMaster into Connecticut where afterwards Gen Parsons in behalf of the officers and soldiers of the division filed a libel in the Maritime Court and the officer who boarded the vessel filed one in his own behalf On trial the Court adjudged the plate to the latter although he boarded the vessel in obedience to express orders About barrels of flour which had been abandoned by the Americans when they retreated before Lord Cornwallis were recovered and sent off and about arms were also secured with a quantity of rum gin c In the evening as two or three American officers were walking along the street a gentleman who was an inhabitant came up to them and expressed his joy on the arrival of the troops supposing they were British The officers immediately conducted him to our General and on entering the room informed him that they came to introduce a friend who had joined them in the street and who was able to give some important information Our General expressed a high satisfaction and wished to know what information he could give He replied that he heard there was a large body of rebels collecting up above them He was asked if in case these rebels should advance any assistance could be afforded by the people of the town and whether they could be depended on He answered there were a considerable number and that they  might be depended on He was asked whether there was not a number in the town who were in favour of the rebels He answered that there was but that they had seized and sent off the principal ones among them and that now the others dared not shew themselves The joke was thus going on when Col Prescott who stood near him holding his hat in his hand in which there was a  red cockade  at that time a mark of the distinction of rank the gentleman fixed his eye upon it and his countenance immediately fell He was then told that those whom he termed  rebels  were now in possession of the place and had now received his information He was ordered into custody  thAll the waggons in the vicinity were collected and the flour and other stores moved off to Paramus Reconnoitring parties were sent out to a distance to observe the motions of the enemy  thThe effects were generally removed and about noon the reconnoitring parties reported that the enemy were advancing on both sides of the place They were soon after discovered by the guard at Acquackanuck Bridge A little before sunset the troops left the town A strong rearguard was ordered to remain on the high ground back of the town until after dark to light up a number of fires and then to move on after the troops Just before the division left the town Gen George Clinton attended by some lighthorse joined the division  thReconnoitring parties were sent out on all the roads  thIntelligence was received that some of the Jersey militia had had a skirmish with a body of British troops under Gen Leslie near Springfield Both parties retired Of the militia several were killed and wounded  The Convention of NewYork greatly alarmed at the removal of our General with the continental troops from the important passes of the Highlands sent a request to Gen Washington desiring that they might be ordered back again To insure dispatch they offered the express extra pay The Commander in Chief was pleased to grant their request and ordered our General to return to Peek's Kill and reoccupy his former positions  Our General having received certain information that Buskirk's regiment was at or near Bergen Woods it was determined to strike them For this purpose on the evening of the th about o'clock Gen Parsons with continental troops and Gen Clinton with a like number of the militia of NewYork marched from Paramus church and a covering party of men was ordered to Tappan  About o'clock the next morning the detachment reached Bergen and completely surprised the enemy's guard making men prisoners The regiment was alarmed and a pretty brisk skirmish ensued The enemy were collecting and it was judged best for the detachment to come off having been so far victorious  thAbout o'clock P M the detachment returned to Paramus having in the short interval of time marched out and returning upwards of miles They brought back with them besides their prisoners new firelocks horses and one waggon having sustained the loss of one man The enemy were supposed to have had several killed  stOrders were given for the troops to be ready to march early the next morning The gentleman who was taken into custody at Hackensack chagrined almost to death had been spending his time like April in weeping and lowering and much intercession having been made for his release  our General told him that in case he would faithfully perform a piece of secret service allotted to him he should be released This he performed with punctuality and consequently was set at liberty  dThe troops marched from Paramus round by the side of Kakaat to Clark'sTown which they reached about sunset  dThe troops took up their line of march crossed the Hudson and arrived at Peek's Kill  thGave permission for the flag to return to NewYork having on board the families of Mr Inglish Moore c  thIt was learnt that a body of Hessian troops had not long before moved to the upper end of York Island The militia of the State of NewYork were this day beginning to come in  thA severe snowstorm Some of the militia from Massachusetts had reached Danbury  thIntelligence was received from Providence that a most valuable prize taken by the ship Alfred had arrived safe at Bedford in Massachusetts  thCol Chester of Connecticut arrived at Peek's Kill from Gen Washington's camp with the agreeable news that on the preceding Thursday morning being the th Gen Washington at the head of about men crossed the Delaware and attacked the enemy at Trenton being about Hessians and in about minutes entirely defeated them

Washington it appeared that the enemy were retreating towards Amboy Generals Mifflin and Erving and Col Cadwallader had crossed the Delaware and Gen Washington was about to follow them and pursue the enemy  dSeveral infamous disaffected persons were taken and sent in The same day Gen Washington being at Trenton Gen Howe advanced to attack him a cannonade ensued Gen Washington retired to the other side of the Mill Creek and as soon as it was dark ordering a great number of fires to be lighted up to deceive the enemy stole a march and at o'clock next morning attacked three regiments of the enemy who were posted at Princetown routed them driving them from two small redoubts The enemy lost in killed wounded and taken prisoners about The American loss was inconsiderable except in the brave Gen Mercer of Virginia who fell in this action greatly regretted In this manoeuvre and action Gen Washington exhibited the most consummate generalship and the British were struck with consternation  Ambuscade surprise  and  stratagem  are said to constitute the sublime part of the art of war and that he who possesses the greatest resource in these will eventually pluck the laurel from the brow of his opponent The stratagems of war are almost infinite but all have the same object namely to deceiveto hold up an appearance of something which is not intended while under this mask some important object is secured and be a General never so brave if he be unskilled in  the arts and stratagems of war he is really to be pitied for his bravery will but serve to lead him into those wily snares which are laid for him  dThirtyseven recruits going to Rogers taken the preceding night were brought in and our General ordered out Capt Graham at o'clock at night to intercept another gang  thGen Lincoln arrived from Massachusetts he had come on with a body of militia  thIt was learnt that on the st inst Gen Putnam took a large quantity of baggage provisions c at Bordentown and on the d Gen Washington's army came up with the rear of the enemy at or near Rocky Hill when a brisk action ensued and the enemy were defeated with the loss of between and killed and upwards of taken prisoners together with pieces of cannon and all their baggage the Americans had men killed The same day Col Sparhawk's regiment of militia from Massachusetts with two fieldpieces marched for King's Ferry on their way to the Jersies  thOur General received the following letter from Gen Washington  PLUCKEMIN  Jan th    SIR  WE have made a successful attack upon Princeton General Howe advanced upon Trenton we evacuated the town and lay at the other side of the Mill Creek until dark then stole a march and attacked Princeton about o'clock in the morning There were three regiments quartered there The killed wounded and prisoners taken amounted to about The enemy are in great consternation and as the present affords us a favourable opportunity to drive them out of the Jersies it has been determined in Council that you should move down towards  NewYork with a considerable force as if you had a design upon the city that being an object of great importance the enemy will be reduced to the necessity of withdrawing a considerable part of their force from the Jersies if not the whole to secure the city I shall draw the force on this side the North River together at Morristown where I shall watch the motions of the enemy and avail myself of every circumstance You will retain of the militia coming on from the NewEngland Governments for the expedition You will act with great precaution but avail yourself of every favourable opportunity of attacking the enemy when you can do it to advantage  Gen Lincoln must cross the North River and come on with the remainder of the militia to Morristown Leave a sufficient guard at the Highlands  You will also have as many boats collected together or in such a manner as you may always avail yourself of them if it should be found expedient for your troops or any part of them to cross the North River at Dobb's Ferry or any other of the landings  I am c Signed GEO WASHINGTON  Gen HEATH  Preparations for the before mentioned movement were immediately put in train The militia and volunteers were coming in  thGen Parsons went down to Kingstreet  thThe remainder of Col Sparhawk's and Col Whitney's regiments passed over the river to join Gen Washington  thCol Frost's regiment marched to NorthCastle and Gen Scott's militia to White Plains  thA number of British officers taken at Princeton passed Peek's Kill on their way to Connecticut The same day it was learnt that on the th Gen Maxwell with the Jersey militia and some continental troops routed the enemy at ElizabethTown where he took Highlanders a schooner loaded with baggage and fell in with a party of Waldeckers whom he also took prisoners  thGen Moulton from Massachusetts and Col Gilman from NewHampshire came to camp A number of British prisoners taken in the Jersies passed Peek's Kill on their way to Connecticut  thOur General moved to the southward and reached NorthCastle just before sunset where he found part of four regiments had arrived and Gen Scott's militia of NewYork had moved down to Wright's Mills  thOur General moved to Kingstreet to Mr Clap'sabout militia had arrived and Gen Lincoln's division marched to Tarrytown on this day The Commander in Chief in another letter had intimated that Gen Lincoln instead of moving on to join him should stay on the east side of the Hudson and join in the expedition  thThe Connecticut volunteers marched from Kingstreet to New Rochelle and Gen Scott's brigade to Stephen Ward's Plenty of provisions were arriving A deserter came in from the enemy and gave an account of their situation and numbers  thAt night the three divisions began to move towards Kingsbridge Gen Lincoln's from Tarrytown on the Albany road Generals Wooster and Parsons's from New Rochelle and EastChester and Gen Scott's in the centre from below White Plains  The several distances and rate of marching were so we calculated that on the th just before sunrise the three divisions although so far apart arrived at the outposts of the enemy almost at the same instant Gen Lincoln's on the heights above Col Van Cortland's Wooster's at Williams's and Scott's on the back of Volentine's Our General who moved with the centre division knew that Volentine's house was the quarters of one of the guards he did not know but it might be defended as he approached it he ordered Capt Lieut Bryant to advance a fieldpiece to the advanceguard and if there was any opposition from the house to cannonade it immediately He then ordered men from the head of the column as it was moving on to incline to the right and by a double step to push into the hollow between the house and the fort to cut off the guard who were at the house in case they should run towards the latter At this instant two lighthorsemen who had been sent out by the enemy as the day broke to reconnoitre the vicinity came unexpectedly at the descent of a hill plump upon the head of Wooster's column They attempted to turn about but before it could be fully effected a fieldpiece was discharged at them one of them was pitched from his horse and taken prisoner the other galloped back to the fort holloing as he passed "The rebels The rebels" This set all the outguards and pickets running to the fort leaving in some places their arms blankets tools provisions c behind them Those who fled from Volentine's and the  Negro Fort  were fired at as they ran but none were killed one who could not run so fast as the rest was taken prisoner Ten musquets were taken at Volentine's house The guard above Van Cortland's was as completely surprised as the others  where Gen Lincoln took about arms some blankets c c The left and centre divisions moved into the hollow between Volentine's house and the fort from whence our General immediately sent a summons to the commandingofficer of the fort to surrender The Commandant of the fort and a considerable part of the garrison being Hessians the summons held out to these generous terms The answer which was verbal was a refusal to surrender A detachment with two fieldpieces was ordered to move to the south of the fort to a hill above Haarlem Creek not far from the New Bridge When the detachment arrived at this place a battalion of Hessians appeared drawn up on the side of the hill just within Kingsbridge and back of Hyatt's tavern Our General ordered the artillery to cannonade them immediately The first shot just cleared the right of the battalion nearly a platoon settling down as the shot passed them which entered the bank close behind them The second shot passed about the centre of the battalion when to the amount of a grand division settled down which was an evidence that they would not stand much longer One of the pieces was ordered to be drawn lower down the hill on which the battalion quitted their ground and marched off as fast as they could without running to get behind the redoubt and hill at the bridge receiving one shot more as they were turning round the point It was not suspected that the enemy had any cannon in the redoubt within the bridge but they now began to cannonade the artillerymen who had descended the hill who had to draw up their piece as fast as possible which they effected without any loss but received three or four shot quite among them before they could reach the top of the hill  This success at the outposts flew through the country and was soon magnified to a reduction of the fort and capture of the garrison It reached Gen Washington long before the official account and he had communicated the report to Congress hence a double disappointment when the true state of facts was received  thThe enemy cannonaded from the fort and killed one American as the guards were relieving at the Negro Fort It was determined to make an attempt to cut off the battalion within Kingsbridge early the next morning by passing a strong detachment over SpittenDevil Creek on the ice which however was not now very strong but the weather was cold One thousand were detached for the purpose but the weather having grown warm in the night the ice was judged by the unanimous opinion of all the General Officers on the ground to be too hazardous on the morning of the th to venture the attempt On this day there was a cannonade on both sides and the enemy on the island side were thrown into much confusion Our General observing that when the enemy within the island were cannonaded across Haarlem Creek they sheltered themselves behind the little hill near the bridge next to SpittenDevil Creek on this afternoon he rode round on to Tippit's Hill which was in its rear and found that a fieldpiece drawn up on that side would leave the enemy no hiding place  stA cannonade on both sides In the afternoon a fieldpiece was hauled up to Tippit's Hill and the enemy were cannonaded both in front and rear they were thrown into the utmost confusion some secured themselves in their redoubt others under the banks some lay flat on the ground and some betook themselves to the cellars so that in a  short time there was no object for the gunners The weather had now grown very moderate  dThere was a pretty smart skirmish with the enemy near the fort This day our General ordered a number of chandeliers fascines c to be made and having nothing but light fieldpieces with him in order to keep up an appearance of a serious design on the fort he sent to NorthCastle where was a  field  brass pounder and some howitzers to bring forward the former and one of the latter  dA smart skirmish took place just before dusk in the broken ground near the south side of the fort an Ensign and one man belonging to the NewYork militia were killed and five wounded the loss of the enemy unknown as it was close under the fort  thExcessive stormy Gen Lincoln's division who were in huts in the woods back of Col Van Cortland's were obliged to quit their ground and move back into houses where they could find them some of them as far as Dobb's Ferry with the loss of a great many cartridges from the badness of the boxes The fall of rain was so great as to cause a great fresh in the Brunx the water running over the bridge by Williams's  thEarly in the morning the enemy made a sally towards Delaney's Mills where they surprised and routed the guard wounding several but not killing or taking any of them and a regiment near that place quitted their quarters Emboldened by this success about o'clock A M they made a powerful sally towards Volentine's instantly driving the guards and pickets from the Negro Fort and Volentine's house pushing on with great impetuosity keeping up a brisk fire the balls passing at Williams's house sufficiently strong to do execution The retreating  guards threw themselves into the old redoubt on the north side of the road to the west of the bridge on which the enemy immediately lined a strong stone wall a few rods distant to the southwest Two regiments of the militia being at this instant formed in the road near Williams's and the horses in the limbers of the fieldpieces our General ordered Capt Bryant to ford over the bridge with his piece and the militia to follow and cover the artillery When Capt Bryant had ascended almost to the top of the hill to prevent his horses being shot he unlimbered and the men took the dragropes but the ascent of the hill was such that they were obliged to drag the piece almost within pistoshot before the ground would admit the plece to be so depressed as to bear on the enemy The moment this was effected a round shot opened a breach in the wall four or five feet wide a second shot in less than a minute opened another when the enemy sled back to the fort with the greatest precipitation Of the Americans two were killed and a number wounded  thThe brass pounder and howitzer were brought up and ordered to open upon the fort on the third discharge of the former she sprang her carriage nor were there any  live  shells for the howitzer there being none at NorthCastle nor was a regular cannonade or bombardment of the fort ever contemplated Every attempt was now made by feint and otherwise to draw the enemy out of the fort A detachment was sent down to Morrisania to light up a great number of fires in the night to induce the enemy to suppose that a body of Americans were collecting at that place with a design to cross on to NewYork Island at or near Haarlem and to heighten this several large boats were sent for and brought forward on carriages The British  guard on Montresor's Island were so much alarmed at this as to set the buildings on fire and flee to NewYork A brigade of the British were said to have moved towards Fort Washington and orders had been sent to RhodeIsland for a detachment to be sent from thence  thThere was the appearance of a severe snowstorm coming on when all the General Officers on the ground viz besides our General  Lincoln Wooster Scott  and  Ten Broeck  were unanimously of opinion that the troops ought to move back before the storm came on to places where they could be covered from the inclemency of the weather as there was no artillery to batter the fort and from first to last they were unanimously opposed to any idea of an assault or storm of the sort with the militia and the principal object being now to secure and bring off or destroy the forage which could be as well done where the troops could have covering as to harass them in the open fields by multiplying guards or their being constantly exposed in the scattered houses to be surprised and cut off For these several reasons the troops were ordered as soon as it grew dark to move back Gen Lincoln's division to Dobb's Ferry and TarryTown Gen Wooster's to New Rochelle and Gen Scott's to White Plains the guards to remain at their posts and alert until the troops were all moved off and then to form rear guards on the several roads following the troops to whom they respectively belonged all of which was performed in good order in a very heavy fall of snow  thThe storm cleared up when ships brig schooners and sloops came too between Heart and City Islands they were from the eastward and were supposed to have troops on board  The troops on this expedition as it was called were in a very hazardous situation and had continued in it from the morning of the th to the evening of the th they were entirely a body of militia except a few artillerymen So apprehensive of this being a critical situation was the Commander in Chief in the year when Gen Sir Henry Clinton menaced the French army at RhodeIsland and had embarked his troops on board transports for the purpose of proceeding to that place and Gen Washington had determined to move down towards Kingsbridge to induce Sir Henry to give up his design by menacing NewYork our General being then at RhodeIsland with the French army Gen Washington wrote him on the st of July from Robinson's House in the Highlandsamong other things  "You know the critical situation in which this army will be in a position below"  This was undoubtedly a very just observation but if the Commander in Chief with the whole American army in well armed and highly disciplined should so justly judge at the distance of miles from the spot what shall we say of those brave militia men who continued in the position itself for more than  ten days  in the midst of winter  Whenever an enterprise is to be attempted in the teeth of an enemy it should be a  dash  and away  stA  cordon  of troops was ordered to be formed to extend from Dobb's Ferry to Maroneck  February  stForaging being now the object a large number of teams were sent out towards Maroneck and upwards of loads of forage were brought off Twelve more ships of which were of guns came down the Sound the preceding day  dCol Humphries of NewYork arrived with a regiment of militia from Albany county to continue in service six weeks  dThere was another grand forage  thA strong detachment under the command of Col Enos was sent toward Fort Independence to attempt to surprise some of the enemy's outposts but nothing could be effected The smallpox was now making its appearance in the neighbourhood  thThere was a grand forage to the lower parts of WestChester county A rowgalley and a sloop were coming up the North River The covering party to the foragers on this day was nearly strong and large quantities of forage were brought off  thOur General rode to Peek's Kill where he arrived a little after dark Gen Lincoln's troops were on their march to join Gen Washington Our General had obtained leave of the Commander in Chief to make a short visit to NewEngland under an injunction to return very early  thAbout o'clock he left Peck's Kill and arrived at his house in Roxbury on the th about sunset  March  thOur General set out from Roxbury on his way back to the army but before he had got to Watertown an express overtook him with orders from Gen Washington for him to take the command of the Eastern Department Gen Ward having applied for leave to resign the command meaning to retire from the service he therefore turned back and rode into Boston  This year formed an important era in the annals of America Congress had determined to make great exertions to drive the British troops from America for this purpose they had ordered battalions to be raised in the United States of which fell to the share of Massachusetts Besides the foregoing battalions they also ordered the  raising of others called the additional battalions and of these three were raising in Massachusetts viz Jackson's Lee's and Henley's besides Armand's Legion Artificers c The arming equipping and sending on the recruitsfurnishing the Recruiting Officers with bounty moniesand the forwarding on immense quantities of all kinds of military stores for Massachusetts might now be called the great magazine of military stores of the Union partly on account of her own resources managed by the indefatigable industry of her Board of Warand the arrivals of public stores here and at Portsmouth called for the utmost diligence and exertion of the commanding General The Commander in Chief had given directions for the troops to be forwarded on with all possible dispatch to Ticonderoga  thMaj Gen Ward resigned the command of the Eastern Department to our General who took the command accordingly  dA detachment of British troops consisting as was said of about men destroyed the American stores at Peek's Kill they met with but very little opposition here our General lost a part of his baggage which was left when he came

Connecticut they assembled the militia of the vicinity and attacked the British on their return and there were several very sharp skirmishes at and near Ridgfield in one of which the brave Gen Wooster fell and Gen Arnold having his horse shot down under him by a soldier who was very near him and who was following up his shot with his bayonet charged Arnold catched one of his pistols from the holsters on the slain horse and instantly shot the soldier dead on the spot The loss was considerable on both sides in killed and wounded the British say theirs did not exceed killed wounded and

received that the Americans evacuated Ticonderoga on the th at night a great many stores c were lost The British no sooner arrived before Ticonderoga than they were discovered on Mount Hope this steep and rugged hill was thought to be inaccessible by the Americans at least with artillery and therefore notwithstanding its nearness to the works and overlooking of them in part it was not taken possession of but they should have recollected what had been said by the late King of Prussia as to such positionsthat "where a goat can go a man may go and where a man can go artillery may be drawn up" The British were no sooner seen on this hill where the  wily Phillips  of the artillery is said to have ascended than they saw an additional reason for quitting the post This was a sore and heavy loss to the Americans but in the issue proved a more certain and earlier overthrow of all Burgoyne's army yet so exasperated were the people at that time that had the commanding General St Clair been immediately brought to trial he would have stood but a poor chance he was afterwards tried and acquitted with honour The British took possession of the works and pushed on rapidly after the Americans taking and destroying every thing that fell in their way Brig Gen Frazer with the light troops pursued  with great ardour and on the th came up with a body of the Americans commanded by the brave Col Francis of Massachusetts A warm action ensued the Americans were worsted the Colonel was slain and many other officers and soldiers killed wounded and taken prisoners This flew through the country like a shock of electricity and roused the people to noble exertions Gen St Clair joined Gen Schuyler at Fort Edward after a fatiguing retreat On the th a most conspicuous piece of gallantry was exhibited at RhodeIsland Maj Gen Prescott having the command of the British troops at that place Col Barton of Providence formed a resolution to surprise and take him he accordingly proceeded to the island with a party of chosen men in two boats with muffled oars taking with him a negro man whose hard head was nearly as efficacious as a beetle to burst a door and on this night with great address evading the British waterguards passed down the west side of the island and landed near a hollow ground and instantly pushed for the house of a Mr  Overing  where the General quartered The centinel at the door was seized the house entered and demand made whether the General was there and finding that he was and the apartment the door was burst open and the General and his Aiddecamp seized and told that they must go off instantly The General asked if he might put on his clothes The Colonel answered  "very few and very quick Sir"  The Colonel returned to his boats and repassed the waterguards which the General had much confidence would have released him for on passing the last he observed to the Colonel "Sir I did not think it possible you could escape the vigilance of the waterguards" This was a brilliant affair and Congress duly rewarded Col Barton for his distinguished address and gallantry  thAn express arrived from Gen Washington with information that the British were preparing their transports for the embarkation of their troops from Staten Island were fixing births for the lighthorse c but their destination could not be developed They had pushed into the Jersies as if designing to march to Philadelphia and then turned back as has been mentioned from Amboy and now were preparing to embark and we shall anon see more of their manoeuvres and deceptions  thA number of Americans who had left the northern army when it retreated as is generally the case on similar occasions came to Boston they were immediately taken up and confined to be sent back again the best method in like cases  thAt evening an express passed through Boston on his way to Philadelphia with dispatches which had been brought to Portsmouth N H by a vessel in days passage from France It was said that there was great probability of an immediate war between France and England  stBy intelligence from Peek's Kill it was learnt that on the preceding Wednesday pieces of cannon were shipped for Albany that a division of the American army was opposite to Fishkill and that General Washington was moving towards King's Ferry with the main army said to be strong with near waggons and having a number of flatbottomed boats on carriages c  thCount Polaski a Polish nobleman came to Boston and dined at headquarters  August  stInformation was sent from Cape Ann that a fleet of vessels said to be near had been seen from the high lands standing to the northward This caused some alarm the guards at the magazines c were doubled  thIntelligence was received that Gen Washington was moving with the main army towards Philadelphia and had detached Gen Glover with his brigade to join the northern army An account was received that there had been a skirmish on Wood Creek between a party of the Americans and the enemy to the advantage of the former  thIntelligence was received that the American northern army had fallen back to Saratoga About this time a party of the enemy landed on Boston Neck so called in RhodeIsland they were driven off without doing much damage The same day intelligence was received that on the d of the preceding month the British fleet sailed from Sandy Hook and had arrived off the Capes of Delaware  thIntelligence was received that the British fleet sailed out of the Capes of Delaware on the st alt standing to the eastward This induced Gen Washington to retrograde the main American army towards the North River  thThere was a report that the northern army had fallen back to Stillwater One sixth part of the militia in a number of the counties of Massachusetts were ordered to be detached and marched immediately to reinforce the northern army  thIntelligence was received that the British fleet had returned again to the Capes of Delaware Col Johnson and St Leger were advancing with a body of the enemy towards Fort Schuyler on the Mohawk River  About this time a Miss M'Crea said to be a beautiful young lady and in all the innocence of youth her father warmly engaged on the side of the British and she on the very point of marriage with a British officer on some dispute between two Indians as to which of them she of right belonged as a captive  she was most inhumanly massacred The act was probably as abhorrent to the British as to the Americans but they ought not to have engaged the savages in their cause as they might well have known their ungovernable temper and disposition for blood for this was not the only instance A British officer sending his waiter to a spring for some cool water in a few minutes an Indian came in with the scalp of the waiter smoaking in his hand  St Leger having gone up the Mohawk to reduce Fort Schuyler Gen Burgoyne determined to send out another strong detachment on his left towards Bennington The command of this detachment was given to Lieut Col Baum a Hessian and Col Breyman with another detachment was ordered to cover and support Baum These were met by the brave Gen Stark who gave them a complete overthrow On the morning of the th officers and near men were taken prisoners with light fieldpieces nearly arms a quantity of baggage c The Americans were said to have had about men killed the loss of the enemy in killed was judged to be nearly Fort Schuyler was closely besieged by St Leger and the brave Col Harkimer with the Tryon county militia was marching to its relief St Leger learning his advance drew off a large part of his besieging troops to meet and give him battle before he got near the fort the battle was obstinate and the militia behaved with great bravery but were at length defeated their brave Colonel and many of the militia were slain it was said that the action lasted or hours Matters now appearing more serious in this quarter Gen Arnold marched with a sufficient detachment to raise the siege As soon as St Leger learnt his approach he sent off some Indians as if friends to  meet Arnold and inform him that St Leger had received a strong reinforcement and advised Arnold to halt and wait for a reinforcement himselfthen abandoned the siege with precipitation leaving his tents standing his baggage artillery c behind him Thus were both Burgoyne's wings effectually clipped  September  stIntelligence was received that after much manoeuvring Howe's fleet came to anchor in Chesapeak Bay on the st ult consisting of near sail and it was expected he would soon land his troops The th Gen Washington's army was on full march to meet Howe and then within miles of Philadelphia A valuable cargo arrived safe from Spain among other articles a large number of shoes hose blankets shirts cordage duck c  dIntelligence was received that Gen Howe's army had landed at the Head of Elk A detachment from Gen Sullivan's division a little before this time made an excursion on to StatenIsland and brought off several hundred prisoners and a large quantity of baggage The American loss was said to be about including officers  thFour hundred and one prisoners taken near Bennington by Gen Stark were escorted to Boston they consisted of British Brunswick and Canadian troops  thCapt Harden arrived at Boston in a Connecticut State ship of guns he brought in with him a Jamaica packet which he took during his cruize It was said the packet had a large sum in specie on board and a Mr Shirley and family on their passage to England The last accounts stated both Gen Washington's and the northern army to be near the enemy and important news might be momently expected  thCol Lee's regiment moved into Boston  thThe disagreeable news was received that on the th inst a severe action took place between Gen Washington's and Howe's armies near the Brandywine which ended rather in favour of the latter who remained masters of the field The British here as in several other instances had recourse to stratagem they held out the appearance of an intention of forcing their way at Chad's Ford which Gen Kniphausen menaced with a heavy column of Hessians while the British column by a long circuitous march reached the forks of the river and there secured a safe passage Gen Washington was pretty early apprized of this movement and immediately took measures for strengthening his right by ordering some troops from his left After the action had become pretty warm on the right and the British had got the advantage Kniphausen passed Chad's Ford and although the troops who were still on the left behaved well they were by no means sufficient to resist the heavy column of Hessians It is said that after the Hessian Grenadiers had crossed the Ford they halted at the foot of the hill below the Americans under a warm fire and with great deliberation changed their hats for their heavy brass caps which were carried by a loop on a button at the hip and then ascended the hill from which the Americans were obliged to retire Here the brave Capt Bryant of the artillery who had before several times distinguished himself under the eye of our General received a musquetball in the bottom of his belly a brother officer carried him off the field but he died of the wound Gen Washington seconded by his officers did every thing in their power to check the British and a part of the American army took a position which probably saved the army  from a total defeat Perhaps the American army were more or less more generally engaged in this action than in any other during the war The American loss was considerable in killed and wounded and a number of pieces of brass field artillery were lost The British also suffered pretty severely in killed and wounded  The next night Gen Gray made with much secrecy an attack on a body of Americans under the command of Gen Wayne the bayonet was chiefly made use of and it proved but too efficacious against the Americans who suffered considerable loss in killed and wounded Gen Washington retreated first to Philadelphia and then left the city The British army a few days afterwards advanced to Germantown and on the th a detachment of their army took possession of Philadelphia  dGen Washington's orders for sending forward Colonels Lee's Henley's and Jackson's regiments were received by our General  thSeveral prizes were sent in by a privateer brig belonging to Col Sears  thIntelligence was received that on Friday the th instant there was a warm and bloody action between Gen Gates's and Burgoyne's advanced troops which lasted until dark The troops behaved with the greatest bravery on both sides Col Morgan's light corps and eleven other American regiments were more or less engaged Of the Americans Lieutenant Colonels Coburn and Adams Captains Subalterns and noncommissioned officers and privates were killed and wounded Theloss of the enemy was very considerable and much greater than that of the Americans On the th the day preceding the foregoing battle Col Brown made an excursion in the enemy's rear to Lake  George made of the enemy prisoners retook Americans he also took near batteaux several large gunboats an armed sloop ctook possession of the French Lines so called at Ticonderoga and summoned Fort Independence to surrender  thCol Craft's regiment of State artillery marched out of Boston with light fieldpieces and an eightinch howitzer towards Providence on a secret expedition as it was called  thIntelligence was received that several valuable prizes had been sent into Dartmouth  October  dIntelligence was received that on the th Gen Du Condray was drowned in the Schuylkill he rode into the ferryboat at one end but was not able to command his horse who went out at the other end of the boat plunging into the river This officer as before mentioned was engaged to come to America to take the command of the artillery but whatever may have been his talents the artillery was so well commanded that the placing a foreign officer over them in such a manner and whose rank would also have soared above many other officers in the line would most certainly have produced a convulsion in the army had it been persisted in This circumstance prevented the danger The same day Col Lee's regiment marched for the main army  thCol H Jackson's regiment encamped on Boston common and the next day about noon marched out of town for the army the regiment although small made a good appearance About the same time that the regiment marched out of town upwards of British and Canadian prisoners taken near Lake George by Col Brown marched in  thIt was learnt that a body of the enemy said to be about were moving from NewYork  towards Peek's Kill Gen Washington after he left Philadelphia encamped near a place called Skippack Creek about miles from Germantown  thAt o'clock A M an express arrived from Gen Gates's army with an account that on Tuesday the th inst a smart action took place between the right of Gen Burgoyne's army and the American left when the enemy were repulsed drove back to their works and then forced from them Three FieldOfficers Captains Subalterns QuarterMasterGeneral and privates were taken prisoners besides taken in the hospital pieces of brass cannon twelve and six pounders ammunitionwaggons tents barrels of flour and a large quantity of baggage were trophies of victory One hundred of the enemy lay dead on the ground The American loss although not exactly known was said not to be more than killed and wounded among the latter Generals Arnold and Lincoln both in the leg the former but slightly it was problematical whether the latter was wounded by a British or American soldier Gen Frazer an enterprising officer of the British was mortally wounded and died of his wounds  thIntelligence was received that a body of the British from NewYork in about transports had proceeded up the Hudson they had made several landings below and at Peek's Kill on Monday the th inst they crossed over and landed on the west side of the river and marched along the hills towards Fort Montgomery and its dependencies this fort was tolerably situated on the bank of the Hudson to annoy shipping going up the river and the works were pretty good on that side but were not so nor fully completed on the back side and the right flank was commanded by higher ground  on the south and near the fort on the other side of Pooplop's Creek the mouth of which was near to the south side of the fort on this higher ground and near to the small deep pond a strong redoubt called Clinton was erected it was equally essential that this redoubt should be taken as a reduction of the fort the British therefore moved against this redoubt while another column by a more circuitous movement fell in the rear of Fort Montgomery they were met in the defiles where the skirmishes were sharp but they continued to advance to the redoubt which was nobly defended and before which they sustained very considerable loss a number of their slain were afterwards drawn out of the pond where they had been thrown for concealment but soon carried it and afterwards Fort Montgomery The garrison principally made their escape in the dusk of the evening among them were Gov Clinton and his brother who was a BrigadierGeneral also they made their escape in a very hazardous manner and the latter was wounded After the reduction of Fort Montgomery the Americans evacuated Fort Constitution and the blockhouse on Constitution Island opposite to West Point the latter was not yet fortified and the two new frigates  Congress  and  Montgomery  which lay in the river were set on fire by the Americans and burnt The enemy afterwards proceeded up the river and burnt Esopus their object was if possible to form a junction with Burgoyne or open a water communication to Albany and spies passed between them  thTwo or three of the enemy's cruizers appeared in the bay but a few leagues from the Light While the British army lay encamped at Germantown Gen Washington resolved to attack them This was a brave design and the success of the first onset at about o'clock A M of the th inst after  the Americans had marched all the night was equal to the design for the British where the attack was first made were almost instantly pushed from their ground and were falling back panic struck on their other troops When Lieut Col Musgrove had the presence of mind to throw several companies into a strong stone house Houses at all times and especially those of stone and brick under a judicious conduct admit of a good defence and at this time probably proved the means of the Americans' losing an advantage which no one can tell how far it might have been pushed When an enemy is routed and panic struck are flying before the assailants the best if not the only way is to follow them if the ground will admit of it close at their heels taking care not to fall into ambuseades Thus the panic of fear continues to multiply but if the pursuers stop and especially if those who were flying hear a firing behind them but not upon them they conclude that their own troops in turn have gotten an advantage or at least are holding their pursuers at bay This immediately recovers them from their panic they will next return to the charge and will be more likely to make an obstinate resistance than before they were at first routed while their return to the charge will greatly damp those who before considered themselves almost in the grasp of victory Hence what took place at Germantown was no wonder The fogginess of the morning was unfortunate for the Americans but the British taking possession of the stone house and defending it was the most unfortunate circumstance The loss on both sides was considerable on the side of the Americans Brig Gen Nash and on the side of the British Brig Gen Agnew were among the slain but although this attempt  was not crowned with victory it caused the British to have a more reverential opinion of Gen Washington whom they now found dare to attack their whole army even in a chosen position of their own Perhaps it was best that the action closed as it did had the Americans made their way far into the long street of that town probably many other houses would have been occupied in the same way The buryingyard with a strong wall was lined with troops by the enemy and the position in which their army lay was calculated for their wings closing in to much advantage at any rate the battle must have been very bloody and situation and circumstances were in favour of the British After the British were in possession of Philadelphia they had much to do in order to get possession of the Delaware and remove the obstructions which had been formed in it There were also several works to be reduced among others a fort on MudIsland and a pretty strong work at Red Bank  dHighly important and most interesting intelligence was received that on the th inst Gen Burgoyne and his whole army surrendered under Convention They were to be marched to then eighbourhood of Boston and from thence sent to England Upon the receipt of this news the cannon on Fort Hill were discharged and joy was seated on every brow  dAt o'clock P M the cannon on Fort Hill and on the heights of Dorchester were discharged and also on board the ships in the harbour In the evening our General's quarters the house of the late Hon Mr Russel was beautifully illuminated The following is the number of troops which surrendered to Maj Gen Gates and the state of Gen Burgoyne's army after he left Canada  Under the Convention  British    Foreign    Canadians c sent back to Canada    Staff      Prisoners taken at different times    Sick and wounded    Deserters    Lost at Bennington    Killed since the th of September    Killed and taken at Ticonderoga    Total    The brass ordnance taken were as follows pounders pounders pounders pounders inch mortars howitzers total exclusive of those taken at Bennington  Thus were the British totally disappointed in this quarter The troops intended to form a junction on the Hudson were as high up as Poughkeepsie and Gen Burgoyne informed our General after he arrived at Boston that on the evening after he had proposed to Gen Gates to surrender in case he could obtain honourable terms which were to be settled the next day a spy came in to him from the troops down the river stating how far they had got up and what steps were next to be taken on which he Gen Burgoyne assembled his officers more generally than usual in councils and stated to them the circumstances and situation of both armies and whether consistently with fair principles of honour they could break off the negociation for an honourable Convention or not when it was the unanimous opinion of every officer present that they could not  But in a situation like his at that moment danger at hand is more powerful on the mind than the hope of relief at a distance The troops who were up the river returned down  The capture of Gen Burgoyne and his whole army who were now on their way to Boston opened a new important and delicate field for our General This army in which there were many officers of military erudition and some of refined and courtly manners who had a high opinion of national honour and prowess and who in consequence of the Convention which they had formed had their spirits by no means depressed as those who are compelled to surrender at discretionwere sure to lay a heavy task on his shoulders As soon as he was notified that these troops were coming under his direction he set himself in earnest to prepare for their reception The barracks at Prospect and Winter Hills were directed to be put instantly in order The Council was applied to to aid in the procurement of quarters from the citizens for the officers nor was this an easy task The families of the citizens generally wanting the room in their respective houses rendered it difficult to obtain so many quarters as were necessary for so great a number and extended the limits of the parole very considerably The Council were disposed to do every thing in their power and gave orders accordingly whenever they were necessary A heavy duty was also falling on the QuarterMaster's department as it respected quarters and also fuel the latter of which had been rendered scarce in the vicinity by the American army having been here in and the enemy's cruizers prevented its being brought from the eastern country But the exertions of Col Chase who was DeputyQuarterMasterGeneral and the assistants  and conductors in his department and of Col Davis who was DeputyBarrackMaster and who in the procurement of fuel was indefatigable a comfortable supply was obtained Before the arrival of the troops at Cambridge our General had digested and drafted a parole and several articles for the government of the troops in quarters these he had drawn in as an article in the parole and the honour of the officers in this way was pledged for their observance of the articles which rendered the government of them much easier being thus bound to govern themselves with propriety or infringe their paroles knowing that many things in minutiae would be to settle which would be tedious in an epistolary way As soon as General Burgoyne had arrived at Cambridge our General sent over one of his Aid decamps to invite Gen Burgoyne to dine with him the next day bringing with him his two MajorGenerals Phillips and Reidesel An elegant dinner was prepared and many other gentlemen invited among whom were Generals Glover of Massachusetts and Whipple of NewHampshire who were at the capture and had commanded the escort c from Saratoga to Cambridge  November  thOur General sent one of his Aids to accompany Gen Burgoyne and the other officers into Boston by the way of Roxbury they arrived some time before dinner as was intended that business might be considered The parole was shewn to them and the articles for their government in quarters with which they were well pleased But here a discovery was first made of something which they wished to retain while in our country and which our General would never for a moment allow Gen Phillips turning to our General observed "Sir you well know the disposition of soldiers and that they  will more or less in all armies commit some disorders suppose you should delegate to Gen Burgoyne the power of seeing  your  orders executed" Our General replied that he knew the disposition of soldiers and also the necessity of order and discipline that he was not only willing but expected that Gen Burgoyne and every other officer would exert themselves to keep order that for this purpose among themselves and for internal order and obedience he might command and punish as might appear to be necessary but in no case to attempt capital punishment But as to the exercise of his own command and enforcement of his own orders when necessary was a jurisdiction which Gen Burgoyne must not expect to exercise while here Gen Burgoyne smiled and Gen Phillips turned it off by saying "I only meant it for your easement Sir"  Before dinner was done so great was the curiosity of the citizens of both sexes and of all ages and descriptions to get a peep at Gen Burgoyne that the streets were filled the doors windows the tops of the houses and fences crowded Gen Burgoyne had asked our General if he would indulge him to go out of town by the way of Charlestown which was instantly granted When he was ready to depart our General told him that he should accompany him to the ferry and a procession was formed the American gentlemen mixing with the British The streets were so crowded that it was difficult getting along but not a word or a gesture that was disrespectful When arrived opposite to the ProvinceHouse Gen Burgoyne turned round to the other Generals and observed "There is the former residence of the Governor" when some person on the side of the street and in a tone fully to be heard added  "and on the other side is the ridingschool"  alluding to the Old South MeetingHouse having been put to that use in but the General who must have heard it made no reply but soon after observed "Sir I am astonished at the civility of your people for were you walking the streets of London in my situation you would not escape insult" When arrived at the ferryways the crowd were down to the water's edge but when the boat put off there was not the least indecency or wry countenance discoveredO my dear countrymen how did this your dignified conduct at that moment charm my very soul Such conduct flows from a  greatness of mind  that goes to conquer a world  Col Keith was appointed DeputyAdjutantGeneral and Maj Swasey TownMajor  thThe Council were still deliberating on the subject of quarters and determined to do every thing in their power but some individuals were refractory  thGen Hancock arrived in town and was saluted by the discharge of the cannon of the Fort Park c  dIntelligence was received of the repulse of the enemy before the redoubt at Red Bank on the d ult This redoubt or fort had a garrison by no means sufficient properly to man the whole work The commanding officer had therefore wisely lessened it by running a parapet with a ditch across the area of the fort but had left the work entire in its largest extent A body of chosen troops were sent to reduce this work under the command of the Hessian Col Donop a brave and good officer In order if possible to get some idea of the work he sent his summons for the fort to surrender by a very capable Adjutant but the Commandant of the fort took care to have him stopped without the work and  where he had no opportunity to see more than the ditch and parapet on that side The commanding officer refusing to surrender an assault was made the assailants at the head of the column bringing in their hands a sufficient number of short fascines to fill the ditch where they meant to pass which was well done and the parapet was mounted but to their disappointment and surprise they now found there was another ditch and parapet to pass and in the face of a dreadful fire too which made great slaughter a number of them however advanced into the second ditch and began to remove the frizes on the berme but these were generally killed in the ditch and such as were not killed or wounded obliged to quit the outer work Their loss in killed and wounded was great among the latter Col Donop mortally he was taken after the action near the fort and brought in An Ensign had made his way over the second ditch had got on to the frizes and lay close against the base of the parapet until the action was over and then got up and surrendered observing that he thought his position the only safe one for had he attempted to put his head above the parapet he knew his brains would have been instantly blown out or if he had attempted to recross the ditch he should have been shot in the back Besides this severe check the British met with considerable opposition and loss at other places before they got full and peaceable possession of the river particularly at Mud Island They lost the Augusta manofwar and suffered other naval damage  Gen Washington being now considerably reinforced with a part of the northern conquering army advanced to White Marsh about miles from Philadelphia where he encamped in a strong and well chosen position Gen Howe apprehensive that this  movement indicated a design upon Philadelphia determined to move out and either invite Gen Washington to a general action or if he found him vulnerable to attack him in his own position Accordingly on the evening of the th of December he marched with the British army and on the next morning took post on Chesnut Hill in front of the American right Gen Washington knowing the goodness of his position wisely continued in it nor dare Gen Howe attack him The latter then changed his ground to a new position opposite to the American left and centre but neither dare he attack either of these Several skirmishes took place as is usual in such cases in one of which Brig Gen Irwin on the American side was wounded After several days spent in this way Howe was obliged to return without effecting any thing to the no small injury of his army who had suffered much from the inclemency of the season Indeed nothing is more destructive to an army than winter campaigns After this Gen Washington moved the American army to Valley Forge on the Schuylkill about miles from Philadelphia where he took a position as wisely chosen as the other and where the army erected huts for the winter  We now return to take up our chain of events  dA French ship with dry goods from France by the way of St Peters arrived at Boston  Gen Burgoyne had not yet signed the parole he pretended to delay until their quarters were fully furnished although he had every assurance that it should be done as fast as circumstances would possibly admit On this day therefore our Gen wrote him the following letter  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  Nov    SIR  TWO weeks have now elapsed since I had fully expected that the officers would have signed their paroles They have during this time been enjoying in a great measure the liberty of the limits intended to be assigned to them without pledging their honour by parole which is not only contrary to the established custom of nations but contrary to the eleventh article of the Convention Whatever objections might at first be made to giving the parole must now be done away by the fullest evidence that proper quarters shall be provided and which in a very considerable degree is already done I must therefore in the most explicit terms insist that the officers who wish and expect to be permitted on parole agreeably to the Convention do sign it tomorrow This is so reasonable that I expect there will be no further hesitancy and I still assure your Excellency that no endeavours of mine shall be wanting to fulfil the Convention and to treat the officers with politeness and generosity  I am c Signed WILLIAM HEATH  To Lieut Gen BURGOYNE  thGen Burgoyne and the other officers of the Convention signed their parole  Congress before this viz on the th instant passed the following resolve  In Congress  Nov    Resolved  That Maj Gen Heath be directed forthwith to cause to be taken down the name and rank of every commissioned officer and the name former place of abode and occupation size age and description of every noncommissioned officer and  private soldier and all other persons comprehended in the Convention made between Lieut Gen Burgoyne and Maj Gen Gates on the th day of October and transmit an authentic copy thereof to the Board of War in order that if any officer or soldier or other person as above mentioned of the said army shall hereafter be found in arms against these States in NorthAmerica during the present contest he may be convicted of the offence and suffer the punishment in such case inslicted by the law of nations  That Maj Gen Heath be directed to take the parole in writing of the officers according to the Convention and transmit authenticated copies of such paroles to the Board of War  Extract from the Minutes  Signed CHARLES THOMSON  Sec'y  Upon the foregoing being communicated to Gen Burgoyne and he called upon to have the said descriptive lists made out accordingly he wrote our General the following letter  CAMBRIDGE  Nov    SIR  I RECEIVED a paper dated HeadQuarters Boston Nov th purporting to be founded upon express orders from the Honorable Continental Congress which paper I return as inadmissible because extending to matters in which the Congress have no right of interference  A list of the names and rank of every commissioned officer and the numbers of the noncommissioned officers and soldiers may be necessary to you Sir for the purpose of fulfilling the Convention in quartering officers and the regular delivery of provisions fuel c Such lists shall be prepared at your request but before any other lists can be granted  I must be assured of the purposes for which they are intended and the word  order  must neither be mentioned nor implied  I have the honour to be c Signed J BURGOYNE Lieut Gen  To Maj Gen HEATH  To the foregoing our General wrote an answer as follows  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  Nov    SIR  YOUR's of yesterday is before me and although you might at first imagine that the Hon Continental Congress have no right of interference in matters of the Convention yet I conclude upon further reflection you must be convinced that as that body are the Representatives of that people who are to reap the advantages or disadvantages of the Convention and as all continental officers are acting by virtue of their authority and under their direction they assuredly have a right of interference and to give such orders to their officers as they may think proper for the full completion of the Convention and for the safety and good of the people  The paragraph of my orders of the th inst respecting the troops of the Convention is founded in reason and justice being designed only to ascertain the officers and soldiers who were comprehended in the Convention that in case any of them contrary to their faith and honour should hereafter be found in arms against these States in NorthAmerica during the present contest they may be convicted of the offence and suffer the punishment in such case inflicted by the law of nations I must therefore insist that you furnish me with proper lists of names and descriptions for the purpose before mentioned as soon as may be  The other lists of the names and rank of the commissioned officers and number of noncommissioned officers and soldiers so essentially necessary for the several purposes of regularity with QuarterMasters and Commissaries and which should be frequently renewed as circumstances may vary should long ere this have been exhibited Some days since I directed my DeputyAdjutantGeneral to call for them and I expect they will be sent in without delay for the purposes above mentioned  I shall at all times endeavour to found my orders on the principles of honour reason and justice and not to infringe those delicate principles in others but my orders for the purposes of order and regularity must be obeyed by every man and all bodies of men placed under my direction and fully determined I am that offenders shall not pass with impunity  I am c Signed W HEATH Maj Gen  Lieut Gen BURGOYNE  dGen Burgoyne wrote an answer to the foregoing But he now acknowledged a further extent of the supreme power than in his former letter but still at least obliquely denied the right of their interference with the Convention troops who were under express stipulations until they quitted the country and that no new conditions could be imposed upon them and asserting that no such requisitions were laid upon the American prisoners in Canada and concluding that if it could be found that such had been required by the British in any case he would submit to it About this time an officer who had been a prisoner in Canada returned to Boston on parole and gave information that he and others had complied with similar injunctions  before they came away upon this being communicated to Gen Burgoyne he found that he had got to the end of his tether of evasion he did not attempt to dispute more but observed that he supposed if it was done any time before the troops departed it would answer the purpose Our General found that nothing could be done by force for were he to attempt of himself to have the lists taken every thing might be evaded except the size and complexion He therefore laid the matter before Congress with the copies of what had passed Congress took the matter into consideration and President Laurens wrote our General an approbation of his conduct and not to push the matter as Congress would take a more extensive view of the business concluding his letter  I have in conclusion to assure you Sir that Congress repose the utmost confidence in your address and abilities for conducting with propriety this important business in which on one side the faith and honour of these infant States are to be preserved and on the other the magnanimity and resolution of Congress to be exemplified  December  Congress had received some intimations that an application would be made to them for leave for the troops of the Convention to embark at some other place than Boston they therefore on the st of December passed a resolution that no other place than that stipulated in the Convention viz  Boston  should be admitted A few days after Gen Burgoyne applied as was suspected but to no purpose  Congress also passed resolutions that all the assistance of provisions and other necessaries furnished to the troops of the Convention should be paid for in specie or replaced in quantity and quality    January  Gen Burgoyne had now got himself into a very serious entanglement he had not only refused and then delayed to give descriptive lists of the troops of the Convention but some time before viz in the month of November had written a letter to Gen Gates complaining that the troops had not been furnished with quarters as they had a right to expect and among other things a paragraph as follows  While I state to you Sir this very unexpected  I entirely acquit Maj Gen Heath and every gentleman of the military department of any  to the public faith engaged in the Convention They do what they can but while the Supreme Powers of the State are unable or unwilling to enforce their authority and the inhabitants want the hospitality or indeed the common civilization to assist us without it the public faith is broke and we are the immediate sufferers  This was unreasonable as it respected both the civil power and the people for the former did every thing in their power unless they had turned the citizens out of their houses to have let the Convention officers in which was not to be expected nor could it be supposed that the citizens would turn their familles themselves into the streets But Congress considered the conduct of Gen Burgoyne and these and other of his expressions on the occasion as calling for serious consideration They therefore investigated the whole in all its latitudes and the President of Congress wrote our General that as it was a matter of high importance and  ired deep deliberation it would probably occu  some days before the resolutions would be com  ed But that in case the fleet arrived before the papers were sent to him to forbid the embarka    Gen Burgoyne had received intimations that a fleet of transports were about to come round for the troops and that the  June  frigate was to wear a flag for his particular accommodation This he mentioned to our General and wished to know if the frigate might come up into the harbour Our General had no apprehensions of any danger from a frigate entering the harbour but apprehended that some people might think that he was not sufficiently vigilant in case he allowed it He therefore told Gen Burgoyne that the frigate could not come up into the harbour and hinted to him the taking one of the most convenient transports in the fleet for the purpose and he might do as he pleased when he got off This touched Gen Burgoyne exceedingly who wrote a letter to our General in which was the following paragraph  As to your allotment of a  "convenient transport"  for my passage if it was from yourself I am to thank you Sir for a sort of insult which the most haughty man of office would be ashamed of in any other country However as I am determined every transaction concerning this Convention shall be notorious and beyond the powers of subterfuge to explain away I have directed the frigate together with the transports to come round and it will then be for you Sir to prohibit the entry of Boston harbour to any ships bearing a flag of truce and declaring they are sent for the express purpose of conveying to GreatBritain any part of the troops of the Convention  Signed J BURGOYNE  Maj Gen HEATH  To which our General wrote the following answer  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  Jan    SIR  YOUR Excellency's favour of yesterday came duly to hand and I must confess I was not a little surprised at some expressions in it  As by the Convention transports only are stipulated to receive the troops I submit to you Sir whether a hint if you were even sure that it came from myself that you should take a convenient one rather than introduce a frigate which is neither expressed or implied in the Convention merits those epithets which you are pleased to bestow on me  I have ever aimed to treat you with politeness and the plighted faith and honour of my country require me to pay strict attention to the Convention on their part of course when transports arrive to receive the troops they will enter the harbour and if you can find by the Convention that a frigate is to enter for the particular reception of yourself she will not be prohibited But if it is rather uncommon for ships of war to bear flags of truce and if consenting to it in the present case should appear to be rather an act of politeness and generosity than otherwise I leave you to your own reflections whether you have made choice of the most happy expressions to obtain it  Signed W HEATH  Lieut Gen BURGOYNE  Gen Burgoyne some how communicated to Viscount Howe the subject of the frigate who wrote Gen Burgoyne the following letter some time after but before the transports came round  EAGLE RHODEISLAND  Feb    SIR  I AM much concerned to find by your letter I had the honour to receive from you on the return  of Capt Piper that you have suffered so greatly in your health But I hope that a speedy removal to a milder climate will contribute to your effectual recovery  The transports have only been delayed to take the precautions necessary for their safe passage at this season of the year As it is not to be expected that the frigate ordered for your reception though carrying a flag of truce and restricted from every act of hostility in consequence whilst attending this service should be admitted within the port of Boston the commander Capt Jacobs will be to land a letter under the same sanction for giving you notice of his arrival off the entrance of the port He will wait to be favoured in your answer with notice of the time you may expect to embark on which occasion I trust you will find every facility that your impaired state of health may require  Signed HOWE  Thus did the Admiral's opinion perfectly coincide with that of our General's  But Congress had passed a resolution on the th day of January upon principles clearly expressed in a report of a committee upon which the resolution was founded  That the embarkation of Lieut Gen Burgoyne and the troops under his command be suspended till a distinct and explicit ratification of the Convention of Saratoga shall be properly notified by the Court of GreatBritain to Congress  Our General's correspondence with Gen Burgoyne respecting the frigate c was transmitted to Congress and the President soon after wrote him  The House appeared to be pleased with your conduct in every respect relative to that officer  Gen Burgoyne applied to Congress for leave to go to Europe himself but Congress did not then  think proper to grant his request Although this denial must have been very painful to the General he did not express himself or write any thing in the least improper He observed to our General that he was sorry for that not only his health urged his departure but that every day he was detained here gave his enemies at home an opportunity for piercing the wound of his reputation the deeper  But Col Kingston was not so prudent as the General a packet of letters which Gen Burgoyne wished to send to Gen Howe was sent to our General for inspection among these was one from Col Kingston to Lord Harcourt in which after observing that fortune had not shewn them the smooth side of her face yet they thought their misfortunes honourable proceeded that he Gen Burgoyne was not well but you know his firmness But I think "the insincerity of France bigotry of Spain or the vindictive Portuguese situated as he is would not have sought for means unnecessarily to detain him" This insult to the authority of the country induced our General to detain this letter and he notified Gen Burgoyne of it adding that while it was his wish to gratify the officers as much as possible in writing to their friends he expected they would be cautious and prudent in their manner of expression When the American DeputyAdjutantGeneral gave the letter from our General to Gen Burgoyne and he had read it he observed "I told Col Kingston that Gen Heath would not let that letter pass" he should have done moreforbid his making the attempt  Another serious matter took place about this time Col Henley who had the immediate command at Cambridge a brave and good officer but warm and quick in his natural temper having ordered  some prisoners who were under guard turned out that he might examine them one of them treated him as he judged with much insolence upon which he pricked him with a sword or bayonet Gen Burgoyne immediately presented a complaint against Col Henley charging him with barbarous and wanton conduct and intentional murder as appears in the following letter  CAMBRIDGE  Jan th    SIR  A REPORT has been made to me of a disturbance that happened at the barracks on Wednesday afternoon for which I am much concerned and though the provocations from your people which originally occasioned it were of the most atrocious nature I was willing the offender on our part should be properly punished But Col Henley not content with that made prisoners of eighteen innocent men and sent them on board a guardship as alleged by your order It is not only a duty to my situation to demand the immediate discharge of these men together with a satisfactory apology but I also mean it as an attention to you Sir that I give you an immediate opportunity to disavow so unjustifiable a proceeding as committing men to the worst of prisons upon vague report caprice and passion  Insults and provocations at which the most placid dispositions would revolt are daily given to the officers and soldiers of this army Regular decent complaints are received by your officers sometimes with haughtiness sometimes with derision but always without redress These evils flow Sir from the general tenor of language and conduct held by Col Henley which encourages his inferiors and seems calculated to excite the most bloody purposes  For want of sufficient information and not bringing myself to believe it possible that facts as related by common report could be true I have hitherto declined taking public notice of this man but upon positive grounds I now and hereby formerly accuse Col Henley of behaviour heinously criminal as an officer and unbecoming a man of the most indecent violent vindictive severity against unarmed men and of intentional murder I demand prompt and satisfactory justice and will not doubt your readiness to give it Whenever you will inform me that a proper tribunal is appointed I will take care that undersiable evidence shall be produced to support these charges  I am c Signed J BURGOYNE  To which our General returned the following answer  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  Jan th    SIR  YOUR's of yesterday's date I received the last evening What provocations you allude to as having been offered by my troops I am at loss to determine The insults and abuses which they have received I will venture to say unless I have been most grossly misinformed are unparalleled and whether you are willing or unwilling Sir offenders shall no longer pass with impunity  If it can be made to appear that any of those soldiers sent to the guardship by my orders are innocent they shall be released from their confinement but with respect to such as have been guilty of violating my standing orders of the garrison instead of disavowing or making any apology for the consinement of such be assured that I do most explicitly  avow it And as I have before observed to your Excellency in a former letter of which you may be assured I shall at all times endeavour to found my orders on the principles of honour reason and justice and not to infringe those delicate principles in others so also be assured Sir that such my orders shall be obeyed by every officer and soldier placed under my direction and such as have the hardiness to transgress them shall abide the consequences  I have been informed of late that some have hinted that such of your troops as break my orders ought to be tried and punished by your orders Even the mention of such a thing I conceive to be to use your own words in a late letter with a little variation a sort of insult that a man of military erudition in any country would be ashamed of as being repugnant to every idea of military discipline and from my opinion of your military knowledge I cannot admit that you ever hinted it  To convince you that it is my fixed determination to inquire into all abuses whether committed by my own troops or those of the Convention whilst they remain within my department I have ordered Col Henley under arrest and appointed a Court of Inquiry whereof Brig Gen Glover is President to examine into the grounds of your complaint on Wednesday next at o'clock A M at Cambridge and if any complaints have heretofore passed unredressed it is because they have not been laid before me You hinted to me when I had the pleasure of seeing you last at Cambridge that one of my officers had been enticing some of the troops of the Convention to enter our service I then informed you that if you would send the complaint I would immediately bring the officer to trial You promised  to do it but I have not yet received it I now call upon you to exhibit that charge or any other that you have to make against any officer under my command for practices of that kind or any other being with yourself fully determined that all my conduct respecting the Convention shall be notorious and beyond the powers of subterfuge to explain away Complaints of most enormous abuses have lately been made to me one of the conduct of a number of officers on the evening or night of the th of December at Bradish's tavern others of prisoners being rescued from the guardscentinels abused and insulted on their postspasses counterfeited and others filled up in the most affrontive manner and of late several highway robberies committed in the environs of the garrisonone the last evening in which a gentleman was robbed of between and dollars and a watch The robberies I do not charge to your people as it is unknown who were the perpetrators but there are several reasons to suspect it All these Sir tend not only to exasperate the troops but to enrage the inhabitants of the country who view such abuses as unsufferable I therefore call upon you to exert your endeavours to suppress all abuses as far as is in your power  I am c Signed W HEATH  Lieut Gen BURGOYNE  Col Henley was ordered under arrest and Col Lee to take the command at Cambridge and the general order of the th of January announced  Lieut Gen Burgoyne having entered a complaint against Col Henley charging him with gross misconduct while in command at Cambridge the honour of the United States and the justice due to  an officer of Col Henley's character demand a public inquiry for which purpose a Court of Inquiry is to sit at Cambridge on Wednesday next at o'clock in the morning at such place as the President shall appoint  BrigadierGeneral GLOVER  President  Col M Jackson  Col Nixon  Col Lee  Col H Jackson  Members  All persons concerned to attend the Court  Gen Burgoyne found fault that a Court of Inquiry only was appointed and not a CourtMartial He was answered that this was frequently the case that it did not preclude the latter and where an officer of rank and in particular one who had the immediate command was the object this previous step was both justifiable and proper The Court of Inquiry met and gave in their opinion and in the general orders of January th the following was announced  The Court whereof Brig Gen Glover was President appointed by the orders of the th inst to inquire into the grounds of a complaint exhibited by Lieut Gen Burgoyne against Col Henley late commanding officer of the American troops at Cambridgeafter mature consideration are of opinion that from the evidence offered on the side of Gen Burgoyne against Col Henley it will be most for the honour of Col Henley as well as for the satisfaction of all concerned that the judgment of a CourtMartial should be taken on his conduct during his command at Cambridge  The General approving the opinion of the Court orders that a special general CourtMartial sit on Tuesday next at o'clock A M at the court  house in Cambridge for the trial of Col David Henley late commanding officer at that post accused by Lieut Gen Burgoyne of a general tenor of language and conduct heinously criminal as an officer and unbecoming a man of the most indecent violent vindictive severity against unarmed men and of intentional murder

tedious trial Gen Burgoyne attended and in a very engaged and eloquent manner said every thing which he judged proper which although novel in CourtsMartial was yet permitted  The general orders of the th of February announced as follows  Col David Henley late commanding officer of the post at Cambridge tried at the special general CourtMartial whereof Brig Gen Glover was President accused by Lieut Gen Burgoyne of a general tenor of language and conduct heinously criminal as an officer and unbecoming a man of the most indecent violent vindictive severity against unarmed men and of intentional murder  The Court after mature consideration are of opinion that the charge against Col Henley is not supported and that he be discharged from his arrest  The General approves the opinion of the Court thanks them for their unwearied endeavours to investigate the truth and orders Col Henley to reassume his command at Cambridge immediately  The General thinks it to be his duty on this occasion to observe that although the conduct of Lieut Gen Burgoyne as prosecutor against Col Henley in the course of the foregoing trial in his several speeches and pleas may be warranted by some like precedents in British CourtsMartial yet as it is altogether novel in the proceedings of any general CourtMartial in the army of the United States of America whose rules and articles of war direct that the JudgeAdvocateGeneral shall prosecute in the name of the United States and as a different practice tends to render CourtsMartial both tedious and expensivehe does protest against this instance being drawn into precedent in future  thA British soldier at Cambridge stabbed one of the American guard  thIntelligence was received from Gov Cook that three frigates and twentythree sail of transports sailed from Newport on Sunday the th instant standing to the northeast Our General received a letter from the President of Congress in which he observed "I had the honour of receiving by Mr Closki the th instant your favour of the th ult including a late correspondence with Lieut Gen Burgoyne these were immediately reported to Congress and transmitted to the Board of War from whence a report has not yet ascended therefore I have no particular commands relative to your said dispatch I may however with propriety and pleasure intimate that your conduct towards the British General and his dependents receives the continued approbation of Congress if I may be permitted to make this conclusion from the general sentiments of Members"  dJust before noon Gen Lincoln arrived in Boston from Albany his leg was recovering fast but he was still very lame and was conveyed from place to place on a moveable bed with handles which was fixed on the runners of his sleigh with a canopy and curtains and was convenient also to remove into the house c In this was blended ingenuity and convenience  thIntelligence was received that the British transports destined to take away the troops of the Convention had arrived at Holmes's Hole and the next day March st that they had arrived at Cape Harbour ProvinceTown Cape Cod But Gen Burgoyne was not now to depart  March  thA cartel arrived from Cape Cod with the following letter to Gen Burgoyne  JUNO CAPE COD HARBOUR  th  March    SIR  I TAKE the earliest opportunity by Lieut Carter in the Haarlem cartel to inform you of the arrival of the transports under my charge and that I am appointed by the Viscount Howe to receive you and your suit on board the Juno under my command for your conveyance to England when you shall be at liberty to embark separately or together with the troops as you will let me know in return to be your intention And I am to acquaint you that I will move the Juno to Nantasket Road for facilitating your embarkation if you will please to inform me of your having negociated an agreement to such effect upon faith duly pledged that no insult shall be offered in the mean time to any of the ships of war or other ships and vessels appointed for fulfilling the purpose of the Convention and distinguished by flags of truce in testimony of the restriction they are under from committing any acts of hostility You are otherwise to take your passage in  the Haarlem in order to your being received on board the Juno in Cape Cod harbour  Inclosed is a list of the transports with their tonnage that you may be able to settle the proper arrangement of the troops destined for Europe for every thing else I refer you to our meeting on board the Juno where I have a number of private letters for you Gen Phillips and Col Kingston and a large box of letters for the army  I am c Signed HUGH DALRYMPLE  Lieut Gen BURGOYNE  Gen Burgoyne having written an answer to Capt Dalrymple and submitted it for inspection requested our General to send it down by the cartel which he did under the following cover  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  March    SIR  INCLOSED are sundry letters from Lieut Gen Burgoyne by which you will learn his present situation  Although I wish on every occasion to extend the utmost generosity to the gentlemen of the army yet to allow letters to pass unopened would be betraying the trust reposed in me Therefore any idea of granting such an indulgence cannot be admitted  If any advantage in the economy of expense to the government of GreatBritain may be derived from landing any overplus of provisions from the fleet for the use of the troops of the Convention I have not the least objection to it but wish you would ascertain the matter as soon as possible  I rest assured that whilst your vessels enjoy perfect security under the sanction of their flags not the least molestation or inconvenience will happen to any of our vessels or inhabitants  I do myself the pleasure to send down to the flag a turkey sent here by Gen Burgoyne  I am c Signed W HEATH  Capt DALRYMPLE  Many people having grown jealous that the troops of the Convention had collected and secreted arms in the barracks they could not be quieted until the matter was ascertained and on the th our General ordered a strict search to be made when nothing was found but the officer's fuzees to which by the Convention they had a right A  wag  coming from the barracks was asked if any thing was found he answered "Yesin one of the rooms a large brass mortar" This spread and was alarming to be sure The fact was that in one of the rooms there was a large bellmetal pestle and mortar for family use Jealousy like the other passions although a virtue in itself may exceed its bounds and when it does "trifles light as air to jealous minds are strong as proofs of holy writ"  Capt Dalrymple wrote to Gen Burgoyne again on the th and proposed to put the spare provisions on board one of the flags and send them up to Boston harbour  But on the d Capt Brathwait of the Centurion wrote the General that he had arrived at Cape Cod with orders from Viscount Howe for the menofwar and transports with the provisions on board them to return to RhodeIsland which they did accordingly  thGeneral Lincoln left Boston for Hingham our General accompanied him as far as Milton  thIntelligence was received that a gun ship had arrived at NewLondon laden with cloathing for the United States  thA detachment of Col Henley's regiment marched out of Boston for the army  thGeneral Burgoyne having again applied to Congress for leave to go to England himself they now gave him liberty This was joyous to the General and he wrote our General that he had assured himself that there would be nothing thrown in the way on his part and wished for his passports The President of Congress in his letter to our General by the same express informed him that it was late in the evening when the resolve granting Gen Burgoyne leave to depart passed and nothing was said respecting the settlement of the accounts before his departure but that it was fully his opinion that the former resolve should be strictly observed for Congress had before resolved that neither he nor the troops of the Convention should depart before the accounts were settled and paid Our General therefore told General Burgoyne that this must first be done and that then he should meet with no delay on this he hesitated and then asked how the accounts were to be settled He was answeredStrictly conformable to the resolves of Congress He then asked if Congress could be serious in their resolution requiring in specie the same sum which they had expended in paper money Our General replied that he supposed that honourable body were serious in all their resolutions He then replied that this was unjust for the odds was double and appealed to our General to say whether he thought it just himself Our General answered that as an executive officer it was not for him to judge or determine whether the orders of his superiors were just or not General Burgoyne replied that was true He was then told that if he did not choose to pay for the supplies the act allowed him to replace them in quality and quantity and this  seemed to remove his objections After further discussion the two Generals pledged their faith and sacred honour to each other in which they both had the fullest confidence that General Burgoyne should proceed to RhodeIsland accompanied by such officers as our General might think proper to send to whom General Burgoyne should pay in specie the amount of the supplies furnished in the QuarterMaster's department and that he should forward in vessels bearing flags provisions of the different species they had received within a certain number of days stipulated that no advantage should be taken by delay occasioned by stress of weather that a box of gold as a pledge for any deficiencies in the provisions should be deposited with our General the balance of which after the full settlement of the accounts to be paid to the senior officer of the troops of the Convention  April  dGeneral Burgoyne came into Boston and dined at headquarters and before he took leave of our General observed "I know your situation Sir and the difficulty of obtaining many foreign necessaries you may want or wish If you will give me a memorandum on my arrival in England I will with great pleasure forward them to you" Our General thanked him for his politeness but was careful not to mention any choosing rather to suffer with his fellowcountrymen the necessities of the times than to avail himself of so exclusive a favour  thBetween and o'clock General Burgoyne left Cambridge for RhodeIsland accompanied by Colonel Pollard and Samuel Barrett  Esq  thThe Raleigh frigate it was learnt had arrived at Portsmouth N H  A part of the Convention troops were ordered to be removed to Rutland in the county of Worcester and temporary barracks were erected for the purpose  thA division of the Convention troops marched for Rutland under escort of a detachment of militia commanded by Major Read Our General received a letter from the President of Congress dated the th instant in which he observed "Yesterday I had the honour of presenting to Congress your favour of the st and th of March and although I have received no particular commands relative to their several contents I am warranted by the general voice of Members to intimate that you have received the applause of the House for your determination respecting the adjustment of accounts with General Burgoyne"  thMr Barrett returned from RhodeIsland accompanied by a British Commissary Major Morrison who was sent on by Gen Pigot to negociate a plan for the future supply of the troops of the Convention  thAbout o'clock P M a waggon arrived from RhodeIsland with a large sum of money received in discharge of the accounts and for the troops of the Convention  The same day Mr Dean arrived from France with the highly important intelligence that the Court of France had acknowledged the Independency of the United States of America and a treaty of alliance was concluded  dFive sail of victuallers arrived in the lower harbour from RhodeIsland with provisions for a replace of those supplied the troops of the Convention  thThe British handbill for quieting America as it was called was received at Boston It was forwarded from Connecticut where it had been sent by Governor TryonGovernor Trumbull had made a most magnanimous reply  thA valuable prize was sent into Boston laden with dry goods teas flour c  May  thSeveral French ships had arrived with goods and stores from France for the United States  thThe French frigate Nymphe Capt Senneville arrived in Boston harbour and sailed out again on the th  dCertain intelligence was received that the French Ambassador left England about the th of the preceding March and that the English Ambassador had returned to England  thThe British made an excursion to Tiverton and LittleCompton and did some damage  Our General concluded with Gen Pigot a system for the future supply of the troops of the Convention by sending provisions from RhodeIsland This mode tended to the increase of provisions in the States and to the easier supply of our own troops The plan was submitted to Congress who were pleased to honour it with their approbation which they expressed in the following resolution  In  CONGRESS  May d    Resolved  That Congress approve of Maj Gen Heath's conduct relative to the proposals made by Maj Gen Pigot for supplying with provisions the troops who surrendered prisoners under the Convention of Saratoga  That the President be directed to inform Maj Gen Heath that Congress expect that all assistance afforded to the enemy in unloading storing or transporting provisions for the support of the Convention prisoners be paid for in solid coin agreeably to the spirit of their resolution of the th of December last  The Convention troops complained exceedingly of this discrimination in payment because it was  notorious that there was a considerable difference between paper money and specie indeed at first view it seems scarcely reconcileable on the principles of justice and equity but when the grounds on which the resolve of the th of Dec is predicated are considered it seems to place the matter in a different lightIt is expressed as follows  In  CONGRESS  Dec th    Whereas Sir William Howe Commander in Chief of his Britannic Majesty's forces has required that provisions should be sent in for the subsistence of the American prisoners in his possession and for the purchase of such necessaries as they may stand in need of and has prohibited the circulation of the money struck by the authority of these States within such parts of the country as are at present subjected to his power whereby great difficulties have occurred in relieving the distresses of the American prisoners and whereas large sums of continental bills of credit have been counterfeited and issued by the agents emissaries and abettors of Sir W Howe  Resolved  That the accounts of all provisions and other necessaries which already have been or which hereafter may be supplied by the public to prisoners in the power of these States shall be discharged by either receiving from the British Commissary of Prisoners or any of his agents provisions or other necessaries equal in quantity and kind to what have been supplied or the amount thereof in gold or silver at the rate of four shillings and sixpence sterling for every dollar of the currency of these States and that all these accounts be liquidated and discharged previous to the release of any prisoners to whom provisions or other necessaries shall have been so supplied  Extract from the Minutes  Signed C THOMSON  By the foregoing it appears that the British were allowed to replace any and all the supplies which were furnished to them and in that way might make all the savings in their power and certainly they ought to be checked if they attempted to destroy that currency on which the States had solely to rely for the prosecution of the war which had been  forced  upon them by this same power  June  thA British officer was shot by an American centinel on ProspectHill the officer attempting to pass contrary to the standing orders The centinel was immediately relieved and put under guard and as soon as the official account of the event was received by our General he wrote the following letter to Gen Phillips  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  June      o'clock  P M  SIR  I AM this moment informed that an officer of the Convention has been shot by one of our sentries I have ordered the man into close confinement and have directed the TownMajor to desire the Coroner of the county of Middlesex to summon a Jury of Inquest to sit on the body and I desire that it may not be removed until that step be taken I can only say Sir that

I demand liberty to send an officer to Gen Sir Henry Clinton by way of the headquarters of Gen Washington with my report of this murder  Signed W PHILLIPS Maj Gen  Maj Gen HEATH  The next morning our General wrote the following to Gen Phillips  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  June    SIR  IMMEDIATELY upon my receiving the disagreeable report the last evening that an officer of the Convention had been shot by an American centinel and that the centinel was confined I ordered him to be closely kept so and the Coroner of the county of Middlesex to be certified that a Jury of Inquest might be summoned to sit on the body of the officer Decency and the utmost attention in any country could not have done more A few minutes after I had dispatched the officer with the foregoing orders I received your letter couched in such terms that I am at a loss what epithets to give it Were it even certain that the shooting of the officer was an act of the most deliberate wilful murder why should you charge these free independent States with a bloody disposition and with rebellion and this State in particular as void of every principle of justice Although  I ever had and still have a personal regard for you and wish in every respect to treat you with the utmost generosity yet that duty which I owe to the honour and dignity of the United States will not allow me to pass unnoticed such expressions as are contained in your letter and I cannot put any other interpretation upon them than that they are a violent infraction of your parole most sacredly given I do conceive it to be my duty and I do hereby restrict you to the limits of your house gardens and yard and to the direct road from your quarters to the quarters of the troops of the Convention on Prospect and Winter Hills expecting from you a parole for propriety of conduct within those limits which if you refuse I shall be under the necessity of ordering you to narrower limits until I can obtain the pleasure of the Honorable the Congress touching this matter to whom I shall transmit your letter and crave their directions  As to your demand of liberty for an officer to proceed to Sir Henry Clinton with a  "report of this murder"  as you are pleased to express yourself I have only to reply that as soon as the Coroner has taken an inquisition in which all the evidence respecting this unhappy affair will be contained I shall transmit a copy thereof to Congress and I shall have no objection to your sending a copy also to Sir Henry Clinton by way of the headquarters of his Excellency General Washington if his Excellency should approve of it together with any just and decent representations which you may think necessary to make on this occasion or any other after I have examined such letters but as to an officer's going to Sir Henry Clinton it is altogether unnecessaryso you will please to excuse my refusal of it  I am Sir your obedient servant Signed W HEATH MajorGeneral  P S I shall not at this time comment

express orders that he the said Maj Gen Phillips be restricted to the limits of his house yards and gardens beyond which he is not to pass until it be otherwise ordered and that you immediately plant and continue by relief so many sentries as may be necessary to prevent his exceeding those limits You will give orders that the sentries so planted observe a strict decorum and soldierlike behaviour avoiding insult and behaving with becoming dignity After which you will wait on the next senior officer and acquaint him of Gen Phillips being confined  I am Sir your most obedient servant Signed W HEATH Maj Gen  Lieut Col POLLARD Dep Adj General  The same day Gen Phillips wrote our General as follows  CAMBRIDGE  June    o'clock P M  SIR  LIEUTENANT Brown of the st regiment who was shot yesterday by an American centinel died about midnight in the last night  I am informed some person whom you have sent to examine the body is now doing it and as I suppose every inspection of that sort will be over by tomorrow I would propose to bury the corpse tomorrow evening I am to desire to know if you have any objection and whether you have any particular intentions relating to the body of the murdered officer If it is to be allowed Christian burial  I would wish to deposit it in the vault appropriated for strangers in the Protestant church at Cambridge In this case I am to desire you will give the necessary permission for this purpose and allow a sufficient number of men from the barracks to assist in carrying down the corpse from the barracks to the church  As I am totally ignorant to whom it may be necessary to apply for leave to open the church it obliges me to give you this trouble and I hope if permission is granted that it may be done so fully as will prevent the sanguinary people of this country from insulting and treating with indignity the dead body of the unfortunate officer who in their rage revengeful tempers and barbarity they have put to death  I am Sir Your most obedient humble servant Signed W PHILLIPS  Maj Gen HEATH  To this letter the following was returned  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  June    SIR  YOUR's of yesterday afternoon was handed to me the last evening I most sincerely regret the unfortunate death of Lieut Brown  As I apprehend the Coroner has taken his inquisition or will do it this morning which is in conformity to the laws of the land in that case made and provided for the sole purpose of investigating the truth of factsyou not only have my permission but request that every mark of respect may be paid to the corpse of the deceased and you have my permission also for such a number of noncommissioned officers and privates to attend as may be necessary to bear the  corpse from the funeral house to the place of interment  I do not know under whose direction the church at Cambridge now is but I have given orders to Maj Hopkins and the TownMajor to afford every kind of assistance in their power and to inquire who has the direction and to obtain permission I have also given orders that decency be exhibited by our troops during the time of procession of interment which the solemnity of so mournful an occasion points out as the duty of rational beings and from the universal respectful behaviour of the people of this country on such occasions you may be sure that not the least insult will be offered  I am Sir your most obedient servant Signed W HEATH  Maj Gen PHILLIPS  thGen Phillips wrote another letter as follows  CAMBRIDGE  June th    SIR  I SHALL not animadvert upon or answer any part of your letter of yesterday except what relates to your meaning to restrict me to my house garden and yards and to the direct road from my quarters to the quarters of the troops of the Convention on Prospect and Winter Hills and requiring my signing a new parole for my propriety of conduct within those limits  When by the treaty of Convention of Saratoga the officers were to be admitted on parole it was clearly intended that a liberal interpretation was to be given of that agreement and to use your own words generous limits were to be granted I will not deny that the limits have been sufficient  I apprehend Sir that under no sense or explanation of the treaty the officers were to be denied intercourse with the soldiersindeed there is an article particularly on that point and by restricting me to my quarters allowing me only the passage to the barracks by the direct road you would certainly have restricted me as you have done several other officers from whom you have taken the benefit of their parole allowing for the distinction of my rank having obtained a quarter instead of a barrack it seemed therefore a very extraordinary proposal made to me that I should sign a parole under a restriction which deprived me of any advantage arising from my giving one according to the article on that subject in the treaty of Convention of Saratoga and on this consideration I refused it  You have Sir made me a prisoner in my quarters under a guard and I am perfectly at ease about itshall bear it Sir and any other violence of power which may happen to me with more patience than you may suppose I am very regardless about insults or injuries done me personallyI feel only and then severely when any are offered to the troops I command  But Sir you attempt at much more than restricting my person for in a paper sent me this day being your instructions to Lieut Col Pollard dated June you direct him after he has planted centinels around my quarters that he is to "wait on the next senior officer and acquaint him of General Phillips being confined" I am to inform you Sir that bearing the King's commission I shall consider myself senior officer of the troops of the Convention and every officer of them will obey my orders as far as their present situation will allow You may confine my person but cannot have power to take  from me my military place nor my connexion with the Convention troopsit is too extravagant an idea to suppose you capable of so little can it be in the power of an individual to deprive me of the commission I hold that were these Colonies really acknowledged Independent and Sovereign States it would not be in the power of their government to deprive an officer of another nation of his military commission how far soever they might stretch and extend their power over his person But Sir I must be allowed to declare that until the Colonies are acknowledged by GreatBritain to be Independent Sovereign States I cannot view them in any other light than that in which they are considered by GreatBritain  As you will not allow me to send an officer to Sir Henry Clinton I must request to take advantage of your express for sending my report and representations to him and I will beg to know when I must send you my letters  I am Sir Your most obedient humble servant Signed W PHILLIPS  Maj Gen HEATH  To which the following answer was returned the next day  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  June    SIR  ANOTHER of your favours of yesterday was handed to me this morning You may be assured that the reason of my restricting you to your quarters the day before yesterday was personally no agreeable service Duty to the honour and dignity of my country made it indispensably necessary Apprehending that so great a restriction from your  former limits as I pointed out might be construed by you a dissolution of your parole I thought it necessary and also reasonable that you should give a new one I wished that you might retain your quarters and at the same time have a free intercourse with the troops who are quartered at a distance from you this distance is so considerable that a parole is necessary I acknowledge that by the Convention you are to be admitted on parole and this parole is for propriety of conduct under such admittance but that parole being forfeited by misconduct ceases to be and confinement in proportion to the offence no breach of the Convention but fully justifiable upon every principle of reason and justice  It was never in my idea to take away your commission or dissolve your connexion with the troops of the Convention but while under confinement your power of acting might with propriety be suspended so far as respected the transacting of public business between myself and you but personal regard has prevented my going that length any further than to notify the next officer of your confinement  I do not insist that you as an officer in the British army are obliged to view the Free Independent and Sovereign States of America in any other light than they are acknowledged by the government whose service you are in But under your present situation and circumstances I do insist that you shall not openly insult the honour and dignity of these Sovereign States with impunity  I am Sir Your obedient servant Signed W HEATH MajorGeneral  Maj Gen PHILLIPS  Middlesex  ss  AN inquest taken at Cambridge within the said county of Middlesex on the th of June

a Letter from MajorGeneral  HEATH  to the President of Congress dated HeadQuarters Boston June    SINCE my last of the th instant I have received the honour of your's of the d by Capt Nevers  The day before yesterday one of our centinels posted at the foot of ProspectHill shot a Lieut Richard Brown of the troops of the Convention for not stopping when repeatedly challenged as he was riding out of the lines with two women The orders given to the centinels being not to allow any officer without sidearms or noncommissioned officer private soldier woman or child without a written passport to pass the chain of sentries Immediately upon my receiving the report of the officer's being shot and that the centinel was confined I gave orders for his being kept so and notice to be given to the Coroner of the county of Middlesex that a Jury of Inquest might sit on the body for the investigation of the truth of facts at the same time I wrote to Maj Gen PhillipsI do myself the honour to inclose copy thereof No a few minutes after I received a paper from him No the next morning I again wrote him No and a parole No and gave Col Pollard written orders for the delivery thereof No Gen Phillips refusing to sign the parole Col Pollard in obedience to my orders restricted him to the limits therein mentioned and planted three centinels around the house and gardens in which state matters now remain  In  CONGRESS  July    Resolved  That Congress approve of Maj Gen Heath's conduct respecting Maj Gen Phillips consequent  upon the death of Lieut Richard Brown of the troops of the Convention  Extract from the Minutes  CHARLES THOMSON Secretary  The whole of the foregoing correspondence was published by order of Congress and our General was informed that it was left for him to conduct towards the British General as to the continuance of his arrest as he might judge the honour of the United States required Gen Phillips continuing to exhibit the same temper or it rather growing upon him he was continued in his arrest until the troops of the Convention were ordered to be removed to Charlotteville in Virginia It has before been observed that the officers had certain articles prescribed to them for their government in quarters and that these were drawn into the parole and subscribed by them If any abuses took place a Court of Inquiry was directed to investigate the complaints and report to our General thus giving the accused officers an opportunity to exculpate their conduct if it was in their power and no officer could wish more than our General to treat them with generosity and indulgence as far as was compatible with good order and discipline But notwithstanding the fairness of this mode of procedure Gen Phillips forbid the officers appearing before any Court so appointed and on the th ult Mr Bibby the DeputyAdjutant General to the troops of the Convention came into a Court of Inquiry and declared the following which in order to have the whole together we now retrospect  Maj Gen Phillips will not permit any officer under his command to be brought before a Court of Inquiry of the American troops for the purpose of scrutinizing their conduct but if any complaints  are lodged against any British officers and Maj Gen Heath shall desire their conduct to be inquired into Maj Gen Phillips will give such orders as are customary in such cases among the British troops  By order of Maj Gen Phillips  Signed THOS BIBBY Dep Adj Gen  MONDAY  May    The same day Gen Phillips sent a letter to our General expressive of the same sentiments to which the following answer was sent to him  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  May    SIR  YOUR favour of yesterday came to hand the last evening and I must confess contained matter novel and surprising to me What ideas of a copartnership in command you have entertained I cannot tell From the beginning I have found a disposition in the senior officer of the Convention to assume the right and authority of trying and punishing offenders for breaches of my orders This I ever have and ever shall view in no other light than that of insult As such I represented it to his Excellency Lieut Gen Burgoyne whose good sense and thorough knowledge of discipline led him in a letter to me of the th Jan to yield the matter in the following words "I do not mean to deny that you have a right to take justice into your own hands" Indeed it is a subject concerning which having heretofore said and wrote very fully I shall not at this time dwell long upon As to agreement or copartnership in command it is absurd In military command there must be one supreme head at present the Honorable Congress have honoured me with the command of this department and I imagined that no officer within its limits would dare dispute it  My orders as I have repeatedly heretofore declared shall ever be founded on the principles of honour reason and justice and not to infringe those delicate principles in others so I again declare that such my orders shall not be broken or disputed by any officer or soldier placed under my direction with impunity The matter of command is no hidden mystery the usage and customs of nations are known The celebrated Vattel Puffendorff and Grotius with whose writings I dare say you are acquainted elegantly explain how an army that submits to another whether the conditions are more or less honorary to themselves are to conduct whilst they remain within the limits of the victors' camp or jurisdiction of their country But I shall not spend time to reason on a subject which would reflect dishonour on myself to allow even to be disputed Therefore to sum up all in few wordsthat as I am determined to treat the troops of the Convention with strict justice and generosity so I am determined that all offenders against my standing orders of the garrison shall be brought to proper punishment that I will not allow the senior officer of those troops to try or punish for any offence against my orders and that the truth may at all times be properly investigated I shall from time to time when occasion requires appoint Courts of Inquiry for that purpose and such as presume to dispute or counteract them I shall duly notice  I am c Signed W HEATH MajorGeneral  Maj Gen PHILLIPS  Gen Phillips finding that he could not get any thing by assault he next tried his skill in attempting to sap with the policy of friendship he therefore  wrote another letter of the same date under the name of  "Private"  MONDAY  May th    SIR  I HAVE this morning written to you a letter upon public matters I will now assure you that I am sorry that my earnest desire of preserving a communication of intelligence between you and I does not meet your consent and I will lament that you will attend to the sudden reports you receive so fully and act upon them without that goodhumoured attention to me which I had hoped and have endeavoured should subsist between us You and I are nearly of an ageI will not dispute understandings with you but I certainly am an older soldier and must necessarily know the customs of armies Allow me to assure you the manner with which things are taken up sometimes deviates from military rule It is a fixed custom to go from the head downwards and when an Ensign offends against order the  General  does not condescend to altercate with  him  but sends his orders his desire or his opinion to the commanding officers and in your sending messages to young officers it injures your own consequence and certainly hurts mine Believe me that I am strict against any breach of orders and will never suffer it to pass uncensured I allow the two officers have behaved ill and I will punish them but the getting the countersign was an effect of good humour and simplicity in an American soldier Let me once more request of you to recollect your own situation and it will put mine in a clear view to you Whenever you have reports against any of our troops let me know them and I will give instant attention to them but you will I am sure immediately  feel that sending a threat to two officers that you would send them on board a prisonship and never informing me wherefore was not strictly conformable to good humour or good discipline  I am with a very hearty desire of preserving harmony and order and with much personal regard  Your's c Signed W PHILLIPS  Maj Gen HEATH  To which the following answer was returned  HEADQUARTERS BOSTON  May    SIR  HAVING in my other letter of this date answered your's of yesterday I now reply to your favour of the same date which you are pleased to stile  "private"  I can assure you Sir that no person living wishes to act with good humour more than I do or would take more pains to cultivate harmony and a good understanding But in the present case you must not expect that I shall allow myself either by frowns or flatteries to give up the dignity of command reposed in me  I wish I am determined to extend every act of generosity towards the officers of the Convention which is compatible with the safety and honour of my country I shall not take up matters suddenly or proceed rashly unless circumstances shall render it unavoidably necessary and although you may be possessed of a greater share of understanding than I am and an older soldieryet I have endeavoured to acquire a knowledge of my duty and the customs of armies and nations I am not conscious of any deviations from those rules or customs in general adopted by them  The General who commands is undoubtedly the fountain of power and all orders should descend  from him through the proper officers until they are communicated to the lowest order of the army and that commander who disputes with or threatens young officers undoubtedly lessens his consequence and will soon become contemptible in the eyes of an army Nothing of this was in the late transactions that I know of having received a report of the conduct of the two officers I ordered them to be confined to their quarters and appointed a Court of Inquiry to examine into the grounds of the complaint that I might have a clear understanding of the affair and order accordingly In all cases where you or the troops of the Convention are immediately corcerned in the orders I have always directed that you should be served with a copy As to any threatnings being sent to the two officers of confining them on board a guardship I know nothing of it  The main difficulty seems to arise from your apprehension that you are to try and punish all offenders against my orders Here Sir notwithstanding your knowledge and age in soldiery you much mistake and cannot support those your pretensions by any rule or authority civil or military The moment you piled your arms and marched off the ground you became subject to the standing orders of the victor and in every jurisdiction through which you marched or where you remain are subject to all the orders and laws of the place and such as violate them are obnoxious to punishment The law and custom of nations explicitly tell us who are to try and punish and although I do not in the least doubt your ready disposition to inquire into and even to punish offenders against my ordersyet when you attempt it it is such an indignity offered to my authority that you may be assured it ever will raise my resentment and if it did not I am confident that yourself at least hereafter and  all military men would despise me for my insensibility In a word Sir cultivate those principles of obedience to orders among the officers in your situation recommended and inculcated by the custom and usage of nations and dictated by reasonand you may depend that I shall exert myself to make your situation as agreeable as possible and you may be also assured that I never shall require that of the troops of the Convention which in the opinion of the just and wise in any country shall reflect dishonour on them With the strongest desire to cultivate and maintain harmony and to treat you with respect and with much personal regard  I am c Signed W HEATH  Maj Gen PHILLIPS  The same  feelings  which had great weight in the beginning of the war continued for some time namely that GreatBritain was one of the greatest and most powerful nations in the world in arts and in arms while the Americans were yet their Colonies young weak and but barely civilized ignorant of the world and especially so of arts and of arms Hence we see it so frequently breaking out until experience had taught them a different opinion There was frequently as in the atmosphere placid intervals but whenever any cross wind happened to blow and there is no season or circumstances without them then instantly appeared those ideas of selfsuperiority and contempt for the Americans which was the true cause of many uncomfortable hours Mankind have the same passions the difference lies in some riding with a double curb while others give the reins  This Convention business was a heavy task for our General and the whole subject would form an entertaining  volume of itself we are now circumscribed by our limits and have only given a small specimen for mankind to form an opinion for themselves In all the letters or conversation which was had on the occasion we find scarcely a reflection cast by our General on the British nation the cause in which they were engaged or against any who were fortunate or unfortunate but a uniform desire to make those placed under his orders as comfortable as circumstances would admit at the same time an unshaken determination a perseverant watchfulness with decent language to defend the cause and honour of his own country by arguments supported by the customs and maxims of the civilized world The hundreds of letters on file are all proofs of this and in many instances it was politely acknowledged  The two following letters of different dates are some of the specimensMajor Harnage had his lady with him  CAMBRIDGE  October th    SIR  WITH great pleasure I acknowledge the favour of your obliging letter and Mrs Harnage joins me with Capt Hawker in returning you our sincere thanks for your kind representation of us and solicitation in our favour to the Honorable Congress  With your leave we shall with patience wait the result and let the Congress determine in what manner they please our obligations to you Sir will be ever acknowledged  Believe me Sir with respect Your obliged humble servant HENRY HARNAGE  Maj Gen HEATH  CAMBRIDGE  June    SIR  BEING this moment informed that you are about to quit Boston I must beg leave previous to your departure to trouble you with these our acknowledgments for the civility and attention you have been pleased to shew us and to assure you that Mrs Harnage Capt Hawker and myself shall ever retain a due sense of all favours by which you have kindly endeavoured to alleviate and make easy the restraints and disagreeable circumstances that unavoidably attend our present situation  We hope you will mention us to the gentleman who is to succeed to the command in the Eastern Department  Wishing you all personal happiness I remain with respect Sir  your most obedient and Obliged humble servant HENRY HARNAGE  The Hon Maj Gen HEATH  thA Spanish xebeck and a French cutter arrived at Boston with dispatches from their respective Courts which were forwarded to Congress  thCertain intelligence was received that the British had left Philadelphia  July  thIntelligence was received that a warm action happened on the th ult between Gen Washington's and Gen Clinton's armies near Monmouth courthouse in the Jersies Gen Clinton having taken the resolution to move from Philadelphia to NewYork through the Jersies commenced his movements accordingly encumbered with an immense train of stores and baggage which occupied some miles in length and these are the greatest incumbrance to a General on a march of danger from  an attack of his opponent to which he can be exposed  Gen Washington was no sooner apprised of this intention and movement of the British General than he made his arrangements accordingly crossed the Delaware and pushed detached corps forward to obstruct the advance gall the flanks and fall on the rear of the enemy while he moved on with the body of his army By the th Gen Clinton had got on as far as Monmouth and Gen Washington's detached troops were on his flanks and close on his rear Here the British General took a wise resolution to make a stand with a part of his best troops while he pushed on his baggage through the difficult defiles under the careful and experienced hand of Gen Kniphausen  Gen Washington acting with equal skill and equal bravery made every arrangement which the moment called for On the morning of the th he ordered Maj Gen Lee to attack the enemy's rear himself moving on briskly to support him but to his surprise as he advanced on he met Lee's troops retreating and the enemy impetuously pursuing Here was Gen Washington seen in all his splendor for this critical situation is the orb in which he shines the brightest He rallied the retreating troops he inspired them by precept and by example and the misfortune of the morning was considerably retrieved  The Americans fought bravely and so did the British After hard fighting in a most intense hot day when scores died of the heat and drinking too freely of cold water when they could find it both armies remained on the ground The Americans determined to recommence the action early on the next morning but Gen Clinton finding that his baggage had struggled pretty well through the defiles  and had got tolerably well advanced took the advantage of the cool of the night to slip off unperceived by the Americans and got to ground where he was safe Some sharp words took place between Gen Washington and Maj Gen Lee as the one advanced and the other retreated which issued in the arrest trial and suspension of the latter Gen Washington reported to Congress that the Americans buried of the British officers and privates among the former the Hon Col Monckton who was a brave and experienced officer and that there were a few prisoners The American loss killed LieutenantColonel Major Captains Lieutenants Serjeant rank and filewounded Colonels Captains FirstLieutenants SecondLieutenants Ensign Adjutant Serjeants Drummer rank and filemissing Serjeants rank and file of the artillery one FirstLieutenant Matrosses and Bombadier were killedone Captain Serjeant Corporal Gunner and Matrosses woundedone Matross missingsix horses killed and two wounded Both Generals undoubtedly have much credit for their conduct in this action Gen Clinton's object being to reach NewYork with his baggage c obtained this victory with the loss which he sustained Gen Washington's conduct was well calculated for victory on his side and how far he would have succeeded had it not been for the misfortune of the morning none can tell This misfortune began by exposing the American advanced troops in line on the side of the field where they were cannonaded by the British who at the same time wisely exposed only their artillery to that of the Americans It is to be remembered that men may be led on to action in the face of a cannonade before which they will not  stand  the point of decision is in the mind  while advancing although galled by the fire of their opponents the dead and wounded are left behind them as they fall and the troops feel an ardour for arriving in a few minutes at a point where they can use their own arms to retaliate for the injury they sustain But when men are placed open to the fire of the artillery of their enemy at such a distance as to prevent the use of their own arms in their defence the dead and wounded fall and lie among them or are drawn away and every groan they make is heard The troops soon conceive that they are placed as marks to be shot at while the greater policy of the enemy keeps their column or line out of the rake of their cannon the mind gives way and retreat will be inevitable This was experienced in this instance and the fairest hopes of a noble onset in a few minutes blasted and these were some of the best troops in the army too It was here that the firm Col Wesson had his back peeled of its muscles almost from shoulder to shoulder by a cannonball The confidence of the troops could not be fully recovered until they saw the presence of their beloved General  thIntelligence was received that the Count D'Estaing had arrived with the fleet under his command off the Capes of Delaware The fleet consisted of sail of the line and frigates Off the coast of Virginia they took a privateer fitted out of NewYork of gunsa ship bound from New Providence to Londonrecaptured a French snow laden with dry goods and drove a British ship of war on shore  thIntelligence was received that about men said to be invalids had arrived at RhodeIsland from NewYork  stIntelligence was received that a body o  refugees and Indians had destroyed the town of Wy…oming  on the Susquehannah and butchered many of the inhabitants The same day it was learnt that Gen Washington had crossed Hudson's River with the main army except Gen Wayne's brigadethat Count D'Estaing had appeared off Sandy Hookthat the inhabitants of NewYork were in great consternation and that the Marquis de la Fayette with Glover's and Varnum's brigades were on their march for Providence  The British were very busy in fortifying RhodeIsland  th and thSent for Providence flints five tons hard bread a quantity of dry fish c and sent a large number of the large flatbottomed boats to Weymouth they were to be conveyed taking the advantage of the river to the vicinity of RhodeIsland Half of Col Craft's regiment of State artillery were ordered to Tiverton the other half of the regiment of artillery and a draft from the militia to the number of men including before ordered were to march and reinforce Maj Gen Sullivan in the State of RhodeIsland On the th at noon the Count D'Estaing's squadron came to anchor off Point Judith and at evening stretched a line from that Point to Secunnet  stThe regiment of State artillery with brass pounders and brass howitzers marched for Tiverton and the next day the marine mortar was sent on slung under two pair of stout cartwheels The British sloop of war Kingfisher a rowgalley and a sloop stationed near Secunnet upon the approach of a French frigate were run on shore by their own crews set on fire and left to burn and blow up Maj Bumstead's company of Boston artillery with two brass fieldpieces and Lieut Dunnel with a detachment of the Continental artillery with two fieldpieces marched for Rhode  Island and the militia and volunteers were on their march that way and large quantities o  military stores and provisions were going from hence  August  thMajorGeneral Hancock with his suit went for RhodeIsland to take the command of the militia The same morning Gen Sullivan made a landing on the island without opposition About the same time the Count D'Estaing with his squadron passed the British batteries at Newport when there was a brisk cannonade on both sides Many of the shot struck in the town and the inhabitants were in much consternation not knowing in what place they were safe A shot entered the door of the house of Mrs Mason a widow lady a little above the floor as the family were passing from room to room not knowing where the next shot might strike young Mr Mason passing through the entry found the black man of the family sitting with his back against the shothole in the door on being asked why he sat there he answered "Master you never know two shot to go in the same place" Under this idea he was tranquil Lord Howe's fleet appeared in the Offing consisting of sail of the line and frigates  thThe Count came to sail and stood out and the British fleet stood offthe wind very fresh  thA most severe storm of wind and rain which stripped many trees of their fruit and tore others up by the roots c  The troops on RhodeIsland under the command of Gen Sullivan were on the th including officers exclusive of some volunteers from NewHampshire and other corps arranged as follows  Varnum's brigade including officers    Glover's    Cornell's    Greene's    Lovell's    Titcomb's    Livingston's advance    West's reserve    Artillery    Total    These were encamped at and near QuakerHill The storm destroyed a great number of cartridges owing to the badness of the boxes A fresh supply was sent on from Boston  thThe army advanced and in the afternoon arrived within two miles of the enemy without the least opposition Gen Washington with the main army was at the White Plains in the State of NewYork said to be about strong Seventeen transports with troops from Gen Howe's army at NewYork failed for RhodeIsland but finding the French squadron in the way could not come to the place  On the evening of the th Gen Sullivan took possession of some high grounds which commanded the enemy's works on their right and was not discovered until morning when they began to cannonade the Americans but did them no damage which was continued the next day without injury  On the night of the th the covered way was nearly completed and also two batteries of cannon The enemy fired or shot but did no other damage than slightly wounding two men  thThe American works were advanced nearer to the enemy and on the th they had one man killed and two wounded by the enemy's cannon In the afternoon the Count D'Estaing returned to Newporthis own ship the Languedoc was totally dismasted in the storm and lost her rudder In this  situation an English gun ship of Lord Howe's squadron came across her and got under her stern where she did the Languedoc some small damage but on wearing the Languedoc so as to bring some of her heavy metal to bear the Englishman bore away The Marseilles a lost her foremast in the storm and the Cesar a parted from the squadron  dIn the afternoon the Cesar came to anchor in the lighthouse channel Boston lower harbour After parting from the squadron in the storm she fell in with a British gun ship with whom she was engaged for near three glasses and would have taken her had not some other English ships hove in fight The Cesar had men killed and wounded about of which were of the former and the Captain among the latter who lost an arm On his being brought up to Boston our General immediately paid him a visit and expressed to him his regret for the arm he had lost to which the Captain replied although very weak through the great loss of blood he had sustainedthat he was ready to lose his other arm in the cause of the Americans Remember this ye Americans in future times  The same day the enemy threw or shells at our troops on RhodeIsland two men only were wounded and the fire briskly returned The Count D'Estaing determined to come round with his squadron to Boston and Gen Sullivan must retreat to the north end of the island  thMaj Gen Hancock returned to Boston The volunteers were coming home  On the morning of the th the Count D'Estaing with his squadron arrived in Nantasket Road and the next day the Count came up to town  On the th there was a smart action between the British and Americans towards the north end of  RhodeIsland which terminated in favour of the latter The most severe part of this action was at the hollow between Butt'sHill and QuakerHill a ground situated for slaughter on both sides rather than for decisive victory on either Col Jackson's regiment of continental troops and Gen Lovell's brigade of militia are said to have distinguished themselves and the artillery drove off two frigates that attempted to cover the enemy's flank The Americans had about men killed and wounded The loss of the enemy unknown  On the evening of the th Gen Sullivan left the island and on the morning of the st an express from Plymouth brought intelligence that sail of topsail vessels were seen off that place the evening beforesome of them very large ships In consequence of this intelligence our General the President of the Council Gen Hancock and others went down the harbour to confer with the Count D'Estaing  The next day  September  st the Count came up to town with a number of his officers and was to dine with our General Just as the company were going to sit down the signal guns announced the appearance of the fleet and which were visible from the town Mr John Cutler having discovered them from the steeple of the Old South meetinghouse appearing to be about sail eight of which at least were two deckers The Count immediately put off for the squadron Several of the islands next to the road had been fortified and the squadron moored in order to give a warm reception to the British should they attempt to enter the road A number of regiments of the militia of the vicinity were ordered to march immediately to the Castle Dorchester Heights Boston Noddle's Island c Several signal guns were heard in the bay the latter part of  the night and the next morning the fleet was out of sight The militia which were coming in were countermanded Admiral Byron's squadron arrived a few days before at Sandy Hook The enemy made a descent on NewBedford and did considerable damage they also made a demand on the inhabitants of Martha's Vineyard for a large number of cattle sheep c  thAn affray happened in Boston between some American and French sailors two French officers in attempting to part them were much woundedone of them a Major of the fleet died of the wounds on the th  BrigadierGeneral Speckt the eldest Brigadier of the Hessian troops under the Convention wrote a letter to our General in which he informed him that being advanced in age he had but little taste for those pleasures and amusements which please the young and gay but he had not lost his taste for sporting with his gun and requested that he might do it within the limits of his parole Nothing could be more pleasing to our General than to gratify this brave veteran soldier he therefore wrote him the following answer  HEADQUARTERS

use of are generally uncommonly bloody  The Languedoc the Count's ship having been completely repaired fell down to Nantasket Road and joined the squadron  thGen du Portail the Chief Engineer of the

defeated our army under the command of General Robert Howe The American loss was said to be about officers and near men killed wounded and taken prisoners This event threw the whole State of Georgia into the hands of the British The American General was accused of misconduct and a long time after brought to trial and honourably acquitted The British here practised art and force was obliged to yield to it Their light infantry finding their way through the path in the swamp bringing of them on the flank and in the rear of the Americans where they were not expected or not guarded against proved their overthrow A few shots on the flank or rear of an enemy serves to disconcert them more than a heavy fire in the front The point of decision here lies not in the force but in the mind A company of men cannot fire more shots in the same given time on the flank or in the rear than they could in the front but these few shots will have more effect on the minds of the enemy than the fire of a whole regiment in their front The Americans were vastly inferior in numbers to the British and must at any rate have been forced from the ground but the British lightinfantry passing through the swamp was the first misfortune  The Continental currency was now greatly depreciated Provisions very scarce and dear flour especially so and many families in Boston almost destitute of this necessary

Continental Village A deserter came in from the enemy  dCol Rufus Putnam reconnoitred the enemy's positions at Verplank's and Stoney Points At evening a deserter came in from the enemy  About of the enemy's lighthorse and lightinfantry came out from MileSquare and attacked Col Sheldon's lighthorse who were posted at Poundridge about in number The superior force of the enemy obliged our horse at first to retreat but being reinforced by the militia they in turn pursued the enemy Our loss was one Corporal one Trumpeter and eight privates wounded three Serjeants one Corporal and four privates

Soundlanded and took possession of NewHavenplundered and insulted the inhabitants and left the place  thThe enemy landed at Fairfield and burnt many houses c  thAbout o'clock P M our General received orders from Gen Washington to march with the two Connecticut brigades by the way of Crom Pond towards Bedford The next morning although rainy the first brigade marched to the Village  thThe storm ceasing the tents although as wet as water could make them were struck and the troops took up their line of march reaching Amiwalk about sunsetting A report having been spread in the fore part of the day that the enemy  were at or near Pine's Bridge our General ordered the baggagewaggons under proper escort to file off to the left and pursue a road running parallel with the one on which the column was moving thereby keeping the column between the enemy and the waggons Both arrived on the ground of encampment within a few minutes of each other The troops lay on their arms without pitching their tents The enemy continued their depredations at the Sound and burnt some houses at Norwalk  thAt o'clock A M the troops took up their line of march and reached Ridgefield where they halted for the night The next morning our General sent off all the tents and other baggage to Danbury and took up his line of march towards Stamford When he ascended the high grounds in sight of the Sound the enemy's fleet was observed under sail standing off and on between Stamford and LongIsland About o'clock two deserters from Gen Clinton's army came to our troops they had left the British army two or three hours before at which time the enemy were on the point of making a movement the corps of guides and pioneers being then assembled at Gen Clinton's quarters This called for the exercise of discretion The troops on board the transports with Gen Tryon if the whole should land were far inferior to the force with our General but the main British army with General Clinton was by far superior to his If the whole of the Americans had marched down to Stamford Clinton by five or six hours forced marching might have crossed his rear and have cut him off from a communication with the Highlands he therefore resolved to march forward to the Cross Roads one of which went directly to the British army another to Stamford and in his rear to the Highlands Here he took a position in order of  battle and detached Col Starr's and Meig  's r  ments with one fieldpiece to Stamford whose  proach towards the town in open view would prevent Tryon from landing or in case he did with superior force the detachment might be surrounded In this situation the troops remained until dusk and then took a more advantageous position for the night the whole lying on their arms in order of battle Early on the morning of the th our General received information that the shipping had gone down towards NewYork he therefore moved and took a strong position between Ridgefield and Bedford sending out patroles of horse and foot on all the roads This movement towards the Sound quieted the minds of the people and saved Stamford and other towns from destruction  While the attention of both the grand armies and of the adjacent country was turned towards the Sound the Great WASHINGTON ordered General Wayne to strike at Stoney Point with the lightinfantry which lay not far distant from that post This was done with great promptitude the works being carried by assault and the whole garrison made prisoners of war with all the artillery ammunition stores c This was a most brilliant affair  In advancing to the assault the front of the American column led with unloaded arms relying solely on the use of the bayonet As they approached the works a soldier insisted on loading his pieceall was now a profound silencethe officer commanding the platoon ordered him to keep on the soldier observed that he did not understand attacking with his piece unloaded he was ordered not to stop at his peril he still persisted and the officer instantly dispatched him A circumstance like this shocks the feelings but it must be considered how fatal the consequence would have been if one single gun  had been fired scores would have lost their lives and most probably defeat have been consequent and therefore this was the lesser evil  On the morning of the th signal guns were heard in the Sound towards NewYork at intervals from two o'clock until daylight Gen Clinton's army moved to MileSquare  Stoney Point having been taken with so much eclat to the American arms Gen Washington determined an attempt on Verplank's Point on the east side of the Hudson and opposite to Stoney Point for this purpose Maj Gen Howe with two brigades and some pounders on travelling carriages was ordered to proceed by the way of Peek's Kill throw a bridge over the creek move on to the point and open batteries against the enemy's works while a cannonade and bombardment was kept up across the river from Stoney Point  thAt about o'clock A M our General while out reconnoitring received by an express from Gen Washington orders to move as expeditiously as possible to Peek's Kill where he would find Gen Howe with two brigades Our General was to take the command of the whole and carry into effect the orders which had been given to Gen Howe Our General returned immediately to the troops and at o'clock began his march towards Peek's Killmarched until dusk miles when the troops halted and laid down to rest on the side of the road the dragoons not unsaddling their horses At o'clock the next morning the troops resumed their march and in the afternoon our General received information from Gen Howe by express that Gen Clinton was on full march with his whole army towards Verplank's Point an answer was returned at what point the troops then were and that they were marching as fast as the men could  endure and would continue so until they reached him When the troops had advanced a little to the westward of Drake's farm Col Movian came up from Gen Howe with information that a part of Clinton's army were then above the New Bridge on Croten river pushing for the point and that he w  retreating from the point as fast as possible On this our General ordered Gen Huntington with his brigade and two fieldpieces to push forward as fast as the troops could march and keep in breath and take a position on the high ground to the south of Peek's Kill which commands the road to the point and also that to the New Bridge on Croten river and ordered a regiment to file off to the right and secure the pass over the hills between Drake's and Peek's Kill and also ordered the flankguard on the left to be reinforced and to send out small flankguards still further from its flank The troops moving on with the utmost expedition to the ground which Gen Huntington had been ordered forward to secure Every moment that passed was expected to announce the commencement of an action between the advanced or flanking parties of the two armies but it did not take place At this moment Gen Washington having learnt how matters stood and that possibly Gen Clinton might attempt to push into the Highlands sent an express to our General to move into the Highlands immediately which was done just after dark the troops passing the night on Bald Hill It was generally the opinion that if our General had not been at hand to advance in the manner he did that Gen Clinton by a forced march of his light troops backed by his army would have got in the rear of Gen Howe before he could have possibly gained the road at Peek's Kill and between his army and a sally from the garrison of Verplank's Point inevitably cut off the  whole Our troops at Stoney Point cannonaded and bombarded the enemy's works at Verplank's during  whole day and until near midnight The post  evacuated and the Washington galley was  up  thThe troops moved from Bald Hill Par  s brigade to Robinson's Huntington's and Patterson's to Nelson's

soldiers belonging to the Massachusetts regiments who had enlisted at different periods subsequent to January for three years pretending that their time of service now expired although many of them had months to serve before their three years service was completed marched off with intent to go home they were pursued and brought back some of them were punished the greater part of them pardoned Some others at other posts conducted in the same manner and were treated as the first mentioned Those whose time of service was expired were all discharged with honour  dThe snow had got to be about four feet deep on a level and the troops were driven to great difficulties in keeping open the communications to the postsobtaining provisions fuel forage c and so intense and steady was the weather

out of reach and threatened the destruction of the whole redoubt A detachment from WestPoint was ordered over to the assistance of the garrison of the redoubt but so strongly dovetailed and strapped were the timbers of the rampart that the fire for a time seemed to baffle every exertion to extinguish it The ammunition and about barrels of salted provisions in the magazine were seasonably removed by the garrison but the fire was not extinguished until about four o'clock on the morning of the th All the officers and men distinguished themselves on this occasion but the conduct of Col Lyman Col Sprout and Capt Drew were conspicuous indeed as was that of a Serjeant of the garrison of the redoubt who when all were on the point of quitting the redoubt lest the magazine should take fire and blow up instantly rushed into the magazine and did not quit it until he had thrown out every cask of powder and box of ammunition deposited in it If his name could be recollected it should be inserted

the latter under the command of Captain Lockwood the whole about marched to Morrissania and about one o'clock in the morning made an attack on Col Hatfield They first attacked the picket killed and drove the rest into the Colonel's quarters The Colonel and his men took to the chambers and fired out at the windows and down stairs at those who had entered the house it appearing difficult if possible to dislodge them the house was instantly set on fire by putting a straw bed into a closet which compelled the enemy to jump out at the chamber windows to avoid the flames Colonel Hatfield one Captain one Lieutenant one QuarterMaster and privates were taken prisoners and brought off This was a pretty affair but was a little tarnished on the return by some of the militia who were fatigued loitering on the road where they supposed there was no danger but a party of horse pursuing overtook killed and captured several of them  thBetween and o'clock at night a fire broke out in the QuarterMaster's barrack at WestPoint which threatened the most serious and extensive damage It had got to considerable height before it was discovered the barrack was consequently consumed to ashes notwithstanding every  exertion of the garrison which was numerous Brig Gen Patterson who commanded the garrison not only distinguished himself but also exposed his person to the flames to save another building which was fortunately effected The loss by the fire was considerable both to the public and to individuals The night before viz the th a detachment of the enemy said to consist of men made an excursion from Staten Island over the ice to ElizabethTown in the Jersies and completely surprised the picket posted there consisting of a Major and men properly officered it was said that not a gun was fired nor a man hurt The enemy surrounded the houses and took the troops asleepHe who suffers himself to be surprised through the want of proper precaution his character says a great military writer is irretrievable  February  stAt two o'clock in the morning the north redoubt was discovered to be on fire again in the top of the bombproof between the sallyport and the door Every exertion was made by the garrison of the redoubt and detachments sent to their aid to put out the fire but it was so much out of reach and spread among the joints of the large timbers that it was not extinguished until about two o'clock on the morning of the d The redoubt received considerable damage and would have been totally destroyed had it not been for the unwearied exertions of the troops day and night during the whole of the time and much credit was due to Lieut Col Vose and the other officers who commanded By a more accurate account of the loss at the QuarterMaster's barrack at WestPoint it appeared that marques horseman's tents common tents knapsacks narrow axes and a number of other articles were burnt and destroyed  On the morning of the d about o'clock the  enemy made an attack on Lieut Col Thomson who commanded the troops on the lines the Colonel's force consisted of men in five companies properly officered they were instructed to move between Croten River and the White Plains Hudson's River and Bedford never to remain long at any one place that the enemy might not be able to learn their manner of doing duty or form a plan for striking them in any particular situation The Colonel had for some days taken post himself at  Young's  not far from the White Plains Capt Watson with his company was with the Lieut Colonel Capt Roberts and Capt Stoddard with their companies were on the right Capt Lieut Farley and Capt Cooper on the left The force of the enemy consisted of the four flank companies of the first and second British regiments of guardsdetachments from two Hessian battalionssome mounted yaugers and mounted refugees The whole under the command of Col Norton of the guards The roads were so filled with snow that the enemy advanced but slowly and were obliged to leave their fieldpieces behind on the road They were discovered at a distance by Mr Campbell one of our guides who from the goodness of his horse reconnoitred them pretty near He gave the LieutenantColonel notice of their advancing and that their force was considerable and advised him to take a stronger position a little in his rear But the LieutenantColonel was very confident that the enemy were only a body of horse and that he could easily disperse them and would not quit his ground The enemy first attacked a small advanceguard consisting of a Serjeant and men who behaved well and meant to reach the main body in season but were prevented by the horse and all taken prisoners The enemy's horse soon appeared in sight of the Americans and discharged their rifles at long  shot and waited the coming up of the infantry when a warm action commenced the enemy scattered taking the advantage of the ground and trees in the orchard and closing up on all sides The companies of the detachment which had joined fought well After about minutes' sharp conflict our troops broke some took into the house and others made off the enemy's horse rushing on at the same instant and the whole shouting At this time the two flank companies came up but finding how matters stood judged it best to retreat Capt Stodder's company giving a fire or two at long shot Capt Cooper's from their distance not firing at all Some who were engaged effected their escape others were overtaken by the horse The enemy collected what prisoners they could set Mr Young's house and buildings on fire and returned Of the Americans were killed dead on the spot and Capt Roberts who was mortally wounded lived but a few minutes Seventeen others were wounded several of whom died Lieut Col Thomson of Marshall's Capt Watson of Greaton's Capt Lieut Farley of Wesson's Lieut Burley of Tupper's Lieut Maynard of Greaton's Ensign Fowler of Nixon's Ensign Bradley of Bigelow's with others were taken prisoners The enemy left men dead on the field and a Captain of grenadiers was wounded in the hip and a Lieutenant of infantry in the thigh The British in their account of the action acknowledged that they had men killed and wounded Lieut Col Badlam with the relief for the lines was at the time of the action far advanced on his march but not within reach of those engaged  One Mayhew a pedler well known in Massachusetts was of this detachment he made off up the road but finding the horse rushing on he struck off into the snow almost up to his hips Two of the  enemy's horse turned into his track after him and gaining fast upon him he asked them if they would give him quarter they replied "Yes you dog we will quarter you" This was twice repeated when Mayhew finding them inflexible determined to give them one shot before he was quartered and turning round discharged his piece at the first horseman who cried out "The rascal has broke my leg" when both of them turned their horses round and went off leaving Mayhew at liberty to tread back his path to the road and come off  thA body of the enemy's horse said to be about and the th British regiment came over from LongIsland to WestChester on the ice The troops in NewYork about this time drew four days' provisions which they were directed to keep cooked and the troops to be in readiness to move on the shortest notice with arms and blankets only A number of sleighs were collected and some heavy cannon were drawn out whether an attempt on Morristown or the Highlands was the object was not known Several deserters came in from the enemy and in this month there were some desertions from the American southern regiments to the enemy The enemy also made an excursion in the Jersies as far as ElizabethTown and carried off a great quantity of plunder  thSome small parties of the enemy were out towards the White Plains  Our General having obtained leave from the Commander in Chief to make a visit to his friends in NewEngland commenced his journey eastward on the st of February and reached his house in Roxbury on the th It appeared that the winter had been as severe and the snow as deep in the NewEngland States as in the Highlands of NewYork  March  thOur General addressed the Hon Council of Massachusetts on the importance of the then moment for recruiting their battalions  By the master of a flag from Bermuda information was received that the fleet in passing from NewYork to the southward the preceding December suffered considerably and that an ordnance ship was lost  thA privateer ship of guns prize to the Tartar privateer was sent into Boston  thThe Committee of the General Court of Massachusetts were issuing notes for the depreciation of the pay of the troops of their line these were sold at a very great discount  thA rich Jamaica ship prize to the continental frigate Dean arrived safe in Boston harbour The same day there was a report that Sir Henry Clinton had arrived at SouthCarolina with the British troops which sailed from NewYork in December  The Legislature of Massachusetts passed a resolution granting a premium of £ per man for each recruit that should be enlisted and pass muster for their line  thA Marblehead privateer the Aurora sent in a prize ship with barrels of flour do of beef and pork and dry goods to the amount of £ sterling  April  stNews was received of a most obstinate engagement in Europe between the French frigate Sueveillant Capt Conedic of guns and the British frigate Quebec Capt Farmer of the same force The French frigate had men killed and wounded The Quebec blew up and her whole crew except were lost either in action or in the explosion This engagement did honour to the bravery of both nations  The depreciation of the continental money rapidly increased many people withheld their merchandize and produce from sale and the times were truly embarrassing An embarkation of some thousands of Hessian troops took place at NewYork for Carolina In the course of this month the Maryland line of the army and three companies of artillery marched to the southward  thNews was received that the British had got their shipping over the bar at Charleston that the continental frigates in the harbour were hauled up and their guns taken out and mounted on batteries the garrison of Charleston numerous  thThe privateers Franklin and Jack sent into Salem a large letterofmarque ship having on board barrels of pork and beef barrels of flour firkins of butter and dry goods to the amount of £ she was from London bound to NewYork  During this month the enemy made two excursions to Paramus where they killed and took a number of Americans Maj Byles of the Pennsylvania line was mortally wounded and died the next day The enemy burnt Mr G Hoper's houses and mills the militia turned out spiritedly repulsed and pursued the enemy By accounts from Europe the American cause was viewed in a very favourable light by the Courts in that part of the world  thThe French frigate Hermeoue Capt Latouch arrived at Boston in whom came the Marquis de la Fayette and suite from France The inhabitants of Boston exhibited the greatest demonstrations of joy on the occasion The next morning the Marquis Capt Latouch and other officers made a visit to our General the Marquis the day before on his landing at Hancock's Wharf was received by a number of Continental officers and escorted to his  lodgings after which he paid his respects to the Honorable Legislature who were then in session in the evening there were rejoicings  May  dThe Marquis de la Fayette set out from Boston for the army  During the session of the Legislature of Massachusetts they received an order from Congress in favour of the State for dollars to reimburse the State in part of the expense of the Penobscot expedition which had greatly involved the State The enemy having taken post at Penobscot the Legislature of Massachusetts without applying to Congress determined to dislodge them and for this purpose ordered a body of militia to be detached under the command of Brig Gen Lovell and in addition to their own State vessels procured a number of privateers belonging to individuals The expedition was attempted the shipping arrived safe in Penobscot Bay the troops or a part of them were debarked to attack the enemy but they did not succeed in their attempt The armed vessels instead of cruizing off the harbour where they could have had sea room remained in the bay The enemy sent a naval force to the relief of the post which arrived and found the American shipping in the river who immediately ran up as far as they could where the whole were destroyed and the militia and seamen left to find their way home through the woods This was an unfortunate affair to Massachusetts whose privateers before were numerous able and active and greatly annoyed the enemy and had it not been for this blow would have been of great public benefit by depriving the enemy of many of their provision vessels and of increasing provisions in our own country Congress at first seemed to decline bearing the expense as they had never been  consulted respecting the expedition but they finally consented to a reimbursement  Congress ordered that men in the pay of the United States should cover and protect the Eastern Country the ensuing summer  thThe gentlemen of Boston gave a ball to the French and American officers  thThe Hermeone frigate Capt Latouch sailed from Boston harbour on a cruize  A number of very valuable prizes taken by the American cruizers were sent into different ports  The th exhibited a most extraordinary phenomenon The wind in the morning was southerly a moderate breeze the sun shone a little after it was up but was soon clouded there was some thunder and moderate showers A little after o'clock the clouds exhibited a yellowish cast and every object seemed to present a brassy hue it soon after began to grow dark which gradually increased between eleven and twelve it became necessary to light candles to do household business The darkness increased until near one o'clock P M the inhabitants dining by candlelight About one the darkness began to decrease and went off gradually as it came on between three and four P M the usual light was restored The evening although the moon was at the full was remarkably dark and there was a sprinkling of rainthe people were in great consternation This phenomenon in the opinion of our General although he has no pretensions to astronomy was produced by  opposite winds  forcing together a vast body of smoak and vapours the air had been smoaky for some days before which from the light state of the atmosphere as they accumulated ascended forming from top to bottom such a body as to cause the darkness and yet so open were the particles as to admit the sun's rays so far  as to cause the brassy appearance had the atmosphere been heavy the vapours would probably have condensed and rain in torrents would have ensued Some observations made by our General some years since the foregoing on the darkness in Canada and which on the afternoon of the preceding day he noticed at Roxbury and remarked thereon afford strong collateral evidence that the foregoing opinion was not wholly unfounded  As the learned and curious wish to ascertain as far as possible the true cause of the phenomenon we throw in those rough materials which our observation at the time collected that they may be shaped by those of greater skill for the information and satisfaction of an enlightened public Those called the dark days in Canada were the th th and th of October but the greatest degree of darkness was on Sunday the th when the darkness was so great as to render the use of candles necessary in the churches and families it is said to have been as dark as a dark night  On the th at Roxbury in Massachusetts the wind was at southeast and then at southwest the day fair cool and pleasant  The th the prevailing wind was easterly the day was cloudy and foggy about o'clock P M it was uncommonly dark and there was an opposite wind from the southwest There were several hard claps of thunder at a distance and a few drops of rain Towards evening the sun was visible but appeared very red and the clouds exhibited a brassy complexion so similar to the dark day in May as to be noticed and compared in the evening the wind was southerly  The th which was the dark day in Canada the wind there at opposite points N E and S W was at Roxbury S W The day was fair warm and  pleasant from which it seems to be obvious that the body of smoak and vapour with which the atmosphere was fraught on the th which pervaded a region which comprehended Canada and a part of NewEngland at least was by the strength of the southwest wind in the night forced northward and being still opposed by the northeast wind pressing on the other side produced the accumulation of smoak and vapour which occasioned the darkness and if the northeast wind had prevailed against the southwest the darkness would probably have been in NewEngland  stCapt Latouch returned from his cruize he ran into Penobscot Bay and cast anchor firing several signal guns Two British sloops of war which were at anchor upon the approach of the Hermeone came to sail and ran up the river Capt Latouch lay at anchor until he took a plan of the enemy's post Our General intended to have commenced his journey for the army on Monday the th of May but on the afternoon of the preceding day he received a letter from Gen Washington dated the th in which his Excellency observed "I have the pleasure to inform you in strict confidence that we have authentic advices of his most Christian Majesty's determination to send a respectable armament of sea and land forces to operate on the continent and that the period is not remote when we may expect their arrival" The Commander in Chief added that the seizing of Halifax was an object with the French and our General was instructed to obtain as soon as possible the exact state of the British in that quarter as to their  works garrisons  and  troops  all of which was shortly after ascertained  thThe Hermeone fell down in order to proceed on a cruize to the southward The troops  at WestPoint at this time were very short of provisions and without rum  Congress and the Commander in Chief called upon the several States to complete their battalions of the army with all possible dispatch The enemy at NewYork were under great apprehensions of a visit from the French and were said to have prepared a number of hulks of different sizes to sink in the channel  June  thNews was received that a French fleet had been seen at sea in latitude standing E N E  About this time Capt Latouch sent into Dartmouth a prize brig having firkins of butter boxes of candles and boxes of soap on board The Legislature of Massachusetts ordered a draft to be made from the militia to complete their Continental battalions The drafts were to rendezvous at Springfield  thOur General received the following letter from the Commander in Chief  HEADQUARTERS MORRISTOWN  June    DEAR SIR  IT is expected that the fleet of our ally will in the first instance touch at RhodeIsland for the purpose of landing their sick and supernumerary stores and to meet the intelligence necessary to direct their operations I have already sent forward Doctor Craik to take up proper houses for hospitals and to make some previous arrangements in that department but I apprehend the French General and Admiral will upon their arrival want the advice and assistance of a person of discretion and judgment and acquainted with the country I must request you to repair immediately to Providence and upon their  arrival present yourself to them letting them know that they may command your services  I would wish you to endeavour in conjunction with the Governor to establish a market between the fleet and army and country and be careful that our allies are not imposed upon in the prices of articles which they may find necessary This is a point recommended in the plan drawn up by the Ministry of France and which policy and generosity directs should be strictly attended to  Signed G WASHINGTON  Gen HEATH  About this time an engagement happened between the Hermeone and a British manofwar which lasted near two glasses it

General set out from his house in Roxbury for Providence where he arrived the next day at o'clock P M was met at Patucket Bridge by DeputyGovernor Bowen and a number of other gentlemen who attended him into town  On Friday the d of June the Continental frigate the Trumbull James Nicholson commander had an engagement with a British frigate of guns which lasted five hours The Trumbull had all her masts wounded men killed and wounded The British frigate was supposed to have suffered much  In this month a body of the enemy under the command of Gen Knyphausen landed in the Jersies and moved towards Springfield Some skirmishing ensued Col Angel's regiment suffered considerably  A number of men were killed on both sides It was now fully confirmed that the enemy's shipping passed Fort Moultrie on Sullivan's Island in SouthCarolina on the th of April with a fresh breeze by which means they received but little damage they came to anchor between Fort Johnson and Charleston and just out of reach of the latter Gen Sir Henry Clinton had now advanced his approaches so far as to be erecting his batteries The garrison made a good defence but on the th of May were obliged to surrender

of the enemy the former being pieces from to pounders the Continental frigates Providence Boston Ranger and Queen of France with State gallies and one French ship of war were lost It was supposed that about American men women and children were killed during  the siege The enemy's loss in killed and wounded was considerable The enemy broke ground before the town on the first of April at the distance of yards from the American works Before the surrender of the place it was contemplated in Council of War to embark the garrison except about one regiment on board the shipping in the night and run up the river and land them thereby to save the army leaving those in the town to make the best terms they could This opinion for some time prevailed but it was afterwards given up  thThe British fleet left Charleston said to consist of ships of the line fifties fortygunships or frigates and between and transports near negroes were put on board the fleet Lord Cornwallis with about men marched from Charleston towards NorthCarolina A few days after the surrender of Charleston to the British troops the grand arsenal wherein was deposited all the arms c taken from the Americans took fire and blew up by which it was said a number of men were killed and wounded The loss of Charleston roused the country and seemed to give a check to that spirit of avarice and speculation which had but too much prevailed in all places and a determination by every exertion to drive the enemy from the country appeared to be catching from breast to breast  At RhodeIsland every preparation was making for the reception of the French fleet and army The handsome college at Providence was given up for a hospital The American privateers had been very successful and many valuable prizes were sent in  thMonsieur Corney a French Commissary arrived at Providence About this time it was suspected that the enemy at NewYork had some intentions  of an attempt on our posts in the Highlands and some of their shipping

thAt one o'clock A M our General received advice by express that the fleet of our illustrious ally was seen off Newport the evening before Before sunrise an express was sent forward to Gen Washington with the agreeable tidings and our General immediately prepared to proceed to Newport but the day being calm the packet did not reach the town until o'clock at night General Rochambeau had gone on shore in the evening Early the next morning our General went on shore and waited on the Count from which moment the warmest  friendship commenced between our General the Count and all the French officers After breakfast our General went on board the Duke de Burgoyne manofwar to pay his respects to the Chevalier de  Ternay  who commanded the squadron where the same friendship was commenced The

great At o'clock A M the Admiral saluted the town with cannon which was returned by the discharge of the same number In the evening the town was beautifully illuminated and fireworks exhibited to the great pleasure and satisfaction of our allies The fleet on its passage to America fell in with five British ships of the line who after firing a few broadsides bore away  thOur General dined with the

supposed to be ships of the line At sunset they appeared to be coming too under BlockIsland The frigates which attempted to get out in the morning returned at evening  Apprehending that the British fleet might be cruizing off with a view to intercept the second division of the French fleet which was expected soon to arrive our General sent off expresses to headquarters Boston and Hartford advising of the British fleet being off Newportthat dispatchboats might be sent out to apprize the French and point them to another port Several works and batteries next to the harbour were mantled with cannon  dThe British fleet were cruizing off all the day and rather nearer than they were the preceding day Eighteen or nineteen sail were counted eight or nine of which appeared to be of the line The French squadron kept their former station in the harbour and in the most perfect readiness for action The army was in the same preparedness and batteries so constructed as to afford a heavy crossfire with the shipping in the entrance of the harbour  All vessels and boats were forbid passing out of the harbour in the night  dThe British were cruizing offearly in the morning one of their frigates was near in Col Greene's regiment of continental troops took post at Butt's Hill Bristol and Howland's Ferries Fifty French soldiers from the army were sent on board each of the ships of the line By accounts from WestPoint it appeared that many recruits had joined and were joining the American army  thThe British fleet continued off Newport In the afternoon sail were at anchor to the east of BlockIsland and frigates cruizing between that Island and Point Judith In the evening the Marquis de la Fayette came to town from headquarters  thIntelligence was received that Sir Henry Clinton intended an attempt upon the French army with men upon which of the militia of RhodeIsland and Brigadier Godfrey's brigade of militia of the county of Bristol in Massachusetts were called in to Tiverton and the three months' men who were destined to the main army such of them as belonged to the counties of Suffolk Essex Plymouth Worcester Barnstable and Bristol were ordered to march to RhodeIsland  thA confirmation of the intention of Sir Henry Clinton against Newport was received from the neighbourhood of NewYork In consequence of which the whole militia of the State of RhodeIsland was called in Col Tyler's Col Perry's and Maj Bullard's militia regiments in addition to Brigadier Godfrey's from Massachusetts Signals were fixed as far as WatchHill and every thing put in train for the giving instant notice both by day and night in case the enemy should approach towards the place  thThe wind being fresh at southwest and the air hazy the privateer ship Washington Capt Munroe ran by the British fleet and passed up the harbour The stock on ConanicutIsland was ordered to be taken off Howland's Ferry was to be well secured on both sides  thIntelligence was received that the enemy's shipping which were in the Sound and supposed to have taken in troops at Whitestone had come to sail and stood to the westward on which the militia who were coming in except the three months' men were permitted to return home The militia had discovered great zeal and alertness on the occasion About noon the British ships that had been at anchor off BlockIsland came to sail and stood out to sea  The same day a brig with dispatches from France passed up the harbour she ran on one of the wrecks and sunk immediately  stOur General received letters from Gen Washington Gen Howe Gen Parsons and Gov Trumbull intimating that the enemy intended an attack on Newport that about sail of vessels were in the Sound that about troops were to be employed on the expedition and that Gen Sir Henry Clinton was to command in person that heavy cannon some mortars c were put on board In consequence of this intelligence the militia were again called in The next day August st our General received the following letter from Gen Washington  ROBINSON'S HOUSE  July    DEAR SIR  I ARRIVED here last night having met your favours of the th and th at Paramus where the army then lay Immediately upon hearing that the  transports with the troops which had been some days on board had sailed eastward I put the army in motion again they will cross the ferry to day and will be joined by the troops from hence I propose moving as rapidly as possible down towards Kingsbridge which will either oblige the enemy to abandon their project against RhodeIsland or may afford us an opportunity of striking them to advantage in this quarter if Sir Henry Clinton has carried with him the number of men reported eight thousand and with less than which I think he would scarcely risk an attempt upon Count Rochambeau reinforced by the militia  I entirely approve of the measures you have taken for calling in aid and have the strongest hopes that if Sir Henry should venture upon an attack that he will meet a reception very different from what he expects You know the critical situation in which this army will be in a position below and how much depends upon constant intelligence of the motions of the enemy I shall direct relays of expresses the whole way between this army and you to convey intelligence in the most expeditious manner The nearest express to you will be upon TowerHill and Gen Greene advises that you should keep two whaleboats to communicate with him by SouthFerry so long as that passage shall be safe and if that should be interrupted by Bissell's Harbour  Signed GEO WASHINGTON  PS I wish the Count de Rochambeau had taken a position on the main  G W  The militia came in with great spirit they were formed into brigades and every disposition made for instant and vigorous defence at every point where it was supposed an attempt might be made  The batteries were strengthened a very strong one erected on RoseIsland and redoubts on Coaster'sIsland the strong works on Butt'sHill pushed avenues across the fields by the shortest routes were opened from the encampment of the French army to those points where their instant presence was judged necessary and such marks fixed at small distances from each other as to prevent any mistake in the route either by day or night indeed no one precaution was omitted or probable advantage of ground or situation neglected Had Sir Henry made the attempt which he menaced he would undoubtedly have met a warm reception but for some reason or other he gave up his design and the militia were again sent home Perhaps on no occasion did the militia discover more ardour in pressing to the field or more regularity when there than at that time which was every where testified by the inhabitants  Our General had expressed a wish to the Commander in Chief to join the main army that he might enjoy that command to which he was at that time entitled viz the right wing to which Gen Washington in a letter dated August d replied  As to your coming on to the army immediately I shall leave it entirely to yourself to act in the affair as you please Your command is and will always be ready for you however if you find your presence where you are necessary and that it will contribute to the accommodation of our allies and to the cultivation of harmony matters about which I am very anxious it may possibly be more eligible for you to remain longer as we shall not probably have any instant active operations But as I have already said do in the matter as you like and as circumstances may decide  And in a subsequent letter some days after he observed "As to your wishes to join the army as I observed before your aid may be very material to the Count and as we have no prospect of immediate active operations I would rather wish you to remain with him longer I thought it essential in the first instance that there should be an officer of rank sent to him and a variety of reasons concurred to induce me to believe that you would answer the important objects I had in view as well at least as any I could choose I have not been disappointed in the least in my expectation and the Count himself judges your continuing very essential and expressed himself in the following manner upon the subject several days ago  "I shall keep with me if you think proper Gen Heath whose ardour spirit and activity are absolutely necessary to me"  For these several considerations I wish you to reconcile yourself to remaining with him a while which will be the more easy when you consider that you will be fully advertised whenever we are in a situation to attempt any thing offensive on a great scale and will have your command"  The British ship of war the Galetea appeared off Dartmouth The British fleet went to Gardner's Bay excepting

dance before the officers of the armies to the great satisfaction of those of the French who had not seen the like before The next day the French troops were under arms manoeuvred and fired in presence of the Indians who were much pleased  stInformation was received that Admiral Arbuthnot was near the Vineyard with nine sail of the line eight other ships of war of different force and two tenders that he had made a demand of lb of beef and mutton to be delivered every other day at five pence per lb The inhabitants remonstrating against furnishing so large a quantity the Admiral assured them that in case they voluntarily delivered as much as their ability would allow he would dispense with what might be wanting  The enemy continued their preparations for some grand enterprise which could not be developed  September  thThe British fleet were returned again to Gardner's Bay and their old station between LongIsland and Block Island  thIntelligence was received that on the th ult

from the WestIndies but brought no news of consequence The Count de Guichen instead of coming this way with the fleet from the WestIndies was going or gone for Europe  While General Washington was in interview with General Rochambeau at Hartford Maj Gen Arnold who had the immediate command of WestPoint was playing a most traiterous game with the British for the delivery of that important post into their handswhich was communicated to our General by the Commander in Chief in the following letter  ROBINSON'S HOUSE  Sept    DEAR SIR  IN the present situation of things I think it necessary that you should join the army and request that  you will do it You will come to headquarters yourself The route through Litchfield will be the most eligible for you on account of security and you may direct your baggage to halt at FishKill for your further orders I write to the Count de Rochambeau by this conveyance and I trust that your coming away now will not be attended with any material inconvenience to him  I cannot conclude without informing you of an event which has happened here which will strike you with astonishment and indignationMaj Gen Arnold has gone to the enemy He had had an interview with Major Andre AdjutantGeneral of the British army and had put into his possession a state of the army of the garrison at this post of the number of men considered as necessary for the defence of it a return of the ordnance and the disposition of the artillery corps in case of an alarm By a most providential interposition Major Andre was taken in returning to NewYork with all these papers in Gen Arnold's handwriting who hearing of the matter kept it to himself left his quarters immediately under pretext of going over to West Point on Monday forenoon about an hour before my arrival then pushed down the river in the barge which was not discovered till I had returned from WestPoint in the afternoon and when I received the first information of Mr Andre's capture Measures were instantly taken to apprehend him but before the officers sent for the purpose could reach Verplank's Point he had passed it with a flag and got on board the Vulture ship of war which lay a few miles below He knew of my approach and that I was visiting with the Marquis the north and middle redoubts and from this circumstance was so straitened in point of time that I believe he carried with him but very few if any material papers  though he has a very precise knowledge of the  of the post The gentlemen of Gen Arnold's  I have the greatest reason to believe were not privy in the least degree to the measure he was carrying on or to his escape  Signed G WASHINGTON  Gen Arnold's panic was so great when he found that the plot was discovered that he called out for a  horse  any horse that first came to hand if it were a waggonhorse upon the horse's being brought the General mounted and instead of passing to the landing by the usual path he rode down a steep bank where it seemed impossible for a horse with a rider to get down without being unhorsed  When Arnold had passed Verplank's Point and had got under the guns of the Vulture he told Corporal Larvey who was Cockswain of the barge that he was going on board the ship and that he should not return that if he Larvey would stay with him he should have a commission in the British service To this Larvey who was a smart fellow replied that he would be dd if he fought on both sides the General replied that he would send him on shore Arnold then told the barge crew that if any or all of them would stay with him they should be treated well but if they declined staying they should be sent on shore One or two staid the rest with the Cockswain were sent on shore in the ship's boat the barge was kept Larvey for his fidelity was made a Serjeant He thought he had merited more that he ought to have had as much as Arnold promised him He continued uneasy until at his repeated request he was allowed to leave the army  Maj Andre on his return towards NewYork fell in with three young men below the lines John Paulding David Williams and Isaac Van Vert they  did not at first know that Andre was a British officer and he was at a loss whether they were British refugees or staunch Americans There was consequently a little finesse exhibited on both sides but at length it was fully discovered who Andre was He then attempted to bribe the young men by offering them a large sum of money but their fidelity was too great to be purchased They brought him up and delivered him to the Americans where he was tried sentenced and hanged as a spy The British General on the river endeavoured to save his life first by threats and then by persuasions but all was in vain Maj Andre's behaviour until the time of his execution was becoming an officer and a gentleman and such in his last moments as drew tears from many eyes But it must be remembered that he who consents to become a spy when he sets out has by allusion a halter put round his neck and that by the usage of armies if he be taken the other end of the halter is speedily made fast to a gallows  Congress pleased with the conduct of John Paulding David Williams and Isaac Van Vert passed a resolution on the th of October directing that dollars in specie should be annually paid to them during life and that a silver medal descriptive of their fidelity with the thanks of Congress should be presented to each of them  The situation of the British army and other circumstances at the moment Andre was detected were such as render it highly probable that if he had not been taken the most serious consequences to the American cause would very soon have taken place  October  stThe next day after our General received the letter from Gen Washington he took a most affectionate leave of the French officers and  left Newport to prepare to go on to the army His waggonhorses were out in the country at a distance these were to be brought in shod c and other preparations to be made which prevented his leaving Providence until the afternoon of the th when he was attended out of town by a number of officers and other gentlemen Before he left Providence he bid Count Rochambeau another farewel by letter to which an answer was forwarded on after him as follows  NEWPORT  Oct    MY DEAR GENERAL  I HAVE received the letter that you honoured me with from Providence I am extremely sensible of the marks of friendship that you give me and likewise very grateful for all that your good heart has dictated to you upon the occasion of our present separation I regret vastly your absence my dear General as well as all the army and I shall never forget the zeal the activity and the intelligence with which you helped us in all our operations and the French army will always be most grateful for it I have the honour to be with the most inviolable attachment my dear General  your most obedient and humble servant Signed LE COUNT DE ROCHAMBEAU  thOur General reached WestPoint where he met the following letter from Gen Washington  HEADQUARTERS NEAR PASSAICK FALLS  Oct    DEAR SIR  IN my letter of the th ult by which I requested you to rejoin the army I desired that you would come yourself to headquarters I am now to request that you will proceed to WestPoint and take upon you the command of that post and its dependencies Maj Gen Greene who is at present  there will either communicate to you himself or leave with Gen M'Dougal to be transferred the instructions he received respecting the post to which you will be pleased to attend If this should not find you at WestPoint it is my wish that you should arrive there as soon as circumstances will possibly admit and I hope there will be nothing to delay it  Signed G WASHINGTON  Our General had scarcely entered on the command before he received intelligence that the enemy were making an incursion upon the northern frontier of NewYork upon which he immediately without consulting the Commander in Chief ordered Col Gansevoort's regiment to their relief and communicated what he had done to headquarters to which he received the following answer  HEADQUARTERS PREKANESS  th Oct    DEAR SIR  I AM favoured with your's of yesterday accompanied by a letter from his Excellency Governor Clinton who gives me an account of the incursion upon the frontiers I am happy that you detached Gansevoort's regiment immediately you will be pleased to order either Weisenfeld's or Willet's as you may judge proper to follow and take orders from the Governor or the commanding officer This is all the force I think we ought to detach from the posts until the views of the enemy are more fully ascertained They put off the long expected embarkation strangely They had not sailed the th and it was then said the expedition was delayed for some purpose The number under orders by estimate are about or something upwards If the militia should not have been discharged when this reaches you you will be pleased to detain about  to make up for the detachment you have sent up the river I have received your's of the th as I have done that inclosing the estimates for which I am much obliged You will be pleased to carry into execution what you proposed respecting the posts at Stoney and Verplank's Points  Signed G WASHINGTON  This was followed by another dated the th in which the Commander in Chief observed "I am glad to find by your letter of the th that you were arrived at WestPoint and had taken the command of that important post" This was occasioned by our General's having been on the east side of the river a day or two until the quarters on the point were quitted by Maj Gen Greene who was ordered to the southward  On the th intelligence was received that the enemy had advanced to Fort George and Fort Ann both of which had fallen into their hands that after destroying the works and burning about thirty houses and as many barns they had gone back but it was apprehended that they would advance again  thMaj Gen Greene left WestPoint The same day intelligence was received that on the th the long talked of embarkation of troops sailed from NewYork supposed to be destined to the southward The American troops at this time drove up the fat cattle which were near the lines in consequence of a warrant from Gov Clinton  stIntelligence was received that the enemy were meditating an excursion as far up as Crompond and its vicinity to sweep off all the cattle Our General immediately ordered Col Hazen with a detachment of men to move to Pine's Bridge and Lieut Col Jameson with the d light dragoons to move from Bedford towards Col Hazen The  detachment arrived at Pine's Bridge about o'clock the same evening and Col Jameson with the dragoons at about o'clock the next morning The evening of the d Col Hazen returned with the detachment the enemy did nor come out  About this time the enemy received a small reinforcement at NewYork from England said to be or Two or three very valuable prizes laden with rum sugar c were sent into Philadelphia and news was received that upwards of sail of British East and West Indiamen outward bound were taken by the combined fleets of France and Spain near Cape Finister  thIntelligence was received that the enemy had laid waste a great part of the fertile country above Saratoga and to the westward of Schenectady The same night prisoners made their escape from the provost at FishKill by digging upwards of feet under ground parties were sent out after them in different directions and some of them were retaken  thNews was received that the militia under Gen Van Rensselaer obtained a considerable advantage over the enemy at the northward on the th instant at the Fox Mills The action lasted for some hours the enemy left their baggage prisoners c Col Brown was killed in skirmishing with the enemy on the morning of the same day  thOfficial intelligence was received of a signal advantage gained by the Americans in NorthCarolina over a corps of fourteen hundred men British troops and new levies commanded by Col Ferguson The militia of the neighbouring country under Colonels Williams and Shelby and others having assembled to the number of detached men on horseback to fall in with Ferguson's party on its march to Charlottethey came up with  them at a place called King's Mountain advantageously posted and gave them a total defeat in which Col Ferguson with of his men were killed made prisoners and stands of arms taken with but inconsiderable loss except and greatly to be regretted the brave Col Williams who was supposed to be mortally wounded A second account stated the enemy's whole loss in killed wounded and prisoners at and that of the Americans in killed and wounded  thBrig Gen James Clinton was ordered to Albany to take the command in that quarter  thCapt Johnson with a detachment consisting of men marched to do duty on the lines for the protection of the inhabitants against the enemy and the cowboys so called a set of plundering thieves  stA ridiculous proclamation of the traitor Arnold made its appearance he styled himself a BrigadierGeneral and invited the officers and soldiers of the American army to join him promising ample encouragement c but it had no effect  November  stA severe storm of snow and rain The brave soldiers who were but illy clad and destitute of blankets were in a shivering condition  The devastation committed by the enemy at the northward was found to be very great at least dwellings and bushels of wheat with a proportion of other grain and forage were supposed to have been destroyed had not the pursuit after the enemy been very rapid the devastations would have been much greater  The American army were at this time experiencing a great want of flour which they bore with their usual patience  thIntelligence was received that Maj Carleton after being reinforced with men was returning towards Skeensborough it was supposed  that his force had increased to about and further depredations on the frontiers were expected The militia of the upper counties were again ordered out by Gov Clinton  The same day the new arrangement of the army was published The encouragement to both officers and soldiers was generous  thThe troops were again without bread Intelligence was received that the enemy had landed a body of troops at Portsmouth in Virginia and that another embarkation was talked of at NewYork  thNews was received from Boston that his Excellency John Hancock had been chosen Governor of the State of Massachusettsthe first Governor under the new constitution The same day intelligence was received from the northward that the enemy had crossed Lake George the Thursday before and advanced to Fort Edward the small garrison of which abandoned the fort on the approach of the enemy whose numbers were said to be about The militia were out and the st and th NewYork regiments were ordered to embark and sail for Albany immediately They sailed early on the morning of the th On the same day intelligence was received that the enemy had lately made an excursion to the upper parts of Connecticut river and destroyed a number of houses at Royalton The militia turned out with spirit repulsed and pursued them the enemy made off with precipitation leaving their plunder c behind them Upwards of militia were assembled in that quarter  The d regiment of dragoons moved from Bedford to NorthCastle  The enemy published several letters in the NewYork papers which were taken from the FishKill postrider not long before at Stratford in particular  one from the general officers belonging to the NewEngland States to their several Legislatures  A partial but not general exchange of prisoners took place about this time Maj Gen Lincoln was exchanged for Maj Gen Phillips General Thompson and a number of American officers who had long been prisoners were also exchanged  thThe great chain which was laid across the Hudson at WestPoint was taken up for the winter it was done under the direction of Colonel Govion Capt Buchanan and Capt Nevers with a strong detachment of the garrison and with skill and dexterity This chain was as long as the width of the river between WestPoint and Constitution Island where it was fixed to great blocks on each side and under the fire of batteries on both sides of the river The links of this chain were probably inches wide and inches long the iron about inches square This heavy chain was buoyed up by very large logs of perhaps or more feet long a little pointed at the ends to lessen their opposition to the force of the water on flood and ebb The logs were placed at short distances from each other the chain carried over them and made fast to each by staples to prevent their shifting and there were a number of anchors dropped at distances with cables made fast to the chain to give it a greater stability The short bend of the river at this place was much in favour of the chain's proving effectual for a vessel coming up the river with the fairest wind and strongest way must lose them on changing her course to turn the point and before she could get under any considerable way again even if the wind was fair she would be on the chain and at the same time under a heavy shower of shot and shells  thThe st and th NewYork regiments

Massachusetts and Connecticut lines and a detachment of able bodied men the whole about arrived at WestPoint from the main army  thThree light fieldpieces with four ammunition tumbrels with ammunition

between Nelson's Point and the church Just before they marched Chevalier Chastellux Major General in the French army at Newport and some other French officers arrived the detachment defiled before them and proceeded for the lines The French officers were much pleased with the appearance of the troops  Gen Chastellux then accompanied our General over to the Point and on landing was saluted by the  discharge of cannon after dinner he took a view of Forts Clinton Putnam Willis c At evening Count Noailles Count Damas and Maj Duplissis arrived at the Point The next morning about o'clock Gen Chastellux and the other French officers amidst a severe cold storm of rain embarked on board the barge and went down the river to King's Ferry on their way to headquarters on leaving WestPoint they were again saluted by cannon  The evening of the d Brig Gen Starks arrived at Wright's Mills and the waggons were collected at NorthCastle This grand forage was to mask an enterprize which was to have been attempted by Gen Washington from the main army although the foraging was in itself an important object The enterprize for some reasons was not attempted but the grand forage was very successful Some of the light troops went as low down as EastChester and on the th Gen Starks returned with a large quantity of corn some hay cattle c  The next day the main army separated to move into winterquarters and the lightinfantry corps was broken up for the winter and the men ordered to join their respective regiments The corps of lightinfanty was perhaps as fine a body of men as was ever formed MajorGeneral the Marquis de la Fayette had with infinite pains and great expense endeavoured to render them respectable in their appearance as well as discipline in which he was nobly seconded by the officers it was a pity that the operations of the campaign did not afford an opportunity for the Marquis to signalize himself with this corps  thThe NewJersey brigade left WestPoint proceeding down on the west side of the Hudson on their way to Pompton where they took winterquarters  In the afternoon the four Massachusetts brigades arrived at WestPoint and the two Connecticut brigades on

their arrearages of pay and depreciation and exempting them from serving in the British army if they should choose it The mutineers nobly disdained these offers and gave up the emissaries and their papers they were tried and hanged as spies the one was an inhabitant of NewJersey the other was a British Serjeant Gen Sir Henry Clinton and Gen Knyphausen were said to have been on Staten Island The

RhodeIsland taking the lower road through Connecticut Many of the soldiers who had gone through the smallpox joined their regiments the next day of who had been inoculated four only had then died At this time provisions were growing very scarce at WestPoint and the prospects daily growing more alarming The magazines in Forts Clinton Putnam and some other of the most important works had reserves of the best provisions which were not to be touched that in case the enemy by any sudden movement should invest them and cut off the communication with the country the garrisons might be enabled to hold out until other troops or the militia of the country could march to the relief of the besieged but unfortunately the scarcity of provisions had become so great that even these reserves were broken in upon and some of them nearly exhausted when after some other representations our General addressed the following letter to Gen Washington  WESTPOINT  May    DEAR GENERAL  I AM honoured with your's of the th and th to which I shall duly attend  I hoped I should not have been compelled again to represent our situation on account of provisions but supplies of meat have not arrivedall the Irish beef in the store has been gone for some dayswe are at last forced in upon the reserves that in Fort Clinton has all been taken out this daythe pork which was ordered to be reserved is all issued except about barrelsthe boats are now up from below for provisions with representations that they are out the reserves will be gone in a few days if relief does not arrive and hunger must inevitably disperse the troops If the authority of our country will not order on supplies I will struggle to the last moment to maintain the post but regard to my own character compels me to be thus explicitthat if any ill consequences happen to this post or its dependencies through want of provisions I shall not hold myself accountable for them  I have the honour to be c Signed W HEATH  His Excellency Gen WASHINGTON  To which the Commander in Chief wrote the following answer  HEADQUARTERS NEWWINDSOR  May th    DEAR SIR  DISTRESSED beyond expression at the present situation and future prospects of the army with regard to provisions and convinced with you that unless an immediate and regular supply can be obtained the most dangerous consequences are to be apprehendedI have determined to make one great  effort more on the subject and must request that you will second and enforce my representations to and requisitions upon the NewEngland States by your personal application to the several Executives and even Assemblies if sitting as I suppose they will be in the course of this month  From your intimate knowledge of our embarrassed and distressed circumstances and great personal influence with the eastern States I am induced to commit the execution of this interesting and important business to you and wish you to set out on this mission as early as may be convenient  Signed GEO WASHINGTON  Maj Gen HEATH  On the next day our General received the following letter of instructions from the Commander in Chief viz  HEADQUARTERS NEWWINDSOR  May th    DEAR SIR  YOU will be pleased to proceed immediately to the several eastern States with the dispatches addressed to the Governors of Connecticut RhodeIsland Massachusetts Bay and the President of NewHampshire on the subject of supplies for the army The present critical and alarming situation of our troops and garrisons for the want of provisions is from the nature of your command so perfectly known to you and your personal influence with the NewEngland States is so considerable that I could not hesitate to commit to you a  negociation  on the success of which the very existence of the army depends  The great objects of your attention and mission are stAn immediate supply of beef cattle dThe transportation of all the salted provisions in the  western parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts and dThe establishment of a  regular systematic effectual plan  for feeding the army through the campaign Unless the two former are effected the garrison of Fort Schuyler must inevitably that of WestPoint may probably  fall  and the whole army be disbanded without the latter the same perplexing wants irregularities and distress which we have so often experienced will incessantly occur with eventual far greater evils if not final ruin  With regard to the particular mode of obtaining and transporting supplies I will not presume to dictate but something must now be attempted on the spur of the occasion I would suggest whether it would not be expedient for a Committee from the several States consisting of a few active sensible men to meet at some convenient place in order to make out upon a uniform and great scale all the arrangements respecting supplies and transportation for the campaign In the mean time to avoid the impending dissolution of the army the States must individually comply precisely with the requisitions of the QuarterMaster and Commissary upon them  As the salted provisions which have been put up for the public in the eastern States except in the western parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts cannot at present be transported to the army you will obtain  accurate official returns  of the quantity that has been procured in the respective States at what places and in whose charge it actually is and if it should not all be collected and lodged in the deposits that have been pointed out you will urge this immediately to be done and that the provisions should be repacked stored and taken care of in such a manner as to prevent the hazard of its being tainted or lost by the approaching hot season  I omit entering into the detail of particulars which it may be necessary to state to the respective Executives or Legislatures if in sitting to enforce the present requisition because you are as well acquainted with the circumstances of our distress the prospects before us and the only resources from whence we can derive relief as it is possible for you to be Previous to your departure you will obtain from the QuarterMasterGeneral and Commissary with the army the proper estimates of supplies and transportation to be required of the several States together with all the light and information concerning their department which may be requisite to transact the business committed to you  After having delivered the dispatches with which you are charged and made such further representations as you may judge necessary you will not cease your applications and importunities until you are informed officially whether effectual measuares are or will be taken to prevent the army from starving and disbanding What supplies in general and particularly of  beef cattle  may certainly be depended upon to be delivered at fixed regular periods monthly or weekly at the army during the whole campaign When you shall have seen this business put upon the surest footing and in the best train of execution which you will endeavour to have effected as early as possible you will be pleased to report to me without delay the success of your proceedings  I heartily wish you success and a pleasant journey and am c  Signed G WASHINGTON  PS I wish attention may be paid to learn what quantity of rum is in store at what places and in what manner it may be forwarded In transportation the arrangements should be made with the  States so as to have the articles brought entirely through to the army without having them stopped on the road You will also be pleased to urge the forwarding the summer cloathing  G W  Maj Gen HEATH  During the month of April a large number of recruits from the eastern States to fill up their respective battalions arrived at WestPoint  thThe Commander in Chief visited WestPoint  thIn the morning our General left WestPoint and proceeded up the river to NewWindsor where he received from the Commander in Chief the dispatches addressed to the several Executives of the NewEngland States and in the afternoon crossed the Hudson on his journey eastward On his reaching Fishkill he found that Governor Clinton of NewYork was making every exertion in his power for the relief of the armythat he had issued impress warrants to take flour and other provisions where they could be found c  thHe arrived at Hartford where he found the Legislature in session The dispatches to Governor Trumbull were immediately presented to him with an earnest request for speedy relief This venerable patriot gave assurance of his immediate attention and exertions and accordingly laid the dispatches from Gen Washington before the Legislature who also discovered the same noble patriotism They inquired into the state of their treasury and finding it was destitute of money except a sum appropriated to another purpose they ordered this money to be taken and directed Col Champion one of their number a gentleman remarkable for his knowledge in the state of provisions in all the towns skill in purchasing and expedition in forwarding  immediately to purchase and forward on to the army head of beef cattle and barrels of salted provisions from their stores and resolved to make every other exertion in their power to comply with the requisitions of the Commander in Chief as they respected both fresh and salted provisions by appointing a Committee for a general arrangement of supplies  thOur General left Hartford and on the th reached Greenwich in the State of RhodeIsland where he waited upon Gov Greene and presented the dispatches from Gen Washington The Legislature of the State were not then in session but Gov Greene made the most satisfactory assurances that the State of RhodeIsland would adopt every measure recommended by the Commander in Chief Our General left Greenwich the same day and arrived at his house in Roxbury on the evening of the th and the next day waited upon Gov Hancock at Boston and presented the dispatches with which he was charged The new Legislature of Massachusetts were to convene on the last Wednesday of the month Gov Hancock gave the fullest assurances that in the interim the Executive would do every thing in its power for the immediate relief of the army by directing the several contractors of provisions in the State to forward all in their power with the utmost expedition  stIntelligence was received at Boston that the State shipofwar the Protector of guns commanded by Capt Williams had been taken and carried into NewYork  The next day intelligence was received that on the th Col Greene of the RhodeIsland regiment who was doing duty on the lines of the American army was surprised by a body of the enemy's horse supposed to be about dragoons and that the  Colonel Maj Flagg two Subalterns and men were killed and several wounded Col Greene was a brave and intrepid officer and his loss was much regretted The Colonel had taken post above and near to Croten River at a place where the river was fordable to prevent the enemy passing up by this ford to ravage the country He had practised the greatest vigilance in guarding this ford in the night time taking off the guards after sunrise apprehending that the enemy would never presume to cross the river in the day time but the enemy having learnt his mode of doing duty on the morning of the th effected his overthrow by crossing the ford soon after the guards had come off and surrounding their quarters before they had an idea of any enemy being near them In this situation the utmost exertion could not then avail them  dOur General left Roxbury on his way to NewHampshire arrived at Exeter on the evening of the th and delivered to the Honorable Mr Weare the dispatches addressed to him The Legislature of NewHampshire was not then in session The next day he had an interview with the Honorable President and the Council of Safety when such representations in addition to the requisitions of the Commander in Chief were made to them as the exigencies of the case required and thè fullest assurances were received that every aid in the power of the State should be afforded  thOur General left Exeter on his return and on the th arrived at his house in Roxbury On the th he again waited on Gov Hancock and requested that the requisitions of the Commander in Chief of the army might be predominant in all the public objects  The th was the General Election day in Massachusetts and it appeared that his Excellency John  Hancock was reelected Governor who as soon as the two Houses were organized laid the requisitions of Gen Washington before them  June  dOur General was heard before a Committee of both Houses on the subject of his mission The zeal and patriotism of the several Executives and Legislatures of the NewEngland States to relieve and  ply supply the army with provisions were so conspicuous on this occasion that it is not possible to say which or whether any one of them exceeded the other each was for making every exertion in its power and to ensure success to their resolutions they all fell in with the recommendation of the Commander in Chief and appointed Committees to meet in Convention to digest and systemize the business The Committees met accordingly at Providence in RhodeIsland and were so fortunate in their arrangements that the most ample supplies of meat were afterwards furnished for the main army and a surplus of head of beef cattle weekly sent on after Gen Washington towards Virginia until he ordered a discontinuance of that supply as will appear in the sequel While the NewEngland States were thus intent in supplying meat for the army the State of NewYork was equally assiduous in furnishing flour and forage  thIntelligence was received by a vessel from the WestIndies that the Count de Grasse with a French fleet of upwards of sail of the line had arrived in that quarter The same day there was a confirmation of this news and that the fleet with troops on board was seen coming this way  The same day intelligence was received that there had been an action at the southward between Gen Greene and the British army in that quarter Gen Greene having reconnoitred Cambden did not think it expedient to storm the enemy's works but  retired a little back with a view to draw the enemy out in this he succeeded and an action commenced The Maryland troops being attacked under some disadvantage an attempt was made to change their position this was unfortunately taken by Gen Greene's army for a retreat and the whole army retreated accordingly Gen Greene had men killed his retreat was about or miles and the troops were in high spirits It is always a dangerous manoeuvre to change a position in the face of an enemy but necessity sometimes requires it  Gen Phillips of the British army had died in Virginia of a fever  thThe Continental frigate Alliance arrived in Boston harbour from France The Alliance had taken

Washington had ordered the American troops from their several cantonments and that the whole had assembled and were encamped near Peek's Kill  Some of the enemy's cruizers from Penobscot were cruizing in the Bay where they took several vessels one within a league of the lighthouse  thIntelligence was received that there had been a skirmish between the Americans and British between White Plains and King's Bridge but no particulars were received  thOur General set out from his house in Roxbury for the army  thThe enemy's shipping which were up the North River ran down there was a brisk cannonade at Dobb's Ferry  stThe American field artillery which had for some days been on board vessels in the North River proceeded downwards to the nearest landing to the army  When the enemy's shipping passed Dobb's Ferry on the th a box of powder on board the Savage shipofwar took fire supposed by the bursting of a howitzer shell on which a number of the crew apprehending that the ship would blow up jumped overboard into the river An American who was a prisoner on board jumped overboard at the same time and swam on shore relating what had happened he also reported that the Savage was several times hulled by our shot and must have suffered considerable loss The late skirmish near King's Bridge was occasioned by the American army's moving down in order to give the French officers a view of the British outposts near the bridge A number of Americans were killed and wounded by long shot from the yaugers of the enemy who kept up a popping fire whenever they could reach our troops  thOur General arrived at the army which was encamped at Phillipsburgh in two lines the park of artillery in the centre of the second line Accounts had been received from the southward that the enemy had no footing in Georgia except Savannah nor in SouthCarolina except Charleston The position which the American army now occupied was between the lines the preceding campaigns consequently the roads and commons as well as the fields and pastures were covered with grass while the many deserted houses and ruined fences depicted the horrid devastations of war The French army under Gen Rochambeau was encamped at a small distance on the left of the Americans in one line  thA forage was made towards Phillips's  conducted by Col Scammel It was said that some of the British troops had returned from the southward to NewYork and that those in Virginia were collected at Portsmouth  August  On the night of the d about o'clock the British and American guardboats met in the river near Dobb's Ferry when a considerable firing ensued we had one man badly wounded who died soon after The damage sustained by the enemy was not known  thThe Commander in Chief attended by a number of the General Officers reconnoitred towards King's Bridge covered by strong detachments of cavalry and infantry Three ships and a galley lay in the river between Fort Washington and SpittenDevil Creek The enemy did not make any movements The morning of the th about o'clock the army was awakened by the firing of cannon at Dobb's Ferry it appeared that of the enemy's gunboats had come up as high as the ferry probably to endeavour to seize some vessels or boats on finding that they were discovered they fired four cannon but to no effect Four cannon were discharged at the boats from the battery on which they went down the river Two days before Delancy's corps ventured as far above King's Bridge as Phillips's  News was received that the great French Financier  Neckar  had resigned and that Monsieur Fleury had been appointed in his room  Capt Saltonstall formerly of the frigate Warren who was dismissed the service on account of his conduct in the Penobscot expedition about this time behaved most gallantly in a privateer on a cruize against the enemy  The American army at this time continued in the same position at Phillipsburgh The Connecticut  and RhodeIsland lines and regiments of the Massachusetts line composed the front line the NewHampshire line four regiments of Massachusetts Crane's and Lamb's regiments of artillery with the sappers and miners the second line the right wing commanded by Maj Gen Heath the left wing by Maj Gen Lord Sterling the advance of the American army on a height a little advanced of Dobb's Ferry under the command of Col Scammel and Sheldon's dragoons near Dobb's Ferry The French army in one line on the left of the Americans with their legion under the Duke de Lauzun at White Plains Gen Waterbury with the militia under his command towards NewRochelle The camps at this time swarmed with flies which were very troublesome  thRobert Morris  Esq  the American Financier and Richard Peters  Esq  one of the Members of the Board of War visited the army The same day the advance of the army took a position a little more to the northward and the dragoons were added to Col Scammel's command A fleet arrived at NewYork from England they brought over between and Hessian recruits  thCol Hazen's and Col Vanscaak's regiments joined the army A French frigate arrived about this time at RhodeIsland supposed to have brought news of the approach of the Count de Grasse A few nights before Gen Schuyler came very near being taken and carried off from his house in Albany  In the general orders of the th the army was directed to hold itself in the most perfect readiness to march on the shortest notice  thIt was whispered that the Count de Grasse with sail of the line besides frigates with a number of land forces on board might soon be expected  on our coast and these with the squadron under the command of the Chevalier de Barras would make a fleet of sail of the line a force probably superior to any the British could assemble in these seas  Under prospects so flattering the Commander in Chief determined to strike the enemy a capital blow in some quarter To strike at their very root in NewYork was a most disirable object but the situation of NewYork with LongIsland and StatenIsland and the adjacent country was such as would require a very large army to effect a complete investiture and give a proper security against the sallies of the enemy which from situation might be easily and frequently madethat such an army must be composed in a very considerable degree of militia to whom the continuing long in camp had often been found disagreeable and the French were not without apprehensions that if their fleet entered the harbour of NewYork and became warmly engaged with the British ships and batteries in the course of those manoeuvres which it might be necessary to make some of their heavy ships through the want of a competent knowledge of all parts of the bay might get aground or be damaged while all these inconveniences would be avoided in case Lord Cornwallis with the British army in Virginia were made the object and his capture would be almost certain while the American main army might be left in sufficient strength to act on the defensive against Sir Henry Clinton and effectually cover the important posts in the Highlands of NewYork  thGeneral Washington was pleased to communicate to our General in confidence his intentions at the same time intimating to him that he should give him the command of the main army during his absence The whole of the French army with the two regiments of NewJersey first regiment  of NewYork Col Hazen's regiment Col Olney's regiment of RhodeIsland Col Lamb's regiment of artillery and the light troops under the command of Col Scammel were detached for the expedition against Lord Cornwallis and the army under his command at YorkTown in Virginia  thSome of the corps began to move towards the serries The next day the Commander in Chief was pleased to honour our General with the following  To  General HEATH  SIR  YOU are to take command of all the troops remaining in this department consisting of the two regiments of NewHampshire ten of Massachusetts and five of Connecticut infantry the corps of invalids Sheldon's legion the d regiment of artillery together with all such State troops and militia as are retained in service of those which would have been under my own command  The security of WestPoint and the posts in the Highlands is to be considered as the first object of your attention in order to effect this you will make such dispositions as in your judgment the circumstances shall from time to time require taking care to have as large a supply of salted provisions as posfible constantly on hand to have the fortifications works and magazines repaired and perfected as far as may be to have the garrison at least in all cases kept up to its present strength to have the minutes plans and arrangements for the defence and support of this important post perfectly understood and vigorously executed in case of any attempt against it Ample magazines of  wood  and  forage  are to be laid in against the approaching winter the former should be cut on the margin of the river and transported to the  garrison by water the latter ought to be collected from the country below the lines in the greatest quantities possible and deposited in such places as you shall judge proper  The force now put under your orders it is presumed will be sufficient for all the purposes above mentioned as well as to yield a very considerable protection and cover to the country without hazarding the safety of the posts in the Highlands this is to be esteemed as it respects the friendly inhabitants and resources of the country and extremely interesting object but when compared with the former of a secondary nature The protection of the northern and western frontier of the State of NewYork as well as those parts of that and other States most contiguous and exposed to the ravages and depredations of the enemy will claim your attention but as the contingencies which are to be expected in the course of this campaign may be so various unforeseen and almost infinite that no particular line of conduct can be prescribed for themupon all such occasions you will be governed by your own prudence and discretion on which the fullest confidence is placed  Although your general rule of conduct will be to act on the defensive only yet it is not meant to prohibit you from striking a blow at the enemy's posts or detachments should a fair opportunity present itself The most eligible position for your army in my opinion will be above that is on the north side of the Croten as well for the purpose of supporting the garrison of West Point annoying the enemy and covering the country as for the security and repose of your own troops  Waterbury's brigade which may be posted towards the Sound Sheldon's corps the State troops of NewYork and other light parties may occasionally  be made use of to hold the enemy in check and carry on the petitguerre with them but I would recommend keeping your force as much collected and compact as the nature of the service will admit doing duty by corps instead of detachments whenever it is practicable and above all exerting yourself most strenuously and assiduously while the troops are in a camp of repose to make them perfect in their exercise and manoeuvres and to establish the most perfect system of discipline and duty The good of the service and emulation of corps will I am persuaded prompt the officers and men to devote their whole time and attention to the pleasing and honourable task of becoming masters of their profession The uncertainty which the present movement of the army will probably occasion with the enemy ought to be increased by every means in your power and the deception kept up as long as possible It will not be expedient to prevent the militia which were ordered from coming in until the arrival of the Count de Grasse or something definite and certain is known from the southward and even these circumstances may but of this you will be advised render it adviseable to keep the enemy at NewYork in checkprevent their detaching to reinforce their southern army or to harass the inhabitants on the seacoasts  The redoubt on the east side of Dobb's Ferry is to be dismantled and demolished the platforms to be taken up and transported up the river if it can be conveniently done The blockhouse on the other side to be maintained or evacuated and destroyed as you shall judge proper The waterguards and other precautions to prevent surprise you will be pleased to take into your consideration and regulate in such a manner as you shall judge most expedient You will be pleased to keep me regularly advised of  every important event which shall take place in your departments  Given under my hand at headquarters near Dobb's Ferry  this th day of August  Signed GEO WASHINGTON  P S By the act of Congress of the d of Oct a return is to be made to them annually on or before the first of September of the troops belong+ing to the several States that requisitions may be made for completing the same This you will please to have done by the troops under your command  The preservation of the boats is a matter of very great importance to which you will attend Let all the new boats and such others as are not absolutely necessary and alotted to the service of the garrison be hauled up and put under the care of a guard so that the person to whom they are committed shall be accountable for every boat  The abuses committed by people belonging to commissioned whaleboats on LongIsland ought to be inquired into and suppressed especially as Congress have ordered those commissions to be revoked  G W  thAbout noon his Excellency Gen Washington left the army setting his face towards his native State in full confidence to use his own words  "with a common blessing"  of capturing Lord Cornwallis and his army while our General was left to watch Sir Henry Clinton and guard against those attempts which it was probable he would make to succour Cornwallis direct or by making such other movements as might tend to induce Gen Washington to give up his object or to avail himself of some important posts in his absence Sir Henry Clinton was consequently on the rack to devise something  which should effect this purpose a stroke at the posts in the Highlands Connecticut NewJersey Albany and Philadelphia was contemplated Against all this had our General to guardLet impartiality judge and candour decide on his conduct  On the morning of the same day the French army marched from their encampment towards King's Ferry where they were to cross the river The American park of artillery Col Olney's regiment and the NewYork regiment decamped and moved the same way  thA little after noon our General ordered off the baggage to the strong grounds near Young's which at about o'clock was followed by the army marching by the left in one column which took a strong position during the night The pickets after dusk were drawn back a little to the northward of the former encampment The advanced parties under Maj Scott were ordered to join their respective regiments and Sheldon's horse to patrole in the front  stCol Putnam with infantry Col Sheldon's horse and two companies of the NewYork levies were ordered to form an advance for the army and remain at or near their present ground About o'clock at noon the army took up its line of march and halted at night on the lower parts of NorthCastle Two regiments had been detached on the march to SingSing church to cover a quantity of baggage belonging to the French army assist in removing it c and a detachment was sent to the New Bridge to secure a quantity of flour lodged near that place  dThe army marched from NorthCastle and encamped at CromPond all the French stores at Tarrytown and SingSing had been secured  dThe army marched from CromPond and took a strong position at Peek's Kill the first line encamping before the village and the second behind it After the troops were encamped waggons were sent off to assist in forwarding the stores of the army with Gen Washington Intelligence was received that a frigate and storeship had arrived at Boston from France with military stores c for the United States  thThe French troops had not all passed the Ferry Americans were sent to aid them and at evening more Intelligence was received that a large French fleet had been seen standing for the continent  thThe whole of the French army had crossed the river Gen Washington was as far as Ramapaugh in the forenoon Six deserters came in from the enemy and three prisoners of war belonging to Delancy's corps were sent up they had taken and were driving off about sheep which were recovered  thDispatches were sent off to Gov Trumbull at Hartford and Gov Hancock at Boston A heavy cannonade was heardtowards NewYork from early in the morning till two in the afternoon supposed to be off at sea  thAt evening a detachment consisting of men marched towards the New Bridge where waggons were collecting for a grand forage which was to be covered by this detachment and the troops on the linesthe whole under the command of Col Greaton By the last accounts Gen Washington was as far as Chatham in the Jersies  stColonel Laurens passed the army on his way from Boston to Philadelphia he had brought from France a large sum in specie for the United States Col Laurens reported the friendly disposition  of the European powers towards the United States that GreatBritain continued to stand without a single ally nor could she obtain one in the war in which she was engaged  September  stThe foragers returned with loads of hay A Hessian rifleman came in with his rifle  The same day letters were received from Gen Washington dated at Trenton the th ult mentioning that a British fleet of sail of the line had arrived at SandyHook from the WestIndies The same evening about Indians from the Oneida and other neighbouring tribes came to the army on their way after Generals Washington and Rochambeau  dIntelligence was received from NewYork that a fleet under the command of Admiral Sir Samuel Hood had arrived at SandyHook from the WestIndies consisting of sail of the line three gun ships one of a sloop and fireship The ships of the line were Barfleur of guns Princessa Invincible Alcide Alfred Ajax Resolution Centaur Intrepid Terrible Montague Shrewsbury Belliqueax and guns each It was said that the st battalion of Royal th and th British regiments came in the fleet  dIntelligence was received that Gen Washington was at Philadelphia the preceding Friday and that his army was to march from Trenton as yesterday  thIntelligence was received from NewYork that the British fleet had sailed to counteract the French The day before the southern postrider with the mail was stopped near Pompton in the Jersies and the mail carried off the horse was left in the road The same day a fleet of sail some  of which were large passed Stamford to the eastward  thIntelligence was received from NewYork that an embargo was laid on the shipping there and that British transports had been taken by the French The enemy's shipping in the North River above Fort Washington had all gone down  thIntelligence was received from NewYork that the Count de Grasse had arrived in the Chesapeak on the st ultimo that a gun ship and a frigate had entered York River that Lord Cornwallis was preparing for a vigorous defence and that sail of victuallers had been taken by Admiral Barras A heavy cannonade was heard the day before towards the Hook The same day there was much passing between the city and Fort Washington which occasioned a great rising of dust visible at a great distance and there was a rumbling of carriages in the night Mr Rivington in his paper observed the present to be the most interesting and critical era of the war The same evening a detachment marched from our army for a grand forage  thTwo companies of Col Weissenfel's regiment were ordered to Albany to cover that city against the designs of the enemy The same evening our General received a letter from Gen Washington dated at the Head of Elk the preceding day in which he observes "I have it now in my power to congratulate you on the arrival of Count de Grasse with ships of the line and some frigates in the Chesapeak with a body of land forces on board which he debarked immediately on his arrival On his passage he took Lord Rawdon who was bound from Charleston to England This arrival with Col Laurens from France must fill the United States with the most happy prospects and expectations"  "I am thus far on my way to Virginia with the troops under my command we are now embarking the heavy baggage stores and some of the troops""I must beg of you not to forget sending the quantity of beef I requested as I must at present altogether depend on that supply"  The same day intelligence was received that the enemy's fleet which sailed up the Sound on the th had made a descent on NewLondon At evening Maj Talmadge with cavalry and infantry was ordered to move immediately towards the Sound The preceding day about sail of the enemy's vessels passed the Sound towards NewYork  On the morning of the th the foragers returned with loads of hay  thIntelligence was received from Governor Trumbull that the enemy had made a descent on NewLondon on the evening of the th with about infantry and lighthorse Their fleet consisted of about sail of shipsofwar and transports they plundered the inhabitants of property to a large amount and burnt a great part of the town The militia behaved very gallantly and a number of very valuable citizens were killed among others Col Ledyard Captains Saltonstall and Richards The enemy in three assaults on the fort on Groton side of the river were repulsed but on the fourth attempt carried it The militia collecting in greater numbers with some pieces of artillery the enemy retreated on board their shipping Part of the American shipping in the harbour were scuttled and some were run up the river In Governor Trumbull's letter the enemy were charged with behaving in a wanton and barbarous manner and that of between and men who were killed only were killed before the enemy entered the Fort and the garrison had submitted that on Col Ledyard's delivering his  sword reversed to the commanding officer who entered the fort the officer immediately plunged it in the Colonel's body on which several soldiers bayoneted him It is also asserted that upon the foregoing taking place an American officer who stood near to Col Ledyard instantly stabbed the British officer who stabbed the Colonel on which the British indiscriminately bayoneted a great number of Americans  This expedition was commanded by Arnold The British loss was very considerable in killed and wounded among the former was Major Montgomery Arnold himself continued on the NewLondon side and while his troops were plundering and burning was said to have been at a house where he was treated very politely that while he was sitting with the gentleman regaling himself the latter observed that he hoped his house and property would be safe he was answered that while he Arnold was there it would not be touched but the house except the room in which they were was soon plundered and found to be on fire During the plunder of the town the British as is always the case in a plunder were in great confusion setting their arms against trees and fences while they were collecting and carrying off their plunder in this situation they might have been easily defeated nor would it have been the first time that an army in possession of victory lost it in this way hence by the articles of war "If any officer or soldier shall leave his post or colours to go in search of plunder he is liable to suffer death for the offence"  It is not meant to exculpate or to aggravate the conduct of the enemy on this occasionbut two things are to be remembered first that in almost all cases the slaughter does but begin when the vanquished give way and it has been said that if this was fully  considered troops would never turn their backs if it were possible to face their enemy Secondly in all attacks by assault the assailants between the feelings of danger on the one hand and resolution to overcome it on the other have their minds worked up almost to a point of fury and madness which those who are assailed from a confidence in their works do not feel and that consequently when a place is carried and the assailed submit the assailants cannot instantaneously curb their fury to reason and in this interval many are slain in a way which a cool bystander would call wanton and barbarous and even the perpetrators themselves when their rage subsided would condemn but while the human passions remain as they now are there is scarcely a remedy  thArnold's fleet was still in the Sound and further depredations were expected they were this morning at Killingsworth and about noon sail of vessels came to anchor between Norwalk and Stamford Major Talmadge who was returning upon supposition that the enemy had returned to NewYork was ordered back immediately Maj Knapp was detached with men to reinforce Col Putnam on the lines and Brig Gen Huntington with the first Connecticut brigade and a detachment of artillery was ordered to march towards the Sound The same day the army moved from its encampment at Peek'sKill and took a very strong position on Bald Hill where it encamped in one line the second line forming in the centre of the first and the th Massachusetts regiment was ordered to march from the army and reinforce the garrison of WestPoint  thIntelligence was received that on the enemy's anchoring off Stamford Maj Talmadge advanced towards the town Gen Huntington had advanced as far as Bedford and that the preceding morning the enemy's fleet came to sail and stood  principally to the westward some of the fleet at the same time standing over to Huntington Bay LongIsland Maj Talmadge was to remain at or near Canaan for the protection of the inhabitants Gen Huntington to return to the army  The Hessian recruits which had a little before arrived at NewYork were very sickly and many died The fleet which had arrived at NewYork were in bad condition The Prudente and Robuste lay at the shipyard the Roebuck had been sent to Halifax to repair and had not returned Mr Rivington in his paper talked of another fleet coming out under Admiral Digby  thThe enemy had still a number of troops on board their transports in the harbour The same day intelligence was received from Canada that the enemy were preparing a number of canoes and small batteaux at St John's baking hard bread at Montreal and forwarding it to St John's c The Cork fleet had arrived at Quebec The same day about sail of the enemy's vessels passed in the Sound to the eastward  thIntelligence was received that a brigade of troops had lately come to St John's from whence an incursion on our northern frontier might be expected on which the whole of Wiessensel's regiment was ordered for Albany immediately notice was also given to the eastern Governors and the Brigadiers commanding the militia in the counties of Hampshire and Berkshire in Massachusetts requested to lend their aid if it should be found necessary  thA deserter came in from NewYork he reported that when he left the city about sail of vessels were falling down to the Hook said to have troops on board  thThe d and th Massachusetts regiments were ordered to go into garrison at WestPoint and  the th regiment to join the army it had before been in garrison The same day intelligence was received from NewYork that there had been a naval engagement off the Chesapeak between sail of British menofwar and French ships of the line the story was so badly told in NewYork that there was good grounds to conclude that the British had received a severe drubbing On the th when a packet arrived at NewYork people were said to be waiting on the wharves to learn the news but not a word transpired nor did the countenance of the officer who landed appear to beam with the smiles of fortune The enemy had taken a number of heavy cannon from the grand battery which were put on board ship The troops still remained on board the transports and had fallen down to the Hook A mortal sickness prevailed in Delancy's corps at Morrissania which was much reduced in its numbers  dIntelligence was received that the British fleet had been pretty severely handled by the French and some of the ships were considerably damaged that the inhabitants were in great consternation in NewYork many were packing up their goods that Arnold's loss at New London in both killed and wounded was very considerable that the th th and th regiments were on that expedition and then considered as unfit for duty Gen Sir Henry Clinton was said to be embarked with the troops report said from to thousand among them the British and Hessian grenadiers lightinfantry d regiment c  thA grand forage was made below the lines The British fleet returned to the Hook on the th The Prudente of guns had gone down in a miserable condition to join the fleet and the Robuste of guns had hauled down nearly opposite to the  city The heavy cannon had been taken from Fort Washington as well as the grand battery  thFortysix loads of forage were brought off from below the lines Mr Rivington published another account of the naval engagement between the fleets on the th he acknowledged that several ships were much damaged and that two which had come from the WestIndies leaky were more so after the engagement that in particular the Terrible was so much damaged as occasioned the taking out her guns c and setting her on fire after which the fleet returned to the Hook finding it impracticable to succour Lord Cornwallis It was said that the troops which had embarked about had debarked on Staten Island Other accounts stated their number not more than they were impressing and collecting waggons  thThree deserters came in from Col Wurmb's eorps with their arms c  thApprehending that the enemy might have intentions of crossing over from Staten Island to the Jersies a detachment of infantry with light artillery under the command of Col Swift were ordered to cross the ferry the next morning and move as far as Ramapaugh to be at hand to aid the militia in case the enemy should land in the Jersies  thIntelligence was received from the northward that a small party had been sent from St John's to Saratoga to take a prisoner or two for the purpose of obtaining information but that  ive of the party with the instructions of the British commandant at St John's were taken and brought in by Captain Dunham  thIntelligence was received that Admiral Digby arrived at NewYork the th inst with three sail of the line and one frigate Prince William Henry the King of England's third son came in  this fleet It was said in NewYork that Lord Cornwallis's force in Virginia consisted of regular troops and levies but that behind him was a numerous continental armybefore him a powerful French fleet The troops on Staten Island were at this time suspected to be planning some secret expedition and Congress from some intelligence which they had received were not without apprehensions that Philadelphia might be their object The militia of Pennsylvania were held in readiness for instant service and our General was notified to hold the army in readiness to move if necessary The enemy were carefully watched Sir Henry Clinton was endeavouring to devise some means whereby he might relieve Lord Cornwallis but nothing would have diverted Gen Washington from capturing him The NewYork papers were filled with addresses and adulations to their young Prince but these could not retard the advances of a WASHINGTON or defend Cornwallis The fleet of Count de Grasse made several captures  October  dA detachment marched for a grand forage  dAt o'clock A M Major Trescott with a detachment of men from Maj Talmadge's command crossed the Sound to LongIsland and completely surprised the enemy's Fort  Slonge  making Captains Lieutenant and rank and file prisoners of the enemy were killed and wounded of the Americans none were killed and but one wounded Two

address and gallantry  thThe foragers returned with upwards of loads of hay  thA detachment of dragoons were sent towards Boston and picked infantry under Maj Morrel were to march towards Springfield to escort a large sum of money brought by Col Laurens to Philadelphia  thThe enemy were again embarking their troops from Staten Island they embarked on board the menofwar Considering their case as desperate they were determined to make one desperate attempt Ten or twelve fireships were prepared to sail with the fleets they were filled with proper materials for the purpose and to prevent suspicion they were new painted had guns and the appearance of some of the handsomest ships in the fleet  thA detachment was sent on a grand forage The same day intelligence was received that a party

Brig Gen Stark had been in command for some time at the northward  thOur General ordered the d NewHampshire regiment and a detachment of artillery to the northward Gen Stark had executed a Mr Loveless sent in by Capt Dunham as a spy  thIntelligence was received that the enemy had advanced to this side of Lake George  thThe st NewHampshire and th Massachusetts regiments with a detachment of artillery were ordered to Albany were matters wore a more serious aspect  thIntelligence was received that on the th ult Gen Washington took a position in the neighbourhood of Yorkthe enemy gave him no annoyance on his advancing a body of horse paraded before the enemy's works but retired upon the discharge of a few shot at them  The th was spent in taking another position as near the enemy's advanced works as could be done without placing the encampment in the range of their shot Some skirmishing happened between our riflemen and the yaugers in which the former had the advantage At night the enemy abandoned all their outposts some of which were very advantageous and retired to the town the Americans occupied the same ground and made lodgements at a short distance from the enemy's lines The heavy artillery was to be brought up as soon as possible and the siege pushed with vigour  thCol Scammell who was officer of the day was wounded and taken prisoner by a party of the enemy's horse as he was reconnoitring one of the works which had just before been evacuated  Our General had ordered Maj Gen Lord Sterling to proceed to Albany and take the command of the troops in that quarter he set out for the northward about noon on the th The same day Col Tupper with the st NewHampshire and th Massachusetts regiments and a detachment of artillery embarked at Fishkill Landing and arrived at Albany in hours afterwards The same day it was learnt that the enemy's fleet at NewYork was or sail of the line and that or of the best troops at NewYork had embarked and were on the  point of sailing to attempt to relieve Earl Cornwallis it was also said that Cornwallis was short of bread and that his meat provisions would not last him more than the mouth out at farthesthe had received fresh provisions but once after he was blockaded  On the morning of the th a horseguard belonging to Gen Howe's division consisting of a serjeant privates and waggoners with horses were taken by Delancy's horse a little below Croten River where the horses had been put to pasture contrary to orders A Court of Inquiry was ordered to investigate the matter  thIt was learnt that on the preceding Saturday a British gun ship was struck by the lightning at NewYork and sustained considerable damage  dGen Greene's official letter to Congress announced that his battle on the th near Eutaw Springs was well fought that on the field he obtained the victory drove and pursued the enemy for several miles when the enemy throwing themselves into a threestory brick house a stockaded garden and thick brush renewed the action when after some efforts to dislodge them Gen Greene thought it adviseable to call off his troops which was done and the wounded brought off except such as were under the fire of the house Four brass sixpounders having had their horses killed were also lest near the house in possession of the enemy This was somewhat similar to what took place at Germantown battle and now very probably saved the British from a total defeat The close of this action barred its being called a complete victory although its  essects  proved it such General Greene of Continental State troops and militia had one Lieutenant Colonel Major Captains Subalterns Serjeants and rank and file killed Lieutenant Colonels  Captains Subalterns Serjeants and rank and file wounded Serjeant and rank and file missing BrigadierGeneral of militia wounded Of the enemy prisoners including the wounded which the enemy left behind them were taken and it was supposed that the killed and other wounded of the enemy must be nearly more Perhaps troops never fought better than the Americans did in this battle and of the British General Greene observed "the enemy fought with equal spirit and worthy of a better cause"  By a letter from Gen Washington of the th it appeared that the operations against Earl Cornwallis had then gone on but slowly but that the trenches were to be opened that night The same letter observed that some misunderstanding which had subsisted in Vermont was settled and that Gen Enos and the troops under his command were to be subject to the orders of our General  The army in the Highlands were at this time short of flour occasioned by the dry season and consequent want of water for the mills  thA letter was received from Gen Washington dated at York in Virginia the th by which it appeared that the trenches were opened on the night of the th without being discovered by the enemy until daylight The approaches were carried on within yards of the enemy's works without any lossthe th and th were employed in erecting batterieson the th two batteries one on the right and the other on the left were opened The next morning four other batteries being completed the whole opened a heavy fire of cannon and mortars which soon become so warm as to drive the enemy from their guns and their fire was almost totally silencedvery little return was made afterwards The Charron of guns with one transport  took fire from our shot or shells the evening of the th and were both consumed The th another ship was destroyed in the same manner The same night the second parallel was advanced within less than yards of the enemy's lines This approach was also effected without annoyance and on the th the fatigue men were securely covered while they were completing the works The same evening there was a flying report and which seemed to gain credit that Earl Cornwallis and his army surrendered on the th and that Count de Grasse had gone out to meet Admiral Digby  thIntelligence was received of the advance of the enemy at the northward  thCol Francis with the specie from Boston passed the river the money was escorted by horse of Sheldon's regiment and infantry and Lieut Col Mellen was ordered with a detachment of infantry to move on the lower road as far as Morristown keeping between the escort and the enemy  thIn the afternoon a letter from Gen Washington to our General announced the pleasing and highly important news of the complete capture of Earl Cornwallis and his whole army on the th Our General had assured the army that the moment he received the certain intelligence of the capture of Cornwallis it should be announced to them by the discharge of cannon near his quarters these were now the heralds to the army and were instantly answered by a like number of field pieces in every brigade on the ground  On the th two of the enemy's redoubts were stormed one by the Americans and the other by the French troops and soon carried with but little loss The possession of these redoubts gave the allied army in a great measure the command of the  other works of the enemy who on the th beat a parley and on the th surrendered regular troops laid down their arms more were sick and wounded in the hospitals These were exclusive of sailors negroes c Earl Cornwallis was to go to England on parole and remain a prisoner until exchanged The officers and men were to be exchanged as far as the garrison of Charleston would extend the remainder were to continue prisoners of war the British were to retain their private baggage It was said that more than vessels were taken from the enemy A detail of the prisoners taken was stated as follows one Lieut General one Brig General Colonels Lieut Colonels Majors Captains Lieutenants Ensigns Chaplains Adjutants QuarterMasters Surgeons Mates Serjeants Drummers and Trumpeters rank and sile in the Commissary's departmentsailors in the pay of the King killed during the siege deserters brass cannon iron do muskets with bayonets muskets without bayonets and damaged muskets were among the trophies of victory Thus was the principal force of the enemy crushed in the south At the northward the enemy were advancing both by the way of the Lakes and by the Mohawk River Col Willet with his regiment of NewYork levies and some militia of NewYork and from the western parts of Massachusetts were advancing to meet Maj Ross who with from to men principally British troops was making his way towards Albany through the settlements on the Mohawk  thIntelligence was received that an action  ook place the preceding Thursday near Johnstown between the troops under the command of Col Willet and Maj Ross  Col Willet having advanced until he had arrived near Maj Ross detached Maj Rowley of Massachusetts with a body of militia by a circuitous movement to get in the rear of the enemy with orders that as soon as he heard the firing in the front to fall on them Maj Rowley performed his manoeuvre accordingly and as soon as Col Willet judged that the Major had gained the rear of the enemy he made a vigorous charge on their front when they immediately gave way and to all appearance the Colonel was nearly in the grasp of victory when all at once without any visible occasion the levies came to a stand and then immediately began to fall back the enemy facing about and charging vigorously the Colonel's brass fieldpiece and ammunition tumbrel fell into the hands of the enemy and a rout seemed to be taking place when Maj Rowley not knowing what had taken place in the front commenced a brisk attack on the enemy's rear this instantly threw them into confusion the levies rallied in the front and fought with redoubled bravery the fieldpiece and tumbrel were retaken and the enemy put to a most complete rout and pursued until the levies militia and some Oneida Indians who were with Col Willet were worn down with fatigue It was not possible to ascertain the number of the enemy's slain for to use the words of the reporting officer "Unless the swamps and rivers in which they fell were to report the killed it was impossible to make a return of them" Major Butler so frequently a troublesome partizan officer on the frontiers was killed by the Indians as he was passing a river Fiftytwo prisoners were taken and brought in and Major Ross went off in a direction into the woods where he and his troops must have suffered extremely for provisions cOf the levies and militia with Col Willet Lieutenant and rank  and file were killed Captain Lieutenants and rank and file were wounded Captain Lieutenant and privates missing Thus were the designs of the enemy also frustrated in the north  The Corporation of the city of Albany were so much impressed with the seasonable and effectual exertions made by our General to save their city from destruction that they sent him the following very polite address  ALBANY  October    SIR  THREATENED as this city and the frontiers of the State have been with destruction from an enemy who forgetting the rights of humanity and the customs of war adopted by civilized nations have hitherto waged it with all the spirit of the most savage barbarismwe cannot reflect but with pleasure and gratitude on the alacrity with which you have pursued the intentions of the Commander in Chief in affording with so much dispatch a competent support to oppose the enemy permit us therefore to render you our unfeigned thanks and to assure you that the Corporation of the city of Albany can never be unmindful of your attention and we entertain not the least doubt but that similar sentiments influence every inhabitant who has experienced the advantage of your generous exertions  We are Sir with the greatest respect and esteem your most obedient humble Servants  By order of the Corporation  Signed ABRA TEN BROECK  Mayor  The Hon Maj Gen HEATH  stThe army in the Highlands celebrated the glorious victory obtained over Lord Cornwallis The whole army was under arms in one line the  artillery interspersed with the brigades to which it was attached at o'clock the army was reviewed by the General at one a grand  feudejoy  was fired after which all the officers dined together at a table spread in the field and formed a great square where great festivity and social mirth prevailed The soldiery had an extra boon on the occasion and to crown the whole in the midst of the joy around the table an officer approached our General and informed him that at the request of the prisoners in the provost who were pretty numerous he was desired to represent that their hearts expanded with joy on account of the glorious victory obtained by their illustrious Commander in Chiefthat they lamented they could not express it with their comrades in arms but that they did it heartily in their confinement and solicited the General's goodness in an order for something to cheer their spirits This was instantly done with an additional order to the officer of the provost guard to set every prisoner in confinement at liberty The promulgation of this order drew a shout of approbation from the whole body of the officers at the table and probably had a better effect on the discipline of the army than a continuation of confinement and exemplary punishment of the culprits could have produced The general order of the day directed that "As soon as the  feudejoy  is over the arms ammunition c are immediately to be put in perfect order for instant action All guards pickets and centinels to be vigilant and alert on their posts" which notwithstanding the joy of the day was strictly observed  On this occasion there were rejoicings in all parts of the United States one instance seems to be worthy of notice the company collected had determined to burn Gen Arnold in  effigy  for his treachery  at WestPoint just as they were going to commit the effigy to the flames one of the company observed that one of Arnold's legs was wounded when he was fighting bravely for America that this leg ought not to be burnt but amputated in which the whole company agreed and this leg was taken off and safely laid by  November  dAt night the escort with the southern mail who had put up at Col Cooper's in Clark's Town were attacked by a gang of villains who fired into the house and killed the Serjeant dead on the spot and wounded

dismissed The British at NewYork at this time wished to strike some of the posts in the Highlands  but did not attempt any of them The army was short of flour but amply supplied with meat  About this time our General received a letter from Gen Washington dated at York Virginia October th in which among other things the Commander in Chief observes "There will be no occasion for forwarding on any more beef cattle from the northward for this army Should there be a greater quantity of cattle sent from the NewEngland States than the daily consumption of your army shall require I would wish the surplus might be salted if practicable at some convenient place on the North River otherwise it will be necessary for you to give orders to the Agents and Commissaries to prevent their sending more cattle than you shall have occasion for" This was the good fruit of the systematic arrangement  thGen Glover with his own brigade marched for the lines in order to cover a grand forage  thLieut

stationed in the North River mounted guns and had two gunboats with her The enemy continued at work on their canal and lines which they were making very strong An incredible number of fascines had been made during the winter on LongIsland and StatenIsland strongly bound with eight bands these were placed in the face of the work with five pickets in each fascine  thThe Commander in Chief reviewed the d Massachusetts brigade and th regiment and dined with our General The same day two deserters came in from the ship in the river The same night an armed brig and three boats full of men came up the Hudson and came to anchor a little above the place where our guardboats rendezvous at Nyack they were early discovered and the alarm given The soldiers landed at Haverstraw about one o'clock on the morning of the th and took or militiamen It was supposed that their design was to have taken our whaleboats they were refugees and sailors Not knowing but this might have been a feint  to an attack on the lines men were detached for their support if necessary The enemy returned down the river in the afternoon having in addition to the militia above mentioned taken two of Capt Pray's men who were out burning coal and two others who were over at Tarrytown fishing and destroyed some seines It was learnt from the northward that the enemy were repairing and building boats at St John's

Mohawk River had killed a soldier and a lad and had taken a soldier prisoner and burnt a building  thThree deserters came in from Robinson's corps they made their escape from LongIsland by crossing

laid an embargo on the shipping at NewYork News was received that Holland had formed an alliance with France and that a Spanish fleet had arrived in the WestIndies  thThe General Officers and officers commanding brigades and regiments met at our General's quarters in consequence of orders from the Commander in Chief to give an opinion what measures ought to be adopted in consequence of the horrid and brutal murder of a Capt Huddy who had commanded a blockhouse at Tom's River in the Jerfies  and had been taken prisoner by the enemy and carried to NewYork where he was closely confined under guard and in the sugarhouse and on board a vessel in irons and then carried over to Bergen in the Jersies and hanged by the refugees a Capt Lippincot directing the execution This was done under the pretence that Capt Huddy had been concerned in the death of one Philip White although White was killed by the guard from whom he endeavoured to make his escape and Capt Huddy was at the same time a prisoner with the enemy Huddy was left hanging on a tree with the following label fastened on his breast  "Up goes Huddy for Philip White"  This wanton and cruel act so exasperated the inhabitants of NewJersey that they drew up a petition signed by a vast number of respectable citizens claiming of Gen Washington as the Military Guardian of their country the obtainment of justice for this horrid act or  retaliation  in case justice was refused Indeed painful as the idea of retaliation must be to the feelings of humanity it seemed now to be the only preventative of more horrid murders Gen Washington with his wonted prudence and talent for investigation free of all bias ordered the officers to assemble as before mentioned and directed our General to state to them the occasion of their being convened and then the following questions "Shall there be retaliation for the murder of Capt Huddy On whom shall it be inflicted And how shall the victim be designated" The officers assembled were forbidden to converse on the questions submitted to them each one was to write his own opinion seal it up and address it to the Commander in Chief By this mode of procedure all the influence which some officers might have on others was prevented and the spontaneous feelings of every individual officer collected Col Humphries  and Col Trumbull of the General's family attended the Council and every direction of the Commander in Chief was most strictly observed It was found that the officers were unanimous in their opinion that retaliation ought to take place that it should be inflicted on an officer of equal rank viz a Captain not under convention or capitulation but one who had surrendered at discretion and that in designating such an one it should be done by lot The Commander in Chief was pleased to approve of the opinion of the officers and wrote to the British commander demanding justice for the wanton murder of Capt Huddy informing the British General at the same time that if justice was not obtained retaliation would most assuredly take place At the same time arrangements were put in train for retaliation the names of several British officers of equal rank and circumstances were thrown together and a fair and impartial lot was drawn when young Capt  Asgill  was taken he was of a noble family his father was dead and on him were the fond hopes of his mother Lady Asgill placed Indeed a more affecting scene than this can scarcely open an innocent young man doomed to suffer for the wanton offence of another which deed no doubt his soul despised and the tender breast of a mother rent in twain on the fate of her darling son Nor were the feelings of the Great WASHINGTON unmoved on this occasion they were too manifest not to be observed and could only be curbed by the invariable resolution in every exigence to exhibit the administrator of justice It was months before this tragic business closed and that the reader may have the whole narrative together it will be carried forward to such periods as will render a return back to the proper chain of events necessary  Gen Sir Guy Carleton who had come into the command in chief at NewYork wrote to Gen Washington assuring him of the fullest satisfaction  Sir Guy ordered a CourtMartial for the trial of Capt Lippencot who was charged with the murder of Capt Huddy The CourtMartial had set and given in their proceedings to Gen Carleton who wrote a letter to Gen Washington requesting a passport for Chief Justice Smith to repair to the headquarters of the American army in order to lay before the Commander in Chief the proceedings of the CourtMartial with other documents which he Sir Guy had no doubt would give full satisfaction  Upon Gen Washington's receiving the letter from Sir Guy Carleton he informed our General that he should not consent to or give a passport to Mr Chief Justice Smith to come up with the proceedings of the CourtMartial on Lippencot but that he would send him Gen Heath down to Col Phillips's near King's Bridge to meet such officer of equal rank as Sir Guy Carleton might think proper to send out to meet him with the proceedings of the CourtMartial c and on the th of July the Commander in Chief wrote to our General as follows  HEADQUARTERS  th July    DEAR SIR  FOR your information and that you may know the object of your mission I inclose to you a transcript of my letter to Sir Guy Carleton which is herewith committed to your care to be forwarded as soon as possible  Before the time of your going to Phillips's house I shall have the pleasure of seeing you or  conveying to you in writing my sentiments more fully on the subject of your meeting  With great regard c Signed G WASHINGTON  Maj Gen HEATH  Copy  HEADQUARTERS  July st    SIR  IN reply

appointment at the house of Mr Phillips on the th day of August next At that time Gen Heath will receive from your officer the proceedings of the CourtMartial on Capt Lippencot for the murder of Capt Huddy together with such other documents as you shall think proper to communicate  The assurance which your Excellency has given me of the fullest satisfaction in this matter is as pleasing as it is interesting  Your Excellency's propositions contained in your letter of the th have been communicated to Congress and are now under the consideration of that honourable body as soon as I am favoured with their determination your Excellency may be assured I will do myself the honour to communicate it  I have the honour c Signed G WASHINGTON  Sir GUY CARLETON  By his Excellency George Washington  Esq  General and Commander in Chief of the forces of the United States of America  To Maj Gen HEATH  SIR  HIS Excellency Sir Guy Carleton having requested a passport for Chief Justice Smith to repair to the headquarters of the American army in order to lay before me the proceedings of a CourtMartial on the trial of Capt Lippencot for the murder of Capt Huddy with other documents and explanations which  he says  "he has no doubt will give full satisfaction"  I do therefore from an earnest desire to proceed with candour and deliberate justice appoint you to meet an officer of equal rank at the house of Col Phillips on Monday the th instant or at any other time or place which you may think more convenient for the purpose of receiving the proceedings and documents above mentioned with such explanations  in writing  as he may think proper to communicate The papers you shall receive you will transmit to me as soon as your business is concluded together with a report of your proceedings therein  Given at headquarters  this d day of August  Signed G WASHINGTON  By his Excellency's command  The following instructions accompanied the foregoing commission  To Maj Gen HEATH  SIR  HAVING desired you to meet an officer from Sir Guy Carleton for the purpose mentioned in your  appointment and authority you will proceed to execute said business in the course of which you may inform the officer you meet that as I have no connexion with or control over any person in the line in which Mr Smith walks as the question before us is in my opinion purely of a military nature and reduceable to this single point whether the perpetrator of the wanton and cruel murder of Huddy is to be given up or a British officer to suffer in his place that I could see no propriety or necessity in an interview with the Chief Justice  If you should find that the design of Sir Guy Carleton is to procrastinate this business to envelope it in as much intricacy and difficulty as possible or that he means to justify it by recrimination and law cases thereby attempting to avert our purposes of retaliation you may assure him unless you shall judge it expedient to leave me more at liberty if not explicitly at least by strong insinuation that he will miss his aim and that my deliberate and dispassionate proceedings in this case are intended to give him as he now has had full time to determine whether the guilty person or an innocent officer shall be made the subject of retaliation  You will be particularly cautious that whatever passes in the conference you are to have which is to be considered as official be committed to writing that no omissions or misconceptions may be plead hereafter and you will inform the officer in explicit terms if you find the matter is not likely to end as justice dictates and we could wish that all oral conversation will be excluded from the official report of these proceedings now or any share in the account of them hereafter or the recital of them will be considered as unfair and an evident departure from that line of rectitude which we wished to pursue for an unbiassed world to judge by  If notwithstanding my letter to Sir Guy Carleton requesting his appointment of an officer of your rank to meet you on this business he should send Mr Chief Justice Smith you may at your discretion either receive the proceedings of the Court and such other documents as he is merely the bearer of without going into any explanation with this gentleman or refuse the whole as the circumstances of the moment shall dictate to you Or if this gentleman should be an attendant on the officer aforementioned you may refuse to admit him at your conference In the first case you may either return with the proceedings c or you may write Sir Guy Carleton that you will wait a given time for an officer agreeable to the purport of my letter to him of the th of last month  Given at headquarters Newburgh  August d  Signed G WASHINGTON  In the afternoon of

rank to be the bearer of a bundle of papers only but adds they shall be sent out in the ordinary course of conveyance Your letter to Col Trumbull covering the new adopted system of issues c is received  Signed G WASHINGTON  Maj Gen HEATH  Not long after the proceedings of the CourtMartial on Capt Lippencot for the murder of Capt Huddy were sent out Lippencot was acquitted by the Court and it appeared that the British Commanders in Chief both Sir Henry Clinton and Sir Guy Carleton disapproved the act It seemed that a kind of Board of Directors who had a subordinate direction of the refugee operations were some how concerned in this business and that  argument  and some  artifice  were necessary to smooth it over However Gen Washington painful as his task was was not to be diverted from justice or retaliation but execution was suspended Lady Asgill learning the unhappy situation of her darling son with much policy and equal success applied to the Count de Vergennes then Prime Minister of France who spread the matter before the King and Queen indeed it was a subject that needed no extra colouring to fix it on the mind of humanity The King and Queen listened to the request and Congress was addressed in a representation that the French as well as American arms were victorious at York and that the former seemed to have some share in the prisoners and hinted that it would be pleasing to the French Court if young Asgill was pardonedwhich Congress complied with and although reparation for the wanton murder of Capt Huddy was not fully obtained yet it is highly probable that the firm and determined conduct of Gen Washington on the occasion put a final stop to any further repetition of the kind  Sir Guy Carleton was probably the greatest General which the British had in America during the war and it was fortunate for the Americans that he was so long kept within the limits of Canada In him were combined many of those great qualifications which form the General  When Sir Guy visited the American prisoners in consinement in Canada he addressed them with all the tenderness of a father he observed to the young prisoners that he did not blame them it was the fault of the designing men of their country that had led them into difficulty that he would not hold them in consinement but would send them home to their fathers and friends See here the soothing art that could not fail to cool the ardour of the young warrior in the cause of his country  To Gen Waterbury of Connecticut when he shew him his commission Sir Guy observed"Your commission is from the proper authority of your Colony Connectieut had not changed her form of government you are no rebel Sir you shall go home to your family"  Soon after Sir Guy Carleton came into the command at NewYork a Connecticut soldier who had been a prisoner came out to our army and requested a pass to go home informing that he had given a parole to Sir Guy not to serve again during the war but he was ordered to join his regiment which disappointed the soldier exceedingly Gen Washington ordered the Commissary of Prisoners to credit the British for one man exchanged and informed Sir Guy that this practice would not be allowed Many soldiers were at that time very uneasy in the American armyhad a conduct of this sort been allowed many soldiers on the outposts and otherwise might have gone to the enemy have pretended they were taken and have come out under parole and have gone home to the unspeakable injury of the army but it was nipped in the budonly one other having come out in the same way before it was put a stop to  We now return to take up the chain of events from which we digressed  The th of April two prisoners of war taken near Kingstreet were sent up by Major Oliver  stA SerjeantMajor deserted and came out he reported that an enterprize was contemplating at NewYork and a number of large boats were collecting at Turtle Bay  thTwo deserters came in from the Adamant manofwar of guns which lay in the East River against NewYork Admiral Digby's flag was then hoisted on board the Centurion The seamen on board the ships very sickly  The latter end of April the Duke of Cumberland packet Capt Dashwood arrived at NewYork in six weeks from England with the March mail by which it was learnt that the debates in the British Parliament on the American war grew more and more interesting that a motion had been made by Gen Conway for bringing in a bill empowering the King to make peace with America  The beginning of May the British eruizers were very successful against the Americans eleven sail of vessels from Philadelphia were taken and carried into NewYork with near barrels of flour  May  thThis evening exhibited the most extraordinary  aurora borealis  ever before seen by those who observed it  thIt was learnt that the merchants of Edinburg at a meeting on the th of the preceding January declared and published their sentiments and wishes for a peace with America and a renewal of friendship It was also further learnt that it was the prevailing sense of the British House of Commons as a first step to an accommodation with America to change the mode of carrying on the war and to act only on the defensive on the Continent and that the person who should advise to offensive operations against the Americans should be considered as  an enemy to the King and nation At the same time France and Holland appeared to be making great preparations for a vigorous campaign  thSymptoms of a dangerous mutiny were discovered in the Connecticut line it had been conducted with so much address as to have been nearly matured before it was divulged Under the pressure of real or supposed grievances the soldiers of the whole line had determined at revelle the next morning to have marched from their cantonment with arms c complete for Fishkill were they were to take a number of fieldpieces and such ammunition and provisions as might be necessary and then proceed to Hartford and there demand of their new General Assembly that justice which they supposed was their due Just as the officers were going to bed a faithful soldier who was waiter to an officer came into his room and told the officer that he could not go to rest until he divulged to him an event which would assuredly take place the next morning at break of day and that every thing was then in readiness for itand laid open the whole secret The matter was immediately communicated to the principal officers of the line and several soldiers were seized and confined and one suffered The whole design was frustrated Mutiny is a most horrid ofsence in an army which without strict order and discipline is but a rope of sand On the other hand human nature can bear but to a certain degree and no further hence any trial of human nature beyond such a degree is impolitic and unjustifiable Of this line it may with strict justice be said that their whole conduct through the war was highly meritorious  thA stop was put to the inoculation with the smallpox  thA prisoner was sent up and a deserter came in  thNews was received that there had been a total change of the British Ministry and that Fort St Philip and the whole island of Minorca surrendered to the Spaniards on the th of the preceding February by capitulation  thEleven trusty Serjeants were sent to Massachusetts to march on

was a great talk of peace in NewYork  In the American army great preparations had for some time been making to celebrate the birth of the Dauphin of France At least men a day were employed under the direction of the engineers and other artists in constructing a most superb  arbor  decorated with every emblem and device descriptive of the occasion and the alliance between France and America which ingenuity could invent and perhaps for any thing of the kind constructed in the field was never surpassed  stThe birth of the Dauphin of France was celebrated by the American army An elegant dinner was provided by order of the Commander in  Chief of which the officers of the army and a great number of ladies and gentlemen invited from the adjacent country partook Thirteen toasts were drank announced by the discharge of cannon At evening there was a grand feudejoy opened by the discharge of cannon three times repeated The feudejoy being fired in the dusk had a pleasing appearance to the eye as well as the ear and was so ordered for that purpose The army was not formed in line but each brigade was drawn up in front of its own cantonment or camp on both sides of the river and thus were in a circle of several miles circumference in the centre of which the Commander in Chief and the spectators were placed After the feudejoy there was an exhibition of fireworks c  June  dInformation

remarkably dry both to the eastward and southward it was with difficulty that the army could obtain a supply of water About this time an embarkation of Hessian troops took place at NewYork  thThere

well  dIt was learnt that the shipsofwar and transports at NewYork were watering and preparing for sea and a number of regiments were under orders for embarkation A little before this time Congress had authorized and empowered Gen Washington to adjust and finally settle the accounts subsisting between the United States and the British government respecting the support of the prisoners of war on both sides and to provide by a general cartel for their greater comfort and exchange under the great seal ratifying what he the Commander in Chief of their army should agree to  Gen Washington transferred this power to MajorGenerals Heath and Knox whom he appointed Commissioners for the purpose and instructed them not to proceed to business unless the British Commissioners were found to be equally empowered to bring the business to a final issue  The time and place of meeting were agreed to by the two Commanders in Chief and was to be on the th of September at Tappan  thThe American

thThe American Commissioners embarked on board their barges at King's Ferry and fell down the river to Tappan Landing where they arrived about o'clock P M In less than half an hour the British Commissioners in two vessels wearing flags came up the river and cast anchor off the Landing The American Commissioners waited at the shore and sent off their barges to aid in bringing the British Commissioners on shore the river being at that time very rough on their reaching the shore it was found that Lieut Gen Campbell and the Hon Mr Elliot who had been Lieut Governor of NewYork were the Commissioners on the part of the British The whole dined together an elegant dinner having been ordered by the American Commissioners and politeness and great sociability took place and a mutual arrangment for the daily support of the table was agreed on as it was expected that the business would not be completed in less than three or four weeks if the whole object was adjusted  thThe Commissioners interchanged copies of their respective powers these were to be considered  until the next day when answers were to be given in writing whether the powers were satisfactory on both sides On examining the powers given to the British Commissioners it appeared that their doings would not be conclusive until confirmed and were very short of those held by the American Commissioners whose agreement and signature were to be final  thThe American Commissioners stated to the British Commissioners that the powers with which they were vested were inadequate to effect the expectations of the government of the United States and that therefore the negociation must be broken off Of the great difference of the powers the British Commissioners were fully convinced The American Commissioners thought it to be their duty when they gave their note of objections to the British delegated powers to hand with it a very pointed protest in behalf of the United States against that conduct on the part of the British which had so long delayed the settlement of the accounts for the support of the prisoners of war which were in the power of the United States The Commissaries of Prisoners on both sides were present to present and support their respective accounts and a settlement would not only have been just but also very interesting to the United States  thAbout o'clock at noon the Commissioners parted with the same politeness and goodhumour with which they met and which had invariably continued during the time they were together Our General sent orders to the commanding officer at Dobb's Ferry to permit the British flags to pass down the river and the American Commissioners returned to camp The day before the th Gen Washington covered by the dragoons and lightinfantry

nature and kind was regular and beautiful Upon an eminence the troops erected a building handsomely finished with a spacious hall sufficient to contain a brigade of troops on Lord's days for public worship with an orchestra at one end the vault of the hall was arched at each end of the hall were two rooms conveniently situated for the issuing of the general orders for the sitting of Boards of

place from L'Orient in France which place she left the th of January The public dispatches brought by this vessel although they did not announce a peace to be concluded yet informed that the negociations were going on every thing was settled between America and GreatBritain and matters looked  favourable towards France but difficulties were subsisting between GreatBritain Spain and Holland Several of the outlines of the articles of the treaty between GreatBritain and the United States of America were published and in general were thought to be favourable to the latter The same packet brought dispatches for Gen Sir Guy Carleton and Admiral Digby which were forwarded to NewYork  dIt was learnt that a great uneasiness had discovered itself in the American army on account of the great arrears of pay which was due and some doubting apprehensions as to the real intention of the public to fulfil their promises to the army and in particular that of half pay An anonymous notification and two addresses to the officers made their appearance about ten days before couched in very firm and decided language these produced an address from the Commander in Chief a meeting of the officers a representation to Congress and their resolutions respecting the army at that time  The evening of the th a letter was received from Philadelphia purporting that a vessel had arrived there from Europe with the intelligence that the preliminary articles of peace were signed on the th of the preceding January Hostilities were to cease in Europe the th of February and in America on the th of this month The public dispatches had not now arrived but were momently expected  April  dIt was learnt that a very valuable prize was carried into Salem  thOur General sat out from his house in Roxbury and arrived at the headquarters of the American army at Newburgh on Hudson's River on the th in the forenoon  On the th in the general orders of the day our General was directed to take the immediate command of the army during the absence of Maj Gen Gates Congress had published their proclamation suspending hostilities  thThe Commander in Chief addressed the army on the happy cessation of hostilities as follows  The Commander in Chief orders the cessation of hostilities between the United States of America and the King of GreatBritain to be publickly proclaimed tomorrow at o'clock at the New Building and that the Proclamation which will be communicated herewith be read tomorrow evening at the head of every regiment and corps of the army after which the chaplains with the several brigades will render thanks to Almighty God for all his mercies particularly for his overruling the wrath of man to his own glory and causing the rage of war to cease amongst the nations  Although the Proclamation before alluded to extends only to the prohibition of hostilities and not to the annunciation of a general peace yet it must afford the most rational and sincere satisfaction to every benevolent mind as it puts a period to a long and doubtful conteststops the effusion of human bloodopens the prospect to a more splendid sceneand like another morningstar promises the approach of a brighter day than hath hitherto illuminated this western hemisphere On such a happy daya day which is the harbinger of peacea day which completes the eighth year of the war it would be ingratitude not to rejoice it would be insensibility not to participate in the general felicity  The Commander in Chief far from endeavouring to stifle the feelings of joy in his own bosom offers his most cordial congratulations on the occasion to all the officers of every denominationto all  the troops of the United States in general and in particular to those gallant and persevering men who had resolved to defend the rights of their invaded country so long as the war should continue for these are the men who ought to be considered as the pride and boast of the American army and who crowned with wellearned laurels may soon withdraw from the field of glory to the more tranquil walks of civil life  While the General recollects the almost infinite variety of scenes through which we have passed with a mixture of pleasure astonishment and gratitudewhile he contemplates the prospects before us with rapturehe cannot help wishing that all the brave men of whatever condition they may be who have shared in the toils and dangers of effecting this glorious revolution of rescuing millions from the hand of oppression and of laying the foundation of a great empire might be impressed with a proper idea of the dignified part they have been called to act under the smiles of Providence on the stage of human affairs for happy thrice happy shall they be pronounced hereafter who have contributed any thing who have performed the meanest office in erecting this stupendous  fabric of Freedom and Empire  on the broad basis of independency who have assisted in protecting the rights of human nature and establishing an asylum for the poor and oppressed of all nations and religions  The glorious task for which we first flew to arms being thus accomplishedthe liberties of our country being fully acknowledged and firmly secured by the smiles of Heaven on the purity of our cause and the honest exertions of a feeble people determined to be free against a powerful nation disposed to oppress them and the character of those who have persevered through every extremity of hardship suffering  and danger being immortalized by the illustrious appellation of the  Patriot Army  nothing now remains but for the actors of this mighty scene to preserve a perfect unvarying consistency of character through the very last act to close the drama with applause and to retire from the military theatre with the same approbation of angels and men which have crowned all their former virtuous actions  For this purpose no disorder or licentiousness must be tolerated every considerate and welldisposed soldier must remember it will be absolutely necessary to wait with patience until peace shall be declared or Congress shall be enabled to take proper measures for the security of the public stores c As soon as these arrangements shall be made the General is confident there will be no delay in discharging with every mark of distinction and honour all the men enlisted for the war who will then have faithfully performed their engagements with the public The General has already interested himself in their behalf and he thinks he need not repeat the assurances of his disposition to be useful to them on the present and every other proper occasion In the mean time he is determined that no military neglects or excesses shall go unpunished while he retains the command of the army  The AdjutantGeneral will have such workingparties detailed to assist in making the preparation for a general rejoicing as the Chief Engineer with the army shall call for and the QuarterMasterGeneral will also furnish such materials as he may want The QuarterMasterGeneral will without delay procure such a number of discharges to be printed as will be sufficient for all the men enlisted for the war he will please to apply to headquarters for the form  An extra ration of liquor to be issued to  every  man tomorrow to drink perpetual peace independence and happiness to the United States of America  In the afternoon of the th a schoonerCottle master from Nantucket with fish oil rum c came up the Hudson to Newburgh This was the first American vessel which had come up the river since the British took possession of NewYork in the year  thAt noon the Proclamation of the Congress for a cessation of hostilities was published at the door of the New Building followed by three huzzas after which a prayer was made by the Rev Mr Ganno and an anthem  Independence  from Billings was performed by vocal and instrumental music The same day Gen Washington went for Ringwood to meet the Secretary at War on some business of importance  thAt evening the Commander in Chief returned to headquarters  stPermission was given for such persons as might choose it to go to NewYork with provisions c A vessel was loading with flour to go down the river and one laden with rum porter cheese beef c c came up from NewYork Thus as we have seen how the rage of war came on we now see how by degrees that rage subsided until the  olive  sprang up and progressed to full bloom  thIt was learnt from Europe that on the th of February preceding the Bedford Capt Morris made entry at the customhouse in London being the first vessel that had arrived in the river belonging to the United States  thIt was learnt that the refugees were embarking in order to leave NewYork and many transports were falling down to the wateringplace  About this time Congress recommended an impost duty to the several States  thIntelligence was received that the Indians had recently committed some outrages on the western frontier had killed and scalped persons near Wheeling Creek  May  stCongress had expressed their opinion in a resolution which was this day published that the term for which the men engaged for the war are to serve does not expire until the definitive treaty is received and that then those engaged for the war and who so continue shall have their arms and accoutrements as a present for their long and faithful services  dThe next morning the Commander in Chief was to go down the river to Dobb's Ferry to meet Gen Sir Guy Carleton Four companies of lightinfantry marched this morning for that place to do the duty of guards Sir Guy was to come up the river in a frigate  dIn the forenoon the Commander in Chief and Gov Clinton with their suites c went down the river  thIt was learnt that several vessels had arrived at Boston from Europe Halifax c with merchandize in consequence of which the price of goods had much fallen and the inhabitants of the eastern States were fitting out a great number of fishing vessels  thIt was said that American prisoners had died during the war in the prisons and on board the prisonships at NewYork a surprising number and evidences that if their treatment was not severe they were too much crowded or not properly attended to in other respects Those who have seen know and others can easily conceive that where men are closely confined in great  numbers in prifonships or in gaols that without frequent airing and cleansing the air in such places becomes putrid and poisonous and produces almost certain death How much care then ought to be exercised by every humane commander in the appointment of provost officers to be assured that those whom they appoint are not only firm and resolute necessary qualifications in such officers but that they also are  considerate  and  humane  and that such commanders themselves take care to know and if necessary correct any abuses which may exist Such conduct towards the confined and distressed would add a laurel to the hero's brow equal to the triumphs of victory and more lasting for if the merciful man be merciful even to his beast how much more ought a great and brave man to feel for the unfortunate of his own species  thAt evening the Commander in Chief returned to headquarters having had an interview with Gen Sir Guy Carleton  thThe Commander in Chief went for Poughkeepsie A letter from Gen Sir Guy Carleton to Gov Clinton had rendered an interview between the Governor and the Commander in Chief necessary  thAt evening the Commander in Chief returned to headquarters  thThe army about this time were badly supplied with provisions and much uneasiness was discovered both by the officers and soldiers  stIt was learnt that Congress had passed a resolution to furlough the men engaged for the war This mode appeared to be marked with policy in several respects  June  dThe general orders of the day announced that the men engaged for the war should be immediately surloughed with a proportion of the  officers They were to be discharged as soon as the definitive treaty arrived they were to be marched home in divisions Those men that remained engaged for other periods were to be formed into complete corps The officers to agree who should stay and in cases where they could not agree seniority was to decide  dThe Maryland battalion was put under orders to march to the southward  thThe Maryland battalion marched from the cantonment The same day the general officers and officers commanding regiments and corps in the cantonment on Hudson's River having by their committee for that purpose appointed prepared an address to the Commander in Chiefit was accordingly presented in the words following  SIR  IT is difficult for us to express the regret we feel at being obliged again to solicit your Excellency's attention and patronage Next to the anguish which the prospect of our own wretchedness excites in our breasts is the pain which arises from a knowledge of your anxiety on account of those men who have been the sharers of your fortunes and have had the honour of being your companions through the various vicissitudes of the war Nothing therefore but necessity could induce us to a representation which we know must give you concern  Your Excellency has so intimate a knowledge of the condition of the army as to render a particular delineation unnecessary As you have been a witness of our sufferings during a war uncommon in its nature and unparalleled in many circumstances attending it so you are now Sir no less a witness of the unequal burden which has fallen upon us from the want of that provision to which from our assiduous  and unremitting services we conceive we are entitled Having recently expressed our sense of what was due to our distress having repeated to your Excellency the confidence we had that our accounts would be liquidated the balances ascertained and adequate funds provided for payment previous to our being dispersed or disbanded having seen with pleasure the approbation which Congress gave our reliance it is with a mixture of astonishment and chagrin that we view the late resolve of Congress by which the soldiers for the war and a proportionate number of officers are to be furloughed without any one of those important objects being accomplished and to complete the scene of woe are to be compelled to leave the army without the means of defraying the debts we have necessarily incurred in the course of service or even of gratifying those menials in the pittance which is their due much less to carry with us that support and comfort to our families of which from our long military services they have been deprived No less exposed then to the insults of the meanest followers of the army than to the arrests of the sheriffdeprived of the ability to assist our families and without an evidence that any thing is due to us for our services and consequently without the least prospect of obtaining credit for even a temporary subsistence until we can get into businessto what quarter can we look We take the liberty to say Sir only to your Excellency and from the sincerity of our hearts we do it no less from a persuasion of the efficiency of your further efforts in our favour than from the kind assurances you have been pleased to give us of your support  To your Excellency then we make our appeal and in the most solemn manner from that abhorrence of oppression and injustice which first unsheathed  our swords from the remembrance of the common dangers through which we have passed and from the recollection of those astonishing events which have been effected by our united effortspermit us to solicit your further aid and to entreat that the order of the d instant founded on the act of Congress of the th of May last may be suspended or varied in its operation so far as that no officer or soldier be obliged to receive a furlough until that honourable body can be apprized of the wretched situation into which the army must be plunged by a conformity to it that your Excellency will endeavour to prevail on Congressnay that on the principles of common justice you will insist that neither officer nor soldier be compelled to leave the field until a liquidation of accounts can be effected till the balances are ascertained certificates for the sums due given including the commutation of half pay to the officers and gratuity of dollars to the soldiers and till a supply of money can be furnished sufficient to carry us from the field of glory with honour to ourselves and credit to our country We still wish to believe that that country to which we have been so long devoted will never look with indifference on the distresses of those of her sons who have so essentially contributed to the establishment of Freedom the security of property and the rearing of an empire  In the name and behalf of the Generals and officers commanding regiments and corps in the cantonment on Hudson's River  I have the honour to be With the highest respect Your Excellency's Most obedient servant W HEATH Maj Gen  President  June th    To the foregoing address Gen Washington was pleased to return the following answer viz  HEADQUARTERS  June th    SIR  BEFORE I make a reply to the subject of the address of the Generals and Officers commanding the regiments and corps of this army presented by yourself yesterday I entreat that those gentlemen will accept my warmest acknowledgment for the confidence they have been pleased to repose in me they may be assured it shall never be abused and I beg they will be persuaded that as no man can possibly be better acquainted than I am with the past merits and services of the army so no one can possibly be more strongly impressed with their present ineligible situation feel a keener sensibility at their distresses or more ardently desire to alleviate or remove them But it would be unnecessary perhaps to enter into a detail of what I have done and what I am still attempting to do in order to assist in the accomplishment of this interesting purpose Let it be sufficient to observe I do not yet despair of success for I am perfectly convinced that the States cannot without involving themselves in national bankruptcy and ruin refuse to comply with the requisitions of Congress who it must be acknowledged have done every thing in their power to obtain ample and complete justice for the army and whose great object in the present measure undoubtedly was by a reduction of expense to enable the Financier to make the three months' payment to the army which on all hands has been agreed to be absolutely and indispensably necessary To explain this matter I beg leave to insert an extract of a letter from the Superintendant of Finance dated the th ult  It is now a month since the Committee conferred with me on that subject and I then told them no payment could be made to the army but by means of a paper anticipation and unless our expenditures were immediately and considerably reduced even that could not be done Our expenditures have nevertheless been continued and our revenues lessen the States growing daily more and more remiss in their collections The consequence is that I cannot make payment in the manner first intended the notes issued for this purpose would have been payable at two four and six months from the date but at present they will be at six months and even that will soon become impracticable unless our expenses be immediately curtailed  I shall cause such notes to be issued for three months' pay to the army and I must entreat Sir that every influence be used with the States to absorb them together with my other engagements by taxation  Three days ago a messenger was dispatched by me to urge the necessity of forwarding these notes with the greatest possible expedition  Under this state of circumstances I need scarcely add that the expense of every day in feeding the whole army will increase very considerably the inability of the public to discharge the debts already incurred at least for a considerable time to come  Although the officers of the army very well know my official situation that I am only a servant of the public and that it is not for me to dispense with orders which it is my duty to carry into execution yet as furloughs in all services are considered as a matter of indulgence and not of compulsionas Congress I am persuaded entertain the best disposition towards the armyand as I apprehend in a very short time the two principal articles of complaint  will be removedI shall not hesitate to comply with the wishes of the army under these reservations only that officers sufficient to conduct the men who choose to receive furloughs will attend them either on furlough or by detachment The propriety and necessity of this measure must be obvious to all it need not therefore be enforced and with regard to the noncommissioned officers and privates such as from a peculiarity of circumstances wish not to receive furloughs at this time will give in their names by o'clock tomorrow to the commanding officers of their regiments that on a report to the AdjutantGeneral an equal number of men engaged for three years may be furloughed which will make the saving of expenses exactly the same to the public  I cannot but hope the notes will soon arrive and that the settlement of accounts may be completed by the assistance of the PayMasters in a very few days In the mean time I shall have the honour of laying the sentiments of the Generals and Officers commanding regiments and corps before Congress they are expressed in such a decent candid and affecting manner that I am certain every mark of attention will be paid to them  I have the honour to be With great esteem Sir Your most obedient Servant Signed GEO WASHINGTON  Maj Gen HEATH  The two preceding papers were enclosed in the following letter from the Commander in Chief to his Excellency the President of Congress  HEADQUARTERS NEWBURGH  June    SIR  I HAVE the honour to enclose to your Excellency the copy of an address to me from the Generals and Officers commanding regiments and corps together with my answer to it These enclosures will explain the distresses which resulted from the measures now carrying into execution in consequence of the resolution of the th of May but the sensibility occasioned by a parting scene under such peculiar circumstances will not admit of description  The two subjects of complaint with the army appear to be the delay of the three months' payment which had been expected and the want of a settlement of accounts I have thought myself authorized to assure them Congress had and would attend particularly to their grievances and have made some little variation respecting furloughs from what was at first proposed the Secretary at War will be able to explain the reason and propriety of this alteration  While I consider it a tribute of justice on this occasion to mention the temperate and orderly behaviour of the whole army and particularly the accommodating spirit of the officers in arranging themselves to the command of the battalions which will be composed of the three years' men permit me to recall to mind all their former sufferings and merits and to recommend their reasonable requests to the early and favourable notice of Congress  I have the honour to be c  A little before this time the officers of the army beginning to realize that the dissolution of the army was drawing nigh and wishing to perpetuate that friendship which numerous hardships sufferings and common dangers had inspired in their breastsresolved to form themselves into a Society  by the name of the  Cincinnati  Several meetings were had for the purpose and an Institution was digested and completed and although our General presided at one of the meetings and cheerfully at the request of his brother officers transmitted copies of the Institution covered by a letter to the officer commanding the southern army and to the senior officers of the respective State lines from Pennsylvania to Georgiayet he had serious objections to the Institution as it stood and refused for some time to sign it He wished as much as any one in the army to perpetuate the happy friendship cemented in the breasts of the officers by an eight years common danger and sufferings but he thought this would be best done by simply forming a Society to meet annually in their respective States for the purpose of a social hour and to brighten the chain of friendship with a fund for the relief of the unfortunate of their brethren but he was opposed to any idea of any thing that had any resemblance of an order or any insignia or badge of distinction  asserting  that it would only serve to mark them in an unfavourable light with their fellowcitizens but the prevailing opinion of the officers was otherwise Our General was finally induced to sign the Institution from the following considerationbut not until all the officers were appointed and he nearly ready to leave the army conversing with an officer of rank who was of the same opinion with him they parted in the resolution not to sign the Institution but the next morning the officer called upon him and observed that one consideration not before mentioned had occurred to him viz that it might happen in the days of their posterity in case they did not sign that the descendant of one who was a member might happen to fall in company with the descendant of one who was not that the latter on observing the badge  might inquire what it was and what its intention upon its being answered that it was the insignia of a Society of which his ancestor who served in the American army during the revolution was a memberthe other might reply my ancestor too served during that war but I never heard any thing of such a badge in our family to which it might probably be answered it is likely your ancestor was guilty of some misconduct which deprived him of it Upon this our General broke out"I see it I see it and spurn the idea" which led him to sign the general Institution and he subscribed to the State fund dollars being one month's pay as was stipulated in the Institution He however never met with the Society although no one has cherished a warmer affection for every member of the army After the revolution in France finding that the insignias of distinctions were doing away it led him  anew  to review the distinction which the  badge  of the Society to which he belonged if not in fact yet in appearance seemed to exhibit and brought to mind all his former objections which induced him to write to the SecretaryGeneral to erase his name from the Institution but that his subscription to the fund should remain so long as it was applied to the purpose for which it was giventhe relief of the unfortunate  thIn the forenoon the Jersey line marched from the cantonment to their own State where they were to be disbanded The same day the first NewYork regiment made a present of their standards and band to Governor Clinton they were escorted to Poughkeepsie by the lightinfantry company of the regiment  thThe men for the war belonging to the Maryland NewJersey NewYork and NewHampshire lines having marched from the cantonment a  division of the Massachusetts men marched on this day  thA division of the Suffolk and Worcester furloughed men marched for their own State and so on a division each day until the whole had marched  thOur General was General of the Day In the after orders of the Commander in Chief on this day it was expressed"The strength of the army in this cantonment being considerably diminished by the number of men lately furloughed the order of the th of April directing a General FieldOfficers and QuarterMaster to be of the day and also a regiment to parade every day for duty is dispensed with For the present there will be one FieldOfficer and an Adjutant of the day and the guards only will form on the grand parade at o'clock in the morning" It is here a little remarkable that our General by whose orders and under whose direction the first guard in the American war mounted at the foot of Prospect Hill on the evening of the th of April after the battle of that day should happen in the course of service to be the last General of the day in the American main army on the th of June to inspect turn off and visit the guards At the first period the roads were full of  militia  pressing towards Boston to commence and prosecute a dubious war they were now filled with  veteran soldiers  covered with laurels returning from the field to their peaceful abodes  thAbout o'clock P M the wind freshened from the west there were several thundershowers with large hailstones some of which were supposed to be two inches long The lightning struck the flagstaff of the New Building entered the house and ran down the south side of it doing some damage and stunning several soldiers near the door In  the general orders of this day it was announced that the  levees  were to be discontinued  thThe men who had enlisted for years and for shorter periods not expired were formed those belonging to Massachusetts into regiments and were to be commanded by Colonels Michael Jackson Henry Jackson and Joseph Vose and Lieut Col Commandant Sprout On the morning of the th these regiments incorporated and were formed into two brigades the one commanded by Brig Gen Patterson the other by Brig Gen Greaton  thA number of officers of the army viz several general officers and officers commanding regiments and corps met at the New Building and elected his Excellency Gen Washington President General Gen M'Dougal Treasurer and Gen Knox Secretary  pro tempore  to the Society of the Cincinnati  thThe Massachusetts State Society of the Cincinnati met and made choice of Maj Gen Lincoln for their President Maj Gen Knox VicePresident Col John Brooks Secretary Col Henry Jackson Treasurer and Capt Heywood AssistantTreasurer The same day the troops at the cantonment were put under orders to be ready to march for WestPoint on the succeeding Monday  dOur General issued his last order which finished as follows "The long wished for period having arrived when the din of war ceases the olivebranch of peace is displayed the toils and fatigues of the field are drawing to a close a part of the army have already mingled with their fellowcitizens and others will probably ere long join themMaj Gen Heath being about to leave the army and this being the last opportunity which will remain in his power to express that affection for his brother officers and soldiers which more than eight years service has established  in his breast he cannot depart without leaving his best wishes for the health prosperity and happiness of those whose lot it is a little longer to continue in the fieldinvoke every blessing on them and bid them an affectionate farewel"  dThe Massachusetts regiments marched to WestPoint  The morning of the th our General was to commence his journey homeward but the Commander in Chief wished him not to proceed until the afternoon On his arrival at headquarters ColHumphries one of the AidsdeCamp of the Commander in Chief gave him a sealed letter observing to him to read it at his leisure On opening it in General Washington's own handwriting it was as follows  Private  HEADQUARTERS  June th    DEAR SIR  PREVIOUS to your departure from the army I wish to take an opportunity of expressing my sentiments of your services my obligations for your assistance and my wishes for your future felicity  Our object is at last attained the arrangements are almost completed and the day of separation is now at hand Permit me therefore to thank you for the trouble you have lately taken in the arrangement of the corps under your orders as well as for all your former cheerful and able exertions in the public service Suffer me to offer this last testimony of my regard to your merits and give me leave my dear Sir to assure you of the real affection and esteem  with which I am and shall at all times

consequence of an express from Philadelphia Four or five hundred men of the Pennsylvania line of those who had been furloughed on or about the th grew very mutinous refused to obey orders entered the city of Philadelphia seized some public stores surrounded the place where Congress and the Supreme Court of the State were sitting and made several demands and occasioned some consternation which caused a representation to the Commander in Chief The continental regiments were to be put under marching orders immediately It was judged inexpedient to call out the militia  At about o'clock P M our General took his leave of his beloved General and commenced his journey for Massachusetts and arrived at his house in Roxbury on the first day of July at o'clock P M where he gave evidence that an eight years military life had not divested him of the feelings or manners of a citizen  October  thIt was learnt that the definitive treaty of peace was signed the d of the preceding September and that dispatches were sent off to the different Courts in Europe to America the East and West Indies c with an account of this happy event  Congress by a proclamation which bore date the th of this
