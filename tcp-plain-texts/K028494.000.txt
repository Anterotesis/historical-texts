 A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND On the Present State of the Nation  BY JAMES BOSWELL ESQ  Calm is my soul nor apt to rise in arms  Except when fast approaching danger warms  But when contending Chiefs blockade the Throne  Contracting regal power to stretch their own  When I behold a factious  and agree  To call it freedom when themselves are free  The wealth of climes where savage nations roam  Pillag'd from slaves to purchase slaves at home  Fear pity justice indignation start  Tear off reserve and bare my swelling heart  Till half a patriot half a coward grown  I fly from petty tyrants to the Throne  GOLDSMITH  EDINBURGH Printed and Sold by all the BOOKSELLERS MDCCLXXXIII  A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND  IT hath for a considerable time been the reproach of Scotland that her inhabitants have been destitute of public spirit and have felt themselves merely as a number of individuals to whom no measure of state was of any consequence unless so far as it affected their private interests The reign of his present Majesty has been troubled with a series of faction hurtful to government at home and ruinous to the British power abroad But all the while Scotland has remained in cold indifference and each administration of whatever principles has been sure of our acquiescence at  least if not of our support as a matter of course  The flagrant injustice of the House of Commons in the case of the Middlesex election by which a precedent was established for violating the valuable privilege of all the electors of Great Britain was no more regarded in Scotland than any ordinary vote in that House It has since been rescinded not indeed by the same Parliament but by almost the same members So that it may be said without offence that the House of Commons is at no time infallible  The claim of the British Parliament to tax the American colonies or in other words that his Majesty's subjects in Great Britain should command the property of his Majesty's subjects in America was almost universally approved of in Scotland where due consideration was had of the advantage of raising regiments I was one of the few who as far as my voice could go ventured to oppose it both as unjust and inexpedientUnjust  because I thought the people of America as participant of the British constitution should no more be taxed without the consent of their representatives than the people of Ireland or the people of Great BritainInexpedient because I did not think it possible for this country to prevail unless one of two propositions utterly improbable but industriously circulated were true The  first  that a whole people were cowards the  second  that a whole people were willing that their all should be at the unconditional mercy of another people My intimacy with the excellent and much honoured General Oglethorpe who himself settled one of the American colonies and still lives with all his faculties and all his benevolence in full vigour  General Oglethorpe now the Father of the British army being the oldest General but without emolument settled the Colony of Georgia Pope thus celebrates him  "Or driven by strong benevolence of soul  "Will fly like Oglethorpe from pole to pole"  confirmed me  in my opinion and when pleading at the bar of the House of Commons in a question concerning taxation I avowed that opinion declaring that the man in the world for whom I have the highest respect  Dr Johnson  had not been able to convince me that  Taxation  was  no Tyranny  My principles being of a Tory cast that is to say those of a steady Royalist it grieved me to the heart that our most gracious Sovereign should be advised by evil counsellors to assent to severe measures against an immense body of his subjects who were willing faithfully to submit themselves to the King as supremeto the father of all his peoplebut not to his subjects their brethren with whom they were entitled to equal privileges  It appeared to me that  Ministry  carried on the war against our colonies chiefly in the hope that if they should be subdued a multitude of offices might  be created the disposal of which would absolutely secure a majority in Parliament upon every occasion and for that reason had there been no other every friend to rational freedom must have abhorred the design The slavery spread over the continent of America would have reverberated upon Britain The right of the people to supply or to withhold money is the great check upon the executive power and in  that  consists the chief excellence of our free government  A strong party in the House of Commons opposed that baleful administration which persevered in the American war and opposed it with such violence as at length to obtain a vote in the House of Commons  "That the influence of the Crown has increased is increasing and ought to be diminished"  the truth of which vote in this democratical reign I leave to the consideration of every candid man  I would wish in all questions of national concern not to regard men but measures and therefore I shall make no remarks upon that extraordinary fluctuation of Ministers whom we have since seen like the visions of Macbeth  "Come like shadows so depart"  But I earnestly entreat the attention of my countrymen to the alarming attempt which has been recently made to destroy the security of private property and annihilate the constitutional monarchy of these kingdoms under the pretext of  "better regulating the affairs of the EastIndia Company"  Harsh and abusive expressions can do no good and are very foreign from the intention of this Letter which is not to kindle a wild rage but to rouse a steady spirit I shall therefore abstain from using those epithets which have with justice been applied to the bill for vesting the affairs of the EastIndia Company in certain Commissioners But I  will say that I look upon this bill as the most dangerous measure to the country that ever yet was hazarded in Parliament  I shall consider it in both the views which I have mentioned  st  As affecting property and  dly  As affecting the constitution  And  st  As to  Property  the bill provides  "That the said Commissioners shall immediately enter into and possess themselves of all lands tenements houses warehouses and other buildings whatever belonging to the said Company and all books records charters c and all ships and vessels goods wares merchandises money securities for money and all other effects whatsoever and the Directors of the said Company and all officers and servants thereof are hereby injoined immediately upon the requisition of the said Commissioners to deliver to them or to such persons as they shall  appoint the several matters aforementioned"  Can a more tremenduous exercise of arbitrary power be figured than thisThat a great Company which has subsisted for above two centuries under the sanction of charters from the Crown should all at once not only be deprived of the territorial power which it has acquired and which has no doubt been flagitiously abused by some of its servants but have all its effects in all parts of the world abstracted from its own care and management and delivered up to a set of men not of its own appointment There is something in this so shocking to the first notions of property and justice as must make us shudder with consternation Were such a bill to pass into a law the expression  "What is a charter but a sheet of parchment with a bit of wax dangling to it"  might be uttered without being stigmatized as grossly indecent for there  would then be no force in a charter the essence of which is not  matter  but  spirit  If an Attorney General were hanged it might be said with vulgar triumph  "What is an Attorney General but a carcase dangling the end of a rope"  But can such expressions be used with propriety while a charter contains the faith of Majesty and the person of an Attorney General is dignified with an important trust from the King  It is well known that many individuals of different nations have their whole property vested in the funds of the EastIndia Company because it hath hitherto been believed that in this great and free country there is no danger of such confiscations or seizures by an unexpected stretch of power as have sometimes happened in other countries in Europe but had this rapacious grasp been successful Where would have been our boasted preeminence of security And how wofully must our national credit  have sunk What must the moneyed men of Holland have thought of such  better  regulating of commercial concerns They must have thought of their own  verbeetering buys  where criminals are sorely punished to make them  better  The House of Commons must have appeared a House of Correction with a vengeance  The injustice of the measure would have been the same to the proprietors of whatever nation but must have been peculiarly distressing to those of our own country who for a long period of time have been habituated to the persuasion that a Royal Charter is so sacred that nothing but the strongest reasons amounting almost to the plea of necessity can be permitted to annual or alter it  We in this part of the united kingdom experienced in the late reign an extinction of a number of chartered rights by the act abolishing heritable jurisdictions A clamour was raised at the time and there are still some who persist in  maintaining that this was an infringement of the Articles of the Union by which it was stipulated that the jurisdiction and courts of Scotland should remain as before But upon looking attentively at the Articles it will be found that the heritable jurisdictions were to be reserved only  as rights of property  Consequently they like other rights of property might at any time be taken from the owners by the Legislature for the greater good of the publick The hereditary jurisdictions were grants from the Sovereign delegating parcels of his power and when they were abolished in the persons of private territorial proprietors they were absorbed in his Majesty the great fountain from which they originally flowed and from whence they now issue in a different manner Whether the act abolishing heritable jurisdictions was a beneficial measure or not may be fairly questioned for my own part I should be better pleased to live  under the immediate jurisdiction of an hereditary Lord of ancient and generous blood than under that of a lower man who by occasional interest has been appointed a Sheriff The former was as much under the controul of higher authority as the latter But I am not going to discuss the question I mention the measure as an act of State coming nearer  "the business and bosoms"  of my countrymen and that I might recal to their remembrance the deliberation and delicacy with which it was conducted and the compensation which was made to those who were deprived of their rights Yet what is the gratification of pride by additional power when compared with the essential value of property  How different was the conduct of the EastIndia bill Was any kind of compensation to the Proprietors of that Company ever proposed Was there any tenderness shewn to those who had their whole property at stake No The tyranny of  that audacious bill I  must  be allowed this expression was unfeeling and inflexible thousands were to behold all that they had upon earth wrested from them and committed to strangers while nothing was left to them but amazement and grief Was this bill sedately and deliberately considered by the House of Commons Was full time given not only to the Proprietors but to the nation at large with humble confidence to state their objections to it No It was hurried on in a manner which will not soon be forgotten The rapidity of its course and its illlooking appearance indicated its character and when it came into the House of Lords the alarm was  Stop thief  The solemn attention paid to a subject of such magnitude by that most Honourable House where the state of the EastIndia Company was proved to require no desperate remedy and the vote by which the bill was rejected will ever  be remembered with admiration and gratitude not only by the great Company which was immediately concerned but by every Corporation in the kingdom and indeed by every man who holds any thing valuable by charter While that portentous bill was suspended over our heads every man was asking his neighbour  "What will be done next"  Cities towns banks hospitals were in danger and insignificance was the only security The comfort and joy at being relieved from such apprehensions could not but be great and universal  In the  second  place as to the  Constitution  the bill provides  "That a certain number of persons to be named by this bill shall be Commissioners for governing and managing the said territorial possessions and commerce"  And  "That the said Commissioners or the majority thereof shall have full power to remove suspend appoint or restore  all persons whatsoever from or to any office civil or military whether such persons shall have been appointed by acts of Parliament or howsoever otherwise appointed except as herein provided"  Here then we were to have had the establishment of a dominion civil and military of vast and various extent vested in persons independent of his most sacred Majesty the lawful Sovereign of the realm The patronage annexed to this dominion would have been immense and infinitely beyond what is annexed to the crown of Great Britain The very same Right Honourable Gentleman who insisted that the influence of the Crown ought to be diminished and actually prevailed in having it rigidly curtailed drove on this bill by which seven men proposed by himself were to have an influence far beyond what the Crown ever had If both these measures were parts of one preconceived plan if  while he was diminishing the power of the Crown he entertained the project of aggrandizing his own power his abilities great as we must acknowledge them to be are yet of mightier extent than we have ever imagined Had the appointment taken place  "the Crown would have been a bawble which no man of spirit would have chosen to wear"  as was nobly said by a great and intrepid Master of our constitution and most powerful Orator There would have been in Britain one constitutional Kingand an unconstitutional heptarchy not of Kings but of Emperors and that heptarchy nominated by the Right Honourable Gentleman He might then have bid defiance to any other power in the kingdom He might have had his commission prolonged during all the days of his life and sat supreme in his circle of the House of Commons possessed of such a sevenfold shield  vulgi stante corona  But this astonishing project has been happily defeated by the House of Lords the hereditary Counsellors of the King The speech of the Earl of  Abingdon  upon that memorable occasion will remain as a distinguished example of constitutional knowledge and legislative spirit Had there been nothing against the bill but its violation of chartered property I should have thought it deserved its fate and many of the Lords put their negative upon that ground But when it was equally hostile to the King and to the people and while on one hand it  directly  dashed in pieces the security of chartered property it on the other hand  indirectly  overwhelmed the Royal prerogative there were two forcible reasons for throwing it out The last was the ground taken by the  Bishop of Salisbury  who with the dignified candour which is to be found in every one of the noble family of  Barrington  offered to give his assent to the  bill if the Ministry would assure him that the King should have the appointment of the Commissioners But that would have been frustrating the enormous scheme of ministerial influence the principal object of the bill  The ferment which hath since agitated the House of Commons need neither surprise nor alarm us because there is no wonder that the great majority who voted for the bill should be angry at their disappointment That there should have been such a majority for such a measure is seriously distressing I forbear to conjecture the cause sorry I am that to some of the number may be said  et tu Brute  But it is surely not a strange thing that the Nobles of the land should set themselves against a bill which would have been so fatal to the power of the Crown For as  Blackstone  well observes  "the Nobility are the pillars which are reared from among the people more immediately to support the Throne  and if that falls they must also be buried under its ruins  Book I Chap  "  The nobility therefore in this case had a common cause with the King Why then should it be supposed why should it be  rumoured  that the influence of his Majesty determined them against a bill which the security of their own Order called upon them to reject  But were it true that the Sovereign's disapprobation of the bill was conveyed by a respectable Peer to others of his order that Noble Lord who represented his Majesty in Ireland with so generous a splendour and so much to the satisfaction of that kingdom might justly say I love his phrase  "I will meet the charge with a high head"  He has since proved to us that he did not mean the artificial high head of ministerial influence but the lofty port of conscious rectitude What Mr Harley said of Sir John Lowther in the parliament may be applied to  him  "I think  Lowther  has told you the true state of the case the greatness of his estate and mind makes him too great to be suspected in this matter  Grey's Debates Vol p  "  Can it be seriously maintained as constitutional doctrine that when the King hath recommended to Parliament in a speech from the Throne any particular business and a bill is brought in concerning that business containing clauses to which the King cannot possibly consent his Majesty shall be restrained from consulting with any of his hereditary Counsellors or any person whatever and from signifying his mind either privately or publicly  It hath been said that Ministers alone are responsible for public measures and therefore none but actual Ministers can be allowed to advise the Sovereign But there is here a falacy which it is not difficult to detect Public measures in the  executive  part of administration are those for which Ministers are responsible  and therefore they dare not carry into execution what they know to he wrong or rather what they fear may subject them to punishment but public measures in the  deliberative  part of administration are not within the province of Ministers but belong to Parliament until they have past both houses and come to receive the assent or negative of the King and then and not till then does the Ministers responsibility in that branch commence  While a bill then is pending in Parliament the Minister is perfectly secure in whatever way the influence of the Crown may be alledged to be used for Parliament is or may be altogether  independent  of that influence and if being  independent  they are  swayed  by it it must be the influence of  reason  and therefore an influence of which it would be unreasonable to complain  And what is the precedent which has been mentioned for all this jealousy of  regal influence It is a precedent taken from that gloomy period of our history the reign of Charles I when faction grew more and more virulent till it became rank rebellion and by murdering the King changed our government into anarchy and usurpation The case which has been quoted was in when the suppression of the rebellion in Ireland required speedy and effectual measures to be taken as the affairs of India do at present and when attention to the former had been recommended from the Throne as attention to the latter has now been  The passage of Charles I's speech at which exceptions were taken was as follows  Journals of the House of Lords  Car  I th Dec    "And that nothing be omitted on my part I must here take notice of the bill for pressing of soldiers now depending among you my Lords concerning which I here declare That in case it come so to me as it may not  infringe or diminish my prerogative I will pass it  "And further seeing there is a dispute raised I being little beholden to him whosoever at this time began it concerning the bounds of this ancient and undoubted prerogative to avoid further debate at this time I offer that the bill may pass with a  salvo jure  both for King and people leaving such debates to a time that may better bear it If this be not accepted the fault is not mine that this bill pass not but those that refuse so fair an offer To conclude I conjure you by all that is or can be dear to you or me that laying away all disputes you go on cheerfully and speedily for the reducing of Ireland"  The House of Commons hastily declared that the privileges of Parliament had been broken and desired a conference about them with the Lords  Journals of the House of Commons  Car  th Dec    That conference being held a declaratory protestation was entered in both Houses of Parliament and a humble remonstrance and petition by the Lords and Commons was presented to the  "King  Journals of the House of Lords vol iv p  declaring it their  ancient  and  undoubted right  that his Majesty  ought not  to take notice of any matter in agitation of either Houses of Parliament but by their informations or agreement and that his Majesty  ought not  to propound  any  condition to  any  bill in either House of Parliament or declare his approbation or dislike of the same before it be presented to his Majesty in due course of Parliament and that his Majesty  ought not  to conceive displeasure against any man for such opinions and propositions as he shall deliver and debate in Parliament and declaring that  all these privileges  had been lately  broken  to the  great sorrow and grievance  of his  most humble and  faithful subjects  in the speech which his Majesty made in Parliament  beseeching  his Majesty to  protect  them in these and all other their privileges and that his Majesty would be pleased to make known the name or names of the person or persons by whose misinformation and evil counsel his Majesty was induced to the same that so he or they may receive such condign punishment as shall appertain to justice in that behalf"  Such is the substance of that production of factious turbulence and effrontery to which a much injured Prince returned the following answer  "My Lords and Gentlemen  "In answer to your petition concerning Our speech to the two Houses of Parliament the th December  "  First  We do declare that we had no thought or intention of breaking the privileges of Parliament neither are we satisfied that our being informed  of any bill transmitted by the House of Commons to the House of Peers especially where our learned counsel are admitted by the Peers to speak in our behalf as they were in this case and therefore our directions necessary therein can be judged any breach of the privileges of Parliament  "And as for our taking notice thereof and desiring the inserting of a clause of saving all rights we neither did willingly or knowingly do any thing to the breach of the privileges of Parliament but what we did therein was in the great zeal we had and ever shall have to the suppressing the rebels in Ireland the quick dispatch of which bill contributed so much to the effecting thereof and it could not but have received great delay had it passed both Houses in a way whereunto we could not have given our royal assent  "Neither had we any intention to express any displeasure against any particular man for any opinions or propositions delivered by way of debate in either House for our intention was to express only a general dislike of any questions that should be raised especially at this time concerning our prerogative and the liberty of the subject such as this is being but a preamble which might be left out without prejudice to the claim and could not be approved by us without concluding our right  "As for the last demand that we should declare the persons that gave us information it is no great wonder that we should get information of the contents of the bill since they were published in print before we spoke of them yet though we should have gotten notice otherwise it is a thing much beneath us to name any that should give us information or counsel  it being that which we would not impose upon any person of honour  "Our conclusion is That we had not the least thought of breaking the privileges of Parliament but shall by our royal authority ever protect and uphold them and we expect that you will be as careful not to trench upon our just prerogative as we will be not to infringe your just privileges and liberties and then there will be little disagreement betwixt us hereafter in this point"  Journals of the House of Lords vol iv p  He to whom this does not appear a sufficient answer in every respect and who can still wish to copy the petition and remonstrance must have a cast of thinking so different from mine that it would be in vain for me to argue with him  Charles I instead of talking to his Parliament in the high and imperious tone of Queen Elizabeth had with the best intentions mildly endeavoured to  cooperate with them in bringing forward a matter of great importance in a manner consistent with the royal prerogative which it was his Majesty's bounden duty to maintain And as dispatch was required his Majesty fairly notified to his Parliament that they should not waste time in carrying through all the forms a bill to which he could not assent and told them with what limitation he could pass it Was not this a wise and a candid conduct And what are we to think of those who made an attack upon it  Pudet hoec opprobria  And perhaps the case of the EastIndia bill may be justly reckoned to fall under the exceptions which Mr  Hatsell  bred under the patronage of  Onslow  the Gamaliel of the House of Commons and therefore fully instructed in its privileges and abundantly zealous for them admits in his  Precedents  under the head  "KING  is not to take notice of business depending  "  His words are  "There are  however in the proceedings of the House of Commons exceptions to this rule necessarily arising out of their own forms and orders as in those cases where  the King is interested  as a party in any bill depending before the House either as Patron of a living Lord of the manor or soil  or in any other manner  Here as  it is the duty of his servants  to  acquaint  him with the  purport  of such bills and to  take care  that his property or  interest may be secured  or that he may have an adequate compensation for them it is usual for the Chancellor of the Exchequer or the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to acquaint the House either on presenting the petition or in the course of the bill that his Majesty having been informed of the purport of the said bill gives his consent as far as his Majesty's interest is concerned that the House may do therein as they shall think fit And this is no breach  of the privileges of the House of Commons as it is a proceeding  founded on the fundamental rules of natural justice  Hatsell's Precedents of Proceedings in the House of Commons p  "  I desire to know if the King was not deeply interested in the EastIndia bill both as it is transferred to certain Commissioners great and important chartered rights which if forfeited should have reverted to the Crown and been at his Majesty's disposal and as it created a new and formidable power civil and military independent of his Majesty And supposing his Majesty to have at the time such servants as were more attached to ministerial influence than to royal prerogative and did not acquaint his Majesty with the purport and tendency of the billwere none of the real friends of the constitution none of the King's faithful counsellors to warn him of the danger and if warned and convinced  was a dead silence to be kept and no disapprobation to be discovered  If it be urged that it would have been more constitutional to have left the matter to the royal negative I in the first place deny the proposition and in the next place I maintain that acting in that manner might have occasioned a more violent roar of faction if we can suppose the bill to have passed both Houses  A notion has been pretty generally entertained that the royal assent has been refused to no bill since the Revolution But this is so far from being true that part of the very Address to his Majesty which was carried in the House of Commons the other day is copied from a representation of that House to William III in bearing  "That the usage of Parliament in all times hath been that what bills have been agreed to by both Houses for the redress of grievances or other public good have when tendered  to the Throne obtained the royal assent and that there are very few instances in former reigns where such assent in such cases has not been given and those attended with great inconveniencies to the Crown of England"  And then  reflecting  "that since your Majesty's accession to the Crown several public bills made by advice of both Houses of Parliament have not obtained the royal assent and in particular a bill entitled  An Act touching free and impartial Proceedings in Parliament  "  And in conclusion  "humbly praying that for the future  you will be graciously pleased to hearken to the advice of your Parliament and not to the secret advice of particular persons who may have private interests of their own separate from the true interest of your Majesty and your people  Journals of the House of Commons January  "  Here then we have an instance of what an outcry may be raised when a  bill has been permitted to make its way through both Houses of Parliament and then is crushed by the ultimate stroke of the royal negative Then we see this part of the prerogative the exercise of which has been of late so warmly invited receives an indirect challenge in expressions which might have startled a timid Prince or a Prince who had experienced the dreadful effects of a storm of faction  What was the answer made to this representation by a Prince who had been but a few years before elected to the throne Did King William yield to the House of Commons in any degree Did he stoop to promise a different conduct in compliance with their wishes NoHe gave them a general constitutional declaration which any King might make at any time and did not say one word to the particular subject of the representation  "Gentlemen  "I am very sensible of the good affections you have expressed to me upon many occasions and of the zeal you have shewn for our common interest I shall make use of this opportunity to tell you that no Prince ever had a higher esteem for the constitution of the English government than myself and that I shall ever have a great regard to the advice of Parliaments I am persuaded that nothing can so much conduce to the happiness and welfare of this kingdom as an entire confidence between the King and people which I shall by all means endeavour to preserve And I assure you I shall look upon such persons to be my enemies who shall advise any thing that may lessen it  Journals of the House of Commons January  "  That our Monarchy received a shock at the Revolution cannot be denied But it was a shock of  political necessity  the reasons  of which  Blackstone  that our minds may be quiet wisely puts upon  "the solid footing of authority"    "For our ancestors having most indisputably a competent jurisdiction to decide this great and important question and having in fact decided it it is now become our duty at this distance of time to acquiesce in their determination  Book I chap    But we see that after the Revolution though the line of succession was changed the Crown retained its  prerogative  as to  Acts of Parliament  and exercised it with a bold resolution  A keen debate on King William's answer took place in the House of Commons which had in effect questioned his Majesty's  undoubted prerogative  in refusing his assent It was moved  "That an humble address be made to the King for a farther answer"  But there was principle and decency enough amongst them  to reject it In truth to dispute the King's free right of a negative upon any bill is tantamount to insisting that he is a cypher in the constitution And I admire the strong blunt speech of  Mr Brewer  "All agree that the King hath a negative voice to bills No body hath a greater reverence to Parliaments than myself but the bill rejected was liable to exceptions I gave my vote to make the Prince of Orange King but will never give my vote to unking him  Grey's Debates vol x p  "  Let Mr  Brewer  of be opposed to Mr  Baker  of and the constitutional palm  detur digniori  The purpose of this Letter is to recommend to the people of Scotland in their several counties boroughs corporations and public bodies of every kind to ADDRESS his Majesty upon this momentous crisis to express their sincere satisfaction that a bill for vesting the affairs of the  EastIndia Company in certain Commissionersa bill dangerous at once to the rights of the King and people has been rejected by his Majesty's hereditary counsellors the House of Lords assuring his Majesty of their firm attachment to his Royal Person and Government and of their support of such Ministers as his Majesty may be graciously pleased to chuse for the stable administration of public affairs at a time when stability is of most essential consequence humbly trusting that his Majesty's paternal care for the interests of his subjects and due regard to the constitutional prerogative of his Crown will prevent any infringement upon either  Addresses I know have but too often been prostituted That is no reason why they should never be presented I do not mean that either  influence  or  solicitation  should be used But if my countrymen in general are persuaded of the  dangerous tendency of the late EastIndia bill an honest expression of their sentiments upon its defeat is a tribute due to those who withstood it and may have weight in preventing a renewal of the attempt It was urged by its principal abettor that there had been no petitions against it except from the city of London and the borough of Chipping Wycombe Let numerous Addresses prove that time and not will was wanting And as in consequence of the scheme for establishing a new and formidable power having proved abortive there is a conflict of parties with respect to an administration let our most gracious Sovereign whose exalted worth and benignity are far above my panegyric have the comfort of knowing from his people themselves how they think and feel And let Scotland at the most interesting period since the Restoration assume the importance to which she is entitled  Let us as much as we possibly can divest ourselves of private considerations  more especially how particular persons of eminence may be affected one way or other Whatever may be the abilities whatever the good intentions of any of them whatever our expectations from their influence let us upon this awful occasion think only of  property  and the  constitution  For my own part I should claim no credit did I not flatter myself that I practise what I now presume to recommend I have mentioned former circumstances perhaps of too much egotism to show that I am no timeserver and at this moment friends to whom I am attached by affection gratitude and interest are zealous for the measure which I deem so alarming Let me add that a dismission of the Portland Administration will probably disappoint an object which I have most ardently at heart But holding an estate transmitted to me through my ancestors  by charters from a series of Kings the importance of a Charter and the prerogative of a King impress my mind with seriousness and with duty and while animated I hope as much as any man with genuine feelings of liberty I shall ever adhere to our excellent monarchy that venerable institution under which liberty is best enjoyed
