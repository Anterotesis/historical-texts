lines were written and the First Part of THE MAID OF ARRAGON finished though other avocations have prevented the publication till now This circumstance is mentioned to shew that they were prompted by the heart and not by the desire of imitating the Author of an admirable Novel which was addressed to a Father since that period  DEPRECATION  I ENTREAT the Reviewers to have compassion on me From the beginning of my literary warfare these unmerciful Wits have pursued me with the sharpest arrows of Criticism and I have had nothing to console me alasbut the approbation of the Public How shall I escape now when to all my other faults are added so many outrages in Geography With what triumph of critical sagacity will they say after the necessary strictures on the story thoughts and verses  "If our Author was determined to send her Pegasus into  Spain  in quest of adventures she ought to have consulted  Salmon  about the situation of its provinces She would there have found that  Arragon  is fifty miles from the sea and that the  Moors  could not possibly have debarked on its confines unless like fish to the  London  markets their fleet had arrived by landcarriage With equal facility the troops of the King of  Leon  are brought across  Old Castile  to  Saragossa  in about thirty hoursanother miracle which was doubtless accomplished by the interposition of a friendly necromancer who furnished the army with wings in exchange for some chaste damsel or beautifull princess Had this LadyWriter's reading extended to a  translation  of the Iliad she would have found no examples of such liberties there  Homer  gives an exact map of the countries he carries us through and from  Ithaca  to  Troy  not a village or river is misplaced"  True but  Homer  I name him as a modern Painter mentions a  Correggio  and a  Raphael    Homer  united the Historian with the PoetI deal entirely in fiction It was enough for me that  Spain  through a succession of ages had been subject to the ravages of  Africa  and that during this period sovereigns had been robbed of their crowns and been obliged to resign their sceptres to their swarthy conquerors The relation of the particular events of these remote times the Historic Muse has generally left to her creative Sister who never fails to profit by their obscurity in relating them to the world in her own manner the geography of the heart and the history of the passions are the only realities to which she attends If in describing  these  I shall be found deviating from the laws of Truth and Nature I shall have failed in my intention but I protest if the  cacoethes scribendi  should continue on me or if I should ever wander again into the regions of Romance I shall treat oceans and provinces with as little ceremony as rivulets and meadows I will avail myself of the established privileges and raise mountains seas or kingdoms in any part of the habitable globe that hits my fancy or if it strikes me build a temple to Dullnessin the chamber of a Reviewer  THE MAID OF ARRAGON  OH ye whose sympathetic hearts are form'd  To woe responsive and whose trem'lous nerves  Vibrate to Sorrow's mournful airsattend  Not you ye gay not you ye vacant crouds  Who labour through the pleasures of the world  Nor feel existence when they cease t'impel  I call not youfor oh your callous bosoms  Fell Dissipation steels and robs your minds  Of the sweet energies bestow'd by Heaven  But come ye few who love the lonely hour  Who know the sense refin'd the charming agony  Which Pity gives the hallow'd hearts she fills  To you I call oh come and trace with me  Whilst glitt'ring Hesperus holds high his torch  The mazy windings of yon solemn wood  Behold the lawn which opens on the left  With crocus border'd aromatic thyme  And ev'ry fragrant shrub that tempts the bee  Down from the liquid air to bathe in sweets  The op'ning wicket of that humble cot  By slow degrees moves gently on its hinge  And now with cautious tread the soft OSMIDA  Looking  a blessing on her slumb'ring Sire  The threshold quits when from his short repose  Aged ALMANZOR startsWhere art thou Child  Where is my darling Oh return OSMIDA  Why wilt thou wander in Night's chilly air  And trust thy bosom to its piercing dews  Return my Child th' unpitying winds will shake  Thy tender frame  The night is calm my Father  Scarcely a zephyr moves the restless aspin  And the clear moon with soft inviting beam  Looks through the foliage of the lofty pines  A moment let me breathe the balmy air  Confin'd beneath the cottage roof by fear  And more confin'd by duteous cares for thee  All day I live immur'd Then let me now  Taste Nature's blessingsexercise and air  Heaven guard my Child But soon return OSMIDA  And downy sleep shake slumbers on thy pillow  OSMIDA quits the cot and bends her steps  Towards the margin of a neighb'ring lake  But not its lucid bosom tempts her steps  Nor moon inviting through the lofty pines  Nor balmy air nor healthful exercise  Ah noit is to breathe her bosom'd anguish  Where Grief though audible wastes her sad voice  In ambient airnot torturing the ear  Of the rever'd ALMANZOR Sire belov'd  Bending to earth with eyes that penetrate  The glowing canopy of heaven in sounds  More mournful than the widow'd stockdove's plaints  Tender as youthful mother's lulling song  She thus address'd Omnipotence divine  Oh Thou in whose eternal boundless sight  The woes or happiness that overpower  The mind of finite man seem but as drops  That in the vast abyss unite their littleness  To form one mighty wholeto Thee I pray  Not for myself I pray but for my Father  For him whose careworn heart drooping oppress'd  And torn with barbed griefs seems torn from thee  His soul her wonted confidence forsakes  He falls from thee he leans not on the rock  The sacred rock by which alone he stands  And quitting sinks to measureless despair  Oh Thou accept my humble heart for his  Hear hear ALMANZOR in OSMIDA's voice  'Tis he implores Bless comfort heal his griefs  And to thyself attach his sorrowtempted heart  Next for my  Country  Heav'n oh hear my pray'r  Behold her struggles with a pitying eye  Drive from thy templegates the mocking infidel  Restore thy altars Send  The pious Virgin's voice with terror choak'd  Unfinish'd left her pray'r Forth from the shade  Of the surrounding thicket rush'd a Knight  In shining armour clad borne on a steed  Who seem'd to scorn the earth his light heel pass'd  As though  his  element had been the air  Swift as the breath of fierce Euroclydon  He bore his master to the spangled lake  Whose borders by OSMIDA's knee still press'd  In thousand glowing colours bloom'd around her  In thousand scents perfum'd the tranquil air  Light vaulting on the ground the Knight approach'd  And in such courteous phrase address'd the Maid  That half her terrors ended with his words  Leave me Sir Knight with firmness she reply'd  And as she spoke her voice though sweet express'd  A custom to command Leave me Sir Knight  This solitude is to Misfortune sacred  None ever tread these unfrequented wilds  But those to whom the door of sweet Society  And Friendship's holy gate are shut forever  And can the social door and Friendship's gate  To thee oppose their brazen locks O Heaven  The  peopled  world thy angels have sorsook  And here in deserts dwellin human form  But in celestial beauty Tell me Virgin  For sure the awe with which thy eye inspires  Bespeaks thy vestal statetell me fair Maid  What ills what sore affliction  thee  have driven  To seek in these sequester'd shades felicity  By man refus'd  My sorrows gentle Knight  I dare not whisper to the speechless air  Still less intrust them to a stranger's ear  Yet from your courtesy I must demand  My  solitude  again and as you hope  For blessing from the Pow'r who hears my voice  Swear never to divulge that in these glades  A Maid you foundby outward beauty grac'd  But whose sad heart Sorrow hath call'd her own  And stern Affliction long enroll'd a sister  The Stranger paus'd and then as if to win  Her confidence and woo her from reserve  By frank example thus the Nymph address'd  To  whom  should I reveal this bless'd abode  Whose  feet conduct to violate your haunts  I  who like you by keen misfortunes press'd  Seek shelter from the world and even now  Forsake my native skies quit  Gallia  's shores  Her purple vineyards leave her fertile meads  Her ever blooming fieldsall these I quit  For these to wretched hearts bloom swell and fertilise in vain  Unhappy Youth breath'd forth the sad OSMIDA  And is Affliction's appetite so vast  That daily victims can't allay her rage  But gentle Knight where will your journey end  What Porter waits to hear your bugle sound  And ope the gates with welcome in his face  To greet his honour'd Lord's expected guest  Alas sweet Maid no hospitable gate  DE COURCI seeks  no  welcome waits his steps  To Eastern climes I bend my weary course    Jerusalem  the home which ends my progress  There let me bear  your  woes Instruct me Lady  That at the Holy Sepulchre your name  May animate my pray'rs that there your griefs  May sanctify'd ascend the porch of heav'n  And in their stead soft peace and blooming joy  Return into your breast That duty pass'd  My sword shall lend its vigour to the cause  The sacred cause which arms our Christian legions  And drains our cities of their val'rous Knights  OSMIDA's eye beaming with newborn hope  And gratitude awak'd shot forth her thoughts  Ere from her vermeil lips these accents stole  In breath more fragrant than an Eastern morn  Wilt  thou remember me at  Zion  's gate  And shall  my  sorrows from the holy cave  In which the Saviour drew his  second  breath  Ascend to the Almighty's throneAgain  She stopp'd and check'd her growing frankness  The Stranger saw instinctive prudence rise  And fear'd to give the virtue time to act  Yes he rejoin'd with zeal more pure and ardent  Than converts feel who at the holy altar  Bewail a life of curst idolatry  Will I your sorrows pour in that bless'd spot  Where Sorrow surely cannot plead in vain  Struck with the piety which deck'd his words  Yet doubting still the timid trusting Virgin  In silence with herself thus cogitates  A  Christian  Knight he is and with his life  Now hast'ning to support the Christian cause  Oceans and continents will soon divide us  Why then the knowledge of my woes withhold  When bless'd Benevolence demands the tale  Then turning to the Stranger meekly said  Such kind persuasion confidence demands  Yet patience will you need whilst I relate  Events so  strong  they fitter would become  A manly tongue Of battles I must speak  Of falling kingdoms and victorious arms  These strains accord not with a female voice  Yet will I strive to nerve my thoughts and language  And raise my fancy to the lofty theme  But not alone of war shall I discourse  Of meeting armies or contending states  Here on this sloping bank Sir Knight repose  And I a talefor Pitywill unfold  Were Pity's tears innum'rous as the sands  The Knight with token of respect obey'd  OSMIDA with the grace of sweet reserve  At gentle distance near the mossgrown roots  Of an expanding beech a Woodnymph seem'd  A woodland goddess and her grassy seat  Chaste  Dian  's rural throne Grave Recollection  On her sweet features spread an air compos'd  Whilst in Night's zenith'midst her radiant court  The crystal Moon seem'd fix'd in still attention  The silent waters of the lake more silent flow'd  The Zephyrs drawing close their silken wings  In soft subjection held the rustling branches  The wheeling bat far off her circles draws  Whilst the Night's sweet musician still'd her song  To learn a sadder notefrom fair OSMIDA  All thus in silence wrapt the thoughtful Maid  With tone sedate begins the promis'd tale  This happy climethis  Arragonian  realm  Had late a Monarch whom her Sons rever'd  As  King  rever'd him as a  Father  lov'd  He lov'd his People knew no care but theirs  And the fond blessings which they gave his name  Blunted the thorns a diadem conceals  Peace in this happy reign her throne establish'd  And brought her proper blessings in her train  Fair Commerce wav'd her pennons in our ports  The fertile plough subdu'd our sterile fields  Our granaries like those of  Egypt  drew  From neighb'ring countries riches and renown  The cottage Peasant round his wellfill'd board  Saw thankful faces and contented hearts  No iron taxes grip'd his pallid frame  Nor tore the morsel from his children's mouths  Blithe as the morn he rose to healthful labour  And hail'd with joy th'approach of festive eve  Such once the favour'd lot of envied  Arragon  Her fame her riches spreading to the East  Entic'd the Moors from their polluted home  Sudden their prows invade our peaceful seas  Sudden the bold Barbarians croud our shores  Defenceless hamlets turn unnatural beacons  And blaze the woefraught tidings through the land  Like a nighttorrent fierce uncheck'd they come  With devastation at their coursers heels  Death rapine ruin mark their dreadful progress  And reach the bulwarks of the royal city  Deep consternation spreads through ev'ry street  Th'affrighted virgins to the temples run  The mother grasps her child and shrieking flies  Whilst husbands fathers brothers all in arms  Chide the dear mourners who retard their speed  Snatch last adieus and rush upon the walls  But from the walls what image strikes the view  A turban'd phalanx on the hill appear'd  Rapid descending to the plain below  Upon the right advanc'd a mighty column  Of armed chariots form'dso thickly set  With scythes and swords and barbed spears each seem'd  A steely porcupine whose burnish'd quills  Catching the rays of the meridian sun  Gleam'd back upon the town refulgent horror  Upon the left hand mov'd the tawny marksmen  Whose ebon bows and quivers richly stor'd  They sung were given by Deathunerring archer  The dreadful pomp descended to the plain  Fix'd their bold standards and entrenchments form'd  Whilst our scar'd citizens observ'd their works  Like trembling birds who looking from their nests  Upon the charming cockatrice behold  Inevitable fate But black despair  That first enerv'd next lent their courage fury  Lead us they cry'dlead to the  Moorish  camp  What are their numbers  single  as they come  With us our parents children lovers laws  Religion libertyall join the battle  Brace our firm arms and give ten thousand points  Ten thousand deaths to ev'ry Christian sword  This holy rage like sparks electric flew  From man to man Each urg'd his valiant friend  To save their city matrons daughters wives  As if on  each  their preservation hung  Scarce could the pious King restrain their ardor  So sure they seem'd of conquest and revenge  But he who knew that from th'almighty arm  Their foes' destruction only could proceed  The gates of every temple open threw  And with humiliation deep repair'd  Before the sacred altar of our God  The soldiers citizens the nobles croud  And ev'ry holy roof grew instant vocal  Prostrate and weeping they implor'd the High  For  Gideon  's sword and mighty  Joshua  's arm  "Shield us" they cry'd"Oh save thy faithful people  Nor give us to the mockers for a scorn  Omnipotence preserve us from the yoke  The foe prepares for our devoted necks  Humble the  boasters  who repose their strength  Not on  thy  arm but in their own frail numbers  To Thee O God of Battles we appeal  Hear hear our voice"When lo from Heaven's bright concave  In gracious intimation that their prayers  Wafted by guardian spirits reach'd the throne  A mighty peal of thunder rapt their ears  And purple lightnings quiver in the sky  The  Arragons  with hopes thus sanctified  Rush'd from the temples like impetuous flames  Or like fierce tigers who their destin'd prey  At distance see and pant and foam and rage  With pride of certain conquest But their prince  Strove this incautious ardor to restrain  Allbounteous Heav'n he cry'd by  means  not  miracles  Decides the fate of armies and of kings  Let prudent foresight then direct your aims  Lest rashness blights the harvest of your courage  The haughty  Moors  contemptuous of our strength  Doubtless expect to see our opening gates  Receive them masters at the trumpet's signal  To aid their blindness we will offers make  Of terms too humble for a state in freedom  And yet too high for Conqu'rors to accept  Then in the night's meridian when no star  With telltale beams upon our polish'd mail  Shall shew us to the watchful centinel  Then will we rouse the lion from his den  And prove our courage worthy of our cause  The humming notes of growing apprchation  Like distant thunder gaining on the ear  Broke forth at once into applausive shouts  Live live the King reechoed ev'ry mouth  O guard my People said the hearttouch'd King  The heralds sent and their misleading terms  To blind with fears unfelt the  Moorish  camp  All now prepare for the wish'd hour of onset  The sounding anvils beat their clanging music  Peacerusted swords regain their edge and polish  The nervous archer tries his idle bow  And gives new plumage to his missile darts  The matrons virgins catch the martial fire  These  songs prepare  these  rosy garlands twine  To greet on their return the conqu'ring heroes  Yet 'mongst the virgins  one  sad heart was found  'Twas in the bosom of the royal Princess  Her vows her plighted troth had long been given  To young MONTENOS Duke  Medina  's Heir  He only he could melt her icy breast  None could so well deserve an untouch'd heart  His mind more noble than his princely birth  Lent glory to his name matchless his form  As poets feign celestial Virtue wears  When visible to man Oh wonder not  The Princess lov'd with strength no common flame  Could have inspir'd Her soul was full of love  She liv'd she breath'd she thought but for MONTENOS  Ten thousand terrors now besieg'd her soul  Ten thousand  nothings  which her fancy drest  In colour substance circumstance and form  Yet from her lover 'twas her care to hide  The tender weakness which her heart confest  Shall  I  she cry'd a mighty kingdom's heir  Shew terrors that the humbler maids despise  My Country rocks upon a precipice  Go then MONTENOS prop her falling state  Repel th'invader tread on Slav'ry's neck  And 'mongst her dear preservers be thou  Chief  The shades of eve advance and from the camp  The subtle messengers returnreturn  With insult loaded and contemptuous threats  No less the  Moors  demand than general vassalage  That  conquer'd  Arragonso proud their style  Should yield them homage and perpetual tribute  A  day  they grant us to resolve on slavery  To turn apostates and revolt from Heaven  Or see our towers extended in the dust  No terms or messengers they will receive  But open'd gates and crescents on our spires  The  answer  they expect This lofty menace  Less with surprise than anger was receiv'd  It spoke the spirit of the fierce invaders  Some hourstremendous pause were yet to pass  Between this period and that meant for action  Gloomy suspence sat brooding o'er the army  And  hid  not  damp'd  the ardor of their courage  All selfcollected seem'd retir'd within  And the full mind had render'd language mute  At this grand moment when no thought of aid  Of human aid had glanc'd across the soul  In from the Western gatelike bees returning  From their diurnal circuitrush'd amain  Ten thousand sons of war At this bless'd sight  Such transport seiz'd the citizens and troops  It seem'd triumphant holiday and joy  Would even in frolic sportso sudden the effect  To  Leon  's King we ow'd this grateful succour  He heard the  Moors  were hov'ring on our coasts  And as a  Christian  king the cause adopted  But now the streets choak'd up with armed men  Pour back their warriors through the Western portal  There in the marshy vale that to the North  Extends its rich campaign the army grew  In form Pardon if I a simple Maid  Cannot relate Sir Knight in artful terms  How  in  what order  grew I have not skill  To use the phrases chance hath giv'n mine earâ–ª  Were I to speak of  flank  and  rear  and  van  You'd find my tongue to wild confusion lead  Learn then but this the King the centre kept  MONTENOS stately pine led on the front  The Stranger  bow'd  reply in mute respect  OSMIDA gently pausing thus resum'd  The tender Twilight which till now had look'd  With timid eye upon the martial plain  Withdrew her beam to follow distant day  Night oft invok'd advanc'd her ebon standard  To which all Nature yields wellpleas'd obeisance  But iron War scornful of Nature's laws  Makes Rest his captive and the ear of Silence  Frequent invades whilst from the throne of Night  CoÃ«val pow'r she rules the drowsy world  So  now  through  Arragonia  's streets his march  Unmeasur'd by the drum's imperious notes  In aweful pomp he takes Balconies crouded  Show'r down their blessings as the soldiers pass  Whilst thousand voices spend themselves in pray'r  And thousand ardent eyes appeal to Heaven  At length arriv'd towards the Eastern towers  The army made a momentary halt  When lo the holy Prelate with a train  Of cloister'd saints barefooted rob'd in white  And holding each a crucifix advanc'd  Ye  more  than warriors said the Man of God  Ye  Christian  soldiers think  whose  sword you bear  The  barb'rous  nations of the earth whose ears  Were never blest with sounds of Gospel Truths  Have yet atchiev'd such wondrous deeds in arms  As will convey their names with glory deck'd  To the remotest age in Time's dark womb  A thousand nations have for  freedom  fought  A thousand others for  revenge  have arm'd  And giv'n destruction to th'offending foe  To save their matrons from the brutal rape  Their daughters from Pollution's arms have sent  Victorious myriads to th'imbattled field  All these  you  fight for but you fight for MORE  You fight for CHRIST See here behold your Saviour  Torn on the racking cross These wounds for  you  Were given This bloodthis sacred blood for  you  Gush'd forth and mingled with corruption Go then  Bleed agonize and  die  for Him Rapt Seraphims  Are now preparing your celestial crowns  Go and  atchieve  them Choirs of holy angels  Now tune their golden harps and hymns prepare  To greet ye  conqu'rors  in the gates of Heaven  Go blessed soldiersGo  The Father ceas'd  From ev'ry mouth burst forthas if  one  soul  One  voice through all the army reign'd"We go"  Inspir'd thus by the Priest's heroic charge  Each seem'd to press to be the  earliest  victim  Their souls on fire were eager to depart  The earthly sphere and seise on their immortal crowns  Thus rapt the soldiers pass and through the gates  Like mists exhaling from the earth's moist bosom  Spread on the surface of the hostile plain  The gates shut close their wideextended jaws  Shut close for ever on the valiant youths  Whose feet now leave themto return no more  But they by  other  hopes than life inspir'd  March on whilst Night her curtain closer draws  To hide their progress from the watchful foe  In vain the night her sable curtain draws  And bids the stars keep hoodwink'd in their course  For faithless Echo to the  Moorish  guard  Betray'd the distant sound of pacing steps  From guard to guard the hasty signals fly  And shoot like meteors through the dark expanse  The Infidels alarm'd seem all in motion  Whilst the faint quiv'ring lights that lately serv'd  To guide the hunters in their dang'rous chace  Now blaze and multiply till all the camp  A vast illumination seems that gilds  With dreadful splendor the surrounding gloom  Our troops undaunted quicken as they tread  And hasty marching grows to eager speed  To arms to arms the scar'd besiegers cry  Your arms are here th'advancing foe replies  Thirsting to drench their swords in  Moorish  blood  Silence no longer useful now gives way  To all the dreadful din that battle loves  The haughty trumpet and the vig'rous drum  With the shrill fife's acuter voice accord  To summon valour in the fearfull'st heart  The  Moors  rush forth impetuous and confus'd  No orders thought on and no orders heard  Some to the trench some to the chariots fly  To buckle to the shafts the frighted horses  The restive steeds reject th'accustom'd yoke  Dash their fierce leaders wildly to the earth  Then plunging bound along the beamy plain  Our troops had gain'd the ditch and to the beards  Of the besiegersnow  besieg'd  advanc'd  Ere the first panic left their courage calm  The battlo's fury in an instant spreads  And all its horrors rage mature at once  The bows are useless throat to throat they fight  Foes mix with foes ranks press on hostile ranks  Till each are lost and form one dreadful whole  Death never triumph'd as he triumph'd now  With  hasty  victims never was so gorg'd  He who is killing by another's slain  And  he  in finishing his blow partakes  The fate he gives Scarce had the armies join'd  Ere thousand souls had pass'd th'eternal bourn  On ev'ry side bulwarks of dead appear  Torrents of reeking gore The blood of  Moors  And  Christians  forms one common flood and rolls  Its heavy tide in stagnant streams along  Say Stranger hast thou seen the warlike sports  Yearly presented in our vast Steccado  Superior to the rest the Bullfight claims  Glorious preeminence Forth from their dens  The bellowing monsters rush and the earth rings  Beneath their haughty hooss The ireful foam  Runs from their churning jaws their burnish'd horns  Now rase the earth now proudly tost in air  Challenge the waiting warriors to the combat  The waiting warriors ardent for the sign  Dart on their foes the lordly beasts evade  The wellaim'd spear and clad in native might  Scorn the bright corslet and the nodding helm  Onward they rushwhilst deathful fury bursts  In livid sparkles from their bloodred eyes  They gore the gen'rous steeds their riders crush  Or send them clashing through the dusty air  Throughout the concave sound the eager plaudits  And boist'rous admiration speaks the joy  At length the fav'rite bullhe whom the keepers  For fire and strength superior to the rest  Had long mark'd out is loos'd upon the plain  All marvels cease the instant he appears  And what seem'd wondrous but a moment since  Has now no tongue to speak the mighty act  So much beyond all thought  his  deeds excell  The glorious devastation of his peers  Just so MONTENOS shone among the heroes  Whose bitter chastisement the  Moors  endured  Where'er he mov'd destruction mark'd his progress  And death seem'd couchant on his pond'rous axe  The Night so dreadful lengthen'd out her hours  As though she staid to view the battle's conflict  Or hide its horrors from the springing day  At length the glowing portals of the East  Disclos'd the Mornin splendor she arose  But as if griefstruck at the murd'rous scene  Her face in humid clouds she instant wrapt  And seem'd to weep in drops of sacred pity  Yet Conquest ceas'd not with her vig'rous arm  To plant her banners o'er the reeking field  For  us  her banners wav'dfor  us  she triumph'd  And Vict'ry sung loud IÃ¶'s for the Christians  The  Moor  now seeing that his scatter'd host  Had their chief leaders losttheir numbers wasted  Like sifted corn before the driving tempest  For quarter calls His troops upon their knees  Yield up their arms and Mahomet invoke  To screen his worshipers from dreaded vengeance  But Christian soldiers war not for revenge  Nor know to trample on a  vanquish'd  foe  Their homage is accepted and their chiefs  With low'ring fronts and hearts by malice gnaw'd  Follow the victors in their march triumphant  Strait to the citygates they bend their course  Where from the walls the holy priests had watch'd  The issue of the fight There too the Princess  In horrors exquisite had pass'd the night  Judge then her rapture her exalted joy  When she beheld on their victorious march  Betroth'd MONTENOS and her royal Sire  Forth to the plainheedless of form she rush'd  Her Virgins follow'd and the rev'rend Priests  Led by the holy Bishop form'd her train  The dayas if she bore an  active  part  In all th'events her teeming hours brought forth  Chac'd the dark clouds unveil'd her radiant face  And gave new glories to the scene she view'd  The King approach'dthe Princess at his feet  Ador'd the mighty arm which thus restor'd him  Loaded with laurels from the deathful field  Her valiant Lover leading in his hand  The  Moorish  Prince with eager pace advanc'd  To claim  his  share of her enraptur'd welcome  Receive he cry'd a conquest which your eyes  And not my sword atchiev'd Inspir'd by you  Who  could resist my arm This princely foe  Who wonders acted and whose arm deserv'd  A  righteous  cause by you bright maid subdu'd  Your victim I present The sullen Prince  Scarce deign'd to lift his eye when with a grace  No fancy can pourtray the gallant youth  Made to his mistress this heroic gift  Oh fatal present gift replete with woes  Why did not heaven in its mercy send  Its winged shafts and at that instant strike  The royal Maid where fix'd with joy she stood  Then had her breast untorn with throbbing anguish  Sunk peacefullyalas where roves my tongue  Let me in order lead you to the sequel  It needless were my story to prolong  In painting scenes your fancy will supply  The joyful entry and triumphant feasts  Devout processions and heroic sports  All these are fruitful themes and would demand  A time the waning night denies In brief  The captive Prince a mighty ransom offer'd  With league of amity and lasting peace  The terms accepted gallies were dispatch'd  To bring the barter'd price of his redemption  Mean while he join'd the games and seem'd to lose  His barb'rous roughness in the toils of pleasure  Alas in other toils his mind was caught  The Princess seem'd too lovely to ZORADOR  Whose sensual soul she touch'd with fiercest passion  He dared to speak of love and to herself  Vaunt his bold hopes whilst he beheld approach  The day which was to join in nuptial bands  The Royal Maiden and her lov'd MONTENOS  The marriage sports already were prepar'd  And yet the  Moor  audacious talk'd of love  Repuls'd with just disdain he to the King  His lovesick tale with sullen port address'd  I am not used he cried to offer crowns  And have them spurn'd like  vulgar  lovers' toys  Give me your Daughter I'll give  her  a throne  Dominions she shall have to which your  Arragon  With all its boasted fields and blushing vineyards  Seems but a fertile  spot  so vast the country  Whose sceptre I command The King's firm answer  Shew'd the proud Infidel his suit was vain  And that a  Christian  Princess to a subject  More fitly would be match'd than with the Monarch  Of widestretch'd continentswhose wretched Sons  Were taught to scorn the doctrines of a CHRIST  ZORADOR's fury to such transports grew  At this destruction of his hopes he seem'd  No longer manHis eyeballs glar'd with madness  His foamy ragelike a tempestuous sea  Lashing her shores in vainspar'd not himself  His beard in frightful fragments strew'd the floor  Whilst his inflated bosom rack'd within  Without resounded from his barb'rous blows  He curs'd blasphem'd and wept his strength exhausted  Left him at length as though a wakeful sleep  Had seis'd his faculties and numb'd the fire  Which fill'd his torrid veins His slaves who oft  Beheld their lord a victim to himself  Bore to his couch the prostrate harmless tyrant  And there with trem'lous lutes and vocal harmony  In sweet enchantment woke him from his trance  His haughty soul that scorns all other laws  Will yield to music all her boist'rous passions  Hang on each strain melt at each magic note  And transient virtues catch from trilling airs  Compos'd at length or masking what he felt  Again ZORADOR sought the pensive King  Pardon he cry'd Oh Prince a wretch undone  Forgive the frenzy of a heart unsteel'd  By disappointment's shocks Nurs'd by prosperity  By fortune follow'd I had learntfond man  That fate that earth that heaven for me combin'd  And from misfortune hallow'd my encircled head  Your powerful arms O King of  Arragon  First taught ZORADOR that he was a  man  And now your Daughter's still more powerful eyes  Have taught ZORADOR that he is a  slave  Master and tyrant of a thousand beauties  Who court my passions live for my delight  I breath'd unknowing that I had a heart  Till cruel love wrapt in Despair's wild torments  Gave all its nerves a sense of curst existence  I lovewith agonywith madness love  Oh spare me then the horror of a sight  My fiery brain splits but to think on Save  Father of her whose charms thus abject make me  Save from the tortures of her marriage rites  The heart which burns and wastes with hopeless ardors  The ling'ring moon has number'd all the hours  That I allotted for my fleet's return  Soon as the eastern wind invades their canvass  The bellying sails will whiten all your channel  And their red streamers blush along your shores  My ransom paid I quit these hostile walls  Where my lost peace will stay enchain'd for ever  Then whilst I bear my woes to distant seas  Then may the spousals be triumphant sung  And not one wretch remain to curse the sound  Here ceas'd ZORADOR whilst the melting King  Unable to withstand a claim  so  urg'd  Granted his royal suitor all he ask'd  The Moor impress'd with thankfulness retir'd  And the good Monarch gave  Medina  's Heir  Command to curb his warm impetuous wishes  Until his rival sought his native skies  The shifting winds soon wafted to our ports  The  Moorish  squadron To the capital  The fleeter camels bore the various treasures  Meant for redemption of their captive Prince  Stuffs ingots ivory form'd their precious burden  Carpets of  Persia  hangings wrought with gold  Muscovian  sables scarves enrich'd with pearl  Silk robes by  Grecian  damsels taught to glow  In flowers of vivid tints and buds so prompt  They seem'd to blow beneath the gazer's eye  Sabres with glitt'ring hilts of curious art  And scymeters whose sheaths di'monds illum'd  And sanguine rubies dy'd all these were borne  In pompous march through  Saragossa  's streets  Whilst haughty coursers from  Arabia  's hills  Champing gold bits adorn'd with sumptuous housings  Or bearing Turkish tents of gaudy drapery  Shut from the wonderloving croud the long procession  And now approach'd the joyful wish'dfor morn  Whose breath upon our happy plains the  Moors  Were doom'd to leave ZORADOR with such port  As disappointment gives to tumid spirits  Made to the King and Princess his adieus  He left the city with a train of slaves  Shedding profusely as they pass'd along  Rich showers of gold upon the gaping rabble  Whose venal voice pierc'd Heaven with "Live ZORADOR  Soon as the tidings of the  Moors'  departure  Our speedy couriers brought the word was given  To make all ready for the royal marriage  Raptur'd MONTENOS madd'ning with his bliss  Could scarce support the intermediate hours  That led with lagging steps the nuptial morn  The nuptial Morn arriv'drous'd from her slumbers  By the shrill voice of silver clarions join'd  By the soft hautboy the seducive lute  And sweeter pipe of choral maids symphonious  Forth from the palace to the church through streets  With carpets laid and myrtle garlands hung  The glad procession led its length'ning train  The King beneath his canopy of state  Preceded by his guards first object mov'd  Next to his suite the Princess blushing follow'd  Her train upheld by twenty noble maids  Whose beauty in their snowy robes seem'd chastity  Incarnate Next at distanceas of rank  That yet allow'd not of a royal state  MONTENOS walk'd succeeded by the court  The King had almost reach'd the holy portals  When from the croud a youth advanc'd who caught  Each wond'ring eye His face a maskdesign'd  For youthful beauty hid His airy form  Seem'd worthy such a face His habit tissue  Emboss'd with purple studs His flowing hair  With knots of pearl was ty'd and on his head  A garland bloom'd An iv'ry flute he held  Through which he breath'd such melting touching strains  That Harmony herself had staid to listen  As he approach'd the soldiers clear'd his way  Till in the front before the guards he stood  The Princess came whilst he with rev'rence low  And softer breathings seem'd to great her presence  She pass'd the Bridegroom camein quicker notes  He bad his music flow and forward stepping  Offer'd with courteous air the tuneful pipe  MONTENOS smiling stretch'd his hand whenhorror  His breast receiv'd the flute which hid a poniard  A second blow ere thought could be recall'd  The third the murd'rer on himself bestow'd  And welt'ring dropt into the arms of Death  Astonishment usurp'd each vital faculty  And rooted all who saw the bloody deed  The Bridegroom sinking on th'assassin's corps  Rous'd from their trance his horrorstruck attendants  Whilst the chill sounds of Death Montenos Murder  Fled to the wretched Maidalmost a wife  Not daring to demand the cause her pulse  Stopt by congealing fear forbore its office  And a kind stupor hid her from her woes  Back to the palace now the dying Bridegroom  By Knights in hymeneal robes was borne  Whilst others dragg'd his murd'rer's mangled corps  To search for motives to the cruel deed  His mask unclasp'd disclos'd a wellknown face  A mute he was and in ZORADOR's train  A fiendlike scroll conceal'd within his vest  Develop'd all the murd'rous hellborn project  These were its words "'Tis not the slave but  I  Who give the blow  Vengeance  if not my  love  Shall be appeas'd Learn King of  Arragon  Learn both to know and dread the scorn'd ZORADOR"  Such were the lines which bore the stamp of fate  The lovely victim of the  Moor  's revenge  Breath'd not a word but strain'd his beamless eye  To find the object that his heart's last pulse  Ador'dnot seeing her they seem'd to shut  All others outand Death with hasty seal  Clos'd their dim lids in everlasting sleep  Here paus'd the Virgin as immers'd in thought  The story fraught with woe had cast a shade  Of deeper sorrow o'er her pensive brow  Her lab'ring bosom sent forth heavy sighs  And her sad mind seem'd lost in one idea  The Knight who eager grew to know the tale  She promis'd of  herself  presum'd at length  To bring her recollection to the point  At which her rosy lips their portal clos'd  And ceas'd to charm him with their touching accents  I will not Stranger said the fair narrator  Tax your attention with events unneedful  The Court's distress the sorrow of the King  The Bride's th'unwedded Bride's forlorn distraction  Long tedious months led round their joyless suns  Ere comfort beam'd upon her widow'd heart  Nor  then  till at the tomb of her lost Lord  Her solemn vows she made never to hear  A lover's soothing tale but in virginity  Perpetual wait the hour that should unite  Her faithful spirit with her murder'd Lord's  This duty paid a dawn like that of peace  By soft degrees illum'd the mourner's mind  The Court prompt in expedients to divest  Misfortune of her stings ransack'd all pleasures  Invented fresh delights new joys invok'd  For their sweet antidotes to pois'nous grief  Thus had two years their slowrevolving hours  Brought to the great account when from the east  A dark portentous cloud lab'ring with ills  Pregnant with thousand woes obscur'd th'horizon  ZORADORhe whose soul from inmost hell  Was sent to scourge the earthnot glutted yet  With all the horrid joys that wait on vengeance  Not yet forgiving our triumphant arms  Which shear'd the laurels his whole life had reap'd  Again came pouring like a mighty deluge  To overwhelm the land in lasting ruin  He cameWhy should I lengthen out my tale  Our nation's force oppos'd to the  Moor  's army  Was kindling torches to obscure the sun  Again we saw them hover on the hill  Again we sawlike faminebringing locusts  Their hosts descend and spread upon the plain  No parly as at first they would allow  Their batt'ringrams the messengers they us'd  Arrows and catapults their  killing  words  A dreadful day our troops sustain'd the siege  And fill'd the breaches with their slaughter'd foes  At length a billet on a javelin's point  The ramparts pass'd denouncing rape and sackage  If stubbornly our citizens delay'd  To own ZORADOR conqueror and king  The threat effected all the  Moor  had hop'd  And  Arragon  's grey Monarch was abandon'd  By those whose rights he'd guarded with his blood  By those his smiles had cherish'd and his honours grac'd  The throneless Sov'reign when he saw his gates  Open their faithless jaws t'admit the foe  Rush'd in distraction to his Daughter's chamber  Fly let us instant fly he gasping said  The  Moors  have vanquish'd and my Child's a slave  Their standards now insult our conquer'd streets  And curst ZORADOR will not long delay  Within my palace walls t'assert his rights  Come then my Daughter lest dishonour find thee  And kill they parent with a thousand deaths  The Princess whom affliction had subdu'd  And taught a firmness stranger to her years  Grasp'd her lov'd Father's handLead me she cry'd  Where Providence ordains my duteous steps  Shall ever follow yours soften your path  And chear to life's last sigh your rugged journey  A golden casket as she spoke she seiz'd  That held till now a hoarded useless treasure  And through the galleries with breathless haste  And step precipitate follow'd the King  Unknowing to what corner of the earth  To point their feet or whom they should intrust  With their advent'rous flight A faithful Lord  In this sad exigence with cordial words  The royal fugitives thus met and cheer'd  "O Sire from  Arlos  take the only duty  That stormy fate now suffers him to pay  My horses wait close to the garden walls  With trusty knights to guide you to my castle  Dreading the worst I had prepar'd this refuge  When the fell  Moor  began his fierce assault  For  me  I'll stay and greet with smiles deceitful  ZORADOR whom I hate to ward if possible  What further ills his malice may devise"  The King embrac'd with servent gratitude  The noble youthand follow'd where he led  There a close chariot harness'd and attended  Waited to bear them from the dang'rous spot  The flying steeds seem'd conscious of their office  And instant cleft the air with eagle swiftness  Mean while the  Moorish  troops rush'd through the gates  And on our bulwarks fix'd their haughty standards  No terms the citizens obtain'd but those  Of vassalage and uncondition'd slavery  Whilst their chief officers were instant sworn  To be allegiant to the swarthy Infidel  Mean time with speed towards the royal palace  As to his home ZORADOR bent his course  Vaunting that now the  Christian  King should kneeling  Ask  him to wed the Daughter whom he woo'd  With offer'd thrones and was with scorn rejected  But when he found no Sov'reign to insult  No Princess to affront with odious passion  His furious transports made a thousand victims  The Nobles' houses were with strictness search'd  The churches monast'ries were all defil'd  By the unhallow'd infidels in vain  Three days the search continu'd when the  Moor  Foaming with disappointed pride made oath  That if the Princess in eight days appear'd not  The conventswalls should to the ground be ras'd  And their pure vestals sate his savage soldiers  These dreadful tidings to the King and Princess  The faithful ARLOS sent "My castle walls"  He said "no longer will protect my Sov'reign  The church itself will aid the keen pursuit  Deeming it better that one royal Maid  Should feed the lust of a detested tyrant  Than that their holy virgins should become  The prey of the licentious soldiery  Fly then my Prince The loyal Knight whose hand  Presents this testimony of my faith  Will to a secret spot where he himself  Asylum found attend your wand'ring steps  Not wand'ring long for surely Heav'n that tries  The virtue which it loves will reconduct you  To your lost people's arms and rightful throne"  The darkest robe of night o'erspread the hemisphere  When at the castle GONZALES arriv'd  The royal pair in humble weeds disguis'd  Instant forsook the hospitable roof  And sought untravell'd wilds and gloomy deserts  The spirits of the King weigh'd down with sorrow  Had sunk beneath accumulated ills  Had not wise Heav'n endu'd his Daughter's mind  With strength to bear  her  griefs and chear her Father's  With tender talk the tedious way she shorten'd  And when exhausted Nature ask'd recruit  Hymn'd him to sleep beneath umbrageous trees  A whole day's sun beheld her duteous cares  The moon arose and still they journey'd on  But the succeeding sun with earliest beam  Guided the travellers to a forest's verge  Here GONZALES the steeds unrein'd and drove  In envied freedom to a neighb'ring mountain  Lest their betraying hoofs should guide pursuers  To the asylum of the hunted King  In the wood's centre they a cottage found  Form'd by Misfortune's hand of humble clay  Two rooms it had in each a rustic bed  For stately chairs a bench a roughhewn table  That ne'er with other dainties had been fill'd  Than labour cull'd from the surrounding herbs  Or from the vinesthat in the desert air  With their delicious burdens long had swell'd  Nor found one tempted hand to ease the load  Such the retreat the fugitives had found  Adieu to gilded roofs and chorded minstrelsy  Adieu to greatness and unhealthful pomp  The winds now rustle through their strawcrown'd cot  And birds with wildnote sweet compose their concert  Full seven slow moons have turn'd their monthly orbs  Since GONZALES the cottage left and since  No human sound but their own pensive tones  Have reach'd the Princess and her Father's ears  What can I more If my eventful tale  Hath touch'd the chords of pity in your heart  And swell'd the sympathetic tearsoft tribute  By gentle minds to sorrow ever paid  Know 'tis no stranger's woes I have related  I  am the object of my own sad story  It is the Princess speaks  Enough exclaim'd  The Knight springing with ardor from the bank  Enough our prize is found and wealth and rank  And bright ZULEDA's smiles are now DE COURCI's  Thus speaking to his lips he fix'd a bugle  Whose piercing sounds ten thousand echoes bore  On airy wings through the surrounding woods  The signal heard six  Moors  obey'd its voice  And spurr'd their horses headlong through the glades  For these OSMIDA stay'd not The false Knight  No sooner spoke his joy than like a fawn  Who from the neighb'ring thicket hears the voice  Of the fierce wolfshe bounding left her seat  And fled to safer shades A starting star  Less rapid cleaves the air when  Ethiop  Night  Shews on her wanton breast his lucid trail  Meanwhile the royal cottager whom Sleep  Spight of his cares had woo'd to her embrace  Broke from her tempting arms He call'd OSMIDA  List'ning in vain to hear her cheering voice  He started from his couch and rob'd in haste  Rush'd forth to seek her in her fav'rite haunts  Darting his fearful eye across the lawn  On which their cottage stood close on its edge  Panting and breathless he beheld his darling  With all the little strength that age had left  He hasten'd to receive her What his dread  When at his feet he saw the Princess drop  Exclaiming as she fell in fainting voice  Father ALMANZOR KingThe fearstruck Monarch  Unable from the mossy grass to raise  Its lovely burden sinking by her side  Strove by his tears and fond paternal voice  To rouse her torpid sense and wake her soul  Not guessing at th'extremity of woe  Which soon must burst upon his hoary head  He thought some frightful reptile had surpris'd  And chill'd with female fears her tim'rous mind  But oh how short a while his fate allow'd  This soft delusion Through the night's still air  The sound of human voices and the clank  Of iron hoofs reveal'd a scene at once  That almost shook his soul from her frail tenement  The  Gallic  leader of the  Moorish  band  And sure no soil but  Gallia  's could produce  A Knight thus treach'rous thus completely form'd  To guide a project hatch'd in nether hell  Mark'd with his eye OSMIDA's flying course  Courage he cry'das the base slaves advanc'd  All our past trouble and our long fatigues  This happy hour repays OSMIDA's found  Found at the instant that my famish'd hopes  Scarce lent a ray to guide me in the chace  When through the tissu'd thicket to my eye  The friendly moon reveal'd her hope prophetic  Call'd her OSMIDAyet my eager tongue  I dar'd not with that hope intrust lest Fear  Should draw her veil upon the dangerous truth  In prayer she was employ'd which instant taught me  That piety must be the bait to snare her  So won her confidence and read her heart  Allah  be prais'd rejoin'd a bearded Infidel  Freedom is oursZORADOR's favour thine  But  Christian  art thou  sure  thou hast beheld  ALMANZOR's Daughter One fair maid alas  We have already to our master borne  For her he sought and scarce with life escap'd  So fierce and rageful was ZORADOR's anger  The Princess  self  acknowledg'd said the Knight  Fled from this spot scar'd at my bugle's sound  A cottage somewhere in the sombrous forest  Conceals the trembler and her aged Sire  I mark'd the road she took and now will guide you  To those who will not hail us  welcome  guests  Thus speaking he push'd onwards through the wood  And soon espy'd the little peaceful dwelling  In which for seven long months the exil'd King  Had sigh'd his anguish to the passing winds  Upon the earth they saw the hoary Monarch  Supporting on his knee the drooping head  Of his unhappy child his hands were clasp'd  And rais'd towards that Heav'n which now allow'd  Sorrow to drain her vial on his brow  This moving picture e'en DE COURCI's eye  Could scarcely see with pity unsuffus'd  Skill'd in deceit and hiding a bad heart  With all the polish learnt in faithless courts  He with an air so meek approach'd ALMANZOR  As though he sought him only to bewail  The sad events that shut him from the world  The King perhaps had yielded for a moment  To the delusive hope his look inspir'd  Had not the group of  Moors  who yet approach'd not  Explain'd the dreadful purport of the visit  Unhappy Monarch said the softtongued Knight  Much it afflicts me that my barb'rous fortune  From all ZORADOR's court DE COURCI chose  T'explore the sacred spot of your retirement  Had not the tyrant at his hateful nod  Devoted  Moors  enough and callous slaves  Us'd to the work of infamy and guilt  But I a  Christian  knight must be selected  To guide an enterprise so curstOh Fate  Thou never loadedst me with ills till now  The King experienc'd in mankind saw through  The thin disguise of this most florid speech  He saw the serpent in the spicy shrub  He saw the villain in the gentle eye  Not deigning a reply he bent his head  O'er the reviving Princess Oh OSMIDA  Exclaim'd th'afflicted Prince thy beating pulse  Thy dear returning breath is now unwelcome  Rather I'd see those eyes for ever clos'd  This flutt'ring heart fixt by Death's potent voice  Than thus receive thee back again to life  The royal Virgin's scarcerecover'd faculties  Announc'd themselves in fears "Oh let us fly  My Fatherlet us fly" she murmur'd forth  "We are pursu'dthe Knight the wiley Knight"  Pursued indeed replied the weeping King  Pursued and caught O my heart's dear OSMIDA  They have us in their toilswe're lost we're lost  Rous'd at this dreadful sound the waken'd Princess  Starting threw round her eyesthey met DE COURCI's  A gravesent spectre in the deep of night  Scarce gives such horror to the shrinking sinner  As did DE COURCI's form to shock'd OSMIDA  Speechless she hid her face and clasp'd her father  Who strove t'inspire a calm his heart disown'd  The polish'd villain who the blackest crimes  With  impoliteness  could not stain withdrew  That the bewailing mourners unrestrain'd  Might pour their anguish in each other's breast  Vain were the task to paint th'impassion'd scene  Which grief and fear and thousand racking thoughts  With glowing horrors all conspir'd to fill  The  courteous  Knight observing where he stood  That the first torrent of their grief was spent  Ventur'd again t'approach the wretched pair  Pardon illustrious Prince he cried the slave  Whom harsh necessity alas compels  To stop your converse with your beauteous Daughter  ZORADOR  he  who knows no law but  will  The smallest breach of whose commands the rack  Or more inevitable death awaits  Ordain'd that soon as your retreat was found  A moment to delay should not be giv'n  But instant maugre circumstance or tears  That we should bear to their forsaken home  Th'unwilling Princess and her royal Sire  Now if it please you we must leave this desert  For haunts more fitted to your royal rank  This mock'ry of respect return'd the King  To those whom you command adds points to insult  Our masters you then treat us as your slaves  The only boon I can descend to ask  Is that my Daughter in this fatal journey  May not be torn from me From thee ah no  Precipitant exclaim'd the royal Maid  Together let us go whate'er our fate  Still let my filial voice my Father cheer  And pierce the night of his collected sorrows  DE COURCI seem'd to pause when strait a  Moor  Of port superior to the rest thus answer'd  It is our Sovereign's will that you fair Lady  Should hold no converse with your princely Sire  'Till your arrival in your native city  Doubt not but then each boon you ask and all  Your fruitful fancy can devise our master  Gracious to charms like yours will grant with rapture  When Beauty sues he knows not to deny  What then will be your Beauty's pow'r You  The King impatient and enrag'd broke in  Upon the  Moor  Cease  Saracen  he cried  Nor dare thus violate my Daughter's ears  Or thou shalt find that in a desert old  Unarm'd ALMANZOR is a King Lead on  And since high Heav'n ordains thy impious Master  Should hold the balance of our fate obey  His harsh command tear us asunder yes  Drag from the old man's heart the last sole joy  His woes had left to save him from despair  Plunge me at once in horror's deep abyss  Not longnot long my friends will you afflict me  A show'r of tears that down his furrow'd cheeks  Upon the bosom of OSMIDA fell  Ended a speechwhich men steel'd by long use  Against the touching voice of heav'nborn pity  Could not unsoften'd hear but strove to palliate  To their own hearts in coarsespun sophistry  The baseness of their voluntary task  Sprightly  Aurora  looking through the clouds  Which blush'd with pleasure at her near approach  Chas'd from the hemisphere the paleey'd moon  Who had so sweetly shone she seem'd 'till now  The morning's counterfeit But Oh to mis'ry  Whether the paleey'd Moon or sprightly Morn  Or Sun refulgent leads the passing hours  All all alike they undistinguish'd roll  One cheerless chaos one impervious gloom  If to DE COURCI and the wond'ring  Moors  OSMIDA lovely seem'dhow lovely now  When bright'ning day disclos'd her to their view  One blaze of charmscharms of that tender cast  Which sorrow did not sully but become  Her polish'd form was graceful as the antelope's  Her air majestic as the sailing eagle's  When 'mongst the fleecy clouds he gently waves  And views high  Skiddaw  like a shrub below  Her face a  Raphael  would have caught to form  A young  Madonna  bending o'er her Child  With brow serene and lovedistilling eyes  Her lockssuch locks as Nature only gives  Once in an age to perfect some rare beauty  Seem'd like a golden veilpart hung before  Shading a polish'd neck which look'd between  The burnish'd threads like purest ivory  Through gilded network part the Zephyrs snatch'd  Playing enamour'd in the beauteous toils  The rest in dropping ringlets fell behind  And kiss'd the foldings of her flowing robe  Such was the Princess whom a  Moor  now seiz'd  And on DE COURCI's steed securely fix'd  A silken sash held by the treach'rous Knight  Pass'd through OSMIDA's girdle and enchain'd  The mourning Virgin and her deadliest foe  Upon another steed was plac'd ALMANZOR  Behind a guiding  Moor  This was the state  The kingdom's Monarch and the kingdom's Heir  Were now constrain'd to use No pompous guards  No blessing populace no proud grandees  Their steps attendbut oh how small  that  grief  Weigh'd with the horrid fears the tort'ring doubts  Which fill their bosoms and absorb their thoughts  The leafy desertwhich so long had seem'd  A cheerless prison to th' illustrious pair  They quit with aching hearts and heavy sighs  Its solitary shadeshow welcome now  Its humble turfform'd cot its devious glades  Its choral groves they would with rapture greet  And hail them as the dear abodes of Peace  But these they have for everever left  And soon the forest's verdant roof grows dun  Upon the distant eye The eager  Moors  With spur and slacken'd reins kept pouring on  Leaving whole leagues obscur'd with floating dust  The royal Prisoners scarcely with a glance  Can speak a thought much less converse and share  With kind participance each other's woe  Thus they continued through untrodden wilds  Whose savage echoes never yet had learnt  To imitate the cordial voice of man  The churning boar and howling midnight wolves  Had taught them all the language that they knew  At length the Sun behind the western mountains  Hid his pervading eye the humid Eve  Led on her deep'ning shades to quench the thirst  The fev'rish orb had left on plants and flow'rs  The  Moors  now strain their wistful eyes  To meet some woodland or some shelt'ring cave  In which to court their strengthrestoring sleep  The last they foundit seem'd t'have been the haunt  Of fierce bandittior more peaceful home  Of some sequester'd hermit for its floor  The chissel's edge had smooth'd and its low roof  Was rudely fashion'd to a semidome  Here the sad trav'lers were allow'd the rest  Which through the fervid day they'd ask'd in vain  The Princess whose soft limbs were not inur'd  To such extreme fatigue sunk lifeless down  Soon as her feet had touch'd the solid earth  The aged King with scarce  more  strength approach'd  To catch his falling ChildThe flinty floor  Receiv'd them bothOSMIDA and her Sire  With care officious the attending slaves  The duties of humanity perform'd  The Princess they recover'd and a spot  With their own garments spread to form a seat  Less rig'rous than the rock for its high inmates  Parch'd corn suncandied grapes and racy wine  They plac'd respectfully before the King  Exhausted Nature crav'd the cordial draught  Whilst to her Sire's request OSMIDA yielded  And of the patriarchal feast partook  DE COURCI and the  Moors  dar'd not resign  Their heavy lids to sleep but in rotation  Two the cave's entrance guarded and the third  Plac'd near ALMANZOR interruption gave  Whene'er the royal Parent and his Child  Strove to beguile the melancholy hours  With such sad converse as their griefs allow'd  This had ZORADOR order'd lest OSMIDA  Should from her Father catch more fortitude  T'oppose his furious passion than he thought  A female could possess Celestial chastity  He held a phantom bred from Custom's laws  And that the magic of licentious love  Could melt its airy formfor now he meant  T'assert a conqu'ror's rights and place the Princess  Not on a Throne but 'mongst his fav'rite slaves  And make her Sov'reign of his loose seraglio  Constrain'd to silence Sorrow's blest physician  Stole by degrees upon their aching eyes  O soft enchanter Sleep why did Idolaters  Ne'er build thee temples Thee whose sweet dominion  Boundless extends wherever Nature breathes  Thee in whose arms Anguish forgets her throbs  Chill Want the nipping blast and wild Despair  Finds gleams of comfortI sing Paeans to thee Sleep  Scarce had the mettled coursers of the Morn  Brought her gay chariot to th'horizon's edge  And coif'd the mountains with her ruddy gold  Ere prompt DE COURCI and the watching  Moors  Flew to caparison their grazing steeds  Returning quick they rous'd their torpid fellows  And last awak'd OSMIDA and the King  What an awakening Touch not O my pen  Upon the catching theme Of woe enamour'd  Thou'lt hang too long upon the tears the sighs  The grieffraught words with which they hail'd the day  Events more active ask thy little skill  Some hours they had pursu'd their steady course  When from a coppice bord'ring on the road  An armed troop rush'd forth So quick their motion  DE COURCI's band ere they beheld their danger  Were in a circle drawnmore dreadfully portentous  Than wand of witch or wizard ever form'd  The gallant Knight who at his girdle wore  Unwilling beauty seem'd at once the object  Three vizor'd warriors at his stirrups stood  Two held their lances to his throat the third  Destroy'd the magic zone which held the Princess  And snatch'd her instant from DE COURCI's side  With such dispatch was this atchievement made  The Knight had scarcely drawn to save his prize  Ere he beheld her ravish'd from his arms  And at a distance from th'astonish'd troop  Turning with fury on his foeswho thus  Had all his splendid hopes reft from his heart  He rais'd his arm and aim'd a pond'rous sword  Where guiltless it could not have fall'n when instant  His unpois'd body with Herculean force  Was to the earth propell'd breathless he lay  And trampling steeds soon fix'd him to the spot  From whence th'unhappy youth ne'er rose again  The  Moors  undaunted at their leader's fate  Sustain'd th'assailant's shock as if resolv'd  Their pris'ners and their lives should both be lost  Or undivided kept Two forc'd their way  Towards the spot where guarded by her Knight  The Princess stood three of the foe pursu'd  And made the path which led to her the road  To death inglorious The remaining  Saracens  Fought as those fight who knowing they must die  Resolve the victors shall buy conquest dearly  But he who at his crupper held the King  More fiercely than the restmore madly fought  His fellows too hemm'd in the struggling Monarch  And turning to the Prince their horses haunches  Form'd with their spears a threat'ning glory round him  When he who held himwatching for the moment  Broke from the rest and on the distant winds  Seem'd borne away The demon who presides  O'er evil acts and aids the deeds that most  Partake of Hellsurely his steed impell'd  And brac'd his sinews with unnatural vigor  His fiery eye darting o'er hills and plains  Scarcely outstripp'd his hoofs the vales the woods  His glance devour'd were in an instant left  Behind his feath'ry heels that onward prest  Whilst the pursuing stretching mad'ning foe  Beheld new hills new plains new woods arise  Between their coursers and their ravish'd Prince  Meanwhile OSMIDA in amazement lost  Beheld herself unchain'd and yet not free  Those who had held her pris'ne  she saw slain  But who are these who risk thus gallantly  Their lives for her and the dethroned King  Perchance new masters perhaps again they're slaves  Scarce had this question in her whirl of thought  Had time to firm itself ere at her side  She saw the noble ARLOSHence vain fears  The magic touch of hope her bosom swell'd  And confidence chac'd ev'ry doubt away  Raising the snowy veil which hid her face  She beam'd a smile upon the loyal Knight  That in his mind o'erpaid ten thousand dangers  Fly my best ARLOS said the charming maid  As at her feet he knelt and save the King  See where he sits unarm'd amidst his foes  Were  he  in safety all my thoughts were peace  The Knight upspringing staid not to reply  But instant hors'd spurr'd onward to his troop  His troop he join'd but not till the rich prize  He flew to save was ravish'd from his hopes  Three of the band he instantly dispatch'd  To stop the progress of the flying  Saracen  The few remaining  Moors  urg'd by despair  Still madly fought preferring present death  To the slow tortures which they knew their Tyrant  Would fail not to inflict on those who lost  The beauteous object of his brutal love  Their wish they soon receiv'd and their freed spirits  Sought the eternal shores The Princess now  Remain'd sole object of the cares of ARLOS  With eager speed he sought the trembling maid  Who saw her Parent borne o'er distant wilds  And in that sight lost ev'ry newborn comfort  Her tears bedew'd the senseless earth her cries  Rent Heaven and her unconscious feet mov'd quick  Towards the course in which she saw her Father  ARLOS in soothing terms implor'd the fairone  To moderate her grief Doubtless he cried  The gallant youths who now pursue the  Moor  Will not pursue the flying slave in vain  They know the mazy roadseach devious path  Each secret turningand will meet the villain  When least he can suspect his danger Now  Sweet Princess to my castle let me lead you  There if not happier yet at least securely  Your tears you may indulge and feed your sorrows  Scarce sensible to what was urg'd OSMIDA  Allow'd herself once more upon a steed  To be replac'd her horseman noble ARLOS  Who through morasses underwoods and roads  Almost impervious brought his royal ward  In safety to his mansion Oh how blest  This moment had appear'd had the same roof  That shelter'd her been shelter to her Father  That solace wanting others lost their taste  Her sorrows to suspend ARLOS related  Events that yet could not have reach'd her ear  The faithful GONZALES he told the Princess  Suspected by ZORADOR bore the rack  With undiminish'd courage nor confest  Though life was promis'd and immense rewards  The place of her retreat that he Lord ARLOS  By wiles and arts the jealous Tyrant blinded  Who held him truest servant of the  Christians  Thus unsuspected he had watch'd the roads  Which led towards her forest with his life  To rescue from the  Moors  the royal  gitives  If fate malevolent should e'er betray them  Another tale in pity he withheld  That the curst  Moor  insatiate in revenge  Had caus'd MONTENOS' Father Duke  Medina  To die upon the blockon stale pretence  That he had form'd a plot to wrest the crown  His family he banish'd their rich lands  Confiscate madeand yet the Tyrant liv'd  As the sad Princess heard with growing horror  Repeated acts of cruelty scarce human  The Knights return'd who had pursued her Father  It was enough she saw them pass the gates  Without the King no circumstance was needful  None could her anguish lessennone her woe increase  Their tale scarce won attention Much they talk'd  Of hot pursuit and of the villain's speed  That once his flagging courser rais'd their hopes  When sudden on a neighb'ring plain appear'd  A troop of  Spahies  in a mock engagement  The  Saracen  gain'd vigor at the sight  Whilst those who follow'd measur'd back their road  Knowing the ruin of their Lord inevitable  Should they his faithful vassals be discover'd  Vain were th'attempts of ARLOS to dispel  The deep distress which seiz'd OSMIDA's heart  The sweetest words e'er fram'd by consolation  Were spent upon the air The young ELVERA  Sister to ARLOS lent her infant aid  To chear the royal guest and with soft prattle  Kissing the drowning roses on her cheek  Strove to divide her sorrowfixt attention  But oh her Father was a wretched captive  What could abate the anguish of that thought  In vain surrounding slaves watch'd ev'ry motion  In vain the cielings rose on stately columns  Forcing their grandeur on the awestruck eye  In vain the downy beds invited rest  Beneath rich canopies imboss'd with gold  Dearer the russet pillars of the forest  Whose meeting branches canopied the earth  Where stood her lonely cot Oh dearer far  The humble couch on which her Father's head  Securely rested where her ready hand  His pillow smooth'd and filial cares excited  Sweeter slumbers Who now will watch his sleep  Or sooth his griefs to rest Who waits his waking  To cheer with tender voice the lengthen'd day  So spoke the heart of the unhappy Princess  Now to the hospitable cares her fate affords  We leave the Mourner and pursue the King  END OF PART I  LINES IN IMITATION OF COWLEY  TOUCH'D by thy wit my soul's on fire  My bosom throbs with young desire  What though thy form I never saw  Is there to man divulg'd a law  That only what he sees must touch his heart  The vulgar rule I disallow  And in my passion feel e'en now  That wit like beauty gives the tender smart  Methinks thy form I would not know  Nor to thy face the pleasure owe  Of these delicious melting pains  Which when a mortal once attains  He knows the greatest bliss for man design'd  No to my fancy I'll apply  There find thy form thy air thy eye  And feast my frenzy with a zest refin'd  When in a pensive mood I sit  And Melancholy takes her fit  Mild tender soft thou shalt appear  Like the first blossoms of the year  But when in brisker tides my spirits run  L'Allegro  shall the pencil take  Describe thy look thy step thy make  And shew thee lively as bright MAIA's son  A MONOLOGUE  OCHATTERTON for thee the pensive song I raise  Thou object of my wonder pity envy praise  Bright Star of Geniustorn from life and fame  My tears my verse shall consecrate thy name  Ye Muses who around his natal bed  Triumphant sung and all your influence shed  APOLLO thou who rapt his infant breast  And in his daedal numbers shone confest  Ah why in vain such mighty gifts bestow  Why give fresh tortures to the Child of Woe  Why thus with barb'rous care illume his mind  Adding new sense to all the ills behind  Thou haggard Poverty whose  cheerless  eye  Transforms young rapture to the pond'rous sigh  In whose drear cave no Muse e'er struck the lyre  Nor Bard e'er  madden'd  with poetic fire  Why all thy spells for CHATTERTON combine  His thought  creative  why must thou confine  Subdu'd by thee his pen no more obeys  No longer gives the song of ancient days  Nor paints in glowing tints from distant skies  Nor bids  wild scen'ry  rush upon our eyes  Check'd in her flight his rapid genius cowers  Drops her sad plumes and yields to thee her powers  Behold him Muses see your fav'rite son  The prey of WANT ere manhood is begun  The bosom  ye  have fill'd with anguish torn  The mind  you  cherish'd drooping and forlorn  And now  Despair  her sable form extends  Creeps to his couch and o'er his pillow bends  Ah see a deadly bowl the fiend conceal'd  Which to his eye with caution is reveal'd  Seize it APOLLOseize the liquid snare  Dash it to earth or dissipate in air  Stay hapless Youth refrainabhor the draught  With pangs with racks with deep repentance fraught  Oh hold the cup with woe ETERNAL flows  Moremore  than  Death  the pois'nous juice bestows  In vainhe drinksand now the searching fires  Rush through his veins and writhing he expires  No sorrowing  friend  no  sister parent  nigh  To sooth his pangs or catch his parting sigh  Alone  unknown  the Muses' darling dies  And with the vulgar dead unnoted lies  Bright Star of Geniustorn from life and fame  My tears my verse shall consecrate thy name
