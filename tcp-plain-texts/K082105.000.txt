 AN EPITOME OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF THE INSECTS OF CHINA COMPRISING  FIGURES AND DESCRIPTIONS  OF UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED NEW SINGULAR AND BEAUTIFUL SPECIES TOGETHER WITH SOME THAT ARE OF IMPORTANCE IN MEDICINE DOMESTIC ECONOMY c  THE FIGURES ARE ACCURATELY DRAWN ENGRAVED AND COLOURED FROM SPECIMENS OF THE INSECTS  THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE ARRANGED ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEM OF LINNAEUS WITH REFERENCES TO THE WRITINGS OF FABRICIUS AND OTHER SYSTEMATIC AUTHORS  By E DONOVAN  AUTHOR OF THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BRITISH INSECTS c  LONDON  PRINTED FOR THE AUTHOR BY T BENSLEY  AND SOLD BY WHITE PLEETSTREET FAULDER BONDSTREET BELL OXFORDSTREET c    ADVERTISEMENT  THE History and Present State of China as far as relates to its government its sciences and its arts has long been considered worthy of the deepest research and much information has been collected on these subjects with considerable labour and expence under the auspices of several of the most powerful courts in Europe If the natural productions of that country have attracted less attention it is only because their value and importance are less generally known upon better acquaintance they would at once excite our astonishment and convince us of their utility  General readers are sometimes disposed to consider the Insect World as too minute and fri∣volous to deserve investigation Let them remember however that to a foreign Insect the staple commodity of this kingdom is indebted for its richest dye that from another we derive the most costly articles of dress and splendid ornaments of luxury and the utility of many others is appa∣rent in various branches of medicine the arts and domestic economy  Prompted by these reflections the Author determined to submit to the Public a Series of En∣gravings illustrative of the Entomology of ChinaBut flattering as the prospect of encourage∣ment to his project appeared he would not presume to publish his Work till the result of the late Embassy of Earl Macartney to that country was fully known of that the public are now in pos∣session and though in common with every friend to the commercial advantages and scientific inquiries of this country the Author must regret its issue it is perhaps on the whole more favourable to the present Publication than if the event had been different If indeed a more general intercourse had been established between the two nations and the language of China had been better understood it is impossible to calculate the advantages which Entomology amongst other sciences might have derived for the Chinese like their neighbours the Japanese are well acquainted with the natural productions of their empire and Zoology and Botany in particular are favourite studies amongst them To what degree of excellence they have arrived in their scientific researches we are not informed but we must not affect to despise the instruction of a people amongst whom the most useful arts and sciences first dawned and acquired a high degree of perfection when "Europe had scarcely a few savages scattered over her forests"  The few but interesting hints which Sir George Staunton has given on the practical Ento∣mology of China induces us to look forward to a period when some of the Insects as well as Plants of that vast empire may be no less objects of curiosity than of national utility and im∣portance the Chinese Cochineal Insect  Dr Anderson has found eight species of Cocci at Madras One of these he says was found on a young citrontree Citrus Sinensis just landed from China it was more deeply intersected between the alxlominal rings than any of those of the coast and he names it therefore C Diacopeis  Collection of Letters from Madras Jan  The Cactus Cochinilifer has lately been found by Mr Kincaid at Canton its Chinese name is  Pau wang  This has been transmitted to the  Nopalry  of the Hon East India Company at Madras and promises to be of future advantage to the commercial concerns of Great Britain We have been unable to procure any of the Chinese Cochineal insects and purposely omit that species which Sir G Staunton has noticed because it has no relation to the productions of China  and that from which the wax of the cast is procured  are two species that deserve particular attention The medical precepts of the Chinese will cer∣tainly find few votaries in Europe but as articles of medicine amongst others the Meloe Ci∣chorei which were the cantharides of the ancients and are now used by the Chinese may be of importance as it possesses more virtues than the Meloe Vesicatorius used in our pharmacy the Curculio regalis Buprestis vittata and many others are also employed in articles of jewellery in the eastern parts of the world and may vie with the richest gems in beauty and splendour  These observations we presumed to offer on the Entomology of China in submitting the Design of this undertaking to the public We have solicitously endeavoured to gratify the cu∣riosity and expectation such observations were calculated to excite and trust not altogether un∣successfully On the economical purposes of the Chinese Insects we can offer little except con∣jectures those may however assist the inquiries of future observers and the general reader will not be disposed to regard it with less favour if novelty and beauty supply the deficiency of useful information It embraces in one view a variety of the most uncommon and brilliant species of that fertile region portrayed in an elegant and faithful manner and classically arranged accord∣ing to the favourite system of  Linnaeus  Thus whilst our Epitome of the Chinese Insects ex∣hibits a splendid display of this beauteous race it may insensibly lead to a comprehensive survey of the system itself and by conveying instruction in its most pleasing form facilitate the study of this charming but much neglected science  From its commencement the Author has been encouraged by the liberal attention of several persons whose names would reflect honour on this undertaking were he at liberty to mention them He has already observed that his own collection includes several thousand specimens collected by amateurs of the first celebrity  The late Duchess Dowager of Portland Tunstall Esq Governor Holford Smeethman Ellis Keate Yeats Forster Baily  c c  To this he may add that every other collection he was desirous of consulting has been kindly open to his inspection and every information com∣municated with a readiness that merits his warmest thanks Amongst these he cannot refrain noticing the valuable collection of Drawings and MSS before alluded to the specimens of In∣sects collected in the journey of his Excellency Earl MACARTNEY in the late embassy to China and the very magnificent collections of Mr FRANCILLON and Mr DRURY from both of whom he had unreserved permission to figure and describe whatever his own cabinet could not furnish And finally he must own himself particularly indebted to the favours of the Right Hon Sir J BANKS Bart K B whose invaluable cabinet and library have afforded him every assistance in completing his design and for which he begs leave to testify his most grate∣ful acknowledgments

given three varieties of Scarabaeus Molossus The specimen figured in the annexed plate is the  var c  of that author  The larvae of the larger kinds of coleopterous insects abounding in unctuous moisture are not less esteemed as food among some modern nations than they were by the epicures of antiquity In Jamaica and other islands in the West Indies the Macokko  Prionus damicornis  Fab Ent Syst  Cerambyx damicornis  Linn Mant  larva is an article of luxurious food and in China most insects in that state are appropriated to the same purpose Thus also the Romans introduced the larvae of the Lucani  Stag beetles  and Cerambyes  Capricorn or Goat beetles  in their voluptuous repasts previously feeding them on farinaceous substances to give consistence to the animal juices  The learned author of the last account we have of China says "Under the roots of the canes is found a large white grub which being fried in oil is eaten as a dainty by the Chinese" Perhaps this is the larva of Scarabaeus Molossus which like many other of the Scarabaei  The larvae of the Scarabaei live in the trunks of decayed trees in putrid and filthy animal substances or in the earth The last are the most injurious because they destroy the roots of plants All the known kinds of these larvae are of an unwieldy form and whitish colour the skin free from hairs and only the head and sore feet defended with a shelly covering  may live sedentary in the ground and subsist on the roots of plants the general description and abundance of this insect in China favours such opinion The same author observes in another part of his work that "the aurelias of the silk worm which is cultivated in China after the silk is wound off furnish an article for the table" This also is a very ancient custom among the Asiatics and even Europeans before the sixteenth century if we may credit Aldrovandus  The German soldiers sometimes fry and eat silk worms  Aldrov  it is certain the worms if not the aurelias were administered in medicine in early ages  Silk worms dried powdered and put on the crown of the head help the  vertigo  and  convulsions  mundify or cleanse the blood c c  Schroderus Serapio c c

SCARABAEUS SACER exscutellatus clypeo sex dentato thorace inermi crenulato tibiis posticis ciliatis elytris laevibus  Linn Syst Nat  Fab Ent Syst    p    Scarabaeus Sacer is a native of China it is also found in other parts of the East Indies in Egypt Bar∣bary the Cape of Good Hope and other countries of Africa and throughout the south of Europe  A few remains of ancient monuments and some fragments of historic information preserved from an early period of the world afford certain and interesting details of this inconsiderable creature Those remains evince indeed but the first dawning of natural and moral philosophy on the human mind but connected with the history of the insect before us are too important to be passed over in silence  The Scarabaeus was held in profound veneration by the people of Egypt  The species worshipped by the Egyptians is precisely noted by Linnaeus  Scarabaeus sacer  and also by Olivier  Scarabé sacré  "Cet insecte étoit autrefois en veneration en Egypt"  Oliv  They regarded it as a visible deity but a more refined system of religious worship prevailed in their temples among the priests and sages  Eschenbach Jablouski Savary c  They deemed it only the symbol of their god and ascribing both sexes to the  Scarab  it became a striking emblem of a selfcreated and supreme first cause  "The father mother male and female art thou"  Synesius Hymn Phtha  "The Egyptian spirit  Phtha  gave chaos form and then created all things"  Jamblichus de Mysteriis sect    This insect was more especially the symbol of their god Neith  Neith  The disposer of all things c  Jablonski  "Sais" of the Delta "the capital of its district is a considerable city of which Amasis was king  Neith  the Minerva of the Greeks is the titular divinity"  Plato in Timaeo  "On the door of the temple of  Neith  was engraved in hieroglyphics 'I am what is what was what shall be mortal has never raised my veil the sun is the fruit of my womb"  Proclus Commentary on the Timaeus of Plato  cThese passages demonstrate Neith and Phtha to be two attributes of one spirit The third attribute is Cneph or divine goodness  Savary  whose attribute was power supreme in governing the works of creation and whose glory was increased rather than diminished by the presence of a superior being  Phtha  the creator The theological definition of the two powers being independent yet centering in one spirit is implied by the figurative union of two sexes in the Scarab In the latter sense it signified therefore but one omnipotent power The Scarab typifying Neith was carved or painted on a  ring and worn by the soldiers as a token of homage to that power who disposed of the fate of battles  Authors quote a doubtful passage in  Herapollo Hieroglyph lib  to support this opinion That such rings were worn by the ancient Egyptians is beyond conjecture many remains of them and some very perfect have been found in the subterranean caverns and sepulchres in the Plain of Mummies near Saccara and Giza Those which we have examined are remarkable for the convexity or full  relievo  of the figure sculptured on them in some it is of the natural size of the insect but generally smaller the stone cornelian without a rim and turning on a swivel ring of gold  and sculptured on astronomical tables or on columns  Linnaeus says the Scarabaeus facer is sculptured on the antique Egyptian columns in Rome "Hic in columnis antiquis Romae exsculptus ab Aegyptiis"  Syst Nat  Does Linnaeus allude to any remains of those colossal obelisks which Augustus trans∣ported to Rome when he subjugated Egypt or others of more recent date It would increase the interest of our enquiries to learn that the Scarabaeus was among the hieroglyphics on the two very ancient obelisks carried from Heliopolis the city of the Sun  The indefinite and visionary interpretations imposed on most Egyptian hieroglyphics through a long series of ages will barely support a few conjectures on their original signification Those which related to local incidents history or the arts are veiled in profound obscurity The phaenomena of nature and astronomical calculations inscribed in those characters are scarcely better understood though the knowledge of those sciences have been in part handed down to us from the learned Egyptians in remote ages We are informed by ancient writers that the Scarabaeus engraved on the astronomical tables of these people implied the divine Wisdom which governed the motion and order of the celestial bodies that those tables were huge and massy stones or columns of granite with the characters and figures large and highly embossed in short such as were supposed capa∣ble of long resistance to the corroding hand of time Among those the Scarab was probably the most conspicuous its size gigantic and the figure frequently repeated for this we have observed even on small Egyptian antiques  Various valuable remains of tablets with figures of the  Scarabaeus sacer  are preserved in the British Museum and other col∣lections of antiquities in this country Those we have examined are of various descriptions some smaller than the insect itself others of a monstrous size The stones on which they are sculptured generally  green nephritic  or  jade stone  or a kind of  basaltes  and black marble the figure  basso relievo  on a tablet or slab but oftener in  relievo  with the prominent characters of the insect very accurately defined particularly the six dentations of the clypeo and those of the tibiae The reverse of the embossed side is flat and smooth and abounds in characters altogether unknown though from the number of religious objects of worship occasionally interspersed we may presume they contain an ample store of the ancient sacerdotal language the most remarkable were the scarab the sceptre and eye  Osyris  or the sun  the human figure with a dog's head  Anubis  the hawk  Horus  a famous deity had three cities dedicated called by the Greeks the cities of  Apollo  and the Ibis  The mummies of these birds are found in urns in the subterranean galleries called the well of birds near  Saccra  supposed from the size to be the Tantalus Ibis of Linnaeus  or sacred bird On the thorax of one fine specimen we remarked four elegant figures One of them is holding a  cornucopia  in the left hand and a branch in the right this is perhaps a subordinate deity of the Nile that river having been once found depictured on an an∣tique Alexandrian coin like an aged man holding the cornucopia and a branch of the Papyrus denoting its abundance and produce  The digression on the mythological history of this insect may be considered by some as a tedious deviation from the pursuit of the naturalist with others we trust it will be more favourably received for it proves to the unprejudiced mind how deeply the history of nature and in the present instance the science of Entomology involves a most important enquiry into the first philosophical opinions of the human race The means however trifling must not be contemned which illumine the most sublime of all human researches  The Study of Mankind  it expressed the divine wisdom

lateral stripe of black and the denticulations on the posterior thighs of our insect clearly removes it however from the Linnaean species Among the  Curculiones  described since by Fabricius we have not discovered any with which our species can be confounded and deeming it a non∣descript we name it specifically  Chinesis  a name perhaps too local but expressive of the native place of our specimen and not applied by Fabricius in his last work to any insect of the same genus though that author has exhausted almost every applicable name in the descriptions of more than four hundred of its species  The only specimen of this curious insect we have seen is in the possession of Mr Drury of London from whose extensive collection we have been liberally permitted to copy and describe such Insects as

Brasil and New Holland produce some gigantic species but none more beautiful than those of India We need adduce no other proof of this than Buprestis chrysis sternicorus attenuata ocellata and vittata These wrought into various devices and trinkets decorate the dresses  A pair of slippers embroidered with little pieces of the wing cases of this insect is preserved in the Leverian Museum  of the natives in many parts of India The Buprestis vittata in particular is much admired among them It is we believe entirely peculiar to China where it is found in vast abundance and distributed from thence at a low price among the other Indians The Chinese who always profit by the curiosity of Europeans collect vast quantities of this Buprestis and other gay insects in the interior of the country and traffic with them  A considerable error seems to have arisen concerning this species and the true Buprestis ignita of Lin∣naeus All authors except Fabricius and Olivier have considered the Buprestis vittata and ignita the same Fabricius in his  Species Insectorum  refers to  Mus Dom Banks  only for the Buprestis vittata and to the th figure plate in  Sulzer  's work for a figure of Buprestis ignita In the  Entomologia Systematica  we however find the same reference to the figure of  Sulzer  for B vittata  Vol part p  and to increase the perplexity precisely the same reference under that of B ignita  Vol part p  also  The Buprestis ignita of Linnaeus we imagined was unknown in the cabinets of the curious in this country till we discovered an insect nearly corresponding in character with it in the collection of Mr Drury and which we presume is the B ignita or at least a variety of it It has not the brilliance of colours that so eminently distinguishes B vittata but in form and size it agrees with it The only figure of that species is given by Olivier from a specimen formerly in the cabinet of Gigot d'Orcy of Paris We have exa∣mined the specimen in the cabinet of Sir J Banks referred to by Fabricius as B vittata and find the figure in Sulzer is of that species as well as the specimen we have represented  Fabricius has given as a part of the specific distinction of these insects that B ignita has  three spines  at the end of each wing case or elytron and B vittata no more than  two  This may form a sufficient cha∣racteristic in those species but we must remark that it is not so in Buprestis ocellata We have two speci∣mens that have two spines at the end of each elytron and another with three as Fabricius has described it We also find several insects nearly allied to B vittata the stripe of gold on each side excepted one of these has six teeth another four teeth and a third only two  The Buprestides are supposed for the most part to undergo their transformations in the water or marshy ground  Canna IndicaIndian flowering Reed  This plant is common in China and is found also in most other parts of Asia Africa and America In our

one large spot on the back when the wing cases are closed  These spots on the wing cases are strikingly characteristic of this species at least we have not ob∣served them in any other of the Buprestis

some other parts of the East Indies The small specimen is  rare but is probably only a variety of the other sort According to Olivier the Meloe cichorei is used by the Chinese in their medical preparations instead of the Cantharis vesicatorius of the Europeans and is supposed to be more efficacious in certain cases The same author quotes a passage in  Dioscoride Med Lib  to prove that it is also the Cantharides of the ancients  Les Cantharides des anciens et celle des Chinois ne sont pas les mêmes que celles des Européens Les Chinois employ∣ient le Mylabre de la Chicorée c c""The Cantharides of the ancients and those of the Chinese are not the same as ours The Chinese employ the  Mylabre de la Cichorei  and it appears from  Dioscoride Mat Med Lib    Cap  the ancient Cantharides were the same as those now used by the Chinese" "The most efficacious sort of Cantharides" says Dioscoride "are of many colours having yellow transverse bands the body oblong big and sat those of only one colour are without  strength  " The description Dioscoride has given does not agree with our species of Cantharides as they are of a fine green colour but is more applicable to the  Mylabre de la Cichorei  which is very common in the country where Dioscoride lived  Olivier's Entomologie ou Hist Nat des Insectes Vol I Introd  The Cantharides of the ancients are by no means to be confounded with those of medical writers in the last century By the term Cantharides in an European  Pharmacopeia  we understand the Meloe vesicatorius  Geoffroy calls this a Cantharis The Linnaean Cantharis is a distinct genus  of Linnaeus an insect whose medicinal properties are very generally known  Applied externally to raise blisters It is a violent poison taken inwardly except in small portions  The Cantharides of the ancients can scarcely be ascertained it was a term indiscriminately applied to several kinds of insects and too often without regard to their physical virtues Pliny speaks of the Cantharis as a small beetle that eats and consumes corn and of another that breeds in the tops of ashes and wild olives and shines like gold The ancients were certainly well acquainted with our common sort though it is confounded with others in a general appellation  The common sort has been called  Musca Hispanica  by some Latin authors and hence Spanish fly by Boyle    Hippocrates Galen Pliny Matthiclus  and other physical writers of antiquity treat of the medicinal uses of Cantharides but it is not clear that they alluded to only one species  Olivier endeavours to prove that the Mylabris Cichorei is the ancient Cantharides the authority of his opinion is cre∣dible and the inference natural if not conclusive But if it were in use so also might the common sort for Dioscoride whom he quotes mentions those of only one colour also The ancients often confounded the term Scarabaeus with Cantharis but whether because they knew that the common kinds of Scarabaei produce the same effects as the Cantharis is uncertain  The Scarabaeus auratus  and  Melolontha  several  Coccinellae Cimex nigrolineatus c c  have a place in the  Materia Medica  as  Cantharides  HEMIPTERA  * Mantis Oculata  ** Mantis Flabellicornis  MANTIS OCULATA  CORNUTEDEYE CAMEL CRICKET  GENERIC CHARACTER  Head slightly attached to the thorax unsteady the mouth armed with jaws and palpi

given in the work of Stoll on  Cicadae c  one kind he calls  La Mante ètroitement cornue  the other  La Mante Chinoise ètroites cornue  The first is from the coast of Coromandel and Tranquebar the other as its name implies is a Chinese insect We cannot discover any material difference between these figures and our specimen and are inclined to consider them altogether as one species  Few of the  Cicadae  and  Locustae  described by Fabricius in his  Species Insectorum  have any reference to figures because a very small number of them had been figured till Stoll published his work on those genera Stoll has occasion to mention with regret that Fabricius has scarcely noticed any of his plates It is a considerable disadvantage to the works of that author as well as to the naturalist that comults them that no scientific names or definitions are given to the figures of many rare insects included amongst them  The Mantis Oculata of Fabricius is an African insect and was described from the collection of the Right Hon Sir J Banks Bart we have compared our Chinese specimen with it and find it is precisely the same species  MANTIS FLABELLICORNIS  FANHORNED CAMEL CRICKET  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  A broad membrane on each side of the thorax next the head Anterior thighs terminate in a spine the second joint beset with spines and furnished with a lobe on one side Antennae pectinated  MANTIS FLABELLICORNIS thorace apice dilato membranaceo femoribus anticis spina terminatis reliquis lobo antennis pectinatis  Fab Ent Syst    p    sp    This Mantis is described by Fabricius only Stoll has given the figure of an insect not unlike it in his publication and we have seen a specimen similar to it which was found by Professor Pallas near the Caspian sea It is allied to Mantis Gongyloides a native of Africa and Asia but bears a closer affinity to Mantis Pauperata  Figured by Stoll under the name of  La Mante Goutteuse Brune  from Java Molucca and perhaps other islands in the Indian sea  Fabricius enumerates fiftyone species of this genus in his last system a considerable portion of these are from Asia had he included the lately discovered kinds in America and New Holland his genus would have been far more comprehensive Few naturalists have had the opportunity of observing the manners of these creatures in distant countries nor can we always rely on the information those few have given Of the European species we can speak with more precision because some indefatigable naturalists have at∣tended minutely to them Roesel in particular has treated at considerable length on the manners of the Mantis Religiosa of Linnaeus  Descriptions can only convey an imperfect idea of the extraordinary appearance of many creatures in∣cluded in the Mantis and Locusta genera Among them are found species that bear a similitude to the usual forms of other insects but from these we almost imperceptibly descend to others bearing as strong a simi∣litude to the vegetable part of creation seeming as if Nature designed them to unite the appearance of a vegetable with the vital functions of an animal to preserve them from the ravages of voracious creatures or to connect that chain of progressive and universal being which  " The great directing MIND of ALL ordains"  Many of these creatures assume so exactly the appearance of the leaves of different trees that they fur∣nish  the entomologist with unerring specific distinctions thus we have  L citrifolia laurifolia myrtifolia oleifolia graminifolia  and others equally expressive of their resemblance in form and colours to the leaves of those respective plants Travellers in countries that produce these creatures have been struck with the phaenomenon as it must appear of animated vegetable substances for the manners of the Mantis in addition to its structure are very likely to impose on the senses of the uninformed They often remain on the trees for hours without motion then suddenly spring into the air and when they settle again appear lifeless These are only stratagems to deceive the more cautious insects which it feeds upon but some travellers who have observed it have declared they saw the leaves of those trees become living crea∣tures and take flight  M Merian informs us of a similar opinion among the Indians who believed these insects grow like leaves on the trees and when they were mature loosened themselves and crawled or flew away From the credulous and unscientific marvellous reports of such extraordinary creatures may be expected but to these we must add the authority of a naturalist whose works are a valuable addition to our present knowledge of the history of nature these are the works of Piso  Gulielmi Pisonis Amsterl      "Those little animals" says that author "change into a green and tender plant which is of two hands breadth The feet are fixed into the ground first from these when necessary humidity is attracted roots grow out and strike into the ground thus they change by degrees and in a short time become a perfect plant Sometimes only the lower part takes the nature and form of a plant while the upper part remains as before living and moveable after some time the animal is gradually converted into a plant In this Nature seems to operate in a circle by a continual retrograde motion"  Has the father of inventive romance outdone this account of Piso in his wellknown extravagant poetical effusions  Luna quater junctis implêrat cornibus orbem c OVIDII Metamorph  Sorores Phaëthontis in Arbores  Four times revolving the full moon return'd  So long the mother and the daughters mourn'd  When now the eldest Phaëthusia strove  To rest her weary limbs but could not move  Lampetia would have help'd her but she found  Herself withheld and rooted to the ground  A third in wild affliction as she grieves  Would rend her hair but fills her hands with leaves  One sees her thighs transform'd another views  Her arms shot out and branching into boughs  And now their legs and breasts and bodies stood  Crusted with bark and hardening into wood  But still above were female heads display'd  And mouths that call'd the mother to their aid  What could alas the weeping mother do  From this to that with eager haste she slew  And kiss'd her sprouting daughters as they grew  She tears the bark that to each body cleaves  And from the verdant fingers strips the leaves  The blood came trickling where she tore away  The leaves and bark the maids were heard to say  "Forbear mistaken parent oh forbear  A wounded daughter in each tree you tear  Farewel for ever" Here the bark increas'd  Clos'd on their faces and their words suppress'd  ADDISON's  Trans Phaeton's Sisters transformed into Trees  We quote this part of the poem at length for as we peruse it every successive line bears a stronger similitude to the wonderful transformation of the Mantis as related by  Piso  we might be almost tempted to condemn the description of the naturalist as a servile copy of Ovid's verses if the similar transformation of other insects above noticed had not occurred to the knowledge of every entomologist  It may be imagined he has not but before we dismiss his account with a hasty  censure let us attend to the opinion of a few authors nearly contemporary with himself we find these collected in the criticisms of Roesel on that passage  From these it appears that the works of Piso were much admired when first published but we rely less implicitly on the information it contains than his readers in the last century Roesel treats his account with more than merited severity not because he could contradict the relation of Piso but because he had never observed the same circumstance attend the Wandering Leaf or Mantis Oratoria in Europe  Among the annotations on the last edition of Roesel's  Insecten Bellustigung  we find one relating to this part of the works of Piso "  Der seel Her geheime Rath Trew c  Couns Trew assures Mr Roesel that  Piso  not only very often gave out the credible observations of others as his own but himself believed the most incredible relations and pretended to be an eye witness thereof" We quote this in justice to the remarks of Roesel  Note in page    section Das Wandlende Blat  This reasoning is neither so conclusive or liberal as we should expect from Roesel and more especially as he afterwards describes even the first symptom of the transformation as related by Piso When he speaks of the death of the European species his words are "As their dissolution approaches their green eyes become brown and they unavoidably lose their sight they remain a long while on the same spot till at last they fall quite exhausted and powerless as if asleep" What is this but substantiating part of the evi∣dence of Piso which he has laboured before to discredit As to the change after they remained long on the ground such as sending forth fibres roots and stems from the body of the insect it is only astonishing such a wellinformed naturalist should have deemed it matter of surprise Could he be ignorant of the many instances that occur of animal substances producing plants  Such as Mucor crustaceus c  or was lie not informed that the pupa which commonly sends forth a bee a wasp or cicada has sometimes become the nidus of a plant thrown up stems from the fore part of the head and changed in every respect into a vegetable though still re∣taining the shell and exterior appearance of the parent insect at the root  Specimens of these vegetated animals are frequently brought from the West Indies we have one of the cicada from the pupa as well as others produced from wasps and bees in the perfect or winged slate Mr Drury has a beetle in the perfect slate from every part of which small stalks and sibies have sprouted forth they are very different from the tufts of hair that are observed on a few coleopterous insects such as the Buprestis sascicularis of the Cape of Good Hope they are certainly a vegetable production  We own at first sight with Roesel that the account of Piso seems " an inattentive and confounded observation" but that an insect may strike root into the earth and from the cooperation of heat and moisture congenial to vegetation produce a plant of the  cryptogamia  kind cannot be disputed We have seen species of  clavaria  both of the undivided and branched kinds four times larger than the insect from which they sprang and can we then deny that the insect mentioned by Piso might not produce a plant of a proportionate magnitude In short are we so well acquainted with the productions of Brasil as to contradict any of his assertions concerning this transformation Piso does not say of what kind this vegetable was it must surely be of the fungi  kind reasoning then from analogy it might be an unknown species of  clavaria  with numerous and spreading branches and finally the colour of his plant on which authors lay much stress might be green though a colour not so predominant in that tribe of vegetables as some others  The largest and most interesting of the Indian species of Mantis is found in the isle of Amboyna Stoll contradicts the account of  Renard  Poissons des Molucques par M Renard Amsterl  who says these creatures are sometimes thirteen inches in length but we have a specimen almost of that size It is related by Renard and others that the larger kinds of Mantes go in vast troops cross hills rivers and other obstacles that oppose their march when they are in quest of food If they subsisted entirely on vegetables a troop of these voracious creatures would desolate the land in their excursions but they prefer insects and clear the earth of myriads that infest it if these become scarce from their ravages they fight and devour one another When they attack the plants they do great mischief It is said of some Locusts and Mantes that the plants they bite wither and appear as if scorched with fire we have not heard of this pestilential property in any of the larger species of Mantes  Of the smaller kinds the Mantis Oratoria is the most widely diffused being found in Africa and Asia as well as in all the warmer parts of Europe These creatures are esteemed sacred by the vulgar in many countries from their devout or supplicating posture The Africans worship them and their trivial names in many European languages imply a superstitious respect for them  Louva Dios by the Portuguese Presque Dieu by the French    England produces no species of this tribe The entomologists in this country must consequently rely on the accounts of those who have observed them in other parts of the world We shall select a few remarks from Roesel's extensive description of Mantis Oratoria and Gongyloides because if we may pre∣sume from the analogy they bear in form to Mantis Flabellicornis the history of one will clearly elucidate that of the other  Roesel says some of the Mantes are local in Germany they are found chiefly in the vintages at Moedting in  Moravia  where they are called  Weinhandel  Probably a provincial term for a dealer in wine  The males die in October the females soon after  Goetz in his Beytrage observes that they live sometimes ten years  The young brood are preserved in the egg state in a kind of oblong bag of a thick spongy substance this bag is imbricated on the outside it is fastened lengthwise to the branch of some plant  To that of the vine in Mantis Oratoria  As the eggs ripen they are protruded through the thick substance of the bag and the larva which are about half an inch in length burst from them Roesel wishing to observe the gradual progress of these creatures to the winged state placed the bag containing the eggs in a large glass which he closed to prevent their escape From the time they were first hatched they exhibited marks of a savage disposition He put different sorts of plants into the glass but they refused them to prey on one another this determined him to supply them with other insects to eat he put  ants  into the glass to them but they then betrayed as much cow∣ardice  as they had barbarity before for the instant the Mantes saw the ants they tried to escape in every direction By this Roesel found the ants were the greatest persecutors of the Mantes He next gave them some of the common musca house flies which they seized with eagerness in their fore claws and tore in pieces but though these creatures seemed very fond of the flies they continued to destroy one another through savage wantonness Despairing at last from their daily decrease of rearing any to the winged state he separated them into small parcels in different glasses but here as before the strongest of each community destroyed the rest  Another time he received several pair of Mantes in the winged state profiting by his former obser∣vation he put each pair a male and female into a separate glass but they still shewed signs of an eternal enmity towards one another which neither sex nor age could soften for the instant they were in sight of each other they threw up their heads brandished their fore legs and waited the attack they did not remain long in this posture for the boldest throwing open its wings with the velocity of lightning rushed at the other and often tore it in pieces with the crockets and spines of the fore claws Roesel compares the attack of these creatures to that of two hussars for they dexterously guard and cut with the edge of the fore claws as those soldiers do with their sabres and sometimes at a stroke one cleaves the other through or severs its head from the thorax After this the conqueror devours his vanquished antagonist  We learn from Roesel also the manner in which this creature takes its prey in which respect we find it agrees with what is related of the extra European species The patience of this Mantis is remarkable and the posture to which superstition has attributed devotion is no other than the means it uses to catch it When it has fixed its eyes on an insect it very rarely loses sight of it though it may cost some hours to take If it sees the insect a little beyond its reach over its head it slowly erects its long thorax by means of the moveable membranes that connect it to the body at the base then resting on the four posterior legs it gradually raises the anterior pair also if this brings it near enough to the insect it throws open the last joint or crocket part and snaps it between the spines that are set in rows on the second joint If it is unsuccessful it does not retract its arms but holds them stretched out and waits again till the insect is within its reach when it springs up and seizes it This is the uncommon posture before alluded to Should the insect go far from the spot it flies or crawls after it slowly on the ground like a cat and when the insect stops erects itself as before They have a small black pupil or sight which moves in all directions within the parts we usually term the eyes so that it can see its prey in any direction without having occasion to disturb it by turning its head  The most prevalent colour of this tribe of insects is fine green but many of these fade or become brown after the insect dies some are finely decorated with a variety of vivid hues the most beautiful of these that we have seen are from the Moluccas  ** Gryllus vittatus

species in China on the contrary it is probably uncommon Several others of the locust are abundant in that country and in seasons favourable to their increase do incredible mischief  "Famines

Staunton Chap on Tiensing  Both the Gryllus tartaricus and Gryllus migratorius inhabit Tartary on the northern confines of China from whence at certain periods they descend like an impetuous torrent

of light having engaged the attention of the earliest philosophers we must conclude that phosphorical appearances and those especially of animated bodies could not fail to attract their particular notice Indeed it is evident from the writings of the ac∣curate observers of nature in remote ages that they were acquainted with certain insects that have the property of shining in the night These were known only by general terms expressive of that property yet it is probable that some of the Linnaean lampyrides which are abundant in the south of Europe as well as in Asia and some parts of Africa were the first of the illuminated insects known to them  The lampyris of  Pliny  is expressly the insect with a shining tail  Some of the males which are furnished with wings and are illuminated like the semales were striking objects of natural history and could scarcely have escaped their notice The Greeks included all shining insects under the name lampyris and the Latins called them cicindela noctiluca luciola lucernata c Whether any of the  Fulgorae  were known to the ancients is uncertain probably they were not the most remarkable species being peculiar to the warmest parts of America Asia once the feat of learning does indeed pro∣duce a few species but we have no account of these in ancient natural history  The Fulgorae seem to have been entirely unknown in Europe till the latter end of the last century when two writers published descriptions and figures of  Fulgora Lanternaria  Madame Merian of Holland in her splendid work on the Metamorphosis of the Insects of Surinam and Dr Grew of London in his Rarities of Gresham College  Reaumur  Memoires pour servir a l'Histoire des Insectes  is the next author who described the  Fulgora Lanternaria  and after him Roesel in his "Amusing History or recreation of Insects  Insecten Belustigung  " This brings us to the period in which  Fulgora Candelaria  our Chinese species was first known in Europe a circumstance of much importance to naturalists at that time because the first mentioned species was a solitary example of its singular genus The transactions of the Stockholm academy includes the earliest figure and description of this extraordinary insect from these Linnaeus described it in his  Systema Naturae  but his arrangement has undergone many alterations since that time At first he included it among the Coleopterous insects then he called them Lanternariae and again they were classed with the Cicadae These have been since corrected and a new genus formed of insects with elongated trunks on their foreheads exclusively under the name Fulgora a name that has been adopted by later authors and finally by Fabricius  Roesel has given three figures and a description of the  Fulgora Candelaria  from his account we learn that it was known in England before he was acquainted with it On its peculiar qualities he observes he must be entirely silent because he had been unable to derive any information concerning it his description is notwithstanding extremely prolix and occupies four quarto pages as he notices every trifling particular of the spots colours c of the insect We have selected the most interesting passage because it clearly marks the progressive advancement of the knowledge of natural history in Europe so late as the middle of the present century  "According to my promise" says Roesel  Versprochener massen lieseve ich nunmehr die zwente Sorte des LanternenTragers c Vol pl Locust page  "I now produce the second sort of Lanterncarrier which I never saw before and of which I have never read in any work on insects The scarcer however it may be the more I am indebted to Mr Beurer apothecary of this place  Nurenberg  c for the permission he has granted me to draw and enrich my collection with it Mr Collinson has sent it to him from London under the name Lanternaria Chinensis for which reason I have called it the Asiatic or Chinese Lanterncarrier" Roesel being a respectable entomological writer of his time we must infer that  Fulgora Candelaria  was extremely scarce in Europe when his plate and descriptions were published The commercial concerns of Europeans with the Chinese having greatly increased since that period has facilitated many inquiries con∣cerning the natural productions of China and a mongst a variety of other insects that are now usually brought from that country specimens of Fulgora Candelaria are not uncommon In China few insects are found in greater abundance  The authors who have figured or described the Chinese Fulgora since Roesel are De Geer  De Geer Histoire des Insectes  Seba  Seba Thesaurus Naturae  Sulzer  Kenwzeichen der Insecten Characteristics of Insects  and our countryman Edwards  Edwards's Birds London  De Geer gives a very concise description and no figure and Seba merely observes in his description of Fulgora Candelaria "La Chine produit une autre espéce du même genre mais beaucoup plus petite et toute differente" Edwards has given a figure of it in one of the plates in his work of Birds His description is certainly uninteresting  "I take it to be a kind of firefly and that part on the head the lantern The wings are all flat and the upper ones hard and smooth like those of the  Beetle  or  Scarabaei  kind of which it is a species"  Edwards    Having noticed the several authors who have treated on this insect we come to consider the peculiar properties of its fingular genus and among these we find the most astonishing that insects can possess that of emanating light not merely a momentary shining appearance as is produced by many viscous substances but a clear and constant resemblance to the element fire and capable of diffusing light to surrounding objects though totally destitute of every principle that can do mischief To the unphilosophical mind it appears at first impossible and it cannot fail to astonish the best informed Indeed some readers might be inclined to doubt the veracity of travellers in foreign countries who have seen a vegetable  An instance of this occurs its the south of Europe An account in the Philosophical Transactions relates of the Dictamnus Albus Fraxinella that "it in the still evenings of dry seasons it emits a n inflammable air or gas and flashes at the appproach of a candle There are certain instances of human creatures who have taken fire spontaneously and been totally consumed"  or an animal produce light if our own country could not supply us with abundant analogous proofs of such phaenomenae The presence of this animated phosphorus if we may so express it is observed on several insects that are natives of England it is needless to enumerate them because the most striking example must be recollected by every rural inhabitant or admirer of poetical simplicity  "On every hedge  "The glowworm lights his gem and thro' the dark  "A moving radiance twinkles"  THOMSON  The account which Madame Merian gave of the effect of the light produced by the  Fulgora Lanterna∣ria  The account which Madame Merian has given of the light of the  Fulgora Lanternaria  is so surprising that it will certainly prove acceptable to many readers It is indeed a digression from the account of  Fulgora Candelaria  but will tend to prove that insects of this genus emit a more vivid light than any of the illuminated kinds hitherto known  "Once" says Madame Merian "when the Indians brought me a number of these Lantern carriers I put them into a wooden box without being aware of their shining at night but one night being awakened by an unusual noise and much frightened I jumped out of bed and ordered a light not knowing whence this noise proceeded We soon perceived that it originated in the box we opened with some inquietude but were still more alarmed after opening it and letting it fall on the ground for a  flame  appeared to issue from it which seemed to receive additional lustre as often as another insect slew out of it When we observed this some time we recovered from our terror and admired the splendour of these little animals"  Dissert de generatione et metamorphibus Insectorum Surinamensis  was greatly discredited though Dr Grew had related some surprising particulars of a specimen of it  from Peru  Cucujus Peruvianus  "That which beside the figure of the head is most wonderful in this insect is the shining property of the same part whereby it looks in the night like a lantern so that two or three of these fastened to a slick or otherwise conveniently disposed of will give sufficient light to those who travel or walk in the night"  Grew Museum Regalis Societatis p    Her account has however been generally believed since the missionaries  Le verluisant Ceux que nous voyons à la canpagne

confirmed her account It is admitted that the  Chinese Fulgora  has an illuminated appearance in the night "The foreheads of many Fulgorae especially those found in China emit a lively shining light in the night time which according to some authors is sufficient to read by"  Yeats  Yeats Institutions of Entomology    The light of the Fulgorae is generally imagined to issue from the trunk or elongated projection of the forehead but Roesel offers a conjecture on the light of the Fulgora Lanternaria which on further inves∣tigation may enable naturalists to determine whether the light is entirely produced by an innate property of the trunk or receives additional splendour from some external cause He notices a white farinaceous substance on several parts of the wings and body as well as the trunk which he observes looks like the decayed wood which shines at night We mention this conjecture of Roesel though the same occurred to us before we perused his observations We have invariably found a similar white powder on other insects of this genus but usually upon the trunk only The remarks of Roesel were necessarily very limited two species of the Fulgorae only being then known We possess twelve distinct species and have made dissections and observations on several others from all which we are inclined to imagine that the white powder has a phosphoric appearance in the living insect and increases the light when the end of the trunk is illu∣minated  One of the Fulgorae of considerable magnitude from the interior of India enabled us to make many observations The trunk is of the same form as that of the  Fulgora Candelaria  The colour is a dark but beautiful purple the apex scarlet of a perfectly pellucid appearance and still retains a reddish glare The spots of while sprinkled on the purple colour of the trunk exhibit also a slight appear∣ance of phosphoric matter On the trunk of the Fulgora Candelaria these white spots are very conspi∣cuous  Though the generic name Fulgora seems to imply some effulgent property in the insects that compose the genus it is uncertain whether all possess that property They are indeed furnished with a trunk but it is smaller in proportion in several species than in F Lanternaria Candelaria Flammea Phospho∣rea  and some others It has not been determined whether any of the European Fulgorae shine in the night time The genus is very limited including the discoveries of modern naturalists Fabricius de∣scribes only twentyfive species of these seven are European and eighteen extraEuropean Two species are found in England  Chrysanthemum IndicumIndian Chrysanthemum  This is a very lately introduced species in England It is mentioned by Sir G Staunton among the plants collected in the provinces of  Shantung  and  Kiangnan  Thunberg describes it as a native of Japan in the  Flora Japonica  A variety of it is figured in the  Hortus Malabaricus  and in the  Herbarium Amboinense  is another We observe a great dissimilarity between the figures of this plant in different works That figured in the  Herb Amb  has very small flowers scarcely broader than our large daisy  Chrysanthemum Leucanthemum  the leaves

larger than either of these yet not of the magnitude represented in the plate of Mr Curtiss Botanical Magazine  This Chrysanthemum is not peculiar to China though it has been long cultivated in that country It grows spontaneously in some parts of Japan and from the name it bears in the Arabic Persic and other languages is probably known in most parts of Asia  CICADA SANGUINEA  RED AND BLACK

well as of De Geer which latter author we have followed in the specific name Fabricius having separated the Linnaean Cicadae into several genera this species will be found in his Entomologiae

TETTIGONIA ATRATA atra alis albis basi nigris venis testaceo  Fab Ent Syst    Though the observations that Sir G Staunton has made on the natural production of China in his late publication were necessarily very general the science of insects appears to have engaged his particular attention and on that account we must lament that untoward events precluded him from observing more minutely the peculiarities of some kinds and the economical purposes of others  In the general histories of unknown countries and we can scarcely consider China in any other view the entomologist musf expect to find his favourite science neglected or treated in a manner more likely to excite curiosity than reward enquiry The work of this learned writer is an exception to our remark though a few inaccuracies occur in it We peruse the following account of an unknown species of Cicada with particular regret because it withholds information interesting to the naturalist and from its air of novelty is likely to promote an erroneous opinion concerning that singular tribe of insects  "The low and sometimes marshy country through which the river  Peiho  passes is favourable to the pro∣duction of insects and many of them were troublesome some principally by their sting and others by their constant stunning noise The music emitted by  a species of Cicada  was not of the vocal kind but produced by the motion of two flaps or lamellae which cover the abdomen or belly of the insect It is the signal of invitation from the male of  that species  to allure the female which latter is quite unprovided with these organs of courtship  Chap Vol II octavo  "  Again when deseribing a town higher up the river that author says "The shops of Haitien in addi∣tion to necessaries abounded in toys and trifles calculated to amuse the rich and idle of both sexes even to cages containing insects such as the  noisy Cicada  and a large species of the Gryllus  Chap Vol II  "  The reader may imagine from the first account that the music of every other species of Cicada is of the vocal kind or that it is peculiar to this Chinese insect to be furnished with lamellae that cause a sound The latter account confirms such conjecture by alluding in a specific manner to the  noisy Cicada  as to an insect described in a former part of the work We must remark that not only the males of the species mentioned by that author are furnished with those lamellae but the whole of that section of the Linnaean Cicadae which Fabricius has called Tettiogonia  This includes all the larger species of Linnaean Cicadae such as  C Orni Tibicien reticulata haematodes stridula  c c for in some editions of the Systema Naturae of Linnaeus we find  Cicada Noctilucae  which in later editions are the  Fulgorae  and also the  C cruciatae mannifera spumantes  and  deflexae  included in one genus  The males of the species included in the other sections of that genus are certainly furnished with them also though some of them are too minute to be observed without a glass These lamellae vary in size in different species but the accounts we have of them from travellers in foreign countries and naturalists both ancient and modern prove they all emit a certain sound to allure the female As we are unable to ascertain the Chinese species Sir George mentions neither figure or description accompanying his account of it we must therefore speak generally of the whole genus and then confine our remarks to those species we are acquainted with from China Among these are C  spendidula sanguinea  and  atrata  The latter we believe is the largest species of the Chinese Ci∣cadae known in Europe  Some species of this tribe were known to the ancients With them it was the emblem of happiness and eternal youth  Probably because it was supposed to live only a short time The renewal of youth is illustrated by the story of the Tithonus transformed by Aurora into a Cicada  and if we examine the legends of pagan mythology we find they were deemed a race of creatures beloved by gods  Phaebus  is thy sire divine  Phaebus  to thy notes has giv'n  Music from the spheres of heav'n  Happy most as first of earth  All thy hours are peace and mirth  Cares nor pains to thee belong  Thou alone art ever young  Thine the pure  immortal  vein  Blood nor flesh thy life sustain  Rich in spiritshealth thy feast  Thou'rt a

and the poets feigned that it partook of the perfection of their deities  These pagan deities were without flesh or blood and composed of aerial and watery humours Such they imagined the moisture of the Cicada and perhaps for that reason first assigned it a place among their demigods  Anacreon depictures in glowing colours the uninterrupted felicity of this creature his ode to the Cicada is

claim to attention both as objects of natural curiosity and importance in domestic economy The Larva is an elegant and beautiful creature and China is indebted to its labours for the fine white wax so much esteemed in the East Indies The plant is not less interesting as it produces the vegetable tallow in general use throughout the Chinese empire  The novelty of those productions could not fail attracting the notice of those learned Europeans who were first permitted to reside in China and whose object was to promote sciences and arts as well as the christian knowledge Both the Waxinsect and Tallowtree are spoken of in their writings as extraor∣dinary and peculiar advantages to the country Du Halde especially in his splendid work L'HISTOIRE DE  LA CHINE treats largely on these productions

attentive observation and serve to illustrate the Natural History and economical purposes of the subjects we are noticing they are briefly these The white wax of China is called  Tchang pe la  it is not the same as the white wax of bees but is the produce of a sort of insect that feeds on a tree called  Tong tçin  these insects form a kind of white grease which attaches to the branches of the tree hardens and becomes wax It is scraped from the branches of the trees in autumn melted on the fire strained then poured into cold water where it coagulates and forms itself into cakes This wax is very white and glossy it is mixed with oil and made into candles and is much superior to the wax of bees for that purpose  Chi tchin  a Chinese writer says it was not till the dynasty of  Yuen  that the wax made by these insects began to be known the custom then became very general to employ it both in medicine and making candles Its medicinal virtues are highly extolled by the Chinese physicians and particularly by  Tchi hen  It is said to be a drug absolutely necessary to surgeons that it makes the flesh close stops bleeding appeases pain unites the nerves rejoints the bones and taken in pills kills the worms that occasion consumptions It is found in most of the southeast provinces of China but the best is brought from  Sc tchuen  and  Yunnan  and from the territories of  Hen tcheou  and  Yung tcheou  These insects are white when young and it is then they make their wax When old they are of a blackish chesnut colour and form little pelotons on the branches of trees These pelotons at first are about the size of a grain of millet towards the beginning of the spring they increase in bulk and spread they are attached to the branches like grapes and at first sight the trees that bear them appear loaded with fruit About the beginning of May they gather them and having enveloped them in the leaves of  Yo  a species of broadleaved grass they are suspended to the trees At the end of June and in July the pelotons open and the insects come forth crawl about the leaves and form their wax  Sir G Staunton in his learned work has also described the Wax insect he found it at Turon Bay in Cochin China and has caused it to be represented in a vignette plate with the following description "Among other objects of natural curiosity accident led to the observation of some swarms of uncommon  insects busily employed upon small branches of a shrub then neither in fruit or flower but in its general habit bearing somewhat the appearance of a privet These insects each not much exceeding the size of the domestic fly were of a curious structure having pectinated appendages rising in a curve bending to∣wards the head not unlike the form of the tail feathers of the common fowl but in the opposite direction Every part of the insect was in colour of a perfect white or at least completely covered with a white powder The particular stem frequented by those insects was entirely whitened by a substance or powder of that colour strewed upon it by them The substance or powder was supposed to form the white wax of the East This substance is asserted on the spot to have the property by a particular manipulation of giving in certain proportions with vegetable oil such solidity to the composition as to render the whole equally capable of being moulded into candles The fact is ascertained indeed in some degree by the simple experiment of dissolving one part of this wax in three parts of olive oil made hot The whole when cold will coagulate into a mass approaching to the firmness of bees wax"  From the accurate description and figures of the latter author it is evident the creature that produces the white wax of China is an imperfect insect or technically speaking the pupa of an insect which in its mature state is furnished with wings This is clearly the fact for the rudiments of wings are visible in the figures alluded to  This may account for a passage in  Gordon  's description of China where he says "In the plains" of Houquang "are vast numbers of little  worms  that produce wax in the same manner as bees do honey" if we understand by  worms  insects not arrived at maturity for the larva of Bombyx Mori is also termed a silk worm though it belongs to the moth tribe when perfect  The metamorphose of insects are so various and their appearance so changed in passing from one state to another that the identity of any species in the larva or pupa can only be proved by actual observation neither do the larva or pupa possess those characteristic differences by which naturalists determine one species from another and this consideration deters us from deciding on the precise species to which the pupa before us should be referred  STOHL a Dutch author has been more fortunate he has ascertained this identical creature to be the pupa of Cicada Limbata and in his work on  Cimices  and  Cicades  gives a figure of it under the title of  De Waldraagster  Nymphe or  La Cigale Porte Laine  fig together with the winged insect at fig and it is on this authority Cicada Limbata is introduced in the annexed plate  We are strongly inclined to credit the accuracy of Stohl in this instance there is much similarity be∣tween the pupa and the cicada and some striking characteristics are common to both They agree in the structure of the antennae and proboscis or sucking trunk the abdomen of the winged insect is also loaded with a fine white powder and is furnished at the extremity with a tuft of down and hairs similar to that so eminently conspicuous in the pupa state We have however observed the white powder and tuft on the abdomen of Cicada lanata and have reason to imagine it also forms a white wax similar to that of the present species  The Cicada limbata is of a light green colour with a red margin that which Stohl has figured is of a pale brown with a black margin These are the  species  and  variety  Fabricius describes for the specimens he refers to in the collection of Sir Joseph Banks agree precisely with our insects Fabricius notes the  habitat  Africa Stohl received the green specimen from the Island of Ceylon the pale sort from Africa The larva we have represented is from China and the Cicada was brought from the East Indies by the late Mr Ellis  Croton SebiferumPoplarleaved Croton or Tallowtree  The Tallowtree is not the natural food of the Wax insect but as they mutually illustrate the same in∣quiry they are represented in the same plate and it is further presumed that a short account of this use∣ful plant will be deemed a proper sequel to the history of the insect  Du Halde when describing the Tallowtree says "Il est de la hauteur d'une grande cerifier Le fruit est renfermée dans un écorce qu'on appelle  Yen Kiou  et qui s'ouvre par le milieu quand il est mûr comme celle de la châtaigne Il consiste en des grains blancs de la grosseur d'un noisette dont la chair a les qualitez du

forme autour du suif une espéce de croûte qui l'empêche de couler  "It is of the height of a large cherrytree the fruit is inclosed in a shell called  Yen Kiou  which when ripe opens in the middle like the chesnut The fruit consists of white kernels of the size of a small or hazel nut whose substance has all the qualities of tallow so that they make candles of it after having melted and mixed it with a small portion of common oil and then dipping the candles into the wax before mentioned it forms a kind of crust round the tallow that prevents its run∣ning or wasting  Page Vol I  Sir G Staunton speaks nearly to the same effect "From the fruit of the  Croton sebiferum  of Lin∣naeus the Chinese obtain a kind of vegetable fat with which they make a great proportion of their candles This fruit in its external appearance bears some resemblance to the berries of the ivy As soon as it is ripe the capsule opens and divides into two or more frequently three divisions and falling off discovers as many kernels each attached by a separate footstalk and covered with a fleshy substance of a snowy whiteness contrasting beautifully with the leaves of the tree which at this season are of a tint between a purple and a scarlet The fat or fleshy substance is separated from the kernels by crushing and boiling them in water The candles made of this fat are firmer than those of tallow as well as free  from all offensive odour They are not however equal to those of wax or spermaceti" This author further adds "The wax for candles is generally the produce of insects feeding chiefly on the privet as is mentioned in the chapter of Cochin China It is naturally white and so pure as to produce no smoke but is collected in such small quantities as to be scarce and dear Cheap candles are also made of tal∣low and even of grease of too little consistence to be used without the contrivance of being coated with the firmer substance of the tallowtree or of wax"  Vide Chapter on Souchoo foo  The tallowtree is now cultivated in the West Indies where it thrives well and produces fruit and by proper attention may hereafter become useful  In the infant state of music men seem to have preferred the natural sounds of some animals to those of their uncouth instruments We cannot otherwise account for the extravagant praise bestowed on the noise of this little creature It is true authors agree that the sounds of some kinds are exceeding loud and harmonious and in the early ages of the world these might have a powerful influence on the human mind It is related that the  ancient Locri  a people of Greece were so charmed with the song of the Cicada that they erected a statue to its honour  Some say that once a certain player of  Locri  contesting in the art of music with another would have lost the victory by the breaking of two strings of his instrument but a  Cicada  flew to his aid and resting on the broken instrument sung so well that the Locrian was de∣clared victor The Locrians erected a statue to the Cicada as a testimony of their gratitude It represented the player with the insect on his instrument    The ancients had attentively observed the manners of its life though they indulged in many poetical fictions concerning it and particularly when they affirmed that it subsisted on dew They have told us that it lives among trees  Dr  Martyn  supposed this refers to the smaller branches in hedges rather than to the lofty trees in forests we cannot entirely coin∣cide with that opinion  which circumstance discountenances the opinion of those moderns

Ainsworth  were the Cicadae of the ancients  Neither were they ignorant that the males only were furnished with those instruments which externally appear to produce its sound or the purpose for which that sound was emitted  Xenarchus an old Grecian playwriter used to fay jocosely that "the Cicadae were very happy because they had silent wives" Aristotle also knew the sexual difference of them he mentions them as a delicious food he preferred the males when young but more so the females before she laid her eggs  though it was reserved for more accurate naturalists to discover the complex organs by which it was caused and modulated Aldrovandus near two centuries ago described the lamellae which he compares to the fruit of some herbs called by modern botanists  Thlaspi  Thalaspi parvum

there not two insects of that nameone of them is we believe a  Blatta  in the Indies perhaps because the sound emitted by it may be likened to the pronunciation of that word Mr Abbot an accurate observer and collector of natural history in  North America  has discovered four new species of Cicada one of them nearly equal in size to our Cicada Atrata This he says was found in great abundance one season in some swampy grounds near Susquehanna river and was remarkable on account of their loud noise which at a little distance resembled the ringing of  horsebells  Communicated by Mr Abbot in North America to Mr Francillon in London  Some naturalists have supposed that the sound of the Cicada is caused by the flapping of the lamellae against the abdomen and others that it is only a noise occasioned by the rustling of the segments of the body in the contractile motion of that part Beckman  Roes Insecten Bellustigung  CHRISTIANI BECKMANNI Bornensis manuductionem ad latinam linguam nec non de originibus latinae linguae c  imagines it is caused by beating the body and legs against the wings he has endeavoured to explain the meaning of ancient authors and deduce its etymology from that circumstance  It is the common opinion that the word  Cicada  has its origin from  quod cito cadat  which after a general interpretation implies that the Cicadae  soon vanish  or are  shortlived  Beckman maintains that this opinion is absurd and proves that its name is derived from singing because  signifies a sound produced by the motion of a little skin and that  ciccum  or  cicum  is a thin little skin of a pome∣granate that parts the kernelsBeckman not knowing the insect or not imagining that the  little skin  was an appendage to the abdomen concluded it must mean the transparent wings and consequently that the sound was produced by beating them against the body but this interpretation if applied to the lamellae instead of the wings will directly prove the origin of its name and knowledge of the an∣cients  Reaumur and Roesel have dissected several of the Cicadae and discovered that the lamellae cannot have that free motion necessary to cause such a sound but that it is produced by some internal organs of the insect and only issues through the opening concealed under the lamellae as through the mouth of a mu∣sical instrument  For the satisfaction of the curious reader we detail the most interesting particulars concerning the organization of these parts from  Reaumur's Histoire des Insectes  and  Roesel's Verschiedene auslaendische sorten von Cicaden c  The music of the Cicada is not caused by the motion of the  lamellae  as some have supposed Reaumur observes that although the  lamellae  have a kind of moveable hinge they have also a stiff and pointed tooth or spine that prevents them from being listed far back and if strained are very liable to be broken  From the anatomical description of Roesel we find that within the two hollows that are seen when the lamellae are listed up two very smooth skins are visible these are highly polished of nearly a semicircular shape and reslect prismatic colours there is between those a hard brown projection or corner which unites with another piece above them in a longitudinal direction to the under part of the breast This longitudinal piece divides a triangular red space or field into two parts one on the right side and the other on the left Above these in a transverse direction is seen two small yellow skins the lamellae in their natural position conceal these organs because they fold exactly over them  Reaumur in the exterior appearance of these parts could discover nothing that could lead to determine the organs of the sound and he was not satisfied that the slight motion of the lamellae on these parts could produce the loud singing noise of the Cicada He opened a few cicadae on the back part of the body so that the inner structure of the under side was displayed and especially the parts connected to the curious organs he had discovered under the lamellae At last he discovered two large muscles which at their point of union formed a space almost square and were connected with the red triangular fields he had observed on the under side as he concluded these formed a material part of the organs he wished to discover he examined them attentively and found that by moving them backwards and forwards he could make a cicada sing that had been dead many months Although the sound was not strong it tended to prove that he had discovered the instrument that produced itIn another part he says it is evident the sound is caused by the little skins connected to the muscles because when they were rubbed with a bit of paper they emitted that kind of sound  Roesel has discovered two little pieces of horny substance that arc connected by a sort of fibre within the skins in the body and he supposes when this is in motion it strikes against the beforementioned thin skins and produces a sound by the same means as a hollow body or drum when struck with a stick and also that this noise may be varied or modulated by a slight motion of the lamellae but cannot be produced without the assistance of the internal nerves and muscles connected with the organs first described  Authors agree that the Cicadae of hot countries emit the loudest sound It appears from the papers of Mr Smeethman who resided it considerable time in Africa published by Mr Drury that the sound of some kinds peculiar to that part of the world is so loud as to be heard at half a mile distance and that the singing of one within doors silences a whole company The same attentive observer says the open parts of the country are never without their music some singing in the evening and others only in the day    The suppositions of these authors seem well founded we have examined many species that were un∣known to them and find the spine before mentioned so placed in many insects as to prevent the motion  of the lamellae We have a specimen from America which in addition to the usual organs of sound have two large hollow protuberances or drums one on each side of the abdomen and must we imagine produce a louder sound than any yet discovered a species very similar to this is also brought from New Holland  The proboscis of those insects is a hard or horny tube in which a very acute slender suckingpipe is con∣cealed The horny tube is not unlike a gimlet in form and is used by those creatures to bore through the bark of trees to extract the juices on which it feeds Linnaeus has named the species of one division in his System  Mannifera  because they had been observed to fly among ash trees bore many holes in them and when the manna had oozed out return and carry it off  With this proboscis they bore holes in the small twigs of the extreme branches of trees and deposit their eggs in them sometimes to the amount of six or seven hundred As each cell contains no more than from twelve to twenty eggs it does great damage to the trees they frequent Stohl says "the common one  Lu Cigale Vicilleuse Cicad Tibicien  which is sound at Surinam in the coffee plantations greatly injures those trees the females deposit∣ing their eggs in the young shoots and in holes they bore with their sheath They live on the juices of the trees"  M Merian gives a figure and account of the metamorphose of a cicada found in Surinam She has mistaken the winged insect to be only the pupa of the  Fulgora Lanternaria  which is too absurd to deserve contradiction in other respects her account is interesting and particularly that part which relates to the pupa state or chafer as it is termed "The pomegranate tree" says Merian "so well known in all other countries grows also in the fields of Surinam On them I have found a species of chafer which is naturally very lazy and consequently very easy to be caught It carries underneath the head a long trunk with which it easily penetrates the flowers in order to extract the honey from them On the th of May when they were laying quite quiet the skin of the back burst open and green flies with transparent wings issued from them These flies are found in abundance in Surinam and have such a rapid flight that it took me many hours to catch one"  The pupa we received from China with our Cicada atrata very much resembles that figured by Merian It has the long sucking trunk or proboscis but the most formidable of its weapons seem to be the fore feet which are thick strong and armed with spines or teeth with these it may do more injury to the plants by tearing off the tender shoots than by wounding the trunk to extract the moisture  We have represented the upper and under side of a male of this interesting species Cicada atrata not only to illustrate our preceding remarks but because we believe no figure has been given of it by any author unless  De Zwarte Chineesche cicade  La Cigale Chinoise noire pres de Canton en Chine Cab de Mons  LF Holthusen pl    fig    of Stohl is intended for this insect The Fabrician description has no synonyms  The general appearance of both sexes of Cicada atrata is very similar except that the female is fur∣nished with a sheath and the male with lamellae The sheath of the female is partly concealed within a valve at the extremity of the abdomen and is only protruded when the creature lays her eggs In the figure of the under surface of a male insect exhibited in the annexed plate the lamellae are distinguished by two stars the single star denotes the situation of the spine mentioned by

camphor in luted earthen vessels A purer sort is brought from the island of Borneo and Japan which is supposed to be a natural exudation from the tree when the bark is wounded Sir G Staunton says the

the large stalks of water plants and deposit their eggs in them or rising out of the water lay them in the extreme branches of those plants to secure them from other aquatic depredators The Nepa rustica displays even more sagacity or attachment for its eggs than those creatures for it never leaves them Till they are hatched it bears them on its back in a cluster of an oval shape these eggs

is the largest of them but as this is inferior in size to several kinds found in Europe we conceive there must remain many larger species of the genus unknown to collectors of foreign insects and yet very com∣mon in China In the latter part of Sir G Staunton's work that author mentions the larva of a  Sphinx Moth  which furnish an article for the table of the Chinese We regret that the indefinite expression can∣not not assist us to determine the species and scarcely the genus of the insect alluded to  European naturalists are entirely ignorant of the Chinese insects in the state of larva and pupa if we except a sew species of the Cimices Cicada and some altogether uninteresting insects that have been accidentally brought among others from that country Hence it must remain undetermined whether they correspond in form with those of other parts of the world It is however highly probable from their great affinity to those in the perfect state that in the state of larva they may also agree The extensive collection of the larva of sphinges made by Mr Abbot in North America affords no singularly constructed animal distinct from those sound in Europe they vary indeed in their colours but preserve uniformly the characters found on the same genus in other countries We noticed among the drawings of the late Mr Bradshaw the figure of a Chinese sphinx apparently  S Hylas  together with a larva similar to that of the Sphinx Stellatarum it was green and like all the known larva of the genus except the  Adscitae  division was perfectly free from hairs it was also furnished with a horn

his works and even in his last enlarged and corrected systematic arrangement has given a Papilio Thallo in the  Heliconii  division of that genus when it is clear no such Papilio has existence Linnaeus has undoubtedly so named an in∣sect figured in a plate of Edwards's birds tab with a reference to that work yet it is certain the insect there figured is not a butterfly but a lepidopterous Insect to which antennae of dubious structure have been added to perfect its appearance  Coincident observations on perfect specimens of several insects nearly allied to this species tend to convince us that the artist had only a mutilated specimen to copy from Indeed though the antennae in his figure are terminated in a kind of capi∣tulum like that of the butterflies the filaments are somewhat jagged as if intended to appear slightly pectinated Cramer notices the very close affinity between his insect  P Tiberina  and that in Edwards's work which he observes differs neither in form nor colour but only in having clubbed antennae those parts of his insect being pectinated or feathered"Mr Edwards a représenté un Papillon qui ne differe de celuici ni pour la coleur ni pour la dessein mais qui a des antennes à boutons Celui que nous donnons ici est gravé d'apres une Phalêne qui a des antennes plumacées" c  Cram  C D Pl  Edwards calls this insect the little black and white Butcher fly because it is figured on a plate with the black and white Butcher bird  No later author has figured the same species and specimens of it being extremely scarce it is probable Fabricius has been unable to detect the error In admitting this however we must necessarily notice the synonyms of  Sphinx pectinicornis  where he also quotes the same figure in the works of Edwards Thus we find throughout all the editions of the Fabrician System a  Papilio Thallo  and  Sphinx pectinicornis  formed of the solitary figure of one insect Cramer has finally increased the ambiguity of its genera by making an insect of close affinity perhaps the same species a Phalaena  Vide P Tiberina  With specimens of both the insects figured by Edwards and Cramer before us we cannot hesitate to consider them Sphinges of the  Adscitae  The Adscitae differ from the other sphinges in their general appearance but have all the characters assigned to that genus  family and of the  Zygaena  of Fabricius In removing our insect to the sphinx genus we have retained the specific name  Thallo  as more likely to denote the species than any newly adopted name The insect figured by Cramer does not precisely agree with Edwards's figure In the first the disk of the posterior wings are yellowish with a deep border of black in the other the yellow occupies only a space near the base and forms a semilunar

tribe of insects remarkable for the neatness and simplicity of their colours Their elegancies consist in the infinite variety and delicacy of intermingled tints the contrast of spots speck∣lings and lineations which constitute the minutiae of insect beauty Some species are to be excepted in this remark the larger kinds are often gaudy and the smallest exhibit a display of the richest colours fancifully disposed and most elegantly diversified  The European species are numerous and pretty well ascertained those of remote countries remain in great obscurity The species inhabiting China are almost unknown  Fab Ent Syst  These are chiefly described from insects in the collection of  Monson Londini  of which no figures are extant and the collection unknown  for the latest systematic writer describes not more than twenty species in all the cabinets in Europe From this scanty number a few are selected to illustrate the genus and if these appear deficient in point of interest or variety it may stimu∣late others to collect new species whenever an opportunity occurs The Phalaena tribe not only of China but every country except of Europe are a  desideratum  of entomology In Europe the number of this tribe exceeds that of any other on the contrary the extra European species are comparatively the most inconsiderable of our acquisitions The Papiliones or Butterflies are a showy and lively race they sport in the open fields in day and attract the traveller's curiosity hence our cabinets abound with them But the moth infinitely more numerous and not less pleasing is seldom seen in the gloominess of its dispo∣sitions  it seeks the obscurity of the forest in the day and only ventures on the wing when the sun is down In Europe we visit its nocturnal haunts without difficulty or dread but in hotter climates these are often∣times impenetrable or the lurking places of ferocious animals and few will expose themselves to their attacks to increase the catalogue of exotic Phalaenae  The far greater number of Phalaenae can only be taken in the woods at night This is termed  mothing  by collectors The moths begin to stir about twilight and when almost dark commence their flight The collector is furnished with a large gauze foldingnet in which the insects are caught indiscriminately for it is impossible to distinguish one species from another and often is so dark that the object itself can barely be discerned Different species have their favourite haunts some the lanes and skirts of woods but many of them prefer the open breaks in the most retired places As it would be unsafe or im∣possible to penetrate the woods in many countries it it better to collect the larva or caterpillar for these may be found on the trees in daytime and if kept in little gauze cages and carefully fed will change into chrysalis and produce the fly This is certainly tedious and few travellers will divert their attention from more important observations but were they to appropriate their leisure to this branch of science they would materially improve entomology Mr Abbot has investigated a small district of Georgia in North America in this manner and our cabinet is indebted to his labours for several hundred species altogether new in Europe The reader may estimate the importance of these discoveries by referring to the two expensive volumes of North American Insects lately published and reflecting that the originals of all the species included in that work are but a small selection from those he has furnished us with Viewing these as the result of one man's research in an inconsiderable portion of North America what a variety of new and splendid kinds would be the reward of those who should explore the more genial regions of Asia Africa and South America with equal diligence and information  We have hazarded an assertion which may seem inadmissible that the Phalaenae are infinitely more numerous than the Papiliones or any other tribe of insects Not that we possess more but because in every country that has been investigated experience justifies such opinion For instance in Great Britain we have only sixty Papiliones and by mere accident two or three local species have lately been added of the Phalaenae we have more than The same comparative proportion is observed throughout the countries of the European continent and it is singularly analogous that our opinion is confirmed by the recent discoveries of Mr Abbot in America also    Phalaena Atlas is the first species we have to notice It is the largest of the moth tribe  When Linnaeus described it few of the very large species of Phalaena were known We have two species from the interior of Africa that are larger than the Chinese  var  of Atlas and several others scarcely inferior in magnitude  and is in∣deed gigantic creature The species is common but not peculiar to China being found in other parts of Asia and in America The influence of climate is easily traced in the  varicties  from different countries that from Surinam is the largest and of the deepest colours The Chinese kind is the next in size the colours incline to orange and the anterior wings are more falcated or hooked at the ends We have two other Asiatic  varieties  still smaller with the wings extremely falcated  The larva of Phalaena Atlas is figured by  M Merian  in the  Insecta Surinamensia  plate it is about four inches in length green with a yellow stripe disposed longitudinally Upon each segment are four distinct round tubercles of a corallike orange colour which are surrounded with very delicate hairs The pupa is large and is inclosed in a web of an ochre colour The silk of this web is of a strong texture and it has been imagined if woven would be superior in durability to that of the common silk worm  Seba  has also represented the larva at fig plate vol  Thesaurus Naturae  It is nearly six inches in length and bulky in proportion the Phalaena is also larger than that figured by Merian which is a  small specimen of the Surinam kind According to Merian there are three broods of this insect in a year they are very common and feed on the orange trees Linnaeus says they adhere so tenaciously to the leaves that they can scarcely be taken off  Larva verticillata verrucis pilosis nec folliculos grandes tenaces vix extricandos  Linn Syst Nat    The common silk worm or Phalaena Mori is of this family and merits observation as a native of China The art of weaving its threads into silk is of the earliest date The discovery is attributed to the  Seres  a people of the East Indies supposed the Chinese  Velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia Seres  Virg Georg  II  In the days of Solomon we are told a woman named Pamphilia of the Island of Co was skilled in the art of making cloth of the silk brought from the country of the Seres The most ancient of the Chinese writers ascribe the invention to one of the women of the emperor  Hoang ti  named  Si ling  and in honour  Yuen fei  DU HALDE  Des Soycries  Les plus anciens écrivans de cet Empire en attribuent la découverte à une des femmes de l'Empereur  Hoang ti  nommée  Si ling  et furnommée par honneur  Yuen fei  When Rome degenerated into voluptuousness Persia its dependency furnished this article of luxury but it is supposed they were in∣debted to the Chinese for it and being supplied only in small quantities it was consequently dear In Rome it was so scarce as to be worn only by persons of the first distinction  The Chinese historians affirm that the discovery was considered at first of such importance that all the women in the palace of the emperor were engaged in rearing the insect and weaving its silk In after times the silk of China was a principal article of commerce but latterly its value has been materially lessened by the culture and fabrication of silk in other countries As the Chinese know little of the use of linen the silk is a staple article of their own consumption The jesuit missionaries mention several sorts of it in use among the Chinese some admired for beauty and others for durability It is gene∣rally supposed these are not merely the effect of different manufacture but are the produce of dis∣tinct insects  M Merian says in the description of the Surinam variety of Phalaena Atlas "Telam ducunt fortem quare bonum fore sericum rata istius aliquam collegi copiam in Belgium transmisi ubi eadem optima judicata est ut itaque si quis Erucas istas congregandi laborem non detrectaverit et bonae notae bombycem et maximum hinc lucrum sibi comparare posset" The thread of which this coccon's web is composed is so strong that it has been imagined it would make good silk I have brought some of it into Holland which has been esteemed such So that if any one would take the trouble to collect a number of these caterpillars they would be found good silk worms and produce great profit MERIANAbbot informs us the Moths of the Emperor tribe in general are called Silk worms by the people of Georgia and in the description of Phalaena cecropia is still more explicit for he says "the caterpillar spins on a twig The outside web is coarse the inner covered with silk like a silk worm's coccon It is said this silk has been carded spun and made into stockings and that it will wash like linen"  Abbot's Ins by Dr J E Smith  These insects are all of the same natural order P Cecropia is rather smaller but very similar to P Atlas and this information at least corroborates the assertion of Merian  An opinion that the Chinese rear several kinds of insects for the sake of their silk has long been prevalent Dr Lettsom proposes a query on this subject "Which species of moth or butterfly is it the caterpillar of which in China affords that strong grey kind of silk and how is it manufactured or wore How are these silk worms or caterpillars preserved fed and managed The introduction of such a new silk into England would be it useful acquistion and redeem entomology from the censure it is now branded with of being a mere curiosity void of any real utility  Naturalist and Traveller's Companion  " If  Lesser  and  Lyonet  are to be relied on The  Theologie des Insectes  answers this query "At this day there are to be found in China in the province of Canton silk worms in a wild state which without any care being taken of them make in the woods a kind of silk which the inhabitants afterwards gather from the trees It is grey without lustre and is used to make a very thick and strong cloth named there Kien Tcheon It may be washed like linen cloth and does not stain" A Gentleman resident in the East Indies speaks of a large Phalaena producing silk in that country "We have a beautiful silk worm northeast of Bengal that feeds on the Ricinus whence I call it Phalaena Ricini it is sea green with soft spines very large and voracious and spins a coarse but strong and useful silk The moth is of great size with elegant dark plumageIs it known to European Naturalists"  In a collection of papers published by  Dr ANDERSON  in  MADRAS M Le Bon Reaumur Roesel and several others have attempted to weave the silk of spiders as a substitute for that of silk worms but their experiments rather amuse and point out the ingenuity of the proposers than promise to be useful for after many trials it appears that the silk of spiders would be inferior in lustre and far more expensive than that of silk worms Sir G Staunton alludes to these experiments in his descrip∣tion of the Java forests "In some open spots were found webs of spiders woven with threads of so strong a texture as not easily to be divided without a cutting instrument they seemed to render feasible the idea of him who in the southern provinces of Europe proposed a manufacture from spiders' threads which is so ridiculous to the eyes of those who have only viewed the flimsy webs suck insects spin in England"Many other substances of a soft texture have also been wrought into a variety of trifling articles as gloves stockings c of the fibres of Asbestos earth or mountain flax beard of the large  Pinna  shell c c  Sir G Staunton speaks of the culture of silk worms in China but only of the common sort It will gratify curiosity if not prove advantageous should future obververs ascertain what kind of  insect the Chinese appropriate to making silk and whether P Atlas is of the number as has been conjectured  *  Phalaena militaris  **  Phalaena lectrix  PHALAENA MILITARIS  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Wings spread Yellow with violet spots ends of the wings

therefore require a deep magnifier to determine then with accuracy We have examined those parts in the greater number of the species Fabricius has described and find his characters agree except in one instance but which alone proves the impracticability of adopting the whole of his system he describes  Libellula Chinensis  and refers to the only figure that has been given of it in one of the plates of Edwards's Natural History of Birds Had he ever seen and examined this rare species he must have referred it to his genus  Agrion  each of the lips being bisid or twoclest as in Libellula virgo and puellathe essential characteristic of the genus Agrion for the mouths of the Libellulae of Fabricius differ altogether in structure and are not notched in the slightest degree as Libellula clavata ferruginea maculata and the European species Libellula depressa will sufficiently illustrate  We reject his generic definition because it clearly belongs to the Linnaean Libellulae Libellula clavata must be placed with the European L grandis and forcipataIt is scarce and has never been figured before  LIBELLULA INDICA  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Wings yellow barred with brown changeable to bright purple

genus known yet it is of sufficient magnitude to excite terror and disgust To an European who has seen only the indigenous spiders of his own country a species five or six inches in length and nearly the same in breadth must appear a frightful creature Aranea Maculata sometimes exceeds that size but it has not the forbidding aspect of most insects of the same genus The legs are unusually long and the body slender In its general appearance it resembles some kinds of the  Phalangiae  that are known in Eng∣land by the vulgar name  Harvest men  being generally seen about that time of the year  It has been observed that nature oftentimes adorns the most deformed and loathsome of her creatures in the richest display of colours and this is especially noticed in many sorts of snakes toads lizards c Spiders seem also of this description to a form the most hideous we frequently find united a brilliance of colours and elegance of marking that is scarcely excelled by any of the butterfly tribethe most beautiful of all lepidopterous insects Our present subject is a striking proof of the latter part of this observation The three figures in our plate of Aranca Maculata exhibit a front and a profile view of the insect together with the front of the head at the third figure The head is furnished with two very strong black mandi∣bles each terminated in an extremely acute point The fore part of the thorax which is wholly of a fine silky appearance and the colour of silver bending over the mandibles in the form of an arch or circular headpiece give it the resemblance of a black head with a crown of silver on the brow This appearance is heightened in no small degree by three rugged prominences one in the centre and another on each side on the upper part and by the minute black eyes which like those of most spiders sparkle with the lustre  of small gems These eyes are eight in number four are placed immediately in the front of the silvercoloured circular front piece and on each side are two more at equal distances but rather in oblique positions  The body is really beautiful the chief colour is deep brown strongly tinged with bright purple a broad stripe of orange colour passes down the abdomen from the thorax to the apex the whole is elegantly marked with a variety of creamcoloured lines and spots intersecting each other Very little hair is found on any part of this spider except on the thorax which being rubbed off discovers a hard testaceous black substance beneath  Fabricius is the only author who has described this insect it has never been figured in any work what∣ever as appears by the latest works of Fabricius and our own observation It is not always the most decisive method to determine the species from a concise description but this is sometimes unavoidable and in the present instance the description given by Fabricius accords in every respect with our specimen The only insect with which it could possibly be confounded is Aranea Pilipes which also has never been figured it differs however from Aranea Maculata in the very hairy clothing of the legs and it has also two silver stripes down the back a striking specific distinction to separate it from our insect It is also a native of the East Indies but not of China that we are informed  Cancer mammillaris  CANCER MAMMILLARIS  GENERIC CHARACTER  Feet eight claws two Eyes two distant from each other and placed on a kind of footstalk moveable Palpi two large furnished with claws Tail articulated and without sting  SPECIFIC CHARACTER  Thorax nearly oval spinous Three spines on each side

of  Cancri  described that seems to agree with our specimen The specific character assigned by that author is however less satisfactory than the general description he has added The two red spots are very characteristic  Fabricius met with this creature in the cabinet of  Spengler  and notes its  habitat  China It is worthy of remark that this is the only species of the  Cancer  genus Fabricius mentions as a native of that country  CANCER MANTIS  SPECIFIC CHARACTER AND SYNONYMS  Hand claws without tarsi compressed hooked serrated with teeth Body angulated Tail serrated and armed with spines

subangulato cauda serrato spinosa  Fab Ent Syst T    p    The Linnaean  Cancri  are numerous and include many species not less singular in appearance than the extraordinary creature before us Indeed some species are so extremely different from the rest both in structure and manners of life that we cannot hesitate in concluding the Linnaean character of the genus defective and indefinite This may be observed in several of the species Linnaeus himself described and throughout a more extensive number of those discovered since the time of that author It is evident Linnaeus could never reconcile the subdivisions of the two principal families the  Brachyuri  and  Macrouri  or crabs with short and long tails and later naturalists have ventured with propriety to alter this part of his arrangement The  Pagarus Hippa Scyllaris Astacus Squilla  and  Gammarus  are so many new genera formed of the Linnaean tribes of  Cancri  in the last System of Fabricius The genus to which Fabricius retains the name  Cancer  is distinguished from the rest by having four short filiform antennae with the extreme articulation bifid as we observe in the preceding species This author follows Degeer in describing the Cancer Mantis and alters the generic name to Squilla he observes that this genus is entirely distinct from the  Cancri  and we are of the same opinion but adhere to the Linnaean genera be∣cause the species  Mantis  was described by Linnaeus and it may be improper therefore to remove it to a new genus in any partial survey of his system The Cancer Mantis is not peculiar to China

the temperate parts of Asia would be a terrestrial paradise were it not for the multitude of troublesome insects and reptiles with which they are infested In a well cultivated country like China many of these creatures can sscarcely find shelter but such as harbour in the walls or furniture of human dwellings are as abundant in that as any other country that lies within or near the tropics Amongst the latter none produce more terrible effects than the Centipede whose poison is as venomous as that of the scorpion which also is a native of China  Sir G Staunton mentions a remarkable circumstance that occurred during the late embassy to China The ambassador and his suite were accommodated in a temple near the suburbs of Tongchoofoo "In some of the apartments the priests had suffered scorpions and scolopendras to harbour through neglect These noisome creatures were known only by description to some of the gentlemen in the embassy who had not visited the southern parts of Europe the sight of such for the first time excited a degree of hor∣ror in their minds and it seemed to them to be a sufficient objection to the country that it produced these animals" Sir George however adds that no accident happened in that instanceThe species of Scolopendra he alludes to is probably  Morsitans  which is common in many parts of the world but is par∣ticularly sound of a frightful size and in vast abundance in the two Indies  Many authors have described this creature In the voluminous works of Seba we find several speci∣mens of it from different countries differing materially in size and some trifling particulars but all pos∣sessing the distinguishing characters of Scolopendra Morsitans The largest of these exceed our figure in magnitude being near fourteen inches in length this he calls  Millepeda major  ex nova Hispania His figure of  Millepeda Africanae  is about the size of our Chinese specimen He has also a third and fourth figure  Millepeda Orientalis  and  Millepeda Celonica mas  the latter is the same length as our figure but the body is very narrow Millepeda Orientalis is also the same length but the body is very broad Some of these insects are not four inches in length  Authors agree that they vary exceedingly in size  These creatures differ from most insects in their manner of growth insomuch that it it impossible to ascertain when they are of their full size The segments of the body increase as they advance in age which circumstance renders it difficult oftentimes to determine the spe∣cies without a minute examination of its other characters  and colour De Geer describes them to be some∣times deep reddish brown at others the colour of yellow ochre The figure in Catesby's Natural History of Carolina is light brown we have specimens of a livid yellow and have seen others strongly tinged with red  The last pair of legs are considerably larger than the others and are armed with small black spines The legs terminate in very sharp hooks or nails of a shining black colour All the other legs are also fur∣nished with a smaller nail of the same shape and colour  M Gronovius says that all its feet are very venemous but the most formidable of its weapons are the two sharp hooked instruments that are placed under the mouth and with which it destroys its prey  Lewenhoeck having examined thes instruments with a microscope he found a small opening at the extremity of each and a channel from them into the body of the creature Through this channel he sup∣posed poses the Scolopendra emits the poisonous fluid into the wound it makes with the hooked instrument That author further remarks that he has seen a liquor on that part of living scolopendras A figure of these instruments on the under side of the head is represented in one of the dissections in our plate  The same author wishing to ascertain the influence of the poison of Scolopendra morsitans placed a large fly within its reach The Scolopendra at first took it between a pair of its middle feet then passed it from one pair of feet to the next till the fly was brought under the sharp pointed instrument or crotchets at the head which it plunged into the fly and it died instantly Notwithstanding this experi∣ment De Geer Catesby and other authors assert that its bite seldom proves fatal to larger animals but all agree that its poison is as dangerous as that of the scorpion  This Scolopendra has eight eyes they are very small four are placed on each side of the head near the antennae In the dissections a figure is given to exhibit the manner in which the four eyes are placed on one side  INDEX ACCORDING TO THE SYSTEMA NATURAE OF  LINNAEUS  COLEOPTERA  SCARABAEUS Pl  nasicornis  seniculus  Midas  Bucephalus  Molossus  Sacer  Leei  cinctus  Cetonia Chinensis
