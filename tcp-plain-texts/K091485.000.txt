Gentlemen  are you the Incouragers of Learn∣ing and the Rewarders of Merit there are Numbers to witness the one and your  Clergy  may witness the other  FOR not to mention you  in your private Capacities as Promoters of Common Lear∣ning as the Helpers and Sup∣porters of  Schools of  CHARI∣TY one great Blessing of your Community You in your publick Stations uphold a  no∣bler Literature  and

Your most obliged Most obedient And most humble Servant  HENRY BOURNE  THE PREFACE  T  HE following Sheets are a few of that vast Number of  Ceremonies  and  Opi∣nions  which are held by the Common People such as they solely or generally observe For tho' some of them have been of National and others perhaps of universal Obser∣vance yet at present they would have little or no Being if not observed among the Vulgar  I would not be thought a Reviver of old Rites and Ceremonies to the Burden∣ing of the People nor an Abolisher of in∣nocent Customs which are their Pleasures and Recreations I aim at nothing but a Regulation of those which are in Being amongst them which they themselves are far from thinking burdensome and aboli∣shing such only as are sinful and wicked  Some of the Customs they hold have been originally good tho' at present they retain little of their primitive Purity the true Meaning and Design of them be∣ing either lost or very much in the Dark through Folly and Superstition To wipe off therefore the Dust they have contract∣ed to clear them of Superstition and make known their End and Design may turn to some Account and be of Advan∣tage whereas observing them in the pre∣sent  Way is not only of no Advantage but of very great Detriment  Others they hold are really sinful not∣withstanding in outward Appearance they seem very harmless being a Scandal to Religion and an encouraging of Wicked∣ness And therefore to aim at abolish∣ing these will I hope be no Crime tho' they be the Diversions of the People  As to the Opinions they hold they are almost all superstitious being gene∣rally either the Produce of Heathenism or the Inventions of indolent  Monks  who having nothing else to do were the Forgers of many silly and wicked Opi∣nions to keep the World in Awe and Ig∣norance And indeed the ignorant Part of the World is still so aw'd that they follow the idle Traditions of the one  more than the Word of GOD and have more Dependance upon the lucky Omens of the other than his Providence more Dread of their unlucky ones than his Wrath and Punishment  The regulating therefore of these Opi∣nions and Customs is what I propos'd by the following Compositions whatever has been suggested to the contrary And as to the Menaces of some and the Censures of others I neither fear nor regard them I shall be always ready to own any Mi∣stake and in what I justly may to vin∣dicate my self  THE CONTENTS  CHAP I  O  F the SoulBell its Antiquity the Reason of its Institution the Be∣nefits and Advantage of it an Exhortation to the Use of it ac∣cording to

Institution the Benefit and Ad∣vantage of it an Exhortation to the Use of it according to its first Institution  T  HE Ceremony of Tolling the Bell at the Time of Death seems to be as ancient as the having of Bells themselves we are told  Bingham  's Orig Eccl Lib  it was about the seventh Century when Bells were first in the Church and that venerable  Bede  is the first  that mentions them If this be true then it is as true that the Tolling of the Bell was insti∣tuted about that Time for where our Coun∣tryman mentions the Word  Campana  or Bell there it also is that we find a Bell made use of for the Dead  Haec tunc in dormitorio sororum pausans exaudivit subito in aere notum campanae sonum quo ad orationes ex∣citari vel convocati solebant cum quis eorum de seculo  uisset evocatus  Bed Eccl Hist Lib    Cap    For at the Death of the Abbess St  Hilda  he tells us that one of the Si∣sters of a distant Monastery as she was sleeping thought she heard the well known Sound of that Bell which called them to Prayers when any of them had departed this Life But be that as it will it is evident that the Bell was tolled up∣on this Occasion about  Bede  's Time and conse∣quently that the Ceremony is as ancient as his Days  THE Reason why this Custom was instituted was not as some seem to imagine for no other End than to acquaint the Neighbourhood that such a Person was dead but chiefly that who∣ever heard the Noise of the Bell should put up their Prayers for the Soul Thus the Fa∣ther  abovementioned tells us again  Quod cum illa audisset suscitavit cunctas sorores in ecclesiam convocatas orationibus psalmis pro anima ma∣tris operam dare monuit  ibid  That she who presided in this Monastery had no sooner heard this than she raised all the Sisters and called them into the Church where she exhorted them to pray fervently and sing a  Re∣quiem  for the Soul of their Mother  Cassalion  also upon this Place of  Bede  says  That  Et talis ritus etiam de praesenti servatur in  Anglia  ut cum quis decessit statim campana propriae illius Pa∣rochiae speciali quodam modo sonat per aliquod temporis spatiumQuamvis  Angli  negent modo orationes suf∣fragia defunctis proficua non aliam tamen in hoc ab illis rationem potui percipere quam quod talis sonus sit ritus antiquae ecclesiae  Anglicanae Cassali  de vet Sac Christ Rit P  the same Custom is still observed in  England  that as soon as any hath departed this Life the Bell be∣longing to the Parish he liv'd in was immedi∣ately tolled and for some TimeAnd tho'  says he  the  English  now deny that Prayers are of any Service to the Dead yet I could meet with no other Account of this Ceremony than that it was a Custom of the old Church of  England  AND for this Reason it is that this Custom was first observed and should be still retain'd among us  viz  That the Prayers of the Faith∣ful may be assisting to the Soul and certainly it might be more profitably retain'd were it so order'd that the Bell should be tolled before the Person's Departure as was undoubtedly de∣signed when this Ceremony was continued that good Men might give him their Prayers Was this always so observed there might be some  Moses  amongst the Number of the Faithful whose Prayers could prevail upon GOD to beat back  the Amalekites of Darkness  some whose  Faith  might remove a  Mountain of Sins  and some whose Tears procure a Multitude of Mer∣cies O the Comfort of  the Forgivenness of Sins  Of  being guided safely through the Sha∣dow of Death  Of arriving securely at the Hea∣venly Country What is it that Prayer can't obtain  BUT tho' the Wickedness and Impenitency of the dying Person be such as that the Pray∣ers of the Faithful will not be sufficient to avert the Wrath and Punishment of a justly incensed  GOD yet as this can be only known to GOD it will not discharge Men from recommending him to the Divine Mercy in the most passionate and affectionate Manner They thereby ex∣press the most laudable Zeal the most disinte∣rested Charity and whilst they are so sollici∣tous for the Happiness and Welfare of other Mens Souls they cannot but be thereby influ∣enced to have the greatest Concern for their own and be both encouraged and directed to proceed with an holy Emulation  from Strength to Strength  and endeavour as the  Heb vi  Apostle ad∣vises  to go on to Perfection  BUT alas we are fallen into Times of such Irreligion and Prejudice such Contempt of An∣tiquity and such too great Reformation that what with Indolence on one Hand and Igno∣rance on the other what with no Zeal on this Side and too  Among the many Objections of the  Brownists  it is laid to the Charge of the Church of  England  That tho' we deny the Doctrine of Purgatory and teach the contrary yet how well our Practice suits with it may be considered in our Ring∣ing of hallowed Bells for the Soul Bish  Hall  cont  Brown  false a one on that we either neglect the most decent Ceremonies of Religion  or we think it is Religion to have no Ceremo∣nies at all No Wonder then that  in the Midst of such a crooked and perverse Generation  when the most of Men are negligent of themselves they are also negligent of others No Wonder that when there is such a general Contempt of Religion and Men are careless of their own Souls they are not careful for the Souls of their Friends  BUT it is called  In a VestryBook belonging to the Chappel of  AllSaints  in  Newcastle  upon  Tyne  it is observeable That the Tolling of the Bell is not mention'd in the Parish Accounts from the Year    till    when we find it order'd to be tolled again At a Vestry holden  January  st  Whereas for some Years past the collecting of the Duty for Bell and Tolling hath been forborn and laid aside which hath much lessen'd the Revenue of the Church by which and such like Means it is brought into Dilapidations and hav∣ing now taken the same into serious Consideration and fully debated the Objections made by some against the same and having had the Judgment of our Ministers con∣cerning any Superstition that might be in it which being made clear it is this Day order'd That from henceforth the ChurchOfficer appointed thereunto do collect the same and bring the Money unto the ChurchWardens and that those who desire to have the Use of the Bells may freely have them as formerly paying the accustom'd Fees  It is certain they laid it aside because they thought it superstitious and it is probable if they had not wanted Mo∣ney they had not seen the contrary  Popish and Superstitious  for what true Reason I know not Did we in∣deed imagine with the Papists that there is any  We call them SoulBells for that they signifie the De∣parture of the Soul not for that they help the Passage of the Soul Bish  Hall  cont  Brown  P    Virtue or extraordinary Power in a Bell that it is  Item ut Daemones tinnitu campanarum Christianos ad preces concitantium terreantur Formula vero bap∣tizandi seu benedicendi campanas antiqua est  Durant Lib C    S    hallowed by Baptism and drives away the Spirits of Darkness then it might justly be called Superstition and therefore just∣ly abolished But when we retain the Custom only to procure the Prayers of the Faithful for a departing Soul it would surely be of Advan∣tage to observe it if the  Prayers of a righteous Man avail  any Thing at all which if we may believe an inspir'd Apostle are of very great Efficacy and Validity  ART thou then attending a Friend in his last Moments Art thou careful for his Soul and sollicitous for his Salvation Dost thou wish him safe  through the Valley of Death to the ever∣lasting Hills  Wouldst thou have the good An∣gels  protect him and be his  Shield against the Powers of Darkness  In short wouldst thou have him crown'd with the Joys of  Paradise  Be assured then that the Prayers of good Men will very much contribute to the gaining of these Things But how shall they then pray for him if they know not of his Departure And how can they know that without the Tol∣ling of the Bell Do thou therefore put in Practice this decent and profitable Custom not as our Age generally does after the Death of thy Friend but before it before he leave the World when the Prayers of good Men can assist him and facilitate his Journey into the other Life  OR art thou  working in the Field or grind∣ing at the Mill  Remember then when thou hearest the Sound of the Bell for one departing that thou put up thy Prayers for him Be thy Business what it will it will always permit thee to say at least  LORD now lettest thou thy Servant depart in Peace  Or to use the Words of St  Oswald  when he and his Sol∣diers were ready to be slain  LORD have  Mercy on the Soul of thy  Oravit ad dominum pro animabus exercitus sui Un∣de dicunt in proverbio Deus miserere animabus dixit  Os∣waldus  cadens in terram  Bed Eccl L    C    It is used  says  Bede    even to a Proverb  That he died praying  for when the Enemy had surrounded him and he saw himself about to be slain he prayed unto the LORD for the Souls of his Army Hence it is that the Proverb comes  LORD have Mercy upon the Soul as St  Oswald  said when he fell to the Earth  Which Proverb in all Probability hath been the Original of this present National Saying  When the Bell begins to toll  LORD have Mercy on the Soul  Servant  It will not be long till thou thy self shalt have Occasion for such Prayers till thou come to die and en∣ter on thy Journey to the other State If then  thou hast been merciful thou shalt obtain Mercy  if by thy Prayers thou hast assisted the Souls of thy Brethren thou shalt either be remembred in the Prayers of good Men or surely these thy Prayers for others will be of Service to thy self also at that dreadful Hour  BUT now it may be objected That as the Bell is seldom tolled till after the Person's De∣parture it is to no Purpose to pray for the Soul nay to pray for it would be praying for the Dead And since that is repugnant to the Do∣ctrine  of our Church our Prayers at that Time had much better be omitted  INDEED it is too true this Custom is not so common as it should be but however it is so much observed as will be able to vindicate the putting up of constant Prayers I know se∣veral Religious Families in this Place and I hope it is so in other Places too who always observe it whenever the melancholly Season offers and therefore it will at least sometimes happen when we put up our Prayers constantly at the Tolling of the Bell that we shall pray for a Soul departing And tho' it be granted that it will oftner happen otherwise as the re∣gular Custom is so little followed yet that can be no harmful praying for the Dead We be∣lieve that the Soul is but departing and it is charitably done to offer up our Prayers And therefore when it proves otherwise  our  Psal xxxiv  Pray∣er shall turn into our own Bosom  and like as that Peace which the Disciples wished to an unworthy House returned to the Disciples a∣gain  so tho' our Prayers at that Time may be of no Service to the Soul yet they will be of no Disservice to us They will return to us a∣gain but it will be no Fault to have misplaced them  PRAYERS upon this OCCASION from Bishop  TAYLOR  I  O  HOLY and most Gracious JE∣SU we humbly recommend the Soul of thy Servant into thy Hands thy most merci∣ful Hands Let thy blessed Angels stand in Ministry about thy Servant and defend him from the Violence and Malice of all his ghost∣ly Enemies And drive far from him all the Spirits of Darkness  Amen  II  LORD receive the Soul of this thy Ser∣vant Enter not into Judgment with  him Spare him whom thou hast redeemed with thy most precious Blood And deliver him for whose Sake thou didst suffer Death from all Evil and Mischief from the Crafts and Assaults of the Devil from the Fear of Death and from everlasting Death  Amen  III  LORD impute not unto him the Follies of his Youth nor any of the Errors and Miscarriages of his Life But strengthen him in his Agony and carry him safely through his last Distress Let not his Faith waver nor his Hope fail nor his Charity be disordered Let him die in Peace and rest in Hope and rise in Glory  Amen  IV  LORD we know and believe assuredly that whatsoever is under thy Custo∣dy cannot be taken out of thy Hands nor by all the Violences of Hell robbed of thy Protection Preserve the Work of thy Hands rescue him from all Evil and let his Portion  be with the Patriarchs and Prophets with the Apostles and Martyrs and all thy holy Saints in the Arms of CHRIST in the Bo∣som of Felicity and in the Kingdom of GOD for ever  Amen  V  O SAVIOUR of the World who by thy Cross and precious Blood hast re∣deemed us save and help this thy departing Servant we beseech thee O LORD  Amen  VI  O Almighty LORD who art a most strong Tower to all them that put their Trust in thee to whom all Things in Hea∣ven in Earth and under the Earth do bow and obey be now and evermore his Defence and make him to know and feel by a pow∣erful Sense of thy Goodness that there is no other Name under Heaven given to Man in whom and through whom we may receive Health and Salvation but only the Name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST  Amen  VII  O LORD unto thy gracious Mercy and Protection we commit him O GOD the Father bless him and keep him O GOD the Son make thy Face to shine upon him and be gracious unto him O GOD the Ho∣ly Ghost lift up thy Countenance upon him and give him thy Peace both now and ever∣more  Amen  CHAP II  Of Watching with the Dead  W  ATCHING with the Corps was an ancient Custom of the Church and every where pra∣ctised They were wont to sit by it from the Time of its Death till its Exportation to the Grave either in the House it died in or in the Church it self Agreeable to this we read in St  Austin  That as they watched his Mother  Monica  Psalterium arripuit  Euodius  cantare caepit psalmum cui respondebamus omnes domus Miserecordiam judi∣cium cantabo tibi Domine  Aug Lib    Confes C    Euodius  took the  Psalter  and began to sing a  Psalm  which the whole Family answered with that of the Psalmist  David I will sing of Mercy and  Judgment unto thee O LORD will I sing  And we are told  Ad ecclesiam antelucana hora qua defunctus est cor∣pus ipsius portatum est ibique eadem fuit nocte quam vigilavimus in pascha  Greg Turon de Gloria Confes C    That at the Death of St  Ambrose  his Body was carried into the Church before Day the same Hour he died It was the Night before  Easter  and they watched with him there  HOW unlike to this ancient Custom of Watch∣ing is the modern one of locking up the Corps in a Room and leaving it there alone How un∣like to this decent Manner of Watching is that Watching of the Vulgar which is a Scene of Sport and Drinking and Lewdness Watching at that Time with a dear Friend is the last Kindness and Respect we can shew him and how unfriendly is it to change it into Negli∣gence and too great Resignation How unchri∣stian instead of a becoming Sorrow and decent Gravity to put on an unbecoming Joy and un∣decent Pastime  CHAP III  Of following the Corps to the Grave what it is an Emblem of Of carry∣ing Greens in our Hand what it sig∣nifies what Use it may be of Of Psalmody its Antiquity the Advan∣tage and Use of it  I  T hath been observed among all Nations both in the Heathen and the Christian World as a becoming and profitable Cere∣mony to follow the Corps to the Grave The Heathens observed it  Praecedenti pompa funebri vivi sequuntur tanquam handmulto post morituri  Al ab Alex Lib    P    t Pol Vir Lib    C    P    be∣cause it presented to them what would shortly follow how they themselves should be so car∣ried  out and laid down in the Grave The going of the Corps before shewed that their Friend was gone before them to the State of Death and their following after was as much as to say that they must also in a short Time fol∣low him thither For this Reason the Christian also observes the Custom and may if he plea∣ses as he follows the Body to the Grave en∣tertain himself with a pious Meditation upon it in such like Thoughts as these of the Psalmist  Psal xc  Thou art GOD from Everlasting and World without End Thou turnest Man to Destruction again Thou sayest Come again ye Children of Men For a thousand Years in thy Sight are but as Yesterday seeing that is past as a Watch in the Night As soon as thou scatterest them they are even as a Sleep and fade away suddenly like the Grass In the Morning it is green and grow∣eth up but in the Evening it is cut down dried up and withered Do thou therefore O LORD  Psal xxxix  let me know my End and the Number of my Days that I may be certified how long I have to live Behold thou hast made my Days as it  were a Span long and mine Age is nothing in re∣spect of Thee and verily every Man living is al∣together Vanity And now LORD what is my Hope Truly my Hope is even in Thee Deliver me from all mine Offences and O spare me a little that I may recover my Strength before I go hence and be no more seen  Such Thoughts as these of our Friend's and of our own Mortality would excite us to prepare for our own Change  AND as this Form of Procession is an Em∣blem of our dying shortly after our Friend so the carrying of Ivy or Laurel or Rosemary or some of those EverGreens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality It is as much as to say That tho' the Body be dead yet the Soul is EverGreen and always in Life It is not like the Body and those other Greens which die and revive again at their proper Seasons no  Autumn  nor  Winter  can make a Change in it but it is unalterably the same perpetually in Life and never dying  THE  Romans  and other Heathens upon this Occasion made Use of Cypress which being  once cut will never flourish nor grow any more as an Emblem of their dying for ever and be∣ing no more in Life But instead of that the ancient Christians used the Things before men∣tioned they  Hadera quoque vel laurus hujusmodi quae semper servant virorem in sarchophago corpori substernuntur ad significandum quod qui moriuntur in Christo vivere nec desinunt Nam licet mundo moriantur secundum corpus tamen secundum animam vivunt reviviscunt Deo  Du∣rand Rit Lib    C    de Offic Mort  laid them under the Corps in the Grave to signifie that they who die in CHRIST do not cease to live For tho' as to the Body they die to the World yet as to their Souls they live to GOD  AND as the carrying of these EverGreens is an Emblem of the Soul's Immortality so it is also of the Resurrection of the Body For as these Herbs are not entirely pluck'd up but only cut down and will at the returning Season revive and spring up again so the Bo∣dy like them is but cut down for a while and will rise and shoot up again at the Resurrection For as the Prophet  Isaiah  says  lxiii  Our Bones shall flourish like an Herb  IT was customary  Greg C  among the ancient  Jews  as they returned from the Grave to pluck up the Grass two or three Times and then throw it behind them saying these Words of the Psal∣mist  They shall flourish out of the City like Grass upon the Earth  Which they did to shew that the Body tho' dead should spring up again as the Grass Thus by these two ancient Cere∣monies we have placed before our Eyes our Mortality and Immortality the one speaks the Death of the Body the other the Life of the Soul nay and the Life of the Body too for like that Herb we carry it is not quite pluck'd up but shall one Day be alive again When it hath laid in the Earth the  Winter  Season the Continuance of this World and the Warmth and Influence of the  Spring  is come the joyful Spring of the Resurrection it shall be enliven'd and shoot up and eternally flourish  Greg C  For this Corruptible must put on Incorruption and this Mortal must put on Immortality O Death where is thy Sting O Grave where is thy Victo∣ry Thanks be to GOD who giveth us the Victo∣ry through our LORD JESUS CHRIST  Cor i  THERE is another Custom used in some Places at the Procession of Funerals which pays a due Honour to the Dead and gives Com∣fort and Consolation to the Living and that is the carrying out the Dead with Psalmody This was an ancient Custom of the Church For in some of the earliest Ages they carried out their Dead to the Grave with singing of Psalms and Hymns Thus  Socrates  tells us That when the Body of  Babylas  the Martyr was removed by the Order of  Julian  the Apostate the Chri∣stians  Hoi kata  c Soc Lib    C    with their Women and Children rejoy∣ced and sung Psalms all the Way as they bore the Corps from  Dauphne  to  Antioch  Thus was  Epitaphlum  Hierom Ep    Paula  buried at  Bethlehem  thus did St  An∣thony  bury  Paul  the Hermite and thus were the Generality of Men buried after the three first Centuries when Persecution ceased In Imitation of this it is still customary in seve∣ral Parts of this Nation to carry out the Dead with singing of Psalms and Hymns of Triumph to shew that they have ended their spiritual War∣fare that they have finished their Course with  Ibid  in Vit  Paul  Joy and are become Conquerors which sure∣ly is a Matter of no little Consolation for the loosing of our Friend And how becoming is it to pay such Honour to the Body How is it imitating the blessed Angels who rejoyced at Meeting of the Soul and carrying it to Hea∣ven For as they rejoyce  at her Conversion on Earth  so most certainly they rejoyce at her go∣ing to Heaven And as they rejoyce at the car∣rying of the Soul thither so we in Imitation of them at the carrying out the Body to the Grave They rejoyce that the Soul hath got out of a World of Sin we that the Body out of a World of Trouble they that the Soul can sin no more we that the Body can no more suf∣fer they that the Soul enjoys Glory and Hap∣piness we that the Body rests from its Labours  WHEN therefore we attend the Corps of a Neighbour or Relation and this decent Cere∣mony is perform'd let it also have a Share of our Thoughts and excite in us Joy and Com∣fort and Thanksgiving and Praise And when these Customs are so observed they will be of great Advantage to us making us still fitter  for the Heavenly Life And surely a Thing of this Good and Profit is much to be preferr'd to what hath in it nothing but Undecency and Irreverence such is our laughing and jesting and telling of News when we accompany a Neighbour to the Grave There is indeed a Mean to be observed as in all other Things so in this we must neither be too sad nor too merry we must not be so merry as to throw off all the Signs of Affection and Love all the Tokens of Esteem and Humanity nor must we  Thess i  sorrow even as others which have no Hope But we must  Jam v  be so merry as to be able to sing Psalms and so afflicted as to be excited to pray  CHAP IV  Of Garlands in Country Churches Of strawing Flowers on the Grave the Antiquity of these Customs the Inno∣cency of them  I  N some Country Churches 'tis cu∣stomary to hang  a Garland of Flowers  over the Seats of  deceased Virgins  as a Token of Esteem and Love and an Emblem of their Reward in the Heavenly Church  THIS Custom perhaps may be look'd upon as sprung from that ancient Custom of the Hea∣thens of  crowning  their  Corps  with  Garlands  in Token of Victory But Mr  Bingham  tells us That we find not this Custom used by the  Ancients  in their  FuneralRites  For as he ob∣serves  the Heathen in  Minutius  makes it one Topick of Accusation against them  Min P  Coronas etiam sepulchris denegatis  Bing Vol    P    That they did not crown their Sepulchres  BUT if they did not crown them after the Manner of the Heathens they had a Custom of using Crowns of Flowers if we may believe  Cassalion  who tells us  Fuit quoque mos ad capita virginum apponendi flo∣rum coronas  c Cass de Vet Sacr Christ P    It was a Custom of the ancient Christians to place Crowns of Flow∣ers at the Heads of deceased Virgins for which he quotes  Damascen Gregory Nyssen  St  Jerom  and St  Austin  And this hath probably been the Original of this Custom among the Vulgar  THAT other Custom of  strawing Flowers  upon the  Graves  of their departed Friends is also derived from a Custom of the ancient Church For it was usual in those Times for the common Sort of People to straw the Graves of their Friends with various Flowers Of this there are two notable Instances taken No∣tice of by  Cassalion  and several other Ritualists  The one is that of St  Ambrose  in his  Funeral Oration  on the Death of  Valentinian  Nec ego floribus tumulum ejus aspergam sed spiri∣tum ejus Christi odore perfundam spargant alii plenis li∣lia calathis Nobis lilium est Christus Hoc reliquias ejus sacrabo  Ambros Orat Funebri de obitu Valentin  I will not sprinkle his Grave with Flowers but pour on his Spirit the Odour of CHRIST Let others scatter Baskets of Flowers CHRIST is our Lilly and with this will I consecrate his Relicks  THE other is that of St  Jerom  in his E∣pistle to  Pammachius  upon the Death of his Wife  Caeteri mariti super tumulos conjugum spargunt vio∣las rosas lilia floresque purpureos dolorem pectoris his officiis consolantur  Pammachius  noster sanctam favil∣lam ossaque veneranda eleemosynae balsamis rigat  Hieron Epist ad Pammachium de obitu Uxoris  Whilst other Husbands strawed Vio∣lets and Roses and Lillies and purple Flow∣ers upon the Graves of their Wives and com∣forted themselves with such like Offices  Pam∣machius  bedew'd her Ashes and venerable Bones with the Balsom of Alms  NOW these Instances tho' they justly com∣mend these other Actions and wisely prefer them to the Ceremonies of adorning Graves with  Flowers Yet they no Way decry these ancient Customs These lower Marks of Esteem and Honour which the  Vulgar  paid to the Remains of their Friends were in themselves harmless and innocent and had no Censure and as they were so so should the present Customs be with∣out any being full as harmless and innocent as the other  CHAP V  Of Bowing towards the Altar at the first coming into the Church a Custom ge∣nerally observed by ignorant People its Meaning and Antiquity  W  E may observe the Generality of old People among the Com∣monalty as they enter into the Church to turn their Fa∣ces towards the  Altar  and bow or kneel that Way This no Doubt is the Remains of that ancient Custom of the Church of worshipping toward the East For in the an∣cient Church they worshipped that Way upon several Accounts  First  That by so worship∣ping they might lift up their Minds to GOD who is called the Light and the Creator of  Light And therefore St  Austin  says  Cum ad orationem stamus ad orientem covertimur unde caelum surgit c Ut admoneatur animus ad natu∣ram excellentiorem se convertere id est ad Dominum  Aug de Serm Domini in Mont Lib    Cap    When we pray standing we turn our Faces to the East from whence the Day springs that we might be reminded of turning to a more excellent Nature namely The LORD  Secondly  That foras∣much as Man was driven out of  Paradise  which is towards the East he ought to look that Way which is an Emblem of his Desire to return thither St  Damascen  therefore tells us That  St  Damasc Lib    C    Orthod Fid  because the Scripture says That GOD plan∣ted  Paradise  in  Eden  towards the East where he  placed the Man which he had formed  whom he punish'd with Banishment upon his Transgres∣sion and made him dwell over against  Paradise  in the Western Part we therefore pray  says he  being in Quest of our ancient Country and as it were  panting  after it do worship GOD that Way  Thirdly  It was used when any were baptized They first turn'd their Faces to the West and so renounc'd the Devil and then to the East and made their Covenant with CHRIST  Last∣ly  They prayed that Way believing that our SAVIOUR would come to Judgment from that Quarter of the Heavens  For as the Lightning cometh out of the East and shineth unto the West so shall the Coming of the Son of Man be and he is to come in like Manner as he ascended  And that he ascended up Eastward from Mount  Oli∣vet  St  Damasc Lib    C    Orthod Fid  Damascen  assures us For  says he  when he ascended into Heaven he was taken up Eastward and his Disciples worshipped him that Way And therefore chiefly it was that in the ancient Church they prayed with their Faces to the East and that many of our own Church at this Day turn their Faces to that Quarter of the World at the Repetition of the Creed  WHAT may more confirm this and speak it to have been the universal Opinion of the Church is the ancient Custom of burying the Corps with the Feet to the East and the Head to the West which Custom is continued to this Day in the whole Church of  England  This was observed for the same Reason That at the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment from  the oriental Part of Heaven our Bodies might be found in a praying Posture with their Faces towards the East  OUR learned Countryman  Gregory  tells us  That the holy Men of  Jerusalem  hold a Tra∣dition generally received from their Ancients that our SAVIOUR himself was buried with his Face and Feet towards the East It is affirmed by the Geographers of the holy Land  And  Bede  says  Introeuntes ab oriente in domum illam rotundam quae in petra excisa est viderunt angelum sedentem ad meri∣dianam partem loci illius ubi positum fuerat corpus Jesu hoc enim erat in dextris quod nimirum corpus quod supinum jacens caput habebat ad occasum dexteram ne∣cesse est habere ad austrum  Bed in Dic Sanct Paschae Tom    That as the Holy Women enter'd at the Eastern Part into the RoundHouse which is hewn out in the Rock they saw the Angel sitting at the South Part of the Place where the Body of JESUS had lain that is at his Right Hand for undoubtedly his Body having its Face up∣wards and its Head to the West must have its Right Hand to the South  Cassalion  says  Adeo tenaces fuere prisci illi fideles in hoc ritu respici∣endi in orientem ut non folum ipsi viventes hoc in eo∣rum precibus exacte servarent verum etiam mortui eorum corpora supina in sepulchris facie orientem respicerent  Cass de Vet Rit Christ P    The Faithful of old were so observing of this Ceremony of looking towards the East that they not only strictly observed it in their Pray∣ers when living but even when they were dead their Bodies were placed with their Fa∣ces upwards in the Sepulchre looking towards the East  THE learned Dr  Comber  in his Discourse of the solemn Interment hath these Words upon "this Subject  We may note the Positure and Position of the Corps which among the Chri∣stians hath always been to turn the Feet to the East with the Head to the West that so they may be ready to meet the LORD whom the Ancients did believe should appear in the oriental Part of Heaven  Durand Rat Lib    Cap  Or as our ingenious Mr  Gre∣gory  believes That they might be in the Po∣sture of Prayer with their Faces to the East as soon as they were raised There are some  ancient Authors tell us That the old Inha∣bitants of  Attica  buried thus before the Days of  Solon  who as they report convinced the  Athenians  that the Island of  Salamis  did of Right belong to them by shewing them dead Bodies looking that Way and Sepulchres tur∣ned towards the East as they use to bury  Diog Laert Vit Solon  c And the Scho∣liast upon  Thucidides  says It was the Man∣ner of all the  Greeks  to bury their Dead thus Tho' a learned modern Writer supposes these Authors mistaken and cites  Plutarch  and  Elian  to prove that the  Athenians  turned their Dead towards the West However it is certain that all Nations had one certain Way of placing the Corps from which they would not vary and we Christians have so great Antiquity for our Custom that we ought not out of Singularity to alter it  NO Doubt but this learned Man had great Reason for this Conclusion as well knowing that this ancient Rite was struck at by the whole Herd of Sectaries as a silly Fancy and an idle Dream Who never would observe it  were it not that they are sometimes obliged but would with those who are not obliged act the very Reverse and bury North and South I wish there were no powerfuller Enemies to it than them now a Days but  as a Man's Ene∣mies are too often those of his own Houshold  so 'tis to be lamented that some who pretend to be of our own Church are upon all Occasions secret Advocates against this Ceremony When therefore there is such Opposition without and such Treachery within 'tis high Time to be on the Guard against our Enemies least a Cere∣mony so venerable for its Antiquity and so use∣ful in its Observation be laid aside Was it but for this one Thing that it speaks the Hope of the whole Christian Church since the ear∣liest Times of Christianity about the Resur∣rection of the same Body It is too true that there are some at this Time of the Day as well as were in the Days of the Apostle who think  it a Thing incredible that GOD should raise the Dead  some really disbelieving the Resurrection of any Body and others that of the same Body But as long as this Ceremony is in Being it will always be a ready Proof that the whole  Christian Church did not only believe the Re∣surrection of the Body but of that very Body which was laid down in the Grave For they observed it that they might be ready with their Faces to meet their SAVIOUR at his coming to Judgment which certainly implies that they believed that very Body should rise again  CHAP VI  Of the Time of Cockcrow Whether evil Spirits wander about in the Time of Night and whether they fly away at the Time of Cockcrow Reflections upon this encouraging us to have Faith and Trust in GOD  I  T is a received Tradition among the Vulgar That at the Time of Cockcrowing the Midnight Spirits forsake these lower Re∣gions and go to their proper Places They wander say they about the World from the dead Hour of Night when all Things are buried in Sleep and Darkness till the Time of Cockcrowing and then they  depart Hence it is that in CountryPlaces where the Way of Life requires more early La∣bour they always go chearfully to Work at that Time whereas if they are called abroad sooner they are apt to imagine every Thing they see or hear to be a wandring Ghost  Shakespear  hath given us an excellent Account of this vulgar Notion in his Tragedy of  Hamlet  Ber  It was about to speak when the Cock crew  Hor  And then it started like a guilty Thing  Upon a dreadful Summons I have heard  The Cock that is the Trumpet to the Day  Doth with his lofty and shrill sounding Throat  Awake the God of Day And at his Warning  Whether in Sea or Fire in Earth or Air  The extravagant and erring Spirit hyes  To its Confine and of the Truth herein  This present Object made Probation  Mar  It faded at the Crowing of the Cock  Some say that e'er against that Season comes  Wherein our Saviour's Birth is celebrated  The Bird of Dawning singeth all Night long  And then they say No Spirit doth walk abroad  The Nights are wholsome then no Planet strikes  No Fairy takes no Witch hath Power to harm  So gracious and so hallowed is that Time  NOW to shew what Truth there is in this vulgar Opinion I shall consider  First  What Truth there is in the Roaming of Spirits in the Night And  Secondly  Whether they are obli∣ged to go away at Cockcrow  I believe none who assent to the Truth of Divine Revelation deny that there are good and evil Angels attending upon Men the one to guard and protect them and the other to harm and work their Ruin that the one are  those  Heb i  ministring Spirits which are sent out to minister to the Heirs of Salvation  the other the  roaring Lion  and his Instruments  Job ii  who wander to and fro in the Earth these  Mat xii  unclean Spirits who wander through dry Places seeking Rest and finding none  NOR I believe will it be question'd that there have been Apparitions of good and evil Spirits and that many with our SAVIOUR'S Disciples have been  affrighted and cried out  not only with supposing they had seen but really with seeing a Spirit Of this the Testi∣mony  of all Ages and Scripture it self are a sufficient Demonstration  WHAT then could these have ordinarily been but the Appearances of some of those  Angels of Light  or Darkness For I am far from thinking that either the Ghosts of the Damn'd or the Happy either the Soul of a  Di∣ves  or a  Lazarus  returns here any more For as St  Athanasius  observes  Hai  n tois n  ois c Athan  Tom P  These Visions and Shades of the Saints which appear in the Tem∣ples and at the Tombs are not the Souls of the Saints themselves but the good Angels appearing in their Shapes  Not that GOD could not re∣mand the Ghost of  Samuel  and order it again to visit the Earth as he made  Moses  and  Elias  to appear at our SAVIOUR'S Transfiguration but that a Thing of this Nature was very un∣common and seldom happen'd  TAKING it therefore for granted that there have been Apparitions of Angels I believe it will also be owned that these Apparitions have frequently happen'd in the Night And truly  was there no direct Proof of this yet the No∣tion of their appearing in the Night being as it were link'd and chained to our Idea of an Ap∣parition would almost perswade us that the Night is the most proper Time for such Appea∣rances Whether it is that the Fables of Nur∣ses  Lock  Human Underst  as an ingenious Author imagines  have so associated the Idea of Spirit to the Night that the one never appears without the other  or whether there is something in the Presence of Night some Awfulness and Horrour which naturally dispose the Mind of Man to these Reflections I am indeed very inclinable to be∣lieve that these Legendary Stories of Nurses and old Women are the Occasion of much greater Fears than People without them would generally have of these Things but I cannot help thinking that the Presence of Night would naturally lead a Man to some Reflection of Spirits without any such Cause as that learned Author mentions There are some particular Times which will naturally raise some parti∣cular Thoughts Thus on a bright sunny Day  we are naturally disposed to Mirth and Gaiety when the Day overcasts or the Weather is hazy we then turn indolent and dull and sooth our selves in Melancholly if it Thunder and Lighten we think of the Day of Judg∣ment and sudden Death And thus also the Night as it inclines us to grave and serious Thoughts raises in us Horrour and Dismay and makes us afraid even when our Judgment tells us there is no Fear so it may of it self be look'd upon as a natural Cause of such Reflections  BUT however this be we must necessarily own that Spirits have frequently appeared in the Night or we must give the Lye to the Traditions of all Ages to Historians prophane and sacred and the wisest and best in the Ge∣nerations of Men  IN the Heathen World there are many In∣stances of which I shall only mention this one out of  Plutarch  In Vit Mar  Brut  Trans Duke  One Night before  Brutus  passed out of  Asia  he was very late all alone in his Tent with a dim Light burning by  him all the Rest of the Army being husht and silent and musing with himself and very thoughtful as he turn'd his Eye to the Door he saw a strange and terrible Appearance of a prodigious and frightful Body coming towards him without speaking  Brutus  boldly asked him What art thou Man or God Or upon what Business do'st thou come to us The Spi∣rit answer'd I am thy  Evil Genius  thou shalt see me at  Philippi  to which  Brutus  not at all disturbed reply'd Then I will see thee there  IN the sacred Writings we have  Job  Job  terri∣fied with Visions of the Night  when deep Sleep falleth upon Men Fear came upon him and Trembling which made all his Bones to shake then a Spirit passed by before his Face and the Hair of his Flesh stood up In the Night  Gen xxxii  Jacob  wrestled with the Angel in the Night an Angel delivered  Acts xii  Peter  out of Prison  c  BUT tho' it be true from Scripture that there have been nightly Apparitions yet these  are chiefly of good Angels whereas this Opi∣nion principally means the Appearances of evil Spirits It must be owned indeed that the Appearances of evil Spirits if litterally are yet but very seldom mention'd in the Night in Scripture but however that they wander and appear at Night is very deducible from if not litterally mentioned in it Their's  is the Land of Darkness and the Shadow of Death They are reserved under Chains of Dark∣ness to the Judgment of the great Day and we know that every one that doth Evil natu∣rally hateth the Light They therefore love Darkness rather than Light because their Deeds are Evil  The Night therefore in a more e∣special Manner seems to be their  Hour  and the  Power of Darkness  THIS was the Opinion of the  Jews  as may be learned from the Fear of the Apostles when they saw our Saviour about the fourth Watch of the Night coming to them upon the Waters  Mat xiv  They were affrighted and cryed out supposing  they had seen a Spirit  Doctor  Whitby  upon this Place says  That the  Jews  had then an Opinion of hurtful Spirits walking in the Night is evident from the seventy who ren∣der'd  from the Pestilence walking in Dark∣ness  Apo pragmatos diaporeuomenou en skotei  From  the Fear of the Devils that walk in the Night  AND that this was also the Opinion of the ancient Christians is evident not only from their dividing the Night into four Watches the Evening Midnight Cockcrowing and the Morning which were the Military Divisions of the Night and which  Si quidem in Nocte Stationes Vigiliae Militares in quatuor partes divisae ternis horarum spatiis secernun∣tur  Isidore  Lib de Eccle Offici Cap  they observed to guard their Souls from the silent Incursions of evil Spirits as the others did those of the Enemy but also from their many Relations of such Ap∣pearances  Cassian  in giving an Account of the Watching of the Ancient Monks and their be∣ing assaulted with Midnight Spirits tells us That at the Beginning of the Monkish Life  Tanta nam{que} erat eorum feritas ut vix pauci Tolerare habitationem solitudinis possentIta eorum atrocitas grassabatur frequentes ac visibiles sentiebantur aggressus ut non auderent omnes pariter noctibus obdormi∣re sed vicissim aliis degustantibus somnum alii vigilias cele∣brantes Psalmis Orationibus seu Lectionibus in haere∣bant  Cassian  Coll Cap  the Rage of the Midnight Spirits was so great that but few and these too Men of Age and unshaken Resolution were able to endure the Life in the Desart For such was their Fierceness that where Eight or Ten had been together in a Monastery they would have made frequent and visible Incursions Insomuch that they never all slept at the same Time but took it by turns some watching the Rest and ex∣ercising themselves in singing Psalms in Pray∣ing and Reading And St  Athanasius  in his Life of  Anthony  the Hermit tells Of many Conflicts that good Man had in the Night with the Powers of Darkness whilst they endeavour∣ed to batter him  from the strong Holds  of his Faith And what can our Church chiefly mean in  the Collect for Aid against Perils  but that GOD would send us Protection from all the Spirits of Darkness these Midnight Wanderers  of the World And for this Reason every good Man when he lies down to sleep at Night desires the great  Keeper of  Israel  who never slumbereth nor sleepeth to send his Holy Angels to pitch their Tents round about him  and banish from him the Spirits of the Night  SO far then this Tradition is just and good that there are Midnight Spirits who wander a∣bout the World going  too and fro in the Earth seeking whom they may devour  Let us now in the next Place enquire what Truth there is in the other Part of it namely That they always fly away at Cockcrow  THIS Opinion whatever Truth there may be in it is certainly very Ancient We have it mentioned by the Christian Poet  Prudentius  who flourished in the Beginning of the fourth Century as a Tradition of Common Belief His Words are these  Ferunt Vagantes Daemones  Laetos Tenebris Noctium  Gallo canente exterritos  Sparsim timere cedere  Invisa nam Vicinitas  Lucis salutis numinis  Rupto Tenebrarum situ  Noctis Fugat satellites  Hoc esse signum praescii  Norunt repromissae spei  Qua Nos soporis Liberi  Speramus adventum Dei  They say the wandering Powers that Love  The silent Darkness of the Night  At Cockcrowing give o'er to rove  And all in Fear do take their Flight  The approaching salutary Morn  The approach Divine of hated Day  Makes Darkness to its Place return  And drives the Midnight Ghosts away  They know that this an Emblem is  Of what preceeds our lasting Bliss  That Morn when Graves give up their Dead  In certain hope to meet their GOD  CASSIAN  also who lived in the same Cen∣tury giving an Account of a Multitude of De∣vils  who had been Abroad in the Night says  Aurora itaque superveniente cum omnis haec ab ocu∣lis evanisset Daemonum multitudo  Cass  Coll C  That as soon as the Morn approached they all vanished and fled away By this we see that this was a current Opinion at this Time of Day but what Reason they had for it except some Relations of the disappearing of Evil Spirits at that Hour I never yet have met with But there have been produc'd at that Time of Night Things of very memora∣ble Worth which might perhaps raise the pious Credulity of some Men to imagine that there was something more in it than in other Times It was about the Time of Cockcrow∣ing when our Saviour was born and the An∣gels sung the first ChristmasCarol to the poor Shepherds in the Fields of  Bethlehem  Now it may be presum'd that as the Saviour of the World was then born and the  Heavenly Host  had then descended to proclaim▪ the News that the Angels of Darkness would be terrified and confounded and immediately fly away And perhaps this Consideration has partly been the Foundation of this Opinion for as this  may easily be supposed so perhaps it has been imagin'd that the Spirits of Darkness having always in Memory that fatal Hour are start∣led and frighted away as the Cock proclaims it  IT was also about this Time when he rose from the Dead And when the great  Sun of Righ∣teousness  was risen upon the World no wonder that all the Clouds of Darkness and Wickedness were dispell'd no wonder that the conquer'd Powers of Hell were not able to shew their Heads And this perhaps hath been another Reason of their imagining that Spirits go away at that time  A third Reason is that Passage in the Book of  Genesis  where Jacob  wrestled with the Angel for a Blessing  where the Angel says unto him  Gen xxxii  Let me go for the Day breaketh  BUT indeed this Tradition seems more e∣specially to have risen from some particular Circumstances attending the Time of Cockcrowing and which as  Prudentius  seems to say above are an Emblem of the Approach of  the Day of the Resurrection For when we leave the World we lie down in our Graves and  Rest from our Labours  Sleep and Dark∣ness lay hold upon us and there we abide till the last Day appear when the Voice of the ArchAngel shall awake us that we may meet the LORD of Light and Day And when we leave the common Business and Care of Life we lie down in our Beds as in a Grave buried as it were in Sleep and Darkness till the Cock crow the welcome Messenger of the News of Day  THE Circumstances therefore of the Time of Cockcrowing being so natural a Figure and Representation of the Morning of the Resurre∣ction the Night so shadowing out the Night of the Grave the third Watch being as some suppose the Time our Saviour will come to Judgment at the Noise of the  Cock  awaken∣ing sleepy Man and telling him as it were  the Night is far spent the Day is at Hand  re∣presenting so naturally the Voice of the ArchAngel awakening the Dead and calling up the Righteous to everlasting Day so natural∣ly does the Time of Cockcrowing shadow out  these Things that probably some good wellmeaning Men have been brought to believe that the very Devils themselves when the Cock Crew and reminded them of them did fear and tremble and shun the Light  NOW in Answer to the first of these Con∣jectures 'Tis very likely the Evil Spirits did fly away in the Morning of the Nativity and because of our Saviour's Birth and that  Com∣pany of the Heavenly Host  might be afraid and retire into thick Darkness yet it will not hence follow that it always happens so at the Time of Cockcrowing For if they did fly away that Morning the Circumstances of our Saviour's Birth the heavenly Glory of the Angelick Quire their Musick and their Presence were the Occasion of it And why only the bare Remembrance of what happened at that Time should always at the Time of Cockcrowing drive them away rather than when they remem∣ber it at another no Reason seems to be given  AS to the second Conjecture namely That it was the Time of our Saviour's Rising from  the Dead I answer in the same Manner That tho' it be allowed that the Evil Spirits might have returned to the Land of Darkness upon our Saviour's Rising from the Dead yet why it should Occasion them always to do so at that Time no Reason can be given  AS to the third Conjecture it is easy to observe That this was a good Angel where∣as they that shun the Light are bad ones This was the Angel of the Covenant the Cre∣ator of Light and the Lord of the Day We may therefore as well imagine that it was not in his Power to get out of the Arms of  Jacob  without saying  Let me go  as to suppose he was obliged to go because he said  the Day breaketh  The meaning of which Words  According to  Willet  is not that the Angel was gone to the blessed Company of the Angels to sing their Morning Hymn to GOD as the  Hebrews  imagine For the Angels not only in the Morning but at other Times are exercised in praising GOD But the Angel thus speaketh according to the Custom of Men having now taken the  Form and Shape of a Man as tho' he had hast to other Business and leaving  Jacob  al∣so to his Affairs  THE last Conjecture of the Rise of this Tra∣dition seems to carry greater probability than the Others For as these Things are a Repre∣sentation of the Circumstances of the Morning of the Resurrection so they must sure enough bring that last Day into Remembrance and they never can do so but as surely they must create Terrour and Confusion in all the Devils and Ghosts of the Night Whilst they assure them they shall never any more enjoy the Realms of Bliss but be hurried into that  Matth xxv  e∣verlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels  But that these Things are the Occa∣sion of their Flying away at the Approach of Day is not to be supposed On the contrary the Devil and his Angels ramble o'er the World in Daylight and are midday Devils as well as midnight ones For the Devil is incessant in his Temptations and therefore he is abroad in the Day as well as the Night tho'  perhaps has seldom appear'd but in Darkness Thus St  Austin  in one of his Meditations  Et ideo Deus meus ad te clamamus libera nos ab ad∣versario nostro quotidiano qui sive dormiamus sive vigi∣lemusdie ac nocte fraudibus artibus nunc palam nunc occulte sagittas venenatas contra nos dirigens ut in∣terficiat animas nostras  Aug Sol Cap    We implore thee O GOD that thou woul∣dest deliver us from our daily Enemy who by his Wiles and Cunning is always watching us Day and Night Sleeping and Waking and both openly and in secret shooting at us his poisoned Arrows that he may destroy our Souls  AND now what tho' this be true as it most certainly seems to be so that at the chearful Hour of Cockcrowing the wander∣ing Ghosts are not driven away but still continue going too and fro What tho' then their Power be still the same and their In∣tentions as fully bent to do Evil Consider but that GOD'S Care and Providence govern the World and there will be found as much Safety for us in the midst of Evil Spirits as if they absented at that Time The Al∣mighty Power of GOD is the same then as  at other Times nothing but that preserved us continually and that will always be able to preserve us However great may be the Malice of Devils however desirous of work∣ing our Ruin tho' they watch all Opportu∣nities and are unwearied in tempting us  yet the loving Kindness of the LORD endureth for Ever and his Mercy is over all his Works He will not suffer our Foot to be moved he that keepeth us will not sleep We shall not be afraid of the Sun by Day nor the Moon by Night For the Pestilence that walketh in Darkness nor for the Sickness that destroyeth in the Noonday  ARE we then afraid of Darkness and the presence of Night Let us remember the Cre∣ator of them and have but Faith in him and we shall find  our Night turned into Day In his Light shall we see Light  We shall be as secure as if there was no Darkness about us as well knowing that that GOD which pro∣tects us sees through the thickest  Mediums  and the darkest Night  For with him the Dark∣ness is no Darkness but the Night is as clear as the Day the Darkness and Light to him are  both alike  Or are we afraid of that old Ser∣pent the Devil that nightly Rambler of the World who is a Lover of Night and Dark∣ness Let us trust in GOD and no harm shall happen to us If we will but  fear no Evil his Rod and his Staff shall Comfort us tho' we walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death For GOD hath reserved the Devil and his Angels in everlasting Chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great Day  Tho' therefore he is permitted to wan∣der the World yet he is so chain'd up that without GOD'S particular Order or Permis∣sion he is not allowed to touch the Sons of Men and he is so reserved and kept in Dark∣ness that it is not in his Power even barely to appear and be visible to them without the Permission of GOD So little Reason hath e∣very good Man to fear the Spight and Malice of all the Devils in Hell  WHEN then the Night pours out her Ter∣rours covers all Things with Darkness and strikes thee with Horrour  Lift but up thy Eyes to the Hills from whence cometh thy Help  and thou shalt clearly see that our  Lord GOD is a Light and Defence to thee  Quia filiis lucis in noctibus dies est Quando enim sine lumine est cui lumen in corde est Aut quan∣do sol ei dies non est cui sol dies Christus est  Cy∣prian de Orat Dom  For to those who are the  Children of the Light  the Day shineth in the Night They are never without Light whose Hearts are illuminated never without Sunshine whose Sun is CHRIST In short then if thou fear Darkness look up to CHRIST and thou hast eternal Day if the Angels of Darkness look but up with the Eye of Faith and thou shalt  see the Moun∣tains full of Chariots and Horses of Fire  Thou shalt see as did the Servant of the Prophet  Elisha That they who be with us are more than they who are against us  No Matter then whe∣ther the Spirits of the Night go away or only tremble at the Time of Cockcrowing For sure we are  that the Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivereth them  nay  That GOD himself will arise and scatter his Enemies and make them that hate him to flie before him  And if GOD  be for us who can be against us  CHAP VII  Of ChurchYards why the Vulgar are generally afraid of passing through them at Night The Original of this Fear That there is nothing in them now more than in other Places to be afraid of  T  HE most of ignorant People are afraid of going through a  ChurchYard  at Nighttime If they are obliged upon some hasty and urgent Affair they fear and tremble till they are beyond its Bounds but they generally avoid it and go further about It would no Question be better if there were fewer  Pathways  through ChurchYards than there are both as it would prevent several  Abuses  committed in them and also cause the Ashes of the Dead to be in  greater quiet and more undisturbed Peace We should not then see ChurchYards changed into common Dunghils nor should we tread so frequently upon the Bones of our Friends But when for the Conveniency of Neighbour∣hood or other Reasons there are allowed pub∣lick Ways it is a very great Weakness to be afraid of passing through them  THE Reason of this Fear is a Notion they have imbib'd that in  ChurchYards  there is a frequent walking of Spirits at the  Deadtime  of Night Indeed there is at that Time some∣thing awful and horrible every where and it must be confess'd something more solemn in a  ChurchYard  than in the Generality of other Places but that it is then more frequented with  Apparitions and Ghosts  than other Places are is at this Time of Day intirely ground∣less and without any Reason  THE Original of this Timorousness may be deduc'd from the Heathens For they believ∣ed that the  departed Ghosts  came out of their  Tombs  and  Sepulchres  and wander'd about the  Place where the Body lay buried Thus  Maerin saepe animas imis excite sepulchris  VidiBucol    Virg  Virgil  tells us That  Maeris  could call the Ghosts out of their Sepulchres And  Nunc animae tennesSepulchrisErrant  Ovid Fast  Ovid  that Ghosts came out of the Sepulchres and wandered about And  Clemens Alexandrinus  in his  Admonitions to the Gentiles  upbraids them with the Gods they worshipped which  Poos oun  c Admonit ad Gent P    says he are wont to appear at Tombs and Sepulchres and which are nothing but fa∣ding Spectres and airy Forms And the learn∣ed Mr  Mede  observes from a Passage of this same ancient Father  Mede Lib    P    de Cultu Daemon  That the Heathens supposed the Presence and Power of  Daemons  for so the  Greeks  called the Souls of Men departed at their Coffins and Sepulchres as tho' there always remain'd some natural Tye between the Deceased and their Relicts  Agreeable to this Dr  Scot  Scot Christ Life P    Part    in his Discourse of the Christian Life speaks of  gross  and  sensual  Souls who appeared often after  their Separation in  ChurchYards  or  Char∣nelHouses  where their Bodies were laid  The  Plat Phaed P      Soul that is infected with a great Lust to the Body continues so for a great while after Death and suffering many Reluctances ho∣vers about this visible Place and is hardly drawn from thence by Force by the  Daemon  that hath the Guard and Care of it  By the  visible Place  he means  P    ibid  their  Monuments and Sepulchres where the shadowy Fantasms  of such Souls  have sometimes appeared  IT having therefore been a current Opinion of the Heathens that  Places of Burial and ChurchYards  were frequently haunted with  Spectres  and  Apparitions  it is easy to imagine that the Opinion has been handed from them among the ignorant and unlearned through∣out all the Ages of Christianity to the present Day And indeed tho' now there may be no such Things yet that there have been need not be disputed not that they were the real Souls of Men departed For I cannot see for  what Reason it should be supposed    Scot Christ ibid  how∣ever unacquainted such Souls might be with the Pleasures of Spirits that they are per∣mitted to wander to hover about and linger after their Bodies  It seems rather to be true what is mentioned of such Apparitions in St  Athanasius  's Questions to  Antiochius  that  Athan Tom    P    these Apparitions of the Saints which ap∣pear at Tombs and Temples are not the Souls of the Saints themselves but the good Angels appearing in their Likeness And I imagine it must be so too with the Souls of bad Men they appear not themselves but they are re∣presented by the Evil Angels For the Soul upon the Departure  returns to GOD that gave it  who alots it its Station in the World of Spirits where it is kept till the Day of Judg∣ment in Happiness or Misery when it shall receive its Compleation of the one or the other However whatever these Apparitions were they are a certain Proof that such Appearan∣ces have been in such Places and indeed to add no more it is the whole Voice of Antiquity  BUT now with us GOD be thanked the Scene is changed we live not in the Darkness of Errour but in the Light of Truth we worship not  Daemons  but the GOD of the whole Earth and our Temples are not the Temples of Idols but the Temples of the Ho∣ly GOD If among the Heathens such Delu∣sions were permitted it was because  GOD had forsaken them  But when he vouchsafes to have his Residence in his Holy Temple we are the further from Harm the nearer we ap∣proach it  Psal lxxxiv  There the Sparrow hath found her an House and the Swallow a Nest where she may lay her Young  and there shall no Harm happen to good Men but they shall be rather protected because they are so near their  Fa∣ther's House  the House of Prayer  CHAP VIII  Of visiting Wells and Fountains The Original of this Custom The naming of them of great Antiquity The Wor∣ship paid them by the Papists was gross Idolatry  I  N the dark Ages of  Popery  it was a Custom if any  Well  had an awful Situation and was seated in some lonely melan∣cholly Vale if its Water was clear and limpid and beautifully  Viridi si margine clauderet undas Herba  Juven Sat    margin'd with the tender Grass or if it was look'd upon as having a Medicinal Quality to gift it to some  Saint  and honour it with his Name Hence it is that we have at  this Day Wells and Fountains called some St  John  's St  Mary Magdalen  's St  Mary  's  Well  c  TO these kind of Wells the common People are accustomed to go on a Summer's Evening to refresh themselves with a  Walk  after the Toil of the Day to drink the Water of the Fountain and enjoy the pleasing Prospect of Shade and Stream  NOW this Custom tho' at this Time of Day very commendable and harmless and innocent seems to be the Remains of that superstitious Practice of the Papists of paying Adoration to Wells and Fountains For they imagin'd there was some Holiness and Sancti∣ty in them and so worshipped them In the  Canons  of St  Anselm  made in the Year we find this Superstitious Practice in some Measure forbid  Johnson  Consti St  Anselm  Can  Let no one attribute Reverence or Sanctity to a dead Body or a Fountain or other Things as sometimes  is to our Knowledge without the Bishop's Authority  And in the th of the  Canons  made in the Reign of King  Edgar  in the Year it is order'd  Johnson  Consti  That every Priest in∣dustriously advance Christianity and ex∣tinguish Heathenism and forbid the Wor∣shipping of Fountains c Mr  Johnson  says upon this  Canon  that the Worshipping of Wells and Fountains was a Superstiti∣on which prevailed in this Nation till the Age before the Reformation Nay I cannot say it is extinguish'd yet among the Papists In the Ages of dark Popery it was thought sufficient to forbid the Honouring of Wells and Fountains without the Bishop's Appro∣bation  THE giving of Names to Wells is of great Antiquity We find it a Custom in the Days of the old Patriarchs  Abraham  observed this Custom and therefore the Well which he recover'd from the Servants of  Abimeleck  He  Gen xxi  called  Beersheba  or the Well of the Oath  because there they sware both of them  Thus also  Isaac  when his Herdsmen had found a Well and the Herdsmen of  Gerar  had a Con∣test with them about the Right of it  Gen  called the Name of the Well  Eseck that is  Strife because they strove with him And he digged another Well and strove for that also and he called the Name of it  Sitnah that is  Hatred And he removed from thence and digged ano∣ther Well and for that they strove not and he called the Name of it  Rehoboth that is  Room And he said for now the LORD hath made Room for us and we shall be fruitful in the Land  And we read it was at  Jacob  's  Well  where JESUS talked with the Woman of  Sa∣maria  To give Names therefore to Wells is of an ancient Standing but to pay Homage and Worship to them was never heard of a∣mong the People of GOD till they sunk in∣to gross Idolatry and became Worshippers of Stocks and Stones  When the Creature became worshipped instead of the Creator  then was this Custom first introduced in the Ages of Popish Ignorance and Idolatry  THERE need be no Question but as this Custom is practically Heathenish so it is also originally For the Heathens were wont to worship Streams and Fountains and to sup∣pose that the Nymphs whom they imagin'd the Goddesses of the Waters presided over them As the Papists have borrowed many of their silly and superstitious Ceremonies from the Religion of the Heathens so this in par∣ticular a sottish stupid and abominable Cu∣stom they could borrow no where else  For we had no such Custom  neither at any Time  the Churches of GOD  CHAP IX  Of Omens Their Original The Obser∣vation of them sinfull  O  MENS and Prognostications of Things are still in the Mouths of all tho' only observed by the Vulgar In Country Pla∣ces especially they are in great Repute and are the Directors of several Acti∣ons of Life being looked on by them as Presages of Things future or the Determi∣ners of present Good or Evil If  Lepus quoque occurrens in via infortunatum iter prae∣sagit ominosum  Alex ab Alex Lib    C    P    a Hare cross their Way it is an Omen of ill Luck If  Saepe sinistra cava praedixit ab ilice cornix  Virg Bucol    a Crow cry it portends something Evil  If  Maxime vero abominatus est bubo tristis dira avis voce funesta gemitu qui formidolosa dirasque necessi∣tates magnas moles instar  portendit  Alex ab Alex Lib    C    P    an Owl which they reckon a most abo∣minable and unlucky Bird sends forth its hoarse and dismal Voice it is an Omen of the Approach of some terrible Thing that some dire Calamity and some great Misfor∣tune is near at Hand If Salt fall towards them to be sure something has happened to one in the Family or is shortly to happen to themselves Such also is the Chattering of a Magpye the Cry of Ravens the Deadwatch Crickets  c  THIS is a Copy of the Omens of the Hea∣thens  Deinde anguribus reliqui reges usi Et exactis regi∣bus nihil publice fine auspiciis nec domi nec militiae gera∣batur  Cic de Divin Lib    who never went upon any Enter∣prize nor undertook any Business of Moment without consulting the Augurs and WiseMen and being guided by Omens and Presages of Things Hence it was that they consulted the Intrails of Beasts the Flights of Birds and several other Things And that the very  Things abovementioned as the Authori∣ties there declare have been observed by them yea they have observ'd them even in the remotest Ages beyond the Days of the oldest Records The Heathen World there∣fore was full of them and without all doubt they have been handed down to us from these Times  AND as it is not to be question'd but we had them from the Heathens so in all proba∣bility the Heathens have taken them from the People of GOD and built many of their Folies and ominous Superstitions on a Custom which they alone were indulged in For in the ear∣liest Ages of the World when a Matter of a∣ny great Consequence was depending and the Servants of GOD would know what the E∣vent would be they asked a  Sign  of GOD by desiring that such a Thing might happen if they were to succeed and GOD was some∣times so condescending as to grant them their desire Thus we read That  Sam i iii  Jonathan  ac∣company'd only by his ArmourBearer not fear∣ing  the Steepness of the Rocks nor Multi∣tudes of Enemies attempted the Garrison of the  Philistines  and conquered through a To∣ken of this Nature  If they say  says he to his ArmourBearer  Tarry untill we come up then we will stand still in our Place and will not go up unto them but if they say come up unto us then we will go up for the LORD hath delivered them into our Hands and this shall be a Sign unto us  And so indeed it came to pass GOD who had inspired  Jonathan  with this Thought directing the Tongues of the others according to his Wishes In like Manner when the good old Servant of  Abraham  had arrived at the City of  Nahor  to find a Wife for his Master's Son we have him desiring of GOD that the Sign of the Woman he should pitch upon might be her saying  Drink and I will give thy Camels drink also  Gen xxiv  And he said O Lord GOD of my Master  Abraham  I pray thee send me good speed this Day and shew Kindness unto my Master  Abraham  Behold I stand here by the Well of Water and the Daughters of the Men of the City come out to draw Water And  let it come to pass that the Damsel to whom I shall say let down thy Pitcher I pray thee that I may Drink And she shall say Drink and I will give thy Camels drink also Let the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy Servant  Isaac  and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed Kindness unto my Master  This happened ac∣cording to his Prayer by which he knew that the LORD had prospered his Journey Now this Custom we know the  Philistines  imitated when they would know whether they had been afflicted by the GOD of  Israel  for keep∣ing the Ark  Sam i  They took the Ark of the LORD and laid it on a Cart and sent it away And they said If it goeth by the Way of his own Coast to  Bethshemoth  then he hath done us this great Evil  IN these early Ages of the World GOD permitted such Things upon extraordinary Oc∣casions to be asked by his own People But they were only peculiar to those Times We have no Warrant for doing the like It be∣comes not us to prescribe Means to GOD by  which we may judge of our future Success but to depend on his Power and Wisdom his Care and Providence The Observation of Omens such as the falling of Salt a Hare crossing the Way of the DeadWatch of Cric∣kets  c  are sinful and diabolical They are the Inventions of the Devil to draw Men from a due Trust in GOD and make them his own Vassals For by such Observations as these they are the Slaves of Superstition and Sin and have all the While no true Dependance upon GOD no Trust in his Providence  CHAP X  Of the Country Conversation in a Winter's Evening Their Opinions of Spirits and Apparitions of the Devil's ap∣pearing with a cloven Foot of Fai∣ries and Hobgoblins of the walk∣ing Places of Spirits and of haun∣ted Houses  N  OTHING is commoner in  County Places  than for a whole Family in a  Winter's Evening  to sit round the Fire and tell Stories of Appariti∣ons and Ghosts And no Question of it but this adds to the natural Fearfulness of Men and makes them many Times imagine they see Things which really are nothing but their  own Fancy From this and seldom any o∣ther Cause it is that  Herds  and  Shepherds  have all of them seen  frequent Apparitions  and are generally so well stock'd with Stories of their own Knowledge Some of them have seen  Fairies  some  Spirits  in the Shapes of  Cows  and  Dogs  and  Horses  and some have seen even the  Devil  himself with a  cloven Foot  All which is either  Hearsay  or a  strong Imagina∣tion  Not that there have not been or may not be Apparitions we know that there have undoubtedly been such Things and that there still are upon particular Occasions but that almost all the Stories of Ghosts and Spirits are grounded on no other Bottom than the Fears and Fancies and weak Brains of Men  IN their Account of the Apparition of the Devil they always describe him with a  cloven Foot  That is always his distinguishing Badge whatever Shape he appears in whether it be in Beauty or Deformity he never appears with∣out it Such is the old Tradition they have received of his appearing and such is their Belief of it  INDEED it must be confess'd that this is not so improbable and ridiculous as many Things they hold For tho' perhaps few of them have ought else for this Opinion but  old Wives Fables  or the Picture of the Devil which they have always observed drawn with a cloven Foot yet there seems to be some Truth in it For in the Times of frequent Apparitions the Devil was wont to appear so if we may believe Antiquity and there is also some Reason for it considering the Cir∣cumstances of the fallen Angels  THE  Brown  's  Vulg Err  Author of the  Vulgar Errors  upon this same Subject hath these Words  The Ground of this Opinion at first might be his frequent appearing in the Shape of a Goat which answers this Description This was the Opinion of the ancient Christians concerning the Apparitions of  Panites Fauns  and  Satyrs  and of this Form we read of one that appeared to  Anthony  in the Wil∣derness The same is also confirmed from Expositions of Holy Scripture For where∣as  it is said  Thou shalt not offer unto Devils  The original Word is  Seghnirim  that is  rough and hairy Goats  because in that Shape the Devil most often appeared as is expoun∣ded by the  Rabbins  as  Tremellius  hath also explain'd and as the Word  Ascimah  the God of  Emath  is by some conceived He observes also That the  Goat  was the Em∣blem of the  Sin Offering  and is the Emblem of sinful Men at the Day of Judgment  AND of this Opinion was also the learned Mr  Mede Dis    Mede  He says  That when Spirits converse with Men it is under some visible Shape and that there is a Law given them that that Shape they assum'd should be of something which more or less resembled their Condition For as in Nature we see every Thing hath a several and suitable  Phy∣siognomy  or  Figure  as a Badge of their in∣ward Nature whereby it is known as by a Habit of Distinction so it seems to be in the Shapes and Apparitions of Spirits And as in a well governed CommonWealth eve∣ry  Sort and Condition is known by a diffe∣ring Habit agreeable to his Quality so it seems it should be in GOD'S great CommonWealth concerning the Shapes which Spi∣rits take upon them And he that gave the Law that a Man should not wear the Ha∣bit of a Woman nor a Woman the Habit of a Man because that as he had made them diverse so would he have them so known by their Habits so it seems he will not suf∣fer a good and a bad Spirit a noble and ig∣noble one to appear unto Man after the same Fashion  NOW from this it will follow that good Angels can take upon them no other Shape but the Shape of Man because their glori∣ous Excellency is resembled only in the most excellent of all visible Creatures The Shape of an inferior Creature would be un∣suitable no other Shape becoming those who are called  the Sons of GOD  but his only who  was created after GOD's own Image  And yet not his neither as he now is but according as he was before his Fall  in his glorious Beauty of his Integrity Age and Deformity are the Fruits of Sin and the Angel in the Gospel appears like a young Man  His  Matth xxviii  Countenance like Lightning and his Raiment white as Snow  as it were resem∣bling the Beauty of glorified Bodies in Im∣mutability Sublimity and Purity  HENCE also it follows on the contrary that the Devil could not appear in humane Shape whilst Man was in his Integrity be∣cause he was a Spirit fallen from his first glorious Perfection and therefore must ap∣pear in such Shape which might argue his Imperfection and Abasement which was the Shape of a Beast Otherwise no Reason can be given why he should not rather have appeared to  Eve  in the Shape of a Woman than of a Serpent for so he might have gain'd an Opinion with her both of more Excellency and Knowledge But since the Fall of Man the Case is alter'd now we know he can take upon him the Shape of Man and no Wonder since one falling Star  may resemble another And therefore he appears it seems in the Shape of Man's Im∣perfection either for Age or Deformity as like an old Man for so the Witches say And perhaps it is not altogether false which is vulgarly affirmed that the Devil appear∣ing in humane Shape hath always a Defor∣mity of some uncouth Member or other as tho' he could not yet take upon him hu∣mane Shape intirely for that Man himself is not intirely and utterly fallen as he is  THUS far hath this great and learned Man given his Opinion of this Matter and that with such Strength of Reason and Argument as leaves at least a Probability behind it of the Truth of this Opinion  ANOTHER Part of this Conversation gene∣rally turns upon  Fairies  These they tell you have frequently been heard and seen nay that there are some still living who were stollen away by them and confined seven Years According to the Description they give of them who pretend to have seen them they  are in the Shape of Men exceeding little They are always clad in Green and frequent the Woods and Fields when they make Cakes which is a Work they have been often heard at they are very noisy and when they have done they are full of Mirth and Pastime But generally they dance in  MoonLight  when Mortals are asleep and not capable of seeing them as may be observed on the following Morn their dancing Places being very distin∣guishable For as they dance Hand in Hand and so make a  Circle  in their Dance so next Day there will be seen  Rings  and  Circles  on the Grass  NOW in all this there is really nothing but an old fabulous Story which has been handed down even to our Days from the Times of  Heathenism  of a certain Sort of Beings called  Lamiae  which were esteem'd so mis∣chievous and cruel as to take away young Children and slay them These together with the  Fauns  the  Gods of the Woods  seem to have form'd the Notion of Fairies  THIS Opinion in the benighted Ages of Popery when  Hobgoblins  and  Sprights  were in every  City  and  Town  and  Village  by every  Wa∣ter  and in every  Wood  was very common But when that Cloud was dispell'd and the Day sprung up those Spirits which wander'd in the Night of Ignorance and Error did real∣ly vanish at the Dawn of Truth and the Light of Knowledge  ANOTHER Tradition they hold and which is often talk'd of is that there are particular Places alotted to Spirits to walk in Thence it was that formerly such frequent Reports were abroad of this and that particular Place being haunted by a Spirit and that the com∣mon People say now and then such a Place is dangerous to be pass'd through at Night be∣cause a Spirit walks there Nay they'll fur∣ther tell you that some Spirits have lamented the Hardness of their Condition in being obli∣ged to walk in cold and uncomfortable Places and have therefore desir'd the Person who was so hardy as to speak to them to gift them with a warmer Walk by some well grown  Hedge  or in some  shady Vale  where they might be shelter'd from the Rain and Wind  THE Stories that Apparitions have been seen oftner than once in the same Place have no Doubt been the Rise and Spring of the wal∣king Places of Spirits but why they are said sometimes to cry out for Places that are more comfortable is not so certainly known It is however highly probable that when the Ig∣norance and Superstition of the  Romish  Church had filled the World with  Apparitions  and  Ghosts  that this also was invented among them For they seem to have the most  Right  to an In∣vention of this Nature whose Brains were so fruitful of Folly as to invent that  Fuller  's Ch Hist Cen  Dunstan  took the Devil by the Nose with a Pair of hot  Tongs  till he roar'd again For if the De∣vil may be burnt he may also be starv'd if he took such Pains to get his Nose out of the  Pincers  without Doubt in a frosty Night he would wish to be as warm as possible He that believes the one must necessarily believe the other And therefore it very near amounts  to a Demonstration who were the Authors of this Opinion  viz  The  Monks  We are sure they invented the one and need little que∣stion but they invented the other  THERE is a Story in the Book of  Tobit  which they may believe that will of the  evil Spirits  flying into the utmost Parts of  Egypt  Tob vi  For as  Tobias  went in unto his Wife he re∣membred the Words of  Raphael  and took the Ashes of the Perfumes and put the Heart and Liver of the Fish thereupon and made a Smoke therewith The which Smell when the evil Spirit had smelled he fled into the utmost Parts of  Egypt  and the Angel bound him  Now from this it is evident that the Spirit was o∣bliged to forsake his good old Quarters and warm Lodgings for inhospitable Desarts and open Air And from this perhaps some of those  doting Monks  have persuaded themselves into a Belief of these Things  WHEN it is proved to us that this Book of  Tobit  is the Word of GOD we may enter∣tain  more Veneration for this Vulgar Opini∣on but till then we must be iudulg'd in wondering how a Spirit that is an  immateri∣al Substance  can be affected with our Heat or Cold or any Power or Quality of  material Beings  THE last Topick of this Conversation I shall take Notice of shall be the Tales of  haunted  Houses And indeed it is not to be wonder'd at that this is never omitted For formerly almost every Place had a House of this Kind If a House was seated on some melancholly Place or built in some old Romantick Man∣ner or if any particular Accident had hap∣pen'd in it such as Murder sudden Death or the like to be sure that House had a Mark set on it and was afterwards esteemed the Habita∣tion of a Ghost In talking upon this Point they generally show the Occasion of the House's being  haunted  the merry Pranks of the Spi∣rit and how it was laid Stories of this Kind are infinite and there are few  Villages  which have not either had such an House in it or near it  AND indeed there are Men of good Learn∣ing and Knowledge who are as far as others from Superstition who are inclinable to be∣lieve that such Things have been upon par∣ticular Emergencies tho' among the Stories that are told they believe not one in a thou∣sand They know that Spirits have frequent∣ly appeared to Men out of Houses and they can see no Reason why they may not have ap∣peared in them They know nothing in an House more than in another Place to prevent an Apparition but an equal Help to its Visi∣bility The Air which a Ghost is supposed to be wrapped in when it becomes visible to Men is there to be found and they know of nothing else that may be an Argument against it An Author of good Credit tells us  Cum  Romae  aegra valetudine oppressus forem jace∣remque in lectulo speciem mulieris eleganti forma mihi plane vigilanti observatam fuisse quam cum inspicerem diu cogitabundus cCum meos sensus vigere fi∣guram illam nusquam a me dilabi c  Alex ab Alex Lib    C    That when he was at  Rome  he was taken with Ill∣ness and obliged to keep his Bed As he lay in this Condition he observed as he was once  awake a  Woman  of a very beautiful Person coming towards him Upon this he was silent for some Time and very thoughtful weigh∣ing all the while with himself whether it was not rather a  deceptio visus  than a real Being But when he perceived his Senses sound and intire and that the Object still continued he asked What she was In Answer to which she repeated the very Words he had spoke to her in a sneering and disdainful Manner After she had taken a good View of him she departed  THE Commentator upon this Place says  Sed haec semper mera somnia esse putavi  ibid  He looks upon this Story and the rest which are mention'd along with it to be nothing but Dreams and Fancies And for ought that I know to the contrary they may be so but however it must be confess'd this Story in particular is well attested being told by the Man himself who was a great and a learned Man and who if we may believe himself seems to be as sure that he had his Eyes open as the Commentator can be of the contrary  BUT whatever Truth there may be in it it is certain that in the Church of  Rome  they are perswaded of the Truth of it to a Fault For they are so sure of it that they have par∣ticular Forms of  exorcising  such Houses which because they have often been heard of but seldom seen and are those very Things which raised in the Vulgar formerly such an Opinion of their ignorant Priests as to make them be esteemed Men of the greatest Faith and Learning and because also the Opinion has reached even our Days and 'tis common for the present Vulgar to say none can lay a Spirit but a  Popish Priest  it shall be the Busi∣ness of the next Chapter to give one of those Forms of  exorcising  an House not that they are envied for their Art of  conjuring  but that it may be seen how well they deserve the Character they go under  CHAP XI  POSTEXER CITATIO SEPTIMA  F

seal it with thine own Sig∣net And to Morrow when thou comest in if thou findest not that  Bel  hath eaten up all we will suffer Death or else  Daniel  that spea∣keth against us And they little regarded it For under the Table they had made a privy Entrance whereby they entred in continual∣ly  and consumed those Things So when they were gone forth the King set Meats be∣fore  Bel  Now  Daniel  had commanded his Servants to bring Ashes and those they strew∣ed throughout all the Temple in the Pre∣sence of the King alone Then went they out and shut the Door and sealed it with the King's Signet and so departed Now in the Night came the Priests with their Wives and Children as they were wont to do and did eat and drink up all In the Morning betime the King arose and  Daniel  with him And the King said  Daniel  are the Seals whole And  Daniel  said Yea O King they be whole And assoon as he had open'd the Door the King looked upon the Table and cried with a loud Voice Great art thou O  Bel  and with thee there is no Deceit at all Then  Daniel  laughed and told the King that he should not go in and said Behold now the Pavement and mark well whose Footsteps are these And the King said I see the Foot∣steps of Men Women and Children And then the King was angry and took the Priests with their Wives and Children who shewed  him the privy Doors where they came in and consumed such Things

Spirit GOD throughout all Ages  Amen  The Office on  Friday  ON  Friday  having observ'd all those Things which are used on  Munday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday  and omitted others as is there shewn together with the Versicles of the Prayer and the Prayer as on other Days let him go up and down the whole House and say  The LESSON S  Luke iv  AND he arose out of the Synagogue and entred into  Simon  's House and  Simon  's Wise's Mother was taken with a great Fever And they besought him for her And he stood over her and rebuked the Fever and it left  her And immediately she arose and mini∣stred unto them Now when the Sun was setting all they that had any sick with divers Diseases brought them unto him And he laid his Hands on every one of them and healed them And Devils also came out of many crying out and saying Thou art CHRIST the Son of GOD And he rebuk∣ing them suffered them not to speak For they knew that he was CHRIST  V  I would rather be a Door Keeper in the House of my GOD  R  Then to dwell in the Tents of Ungod∣liness  The PRAYER  O GOD who by the precious Blood of thy dear Son hast been pleased to sanctifie the Ensign of the enlivening Cross grant we beseech thee that thou wouldst be pleased to protect him who is pleased with honouring thy Holy Cross By the same CHRIST our LORD And we beseech thee to grant that  thou wouldst be present in this House in the same merciful Manner to overturn the Frauds of the Devil as thou wast mercifully pre∣sent with King  Solomon  in the House which he built thee By the same our LORD JE∣SUS CHRIST thy Son who livest and reign∣est with thee in Unity of the Holy Ghost GOD for ever and ever  Amen  The Office on  Saturday  ON the  Sabbath  all Things being done which are order'd on  Munday Tuesday Wed∣nesday Thursday  and  Friday  and other Things omitted as is shewn by Notes in those Places together with the Versicles of the Prayer and the Prayer it self let him search through the whole House and say  The LESSON S  Mark iii  AND unclean Spirits when they saw him fell down before him and cried saying Thou art the Son of GOD And he straitly  charged them that they should not make him known And he goeth up into a Mountain and calleth unto him whom he would And they came unto him And he ordained twelve that they should be with him and that he might send them forth to preach and to have Power to heal Sicknesses and to cast out De∣vils  V  The Sparrow hath found her an House  R  And the Turtle a Nest where she may lay her Young  The PRAYER  GRANT O LORD GOD unto us thy Servants that we may enjoy perpetual Peace of Mind and Soundness of Body and by the Intercession of the glorious and blessed  Mary  always a Virgin be delivered from our present Sorrow and obtain thy everlasting Joy through JESUS CHRIST our LORD And be thou so present with us thy humble Servants that as when the Priests came out of the Tabernacle the Cloud of thy Glory filled  thy whole House so let thy Grace illuminate this House to us that go into it that it may be delivered from the Workings of the Devil and be a Dwelling for Men replenish'd with all Benediction through the same our LORD JESUS CHRIST thy Son who livest and reignest with thee in the Unity of the Holy Spirit GOD World without End  Amen  The Office on  Sunday  ON  Sunday  after the Priest has placed him∣self in one of the largest and most sumptu∣ous Parts of the House he shall direct this Exor∣cism to the Demons that haunt it saying  I Exorcise you O ye Demons who have thus boldly presum'd to invade this Ha∣bitation of Men and give such Disquietude to its Inhabitants by the Triune GOD  whose is the Earth and the Fulness thereof the round World and they that dwell therein  by our LORD JESUS CHRIST who continuing  what he was made himself Man conceived by the Holy Ghost and born of a Virgin and who for our Sakes when he had undergone many Sufferings underwent also the Torment of the cruel Cross upon which he bowed his Head and gave up the Ghost that he might obtain for us abundant Grace in the present Life and in the World to come Life everlasting By all the Grace acquir'd for us by the Grace of Faith conferr'd in Baptism of Fortitude in Con∣firmation of Charity in the Eucharist of Ju∣stice in Pennance of Hope in extream Unction of Temperance in Matrimony and of Prudence in holy Orders and by all holy Men and Wo∣men the Saints of GOD who now inherit e∣ternal Glory and by all their Merits that you remove this your presumptuous Power from this House and continue here no longer nor any more vex its Inhabitants  Then let him exorcise the whole House by saying  I Exorcise this House which was built for the Use of humane Kind by the Father Son and Holy Ghost the omnipotent GOD who  built the House of the whole World for Man and put all Things in it in Subjection under his Feet and by CHRIST our LORD who is the Fountain of all Grace and the Origin of all Virtue by his unparallel'd Poverty of which he truely said  The Foxes have Holes and the Birds of the Air have Nests but the Son of Man hath not where to lay his Head  By his Meek∣ness he himself saying of it  Learn of me for I am meek and lowly in Heart  By his Weeping when he beheld  the City  Jerusalem  and wept over it  saying  If thou hadst known  By the Hun∣ger and Thirst of his Righteousness saying  My Meat is to do the Will of my Father which is in Heaven  By his Mercy which excited him to say  I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice  By his Purity of Heart of which he could say  Be ye holy for I am holy  By the Peace which he always loved as at the last he shewed when he said  Peace I leave with you my Peace I give unto you  And by that Persecution which he suffer'd for Righteousness Sake which he him∣self attests saying  If they have persecuted me they will also persecute you  And by the Holy Apostles and by the Effusion of their Blood  and by all holy Men and holy Women that thou mayst be blessed and obtain from GOD above such Virtue by our Ministry that thou mayst become to the evil Spirits a new Hell and a burning Furnace of eternal Horror so that they may flee from every Corner and leave thee intirely free that thou mayst become a comfortable Habitation for Men and that GOD may ever be glorified  After that let him bless the House in the fol∣lowing Manner  V  O LORD hear my Prayer  R  And let my Cry come unto thee  V  He hath bless'd the House of  Israel  R  He hath bless'd the House of  Aaron  Mac B C  THOU O LORD of all Things who hast Need of nothing wast pleased that the Temple of thine Habitation should be among us and therefore now O Holy LORD of all Holiness keep this House ever undefiled which lately was cleansed And grant unto us the  Abundance of thy Goodness that this House may be blessed † and sanctified of thee † by our Ministry that the evil Angels may abdicate it and it may be a Protection for the Faithful a pure Habitation for the Holy Angels and a Possession always worthy of thy Care through our LORD JESUS CHRIST thy Son who liveth and reigneth with thee in the Unity of the Holy Spirit GOD who shall come to judge the Quick and the Dead and the World by Fire  Amen  Then let the Image of our SAVIOUR upon the Cross be erected in an open Part of the prin∣cipal Room in the House and let the Priest sprinkle the whole House with holy Water from Top even to the Bottom saying  The LESSON St  Luke  Chap  xix  AND JESUS entred and passed through  Je∣richo  And behold there was a Man na∣med  Zaccheus  which was the Chief among the Publicanes and he was rich and he sought to see JESUS who he was and he could not for  the Press because he was little of Stature And he ran before and climbed up into a Sy∣comore Tree to see him for he was to pass that Way And when JESUS came to the Place he looked up and saw him and said unto him  Zaccheus  make haste and come down for to Day I must abide at thy House And he made haste and came down and received him joy∣fully And when they saw it they all mur∣mured saying That he was gone to be a Guest with a Man that is a Sinner And  Zaccheus  stood and said unto the LORD Behold LORD the Half of my Goods I give to the Poor And if I have taken any Thing of any Man by false Accusation I restore him four∣fold And JESUS said unto him This Day is Salvation come to this House forasmuch as he also is the Son of  Abraham  For the Son of Man is come to seek and to save that which was lost  When all these Things are done let  Abyssum  which is a Kind of an Herb be procur'd and after it is sign'd with the Sign of the Cross let it be hung up at the four Corners of the House  I suppose the Reason of proceeding after this Manner Day by Day is that the Devil may be gradually banished And to be sure what is observed on the last of the Days  viz  The or∣dering of the  Crucifix  the  holy Water  the  Abys∣sum  tyed to the four Corners of the House is to keep the Devil out when he is out  ST  Austin  tells us a Story of one  Vir  Hesperitius  UbiDomum suam spirituum malignorum vim noxiam perpeti comperisset rogavit nostros me absente Presbyteros ut aliquis eorum illo pergeret cujus orationibus cederent perrexit unus obtulit ibi sacrificium corporis Christi orans quantum po∣tuit ut cessaret illa vexatio Deo protinus miserante ces∣sarit  Aug de Civit Dei Lib    Cap    Hesperi∣tius  whose House was troubled with evil Spi∣rits who came once in his Absence to his Presbyters and begg'd their Assistance Upon which one of them went along with him and when he had offer'd the Sacrifice of the Body of CHRIST and prayed in a most fervent Man∣ner the House by the Mercy of GOD was no longer troubled  HERE is indeed an Account of a House be∣ing haunted but not a Word of any such Or∣der  in the dispossessing it The Priest goes im∣mediately over the Threshold into the troubled Apartment and expells the Spirits by his Pray∣ers Had such Forms been customary in the Days of St  Austin  had the  Crucifix holy Wa∣ter  and  Abyssum  been used no Question but here or somewhere else we should have had some Account of it But these Ages were unac∣quainted with such whimsical Forms of exorci∣sing and if the Story be true it was nothing but Prayer that quieted the House 'Tis ridi∣culous to suppose that the  Prince of Darkness  will yield to such feeble Instruments as  Water  and  Herbs  and  Crucifixes These Weapons are not spiritual but carnal  Whereas in resisting this potent Enemy  we must put on the whole Armour of GOD that we may be able to resist him  Which is such a Composition as is intirely free from the least Allay or Mixture of any such Superstitions  CHAP XII  Of  Saturday  Afternoon how observed of old by the ancient Christians the Church of  Scotland  and the old Church of  England  What End we should observe it for An Exhorta∣tion to the Observation of it  I  T is usual in Country Places and Villages where the Po∣liteness of the Age hath made no great Conquest to observe some particular Times with some Ceremonies which were customary in the Days of our Forefathers Such are the great Festivals of Christmas Easter and several o∣thers  which they observe with Rites and Cu∣stoms appropriated to them  AMONG these we find a great Deference paid to  Saturday Afternoon  above the other worky Days of the Week Then the Labours of the Plough ceast and Refreshment and Ease are over all the Village  THIS seems to be the Remains of a lau∣dable Custom once in this Land but now al∣most buried in that general Contempt of Re∣ligion and love of the World which prevail so much every where of attending the Even∣ing Prayers on Saturday and laying aside the Concerns of this Life to be fitter for the Duties of the Day following For  Baily  Prac Piety  P    it was an holy Custom among our Forefathers when at the Ringing to Prayer the  Eve  be∣fore the  Sabbath  the  Husbandman  would give over his Labour in the Field and the  Tradesman  his Work in the Shop and go to Evening Prayer in the Church to prepare their Souls that their Minds might more  chearfully attend  GOD's Worship  on the  Sab∣bathDay  AND indeed it was the Custom both of the  Jewish  and the Christian Church They nei∣ther of them entred upon the  Sabbath  without some Preparation for it  Moses  Exod xvi  taught the  Jews  to remember the  Sabbath  over Night from whence in all Probability it comes to pass that the Eve of the  Jewish Sabbath  is called the  Preparation  The Preparation mentioned by the Evangelists begun at Three a Clock on  Friday  Afternoon it was proclaimed with the Noise of Trumpets and Horns that they might be better put in Mind of the  Sabbath  's draw∣ing on and of that Preparation which was re∣quisite for it  AMONG the primitive Christians the LORD'S Day was always usher'd in with a  Pernoctation  or  Vigil  They assembled in the House of GOD and sung Psalms and Praises to him a great Part of the Night that they might be better prepa∣red to serve him on his own Day following  Mark xiv  IN the Year of our LORD  William  King of  Scotland  called a Council of the chief Men of his Kingdom at which also was present the Pope's Legate and it was then determin'd that  Saturday  after the twelfth Hour should be kept holy that no one should follow their Business nor Callings but desist as on other Holy Days That they should be put in Mind of it by the Tolling of the Bell and then mind the Business of Religion as on Holy Days be present at the Sermon and hear Vespers that this should be the Practice till  Munday  Morn∣ing and whoever acted otherwise should be se∣verely punished  AND this as is said before was also the Custom of our own Country long before this order'd in  Scotland  For in the Year when  In  Scotia  anno salutis  Gulielmus  Rex primorum Regni sui concilium cogit cui etiam interfuit Pontificius Legatus in quo decretum est ut Saturni Dies abhora Meridiei sacer esset neque quisquam res profanas exerce∣ret quemadmodum aliis quoque festis diebus vetitum id erat Idque campanae pulsu populo indicaretur ac postea sacris rebus ut diebus festis operam darint concionibus interessent vesperas audirent idque in diem lunae face∣rent constituta transgressoribus gravi paena  Boet Lib    de Scot ex Hospin P    King  Edgar  made his Ecclesiastical Laws we find one made to this very Purpose In which it is order'd That  Dies sabbati ab ipsa diei saturni hora pomeridiana ter∣tia usque in luminarii diei diluculum festus agitator c  Seld Analect Angl Lib    Cap    the  Sabbath  or  Sun∣day  shall be observed from  Saturday  at  Mr  Johnson  upon this Law says That the  NoonTide  signifies Three in the Afternoon according to our present Ac∣count And this Practice I conceive continued down to the Reformation In King  Winfred  's Time the LORD's Day did not begin till Sunset on the  Saturday  See    Numb    Three in the Afternoon was  hora nona  in the Latin Account and therefore called  Noon  How it came afterwards to signifie  Midday  I can but guess The Monks by their Rules could not eat their Dinner till they had said their  Noon Song  which was a Service regularly to be said at Three a Clock but they probably anticipated their Devo∣tions and their Dinner by saying their  Noon Song  immedi∣ately after their  Midday Song  and presently falling on I wish they had never been guilty of a worse Fraud than this But it may fairly be supposed that when  Midday  became the Time of Dining and saying  Noon Song  it was for this Rea∣son called Noon by the Monks who were the Masters of the Language during the dark Ages In the Shepherds Alma∣nack Noon is Midday Highnoon three a Clock  Johnson Const Part Ann  Noon till the Light appear on  Munday  Mor∣ning  NOW hence hath come the present Custom of spending a Part of  Saturday  Afternoon with∣out servile Labour And that our Forefathers  when the Bell was heard attended the Evening Prayer not fearing the Loss of Time nor the Necessities of Poverty happy would it be for us would we so banish the Care of the Body for the Care of the Soul Would we leave to converse about secular Business and mind then the Business of Religion would we remember that it is  Luke xxiii  the  Preparation and that the  Sab∣bath  draws on  WHEN  Jacob  was going to worship GOD at  Bethel  he order'd his Family  to  Gen xxxv  put away the strange Gods that were among them and be clean and change their Garments and arise and go to  Bethel He knew that the GOD of Pu∣rity and Holiness was to be approached with the utmost Purity they could possibly cloth them∣selves with And would we before we enter into the Presence of GOD on his own Day endeavour to purifie our selves from the Filth of the World we have contracted in the Days before would we disperse these busy Swarms of Things which so attract our Minds and prepare our selves for the following Day we  should appear before GOD less earthly and more heavenly less sinful and more holy  Our  Psalm cxliv  Prayers would be set forth in his Sight as the Incense and the lifting up of our Hands be an Evening Sacrifice  And like the Smell of  Ja∣cob  's Garment in the Nostrils of his Father the Smell of our Prayers  would  Gen xxvii  be like the Smell of a Field which the LORD hath bles∣sed  AND now what is this Preparation but the  Trimming of our Lamps  against we meet the LORD on the next Day Our Bodies should be refreshed by ceasing early from their Labour that they may be active and vigorous and our Souls washed with Sobriety and Tem∣perance and the private or publick Prayer of the Evening Thus should we meet the LORD at  Bethel  and obtain those Mercies we sought of him there  ART thou then blessed with an Affluence of Things and hath Providence placed Thee above the careful Stations of Life What Rea∣son  then can be sufficient for thy Neglect of this Custom For neither canst thou plead the want of Time neither dost thou dread the straits of Poverty  OR art thou involv'd in the Cares of Busi∣ness  Dost thou earn thy Bread by the Sweat of thy Face and the Labours of thy Hands O well is Thee And happy mayst thou be  Wouldst thou dedicate this small Time to the Service of GOD it would be like the Wi∣dow's Mite which was more than all that was thrown into the Treasury But perhaps thou wilt say thou art under the Yoke subject to Servitude and obliged to work even to the latter End of the Day It may be so but yet as GOD is every where present so wouldst thou Remember that it is the Preparation and put up an Ejaculation at thy Work GOD would accept it and it would prove to thee an equal Good with the other Preparation  Cassian  Haec officiaper totum dici spatium jugiter cum operis adjectione spontanea celebrantur  Cassian Instit Lib    Cap    tells us That the ancient Monks  whilst they were working in the private Cells repeated their Religious Offices And St  Je∣rom  when he is commending the pleasing Re∣tirement of the Village of  Bethlehem  In Christi villa tuta rusticitas est Extra psalmos si∣lentium est Quocunque te verteris arator stiuam reti∣nens alleluia decantatur sudans messor psalmis se advocat c  Hierom Ep    ad Marcel  says That in the Village of CHRIST there is a secure Rusticity No Noise is heard there but the Singing of Psalms Wheresoever you go you have either the PloughMan singing Halle∣lujahs as he's holding the Plough or the sweat∣ing Mower pleasing himself with Hymns or the Vinedresser singing  David  's Psalms These without doubt were acceptable to GOD and thine undoubtedly will be acceptable also  BUT if thou art not ty'd down by Neces∣sity do not say that the common Necessa∣ries of Life require then thy Labour For this is not losing but  Redeeming the Time  what thou spendest in the Care of thy Soul is not lost in the Care of thy Body Never was Man poorer for observing the Duties of Religion If thou lose any Thing of the Wages  of the Day to do the Service of GOD he will take care to supply it thou shalt be no loser  WHY then art thou fearful O Thou of little Faith Why dost thou take so much Thought for thy Life Behold the Fowls of the Air for they sow not neither do they reap nor gather into Barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them Art thou not much better than they And why takest thou thought for Rayment Con∣sider the Lilies of the Field they toil not nei∣ther do they Spin and yet I say unto thee that  Solomon  in all his Glory was not arrayed like one of these And shall he not much more Cloath thee O Thou of little Faith Therefore take no Thought for what thou shalt Eat or what thou shalt Drink or where withal thou shalt be Cloa∣thed but seek thou first the Kingdom of GOD and his Righteousness  prefer the Care of these to the Care of all other Things  and all these Things shall be added unto Thee  LET not then the busy Cares of this Life be any hinderance to thy Care of the other set apart this small Time for the Time of  Preparation and look on it as an Emblem of the whole Time of Life Which is our Day of Preparation for the eternal Sabbath the e∣verlasting Rest the undesturbed Quiet of the other Life  CHAP XIII  Of the YuleClog and ChristmasCandle what they may signifie their Antiqui∣ty the like Customs in other Places  I  N the  Primitive Church  Christ∣masDay was always observ'd as the  Lord'sDay  was and was in like Manner preceeded by an  Eve or Vigil  Hence it is that our Church hath ordered an  Eve  before it which is observed by the Religious as a Day of Preparation for that great Festival  OUR ForeFathers when the common De∣votions of the  Eve  were over and Night was come on were wont to light up  Candles  of an uncommon Size which were called  ChristmasCandles  and to lay a  Log  of Wood upon the Fire which they termed a  YuleClog  or  Christ∣masBlock  These were to Illuminate the House and turn the Night into Day which Custom in some Measure is still kept up in the Nor∣thren Parts  IT hath in all probability been derived from the  Saxons  For  Bede  tells us That this very Night was observed in this Land before by the  Heathen Saxons  They  Incipiebant autem annum ab octavo calendarum  Ja∣nuarii  die ubi nunc natale domini celebramus ipsam noctem nunc nobis sacrosanctam tunc gentili vocabulo mae∣drenack i e matrum noctem appellabant Ob causam ut suspicamur ceremoniarum quas in ea pervigiles age∣bant  Beda de Rat Temp Cap    began says he their Year on the Eight of the Calends of  January  which is now our  ChristmasDay  And the very Night before which is now Holy to us was by them called  Maedrenack  or the  Night of Mothers  because as we imagine of those Ceremonies which were perform'd that Night The  YuleClog  therefore hath probably been a Part of that Night's Ceremonies The very Name seems to speak it and tells its Ori∣ginal to every Age  IT seems to have been used as an Emblem of the return of the  Sun  and the lengthening of the Days For as  December  guili eodem quo  Januarius  nomine voca∣turGuili a conversione solis in auctum diei nomen accipit  Beda ibid  both  December  and  Jan∣uary  were called  Guili or  Gehol  or  Geol  AnglSax Jol vel Jul Dan Sax And to this Day in the North  Yule Youle  signifies the solemn Festival of  Christmas  and were Words used to denote a Time of Festivity very anciently and before the Introduction of Christianity among the Northern Nations Learned Men have disputed much about this Word some deriving it from  Julius Caesar  others from the Word  Geh∣theol  a  Wheel  as  Bede  who would therefore have it so called because of the Return of the Sun's annual Course after the Winter Solstice But he writing  de Rat Temp  speaks rather as an Astronomer than an Antiquary The best Antiquaries derive it from the Word  Ol Ale  which was much used in their Festivities and merry Meetings And the  I in Iol iul cimbr as the Ge and Gi in Gehol Geol Giul Sax  are premised only as Intensives to add a little to the Signification and make it more emphatical  Ol  or  Ale  as has been observed did not only signifie the Liquor they made Use of but gave Denomination likewise to their greatest Festivals as that of Gehol or Yule at  Midwinter  and as is yet plainly to be discern'd in that Custom of the  WhitsunAle  at the other great Festival  Elstob Sax Hom Birth DayGreg Append P    Bishop  Stilingfleet  has also taken Notice of this and says  That some think the Name of this Feast was taken from  Iola  which in the  Gothick  Language signifies to  make merry  But he seems not inclinable to this Opinion and therefore tells us that  Olaus Rudbeck  thinks the former  viz  Its being called so from the Joy that was conceived at the Return of the Sun more proper not only from  Bede  's Authority but because in the old  Ru∣nick Fasti  a Wheel was used to denote that Festival  Stilling Orig Britan  Yule  upon Ac∣count  of the Sun's Returning and the Increase of the Days so I am apt to believe the Log has had the Name of the  YuleLog  from its being burnt as an Emblem of the returning Sun and the Increase of its Light and Heat  THIS was probably the Reason of the Cu∣stom among the  Heathen Saxons  but I cannot think the Observation of it was continued for the same Reason after Christianity was em∣braced For Bishop  Stillingfleet  observes in his  Origines Britanicae  That tho' the ancient  Saxons  observed Twelve Days at that Time and sacri∣ficed to the Sun in hopes of his Returning yet when Christianity prevail'd all these Ido∣latrous Sacrifices were laid aside and that Time of Feasting was joined with the religious So∣lemnity of that Season which in other Parts of the World were observed by Christians  And in like Manner as these Days of Feasting were joined with the religious Solemnities of that Season so the keeping up of this Custom seems to have been done with another View than it was originally If a Conjecture may be allowed it might have been done on Account  of our Saviour's Birth which happened that Night For as the Burning of it before Chri∣stianity was an Emblem of the Coming of the Sun which they worshipped as their God so the continuing it after might have been for a Symbol of that Light which was that Night born into the World  The Light that shineth in Darkness the Light that lightned the  Gen∣tiles  that turn'd them from Darkness to Light and from the Power of Satan unto GOD  AND indeed it will be some strengthening of the Conjecture that Light has been the Em∣blem of several Things both in Scripture and in the ancient Church For the Scripture makes use of it and the Church in Imitation of the Scripture as a lively Representation of several Things Thus Light is the Emblem of  GOD For GOD is Light  says the Apostle St  John  John  the Baptist was a Burning and a Shining Light  And therefore in some Places it  Feruntur quoque brandae seu faces ardentes fiunt ignos qui significant sanctum  Joannem  qui fuit lumen lucerna ardens praecedens praecursor verae lucis quae illuminat omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum  Durand Rational Lib    Cap    Nu    is  customary to carry Torches on St  John the Baptist  's Eve to represent St  John Baptist  him∣self who was  a Burning and a Shining Light and a Preparer of the Way for the True Light that lighteneth every Man that cometh into the World  The Apostles were  the Light of the World  and as our Saviour was frequently called  Light  so was this his Coming into the World signified and pointed out by the Em∣blems of Light  It was then says our Coun∣tryman  Gregory  the longest Night in all the Year and it was the midst of that and yet there was Day where he was For a glo∣rious and betokening Light shined round a∣bout this  Holy Child  So says Tradition and so the Masters describe the Night Piece of the Nativity  If this be called in Questi∣on as being only Tradition it is out of Dis∣pute that the Light which illuminated the Fields of  Bethlehem  and shone round about the  Shepherds  as they were watching their Flocks was an Emblem of that Light which was then come into Word What  Quid est quod apparenti angelo divinae quoque clari∣tatis splendor eos circumdedit quod nunquam in tota te∣stamenti veteris serie reperimus cum tam innumeris vi∣cibus angeli prophetis justis apparuerunt nusquam eos fulgore divinae lucis homines circumdedisse legimus nisi quod hoc privilegium recte huius temporis dignitati ser∣vatum est c  Bed Hyem de Sanct in Gal Cant  can be the meaning  says  venerable Bede  that this Apparition of An∣gels was surrounded with that heavenly Light which is a Thing we never meet with in all the old Testament For tho' Angels have ap∣peared to Prophets and holy Men yet we ne∣ver read of their Appearing in such Glory and Splendor before It must surely be because this Privilege was reserved for the Dignity of this Time For when the true Light of the World was born in the World it was very proper that the Proclaimer of his Nativity should appear in the Eyes of Men in such an heavenly Light as was before unseen in the World And that  supernatural Star  which was the Guide of the  Eastern Magi  was a Fi∣gure of that  Star  which was risen out of  Ja∣cob of that Light which should lighten the  Gentiles  GOD says Bishop  Taylor  sent a miraculous Star to invite and lead them to a new and more glorious Light the Light of Grace and Glory  IN Imitation of this as  Gregory  tells us the Church went on with the Ceremony And hence it was that for the three or four First  Centuries  the whole  Eastern Church  called the Day which they observed for our Saviour's Nativity the  Epiphany  or Manifestation of the Light And  Cassian  tells us  Intra  Egypti  Regionem mos iste traditione antiqua servatur ut peracto epiphaniorum die c  Cassian Coll    C    That it was a Custom in  Egypt  handed down by Tradition as soon as the  Epiphany  or  Day of Light  was over  c  Hence also came that ancient Custom of the same Church taken Notice of by St  Jerome  of  Absque martyrum reliquiis per totas orientis ecclesias quum legendum est evangelium accenduntur luminaria jam sole rutilante non utique ad fugandas tenebras sed ad signum laetitiae demonstrandum c  Jerom Cont Vigil Cap    lighting up Candles at the Read∣ing of the Gospel even at NoonDay and that not to drive away the Darkness but to speak their Joy for the good Tydings of the Gospel and be an Emblem of that Light which the Psalmist says  was a Lamp unto his Feet and a Light unto his Paths  LIGHT therefore having been an Emblem of so many Things and particularly of our LORD JESUS CHRIST both in the sacred History and in the Practice of the Church it is no way improbable that after their Conver∣sion the  Saxons  used it as an Emblem of him who that Night came into the World and was the Light thereof In the City of  Constantino∣ple  on the  Eve of Easter  there was a Custom practised much like this of ours on  ChristmasEve  For then the whole City was illumina∣ted with Tapers and Torches which continued all the Night turning the Night into Day till almost the Day appeared The Reason of this Custom was to represent that Light which the next Day arose upon the World The Diffe∣rence between these two Customs is that of the Time the Reason of their Observation is much the same The one illuminated the  Eve of Easter  that there might be an Emblem of the Sun of Righteousness who the next Day arose upon the World the other the Eve of  Yule  to give an Emblem of that Light which  Eus Vit Constan Cap    Lib    was the  Day spring from on High  Nay this Eve of  Yule  as  Gregory  tells us  was illumi∣nated with so many Tapors among the An∣cients as to give to the  Vigil  the Name of  Vigilia Luminum  and the Ancients says he did well to send Lights one to another whatever some think of the  ChristmasCandle  CHAP XIV  Of adorning the Windows at  Christmas  with  Laurel  What the  Laurel  is an Emblem of An Objection against this Custom taken off  A  NOTHER Custom observed at this Season is the adorning of Windows with  Bay  and  Laurel  It is but seldom observed in North but in the SouthernParts it is very Common particularly at our  Universities  where it is Customary to adorn not only the Common Windows of the  Town  and of the  Colleges  but also to bedeck the  Cha∣pels  of the  Colleges  with  Branches of Laurel  THE  Laurel  was used among the ancient  Romans  as an Emblem of several Things and  in particular of  Laurus pacifera habetur quam praetendi inter ar∣matos hostes quietis sit indicium Romanis praecipue lae∣titiae victoriarumque nuntia  Polyd Virg de Rer Invent Lib    Cap    P    Peace  and Joy and Victory And I imagine it has been used at this Season by Christians as an Emblem of the same Things as an Emblem of Joy for the Victory gain'd o∣ver the Powers of Darkness and of that  Peace on Earth that Goodwill towards Men  which the Angels sung over the Fields of  Bethlehem  IT  The general Defence of the three Articles of the Church of  England  D    has been made use of by the  NonCon∣formists  as an Argument against Ceremonies that the second Council of  Bracara  Non liceat iniquas observantias agere Kalendarum ociis vacare Gentilibus neque lauro neque viriditate ar∣borum cingere domos Omnis enim haec observatio Pa∣ganismi est  Bracc Can    Instell  Can  forbad Christians  to deck their Houses with Bay Leaves and Green Boughes  But the Council does not mean that it was wrong in Christians to make use of these Things but only  at the same Time with the Pagans when they observed and solemnized their Paganish Pastime and Worship  And of this Prohibiti∣on  they give this Reason in the same  Canon Omnis haec observatio paganismi est  All this kind of Custom doth hold of Paganism Be∣cause the outward Practice of  Heathenish Rites  perform'd jointly with the Pagans themselves could not but imply a Consent in Paganism  BUT at present there is no hazard of any such Thing It may be an Emblem of Joy to us without confirming any in the Practice of  Heathenism  The  Time  the  Place  and the  Reasons  of the  Ceremony  are so widely diffe∣rent that tho' formerly to have observed it would unquestionably have been a Sin it is now become harmless comely and decent  CHAP XV  Of the Christmas Carol an ancient Cu∣stom The common Observation of it very unbecoming  A  S soon as the Morning of the  Nativity  appears it is custom∣ary among the common People to sing a  ChristmasCarol  which is a Song upon the Birth of our Saviour and generally sung with some  Such are  The NewYear's Songs  and that whose Bur∣den is  Hagmena  The Word  Hagmena  is the same as  Hagia∣meene  or the  Holy Month Angli  says  Hospinnian Halegmonath quasi sacrum mensem vocant  Hosp de Orig Eth P    o∣thers from the Nativity to the TwelvethDay the Continuance of  Christmas  It comes they say from  Cantare  to sing and  Rola  which is  an Interjection of Joy For in ancient Times the Burden of the Song when Men were Mer∣ry was  Rola Rola  THIS kind of Songs is of an Ancient stand∣ing They were sung early in the Church it self in memory of the Nativity as the many HYMNS for that Season manifestly declare  Tertullian  says  Ut quisque de scripturis sanctis vel de proprio inge∣nio potest provocatur in medium Deo cantare  Tertul Advers Gent C    it was customary among the Christians at their Feasts to bring those who were able to sing into the Midst and make them sing a Song unto  GOD  either out of the Holy Scripture or of their own Composing and Invention And as this was done at their Feasts so no doubt it was observed at the great Feast of the Nativity which Song no Question of it was to them what the  ChristmasCarol  should be to us In after Ages we have it also taken Notice of For  Durand  tells us  In quibusdam quoque locisIn natali Praelati cum suis clericis ludant vel in domibus episcopalibus Ita ut etiam descendantAd cantus  Durand Rat Lib    C    S    That on the Day of the  Nativity  it was usual for the Bi∣shops  of some Churches to sing among their Clergy in the Episcopal House which Song was undoubtedly a  ChristmasCarol  THE Reason of this Custom seems to be an Imitation of the  Gloria in Excelsis  or  Glory be to GOD on High  c which was sung by the Angels as they hovered o'er the Fields of  Beth∣lehem  in the Morning of the Nativity For e∣ven that Song as the learned Bishop  Taylor  ob∣serves was a ChristmasCarol  As soon  says he  as these blessed Choristers had sung their ChristmasCarol and taught the Church a Hymn to put into her Offices for Ever in the Anniver∣sary of this Festivity the Angels  c  WAS this performed with that Reverence and Decency which are due to a Song of this Nature in Honour of the Nativity and Glo∣ry to our LORD it would be very commend∣able but to sing it as is generally done in the midst of  Rioting and Chambering and Wan∣toness  is no Honour but Disgrace no Glory but an Affront to that Holy Season a Scandal to Religion and a Sin against CHRIST  CHAP XVI  Of NewYear'sDay's Ceremonies The NewYear'sGift an harmless Custom wishing a good NewYear no Way sin∣ful Mumming a Custom which ought to be laid aside  A  S the Vulgar are always very careful to End the  old Year  well so they are also careful of Beginning well the  new one  As they End the For∣mer with a hearty Compotation so they begin the Latter with the Sending of Presents which are termed NewYear'sGifts to their Friends and Acquaintances The Original of both which Customs is  Et sic quidem annum veterem terminamus novum∣que auspicamur inauspicatis prorsus dirisque auspiciis  Hosp de Orig Fest Christ P    superstitious and sinful  and was observed that the succeeding Year might be prosperous and successful  BISHOP  Orig Brit P    Stilling fleet  tells us That a∣mong the  Saxons  of the  Northren Nations  the Feast of the NewYear was observed with more than ordinary Jollity Thence as  Ollaus Wormius  and  Scheffer  observe they recko∣ned their Age by so many  Iola  in the  Gothick  Language signifies to  make merry  Stilling  ibid  Jola  's and  Snorro Sturleson  describeth this NewYear's Feast just as  Buchannan  sets out the  British Saturalia  by Feasting and sending Presents or NewYear's Gifts one to another  THE Poet  Naogeorgus  says  JaniCalendis  Atque etiam strenae charis mittuntur amicis  Conjuiibus{que} viri donant gnatis{que} parentes  Et domini famulis c  Hosp de Orig Fest Christ P    That it was usual at that Time for Friends to present each other with a NewYear's Gift for the Hus∣band the Wife the Parents their Children and Master's their Servants which as  Hospin  ibid  Hos∣pinian  tells us was an ancient Custom of the Heathens and afterwards practis'd by the Chri∣stians  AND no doubt those Christians were high∣ly worthy of Censure who imagined as the Heathens did that the sending of a Present then was any way  Lucky  and an  Omen  of the Success of the following Year For this was the very Thing that made both several Holy Men and some general Councils take notice of and forbid any such Custom because the Observance of it out of any such Design and View was Superstitious and Sinful We are told in a Place of St  Austin  Citatur locus ex  Augustino  in quo praecipitur ne ob∣serventur calendae  Januarii  in quibus cantilenae quaedam commessationes ad invicem dona donentur quasi in principio anni boni fati augurio  Hosp de Orig Fest Christ in Fest Jan  the Observati∣on of the Calends of  January  is forbid the Songs which were wont to be sung on that Day the Feastings and the Presents which were then sent as a Token and Omen of a good Year But to send a Present at that Time out of E∣steem or Gratitude or Charity is no where  forbid On the Contrary it is Praise worthy For tho' the  In calendas  Januarias  antiqui patres vehementius in∣vehebantur non propter istas missitationes adinvicem mutui amoris pignora sed propter diem idolis dicatum Propter ritus quosdam profanos sacrilegos in illa solen∣nitate adhibitos  Mountacut Orig Eccles Pars Prior P    ancient Fathers did vehemently invey against the Observation of the Calends of  January  yet it was not because of those Pre∣sents and Tokens of mutual Affection and Love that passed but because the Day it self was dedicated to Idols and because of some pro∣phane Rites and Ceremonies they observed in solemnizing it If then I send a NewYear's Gift to my Friend it shall be a Token of my Friendship if to my Benefactor a Token of my Gratitude if to the  Poor  which at this Time must never be forgot it shall be to make their Hearts sing for Joy and give Praise and Adoration to  the Giver of all good Gifts  ANOTHER old Custom at this Time is the wishing of a  good NewYear  either when a NewYear's Gift is presented or when Friends meet or when a NewYear's Song is sung at  the Door the Burden of which is  we wish you a happy NewYear  THIS is also a Custom among the Modern  Jews  who on the first Day of the Month  The Month  Tisri  was the seventh Month according to the  Jews  sacred Computation and therefore it is com∣manded to be celebrated the first Day of the seventh Month  Lev xxiii  But according to their civil Computation it was their first Month so that Feast may be termed their NewYear's Day  Goodw Antiq Lib Cap  Tisri  have a splended  Reperiunt mensam dulcissimis cibis instructam E  cum assederint quivis partem de cibis illis sumit annus inquit bonus dulcis sit nobis omnibus  Hosp de Fest Orig P    Entertainment and wish each other a happy NewYear  NOW the Original of this Custom is Hea∣thenish as appears by the Feasting and Presents before mentioned which were a Wish for a good Year And it was customary among the Hea∣thens on the Calends of  January  to go about and sing a  NewYear's Song Hospinian  there∣fore tells us That  Discurrunt namque noctu tam senes quam juvene  promiscui sexus cantantes prae foribus divitum quibus fae¦licem annum cantando precantur optant  Hospin  Orig Fest Jan  when Night comes on not only the Young but also the Old of both  Sexes run about here and there and sing a Song at the Doors of the wealthier People in which they wish them a  happy NewYear  This he speaks indeed of the Christians but he calls it an exact Copy of the Heathens Custom  BUT however I cannot see the Harm of re∣taining this ancient Ceremony so it be not used superstitiously nor attended with Obsce∣nity and Lewdness For then there will be no more in it than an hearty Wish for each o∣thers Welfare and Prosperity no more Harm than wishing a good Day or good Night than in bidding one  GOD speed  or than in wishing to our Friend what  Abraham  's Servant did to himself  O  Gen xxiv  LORD GOD of my Master  A∣braham  I pray thee send me good speed this Day  THERE is another Custom observed at this Time which is called among us  Mumming  which is a changing of Clothes between Men and Women who when dress'd in each others Habits go from one Neighbour's House to ano∣ther  and partake of their  ChristmasCheer  and make merry with them in Disguise by dancing and singing and such like Merriments  THIS  Hoc prorsus fit ad imitationem ludorum sigillarium oscillarium occillatorum qui pars erat saturnaliorum circa mensem  Januarium  passim in domibus privatim non publice exercebantur inter familias  Hosp de Orig c  is an Imitation of the Customs of the  Sigillaria  or Festival Days which were added to the ancient  The Original of the  Saturnalia  as to the Time is unknown  Macrobius  assuring us That it was celebrated in  Italy  long before the Building of  Rome  The Story of  Saturn  in whose Honour it was kept every Body is ac∣quainted with As to the Manner of the Solemnity be∣sides the Sacrifices and other Parts of publick Worship there were several lesser Observations worth our Notice As first the Liberty now allowed to Servants to be free and merry with their Masters so often alluded to in Authors 'Tis probable this was done in Memory of the Liberty en∣joy'd in the  Golden Age  under  Saturn  before the Names of Servant and Master were known to the World Be∣sides this they sent Presents to one another among Friends No War was to be proclaim'd and no Offender executed The Schools kept a Vacation and nothing but Mirth and Freedom was to be met with in the City They kept at first only one Day the Fourteenth of the Kalends of  Janu∣ary  but the Number was afterwards increas'd to three four five and some say seven Days  Kennet Rom Antiq P  Saturnalia  and observed by the Heathens in  January  which was a going in Disguise not publickly or to any indiffe∣rent  Place but privately and to some well known Families  THIS kind of Custom received a deserved Blow from the Church and was taken Notice of in the Synod  Can Trull    Bal    of  Trullus  where it was de∣creed that the Days called the  Calends  should be intirely strip'd of their Ceremonies and the Faithful should no longer observe them That the publick Dancings of Women should cease as being the Occasion of much Harm and Ruin and as being invented and observed in honour of their Gods and therefore quite averse to the Christian Life They there∣fore decreed that no Man should be Cloathed with a Woman's Garment no Woman with a Man's  IT were to be wish'd this Custom which is still so Common among us at this Season of the Year was laid aside as it is the Occasion of much  Hoc autem quum noctu fiat nemini dubium esse de∣bet quin sub hoc praetextu multa obscaena turpia per∣petrantur simul  Hosp de Orig Fest    Uncleanness and Debauchery and  directly opposite to the Word of GOD  The  Deut xxii  Woman shall not wear that which partaineth unto a Man neither shall a Man put on a Woman's Garment for all that do so are Abomination unto the LORD thy GOD  CHAP XVII  Of the Twelfth Day how observed The Wickedness of observing the Twelve Days after the common Way  O  N the  Epiphany  or  Manifestati∣on of CHRIST to the  Gen∣tiles commonly called the TwelfthDay the  Eastern Magi  were guided by the Star to pay their Homage to their Saviour and because they came that Day which is the Twelfth after the Day of the Nativity it is therefore called the  TwelfthDay  The TwelfthDay it self is one of the great∣est of the Twelve and of more jovial Obser∣vation than the Others for the visiting of  Friends and ChristmasGambols The Rites of this Day are different in divers Places tho' the End of them is much the same in all namely to do honour to the Memory of the  Eastern Magi  whom they suppose to have been Kings In  In  Gallia  unus ex ministris cIdem in  Germa∣nia  c  Hospin in Epiphan  France  one of the Courtiers is chosen King whom the King him∣self and the other Nobles attend at an En∣tertainment In  Germany  they observe the same Thing on this Day in Academies and Cities where the Students and Citizens create one of themselves  King  and provide a Magni∣ficent Banquet for him and give him the At∣tendance of a  King  or a  stranger Guest  Now this is answerable to that Custom of the  Sa∣turnalia  of  Masters  making  Banquets  for their  Servants  and waiting on them and no Doubt this Custom has in Part sprung from that  NOT many Years ago this was a common  ChristmasGambol  in both our  Universities  and it is still usual in other Places of our  Land to give the Name of  King  or  Queen  to that Person whose extraordinary Luck hits upon that Part of the divided  Cake  which is honour'd above the others with a  Bean  in it  BUT tho' this be generally the greatest of the Twelve yet the others preceeding are observed with Mirth and Jollity generally to Excess Was this Feasting confined within the Bounds of Decency and Moderation and gave more way than it does to the Exercises and the Re∣ligious Duties of the Season it would have nothing in it immoral or sinful The keeping up of Friendship and Love and old Acquain∣tance has nothing in it harmful but the Misfortune is Men upon that Bottom act ra∣ther like Brutes than Men and like Heathens than Christians and the Preservation of Friendship and Love is nothing else but a Pretence for Drunkenness and Rioting and Wantonness And such I am afraid hath been the Observation of the ChristmasHolydays since the holiest Times of the Christian Church and the generality of Men have rather look'd  upon them as a  Vide Bishop  Blackall  's Sermon on the Lawfulness and the right Manner of keeping Christmass and other Christian Festi∣vals  Time of Eating and Drink∣ing and Playing than of returning Praises and Thanksgivings to GOD for the greatest Benefit he ever bestow'd upon the Sons of Men  Gregory Nazianzen  in that excellent Orati∣on of his upon ChristmasDay says Let us not celebrate the Feast after an Earthly but an Heavenly Manner let not our Doors be crown'd let not Dancing be encourag'd let not the Crosspaths be adorned the Eyes fed nor the Ears delighted  c  Let us not Feast to excess nor be Drunk with Wine  c  From this we may clearly see what has been the Custom in these Days And in all Probability it has been much the same among us from the Beginning of Christianity However fabulous that Story may be taken Notice of by  Origin Britan Stilling  Bishop  Stilling fleet  from  Hector Boethius  That King  Arthur  kept with his Nobles at  York  a very  prophane  Christmas  for  ChristmasDay is said to be none of the twelve Days but one of the twenty For if it was added it would make thirteen Days which are the thirteen Days here mentioned It is said to be one of the twenty Days because as I ima∣gine it was reckon'd among those twenty Days in which the Church forbad Fasting For in the Laws of  Canutus  it is order'd  Atque ab ipso natali Jesu Christi die ad octavam ab Epiphania lucem jejunia nemo observato nisi quidam ju∣dicio ac voluntate fecerit sua aut id ei fuerit a sacerdote imperatum  Seld Analect Lib    P    That no Man shall fast from  ChristmasDay  till after the  Octave  of the  Epiphany  except he do it out of Choice or it be commanded him of the Priest  Thirteen Days toge∣ther and that such Jollity and Feasting then had its Original from him  But however these Words if true may be a Testimony of the too great Antiquity of the Abuse of this Festival yet they will by no Means justifie  Buchannan  's Comment upon them For as the learned Bishop goes on  Buchannan  is so well pleased with this notable Observation that he sets it down for good History saying upon it that the old  Saturnalia  were re∣new'd only the Days increased and  Sa∣turn  's Name chang'd to  Caesar  's For says he we call the Feast  Julia  But why should the Name of  Saturn  be changed into  Caesar  's Was he worshipped for a GOD among the  British  Christians as  Saturn  was among the old  Pagans  But the Name  Julia  imports it by no Means For  Buchannon  does not prove that this Name was ever used for that Festival among the  Britains  and the  Saxons  who brought in both the Name and the Feast give another  Vide Chap Christ Candle  Reason for it  BUCHANNAN  seems therefore to have a great deal more Malice than Truth on his Side But however such Revellings and Fro∣licks and Extravagances whether or not de∣rived from the old  Saturnalia  as are customary at this Season do come very near to if not ex∣ceed its Liberties In particular what commo∣ner at this Season than  for Men to rise early in the Morning that they may follow strong Drink and continue untill Night till Wine inflame them As if CHRIST who came into the World to save us and was manifested to destroy the Works of the Devil  was to be honour'd with the very Works he came to destroy  WITH some  Christmass  ends with the  Twelve Days  but with the Generality of the Vulgar not till  Candlemass  Till then they continue Feasting and are ambitious of keeping some of their  ChristmassChear  and then are as fond of getting quit of it  Durand  tells us  Hanc Quadragessimam cum gaudio celebramus quia Christi incarnatio fuit gaudium angelorum hominum  Durand Lib    C    They ce∣lebrated this Time with Joy because the Incar∣nation of CHRIST was the Occasion of Joy to Angels and Men But the lengthening of the Time from Twelve to Forty Days seems to have been done out of Honour to the  Virgin  Mary  's Lyingin  Under the old Law the Time of Purification was Forty Days which was to Women then what the  Month  is to Women now And as during that Time the Friends and Relations of the Women pay them Visits and do them abundance of Honour so this Time seems to have been calculated to do Honour to the Virgin's Lyingin  THERE is a Canon in the Council of  Trul∣lus  Can    Trul Bal  against those who bak'd a Cake in ho∣nour  of the Virgin's Lyingin in which it is decreed that no such Ceremony should be observed because it was otherwise with her at the Birth of our Saviour than with all other Women She suffer'd no Pollution and therefore needed no Purification but only in Obedience to the Law If then the Baking of a single Cake was faulty how much more so many Feasts in her Honour  CHAP XVIII  Of St  Paul  's Day The Observation of the Weather a Custom of the Heathens and handed down by the Monks The Apostle St  Paul  himself is against such Observations The Opinion of St  Au∣stin  upon them  T  HE Observation of the Wea∣ther which is made on this Day is altogether ridiculous and superstitious If it hap∣pen to be unclouded and without Rain it is look'd upon as an Omen of the following Year's Success if otherwise that the Year will be unfortunate Thus the old Verse  Clara dies  Pauli  bona tempora denotat anni  Si fuerint venti denarrant praelia genti  Si nix aut pluviae pereunt animalia quaeque  THE Interpretation of which is very well known to be this  If St  Paul  's Day be fair and clear  It doth betide a happy Year  If blustring Winds do blow aloft  Then Wars will trouble our Realm full oft  And if it chance to Snow or Rain  Then will be dear all Sorts of Grain  SUCH also is the Observation of St  Swi∣thin  's Day which if rainy is a Token that it will rain for forty Days successively such is the Observation of  Si sol splendescat  Maria  purificante  Major erit glacies post festum quam fuit ante  CandlemasDay  such is  Chil∣dermasDay  such  Valentine'sDay  and some o∣thers  HOW St  Paul's Day  came to have this par∣ticular Knack of foretelling the good or evil  Fortune of the following Year is no easy Matter to find out The Monks who were undoubtedly the first who made this wonder∣ful Observation have taken Care it should be handed down to Posterity but why and for what Reason this Observation was to stand good they have taken Care to conceal In Church Affairs indeed they make free with handing down  Traditions  from Generation to Generation which being approved by an in∣fallible Judgment are to be taken for granted but as far as I hear they never pretended to an infallible Spirit in the Study of the Pla∣nets One may therefore without the Sus∣picion of Heresy or fear of the  Inquisition  make a little Inquiry into this Affair and see whether it be true or false whether it is built upon any Reason or no Reason whether still to be observed or only laugh'd at as a Mon∣kish Dream  NOW as it is the Day of that Saint  the great Apostle St  Paul I cannot see there is any Thing to be built upon He did indeed  labour more abundantly than all the Apostles  but ne∣ver  that I heard in the Science of Astrology And why his Day should therefore be a stand∣ing  Almanack  to the World rather than the Day of any other  Saint  will be pretty hard to find out I am sure there is a good Num∣ber of them have as much Right to Rain or fair Weather as St  Paul  and if St  Andrew  St  Thomas  c have not as much Right to Wind or Snow let the Reader judge  AS it is the Twenty fifth Day of  January  one would think that could be no Reason For what is that Day more than another In∣deed they do give some Shew of Reason why Rain should happen about the Time of St  Swithin  which is this About the Time of his Feast which is on the Fourteenth of  July  there are two rainy  Constellations  which are called  Praecepe  and  Asellus  which arise  cosmi∣cally  and generally produce Rain And to be sure in the Course of the Sign  Aquarius  there may be both Rain and Wind and fair Weather but how these can foretell the Destiny of the Year is the Question  AS then there is nothing in the  Saint  or his Day to prognosticate any such Thing I mean as it is the Day of St  Paul  or the Twenty fifth of  January  so I must confess I cannot find out what may be the Ground of this particular Observation But however thus much is very obvious that this Observation is an exact Copy of that superstitious Custom a∣mong the Heathens of observing one Day as good and another as bad For among them were lucky and unlucky Days some were  dies atri  and some  dies albi  the  atri  were pointed out in their  Calendar  with a black Character the  albi  with a white the former to denote it a Day of bad Success the latter a Day of good Thus have the  Monks  in the dark and unlear∣ned Ages of Popery copy'd after the Heathens and dream'd themselves into the like Supersti∣tions esteeming one Day more successful than another and so according to them it is very unlucky to begin any Work upon  ChildermassDay  and what Day soever that falls on whe∣ther on a  Munday Tuesday  or any other no∣thing must be begun on that Day through the Year St  Paul  's Day is the Year's  FortuneTeller  St  Mark  's Day is the Prognosticator of your Life and Death  c  and so instead of perswading the People to lay aside the Whims and Fancies of the Heathen World they brought them so effectually in that they are still reigning in many Places to this Day  BUT of all the Days of the Year they could not have chosen one so little to the Pur∣pose For the very Saint whose Day is so observed has himself cautioned them against any such Observation For in the Fourth Chapter of his Epistle to the  Galations  he tells them how dangerous it was  to observe Days and Months and Times and Years  which is not as some would perswade us to Caution us against the Observation of any Day but the  Lord'sDay  but only that we should not ob∣serve the abolished Feasts of the  Jews  nor the abominable Feasts of the  Gentiles  nor their superstitious Observation of fortunate and un∣fortunate Days St  Austin  upon this Place hath these Words  Non itaque dies observemus annos menses tempora ne audiamus ab apostolo timeo vos ne forte sine causa laboraverim in vobis Eos enim culpat qui dicunt non profisiscar quia posterus est aut quia luna sic fertur vel profisiscar ut prospera cedant quia ita se ha∣bet positio siderum c  Beda ex Augustin in loc  Let us not observe Years  and Months and Times least we hear the A∣postle telling us I am afraid of you least I have shewn on you labour in Vain For the Persons he blames are those who say I will not set forward on my Journey because it is the next Day after such a Time or because the Moon is so or I'll set forward that I may have Luck because such is just now the Po∣sition of the Stars I will not Traffick this Month because such a Star presides or I will because it does I shall plant no Vines this Year because it is LeapYear  c  THE learned Mr  Bingham  has among se∣veral others a Quotation from the same St  Austin  on these superstitious Observations with which I shall conclude this Chap∣ter  To this kind says he belong all Li∣gatures and Remedies which the School of Physicians reject and condemn whether in Inchantments or in certain Marks which  Bingham    L C    Antiq Eccl P    Aust de Doct Christ L    C    they call Characters or in some other Things which are to be hanged and bound about the Body and kept in a dancing Posture not for any Temperament of the Body but for certain Significations either Ocult or Manifest Which by a gentler Name they call Physical that they may not seem to affright Men with the Appearance of Super∣stition but do good in a natural Way Such are Earrings hanged upon the Tip of each Ear and Rings made of an Ostriches Bones for the Finger or when you are told in a Fit of Convulsions or Shortness of Breath to hold your left Thumb with your right Hand To which may be added a thousand vain Observations as if any of our Members beat if when two Friends are talking together a Stone or a Dog or a Child happens to come between them they tread the Stone to Pieces as the Divi∣der of their Friendship and this is toller∣able in Comparison of beating an innocent Child that comes between them But it is more pleasant that sometimes the Childrens Quarrel is revenged by the Dogs for ma∣ny  Times they are so superstitious as to dare to beat the Dog that comes between them who turning again upon him that smites him sends him from seeking a vain Remedy to seek a real Physician indeed Hence proceed likewise these other Super∣stitions For a Man to tread upon his Thre∣shold when he passes by his own House to return back to Bed again if he chance to sneeze as he is putting on his Shoes to return into his House if he stumble at his Going out if the Rats knaw his Clothes to be more terrified with the Suspicion of some future Evil than concerned for the present Loss He says  Cato  gave a wise and smart Answer to such an one who came in some Consternation to consult him about the Rats having knawed his Stock∣ings that said he is no great Wonder but it would have been a Wonder indeed if the Stockings had knawed the Rats St  Austin  mentions this witty Answer of a wise Heathen to convince Christians the better of the Unreasonableness and Vanity of all such superstitious Observations And  he concludes that all such Arts whether of triffling or more noxious Superstition are to be rejected and avoided by Christians as proceeding originally from some pernici∣ous Society between Men and Devils and being the Compacts and Agreements of such treacherous and deceitful Friendship The Apostle forbids us to have Fellowship with Devils and that he says respects not only Idols and Things offered to Idols but all imaginary Signs pertaining to the Worship of Idols and also all Remedies and other Observations which are not appointed pub∣lickly by GOD to promote the Love of GOD and our Neighbour but proceed from the private Fancies of Men and tend to delude the Hearts of poor deluded Mortals For these Things have no natural Virtue in them but owe all their Efficacy to a pre∣sumptuous Confederacy with Devils And they are full of pestiferous Curiosity tor∣menting Anxiety and deadly Slavery They were first taken up not for any real Power to be discerned in them but gained their Power by Mens observing them And there∣fore  by the Devil's Art they happen dif∣ferently to different Men according to their own Apprehensions and Presumptions For the great Deceiver knows how to procure Things agreeable to every Man's Temper and ensnare him by his own Suspicions and Consent  CHAP XIX  Of  CandlemassDay  why so called the Blasphemy of the Church of  Rome  in consecrating Wax Candles  T  HIS Day goes under several De∣nominations It is called the Day of  CHRIST's Presenta∣tion  because on it CHRIST was presented in the Temple it is called the  HolyDay  of

than ordinary Observation among Women and is therefore called the  WivesFeastDay  The Feasting seems to be observed  in Honour of the Virgin  Mary  for as on the Day of a Woman's being  church'd

Procession or because also the Use of  lighted Tapers  which was observed all Winter at  Vespers  and  Litanies  were then wont to cease till the next  AllHallowmass  THESE  Lights  so carried about were bles∣sed of the  Priest  as  Hospinian  tells us who made Use of the following Prayers at their Consecration  Rogamus te per invocationem sancti tui nominis per intercessionem  Mariae  beatae virginis matris filii tui c ut consecrare velis has candelas ad utilitatem com∣modum hominis c mox Domine Jesu benedicas ob∣secro hanc creaturam ceream concede illi caelestem malignus spiritus

whose Feast we this Day ce∣lebrate with the highest Devotion and by the Intercession of all thy Saints that thou wouldst sanctifie these  Candles  to the Good and Profit of Men and the Health of his Soul and Body whether in Earth or Sea And again O LORD JESU I beseech thee that thou wouldst bless this thy Creature of  Wax  and grant it thy Heavenly Benediction by the Power of thy Holy Cross that as it was a Gift to Man by which the Darkness might be driven away so now it may be en∣dow'd with such Virtue by the  Sign of the  Holy Cross that wheresoever it is lighted and placed the evil Spirit may tremble and with his Servants be in such Terror and Confusion as to fly away from that Habitation and no more vex and disturb thy Servants  AFTER this he adjures the  Wax Candles  in Words like these  Adjuro te creaturam ceream in nomine Domini no∣stri sanctae Trinitatis ut sis extirpatio depulsio dia∣boli spectrorum ejus c  Hospin ibid  I adjure thee O thou  waxen Creature in the Name of our LORD and the Holy Trinity that thou repel and ex∣tirpate the Devil and his Sprights  c  And therefore all Christians says  Eccius Tom    Hom de Purificat  ought to use these Lights with an holy Love having a sincere Depen∣dance that thus they shall be freed by the Power of the Word and this Prayer from all the Snares and Frauds of the Devil  OUR Author upon this says That this is manifest Blasphemy and Idolatry For as on the one Hand they take the Name of GOD and the Holy Trinity in vain so on the other they attribute to a Wax Candle what should be ascribed to CHRIST alone and the quick∣ning Power of the Holy Ghost  CHAP XX  Of  ValentineDay  its Ceremonies what the Council of  Trullus  thought of such Customs that they had bet∣ter be omitted  I  T is a  Ceremony  never omitted among the Vulgar to draw Lots which they Term  Valen∣tines  on the Eve before  Valentine  a Presbyter of the Church was beheaded un∣der  Claudius  the Emperor  Va∣lentineday  The Names of a select Number of one Sex are by an equal Number of the other put into some Vessel and after that every one draws a Name which for the present is called their  Valentine  and is also look'd upon as a good Omen of their be∣ing Man and Wife afterwards  THERE is a rural Tradition that on this Day every  Nature the Vicare of the Almightie LORD That hote colde hevie light moist and drie hath knit by even nomber of Accord In easie Voice began to speak and say  foules take hede of my Sentence I pray And for your own ease in fordring of your need as fast as I may speak I will me speed  Ye know well how on St Valentine's Day By my Statute and through my governaunce Ye doe chese your makes and after flie away with hem as I pricke you with Pleasaunce  Chaucer  Bird chuses its Mate From this perhaps the youthful Part of the World hath first practised this Custom so common at this Season  In the  Trullan  Council we have Lots and Divinations forbid as being some of those Things which  provoked the LORD to anger  against King    Lib Kings Chap    Manasses  who used Lots and  Divinations  c upon which the  Scholiast  hath these Words  Can    in Syn Trull in Bals P    The Custom of drawing Lots was after this Manner on the rd Day of  June  which is the Eve of St  John Baptist  Men and Woman were accustomed to gather together in the Evening by the Seaside or in some certain Houses and there adorn a Girl who was her Parents firstbegotten Child af∣ter the Manner of a Bride Then they feast∣ed and leaped after the Manner of  Bacchanals  and danced and shouted as they were wont to do on their Holydays After this they poured into a narrow neck'd Vessel some of the SeaWater and put also into it certain Things be∣longing to each of them Then as if the Devil gifted the Girl with the Faculty of telling future Things they would enquire with a loud Voice about the good or evil Fortune that should attend them Upon this the Girl would take out of the Vessel the first Thing that came to Hand and shew it and give it to the Owner who upon receiv∣ing it was so foolish as to imagine himself wiser as to the good or evil Fortune that should attend him  THIS Custom as he tells us a little after is altogether diabolical And surely it was so  being used as a Presage of what was future Was the Custom of the Lots now mention'd used as among the Heathens they would no Doubt be as worthy of Condemnation but as far as I know there is but little Credit given to them tho' that little is too much and ought to be laid aside But if the Cu∣stom was used without any Mixture or Allay of Superstition as I believe it is in some Pla∣ces yet it is often attended with great Incon∣veniences and Misfortunes with Uneasinesses to Families with Scandal and sometimes with Ruin  CHAP XXI  Of  Shrovetide  what it signifies the Custom of the  Papists  at this Season that our present Customs are very un∣becoming  S  HROVETIDE signifieth the Time of  confessing Sins  as the Word  Tide  which signifies  Time  and the  Saxon  Word  Shrive  or  Shrift  which signi∣fies  Confession  plainly shew The Reason why this Time is so denominated is because it was set apart by the Church of  Rome  for a Time of  Shriving  or  confessing Sins  For then Peo∣ple were wont to confess their Sins and re∣ceive  the Sacrament that they might be bet∣ter prepar'd for the Religious Observation of the following Season of  Lent  Thus in the Constitutions of  Simon  of  Sudbury  Archbishop of  Canterbury  was made at  Lambeth  A D    in the second Year of  Ri∣chard  the Second in the first Year of  Urban  the fifth Pope and  Clement  the seventh AntiPope This most eloquent Man who was wise incomparably beyond the rest of the King∣dom sat about six Years and at last was beheaded at  Lon∣don  by Command of the Rebels  Tyler  and  Stravo  A D  Johnson Const  I have seen in a Church at  Sudbury  in  Suffolk  a Skull which is shewn to Strangers for the Skull of this Bishop and probably it is the true one  Simon Sudbury  it is orde∣red  That LayMen should be admonished to confess in the very Beginning of  Lent  And in  Theodolphus  's  Capitula  it is order'd  That on the Week next before  Lent  every Man should go to his Shrift and his Shrift should shrive him in such a Manner as his Deeds which he had done requir'd And that he should charge all that belong to his District that if any of them have Discord with any he make Peace with him if any one will not be brought to this then he shall not shrive him but then he shall inform the Bishop that he may convert  him to what is right if he be willing to belong to GOD Then all Contentions and Disputes shall cease and if there be any one of them that hath taken Offence at another then shall they be reconcil'd that they may more freely say in the LORD'S Prayer  LORD forgive us our Trespasses  c And having thus purified their Minds let them enter upon the  Holy Fast Tide  and cleanse themselves by Satisfaction against  Holy Easter  c  Johnson    Consti∣tut  THIS Custom of confessing to the Priest at this Time was laid aside by our Church at the Reformation For Sins are to be confess'd to GOD alone and not to the Priest except when the Conscience cannot otherwise be quieted Then indeed the Grief is to be open∣ed to the Spiritual Guide in private  Exhort to the Com  That by the Ministry of GOD's Word he may give the Benefit of Absolution together with ghostly Council and Advice to the quieting of the Con∣science  and the avoiding of all Scruple and Doubtfulness  But how this other worse Cu∣stom came to be retain'd of indulging all Manner of Luxury and Intemperance I know nothing but that the Flesh was too powerful for the Spirit The Duties of Religion how justly soever enjoyn'd us are tamely dispensed with but what won't we rather do than give up the Pleasures of Life Surely the Church never design'd when she so justly took away the publick Confessions of this Sea∣son that Rioting and Gaming and Drunken∣ness should continue amongst us Are these a fit Preparation for so solemn a Season Will they qualifie us for the Hearing of the Histo∣ry of our LORD'S Passion Will they pre∣pare us for the Reception of his Body and Blood And fit us to meet him in the Mor∣ning of the Resurrection Will they not ra∣ther speak us  Heathens  than  Christians  And lead us to Hell than on the Way to Hea∣ven Such Customs as these may in some Measure be excusable among them whose  Vid Seldon Table Talk C of Christmass  Church has too much led them into those  Things but it is scandalous and sinful and abominable in those who pretend to be the Enemies of Error and Superstition to con∣tinue the Observation of such sinful Cu∣stoms  CHAP XXII  Of PalmSunday Why so called how observed in the Popish Times What it is truely to carry Palms in our Hands on this Day  T  HE Sunday before  Easter  which is denominated  PalmSunday  is so called  Dicitur enim dominica in ramis palmarum quod illo die rami palmarum in processionibus deportentur in significationem illorum quos filii  Israel  statuerunt in via Christo jam veniente  Belith    P    Cap Durand Lib    P    in Ram  because as the Ri∣tualists say on that Day the Boughs of  PalmTrees  were wont to be carried in Procession in Imitation of those which the Children of  Israel  strawed in the Way of CHRIST  For they cut down Branches from the Trees and strawed them in the Way  which according to the Consent of Antiquity were  the Branches of the  PalmTree  it being very Common in that Country and used as an Emblem of Victory And a  Doctor  of our own Church in his Discourse upon this  Fe∣stival  says  Dr  Spark  's Feasts and Fasts  From the Story as described by St  Luke  and St  Matthew  some of the an∣cient Church took Occasion as on this Day to go in Procession with  Palms  in their Hands and to denominate it  PalmSunday  BUT however harmless this Custom might have been in the Times of its first Institution it is certain that in after Ages it sunk into Super∣stition and gross Idolatry Thus the  Rhemists  in their Translation of the New Testament de∣scribe the Ceremony themselves  These Of∣fices of Honour done to our  Saviour  extra∣ordinarily were very acceptable And for a Memory hereof the Holy Church maketh a solemn Procession every Year upon this Day specially in our Country when it was Catholick with the Blessed Sacrament reverently carryed as it were CHRIST up∣on the  Ass  and strawing of Bushes and  Flowers bearing of Palms setting up Boughs spreading and hanging up the richest Clothes the Quire and Queristers singing as here the Children and the People all done in a very godly Ceremony to the Honour of CHRIST and the Memory of his Triumph upon this Day The like Service and the like Duties done to him in all other solemn Processions of the Blessed Sacrament and otherwise be undoubtedly no less grateful  Dr  Fulk in Loc Mat  Fulke  upon this gives this Answer  Your  PalmSunday  Procession was horrible Idolatry and abusing of the LORDS Insti∣tution who ordained his Supper to be eaten and drunken not to be carryed about in Procession like a Heathenish Idol But it is pretty Sport that you make the Priests that carryeth this Idol to supply the Room of the  Ass  on which CHRIST did ride Thus you turn the Holy Mistery of CHRIST'S riding to  Jerusalem  to a  Maygame  and pa∣gent Play And yet you say such Service done to CHRIST is undoubtedly exceed∣ing grateful yea no less grateful than  that was done by his Disciples at the Time mentioned in the Text Your Argument and Proof is none but your bare Assevera∣tions That which the Disciples did had the Warrant of the Holy Scripture but who hath regarded these Theatrical Pomps at their Hands Or what Word of GOD have you to assure you that he accepteth such Willworship Who detesteth all Wor∣ship which is according to the Doctrines and Traditions of Men and not after his own Commandment  FROM this superstitious and idolatrous Custom without all doubt it comes to pass that we now and then on a  PalmSunday  see the young People carrying  Branches of Palms  in their Hands which they seem fond of ha∣ving that Day and which they as little regard at other Times It is true indeed it is a Re∣lick of the ancient Superstition of the  Papists  but as it is now intirely stript of any Super∣stiton and is an Emblem of the Season and the Transactions of that Day so I see no harm in so innocent an Observation  BUT how much better would it be to car∣ry in our Hands this Day  Ramos debent fideles portare id est bona opera Opera miserecordiae sunt vestire nudos colligere hospi∣tes errantes revocare visitare infirmos c  Bed Tom    P    the  Palm of good Works  the Graces of Humility and Kindness and Charity to feed the Hungry to give drink to the Thirsty to clothe the Naked to entertain the Strangers to visit the Sick and in Prison  c  By such Actions as these should we truly carry  Palms  in our Hands by these we should truly  straw the Way  for our LORD and so follow his Steps to the  Hea∣venly Jerusalem  CHAP XXIII  Of rising early on Easter Day What is meant by the Sun dancing that Morn The Antiquity of rising early on this Day the End and Design of it The great Advantage of it  I  T is a common Custom among the Vulgar and uneducated Part of the World to rise be∣fore the  Sun  on  Easterday  and walk into the Fields The Reason of which is to see the Sun  Dance  which they have been told from an  old Tra∣dition  always Dances as upon that Day We read indeed that the Sun once  Josh x  stood still  but whether the Sun danced upon the very Day  our Saviour rose on we cannot tell It's very probable it did not because the Scriptures are silent and that it never did so since I think we may be well assur'd forasmuch as never any that we have heard of have seen any such Thing since that Time If therefore this Tradition hath any Meaning it must be a  Metaphorical  one that when the Morning proves clear there is a seeming Smile over the Face of Nature and Earth and Heaven shew Tokens of Joy For as the Earth and her Valleys by standing thick with Corn are said  to laugh and sing  so on Account of the Resurrection the Heavens and the Sun may be said to Dance for Joy or as the Psalmist Words it  Psal xcvi Caeliquidem digni laetentur terra au∣tem exultet  Damasc in Dominican Pascha P    The  Heavens may rejoyce and the Earth may be glad  THERE is then really speaking nothing in the Dancing of the Sun upon  EasterDay  but yet it is a very ancient and commendable Custom to be up early at this Holy Time And therefore  Damascen  in his  Paschal Hymn  sings  Vigilemus mane profundo pro unguenti hymnum afferamus Domino Christum videamus justitiae solem omnibus vitam exorientem  Ibid  Let us watch very early in the Morn∣ing and instead of Ointment let us bring an Hymn to our LORD and let us see our CHRIST the  Sun of Righteousness  who is the Life that riseth to all Men And indeed it is the most seasonable Time for meditating on our LORD'S Resurrection and it's pleasing Circumstances For as the Place where any notable Thing has been transacted seldom or never fails to raise the Idea of the Transacti∣on so the particular Time when it was done does generally produce the same Effect And as the Truth of the Former was the Occasion of many holy and religious Men go∣ing  Fulk Test Cont Rhem Matth Cap    in Annot  to visit the Place of the Sepulchre and hear it as it were say what the Angel did to the Women  Come see the Place where the LORD lay  so the Truth of the Latter was the Reason why devout and holy Men did in the best Ages of the Church rise early in the Morning of the Resurrection The Pri∣mitive Christians spent the Night preceeding  it in Prayers and Praises till the Time of  Cockcrow  the supposed Hour of our Saviour's rising For as  Latinorum concors est sententia Christum non me∣dia nocte verum mane in aurora canentibus vice Gallo∣rum angelis devicta morte confractis portis inferi surrexisse  Durant de Rit Lib    Cap    Durant  tells us it is univer∣sally assented to by the Latin Church that after our Saviour had conquer'd Death and broken the Gates of Hell he arose from the Dead not at Midnight but in the Morning at the Time of Cockcrow which not the Cocks but the Angels themselves proclaimed And when these Pernoctations were laid aside it was the Custom to rise early and spend the Morning in such a Manner as was suita¦ble to the Nature of the Time The Saluta∣tion of the  Eastern  Church  Anestese  or  The LORD is risen  and the usual Answer  The LORD is risen indeed  were no doubt the common Salutation of that Morning And if this present Custom of the Vulgar has had at any Time any laudable Custom for its O∣riginal it was no doubt this of rising early to contemplate the more seasonably on the Resurrection of CHRIST  AND now was this the End of Rising ear∣ly at that Holy Time it would be very ad∣vantageous but to rise with the View of the Vulgar is foolish and ridiculous Would we rise before the Sun and prevent the Dawn of Day our Meditations would be strong and vigorous and almost persuade us that the real Actions of that Morn were presented to our View For when at that Time all Things are husht in Silence and warp'd in Darkness or but illuminated with the friendly Moon the  Devotae Christi faminae quae illum vivum dilexe∣rant mortuum desiderabant per noctem ambulantes juvante luna venerunt ad monumentum  Rupert de Divin Officiis Lib    C    Guide of  Mary Magdalene  and the other Women to the  Sepulcher  'tis easy and natural to meditate on these Things to see our Savi∣our's Tomb to see the Angels sit as Guardians on it and the trembling Watch fled into the City  And now the LORD is risen indeed and they that seek him early shall find him  Maria Magdalena  cujus domus erat  Bethaniae  prima ante alias una sabbati juxta joannem valde dilucu∣lo venisset dum adhuc tenebrae essent ad monumentum  Rupert ibid  Be∣hold then  Mary Magdalene on the first Day of  the Week  coming from her own House at  Bethany  before the other Women  very early in the Morning when it was as yet Dark  Abit a loco volens consolationem quandam invenire  Theophlact in Loc  to find Ease and Consolation at the Sepulchre Behold she and the other Women bringing the prepared Spices to Embalm their LORD Behold  Peter  and  John  running to the Sepul∣chre and returning whilst  Mary  continues in Sorrow and Tears And as she weeps ye may see her look into the Sepulchre  but he is not there he is risen  Behold then the Guar∣dians of the Tomb saying  John xx  c  Woman why weepest thou  Nay behold the Lamb of GOD himself with the very same Words  wiping away the Tears from her Eyes And JESUS said unto her Woman why weepest thou Whom seekest thou She supposing him to be the Gar∣diner saith unto him Sir If thou have born him hence tell me where thou hast laid him and I will take him away JESUS said unto her  Mary With what Joy now does she run to his Feet willing and desirous and eager  to Embrace them But he bids her not to touch him  but go to his Brethren and say un∣to them I ascend unto my Father and your Fa∣ther to my GOD and your GOD  Behold a little after this his Apparition to her and the other Women and how he suffers them to kiss his Feet  Taylor's Antiq Christ de Resurrect  He appeared also about the same Time to  Peter  THESE and the other Accidents at our LORD'S Resurrection would afford us a sa∣tisfactory and comfortable Meditation would inflame our Hearts with a burning Love and melt us into Tears of Joy In our eager Wishes and warm Desires we should with the Holy Women kiss the Feet of our Savi∣our and be almost Partakers of equal Hap∣piness with them or sure we are that we should have our Saviour in our Hearts and not fail of seeing him in his Kingdom He whom we have so carefully sought for will vouchsafe to be found of us in his Grace at the Sepulchre and in his Glory in Hea∣ven Happy they who so early seek their  Saviour  who long after him as the Hart doth after the WaterBrooks who seek him among the  Sol Song  ii  Lilies until the Day break and the Shadows flee away Happy they their Conversation is now in Heaven and their Happiness hereafter will be the Joys of Eternity Where they shall no more be absent but ever Present with the LORD  CHAP XXIV  Of Easter HolyDays A Time of Re∣laxation from Labour How observed in the dark Ages of Popery That our Customs at this Time are sprung from theirs  O  N the  HolyDays of Easter  it is customary for Work to cease and Servants to be at Liberty Which is a Resem∣blance of the Practice of the primitive Church which set apart the whole Week after  Easter  for to praise and glorifie GOD for our SAVIOUR'S Resurrection In which  Servos autem ancillas ac omnes qui nostro servi∣tio sunt addicti profecto ab omni servitutis severitate eos hoc tempore laxare debemusUt libere secure omnes possint ad audiendum divinum officium convenire communicare  Belith Cap    Time all servile Labour ceas'd that  Servants as well as others might be present at the Devotions of the Season But other Customs so frequently observed at this Time such as  publick Shows Gamings HorseRaces  c were forbidden as being foreign to the Holiness of this Season  IN after Ages when the Church fell into Corruption and the Substance of Religion de∣cay'd into the  Shadow of Ceremonies  the usual Prayers and Praises of the Season were either much neglected or but superficially observed For  Belithus  a  Ritualist  of those Times tells us  Sunt enim nonnullae ecclesiae in quibus usitatum est ut vel etiam episcopi archiepiscopi in caenobiis cum suis ludant subditis ita ut etiam ad lusum pilae demittant c  Belith C    That it was customary in some Churches for the  Bishops  and  ArchBishops  themselves to play with the inferior  Clergy  even at  HandBall  and this also as  Durandus  witnesseth  In quibusdam locis hac die  Vid Pasch c Durand Lib    Cap    even on  EasterDay  it self This was cal∣led  Atque haec quidem Libertas ideo dicta est  Decem∣brica  c  Belith ibid  the Liberty of  December  because that  formerly it was customary among the Hea∣thens in that Month to indulge their Servants with a certain Time of Liberty when they were on the Level with their Masters and feasted and banqueted with them  WHY they should play at  HandBall  at this Time rather than any other Game I have not been able to find out but I suppose it will be readily granted that this Custom of so playing was the Original of our present Recreations and Diversions on  Easter Holy Days  and in particular of playing at  HandBall for a  Vid Seld Table Talk of Christmass  TanzyCake  which at this Season is gene∣rally practised and I would hope practised with Harmlessness and Innocence For when the common Devotions of the Day are over there is nothing sinful in lawful Recreation But for the Governors of Churches to descend to such Childish Exercises and that even on the  Great Sunday  of the Year was not only unbecoming their Gravity and Reservedness but was also a downright Breach of the fourth  Commandment But these were Ages of Ig∣norance and Darkness when the World was  taught for the Doctrines of GOD the Command∣ments of Men  CHAP XXV  Of  MayDay  the Custom of going to the Woods the Night before this the Practice of other Nations The Origi∣nal of it the Unlawfulness  O  N the  Calends  or the  first Day of  May commonly called  MayDay  the juvenile Part of both Sexes are wont to rise a little after Midnight and walk to some neighbour∣ing Wood accompany'd with Musick and the blowing of Horns where they break down Branches from the Trees and adorn them with  Nosegays  and  Crowns of Flowers  When this is done they return with their Booty homewards about the rising of the Sun and make their Doors and Windows to Triumph in the Flowery Spoil The afterpart of the  Day is chiefly spent in dancing round a TallPoll which is called a  MayPoll  which being placed in a convenient Part of the Village stands there as it were consecrated to the  God∣dess of Flowers  without the least Violation offer'd it in the whole Circle of the Year And this is not the Custom of the  British  Common People only but it is the Custom of the Generality of other Nations particularly of the  Italians  where  Polydore Virgil  tells us The  Est autem consuetudinis ut juventus promiscui sexus Laetaebunda cal  Maii  exeat in agros cantitans inde vi∣rides reportet arborum ramos eosque ante domorum fo∣res ponat praesertim apud  Italos  c  Poly Virg    Youth of both Sexes were accustomed to go into the Fields on the Calends of  May  and bring thence the Branches of Trees sing∣ing all the way as they came and so place them on the Doors of their Houses  Celebrabantur autem hae feriae atque ludi Lactantio teste cum omni lascivia verbis moribus pudendis ad placandam deam quae floribus fructibus praeerat Nam per tubam convocabantur omnis generis meretrices Unde Juvenalis  Digissima prorsus  Florali Matrona Tuba  Ex in theatro denudatae c  Hosp de Orig Eth    THIS is the Relick of an ancient Custom among the Heathen who observed the four  last Days of  April  and the first of  May  in Honour of the Goddess  Flora  who was ima∣gin'd the Deity presiding over the Fruit and Flowers It was observed with all Manner of Obscenity and Lewdness and the undecent Sports and Postures of naked Women who were called together with the Noise of Trum∣pets and danced before the Spectators  FROM this Custom of the Heathens hath ours undoubtedly come and tho' for that Reason barely it need not be laid aside yet forasmuch as many Country People are of O∣pinion  Sic nos tunc eo anni tempore cum virent omnia quasi per hunc modum fructuum ubertatem ominamur ac bene precamur  Polyd Virg    That the Observation of this Cere∣mony is a good Omen and a Procurer of the Success of the Fruits of the Earth which is intirely a Piece of Superstition and because also much Wickedness and Debauchery are committed that Night to the Scandle of whole Families and the Dishonour of Religion there is all the Reason in the World for laying it aside  CHAP XXVI  Of Parochial Perambulations Their An∣tiquity the Benefit and Advantage of them  I  T was a general Custom for∣merly and is still observed in some  Country Parishes  to go round the  Bounds  and  Limits  of the  Parish  on one of the three Days before  Holy Thursday  or the Feast of our  LORD's Ascension  when the Minister accompany'd with his  ChurchWardens  and  Pa∣rishoners  were wont to deprecate the Venge∣ance of GOD beg a Blessing on the Fruits of the Earth and preserve the  Rights  and  Pro∣perties  of their  Parish  THE Original of this Custom is dated from the Times of the Heathens For  Refert  Plutarchus  in Problem  Numam Popilium  cum finitimis agri terminis constituisse in ipsis finibus  Terminum  Deum quasi finium praesidem amicitiaeque ac pacis custodem posuisse Festa ei dicata quae  Terminalia  nuncupantur quorum vice nos quotannis ex vetustissima consuetudine parochiarum terminos lustramus  Spelm Gloss in Verbo Perambulat  from the Days of  Numa Popilius  they worshipped the God  Terminus  whom they looked upon to be the Guardian of  Fields  and  Landmarks  and the Keeper up of Friendship and Peace among Men Upon this Account the Feast called  Ter∣minalia  was dedicated to him instead of which it is a very ancient Custom to surround the Bounds of Parishes every Year And in∣stead of Heathenish Rites and Sacrifices to an imaginary God to offer Praises and Prayers to the true GOD the GOD of the whole Earth The Custom was the People accom∣pany'd the Bishop or some of the Clergy into the  Fields  where  Litanies  were made and the Mercy of GOD implor'd that he would avert the Evils of Plague and Pestilence that he would send them good and seasonable Wea∣ther and give them the Fruits of the Earth in due Season  THE Litanies or Rogations which were  It is called  RogationWeek  because of that Prayer and Fasting that was then used for to supplicate GOD for his Blessing on the Fruits of the Earth It is also in some Pla∣ces called  CrossWeek  because in ancient Times when the Priest went into the Fields the  Cross  was carried before them In the Northern Parts it is called  GangWeek  from to  gang  which in the North signifies to go  then made Use of and gave Name to the Time of  RogationWeek  were first observed by  Ma∣mertus  Bishop of  Vienna  in the Year  Dum civitas Viennensium crebo terrae motu subrue∣retur bestiarum desolaretur incursu sanctus  Mamertus  ejus civitatis episcopus eas legitur pro malis quae prae∣missimus ordinasse  Walifred Stral C    de Reb Ecclesiast  on Account of the frequent Earthquakes that happened and the Incursions of wild Beasts which laid in Ruins and depopulated the City Not that  Litanies  and  Rogations  were not used before but that before this Time they were not affixed to these Days And since that they have been observed of the whole Church at this Season except the Church of  Hispani  autem propter hoc quod scriptum est  non possunt filii sponsi lugere quamdiu cum illis est sponsus  infra quinquagessimam paschae recusantes jejunare litanios suos post pentecosten posuerunt  Walaf Strab ibid  Spain  who chus'd rather to have them after  Pentecost  than before it because  from  Easterday  to the Feast of  Pentecost  it was the Custom of the Church not to Fast For as they themselves reason'd the Children of the  BrideChamber cannot Fast so long as the Bridegroom is with them  and therefore they held their  Rogations  after  Pentecost  WHAT now remains among us is the Re∣lick of this antient and laudable Custom which was always observed in the old Church of  England  and has been also in some Mea∣sure since the Reformation too  In  Concil  Cloveshoviae  sub  Cuthbert  Arch  Cant An    Cap  Ut Litaniae i e Rogationes a clero omnique populo his diebus cum magna reverentia agantur id est septimo kalendarum  Maiarum  juxta ritum  Romanae  eccle∣siae quae litania major apud eam vocatur Et item quo∣que secundum morem priorum nostrorum tertiae dies ante ascentionem domini nostri in caelos cum jejunio c  Spelman Gloss    the Canons of  Cuthbert  Archbishop of  Canterbury  which were made at  Cloveshoo  in the Year it was order'd that  Litanies  that is  Rogations  should be observed of the Clergy and all the People with great Reve∣rence on these Days  viz  the seventh of the Kalends of  May  according to the Rites of  the  Church  of  Rome  who termeth this the  greater Litany  and also according to the Cu∣stom of our Forefathers on the three Days before the Ascention of our LORD into the Heavens with Fasting  c  And in the In∣junctions made in the Reign of Queen  Eliza∣beth  it is ordered  Injunct    Eliz  That the Curate at certain and convenient Places shall admo∣nish the People to give Thanks to GOD in the beholding of GOD'S Benefits for the Increase and Abundance of his Fruits upon the Face of the Earth with the say∣ing of the Psalm  c  at which Time the Minister shall inculcate these or such Sentences  Cursed be he which translateth the Bounds and Doles of his Neighbour  Or such Orders of Prayers as shall be here∣after  AGREEABLE to this we read in the Life of the pious  Hooker  Walt in Vit Hookeri  That he would by no Means omit the Customary Time of Pro∣cession persuading all both Rich and Poor  if they desired the Preservation of Love and their  Parish Rites and Liberties  to ac∣company him in his Perambulation and most did so in which Perambulation he would usually Express more pleasant Dis∣course than at other Times and would then always Drop some loving and facetious Observations to be remembred against the next Year especially by the Boys and young People Still inclining them and all his present Parishioners to meekness and mutu∣al Kindnesses and Love  because Love thinks not Evil but covers a Multitude of Infirmi∣ties  WE may also observe That the particular Office order'd by our Church for  RogationSunday  is exactly suited to the Nature of the Season that the three Days following are ap∣pointed Fasts by our Church and that one of our Church Homilies is composed particular∣ly for the  Parochial Perambulation  All which shews the Custom and Intention of the Church and that the practising of it would be service∣able to the Sons of Men  Would save their  Lives from Destruction and crown them with Mercy and loving Kindness would send them Springs into their Rivers and make them run among the Hills Would bring forth Grass for the Cattle and green Herb for the Service of Men  CHAP XXVII  Of MidsummerEve Of kindling Fires their Original That this Custom for∣merly was superstitious but now may be used with Innocence  O  N the  Eve of St  John Baptist commonly called  MidsumnerEve  it is usual in the most of Country Places and also here and there in  Towns and Cities  for both Old and Young to meet together and be Merry over a large Fire which is made in the open Street Over this they frequently leap and play at various Games such as Run∣ning Wrestling Dancing  c  But this is generally the Exercise of the younger Sort for the old Ones for the most Part sit by as  Spectators and enjoy themselves and their Bottle And thus they spend the Time till Midnight and sometimes till  Cockcrow  BELITHUS  tells us  Consuetum item hac vigilia ardentes deferri faculas quod  Joannes  fuerit ardens lucerna qui domini vias prae∣paraverit  Belith Explicat Div Offic C    P    Durand Cap    Lib    That it was a Custom to carry lighted Torches on  Midsum∣merEve  as an Emblem of St  John Baptist who was a burning and a shining Light  and the Preparer of the Way of CHRIST But if this was the Reason of this Custom formerly as it's probable it was it having been a com∣mon Thing to shadow out Times and Seasons by Emblems yet the Custom still continu'd among us was originally instituted upon an∣other Bottom  AND indeed the  Habent hoc a gentibus antiquitus enim dracones hoc tempore ad libidinem propter calorem excitati volando per aerem frequenter in puteos fontes spermatizabant ex quo c Hoc animadvertentes medici ignes frequen∣ter passim circa fontes fieri quaecunque magnum immundum redderint fumum ibi cremari c Et quia talia hoc tempore maxime fiebant ideo hoc adhuc ab aliquibus observatur  Durand L    C    Belith in eodem Fest  Original of this Custom is  Heathenish  For in ancient Times the Dra∣gons  being incited to Lust through the Heat of the Season did frequently as they flew through the Air Spermatize in the Wells and Fountains By this Means the Water became infected and the Air polluted so that who∣ever drank the Waters was either tormented with a grievious Distemper or lost his Life As soon as the Physicians perceived this they ordered Fires to be made every where about the Wells and Fountains and those Things which occasioned the noisomest Smell to be burnt knowing that thereby the Dragons would be driven away And forasmuch as this Custom was observed about the Time we now celebrate St  John Baptist  's Feast it is therefore still observed among some People And agreeable to this it is that Mr  Cambden  tells us that  Barnwell  a Village near  Cam∣bridge  got its Name from the Children play∣ing about a  Well  on St  John Baptist's Eve  THE Custom of kindling such Fires was severely censur'd by the Church And there∣fore in the  Council of Trulius  this Canon was  made against it  Can    in Synod Trull ex Bals P    That if any Clergyman or Layman observed the Rite of making on Fires on the  NewMoon  which some were wont to observe and according to an old Custom to leap over them in a mad and foolish Man∣ner he should be deposed if the Former if the Latter he should be excommunicated  THE  Scholiast  upon this  Canon  hath these Words The  NewMoon  was always the first Day of the Month and it was Customary a∣mong the  Jews  and  Greeks  to hold then a Feast and pray that they might be lucky du∣ring the Continuance of the Month Of these it was that GOD spake by the Prophet My Soul hateth your  NewMoons  and your Sab∣baths And not only this but they also kindled Fires before their Shops and Houses and leaped over them imagining that all the Evils which had befallen them formerly would be burnt away and that they should be more successful and lucky afterwards Now about the Sitting of this Synod there were some of the Christians who observed this Cu∣stom  upon the same Accounts that the Hea∣thens did which occasioned it's being forbid by the Council and that if a  Clergyman  was Guilty of it he should be deposed if a  Layman  excommunicated He also tells us that on St  John Baptist'sEve  the Vulgar were wont to make on Fires for the whole Night and leap over them and draw Lots and Divine about their good or evil Fortune  BUT whatever Reason the Heathens had for kindling these Fires whether as  Duran∣dus  thinks that the lustful  Dragons  might be driven away or as the  Canon  that their evil Fortune might be burnt it is certain that the Custom was invented and practised by them and because of the Superstion attending the Observation of it was very justly forbidden by the Council And undoubtedly was the Making of such Fires now attended with any such Superstition it would be equally crimi∣nal to observe them But  Rogosquos nos Angli  Bonefires  vocamus in publica laetitia gaudiis adhibemus non obstante isto canone  Mountag P    when they are  only kindled as Tokens of Joy to excite in∣nocent Mirth and Diversion and promote  Peace and good Neighbourhood  they are law∣ful and innocent and deserve no Censure And therefore when on  MidsummerEve  St  Peter'sEve  and at some other Times we make  I suppose they were called Bonefires because that gene∣rally they were made of Bones For as  Belithus  tells us  Adversus haec ergo hujusmodi inventum est remedium ut videlicet rogus ex ossibus construeretur ita fumus hu∣jusmodi animalia fugaret  Belith in Vigil S Joan That to prevent the Infection before mentioned they were wont to make on Fires of Bones that the Smoke might drive away the Dragons  Bonefires  before Shops and Houses there would be no harm in doing so was it not that some continue their Diversion to too late Hours and others are guilty of excessive Drinking  CHAP XXVIII  Of the Feast of Sheepshearing an anci∣ent Custom  T  HE Feast of Sheepsheering is generally a Time of Mirth and Joy and more than or∣dinary Hospitality indeed it is but little observed in these Northern Parts but in the Southern it is pretty common For on the Day they be∣gin to sheer their Sheep they provide a plen∣tiful Dinner for the Sheerers and for their Friends who come to visit them on that Occa∣sion a Table also if the Weather permit is spread in the open Village for the young People and Children  AFTER what Manner soever this Custom reach'd us it is certain it may boast of great Antiquity It is mention'd in the Second Book of  Samuel  as a Feast of great Magnifi∣cence both for Grandeur of Entertainment and Greatness of Company No less a Person than  Absalom  the King's Son was the Master of this Feast and no less Persons were the Guests than the King's Sons the Brethren of  Absalom  nay it was a Feast that might enter∣tain the King himself or surely the King would never have been so importun'd never would have receiv'd the Compliment so kindly For 'tis said  It came to pass after two full Years that  Absalom  had Sheepsheerers in  Baal∣hazor  which is beside  Ephraim  and  Absalom  invited all the King's Sons And  Absalom  came to the King and said Behold now thy Servant hath Sheepsheerers let the King I beseech thee and his Servants go with thy Servant And the King said Nay my Son let us not all go lest we be chargeable unto thee  Of this kind also was the Feast which  Nabal  made for his Sheerers when  David was driven  to straits in the Wilderness and sent his Servants to ask  a Present of him He calls the Day it was held on a  good Day  that is a Day of plenti∣ful Eating and Drinking And therefore  Na∣bal  answer'd the Servants of  David shall I then take my Bread and my Water and my Flesh that I have killed for my Sheerers and give it unto Men whom I know not whence they be  And further it is said in the same Chapter that so grand and magnificent was this Feast  that he had a Feast in his House like the Feast of a King  We find also in the Book of  Genesis  that  Laban  went to sheer his Sheep in which Time  Jacob  made his Escape which  Laban  heard not of till the third Day Of such great Antiquity then is this Custom and tho' its Antiquity is not of such force as to pal∣liate Luxury and Profusness in these Enter∣tainments yet no doubt it will vindicate the Harmlesness of a moderate Feast upon this Occasion  CHAP XXIX  Of  Michaelmass  Guardian Angels the Discourse of Country People at this Time that it seems rather true that we are protected by a Number of An∣gels than by one particular Genius  T  HE Feast of this Season is ce∣lebrated in Commemoration of St  Michael  and all the Orders of Angels It is cal∣led  The Dedication of St Michael  because of a Church being dedicated to him on this Day in Mount  Garganus  AT this Season of the Year it is a general Custom to elect the Governors of  Towns  and  Cities  to promote Peace among Men and  guard them against Harm from their malici∣ous Fellow Creatures Whether this particu∣lar Time of the Year has been chosen for e∣lecting them because then is the Feast of An∣gels the Guardians and Protectors of Men and of their Communities and  Daniel C    Provinces is not so certain It is certainer that when ever it comes it brings into the Minds of the Peo∣ple that old Opinion of  Tutelar Angels  that every Man has his  Guardian Angel  that is one particular Angel who attends him from his Coming in till his Going out of Life who guides him through the Troubles of the World and strives as much as he can to bring him to Heaven  NOW that good Angels attend good Men is without Dispute They guide them in the Mazes of the Wilderness of Life and bring them to their desir'd Homes they surround them in the Seas of Afflictions and lead them to the Shores of Peace and as when the  Is∣raelites  passed through the RedSea  the Cloud became Light to them but Darkness to their Ene∣mies  so in the troublesome Seas of this Life the  Angels  are both the Guides of good Men and their Protectors from Evil from the De∣vil and his Angels And therefore the Psal∣mist says  The Angel of the LORD tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivereth them and that he will give his Angels Charge over good Men  They are also supposed to be that Hedge which GOD placed about  Job  which the Devil so much complains of and sure we are that when the Eyes of  Elisha  's Servant were open'd  he saw the Mountain full of Chariots and Horses of Fire round about  Eli∣sha That therefore good Men are guarded and protected by Angels the Scripture shews very clearly But that every Man has his particular  Genius  seems to be founded more upon Tradition than any Certainty from Scripture Thus the  Egyptians  believed that every Man had three Angels attending him the  Pythagoreans  that every Man had two the  Romans  that there was a good and an evil  Genius  And hence it is that the  Roman  Poet says  Quisque suos patitur manes  every Man hath his evil  Genius  And if we may believe  the Authority of  Plutarch  the evil  Genius  of  Brutus  appeared to him the Night before the Battle of  Philippi  and told him he was his evil Genius and that he would meet him there  BUT there are greater Authorities then these in Vindication of this Opinion  Casalion  ob∣serves it may be proved from Scripture and not only from the Tradition of the  Unicuique Deus custodem apposuit asserimus in∣dubitanter nos ex scripturis illam fidem non gentium nugibus  Cassal    P de Vet Christ Rit  Hea∣thens And of this Opinion was  Justin Mar∣tyr Theodoret  St  Basil  St  Jerome  and St  Austin  THERE are indeed two Places in the new Testament which have a View to this Opini∣on The first is in the th of St  Matthew  the th Verse  Take heed that ye despise not one of these little Ones For I say unto you that their Angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven  Now because this Place takes notice of the Angels of these little Ones some have therefore concluded that  every Man has his good Angel at least that good Men have But now this Conclusion does not certainly follow from these Words For when it is said  their Angels  it does indeed certainly infer that the Angels do protect good Men but not that every Man has his particular Angel And hence therefore as one observes St  Chrisostom  makes use of these Words  Enteuthen delon  c it is manifest that the Saints at least if not all Men have their Angels But he does not hence conclude that every Man has one The other Place is in the  Acts of the Apostles  where it is said that when  Peter  was delivered out of Prison they would not believe the Maid it was he but said  It was his Angel  It must be own'd in∣deed from this that it seems the Opinion of those in the House that every Man had his  Guardian Angel  but this is no Proof of the Things being so It only proves that it was their Opinion but not that this Opinion is true The  Jews  had such a  Tradition  among them and what was here spoken was perhaps only according to that Tradition Besides we read on the contrary that sometimes one and  the same Angel has been sent to different Per∣sons thus  Gabriel  was sent to  Daniel Zacha∣rias  and the blessed Virgin Sometimes the Scripture tells us of many Angels protecting one Man for so was  Elisha  protected and as we wrestle  not only against Flesh and Blood but against all the Powers of Darkness  so we have many Angels to assist and defend us I shall not dare to determine positively against this Opinion which has travelled down through so many Ages which has been held by so many wise and learned Men and which has such Scriptures brought to its Defence this I shall only say that of the two Opinions the Latter seems to be the more probable that it seems more consonant to Scripture that we are attended by a Number of Angels than by a particular  Tutelar Angel  But this I menti∣on not as necessary to be believed For I am perswaded there is no fault in believing either the one or the other as it appears more pro∣bable For whether soever we believe we be∣lieve in the Protection of Angels and that seems to be all which the Scripture requires  CHAP XXX  Of the Country Wake How observed formerly A Custom of the Heathens and regulated by  Gregory  the Great  I  N the Southern Parts of this Nati∣on the most of Country Villages are wont to observe some Sunday in a more particular Manner than the other common Sundays of the Year  viz  the Sunday after the  Day of Dedication  i e the Sunday after the  Day of the Saint  to whom their Church was dedicated Then the Inhabitants deck themselves in their gaudiest Clothes and have open Doors and splendid Entertainments for the Reception and Treating of their Relations and Friends who visit them on that Occasion from each neighbouring Town The Morn∣ing is spent for the most Part at Church tho' not as that Morning was wont to be spent not  with the Commemoration of the  Saint or Mar∣tyr  nor the grateful Remembrance of the  Buil∣der and Endower  The remaining Part of the Day is spent in Eating and Drinking and so is also a Day or two afterwards together with all Sorts of Rural Pastimes and Exercises such as  Dancing on the Green Wrestling Cudgelling  c  AGREEABLE to this we are told that formerly  Die Dominicâ post Encaeniam seu Festum Dedicati∣onis cujusvis villae convenire solet in Aurorâ Magna ho∣minum Iuvenumque multitudo canora voce  Holywakes Holymakes  Exclamando Designare  c Spelm Gloss in Verb Wak  on the Sunday after the  Encaenia  or  Feast of the Dedication  of the Church it was usual for a great Number of the Inhabitants of the Village both Grown and Young to meet together about break of Day and cry  Holywakes Holywakes  and after  Mattens  to go to Feasting and Sporting which they continu'd for two or three Days  IN the  Northren Parts  the Sunday's Feast∣ing is almost lost and they observe only one other Day for the whole which among them is called the  Hopping  I suppose from the dan∣cing  and other Exercises then used The an∣cient Name and which is still common in the Southern Parts is the  Wake  which according to Sir  H Spelman  are  Sunt celebritates Bacchanales sub fructuum tempori∣bus ab occiduiis Borealibus Anglis pagatim Habitae Bacchanales dixi ex nomine Nam Wak Sax est temul∣entia  Spelm ibid  Bacchanal  Feasts ob∣served about Fruit Time and which were in Villages by Turns among the Northern and Western  English  He calls them  Bacchanals  because as he observes the  Saxon  Word  Wak  signifies Drunkenness This Custom our Fore∣fathers did in all Probability borrow from their Fellow Heathens  Haec eadem sunt quae apud Ethnicos Paganalia dice∣bantur  c Spelm ibid  whose  Paganalia  or  Coun∣try Feasts  were of the same Stamp with this of the  Wake  AT the Conversion of the  Saxons  by  Austin the Monk  it was continu'd among the Con∣verts with some Regulations by an Order of  Pope  Gregory  the Great  to  Mellitus  the Abbot who accompany'd  Austin  in his Voyage His Words are these  Ut Die Dedicationis vel Natalitiis Sanctorum Martyr∣  um quorum illic reliquiae ponuntur tabernacula sibi circa easdem Ecclesias quae ex Fanis commutatae sunt de ramis arborum faciant  c Bed Lib Cap    On the Day of Dedication  or the BirthDay of the Holy Martyrs whose Relicks are there placed let the People make to themselves  Booths  of the Boughs of Trees round about those very Churches which had been the Temples of Idols and in a Religious way to observe a Feast that Beasts may no longer be slaughtered by way of Sacrifice to the Devil but for their own Eating and the Glory of GOD and that when they are full and satisfied they may return him Thanks who is the Giver of all good Things  THIS then is the Beginning of our  Country Wakes  but they continu'd not in their original Purity For the Feasting and Sporting got the ascendant of Religion and so this  Feast of De∣dication  degenerated into Drunkenness and Lux∣ury At present there is nothing left but the very Refuse and Dregs of it Religion having not the least Share in it which till these latter Ages always had some Rioting and Feasting are now all that remain a Scandal to the Feast in particular and to Christianity in general  CHAP XXXI  Of the Harvest Supper A Custom of the Heathens taken from the  Jewish  Feast of Tabernacles  W  HEN the Fruits of the Earth are gather'd in and laid in their proper Receptacles it is common in the most of Country Places to provide a plentiful Supper for the  HarvestMen  and the Servants of the Family which is called a  Har∣vestSupper  and in some Places a  MellSupper  a  Churn Supper  c At this the Servant and his Master are alike and every Thing is done with an equal Freedom They sit at the same Table converse freely together and spend the remaining Part of the Night in dancing sing∣ing  c  without any Difference or Distinction  THERE  Antiquitus consuetudo fuit apud  Gentiles  quod hoc mense servi pastores ancillae quadam libertate frueren∣tur Et cum Dominis suis Dominarentur cum eis fa∣cerent festa convivia post Collectas Messes  Durand Rat Lib    Cap    was a Custom among the Hea∣thens much like this at the gathering in of their Harvest when Servants were indulg'd with Liberty and being on the Equality with their Masters for a certain Time  NOW the Original of both these Customs is  Jewish  And therefore  Hospinian  tells us  Et pro collectis frugibus Deo gratiae agebantur Quem morem Ethnici postea abiis mutuati sunt  Hospin de Orig Fest Jud Stukius Antiq Convival  P  That the Heathens copy'd after this Custom of the  Jews  and at the End of their Harvest offer'd up their first Fruits to the Gods For the  Jews  rejoyced and feasted at the getting in of the Harvest  THEOPHYLACT  in talking of this Feast is undoubtedly mistaken when he says  Scenopegia quod Celebrant in Gratiarum Actionem propter convectas Fruges in Mense  Septembri  Tunc e∣nim gratias agebant Deo convectis omnibus fructibus  c Theophylact in    Cap Joan  That the  Feast of Tabernacles  was celebrated that  Thanks might be returned for the getting in of the Fruits of the Earth For GOD himself tells his own People it was instituted  Levit  that their Generations might know that he had made the Children of  Israel  to dwell in Booths  But however it is certainly true that it was a Time of returning Thanks to GOD for the Success of the Harvest a Time of Festivity and Joy and Gladness Thus the Scripture  Deut  Thou shalt observe the Feast of Tabernacles seven Days after thou hast gather'd in thy Corn and thy Wine And thou shalt rejoyce in thy Feast thou and thy Son and thy Daughter and thy ManServant and thy MaidServant and the Levite the Stranger and the Fatherless and the Widow that are within thy Gates  NOW as the Heathens have imitated the  Jews  in this Custom so it is not improbable that we have had it from the  Heathens  there being a very great Likeness between the Cu∣stom now and that of the Heathens formerly  For  Macrobius  tells us That  Patres Familiarum frugibus fructibus jam Coac∣tis passim cum servis vescerentur cum quibus patientiam Laboris ia colendo rure toleraverant  Macrob Saturnal Die p  im Cap    the Masters of Families when they had got in their Harvest were wont to Feast with their Servants who had labour'd with them in Tilling the Ground Which is exactly answerable to the Custom now amongst us But whatever Truth there is in this it is certain this Custom was practi∣sed by the  Saxons  and is at least as Ancient amongst us as their Days For among their Holydays we find a  E  stob  Append P  Week set apart at Har∣vest of which our  HarvestHome  and  MellSupper  in the  North  are the only Remains  FINIS  THE INDEX  A  A
