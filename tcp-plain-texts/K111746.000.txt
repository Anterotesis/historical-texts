Editor's Postscript of the Poems  ERRATUM  P l r "smoak ascending  to  the skies"  THE AUTHOR'S PREFACE  IT is more usual for Poets than for Writers of any other description to apologize for presenting their Works to the Publick It is not easy to determine whether this arises from a suspicion that their Talents are unequal to support the Character they have assumed or whether it proceeds from an idea that as of Poetical Merit all the world  are  or  pretend  to be Judges the utmost appearance of diffidence is necessary to defend the Candidates for the Laurel from the Vengeance of Criticism The Man who publishes a Treatise in Theology or an Essay on Farriery comes  boldly forward and delivers his opinion without apparent apprehensions But such is not the case with the Poet he generally thinks himself obliged to state  "that the following Poems were never intended for the Public Eyethat they were written for the entertainment of a select Circle or how felfish merely to amuse himselfthat either the earnest intreaties of friends or a dread lest their zeal might have tempted them to circulate incorrect copies of his works are his sole motives for appealing to the Tribunal of Public Criticism"  Such is the general Prelude to Poems But the Author of this Volume is much at a loss how he may properly deprecate the Public Vengeance for having aspired to the title of a Poet as he confessedly comes forward neither urged by the intreaties of Friends nor terrified by the threats of Creditors and he certainly entertains no apprehensions that his slender stock of Fame may be injured by the publication of spurious Copies for none such existHe has therefore  nothing to plead in his own excuse but that the Publick having without disgust received his humble attempts in Prose he is encouraged by the Protection he has already experienced to appear once more as an Author hoping that those whom he may fail to please will pardon his having attempted it  To many the Perusal of these Trifles will restore the recollection of times long past They will be remembered with pleasure though mingled with that regret which ever attends the recollection of happy days that are to return no more  In extenuation of any Errors that may occur in these Poems the Author has only to say that they were mostly written from the age of Seventeen when he commenced his Literary Career to Twentyfour that at that time of life the Imagination is more active than the Judgement and that at present he is so reduced by a long and tedious illness as to  be incapable of improving whatever he has written For the last four years of his life those hours that have not been marked with disease have been devoted to studies of a severer nature in order to qualify him for the practice of a profession which a Constitution debilitated by disease obliges him now for ever to relinquish  Had it pleased the allwise Disposer of all events to have spared Mr B's life he hoped to have obtained some appointment in the Diplomatic line for which as well as for the Bar nature and education had excellently qualified him Mr B never had at any moment of his life an idea of going into the Ministryhe saying to his friend about a month before his death  "Nothing  this  world has to offer could ever induce me to go into orders whilst it pleases GOD to spare me my understanding"  Mr B had from early youth been  intreated  to read with deep attention the thirtythird chapter of the Prophet Ezekiel and St Paul's Epistles to Timothy and Titus and Mr B firmly believed that  "ALL Scripture was given by inspiration"    From a mind exhausted by pain and sickness emanations of splendor cannot be expected Had the  Author still possessed that share of health which once constituted his first felicity he might have rendered his performances less deserving of censure but whatever be the result of their publication the writing of them has occupied many an hour that might have been worse employed and he may add that his having a Literary turn of mind has procured him the acquaintance and friendship of many whose superiority of Talents he readily acknowledges and from whose Conversation he has derived at once Pleasure and Instruction Neither has an Attachment to Poetry as is too often the case prevented his pursuing Studies of a different cast From the Works of his Friend Doctor Reid and those of other able Writers in the same line he has derived a pleasure more solid than Poetry can bestow Poetry may charm with the power of Fancy but it is Philosophy alone that can strengthen the mind  As the Author's present state of health renders it probable that this may be his last Address to the Publick he will not lay down his pen without adverting to the Reviews Those Channels of Literary Intelligence are often censured as both partial and severe How far these charges may be just he will not pretend to determine but he wishes those who bring the charge to recollect that Reviewers are men that some degree of partiality is inseparable from humanity and that therefore till we are supplied with Reviews from above they like every other human invention must have their imperfections However in matters of Religion the Reviewers may have improper biasses in matters of Belles Lettres their opinion will in general be found to be impartial and by appeals from their decision little is now to be gained We live in an age when Literary Merit is throughly understood and the Volumes that are now condemned will derive little advantage from the award of Posterity  Having said thus much on the subject of the Reviews he thinks it right to declare that he has not the least personal acquaintance with any of the Gentlemen who compile them Of his connections with the Reviewers in his literary capacity he has no right to complain Where he has merited censure they have inflicted it fairly and they have often cheered him with approbation  Whatever be the result of their Decision with respect to this Work he promises to submit without any appeal With respect to the Trifles that compose this Volume he has only farther to observe that instead of inscribing the whole to one person he has inscribed the separate Poems to different people as slight tokens of his esteem For this mode of Dedication though now he does not think himself bound to offer any apology possibly his plan may recall to the memory of his Readers the fable of the Hare and many Friends and should the Author fail of  success in his present attempt he like the Hare may experience the inutility of Friendship But whatever be the success of his Volume he will still have the satisfaction to reflect that he has never written a line which  "dying he might wish to blot"  SONNET ON THE DEATH OF GEORGE MONCK BERKELEY ESQ GRANDSON OF THE ILLUSTRIOUS BISHOP BERKELEY SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN IN CHELTENHAM CHURCH  BY THE REV CHARLES DUNSTER MA OF NEWGROVE SUSSEX  "THANK HEAV'N I KNEW THEE NOT"  o'er the sad bier  Of Russell torn by Death's resistless doom  From each gay flatt'ring hope of manhood's bloom  See Mr Anstey's beautiful lines on the Memory of the Marquis of Tavistock father to the present Duke of Bedford  So  sang the Bardbut  how  restrain the tear  Which flows impell'd by sympathy sincere  While 'mid these hallow'd walls at evenings gloom  I pay my votive strain at BERKELEY's tomb  A Youth to Genius Science Virtue dear  For by thy skill in learning's varied lore  By thy sweet lyre attun'd with ev'ry grace  Blest Shade I knew thee wellbut ah  still more  I knew thee in the  virtues  of thy race  And while their agonizing grief I see  Deeply I mourn with THEM who weep for THEE  IMPROMPTU  ON HEARING ACCIDENTALLY OF MR MONCK BERKELEY'S CHARACTERISTIC SYMPATHY WITH WRETCHEDNESSAND WHICH WAS SINGULARLY EXEMPLIFIED DURING A RESIDENCE OF THE LAST SUMMER AT HASTINGS IN THE KINDEST ATTENTION TO MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED EMIGRANT FRENCH CLERGY  Mr Monck Berkeley was their  sole  Interpreter  For although there were several persons at Hastings that could speak something that was NOT English yet these poor people used to say  "No body  comprendres  us but Mons  Berquelly  "  as the French always speak and write that to them hard name A ridiculous anecdote might be related of the name being  properly  written once when Mr Berkeley's Mother was in France many years ago  assisted them as did his truly respectable unwearied friend the very worthy Henry Grimston Esq most liberally with his purseand in every other possible waydying as he then wasThey were most gratefully sensible of his truly amiable unwearied attention to them    BY MR DUNSTER  AH me those tears he dried again shall flow  Those hearts he eas'd again shall burst with woe  The Poor for him heartrending sighs shall heave  And Gallia's Rev'rend Exiles doubly grieve  CD  CHARACTER OF MR MONCK BERKELEY  WRITTEN BY ONE OF THE MOST ACCOMPLISHED GENTLEMEN OF THE PRESENT TIME  MY first knowledge of Mr Berkeley was at Oxford He was then a Gentleman Commoner of Magdalen Hall in that University and though many very respectable names were at the same time on the list of its members yet Mr Berkeley was so preeminently noble in his manners so faithful in his friendships and so benevolent to his associates that perhaps not one of the society envied his high reputation as a man or thought themseves lessened by the acknowledged superiority of his talents as a scholar His delight was in searching out merit and well knowing that it fled from the glare of day and should be sought after in the shade of retirement he there looked for that humble but valuable plant and having found it transplanted it instantly into the richest soil he had access to The soul of the great Bishop Berkeley seemed in every thing to have  animated the body of his Grandson and like him to have equally deserved the just tribute of praise recorded by the sweet Poet of his day  "To Berkeley every virtue under Heaven"  Genius marked him in his earliest years for a child of her own adoption and had not Providence for some good purpose hidden from our eyes recalled his spirit from the abodes of men when it was verging upon the years where youth ends and manhood begins he would not have needed the impartial pen to have told the admiring world that he possessed every power  "Whether by various rules of art  "To touch the soul or warm the heart  "To please the eye delight the mind  "With objects simple pure refin'd  "To sound sublime the epic strain  "Like Falccus charm or with the rage  "Of Juvenal chastise the age  "Sweet as the prophet's vision to unfold  "What sainted breasts have felt but never told  "What Bards to us with sparing hand have given  "Of lib'ral gifts bestow'd on them by Heaven"  WEBB  Through a long and oppressive illness he supported with unabated vigour the soul of the Christian the ties of friendship and the benevolence of the man Pious without oftentation gay without licentiousness a poet without envy a man without guile Such was George Monck Berkeley Esq now happier far in the region of his kindred spirits than all the vain pursuits of this earthly globe could bestow upon him  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE ALEXANDER LORD LOUGHBOROUGH LORD HIGH CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND  MY LORD  PERMIT me to offer to your Lordship the following hasty sketch of the alas  short  life of a most accomplished young Man honoured by your Lordship's throughly amiable attention when introduced to your Lordship by letter only from an old acquaintance of whom perhaps  "you had not heard even the name for near a quarter of a century"  It requires an abler pen than that of a poor infirm Female to do justice to your Lordship's highly polite friendly attentions to that lovely young Man and to his and his happy Mother's gratitude  for  those  attentions  By those who have known her best through life GRATITUDE has been said to be the distinguishing the strongest feature in her character and she is tempted to believe it for the death  of her angelichearted Son certainly blasted every  other  passion of her mind But gratitude perhaps indigenous if any good in our fallen nature may be said to be so still blossoms in her heart No affliction has eradicated has blasted or frozen it Whilst it continues sensible to any sublunary objects it will reflect with pleasure with delight often with extacy on the goodness of your Lordship and your incomparable compeer the excellent Earl of Leven to the descendant of those two great and good Men Bishop Berkeley and Francis Cherry Esquire and the happiness thereby conferred on her who has the honour to be with the sincerest gratitude  My LORD  Your Lordship's very highly obliged and very faithful humble Servant ELIZA

UNDERSTANDING AND SHOWED IT BY HER ATTENTION TO THE INCOMPARABLE WRITINGS OF BISHOP HALL  GEORGEMONCK BERKELEY Esquire LLB and FSSA was the eldest and during the last eighteen years of his life the only child of the Reverend GEORGE BERKELEY LLD Prebendary of Canterbury son of George Lord Bishop of Cloyne by Anne eldest daughter of the Right Honourable John Forster Speaker of the House of Commons in Ireland and Eliza eldest daughter of the Reverend Henry Frinsham MA by Eliza youngest daughter and coheiress of Francis Cherry Esquire of Shottesbrook House in the county of Berks  A friend of Mr Berkeley used to tell him that he was as remarkably descended by his Mother as he was nobly by his Father Two of Mrs Berkeley's paternal grandsires were killed in one day at the Isle of Rhée Sir John Heidon and Sir George Blundell Baronets and the son of the former was highly favoured by Providence to  escape  an untimely death by the wretched Lord Bruce's objecting to  his  being second in that tremendous duel fought between him and Sir Edward Sackville ancestor to the present worthy Duke of Dorset Some years ago when Mr Berkeley visited France and got a letter of introduction to his Grace then Ambassador at Paris containing a very urgent request that Mr Berkeley might have particular attention his Father laughing said  "You may plead your grandsire's  merits  in crossing the ocean to prevent his Grace's grandsire's being  butchered  by that  wretch  Lord Bruce"  All who have read that tragical tale related by Mr Addison in "The Guardian" and in the second volume of Collin's Peerage p must rejoice that poor Lord Bruce died possessed of a very different spirit from that which influenced him in life that he like the thief on the cross was called into the vineyard at the eleventh hour and a half or rather  three quarters  just before the  final  close of the day of MERCY and GRACE for his soul passed into the region of spirits within the hour    Mr Berkeley was born at Bray in the county of Berks on Tuesday February at half past two in the morning  It is frequently said by Biographers that nothing remarkable occurred during childhood Of Mr Berkeley this cannot be asserted for throughout childhood youth manhood and till within a  very  few months of his death the hairbreadth escapes of losing life were almost innumerable an allgracious Providence constantly interposing sometimes very remarkably to rescue him from death until he was enabled by free Sovereign Grace through Redeeming Mercy to meet that King of Terrors with joy for he died triumphing in Christ  A little before the birth of Mr Berkeley Dr Cadogan's "Essay on the Nursing of Children" made its appearance when the depositing children in cradles was exploded accordingly a large easy chair during the day was appropriated to his use When he was about six weeks old a person going into the nursery in the dusk before the servant had lighted candles sat down on this chair but providentially did not sit quite to the back it being very deep She soon  felt something move the infant finding itself incommoded began to struggle with its arms and legs Mr Berkeley from his birth shewed the very uncommon strength of limbs which as he grew up increased and he was esteemed the strongest man in England by those who were judges Some of his intimate friends have owed their lives in a tumultuous crowd to the strength of his arm joined to his true resolute cool courage where he did not wish to have recourse to his sword Mr Berkeley's strength was muscular as his bones were remarkably small his wrist some time before his death measuring little more than six inches  When he was about three months old his mother was attacked by so desperate an ague that it was supposed another fit must have proved fatal to her yet so unwilling was she that her darling her idol alas from his cradle to his coffin should be indebted for his early nourishment to any but herself that she resolved to attempt the bringing him up by hand but he had very nearly lost his life in the attempt before a nurse could be procured  At a very early period of his life he began to shew signs of that uncommon brilliancy of parts quickness of wit and soundness of judgement which so remarkably distinguished him through life even to its latest period To relate witticisms of a child to any but a fond parent would be ridiculous  one or two instances it is hoped may however be pardoned When about three years old he was searching the house for his mother whom from his earliest infancy he passionately loved Unable to find her he walked from room to room calling her A lady who was staying in the family said  "My dear child what a bleating thou dost make"  He instantly turned round and said  "To be sure I do for I am  bleating for my Dam  "  When he was little more than three years and a half old he was diverting himself in the garden A beggar came to the gate and seeing the hall doors and windows all open and no one in sight said  "My pretty little Master what are you doing here alone"  He replied  "I am watering some flowers for the gardener"  The old fox said  "I think I must come in and help you"  on which Mr Berkeley flew to the gate and bolted it saying  "No I thank you I can do it very well by myself"  On his maid's asking him why he bolted the gate he replied  "Why if he had got into the house now that the men are out with the coach perhaps the maids and I could not have got him out again"  Generosity and compassion are indeed very rarely found until instilled into the breasts of very young children in Mr Berkeley they were certainly indigenous When a child in arms if he was asked to give a piece of cake out of his hand he would instantly break off threefourths of it  reserving only a very small piece for himself and be unhappy if the petitioner did not take and eat it On receiving his orange after dinner when it was peeled he would retire to the window ahd carefully separate the quills then go out into the servants' hall and force one upon every servant eight in number One evening his mother observing that he kept his left hand closed enquired whether he had hurt it the servant replied that he had not but that he had kept since dinner full four hours a quill of his orange to give to the coachman who had been sent to Windsor on a message and that no promises of care could prevail on Master Berkeley to entrust her with it adding that he assured her  "it would  comfort  him after his ride"  Mr Berkeley had been told as all children should be that the poor had a right to a share of all his money accordingly the first bright sixpence of which he was master he procured a hammer and attempted to break it On his servant's asking him what he was about he replied  "Why Mamma says the poor must have their share of it so I am going to break it for them"  This attended him to his latest hour for the distressed ever shared largely indeed in every guinea he possessed  Mr Berkeley's understanding was such as often when a child to occasion his Mother to say she hoped he would  not in other instances resemble the famous Marquis de Bedmar of whom in his Memoires it is said he had the power of appearing to be entirely taken up with bagatelles when he was listening to every thing that was saying by various persons and when he was plotting the destruction of Venice  Mr Berkeley when only five years old would stand at the window seat and hum a tune and three weeks afterwards would relate two different conversations carried on at the same time and not only relate them verbatim but take off exactly the action and tone of voice of every speaker Of this dangerous however diverting amusement Mr Berkeley was early broke by his Mother  The first eight years and a half of his life Mr Berkeley had no other instructor than his Mother and such was the extreme volatility of his genius the wonderful  strength  of his understanding and the  natural  wilfulness of his temper that the difficulty of teaching him to read was an Herculean labour so much as often to occasion him to say when grown up that  "he was  resolved  not to learn to read that he did verily believe his Mother was the only  human  being who could have accomplished it until he was old enough to feel the necessity of it  A brother of the late Sir Thomas Stapleton of Gray's Court persisted in a like resolution saying it was nonsense to learn until he at thirteen was sent to sea on board a ship commanded by Sir John Norris who on learning the young gentleman's sentiments assured him that he should be flogged every day until he could read The Chaplain was appointed his Tutor He was after this declaration a very apt scholar This acute worthy young gentleman died at the age of twentytwo It is sometimes a misfortune to children to be too clever  "  adding  "I think my dear Mother seemed to have been sent into this world on purpose to  teach  and  govern  me as I attended to nor cared for any one but herself finding that  she  alone had that  invincible  perseverance requisite to govern me"  Before he attained his sixth year he read incomparably and his comments on what he read and what he saw often occasioned the late George Lord Lyttelton when staying at his father's on a visit to declare  "he had the  strongest  as well as the  most brilliant  powers of mind he had ever seen"  often exclaiming as did the late learned Dr Sumner of Harrow School and many other great men  "What a  man  this  very extraordinary child  must become"  and Mr Berkeley more than answered the expectations of his childhood as all the learned and great men who had share in his education bore testimony His beloved and respected tutor at Eton the Reverend Dr Norbury too well known in the learned world to need any eulogium from a feeble pen used to say that there were wonderful traits of originality in all Mr Berkeley's exercises On this being mentioned one day by a friend to his Father Mr  Berkeley then a young man said  "Ah my  dear Tutor  as to the time of his death he ever termed Dr Norbury I do pity him He used to storm and say 'I have thirty  dolts  that  cannot  do any thing and I have three or four with that idle varlet Berkeley at their head that  can do every thing  and that  will  do nothing"  And when Dr Berkeley used to complain of his son's idleness to Dr Norbury his reply was  "Sir if your son would apply at  all  he must carry the world before him but I must tell you fairly such is his genius that I do not believe that  man lives  who can make him apply regularly until he comes  himself  to see the necessity of it"  The very learned Dr Hill professor of Greek at the university of St Andrew's now Dean of the Chapel Royal at Edinburgh where Mr Berkeley  did  apply used to say that he would engage to select Mr Berkeley's exercise from amongst a thousand without any other mark than what the French term  "  le marque  d'ouvrier"  Mr Berkeley although he could not be called a  man  of business might with propriety be termed a  creature  of business from seven years old for he always felt himself as he thought equal to transact any thing that he offered his services to perform The following little incident may serve to illustrate this before he was seven years old his Mother being alarmed lest one of his front teeth should grow uneven from the old one not being removed  had sent him to town to Hemmet who very honestly said  "All would be right if let alone"  and he proved that his judgement was as great as his honesty for when Mr Berkeley grew up and sometimes went to him for his tooth powder he often said that Mr Berkeley had the finest and strongest set of teeth he ever saw in any head He returned home with a gentleman who was coming on a visit to his Father's A lady of very large fortune happened to be in the machine going on a visit to a friend at Taplow Finding that he lived in the neighbourhood she asked him how far it was from Maidenhead Bridge to Taplow He replied that it was about ten minutes drive She said she must walk as her friends not knowing the day of her arrival could not send their carriage He replied that she certainly should not do that for that his Father's coach would be sent to convey the gentleman and himself and that he would certainly have the pleasure of taking her up the hill to her friend's house The instant he got out of the machine he enquired of Mr March if his Father's coach was come and had the mortification to hear that the coachman had called to say that the carriage was gone on to carry some gentlemen over Maidenhead Thicket and would call for him in an hour Mr Berkeley not then seven years old said  "Madam it is very  improper that a lady  should walk on the high road  alone  so  I  will have the honour of walking up with you I can borrow a  stick  of Mr March"  This  protection  was as will naturally be  supposed politely declined and the lady ordered a chaise As soon as she alighted her first question was  "Do you know Dr Berkeley of Cookham"  "Yes intimately"  "Do you know his little boy If you do not you do not know I very believe the most sensible little creature in the world and the politest"  adding  "there was a tall young man of I suppose near thirty with him but the dear child has twenty times his sense and forty times his politeness"  The gentleman was a learned man who laughed at that pleasing accomplishment politeness he was  then  what  fine  men are  now  Mr Berkeley was almost idolized by the family to whom the lady was going so it appeared not so wonderful to them  In the May after he had completed his eighth year Dr Berkeley went to reside at his prebendal house in the Oaks at Canterbury where he was immediately sent to the King's school under the care of those two eminent masters the learned accomplished elegant Dr Beauvoir and the reverend learned and worthy Mr Tucker In August a gentleman's family going to France to place a son at St Quintin to learn the language his Mother suggested to his Father the advantage of sending Mr Berkeley who although she had taught him to read French well yet found it impossible with an house full of English servants to make him speak it and as it never was the consideration of a moment with his parents whether any thing concerning  their children's education was to cost one guinea or one hundred immediately determined to send him Young as he was he was the only one of the party who knew any thing of French and the sensible amiable lady whose son was going to learn the French language at her return declared that they should have been half starved at the inns and hotels had not Mr Berkeley been with them saying  "That lovely little creature seemed quite inspired for he began in French telling the waiters it was a shame to let English ladies and gentlemen sit there without their tea and chocolate"  He used to run to the bar and drive them in before him with whatever was wanted In his own language it may with strictest truth be asserted that even at that early period of life he was a great proficient for there is not a word in the English language which at the age of seven years he could not spell without book and of most of the difficult words he perfectly understood their sense and used them with the strictest propriety which occasioned the sensible Sir J Temple brother of the abovenamed amiable lady who accompanied her to France repeatedly to say  "I never saw so sensible a creature Here is my nephew  The very amiable D  L  Esquire of Hampshire  just double his age who has been under private tuition for five years is no more capable of expressing himself in the elegant language  This had been by him easily acquired his Mother having from the age of three years every morning after he had spelt his lesson regularly explained to him the meaning of two words of five six or seven syllables This easy task to both mistress and scholar produced a laughable circumstance One day when Mr Berkeley was about three years and a half old after dinner he being at play in the window a gentleman who had dined at Dr Berkeley's speaking of the unfortunate Captain B  said  "Ah poor man it is pity his father and mother did not take it into their heads to marry before he was born it makes the difference of l a year to him"  Mr Berkeley turned round and said  "Poor man I pity him exceedingly It is a  very  great misfortune to be illegitimate"  The gentleman turning to him said  "You little animal how could you become acquainted with a word almost as long as yourself"  No one supposed him attending to the conversation but from the time he was capable of speaking although deeply engaged at play he would frequently a week after relate  verbatim  even long conversations with every gesture and the tone of voice of every speaker In mimickry he was an adept but was early taught by his Mother the danger of indulging it and very rarely indeed practised it never but when earnestly requested by some very intimate friend and in very select company  of  this little creature than I am of scaling the skies"  adding  "I shall watch him through life and bid adieu to all  my  sagacity if he does not become one of the greatest men of the age"  Mr Berkeley remained somewhat less than a year in France boarding in the house of a truly respectable Roman catholic  negociant  of the name of Montjole under the kind inspection of the truly amiable Protestant family of Fitzou The unfeigned affection he ever retained for the French friends of his early youth appeared when at the age of seventeen he published his  "Maria or the Generous Rustic"  by his selecting the names of his actors in that beautiful little volume from the families with whom he lived and those by whom he was caressed  and delighted indeed almost idolized for he had ever most engaging attracting manners His heroine took her name from the servant of Monsieur and Madame Montjole who loved him so tenderly that when he was to quit St Quintin at the age of between nine and ten she was obliged to be sent by her mistress for two or three days to visit her parents while  le petit général Angloise  as he was universally called at that place from his collecting a number of boys a little older than himself and exercising them every evening and marching them with a drum and other martial music about the town after which he used frequently to entertain them with fruit cakes c His  séjour  in France fully answered as perhaps very few Englishmen were ever more throughly masters of the French language speaking and writing it as correctly as he did his mother tongue On being thanked by a gentleman who had requested him to take up his pen for his elegant translation of "Nina" inscribed to the Honourable Mr Hobart he replied  "Sir the favour was very trifling for excepting the sonnet it employed me only just six hours"  When a child at the King's School at Canterbury his mother used to rise at six o'clock in summer to walk with him out of the city for country air One morning about seven o'clock passing by the city wall a woman with a child sat begging As Mrs Berkeley never gave to trampers she told the woman she could not relieve her Mr  Berkeley then little more than eight years old unobserved stayed behind talking to her When he joined his Mother she began reproving him by saying  "It is very wrong to talk to such persons without one means to relieve them and that she was persuaded his yesterday's allowance was all gone"  to which he replied in his sweetly melodious voice  "Why the poor woman said she had not ate a  morsel today  the church clock struck  seven  as he was speaking and I told her I had no money but asked her if some gingerbread nuts that I bought last night would be any comfort to her and her  poor little child  and she said yes so I stayed that I might get them  all  out of my pocket for her"  His mother's eyes filled with tears of gratitude to God for having blessed her child with  such  an heart and she has frequently declared that had she been offered fifty thousand pounds not to have heard that early ebullition of that through life lovely heart she would have rejected it The same sweet spirit attended him amidst all his torturing illness Not many days before his death a poor family in distress being named he turned on the sofa on which he was lying and not finding in his pocket what he thought sufficient to send them eagerly desired his servant might be called to take his keys to get him some more money to send to them and when his mother assured him that they had been already relieved by his father and aunt he replied  "that a  little  more would comfort them"  When Mr Berkeley was between ten and eleven years old a melancholy affair happened at Canterbury One of those unfortunate orphans who are said to be  happy  in having CAREFUL guardians had in the summer vacation stepped over from London to Paris had there spent more than his scanty allowance had repeatedly applied to his  careful  guardians one I think his maternal uncle for a little of his  own  money His humble suit was rejected He however reached Dover without a guinea he again applied but in vain Utterly unable to reach London this unfortunate youth not yet nineteen sallied forth on the high road between Dover and Canterbury He unfortunately met with an  amiable  farmer and his  compassionate carasposa  in what is called an hurdygurdy From the former he took a silverpewter watch with a greasy leather chain and a fox's head set in brass from the other about seventeen shillings This worthy pair drove with all speed to raise an hue and cry after their  foot  highwayman The poor youth returned to the alehouse whence he sallied out borrowed a petticoat of the maid servant got a cork blacked his face and escaped into a wood where he was taken and in this wretched disguise brought to Canterbury The news of so extraordinary a figure was soon spread the children belonging to the King's School went beyond their bounds to see him Mr Berkeley soon returned and told his Mother the lamentable tale She of course moralized on the subject Soon a violent noise was heard Mr  Berkeley started to the window then sitting down exclaimed  "Good God how can our boys be such brutes"  and looked as pale as death His Mother who is shortsighted asked him what it was He replied  "The justices are sitting and this poor creature is going to be examined and our boys are hallooing after him as if he were a mad dog"  It being one of those days on which the school hours permit the gentlemen's sons who board at home to dine with their families Mrs Berkeley observed that her son did not eat at all but leaned back in his chair She enquired if he was ill he replied  "No"  "What ails you then that you do not eat Eat your dinner I desire you"  He replied  "  I cannot eat a morsel  for thinking of this poor creature just gone to St Dunstan's gaol  At his examination several questions were asked him the answering of which tended to his crimination Dr Berkeley who although in the commission for Kent Berks and Middlesex never acted called out aloud  "Young man do not answer any question that is asked you Thank God the laws of England do not oblige any man to accuse himself"  The youth took his advice The farmer and his odious dame swore so  readily  and so  positively  through every thing that he was committed and took his trial at Maidstone and was transported for three years He lived however to return and enjoy a good fortune and no doubt thank his careful guardians  "  He accordingly went without his dinner The next day when he came in from school at twelve o'clock he repaired as usual to his Mother's dressingroom He gently approached his Mother and began as follows  "My dear Mamma I am sure I should  be very sorry to ask  you  to do  any thing improper  for a lady to do but could there be any impropriety in your ordering John  The very worthy Mr Wrightson now master of the workhouse at Canterbury who lived with Dr Berkeley near thirty years and married from his service was in the house when Mr Berkeley was born He ever took the most tender judicious and respectful care of him in infancy and youth A very ludicrous little anecdote might be repeated of Mr Wrightson's bargaining with a bargeman to buy Mr Berkeley then six years old which entirely cured Mr Berkeley of a  most dangerous  trick of which had Mr Wrightson told his Mother the little man would have received a heavy chastisement indeed  to carry that  poor  young man a few bottles of wine to the gaol for my heart bleeds for him and  I  have not money enough to buy him wine"  His Mother told him she would mention it at dinner to his Father who she was very certain would give orders concerning it Perhaps the poor young man owed the preservation of his life to Dr Berkeley's philanthropy  At the age of twelve he lost his only brother near four years younger than himself of whom he was most passionately fond and whose death he ever lamented till he was going to rejoin him in the realms of bliss As children this was remarkable The exquisite beauty of his brother attracted the eyes of all beholders drew persons to their doors and windows to look at him which so entirely void of envy was Mr Berkeley through life that he used to come home in extacies telling his mother how every body  admired his  brother's  beauty When he was about six years old a lady meeting him one day who admired him much asked him if his little brother was like him He instantly replied  "O dear Madam not at all he is a vast deal handsomer than I am every body wonders at his beauty that meets him in the street"  When one was about eight the other rather more than four years old the celebrated George Lord Lyttelton staying some time on a visit at Dr Berkeley's said to a gentleman  "that he did really think that mind and person they were the very finest children he had ever seen during the course of his life"  The death of Mr Berkeley's younger brother caused by a dreadful fever which raged at that time in Canterbury occasioned his being removed to Eton school some months sooner than was intended by his Father but his Mother trembling for her darling the moment the physician pronounced his brother's fever infectious begged he might be sent away immediately which he was within the hour under the care of a faithful tender servant who lived at his Father's family at the time of his birth and until within about four years of Mr Berkeley's death when he married For this worthy man Mr Berkeley ever retained the most grateful regard and affection as did his Parents for his constant unwearied attention paid by him to the health the manners the morals of their evertobelamented son To this worthy person's care was he constantly confided from  the time that he began to run alone until after he quitted Eton school and had a servant of his own Mr Berkeley used frequently to say  "It is not easy to express the gratitude I feel towards John for his wonderfully judicious method of managing such a refractory chap as I was especially when I was from home and he had not my Mother to call in to his aid"  Mr Berkeley with perhaps as amiable as lovely a nature as ever God bestowed on any fallen child of Adam had a very high spirit and a very uncommonly wilful temper Mr Wrightson by civility gentleness and ridicule as a child and youth could prevail on Mr Berkeley to give up any project to do any thing Mr Berkeley had a very affectionate regard for him and when visiting at his Father's from Oxford or the Temple if it were but from Saturday to Monday he used constantly to say  "I must go and sit half an hour with my old friend John in his pantry and talk over old times or he will think me unkind"  adding  "I am sure I owe it to him for the  judicious  care he took of me in childhood and youth"  Mr Berkeley's behaviour to servants as servants was from early youth very remarkably kind and he never had any servant who would not have risqued almost every thing to serve and oblige him excepting one Italian whom he took for a few weeks after an old servant of his married This  execrable villain threatened to murder him for having ordered him to go a journey on the top of a stagecoach Mr Berkeley having a friend in the postchaise with him Such are foreign servants more frequently than is imagined by the  wise  persons who confide in them in preference to their own countrymen who are seldom tempted to rob or murder a master having no foreign tongue to secure them a  safe  retreat on the Continent  Mr Berkeley's tutor at Eton was as mentioned above the learned and respectable Dr Norbury under whose tuition he had been placed by his Father at the  earnest  request of his Mother who knew his merits as a tutor having resided at Windsor four years before her marriage and conceived him particularly calculated to direct  such  a spirit as her darling son The event proved that she was not mistaken for volatile and idle as Mr Berkeley was it is certain Dr Norbury contrived to make him apply more than ever any one before had done excepting his Mother who often regretted that finding what cast of genius her eldest son had she had not set about learning Latin and Greek that she might have  made  him apply more closely in his youth As a proof of Mrs Berkeley's inflexible steadiness in teaching her son and correcting his perverseness of temper she once made him say the word "Nicodemus"  thirty  times when he was about five years old which he either could not or would not pronounce properly  When grown up he used to say  "Oh my dear Mother it was  would not  for it was one of my numerous trials of skill with you"  adding  "but you were  very wise  to do it or God knows what must have become of me"  Dr Berkeley's grand object was to see his son as great a scholar as his father Bishop Berkeley Never having been at any school himself but coming immediately from the palace of Cloyne to Christ Church in Oxford he had conceived that Eton collegers if they had talents must necessarily be excellent scholars and after his son had been a considerable time at Eton boarding at the house of the worthy Mrs Tyrrell and her truly amiable niece Mrs Brookland whom Mr Berkeley through his life termed  "that angelictempered woman"  he dutifully submitted to go into the long chamber to the extreme affliction of his Mother who conjured his Father with many tears not to remove him but he consulted and followed the advice of the then provost of Eton Dr Barnard although he had by his accomplished worthy friend the late Dr Sumner of Harrow been cautioned against his wiles in these remarkable words  "Never trust that man he has a  black  heart I had myself been head master of Eton my friends in power having secured it for me but on my asking if Dr Barnard was to be provost and being answered in the affirmative I for that  sole  reason begged  to decline it"  The subsequent conduct of Dr Barnard fully justified the truth of the character Dr Sumner had given of him Could any man but Dr Barnard have treated the first school in England over which he had so long presided and which he had upon the whole  Upon the  whole  so well for certainly in some instances he was tyrannical even cruel which the following wellknown fact must prove to all impartial persons The late General Brudenell deputy governor of Windsor Castle being with his regiment in Germany one day as his lady was sitting at dinner her son from Eton came in She naturally enquired what could bring him up at that hour on a whole school day The youth aged between thirteen and fourteen replied  "Why I am expelled"  Mrs Brudenell the knife and fork dropping from her hand exclaimed  "Good God child what have you done Have you killed a boy"  "No I have done nothing but called my dame's upper maid a thief"  "That is impossible child you must have done something worse than that or I am sure Dr Barnard would not have expelled you"  The boy related the whole transaction which appeared to her so utterly incredible that she instantly sent a servant to request a gentleman of large fortune her near neighbour to call on her immediately when the youth related to him the following facts as they proved to be  "That having lost his Dictionary he borrowed one for two or three days of some boys but finding that inconvenient he and two of his friends went to the secondhand bookseller's in Eton to try to buy one A Dictionary was immediately produced when one of his friends said 'It is exactly like your own' The other said 'I verily believe it is your own' Young Brudenell asked of whom he bought it The man without hesitation said 'Of dame  's upper maid She told me a boy who had left school had given it to her' On a close inspection there appeared a paper pasted over the inside of the cover This being removed Master Brudenell's name and the date of the year when it was bought at Mr Pote's appeared They carried it off and as soon as they arrived there shewed it to the rest of the boys of the house who unanimously agreed to interrogate the woman how it came into her possession She coloured and replied that she picked it up in their gateway They asked her if she could not read writing She said 'No' This they knew to be false but one of the larger boys said 'You must naturally have supposed that it belonged to some of us and you are a thief so they agreed to call her thief for a week This so exasperated her that she complained to her Mistress who instantly shewed Brudenell up to Dr Barnard the boy refused to be flogged until Dr Barnard had heard his case and if he did not find it true he would suffer any thing he pleased to inflict This he utterly refused and instantly expelled him"  The gentleman immediately went down to Eton and on examination every tittle of Brudenell's account appeared to be literally true but Dr Barnard positively refused to readmit himDr Barnard shewed of what  materials  his heart was composed by his  conduct to several amiable worthy young ladies in the neighbourhood  so well governed with such marked contempt as he did by not suffering  his son to be educated at that school but keeping him at home in his own house and introducing some person to teach him there never permitting him to associate or play with the fine youths of the school A few insignicant boys were now and then introduced to play with Master Barnard Could five hundred youths and boys some of them sons of the first  noblesse  of these three kingdoms others sons of the first scholars in those kingdoms degenerate in a  few days  after the  famous  Dr Barnard ceased to govern them that he could prefer all the  uncomfortable inconveniences of an homeeducation  for his only child Had Dr Barnard been removed to the provostship of King's College  something  might have been offered in excuse for this cruel conduct to the new Master  a man of profound erudition and before he became master  He was well known to the Writer before he became Master she meeting him often at the house of her learned sensible throughly agreeable lively friend the late H B Buckeridge Esquire where some of the most joyous eveningsmornings of her life alas for poor Mr Buckeridgewere what as with every body lateearly hours sadly injured in company with many amiable old friends and neighbours now no more It used to be said that the party would last a week round but for the agreeable amiable Dr Bostock father of Sir C Rich and the Writer who jointly agreed that they could not live without sleep  of amiable disposition and gentle manners but Dr Barnard the world at that time said meant to have a foil as he never could shew his wit without a  but  which occasioned his bringing in that poor weak creature Teddy Betham fellow of Eton  Mr Berkeley being ever a most obedient son went into college but he soon found very different treatment from what he had a right to expect from some of those in power Dr Barnard promised Dr Berkeley that he would send for him frequently and pay every attention to the grandson of the great Bishop Berkeley Mr Berkeley never entered the provost's house after he became  "  a poor colleger  The style of Dr Barnard for the younger sons of many gentlemen of good family  "  His father in order to remedy the evil permitted him to spend two hundred pounds a year during the whole time he remained in the college  It was evident that Mr Berkeley  never  escaped punishment when it could at any rate be contrived to inflict it and as a colleger he became more liable to it His Father learning this from other young men as well as from his son offered to take him from college but with that fortitude which attended him through life through his torturing illness for the last three years of it to his latest breath he declined it saying  "It was but for a few years"  However when he was a little turned of sixteen his Father instead of letting him remain until nineteen which was his original intention took him home to his house at Cookham determining to become his tutor for two years until he went to Oxford whither he intended to remove his family during Mr Berkeley's  séjour  at that university and the refusal of a house in St Giles's was secured to Dr Berkeley which was occupied by the very sensible R Harcourt Esquire for the same wise and kind purpose and it happily succeeded  On Mr Berkeley's quitting school in order to atone for the want of cricket at dear Eton Mr Berkeley had a fine hunter kept for him by his Father and he generally hunted twice a week with the buck hounds Mr Berkeley rode remarkably well  The village and neighbourhood of Cookham it should be observed though a very fluctuating one happened very  lukily for Mr Berkeley just at that time to abound with sensible cultivated polished families had his Parents selected them they could not have done it more in general to their wish These families viz the polite Lord Conyngham's the learned accomplished Daniel Malthus's Esquire the very sensible Thomas Forster's Esquire Thomas Parry's Esquire and those of two very sensible Ladies in two small houses lived in the strictest harmony perpetually meeting at each other's houses which occasioned Mr Berkeley's Mother one day to ask  "Where is our next PARISH meeting to be held"  and they ever after retained the name In the summer parties on the water to different parts of the banks of that beautiful river the Thames in the winter evenings music little dances and that most amusing of all round games Pope Joan  To the above may be added the large and agreeable society at Taplow the politest of men Lord Inchiquin and the Honourable Reverend sensible and truly worthy Mr Hamilton with his agreeable family the sensible and worthy relict of General Leighton with her accomplished daughters It will naturally be supposed that Mr Berkeley could not quit such  very  agreeable society without a pang  The "Farewell to the Banks of the Thames" was written about this time  especially when part of it was composed  of more than half a score such young ladies of whom it may without flattery or compliment be asserted were very rarely to be met with  even then  and Mr Berkeley was ever a much greater admirer of a sensible accomplished than of a very beautiful woman insomuch that his beloved respected revered friend Miss Mlths  Mr Berkeley wrote and printed but never published a most beautiful elegant Elegy on the ever to be lamented death of that lovely allaccomplished angelic young lady which happened in the summer of the year  used laughingly to tell him  "that HE really did not know a beautiful woman from a plain one"  so that it became a kind of cant expression amongst his young friends if any sensible plain young woman was named  "that she was one of BERKELEY's beauties"  But to return When the time of Mr Berkeley's departure drew near he very humbly and sensibly requested his Father to permit him to pass three years at the university of St Andrew in Scotland by which time to use his own words  "All my  dear  idle Eton friends will have quitted Oxford and  I  shall not be tempted to go out twice a week with Lord Abingdon's hounds"  When Mr Berkeley took his last farewell of his amiable friends at the Ferryhouse he could not articulate went out mounted his horse and followed the carriage over the Ferry It was a long and not a very pleasant journey  to quit a beautiful native country to adopt the language of the poet speaking of the soul entering the world of spirits  to go  To be she knows not what she knows not where  His parents accompanied him to the land of kind hospitality as it must ever be termed by the Writer of this Preface where Mr Berkeley passed three years and an half most happily where he formed a friendship with some of the first characters in that kingdom with many persons of rank and also amongst the literati which ended  but with his life  Mr Berkeley had the honour the  happiness  to be  enfant de famille  at Melvil House and he with heartfelt gratitude termed the exquisitely pious Earl and Countess of Leven his  Scottish parents  The goodness of that illustrious pair not only invited him to visit there for weeks himself but also to carry any English or Scotch student he pleased with him Mr Berkeley was too judicious and too wellbred to make an improper use of this condescending goodness having never introduced any but two or three Englishmen sons of men of rank or fashion constantly saying  "Lord Leven  must  know the characters of the  Fathers  of young Scottish gentlemen too well for  me  to introduce them"  With what delight would he often talk of the happy hours spent at Melvil House and his gratitude to his honoured  friend for inviting him attend him to Edinburgh when his lordship was appointed by his Majesty lord high commissioner of Scotland as also one of his introducedfriends the son of an English Peer and his lordship's giving  express  orders that Mr Berkeley should never dine any one day at the purse bearer's table but always at the commissioner's It is impossible to dismiss this article without attempting to celebrate the wonderful condescending amiability of the  noblesse  of Scotland particularly and in common with the ancient gentry of that kingdom to strangers of any degree of fashion and decent character It was a common remark of Dr Berkeley  "Were a Scotch gentleman to settle for some time in any  southern  or  eastern  county of England I wonder how many peers or men who in  fortune  equal peers would visit him"  And almost every peer and man of fortune in Fife have done us that honour which must ever be remembered with the most heartfelt gratitude by the Writer of this Preface  "Oh shame to our  English pride  "  used to exclaim Dr Berkeley Although born in London he spent the first eighteen years of his life under the roof of his noble illustriousminded Father in the  next  hospitable country in Europe to Scotland for the Scotch do certainly exceed even the Irish As Mrs Wedderburn used to say to the Writer of these pages  "The Irish give you an excellent dinner and supper and let you go out to  seek  a bed  we  always find one"  The remark was just and worthy the great  good sense of that throughly hospitable polite lady who having heard that Dr Berkeley's family none of whom she had ever then seen were travelling near her house immediately ordered her beds to be prepared and most politely visited them at their inn telling them that every thing was ready for their reception This and numberless other almost similar attentions from numerous other families of rank and fashion has for the last fifteen years caused the writer of this to term Scotland the Land of polite  kind  Hospitality Such may it long continue and they meet a more grateful return than they often do when they visit England than did the amiable  of Scotland from the  of  who went in and  hid  himself when he saw the equipage of his noble host in his parkone is tempted to wonder that he ever could emerge from his hiding place One of the amiable sons of Lord Leven coming from abroad went to an inn at Canterbury before he went to Dr Berkeley's He reproached him on Mr Leslie's saying  "He feared being troublesome"  Dr Berkeley replied  "My dear Sir if a  dog  came hither with a collar on his neck from Melvil house I should feel myself a monster not to entertain him"  Mr Monck Berkeley used often to be accused of partiality to Scotland and to his Scottish friends Indeed he had one of the most amiable hearts that ever beat in a human  breast It must have been a  very cold  heart that had not felt such amiable such respectful attentions as Mr Berkeley received in his seven hundred miles tour through the unfrequented parts of the Highlands which was chiefly performed on foot although Mr Berkeley had three horses and two servants but he often went where they could not follow him and at Edinburgh where he generally passed the first part of the St Andrew's vacation until the grouse shooting season commenced Although greatly his superiors in learning Mr Berkeley had the honour to rank amongst his literary friends Lord Buchan the profoundly learned highly polished allaccomplished Lord Monboddo Mr M'Kenzie and Dr Reid It is hoped that the introducing here a  bon mot  of Mr Berkeley's may be pardoned Lord Monboddo when visiting Dr Berkeley at St Andrew's with his usual exquisite politeness pressed the Doctor and his family to visit him at Monboddo and invited Mr Berkeley to pass the next vacation there Mrs Berkeley said to her son  "Surely you will go it will be a wonderful advantage to you to pass so many weeks under the roof of  such  a man as Lord Monboddo  Mrs George Berkeley from its first publication was an enthusiastic admirer of Lord Monboddo's "Ancient Metaphysics" so as to occasion Mr Monck Berkeley's always styling it his Mother's  second  Bible The first volume then only published Lord Monboddo did Mrs Berkeley the honour to send her the second saying he found she understood it with a note by the hand of the very deeply learned worthy Professor Hunter a very sincerely highly respected friend of Mr Monck Berkeley One of the most striking likenesses ever produced by the pencil is a portrait of this wonderful genius now in the possession of Mrs George Berkeley in his robes of a throughly upright just Judge It instantly on entering the room catches the eye of every stranger who has any skill in painting and very often of those who are honest enough to declare they have not any skill  "  Mr Berkeley replied  "My dear Madam  I am convinced that if I do go I shall return home the best Greek scholar in the university but I have great doubts whether my  heart  may not be more injured than my  head  benefited"  alluding to that loveliest of women Miss Burnett his Lordship's truly angelic darling daughter no longer an inhabitant of this sublunary world but gone to join her kindred spirits That lovely young lady can be only a  very  little more angelic in mind than when on earth Shakspeare's beautiful distich on a young woman in a country churchyard in Gloucestershire might have been inscribed on the monument of Eliza Burnett rather than on that of Eleanor Freeman  "Rest here blest Maid and wait th' Almighty's will  "Then rise unchang'd and be an Angel still"  Perhaps very few females in any age or country have united so much beauty good sense and amiableness of disposition  "and have borne their faculties so meekly"  as the lovely Miss Burnett She possessed all her honourable father's great superiority of understanding and all the refined  delicacy and genuine humility of her very lovely mother She saw she could not  but see  herself the idol of all the young men yet not one air of superiority not a grain of affectation ever appeared in her conduct A variety of diverting little anecdotes of the universal desire of the young gentlemen students of St Andrew's to appear agreeable at least not disagreeable to Miss Burnett might be related by the writer to the amusement of the reader  D  M  Esquire one of those few Laymen as Dr Berkeley used to observe who kept up their classical learning after they had quitted the university for he generally redde Greek from four to six hours every day was a great admirer of the rising genius of Mr Berkeley insomuch that he became sincerely attached to him and Mr Berkeley ever retained a most affectionate grateful regard for this gentleman's condescension as he termed it in suffering a youth from school to enjoy so much of his society who had children elder than Mr Berkeley  As the families lived in the greatest intimacy in the happiest friendship they generally met three or four times a week One evening at Dr Berkeley's the barenness of newspapers was as was  then  usual I think everywhere lamented  "nothing worth reading in them"  Mr Berkeley reached out his arm and taking Dr Berkeley's constant paper the St James's Chronicle ran his eye over it and said  "I think  there is something in this today"  and began reading something which lasted about ten minutes that every body agreed  was  worth reading At night Mr M  desired permission to take it home saying he would return it in the morning The next day at noon he brought it to Dr Berkeley's telling him  "that he believed he had taken the wrong paper for he could not find what Mr Berkeley read the evening before"  Mrs Berkeley shewed him all the last papers but in vain At dinner Mrs Berkeley asked her son  "out of what paper he had read the evening before not out of the St James's Chronicle for that Mr M  and she had been searching several of them and could not find it"  Mr Berkeley replied  "My dear Madam I never doubted of yours or Mr M  's cleverness but you must both be much cleverer than I take either of you to be if you  could  have found it"  "Why should we not find it"  "Because it was not to be found"  "Where is it then Tell Mr M  that he may read it"  "Alas I cannot for it never was any where but in your son's brain"  "What do you mean child I do not understand you"  "Why my dear Madam when I hear people finding such fault with the poor newspapers I often take them up and help them out as I did last night I have done it scores of times before for my Father and Aunt who only  skim  a newspaper You know they say you study it"  It must however be observed in order to do justice to Mr Berkeley's gratitude for the numberless polite amiable friendly attentions received from every rank in that land of kind hospitality during his three years and a half  séjour  there that he was almost brokenhearted at quitting it and twice after revisited it and would have continued to do so had his life been spared Dr Berkeley being at that time in an indifferent state of health the journey was about six weeks in performing as he rested some time at York where Mr Berkeley had what he ever esteemed an honour young as he was of commencing an acquaintance with the truly learned and pious Dr Burgh by the polite attentions of his Mother's respected friends Mrs Moritts  Every person of any fashion who visits York endeavours to obtain an introduction to those sensible cultivated ladies the many only to gratify their eyes with a sight of the exquisitely fine  paintings in needlework  of the eldest Mrs Morritt those who are capable of relishing refined conversation to feast their minds the house of those excellent ladies being the general rendezvous of every one who can relish the charms of refined conversation Mr Berkeley lamented that his  living  idol as Gray was his dead one amongst poets Mr Mason was absent from York at that time  whose beautifully adorned house is admired by all persons who have any skill in painting By the very polite attentions of the Dean of York his Lady and several other families of fashion which were ever most gratefully remembered Mr Berkeley and the family passed their time most agreeably in that antient city to which the library of the very civil Mr Todd contributed in no small degree one of the delights of Mr Berkeley's life being to read in  a library a happiness he enjoyed in his Father's house Bishop Berkeley's library being valued at two thousand pounds at the time of his death Dr Berkeley being indisposed rested some time at Newcastle  In their road to Edinburgh they passed through the town of Lauder A very little way out of the town stands Lauder Castle one of the seats of the late worthy Earl of Lauderdale As the horses were to bait at least two hours Mr Berkeley after dinner went down to the castle the family being absent he requested the porter to permit him to enter and look at the pictures He had from his childhood a wonderfully fine eye for painting It is probable he owed it to the so often hearing the merits and demerits of his grandfather's collection of pictures talked over The man who was a tailor and hard at work said he would call his  gewd weef  to shew him the castle  It is hoped the reader will pardon the introducing a dialogue between the Gewd Weef and Mr Berkeley  Gewd Weef  "Pray Laddie whence come ye and whither gang ye that ye be come to Lauder  Mr Berkeley  "I came from England and I am going to St Andrew's  G W  "Belike ye come from London  Mr B  "I came from within about twenty miles of it  G W  "Were ye ever at the greet toon  Mr B  "Yes very often  G W  "Then ye can tell me what they pay there for washing a  sark  i e shirt for it would be a  great savice  to me to know I have always washed my Lord's men's when the family is at the castle and they will pay me but two pence a sark and I have been told by a many that they pay  nine  pence there for every sark and I sadly want to ken"  Mr B  "You have been misinformed I never pay more than four pence for a full trimmed shirt  G W  "Wellee wat that is but little I have been told it is always  nine  pence"  During this dialogue a young woman entered with her hair curled and powdered Mr Berkeley had asked the Gewd Weef how many miles it was to St Andrew's She replied to that as to almost every thing  "Donaken"  On the appearance of the young woman she said  "If you ask this lassey she can tell you She knows muckle things"  Mr Berkeley taking off his hat made the enquiry and was very civilly informed The young woman having dispatched her business with the tailor went away and the dialogue recommenced  Gewd Weef  "I suppose you 'll gang home this way from St  Anders  Hoo long shall ye tarry there  Mr Berkeley  "About three years if it please God I live so long"  G W  "Three years for what can ye stay there three years  It may not be amiss to remark here that every Scotsman thinks it incumbent on him to visit St Andrew's once in his life and take a view of the beautiful ruins of the finest Christian temple perhaps ever built by man During Dr Berkeley's residence there one party arrived so late that they only saw it by the light of an old horn lantern but they would say they saw it    Mr B  "To study at the university there  G W  "Aye Laddie ye ha studied enough Ye seem to ken a  vast  deal of pictures and other larning No no ye had better tarry here and marry yon lassey She has houses twa and parks  The Scots call fields parks and a wood a policy  five She 'll mak a gewd weef I can tell ye and you 'll make her a rare  gewd mon  Mr B  "I am much obliged to you for your good will to me but I am afraid my Father and Mother would think me too young to marry and settle  G W  "And where be they  Mr B  "At the inn in the town  G W  "Aye there's twa pretty lasseys at the inn They 'll haa muckle siller An aye take one of them"  At that instant a coach and four drove down when the Gewd Weef exclaimed  "What haa we got coming here  Mr B  "The carriage in which I came from England  G W  "Ye come from England in  that  anacarriage and wha came wee ye  Mr B  "Why my Father and my Mother and my Mother's maid  G W  "Aye Laddie Laddie if you came in that anacoach ye 'll not marry oone of oor Lasseys What muckle siller it must haa cost your Father to bring ye  aa  ie all doon here"  Mr Berkeley then took his leave of the Gewd Weef presenting her with a bright half crown with which she was much delighted and wished him a  fine Laady  when he married  About three years after Mr Berkeley accompanied his worthy friend Henry Grimston Esquire to the famous contested election for Yorkshire Mr Grimston going up  from St Andrew's to assist in supporting the interests of his godfather and friend  Duncombe Esquire They returned by Lauder when they together with their learned lively tutor Mr Bruce whom they agreed to treat with a sight of York visited the castle Mr Grimston archly asked the  gewd weef  "If she had ever seen that gentleman before"  pointing to Mr Berkeley when she exclaimed  "Aye that I have and he gave me  half a croon  "  Mr Berkeley at his second visit doubled the bounty and used frequently to laugh with his friends and say that he had  "never met with  such  a friend  since  for that she endeavoured according to her idea to procure him a wife with a  large  fortune"  Soon after his first visit to the castle he made a song entitled "The Lass of Lauder" and had it set to music by Mr Jenkins the musicmaster at St Andrew's but now a teacher of that science in London Mr Berkeley used jocularly to remark  "It is very certain that I had not made so  favourable  an impression on the  lassey  as I had on the  gewd weef  at Lauder for she stayed only to settle her business with the tailor and then went off"  Some years after Mr Berkeley being on a visit at PetenWeem and going with his friend to drink tea at a gentleman's house was asked  "If he had not once been at Lauder castle"  He replied  "I have been twice there"  The female who asked the question said  "I had the honour of seeing you there Sir and I should esteem it an honour if you would drink tea with  me during your stay here"  Mr Berkeley instantly recollected that it was the  Lass of Lauder  who did not then know that she had been  "celebrated in song"  Mr Berkeley was to have left PetenWeem the next day but with his wonted amiability postponed it until the day following that he might visit the  Lass  who was then married to the Reliefminister  The Reliefminister is one chosen by the people of any place where they do not happen to approve the established Kirkminister There are few towns or even villages without one Mr Berkeley and several other gentlemen now living were present when one of these good men asserted  "That if Zaccheus the publican had been blessed with TREW FAAITHE he had not fallen from the tree into which he had climbed to see our blessed Lord pass by"  All the company exclaimed that the good little publican did not fall from the tree but gladly came down to prepare to receive his heavenly guest The producing the book of God and turning to the chapter very hardly convinced this RELIEFMINISTER  that he did not fall  for want of TREW FAAITHE  of that place Several families were invited to meet him and a very gay afternoon was spent Mr Berkeley telling Mrs  that she had made a better match for herself than the Gewd Weef at Lauder Castle wished to have made for her Mr Berkeley who had neither vanity nor conceit here exceeded the truth Dr L  a friend of his father and the worthy Sir C B  a very old friend of his Mother both urged him seriously to visit them to see after two young ladies of immense fortunes in their respective counties assuring him that he must infallibly succeed Mr Berkeley's uniform reply to all such kind invitations was  "I early resolved not to be a fortunehunter  I  have no large rentroll to produce  I will never alarm or distress the  anxious  Parents of any great Fortunes"  Mr Berkeley from his youth from his Mother was an  hereditary  admirer and strenuous advocate for the unfortunate INJURED Mary and a detester of her cunning cruel persecutor Elizabeth requested his Father to go to St Andrew's by the road of Kinross that he might visit the castle of LochLeven and he spent some time in wandering about the ruins so much as occasioned his and his servant's being benighted on a heath to the extreme distress of his Mother who was then unacquainted with the exquisite the amiable hospitality of the Scottish nation high and low rich and poor for Mr Berkeley could with difficulty force a shilling into the hand of a man who went a quarter of a mile over the heath to put him in the road to CuparinFife where his family were to sleep that night and it was very late before he and his servant arrived there  The next morning they all set out for St Andrew's about eight miles distant and enjoyed the prospect from the top of the hill of the  still  magnificent cathedral and the tower of St Regulus or St Rule of which there are four beautiful engravings with Cardinal Bethune's Castle by Oliphant now exceedingly scarce and very dear the plates being lost  It is supposed that when that ingenious young man died the plates were sold amongst other metal things for their weight    On entering the city at the Argyle Port your eye is greeted with a noble wide street one mile in length and at the lower end of a noble breadth with stone houses most of them disfigured by what is termed a  fore stair  that is an open stair case on the outside in a zigzag manner across the front of the house and an huge  smidie  a not inelegant name for a filthy thing a dunghill no court no palisade no breastwall or railing before even the best houses excepting only what was once the palace of James the First of England but it is not meant here to give an imperfect description of this once beautiful magnificent city which has been so well done by Boswell and Pennant before John Knox  preached  it into ruins by removing an archbishop dean and eight resident prebendaries who fed the hungry clothed the naked and administered to the wants of the sick and needy who are all now starving On a full sight of this dreary deserted city Mr Berkeley wept to think that he was to remain if God spared his life three long years in it The house taken for Dr Berkeley's family the best then to be had in the town was without even a back door the covetous wretch who owned it having sold a little spot behind it to a gentleman at the next house so the door was stopped up Dr Berkeley seeing Mr Berkeley so deeply affected and Principal Watson whose learning had induced him to prefer St Andrew's to a foreign university having died a very few days before made Mr Berkeley the offer of returning to England the next  day for which he felt great gratitude but with his wonted strength of mind declared that let him suffer what he might he would remain his three years It is but justice to say that Mr Berkeley shed more tears at leaving St Andrew's than he drew sighs at entering it  So deeply was submission to  lawful  authority engraven on Mr Berkeley's mind that during the three years and a half he was a student at the university of St Andrew he never would go out for even two or three nights to his noble truly amiable friend the Earl of Leven's at Melvil House without going to  ask leave out  as it is termed of the Principal Dr M'Cormick whom Mr Berkeley always called  "our polite amiable Principal"  or in his absence of the Professor who used politely to say that  "he living in his Father's house it was needless to trouble himself"  His constant reply was that  "the statutes which he had promised to observe  enjoined  it"  It is hoped that the relation of a little adventure which Mr Berkeley met with during his residence at St Andrew's may be pardoned A very few days before the term began in autumn Mr Berkeley who was at that time a very keen sportsman was told by the son of the Professor of Medicine a very sensible young man now settled in Canada that if he wished it he could lead him to a place where Ptermagants abounded The youths set out  marched several miles night overtook them and they wandered in a very dark evening unable to find the road At length the moon began to appear and presented to their view a figure all in white Mr Berkeley soon learnt to speak Scotch so perfectly as at any time throughout his life to be mistaken whenever he wished it for a true Scot which often amused his friends or strangers of that country which his Mother ever termed  "  The Land of kind Hospitality  "  a proof whereof will soon appear  Mr Berkeley accosted the young woman with  "Lassey whither gang ye  Lassey  "To yonder house Laddie  Mr B  "Can we get lodging there to night  Lassey  "Hoo can ye ask that question with these weapons in your hands They  must  lodge ye  Mr B  "God forbid that we should attempt to  force  any one to lodge  us  and to convince you how harmless we are I will instantly discharge my piece"  Mr Berkeley immediately fired off a fine doublebarreled gun and requested his friend to follow his example They then escorted the nymph about a quarter of a mile to the house where Mr Berkeley refused to enter until permission was obtained by their kind guide who went in alone In a minute out rushed  "a bevey of fair nymphs"  more than  twenty with a matron in the rear who very wisely began examining them how they came on that wild heath at that hour who and what they were Mr Berkeley being spokesman assured them that they were honest young men students of St Andrew's Still they were distrusted  At length fortunately for them a young woman espied a youth in the highland dress and going up to him asked  "Who he was"  Servant  "Who why I am servant to that tall gentleman  Young Woman  "And who is he  Servant  "Who why Mr Berkeley secondary at St Andrew's  Young Woman  "Where does he come from to keep a servant at college  Servant  "Why from England"  Young Woman  "From what part of England  Servant  "Why from Canterbury My Master's Father is one of the Prebendaries there and is a gentleman of  great  family"  Mr Berkeley used to laugh when relating this conversation and say  "All M'Nicoll's account of my Father's  dignity  in the  church  availed  me no more  than they will do in  the world of spirits"  But luckily some one asked Mr Berkeley's highlander  "Who was his master's companion"  to which he being irritated replied  "What does that signify He is son to Dr Flint of St Andrew's"  The magical name of Flint as Mr Berkeley used to say  "acted like a charm"  Dr Flint is a most incomparable physician Mr Flint was immediately examined and  cross examined  and it was determined to admit them they delivering up their guns to the nymphs Mr Berkeley with his usual elegant gallantry instantly delivered his into the hands of their kind guide They then went into the house being almost starved with cold and sadly tired Plenty of food and a good fire soon reanimated them Still they saw nothing but females all clothed in white No male appeared The men were attending the corn At length they all agreed that it was time to set offmelancholy news as Mr Berkeley used to say to a couple of young men Whither were they to go  "Could not the beaux escort them"  they replied  "to a neighbouring harvesthome to a dance"  Mr Berkeley who was a remarkably fine dancer and loved it exceedingly jumped up forgot all the fatigues of the day and said  "that he and his friend would attend them"  Their hospitable and very sensible hostess replied  "Oh Sir it is not such a ball as you have been used to in England there will be only farmers' daughters I will have the pleasure of endeavouring to entertain you and Mr Flint here"  Mr Berkeley  with his usual engaging politeness said  "There will be  your  daughters Madam and our kind conductress to your hospitable roof"  The young men went and danced in the barn till four in the morning slept soundly as may be guessed until near noon took an excellent  Scotch  breakfast even Dr Johnson liked the  breakfasts  in Scotland and after inviting his kind hostess and her son to dine at his Father's house in St Andrew's when either business or pleasure called them to that ancient city took their leave The young man went once or twice to Dr Berkeley's Mr Berkeley who was born with what is commonly but often falsely called a princely spirit although not to a princely fortune did not think a few grateful speeches an adequate return for being rescued from sleeping among the heather on the heath but sent his worthy landlady some fine prints elegantly framed and glazed to adorn her parlour with which he had great pleasure in finding she was much delighted Some of Mr Berkeley's intimates among the students laughed at him saying  "Now Berkeley  you  have lain out a night without leave"  The great Charles Leslie the famous controversial writer used to say of Mr Berkeley's maternal greatgrandfather the celebrated Francis Cherry Esquire of Shottesbrooke House in Berkshire that he believed him to have the most accurate the soundest judgement that God had in these latter days bestowed on man A multitude of instances  might be adduced to prove that although Mr Berkeley inherited but little of Mr Cherry's immense fortune he certainly did of a better portion than money  Mr Berkeley on his return from his highland tour told his family that he might he believed have lived seven years there on the merits of the ring sent by the old Chevalier de St George to Mr Cherry when he sent Mr Leslie at his own expence to Rome to try to convert him from Popery Mr Leslie wrote Mr Cherry word from Rome that an attempt to make the sun rise in the WEST would be equally successful  Mr Berkeley said  "He felt a  little  ashamed that the ring should be  so  well known in the Highlands and that  he the presumptive heir to it  had never seen it more than once or twice in his life"  He requested his Mother and Aunt to gratify him with a sight of it that he might be able in future to give a  better  account of the famous relic  It has been already observed  See before p xix  that one of Mr Berkeley's friends used to tell him  "that he was as extraordinarily descended by his Mother's side  William Cherry Esquire known by the name of the Great Lawyer son of Sir Francis Cherry esteemed the acutest counsellor of his time as the learned Earl of Clarendon bears testimony in his Papers and Letters published by Powney about thirty years ago In one of the letters he says  "I have had the opinion of the attorney and solicitor general on my cause but I  cannot rest  satisfied till I hear what old Cherry says about it"  Mr Cherry was at law with King James when he fled A considerable part of Shottesbrooke estate lies in Windsor Forest Mr Cherry had planted some young trees and was inclosing them The King rode by and asked the labourer  "Who bid him do it"  He answered  "My Master please your Majesty"  "It does  not  please me"  replied the King  "and  I  order you to throw up the inclosure directly"  He did so Mr Cherry's old steward informed his Master immediately of it who ordered that the same labourer should directly set about inclosing it again The next huntingmorning his Majesty found him at work and asked  "How he dared to do what he had forbidden him to do"  He replied  "His Master had ordered it"  The King commanded him to undo his work at his peril which the poor fellow did and Mr Cherry who when in the country acted as a justice of the peace committed him to Reading gaol and commenced a suit against the King Luckily for this poor man he could not only read but write being clerk of the parish of White Waltham where and in many surrounding parishes Mr Cherry had large farms and always found and made his tenants find work for the industrious labourers When the poor innocent culprit reached the gaol he wrote a long and interesting letter to the King telling his Majesty that as his good old Master had now turned him off from his work for obeying him he hoped his Majesty would be pleased in his  consideration  to send him some money to keep him  comfortably  in gaol and after much more curious matter subscribed himself  "his Majesty's poor pitiful patient lamentable servant JOHN HONE"  This letter reached the King about three weeks before he left the kingdom when Mr Cherry immediately liberated honest John and took care that he had every comfort during his imprisonment Mr Cherry having sent the man to gaol only to teach the Monarch what he might  not  do Mr Berkeley had for some years been writing a treatise on "The Prerogatives of the Crown" and one volume was ready for the press at the time of his death How far he would have approved his ancestor's conduct in this matter is uncertain This transaction is somewhat differently told in the old ballad of "The King and Mr Cherry" This gentleman was killed by the overturning of his chariot as he was going down a hill in Kent near the seat of the grandfather of the late worthy Sir Sidney Stafford Smythe by whom and his lady every humane amiable attention was paid him that his desperate situation would admit of His death was the more to be lamented by his excellent son as on the coroner's inquest it appeared to have happened through roguery the verdict being  "  Killed by the footboard having been mended with old rusty nails  "  On going down the hill the coachman of course pressing more on the footboard than on even ground it gave way and he fell down among the horses who immediately ran away in half a dozen different directions threw off the postillion and broke the chariot entirely to pieces When they stopped it was a quarter of an hour before Mr Cherry's valet de chambre who was attending his Master on horseback could discover life either in his Master Mr Partridge of the Isle of Ely to whom Mr cherry was guardian or any of the servants The moment he found his Master was not dead he rode off to town to carry down the Queen's serjeantsurgeon and sent off from London an express to Mr Cherry at Shottesbrooke On the arrival of the surgeon he asked Mr Cherry  "Where he felt pain"  He replied  "Ah Sir where do I  not  feel pain"  A piece of the plate glass of the chariot was taken out of his head as large as the palm of a man's hand Mr Cherry lived only four days after the accident the surgeon saying  "He is the noblest ruin I ever saw I never beheld such a man of eightythree but for this accident he would probably have attained to the age of old Parr"  Mr Cherry's strength of body and mind were equal at eightythree to what they were at thirtythree This account of Mr Cherry's death and Mr Partridge's almost miraculous escape is very differently and very erroneously related in a work printed about seventy years ago by a gentleman of fortune in Devonshire Mr Cherry's lady's father John Whitefield Esquire of Ives Place near Maidenhead was thrown from his horse and drowned in the Thames when taking an airing one evening near his own house at an advanced age Mr Berkeley's Mother's paternal grandfather was killed by a fall from his horse as he was riding one morning near his own house at the age of eightyone The lady of the celebrated Francis Cherry Esquire the patron of Thomas Hearne one of his underfootmen was the eldest of the five coheiresses of John Finch Esquire of Fienes Court Berks In the cloaths of this gentleman was King Charles the Second dressed when he escaped with Lady Jane Lane Oh shame to  royal  gratitude that this lady was not made a Duchess to descend to her heirs female as well as male He used to say  "that he had worn Mr Finch's old cloaths"  Mr Finch having gone down a few weeks before to marry the beautiful rich heiress of Sir John Chapman aged fifteen An exquisitely fine very small miniature of this Lady by Pettitote is in the possession of Mr Monck Berkeley's Aunt Mrs Frinsham it having been presented to her by Mr Berkeley's Mother at Mrs Berkeley's marriage  as he was  nobly  by his Father's most of his maternal grandsires having had something  remarkable about them"  If Mr Berkeley had  any  pride when a man which had not been eradicated in his childhood by the incessant pains raken to eradicate it it was what is called I think very erroneously  family pride  for  one certainly may feel grateful to God that one's Father was not a Tinker but a Gentleman without despising those of very low extraction if they are not  "  beggars set on horseback  riding to the  "  Mr Berkeley used to say  "  Any  monarch may make  any  man noble but he cannot bestow on him a long train of coronetted ancestors that belongs only to the King of kings who was as I think graciously pleased to cause me to be born the son of Dr Berkeley rather than the son of Tom Smith my Father's butcher"  It is impossible for the Writer of this Preface not to pay a small tribute of gratitude to the memory of that uncommonly judicious amiable young gentleman the late Meredith Price Junior Esquire to whose wisdom prudence and humanity before either had completed his twentieth  year Mr Berkeley owed that he was not either a  murderer  or  murdered  During their residence at the university of St Andrew's Mr Berkeley was one day attacked by Mr G  a student he was  not  a Scotchman for an affront that he  supposed  Mr Berkeley had offered to the fame of a Distiller's daughter who resided near St Andrew's to whom or to whose father's table Mr G  paid great attention Mr Berkeley defended himself by declaring that  "so far from  speaking  slightingly of the young woman he had never even  thought  slightingly of her"  Mr G  brutally said  "You say so because you are a coward and are afraid to fight"  This Mr Berkeley received very calmly replying  "G  those who have known me through life will never say  that  of me"  When a youth it used to be said of Mr Berkeley  "He fears  nothing  but God and his own Mother"  Mr G  then proceeded  "I may say whatever I please to  you  for you dare not challenge me through fear of your Mother's displeasure She  never  would forgive you if you fought a duel"  This dastardly  vautrien  was mistaken for Mrs Berkeley's horror of those  wretched  parents who can  cast off  a child for ANY crime that fallen man or  woman  can commit  The very idea of casting off or deserting any creature that one has been the means of bringing into this worldleaving them entirely to the air and the prince of the power of the airis  replete with horror  That it is not like our heavenly Father ALL must see and feel  was so strong that from Mr Berkeley's age  of fifteen his Mother used frequently to say to him  "May God give you grace to grow up an excellent honest worthy young man but always remember that there is  no  crime you can commit that shall ever make  me  desert you and if you should become extravagant whilst ever I have a guinea you shall have eighteen shillings of it and I am sure whilst ever you have one you would give me twenty out of it"  Mr G  might with equal justice have added  "your Father"  for Dr Berkeley's  On the matter becoming public Dr Berkeley said to his son  "You ought to have cut the matter short by saying that let his father have gotten any sum by  it was certainly beneath your dignity as a gentleman to fight with the son of  and not have  degraded  yourself by sending a challenge to the  son  of G  "  Dr Berkeley and his Father the Bishop both felt pleasure without pride in their VERY antient noble descent  horror  of that BARBAROUS custom of duelling was at least equal to Mrs Berkeley's although he might not perhaps so frequently descant upon the subject This last outrage was too much for Mr Berkeley It roused  "all the noble blood of the Berkeleys in his veins"  He left the room went home immediately retired to his apartment wrote and sent the challenge His next care was to pitch upon a second He determined it should not be his dear friend Mr L  lest it should embroil him with his excellent noble Father Lord  That young gentleman used to say to Dr Berkeley  "I do not know how to forgive Berkeley's  not  calling upon  me  on that occasion I who have received so many amiable kind  attentions from him and his family"  Mr Berkeley went to a gentleman one of his companions at Eton to whom he had been particularly attached from twelve years old and who had manifold more obligations than Mr L  he was many months an inmate at Dr Berkeley's On Mr Berkeley's requesting him to attend him the next morning he hummed a little while and at length stammered out  "That he was afraid whether or no his  papa  might approve of it so begged his  dear  Berkeley would  excuse him  "  Why his Father should disapprove it puzzled all who knew his character it could not be on account of breaking God's holy law for Mr  would become wretched if he supposed any body suspected him of believing in God indeed the conduct of this  fine  Mr  towards his lady and children has evidently proved it The description of Mr  in  shire where his great estate lies is this  "The  first  time you are in company with him you are charmed the  second  you like him much less and the  third  you long to kick him out of the roomas he deserves"  Mr Berkeley resolved not to call on any friend English or Scottish whose fortunes it might injure the certain consequence being expulsion from the university went to Mr Price who owed no obligation of any sort except permission to attend the service of the Church of England at Dr Berkeley's private chapel and of course being sometimes invited to a dinner supper or dance in common with other English  and Scottish young gentlemen Mr Price instantly replied  "He was entirely at Mr Berkeley's service but hoped the matter might be accommodated without fighting"  Mr Berkeley assured him  "  that was impossible  "  They therefore proceeded to the place where this wise young gentleman again urged the matter so sensibly so eloquently that Mr G  offered to make any submission that Mr Berkeley should require Mr Berkeley from his infancy although a little fury was surely the most ready to pardon of all the fallen children of Adam insomuch that his Mother used to say  "That if any one murdered him and he lived only three minutes he would  freely  forgive them"  constantly adding  "Alas he does not inherit that from  me  "  Mr Berkeley however was so exasperated at the brutal rascality of  "I may say whatever I please for you DARE not fight"  c that for once he appeared inexorable The ground was measured the pistols were delivered and the swords laid ready when Mr Price instead of giving the word to fire stepped in between the combatants and so wisely so pathetically conjured Mr Berkeley to accept Mr G  's offers of making  every  submission that at length Mr Berkeley with his wonted sweetness threw away his pistol and said  "Well G  you shall beg my pardon in no other way than saying in Mr Price's presence before the gentlemen in whose company you insulted me that you are sorry you provoked me"  So this frightful affair ended But not the gratitude of Mr  Berkeley and his parents Providence had placed Mr Price in a situation to render other return than polite and friendly attentions out of the question When Mr Price went to France they felt unfeigned pleasure in giving him letters of introduction to several very worthy French families with whom they were intimate which rendered his  séjour  in that once delightful country very pleasant May that amiable young gentleman be now rejoicing in one still pleasanter  It may perhaps be asked by some  "With all these amiable qualities and great virtues had Mr Berkeley no vices"  Alas yes Mr Berkeley fell as David fell  There is no history through the whole Bible that affords more  diversion  to the pert ignorant young  sucking  Atheist than the lamentable fall of David But let such  poor  wits remember what God says to David by Nathan  "Because by  this  deed thou hast given great occasion to the  enemies  of the  Lord  to  blaspheme  "  c God foresaw the  wit  of these geniuses but let them remember the  title  bestowed on them  "The  enemies  of the  Lord  "  for the  friends  of  must ever feel for the subsequent sufferings of David through the whole remainder of his life His children guilty of incest murder horrid deceit and rebellion punished him even to his extreme old age  It is impossible here to avoid relating an anecdote of Mr Berkeley's celebrated learned grandfather  Bishop Berkeley walking down Pall Mall with his darling friend Bishop Benson whom he used to call Titus  "the delight of human kind"  there rushed out of the Star and Garter four or five  very witty bucks  of that day One exclaimed  "A brace of Bishops" the bishops then wore purple coats "let us put them up"  Bishop Benson being a much lighter man than Bishop Berkeley instantly ran off to the opposite side of the way The Wits immediately made a circle and inclosed poor Bishop Berkeley whom they thus  wittily  accosted  "Pray my Lord what does your Lordship think of King David David loved a pretty girl my Lord"  "Gentlemen I think that King David was a  very great sinner  as  you  and  I  are but God gave him grace to repent of his sin as  I sincerely hope  he will to YOU and ME"  They all slank off like  pitiful fools  excepting one who said  "I humbly heartily be your Lordship's pardon"  The same very ready and pointed wit Mr Berkeley shewed on a different occasion When introduced to the late Lord Mansfield by his Lordship's desire he eyed him about half a minute when Mr Berkeley expected him to say what many lords and learned men had often said to him  "that they were happy to see the grandson of their excellent old Friend"  Lord Mansfield said  "To Berkeley every virtue under heaven"  Mr Berkeley instantly replied  "How sweet an Ovid was in Murray lost"  Lord Mansfield said  "You are Sir a very polite young gentleman indeed Aye Sir Mr Pope was very partial to me"  took Berkeley under the arm and walked off with him All Tunbridge talked of Mr Berkeley's ready wit Some of Mr Berkeley's friends on hearing it said to him  "Berkeley we are afraid the old Prelate was a Forestaller and has left none of these VIRTUES to you"  as Solomon fellbut  with them  he received grace  to repent and mercy to console his throughly humbled penitent contrite spirit Mr Berkeley had not sufficiently attended to that admonition of the Wise King  "Use not much the company of a woman that is a singer"  Mr Berkeley's enthusiastic love of music drew him into the  snares of the celebrated Mrs  His delight in real sterling wit caused him to fall into the  "deep ditch"  long  digging for him by Lady  From both it pleased the great MERCY of God to rescue him For more than four years before his death his lovely spirit was supplicating for that pardon promised by our allgracious Redeemer to ALL who turn to him in faith  "Him that cometh unto ME I will in no wise cast out"  Mr Berkeley reflecting on his thoroughly pious education and many other advantages considered himself as a much greater sinner than any of his young friends who had not been so favoured by Providence could possibly be But it pleased the God of Mercy to speak peace to his wounded spirit  "I have heard thy prayer I have seen thy tears"  Isaiah xxxviii and for some weeks before his death to pour the balm of perfect peace into his dear wounded spirit and most graciously to  "lift up the light of his reconciled countenance upon him"  Mr Berkeley had too strong an understanding not to believe with his  whole  heart and mind the truths the  blessed  truths revealed in the Gospel of Peace He was blessed with an  honest  mind as has been said of a very great man still living as much Mr Berkeley's superior in years as in rank  "His Lordship is  too  honest to endeavour to warp the Gospel to  his  life and he  feels  every day that they are at war which makes him so illtempered with a wonderfully amiable nature ever  acting  the kindest things  ever  speaking  the roughest"  There Mr Berkeley resembled  not  the noble Peer for he was never known from a child to say a disobliging thing to any one So attached to him was every servant he ever had from the age of seventeen as that to use a common phrase  "they would have gone through fire and water for him"  even the poor creature whom he took from his Grace of Bedford after his beloved Scotch servant marriedwho now lives most happily with a much beloved honoured and respected relation of Mr Berkeley's the polite the accomplished the learned Sir Francis Lumm Baronet for whose kind unwearied watchful attentions to Mr Berkeley from his first return to England Mr Berkeley his Father and Mother ever felt the survivor still feels the deepest gratitudethis poor creature one night robbed Mr Berkeley in the Temple On his being pressed to appear against him he  absolutely  refused When strongly urged that it was  right  he replied  "It  must  be so to be sure to hang a poor devil who might have murdered me for we were in the chambers alone and he only took my watch and a few guineas No I hope he may live to repent Poor creature I am sure  I  will never appear  against  him I wish I could appear  for  him"  The present Earl of E  when a  very  young man was robbed on Salisbury Plain by the famous Dumas afterwards executed at Oxford His Lordship with the usual  spirit of  nineteen  was resolved not to be robbed Dumas demanded his watch and money Out sprang his Lordship down jumped Dumas Lord P  as he then was attempted to fire his pistol would not go off He threw it down and had recourse to the second which likewise flashed in the pan Dumas then said  "Sir you are in my power you will be pleased to give me your watch and money"  The request was complied with In a short time Dumas was taken committed to Fisherton gaol and tried Lord P  was subpoenaed to appear His Lordship's purse was produced He said  "He could not say that was his purse"  Then the watch his Lordship could not say the watch was his The seals arms crest c were produced but his Lordship said  "It was impossible for him to  swear  to them"  On being asked by his friends when he came out of court  "if he had  lost his wits  not to know his own arms crest"  c he nobly replied  "Know them to be sure I do But do you think I would take away the life of a poor distressed creature who had  my  life in his power and would not hurt a hair of my head"  It was immediately said that Lord P  was become a Methodistan high compliment surely to the Methodists It is not likely that a follower of that archhypocrite John Wesley should have acted thus unless some pelf or plunder was to be obtained thereby at least if they resembled their wretched leader whose practice was  to fleece the rich to feather  finely  feather harlots and rogues Witness poor Mr and Mrs G  ths of C  who were induced to turn their house into a kind of Lock Hospital until they had no house left in which to shelter their aged heads only a two pair of stairs lodging in London On their first acquaintance with the ZEALOUS apostle of  they kept a carriage and a pair of good horses to draw it a coachman footman and several female servants A few years reduced them to the situation above described A letter written by Mrs G  ths from the London garret to a lady at C  describing their sufferings was sufficient to have distressed any hearer of it But it was of a piece with his setting Miss B  t with fifty thousand pounds to wash her own linen that young harlots might be healed of their bodily diseases and dressed out to draw in poor deluded young men to marry them One of the nymphs thus restored to health at Mrs G  ths's was actually married to a person in London who settled on her a jointure of three hundred pounds  per annum  Such were the good works of John Wesley May his followers cease to practise them One does not find them recommended in Scripture St Paul says  "Charge them that are rich that they be ready to distribute willing to communicate"  c not turn themselves into washerwomen and retire to garrets with their poor blind lame deluded husbands as did Mrs G    But to return To say that Mr Berkeley's servants loved him is too feeble an expression His own and the servants of his Father's family in general old in his service almost idolized him His generosity his condescending goodness to the meanest servant in the house was so engaging that joy enlivened every countenance whenever he visited at his Father's He had been very early taught that although it had pleased Providence to place him in a different station of life from his Father's servants yet that he must ever treat them with kind civility He and his brother were always made whilst children to take off their hat to the lowest peasant and washerwoman who passed them in the village and so habitual was it to Mr Berkeley to be  "  courteous to all men  "  that when he gave orders to his servant a stranger to him would not have supposed he had been speaking to his own domestic yet wonderful to relate he had one servant who actually had a desire to lie in wait to murder him but he was an Italian  See above p xxxvii  This may be a warning to English and Irish gentlemen to be less fond of foreign servants Mr Berkeley wanting a servant at a time when few were in London a person who owed Mr Berkeley much gratitude earnestly recommended this villain Mr Berkeley objected wishing either an English or Scotchman always thinking it wrong to employ foreigners to the detriment of our own countrymen he however yielded Dr Berkeley at his return from visiting his son in town said to Mrs Berkeley  "I think your son  seems to have got a Devil in the form of a fine tall fellow"  "What does he do"  "Nothing I believe But such a pair of diabolical eyes I never saw before in my life"  Mrs Berkeley ever anxious for her idol wrote to her son who with his usual benignity replied  "The poor fellow to be sure is not handsome nor has he a very benign countenance which made my Father think him diabolical but he does every thing that I want although he is not like Ritchie or M'Nicol"  When Mr Berkeley was once ordered to the sea a day or or two before he set out accompanied by his excellent unwearied friend H Grimston Esquire he told this servant that  "as he wished to lounge and change his posture frequently and as he could not accommodate three in the chaise it being summer time he should go down on the top of the coach"  This  Signor  resented as  such  an indignity that on his arrival he utterly refused to act at all so that but for Mr Grimston's servant Mr Berkeley must have been exceedingly distressed His ill humour increasing daily Mr Berkeley at length discharged him without the least anger or reproach The sweetness of his nature never suffered his anger to rise against an inferior My superiors he used ever to say shall  feel  it if  they  treat me improperly This wretch instead of returning to London the next morning stayed the whole of the next day and when he did set off said  "He had waited all that day to murder his master  but he found it was in vain for that he kept close"  It providentially happened that Mr Berkeley's horse had picked up a nail and he could not ride into the country as was his constant custom to drink milk from the cow morning and evening neither did he go to the library or rooms that day which Mr Berkeley when mentioning it looked upon as the mercy of an allgracious overruling particular Providence in which he ever believed ever trusted and was never disappointed Mr Berkeley not having any Italian blood in his veins could form no idea of this villain's spirit of revenge He was immediately replaced by a very worthy honest Englishman Mr William Morfey for whose attentive incessant care Mr Berkeley felt himself so much indebted that some little time before his lamented death he requested of his Father and Mother  "that he might remain in their family as long as service should be agreeable to him"  although he had a competency without it  It is almost impossible to avoid relating here a little circumstance that will shew the contrast between the Englishman and the Italian For some time before Mr Berkeley's dissolution finding himself unable to fit up through the day he rose not until after the family had dined that he might enjoy the society of his friends in the afternoon He constantly dismissed his servant to eat his dinner in comfort ordering him not to hurry himself and not to return until he rang his bell One day his bell rang and Mr  Berkeley's Mother conceiving that the servant had not dined went to the top of the kitchen stairs and told the servant she would go up and see what his Master wanted and if she could not get it ring for him He replied  "No Madam I must go myself"  The housekeeper and the other servants urged him to stay saying  "You have but  one single  mouthful to finish do pray eat it Mr Berkeley is never impatient he will wait"  He replied  "  No I will not stay to eat it  "  His Mother once recommending to his care a most affectionate tenderhearted servant her old housekeeper who came into the family when Mr Berkeley was a lad to keep in his family if it pleased God to spare him to settle he lifted up his fine eyes and replied in the tenderest tone of voice  "My dearest Mother there is no occasion for  you  to recommend Mrs Marsh to  me  "  When Mr Berkeley's exquisitely fine picture presented to his Mother by his beloved friend Mr Peters arrived at Dr Berkeley's this amiablehearted woman hastened to assist at the unpacking it and on seeing it sunk motionless upon it Heartfelt gratitude forces the Writer of this Preface to celebrate the incessant unwearied attention of the two above named servants as also of the very worthy Mrs Jane Godwin who has for many years been the happy domestic of Mr Berkeley's incomparably kind generous excellent Aunt Mrs Frinsham for the delightful alacrity and unwearied assiduity with which they endeavoured incessantly to alleviate Mr Berkeley's intolerable  all but insupportable  bodily sufferings  as indeed did every other servant in the family for all which sufferings Mr Berkeley repeatedly returned hearty thanks to God frequently saying to his Mother  "I would not have been without them for all this world has to give as I am persuaded nothing short of what I have suffered could have brought  me  as I  ought  to come to Christ"  Such universal benevolence may tempt the possessor to feel less need of the atonement  It is impossible to omit here my most grateful acknowledgements to many amiablehearted persons in the inferior stations in life to whom Mr Berkeley was only known by his almost divine philanthropy and by his severe sufferingsat Hastings at Dover and at Cheltenhamwho seemed to vie with each other who should be most active in  endeavouring  to lighten the distress of a poor miserable stomach that for many months regurgitated every delicacy of every kind  Mr Berkeley frequently for days together did not retain any thing taken into his stomach for one minute which occasioned one of the most eminent Physicians to pronounce positively that the passage into the stomach was stopped and must be opened by a method known to medical gentlemen This was not the case as sometimes for two or three days successively plainly appeared Mr Berkeley was one of the most temperate of men never from the age of fifteen tasting a morsel of any food between his meals no sandwich no soup nor any thing else even if he did not dine until six o'clock and very rarely ate any supper when he dined at the oldfashioned hour of three at his Father's house  Persons are often punished in kind  "By what things a man sinneth by the same also shall he be tormented"  speaks the Scripture  Mr Berkeley never was an epicure a moment of his life frequently when the family dined out and he did not choose to accompany them Mrs Berkeley would ask him  "What she should order for his dinner"  His constant reply was  "Oh my dear Madam whatever they have in the servants' hall will do for me"  "But my dear they have not any thing yet ordered"  "Well then if it is quite convenient a neck of mutton and broth and suet dumplings and turnips"  of which he constantly ate the absolute scrag which often occasioned his mother's telling him  "However you may torment your wife if ever you marry it will not be as an epicure"  Mr Berkeley wished exceedingly to have gone to Dover immediately on his being ordered the third time to the sea that together with sea bathing he might have enjoyed the delightful society of his old his beloved his sincerely respected friends the excellent Sir Robert and Lady Laurie and their throughly amiable son and daughter but his father wished him to make choice of Hastings and Mr Berkeley was the  most  obedient of sons As the autumn advanced the want of a warm seabath obliged him to quit Hastings and he repaired to Dover accompanied by his excellent relation above named Mrs Frinsham where he received such amiable such incessant attentions from the lovely family of Laurie the angelic Mrs Firebrace and the very worthy Mrs and Miss Paynealthough it were  impossible even if possessed of the mines of Peru and Mexico to repay their kindness yet must it ever be whilst possessed of life registered in the retentive grateful memory of the Editor and may HE who rewardeth  every one according to although not for  their good works reward these amiable friends an hundred a thousand fold in TIME and through the countless ages of ETERNITY is a prayer offered  daily  at the throne of that God who  hears  and  answers  prayer as is often happily experienced by those who  believe  and  trust  HIS gracious promises revealed in the Holy Scriptures The mention of these particular kind old intimate friends of Mr Berkeley and his family does not prevent the Writer from feeling the sincerest gratitude to numberless other of the wonderfully amiable inhabitants of Dover who high and low seemed to study who should be most forward in shewing every  possible  attention to Mr Berkeley so much as frequently at this time to occasion the above named worthy domestics to say  "they never saw such delightful people as the inhabitants of Dover"  It has been repeatedly asserted many years ago by the Writer who has often bathed in the sea at Dover that the inhabitants even the very lowest ranks were certainly the most courteous people in Europe and attributed it to their vicinity to their once amiable delightfully courteous neighbours on the other side of the water The streets of Dover are narrow of course the pavement cannot be wide and so  very  attentive are they that you never see an inferior  take the wall of a superior or a charityschool child of an elder person If looking on the other side a bricklayer's labourer in a leathern apron stumble on any lady or gentleman he instantly steps off the narrow pavement with  "I ask your pardon Sir or Madam for not seeing you were coming"  Mr Berkeley's father used to say  "They remind me of the days of my youth spent in Ireland where the inferior people are most remarkably respectful to their superiors"  It would be a vain effort to attempt doing justice to Mr Berkeley's gratitude to the excellent Mr Brydges of Wootton Court and his accomplished lady at Dover at the time Mr Berkeley was there He used to exclaim  "How often have they driven over to Wootton Court to fetch me some fine fruit as if I had been only brother to both"  Fruit fit to eat indeed any fruit cannot be procured for any sum at Dover and on fruit sweetmeats and old hock did Mr Berkeley long subsist After his arrival at Cheltenham how many fervent prayers did he pour forth to the Almighty to reward the throughly amiable relations of his Mother Sir John and Lady Guise when a servant arrived loaded with the fine fruits of Highnam Court as also the amiable highly respected old friend of his Mother Mr De la Bere of Cheltenham in whose pleasing conversation Mr Berkeley much delighted during the few weeks of his life after his arrival at Cheltenham whither  he went in compliance with the wishes of his Mother to enjoy the advice of the celebrated Dr Chestern of Gloucester But alas Mr Berkeley fell a victim to duty He had for near two years before been under the hands of an hypocritical IGNORAMUS  The Editor wishes for the pen of a Johnson or a Burke to endeavour to do justice to her gratitude to that most amiable of men her respected friend William Sharp Esquire of Fulham who having as it appeared  wrenched  himself from his patients from his extensive practice has the goodness to attend to the maladies of his friends Dr Berkeley being from home for a few nights Mrs Berkeley instantly dispatched a letter to Mr Sharp conjuring him to permit her Son to wait on him she being convinced that he was in a very dangerous situation The permission was in the politest manner more than granted Mr Sharp most amiably writing to Mrs Berkeley said  "I will not give Mr Berkeley the trouble of coming to Fulham but if he will be pleased to appoint any place day and hour in town I will punctually attend"  Mr Berkeley was too well bred and felt this amiable goodness too strongly to accept it he set out for Fulham and on his arrival there sent his servant to beg to know at what hour it would be agreeable to Mr Sharp to admit him On presenting to Mr Sharp a short letter of introduction from his Mother Mr Berkeley having never before seen him good Mr Sharp politely exclaimed from Mrs Berkeley's letter  "Do all I can to rescue you from the grave Sir If I had  no  friendship for Mrs Berkeley I would certainly exert all the skill I am master of to rescue from death the finest young gentleman I ever saw"  Alas it was too late That healing art as divine Hervey says of Dr Stonhouse to which myself and so many others have been indebted failed  here  See Meditations among the Tombs  On examining Mr Berkeley Mr Sharp exclaimed  "Into the hands of what ignorant Brute can you have fallen Sir Dr Berkeley resides within thirty miles of town I did not conceive that in these days in the remotest village in England there they had not better medical aid One fortnight more and all the men in the world could not have rescued you and a most direful calamity must have inevitably come upon you"  For ever blessed be the mercy of God on the great skill of good Mr Sharp and the eminent Surgeon an  elève  of his own for fourteen years under whose care he advised Mr Berkeley to put himself that tragical  maiming  of his fine person was averted although his dear life could only be lengthened not preserved  Some years ago the late amiable pious Mrs Wadham Knatchbull having a disorder that baffled the skill of several very good Canterbury surgeons her excellent son Wyndham Knatchbull Esquire prevailed on Mr Sharp to visit her after he had retired from practice During his stay at the house of his excellent relation Dr Dering Prebendary of Canterbury he very obligingly wrote a prescription for a snuff for Mrs George Berkeley's eyes To that gentleman's great skill when in practice fifteen years before she under God owes it that after having nursed a child too long she has still through mercy one eye left to scribble her grateful acknowledgement to her kind benefactors her sympathizing friends Mrs Berkeley one morning carried the prescription herself to Dr Berkeley's respected surgeon Mr Loftie desiring him to make it up himself mentioning from whom she had it acknowledging as above that she owed to that gentleman's skill that she had still  one  eye Mr Loftie exclaimed  "Then Madam  you  know Mr Sharp"  I never in my life beheld such another man Good God with what tenderness ease and skill did he did perform the operation on Mrs Knatchbull I never never saw his equal  "Besides Madam he is as wellbred a gentleman as he is an excellent surgeon"  in whom his Father placed great  confidence His Mother saw through the wretch and what added to her anguish was that two perhaps as skilful medical men as any in England resided at the same town one of whom always attended Mr Berkeley's Mother when ill as she frequently declared to Dr Berkeley that to  the third  she would not trust the life of her Angola cat  God's ways are unsearchable but they are all well or+dered for his children who are enabled to  feel  as well as  say  "All thy ways are Mercy and Truth"  c Perhaps few situations have been more distressing than that of Mr Berkeley's Mother for many weeks Just at the time when she should have set out to attend her Son at Dover her tenderly beloved Partner was seized at Cheltenham with a most tremendous disorder that threatened almost immediate dissolution Every post brought more alarming accounts from Dover  "Dreadful post of observation  "Darker every hour"  says Dr Young when relating his own sufferings during Lady Betty's last illness Her agonies every time the postboy's horn notified his arrival may by those who have feeling hearts be more easily imagined than described and especially as they were obliged to be suppressed It however pleased the mercy of God to grant a reprievea short one alas to these two  too  dear objects Mr Berkeley languished to see once more his Mother Perhaps no Mother ever did love a Son quite so sincerely and it was supposed by those who knew him well that no man ever did love even a Mother so exceedingly as Mr Berkeley  The Holy Spirit certainly holds out the love between Mother and Son as the highest love without passion Solomon speaking of Wisdom saith  "She shall love thee more than thy Mother doth"  and David says  "I went heavily as one that mourneth for his Mother"  And again the Holy Spirit describing the  bitterest  mournings says  "It shall be as the mourning for an only Son"  That love commenced as Mrs Berkeley used to tell  her Son  "the instant she saw his dear  homely face  "  and continued unabatedalas daily increaseduntil his fine face was for ever hid from her bodily eyes by the arrival of the Plumber late on Saturday evening preceding his interment on the Sunday evening God in love in mercy  must  remove the  "idols  See the Prophet Ezekiel  "Son of Man they have set up their idols in their  heart  "  out of the hearts"  of his children  Mr Berkeley's Mother always flattered herself with the hope that as she never spoiled or improperly gratified her children and constantly corrected them according to the advice of the Wise King the Book of Proverbs being her constant directory that she did not idolize them but alas the wisest are too apt to deceive themselveshow much more then a poor weak Female  Mrs Berkeley's first care for her children was the salvation of their souls secondly the cultivation of their minds and manners next the forming their persons and lastly  the advancing her  Son  in his profession for the youngest died before he attained to nine years  When it is mentioned that attention was paid to the immortal part of Mr Berkeley even before he was born it will be easily imagined that as soon as reason began to dawn every  judicious  attention was paid to the direction of the Holy Spirit delivered by St Paul  "  Bring up your children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord  "  From the time that his Mother perceived that the allgracious Giver of every good gift was about to entrust her with the care of an immortal soul that  must  pass the countless ages of eternity either in bliss unspeakable or woe unutterable she never failed to pray daily that nothing descended from her might ever be separated from that adorable God who lived and died that man might live for ever and she trusts through free sovereign Grace and Redeeming Love to be enabled to say at the great day  "Lo here am I and the children whom thou hast graciously given me  In a letter of Mrs Berkeley's many months ago in the St James's Chronicle combating Dr Beattie's idea of not permitting children to know that there is a Supreme Being until they attain to the age of six years the Editor of the St James's Chronicle in general  very  sensible has rejected this text as TOO serious for a newspaper and has adopted a sentence of nonsense In another part he has sadly turned one period and mutilated it for fear of being TOO serious He apologizes for it in a succeeding paper  "  Almost as soon as Mr Berkeley could articulate there was discovered in him what attended him through life wonderful powers of reasoning and an incessant enquiry  "  How can these things be  "  and a sagacity that it was next to impossible to deceive which once occasioned a sensible Lady  Lady P  the beloved the bosomfriend of Mr Monck Berkeley's Mother from  very  early youth to her latest hour without any intermission any coolness over whose heavy sufferings she cannot avoid dropping a tear Friends from children both married just at the same time within a few weeks both called upon to  offer up  two beloved children Mrs Berkeley two fine sons Lady P  two lovely daughters On the death of the eldest of the two Miss Catharine P  whom Mrs Berkeley had prevailed on Lady P  to put for a couple of years under the tuition of the accomplished Mrs Beaver in Dover Street being as both these  very  old fashioned ladies thought  too young  at between sixteen and seventeen to be  introduced into life  as it is termed died very suddenly Mrs Berkeley wrote as follows to her beloved friend after her usual preface  "It is the Lord let him do what seemeth him good"  was added  "I am at a loss what to say to my dearest friend The subject is difficult for I do  really  believe you have lost  such  a daughter as no other mother in Europe has to lose"  The astonishing strength and solidity of this young lady's understanding and the exceeding beauty of her face and elegance of her form could only be exceeded by the loveliness of her temper corrected at about fourteen by herself and the exquisite obligingness and refined unaffected sweetness of her manners Some years after Lady P  lost another lovely daughter but  she  had still a lovely one remaining together with a most excellent son and a worthy husband to soothe  her  sufferings under the total loss of the use of her limbs all which she bore with true Christian resignation It was somewhat remarkable that from her age of eighteen she had always told the Editor that she was very certain that God would some time or other in mercy punish her by taking away the use of her limbs adding  "I know he  must  do it in  love  to my soul"  then assigning the reason Thou art now in bliss thou beloved friend  mother of many fine children to say  "Of what  can that little creature's brain be formed for I never heard any child ask such very extraordinary questions not even at double his age"  Mr Berkeley was early a great sceptic which alarmed his Mother the less as she felt it was hereditary and she pursued the same plan which her eminently pious and wise Mother had so happily used towards herself and her endeavours to direct and settle that dangerous tendency of mind were so happily blessed that from the early age of fifteen Mr Berkeley was a most zealous ardent stickler for the coequal coeternal Godhead of his adored Redeemer and of the Holy Spirit with the Father A most respectable and worthy friend of his early youth in a letter to his Mother on the death of his beloved friend says  "How often have I heard him in company  battling  for the  honour  of his Saviour and silencing his Deistical acquaintance and friends"  He had many friends whom he earnestly wished to lead out of their infidel  darkness  into the glorious sunshine of the Gospel of Christseveral of the great Geniuses of this day  Mr Berkeley at one time very  earnestly  solicited his Father's permission to recommend a  cottage ornée  in the neighbourhood of Cookham to a friend of his a man of large fortune and deserved fame in the literary world for a summer residence saying  "I have no doubt but he would be convinced by your arguments"  To which Dr Berkeley replied  "I am sure if he has not been convinced by  yours  who are his friend he will not be convinced by mine"  On Mrs Berkeley's joining in her Son's supplications Dr Berkeley rather angrily replied  "  No no he shall not  bring down any of his Deistical friends to  stink  in my nose he shall  not  come It is not that they  do  not but that they  will  not believe the record that God has given of his Son"  So it was of course given up  who may perhaps affect to  laugh or scoff at this although they know it to be true and that Mr Berkeley did not wait to believe in the Saviour of the world until driven to him by sickness or the terrors of death  Mrs Berkeley when her children were young and during their being under their Father's roof whilst at the King's School at Canterbury devoted her mornings primarily to them never admitting any morning visitor which occasioned the sensible the witty Lady  an old intimate school friend of hers frequently to say  "I wish those two nasty little brats were dead out of the way then your friends might enjoy a little of your company"  The jocular wish alas is realized That amiable friend was very partial to them perpetually fetching them to children's cardparties at her hospitable mansion Mr Berkeley when a man used frequently to say  "I love Lady  for her goodness to me when I was a boy"  Her benevolence was so well known that all who did not wish to drown puppies and kittens  As dogs and cats produce their young so frequently and so plentifully is it not reasonable to suppose that the bounteous Giver of every good gift meant these cheaply fed domestic animals for food for man and not to be soused at nine days old into a horsepond to corrupt the water for the poor horses and cows We learn from high authority  "  That God made nothing in vain  "  These poor animals as we treat them seem made  worse  than in vain We read in Mr Forster's account of Captain Cook's first voyage that the life of that very worthy amiable man was supposed to be saved by Mr Forster's sacrificing his favourite dog for his food when very ill and it is well known that half London who choose to eat  tame  rabbits certainly eat cats It is a prejudice which perhaps like  most  other prejudices it would be wisdom to give up The county of Fife in some parts abounds with the finest rabbits yet the poorest labourer will not eat one although starving calling them  carrion  they kill them sell their skins and throw the body to the  smiddie  their elegant word for our gross one of  dunghill    we  are rather a coarse people the French call that necessary heap  un fumée  Many of the lower people of Scotland will not touch a silver eel terming watersnakes When the late Bishop Berkeley went in the year to reside in the palace at Cloyne none of the poor Irish would eat of some very fine fish in great plenty there I think the Jean d'orée but after some time they said  "that if my Lord ate it it could not  harm  them"  used in the  evening to convey them into her garden Mrs Berkeley used to tell her that  "she would advise some poor Clergyman to pack up a child or two in a basket and lay it at her hall door"  Lady  used to reply  "I declare if ever there is a child found in the garden I will send it to you to keep"  The generosity of this Lady needs no eulogium from the pen of an old friend  Mr Berkeley determined to attempt complying with the earnest request of his Mother took an affectionate a grateful  last  farewell of all his amiable friends and obliging neighbours at Dover including the throughly respectable  and pious Rev Mr Lyon and his tenderhearted amiable apothecary Mr Hanham who did not conceive that Mr Berkeley had sufficient strength remaining to reach Canterbury alive but the divine tenderness of nature which shewed itself at the age of three years  When about that age one Wednesday the family all coming out of church a beggar applied to her Father for relief saying  "that a scaffold breaking at Colonel Tyrrel's at Shottover House two men had been killedhis arm was so shattered that it had been cut off just at the elbowthat it was then mortified and he was going to the hospital to have it taken off above the elbow"  Mr Frinsham an excellent surgeon to his poor neighbours insisted on looking at it and turning to his footman bid him assist the man to take off his coat After much apparatus removed there appeared a lily white hand Hereupon Mr Frinsham exclaimed  "Thou villain I will commit you to Bridewell directly William to his servant go call the constable"  who lived at the parsonage close byout came the constabledown fell the  restored  cripple on his knees on the pitched walk This lovely little creature flew to her Father and clinging round him said  "Oh my dear Papa forgive the poor man he will cut his knees  he will indeed  "  Then falling upon her knees and embracing her Father's she wept and shrieked so violently that fearing she would be deprived of her reason the vile impostor was dismissed unpunished The same sweet spirit has attended her through life a blessing to the poor and needy a constant source of suffering to herself The wretch confessed that his hand had been thus muffled up for the last fourteen years he appeared to common spectators to have really but half an arm The coat sleeve was smeared all over with medicine and the hand confined in the leathern case of a duodecimo Bible  in his angelic relation Mrs Frinsham and has actuated her through life determined that excellent friend who alone could attempt it not to dissuade him from his purpose Accompanied by that Lady and the three above named worthy affectionate  attendants Mr Berkeley set out and with difficulty reached Canterbury where he saw some of his old friends the very learned Mr Todd and some others and in the evening sent for Mr Wrightson now master of the workhouse of the sixteen parishes of that cityhappy indeed do both high and low express themselves in so worthy so mild so able a governor  The learned and accomplished Mr M  of Cookham used when obligingly advising Mr Berkeley at the age of seventeen to say  "Well if you will not attend to me I will speak to Mr John and he will make you do it immediately"  Mr Berkeley used to redden and say  "HE make me do it How so"  "Why my dear Berkeley I had not been intimate with your family six weeks before I saw that he governed the  whole  family"  "The  whole  family How so"  "Why when Dr or Mrs Berkeley say 'Berkeley I would advise you to do so or so' you instantly reply 'Yes Sir or Madam but I must first hear what John says' Then on some other subject Dr Berkeley turns to Mrs Berkeley and says 'My dear you will speak to John  Highly as Mr Berkeley thought of John he is one instance thought more highly of his own eloquence Sometimes Mr Berkeley's fine hunter was not thought sufficiently recovered from the fatigues of the preceding hunt and only one horse in the place was capable of flying over hedge and ditch  "  burn and brake  "  the property of a most worthy old blacksmith of the name of Peirce Mr Berkeley used to send his own young man now through the mercy of God with Christ  "give my service to Peirce and desire he will hire me his horse to hunt tomorrow"    "Master Peirce's duty to you Sir and he is very sorry but he thinks he shall want him himself"  Off sets Mr Berkeley to the gardener who lives at Maidenhead a man of very uncommonly strong understanding much better improved in youth by a kind relation than is usual in that rank of life and who would have educated him a scholar but for the avarice of his Mother who said  "John has had  larning  enough and "he must now set about  arning  "  ie  earningalways a most respectful domestic Down goes the spade or waterpotoff goes the gardener with the message a little strengthened  "His Humble duty to you and he is very sorry but I cannot spare his horse tomorrow"    "John pray now do you go to old Peirce and tell him what distress I am in and I am sure he will lend me his horse I will give whatever he desires for him"  Off goes Johnreturns with as little success as the others Off sets Mr Berkeley and soon returns in triumph with  "Aye there is nothing like doing one's own business Here have I sent Robert Gardener John all in vain and I prevailed upon the old man in two minutes He said 'Lord bless you Sir why you  must  have him I think and I must go to Reading on Thursday"  The fact was Mr Berkeley's manners were so uncommonly sweet and winning particularly to his inferiors where as his mother used to tell him the  "noble blood of the Berkeleys"  could not be put in motion that he could like his Grandfather the Bishop as Mr Dalton used always to say of his beloved respected friend he could persuade every body to any thing that he pleased Some time after this honest man opened a grocer's shop Mr Berkeley conjured his Mother to lay out some money with him adding  "I really feel myself under great obligations to the honest old man"  On Mr Berkeley's return to Cookham several years after finding his old friend Peirce dead he put his little orphan boy to school  and hear what he  says' when Mrs Berkeley replies 'Yes I have talked to him already about it' Now is it not evident that what I say is fact"  This gentleman did not mean that Dr Berkeley consulted his excellent old servant on his Sermons or Mrs Berkeley on her Letters although she had  taught him the alphabet he coming very early into Dr Berkeley's family and living in it very near thirty years during which long period he never returned a saucy answer nor uttered a pert sentence or grumble when shutting the door Notwithstanding he was when Mrs Berkeley was not present the  only  governor of Mr Monck Berkeley yet he never forgot that he was the son of his Master but always treated him with the respect due from one in an humbler station  "Sir you  must not  you  shall not  do that What would my Mistress say if she should come into the stableyard now"  Mr Wrightson was many years coachman to Dr Berkeley before he became his butler A stronger proof that persons is an humble station may be thoroughly respectable and respected cannot be adduced than in Mr Berkeley's little brother when about seven years old sitting very disconsolately the cause being enquired he replied  "Why I have been naughty and John will not be friends with me"  Mrs Berkeley his grandmother being in the room replied  "Oh never mind that if he won't but go away to play"  "Never mind it indeed Why if  all  the world were friends with and  John was not  I could never be happy"  Mr Wrightson's powers for governing well it may be presumed are not impaired as the little  boys  in Canterbury workhouse of which he is now master are made so industrious at  eight  years old as to earn money sufficient to  receive a poundage of threepence every week for themselves to spend as they please in little innocent trifles A wise encouragement this and it must be wished by every humane person that it was practised in  every  workhouse and poorhouse throughout the three kingdoms At Cookham in Berkshire where they are remarkably kind to the poor in the workhouse and most shamefully hard and cruel to those who  strive  to keep themselves out of it the lacemaking women and girls and others have two pence out of every shilling they earn and permission to work for their own profit after a certain hour in the evening This is comforting the hearts of the poor enabling them to procure a little tea tobacco and snuff which cannot be provided otherwise Dr Berkeley has often had his wonderfully fine tender feelings soothed when visiting sick persons in the workhouse saying on his return home  "Well it is a delight to one's spirit to see those poor people in sheets as white though not as fine as one's own and every comfort that human aid can render"  Tea wine c were always allowed to the sick if the apothecary said it was necessary The very worthy Mrs Lane was then mistress with a handsome salary She lived many years in the family of the late Lord Aylesford Servants who have lived in genteel families are the  only proper  conductors of workhouses A butler of the late worthy General Onslow of Cookham was her predecessor A  broken  tradesman  who perhaps knows little but how to give  short measure  and light weight and eat the best of every thing till he breaks is tyrannical and cruel  "  laying his weight heavily on the aged and not pitying children  "  as speaks the Holy Scripture  The aid of the very learned very skilful Dr Packe had been procured by Mrs Berkeley who in a letter sent to him by her had desired him to visit Mr Berkeley at Dover which he did and saw him again at Canterbury on his journey It was supposed by all who did see him that Mr Berkeley would hardly reach Sittingbourn alive and he was supposed once to be dead yet it pleased that allgracious God whose mercies are no fewer than infinite to his faithful however unworthy servants to conduct Mr Berkeley to Cheltenham where his family had been for some months unable to get to him on account of his Father's lamentable state of health as above mentioned Mr Berkeley after reposing part of a day and a night at the palace of those prodigies of KENTISH innkeepers Mr and Mrs Simpson at the Rose at Sittingbournindeed they might with truth be compared with the Marches at Maidenhead Bridge the Red Lion Henley and most of the great innkeepers on the Northern Road whose accommodations obliging assiduities and reasonable charges deserve to be celebrated  Mr Berkeley by slow journeys reached the metropolis where he rested two or three days and collected all those few friends who happened to be in town at that season when London is usually most empty the beginning of December He exhibited himself as a man dying in the very prime of life and besought them to  "  remember their Creator before the evil days come on  "  and to fly from temptation He afterwards proceeded to his Father's house at Cookham in the garden of which he ever delighted so much particularly in the Southcote Walk leading to the Thames as often to say to his Mother who admired it at least as much as her Son  "Well if I was Lord Chancellor and could not get the vicar's garden at Cookham I should be perpetually breaking the tenth commandment"  Mrs Berkeley had written to  her  apothecary the very sensible and skilful Mr Falwasser of Maidenhead to desire him to meet Mr Berkeley at Cookham and endeavour to administer something to alleviate his sufferings during his journey at least After a short rest at Cookham he left his beloved relation Mrs Frinsham so exhausted with tender anxiety as to be unable then to prosecute her journey to Cheltenham He proceeded with his attentive servant to Oxford whither he had written to his bedmaker and kind attentive nurse in a severe stage of his near five  years' illness Mrs Leycester  Some time after Mr Monck Berkeley's death the family passing through Oxford this very worthy grateful woman came to Mrs Berkeley with a small box under her arm saying  "that she knew not what it contained but that whenever Mr Berkeley quitted Oxford for any length of time he constantly gave it her with a strict charge to lock it up carefully and never whilst he was living to deliver it into any hand but his own in case of his death to his Mother"  It contained some very curious letters from some of his intimate friends one very curious one from R  M  Esquire the contents of which still remain known only to the Editor two or three rings and coins  souvenirs  of departed friends a curious purse containing several strips cut out of newspapers on examination they were found to be accounts of the deaths of various friends thus preserved as mementos from the time that he was a schoolboy and a card quite yellowed by time containing the lines not at last rightly quoted by Mr S  in his Anecdotes from Aaron Hill's fine tragedy which Dr Johnson said  "merited to be written in letters of gold"  and which Mrs Berkeley had caused her son to get by heart as soon as they were commented upon in Davies's Life of David Garrick Esquire  "Oh Leoline as obstinately just" c  While Mr Berkeley was at Eton his Mother said to him  "I hope you have not forgotten the delightful lines of Aaron Hill"  He instantly repeated them adding  "I wish you would be so good as to write them out for me on a card"  "Why so you remember them perfectly"  "Yes so I do and hope never to forget them But I think if I saw them now and then in what he politely termed your beautiful hand they would make a  deeper  impression on my mind"  The request was of course complied with and on the reverse of the card two important texts of Scripture written The card written about fourteen years before was found deposited in this box  to procure him a lodging as near the Hall as she could as Mr Berkeley the Hall being full was obliged when more than four years standing in the University to relinquish his rooms to admit younger members  It is impossible to omit relating here a most pleasing grateful attention of a much younger gentleman than Mr Berkeley over whom Mr Berkeley had most kindly and wisely watched in order to prevent his forming as youths of sixteen seventeen or eighteen are too apt to do improper intimacies and connections the worthy very amiablehearted William Browne Esquire Gentlemancommoner of Magdalen Hall now the very worthy rector of Horton near Windsor That parish was once so happy as to have the excellent Mr Romaine for curate This amiablehearted young gentleman  Mr Browne was one of several gentlemen who although in distant parts of the kingdom as if by consent put themselves into brother's mourning for their beloved lamented friend  hearing from his bedmaker Mrs Leycester that Mr Berkeley was coming to Oxford bid her take no thought about a lodging for that in Mr Berkeley's infirm state of health it must be more agreeable to him to be in his own old rooms which Mr Browne had desired the Principal to let him exchange for his when Mr Berkeley was obliged to quit them immediately took a lodging for himself and directed Mrs Leycester and the worthy Mr William Wells  This young man was an orphan and attended the hall with fruit c Mr Berkeley's piercing eye soon descried that shirts would add to his comfort He soon appeared in the hall thus equipped One of the gentlemen of the hall said to him  "Why Will you have got a nice new shirt But Will it is not complete those who gave you the shirt should have treated you with ruffles to it"  "No Sir replied Will they had too much good sense to do that It would ill become any one to wear  ruffles  on a shirt that was given to them in  charity  "  The wisdom of Will was at least as much admired as the wit of the gentleman Some time after Mr Berkeley's death his Mother on seeing this honest worthy young man observed to him  "Mr William you have lost a kind friend"  He burst into tears and could scarcely articulate  "That I have indeed Madam Can I do any thing to serve you"  The gratitude of the worthy Mrs Leycester is great for some essential services rendered her by Mr Berkeley during his residence at the hall    one of the scouts as the college servants are termed at Oxford an early  protegé  of Mr Berkeley to prepare the rooms for his reception and collected a number of Mr Berkeley's old friends to spend the evening with him and of course their beloved and respected tutor the Reverned Mr Green the viceprincipal on account of whose great learning and strict attention to his pupils Dr Berkeley had recommended it to his son to enter at Magdalene Hall rather than at his own beloved Christ Church or under his old excellent friend the angelichearted Bishop of Norwich under whose roof and in whose chearful gay society and that of his worthy Lady and beautiful daughters Mr Berkeley passed many happy hours of his Oxford life the delightfully amiable Bishop always considering the Son of his oldest friend as to use the French term  enfant de famille  That throughly angelic Prelate would frequently relate little anecdotes of Mr Berkeley's gay lively wit with greater pleasure than a parent might venture to do without being suspected of too great partiality The writer of this Preface cannot dismiss this beloved respected character  of her incomparable old friend without saying what the same pen wrote when the Church of England lost this bright mild star and the church of Scotland his counterpart That Bishop Horne and the Reverend Dr Gillespie late Principal of the Divinity College in the University of St Andrew  "could be very little more angelical now with worshiping at the throne of GLORY than when on earth supplicating at the throne of GRACE"  Two more lovely mild benign sweet spirits have not perhaps since the days of Moses the meekest of meer men been permitted to shine in this dark world for more than threescore years before they took their flight to join their kindred spirits and may the Writer of these pages through Redeeming Love be admitted in God's appointed time to rejoin those sweet spirits whose society was so exhilarating here Both were remarkably cheerful agreeable companions both had perhaps attended to that line of Dr Young  "'Tis impious in a good man to be sad"  and to a still higher than Dr Young St Paul  "  Rejoice alwayand again I say rejoice  "  Could gloomy pious persons possibly conceive the injury that they do to the Religion of our divine  Redeemer  who repeatedly asserts  "  My  yoke is  easy  and  my  burden  light  "  they would not always as if like Manasseh they were dragging about fetters of brass or rather lead for brass would shine too much for such illjudging gloomy spirits  "As if religion the religion of the blessed Jesus ever was intended  "To make our joys less"  Alas no It is a  slight  knowledge of Christ that sheds the gloom  "ACQUAINT thyself with God"  says holy Job  "and be at peace"  It is one thing to get a slight view of any eminently wise person in a croud and another to ACQUAINT ourselves thoroughly with them if permitted so to do and all are invited  "Come unto  me  all ye that are weary and heavy laden and  I  will refresh you"  After passing a couple of days at Oxford to rest and bid a  last  adieu to his friends in that beloved place he proceeded by easy journeys toward Cheltenham He was met on the road by his Father Mother and his Father's cousingerman the generous amiable and compassionate Mrs D Monck too well known in the polite circles of London and Bath for her polite attentions elegant hospitality and unbounded generosity to her relations her friends and the poor to need an enumeration here To attempt to do justice to her exquisitely kind amiable unwearied attentions to Mr Berkeley during the last six weeks of his life spent at Cheltenham or his and his Parents gratitude to that extraordinary Lady is a task not to be executed perhaps by  any  pen much less by one so very imbecile Suffice it therefore to say May God reward in  TIME and through ETERNITY what Mr Berkeley termed Mrs Monck's  "divine attentions"  to him Amen  Mr Berkeley's strength daily decreasing as it had done for many months he never walked out but twice at Cheltenham once to look at the beautiful church  With a handsome painting of  that  church the eyes of the Editor are daily delighted for which she is indebted to the elegant pencil of her very highly accomplished sensible amiable young friend Miss Hamilton one of the daughters of Lord Archibald Hamilton who although so very distant in point of years honoured the Editor by seeking her acquaintancean  honour  but very rarely  granted  by the Editor to  young  ladies of any rank When young herself she had only two young friends Lady P  and Mrs D W  all her other intimate friends and correspondents were ten some fifteen years older than herself  Little  she  used  to think was to be learned from girls of her own age  forty  years ago much less alas now unless it be to go without cloathing in these hard times and so save a little money Mr Monck Berkeley used to say  "it was  a mercy  that God did not spare the life of his little sister that if he had both his Mother and self should certainly have  ended their days  at  Tyburn  for had she as many lives as a cat is said to have we should both have killed her  nine  times if she had behaved as the generality of girls of fashion do now"  He always named  some  as exceptions He had not the honour the pleasure to be acquainted with Miss Hamiltons  where he felt his mortal remains would soon be deposited in hope of a joyful resurrection to immortal life which he humbly hoped through CHRIST JESUS HIS SAVIOUR  Curiosity perhaps may have led many to run their eye for want of something else to do over this short indigested sketch of the short life of a young Man of whom it cannot  be said there is nothing remarkable in it for were the account of Mr Berkeley's life methodically written by a learned accurate pen perhaps few lives of double the length of his could furnish more curious matter The number of astonishing hairbreadth escapes of life in his very early childhood used to occasion his Mother to express her fears that he would resemble Pope Sixtus Quintus or the celebrated unfortunate Wortley Montague Esquire both of whom it is well known were incessantly in perils and escaped most wonderfully A very worthy woman that waited on Lady Mary Wortley Montague when he was born and many years afterwards in her advanced age lived with an intimate friend of Mrs Berkeley's Mother when Mrs Berkeley was a girl and was by her frequently entertained with the wonderful exploits of  Master  Montague and those of  Master  Berkeley were in many instances so similar as to cause the supremest vigilance in Mrs Berkeley Her younger son although a wonderfully lively alert child never had any danger to encounter never had any  known  escape from danger which occasioned Mr Berkeley's frequent dangers and escapes to be the more noticed by the whole family The spirit of one  "  returned early to God who gave it  "  the other was appointed to travel longer through the thorny wilderness of this world  A certain description of readers are now about to be addressed in the words of that noblest of poets Dr Young in his second Night  "Fly ye profane if not draw near with awe  "Receive the blessing and adore the chance  "That threw in this  Bethesda  your disease  "If unrestor'd by this despair your cure  "For  here  resistless demonstration dwells  "A deathbed 's a detector of the heart  "Here tir'd  dissimulation  drops her mask  The late very sensible learned accomplished grateful Dr Beauvoir head master of Canterbury school used always to say  "I do deny that position of Dr Young's it only makes them fit it on the closer"  Dreadful idea If it does so what must be their lot through the countless ages of ETERNITY Had he lived until  this time  he might have seen SOME who drop it before they lie stretched on their death bed A mask is a very troublesome thing to fit on  nicely  in youth when one may be allowed to attend a little to dress The Editor was perhaps too proud ever to wear one for a moment which frequently occasioned her beloved partner's often saying to Mr Monck Berkeley  "  Your  Mother is  too  honest for  this world  "  Her constant reply  "Well she cannot be too honest for the  next  "    "Through life's grimace that mistress of the scene  Mr Berkeley from very early youth resembled his Mother in always exhibiting his faults rather than his virtues frequently saying  "God make me better than I am but I hope he will always give me grace  never  to  appear  better than I really am"  The Editor's Mother whom God in mercy spared until she was turned of twenty used to say  "My dear child you will never get a husband you hold yourself up as a dragon men like quiet wives"  The Editor always cautioned her son and all his young friends against a  fine soft gentle  MEEKLINGthe usual mask to conceal the most violent temper There are to be sure A FEW female Moses's but these are very rare A beloved friend of the Editor's Mrs C  one day when two sisters were spoken of said to her  "The  men  like F  better than K  because she is too lazy to put herself in a passion but she is never with all that  apparent  meekness half an hour in a week"  Mr Berkeley used to say  "I hope if ever I should persuade any lady to marry me that she will not apply to my MOTHER for my character for she will certainly tell her  every  fault I have as she told my Father beforehand all her own faults as she has often told us"  All declared it  little  likely Mrs Berkeley should be  so  applied to by any lady    "  Here  real and apparent are the same  "You see the man you see his hold on heaven  "Heaven waits not the last moment own her friends  "On this side death and points them out to men  "A lecture silent but of sov'reign power"  When it is mentioned that Mr Berkeley's Mother ever anxious for the salvation of her children had never failed from the moment they had life  "to pray that God would vouchsafe to make her the MOTHER of their souls"  it will be easily believed that this anxiety did not  decrease  on the letters she perpetually received from her excellent friends Lady Laurie and Mrs Frinsham from Dover of the declining state of Mr Berkeley's health and dreading lest she might never have an opportunity of conversing with him on earth she repeatedly wrote to conjure them to procure for Mr Berkeley's perusal a small volume that she persuaded herself would pour balm into his humble contrite spirit These excellent Ladies incessantly procuring comforts for his agonized stomach and well knowing how constantly and how frequently Mr Berkeley redde and studied  the Book of Books as good Bishop Ridley at the stake termed the Book of God omitted to comply with Mrs Berkeley's request they  then  never having perused that exquisite little volume which Mr Berkeley's Mother on finishing and closing it almost involuntarily exclaimed  "My God I desire to praise thy mercy that thou hast permitted me to live to read this incomparable little book"  It expounds some parts of Scripture differently from what many modern Divines of the Church of England understand them although perfectly consonant to the Articles of the Church of England and written by one of her brightest ornaments who may be termed as the evangelical Bishop Hall used to style his seraphic friend the Honourable Robert Boyle  "  a Lay Bishop  "  Mrs Berkeley knowing that her Son dreaded any thing that  he  conceived might open a door to licentiousness and she equally dreading any thing that might lead him to despair of God's mercy through Christ to all true penitents for some days forbore to produce this invaluable little volume One morning after breakfast sitting in Mr Berkeley's room he said  "My dear Madam I wish you would be so good as to read to me  Mrs Berkeley  "What shall I read my dear  Mr B  "Something good  Mrs B  "Shall I read in the Bible  Mr B  "No Morsey has just been reading that to me  Mrs B  "What then my dear do you choose  Mr B  "Why pray read to me some of  your own  books"  By  your own  books Mr Berkeley meant either Romaine or Hervey c Mrs Berkeley then drew the little volume out of her pocket and began she had not redde far before Mr Berkeley put back his curtain and said  "Pray my dear Madam whose book is that  Mrs B  "It is mine my dear  Mr B  "Yes yes I know that  you know  what I mean who is the writer  Mrs B  "Why do you ask my dear Do you like it  Mr B  "Yes most exceedingly Pray tell me  who  is the author  Mrs B  "Why my dear it is written by my excellent old friend Sir Richard Hill"  He then exclaimed  "Oh best of Mothers do not make an Antinomian of your  poor  Son  for if you do he is lost for ever  Mrs B  "My dear child Sir Richard Hill is no more an Antinomian than  your  Mother and  you  have long  known  her  horror of that dreadful doctrine of DEVILS As I have always told you till a certain text can be expunged from Scripture no  real  Christian can become an Antinomian 'Without HOLINESS no man shall see the Lord'  Mr B  "Pray proceed"  On the Monday he requested Mrs Berkeley to read out of it again and one day asking her to read to him she replied  "My dear I have just laid it out of my pocket on the table in my own room"  He replied  "  But  best of Mothers you  can  have the goodness to go and fetch it"  which request was of course instantly complied with He frequently exclaimed  "It is a wonderful book surely"  The title"The Deep Things of GOD or Milk and Strong Meat  Mrs Berkeley every day immediately on quitting her Son's room wrote under many of the numbers Mr Berkeley's comments upon them She has had that incomparable identical book most elegantly bound gilt c and poor as she is would not take five hundred pounds for it If it may be permitted us to compare small things with great that excellent kind unwearied friend one of the trustees to Mrs Berkeley's marriage settlement is now perpetually labouring to assist his old friend in her worldly concerns her multiplicity of  ugly  businesses as he was to assist her angelic son with his spiritual aid  "  About ten days before his lamented death his Mother sitting in her usual place close to his pillow he thus addressed her  "My dear Madam I have a favour to beg of you Pray promise me that you will grant it"  "My dear child you  know  that if it is any thing in  my  power  you may command it"  "It is that you will promise me faithfully to send a copy of this book over to Ireland for it is a book of a  very  extraordinary nature  indeed  the most wonderfull book  surely  that ever was written by man uninspired and God knows they lamentably want it in that poor country as well as in this"  Mrs Berkeley enquired to whom he wished her to send it He mentioned a particular old friend of his Father for whom Mr Berkeley had a very great and unfeigned regard Mrs Berkeley promised him that if it pleased God to spare her life she certainly would send it without fail  The evening immediately preceding Mr Berkeley's happy departure as Mrs Berkeley was sitting by his bed side he fell into a sweet sleep A servant came to announce to her that tea was made She went silently out of the room In a few minutes he awoke and enquired of his servant  "Where is my Mother"  "Just gone down to tea Sir"  "Go down and give my duty to her and say that when she has  quite  done drinking her tea I beg to speak with her"  Mrs Berkeley instantly obeyed the summons he kindly reproached her for having come so quickly saying  "He feared she had not taken her tea which he knew was her favourite refreshment in comfort"  On being assured that she had done he began  "My dearest Mother I beg that you will have the goodness to promise me  solemnly  that you will send that excellent  book over to Ireland"  "My dear I did promise you about a fortnight ago that I would certainly send it if I lived Did I ever in my life from your infancy break any promise good or bad that I made to you or to your dear brother"  "No never I believe in your whole life"  But I thought perhaps that you might  "promise me as a dy  "  He was going to say it is supposed  "as a dying man"  He stopped short thinking it would too tenderly affect his almost brokenhearted Mother and proceeded to say to pacify me and make me easy again repeating  "It is a most  extraordinary  WONDERFUL book surely"  Mr Berkeley might most  happily  term it such for it was that  alone  by the mercy of God that  could  that  did  enable him to triumph over the KING of TERRORS  Mrs Frinsham used frequently when visiting at Dr Berkeley's to say to her sister  "I am surprized your children are ever terrified you promise them a whipping or a  starving  so she termed a dinner of potatoes and water for it injures children's stomachs to fast entirely or go to bed supperless in so very good humoured a voice that I wonder they ever believe you"  Mrs Berkeley used to assure her that there was no need of uttering the promise in the tone of a fishwoman as they  well  knew whatever the  voice  was the  threat  would  infallibly  be executed  A curious little anecdote of Mr Berkeley's early entering into characters occurred when he was just turned six years old One day Mrs Frinsham and Dr Berkeley going down the Southcote Walk he gallopped by them whipping his horse a fine long stick saying  "Miss Frinsham I am to dine upon bread and water today"  His two relatives both made up of tenderness lamentably exclaimed  "Oh I hope not go and beg pardon"  "Oh that won't do"  To which his Father replied  "Oh my dear go and try to coax your Mamma"  With a look of ineffable scorn he replied  "Oh my dear Sir  you  don't know MY Mamma When  once  she has said imitating the exact tone  Always as slow as a sentence could be uttered and with all the solemnity of an excellent judge on the bench  in which the threat was denounced  Berkeley you shall dine to day upon bread and water  if the KING was to come and go down upon  both  his knees  Doctor and Mrs Berkeley being very oldfashioned persons in some things their children constantly asking their parents blessing every morning and night were never suffered to kneel on both knees Mrs Berkeley's father never suffering her to do it always saying  "Never fall on both your knees but to your Father in Heaven He is King of kingsLord of lords You cannot humble yourselves enough to him"  Asking a parent's blessing is now quite obsolete The Editor has very frequently seen her old hereditary friend the agreeable learned Author of "CHRISTIANITY NOT FOUNDED ON ARGUMENT" alas for him poor man on his arrival from his own seat in Surrey at his pious mother's house in Berks constantly drop on his knee previously to his taking notice of any one before his mother's chair she was lame saying  "Madam I beg your blessing"  This it must be known was out of respect to herMr Berkeley that he might obtain a Parent's intercession with GOD  to her she would not pardon me My Mamma is  not like youwhen I am naughty take and give me a good hearty shake or two and scold me for a minute or two and then forget it directly"  The idea of his Majesty's intercession being vain was a lucky one or perhaps as his Majesty in hunting frequently passed through Dr Berkeley's grounds this extraordinary little genius might have thrown himself in his way He had been told that nobody must ever turn their backs on the King When about five years old walking one evening with his Mother and Miss Leigh a relation of hers in Kensington gardens he on a sudden began walking backwards presently saying  "Dear ladies why do you not walk backwards"  Some gentleman passed whom  he  supposed to be his Majesty whom he had then never seen But to return  Mr Berkeley felt that he had broken God's Law had fallen into temptation and considering that he had received a thoroughly pious education as he used to tell his consoling Mother when she repeatedly applied to his broken contrite spirit that glorious promise  "Though your  sins  be as  scarlet  "  c and that infinitely gracious one of our eternal coequal Saviour God  "Him that cometh unto me I will in  no wise  cast outCome unto me ALL ye that are weary and heavy  laden and I will refresh you"  "Alas my dear Mother I have been a more grievous sinner than others because I have had a more pious education than most persons"  But blessed for ever blessed be the astonishing Love of God the COMFORTER this blessed little book poured the balm of perfect peace of joy into his lovely wounded spirit and he wished others to be consoled by it  One morning after all fear of vengeance on account of the broken Law of God was quite done away by HIS mercy  "who is MIGHTY to save"  and  "who trod the winepress ALONE"  Mrs Berkeley going into the room as was her custom enquired if he had passed a tolerable night His reply was  "I have had great pain and have not closed my eyes one minute since I saw you but I have been in heaven blessed be the MERCY of GOD"  A few mornings afterwards the same anxious enquiry was answered in the very same words with this addition  "Surely my dearest Mother it is not an illusion of my GRAND ENEMY to lull me into security"  So watchful was he against deceiving himself especially in the concerns of his soul to which his Mother earnestly replied  "No my dear child NO That God whom you have laboured so zealously so faithfully to serve although he has permitted you to  fall  to shew you your own frailty yet he will never suffer the Enemy of Souls to delude you Besides my dearest creature what  can  the Devil hope to gain by you  in your present helpless languishing state unless he could tempt you to blaspheme or despair as you lie stretched on a bed of languishing And blessed be the free grace of God he has never yet been able to do either the one or the other No my dear Son God has vouchsafed in infinite mercy to lift up the light of his reconciled countenance upon you to answer the constant fervent prayers of your poor unworthy Mother and your own on  this  side the grave"  At two three or four nights distance Mr Berkeley had two or three more such blessed nights for which wonderfully gracious vouchsafement all glory be to FREE SOVEREIGN GRACE and REDEEMING LOVE  The day before Mr Berkeley's death he discovered by what Dr Berkeley happened to drop that Mrs Berkeley had sat up the whole of the preceding night in the next room His eyes flashed with indignation and he instantly spoke to her concerning it As Mrs Berkeley never in the polite intercourse of life suffers herself to falsify  A lady one day requested Mrs Berkeley to make a very fine  madeup  speech of excuse for her to some other lady to which Mrs Berkeley said  "Would it not Madam be better to tell the truth and say that really a multiplicity of engagements have rendered it inconvenient for you to go so far"  Mr Monck Berkeley happening to be present remarked  "How little that good lady knows MY Mother why She will not tell a  civil  lye for my Father or myself Her idea is that many  obliging polite kind friendly  things may be said without sacrificing TRUTH"  The worthy amiable Mrs Waller sister of the Archdeacon of Essex the friend of Mrs Berkeley from eight years old always says  "There is a real pleasure in hearing a polite thing from Mrs Berkeley "for you may  swear  it comes from her heart"  she was obliged at  last to confess that she had reposed on the sopha in the drawingroom He earnestly exclaimed  "Good God  so my dear Mother is to kill herself for me  that is at last to be the end of  her  "  And turning to his Father he said  "Ah my dear Sir  why  would you  suffer  it"  Dr Berkeley replied  "My dear child your Mother would have been wretched if I had interposed"  He then extorted a solemn promise from his Mother that she would go to rest that night amiably adding  "and promise that you will undress and go into bed or I will not attempt to close my eyes all night"  Mrs Berkeley retired with a strict injunction to Dr Berkeley's and Mr Berkeley's own servant both of whom attended him with wonderful assiduity alternately lying in a tentbed in Mr Berkeley's room and sitting up with him that she would never forgive them if they perceived the least change in Mr Berkeley and did not instantly call her up  On the morning of January Mr Berkeley's servant knocked at the chamberdoor saying  "that he came with his Master's duty and desired Dr Berkeley would go down and pray with him"  Dr Berkeley instantly arose and went down Just as Mrs Berkeley had put on some  of her cloaths Dr Berkeley returned announcing  "the heavy tidings"  that they had lost their  earthly  treasure Mrs Berkeley although having ever earnestly wished and prayed to witness the last moments of all those beloved relations she is doomed to survive submitted in she humbly trusts profound silence to the will of the ALLWISE Disposer of ALL events acting as well as daily praying  "Thy will be done  in  me  on  me and  by  me"  Mr Berkeley in a letter to his Mother during his illness says  "I trust I have learned my dearest Mother's prayer 'Thy will' c  Mrs Berkeley sunk again into her bed Just as the clock struck nine she exclaimed to Dr Berkeley  "If ever I heard Berkeley cough in my life he has coughed this minute"  "Alas my dear no you will never hear him any more on earth"  Mrs Berkeley's maid entered at that instant saying  "that Mr Berkeley was come to life again and wished to see Mrs Berkeley"  It may be easily supposed that she was not long in getting down stairs where she saw her dear Son looking like an angel his fine eyes as lively as when in perfect health and for about a fortnight before his death his nose became so exactly like the beautiful one of his two grandfathers Bishop Berkeley and Mr Frinsham both having the same fineshaped nose that he looked remarkably beautiful The same change after death took place in the same feature of Dr Berkeley's wonderfully beautiful face Such changes are said by the learned men of the faculty often to happen a few  hours before the separation of the spirit from the earthly mould  Dr and Mr Monck Berkeley both wanted what Mrs Berkeley always termed the genuine Berkeley nose and which her own father without being a Berkeley had The present Countess Dowager of Granard has it When the beautiful lady Georgiana Berkeley she was a fac simile of a wonderfully fine ivory medallion taken of Bishop Berkeley at Rome when a young man Dr Berkeley used to say to Mr Berkeley  "Aye your nose is a  judgement  upon your Mother for despising mine because it is not like my father's"  Mr Monck Berkeley had from pictures in Berkeley Castle and from monuments drawings of all his noble ancestors and used to show his Mother some few with a short nose to which she used to reply  "Aye some ugly mother has introduced it"  When Doctor Berkeley in the case of the late brave Admiral B  as plain as he was valiant his lady one of the most beautiful women in Europethe sons all resembling the mother the very clever worthy daughters the good Admiralobserved  "What a pity it is that those poor girls have all got such an horrid  dash  of their father in their faces"  The young ladies are all well married and make as excellent wives as their beautiful mother The worthy veteran used to say  "I never thought my wife handsome until Dr Berkeley talked so much of her beauty  I  know she was a  very  good wife"  Mr Berkeley who always greatly delighted in the Psalms desired those of the day both morning and evening might be redde to him in which he joined The evening Psalms of the th day of the month conclude the exixth Psalm Mr Berkeley felt the whole well suited to his state particularly the  last  verse His Father prayed with him the family attending and pronounced at the request of his Mother that delightful absolution of the excellent Church of England in her office for the Visitation of the Sick He appeared so much revived that his friends all quitted the room a little before noon except his Mother the medical gentlemen who attended having given it as their opinion that he would remain until about ten at night In about half an hour his Mother perceiving that speaking seemed rather painful to him and that he breathed rather quicker said  "We will pray"  and taking out of her pocket Bishop Hall's excellent little book of Devotions for  all  occasions and  all  relations in life from which she petitioned at the Throne of Grace for her Son as soon as his soul the breath of  entered his body she now when she conceived it was returning to God prostrated herself by the bedside and his servant at the foot of the bed when oh the wonderful goodness of Christ she was enabled to offer that fine prayer for one just departing out of this world with a distinct voice and without one falling tear which she well knew would have thrown her Son into extreme  agony  Mr Berkeley from a child of three years old could never support the sight of his Mother in tears Had she chosen to condescend to practise art and have wept she might have managed her Son as she pleased from three to almost thirty years old After his arrival at Cheltenham observing the tears standing in her eyes he exclaimed to his Father  "Oh my dear Sir this is too much for me to support I have all my life since I knew how to pray besought God to inflict any suffering upon me but that of seeing my dear Mother in tears"  Dr Berkeley replied  "My dear can you suppose that your Mother much command as she has over herself must not sometimes be overcome"  Mrs Berkeley wiped her eyes and chearfully said  "My dear shall I get a mask"    "  Any thing best  of Mothers to prevent  my  seeing your tears I never could bear it in my health and strength"  Mr Berkeley when a youth once said  "  My  Mother never laughs"  To which his Father replied  "Well if your Mother never laughs herself she makes us laugh very often and that is more to our purpose than if she did We have this comfort that she never weeps without REAL cause"  Mr Berkeley joined in that fine prayer the Lord's Prayer and  "The Lord lift up the light of his reconciled countenance"  c Mrs Berkeley then seated herself by her Son's pillow he fixed his still fine eyes most tenderly upon her for about two minutes then closed them she conceiving that he was resolved his poor unworthy Mother should be the last earthly object they should behold He then without calling for the assistance of his servant turned himself quite round to the other side of his bed laid his arms down by his side and made himself quite ready for his coffin then uttered three distinct aspirations as was conceived to that coequal Triune God in whom he had ever so firmly believed from the age of fifteen After a little time one single deep breath to  as was supposed his lovely spirit winged its happy flight to the realms of bliss There may all who loved him in God's appointed time join him in casting their crowns before  the Throne and singing "Worthy is the Lamb" c Thus ended the shortlonglife of George Monck Berkeley Esquire leaving his parents towhat shall I saydeplore their irreparable loss They could hardly be so selfish and as Lord  a near relation of his Father and Sir  an old intimate friend both with one consent although in very distant parts said in their letters to Mrs Berkeley  "It is hardly possible to condole one must rather exult with you on so happy so delightful an exit"  And his Mother has often asserted that if a wish would restore to her the  sweet  society of her beloved Son and Husband she would not be selfish enoughwicked enoughto form that wish  Mr Berkeley prayed fervently to God for three things and He that heareth the prayers of the contrite heard and answered him  First That the agonies of his stomach might cease one week before he quitted this mortal life  "Oh spare me a little that I may recover my strength before I go hence and be no more seen"  The mercy of God graciously ordered that they ceased just ten days before his death  and instead of that craving for fruits and acids he rather wished to avoid taking any thing not even orange and lemon jelly so as to occasion his Mother's one day saying  "My dear Man if you do not take a little nourishment you will be a suicide"  to which he hastily replied  "Oh God for Jesus' sake avert"  He then took the glass of jelly from her hand and said  "I will take any thing you wish"  Going into his room one morning he as usual enquired kindly of Mrs Berkeley concerning her health to which she replied  "As well my dear as I can expect to be with this horrid weather"  Frost has ever been exceedingly inimical to Mrs Berkeley's health He with the mildest sweetest voice said  "My dear Mother is it  quite  right in us to find fault with any weather or any thing that God pleases to send us"  A few years ago an Irish gentleman of fortune of Cork published a long letter in the St James's Chronicle on the same idea It may perhaps be wrong but one has from childhood been accustomed to say unreproved  "What horrid or what vile weather this is"  Secondly That he might not die in the night or in his sleepHe expired exactly at noon the sun shining more remarkably bright and clear than is at all usual at that season of the year  Thirdly That he might retain his senses perfectly to the very last breath he drew How graciously that petition was answered has been above related  Monsieur Le Moyne in a beautiful little work which I believe is not translated into English says  "  La mer nous représent la bonté du bon Dieu au pénitentsLa mer toujours sort pour rencontre les rivieres  "  c  Mr Berkeley was too well known in the metropolises of these three kingdoms to make a particular description of his person necessary Suffice it therefore to say that the beauty of his face by no means equalled that of his exquisitely beautiful Father and his still handsomer Grandfather Bishop Berkeley He more resembled in face and stature his Mother's Father the thoroughly excellent Reverend Henry Frinsham AM esteemed when at Oxford and till debilitated by illness the strongest  "bestbuilt"  man in England Mr Frinsham and his grandson were both six feet high without their shoes each took care not be indebted to them for additional height both their strength was muscular both having remarkably small bones Mr Berkeley was much handsomer than Mr Frinsham excepting his nose  Mr Frinsham going once to dine with a friend at a gentleman's house one servant was observed not to move when any thing was called for On being asked sharply  "why he did not exchange plates"  c he exclaimed  "I cannot do any thing for looking at that gentleman's Mr Frinsham's beautiful nose"  Mr Berkeley strongly resembled both his grandfathers and bore none or very slight resemblance to either of his parents Mr Berkeley could not look into a glass without perceiving that he did not resemble his Father His agreeable wit used to divert his friends by saying  "Some poor simple person now and then meaning to flatter  my  Mother says 'Dear Madam how much Mr Berkeley resembles the Doctor' I who know  le desous des cartes  see my Mother redden and answer 'Oh dear Sir or Madam  not  the  least in the world  'Sometimes a simpler soul says Madam I think Mr Berkeley is very like youThe first was bad enough but now I can fancy I see my Mother getting her knuckles ready to knock them down"  Mrs Berkeley used often to laugh and say  "Berkeley how is it that with very fine eyes c an exquisitely fine complexion the finest teeth ever set in a head and very fine hair and a wellshaped face  you are not  handsome"  A most highly accomplished sensible intimate friend of Mr Berkeley's Mother the lady of D  M  Esquire used often to say to Mrs Berkeley  "If you tell him before me that he is not handsome  I will knock you down  All the ladies and men say he is handsomeDon't mind Berkeley what your Mother says because you don't happen to be just like your Father"  the great beauty of his face his eyes much  larger which were decorated with his Father's beautiful dark eyebrows and eyelashes  Mr Monck Berkeley's eyelashes were so remarkably long as often when he was a lad to entangle and distress him when reading a decoration of face to which he was indebted as well as his Brother to their Mother who constantly cut them with a fine pair of scissors twice every moon It is an infallible method of rendering them long and thick With Mr Berkeley it was attended with some little difficulty from the extreme volatility of his motions Dr Berkeley and all her intimate friends thought her the most daring of spirits to venture to do it before Mr Berkeley could listen to reason It was then done when he was in a sound sleep Afterwards with the following exhortation  "Now child stand as still as a statue for if you move your finger or your eye the least in the world in go the scissors and out goes your eye"  "Well but then I shall have  one  left"    "No you will not for when one is gone the other generally goes soon after it and you will never get eyes again until your body rises out of the grave at the day of judgement and you will be always all your life in the dark"  Much as Mr Berkeley loved in childhood to be in motion this  eloquent  oration had as much weight as if it had been uttered by a Burke    Dr Berkeley's family once attending some friends of theirs of too high rank to be left entirely to the verger of the week to view the curiosities of the magnificent cathedral of Canterbury on reaching the tomb of the Black Prince the sword was taken out as usual and delivered to the company to admire When going to be again deposited within the iron railing Mr Berkeley took it into his hands and drew it with as much ease as he would have drawn his own sword Mrs Preston the verger's wife exclaimed  "Good Lord Sir what have you done"  Mr Berkeley's Mother instantly said  "I hope no harm My dear Berkeley why would you draw it without asking if it was permitted to be drawn"    "Harm Madam"  replied the worthy woman  "Mr Berkeley has done no harm if he has not hurt himself"  adding  "Well Sir I suppose I have seen more than an hundred gentlemen attempt to draw that sword but no one ever accomplished it with one hand but yourself"  Mrs Berkeley's alarm then subsided and she replied  "He has his Mother's and Grandfather's wonderful strength of wrist"  So entirely muscular was his strength that a short time before his death that wrist that could lift a man nearly as tall as himself by the  collar of the coat did not measure half an inch more than his Mother's who is a very little woman  Mr Monck Berkeley's person altogether made what persons usually term a very fine looking young man He was so exactly proportioned that he never appeared a tall man except when standing in a groupe He had a most graceful figure and was esteemed the finest dancer of his stature in England At the famous masquerade given by the late Lord Barrymore at Wargrove where Mr Berkeley appeared as an Highland Chief most completely elegantly equipped purse claymore dirk c every thing but the kelt insted of which he wore the trowse two masks accosted him with  "Laird are you for a Highland reel"  Mr Berkeley instantly gave his claymore to a gentleman to hold stepped forward and they began a  threesome reel  in which the superiority of Mr Berkeley's dancing was so marked as to cause a very great personage who honoured that most elegant masquerade with his presence to stand the whole time and to say at the expiration of that beautiful dance when well danced by  Scots  "that Mr Berkeley was the finest figure and the finest dancer he had ever seen"  and praise from those who excel in any art is  praise  Mr Berkeley although not regularly handsome had perhaps one of the most pleasing countenances any where to be seena look of the deepest thought enlightened by  the sweetest mildest benevolence and when called forth brightened by the liveliest chastized gaiety which has caused some of the first characters for learning and sense to assert that Mr Monck Berkeley was the most agreeable companion they had ever known That look of deep thought and exquisite benevolence seldom united in the same soul seldomer blended in the same countenance are so astonishingly preserved in the beautiful portrait painted by his beloved friend Mr Peters and by that throughly amiable gentleman presented to Mrs Berkeley after her Son's death as to delight all who have a soul capable of enjoying the beauties of an exquisite painting The print prefixed to the Poems is taken from that exquisite painting but Engraving cannot give the soul like Painting Mrs Berkeley esteems herself rich in a most beautiful miniature of her unspeakably dear Son so small as constantly to be carried in the pocket taken from Mr Peters's portrait by the wonderful the magic pencil of her excellent accomplished friend Miss Johnson of the PaddockHouse near Canterbury Whoever has an eye for fine painting and has been treated with a fight of that Lady's performances must be sensible of the happiness of possessing one of a dear departed friend It can hardly be said departed He is present and does every thing but articulate Such obligations are not to be repaid The mines of Brazil if possessed are not adequate Mrs Berkeley was some years ago indebted to the same exquisite pencil for a bracelet  of her youngest Son done entirely from memory for two indifferent pictures of that beautiful child rather confused than assisted  At the King's School at Canterbury a common amusement of the lower school was playing at  judge and jury  Counsel were regularly retained to plead on each side By accident Dr Berkeley discovered the value that was set on his Son's oratorical powers in that mimic court on first hearing of it from the amiable beloved friend of his Son the late Mr Thurlow son of Lord Thurlow whose play hours were constantly spent under the hospitable roof of Dr Berkeley who enquiring how the counsel were feed he replied  "Oh we have all the same fee a halfpenny apiece excepting Berkeley and he has always a penny"  "A penny replied Dr Berkeley why should he have a penny I am sure he is not covetous"    "No no but they  will  give it him because  they  are sure to  win  their cause who have Berkeley on their side"  Perhaps it may gratify some young gentlemen his schoolfelows in distant parts of the world and bring the happy innocent days of very early youth to their remembrance if they should glance their eye over this to see their names At the head of this list stands dear angelichearted Mr Thurlow the gentle elegant Captain Colombine of the Navy the lively sprightly Samuel Chambers of WoodstockHouse  Kent the Reverend Stephen Tucker Mr Charles Hasted Osborne Tylden Esquire of  Court in Kent Mr Gregory  Now in the Wiltshire Militia  son of the Reverend Mr Gregory of Canterbury the Reverend Cooper Willyams of Itning Mr Mark Thomas son of the famous Alderman Thomas the throughly respectable worthy Reverend Sir HenryPix Heyman Baronet shame to tell with only a living or rather a  starving  of about sixty pounds  per annum  bestowed on him by the bounty of his present Grace of Canterbury for until lately that very respectable antient young Baronet had only a curacyhappily for him he inherits some fortune from his motherthe vast family estate except what was left to charity all went in the reigns of the Stuarts Sir Henry Heyman may read emphatically  "put not your trust in princes"  The greatgrandfather of his friend Mr Monck Berkeley is said to have left his curse on his latest descendant who should ever expend a shilling in the service of any King Mr Berkeley's father hazarded it It is almost incredible what it cost him to advertize his famous sermon preached on the st of January to endeavour to prevent a reform in parliamenttwenty guineas for advertizing it in one particular Newspaper besides frequently in some others and in all country paperspresenting a copy to every member of both Houses whom to use his own expression  "he thought had  sense  enough to understand it"  It went through five editions within four weeks as the Doctor mentioned to a  friend a little time before his lamented death A sixth edition was very lately printed consisting of one thousand copies which were all dispersed  gratis  amongst traders c  "to try to teach poor fools to know  when  they are well"  It had been always said that Dr Berkeley's grandfather  The Right Honourable John Forster of Forrest near Dublin During the reign of Queen Anne his exertions for the House of Hanover were so well known that the Speaker of the  Irish  House of Commons was every day for some years the first toast at the palace of Herenhausen and so grateful was King George the First for his essential services that on arriving in London he said  "The first man I will prefer is the Speaker of the Irish House of Commons"  This grateful Prince offered any and every thing together with a Peerage Little was accepted as his fortune was very large and the Peerage gratefully declined His Majesty said  "I will promote all your brothers Sir"  The Speaker had an only brother younger than himself a senior Fellow of Dublin College with a  maternal  estate of fifteen hundred pounds  per annum  who begged to decline the burden of a bishopric being a very sickly man but his Majesty insisted on  inflicting  it on him for which the poor of Raphoe ought to bless his memory for they even to this day eat bread meat and potatoes at a very reduced price Bishop Forster at his death bequeathing a very large sum annually out of his estates for ever His conduct through life and at death was such as to make his witty successor the only wit of his family for generations say  "It is not polite to name my predecessor in  my  presence we are  such  a contrast"  set the present Family on the Throne and that his Father  In the rebellion in Bishop Berkeley's letter to the Roman Catholics of the Diocese of Cloyne for which he received the thanks of all the Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland in the public papers was at that time universally supposed to have prevented the people of that persuasion from rising and joining the Chevalier de St George and by their vast superiority in point of numbers placing him on the throne of Ireland and the Stuart family had then a great many concealed friends in England who lay perdue till they saw which side was likely to prove victorious A very worthy gentleman one of the younger brothers of Bishop Berkeley a most excellent officer used often to say  "I will never incur my grandfather's curse My brother may do what he pleases"  This gentleman father to four very worthy ladies all still living was commander in chief in the year in the County Kingdom as it is often called of Fife It will easily be supposed that it afforded no small pleasure to Dr and Mr Monck Berkeley to have it frequently asked if they were at all related to that delightfully humane kind officer who commanded in Fife in the rebellion Numerous instances of his humanity were related to them Dr Berkeley said  "he had often heard that brave veteran relate with tears in his eyes one adventure"  Going to the castle of the father of the present worthy Earl of  no men appeared but the Countess came out with an infant at her breast fell down on her knees at his feet and conjured him for Christ's sake not to deprive her of two small cows all that was left to keep her seven children and three female servants from perishing by famine He conjured her to rise and told her ladyship  "That so far from driving her cows he would station a few of his soldiers not in but near her castle to protect her from all injury"  The present Earl's gratitude was shewn by the most marked attention to Dr Berkeley and his family during their  séjour  in Fife  fixed them there and that generous disinterested  nobleminded man used to say  "By the blessing of God I will try to keep them there"  Dr Berkeley as well as his father and grandfather was a very great politician The sermon was preached in Canterbury Cathedral on  Monday  January and by the orders and contrivance of the preacher and active acuteness of the wellknown Alderman Simmons of Canterbury sold in Todd's shop at York on the next Thursday in order to defeat Wyville's meeting at that place which to the great delight of Dr Berkeley it accomplished  Dr Berkeley never asked during his life but two favours of ministryequal to the exchanging two halfcrowns for five shillings or two sixpences for a shilling both however were  too great  to be granted to the grandson of the Speaker of the Irish House of Commonsto the son of Bishop Berkeley When his son left Canterbury School he wished to exchange his stall at Canterbury for either Windsor or Westminster to superintend the education of his Son at one of those schools He preferred Windsor Some years after on his Son's leaving Eton he again requested an exchange for a stall at Christ Church but met with similar success  The exquisite amiability of Mr Berkeley's  nature not his temper  that being naturally wilful in some sort rugged was  reformed  by EDUCATION  regenerated  by GRACE His nature as has been shewn was throughly NOBLE uncommonly generous He had by both his Parents from infancy been bred up with an horror of being what is called a TUFT HUNTER at Oxford or a sneaking LORD COURTER at Eton His  real  nobility of blood little needed such cautions  Soon after his going to the King's School at Canterbury there came to board at Dr Beauvoir's Mr Thurlow only son of the late Lord Chancellor Thurlow by Miss Lynch  daughter of the charitable hospitable Dean Lynch  Dean Lynch preserved the poor of Canterbury from starving as they have since done by ordering five hundred pounds worth of silk damask to be wove and entirely new furnished the Deanery It raised that excellent trade which the muslin Misses have since totally annihilated Those who have witnessed the distress of the poor silk weavers their wives and children are not to be pitied when burnt to death by flimsey muslin gowns and draggled linen petticoats  and sister to the late accomplished Sir William and to the happiness of the poor and distressed or  oppressed  the  present  Reverend Dr Lynch Prebendary of Canterbury Each of these gentlemen inherited a very large share of both their parents' extraordinarily charitable disposition as did the late lovely Mrs Hey and Mrs Tatton their sisters Mr Thurlow then about eight years old just half a year younger than Mr Berkeley was sent from under the protection of his sensible wonderfully kind  adopting  father the Reverend Mr Hey of Wickham whose lady abovenamed was his Mother's eldest sister The Writer cannot proceed without heaving a sigh and dropping a tear of friendship over the urn of that most sensible interesting of youths the only son of dear Thurlow's  earthly guardian angel  Mr Hey She still feels pleasure in recollecting how often he used to say  "Is it not very odd that although I have uncles aunts and many kind relations who are very good to me yet I always feel myself more at home at Dr Berkeley's"  He was about fifteen a youth of a very singular turn of mind endowed with all his father's great understanding  and all the real mild not affected gentleness of his lovely mother A strong tincture of melancholy was visible to even a common observer As a child at home it was said he never loved to play at school he never played at cricket c longer than ten minutes then retired to read Mrs Berkeley's wish to delight the mother of an only child occasioned her telling her servants  "that whenever Mrs Hey's carriage came to Dr Berkeley's some servant man or woman must go immediately to Dr Beauvoir's where he boarded to fetch Master Hey"  Both mother and son felt more than this little  motherly  attention merited Mrs Berkeley told Master Hey when he felt himself lowspirited and had no more agreeable place to take his tea he would find it in her dressingroom at six where he would sometimes enjoy the very improving conversation of that accomplished that wise director of young men Dr Berkeley if not he might dissipate his gloom a little by hearing her  raileries  on his gravity c at fifteen Mrs Berkeley having been in the same predicament herself at twelve with a youth of thirteen Dear Johnny as he was always called by Dr and Mrs Berkeley had contrived very early in life before he was thirteen to form an attachment that did not contribute to dissipate the natural gloom of his mind although it often exhilarated him  The youngest daughter of the celebrated Mr Airson although very far from handsome was blessed with so very  fine an understanding that all the uncommonly sensible youths and even lads were her devoted admirers as others were of the great beauty of Dr Beauvoir's eldest daughter now married to William Hammond Esquire of the Friers Canterbury Miss Airson died at the age of nineteen Mrs Berkeley used to say of her  "that she had understanding enough to set up a large country town"  Her gratitude was great indeed that VERY scarce virtue growing only in an  humble  heart and cherished by a strong head for what  she  deemed the condescending attentions of Mrs Berkeley to her her father being a  Minor  where Mrs Berkeley's husband was a  Major  Although very kindly treated at Canterbury to what they are in most other Cathedrals and Choirs Norwich excepted the Minorcanons and Schoolmasters their wives and daughters are in a very different line of company In general their original fortunes and always their church incomes are undoubtedly so much inferior as not to make them  wish  to mix Mrs Berkeley on being once reproached by a Prebendary's lady for introducing Miss Airsons at her routs and being intimate with their elegant sweet mother made this laconic reply  "Why my dear Madam Mrs Airson's father had almost as many thousands a year as  my  father had hundreds and if Mrs Airson chose to marry the first singer in the world a clergyman and a  gentleman  rather than a foolish ignoramus in a red coat does that make her conversation the less pleasing to me  Should Mrs Airson's elegant accomplished  Burton Esquire of Shropshire  nephew with his noble estate offer to ANY Prebendary's daughter I dare say she would not refuse him  I  have  no  daughter thank God so am not courting Mrs Airson for her nephew"  Mr Airson and his family were so highly so universally respected that their small house was the resort of all persons of fashion and good sense The late amiable Bishop of Norwich when Dean of Canterbury would often when walking out say  "Come my dear Madam suppose we go to Johnny's coffeehouse"  Mr Airson a great invalid never dined or even drank tea from home He never confined his lady or daughters they well knew  he  would not pass his afternoons alone His piety almost equalled his musical powers which he never would use except in a private room to his friends but in the house of that God who bestowed them  It used sometimes to be said that Mr Airson was indolent and did not sing a fine anthem When asked if he  thought  himself ill he used to say  "Ask Mrs Berkley if I ever in my life when able to go to church refused singing any anthem when she desired it of me"  Mrs Berkeley herself had an idea of not riding a free horse to death  Handel offered him eight hundred pounds  per annum  if he would only sing in the Oratorios in Lent but he refused it It is somewhat remarkable that the Sunday after his very sudden death the late Bishop of Norwich then Dean of Canterbury lamented his loss and celebrated his virtues in similar words  to those used by the Writer of this Preface in the Canterbury Paper the preceding day when lamenting the loss of that cheerful gay heavenlyminded friend whom she had so far  en gaieté de coeur  prevailed on to accompany her as far as his hall in her way to a rout at his next door neighbour's saying  "She should attract  all  eyes and receive the thanks of  all  the company"  His gentle amiable eldest daughter then his  all  since married to Mr Allen of Hereford her mother and sister being gone objected to his having on his  old  coat and begging him to put on his  smart  new one To this Mrs Berkeley strongly objected saying  "It might tender as he was occasion his taking cold"  Had he gone she would ever have reproached herself as the cause of his universally lamented death  It is now more than high time to return from this too long digression but the reciting the virtues of beloved respected friends NOW beyond the reach of any other attentions is apt in a heart susceptible of  sincere  regard for real worth to give the pen a disorder which the French apply to the tongue of one who talks too much  il a une fluxe de langue  The Writer often feels  la fluxe de plume  She is sometimes tempted to form the wish of an old friend of hers whose husband made her she being a ready penwoman write much for him  "  Well I do wish I had never been taught to write at all  "  Perhaps the readers of this  may form it for her but it is not necessary to read the whole of every book and to use the language of Holy Writ they may  "  separate the precious from the vile  "  They may read the fine Poetry of the Author and pass over the indifferent Prose of the Editor  Whenever Mr Monck Berkeley observed any boy who boarded at either of the Masters never invited out to dinner on holidays he would say to his Mother  "Pray my dear Madam next holiday invite poor such an one and such an one Poor things they have no relations or acquaintance here to invite them and it is very dull for them Pray be so good as to let them come here"  This whether they were his intimates or not Indeed his intimates seldom did come having most of them parents in the church or city excepting sometimes the Reverend Cooper Willyams of Ixning son of the very worthy Captain and Mrs Willyams and Captain Gregory of the Wiltshire Militia son of the very learned Reverend Francis Gregory of Canterbury  Mr Thurlow happened to come to school in the beginning of summer when all his uncles and aunts usually resident in Canterbury during the winter had retired to their country residences Mr Berkeley soon presented his humble petition to his Mother that he might bring Thurlow  home sometimes The request was granted and the good disposition the propriety the docility the worthiness of Mr Thurlow soon endeared him so much to Mrs Berkeley that she told her Son  "he might bring Thurlow but no other boy without asking her permission whenever he pleased"  The dear child generally drank tea every evening in  winter  at Dr Berkeley's for in  summer  they are all  "over the hills and far away"  When he was a little more than nine years old he like his friend Mr Berkeley was sent to France for several months to acquire the French language in perfection At his return he gave a proof of the exquisite sensibility of his heart  A short character and sincere lamentation of this early not untimelyfor GOD's time is ever the best time death of this beloved young gentleman was inserted by his friend Mrs Berkeley in Bristow's Canterbury Journal It fell short in describing his amiability but the Editor cannot let a beloved friend whether young or old quit this mortal scene without paying that little tribute to their memorywhen she sees it neglected by abler pens  On his arrival in England he went from Dover for a short time to the house of his kind patron Mr Hey who soon brought him to Canterbury for a day The instant he got out of the carriage he flew to the Oaks knocked at the door and begged he might be shown up to Mrs Berkeley Being told she was in bed with a bad headach he expressed much concern and enquired what time she  would rise the servant replied  "most likely to dinner"  as she never continued in bed when not exceedingly ill At a little before the dinner hour he came Mrs Berkeley not risen About five in the afternoon he called again and hearing Mrs Berkeley was not up begged to see her own maid whom he thus addressed  "Pray be so good as to go up to Mrs Berkeley and give my tenderest love to her tell her I long so much to see her that I beg she will permit me to go up and stand a few minutes at her bed side as I shall not be in Canterbury again these four days"  The servant came up Mrs Berkeley said  "She was very sorry but hoped she should be able to see him the next time he came"  The servant replied  "Dear Madam he is but a child and he longs so to see you it will half break his heart if he does not"    "Well poor dear child let him come up then"  The moment he reached the bed side he caught Mrs Berkeley's hand kissed it and bursting into tears kneeled down and after sobbing some time said  "I hope my dear Madam that you are not dangerously ill"  Mrs Berkeley with her usual good spirits in illness replied  "No my dear Charles I hope in God I am not I have the old proverb on my side  that nought is never in danger  "  What would not some persons give for a son with  such an heart  and a most excellent head During his last lingering illness at the house of his excellent uncle the amiable generous kindhearted  Dr Lynch Prebendary of Canterbury where every thing that kindness could suggest and cleverness could execute was prepared for him he would perpetually say  "Go to next door with my best regards to Mrs Berkeley and beg her to send me something whatever she pleases out of her storeroom I know I can eat that"  Mr Berkeley's earnest request to his Mother who was to reach Canterbury after their arrival from Scotland many weeks before  he  could being obliged to keep term at the Temple was  "Pray learn and write me word immediately whether Thurlow is returned to England and if he is where I may find him"  Mrs Berkeley who used laughingly to say she was as obedient a Mother after Mr Berkeley grew up as she had  made  him a Son in his childhood and youth obeyed and soon executed her commission and Mr Berkeley and Mr Thurlow came down in the same chaise one to the Oaks the other to Wickham on Christmas eve the most dreadful cold snowing day one can remember Both were almost literally frozen when they arrived at Dr Berkeley's and it was an alarming time before they seemed to feel any effect from what was given them  Dr and Mrs Berkeley reproached Mr Berkeley for not stopping all night at the PALACE of Mr Simpson the Rose at Sittingbourne where every comfort convenience and  elegance is to be found from the excellent Master Mistress and the wonderfully worthy Chambermaid Mrs Mary Humphreys  As a proof of her worthiness one night when Dr Berkeley's family slept there Mrs Berkeley's maid said  "Madam the maid you admire so much for her care and honesty has just now gone up into a gentleman's room and made him rise saying that the underchambermaid had mistaken her and put him into a wrong bed not sufficiently aired but that the other was quite ready begged his pardon for her deputy's carelessness that she was attending to  your  beds and thought the other could not have mistaken but that she could never have forgiven herself had she ever put any one into an halfaired bed"  Oh that all innservants were as careful The Writer of this Note has twice once in France and once in England suffered from want of such care This worthy woman's education was singular She is by birth a native of Wales Being her father's tenth child the worthy minister of the parish having no child of his own said he would take her as a  tithechild  Under the roof of this humane worthy minister of Christ she grew up and remained till his death She certainly does not disgrace her education received under the roof in the kitchen for he was too wise to bring up a labourer's daughter as a gentlewomanto starve or become a streetwalker  It however pleased the mercy of God that the two friends received not the least injury from this frightful journey To adopt the language of the excellent Monsieur De Pontis in his delightfully entertaining  although  pious Mémoires which that execrable monster Voltaire has tried to persuade fools and atheists is a fable notwithstanding Madame De Sevigné mentions his death c at the time God waited for them elsewhere for dear Thurlow was doomed to fall an early victim to ENGLISH INHOSPITALITY as himself related to Dr Berkeley whom he had so frequently heard celebrated the lovely hospitality  of Scotland  "I owe said he my present illness to the want of it in England I had been out hunting was caught in a violent storm was quite wet through called at a gentleman's where  I hoped  to have been taken in I was offered wine and brandy the butler called but no offer of a bed for a few hours or of going in to dry my cloaths so after having sat on my horse the storm over at the gate in cold wet cloaths I proceeded to Cambridge and went to my rooms but the cold fixed on my lungs and no skill has been able to remove it"  Alas it not long after removed him and robbed his friends and the world of one of the most amiablehearted grateful of human beings Adieu dear youth  Requiescat in pace  When Mr Thurlow was about eleven years old his uncle the Bishop of Durham then Dean of Rochester when passing through Canterbury to the sea and conceiving his old friend Dr Berkeley's house to be the best as he knew it was the  Mrs Berkeley who seldom leaves home for more than three hours at a time  ie  from six to nine in the evening nor wishes to see any friend unless travelling near her at any other time used to occasion Mr Monck Berkeley's often saying  "if my Aunt Father and self were all dead my Mother would never miss us until the servant announced to her that the urn was carried into the drawingroom"  The  Trio  all agreed to this charge  "On entering it she would ask 'Where are they all' and begin lamenting the loss of us"  Mrs Berkeley used often to be laughed at by Dr Berkeley and Mrs Frinsham for declaring that she ate her dinner quite as well alone as in the best company When Dr Berkeley at the age of twentyfour took from Christ Church the little living of Asgarton near the Vale of White Horse he found the house a hovel and having been bred in a palace he loved a good house However after laying out near four hundred pounds on the house and building a fine South wall in the garden finding it too small to lodge his  few  friendsthe Reverend James Hamilton grandson of Lord Abercorne a constant delightful visitor through the whole summer at Dr Berkeley's at Bray or Acton until his removal by the late Lord Abercorne to a great living in Ireland and some others together with a multitude of  locusts  finding the vicarage too small he rented Ley Farm the country house of Sir Nathaniel Nash Until his removal to Bray the Bishop of Durham then Curate of Wantage was a very constant frequent visitor there  cheapest inn in Canterbury drove to the  Oaks No sooner was his arrival notified to Mrs Berkeley than she ordered Mr Wrightson to go and tell his Master a person wanted to speak to him Mrs Berkeley conjured him to permit her to send to Dr Beauvoir's for dear Charles Dr Berkeley with his usual goodwill to man and child complied John now Mr Wrightson as the best messenger was dispatched to beg that Miss Beauvoir would order Master Thurlow to be arrayed in his Sunday garb and posted off to Dr Berkeley's notifying the cause Mrs Berkeley ordered Mr Wrightson to call out his Master when the little man arrived Accordingly in a few minutes Dr Berkeley looking like a beautiful guardianangel of those  "  little ones  "  mentioned by our blessed Lord entered the drawingroom leading in his little  protegé  whom he presented to the Dean  "Here my old friend is a very good little man who is very nearly related to you"  The Dean looked about as  éveillé  as usual stroked his head and asked him how he liked school and some other questions generally put to children In the afternoon he told him to stand by him at the cardtable and when the time arrived for Charles to make his bow and return to Dr Beauvoir's the Dean who had won about a guinea  generously  presented poor dear Charles with  two and sixpence  for which he made one of his graceful French bows and retired They never met again until they met in the regions of departed spirits  Some  persons have even doubted whether poor Thurlow could be found  worthy  of a place to behold the glory of the  "ANGEL of the Church of Durham"  The resemblance in face and person of Mr Thurlow to the Bishop was remarkably striking to all the company allowing only that the tempers and dispositions of his mind were entirely Lynch and Wake which threw a look of benevolence into his features and countenance which did  not appear  in the Bishop's  About the year there died at Canterbury a very excellent young man an old schoolfellow of Mr Berkeley's Mr George Hasted son of the Author of the History of Kent On Mr Berkeley's arrival in vacationtime Mrs Berkeley asked her Son  "if he was not afflicted at the death of his old intimate George Hasted"  He replied  "I was very sorry for the death of so very worthy a young man but my dear Mother  he  was  never  an intimate  of mine HE was much too studious and diligent for  us  was in quite another set he pitied us for our idleness and folly George Hasted would never go to cricket or to Bingley where the King's scholars swim in summer till he had done every tittle of his exercise We all set off and left it to chance to get our exercise done or if not done get a sound flogging"  Had Mr Berkeley when a boy been told that nobody could learn Latin or Greek he would have studied night and day  Every night just before the family went to supper Mrs Berkeley used to go into both her little boys rooms to see whether they lay straight and in a wholesome posture which is of more consequence to children than people in general are aware of One night when Mr Berkeley was about five years old on entering the room she found his fine eyes wide open She asked him  "how he came to be awake and how he  dared  to have his eyes open"  being always ordered to shut them when in bed or in a dark room He replied  "I have not been asleep at all I have been  racking  my brain to try to make a syllable without a vowel because you have always told me it was impossible to do itand if I could have done it it would have made me very happy to have come and told you of it"  Tell him from five years old of any thing that it was impossible to accomplish and he was indefatigable in labouring at it his brother just the reverse Perhaps never were two children born of the same Father and Mother more different Mr Berkeley would add  "Always excepting  my Mother  and  her only sister  "  Mr Berkeley gay lively volatile yet wonderfully solid his brother sedate grave yet wonderfully witty  both Poets from the time they could articulate at all both enthusiastic admirers of music Neither Mr Berkeley nor his brother were ever suffered to go to Bingley to swim without their Mother's leave Mr Berkeley used to come regularly when the masters had given permission to the boys with his request  Mrs Berkeley  "I am afraid you will be drowned  Mr B  "No I shall not  Mrs B  "Do any of the upper school go  Mr B  "Yes  Mrs B  "Who Does Mr J Tucker or Mr Tilden go  Mr B  "Yes  Mrs B  "Well then go if you will but I am afraid You know Herbert Packe would have been drowned if young Loftie had not saved himDown he sat and took up a bookWell child why do not you go  Mr B  "No I shall not go  Mrs B  "Why not now that I have given you leave  Mr B  "No I shall not indeed  Mrs B  "Why what can I do more Would you have me conduct you thither  Mr B  "No but I shall not take  such  a leave  Mrs B  "Why what leave would you have  Mr B  "Why say in  your good humoured sweet  voice Yes  my dear Berkeley  you may go to Bingley this afternoon and I had  rather  you went than stayed at home or else I shall not go on any account"  His brother coming with the same request and obtaining the forced permission would reply  "Thank you my dear Mamma"  fly out of the room scamper down stairs and set off lest the permission should be recalled leaving the door wide open and dart away under St John's Arch When passed  that  he thought himself quite safe from being remanded Yet he was governed by a silk thread whilst his dear brother required  "  a threefold cord  "  Mr Berkeley when a lad too old for correction would when his Mother desired him not to go to such a place or do such a thing immediately reply  "Well then my dear Madam  command  me"    "Command you my dear I do not love commanding I never wish to exert my authority I  desire  that you will  not  do it"    "Yes I must all the desiring in the world  will not do  "    "That is very strange"    "I cannot help it Why won't you say Berkeley  I command  you not to do it"  The magic words by his earnest desire being uttered he would say  "Well now I am happy now I have not the least wish in the world to do it would not do it for any sum of money"  When he was about thirteen years old the news of the day  was a runaway match of a young man of rank A gentleman visiting at Dr Berkeley's turned to Mr Monck Berkeley and said  "Aye in three or four years young 'squire  you  will be playing the same prank"  It is impossible for any one then present to forget the dignified solemnity of Mr Berkeley's countenance whilst he uttered the following reply  "No Sir  I hope  not GOD FORBID that I should ever do so  important  a thing as MARRY without the  full  consent of my Parents"  Mr Berkeley was certainly a very extraordinary proof of the blessed effects of education A witty friend of the Editor's used to say  "If God will but send Mrs Berkeley's children a tolerable pair of eyes and all their limbs she asks no more  This lady might have added good understandings for the Editor when a young woman probably after the death of a young gentleman who had been tenderly attached to her from his age of twelve and hers of eleven he at Eton she at Mrs Sheeles until he at near nineteen died a Gentleman Commoner of Trinity College Oxford used frequently to tell her mother  "She feared to marry lest if she should have children they should have weak understandings which would break her heart"  To which Mrs Frinsham used to reply  "Surely it is the oddest idea that ever entered into the mind of woman I never thought of any such thing Thank God none of my family have ever been fools nor I hope knaves and why if you have children they should be such I cannot conceive I am sure  you  will  never  marry a fool"  God heard the Editor's prayers for certainly her dear children were  not  FOOLS  she will trim them and twist them into handsome faces and fine figures but she is not up to  making eyes  "  Mr Berkeley when grown up used often to divert his Father and friends by drawing his Mother's  charactershe present He used to say  "My Mother has  no  mercy on her own sex but little for the other Every fault every defect related of any young man she instantly replies 'Poor creature that was his  mother's  fault' In short she lays every fault of every kind except not writing a good Greek epigram or Latin oration on a man's Mother but she was an early studier of Lord Halifax's Advice to a Daughter"  He used to say  "My Mother I believe keeps a folio sheet of paper with all the virtues of her friends emblazoned on one side and their faults on the other Whilst they act worthily and honourably you never suppose they have any fault or foible let them but act unworthily to any one and the paper is reversed and you hear all their faults My Mother always carries a  little  catoninetails in her pocket and if any fool blasphemes or ridicules Scripture out it comes and he is very speedily made the laugh of all the company If my Mother was not my Mother I would bribe her with five hundred pounds to become my friend"  To which Mrs Berkeley used to reply  "You varlet you know it would be all in vain for  your Mother  would not be bribed to flatter Royalty any more than your Worship who thank God will not condescend to flatter any one although you often by your benevolence and great personal sincerity are led to cultivate intimacies with  vautriens  male and female some of rank among your own relations"  Of Mr Monck Berkeley's genius many of those who have redde what he has written may be competent judges To attempt to do justice to the exquisite amiability generosity and nobleness of his heart and the wonderful strength and soundness of his judgement even in early youth requires the knowledge of the Editor and the pen of his favourite Dr Johnson  His attentions to the poor from his childhood were unremitting The arguments of his Mother to dissuade him from wasting his alms on common beggars those horrid robbers of the honest labouring poor were all in vain His answer always was  "My dear Madam I am fully convinced of the truth of your reasoning and I do believe I never did relieve a common beggar in my life that was not a  vautrein  yet should I ever hear that any poor creature had perished who had asked charity of me and I had not relieved him I know I never could forgive myself through life"  So well was his character known to these wretches that they frequently asked in the village near which his Father resided  "If the 'Squire was at home for if he is not it is not worth while to turn out of the way to the house as the Doctor and the Lady never  give any thing to  POOR TRAVELLERS"  The fact is certain that they never came but when Mr Berkeley was in the country which occasioned Mrs Berkeley's telling her Son  that they were his visitors  Mr Berkeley as has been observed above was remarkably generous and had what is commonly called a  princely  spirit His beautiful brother was very saving and even covetous he never parted with his money but to the poor to whom he was very liberal indeed So careful was he of his money that it used to be a diversion to his Father and Aunt to borrow sixpence of him and then tell him that they were poor and could not pay him he would go to his Mother and desire her to  talk  to them and tell them  "that it was not  honest  to borrow of people and not pay them again and that  absolutely  he could not afford to lose his money"  Mr Monck Berkeley when a child once went and sold his buckles to relieve a person in distress When at Eton being unable to relieve a very large poor family near Braywood Side to whom his Father had been exceedingly bountiful and the family being at Canterbury he wrote to his Mother  "I beg of you to send five or three guineas to these poor creatures My cousin" the very worthy Reverend J Hayes  then  second son of James Hayes Esquire Berkeley's amiable protector and director when he went to Eton "and myself have given them all the money that we have but they are very poor still"  Not getting an answer as soon as he wished he risqued a flogging and contrived in company with an equally daring friend to scamper over to Cookham there he sold his little poney  and sent them the money A youth going from Canterbury School to Oxford when Mr Berkeley was about twelve years old he presented him with his watch chain and seal for which being sharply reproved by his Mother he sweetly replied  "Why I am but a boy and he is going to be a man and it must be unpleasant to him not to have a watch and I know he cannot afford to buy one and I can contrive to shift without one"  Such was ever the nature of this lovely young man  Mr Berkeley was from his early youth destined for the Bar where had it pleased God to have spared his life and blessed him with health he would no doubt have reached the  acme  of his profession  Mr Monck Berkeley going one evening to visit his amiable kind friend Mrs Horne then on a visit at her father's the very worthy sensible Philip Burton Esquire that gentleman desired the Bishop and Mrs Horne to tell Dr Berkeley from him  "that he never saw a young man quite so likely to shine eminently at the bar as his son"  and obligingly added  "I have been near fifty years in Westminster Hall and I have very rarely failed in my sentence of those who would succeed and who fail"  It is well known that Mr Burton was a man of very superior understanding and a wonderfully agreeable pleasant companion  for all who heard him speak pronounced him  eminently  qualified to make a distinguished figure unless his very strict ideas of honesty had prevented it In early youth he had been earnestly requested by his Mother when arguing never for the sake of argument  to improve in logic to undertake the  wrong  side of the question lest it might warp his mind He had ever most religiously adhered to this advice and in more advanced years always declared if he lived to speak at the bar which he early determined he would not do until he had completed his twentyeighth year  Mr Berkeley had been often pressed by his learned friends to break this resolution but his constant reply was  "So determined am I to adhere to it that I will not keep my last term at the Temple until the term before"  adding  "if  ever  a man ceases to be a coxcomb or a fool it is surely after having served  four  apprenticeships to folly and nonsense"  he would tell every client that applied to him that if he found his cause to be an unjust one he would desert it  even  in Westminster Hall Mr Berkeley had also firmly resolved never to plead  against  the fatherless the widow or the clergy and always to plead  gratis  for them if their circumstances required it  It has been observed that although Mr Berkeley was  highly  indebted to  what  we commonly call Nature with strict propriety to the God of Nature for a very uncommonly fine understanding quick ready wit and what does not always accompany it a very extraordinary strength and soundness of judgement so as often to occasion persons to remark that he had all the brilliancy of Bishop Berkeley's imagination and all the sound strong judgement of Mr Cherry of whom the great Charles Leslie the celebrated controversial writer used to say he thought God had not  bestowed better judgement on man since the days of Solomon When Mr Berkeley with all his great vivacity in early youth often acted with the supremest caution Mrs Berkeley used to the great diversion of Dr Berkeley to say  "It was a happy thing for her children that she introduced a little LEAD into the family for although peacocks feathers were exquisitely beautiful yet unless tipped with a  little  weight they naturally flew away to the Moon"  Mr Berkeley owed much also to education to principles very early instilled into him to which he professed long before and during his last illness he owed his greatest happiness in  life  his  only  hope in the prospect of  death  until he through the free sovereign grace of God and the rich mercy of Christ arrived by the instrumentality of a most excellent book to assurance of faith feeling the  full force  of that glorious promise of EMANUEL  "  Him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out  "  He was enabled to  trust  to  go  and HAPPILY found as  all true penitents will  a most gracious reception May all true penitents be enabled to make the trial and they will most certainly rejoice through the countless ages of a  blissful  ETERNITY But alas our adored Redeemer himself says  "YE WILL NOT COME UNTO ME THAT YE MAY HAVE LIFE"  The Writer is well aware of the  ridicule contempt c c  that will be  liberally  bestowed on her on account of  many  things in this preface  yet ever bearing in mind the admonition of an eminently pious Mother never to be ashamed of that God who lived who died to redeem her ever remembering his own  emphatic  admonition  "Whosoever shall be ashamed of ME and of My words in this ADULTEROUS and sinful generation of him or  her  shall the Son of Man be ashamed when he cometh in his own glory"  c At the age of seventeen going to spend a few weeks with a near relation her Mother said  "The first thing for which you will be laughed at is going to church on Sunday in the afternoon yet  never  omit it Your Mother has been laughed to scorn for it years ago"  Then the above cited text was repeatedly  enforced  and although the Writer naturally the most shy of human beings amongst strangers always when young on entering the room crowding her little insignificant figure behind the door that nobody might look at her  So as generally to occasion her witty younger sister of course following her into the room when visiting with their Mother to say  "For pity's sake my dear Miss Frinsham do not go into the room looking as if you had stolen your cloaths"  Mrs Berkeley used sadly to lament after her mother's death that  she  was the  eldest  sister  yet the first Sunday of her visit she encountered the loud laugh of ten or eleven gentlemen and ladies for setting off to afternoon prayers The lady at whose house she was on a visit said  "Oh the young lady's Mother has brought her up with  wonderfully  strict notions of God and Religion so I dare say she  will  go"  Go  the young lady certainly did but she never remembers  to have suffered more in her  whole  life than in that  first  struggle in the service of her blessed Master of her own  never dying  soul Living many years in the first company cured that painful timidity Conversing much with learned and good men soon enabled her to become more than a  silent  advocate for the honour of her blessed Master when ridiculed by foolish scoffers insomuch as often to occasion Mr Monck Berkeley to say to his Father and friends  "Few things delight me more than hearing my Mother trim an Infidel Some Deistical fellow begins spouting out his nonsensical blasphemy to  amuse  the companyOn he goes without interruption for I make it a point never to say a word  well  knowing what he is going to meet withAt length down goes my Mother's needlework she begins and in a few words turns the laugh of all the company upon him and the poor wretch never opens his mouth any more the remainder of the evening"  This is a proof of the fulfilment of this promise of Christ to his faithful servants  The Editor at the age of twentytwo was asked by a very near relation of her own a single man of vast fortune universally esteemed one of the first scholars in England  "Why she was not a Papist for the Papists required not the belief of any thing so contrary to reason as the doctrine of the Trinity which he was persuaded she did believe"  It pleased God to enable her to make him a firstrate scholar she an unlettered young woman such an answer as immediately silenced him and astonished the whole of the company that sat at table To God be all the glory This  worthy wight  lived many years never spending near as many hundreds  per annum  as he possessed thousands A few years ago the Editor was called upon to put on an old black lustringhe being gone where his gold cannot follow him and alas he had not sent any of it before him His nephew however has made it fly in all directions in all countries The last time the Editor was abroadat Lisle commonly called Petit Paris all her acquaintance were lamenting she had not arrived a little sooner as her relation had been giving such  êtes  c c    "  I will give you a mouth and wisdom  that all your adversaries shall not be able to gainsay or resist  "  As Mrs Berkeley is not an Eliza Carter or a Mrs Montagu two of her respected old friends but an unlettered female who lost a learned and wise Father when she was eleven years old who had set his heart on cultivating the minds of his daughters had God spared his life until their leaving the school of that throughly amiable accomplished woman the excellent Mrs Sheeles but alas they had been in Queen's Square but one year before he went to hear those blessed words  "Well done thou good and faithful servant"  c as perhaps one of the best the most vigilant parish priests any where to be found even half a century ago for so long has he been removed HE had redde St Paul's Epistles to Timothy and Titus with good effect  In the year the Reverend Dr Dodwell was blessed with a curate who followed the example of Mr Frinsham Mr Ratcliffe fellow of Queen's College Oxford Few days passed without his visiting some house in the parish chiefly the cottages where he examined and instructed the poor children and generally ignorant mother admonishing them if they neglected going to church exhorting them to attend at the altar He was a chearful pleasant unassuming young man He died about two years ago on a college living the county wherein it was situated is not at present recollected but  he  is not forgotten by his Master  for he never suffered sin on any of his parishioners however  high their rank or station  "  unrebuked  "    "He was instant in season and out of season"  c  It is hoped the introduction of a little anecdote concerning the zeal of this worthy gentleman for the salvation of his flock may be excused The wife of Mr  a man of good fortune in every sense of the word  a fine lady  was a little talked of as having a partiality for one of her menservants The excellent vicar took an early opportunity when he knew her husband was absent to call upon her finding her alone he soon began the subject She heard him with seeming attention for some time at length she replied  "Mr Frinsham you may save yourself any farther trouble about  me  for I do  assure  you Sir that I mind what you say no more than the COALS on that fire"  Mr Frinsham mildly replied  "Mrs  I dare say that often during the course of my ministry  I may  have met with many as inattentive hearers as yourself but I must tell you that  you  are the  first  the  only  person who ever told me so"  Then taking up his hat he made a bow and told her he hoped God would in time bring her to a better state of mind He had the mortification to see her some years after  die  as she had  lived  but he had the consolation offered to  watchful  pastors in Ezekiel chapter xxxiii  When the late Earl of Bute took Waltham Place soon after his arrival Mr Frinsham with some other gentlemen  of the neighbourhood made him a visit At taking leave Lord Bute said to Mr Frinsham  "Sir I hope that we shall be good neighbours as I have taken this house  solely  on account of your excellent amiable character"  Perhaps one of the most beautiful letters  It is possible that some of Lord Bute's letters to Mr Frinsham may some time or other be presented to the publick they will serve to shew what Lord Bute  then  was  ever penned was by Lord Bute on the death of as he termed him  "  that dear delightful excellent friend  "  The Peer and the Pastor generally met on the hill or at the vale below every day Mr Frinsham was as witty as he was good in his youth the idol of all his acquaintance as what is termed the fiddle of the company and to his latest day the most cheerful person of a large circle He expired with a smile on his benign countenance without even drawing a single sigh at the age of fiftyfour  It is hoped that the following little tribute of a grateful child to the best of Fathers will be pardoned A few lines shall suffice Not long after his obtaining priest's orders he became curate of Beaconsfield in Bucks to a  poor  man of large fortune but so weak in his understanding that when Mr Frinsham was one Sunday confined with a rash Mr N  attempted  to do the duty which he  could not get through  and  therefore came down and went home  May God have pardoned the wickedness of the Prelate who admitted  such  a  being  into the Church of Christ to get the emoluments of a family living It is  seldom  seen I believe that an almost idiot at  twentyfour  becomes a man of sense at thirtyfour A buck a blood a Newmarket jockey made a priest of the Most High God at twentyfour does often by thirtyfour or fortyfour begin to feel the value of his own and the souls committed to his charge But the Wise King assures us the  "braying in a mortar"  will not make a fool wise Surely in that instance the Presbyterians are wiser than our excellent Church They I believe seldom ordain any man such as their ordination is until thirty Our blessed Master God incarnate began not his own ministry until the age of thirty his precursor John the Baptist not until twentyseven yet our Church wise in every thing else permits poor shatterbrained boys of twentytwo and an half to go and solemnly  lie to the Holy Ghost  see Ordination Office that they may get forty pounds  per annum  and scamper after a pack of hounds  The living being then on sale Mr Frinsham much wished his father to purchase it for him the old gentleman stood for about a hundred and fifty or two hundred pounds The Principal and Fellows of Magdalene College Oxford hearing of it instantly paid down the sum demanded and of course for ever precluded Mr Frinsham from becoming rector where he was only not adored as curate so powerfully had his persuasions wrought on the people of that place that the wheeler the blacksmith the millener yea every trader quitted their occupation to attend Wednesday Friday and Saints'day prayers so much as frequently to occasion passengers enquiring if there was any great wedding that so many persons were coming out of the church  Mr Frinsham being what was called a Tory and all his own and his lady's considerable relations who could prefer him being Whigs he never obtained any more important preferment than the vicarage of White Waltham a parish of sixteen miles round in Windsor Forest of which his very learned and worthy successor the Reverend Dr Dodwell Canon of Salisbury and Archdeacon of Berks said he never made fifty pounds a year Thus are many excellent ministers of Christ provided for in  this  world enough to make them take up the language of the great apostle St Paul and say  "If in  this life only  we have hope in Christ we are of ALL men most miserable  Mr Frinsham used frequently to say  "I hope I am humbly thankful to God for a very comfortable fortune but I thank him still more for that temper that had I been an almsman with five pounds a year I am sure I should have been an  happy  man"  His unworthy Daughter feels herself much more favoured by Providence in inheriting her Father's disposition than the comfortable fortune he bequeathed to her humbly thankful she trusts for both blessings unmerited by her Her Mother used frequently to say  "Surely  thou art  the happiest little creature under the sunas like your dear Father in temper as in face Thou must meet with a wonderful lot in life if thou doest not go contented and joyous to thy grave"  The Editor trusts by becoming daily more resigned to the BLESSED WILL of the ALLWISE disposer of ALL events to feel that her Mother judged aright She has ever delighted in being able to apply to herself that pleasant line of Mr Addison's in one of his beautiful hymns set to music by her old master Mr Sheeles  "Nor is the  least  a cheerful heart  "Which tastes those gifts with joy"  "  Mr Frinsham perhaps naturally the most contentedtempered of the fallen children of Adam and the most hospitable although he wished not for a larger income wished for a larger better house in which to entertain his numerous friends and acquaintance Rich and poor high and low all ate and drank at his house The vicarage house at White Waltham was literally a very large old barn with small rooms on each side The kitchen however was not very small and was payed with curious Roman bricks which might have consoled his grandson Mr Monck Berkeley an enthusiastical antiquary  An answer of Mr Frinsham to a letter written by his relation Sir  to Mr Frinsham offering him a living of  one hundred pounds per annum  with a good house if he would  promise  faithfully and MIGHT BE DEPENDED UPON  Mr Frinsham in his answer to that letter says  "It is  as  impossible that Ministry should  always  act disinterestedly for the good of the nation as that they should not  sometimes  do so No earthly power therefore should ever make me yield such a promise to  any  Minister of  any  Monarch were my own Father Minister I shall therefore contentedly remain in my old clayed barn until Providence removes me to the realms of bliss"  Lord Bute used personally as the Editor well remembers when playing cards spending the evening under that very humble roofthe top of Mr Frinsham's wig just touched the middle beamto say  "My dear friend if ever I have power the first man on earth for whom I will exert it shall be yourself"  And breakfasting with his lady at Mr Frinsham's the morning he quitted Waltham Place he looked out of one of the sashes at his late dwelling saying  "I grieve to leave it Mr  might if he pleased have enabled me to continue but I hope we shall soon meet again"  They never did on earth Mr Frinsham dying before Lord Bute returned from Scotland May they have met in a future state    to vote always as Lord H  should direct him is still carefully preserved His soninlaw the late as independent and spirited Dr Berkeley Prebendary of Canterbury used to say it merited to be written in letters of gold Such were the WHIG ministers of George the Second  It is somewhat remarkable that Mr Frinsham never met with any serious affliction through life The loss of his beautiful mother when he was five years old was so supplied by an excellent housekeeper of his father's that he scarcely felt it and the death of his worthy father at the age of eightyone not long before his own death was an event to be expected at that age although he died as before mentioned by casualty Mr Frinsham was interred close to his honoured fatherinlaw Francis Cherry Esquire within the railed burial place in Shottesbrooke churchyard He used to say  "I am God's creature he sent me into the world  when  he pleased and he will take me out  how  he pleases and I am sure it will be at the  best  time in the  best  way"  He dreaded nothing in life so much as losing the best of wives and the being left with two little girls whom he humoured in  every thing  not in itself wrong  Some proofs how much Mr Berkeley was indebted to education may be gathered from his amiable humility as a lad a youth and a man when it is considered that he was astonishingly proud whilst a child  When Mr Monck Berkeley was aged three years and two months his father went to reside at Acton near London a large living presented to him by his ONLY patron through life the excellent Archbishop Secker and which he so nobly resigned to a man who after making him repair the tithe barn and letting him have about five hundred pounds' worth of new furniture and fixtures for an hundred and eighty poundsamongst which was a harpsichord that cost Bishop Berkeley seventy guineas for  four pounds  Mrs Berkeley objected but the Doctor with his wonted generosity said  "he hated disputes among clergy"  and therefore permitted him to have it at his own priceafter suffering the house to stand empty from Michaelmas to the end of Aprilcame upon him with a long bill for dilapidations and protested a draught drawn on him by Dr Berkeley for the money for the furniture This naturally exasperated the too generous mind that had been the actual presenter of the living for no power on earth no honour could have compelled any one to resign it But Dr Berkeley one day asking the Archbishop if his Grace meant he should resign Action on becoming Prebendary of Canterbury his reply was  "Don't be in haste You must talk one day or other with Lord Hardwicke about it"  Before any conference with Lord Hardwicke the good Archbishop died and the nice honour of Dr Berkeley without ever even seeing Lord Hardwick made him resign it to a cousingerman of his Lordshipa very different man from his  noble relation A very intimate friend of Dr Berkeley's the excellent  throughly  Honourable and Reverend Mr Hamilton of Taplow felt such resentment that he conjured Dr Berkeley to post the  man  every where Mr Hamilton had one excellent rule he never would call any man a gentleman if in any instance he had acted unlike a gentleman  In a very few days after the arrival of the family at Acton Mrs Berkeley heard a most violent stamping and screaming of her then only child On enquiry into the cause it was found to be that Master Berkeley would not go to bed up the back stairs  Mrs Berkeley  "What ails him  Servant  "Why you know Madam there is only one staircase at Bray But Master Berkeley says there are two here and he observes that my Master and you and all visitors go up the great staircase and  only  the servants up the back stairs and that he is as good a gentleman as his Papa although he is not so old and that he will not go up the back stairs"  An order was immediately made and strictly adhered to that he was not for a  whole  week a long time for a creature of three feet high to presume in the day time to go up or down the great staircase to the dressingroom to his Mamma to read or play  When about four years old Mr Berkeley received a smart trimming for a speech to a once famous apothecary in London who had retired to Acton Mr Sawtell whose appearance was rather against him He attended Dr Berkeley when unwell and Charles Stanley Monck of Grange Gormonde Esquire ill about four months at Dr Berkeley's with the whooping cough which he brought from Eton School and communicated to  The word  poor  is introduced on account of his very severe sufferings for more than seven months Dr Berkeley having never been at any school had unluckily escaped all those disorders which children together with many other benefits generally get at good schools The whoopingcough is a tremendous disorder indeed to adultsDr Berkeley could not exist without going into fresh air every three or four days It cost him more than an hundred guineas The agonies suffered by the Editor during some parts of that time were exceedingly great Laughing constantly brought on a violent fit of coughing Innumerable were the times that the Editor has sat trembling with anguish expecting that her beloved partner would expire hanging on the window his only hope of relief being to throw up the sash and hang out at it gasping for breath Mr James Hamilton and the as  witty Samuel Horne  spent the summer with him Mrs Berkeley used to protest she would  turn them both out of doors  if they would not bottle up their wit saying  "she would send for two mutes"  She used seriously to conjure them not to make Dr Berkeley laugh None can laugh at this account who has ever had the distress of seeing an adult under the paroxysms of the whooping cough An old friend of Mrs Berkeley's more advanced in life than Dr Berkeley often fell senseless on the floor the late Rev Mr Chapman the beloved friend of the late Dr Booth Dean of Windsor  poor Dr Berkeley and his little boy This proud descendant of fallen Adam thus accosted him  "Sir if you were ever to stay here to dinner you must dine in the servants' hall for you cannot  be fit company for my Papa"  Dr Berkeley ready to sink with shame flew to Mrs Berkeley saying  "Surely that chit is the proudest little being on earth I must now really ask the poor man one day to dinner to shew that he has not heard any thing of the kind from you or me"  Mr Berkeley was always told that a gentleman must never do mean or shabby actions He  reasoned  on the matter and in early infancy drew such  wonderful  conclusions as those just mentioned  That both Mr Berkeley and his Brother were in  very very  early youth exceedingly proud is absolutely certain in their different ways and that both became remarkably humble by their Mother's adhering closely to the directions given to parents in that wonderful book the Proverbs of Solomon is equally certain  The exquisite loveliness of Mr Monck Berkeley's nature led him from an infant to look with pity on all below him but his dear Brother naturally looked with contempt One day when very young going in the coach with their Mother to Marlow as they passed a remarkably small meanlooking cottage at the foot of the hill he exclaimed  "My dear Mamma look there did you ever see so miserable a looking hut What kind of  creatures  must they be that  live in it"  Mrs Berkeley threw terror into her countenance and said  "ROBERT what have I just heard you say Do you dare to despise any of your fellow creatures or any meanlooking habitation Have not you often redde in the Bible what our blessed Saviour said 'The foxesNow go on he did sohave holes and the birds of the air have nests but the Son of Man has not where to lay his head"    "Why did he come upon earth"    "To save sinners"    "Yes such a poor proud little wretch as you And are you not very naughty to say what you have just said"    "Yes indeed Mamma and if God will forgive me  this once  I will never do so again whilst I live"  Once passing a little chimneysweeper about his own size with the sootbag at his back he coiled up his nose and said  "What a poor dirty little creature it is"  His Mother acted terror as before and asked him  "How he came to be so wicked and if he knew how it came to pass that HE was not that poor little sweep and little sweep Master Robert Berkeley"  He replied  "No"    "Should you have liked it"    "No"    "Do you think if God Almighty had asked that little boy whether he would be Dr Berkeley's son or the sweep's that he would not have chosen to have been born a gentleman that Christ died to redeem from hell that little boy as well as himself or one of the King's little sons that as  he had not even the merit of choosing to come to Dr Berkeley's instead of to old LaLooe the nick name of a chimney sweeper who ought now to enjoy a very good fortune in Bucks if he had money to contend for it he ought to to be humble as a little dove instead of being proud as Lucifer and despising those whom Providence without  any  goodness of his had placed below him"  He wept and said  "It was very wicked indeed but if God would pardon it he would never despise dirty children again"  The worthy woman who brought him up was remarkably cleanly and had made him so He was exceedingly careful to keep his word for if he were told of any thing that would offend God no persuasion of the most eloquent could cause him to do it Such admonotions until he grew towards manhood were heard by his lovely brother as they are by most other children to use a cant phrase  "go in at one ear and out at the other"  The early ripe for glory are generally soon removed from this vale of tears To use the beautiful language of Dean Hickes's Reformed Devotions  "No matter how late the fruit be gathered  "If it still go on growing better  "No matter how soon it fall from the tree  "If not blown down before it be ripe"  Mr Berkeley and his brother were whilst children always made not to touch but take off their hats to the poorest labourer in the village who saluted them if ever they saw an old man or woman with a burden of wood or leazed corn to run to open the gate to let them through They were made to treat the servants with the utmost civility never daring to  order  them to do any thing being always told that they were not their servants but their Father's therefore they must always say  "Pray John or Thomas get me so or so"  By incessant attention and the utmost vigilance their pride was kept under and in due time by God's grace eradicated  It was no small delight to his Mother on his arrival in England at the age of near twentytwo that she could scarcely go into any small shop in Canterbury without hearing from the master or mistress  "Oh Madam what a fine young gentleman Mr Berkeley is so condescending he met my poor son stopped and asked him how he did and hoped he went on well in the world Who would have thought he would have done him the honour to remember him so many years"  Let it be remarked here that Ecclesiastical Bodies do  some  good At Canterbury the Dean and Prebendaries pay for the education of fifty tradesmen's sons find them books c until they are eighteen or nineteen and then if they  wish it raise a subscription to send them to one of the Universities Many other cathedrals have similar charitable institutions This produces a sort of honourable equality as it enables the sons of chairmen footmen c when ordained to associate with their superiors in birth perhaps not in learning  Mr Berkeley's amiability was the more remarked as he quitted the King's School at the age of twelve and his Father removed his family to his living in West Kent the year following and returned not to settle in Canterbury until the end of the year when it became his turn to take the offices A good old shopman one day said to Mrs Berkeley  "Ah Madam what a charming man Mr Berkeley is He was  galloping  towards Margate looking like a  young Lord  when one of our poor old neighbours was creeping along He suddenly stopped his horse drew up to the causeway and asked him who he was and if he was comfortable He took out his purse and not finding much silver bade his servant lend him half a crown which he gave to the poor man and told him to call upon him if ever he wanted any thing"  adding his eyes filling with tears  "Lord bless him where will you find another young gentleman going galloping on his pleasure that will think so of the poor"  It proved to be the famous old Newscarrier of whom the fine print was sold some years ago in Canterbury  The poor and distressed were ever the grand objects of his tender care When at St Andrew's one night at the play the poor man who acted the king in the tragedy fainted away and it had nearly been a  real  tragedy as he had several small children On enquiry it was found to be from inanition  The next day the Editor sent her faithful affectionate trusty aged Scotch servant the excellent Betty Russel to enquire particularly into the state of these heroes and heroines of the stage The worthy woman soon returned saying  "Welladay Madam I never saw such an  unka  sight in all my life there was the poor  crator  who is to be queen to night the king's wife that fainted last night with her head dressed all in flowers and ribbons and a fine crown and a child sucking at her breast quite empty it had not a drop of milk in itshe had had nothing but water all dayoh it was an  unka  sight to see her head so fine her breast hanging like a wet leather glove"  That uncommonly honest worthy woman Elizabeth Russel met with most kind charitable friends on Dr Berkeley's family leaving St Andrew's in the amiable excellent and by them highly respected Dr Adamson senior Kirk Minister of St Andrew's and his worthy very charitable lady The Editor used to delight to send her a guinea in a letter to Dr Adamson until twice  some  postmaster stopped it  Mr Berkeley on finding that to be the case posted off to his tutor the very amiable now Reverend Mr James Bruce beseeching him to go and relieve him on his account On Mrs Berkeley's saying  "Why did not you go yourself instead of routing out Mr Bruce"  He wisely replied  "My dear Mother the woman was exceedingly beautiful and my going might have injured her fame which I hear although an actress is unsullied So now you know why I got Bruce to go"  Mr Berkeley had certainly no offensive pride discoverable to those who knew him most intimately for what is usually termed Family Pride is surely improperly so called A man that is descended from a King rather than from a cobler from a Hero rather than from a Huckster may feel grateful to his Maker Mr Berkeley's Father felt it his Grandfather felt it and perhaps he felt it on becoming a Bishop Some friend said  "Your Lordship must now give purple liveries"  To which the good Bishop replied  "No Sir My becoming a Bishop will not make me give up what the domestics of my ancestors have worn for centuries"  Accordingly his episcopal livery was the yellow green coat worne by the servants of his honourable relations the Earl of Berkeley Lord Berkeley of Stratton his Brothers c with royal  ie  red purple waistcoats c and the servants of his Sons he always made wear the crimson waistcoat c that he might not give up his family livery Dr Berkeley's coach being to be new painted the coachmaker said  "To be sure Sir you will have a cypher instead of your coat of arms It is all the fashion"  "That may be Sir but if you please put on my coat It is an  old one  to be sure The cypher is very well for Nabobs and Planters to save them trouble"  It was a great diversion when Mr Berkeley was seventeen or eighteen to a lovely young lady whose death Mr Berkeley lamented in a most beautiful elegy printed but never sold to wink on Mrs Berkeley and say  "Aye one day or other  Berkeley will marry a girl with an hundred thousand pounds and change his name to Hickenbottom"  Vide Kit Smart He used to storm and say  "Harriet hold your tongue I will not change my name for a million"  Mr Addison says  "Ancient family is a feather but it is a  feather  that no man possessed of ever disdained to stick in his cap"  When the vile treatise on Education written by that learned Atheist the late Lord Kaimes made its appearance it was immediately in every hand When Mr Berkeley came to the part where Lord Kaimes speaks of the Eton  Montem  he stormed violently indeed he felt  l'esprit du corps  so violently as to amuse all his friends He assured his Father and the gentlemen of the agreeable society of Cookham above described that had they been educated at Eton they would feel equal indignation His mother assured him that men of fortyseven were rarely as irritable as youths of seventeen to which Mr Berkeley replied  "Well Madam I can tell you at what page of the book you will throw it by and not read one line more"  She laughing asked  "If Lord Kaimes had abused dear Mrs Sheeles's school"  He replied  "Much worse than that I assure you my dear Madam with  all your calmness  you will be ready to throw it into the fire"  Mrs Berkeley requested to be informed but her Son politely declined it saying  "No read on my dear Madam"  It is certain that when she  came to the page where Lord Kaimes says  "I would advise you to be of the Christian religion because it is or it happens to be the religion of the country where you were born"  Mrs Berkeley verified her Son's prediction for she never thought it worth while to go on with such a wretch on Education His Lordship's Treatise on Husbandry is an excellent work  The following anecdote of that dreadful Atheist may be depended on as a fact It was related to the Editor by a lady incapable of forging it to whom it was related by an eye and ear witness of the scene When a divorce has actually taken place it is no scandal to speak of the divorced female as having lost her character Lord Kaimes's daughter was married to Mr Heron a gentleman of very large fortune in Scotland of most excellent character and uncommonly amiable gentle manners say all who have the happiness of his acquaintance The Editor was well acquainted with the elegant worthy Major Heron his younger brother when that favourite regiment of Canterbury families of fashion the Scotch Greys were quartered at Canterbury This lady was at length detected and gently and quietly sent home to her WORTHY father with a letter from her excellent injured husband stating her conduct She reached her father's house in the afternoon In the evening after tea Lord Kaimes walked up and down the room in silence but appeared greatly agitated  At length he exclaimed  "Good God child how could you act thus How could you bring me to such shameful disgrace"    "Why my Lord you have always told me that there was no other world that the idea of an hereafter was all a JUGGLE of knaves and priests to keep fools in order and as I am not to be called to any account but by the worldI preferred Mr  to my husband"  This silenced his Lordship he said not a single word more and soon quitted the room Mr Heron her much injured husband has for many years enjoyed great felicity with a lady very differently educated from the daughter of Lord Kaimes May he long enjoy it  In a few days after reading the book above mentioned when the social meeting happened to be at Dr Berkeley's just before tea the very learned Mr M  either took off the slab behind him or out of his pocket a newspaper neither that amiable gentleman nor the Editor can recollect which if it was Dr Berkeley's paper it was the St James's Chronicle as he was always partial to that paper on account of his old fellow collegian Mr Colman and began reading a letter to Lord Kaimes concerning his very severe attack on Eton School proving to the learned Lord that he was totally ignorant of what he had been so grosly abusing Every one admired it exceedingly Mr M  said  "Why Berkeley this letter must delight you prodigiously surely Eton is nobly vindicated indeed The  Writer is quite of your spirit"  Mr Berkeley replied  "To be sure every man educated there must be indignant to find himself and his friends styled  Highwaymen  "  Mr M  proceeded to read on and said turning to Mrs Berkeley  "Why I believe Berkeley must have written this letter himself"  To which Mrs Berkeley replied  "HE write such a letter poor dear soul poor as I am I would give a thousand pounds that he could three years hence write such a letter as that"  To which Dr Berkeley added  "Aye poor fellow I hope if he is not idle he may  in time  write as well as this Eton champion"  About seven years afterwards Mr Berkeley sitting conversing with his Mother in her dressingroom said  "My dear Mother do you remember before we went to Scotland a letter that M  redde us out of the newspaper exposing Lord Kaimes's attack upon Eton School"  Mrs Berkeley  "Yes very well  Mr B  "Do you remember his saying jocularly to you that he believed that it was written by me  Mrs B  "Yes  Mr B  "And do you remember what answer you made  Mrs B  "Yes that I would freely give a thousand pounds that you were capable of writing that letter  Mr B  "Well my dear Madam perhaps it may now give you some little pleasure to hear that your  Bairn  did write that letter and that Lord Kaimes answered it acknowledging that he had been in an error concerning the Eton  Montem  adding that he must have been an hasty writer to publish such a censure on an ancient custom sanctioned by  such  a man as Lord Camden educated there who always makes a point of attending and being ROBBED  Whilst this sheet was in the press the Montem at Eton was celebratedIt was a fine  very  fine sight that the Editor could not now alas have witnessed She was twice called upon by a throughly polite young gentlemana most active zealous friend of the Captain who on his entering the room at ten o'clock most elegantly apologized for having called before so early as eightThis young gentleman's conduct encourages the Editor to persevere in her assertion from seventeen years old  "That the young men youths even the lads of Eton School are the GENTLEMEN of the nation"  Dr Berkeley used frequently to tell his son when admonishing him as a youth to be like a gentleman wellbred  "Why child  every nobleman  is  not  a  gentleman  "  To use the elegant language of the late Dr Berkeley in a Charitysermon  "  few  can give the rich man's largesse ALL may give the "  widow's mite  "  The very polite receiver of the Editor's mite on her enquiry she learned was Mr Marsh of Lee in Kent If he has parents she congratulates them on having  such  a son May he be spared to them May they never suffer as the Editor has done and must in some few sad moments ever do until she meets her angelichearted son in the realms of bliss  as Lord Kaimes terms it of ten guineas and of late years his Majesty and the Queen How any  man of any country could suppose that the sons of men of the highest rank and most antient families in England would be permitted to act as he describes is marvellous"  Mr Berkeley from the time he went to Eton used very acutely to learn his Mother's opinion of any little thing he was going to publish in a Newspaper or Magazine without her even suspecting him as the author by saying  "It was written by an Eton boy of his acquaintance"  lest as he told her when he grew up maternal partiality might tempt her to think it clever when it was not so or the same tenderness might tempt her to wish it suppressed lest it should expose him to ridicule  On Mr Berkeley's  printing  his "Maria or The Generous Rustic" written when he was only seventeen the copies were sent down to him One day after dinner he went to his study and brought a copy of it in sheets saying  "He would read something that he hoped might amuse his Father and the ladies"  He began and Dr Berkeley who had eyes like a lynx seeing it in sheets immediately exclaimed  "Good Heavens child what have you done This is written by you Surely you have not gone and published some nonsense that will ruin your character as a writer before you are a man"    "Why  I  have never published any thing with my name yet"  Mrs Berkeley  motherlike  in agony to think that her idol had injured his fame as a writer began lamenting his temerity When the indignation of Dr Berkeley and the lamentations of Mrs Berkeley were a  little  subsided because they were almost out of breath he said in the sweetest voice and gentlest manner  "Well I am  very  sorry you are all so angry with me I have done what I could to  please  you all I have made the Marquis  learned  to please my Father and I have made Maria  pious  to gratify my Mother"  Mrs Frinsham here interposed in her  wonted way  "My dear  I  think it very beautiful and I question whether  either  of  them  could have written such a book at your age I am sure I could not Indeed I am not QUITE sure I could do it now that I am more than double your age"  Mrs Frinsham has a wonderful fund of true humour which breaks forth on every occasion before the  very few  with whom she will be intimately acquainted being perhaps the most reserved of human beings now that Lord  is dead an excellent understanding very highly cultivated by reading the best authors in  various  languages and to sum up the character in few words as it is frequently done by the grateful Editor perhaps the best woman on earth now that her excellent Mother is removed to heaven  Matters being a little quieted by Mrs Frinsham's interposition Mr Berkeley said to his Father  "Well Sir although  it is  printed  I would not presume to  publish  it without your permission and if you disapprove it I will burn every copy but one Indeed I have burnt a vast deal many months ago before I printed it All the Marquis's  séjour  in England and Wales his remarks on English manners customs c I have destroyed Indeed I have burnt near five times as much as I have printed and if you wish it I will burn that"  Here there was a triple cry of  "Oh no"  But Dr Berkeley asked  "My poor simple child why would you not let me look it over and correct it"    "Alas my dear Sir I knew what would be its fate You would have made a new book"  A very just remark Dr Berkeley never could correct He could write admirably as the world has seen but any thing sent him to correct he always remade generally perhaps for the betterbut then as his Son through life used to tell him  "Sir the book is yours not the man's whose name it bears"    "But if you KNEW that why not let your Mother read and correct it"    "Why my dear Sir for fear of getting my Mother into a scrape for not shewing it to you"  Uncorrected as it was it has been so admired that seven years ago half a guinea was paid for a miserable thumbed dirty copy only to be found in those banes of industry cleanliness c c a little countrytown circulating library Mr Berkeley was often pressed to permit a  second edition but his constant reply was  "  No never whilst my name is Berkeley  I was a  great  fool ever to let there be one but I was young and of course foolish"  That there are great beauties in Maria is generally allowed and that it has some considerable errors is certain The calling the idea of a Marquis even a French Marquis marrying a little farmer's daughter however worthy being highly objectionable  "  one of the absurd maxims of the world  "  is what at twenty or before Mr Berkeley would have expunged And on his Mother's pointing out to him how much better it would have been to have made her the daughter of a reduced officer he saw the force of it but replied  "  You  know my dear Madam that by means of the nunneries in Popish countries every peasant's daughter living in the neighbourhood of a monastery can on very easy terms have as good an education as a Duke's can"  The styling the wretched consort of the Baron D'Arandar his Wife instead of his Lady was improper and on his Mother's expressing her astonishment that he who from infancy was wellbred and elegant could be guilty of such a vulgarism he replied  "Mr  a gentleman then very intimate with Dr Berkeley always ridiculed those who said Lord and Lady  or Mr  and his Lady"  This gentleman long before it became fashionable was a great advocate for Equality  Mrs Berkeley regretted the melancholy catastrophe of the amiable Marquis and the noblesouled Maria  After Mr Berkeley's return to England he came one day to his Mother and enquiring if she had a couple of hours to spare sat down and began to read in manuscript "The Spanish Memoirs" telling her as they appeared on the stage who the chief actors were for Mr Berkeley in every novel or poem celebrated or stigmatized some real existing character thus the hero of "Love and Nature" bears the title of Westmorland Mr Berkeley having always respected the character of the present Earl of Westmorland for his spirited wise conduct in quitting a great School where he  then  could not learn any thing for one where he could and did learn very much and for other parts of his character The late Earl of  whose pride whose cruelty to very near relations Mr Berkeley from a youth detested is held up to contempt to hatred in the person of the Duke D'Aranda as he told his Mother When he had concluded he desired to hear his Mother's sentiments of the work She told him she liked it very well untill she came to the murder of Don Frederic  "Murder"  he exclaimed  "My dear Madam you have not been listening with your usual attention to reading Why he is not murdered He is cast away and drowned"  Mrs Berkeley  "Well and what is that but murdering him as you did the poor Marquis de Clerville and Maria Indeed worse for you leave this poor heroine alive to mourn to the end of the chapter How can YOU practise such cruelties"  Mr B  "Well my dear Madam I am glad you do not disapprove any part but that  innocent murder  I shall do myself the honour to send you a copy as soon as it is printed"  Mrs B  "And I shall certainly do  myself  the  honour  to tuck it in between the bars of that grate and  burn it  "  Mr B  "Burn it my dear Madam No no I am sure you will not serve me so"  Mrs B  "Yes I solemnly protest I will without reading  one  line of it You know I hate the idea of encouraging melancholy on the mind I have often told you that with Mr Addison in one of his beautiful hymns in the Spectator  All the Hymns c in the Spectator as has been already noticed p clxix were many years ago set to music by the late Mr Sheeles and dedicated to Lady Albinia and Lady Mary Bertie daughters of the late Duke of Ancaster both educated at Mrs Sheeles's school Lady Mary had a pleasanter honour than being a Duke's daughter being mother to Bertie Greathead Esq  I have always delighted that  I  could subscribe to that lovely line  "Nor is the least a chearful heart  "Which tastes those gifts with joy"  The next day Mr Berkeley and his Mother dining alone after the cloth was removed he drew out the book and said  "He had brought the conclusion of the Spanish Memoirs to read to her"  Mrs Berkeley said  "She would not hear another tittle of them"  He conjured her She rose to go He said  "You will catch your death The fire I am sure does not burn well in the drawingroom"  Mrs Berkeley being resolute got to the door He pursued and taking hold of her gown said  "Well suppose Don Frederic is not dead will you stay and hear"  Mrs B  "Aye but he is dead and I will go"  Mr B  "Will you stay if I solemnly declare he is alive"  Mrs B  "Yes because I know you will not deceive me"  Those who have redde the Spanish Memoirs know how beautifully he is  redivivus  Mr Berkeley added  "You have made me spoil it but I cannot bear to do any thing that  you  do not approve"  It has been mentioned above that Mr Berkeley was indebted to Nature or rather to the God of Nature for a most lovely disposition A very shocking proof that a  nature  perhaps equally amiable although not blessed with as  strong an understanding may by a bad education degenerate into horrid cruelty of the meanest kind is now daily seen in the Honourable  It was a common remark of Bishop Berkeley that the strongest wine if ill kept became the sourest vinegar  The Editor was asked within a few months if she was not acquainted with  to which replying in the affirmative the gentleman answered  "Then you know the  meanest  scoundrel upon earth for he is now actually employed as a CRIMP"  She lamented that a creature  so  lovely in very early youth should by bad education have become so horridly so shamefully depraved One or two instances of the sweetness the delicacy of his mind when a child shall be related  A very honest old woman who had lived many years at Lord  's his father's and had the care of him from his birth dressed quite in the old style of  wise  servants fifty years ago therefore looked a little oldfashioned about thirty years ago Lady W  who visited his mother often used to laugh at this little man about the cut of nurse's cap c Children should never be teazed it injures never corrects their tempers It is not meant to do it it only serves to shew the low wit of old simpletons This hurt his then amiable heart so much that when as children usually are she conveyed her charge to the eatingroom  whilst she dined he used to say  "My dear nurse when you have opened the door slip behind it for fear that illnatured woman Lady W  should see you and laugh at you and make me cry"  One day when he was barely eight years old Dr Berkeley happening to be visiting at Lord  's Lady  as ignorant ladies are apt to do began railing against the university of Oxford The next time Lady  saw the Editor she said  "I must tell you a remark of your little favourite  Your coach was hardly driven from the door when he came and said 'Surely my dear Mamma when you abused Oxford so violently you had quite forgot that Mr afterwards Dr Berkeley had been educated there a great many years and must know it well"  Dr Berkeley was then about twentysix years old and had not long quitted that excellent university where to be sure young fools if not  properly  placed may fall into mischief as in the army the navy and the merchant's or banker's countinghouse  Dr Berkeley used every possible argument that a man of his sense could devise to persuade Lord  to send Mr  to Dr Glasse at Harrow underr whose care a few years before he being consulted by the two Dowager Countesses had been placed the late not the last Earl of Barrymore and the present Earl of Massareen and his  brothers the Honourable Messrs Skeffington Dr Berkeley was desired by the ladies to fix the salary The two peers paid each four hundred pounds a year they had horses kept for them the others paid one hundred But Lady  after deliberating some time declared she  dreaded  her son's being made  too  religious if he went to Dr Glasse She lived to feel  bitterly  feel the direful want of religion in two of her sons The eldest immediately on his father's death turning her out of the house in town and the crimp merchant out of the villa near town and had not the very worthy Countess of H  d then going out of town to make a visit in the North kindly lent hers she must have taken a lodging Lady  was the most indulgent mother in the world she attended to her children's food their physic their warm cloathing c but she left the care of their souls toSATAN and HE was not wanting in his attentions One of them had naturally a good understanding but neither Lord nor Lady  were equal to the task of directing it aright nor by any means equal to the still much harder task of cultivating and directing weak Minds Poor Ladyshe lived to  feel  the threat of the Wise King  sorely  verified  "A child left to himself bringeth his MOTHER to shame  Proverbs xix chap  "  which seems to imply that in those  ignorant unenlightened  times the  care of sons devolved entirely in the early part of life on the MOTHER The very sensible Lord Halifax in his Advice to a Daughter speaks excellently on this subject This book must become very scarce since a very learned gentleman about a year ago assured the Editor he had never even  heard  of such a book It is pity that more fathers do not put it early into the hands of their daughters It might contribute greatly in preventing husbands being obliged to exhibit many unhappy creatures at Doctors Commons and the House of Lords Between the Wise King and the Wise Peer if both were duly studied young gentlemen and young ladies might certainly be very different beings from what many in the present time are  Solomon when he says  "Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is old he will not depart from it"  does by no means imply that he shall not through life depart from it he departed lamentably from it himself but having as we well know received an excellent education from his pious preceptor Nathan the prophet he returned into the paths of virtue and piety before his death The late Archdeacon of Berkshire the very learned Dr Dodwell in an excellent sermon on  "One man in a thousand have I found"  c told his audience that probably that great King owed the salvation of his soul to the admonitions of his beloved friend the son of Nathan who certainly in those times when Monarchs were absolutely  arbitrary  "put his life in his hand to save the soul of his sovereign by admonishing him to return to the paths of piety"  It was an high act of friendship in the late excellent S  t  z one of the Gentlemen of the Bedchamber to a King who reigned over these realms not  quite  a century ago to admonish his master frequently of the heinous sin of adultery To do the British Prince justice although he did not like the Jewish Prince reform he never resented the liberty taken The nickname of this gentleman before that of Methodist had like Aaron's rod swallowed up all others was Praying S  t  z He  prayed  on earth he is now  praising  in heaven  So terrifying is the idea of being styled a Methodist become of late that within these few weeks the Editor who never was in a Methodist meeting but once in her life about twentyfive years ago with a large party at Canterbury to hear some dull abuse from that accomplished old hypocrite John Wesley advising a young gentleman to read a small portion of the Bible every day to his servants replied  "Oh my dear Madam I should be reckoned a Methodist if it was known that I did it and that would be  sad  you know"  How wretched must those be who stand thus in awe of mortal man How happy are they who fear nought  but God That fear in due time will lead to  "perfect love which"  as St John says  "casteth out fear for fear hath torment"  To attempt to do justice to Mr Monck Berkeley's gratitude to many noble relations friends and connexions from his first entrance into what is called  life  would require abilities far superior to those of an almost dying female by whom he had been taught from infancy that he had no  right  to expect any thing but what is usual the common decent civilities of life from any but his Parents that every thing beyond that was to be repaid by gratitude as more than his due  His gratitude to the eminently learned Professor Hunter of St Andrew's in offering Dr Berkeley to become himself Mr Berkeley's tutor if Dr Berkeley did not entirely approve of Mr Bruce an  eleve  of Mr Hunter was through life gratefully remembered by him but Dr Berkeley found the Professor's character of Mr Bruce to be perfectly just Dr Berkeley accordingly asked Mr Bruce the value of his  whole  time desired him to dismiss all his other pupils and devote himself entirely to the care of Mr Berkeley which he did for a considerable time until the arrival of his dear friend Mr Grimston who came on Mr Berkeley's account and entered at St Andrew's and an old intimate Eton friend of Mr Berkeley's in the same form with him there Being all as it is termed reading the same books they could  not interfere and Mr Berkeley amiably wishing to benefit Mr Bruce whom he exceedingly loved requested his Father to permit him to become tutor to those two gentlemen only from both of whom he received a large salary which enabled him a few years after to enter at Emanuel College Cambridge under the protection of Dr Berkeley's much loved and respected friend the celebrated and worthy Dr Farmer  Mr Berkeley's gratitude through life to those who instructed him was uniform He used to say  "If  I would not  learn  that  was not  their  fault"  He used always to boast to his Father  "Well Sir  idle  as  you  may think me I can assert with strictest truth that I never have once bowed at Professor Hill's Hunter's or indeed at any Professor's lectures"  An explanation being requested of the word  bowing  it was thus given  "Why if any poor fellow has been a little idle and is not prepared to speak when called upon by the Professor he gets up and makes a respectful bow and sits down again"  Mr Berkeley's friendship for his very learned tutor the Reverend Mr Green on whose sole account he was by his Father sent to Magdalene Hall rather than to his own beloved Christ Church was very great Mr Berkeley considered him as the most active and vigilant of tutors who would  force  young men to learn whether so disposed or  not and the great care he took of their morals devoting almost the whole of his leisure time to the common room  Mr Berkeley was blest with a wonderful sagacity in discerning characters and often exhibiting them to the diversion of his friends even when the persons whose characters he drew were present He used frequently to say to his Father and Aunt  "Now I will treat you with an exhibition of my Mother last night at Mrs  's rout"  and then proceed generally saying  "Well to be sure  my  Mother is a woman by herself for I believe the Almighty never formed any thing before her or ever will any thing after her like herself The whole world cannot make her say a thing she does not mean make her answer a question she does not choose to answer nor visit any body she does not choose to visit unless once or twice where my Father has interposed his ROYAL AUTHORITY then she reluctantly sets off"  This latter part arose from Mrs Berkeley's resolution through life never to visit any cook housemaid c who had been kind enough to live with a gentleman six or seven years before she was sanctioned from Doctors Commons to step into the coach and six and sit at the head of the table and be caressed by all the  amiable  virtuous dames in the neighbourhood Mrs Berkeley is by no means one of those styled by Mr Addison  "  the outrageously virtuous  "  tout au contraire  and her kindness in restoring more than one fallen  acquaintance the wives of gentlemen they gentlewomen mothers of large families of young children is well known to many who will read these sheets through curiosity But the case is widely different Mary or Nan if tolerably cunning wenches reason thus  "It is hit or miss If I live with the 'Squire seven yearsif I can draw him in to marry me why I am a  fine Laady  for life and if I can't why I shall do just as well for  Bob the Postillion  "  Agreed but you ought not to be company for ladies of virtue birth and education nor are ye or ever shall be for one insignificant individual who more than once insignificant as she is has mortified titled harlots of this description One indeed sent to know what she had done that Mrs Berkeley would not visit her and Mrs Berkeley bade the lady tell her Whether the lady did tell her or not must be guessed The wife of a gentleman may behave very foolishly very idly and it may it must be very difficult to ascertain whether her conduct is criminal or not and if her husband not a known scoundrel does not give her up her friends and neighbours ought not to do it But with Mary and Nan and the 'Squire there cannot remain a doubt especially when a poor little baseborn brat appears and is owned every year It is the  bounden  duty of  every sincere  servant of GOD to discountenance vice let it be seriously remembered that  himself says  "  Who will rise up with me against the wicked and take my part against the evildoers  "  Every individual however humble  their station in life may enjoy that honour by browbeating vice as the worthy Dr C  b  y of M  did when his neighbour the late Lord C urged him to visit at    In a country where the QUESTION as the torture used to be termed in France  ie  the rack is not allowed Mrs Berkeley did not think  very  highly of  her own mental  powers in resolving not to answer any  homethrust  as she termed it however it might excite the admiration of her clever Son and sensible excellent friend Mrs Duncombe the cultivated the enlightened relict of the late very learned amiable Reverend John Duncombe MA well known in the learned world and of whom the great Mr Burke once said speaking of him to the Editor  "He was a very considerable man indeed"  This lady with whom the Editor esteems it one of her greatest earthly felicities that she has lived in the strictest the most uninterrupted friendship for the last twentyfive years of her life that is ever since the commencement of their acquaintance and to whom she feels herself deeply indebted for a thousand amiable attentions particularly during her last melancholy visit to Canterburyany attempt by so feeble a pen to celebrate the  elêve  of Mr Richardson the friend of Mrs Epictetus Carter the relict of the abovenamed learned wellinformed Mr Duncombe would be a vain effort unless it were to sing  "  a hymn to my own praise and glory  "  for having been honoured  with the friendship of such a woman Mrs Duncombe's own fine pen  has does  celebrate her fame her praise long may she live to use it for the entertainment the improvement of those who read what is worth reading Her letters carefully preserved if printed would give the English a  Madame Sevignée  of their own nation It is to be hoped that some time or other they may be collected and given to the world  It is certain that they would  not  cost the pains that those of the lovely lively and in her latter days excellently pious Madame de Sevignée's did for one has frequently heard that it took many months to a  patient  genius to correct the false orthography of those very entertaining improving letters Madame de Sevignée had never studied "The complete Letter Writer" published some years ago Of the minor visitations there are few things more dreaded by Mrs Duncombe and the Editor than an epistle from any lady who has Last time they met Mrs Duncombe redde such an epistle to the Editor who said  "My dear friend I am grown very stupid I do not understand it"  "  No how should you without the book  "  The Editor's Father always told his girls letters should be conversation upon paper A most charming correspondent of the Editor's long since removed to bliss once shewed her a letter from a lovely young friend of her'safter a page of chitchat she writes thus  "Oh aye but I forgot to tell you that I was married about a fortnight ago that is true"  and then proceeds as before The Editor greatly prefers Miss P  ge's letter as above quoted to the studied epistles of  letterbook  ladies  although in them would be found some very  smart  strictures on the Writer of these pages This lady like Mr Monck Berkeley has often said that the Editor had an art  superior  to  magic  in not being made to speak when she had not a mind to speak Mrs Duncombe  can  and Mr Monck Berkeley  could  alas entertain very highly by speakingthe Editor it should seem by her silence  Mr Berkeley having been out of England for several months on his return as usual immediately paid his duty at home After dinner as he sat chatting with his Mother she said  "Berkeley your old friend  is married since you left us to Lord  's niece a very sweet pleasing young lady But I am sure you won't believe me when I tell you that it is a certain fact no  flam  or  fun  Mr Berkeley had the pleasure of living in great intimacy with the family of the late Lord and the present very worthy throughly amiable Dowager Lady Dacre He had the honour to be a great favourite with that learned accomplished nobleman who used often to say  "Berkeley Berkeley how you do love  fun  as they call it at Eton I wish you did not love  fun  quite so well"  Mrs Berkeley used to say  "It was an hereditary matter quite incurable she believed as derived to him from his Mother"  Mr Berkeley and his Mother often amused themselves with trying to impose on the credulity of each other to the no small diversion of Dr Berkeley and Mrs Frinsham  I assure you that he wept like a child through the whole of the ceremony"  Never whilst the Editor retains her reason can she forget the reception this speech met from Mr Berkeley He lifted up his beautiful eyes and with the solemnity of a pious judge when he pronounces the sentence of death said  "Weep my dear Mother Well might he weep poor fellow I shall wonder if he ever does any thing but weep through life"  Mrs B  "Why so"  Mr B  "Why so Why because three years ago he courted a gentleman's daughter to marry her when the  Devil put it into his head to prevail with her to elope with him and when he had got the poor creature to  House he refused to marry her  The gentleman being asked to subscribe to a book Mr Moore's Treatise on Suicide Gaming and Duelling which Dr Berkeley used to say he esteemed to be the first the most useful work of this century laughingly replied to the solicitor of the guinea  "Oh  I  am in no manner of danger of killing myself"  That did not appear quite so certain to the person who asked the subscription He is a young noble of very large paternal estate Mr Moore's two volumes are more entertaining than most novels and as pious as most sermons On the publication of the first volume the Editor ventured to recommend them in a letter in the St James's Chronicle proposing to have prints engraved for firescreens from some of the most  tremendous tales of woe  related by Mr Moore The Editor supposes it never reached Mr Baldwin as he generally finds a corner to insert any hint that she thinks may benefit her fellowcreatures Dr Berkeley made the Editor write to the very worthy Mr Moore to raise his inestimable volumes to three guineas instead of to  half  that sum Their worth to those that  well weigh  them is beyond all price surely  and the poor unhappy girl cast off by her own family has lived with him ever since behaving in every other instance like an angel Might he not well weep my dear Mother"  Mrs Berkeley assured her Son that she had never heard a tittle of this dreadful business until he told it her  Mr B  "Had I been in England I would certainly have used all my poor rhetoric to have prevailed on him not to load his conscience through life with such a crime but honourably honestly marry her The poor creature is I hear dying of a broken heart for she really loved the  little scoundrel With all your saying that girls must beware of men and take care of  themselves  and never trust them how often have I heard you applaud my grandfather's conduct with regard to his brother who having treated a lady of family in a similar way utterly refused to marry her and  many many  years afterwards when he went to visit him at Cloyne absolutely refused to see him although he was then become what the world calls a worthy man  This unhappy gentleman married a young lady of vast fortune He was killed at Carthagenia in the year  His lady died of grief and left an only daughter who inherits her father's exquisite beauty her mother's worth and vast patrimony She died about five years ago  but during his two or three days visit there dined as you have often and often heard my Father say in the library by himself and no intreaties of my Grandmother or my Father could prevail upon him to see him constantly saying 'He is a genuine scoundrel I trust God will forgive him upon his repentance but  I  will never see him whilst I breathe' And I am sure you used to have as much horror of seduction as my grandfather Where honourable proposals had been made how often have you rung in my ears the worthiness of  your  excellent General H  who having been educated in the most pious way by his mother Lady H  used to return the ridicule of his friends when a young man in the guards for his taking up with any drab with 'Well well you may laugh as you please but  I  would not for  all this  world has to give have the ruin of an innocent woman to answer for"  This excellent gentleman has for near forty years done due honour to his alas for this poor nation  very uncommonly  pious educationfamily prayers every day with the lessons and psalms of the dayand the Editor hears with pleasure that his exemplary care of his family is repaid by that God whose doctrine  "he so beautifully adorns"  by the excellent conduct of his children May  they  be spared to him Long may  he  be spared a blessing to them  Few men perhaps have ever been formed with more qualifications to make a complete orator than Mr Berkeley a very uncommonly harmonious musical voice with from an infant the sweetest tones imaginable which he could at pleasure elevate like his grandfather Bishop Berkeley to  tremendous  thunder taught from four years old to repeat by heart without rant or forced action being told after he properly understood the meaning of what he had learned to repeat it as he felt it on his own mind and being from seven years old accustomed to talk with delight of speaking in Westminster Hall he took every opportunity of improving himself  When a boy at Canterbury School which as has been already observed he quitted at twelve years old during  the sessions for the city at the GuildHall and for the county at the old Castle Mr Berkeley generally went without his dinner flying off the instant the school broke up to the court to hear the pleadings He once prevailed on his Father to permit him to go attended by Mr Wrightson under a strict promise  "  of doing every thing that John bade him  "  to Maidstone to attend at the assizes On his return home he related all the causes and pleadings and a particular in the summing up the evidence by Sir William Blackstone as accurately as if he had taken it all down in shorthand which he could not then do He was if the French expression  fort éveillié  may be permitted to be translated into English the most  awaked  of all creatures  Nothing  escaped him he caught every thing he saw and wished to know in a moment One instance proves it very strongly Soon after he went to Eton he had a  raging  desire to learn to fence which his Father was  resolved  he should  not  do until he attained to a certain age fixed by him All Mr Berkeley's arguments that the Bishop had let his Father learn at fourteen were ineffectual Dr Berkeley saying that many youths of fashion were often killed by its straining their lungs when they were too tender to bear it Mr Berkeley was however resolved to learn what he could as he afterwards told his Father saying  "I had little trouble when  I did  learn for I used instead of going to cricket c to go regularly at the hours of learning and fix myself like a statue at the  window"  Whilst the very worthy respectable universally respected Mr Angelo was instructing his pupils he used to say  "I think I hardly came  honestly  by my skill in fencing But Angelo is as worthy amiable a man as ever lived and I dare say did not grudge me what I so gleaned from his great skill"  When Mr Berkeley spoke his Prize Exercise in the Parliament Hall at St Andrews before the then Chancellor of that University the late Earl of Kinnoul when all the prize exercises had been delivered Lord Kinnoul went to Mr Berkeley and embracing him said  "I rejoice Sir to embrace the grandson of my dear old friend Bishop Berkeley and to be able to say that  I  never heard speech  so  spoken from this pulpit since I have had the honour to be Chancellor here"  Mr Berkeley had redde his prize exercise near fifty times over to his Mother Just before he went out he conjured her to hear him once more that he might lay his emphasis exactly right The request was complied with  Mr Berkeley together with his amiable beloved friend the late learned Sir John Ramsey and his dear friend Mr Lennard frequently spent part of their vacation very pleasantly at Lord Kinnoul's seat A droll anecdote or two might be here related particularly a scene in the Library but this Preface is already too long and the reader has  perhaps frequently exclaimed  "What is all this chitchat to  me  I wish to read the great actions of great men"  If so according to the advice of the  great  Johnson and the  little  Editor read Sir Francis Knollys's History of the Turks Marcus Antoninus c  But to return from this digression It is impossible to omit an amiable attention of a young Scotch gentleman who with his wonderfully sensible younger brother Thomas constantly attended the service of the Church of England at Dr Berkeley's and who were frequently invited to visit there The young Laird of LogieAlmon came running into Mrs Berkeley's dressingroom quite breathless he threw himself into a chair and on Mrs Berkeley's enquiring if he was ill and asking whether he would have any thing he replied  "No my dear Madam no But I flew hither to tell you how delightfully Mr Berkeley has spoken and in what  extacies  Lord Kinnoul one of the many guardians of this very pleasing amiable young gentleman said to me I thought it  must  delight you so I ran every step of the way that I might be the  first  to tell you of it I was sadly frightened at first poor Mr Berkeley  The Editor has heard from others never from her Son although from him by letter she heard much of his  expected  tremors that the first night of his speaking at Blenheim even whilst his obliging neighbours the Mayor Corporation and their families were clapping him which the dear amiable Bishop of Norwich wrote Dr Berkeley word the next post they did for some minutes before they suffered him to speak Mr Berkeley dropt his hat and was unable to take it up so exceedingly did his hand tremble and on the stage it must have remained but that the very accomplished amiable Lord Mount Edgecombe happening to see Mr Berkeley's distress stepped on the stage picked up the hat and gave it to him  trembled violently and was so long before  he  began  to speak that I expected every moment the Chancellor would say  Pray Sir begin  and that would have made him ten times worse But when he had once begun he got courage and went on nobly and every body is astonished"  This young gentleman was at that time barely fifteen years old May he as a man through life be what he was in youth  A very extraordinary circumstance happened at the birth of this young gentleman A very aged domestic of the Drummond family many years more than an hundred who lived in a little cot by the bounty of the excellent Laird on LogieAlmon estate as soon as he heard that his dear Laird had a son walked down about a mile to get a sight of him He was told the infant was asleep He returned the next day The Laird walked out Lady Catharine feared letting the child be carried out of the room He returned the day but one following the Laird  at home  ordered the infant down to be viewed by worthy old Steel who taking him into his arms said  "  Lord now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace  I thank thee for having permitted me to see the Editor thinks the  seventh  generation of my dear old first master  A somewhat similar circumstance occurred between two relations of the Editor  "Old Tom Leigh of Iver the  honestest old Tory in England  "  aged about ninetyon the birth of the late Colonel Powney member for Windsorordered his coach and went over to Iver Place to congratulate his friend Powney He rejected caudle cake c and to the no small amazement of Mr Powney said  "Tell your butler to bring us a bottle of wine"  The infant was desired to be brought down when Mr Leigh filling out a glass of wine took the infant's hand saying  "Little man I have come hither on purpose to have the pleasure of drinking a  bottle  of wine with  you  the fifth of your family with whom I have enjoyed that pleasure"  The Powneys are a shortlived family the Leighs in general very longlived The Editor's ancestor of that name lived to a great age  "  The excellent Laird equally delighted ordered him refreshment He walked gently home sat down in his chair saying  "  Now I am happy  "  and his faithful affectionate spirit took its flight without even a sigh  Those medical gentlemen of skill who heard the above fact much spoken of at the time agreed that had he seen the young Laird on the first day when he went for that purpose the spirit of the good old man had been freed three days sooner that his ardent desire had detained it One has frequently heard of similar instances of the detention of the spirit in its earthly prison for hours even days What a wonder is the spirit of man How passing wonder HE who implants it in the curiously wrought prison The late very sensible unfortunate Honourable Colonel Nairne a great collector who had a fine print of old Steel  which Mr Monck Berkeley purchased with many other curiosities after his death has frequently told the Editor that the engraver mistook in setting down his age one hundred and nine that it ought to have been one hundred and thirtynine One cannot help dropping a tear on the lamentable fate of this very accomplished wellinformed man His father Lord Nairne unfortunately engaged in the Rebellion the son fighting for the Hanover family The first duty to which he was appointed was to go and batter down his own noble magnificent castle His late Majesty who knew him personally was very desirous to have given him a regiment and other bounties but the Duke of Cumberland prevented it by telling his Majesty it was  impossible  a man who had suffered so much could ever forget or forgive it Thus the desperate despairing poor sinner thinks of an allmerciful Saviour although he has repeatedly declared  "Him that cometh to me  ie  during the state of trial on earth I will no wise cast out"  There is no SAVING repentance  after  deathwhilst we are on earth he is a Sovereign  "  mighty to us  The Lamb of God that taketh away the sins of the world"  The instant we quit the body he becomes our Judgethe Lion of the tribe of Judah The Editor is not a disciple of the acute  she has redde Horbury and thinks with Dr Young  "Not so our Infidels"  "A GOD ALL Mercyis a GOD unjust"  Indeed so anxious was Mr Berkeley to improve himself in public speaking that with the permission of Principal M'Cormick of whose polite attentions to himself and the other English  gentlemen  students he always spoke in high terms  The Editor seldom recollects to have seen Mr Berkeley more angry than once in a large circle when a gentleman said  "Mr Berkeley Dr Gilbert Stuart has wonderfully attacked your Scotch Principal of St Andrews"  and proceeded to repeat what Stuart had published Mr Berkeley reddened with indignation and said  "He is a rascaland let him say what he  will I  say who lived near four years under his discipline that his conduct towards us was remarkably gentlemanlike and liberal and I am persuaded there is not one Englishman that would not join me in declaring it and Stuart is a rascal I repeat it"  he instituted a  Literarii Viginti  who were to meet and speak for two or three hours in the evening either once a week or once a fortnight The Principals Professors gentlemen of the city and neighbourhood frequently honoured this little seminary of  juvenile  orators with their presence Two on each side were generally chosen to speak and oppose and every one as in the House of Commons was permitted to rise and speak on either side Those appointed to speak on the subject always carried a speech prepared on paper Mr Berkeley used always to say  "Hang that paper I am so glad when I have done with it When I throw my notes aside I can speak with  spirit  I hate to be hampered I love to be as the French say  coudes franches  I believe I shall  do  at the bar for I feel twice the strength after all my arguments are opposed  and pulled to pieces that I do at going on without opposition it  animates  it  inspires  me"  One morning after a Viginti evening Mrs Berkeley walking out was met by Professors Hill Hunter Baron and many others who all congratulated her on the figure Mr Berkeley had made the preceding evening amongst the young orators It would be wasting ink to say how much the heart of the Mother of an only child must have felt this commendation  A rather laughable circumstance occurred two or three days afterwards Mrs Berkeley taking her usual walk by the sea was met by a lady who after  complimenting  her on Mr Berkeley's fine speaking added  "and my son spoke too and did pretty well I hear"  Mrs Berkeley who as her Son always said of her  "would not flatter Royalty"  no not her favourite  "Queen of Sheba were she now on earth"  said  "she was glad to hear that sweet  had done so well"  A most lovely excellent young man he was and Mrs Berkeley used frequently to say to him as she used to say to the angelic Mr Montgomerie a dozen years before  "  if I had a daughter with an  hundred thousand pounds  in her pocket and you had  only  the coat on your back  such as you are  I would beg the  favour  of you to marry her"  Should any one read thus  far perhaps long ago they have done it they will probably again exclaim  "The creature is a FOOL quite an IDIOT"  But the Editor never conceived any happiness could arise from setting two sacks of gold together any more than that bread will be produced by setting two sacks of wheat side by side But to return This wise lady proceeded  "Well Mrs Berkeley as both our sons have spoken and gained credit let  you  and  I  make an agreement that  they  shall not speak any more  for fear  they should lose the credit they have gained"  To which Mrs Berkeley observing the  extreme  cleverness of the speaker replied  "Oh dear Madam you know you are  sole  directress of  but thank God my Son has a  much wiser  director than his Mother Dr Berkeley is a most excellent judge and judicious director of young men's education and I have no more idea of interfering in parts of my Son's education as a scholar than I have of sitting down to write a Visitation or Assize Sermon for his Father BUT I will  certainly  tell him what YOU Madam say"  Mrs Berkeley  failed not  to do it BUT Mr Berkeley went on speaking without losing  any  of his credit as an orator Two of the Scotch speakers are now in England the learned entertaining Reverend Mr James Bruce Mr Berkeley's tutor and the gentle pleasing Mr William Kemp tutor to Mr Lennard who was many years ago recommended through Dr Berkeley's recommendation by his amiable friend the late Lord Dacre into the family of  the Earl of Beverley where his uncommon merits as a tutor are felt and most generously most nobly rewarded by the noble descendant of the great hero of ChevyChace  Soon after Mr Berkeley's return to England he began to feel an ardent desire to obtain a seat in Parliament How was that wish to be gratified Bishop Berkeley was too generous to amass a fortune He constantly gave away with both hands After thirty thousand pounds debt paid by Mr Berkeley's grandmother Mrs Frinsham and her single sister Mrs Cherry of their grandfather William Cherry Esquire and  establishing  instead of taking as ordered by him if wanted to pay his debts a very good estate left by him to found a charity school in the parish of Bray in Berkshire where lay a large part of his vast estate  It would be a pleasantry to say that the burning of Cliefden's "  Proud Alcove  " finished it but on that conflagration the other day went ten thousand pounds more of old Mr Cherry's fortune he having lent the Duke of Buckingham commonly justly called the wicked Duke of Buckingham that sum to build that delightful mansion Mr Berkeley's Mother and Aunt have a note of hand of the Duke for seven thousand pounds The Editor did not produce it as any part of her fortune when she married The wonder was that  so very acute  a man as old Mr Cherry certainly was  should lend to such  a man as the Duke of Buckingham so large a sum on only a common note of handbut Mr Cherry was immensely rich and lent to every one of his friends that asked himaccordingly his greatgranddaughter finds  some  of her kind friends much more ready to  lend  than  she is to borrow  for which may GOD reward them here and hereafter  The SouthSea bubble had although not beggared  yet wonderfully reduced the large remainder of Mr Cherry's fortune so that during the life of Mr Berkeley's Mother he could not get a qualification that would sit easy on  his  conscience His Mother on learning this offered to give up  entirely  into his hands her whole settlement adding  "I have from your infancy ever said 'If  I must be  absolutely dependant on any fallen child of Adam may it be on Berkeley not on dear sweet Robert for Berkeley has a generosity of soul that  I  have never seen in any human being through my whole life but in himself alone"  On saying this he exclaimed  "Jesus avert that I should be SUCH a villian No I would were it necessary sooner carry a brown musket than ever touch a sixpence of your settlement It is too small we all know No never whilst my name is Berkeley will I ever diminish it It may I hope please God that I may live to  add  to it"  On his coming home at vacationtime he often mentioned curious causes at Westminster Hall and the Old Bailey His Father one day said  "Berkeley it does not seem to me that you go often to the House of Commons I should think that you would be there perpetually"  Mr Berkeley  "My dear Sir I never go at all"  Dr B  "Never go How is that I am sure you know at least  half  an hundred members that would take you in"  Mr B  "Yes my dear Sir I know men enough that would take me in  every  day if I would go but I will  not go  I dare not trust myself"  Mrs B  "Not trust yourself what do you think you should spring up and speak"  Mr B  "No my dear Madam no but I am afraid the Devil should tempt me to long  so much  to get into Parliament that I should deceive myself and reason myself into a belief that a  sham  qualification had no harm in it and therefore the Lord being my helper I never will set foot in St Stephen's Chapel unless I can go thither properly authorized to speak So you will never hear any account from  me  of the orators there"  Mr Berkeley went perpetually to hear Hastings's Trial He told his Father that  "after listening with all the attention he was possessed of to the harangues of a certain great Orator he conceived that his grand argument was a strong arm which enabled him to  thump  the table violently  The Orator here described has  certainly  many other arguments than  "  thumping the table  "  But Mr Berkeley was so convinced of Mr Hastings's innocence with regard to  money  matters that he felt indignation at his nearest friends for not seeing it The Editor at one time suffered a sort of persecution from her  two  sons the excellent Mr Grimston she always styled her  second  son so as to occasion her threatening to bolt her dressingroom doorenter Mr Berkeley with a thick pamphlet  "My dear Mother I conjure you to read  this  and you will be  convinced  that Hastings is an injured man"  "My dear Son I have redde Mr Hastings's  own  letter where he says 'Nothing can be done in this business until Mr Fowke is removed' Now  you know  I have told you a score times that 'if there is  but one  honest man upon earth  that man  is my old friend Mr Fowke whom I have not seen these last thirty years but men seldom turn rogues at  fifty  You know the  two  instances of his  stern  integrity that I have held up to your imitation since you were ten years old"  Then enter Mr Grimston with two or three  thick  treatises on the INIQUITY of the Slavetrade  "Come now my dear Madam I am sure you  can  you  will  find time to read  these  and you will see  "    "See what my dear Grimston you know that I am a great reader of a  very old fashioned book  and I read  there  in Leviticus 'WHOSOEVER is found stealing a MAN shall SURELY be put to death' now I believing with  all  my soul  that argument  against the Slavetrade what would you have more of me"  When they are stolen would to God all would treat them as does my kindly respected friend John Ashley Esquire of Jamaica none of whose slaves  will accept  their freedom when asked  "  It must here be said that Mr Berkeley was a  strenuous assertor of Mr Hastings's innocence He had put himself to considerable expence to procure documents from India and had prepared for the press perhaps as elaborate an investigation of Mr Hastings's conduct and character as beautiful a defence as was ever penned which he however the day before it was to be sent to the press sacrificed to paternal authority He brought it to the Editor and with tears in his eyes threw it on her table saying  "There is a  sacrifice to duty  I beseech you to take care of it It cost me many pounds and much time and might have benefited  I think  an injured man Do not let it be lost perhaps it may some time or other see the light"  It is as requested still carefully preserved  with many other things of Mr Berkeley's writing for he was never idle but whilst in company When at his Father's he retired soon after dinner and immediately after tea As he very seldom ate any supper as soon as the cloth was removed his servant notified it to him and he came down and entertained his friends with his enlivening conversation and sometimes delighted the soul of his Mother by complying with her request to sing to her the hymn sung by the Eton College gentlemen It begins  "  Salvator Mundi  "  c  It may be asked why the Editor who as an old servant of her mother's once said  "  I don't know Latin from English  "  knows not Latin but had two kind translators of it and Mr Berkeley's voice when he sang any thing sacred was quite divine very like Mr Airson's His father early in life  charged  him never to sing in company  until the servants came in to family prayers after which he more frequently retired to study than to rest  Few persons were ever more strongly impressed with the terror of being called into judgement for idleness than Mr Berkeley During the latter part of his illness he would frequently exclaim  "Lord forgive me what an idle life I do lead Surely God will call me to account for it"  His Mother assured him that  did not resemble Pharaoh's taskmasters that the work God had then appointed him to was what he daily performed bearing with the most perfect resignation and the sweetest cheerful submission  his heavenly Father's gracious chastisements for which when not in actual agony he humbly heartily thanked God for sending him  Mr Berkeley's delicate attentions to his Mother's feelings were throughly amiable When he was about three and twenty in the summer vacation he went down to his Father's and one day said to his Mother  "I might have had a fine summer of it if I had pleased for my friend  pressed me exceedingly to spend it with him A  Charming high  were spoken by Mr Berkeley for the Editor who always laughed at the young men of her acquaintance for any thing  outré  wishing to  brush  the moon or break their necks from an elevated phaëton or odious high gig  charming high  phaëton and  four  in hand a delightful neighbourhood and near  "  Mrs B  "Well my dear child and why were you such a simpleton as not to go"  Mr B  "No I chose rather to come and spend some part of it with you"  Mrs B  "With me how could you be such a fool Have not I always told you as I used to tell your dear Father when he was young if any pleasant scheme presents itself never to think you have a wife but enjoy it I will never expect you at home till I see you only write  to me that  I  may enjoy  your  happiness by rebound So  I  have always said to you since you grew up Do not think of your Mother If  you  are happy  she  is so"  Mr B  "Well but my dear Madam the case is this Some fellow or other would have told you that  is a Deist and they would have told you truth and then you would have been wild for fear of your poor Bairne  Mrs B  "My dear I honour as I ever must the extreme delicacy of your conduct towards your Mother from your childhood But I should not have been uneasy for I humbly thank God I am persuaded my Bairne is too well grounded to let even the arguments of so learned so acute a man as  have any influence on  your  faith founded on the Rock of Ages"  About two years before Mr Berkeley's death his Mother said  "What is become of  I think I never hear you speak of him now"  Mr B  "Why no my dear Mother I very seldom see him I found it  quite  impossible for  me  to do him  any  good and I was  resolved  that  he  should not do  me  any harm so by degrees I gently dropped him intimate as we formerly were"  The blessings of being throughly instructed wellgrounded in the true faith in early youth is most beautifully described in a letter of the late Dr Kenrick Prebendary of Westminster minister of Hambledown father of the worthy Lady Gibbon During Dr Berkeley's residence in Scotland Mr Berkeley brought his Mother a very dirty old Edinburgh magazine with a leaf folded saying  "My dear Madam there is a letter that will delight you"  It was from Dr Kenrick the year forgot it deserves to be printed in letters of GOLD  Mr Berkeley when staying at his Father's house in Berkshire had books constantly from Bull's circulating library at Bath or from Hookham's His amiable spirit led him always to order that  some  of the allowed number should be such as would be pleasant to his Mother He one day coming down into the drawingroom to tea with a book in his hand said  "Observe now how persons are rewarded for serving their  friends  I sent for this book  solely  on my  Mother's  account not meaning to read three pages of it myself for I am at present very busy and when I opened it to twirl over the leaves I have been so charmed by it that I have redde every line attentively and when my Mother has finished it I shall read it over again"  This book was The CALVARY of the excellent Mr Cumberland just then published Mr Berkeley spoke of it  as it merits to be spoken of  in all  companies A  learned critic  once said  "Sir I am surprized to hear  you  speak so very highly of it who are certainly a very excellent judge of poetry"  and began objecting to some lines which he termed prosaic At length Mr Berkeley replied  "Well Sir it is possible there may be more piety than poetry in some of the lines but I think it was worth being born if it were only to have written that  excellent  work"  A gentleman once said to Dr Berkeley  "I wonder Mr Berkeley is not as vain and conceited as he is high so admired so caressed and courted as he is in town"  Mr Berkeley in conversation at the other end of the room overhearing it broke off and said  "Alas Sir no Mr Berkeley  knows himself  too  well  to be made vain He knows what he is equal to and can never be  fool  enough to be vain"  His humility was great When abroad every marked attention that was shown to him by eminent men of great learning or high rank he constantly humbly attributed to his being the grandson of so great a man as Bishop Berkeley who was extremely well known and highly respected as a wonderful genius in France Italy and Germany Before what a late  blackguard  publication has called  "  a few lucky words of Mr Pope's  "  that great man according to the account of his very old intimate friend the late learned Richard Dalton Esquire of Lincolnshire who with Sir John James accompanied Bishop Berkeley to  America was at least  sixtysix  years old when the said  "  lucky words  "  were written Bishop Berkeley was idolized in Englandbefore he set off for America was offered a bishopricused to go to St James's two evenings in a week to dispute with Dr Samuel Clarke before Queen Caroline then Princess of Waleshad a magnificent gold medal presented to him by his late Majesty when Prince of Wales as a keepsake at the time that the Father of the said PUBLICATOR  Dr Berkeley used frequently to say to his Son  "I do admire the words of your Mother's coining They are wonderfully  expressive  energetic"  The Editor when unexpectedly hearing of any base or worthless person or action has ever been addicted to utter her indignation in a word of her own composing if she thought no Dictionary afforded one sufficiently strong  was employed it is to be hoped not in cheating as bailiff by a noble relation of the Bishop's That noble Goliath in punishing ingratitude and sauciness Mr Burke has most happily introduced holy Job he has not quoted one verse quoted below for which as he Mr Burke says  "we do not find Job reprehended"  "Whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the  dogs  of the flock"    Job  chap xxx verse  It is certain that when Bp Berkeley dined at his noble relation's Lady  the father of this acute UNGRATEFUL Publicator did  not  dine at the same table with her Ladyship and the Bishop By the generosity of  Mr Berkeley  The account in Dr Berkeley's own hand was lately shewn by the Editor to an acquaintance of the Publicator'son the  universal ourcry  on the  manner  in which Dr Berkeley and his Father are mentioned in that  inimitable  work "The Life of the excellent Bishop Horne"  one hundred and eightynine pounds at different times were presented to this Publicator which must have been a pleasant addition to a poor curacy  Poor  Dr Berkeley seems tacitly censured in the  said  publication for giving his honoured Patron  "  no rest until he preferred a particular friend  "  The Editor has been repeatedly asked who that was and  violent  exclamation has constantly followed the answer A gentleman within this week told the Editor that Dr Berkeley said to him eighteen years ago  "Until I had gotten preferment for  I used to receive all his publications bound in blue or green Morocco magnificently gilt and lettered but since I have never received any  even in boards  "  Dr Berkeley in procuring from Archbishop Secker preferment for the Reverend Mr Andrews the incomparable answerer of Bishop Warburton served the most grateful of menfarther this deponent saith not at present  All the PUBLICATOR's letters some very curious were preserved by Dr Berkeley some  few  were deposited in the hands of the Editor and are models of  In one the PUBLICATOR tells Dr Berkeley  "I begin to think it time I got some  Dignity  in the Church as I wish to keep a  Carriage  I think I should like a stall at Canterbury"  It may perhaps not be impertinent to remark that the  Archbishop of Canterbury has only  three  stalls to dispose of and that at this time his Lady's nephew the polite elegant Dr Benson and the son of his friend Bishop Berkeley were only  poor Vicars  the one of Bray in Berks the other of ShepherdWell in Kent The PUBLICATOR seems to have  laboured  to pour contempt on the name of BERKELEY but it was renowned in history before he was born Every one remembers the answer that poor Sir Roger de Coverley received from the  Royalist  when he enquired the way to  Anne's  Church Soho  "that she was a Saint before he was born and would be after he was hanged  See the Spectator  "  The Editor hopes that  she  may not be doing what her honoured Fatherinlaw never would do when he refused to make the least answer to any of the scurrilous things written against him by that worse than savage monster Archbishop King of Dublin Bishop Berkeley saying  "The noticing them would be like preserving a  dirty  fly in AMBER"  The Editor has frequently heard Dr Berkeley relate the following story from his father This old monster and Bishop Berkeley then Fellow of Dublin College a  little  known in the learned world were both at dinner in Dublin at the house of an Earl whose title the Editor does not at present recollect but who had a beautiful Lady and an house full of remarkably fine children During the time of dinner half a score of servants in waiting this  purpled  brute said  "Whenever I see a parcel of fine children I  always  look round the table to see which of the footmen is the father of them"  With these words he threw his  devilish  eyes around the room The Lay Peer must have been a saint not to have ordered his domestics to drag the spiritual one nine times through the kennel and the Lady must have been either an  angel  or a  fool  not instantly to have risen from table They however contented themselves with never admitting his GRACE within their doors any more The late Dr Berkeley used frequently to relate this and two or three other stories in order as he used to say to Mr Berkeley  "to call your Mother out"  To be sure Mrs Berkeley used to  storm nobly  on these occasions to the great diversion of her amiable husband who used to ask  "What would SHE have done had she been Lady  "  To which she used to reply  "Why never have visited any woman who admitted that BRUTE into her drawingroom"  An  heavy  punishment to be sure but the Editor insignificant as she is has often mortified  fine  ladies even of rank in that way She began early About the age of twenty soon after the death of her excellent Mother being with her younger sister at a waterdrinking place Lady  who had done  the favour to live with him five years previous to her being married to him came thither was visited by every mortal Lady  Lady  c c yet all this availed her  poor  Ladyship with a set of horses  two men cooks of whom she made  frequent  mention and about twenty thousand pounds  per annum  like Haman with Mordecai These two little insignificant country gentleman's daughters  would not  visit her Ladyship They were told that it was  ridiculous not  to do it Some of their relations their superiors told them that they  ought  to do it It availed not they were as stubborn as two little mules Well but her Ladyship would  willi nilhi  constantly join the one who drank the waters every morning and converse with her She one morning said  "She computed all her ill health to a bad lyingin"  FAME said that her Ladyship never had lainin at all  The Editor and her sister always went to town every spring from Windsor where they resided before Mrs Berkeley married for about two months or ten weeks to look about them and prevent their being rusticated At Ranelagh the Ridotto c her Ladyship never failed to find them out come to them and make the kindest enquiries A woman of quality once at an installation at Windsor said to Mrs Berkeley then Miss Frinsham  "How comes it that  you  visit Lady  "  Miss Frinsham  "I visit her who told you that I visited her"  Lady  "Nobody but just now she happened to see you and said 'Oh there is Miss Frinsham  I must go  and speak to her directly' and away she  bustled  Her Ladyship's gait was of that description I thought by her manner that you were very intimate"  Miss Frinsham replied  "It was her own fault that she did not enjoy that  honour  "  The poor Lady is now no longer an inhabitant of this world  Such contempt may the most insignificant pour on VICE It is not saying  "  Stand by thyself I am holier than thou  "  God avert such pride from every  real  child of God The Editor who during a course of forty years has been frequently in such skirmishes has been often asked  "If they may not be  very  penitent"  to which her constant reply is the poet tells us that  " 'Tis best repenting in a coach and six"  But the Editor has no  great  idea of the housemaid or the kitchenmaid's repentance  in  the  coach and six  Her penitents are such as the late lovely Lady of  who having trusted that most agreeable of wretches  too far  was ruined and he compelled by Authority to marry her She was as countryfolks in Berkshire phrase it made an  honest woman  But the Editor has been repeatedly told by an intimate excellent friend of hers who constantly added  "I had probably shared the same fate as Miss  if my excellent Motherinlaw had not watched over me at eighteen and  never left me one minute alone with  "  adding  "I am sure had my Mother been asked whether she would choose to leave me alone with  or with a tiger she would not have hesitated to prefer the tiger"  How different are mothers  now  in these enlightened days to what they were fifty years ago  was of the sly tiger kind and seldom laid wait for his prey in vain This excellent lady has often told the Editor that after Miss  was married no one ever saw that she had an eye for she never lifted those beauteous causes of her sad fall from the earth scarce ever spoke in company but little to her most intimate friends and died of grief at the end of two years Happily her worthy Son resembles his Mother more than his Father This was repentance although in a coach and six which Miss  's situation in life might entitle her to for she was the daughter of a gentleman and had a very good fortune  Some few years ago Dr Berkeley going to spend some months at  Mr Monck Berkeley said to his Mother  "Now my dear Mother as soon as you get to  such a lady naming the name will visit you and you  must  return her visit You must  not  know that she broke her first husband's heart by her  flirtations  with her present husband whom she  "  "But all that is nothing you know to  you  "    "No my dear but I  am afraid it will be somewhat to  her  one day or other and  must  is a bold word for any body to use to your Mother excepting it is your Father"  He turned to his Father and said  "I wished to hear my Mother's sentiments of  that  Lady"  It has been said before that Mr Berkeley could not rest if he saw any creature in distress from which it was possible for him to relieve him In the year during the long vacation Mr Berkeley with two of his Temple friends J R Baker Esquire of Lincoln's Inn Fields and another very sensible amiable young gentleman now no more took a trip to the continent During their residence there Mr Berkeley had it in his power to assist in a very awkward and unpleasant situation a very worthy amiable personage of very high rank his Serene Highness the then reigning Prince of Saxe Gotha uncle to the King of England The circumstances attending this transaction are too long to be related here In the vessel the Prince saw and admired Mr Berkeley's wonderfully curious Highland dog of a very scarce breed so much as to make Mr Berkeley often regret that he could not prevail upon himself to present him to his Serene Highness but adding  "My faithful companion so many hundred miles in so many different countries I found I could not part with OSCAR"  Mr Berkeley's honest Scot Richie did the honours of Oscar told his serene Highness many wonderful yet actually true stories of the  sagacity fidelity  prudence  of that lovely beast On the discovery of the Duke's rank poor Ritchie said to his master  "Laird Sir what an a sad thing it is that I must lave ye"  Mr Berkeley  "Leave me Ritchie Why must you leave me Have you got a better place laddy"  Ritchie  "No Sir no but I can never go back to England"  Mr B  "Why not Ritchie"  Ritchie  "Why Sir that elderly gentleman that talked so much to you is the King's uncle Laird have mercy upon me and that ever  I  should not know it and should dare to talk to him so about the dogto be sure the King will have me hanged if I go back to England I will stay till you go and then contrive if I can to slip into Scotland"  Mr Berkeley answered for his Majesty but some of Mr Berkeley's English friends to divert themselves encouraged poor Ritchie's fears His Serene Highness at parting expressed his gratitude for Mr Berkeley's services and most condescendingly said  "I find Sir that you are a great traveller I hope sometime or other that curiosity although we have not much of curious may lead you to my Court where I shall be most happy to return your  wonderfully kind attentions to me by every respect in my power"  Mr Berkeley used often to say  "Ritchie is a true Scot he will not own that he sees like the pumkins in the  The wellknown story of the English gentleman's ordering his gardener to tie pumkins on a pear treeand the foolish vain Scot saying he had seen the like  "in the Duke of Argyle's garden in Scotland"  No person is ridiculous for  unavoidable  ignoranceevery person of every nation for pretending to knowledge they do not possess  Duke of Argyle's garden any thing of any kind better in England than in Scotland"  One day when Mr Berkeley came down to dinner he said  "Well I must confess Ritchie has at length vanquished me just when I plumed myself on victory As he was dressing my hair just now it occurred to me I will ask Richie if ever he saw a crusade in Scotland and see if he will answer O yes Sir in the  Loodons  i e the Lothians I put the question Ritchie did you ever see a crusade"  Ritchie  "Crusade Sir what an a thing is it is it any beasty"  i e  a beast  Mr B  "No it is a great number of people collected together to go to Jerusalem to recover it out of the hands of the Infidels"  Ritchie  "O yes Sir I have seen that in the Loodons his native county When you were in Edinburgh last you gave me leave to visit my friends and I heard  of them and went to the wood where they were all waiting to go to Jerusalem"  Mr Berkeley then recollected to have heard in Edinburgh that there were a few deluded poor creatures who had assembled themselves in a wood expecting to be conveyed through the air to the Holy Land Their numbers increased prodigiously afterwards as was related and a long account was given of them in some Magazine the Editor thinks the Gentleman's What became of these poor deluded souls she does not recollect to have heard but Mr Berkeley laughing said  "I must now give it up as a gone cause the hope of finding out any thing Ritchie has not seen in the Loodons"  The PUBLICATOR as mentioned before very soon found out that he did not like the situation of his living Poor Dr Berkeley was  worried  to besiege good Archbishop Secker to exchange it for another one with a better house and  much  better income was soon given to this  "  particular  "  this GRATEFUL friend where he commenced his acquaintance and by the  elegance  of his manners soon formed that  intimacy  with the present Sir Edward Dering Baronet of Surrenden which for many months afforded so much amusement in West Kent and even in East Kent His contentions with that gentleman concerning game could not be that he might send some to his friend Dr  Berkeley for he never in his whole life sent him even a lark  Some time after the PUBLICATOR had been gratified by the exchange of his living Dr Berkeley went as he frequently did to make a visit of some weeks at Lambeth The first day at dinner his Grace accosted him thus  "Dr Berkeley I HEAR that your friend Mr  has been in town for about a fortnight  I hear  it for I cannot say  I saw  him He did not find his way to Lambeth"  Poor Dr Berkeley sat abashed at as he termed it the brutal folly to say nothing of the  ingratitude  of this  particular  friend and replied  "I hope that your Grace must have been misinformed"    "No my good young gentleman I have not been misinformed" then quickening his voice as he frequently did "for he was seen driving over Westminsterbridge in a hackneycoach" the  Publicator  had not  then  a carriage of his own "and" quickening his voice still more "in  many  other parts of the town"  To this no answer could  possibly  be made A  mourne silence  followed until broken by that loveliest of women the angelic the incomparable Miss Talbot who to relieve her distressed friend introduced some  pleasanter  subject than the marvellous as Dr Berkeley termed it conduct of the  particular  friend Dr Berkeley at his return home appeared extemely chagrined on relating it  Some time after on taxing the  Publicator  with his unaccountably strange conduct he excused himself very  cleverly  by saying  "Aye I believe I should have gone but I had not time for to tell you the truth  I  went to London always to a friend's house to shew  Beely  and  Peggy  the waxwork and the monuments and the lions and every thing"  It was very lucky that it did not occur to him to carry  Beely  and  Peggy  to  dinner  with his Grace on a  public  day and shew them the Lollards Tower there  The  Publicator  seems to have taken pains to tack at the very end of the list of Bishop Horne's friend's Dr then George Berkeley Esquirea  real  Esquire from his poor  unknown  Father's rank in life and expending every year at Oxford as he has repeatedly told the Editornot in vice She is sure as his excellent Father said when on his arrival in Oxford Dr Berkeley said  "I am ashamed my Lord to say that I have spent six hundred pounds in four monthshere is the account"  The Bishop made the above generous reply  "Not in vice I am sure child"  and threw the account into the fire It was great part in virtue A servant to wait on himself and a groom for his horses could not be reckoned extravagant A young man who never tasted wine could not spend more than a thousand pounds  per annum  but having never been according to his Son  buffeted  through a public school and being quite unacquainted with characters he was perpetually imposed on by designing ungrateful  young men to whom he was  too  bountiful as appears by his accounts now in the Editor's possession from the day he arrived at Christ Church He is receiving his reward  they  no doubt  will  receive theirs Much went in charity to real frequently unknown objects  The Editor has frequently heard Dr Berkeley say that one morning at Christ Church his servant shaving him he redde a sermon preached on charity for lyingin women in AldersgateStreet The preacher the Editor thinks a Prelate described the miseries of  poor  women in those circumstances so pathetically that Dr Berkeley said  "I a young man had never thought on I felt it so strongly that with one half of my chin unshaved I made my servant lay down the razor catched up a sheet of paper wrote to my banker an order to pay to the treasure of the hospital fifty pounds to make me a governor for life for fear I should be at any time unwilling to pay the annual subscription"  Some Scotch friend the Editor has not been able to disdiscover who has celebrated Dr Berkeley's charities to the poor during his  séjour  with his Son at the University of St Andrew's saying  "that he every year gave away above two hundred pounds with his own hands"  This is a mistake He very seldom did give with his own elegant hands unless his wife's may be called his own for unless  which was frequently the case he inclosed in a blank cover a ten often a twenty pound bank note to any person unable to  ask  though not to  receive  charity whose face he had never seen only heard from good authority of their distress How often has he thus  "  made the widow's heart to sing for joy  "  and with holy Job  "the blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon him"  In other instances with regard to the surrounding poor he always left the pleasing task on Mrs Berkeley constantly saying  "I never trouble myself my wife is my almoner"  adding as Mrs Berkeley once said to her excellent kind friend Dr Lynch Prebendary of Canterbury on his asking her concerning a poor old man  "  I  know nothing of him when  once  I have introduced an object of charity to you or Mrs Tatton one of the charitable daughters of the  nobly  charitable Dean and Mrs Lynch  I  never trouble myself  any more  about them but search out some new objects well knowing that  they  will have ample abundant care taken of  them  "  A Scotch minister was once celebrating to Mrs Berkeley the  vast  charities of the LATE Earl of Lauderdalea very worthy Nobleman HE was He began by saying  "His charities are  amazingly great  indeed As surely as you sit there Madam that man puts a  guinea  into the plate a plate at every kirk door guarded by two ruling elders  every Sabbath day and every year three guineas at the  Occasion  The annual kirk sacrament to which a cook of the Editor's lamentable to tell returned so often to the kirk that she was shamefully intoxicated The expence of wine on these  Occasions  is said to be very great indeed that of bread very small  "  Mrs Berkeley replied  "Lord Lauderdale has I know not a large  paternal  estate but he married a very worthy friend of mine the daughter of Sir Thomas Loombe with an English fortune of four thousand pounds  per annum  so that lending fiftythree guineas annually to the Lord  I  do not consider as being so very bountiful as you Sir do I will now tell you of a bountiful donor to the poor the late Dean of Canterbury father to our equally charitable amiable ambassador at Turin Sir William Lynch The Dean had a large paternal estate married one of the daughters of Archbishop Wake with a large fortune and had considerable church preferment now guess what he gave annually to the poor"  Scotch Minister  "I cannot tell"  Mrs B  "Guess"  Scotch Min  "Why perhaps he might give them a hundred pounds a year"  Mr B  "No but he gave them nearer to a thousand for of all his vast income it is universally known at Canterbury and forty miles round that he constantly gave to the poor ten pounds out of every hundred he received from whatever quarter it came beside all sort of good things made for the sick poor in his kitchen and storeroom And to this that he kept open house for rich and poor and when the silk manufactory now alas no more was at a low ebb he nobly asked 'Will my new furnishing the deanery with silk damask help to raise it' and being answered in the affirmative he instantly ordered five hundred pounds worth of furniture damask to be wove which saved it at that time"  It is to be hoped when a score or two more of ladies have been burnt to death by wearing muslin gowns in winter  absurd ridiculous foolish  fashions that the Editor's poor honest  quondam  neighbours may again use their looms If the Editor's leisure had permitted she would have advised them in the Canterbury newspapers not to elect any member to represent their antient city in the new Parliament who would not promise to  make  his wife and daughters wear silk gowns at least during the winter season The Inhabitants of Canterbury are surely as respectable as those of Manchester who will not admit of their printedlinens being  slightly  taxed  The Editor has had occasion to remark that the PUBLICATOR was not very forward to make any grateful return for any favour bestowed on him for he never presented his friend Dr Berkeley even with a lark  See above p ccxxxvi  It is commonly said that in the county of Berks during the partridge season there are as many guns as birds therefore game is always a most agreeable present especially to those who keep much company and frequently in their several seasons would arrive hares partridges pheasants c from the very grateful Mr Andrews of Marden in Kent He never suffered any neighbour to go to London without requesting him to take some game and send it down by the Maidenhead coach The year that Archbishop Secker presented Mr Andrews to this living apples sailed in every county of England except Kent which is no great wonder since the farmers of that county pay most careful attention to their trees in winter clearing them of all dead wood moss c Mr Andrews packed up his whole crop of apples in hampers and sent them all except a  very few  stinted ones Apples that year were such rarities that Mrs Berkeley suggested to Dr Berkeley to send them to Lambeth Palace which was speedily done a few only being reserved as curiosities and a most acceptable offering they proved Dr and Mrs Berkeley going to make some stay at Lambeth Palace soon after the first day after dinner from some apples being on the table the Archbishop with  his wonted politeness said  "Lady and Gentleman will you not eat some of your  own  fine apples How came it to pass that  your  trees produced this wonderfully scarce year"  To which Dr Berkeley replied  "Alas my good Lord we had not a score on all our trees They are the grateful offering of a very grateful man Mr Andrews and my wife thought that as  we  owed the apples to your Grace's goodness to him they ought in  conscience  to be sent to your Grace"  who with his accustomed pleasantry turning to Mrs Berkeley who had the honour to be a great favourite with his Grace said  "Why my good young lady I don't know that I ought to accept  th  se apples  I am afraid they are a  little simoniacal  "  To which Mrs Berkeley replied  "Oh no my Lord if they had come  before  your Grace had preferred Mr Andrews it might have been a case for Bishop Taylor's  Ductor Dubitantium  but I think as it is your Grace may eat them with a  very safe conscience  "  His Grace laughed heartily and said  "I remember Arch bishop Potter used to tell of a man whom he had given a small living on which grew a remarkably fine peartree He used every year to send the pears to Lambeth His Grace gave him a second much better living and he used to say 'Whether the peartree  died  or the pears were  blighted every year  I know not but I know that I  never saw another pear  after I gave the  second  living"  This GRATEFUL man did not probably like the PUBLICATOR  expect one of the  three  stalls at Canterbury He was at least  modest  if ungrateful  It is not possible to avoid contrasting two men both of whom were indebted for their first comfortable establishment in life to the exquisite amiability of Dr Berkeley the Reverend Dr Glasse and the PUBLICATOR When Mr Monck Berkeley was about six or seven years old Dr Glasse said more than once  "If you and Mrs Berkeley would confide your little man to me how happy should I be what care and attention I would pay him and I am sure if you would condescend to  accept  it I desire neither fee nor reward"  The last grateful offer was of course thankfully declined and from Mr Berkeley's birth his Father determined that if God spared his life he should be educated at a Public School often lamenting that the good Bishop had not sent  him  to one particularly after his son grew up often saying  "he had then got a second guardian"  Bishop Berkeley at one time for several years paid four hundred pounds  per annum  to different masters to instruct his children in Music Painting Fencing Riding and French the Latin and Greek he entrusted to none but himself His sons were never suffered either to ride or walk out unattended by a careful servant  When Dr Berkeley came to Oxford at the age of nineteen attended by a most respectable worthy Chaplain of  his Father's and his own servant he had never rode a mile alone and he had contracted an habit of meditating and composing on horseback which occasioned his being the most careless of riders leaving the horse's bridle so very loose that he was perpetually thrown Soon after his marriage Mrs Berkeley finding this to be the case made it a point that he never should ride without a servant When Mr Berkeley grew up he joined in what Dr Berkeley called his Mother's  persecution  and one day said  "What is the reason I would fain know why your Mother lets you ride fifty miles without a servant and over hedge and ditch nobody knows where hunting and won't let me ride to Taplow or Maidenhead alone"  To which Mr Berkeley replied  "Ah my dear Sir if  you  had been  buffeted  for seven years though Eton School  I dare say my  Mother would have let you ride alone as  Mr Berkeley constantly hunted with buckhounds twice a weekfrequently with Mr Clayton's hounds It was not  so quietly  as Mr Monck Berkeley supposed for Dr Berkeley used to say on hunting days  "  prays the whole morninglet me go into the dressingroom ever so often I am sure to hear"Berkeley is not come homeGOD watch over him and send him safe" These ejaculations were frequently continued till the afternoon They were certainly heard by HIM who heareth prayer and as it should seem answered for Mr Berkeley never once got a fall in huntinghe rode remarkably well"  He never would cross his Majesty in the chase He used frequently to express indignation at a hunting butcher particularly well mounted who used to cross so as sometimes to endanger his Majesty saying  "What can the fellow be made of to be such a savage"  to which Dr Berkeley used to say  "Why of bulls hides to be sure"  quietly as she  does me but that is out of the question for ride alone you must not that is agreed on all hands"  To which Dr Berkeley replied  "I am sure you are obliged to  me  Sir I wish I had been buffeted  any where  in my youth as you have been you rogue"  But to return from this digression to the contrast of as Mrs George Berkeley ever termed him the really grateful Dr Glasse We have seen his kind offer in the preceding page we will now proceed to the PUBLICATOR's polite refusal When Archbishop Cornwallis visited at Canterbury he was of course at the Deanery It was impossible that the attendant Bishop should be also lodged there On a consultation concerning the place where he should be received and entertained not one of the Prebendaries seemed desirous of that honour The generous hospitable Dr Lynch was not then a member of the choir and it must in justice be said that numbers of the Prebendaries who are not in office let their prebendal houses and are only visitors or boarders to their tenants so they have it not in their power to receive any one It was suggested that the Prelate must be contented to go to one of the miserably bad excessively dear inns in the city This shocked Dr Berkeley although only the son of a poor UNKNOWN Irish Prelate and he instantly said  "Bad as my house is it is better than a nasty dirty inn he shall be my guest"  As soon as it was known who the attending Bishop was Dr  Berkeley wrote a polite letter requesting the honour of having his Lordship for his guest Mrs Berkeley requested her amiable consort to permit her to invite his lady with whom she had the honour to be acquainted and whose lovely eldest sister sweet beautiful Miss Maddox was a beloved friend of her childhood Bishop Maddox when a Welsh bishop had for several summers a house at East Burnham in the neighbourhood of White Waltham That lovely creature died early The Editor cherishes with tender care a keepsake a small silver medal given by the good Bishop to his sweet daughter to present to her little friend  Some days before the arrival of the Archbishop c Dr Berkeley said  "the children then both living at home and going to Dr Beauvoir's school will be horridly in the servants' way for we must keep open house for a fortnight What can we do with them"  Mrs Berkeley said  "She would contrive it as well as she could they should get a cold dinner at one and be off to play directly"  Mrs Frinsham then at Dr Berkeley's said  "You know I am going to Ramsgate and I will take  one  "  It was Dr Berkeley replied  "You are very kind you shall take Robert and it has just occurred to me that I will send Berkeley to ***** HE will be glad of an opportunity of obliging ME"  Dr Berkeley was alas ever too apt to judge of others by his amiable self Delighted  with this idea he wrote to the PUBLICATOR stating his situation and saying  "On such a day John will deliver into your care my eldest boy for a fortnight at the expiration of which I shall fetch him home"  By the return of the post Dr Berkeley received a letter from the PUBLICATOR saying  "that he was very sorry that it so happened that he could not possibly receive his little  Nor spelt but always so pronounced by the  elegant  Publicator when speaking of the young gentlemen his boarders  "My bouys"  or of his own son who was a remarkably elegant lad The Editor has not seen him since he was a very pleasing youth when she advised his father in return for the Latin and Greek he taught his son to make him teach him a little politeness Dr Berkeley said  "Nobody flatters ***** like  my wife  "  on which Mrs Berkeley fired and said  "  I  flatter him how can you say so"    "Nay I will prove it for whenever he is here you won't suffer any body else to speak but say do pray hold you tongueS that  I  may hear what ***** says"  about Botany Farming c in which he is well skilled  bouy  but that he had just settled all matters to take his pupils to the sea to shew them the shipping and give them a week's pleasureit was unlucky but it could not be helped"  Dr Berkeley flew with this letter to Mrs Berkeley saying  "Well this is the luckiest thing in the world"  then redde the epistle observing  "it will make Berkeley" just then turned of eleven years old and as an excellent judge used to say "the bestbred properly behaved child of that age in England no affected manly airs but a sweetly polite lad" "as happy as a prince poor fellow"  Dr Berkeley notified this by letter immediately to the PUBLICATOR who  instantly  returned the following  elegant grateful  answer The letter is carefully preserved  "My dear Friend his constant familiar address to Dr Berkeley  I cannot  help thinking  you very unreasonable  in wanting to fasten your Son upon  me  especially at a time when I have told you that  I cannot  take him"  The letter goes on in the same  elegant  style Poor Dr Berkeley was for the time  very very  angry indeed and Mrs Berkeley  maliciously  laughed at the  gratitude  of his  dear Friend  After some time Dr Berkeley wrote a letter to the Publicator and as was frequently his custom when going out to dinner passing from his study threw half a dozen letters on the table in Mrs Berkeley's dressingroom saying  "I am in haste I shall be distanced pray seal these unsealed ones and send them all with yours to post"  The letter to the  grateful  Friend was safely sealed and Mrs Berkeley having very little of our grandmother Eve's curiosity in her composition did not ask permission to read it but hollowing it up she with a good pen wrote as plainly as she could contrive to do the little word  gratitude  Off went the letter to the post In a few days Dr Berkeley coming into the drawingroom to tea said  "I have got a letter from ***** in which he seems much disquieted He asks what could possibly induce some member of my family to write on the edge of the inside of the letter I last wrote to him the word  gratitude  My dear do you know any thing about it"  Mrs Berkeley from her cradle to she  trusts her coffin too proud to tell a lie instantly replied  "To be sure I do for  I  wrote it"  Dr Berkeley said  "Why would you write"    "Because  I  think it a  mighty pretty word  "    "Your wrath against ***** like most violent blazes has abated"  The Editor cannot dismiss the PUBLICATOR without remarking that had it pleased the Divine Goodness to have spared Dr Berkeley to have seen the contempt  endeavoured  to be thrown on his very deeplylearned justly universally admired Father his indignation would  not  have subsided as it for some time did on account of his little Son Dr Berkeley never did never would forgive a greater man than even the Publicator for speaking as he thought improperly against his excellent Father for which great man and his incomparable writings he had through life the greatest respect  "RAMBLER John"  as Dr Berkeley who generally redde a Rambler once a week termed that great man His Son always called him the noble learned Bear The accident happening at Oxford was too well known then too well remembered by many gentlemen then present still living to be here detailed Suffice it therefore to say that Johnson's want of  le savoir vivre  occasioned his ridiculing Bishop Berkeley's American scheme by which he meant to introduce Episcopacy there always declaring  "if it was not done in a few years the Colonies would revolt from the Mother Country"  The event has shown that this  unknown  Prelate was not a  false  Prophet What the Father could not accomplish the Son contrived to bring about by his interest with the Scotch Bishops the very excellent very deeply learned Bishop Skinner the very pious Bishop Falconer who died soon after and the amiable worthy Sir John Strachan Baronet as now that he is no more may be  publicly  known In a letter to a Friend written some time after Dr Berkeley says  "I was well aware that it would  never  be forgiven but I rejoice that I have done it"  Dr Berkeley selt his amiable heart gratified in rendering every possible service in his power to the repeal of Lord Hardwicke's horrid act after the Rebellion in Had Dr Berkeley's advice been adhered to the first attempt had succeeded when the three Scotch Prelates came over the first time to solicit it but in most transactions there is generally a Marplot Dr Berkeley was particularly happy in entertaining at his house in Berkshire and endeavouring to return the very polite hospitality of Sir John Strachan to himself and family at Dundee and of Bishop Skinner to his Son when at Aberdeen where Mr Monck Berkeley had the freedom of the city presented to him as he had of several other cities and towns in Scotland and a licence presented to shoot on very manor wherever he went He spent near a fortnight at Taymouth most agreeably The Editor fears to trust her once retentive now alas treacherous  memory to say of sixteen gentlemen who sat down to dinner every day how many were John Campbell This came out accidentally Some one not knowing Mr Berkeley's partiality for Scotland said  "How ridiculous they are calling themselves by the names of their estates"  Mr Berkeley reddened and said  "Pray Sir why so how would you have them distinguish themselves"    "Why by their Christian names as we do"    "That will not do Sir The mode of distinguishing several brothers in a public school  major minor  c will not do nor will  first second third  do"  He then mentioned as above related The worthy learned Laird of Ahaladar certainly not spelt right by the Editor although so pronounced and his accomplished amiable eldest son both much beloved by Mr Berkeley were two of near half a score John Campbells Mr Berkeley retained a most grateful sense of the kind elegant hospitality at Ahaladar Talking frequently after his return from College of Jack Ahaladar his brother asked  "Who is Jack Ahaladar of whom you talk so much"  "Why the  young  Laird a charming young manYOU would like  him  "  Probably now the elegant Laird of Ahaladar as the Editor thinks she was told the worthy old Laird is dead He presented Mr Berkeley with a very curious original letter which when the Editor can afford to print the second volume of Literary Relics will be published in it  To return from this digression Dr Johnson had no sooner finished his rude sentence than Dr then Mr Berkeley then a little turned of twenty rose from his seat reached his cap made his bow and to the no small distress of the gentleman who had invited him to meet Dr Johnson quitted the room in great indignation before supper On some of the company intimates of Dr Johnson reproaching him for his  conduct HE made a sort of  amende honorable  by saying  "Why I think the Bishop's scheme no bad one but I abused it to take down the young gentleman lest he should be too vain of having had SUCH A FATHER"  Some one presumed to say Mr Berkeley was exquisitely wellbred not at all insolent to which he replied  "No not at all but I thought it might do him good to mortify him  a little  "  Dr Johnson wished to have written the Bishop's life but Dr Berkeley said  "he would not furnish him with any documents"  which Mr Monck Berkeley used exceedingly to regret saying to his Father  "My dear Sir it will never be so written as Johnson would have written it"  to which Dr Berkeley used to reply  "It may be so but I was resolved HE should not write it You may if you please"  Dr Johnson through a common friend made many attempts to visit Dr Berkeley in Berkshire and once said  "I have a good mind to go down to Cookham and see what they would say to me"  Mrs Berkeley hoped that her beloved partner would have said  "We should be very happy to see him"  but his reply was  "No the man that could speak slightingly of my great Father shall never be entertained under his Son's roof"  It is therefore probable that this respectful mention of Bishop Berkeley by the PUBLICATOR would have completed the business begun by the smothering of the Consecration Sermon for four years  Dr Berkeley preserved all the letters he received except now and then one which he flung into the fire before he appeared to have redde it through and like his Father and Dean Swift some he never opened at all but threw them into a drawer After his lamented death the Editor found a baker's dozen fourteen from a fleecing Ingrate with the seal unbroken as she told the man when obliged to hold a short conversation with him It has been often said of the Editor's grandfather the celebrated Francis Cherry Esquire that he met with more Ingrates than any other man ever did I suppose of most persons of very large fortunes and very liberal minds it may with equal truth be asserted Dr Berkeley's fortune was by no means large but his  soul  was noble He by his wise advice and direction made the fortunes of great numbers Mrs Berkeley used often to say to him  "My dear friend you can make the fortune of every one you take in hand but yourself and your Son and you will not stir a stroke for  him  "  His reply constantly was  "I cannot help it I cannot ask or push for myself or for him If others do  not it must remain undone by me"  Both are now happily provided for by  "  that Friend who sticketh closer than a brother  "  both are receiving the reward of their labour of love to real friends and base ingrates whom may God for Christ's sake forgive prays the Editor  Having been  obliged necessarily obliged  to descant so much on that odious temper of the mind INGRATITUDE she turns with double treble pleasure to what her beloved respected friend Mrs Duncombe has ever obligingly observed is the prominent feature in her character to whom that lady has repeatedly said  "No one can do any thing for you but give you a dish of tea a very delightful solace  A pleasure  now  almost totally lost to the Editor  "  a poor oldfashioned creature  "  who does not like that solace at halfpast seven or eight she not being able to sleep without a small quantity of maltliquor a most excellent safe narcotic so much so that for very many years she never took it at night as it prevented her rising at five in the morningwhen she was young to improve her own mind afterwards to attend to her childrens Not long ago about a quarter after nine just as the Editor was sitting down to her slice of French roll and glass of beer her servant announcing the arrival of a Lady in the drawingroom the Editor involuntarily said  "If it had been five minutes later I had supped and it would have been so pleasant to have enjoyed  conversation after supper"  which was that night unavoidably deferred until  halfpast ten  The Editor rejoices that her spirit is not as wilful as her sadly weakened stomach which suffers direfully if it does not get the  very small  dinner it will receive at three and so on in course according to the VULGAR hours in use years ago  surely in pleasant company without your setting about to think what  return  you shall make them"  The Editor ever  did still does labour as Lord Burleigh in his letter advises his son ROBERT on a  very  different principle to advance his OWN interest  "to find out  something  that may be acceptable to his great and noble friends"  The Editor having been still being joint possessor with her excellent Sister of some curious things collected by their accomplished grandfather Francis Cherry Esquire a great Antiquary and curious Collector before Antiquarian Societies were formed has generally been so fortunate as to select some token of her gratitude to offer to her Son's friends of highest rank more substantial than words well remembering the saying of a witty old servant of her Mother's who lived with her before the Editor's birth and died at near an hundred last summer This worthy woman's uncommon wit introduced her as nurse to all the lyingin ladies and sick gentlemen and ladies in the neighbourhood whose spirits she by her wit kept up when the apothecary's cordial failed to do it This humane woman when at her own home always nursed the poorest of her neighbours  gratis  She was a pious woman and is now receiving the reward of her  "labours of love"  She when persons said  much  and did  little  would looking archly sing from an old song  "Aye aye  "Words  fine  words are  but  WIND" c  So  has  ever thought the Editor so  may  she ever think whilst she possesses any thing else to offer But there are those who withhold  even  those witness the learned PUBLICATOR and another  infamous  INGRATE who owed to Dr Berkeley wonderful obligations indeed being in the receipt of near two thousand pounds  per annum  at the time of his death but he is spared for the present his excellent amiable brother having accidentally stumbled once on Mr Monck Berkeley at Bath and having there and ever after until his death paid him every polite respectful attention and it would wound the lovely tender heart of that gentleman to see his worthless brother's corrupt base putrid heart dissected Some few years before his universally  unlamented  death he CONDESCENDED to visit Dr Berkeley He was often for weeks within three miles of him without doing it  One morning the Honourable Mr  came in saying  "I should not have visited you just yet as I am much in debt but that I come to  bring you a message from  Doctor  He has been staying with me these last ten days"  Doctor Berkeley replied  "So I heard or I had visited you"    "This morning when he was going away he said  nonchalantly  Mr ******** I beg the favour of you when you see Doctor Berkeley to give my compliments to him and tell him I should have waited upon him but the weather has been so catching I could not venture to Cookham"  Mr  replied  "Oh I shall see him very soon for we meet often"    "So I have come down to day on purpose to bring you the message not for fear  I should forget it  "  adding  "I did long to have said there are plenty of postchaises at March's and that you have money to pay the hire of one is owing to Doctor Berkeley"  In a large company some gentleman gave  "Doctor Berkeley"  for his toast and turning to Doctor  said  "I am sure Sir you will drink my toast in a bumper"  He rolled his  boiled fishes eyes  exhibited his exceedingly fine teeth and asked  "Why so Sir"  The gentleman spiritedly replied  "If you do not know Sir I shall not tell you"  The very learned very worthy Mr Whitaker formerly Curate of his beloved friend Doctor Berkeley was one of the company  On this person's getting his first preferment Dr  Berkeley generously lent him one hundred pounds to get things a little decent in his house and had some difficulty a few years after to get it repaid Dr Berkeley was gone out on horseback Mrs Berkeley heard the bell of the front gate ring Nobody appearing she rang to enquire who it was the servant above named said  "It was Dr  "    "How came it that he he did not come in"    "I told him Madam that my Master was out he asked for you but I thought you did not wish to see him so I told him that my Master and you were going out to dinnerand I believed you were dressing"  This honest man when waiting at table had so often heard the Honourable Mr  and other gentlemen of the neighbourhood abuse  this  INGRATE's  shameful  inattention to Dr Berkeley that he very naturally  supposed  his Mistress who ever resented  ten  times more for her friends than for herself was not very partial to him He is no longer an inhabitant of this world Dr Berkeley's goodness probably hastened his removal to    another  world  Two very different personages are now coming on the  tapis  two grateful or rather one gently amiable the other amiably grateful  Some days before Archbishop Cornwallis's arrival at Canterbury as before mentioned one afternoon the servant announced the arrival of that loveliest of women in mind as well as person the late Mrs Tucker As soon as seated she began in her sweetly musical voice saying  "that having heard that Dr Berkeley was to have the attendant Bishop for his guest" she came to beg that Master Berkeley might be her guest for the next fortnight that she had prepared a bed for him and that the utmost care should be taken of him"  THAT no one in the county of Kent could doubt where her fame as well as in many other counties was as it justly merited blazed abroad  A young gentleman of large fortune at Canterbury School the amiable Richard Tilden Esquire who boarded at the second master's Mr Tucker's was nursed by Mrs Tucker through a dreadful fever Mrs Tucker although then lyingin caused his bed to be removed into her own chamber that  she  might  see  he got his medicines at the appointed hours As soon as sufficiently recovered he was conveyed home where he had not been many days when he requested his Mother he was an orphan to order the coach to carry him back to Mrs Tucker saying  "that he liked  her  nursing better than home nursing"  and the request was complied with This happened before the Editor was resident at Canterbury but has been frequently  related to her by her very sensible worthy friend the late Lady Head and by many other persons  Mr Tilden was a  more  than father to the Editor's youngest Son of whom he was so very fond and to whom he was so very kind that the little creature one day said to his Mother  "Mamma  I  shall never want money for Dick Tilden it is the custom at Canterbury School to call the eldest and all the Brothers by their Christian name "bids me whenever I want a shilling come to him and if any great boy that  I  cannot  manage  beats me he always beats him  soundly  for his pains"  Mr Tilden when the amiable protector of the beauteous little Robert was eighteeny ears old soon going to the university he staid to mourn the death of his grateful little  protegé  How amiable are some youths what  odious  savages are others But the exquisite  unaffected  sweetness of Mrs Tucker the Editor allows  unaffected  sweetness gentleness c c not only infused sweetness into her  own  children but into  most  of her boarders generally sons of the first gentlemen in the county often from other counties  The instance of an amiably  retentive  grateful mind is now to be adduced from  one  of those boarders The Editor received the account from such authority as precludes a possibility of her having been deceived besides as it is often said  "Facts are stubborn things"  The present Lord Thurlow immediately on his receiving the Great Seal applied to a Kentish gentleman  "Has my dear old mistress Mrs Tucker any son that I can provide for"    "No my Lord her eldest son is but twenty"    "Don't tell ME of  twenty  the living of Gravesend shall be held for him till he is  four and twenty  "  That very learned worthy careful now private instructor of youth with his amiable partner has been many years at Gravesend blessing the noble gratitude of the generous GRATEFUL Lord Thurlow Why is gratitude so  very rare  so  scarce  a plant in  human  hearts but that MAN is a FALLEN creature Lions have it dogs have it in a high degree even the feathered tribe have it some of the wildest of them The worthy woman above named as having served the Editor above twenty years is as well as her old fellow servant Mr Wrightson wonderfully tender and kind to the brute creation the Editor's Cook  So much so as to have occasioned the Housekeeper one day telling the Editor that Mr Wrightson and herself had at length extorted a promise from the Cook that when she married she would  not  keep a cat as they were sure she would starve it to death The worthy woman married from Dr Berkeley's and her cat and self are both  en bon point  now living at Cookham  rather negligent of them the housekeeper amused herself with feeding a parcel of Guinea fowls in general very wild birds These creatures although never fed but once a day used to run flocking around her every time she went into the meadows  where they wandered and more than one Sunday it was with considerable difficulty that she got into the church without near forty of her feathered friends escorting her She had reared near thirty of them difficult as the task is the hens being very bad nurses They well knew the hour of feeding was past It was  gratitude  shame to human nature which the famous Dr Cheyne used to say  "was  without  GOD'S GRACE a compound of Brute and Devil"  but these poor quadrupeds and winged fowl have not God's grace and yet  they  shame mankind  The incomparable Mrs Tucker is not held up here as a grateful person in contrast to the PUBLICATOR for  she owed  no gratitude either to Dr or to Mrs Berkeley unless it was for uniting with the  whole  church city and neighbourhood in admiration of the angelic manner in which she treated and attended to the bodies and souls of Mr Tucker's house full of young gentlemen boarders aided by her sedate wise excellent  eldest  daughter her beautiful lovely second daughter then too young for any thing but to be universally admired and beloved which she continues to be in an eminent degree by all who have the pleasure of knowing her and what is above all by her throughly polite accomplished husband Mr Symonds a gentleman of large fortune in Leicestershire Long may she be spared to him and his children  The Editor regrets that she has trespassed so long on the patience of the Reader Having delivered her sentiments freely on Gratitude and Ingratitude it would be unpardonable in her to close this long Preface without acknowledging the great obligations she feels that she lies under to several amiable friends of her excellent Son and of her unworthy self not for any the smallest assistance in scrawling these undigested immethodical pages It would be injustice it would be more it would be cruelty to let it be suspected that any literary friend learned male or cultivated female had the smallest share in this poor performance The Editor is at present too far removed from the press and franking being alas almost annihilated she has not had it in her power even to consult a friend capable of directing or advising her one only excepted who was  too tenderly  affected at hearing half a dozen lines  redde  however excellently qualified to direct advise or correct any  hobbling  sentence  The Editor's Son used often to regret that his Mother would not write Poetry saying  "he was very sure she  could  if she  would  "  as did a poetical friend of her youth whose name often appears in Dodsley's Collection of Poems Had either lived to see how lamentably she acquits herself in Prose it had saved her some persecution Both were more angry at her repeated declarations that she did not love Poetry very rarely redde it excepting Dr Young's  Night Thoughts and some parts of Milton c The poetry of De la Crusca must charm a savage  In Mr Monck Berkeley's benevolent vindication in the Author's Preface to the Poems he exhorts people to remember that the Reviewers are but MEN If those Gentlemen condescend to review a few pages written by a feminine pen the Editor wishes them to remember that she is a  Woman  a suffering OLD  Woman  with most of the accomplishments at threescore that most females have at  "the age of man"  ten years laterthat she served an apprenticeship to  extreme  anxiety and anguish for very near seven yearsseeing daily the declining state of health of the two nearest and dearest connections in life obliged to  affect  ease and often cheerfulness whilst her heart bled at every vein Unfortunately for her both Father and Son through their lives declared that if the Editor's constant even cheerfulness never high never low failed both would give themselves up to absolute despair The strong exertions necessary to act the part to  their  satisfaction have certainly brought on a premature old age and the Editor according to the witty wise pious Bishop Taylor  "is quite readydressed for the grave"  whither she seems hasting apace The Bishop in his "Holy Dying" says  "dim eyes gray hairs stiff joints"  c c are all so many  "  dressings  for the grave"  He does not add dulled faculties  I  am sure he might although  perhaps HE might not feel it his own wit being  too well  tempered to have the keenness of its edge blunted by aught but death itself That is the lot of but very few Perhaps the great Mr Burke may escape it who yet ten years ago complained of his tongue and his fingers They have however enabled him to hold his pen to bestow  heavy  although  very just  chastisement where it was meet and right to do it Long may he wield it a terror one should hope to  "all who offend through MALICIOUS WICKEDNESS"  to whom the Psalmist speaking by the Holy Spirit beseeches God the Father NOT to be merciful  To attempt doing justice to the goodness of Friends some now no longer inhabitants of earth to Mr Berkeley's or to his Parent's gratitude would require a ream of paper now like most other things become a very dear commodity Through the course of this work written by hasty snatches sometimes laid by for many months untouched so as to have occasioned much disagreeable tautology the copy was never transcribed so that it was sent rough to the press and much gratitude is due to the Printer for his patience in decyphering all the interlineations in it without the aid of the worthy Sir Francis Willesthe same person and the same action brought twice on the  tapis  when once would have donebut much fault has been found with the author of "Anecdotes of the two last and present Centuries" for not relating every thing at  the same time of many of the personages perhaps they might not come to the author's knowledge until the first part was printed off as many things have occurred to the now treacherous memory of the Editor after it was too late to insert them in their proper place She has therefore taken leave to insert them in a less proper one for which she thinks she ought rather to beg her own pardon for being such a fool as to insert the mat all than the Reader's for inserting perhaps at page what if method had been attended to ought to have been placed at page  The amiable generous kindness of Mr Monck Berkeley's relations at Eton the Reverend John Hayes now eldest son of James Hayes Esquire of Holyport and the laborious endeavours of his brother Charles both several years older than Mr Berkeley of course being excellent scholars much higher in the school to  make  his little kinsman as studious as himself have been noticed above as also the partiality of his beloved respected tutor the learned Dr Norbury and the kindness of Dr Langford whilst in the lower school who yet once offended him most highly  Dr Berkeley finding fault one holyday that he was not advanced in Greek as he ought to have been he indignantly replied  "Ah I wonder I am not worse but I am sure I shall be well improved by the next holydays"  Dr Berkeley  "How so child"  Mr B  "Why I will tell you the truth At  such a time so many of us were to give in an exercise and when Dr L  had redde them all over he said Berkeley yours is a very much better exercise than Mr  's" naming a nobleman's son who with that elegant wisdom which has ever marked Eton school and rendered the youths even the little boys the best bred polite beings one can see whilst some other great schools as a very learned accomplished man always used to say are a set of savages a nest of hornets are always styled Mr  the sons of private gentlemen without that very proper distinction "Mr  's exercise is not  near  so good as yours but  he  shall gain the place because his is as good an one as he is capable of writing and yours is not your best by any means Good as it is  I  know and you know you could have made it a great deal better therefore  he  shall have the place On this declaration I was so exceedingly angry that I resolved not to learn a word of Greek for six months The time is just now expired and so I shall set to it again"  Dr Berkeley exclaimed  "Good God child how could you be such a fool"    "I cannot help it Sir I was angry and  I made a vow  and  I resolved  to keep it come what would"  Mr Berkeley was as has been shewn before steady as a rockLater in life he made a more important  vow One night at Brooks's he and his learned beloved Eton St Andrew's friend the learned T Hobhouse Esquire were drawn in to play deeper than Mr Berkeley at least ought to have done The amiable worthy Mr Hobhouse has a very good maternal estate Mr Berkeley as is usual won a frightfully large sum soon lost it again and all the money in his purse and much more than he had at his chambers to pay it Very providentially Mrs Frinsham happened to be in town Early the next morning he posted off to Duke Street Mrs Frinsham somewhat surprized at hearing from her servant that Mr Berkeley was come before nine o'clock went out to him the case was related and that generous friend instantly enabled him to discharge his  first  his  last gaming  debt telling him  "that she never felt such pleasure arising from having money at command"  She has in her youth often relieved so very largely as to deny herself for months the elegant necessaries of young ladies to accommodate a particular friend or an old acquaintance Mr Berkeley going down soon after to his father's on the evening of his arrival asked his Mother  "If she had heard what a  fool  her son had been"  to which she replying  "That she did not recollect having ever heard him called a fool by any one but his  Father  and  Mother  now and then"  he related the abovementioned circumstance adding  "My dear Mother you may set  your heart at rest  from any fear of your Son's ever becoming a gamester  for as soon  as  I got home to the Temple I kneeled down and besought God to cast out my prayer if EVER I again played for any sum more than I could well afford to lose playing now and then with one's neighbours in the country on a winter evening"  It has I believe been mentioned above that Mr Berkeley whenever he did play which was very seldom and a very indifferent whistplayer he was almost constantly wonAll his winnings went to relieve the poor  But to return Dr Berkeley told his son that Dr L  acted highly right and that he should have esteemed it rather a compliment than a punishment To which he replied  "No NO Sir not if you had ever been at school and knew  what  it was to lose a place He said aloud 'That mine was by much the best exercise' and he  ought  therefore in  justice  to have given  me  the place"  Mr Berkeley was then a child he thought differently of the matter a few years afterwards  Mr Berkeley certainly did not inherit his wonderful daring resoluteness either from his amiable Father or from his Mother but probably as well as his fine figure from his Mother's father whom the Editor has frequently heard relate the following fact concerning himself  "Mr Frinsham lost his beautiful mother at twentyfour just when he was five years old"  His father lived a widower  near fifty years Some time before her death the servant went into the room where they were at breakfast saying that  "Master would not eat his mess for breakfast but wanted coffee  like  his Mamma"  Up sprang his Father saying  "  I will give him coffee  "  went and gave him a good whippingstill the mess was refuseda second whipping with no better successat length a third when his mother called out  "Mr Frinsham let him alone if he won't eat it now he will eat it when he is hungry don't whip him any more"    "I will whip him till  tomorrow morning  if he does not eat it before"  The Editor has frequently heard her father say  "that he had resolved to endure seven or eight flagellations"  but the declaration  "that they should be continued until the next morning"  determined him to eat it immediately which he accordingly did always observing how wise it was to break children of stubbornness in their infancy It probably eradicated it in Mr Frinsham for a sweeter tempered child never lived as the Editor has frequently heard a worthy woman declare who went to keep his father's house on the death of his Mothershe lived to near ninety and always made an annual visit at Mr and after his death at Mrs Frinsham'sthat  "he was the most amiable of children and of youths"  When Mr Frinsham sent his sons to Oxford this careful servant went to take care of another and a third set of poor motherless children by which means and the little bounties of her adopted  children she obtained sufficient to maintain her more than decently genteely She was ever a parlour guest in all the gentlemen's families whom she had brought up She had by her father in very early youth been married to a gentleman who deserted her and went to live abroad she was therefore a  safe  housekeeper for young widowers Her first service was Mr Frinsham's Father's The Editor has frequently since she grew up heard her say  "that her mother going to visit her soon after she went thither addressed her thus 'My dear child this is a very heavy charge that you have taken upon yourself If you do not take the utmost care the  same  care of these beautiful little children Mr Frinsham's younger brother was a remarkably handsome man never expect my blessing but my curse shall surely light upon you"  Poor Mrs Grove used to say  "I felt horror at the thoughts of my mother's curse"  It was mentioned above that a desperate ague obliged Mrs Berkeley to resign the task of nursing her son to another The person who a few years before had nursed Charles Hayes Esquire now Fellow of King's College was by his dear tenderly beloved mother of whose amiable sweetness to the rich and godlike charity and compassion to  all  the surrounding poor the Editor often thinks sometimes talks with extatic delight when she reflects that she is gone to Him who inspired and is  now  rewarding those lovely tempers May her sons when they  venture  to marry meet with ladies as amiable as worthy as their lovely mother as sensible as their great grandmother not famed for sweet temper the Editor's great aunt eldest daughter of William Cherry Esquire as a reward for their kind care of their little kinsman at EtonThe Editor says  "  venture  "  marriage was always a lottery  never  resembling Mr Pitt's  "  not two blanks to a prize  "  but where there are not two prizes to two hundred WORSE than BLANKS How can  ill  educated girls make  good  wives But men must thank their  own  follyThis lady was as beautiful as she was lovely exceedingly resembling a very fine original picture of Anne Boleyn in the collection of an hereditary friend of the Editor's the late James Warren Esquire great uncle of the brave worthy Sir John Borlase Warren  This brave excellent officer some few years ago met with it is hoped a singular instance of ingratitude That more than nineteen out of twenty voters at Great Marlow Bucks know A from B is owing to the noble charity school founded by the ancestors of Sir John Borlase Warren who resided at his feat at Little Marlow and laid out much money with them and a very few years ago these worse than  sea  monsters ousted him of his seat in parliament for Marlow Sir John Borlase Warren with proper spirit the spirit of his very antient family sold his great estate in Bucks and removed from that county one of its most antient respectable families Had the Editor time she would relate a very curious anecdote of the  great  gratitude of Sir John Borlase Warren's greatgrandsire who married the rich heiress of Sir John Borlase and which has been repeatedly related to her by his Son the above named James Warren Esquire  Mr Warren  meeting Mrs Hayes sometimes at the Editor's Mother's house always termed her  Cousin Anne  Judge Hayes used frequently to say  "that his son Charles and Dr Berkeley's both owed their bold intrepid spirits to their nurse the most courageous of females having once nearly killed a young man who attempted to take some improper liberties with her when she could hardly be styled a woman"  Mr Charles Hayes and Mr Monck Berkeley were very generous to her when they grew up Mr Hayes always admired the wonderful genius of Mr Berkeley who sometimes passed the short holydays of Whitsuntide at Holyport with his kind kinsmen The Judge one day exclaimed  "Well I never saw such a creature in my life as Berkeley I am persuaded that if I were to say I am in distress how to get five hundred pounds conveyed to the Lord Mayor of York Berkeley would instantly start up and say 'Dear Sir give me leave to go and carry it for you' not feeling any impropriety at the idea of a boy of just then thirteen being so employed and what is more I am sure if he undertook it he would execute it as well at thirteen as any man of three and twenty He is a most wonderful being"  Indeed his bright genius shone forth in a splendid manner to the last breath he drew  Mr Berkeley ever retained a grateful sense of kind invitations from friends at Windsorthe late Lady Colerance his Mother's near relation the amiable excellent Mrs Chessyre the Lady of his Mother's old  very intimate  friend the late agreeable Dr Bostock Canon of Windsor and his relation good Mrs Hayes and the very worthy Mr Trevanian  Any attempt to enumerate and descant on as they merit the innumerable amiable respectful attentions paid to Mr Berkeley even by strangers to every thing but his name and connections in the Land of kind Hospitality would fill almost as many pages as the learned accomplished Mr Malone has filled in defending his favourite the immortal Shakspeare Had Mr Monck Berkeley been living it had doubtless roused the ire of that young Poet but Mr Malone needs no coadjutor in any business that worthy gentleman takes in hand  The Antiquarian Society of Edinburgh did Mr Berkeley the honour to elect him a member when he was only nineteen years old an honour perhaps never before confirmed on one so very young on his sending them a most excellent account of a very curious quarry in the heart of the Highlands Mr Berkeley had the honour to have the freedom of Aberdeen and some other cities and of many  towns presented to him He constantly delivered them to his Mother requesting her to take great care of them  How would Mr Berkeley's spirit have been roused had he lived to hear the  The throughly brave are never cruel There are few who have not heard the bravery of Lord Balcarras at Saratoga under General Burgoyne His Lordship's gun  did  his coat still  does  remain no doubt at Balcarras a proof of itThe Editor thinks she mentioned it in the St James's Chronicle she has not now time to turn to the paper She has been told when indignantly reprobating the charge that it was occasioned by ENVYThe Holy Scripture asks  "Who can stand before ENVY"  Not even the amiable worthy Lord Balcarrashow much less then the little insignificant Editor who has alas suffered sorely from that  odious  passion that to her  unnatural  disease of the mind Having thank God never felt it she conceived herself too unimportant in the scale of beings to have exited it  gentle pleasing mild Lord Balcarras ACCUSED of  hunting men  to death with  bloodhounds  His  able  pen would instantly have been employed in vindicating his noble respected beloved friend The feeble one of the Editor ventures to assert that a few years must have wrought a  wonderful  change in that very amiable gentle nobleman if it is not as probable that he would horsewhip his lovelyhearted Countess as did the late horrid Colonel D  his lady aided by his still more horrid footman or of guillotining his beautiful sister the Countess of Hardwicke Those who have had the pleasure of living four years in his Lordship's  neighbourhood  Once when Mr Monck Berkeley was gone to spend some happy days at Balcarras it occurred to Lord Balcarras that Mr Berkeley had never slept in old NOLL's bed still standing in that beautiful mansion always styled by the Editor  "the  Scotch Cliefden  "  there is great similarity in the situation c and he declared he should sleep in itTo which Mr Berkeley replied  "Not unless I have your Lordship's sword by my bedside for the old  villain  knowing how much I detested him will  certainly  visit me  before midnight  "  It was not very likely Mr Berkeley should have been retired before that hour from such agreeable company At another time when Mr Berkeley was staying at Balcarras a very agreeable sensible relation of Lord Balcarras being more than a little  fou  the elegant Scotch word for our ugly word  drunk  there was much difficulty in conveying him to his chamber When arrived there all retired but Lord Balcarras and Mr Monck Berkeleywhilst they were cajoling him to let them undress him he prayed very earnestly to God they smiled at his repeatedly asking them  "What must become of his  beautiful  soul"  At length Lord Balcarras said  "My dear Berkeley how devout  is  now  that he is  OU"  This gentleman  not famed  for devotion had received a very pious education and was  always devout  when dr  k if not too far gone  could as readily believe that the sun shone at midnight to light these hunters  To the introduction of his friend Mr Lennard Mr Berkeley was indebted for the happiness of enjoying an intimate friendship with the excellent Sir J Clarke of PennyCuicke and his charming Lady daughter of Mr Dacre of the North to whom Mr Lennard was related He admired their amiable virtues and revered their goodness And invitation whenever he was in Edinburgh and had no  more agreeable  engagement to visit that excellent pair it was impossible should ever be obliterated from the memory  of Mr Berkeiey or his greateful Parents The goodness of their very agreeable worthy countryman Commissioner Wharton and the excellent Lady Sophia to Dr Mrs and Mr Monck Berkeley on their first arrival in Edinburgh to whom they were introduced by the worthy hereditary friends of Mrs Berkeley Mrs Edlins daughters of the excellent Baron Edlin whose pious Lady and daughters remarkably bountiful to the poor are still the subject of admiration and praise in Edinburgh are still dwelt on with unfeigned gratitude and delight Happy the poor who reside near the few still surviving ladies of that worthy family  When at St Andrew's in Scotland Mr Monck Berkeley used to say  "Well it is a mercy that I am not  quite so much  in love with Lady Elizabeth Lindsey as my Mother is If I was I must run away with her not as  we  say to Scotland but to England and that would be a  fine  story"  The lovely polite  unaffected  sweet  real  gentleness of that lovely Lady are doubtless the source of much domestic felicity to her Lord Her Ladyship is the Editor verily believes or nothing should cause her to write it one of the  very  few  genuine  gentle spirits scattered here and there to be admired and alas for poor unlucky simple men to be  counterfeited  Dr Berkeley used always to say there was nothing he disliked so much as  "  a mighty pretty sort of young woman  "  Mrs Berkeley used to reply  "that  she hoped nobody would ever style her such when  he  was present"  He used to say  "that he detested insipidity"  Such as she was he had her  "  for better for worse  "  thirtyfour years One of those horrid horse leeches ever draining her too too generous husband having since his death told her at her lawyer's chambers  "That Dr Berkeley married  her  for her money"  Wonderful assertion as Mrs Berkeley's fortune was only a few odd thousands and when he was urged to take a lady much in love with him who had  more  than a hundred thousand pounds The Editor feels herself obliged after this WONDERFUL assertion from a lowlived Divine who educated by John Wesley perhaps never  saw  any University until at Dr Berkeley's expence to say that Dr Berkeley has repeatedly declared to his son in her presence  "Have not I told you over and over that had I been Duke of Norfolk or Robinson Crusoe your Mother is the woman in the whole world that I would have chosen for a wife"  adding what it is impossible for the Editor to write  "* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * and she could and would make matters comfortable pleasant on that island"  adding  "I have always told you I believe your Mother has the best temper to live with for happiness of any person in the world"  Not many weeks before his lamented death he said to several persons friends and servants  "She is the  best wife in the world"  God knows that she feels ever did feel how far she fell short in most relations of life of the resolutions she made very early in life to labour if ever she did marry to make the best wife in the world and if God  blessed  her with children the best mother Alas she repeats it she  feels  that she fell short and yet such is the frailty of our fallen nature that were the time to be gone over again she fears she could not much mend her hand As mistress of a family she from early youth resolved to treat her servants just as she would wish them to treat her were they instantly to exchange stations Perhaps this has sometimes gone rather too far A beloved friend of her's nicknamed by the Editor in her youth the Centurioness  "  I say to my servant do this and he doth it  "  frequently told the Editor she was a most incomparable governess of her children and of dogs and cats but that her servants did or did  not  obey her orders  just  as it suited their own convenience adding  "I think they are mighty good kind of people to do any thing you ask them so quietly Pray now  will  you do so"  The Editor as above shewn with her children did not deal in shewing authority with servants as well as children when she set about any thing in good earnest calmly saying  "  I will have this or that done  "  She has ever with both found that  her  word was a law Servants are much to be pitied they have often jobs to finish as well as their  superiors it is grievous to a generous mind to drag them away when half an hour later may do just as well The Editor perhaps is weak illjudging in that as in many other things She had been married more than seven years when her amiable Partner a little warm as the Honourable Mrs  says  "  ALL men are  "    they  certainly are LORDS of the creation and how much is warmth of temper to be preferred to  sullenness  came up into her dressing room saying  "  Do  go down stairs and  try once in your life  if it is  possible  for you to find fault with a servant or not Richard has done  " or has not done  "  the Editor does not recollect which This worthy man was sometimes a little slow in his motions his master was very quick in his His surname was Hyde He was related and as many gentlemen learned in the law supposed heir to a vast unclaimed property in the funds left by a General Hyde who died in the reign of George the First If it were duly considered by masters and mistresses of families that they and their domestics must one day ere long stand  together  at the same RIGHTEOUS bar they would surely prepare to answer when asked if they had taken care to instruct them in their duty to their Master in Heaven or spent the time that might have been so employed in reproaching them for neglecting their duty to their Master on earth These governors of families will be asked  "Did you not allow them time to read  some portion in the Book of God every day If so why did you not at stated hours  God says  "Shall I hide this thing that I do from Abraham"  seeing that I  know  he will COMMAND not gently civilly ask them  but  "COMMAND his children and his household"  c c  compel them to assemble together and hear it redde in your own presence"  Then whether they will hear or whether they will forbear  "Thou Master or Mistress hast delivered thine OWN soul"  as speaks Holy Scripture  Where there is no learning little logic little time the faculties of the mind and body both debilitated by illhealth brought on by severe afflictions as in the Editor's case The word  severe  ought to be expunged if another could be substituted it must be  heavy  for nothing can ought at least to be termed  severe  that is inflicted in love by our heavenly Father on alas a lamentably ungrateful child whose heart is however perpetually quoting from the inspired Prophet  "Wherefore should a man complain a  living  man for the punishment of his sins"  By which the Editor for very many years past has conceived the Holy Spirit meant to imply by a  living  man any one on this side the grave any one who is out of hell for if through Grace MERCY is at the  latest  period sought it will  infallibly  be found witness the Thief on the Cross and a  modern  Thiefalas no poor wretch he was  only  a murderer for he had not the heart to rob when he beheld the blood he had shed converted  brought to Christ not alas by one of those who rush into the priestly office  The Editor heard some time ago when the wretched Mrs Reed now Mrs Edgar was in Gloster gaol that the Chaplain is a worthy DivineThe Editor always regrets when using an Irish Common Prayer Book given her by her beloved Partner that the very fine office for prisoners is not bound up with our even commonest cheapest books of Common Prayer The very fine prayer for those under sentence of death might being redde by the children of the poor at least keep them from the gallows A few years ago a fine youth at one of the great schools was so charmed with it that he requested the Irish youth where it was to exchange with him for a very superb English Common Prayer Book His father was a pious although very eminent Barrister The large Irish Prayer Book of Bishop Berkeley was after his death presented by his son to the gaol of Oxford  that they may remain idle and ignorant or that  "  they may eat a morsel of bread  See the First Book of Samuel  "  This was effected by that brave excellent officer General Rooke who kindly amiably offered the very old friend of the Editor the sensible pious T Hughes Esquire when a few years ago high sheriff for Glocestershire to rise at four in the morning in March to accompany him on his dreary journey of sixteen miles to attend the execution He felt the unpleasant dreary journey Mr Hughes must have and amiably offered to accompany him His sweet nature was shocked on their arrival at Gloster at seeing the poor wretch quite hardened that he begged Mr Hughes's permission to talk to the poor creature a little to which the pious amiable Mr Hughes who related the happy tale to Dr Berkeley and repeatedly to the Editor repiled  "My permission dear Sir aye and my best prayers for your success"  The execution was delayed and the blessed General to whom the Editor regrets that she has not the honour the happiness to be known succeeded so effectually succeeded that a poor creature who at seven in the morning said  "he had never heard of the  Saviour of Sinners  "  expired at noon believing in him with all his heart asking  "And will HE save such a WRETCH as I have been"    "rejoicing with joy unspeakable and full of glory"  to the great comfort of the Jury as the High Sheriff told Dr Berkeley for he had constantly denied the murder and the man being not robbed they were uneasy at having found him guilty The preceding and succeeding context might be here with propriety inserted they may be sought and the whole chapter redde with advantage by those who have never murdered a man The Editor however feels herself obliged to vindicate herself from the  bare  suspicion of Antinomianism by quoting No XLIV of "The Deep Things of God" Though a child of God glories in this that  "  where sin hath abounded grace doth much more abound  "  yet no child of God can  "sin that grace may abound"  On this one of the selected numbers being redde to Mr Monck Berkeley by his Mother he exclaimed with an earnestness hardly to be described  "God forbid Oh  God forbid"  It was mentioned before that the Editor constantly on quitting her Son's chamber wrote under every number his comments ejaculations c upon it She most carefully selected what she felt suited the  then  state of the soul  Mr Berkeley did not want instruction in his duty to God or his neighbour He did not want to be awakened to be shewn how direfully he had broken the  "Holy Law of God"  nor to be made sensible of the penalty to be inflicted for such breach but to be convinced that Christ had received him which his deep humility prevented him from believing although the  hope  of it was his  sole  support  One night when he supposed himself expiring at Dover Mr Berkeley desired his friend Mrs Frinsham might be called out of bed to him he said  "I beseech you to pray for me You see me going perhaps from misery here to everlasting misery"  adding  "I yet feel some hope that God hears my Mother's prayers and that Christ will not quite cast me off"  It ought to have been mentioned in its proper place that Mr Berkeley wrote to his Mother from Oxford desiring her to summon all her  fortitude  to her aid and prepare her mind not to be shocked at seeing the  shadow  of  what was  once  her Son The original idea was that of Mr Berkeley's going to Gloucester to be constantly under the eye of Dr Chestern He therefore wrote requesting his friends to meet him on the road accordingly the minute the post arrived they accompanied by their incomparable friend Mrs D Monck set out and reached the inn at Burford about five in the afternoon and about seven Mr Berkeley arrived attended by his own servant and a youth of about eighteen the son of an old Irish friend of Dr Berkeley's then staying with Dr Berkeley who had been dispatched to meet Mr Berkeley who had done amiably as he ever did to warn his Mother not to be shocked c It required ALL her fortitude to see her idol with difficulty get out of the chaise and enter the room supported rather  difficultly  supported by his servant a man about his own stature  Mrs Berkeley had gone to town to visit her Son and dear excellent Mr Grimston whose goodness caused his remaining in town all the summer with Mr Berkeley until August when they set off for Hastings Five months of almost unabated torture had wonderfully weakened Mr Berkeley's  "  earthly tabernacle  "  Dr Berkeley's great weakness apologized for his appearing dispirited and Mrs Berkeley forced herself to appear not to feel supreme anguish of mind at the sight of her IDOL thus debilitated  Dr Berkeley rising about ten o'clock said to his Son  "My dear child I am so weak and so wearied that I must wish you a good night I am quite unable to sit up any longer"  Mr Berkeley begging his Father's benediction wished him a good night as he did his excellent friend Mrs Monck On his Mother's going to shake hands with him and retire he said  "Best of Mothers you have not been ill like my poor Father  you can  sit up and I greatly want a little conversation with you"  The above mentioned youth was of course making his bow when Mr Berkeley said  "You need not retire Sir  I rather wish you to stay  "  when Mr Berkeley thus commenced  "I am probably now not far from the end of my course and I wish to say some things to my dear Mother to bless her for having forced me to be regular and constant in my attendance at public worship and at family prayer long before I felt or saw the necessity of it myself I am convinced well convinced that it is the  only  way to train up a child and as my Mother has quoted a thousand times to us taking in his little brother so convinced am I of it that of which there is very little probability now should I live ever to have a family of children or servants I will force them to attend I will drive them before me to the house of God and to family prayers"  The young man stared to hear the energy with which Mr Berkeley uttered this sentence  he turned round and looking stedfastly at him said  "Yes Sir so convinced am I of the wisdom of it that if I could get them no other way I would  kick  them before me driving out his foot with amazing strength it is the  only  way to make them wise unto salvation in their youth"  It is has been before observed that Mr Berkeley said  "I have some little consolation in thinking that if all I ever printed and all I ever wrote lay on the table and a standish by me and I knew that I had but half an hour to live I would not erase one word of it for from a boy I always resolved never to write  "A line which dying I would wish to blot  "In all I have ever published or written I have laboured to render vice odious and ridiculous and to hold up virtue to respect and admiration  Mr Monck Berkeley from a boy had it strongly inculcated on his mind never through life to ridicule those who minister in things sacred even in a false religion his Mother constantly saying to him  "If ever you travel in Turkey or India or amongst the Hottentots always pay respect to the priests of the country however erroneous or absurd their religion may be for without  some  sort of reverence for the Supreme Being man degenerates so lamentably as to become WORSE  than the beasts that perish  "  How strictly Mr Berkeley attended to this admonition may be plainly seen in "The Generous Rustic or Spanish Memories" and above all in his last excellent legendary tale of Heloise in "The Siege of Rhodes" with the last edition of which is joined the "Vicar's Tale" originally published in the Oxford Olla Podrida The village there described is the beautiful village of Witeringham in Northumberland of which the agreeable worthy Mr Twentyman was many years curate Mr Monck Berkeley one day speaking with extacy of the wit contained in Fielding's writings his Mother said  "Hold your tongue If you talk of the wit I will talk of the wickedness of them"    "Oh my Mother they abound with wit and humour"    "Well  my dear Sir  will you be  pleased  to tell me  what  sum would bribe you to have written Joseph Andrews and Tom Jones in each of which the clerical character is held up to supreme contempt in the person of  Parson Adams  and  Thwackham  religion in youth wounded through the odious Blyfieldthe gamekeeper's wife a  Parson's daughter  proclaimed an harlot by her own harlot daughterno opportunity omitted of disgracing the clergy and their poor starving families"  A  mourne silence  ensued but his Mother continuing her harangue he replied  "Why I should not have chosen to have written just those parts"    "No my dear Sir  I know  that the riches of  both  the Indies would not have bribed you to do it THANK GOD therefore"  But alas what is that  How have I fallen God help me and how often have I envived my dog as he lay sleeping by my bedside and said 'Ah thou dear happy brute God will not call THEE into judgement as he will thy  wretched  master"  Mrs Berkeley quoted many gracious promises from Holy Scripture and the promise of promises  "Him that cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out"  but all this was in some degree in vain It was reserved for her excellent  friend Sir Richard Hill by his incomparable book  The Editor conceived that she had before mentioned Mr Berkeley's delight in a little book of Sir Richard Hill's intituled "A Present for your Neighbour" without which he had never travelled for several years before his death always taking it in his trunk but not finding it on carefully reading over the printed sheets she mentions it here Returning early one day from hunting and it happening to rain he entered the house through the servants' hall where this little book lay open in the window The title caught his quick eye The servants all dispersed to their different occupations He took it up and went to his room Some time after he came into the Editor's dressingroom holding a little book in his hand saying  "Pray my dear Madam how came you not to give your Son one of these books as well as your housemaid"  The Editor answered in the same way  "Why my dear Sir because I did not think that my  Son  wanted it"    "You were much mistaken  he  wants it very much and  I desire  you will be pleased to give him one directly"  nodding to that end of the large bookcase where he knew the books for the poor were kept Mrs Berkeley replied  "Indeed I cannot for I gave away the last three days ago"    "Very well my dear Mother I am sure you will get a freight down soon for I am certain you won't be  long  without  such  books as this so I shall keep this in  pawn  till you redeem it I know you are a very honest lady and won't cheat your housemaid"  Mr Berkeley used to divert his Father by saying  "I believe my Mother is the honestest woman living where my Aunt and I are not concerned being in haste to pay every one else if she borrows of us it seems to sit  quite easy  on her  conscience  She certainly thinks it no fin to cheat us of a guinea now and then"  above named to pour the balm of perfect peacethat peace of God which passeth ALL understandinginto the dear humble contrite troubled spirit of her unspeakably dear Sonthat peace for which the generality pray at least once a week but which so very few labour to obtain when obtained they feel that  "the yoke of Christ is easy and his burden light"  It was near two o'clock in the morning before Mr Berkeley apologizing to his Mother told her that he would detain her no longer fearing that the want of a good night's rest might injure her health Mr Berkeley always knew that the loss of sleep is almost death to his Mother whose Mother and Sister could and the dear survivor can pass weeks in health with scarce any sleep at all Mrs Berkeley in that as in other things resembles her FatherWhen young her Mother used to tell the Editor that she thought she  could  not be  her  child because she used to wish to leave a ballroom at four o'clockher Mother telling her often that she used to stay till  eight  then drive home several miles exchange her balldress for her morning one and not go to rest till twelve next night or rather morning for her mother Mrs Cherry never retired to her chamber till twelve and constantly rose winter and summer at six until within two years of her death at sixtyeight when she rose not until seven o'clock It was little likely that Mrs Berkeley should enjoy much sleep after so interesting a conversation of four hours  Mrs Berkeley is said by all those who have known her most intimately from her childhood to be of the most hopeful temper they ever knew she preserves with tenderest care a hair ring given by her dear Son an elegant figure of Hope leaning on her anchor one hand pointing up to  heaven with this motto in hair  "  Heaven's best gift to man  "  It is very certain that until she saw her Son the day after his happy spirit had quitted his fine form she did flatter herself that the mercy of God would spare him to her under the idea of having laboured from her youth to obey oblige delight her own excellent Mother in order to make her feel less poignantly the loss of an almost adoring husband that God would vouchsafe to reward her in KIND and spare her Son But alas her Son was her idol and idols must be given up The Editor was supposed to be idolized by  her  Mother of whom it used to be said  "Mrs Frinsham loves her so much that she never lets her walk across the room without looking at her little insignificant figure with pleasure in her eyes"  That delight must have arisen from thinking she bore some resemblance to her excellent Father The Editor has the pleasure to reflect that there was nothing she would not have sacrificed to please the best of Mothers and that she always prayed to God that he would be pleased to spare her life if it were only for  one week  beyond her Mother's that she might be spared the affliction of seeing her go before her The Editor felt that she was the cause of much sad anxiety to her Mother not having had the small pox as her excellent sister had when a child at Mrs Sheeles's school and its being lamentably fatal in Mrs Frinsham's family her eldest sister being one Saturday esteemed the most beautiful creature in  London  The beaux of that day bestowed the following subriques on the three coheiresses of Mr Cherry all beauties The eldest above mentioned the Duke Cherry fit for a Duke the second the fine Black Cherry from her dark hair her complexion lovely the third Mrs Frinsham the finest figure of the three was termed the Heart Cherry She proved her right to that pleasing subrique by rejecting for the sake of the Editor's father with a small fortune but uncommon worth numbers of brilliant splendid matches Her ideas on that head descended to her daughter and her grandson It is a little remarkable that there was a very strong resemblance in the faces of Dr Berkeley and Mrs Frinsham so as to strike Dr Berkeley himself the first time he saw her pictures Neither of her daughters resembled her in the smallest degree either in her exquisitely fine tall figure which used to occasion her being followed in the Park Mall c where young ladies exhibited in those days and which she retained to the last as well as her fine red and white and the exquisite sweetness of countenance the distinguishing temper of her soul as well as of the Editor's angelic delightful friend the late Mrs Catharine Talbot of Lambeth Palace These two lovely ladies' pictures hung near each other in Dr Berkeley's eatingroom It is probable such kindred spirits are united in the realms of bliss  and the next the most deplorable object mortified all over and much blacker than an Ethiop In the latter part the Editor has no doubt but she had resembled her lovely Aunt had she not been inoculated by Mr Sutton himself who attended her at her own house at Acton with great assiduity Dr Berkeley being then rector of that parish They were sensible of the blessing of such a Preacher Multitudes came every Sunday to Acton church to hear one who according to St Paul did not as he observed to the Editor in his last illness  "preach himself BUT CHRIST JESUS THE LORD"  adding  "HE knows I  preached him in SINCERITY always dreading to be a popular preacher a pleaser of the people"  The following observations are intended solely to benefit some few unfortunate families where the small pox is worse than the plague Mrs Berkeley having not long weaned her second son and duly prepared by Mr Sutton her friends all conceived that inoculation would be to her what by the blessing of God it is to thousands to millions not to herself  she  conceived if she escaped with life that would be all but the sufferings her not having had that frightful disease  had  occasioned to her Mother  did  constantly occasion to an almost adoring Husband and the tenderest of Sisters determined her one way or other to deliver them from their incessant anxiety accordingly she together with Mr Monck Berkeley then between four and five years old were both inoculated on the same day with the same matter The latter had only three pustules and did not lose half an hour's play through indisposition His Mother had but few in her face those on her nose pitted to the bone a vast number on her head a frightful quantity in her throat and several on her arms fingers and feet all shewed their malignity by being confluent and not turning until three and twenty daysa plain proof but for Mr Sutton's method of treating the small pox she had shared the fate of her beautiful aunt Miss Cherry Mr Sutton asserted to Dr Berkeley and others  Mrs Berkeley's friends that he had never before had such a patient He was much alarmed and exceedingly attentive saying  "that had Mrs Berkeley caught the small pox in the natural way she would have mortified in a few days that had Mr Monck Berkeley caught it in the natural way it had probably never have been known that he had had it"  Mrs Berkeley's mother Mrs Frinsham had only ten pustules when a child about eight years old A singular symptom attended Mrs Berkeley's small pox that of her eyes being for more than three days set in their sockets so fixed that she could not move them at all could only see in an absolutely straight direction yet she had not one pustule in her eyes or on her eyelids it was quite internal  Mrs Berkeley had been at first at Sutton House but having always a wonderful partiality for her own home which she conceives would be the case if her home was a neat clean barn begged Mr Sutton's permission to return to her own house with which he very obligingly complied on condition of her going to him when he could not call on her which she punctually did her horses having nothing else to do but drag her then wretched frame to take the air as directed half a dozen times in the day she being unable to walk Mrs Berkeley in her visits to Sutton House used to enquire of the sensible wellbred Reverend Mr Houlton chaplain to Mr Sutton when her eyes would  be better his constant answer was  "Oh dear Madam you will be in heaven to morrow I assure you"  The next day Mrs Berkeley on entering the drawingroom enquired of her fellow patients where Mr Houlton was that she might tell him  "She did not like HIS Mr HOULTON's heaven at all"  The very witty Canon Bowles of Salisbury being one of the patients opened the door and called out  "Houlton come down her is Mrs Berkeley the lady of a Divine that declares she does not even  wish  to go to heavencome down man and talk to the poor lady"  A lady whose name is not at present remembered by the Editor came down one morning looking much distressed saying  "I am very ill indeed"  She sent for the sensible clever  consoling  housekeeper and exhibited her chest covered over with a most tremendous erysipelas The housekeeper said  "Do not fear Madam if it please God you will get safe through"  the lady turning to Mrs Berkeley said  "  If I do  I shall be the  first  of my family that ever did"  It did please Providence to bring her safely through and spare her to a most anxious husband who visited her with trembling tenderness perpetually  Mrs Berkeley suffered much from the kind persecutions of Dr Berkeley and her Sister to suffer Sir William Duncan  and Dr Addington  Dr Addington used frequently to tell the Editor that the first fee he ever received was at the house of Mr Frinsham A gentleman on a visit there was taken suddenly ill Dr Hayes was his physician but Dr Addington happenned to dine at White Waltham he prescribed and as he said got his handsel in Berks He got a better treasure in Berks than gold than rubies the best and most sensible of wives one of what the Editor always styles HOUSE BUILDERS See the Proverbs of Solomon chap xxxi Not  Castle  but  House  Builders are real treasures to sons and daughters This MD narrowly escaped one of the weakest and obtained one of the wisest of women  to be sent for which Mrs Berkeley resolutely opposed fearing it might injure the cause of inoculation the greatest blessing surely that ever was granted to the terrestrial part of man Mrs Berkeley resolved to live or die as it should please the allwise Disposer of all events by Mr Sutton alone Being at that time a little in the world and a little known she conceived that calling in regular medical aid would easily be turned into  "Mrs George Berkeley would  certainly  have  died by Sutton's method  if so and so had not saved her life"  Mr Sutton felt himself so obliged by her conduct that he at different times inoculated poor people  gratis  whom she recommended to him obligingly telling her  "One line from her at any time sent by a poor person should be sufficient introduction to his care and his kitchen"  It is the fashion with persons of a certain description to disbelieve what they cannot comprehend and to laugh at what they do not understand and many persons explode  the idea of the small pox generally proving fatal in some families  Several years after one night at a large rout at Canterbury there was universal lamentation over a family who had lost a darling child by inoculation in the common way Mrs Berkeley naturally said  "Alas poor people why did they not let Sutton attend it  He is the man  where it proves so fatal in families"  A Canterbury physician not remarkable for his worth now no more meaning to turn Mrs Berkeley to ridicule said  "And so Madam you believe the doctrine of the small pox proving more fatal in some families than in others"  and proceeded to harangue at a wonderful rate against the absurdity of that doctrine when amongst other ladies and gentlemen approached the elegant Mrs P  t saying  "Surely Dr  Mrs Berkeley is right at least she thinks exactly as Baron Dimsdale does for when he inoculated my daughter he expressed his astonishment that a little creature so healthy with so fine a complexion should have it so much more severely than was the case with inoculation in his method with one in five hundred"  Mrs P  t told him  "She could assign no reason for it unless it could be admitted as one that her father the worthy Dr D  Prebendary of Canterbury died of it a desperate sort"  To which she said the Baron replied  "You have fully accounted  for it Madam In the few patients I have had who have suffered much with it I have always found that some of their families on one side have for generations died of it"  The Editor knows one family where for above two centuries not one attacked by that tremendous disease ever did recover until the introduction of inoculation and in such unhappy families their children should be carefully kept out of the reach of infection until old enough to take remedies to prevent being choaked as it usually attacks the throat and infants cannot take remedies to ward off that frightful attack as was the case with the Editor her throat being  quite lined  with pustules  We have an high authority for knowing  "He that watereth shall himself also be watered again"  Mr Berkeley experienced it at least in one very pleasing instance his introduction to his noble highlyhonoured respected friends their Graces the Duke and Duchess of Marlborough  Had Mr Berkeley been living how sincerely how tenderly would he have sympathized with that illustrious pair on their late loss The Editor rejoices that their Graces have still two sons although she had none a very amiable young nobleman and a very fine youth who by having his late learned accomplished brother held up as a pattern may be stimulated to resemble him Before Mr Monck Berkeley considered his health as irrecoverable He one day said to the Editor  "If God spares my life until next summer I mean to step abroad and visit my friend Lord Henry Spencer"  The Editor does not recollect where his Lordship then was Mrs Berkeley's constant advice to her Son was whilst persons of high rank or station treat you as a gentleman a man of family although  untitled  always remember that they are  your  superiors but the instant they forget have nothing more to do with them Mr Monck Berkeley never would visit or meet notwithstanding all her Ladyship's  submissions  a poor silly Peeress his near relation who having a  very  short memory had  quite  forgot her kinsman until she learned in town that it was  ton  to be acquainted with Mr Monck Berkeley So much for the present of her Ladyship's WISDOM When the Marquis of Blandford went to Eton the then Dean of Canterbury who went down with him desired Mr Monck Berkeley about two or three years older to take his Lordship under his protection  ie  as the Editor conceives to see that they are not  too  much buffeted by their own or an higher form a certain  quantum  is excellent forthe Editor had almost said Kings however  certainly  for  "Lords and Commons"  Dr Berkeley having known this and his Son's telling him that the Marquis of Blandford was at Christ Church on Mr Monck Berkeley's first return from Oxford to the Oaks said  "I suppose Lord Blandford had quite forgot you it is so long since you left Eton near seven years  Mr Berkeley replied  "Indeed my dear Sir you are mistaken being engaged to dine one day at the noblemen's table at Christ Church and seeing Lord Blandford come into the hall I determined to wait thinking he might  really  might have forgotten me but the instant his eye caught me he sprang forward and took me by the hand saying 'My dear Berkeley how do you do I am happy to see you"  This young nobleman has as Mr Berkeley always said he had a very amiable heart Every one at the time near thirty years ago heard the rencontre of the then very sensible polite agreeable  Master in Chancery  Master P  s with Lord B  after his return from his travels and his congratulating his Lordship on being a man as he was a boy of sense at Eton  for which he was solely indebted to his very  old friend the Reverend Dr King now Chancellor of Lincoln Mr Berkeley happened to be at his father's when Dr King was appointed to Dr Tanner's vacant stall in the church of Canterbury Immediately on hearing it he with his wonted sweetness when asking a favour of either of his parents said to his Father  "My dear Sir I should take it as a very great favour if you would have the goodness to invite Dr King to be your guest when he comes down hither to be installed as I believe although a most excellent scholar he is entirely ignorant of all matters of this kind and you are  au fait  in them He was exceedingly kind and good to me when I was at Eton and when we used to go over together to Lord Inchiquin's" that elegant nobleman one of the friends of Dr Berkeley's very early youth at Cloyne most amiably kind to Mr Berkeley when at Eton "and to Sir Adam Gordon's" a very old friend equally kind "and it would delight me to have it in my power to shew my gratitude to him"  Dr Berkeley desired his Son to write immediately to Dr King and say  "that although he Mr Berkeley must probably be absent Dr Berkeley requested the favour of his company"  Accordingly at the proper time Dr King arrived at Dr Berkeley's house in the Oaks accompanied by his sensible brother John King  The present worthy highbailiff of Westminster  Esquire Dr King expressed his sense of the little attentions it was in Mrs Berkeley's power to shew him more highly than they merited She requested him if it was in his power to do her Son the honour to introduce him at Blenheim Mrs Berkeley having ever from a young woman before  she married declared if ever she had a son she would try to introduce him to that noble family in preference to  any  other in England His Grace's father the late Duke was very uncommonly amiable and had much worth  The Editor cannot avoid dropping a tear over the too early grave of a most amiable young gentleman who accompanied Dr King in his second visit to Dr Berkeley's his brotherinlaw  Manby Esquire secretary to the Duke of Leeds Any attempt to do justice to the amiable mild gentle elegant merits of this young gentleman would require an inspired pen instead of one dulled blunted by age and affliction Probably all who knew him would be ready with the Editor to take up the language of Shakspeare and say  "I ne'er shall look upon his like again"  Good Dr King more learned than attentive had brought Mr Manby down with him to the Summer audit and knowing that Dr Berkeley's house was not very large had deposited him at one of the wretched inns at Canterbury After being at the Oaks two days one morning at breakfast the good little Doctor said  "He must go before he went into the audit room and see after  his  young man"  Mrs Berkeley knowing that the Doctor had no son enquired  "What young man"  Dr King  "  Why why  he is Mrs King's brother I brought him down to  see  Canterbury"  Mrs Berkeley  "Where is he"  Dr K  "Why at one of your inns down in the city"  Mrs B  "Who is with him"  Dr K  "Why nobody that is the thing"  Mrs B  "How old is he A man grown up or a youth Surely it is not  At Eton at the same time with Mr Monck Berkeley now Deputy High Bailiff of Westminstera very polite young gentleman as polite as an Irishmanfor he is amiably attentive to  aged matrons  and  dowagers  to prevent their breaking their bones when in dangerous situations  Prob The Editor some years ago at Dover  dear Dick after whom I heard my Son enquire of you so kindly and charge you so strictly to give his affectionate regards"  Dr K  "No no he is older than Dick it is his eldest brother"  Mrs B  "Well who shews him the  lions  of Canterbury"  Dr K  "Why poor fellow nobody  that  is the  thing  "  Mrs B  "  The  THING  indeed  "  It will by this time be easily perceived by those who have the pleasure of knowing  intimately  the learned Doctor  that Mrs Berkeley had taken upon herself the government of this  little  great man Mrs Berkeley always asserting that although we are forbidden by the Apostle to govern our  own  husbands  that  prohibition  does not  extend to our neighbour and Mrs Berkeley is by her friends esteemed a pretty good hand in that often  very necessary  The Editor sometimes reflects with pleasure that through her instrumentality  more  than  one  couple of her married friends have acknowledged that by her advice always delivered in the humblest the most secret manner they live in good harmony before unknown When any of the Editor's friends marry she always writes them a letter of advice mixed with congratulations if she has leisure it is a full sheet A gentleman some time ago wrote her word that he carefully preserved her letter and frequently redde it over and meant to do so as long as he lived He has been very happily married  business But to quit this  folaterie  which the Editor brought into the world with her and which  maugre  all her afflictions her present exceedingly indifferent health seldom well a whole hour together in a week she seems to feel will never quit her like the excellent Sir Thomas More's wit and good old Lady Banister's humour who dying at an hundred and nobody knows how many more years old told all her great grandchildren  "not to stand crying over her for that they could not think that she was dying an  untimely  death in the  prime  of life"  The dear lively Bishop of Norwich one day at dinner at Dr Berkeley's said  "My dear Madam how came you  to let my brother King go to church this morning without a band"    "Oh my dear Mr Dean if you did but know the  trouble  it costs  me  every day to prevent his keeping your Eminences a title bestowed by Mrs Berkeley many years before on the Dean and Prebendaries waiting dinner for him you would pity me all  my  eloquence  cannot  inspire  him  with  due  veneration for the collected bodythe CONCLAVE"  Mrs Berkeley feeling the unpleasantness of Mr Manby's situation besought Dr King to bring him to Dr Berkeley's Mrs Berkeley her Son being in London sent immediately to a very amiable worthy young man who felt great gratitude for some very  essential  services rendered him by Mrs Berkeley repaying his attentions when a boy to her little boys much younger at the King's School the worthy Mr William Jackson son of the Collector of Excise and afterwards an Alderman of Canterbury This grateful wellinformed young man died after a very few days illness universally lamented as he was universally beloved and respected His wonderfully lowlived parents gave rings of his hair set with diamonds to many of the ladies of Canterbury who would not have known that he existed as himself used to say but for Mrs Berkeley's gratitude which when he at nineteen quitted the King's School led her to invite him to play at cards at the round table with the younger ladies and gentlemen at her routs Mrs Berkeley  introduced him to her learned friend the Reverend John Duncombe and his Lady and requested them when she left Canterbury in to take to him His mind received much cultivation from that learned worthy wellinformed pair To Mrs Berkeley the old woman sent into  Berkshire  Mrs Berkeley being there at the time of his death a piece of catgut worked with her son's hair saying  "that Mrs Berkeley did not  want  diamonds"  Poor young man he often when living felt her low absurdities when she  insisted  on exhibiting to her son's company He repeatedly said to numbers of people  "But for Mrs Berkeley's goodness and I had been in such a set"  naming several aldermen's sons c some now violent Democrats who were kept in their own line of company whilst Jackson was in the first company in the church and county His father at his death left legacies to all his son's friends excepting to Mrs Duncombe and to Mrs Berkeley to neither of whom an hundred guineas for a ring would have been unacceptable But the new Legacy Bill will never affect Mrs Berkeley for as Mrs Frinsham says when any of her rich relations die childless  "Sister to be sure they forget that you and I exist or that we know how to  spend  a little money for none of them ever name us even for a ten guinea ring"  But quitting this subject for a much pleasanter Jackson immediately presented himself in Mrs Berkeley's dressingroom  when she introduced him to Mr Manby requesting him to become his guide to conduct him to every thing worthy notice in the church or city to repair to the Oaks every morning at breakfast and every day at three to take their dinner with Mrs Berkeley and spend the afternoon the Prebendaries dining together at each other's houses during the audit the tables generally being full and taking their tea in the auditroom  On the day when they dined at Dr Berkeley's on Mrs Berkeley's entering the eatingroom the dinner served the Bishop of Norwich then Dean going up to her presented her with a pamphlet saying  "Madam entirely in obedience to your commands there is the sermon that I preached on Trinity Sunday If it produces any good it is entirely owing to you for it has been often preached and never was intended for the press but you insisted upon its being published and I have obeyed your orders"  Many of the Prebendaries said the public were very much indebted to Mrs Berkeley The Bishop when sitting at dinner said  "I must request you my dear Madam to give me a list of your friends whom you wish should read it that I may send it to my bookseller"  Mrs Berkeley felt as it merited this very polite attention from her most excellent old friend and said  "She would request a few to send to some of her friends in Scotland that her English friends could provide  themselves"  then said  "  I must pull this incomparable discourse all to pieces  and get some of my pocket MP's" so Mrs Berkeley always styled two amiable Baronets who used at all times to convey her simple chitchat to her friends  adding  "I do wish to convey one  entire  to dear Lord Leven What method can I take my dear Mr Dean Can you advise me"  Sweet Mr Manby with pleasure in his eyes replied  "My dear Madam  I  can render you that little service and shall be most unfeignedly happy to do it You know we can send any thing from the Secretary of State's Office"  When the audit was ended and the good little Doctor  The next time Mrs Berkeley saw her Son after his good friend Dr King's visit at the Oaks he enquired  "how she liked his old friend"  She replied as all  will  reply who know him intimately at the same time asking Mr Monck Berkeley  "What is Mrs King like"    "Like my dear Madam why like a QUEEN YOU never saw such a woman I promise you in  your  whole life"  Those who have seen Mrs King will be apt to think that Mr Berkeley had improved in his knowledge of beauty since his dear friend Miss M  used to style a very plain woman one of Berkeley's beauties Mr Berkeley was  then  only seventeen and ever such an admirer of a superior understanding that provided he heard wisdom he regarded not the mouth  and his brother going to quit Canterbury this most amiable of young gentlemen thus addressed Mrs Berkeley  "My dear Madam what can I do what can I say to you for your throughly polite attentions for your wonderful goodness to me I am utterly unable to express  in  any  degree the sense I must ever retain of it If at  any  time in  any  way I can render you  any  service you will delight my spirit by only pointing it out to me"  Mrs Berkeley conjured him not to distress her by saying a syllable more to her for having  only  done just what every other person not a savage had they known his situation  would  have done  The Editor cannot here forbear relating a little anecdote of her Son's lovely amiability of which she was only very lately informed he never having mentioned it A lady who was a stranger visiting at Mrs Berkeley's happened to sit opposite the fine portrait of Mr Berkeley painted by his amiable accomplished friend Mr Peters she in a low voice said to the lady who sat next to her  "I never saw so like a picture in my life"  Mrs Berkeley although she cannot see yet hears remarkably quick thanks to God's blessing on the skill of Mr Maull in Piccadilly exerted about twenty years ago said  "I did not know Madam that my Son had the honour to be known to you"  To which the good old lady very politely replied  "Madam  I  had the honour to be known to Mr Berkeley One year returning from Margate we wished to see the cathedral of Canterbury we walked up and could not see any one to tell us where to find the person who showed it We saw a great many gentlemen walking backwards and forwards by the side of the church After some time one  of them detaching himself from the rest came up to us and in the politest manner said 'Ladies are you in any distress in which I can assist you The ladies told their wish to see the cathedral and their utter inability to find out how to do it Mr Berkeley said 'If you will have the goodness to wait two minutes I will get the verger to attend you' He stepped into a shop sent off a lad for the verger and again joined the ladies On the arrival of the verger Mr Berkeley escorted them into the church pointed out to them some particular beauties of that glorious temple of God charged the verger not to omit shewing them some things as he named then saying 'he had an engagement' made an elegant bow wished them a pleasant journey and took his leave"  The ladies enquired of the verger who that young gentleman was to whose politeness they were so much indebted He replied  "that it was Mr Berkeley son to one of the Prebends"  The ladies expressing gratitude the verger said  "Yes Madam every body loves Mr Berkeley exceedingly he is so kind and condescending to every one"  Dr and Mrs Berkeley both had been for some time wishing to obtain for their worthy old servant Mr Wrightson when he should marry and quit service the place of one of his Majesty's messengers he having repeatedly flown with incredible velocity over this kingdom and to and from Ireland on Dr Berkeley's business and probably  had it not pleased the ALLWISE Director of ALL things  small  as well as  great  to remove to the society he so strongly resembled on earth the angelic Mr Manby the poor of Canterbury had not been blessed with quite so excellent so judicious and so kind a governor as successor to their former very worthy master Mr Nott It is surely a delight to every feeling heart to see the aged poor made happy the young instructed and brought up industriously the way to be happy here and hereafter  The Editor is much addicted wherever she resides or stays any little time at a place to visit the  workhouses  feeling tender pity for those who have not a penny to buy tobacco snuff or a little  two  shilling tea and  sweetened sand  called sugar to season it Her feelings suffered much whilst at Oxford as she really conceives from what she  herself  saw The relation of two of her old servants whom she frequently sent thither that most wellregulated Bridewells are Paradises compared to the Oxford Workhouse in short nothing out of the infernal regions can be worse or worse conducted Mrs Berkeley's maid sent thither one day to see after a poor sick woman was obliged to take shelter in a room some poor creature opened to her an audacious harlot flying through the house with a great knife to murder the then poor stupid ignorant mistress They have no poundage from earnings  once  in the year at the  Races  they have some twopence some sixpence  given them as one of the guardians told Mrs  to  figure away  with on the Course  Mrs Berkeley one day on going out gave a poor woman who had called the mistress to her and shewn her the  uncultivated  wretched garden a shilling The poor woman's gratitude and extacies were sorely distressing adding  "I have not seen a shilling before for two years"  This poor creature had lived comfortably in London her husband a mason killed by the breaking of a scaffold when alas she was wretched enough to belong to some parish in Oxford Mrs Berkeley enquired whom among the guardians were tenderly disposed towards the poor and was told Mr Slatter the baker and Mr Ayton the grocer Mr Slatter serving Dr Berkeley's family with bread she instantly set off to call on him and never recollects to have seen a more sensible wellbehaved humane person in humble station he would make a better figure in an higher than many who have scrambled up to it He assured her that unable to combat with the  majority  of the guardians in defence of the poor he had in despair relinquished it entirely  She then went to Mr Ayton and received a similar answer She exhorted both but she fears in vain However unpleasant it might be to continue to fight the battles of the poor she assured them there would come a time  when they would rejoice that they had done it Their answer was that the lowest and most mercenary of the tradesmen were appointed guardians and there was no opposing them How different from Canterbury two most respectable tradesmen out of each of the sixteen parishes are annually chosen sometimes she conceives rechosen as when she wished to get a poor creature going in comfortably deposited she constantly went to Dr Berkeley's baker the very worthy sensible wellbred Mr Johnson educated at the university of Cambridge On the death of his father he most dutifully and affectionately went home to assist his worthy mother in carrying on her business Mr Johnson if not in office himself constantly took care to apply to some worthy man who was The Editor is no Democrat feels horrors at the vile idea of Equalitybut such direful  inequality  as a rich  bonvivant  Oxford tradesmanand the poor almost poisoned poor creatures in that vile workhouse must hurt every heart who has ever redde in the Bible  "Who maketh thee to differ from another"  c  The Editor after delivering her sentiments very freely on one class of people in Oxford cannot quit the place without taking notice of a very different class whom she once had it in contemplation to address in the Oxford Mercury as she did not feel happy to quit Oxford without offering her very grateful acknowledgements to themthe  young gentlemen of the University It is a general an almost universal complaint amongst the Fair Sex The Editor begs pardon for a misnomer she ought to have written the RED SEX for almost all now resemble  Rouge Dragon  in Heraldry to be sure the present dress makes them resembles Heraldic animals and Swift's yahoos The Editor famous amongst her friends for never wearing any cap or hat that did not become her sort of face nor any colour that did not become her complexion and was perpetually consulted on that subject by her friends cannot help thinking that the Father of Mischief has been the inventor of the present mode of dressing particularly the vile scooped out hats or rather straw caps she therefore styles them  Diabolls  It is no wonder that husbands go astray from wives so odiously disfigured  That all polite attentions from gentlemen to ladies is at an end is a charge perhaps too well founded An excellent exaltedly pious friend of the Editor's but lately gone to glory the lady of the late very worthy amiable Thomas Baber Esquire of Sunninghill Park and who had the happiness to be the mother of Edward Baber Esquire well known to all in the East for his  inflexible  honesty He had the happiness of throughly pious as well as accomplished parents This lady once a most celebrated beauty used to say  "The young men of this day are quite Hottentots all I expect of them is that if I happen to fall down  they will be so good as to kick me aside and not walk over me"  The Editor fears the charge may be too true but she feels it a duty incumbent on her to say  "that if politeness to females is banished from every other place it has taken up its residence amongst the  young  gentlemen of the university of Oxford  true  politeness extending ever to  aged  females"  The Editor as has been mentioned before has at sixty every accomplishment that some are without at eighty frequently if walking alone stepping into a  grey  puddle mistaking it for a nice clean broad stone The polite attentions from young gentlemen in assisting her to cross the street sometimes accompanying her half a street's length to direct her to a shop opening the door for her always giving her the wall not driving her off the pavement as two officers did a few years ago at Newcastle she leaning on her husband's armhe being dressed in a short cassock they supposed him a bishop as they said  en passant  and knew  worthy wights  he could not  challenge  them but he severely reproved their  brutality  The Editor happened to hear that the wife of one of them  amply  revenged her quarrel He almost deserved it  The Editor certainly owes her life to the polite humanity of one gentleman whose name although she took much pains to learn it she never could find out until the evening  before she quitted Magdalene Lodge at the close of November or every grateful respectful attention would have been rendered to the Reverend Mr Williams Subwarden of Wadham College  A Lady of fashion well known in the polite circles now of an age as well as the Editor to dress for  comfort  not for shew having an house in the neigbourhood of Oxford often walking in the street with the Editor said  "Your remark is very just that the young men here are  certainly very wellbred  if they were not they would laugh at usfor to be sure you with your black beaver gypsey hat tied down and hiding half your little politeness prevented her adding withered face and your rusty black cloak and  I  in my  old  hat and  old  great coat are two curious enough figures"  The Editor's excellent relation and herself are both oldfashioned in making it a point to pay their butcher and baker every Monday morning And the Editor used always to tell Dr Berkeley and her Son when she got a lecture for walking out in a morning without a servant that she did not like a footman attending her when she did not appear as if she could pay him his wages  The Editor never met with any impertinence but twice during her  sejour  in OxfordOne day walking by Baliol College a poor creature in  she supposes  a servitor's gown  expressing his dislike of her hat and after she was passed said  "  he would give a crown to know who she was  "  the Editor languished to have turned on her heel and have said  "Young man save your crown to buy Trusler's edition of 'Lord Chesterfield's Advice to the amiable Phil Stanhope'I will tell you without reward that I am the wife of Dr Berkeley Prebendary of Canterbury"  but having with her a lady who always returns pertness by  silent disdain  which affects not fools it may wise persons the Editor's  generosity  in gratifying the poor lowlived creatures curiosity  gratis  would have hurt her dignity The other was one very hot evening the Editor had taken in her hand a  parasol  a shower coming on she held it over her head to protect a very good hat Not far from Christchurch she met a number of gentlemen pushing home from the shower who all passed her with their usual politeness stepping off the very narrow pavement to avoid incommoding her the rear was brought up by a  little  insignificant looking animal in a gown who in a voice resembling any thing but that of a young man squeaked out  "Look look here is a lady holding a  parasol  over her in this violent showerwhat a fool she must be"  The Editor heard two or three of the gentlemen say  "Not at allit did not rain she supposes they added when she set out"  The name of this wise  little miss  in a black gown is concealed in pity to his  poor  parentsit is enough to be  burthened  with  such  a poor little  creature without seeing him held up to public contempt  A very worthy friend of the Editor's whom she has not had the  delight  of seeing for many years Mrs M Jeffries of Richmond used formerly to say  "One has  no pleasure  in hearing scandal from Mrs George Berkeley for the little d  l will never tell one the name until all the town rings with it"  The exquisitely kind attentions of this wonderfully agreeable worthy lady to the Editor's angelic friend the late Mrs Catharine Talbot when her excellent friend the Marchioness de Grey lent her house at Richmond to Mrs Talbot during her lingering illness must ever endear her to the Editor although it is little likely she should every see her again until they meet in the region of spirits as both are much attached to their own abode  Quiting these two curious beings the Servitor and squeaking Miss to thank themselves for these animadversions the Editor returns her best thanks to all and every sensible polite young gentleman of the University They resemble in some respects holy Job who says  "  Eyes was I to the blind feet was I to the lame  "  c The Editor sincerely hopes that they may never be afflicted as he was and that those of her polite assisters who choose to marry may meet with wiser and more pious wives than  at first  fell to the lot of certainly a  favourite  of the ALMIGHTY's HE naming him one of the three with Noah and Daniel who should deliver their own souls This is mentioned to shew to those who believe the inspiration of Scripture the folly of supposing the history of Job a  pious fable  and that holy man an  ideal  person See poor Dr Durell's simple book and in all other respects the accomplished Mrs Chapone's wise one on this subject  Since writing the above the Editor has had the distress to hear of the almost sudden death of a throughly amiable man who accidentally meeting her at tea at a neighbouring gentleman's house and learning not from the Editor who is not addicted to entertain her friends or visitors with lamentations that she had much intricate  It is impossible for her to omit offering her public acknowledgements to Mr Wilberforce  The  Mr Wilberforce the friend of all the distressed whether their complexions are black or white perhaps in this instance might with more propriety be said  brown  Having found it is impracticable to assist her in getting the Lords of the Treasury to remit the very heavy duty on the foreign books of Bishop Berkeley's library removed from Ireland for sale in England most generously wrote her a very polite letter offering to lend her the money He had never seen or perhaps heard of her until applied to to use his interest with Mr Pitt It was most gratefully accepted and will be most thankfully repaid The Editor wishes she could get her income from Ireland as easily as her Books which alas have been so ill kept that they have not defrayed the expence of carriage and duty But that many of them being wanted to complete sets in England it had been wiser to have permitted the Irish worms to have finished them in their native country the Customhouse Officers would not seize that A widow in one kingdom and her jointure in another is rather unpleasant is sometimes sorely distressing  unpleasant business to struggle through visited her the next day saying  "he  was going to town in a few days and if it was possible for him to render her any service in any way he should esteem himself very happy if she would as he politely said honour him with her commands"  The Editor accepted most gratefully his kind offer and took leave to employ him in a very fatiguing matter in which his amiability led him to be indefatigable That it is not yet accomplished nor probably ever will was not to be attributed to want of every exertion of the amiable Dr Sergrove master of Pembroke College This produced a degree of intimacy Mrs Berkeley ever wishing with little ability to benefit all her friends children took the liberty to recommend to his attention and protection a very sensible fine youth of his College a son of the very worthy Mr Andrews surgeon at Stanmore in Middlesex one of fourteen olivebranches to whom this throughly amiable hearted benevolent man was exceedingly attentive and kind and told the Editor  "that it had pleased him and he dared say would please her that young Andrews had on Dr Johnson's rooms becoming vacant earnestly solicited to have them assigned to him"  Young Andrews and his whole family have as strong understandings as Dr Johnson They are famed for it May he make as good use of it as did his predecessor in the rooms This agreable friend visited at Magdalene Lodge three days before he went to townto return alas no morerequesting Mrs Berkeley and Mrs Frinsham earnestly to honour  him as he politely termed it by drinking tea and spending the evening at the Master's lodgings saying he would invite some ladies whom he named the rector of Lincoln and some other sensible agreable friends to meet them The very tender state of Mrs Berkeley's health forced her to decline it which she now regrets He promised to visit Datchet alas may his obliged friend meet him in a  still  pleasanter place  Mrs Berkeley on her revisiting Oxford for a few days offered for the Reverend Mr Williams's acceptance and which she hopes he received one of the copies on royal paper gilt c so decorated for some Lords Spiritual and Temporal of Dr Berkeley's famous  long smothered  sermon preached at Lambeth Palace Chapel at the consecration of his beloved old friend Bishop Horne which she solemnly promised Dr Berkeley on his death bed at his  earnest  injunction should be published  The Editor as perhaps she may have before mentioned never had any  very great  dread of the disapprobation of sinful mortals like herself and as she one day said to her beloved partner  "the removal of her dear Son had annihilated that little fear"  If she can approve her conduct to what Dr Young with his wonted energy terms  "the God within us and to God in heaven"  she little regards the censures of any Prelates or Potentates on earth  This  non chalance  of the opinion of what is called the WORLD she by no means recommends to young persons of either sex or to mothers who have daughters that they wish to marry off  tout au contraire  she dehorts them from it A proper respect for the  then  WORLD she is persuaded did in the last century prevent some of our greatgrandmothers being exhibited at Doctors Commons and before the House of Peers To be sure  they  had also a  little  fear of a  great  PERSONAGE that our modern belles and beaux many of them never even heard of from their wise prudent parents  The late excellent Lady  once said to the Editor  "My father and mother were what the world called  mighty good sort of people  and yet I do declare neither of them ever mentioned any thing of religion to me nor ever even told me that I had a soul to be saved"  Upon the Editor's saying  "they must have done it but you have forgotten it"  she reddened with anger and answered  "No no  you  are the only human being that ever talked to me on the subject of religion"  Her father lived till she was twentythree her mother until she had a grandchild of this daughter marriageable The minister of her father's parish was what the world termed a  very good  clergyman probably he had not  studied  he must have  redde  as it is a Sunday lesson the thirtythird chapter of the prophet Ezekiel  The once gay as vicious is too frequently termed Lord Holland in his account of himself written a little before his execution praises the wonderful mercy of God in the following words  "Oh the astonishingly gracious mercy of God that  I  should owe my salvation to a child  The incomparable angelically pious lovely Countess of Suffolk This heavenly creature was in mercy to her wretched Father's soul snatched from the brink of the grave just before his afflictions commenced She attended him in prison every day and the night preceding his execution sat up in an outer room and entered with his gentleman in the morning She was certainly spared from death temporal on purpose to rescue her father from death eternal She went a very few months after to join her penitent parent in the realms of bliss  of my OWN  I  who have so sadly neglected the instruction of my children and servants in piety and the knowledge of God I always did take care to have a  good  chaplain in the house to read prayers daily and instruct my children and my servants in religion BUT I OUGHT also to have done it myself as ehildren attend much more to what comes from a parent than from others not so interested for them"  c c  The Editor some years ago returning from Scotland to Canterbury amused herself with visiting every nobleman's house  in  her road or that did not take her  too far  out of her road to view the fine pictures c She saw a chapel at every one and constantly said to the attending servant  "I suppose that you have prayers here every day"    "No Madam never"  Here must be excepted the chapel at  Alnwick Castle The question asked was answered by the sensible obliging Mrs Carr the housekeeper  "O yes Madam every day excepting Sundays when his Grace the late Duke of Northumberland always goes attended by all the family to the parish church"  His Grace's children and servants will not rise in judgement against  him  at the LAST GREAT DAY when every PEER as well as every PEDLAR must meet every  Servant  they have ever had under their roof May they do it with joy and not with grief  The reason assigned by God for his regard of an holy Patriarch was  "For I know Abraham that he will  command  not civilly desire his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the LORD"  c The LORD printed in capitals always implies    "It is great pity as sweet Dr Watts observes that our translators have not  always  translated it as in some few places Jehovah"  It would have prevented the writing of many volumes and much cavilling Let them  divert  themselves with cavilling as long as they  can  there are no Socinians or Arians in HELL Let the honest ones among them read Mr Hawtry and the astonishingly curious treatise of the late very learned Reverend Meredith Jones chaplain to the present father of the Bench the Reverend Sir William Ashburnham Lord Bishop of Chichester whose exquisitely polite amiable attentions to the late Dr Berkeley were  were ever so gratefully felt by him that he constantly brought his Lordship's letters to the Editor to preserve carefully  After an absence of some months from England on his return Mrs Berkeley said to her Son  "Oh my dear Berkeley  I can  introduce  you  to the most delightful of women"  Mr B  "Pray my dear Madam do it then for you know how much I admire a woman of superior understanding and I am sure if she was not such although you never despise those who have not  you  would not style her  delightful  "  Mrs B  "She has indeed and it is  so  cultivated and  so wonderfully  well informed by much travelling so  highly  polished and withal '  bears her faculties so meekly  ' as your idol Shakspeare speaks that you will be in raptures with her"  Mr B  "Well my dear Mother who is she"  Dr B  "Why she is a  Jewess  You know I often tell your Mother that  she  has friends amongst '  Jews Turks Infidels and Heretics  '  See one of the Good Friday Collectsalluding to Mrs Berkeley's having one beloved friend alas who believes not in God some Roman Catholic  and some Presbyterian friends  "She has  really  now a  Jew  friend and a most pleasing woman she is"  Mr B  "Well but her name my dear Sir Who knows but I may make up to her convert her to Christianity and marry her for to be sure she is  rich  being a  Jewess  "  Mrs B  "Marry her why although the Levitical Law allows of polygamy much as you and I have both studied it I do not find that it allows the ladies to have a plurality of husbands That is only allowed to one cast in the East Indies where the woman is allowed  four  who all like  wise  men vie with each other who shall be most assiduous most agreeable present her the best gifts whilst we European women that is some  few old fashioned  creatures are studying perpetually how to please our husbands as that  horrid  old fashioned writer St Paul directs 'The woman that is married careth for the things of the world how she may  please her husband  "  The wonderfully witty sister of the Editor often says  "Aye aye it  might be so  in St Paul's time but their care  now  seems to be to please every man  but  their  husband  and he poor soul is left to please himself as well as he can Well well there  must  be a  reckoning  for it  some time hence  poor silly creatures"  Mrs Berkeley told her Son that if he was  ambitious  of uniting himself with a descendant of the Father of the Faithful the FRIEND OF GODdelightful title which all should strive to meritall who do strive in earnest may attainhe must look out for himself for that her lovely friend had been many years the happy wife of the sensible learned highly accomplished throughly polite Raphael Brandon Esquire  Mr Brandon writes English as correctly and very much more elegantly than many eminent English scholars The Editor has letters of this gentleman's carefully preserved that prove the truth of this assertion she expressing some surprize at it was told by Mr Brandon that on his coming from Portugal to England at about seventeen the master appointed to teach himself and brother English recommended it to them to study diligently Bishop Lowth's English Grammar which he has done to excellent effect The Editor advises all youths sons of her friends who are going into navy army or the East unable to enjoy that  great solid  blessing of an  English  university education to purchase and study it Many have followed the advice and blessed her for it It distresses one to hear a brave Admiral or valiant General speaking as incorrectly as an Abigail  The writing the word  Jew  brings to the Editor's recollection and she  cannot  deny herself the  pleasure of writing  and she hopes some few feeling hearts the  pleasure of reading  a little anecdote of Mr Monck Berkeley and some Canterbury Jews About the year the shop of a very respectable woollendraper and mastertailor was broke open and robbed of goods and money to a large amount Every one was at a loss to guess who had done the deed excepting the worthy sufferer A gentleman of large fortune of strict integrity on whom the Editor bestowed the title of RHADAMANTHUS as apt to say unpleasant things as his sweetly amiable son is to utter pleasing ones thought proper to say  "Mr  the name not recollected by the Editor  had robbed himself  "  This naturally rouzed the honest man who said  "he  must now  find out the burglarian at any rate"  He immediately procured a warrant to apprehend his journeyman who had served a seven years' apprenticeship to him and behaved himself in the most exemplary manner He immediately accused his accomplice a journeyman hairdresser They were both examined by the Mayor and committed to prison Mr Berkeley coming home the Editor at dinner asked him  "if he knew this young Jew who had committed the robbery"  to which he replied  "Poor creature he had never committed this nor probably any other robbery if he had not been drawn in by a vile rascal of a Christian as he is by courtesy styled a villain It was  moving to hear how excellent a character his worthy master gave of him until he said within these last few months that he became acquainted with this  Christian  rascal when he became idle and of course vicious"  No human being surely ever had a greater dread of idleness than Mr Monck Berkeley and often during the latter part of his illness used to exclaim  "What an idle life I lead Surely God will I fear call me into judgement for it I do nothing I write nothing"  Mr Berkeley lamented that through the stupidity of the  then  town clerk the poor creature had not been admitted to bail After dinner he retired to his own apartment and consulted his law books He was to leave Canterbury very early the next morning in company with his very amiable neighbour William Deedes Junior Esquire of St Stephen's Canterbury both being obliged to keep term that day at the TempleMr Deedes that he might not idle away a large estate which he now possesses and spends most worthily Mr Berkeley that he might get one as he probably would have done had it pleased God to have blessed him with health  About eleven o'clock at night Mr Berkeley came home and thus accosted his Mother  "My dear Madam you must be pleased to  promise me  that you will go tomorrow morning the minute you have breakfasted  before  you go to church  to this poor creature's parents and tell them that if they do not retain Garrow to plead for their son he will certainly be sentenced to deaththat Garrow can and will get him off I know he has a cause this assize at Maidstone and if they will give him sixty guineas he will come on to Canterbury Don't let them  hackle  with him for he will not come for a less fee and I know he will come for that and  I  repeat it and I desire you to say that  nothing else can  save their sonpoor fellow"  Mrs B  "I know not even where they live"  Mr B  "Oh John will find that out for you"  Mrs B  "I do not know them and they would think it very odd in me an ignorant woman"    Mr B  "  Odd  or  even  best of Mothers if you don't this minute  promise me solemnly  that you will go and say what I have desired you I will take my hat and knock them up and tell it them myself"  To prevent her Son's going Mrs Berkeley though with but an indifferent grace made the promise and after prayers the family retired In the morning a little before five the hour the chaise was ordered Mr Berkeley crept into the chamber like a zephyr that he might not disturb his  Father a very bad sleeper and repeated in his Mother's ear all she was to say The promise once obtained he had no uneasiness on that score The Editor after breakfast set off for Best's Lane where she witnessed  such  a scene as her dear compassionate Son being removed she trusts and thinks no one can  ever again  compel her to witness  On entering the house she saw affliction personified in the figure of a decent middleaged woman Mrs Berkeley conceiving her the mother of the unfortunate young man began condoling with her Soon coming to the point telling her who she was and delivering her Son's message the poor woman exclaimed  "My God what goodness that  such  a gentleman should condescend to think about such a  poor wretch  as I am Oh may God reward him Well to be sure somebody  did  tell me that a fine young gentleman one of the Prebendary's Sons did say walking on the Parade with other gentlemen that my  poor boy need not  have been committed to gaol"  She instantly rose and called her husband On his entering the room she repeated Mr Berkeley's message with delightwhen horrid to relatewhat can one call him not a descendant of Abraham by Sarah not a  Saracen  as the descendants of Esau style themselves that they be not mistaken for the descendants of Abraham by Hagar he must have been an  Ishmaelite  worse than an Ishmaelite for not only his hand but his HORRID tongue was against  his  own  child for in an hoarse surly voice he said  "  No no I shall do not such thing let him take his chance if he can't get off he must be hanged  "  Mrs Berkeley on seeing the agonies of the poor distracted mother longed to have said to him  "  You will be damned  "  She did however restrain her indignation a little and joined the supplications of the wretched Mother elevated with Mr Berkeley's message into confidence of her poor son's life now thrown into the deepest despair Never did the Editor so much wish for a large fortune as at that moment to have given the mother the fee for the counsel that Mr Monck Berkeley so earnestly recommended After finding all soothing utterly in vain she gave a loose to her indignation saying every thing that it suggested to her At length bidding farewel to this wretched mourning mother she returned home without deigning to look at the old father Much it may be supposed  he  felt this Not so his kind adviser Mr Monck Berkeley One of the Editor's  minor  punishments for her children when young until ten or twelve years old was  "You have not behaved well in so or so I will not look at you until tomorrow dinner time"  This was so keenly felt by her eldest Son Mr Monck Berkeley that he would often in the sweetest voice supplicate  "Now do forget it and look at me a little"  A proof this of what the Editor frequently asserts  "That a little common sense and great steadiness may rescue children from  much  corporal  punishment and make a more lasting impression on their minds"  Compassion carried her sometimes when taking her morning walk to visit this  "  House of moarning  "  This melancholy affair happened several weeks before the assizes The wretch remained inflexible and the poor mother in such a state of despair as never to wash her hands or face put on or take off her cloaths sitting the whole day without uttering a word At length just before the trial was to come on some more powerful orator than Mrs Berkeley probably some modern TERTULLUS prevailed on the old wretch to send and retain Mr Garrow who came on from Maidstone to Canterbury and as Mr Berkeley had foretold got the poor young Jew off for transportation for life Some kind Christian neighbour for she and her children were esteemed by all as the poor soul justly said for more than twenty years past flew out of the Guildhall and told her the  "  joyful tidings  "  She started up fell on her knees thanked God went up stairs dressed herself neatly as formerly went out to the fishmarket and ordered hom her matters for her family as usual  Dr Berkeley on hearing it as all the city was talking of it expressed his astonishment that the mind could so soon after such length of time recover its wanted energy The Editor it may be supposed did not fail to call in Bests  Lane and obey the delightfully pleasing injunction of the Apostle  "Rejoice with them that do rejoice"  The worthy woman's gratitude ascribing the  temporal  salvation of her son to Mr Monck Berkeley's judicious amiably kind advice in which all agreed was very delightful to the fond heart of his happy mother  It is impossible to omit mentioning here that in the year Dr Berkeley had with him at Canterbury Mr Patrick Satterley eldest son of the skilful successful humane Mr Satterley surgeon and apothecary of Hastings for whom Dr Berkeley had taken a lodging accidentally at a silversmith's in Palace Street whose worthy wife was sister to the young man rescued from the gallows by Mr Berkeley Mr Satterley getting a violent fever and Dr Berkeley going to him they discovered that he was the father of their brother's benefactor and immediately declared that no nurse was necessary for that they esteemed it their duty to render every possibly attention to any friend of that dear good Mr Berkeley who had been the means of rescuing their poor brother from an ignominious death  Mr Berkeley on going to Hastings was told by his surgeon in town Mr Blicke that he would find a most skilful attentive medical man in Mr Satterley This gentleman is famous for rescuing persons from  "the house appointed at length for all the descendant of Adam"  "  Apostate  Adam"  as good Dr Joshua Smith styles him in his "Hickes's Psalms" The aged he by God's blessing on his great medical skill preserves in  comfortable  health to extreme old agethe  dreadfully rash  young who presume to rush uncalled into the presence of  "the  great Judge  of quick and dead"  by his great chirurgical skill The Editor  knows  two thus happily rescued by him and she knows of several othersone old wretch the late *********** the murderer of her amiable accomplished friend the late Judge Advocate of *******  Mr Satterley  presuming  to give himself a few holydays to make a visit to his eldest son a very elegant amiable young man at Oxford of whom he said to Mr Monck Berkeley  "That young man from a child has never done  that thing  that I wished him not to do"  this horrid old monster dismissed Mr Satterley and called in other medical aid who in one short fortnight dismissed HIMto a place whence he will never return until called to meet the amiable throughly Honourable Mr ******* This old monster had prefixed to his name by birth that pretty elegant word which should remind all who possess it not to disgrace it  Honourable  *****  The Editor is sometimes by one or two of her  gnatstraining  although not  camelswallowing  friends accused of  want of charity  in  guessing  at the place of abode of some  departed spirits to which she replies from her oldfashioned book  "The HOLY SPIRIT declares that  without  HOLINESS  no  man or woman either however beautiful c shall see the LORD"  Do you think that General  or Mrs  were HOLY persons The Editor has no doubt but that many very  One of our witty as well as pious  antient  Divines says  "Hell will be paved with  good resolutions  filled with  good sort  of people"  good  sort  of people will declare that the Editor's Preface deserves to be  burnt  by the hands of the common hangman but if it benefits or consoles one  single  soul she will esteem herself happy  The last time the Editor visited Canterbury alas she called on the worthy Israelites to thank them for their kind gratitude shewn to Mr Patrick Satterley when they repeated to her what they had as above related said to Dr Berkeley There are certainly some  "  double distilled superfine elegant  "  CHRISTIANS in Canterbury who might have learned gratitude from these Jews in humble station  When Mr Monck Berkeley was a very little boy the very respectable  Henchman Esquire of the India House losing his worthy father before he was fourteen was sent off to India On bidding adieu to his elegant mother he threw his arms about her saying  "Farewel my dear mother God only knows whether we shall ever meet again in this world But comfort yourself with this  that as I leave you an  honest  boy whether I live or die by God's blessing you shall never hear of me but as an  honest  man"  So saying he quitted the house and from what the Editor gathers from her newspaper Mr Henchman seems to keep his charming early promise The Editor has not the pleasure of being at all acquainted with him having never seen him since his return from India The above little anecdote is related  verbatim  as it was told to Dr Berkeley and herself at the time by their sensible agreeable friend the late Reverend Humphrey Henchman Fellow of All Souls College Oxford Both these gentlemen were grand and greatgrandsons of Bishop Henchman of London This story was very frequently told to Mr Monck Berkeley by his Mother during his childhood and youth with exhortations to make the same resolution Mr Berkeley used frequently to say  "Whatever faults I have I thank God and my dear Mother that I am an  honest  man"  He was in truth so and it may with equal truth be asserted a man of the strictest honour  When Mr Monck Berkeley was a very little boy his mother made him get in memory the lines of Mr Pope  a little altered for his particular  use  "Reflect that lessen'd fame is ne'er regain'd  "And  boyish  honour  once  is always stain'd"  When about six years old he came one day to his mother with Pope in his hand saying  "My dear mamahere is a man that has got your verses and printed them but not  quite write  for he says  virgin  honour"  Mr Monck Berkeley when grown up used to say  "What a little fool I must have been not to find out that my mother was the alterer not Mr Pope"  Mrs George Berkeley incurred some ridicule for thus early instilling into her little boy a sense of honour but where  conscience  is concerned she ever did by GOD's grace ever will defy  ridicule  which let the wretched Lord Shaftesbury say what he will is  "  not the test of  TRUTH  for such a genius as his Lordship may ridicule the whole life of the Saviour of the World His Lordship's death  merited  ridicule Bishop Berkeley has frequently told his son  "that so lamentably illtempered was he in the latter stage of his life that his poor lady used when any company arrived to post out of the room and conjure them for  her  sake to assent to  every  thing her Lord asserted or said or it would put him into such a passion as might kill him"  Happy philosophy for one on the brink of the grave    The Editor has to return her most grateful heartfelt acknowledgements for the wonderfully kind amiable attentions of the Reverend Dr Lynch Prebendary of Canterbury for his incessant unwearied exertions in  endeavouring  to lighten her  heavy  business at Canterbury It was  her  misfortune  not his  fault that he happened to pitch upon the last man in England whom she would have appointed her surveyor and more particularly as he owed very great obligations to Dr Berkeley The Editor some weeks ago being advised by a printer to apply to a papermaker a very rich man for paper to print off the second volume of Literary Relics prepared by Mr Monck Berkeley the supplying it was  civilly  declined The Editor remarked that she was sure before she wrote that it would because he was under very important obligations to Dr Berkeley The very worthy bookseller the obliging Mr Cook of Oxford said  "Do I understand you right Madam"    "Yes Sir I have in repeated instances since my loss of Dr Berkeley  experienced it as through the goodness of God I have met with numerous instances of  real  friendship where neither on Dr Berkeley's or my own account I had  any  right to expect  any  attention but civility"  It is impossible for the Editor to pass on without inserting here the name of the witty worthy William Hey Esquire Commissioner of the Customs for his unwearied exertions to serve her the noble the angelic conduct of the worthy Mrs Taylor of Clarges Street Piccadilly an  eléve  of the lovely Mrs Catharine Talbot who had the happiness to live with her many years who hearing that the Editor not caring to  coin  was in some difficulties most generously wrote to her offering to sell out her  whole  fortune to lend to Mrs Berkeley the stocks then at sixtyfive It may easily be  guessed  what answer the Editor returned to this  wonderful  offermay HE who seeth in secret reward her openlyIndeed she has as many  friends  as acquaintances Yes may HE who rewardeth every man  according  to his works reward these worthy compasionate friendscompassionate I repeat for an aged matron without a son although not quite a beggar  may  be very often is a great object of compassion  The Editor's thanks are particularly due her prayers are daily offered at the throne of Gracemay they be heard and answered an hundred a thousand fold on them and theirsto her excellent old friend Sir Richard Hill for  the trouble he has taken is perpetually still taking concerning her affairs English and Irish To the amiable Dr Lynch as above mentioned to the very learned grateful Mr Sawkins student of Christ Church for literally  forcing  money upon her when she could not procure a guinea from Ireland enabling her to pay a quarter's salary to one of Dr Berkeley's Curates who wrote  twice  before Dr Berkeley had been dead three weeks The salary became due on the st of December Mrs Berkeley lost her beloved Partner on the th of January exactly sixteen days after Dr Berkeley whether he received money or not from Ireland was always most scrupulously  conscientiously  careful to pay his Curates' salary from the time that he had the happiness at twentysix of having his beloved respected friend the very learned Mr John Whitaker  This worthy gentleman is a lineal descendant of the spirited Walworth Lord Mayor of London His uncle the late Major Walworth was the last male descendant of that NOBLE magistrate of the City of London  the able the unanswerable Vindicator of Mary Queen of Scots in that relation to him as also the excellently pious Philip Gurdon  This excellent gentleman is now residing on the large estate on which the Conqueror  found  his grandsirelong may he and his descendants enjoy it They owe it to the most wonderful instance of true friendship perhaps ever performed by any  meerly  human being The Editor here sets down the story as it has often been related to her by the excellent Mr Gurdon when curate to Dr Berkeley at Cookham  In the year  Gourdon as it was then spelt Esquire was nominated one of the Judges to try the unfortunate King Charleshe determined to attendthe minister of his parish used many arguments to dissuade him but all in vain The night before he was to commence his journey to London he stayed with him till eleven o'clock a late hour in the those wiser times telling him that setting aside the  indignity  of the business it would be the destruction of his  antient  family and  large  estate at length the excellent pastor unable to prevail on his  steady  patron took his leave Early the next morning Mr Gurdon set out for London a long narrow lane lay between his house and the high roadon a sudden the coach stopped with a violent jerk in the narrowest part of the lane The coachman called out to the postillion to know why he dared to stop so suddenly He replied  "The horses won't go on"    " Whip them then"    "I can't for Dr  name forgotten by the Editor lies across the road all in the mud"  Mr Gurdon putting his head out of the coach enquired the cause when his heavenly pastor spoke as follows  "My dear friend you are going on a most iniquitous business I have said  all  I am capable of  saying  I am now doing all that  I  am capable of  doing  If you  will  go you shall drive over  my body  "  Mr Gurdon struck the Editor can never relate it without her eyes filled with tears fell back in his coach then recovering himself said  "Thou best of men I will go back come into the coach to me"    "No not unless you swear to me that you will give up the matter"  which Mr Gurdon did and by so doing preserved his estate for the present excellent amiable possessor of it On the King's return Mr Gurdon was attained as one of the King's Judges his name is in the list the Editor thinks in Nalson's "Life of Charles the First" but it was happily proved that Mr Gurdon  did not attend  of Assenwick Hall in Suffolk both gentlemen of  fortune but the idea of detaining a Curate's salary however rich he might be always hurt him It is supposed the worthy man who applied so expeditiously to his relict conceived that she could not be hurt but by a pair of red hot pincersA young Sprig of Divinity also too old to have acted thus whose worthy father ever gratefully acknowledged himself under high obliations to Dr Berkeley on many accounts  pecuniary  as well as other employed a  LAWYER to write to the Editor before the interment of her beloved Partner demanding the payment ofa not very large sum borrowed by Dr Berkeley of his father during Dr Berkeley's Chancery suit in Ireland The Editor is indebted to the goodness of Dr Berkeley's worthy old friend the Reverened the Dean of Hereford for answering the  Lawyer's Letter  and adjusting matters with this  grateful Divine  who in his early youth was one of the  many quarterers  on Dr Berkeley's wonderful hospitality Pity to the FATHER of the Divinity Sprig prevents his name from appearing in these pages The Editor involuntarily exclaimed with the antient Sage  "Thrifty careful of the MAIN chance as this young man is I had rather have my dead son than two such living ones"  He wrote a very fine letter  apologetic  to the Editor for his  prudence  to which as she was not by her friends  permitted  to answer in her own style when wounded  she  never returned any answer at all and only laments that his zeal to recover so  speedily  a sum considerably under two hundred pounds should have reduced him to the  meanness  of falsifying as the attorney however clever could not by inspiration have dictated the carefully preserved epistle to the Editor without orders from his employer Indeed he therein says he had orders cShould this Preface happen to be redde by the Curate or the  Sprig  of Divinity if they keep their  own  counsel the Editor means not to publish their names nor to make them known to more persons than their own  wonderful  conduct naturally introduced them toQuitting these  prudent  persons the Editor turns to more pleasant ones  The worthy friends of Mrs Berkeley who in that very early period of her affliction visited  "the house of mourning"  laboured to heal not to tear open her  deep  wounds They thought not they acted not like these two  Divines  but as was most elegantly expressed in a polite kind letter of enquiry to a friend from Mrs Trenchard of Hendon's House  "My heart bleeds for those two  ladies  before  their  deep  wounds for the loss of Mr Berkeley are healed to have them  thus  torn open afresh  There subsisted between Dr Berkeley and his sisterinlaw Mrs Frinsham the sincerest tender friendship  "  Mrs Trenchard cannot probably translate Greek nor write Latin quite so well as these Divines but she has a highly cultivated mind and a most feeling heart  The names as above mentioned are not communicated because the Editor believes the  hasty  Curate a  really worthy  man although not blessed with  quite  so much delicacy as the worthy daughter of farmer Strange of Heddington near Oxford who about five months after the death of Dr Berkeley presented a bill to the Editor for corn and hay On her coming into the room to receive her money a pretty considerable  sum Mrs Berkeley enquiring of her why she had not applied before as she might probably have been glad of it with the spirit of a princess of an angel she replied  "Good Madam how could I think of  troubling you  for a  few  pounds in  your deep affliction  I wonder I could do it now but I heard you were about to leave Oxford and I thought perhaps you might not know of this bill but if it is any inconvenience to you to pay it now I am perfectly willing to wait for it"  May this worthy woman never experience the loss of her good husband and an only child  The forming this kind wish for this amiablehearted woman brings to the Editor's mind what occurred many years ago Walking out one evening she called at a farmhouse to enquire for some pigeons The mistress presented herself Mrs Berkeley wishing to shorten her walk home requested the good woman to direct her the nearer way in crossing the fields Mrs Berkeley not to appear proud began enquiring what family she had The reply made she added  "Ah Madam I have  thrice  known the  sorrows of widowhood  "  It had not  much  injured her health She was remarkably plump and  "well favoured"  perhaps she may have suffered the same sorrows again She might perhaps be as great a philosopher as her daughter who kept a shop in the next parish where Dr Berkeley's family bought many odd things whose daughter a fine girl of seventeen  was dying of a consumption Mrs Berkeley one Sunday at church enquired after the young woman On hearing there were no hopes of her recovery she condoled with the mother who made the following reply it is set down  verbatim  "Good lackaday Madam why  she  and  I did not come into the world  at the  same time  and why should we think to  go out  at the  same time  "  Probably these good women mourned the loss of relatives as did a tenant's wife of the late worthy agreeable Capt Bartlam of Moore Hall The day after the death of her husband Mrs Bartlam called to see her and began condoling with her to whom she replied  "O good lackadaisy Madam 'tis a  sad thing to be sure  I have been CRYING  all  the morning  long  and as soon as ever I have ate this bit of bread and cheese and drank this  drap  of ale a pint I must go to it again as hard as I can for my life"  How often has the Editor seen a table full of company at Dr Berkeley's laugh until  unforced  tears bedewed their cheeks when this story was related and acted by that best of storytellers the late delightfully witty Reverend James Hamilton grandson of Lord Abercorn formerly named in this Preface As also that he spent the whole of the summer at Dr Berkeley's his curate constantly going to Mr Hamilton's house in Warwickshire in May and remaining there until November in order that Mr Hamilton might as Dr Berkeley used to say  "give  him  all the time he could spare from his  friends  the beasts of the field the fowls of the air and the fishes of the river"  Mr Hamilton although an excellent scholar was wonderfully fond of hunting shooting and fishing Dr Berkeley living on the banks of the Thames had always a large pleasureboat of his own in which Mr Hamilton an excellent sailor and rower was perpetually on the water alone early in the morning but frequently took Mr Monck Berkeley with him Mrs Berkeley dreading his too volatile agility feared that in  attempting  to ASSIST Mr Hamilton in sailing or rowing he might be drowned notwithstanding her strong opinion still retained by the Editor although often laughed at by Mr Hamilton that infants if put into the water would swim naturally as well as puppies kittens calves c He often urged her to  try the experiment  on her own little boy Mrs Berkeley told him she was not an  experimental  philosopher and was terribly afraid he might be drowned with his garments  not  provided by nature like kittens c  During Mr Berkeley's stay at the King's school nothing could prevail upon him to swim out of his depth to the great discontent of his mother One day after having been some time at Eton a young gentleman from Eton came over to see him and happening to relate something said to Mrs Berkeley  "You know he swims as well as you do"  To which the Editor replied  "That is not at all I suppose"    O yes Madam Berkeley is I really think the best swimmer in the school I don't suppose  any  thing could drown him but the boat fastening him in the mudhe swims like a duck"  Mrs Berkeley asked her son how this came to pass he replied  "Why they found what a fool I was so a party of them took me out in a boat and when we were got into deep water contrived to throw me overboard then rowed away they kindly waited to see whether I could swim in order to take me up if I could not I horridly frighted instantly swam after them and have swum as he says 'like a duck' ever since I am sure I was much obliged by them  adding  "Eton for ever say I"  The Editor had frequently before her Son was born heard Lady  relate this practice of the Etonians to a new comer and it actually occasioned her worrying her Lord out of his  determination  of sending his son to Eton Folly thy name is  Woman  Accordingly  Lordy  as they style the Peers' eldest son in Scotland had NOTHING of Eton about him when he came out into life The Editor's kindred had always been Etonians and Oxonians She does not remember to have heard that any of them turned out foolish  vautriens  Mr Berkeley like most Eton men was a very excellent rower as was most happily experienced by a party of ladies and gentlemen in his father's boat Dr Berkeley c had gone up the river to dine at Medenham Abbeysoon after they had entered the boat to return a most dreadful storm of thunder lightning and rain came on Some of the ladies were much terrified which Mr Berkeley perceiving said to Mr Wrightson  "Come John give me your oar"  and the Editor fears to set down in how short a time Mr Berkeley and his father's gardener formerly a most excellent waterman now an helpless aged almshouseman at Maidenhead rowed eleven milesthe boat seemed to fly But Mr Berkeley exerted himself so violently happily for the party for within ten minutes after their landing the storm became frightfully tremendous indeed that he could scarce use his elegant astonishingly strong fingers for three days afterMr Monck Berkeley and several of the Monck family have that sort of fingers which seem as if they have neither sinews or bone in them but when called into action feel like iron The Editor used frequently to request her son when he had given her his hand feeling like peeling sattin to  stiffen  it which he would instantly do and she conceives that no two men without he chose it could have unbent it Neither his father nor his brother had their fingers so wonderfully formed by nature  begged Mr  Hamilton to reject his suit and leave him on the terrass One day seeing Mr Hamilton preparing to sail  he screamed  "Oh dear Jemmy pray take me with you"    "No I must not your Mamma is afraid you will be drowned"  Mr Berkeley immediately walked into the Thames in his petticoats being then little more than three years old and pursued the boat Mr Hamilton instantly putting back asked him if he was not afraid of being drowned as he must have been if he had not put back The spirited little creature replied  "Aye aye  but I considered  before I walked in that you would  certainly  come back and take me before the water got up to my chin because Mamma would have been  so  grieved if I had been drowned"  The same sound judgement and resolute spirit accompanied him through life  A Scotch gentleman of consequence one day at St Andrews said to Dr Berkeley  "Sir I last night saw your agreeable Son as  fou  with water as most of the company were with wine"  Dr Berkeley who himself drank nothing but water expressed his wonder at it Mrs Berkeley supposing the gentleman was a dealer in the marvellous mentioned it to her Son in that way to which he replied  "Yes my dear Madam it is very true I am often as drunk with water as others are with wine with this however very material difference that when it is proposed to break bottles glasses and burn chairs tables c I instantly become as sober as a judge and have sometimes prevented much mischief"  When Mr Berkeley entered at the university of St Andrews one of the college officers called upon him to deposit a crown to pay for the windows he might break Mr Berkeley said that  "as he should reside in his Father's house it was little likely he should break any windows having never that he remembered broke one in his whole life"  He was assured that he  would  do it at St Andrews He therefore made the deposit the cause of which he some time after learned On the rising of the session several of the students said  "Now for the windows Come it is time to set off let us sally forth"  Mr Berkeley being called upon enquired what was to be done They with one voice replied  "Why to break every window in college"    "For what reason"    "Oh no reason but that it has always been done from time immemorial"  Mr Berkeley sedately replied that he begged to be excused joining the party having never when a  boy  at Eton and sometimes with more wine in his head than was good for him performed such a  valiant  feat he should feel himself exceedingly ashamed to be guilty of it as a  young man  He spoke so sensibly on the subject that the practice was from that time entirely given up and has probably never been revived The money continued to be collected as the following little aneodote will shew A very good kind of man formerly coachman at Lord Balcarras's the College Porter was the collector He one day told a very intimate friend of Mr Berkeley's the young Laird of Kincaldrum  "I am just  come from a poor student indeed I went for the window  croon  he cried begged and prayed not to pay it saying 'he brought but a croon to keep him all the session and he had spent sixpence of it so I have got only four and sixpence' How he is to live I can't tell for they are very poor"  Away flew the amiable young Laird saying  "I must make a collection for him"  Amongst the students he first met Mr Halket eldest son of Sir J Halket a beloved Scotch friend of Mr Monck Berkeley This charming youth said  "Here take these few shillings it is  all  I have till I hear from home again"  The young Laird said  "Such an one will give a shilling and such an one half a crown and  I  will  make  my dear Berkeley give a crown"  The idea of his saying  make  diverted the whole university who all knew Mr Berkeley's wonderful liberality to the poor He soon met Mr Berkeley who not only tossed out the crown but said  "We will make a  good  collection go you Bower the young Laird's name to the Scotch and I to the English"  Mr Berkeley posted home and made his Father Mother and Aunt subscribe largely as also all the English gentlemen students The subscription when closed was a very noble one This poor youth was the son of a labourer who having  two  fields about eight miles from St Andrews kept  three  cows one cow was sold to dress him for the University and put the  lamented  croon in his pocket to purchase coals All the lower students study by  fire light He brought with him a large tub of oatmeal and a pot of salted butter on which he was to subsist from the th of October until the th of May the space of five months but for this lucky affair of the  croon  and the lovely nature of the young Laird of Kincaldrum as accomplished as amiable In what is called in Scotland an  high dance  this young gentleman could keep himself more than half a minutenear a minutein air No one who has not seen a company of Highland soldiers dance can form  any  idea of it more than our greatgrandsires could of electricity before Dr Franklin's time  The very humane worthy college cook agreed with the young Laird and Mr Berkeley to provide him a good dinner of flesh or fish through the session The Editor is sorry to say some of his countrymen said  "that it was not  quite roight  of these young gentlemen to make this subscriptionthey might be made every day"  This brings to the Editor's mind the  indignation  of she is very sorry to say  a Divine  against her Son at Hastings for a similar offence On the arrival of the three hundred French clergy within two days at Hastings Mr Berkeley said to his friend Mr Grimston  "It is impossible to let these poor persecuted strangers starve in a foreign country we must try and make a subscription for them"  Mr Grimston  jelon son coutume  tossed down his guinea Mr  Monck Berkeley cried  "Stop stop my dear friend not  so  fast you will ruin all No I will draw up their case and you and I will set down against our names halfacrown each halfacrown cannot distress any one who has any thing to give We may give as much more as we please but set down only two shillings and sixpence"  They accordingly did so and amongst their acquaintance got many subscribers The paper was left at one of the circulating libraries The following account was related to the Editor by a gentleman who was an eyewitness of the transaction The door opened and a stout man entered saying  "Who is  this  MR BERKELEY that makes himself of  such  consequence  picking people's pockets  for these  French  ragamuffins who is he what is he"  Mr Berkeley happening to be in a corner of the library reading rose and advancing with a very graceful bow in the mildest voice replied  "Sir Mr Berkeley is a man of no sort of consequence nor pretends to be of any but quoting the Latin line '  as a man I must feel  ' c he felt it impossible not to  try  to alleviate the sufferings of these poor unfortunate servants of our Blessed Master and as by your  habit  Sir you appear to be of the  clerical function  I should have hoped  you  would  rather  have forwarded than abused the attempt to relieve their  real  necessities no one is  compelled  For this reason the Editor always wishes the Prime Minister to make  plenty  of Lotteries because then persons of small incomes may  choose  whether they will be half beggared by taxes or not The Editor used generally to get share of a twenty or fifty pounds prize but lately the  blind  Goddess has deserted her which is  rather  unkind as she is now  half  blind  in cases of subscription Mr  name not at present recollected the Librarian kindly permitted it to lie here"  Mr Berkeley then bowed and retired to his book again leaving the  oratorical  PARSON the Editor always styles an unworthy clergyman a PARSON ready to faint with shame One day after Mr Berkeley's arrival at Cheltenham his family all in the drawingroom he asked  "Pray my dear friends do any of you know Mr  of  "    "No"  was the unanimous voice  "Well you have  no great  loss I am  sorry  to add that he is a Divine"  Mr Berkeley then related as above  Had these poor people applied to this  Divine  as they did to Mr Berkeley on the death of a French Marquis whose title the Editor forgets they had not perhaps been as much consoled as they were by a young  Lawyer  They came to Mr Berkeley in great anxiety to know whether it was  possible  for  him  to get the Marquis buried in  consecrated  ground He assured them it would be impossible for  him  or any one else to prevent it adding  "We Protestants are  certainly better Christians  than you Papists for had  I  died in France you would have buried me in a cabbagegarden or on the ramparts"  This point settled the next  "would  le pauvre cher Marquis  have  aucune office  said over  The Editor cannot omit mentioning here a ludicrous occurrence on her first arrival in Scotland sleeping at the  neat pleasant  town of Kelso let Swift say what he will of  Hellso  As soon as she was up in the morning she walked out and seeing a funeral she joined it wishing to hear the  Scottish  funeral service She enquired whether it was a young or an aged person to proportion her sorrowever lamenting the youngand where hope is not precluded rejoicing that the aged  "are delivered from the  burdens  of the flesh c"  The answer was  "a very aged woman near  ninety  "  On her arrival in the kirkyard the civility of every the lower Scotch to strangers where there are  no bawbies in  the case made way for her to approach close to  "the house appointed for all living"  The Editor did not endeavour to find out a minister robed in a surplice well knowing the horror in which that innocent white robe is held by  all  diffenters from the Church of England and of Romebut for a  black goon  no such could her then tolerable eyes espy The corpse was soon let down into the grave which was filled up when every man took off his hat bowed at the grave and the crowd began to disperse Mrs Berkeley exceedingly shocked at what she had witnessed asked a very sensible intelligentlooking gentleman  "if he could tell her what  could  have  induced so very aged  a person to have been her own executioner"  not as the newspapers phrase it  "  put a period  to their  existence  "    "Alas alas that  they  cannot do"  The gentleman replied  "did she poor woman I never heard that I should think she died of old age quite worn out"    "But Sir if she had not  destroyed herself  she must certainly have received  christian burial  "  The gentleman smiling said  "Madam I presume you are an English lady"    "I arrived in Scotland only yesterday evening Sir"    "I supposed so Madam we have  no  burial office in Scotland"    "Were you ever in England"    "Oh yes"  "Ever at a funeral"    "At many"    "Do you not think our burial service very fine"    "Exquisitely so indeed And surely there is neither superstition or  Poppery  as the Scotch speak Popery in praying for  ourselves  when God removes our friends or neighbours"  This gentleman the Editor learned was a worthy physician of Kelso At her return to the inn relating her anxiety on account of the poor good old Scotch woman and her dialogue at the grave Doctor and Mr Berkeley laughed immoderately Dr Berkeley used frequently to relate it to his Scotch friends at St Andrew's Mr Berkeley used to say it was treating their dead friends just as we treat favourite dead dogs Mr Monck Berkeley always made his father's gardener dig an handsome grave in one of the kitchen gardens at Cookham for his dogs and himself used to plant two rosetrees of different sorts one at the head and one at the foot of their graves which were always kept nicely turfed he had wonderful tenderness and loveliness in his  nature  Dr Berkeley's carriage on their journey to Scotland frequently overtook and was overtaken by the hearse containing the corpse of the sensible amiable welljudging Lord Robert Kerr who died at Newberry in Berkshire at the age of twentyeight His regiment had been quartered at Canterbury six years before His unassuming manners a colonel at  twentytwo  his attachment to the worthy old greyheaded major always consulting him in every thing relating to the regiment endeared him to all who knew him The Editor used to tell several worthy Scotch ministers that she grieved to think sweet Lord Robert should be dragged so many miles to be buried like an  English  dog  Had Mr Monck Berkeley retained in full force the ideas of his childhood they could not have applied to any one  more  likely to assist them When under four years old playing one morning in the dressingroom he on a sudden flew to his Mother saying  "Oh Mamma lay down your work and  see about it  For there is Dick States the famous old sexton of Bray burying a  poor  little child by  himself  without either my Papa or Mr Harmer to pray over it or Mr Wells the clerk to say Amen"  This pious accomplished Curate of Dr Berkeley has an exquisitely accomplished son educated at Oxford who is the Editor fears  since  Dr Berkeley's death a  distressed  Divine in London His skill in music and French were he not a Divine must have procured him a large salary His father was a wonderfully fine performer on many instruments and had the finest voice also in preaching and reading as well as in singing that the Editor ever heard Mrs Berkeley told the young  zealot  that it was some poor little infant that having died very soon after its birth had not been baptized The Editor took care to have all her own babes baptized  within  the hour after their birth lest a fit should carry them off Mrs Berkeley used to express her astonishment to her mother that she permitted  her  to remain unbaptized ten days after her entrance into this  "  vale of tears  "  It could for the first part of her life hardly with propriety be styled such to her as after pushing forth one short cry to  notisy  as the Scotch phrase it that  "  she was in life  "  as an infant she  never did cry at all  which occasioned a learned  honest  physician's being consulted to know whether she had not  some inward  disorder that prevented her crying as infants usually do He replied  "Not she She is a pure healthy goodhumoured little Puss so does not plague you or herself by squaliing"  Mr Berkeley said  "Why Mamma  you  tell me that God knows  every  thing  before  it happens Now if he  knew  that he  intended  this little child should stay such a  very  short time upon earth  I  think it was  hardly  worth his while to give himself the  trouble  to send it down here  at all  "  It is needless to add here the Editor's comments to her  little  inquisitive  sceptie  who if the expression may be permitted watched GOD's dealings with man with a most jealous eye hoping to espy a  flaw  His  comments  on the twentyseventh chapter of Genesis which he stumbled on rather than searched out for himself finding he had been made to miss it in his course of reading cost the Editor  much  trouble to rectify although she retained an accurate remembrance of  every  word of a sermon preached on  that whole chapter  by the late very learned Archdeacon of Berks Dr Dodwell when she was about sixteen years old  him"    Oui certainement    "  Ah grace au bon Dieu quoi Monsieur quoi  "  Mr Berkeley said he would shew it them But he went too far there was not a French Common Prayer Book to be procured in  Hastings He therefore most amiably took his pen and translated the whole of our delightful burialservice into French for them excepting the Lesson and Psalms which he shewed them in his Greek Testament and Latin Bible  They were in extacies with it They wished to attend the Marquis to the grave but feared as the French  ever  did being knocked down by the  English  Mr Berkeley assured them the English were not  such  savages But all in vain  was his rhetoric unless Monsieur  Berquelée  would  "  avoir la bontée  "  to walk at their head as  chief  mourner for  le cher Marquis  which by the undertaker's omitting to bring a cloak he did in his  Royal Archer's coat  In a letter to his mother he says  "Do think of  your  son marching in procession at the head of three hundred French Priests as chief mourner to a poor persecuted French Noble"  The elegant accomplished Bishop of the Editor thinks Avranches on quitting the house of a very respectable clergyman who kindly received and entertained him and requested Mr Monck Berkeley to visit and converse with him the gentlemen not speaking French his gratitude to Mr Berkeley for what his Lordship termed his  etonante bonté  to his poor brethren and exquisitely polite attentions to himself he declared himself at a loss for words to express He conjured Mr Berkeley when things were again settled in France that he would visit him at his palace Alas thou elegant amiable Prelatethou wilt probably visit Paradise before thou doest Paris  Mr Berkeley often mentioned with pleasure the worthiness and propriety of many of the three hundred clergy Not a man would receive a shilling who had brought any money with him others who had friends in town would only take barely enough to defray the expence of their journey to London  Had the Editor time to look over her Son's letters she would give his account of the landing of the good old Curate of Dieppe aged the farewel between him and his flock of sailors The Editor remembers Mr Berkeley says  "There was not I believe  one  dry eye English or French on the shore The good old Pastor is now gone to London I have the delight of thinking that GOD will go with him  wherever  he goes"  But to return to the subject of dancing in which the young Laird of Kincaldrum has been already noticed How delightfully do the Scotch dance every thing but a minuet The first time the Editor saw her Son esteemed a very good dancer having learned in England and in France for ten years  de suite  dance a countrydance and cotillon in Scotland it turned her quite sick She thought he danced like a ploughman until some minuets were attempted between the countrydances which a little consoled her The next morning she requested Mr Berkeley to let her treat him with a master that he might learn to dance like a Scotchman The offer was gratefully accepted and the very able Mr Jenkins attended Mr Berkeley every day greatly to the improvement of Mr Berkeley as has been above mentioned and exceedingly through his kindness to the finances of Mr Jenkins who just before or soon after Mr Berkeley quitted St Andrews by his wise  advise migrated to London where he attended by Mr Berkeley's recommendation many young persons of high rank and fashion  Mr Berkeley made it a point when at Oxford and the Temple to spend every Christmas vacation with his Parents They although the house in the Oaks was not  peculiarly  calculated for a ball  Yet by the clever contrivance of Mr Monck Berkeley ever fruitful in expedients twenty couple used to dance get negus and cakes in the eatingroom and eat their soup and  petit soupé  in Mr Monck Berkeley's sittingroom up stairs which occasioned Lady D  one day asking Dr Berkeley when in town  "Has Mrs Berkeley any room in her house at the Oaks that  I  have never seen"  By removing all the furniture sideboard c ten couple danced two dancesthen ten more  could not bear the idea of Mr Berkeley's dancing at many of their neighbours' houses and not seeing them in return The house could not hold all their numerous acquaintance in and about Canterbury so of  Dames d'une certaine age  as the French speak of a middleaged lady none were invited to cards but the mothers and of course the fathers of dancingyoungladies Mrs Berkeley saying like the old father mentioned by Mr Addison in the Spectator that  she  did not feel it right to invite young ladies to be made WHIRLYGIGS without inviting their natural their  best chaperons  their mothers to attend them One year a most throughly respectable lady  The late amiable throughly pious Mrs Wadham Knatchbullexcellent woman She has  now  met Mr Berkeley in a gayer place than a ballroom May those who loved them here strive to join them in the realms of bliss  said to the Editor  "Madam I have a great favour to request of you"    "You may command me Madam"    "It is that you will permit me to come to your house next Tuesday for one hour I do not wish you to invite me to the ball or the cardparty I know you  cannot  do it but I hear so much from every body of Mr Berkeley's wonderfully fine dancing that I do long to  see  him dance and I never go to any assembly so that I have no chance but your admitting me for one hour I will  not  stay any longer say what you will I am resolved"  The very worthy Dr Lambe Prebendary of Worcester became Principal of Magdalene Hall not long after Mr Berkeley's entering there He happened to be in the hall when Dr Lambe arrived and most of the other members were absent Mr Berkeley instantly waited on his new superior and with his usual polite benignity offered his services in every way in which they could be useful The Editor recollects to have heard her Son say that after certain necessary things performed and dinner ended the new Principal asked Mr Berkeley  "if they ought not to go to chapel"  to which Mr Berkeley replied in the affirmative  if  they could get a reader and muster a congregation The Editor thinks it was either the commencement or the end of the term and that there was only one member in the Hall besides Mr Berkeley who  she thinks was the very worthy amiable now Reverend Mr Sloman a beloved respected friend of Mr Berkeley's who has frequently delighted the Editor by saying  "that he conceived he owed his life to Mr Berkeley as did many other gentlemen at the same time"  A party of gentlemen many of them members of the Hall had agreed that on the first fine day they would sail down the river some milesthe Editor does not recollect to what place but thinks it was to Godstow Abbey The party consisted of eleven and Mr Berkeley ever delighting to give pleasure to young and old begged to take with him a lad son to a lady a relation of his Mother's at home for the holydays Accordingly on Easter Monday they set out when they had sailed two or three miles some accident happened to the boat the waterman saw it coming and threw himself out for which Mr Berkeley always when mentioning it styled him a sad villain adding  "He left the whole number to perish for  he  did not know that any of us could swim"  The boat instantly overset only two of the party could swim Mr Pearce nephew to the late Bishop of Rochester and Mr Monck Berkeley being both Eton men they were good swimmers and soon escaped to shore when Mr Pearce humanely said  "Berkeley we must try to save them all Let us go in instantly"  To which Mr Berkeley replied  "If we do we are dead men Pearce No  we must wait till they are more spent or they will infallibly cling so fast that they will sink us"  This wise advice was followed Mr Berkeley first rescued his little kinsman as considering himself in some sort responsible for him as a lad of eleven years old of whom he had taken the charge After some little time Mr Pearce and Mr Berkeley plunged in and by the blessing of God brought every one safe on shore They sent to Oxford for coaches and on their arrival getting rid of their drenched cloaths Mr Berkeley immediately wrote to his Mother assuring her that whatever lamentable history the newspaper might happen to make of it by the mercy of God he had still the happiness to be able to subscribe himself her dutiful Son c His attentions to the feelings of his Mother  "for an only Son"  were incessant The Editor had from his youth told Mr Berkeley that if he should be expelled from Eton or get his name entered in the Black Book at Oxford she was very sure that she should lie down and die of grief as she and he verily believed she would have done He would frequently through life say  "If I do so or so I shall kill my Mother"  He is receiving his blessed reward It may perhaps be said by those who were intimate in the family that Mrs Berkeley was a kind obliging Mother  The Editor bred up by her mother with an aversion to affectation of  every  sort or kind and instilling the same aversion into her son they never complimented each other by the poor humble now  humbled  title of  Mr  and  Mrs Berkeley  when speaking to each other or of each other or to those who were acquainted with them the Editor always telling her Son that until  his Father  had  stood  behind a  counter  she should never call him any thing but Berkeley or Monck for were she to live to see him Lord Chancellor his  name  would be Berkeley If in a large company of friends Mr Berkeley spoke two or three times to his Mother and she did not attend to answer him he used to say  "Well Madam if you do not listen to me I protest I will call you  Mrs Berkeley  and that  I am sure  will make you mind me"  The Editor's sensible agreeable friend and  quondam  neighbour Admiral Sir G  Y  pursues the same plan with his throughly worthy Lady frequently saying  "Aye she wont mind me I may call Nanny till I am hoarse I'll say Lady Y  and you'll see she'll listen to me in a minute"  She laboured  to be such after the time ceased when she was to be held up to Mr Berkeley  in terrorem  that is when he grew up to be a fine sensible youth when Solomon tells us  "a  word  enters more into a  wise  man than a thousand stripes into a  fool  "  A  very tight  rein in early youth  no  rein at all after a certain period  no  influence but what arises from friendship The Editor never could conceive that if a young man or young woman chose to live single till thirty years old or till twentyfive or under that God speaking by MOSES or by St PAUL  meant  they should be treated as at thirteen or fourteen The Editor has repeatedly observed that  Irish  parents are  very  apt to suppose that their authority is to continue to the  end of life  The Editor in early youth admired and revered the conduct of that wise worthy Lady the Duchess of St Alban's who on her amiable daughter that humblest sweetest of women Lady Diana Barrington  first Lady of the very amiable Bishop Barrington completing her twentieth year thus addressed her  "My dear Lady Dy from this day we cease to be  mother  and  daughter  We commence beloved friends When you wish to go into public if I am able I shall be happy to attend you if not you have many friends who will"  Her  wise  very early wise Grace as the Editor has frequently heard her mother relate and Lady Dy ever after lived as most affectionate sisters  One of the Magdalene Hall gentlemen of the party who had escaped being congratulated by the Principal some of them said  "We meant to have gone yesterday but Berkeley would not be of the party  because it was Sunday  "  meaning to divert the Principal at Mr Berkeley's expence That worthy gentleman replied  "  I honour  Mr Berkeley exceedingly for it  I  wish  all  paid the same reverence to the Lord's Day it would be well for them and  they  will wish it some time hence"  The dear excellent Bishop of Norwich used to say to Dr Berkeley  "We all say that Mr Berkeley is Principal of Magdalene Hall and  a very good Principal  he is Dr Lambe's own good sense makes him admire Mr Berkeley's good judgement and propriety so much that we all tell him he may do whatever he pleases"  Mr Berkeley certainly used this delegated power most respectfully  to his excellent governor and wisely at least in  one  instance At the time of his entering every GentlemanCommoner's dinner cost him every day  three shillings and six pence  Mr Berkeley although generous as a prince was a very good oeconomist he enquired and found that at no other Hall or College any thing like that sum was paid he immediately set himself to rectify it made all the necessary proper enquiries then applied to the worthy Principal who felt the force of Mr Berkeley's reasonings and summoned the Provider of these costly slices of beef and mutton before him who declared meat not then at the frightful price it is now on Holy Thursday the th of May seven pence  per  pound  The great rich butcher of this place one day sent the Editor four pounds of beef steaks off the  neck  of the ox instead of its rump or rib as ordered by the Editor herself walking by his shop The youngest servants in her family when broiled could not make their teeth penetrate them but on paying the bill he would not abate of  eight  pence  per  pound This great Man is King of the place and once a week makes a pompous feast to all his numerous dependents Another butcher  attempted  setting up but the poor people say  "Ah but Muster ******* would not suffer it"  Most villages have a Tyrant it is generally the  baking  Mealman The Editor entirely approves of  one  King in a Kingdom but not of  petty  Kings for as a very sensible  sille de chambre  who waited on her the last time she visited France said  "  Pour moi Madame moi j'aime d'être gouverners par mes supérieurs pas par le canaille  "  The Editor and Madamoiselle Therese are quite  de même avis  No Wat Tyler no Jack Cade says she  it was quite impossible to furnish the dinners in the Hall cheaper without  ruining himself  Mr Berkeley being present said  "  That  would be a  cruelty  which he was sure the gentlemen of the Hall would be exceedingly sorry for"  Then turning to the Principal he told him  "that apprehending Mr  name forgotten by the Editor might object to the reduction he had applied to a person who would be very glad to supply the gentlemen every day with a good dinner at one shilling  per  head"  On hearing this the  honest  Provider begged  some time  to  consider  of it whether it would be  possible  for him to do it or not Mr Berkeley a pretty tolerable accomptant said  "The calculation would be easily made"  and requested the worthy Principal that it might not be long delayed as notwithstanding his father's generosity in giving him a large allowance he knew there were several gentlemen who felt the pressure of this heavy daily  sconce  very inconvenient to them as well as himself The  honest  man returned at the time appointed to the Principal's lodging Mr Berkeley by appointment being present when he said  "That although he should  lose  much by it yet as he  had  served the Hall he might have added  so well  he did not care to give it up and would accept the terms offered"  For this service every gentleman of the Hall acknowledged that they were indebted solely to the wisdom spirit and activity of Mr Berkeleyall complained  aloud  but he  alone  attempted to redress the grievance  The good Bishop of Norwich then Dean of Canterbury always coming at the two audits towards the end of June and November Dr and Mrs Berkeley used of course to enquire when their Son talked of visiting Canterbury to which that facetious witty as well as wise amiable man once replied  "Come hither I don't know that he can  come at all  "  Mrs B  "Not come at all What do you mean my dear Mr Dean"  Bp of Norwich  "Why I don't know how Magdalene Hall could go on without him The good Principal loves and admires him more I think than you do he talks more of him however and they have a poor unhappy gentleman  This sensible very accomplished gentleman was one of those mentioned as owing the preservation of his life to the great skill of Mr Satterley after every other surgeon had pronounced his wound incurable He recovered to bless God's great mercy and Mr Satterley's great skill He died a natural death a few months ago The Editor found amongst her Son's papers a most charming letter of this gentleman's to his kind friend Mr Berkeley  there who is more than a little deranged at times and nobody can do  any thing at all with him  as a gentleman of the Hall told me some time ago but Mr Berkeleyhe has a method of his  own  of soothing and quieting him and persuading him to do just as he wishes to the no small comfort of the Hall"  This accomplished gentleman of an ancient family had very nearly run through a large fortune in dissipation and alas vice He felt  too  pungently his  then  situation and contrasting it with what it might but for his own fault  have been  and the having involved in misery a very worthy lady it frequently dethroned his reason  The Editor when listening to the melancholy accounts sometimes related to her by her compassionate Son of this gentleman has thought of what the wits of that day said of the Bishop of Peterborough's  The very learned Dr White Kennet grandfather of the Reverend John and Thomas Newman both residing on their respective livings in Essex and of her excellent kind unwearied friend White Newman Esquire of Newgate Street The Editor wishes it were possible for her to do justice to the gratitude she feels for the incessant unwearied assistance she receives from that throughly worthy friend and his two obliging amiable sons Messrs White and Thomas Newman The very grateful father of Mr Newman knowing that his fatherinlaw the Bishop owed all his preferment to Mr Cherry and feeling himself under personal obligations to that excellent man from their youth charged his sons  "as they valued a father's blessing never to omit any opportunity that presented itself of rendering every possible service in their power to the descendants of Mr Cherry"  The Editor has frequent occasion to tell her amiable friends in Newgate Street that they are resolved to ensure their father and grandfather's blessing Were the Editor a Duchess instead of a poor disconsolate Widow or their Sister or Mother the attentions of the whole family could not be more polite amiable unremitting for which that God may reward them here and hereafter prays daily earnestly their obliged grateful friend It was formerly an invariable rule with all the Bishops to deal with Mr Newman's father  l'esprit de corps  Funeral Sermon on  the Duke of Devonshire  "That a man of sense could repent  more  in half an hour than a fool could in seven years"  In that sermon the Bishop says  "that the sensations of a man of superior understanding on seeing the error of his ways would be so much more pungently felt that it is an evil and  bitter  thing to depart from the LORD than one of less naturally strong less refined understanding could possibly do"  Some of Mr Berkeley's intimate friends used to say  "He knew how to manage  every  person of  every  description"  A very intimate beloved and respected friend of Mr Berkeley a very brilliant genius whose Elegy on the Death of Dr Johnson was universally allowed by all the great judges of poetry to be superior to any published on that occasionthis gentleman apt sometimes to be hipped had been some time a close prisoner in his chambers declaring to all his friends that he was  extremely ill  and in a  very bad way  On Mr Berkeley's arrival in town every common friend began lamenting the unpleasant situation of Mr  Mr Berkeley replied  "I suppose  he is  really very ill"    "No he ails nothing at all"    "Oh very well then I will cure him I promise you in a few minutes"  Off set Mr Berkeley from Harcourt Buildings to the King's Bench Walks On entering the usual enquiries of health being made a  numerous  list of  ideal  maladies were mentioned Mr Berkeley assuming a very  solemn countenance said  "My dear friend I am exceedingly grieved to find you so  very ill  To be sure you have sent for a lawyer and made your will as I know you do not mean your heir at law should enjoy your fine estate"    "  Made my  WILL my dear Berkeley  what do you mean  Made my will Why then  you  really think me  very ill  "    "To be sure I do  very dangerously ill  "    "God bless my soul  I am not ill  "    "Let you and I go to the Opera directly"  Up he sprang rang his bell told his servant that he must dress that minute for that he was going with Mr Berkeley to the Opera Accordingly Mr Berkeley escorted him thither in triumph to the great joy and no small diversion of his  numerous  friends for he is exceedingly amiable The next day in the Hall Mr Berkeley was complimented on his skill as a  physician  Another very ludicrous anecdote of Mr Berkeley's extricating the same friend from a disagreeable situation some time after this might be related It is certain that Mr Berkeley after he grew up a man never undertook the management of any difficult affair that he did not accomplish it to the satisfaction of all the parties concerned Not long after Mr Monck Berkeley's arrival at St Andrew's he went one afternoon to the shop of the to St Andrew's students wellknown Mungo Dick To his no small surprize it was shut up He knocked repeatedly at length a neighbour appeared and Mr Berkeley  enquired whether Mungo was broke and runaway  "No Sir he has locked himself in he is  bating his gewd weef  "    "A villian how dare he lock the door"    "He must Sir or the neighbours would  see  it  Mr Monck Berkeley used to be diverted by his Mother's saying  "She would have an  Irish lover  an  English husband  and a  Scotch cousin  "  The Irishmen of high fashion are exquisitely elegantly polite which is mighty pleasing during courtship the English in general if their wives comport themselves as they  ought  to do when under the  yoke  the  irrecoverable  words uttered at the altar in general good kind husbands with a  little  humouring and a  little  winking at The Editor often says  "To suppose that our grandfires were all angels on earth is a folly too great to be believed for a moment"  They were probably the best of them sometimes fractious sometimes drank too much and sometimes played them false as in  these  days but  here  lies the difference  our grandmothers  in  their  affliction applied for consolation and direction to some  reverend  pious AGED Divine who poured balm into their poor fretted spirits from God's Word applied by  their  wisdom in  our times  it is the fashion to apply to a smart Captain of the Guards or to some silly ignorant young Peer It were surely wise to  try  the old Doctor One  Scotch  cousin is worth fifty  English  ones as we see every day Dr Berkeley was very urgent with the late Lord Camden to obtain an appointment for a Scotchman for whom he had the goodness to be interested Lord Camden very politely and honestly  flatly  refused it in the following words  "I should rejoice to pay attention to Dr Berkeley and for any  Englishman I will do it  But I have many years ago sworn that I  never  will introduce a Scotchman into any office for if  you  introduce  one he  will contrive some way or other to introduce  forty  more cousins or friends"  Would James the First have acted by a  Scot  as good Queen Mary and Queen Anne did by a very worthy relation of theirs a Mr Holden who was many years clerk to old Mr Cherry the Counsellor He always dined at the second table died at Shottesbrooke House and lies interred in the church Queen Anne allowed his aged mother twenty pounds  per annum  and she went to Court once in the year in her new grey gown she was a widow and her Majesty always  spoke  kindly to her and called her Cousin HOLDEN The Queen was  not  a SCOT  "    "To be sure they would and prevent it a rascal to beat a woman"    "Aye Sir so men always lock their doors that nobody may ever  say  they have  seen  them  do it  "  Mr Berkeley called aloud and vowed vengeance if he did not leave off beating her Mr Berkeley went the next day and gave him  such  a  lecture  as prevented his chastizing her again during Mr Berkeley's  séjour  at St Andrew's On the Editor's asking her Son if he thought he would mind what such a youth as he could say Mr Berkeley replied very  seriously  "I  hope he  will for I made him heartily ashamed of himself"  At the age of nineteen Mr Berkeley had the honour of being elected a corresponding member of the Society of Antiquaries in Edinburgh in consequence of a very accurate sensible account transmitted to that Society of a curious quarry of marble discovered some years ago in the heart of the Highlands It had some curious particularities but of what nature they were the Editor does not recollect probably they were not understood by  her  although so excellently investigated and described by her Son She however means to present that Society with a valuable antique in her Son's collection  Mr Berkeley was a member of the Royal Archers and during the war in a number of Scotch gentlemen of rank and fashion formed themselves into a corps The Editor thinks they were styled The Royal Edinburgh Volunteers Mr Berkeley accepted a commission They were summoned once if not more to assist in quelling a riot the mob being employed in demolishing some mills when flour was little more than half its present price This occasioned a gentleman's asking Mr Berkeley if he had thoughts of going into the army on which he replied  "No Sir I am much indebted to the wisdom of my Father who would not suffer me to enter on a military or naval life when I was a boy leaving Eton There is but one thing  now  that can ever make a military man of me his Majesty's erecting his standard when I should feel it my bounden duty to repair to repair to it"  Mr Berkeley in the year visited the accidentally native country  Bp Berkeley's father was as well as all his ancestors born in England His grandfather as before mentioned expended a large fortune in the service of King Charles the First and in remitting money to King Charles the Second and his brothers The only return was making his son the Bishop's father collector of the port of  in Ireland a more respectable post than in England noblemen's sons often accepting it This occasioned the old gentleman's leaving his  malediction  on any descendant of his who should ever in  any way  assist  any  Monarch  of his renowned grandfather The attentions Mr Berkeley received in that kingdom from all ranks  and degrees must have been exceedingly flattering to any man less humble than Mr Berkeley who in a letter to his Mother speaks thus  "I am indebted to my grandfather for this honour  The Provost and Fellows of Dublin College did him the honour of conferring on him the degree of LLB an honour never before conferred on so young a man not educated in that University of which  great  favour Mr Berkeley and his Parents ever retained a most grateful sense The Survivor means to shew her sense of it in something more solid than words  I have little merit of my own  but I  am the grandson of Bishop  erkeley the representative of Archbishop Usher  Bp Berkeley was nephew to Archbishop Usher as was his cousingerman General Wolfe Mr Monck Berkeley when a very little child one day flew up stairs to his aunt burst into her room crying  "Oh Madam Miss Frinsham if you  will  have the goodness to lend me a shilling here is a man below with a  box at his back  that  says  he will shew  me  the death of  my own poor dear  cousin  Cardinal Wolsey  killed at Quebec fighting for  this  country"  When the fit of laughter brought on by this  philippic  ceased the purse was produced and the little man flew off in extacies  I hope I feel as I ought the honour conferred upon me and trust that although I cannot  equal  I shall  never disgrace  my famous ancestors"  That Mr Berkeley should meet with much attention in the hospitable polite kingdom of Ireland celebrated as well as her sister kingdom for pleasing conduct to strangers is not to be much wondered at his Father having the honour to be related to many of the noblesse of Ireland His  gratitude was great for the throughly amiable polite attentions of the excellent Marquis and Marchioness of Waterford His Parents felt it as it merited The survivor still feels it as she does the very worthy Lord John Beresford's amiability for so condescendingly interesting himself in her intricate affairs in Ireland She must ever retain the most grateful sense of the exquisitely polite condescension of the excellent Lady Isabella Monck the highly respected mother of the Marchioness ever since she had the honour of being connected with her Ladyship by her union with Dr Berkeley That excellent lady once taking leave of the Editor on her quitting England spoke as follows  "As I fear Madam that there is little chance of my ever having it in my power to pay you the respect that I wish to do in Ireland and that your very great attention to  all  Dr Berkeley's relations I am sure demands I beg that if ever you have any relation or friend that visits Dublin you will be pleased to let me know that I may at least have the pleasure of paying them the attentions that I should be happy to pay  you  there"  The Editor trusts that she felt this amiable conduct as it merited She availed herself of this goodness but once it is not to be supposed that she would introduce every country gentleman's daughter of her acquaintance who being smitten with a red coat followed the camp to Ireland when the sensible elegant Miss D'Oyley daughter  of the late Sir Thomas D'Oyley married Dr Newcombe then Bishop of Ossory the Editor wrote to her Ladyship requesting permission to introduce Mrs Newcombe who added to her great personal merits was descended from one of the most antient families in England On Mrs Newcombe's arrival in Dublin to the amazement of all the  ton  world of Dublin her Ladyship visiting very few persons but of her own family and connections and making  no new  acquaintances at all of any rank she immediately honoured Mrs Newcombe with a visit  The sensible Lady of the learned Bishop of Ossory soon learned enough of Dublin to know that to be visited by Lady Bell Monck was a greater honour than to be visited by the Viceroy's Lady a  rarer  honour than to be visited by the Lady she represents    The Editor had the pleasure of adding much  So much that Mrs Berkeley almost dreaded to see any of their common friends they being reiteratedly  charged  to repeat and rerepeat good Lady D'Oyley's most grateful acknowledgments  to the happiness of that excellent incomparable woman the late Lady D'Oyley whose whole life from the age of seventeen when she married the worthy Sir Thomas D'Oyley was one continued uninterrupted journey in the path of duty  On Miss D'Oyley's marrying into another Kingdom she said to an intimate friend of hers and the Editor's  "I have never lived for myself at all since I was seventeen years old"  the time of her marriage  She lived alas to lose the only child she ever had  The Editor visiting her not long before her death found her as ever resigned and cheerful much wishing Mrs Berkeley to see what  she wished  a strong resemblance between her fine little granddaughter about seven years old and her departed mother There certainly was a resemblance Miss Newcombe was handsomer than her elegant mother This young lady is lately married in Ireland and it is said means to prove her claim to what the Editor has always heard from her youth that her mother of course herself had an undoubted right to after the death of her two uncles Sir John and Sir William both dead childlessthe barony of Hook Norton in Oxfordshire as the late Lord Dacre used to say a clergyman on a small living in the vale of Berkshire whose name the Editor does not recollect had to that of Berners How much wiser are the Scots in many instances than the English every almanac has the list of dormant titles with this wise addition  "The representative of this family is  "  Surely this is very wise for an ancient hereditary title is certainly no  unpleasant  thing for  any  family to possess however Nabobs Slavemerchants and upstarts may AFFECT to deride it in  words  for in actions they do not being very fond of uniting their plebeian blood with noble The Editor will not say as Sir  said on a match made some time ago  "Oh he has I find taken a  Rag of Quality  "  The excellent Lady D'Oyley took great pains to make a very happy match for her eldest brother a very worthy gentleman of large fortune in the West of England with a very sensible most highly accomplished young Lady without any fortune This noble disinterested Lady lived to see the lovely the only offspring of that marriage the first lady of  Cresswell Esquire Member of Parliament for Cirencester left an orphan by the death of both parents before she was two years old a beloved friend of the Editor grow up adorned with every thing that could render an uncommonly fine wonderfully strong understanding cultivated to the height by her maternal aunt her  more  than mothershe had in fact been a more than mother to her halfsister the young lady's mother ten years younger than herselfthe excellent Mrs Woodford who died in April in very advanced age at the seat of her other niece the amiable worthy Lady Guise at Highnam Court in Gloucestershire full of days and full of piety The Editor laments that it is not in the power of her  feeble  pen to do justice to the very rare merits of this wonderfully wise accomplished excellent friend nor to her own great gratitude to her and to God for having put it into the heart of this excellent lady to attach herself to the Editor fifteen years younger than herself when a girl of ten years old She had however then sense enough to listen to the  wise  advice of this extraordinary lady as to an oracle of wisdom and prudence and continued to do so until she  bade her adieu for the last time in at Highnam Court trusting to meet again when the Editor hopes to be as wise as her ever respected beloved friend Her powers with regard to the education of young women were so highly esteemed by the Editor that she had conjured Dr Berkeley to promise her that should she die leaving a young daughter her highly respected friend Mrs Woodford might have the direction of her education rather than her own excellent Sister whose exquisite compassion for a motherless child would have caused her to humour such an one in every thing she wished and have  so  ensured a  miserable  life a  melancholy  death for her  The Editor is to this day sometimes reproached by her too tenderhearted Sister of not having  sufficiently humoured  her children She always delighted to gratify them in every thing proper and not injurious ever wishing to make her dog and cats happy Another female friend used to accuse the Editor of not treating her children like  rational  creatures  her  word being a  law  without assigning to  them  any reason why they were to go or not to goto stay or not to stay c to which the Editor's reply was  "ARE children of three to thirteen years old rational creatures"  That they have reason often  fine  strong reasonbut that does not imply that they are always rational creatures  vide  half the grown up children that one sees in the world She has however the delight of having  both  her children bear testimony to her  wisdom  in that instance her eldest particularly as has been mentioned elsewhere in this Preface The Editor's  horrors  of deceit and cunning made her always resolve that if ever she was blessed with children they should not be taught to tell lies as children are when bid to say  "  they do not know which they love best Papa or Mamma  "  Unless they are fools they must and do  very early know  and the Editor always ordered them to tell the truth boldly The youngest almost adored his dear Father who never contradicted him but humoured him as much as might be without destroying  "the  authority  of the Mother over the sons"  as speaks the Scripture which says  "God has confirmed the authority"  c He loved his Mother exceedingly One evening coming in from play he sprung into her lap threw his arms round her neck and began caressing her she said  "Robert tell me whom you love best in the world"  "Why  you  Stop Mamma as a child whilst one  is  a  child  it is  natural  to love those best that humour one and spoil one a  little  so I love Papa best  But  if I should live to be a  man  I shall then love you a  vast  deal the best for having never humoured me or spoiled me at all"  This is set down  verbatim  as if delivered upon oath    Last year a very short time before the death of this revered friend the Editor had the real pleasure to become acquainted under the throughly hospitable roof of her very excellent amiable kind old friends the very learned sensible Recorder of Canterbury and his sensible worthy Lady with the amiable very highly cultivated and accomplished Miss G  l  d neice of Mrs Robinson to whom the Editor has been much indebted for introducing her to the knowledge of a very worthy man who has been of great service to her in some of her difficult unpleasant busineses This young lady one day asked Mrs Berkeley  "if  she  was not acquainted with Mrs Woodford"  The Editor replied that  "she had that felicity very early in life and esteemed it one of the numberless gracious vouchsafements of PROVIDENCE having owed to that dear friend's wise pious advice that together with many other things she had frequently escaped the most unpleasing of  all  reproach  selfreproach  by having early in life left entirely to the Allwise Disposer of events every concern of  real  importance  never to pray or wish anxiously that events might turn out to one's own wish  "  This excellent lady would frequently say  "Behold me a monument of the  folly  of anxiously wishing praying for any thing of presuming to carve for ourselves I besought God at different times when young to vouchsafe to grant me three requests"  All were grantedand they have every one brought on me such distress as I hope all my young friends taking warning by me may escape  Perhaps the greatest fortune in England never had more lovers more offers of marriage than this excellent Lady The Editor knew some of the gentlemen wise enough to persevere  very  long but all in vain The lady of the late Mr Granger of Shiplake author of the Biographical History the Editor has heard her Mother say  "it was supposed for very many years of her life she never passed a  whole month  without receiving an offer of marriage"  She was an exquisite beauty not so dear Mrs Woodford hers were chiefly  mental  charms    Miss G  l  d by some accidental meeting had the happiness such she professed to esteem it to become acquainted with Mrs Woodford late in her journey towards the realms of bliss Her wonderful powers of mind appeared as strong as ever the last time the Editor saw her but her earthly tabernacle was debilitated most lamentably indeed For the present adieu thou beloved thou revered thou excellent Friend May at least one bright jewel be  added to thy crown of glory for the benefits received from thee by thy throughly grateful affectionate friend c ELIZA BERKELEY  On Dean Swift's introducing Mr afterwards Bp Berkeley to the then Earl of Berkeley it was in this singular way  "My Lord here is a fine young gentleman of your family I can assure your Lordship it is a much greater honour to  you  to be related to him than it is to him to be related to you"  The Earl of Berkeley was then Lord High Admiral of England the last nobleman who had that honour which some of his descendants pleaded as the cause of their great pridesome of the uncommonly sensible grandsons of the Honourable Colonel Berkeley A person whose name was not originally Berkeley one day talking to one of the most amiable of those brothers said  "My dear C  what is the cause that  you  BERKELEYS are so  diabolically  proud Is it because for its great antiquity no noble family in  England  has had quite so many h  ts and s  ls in it"    "No my dear Madam no it is because we are so horridly poor We are afraid of being trampled upon"    "Never fear that my dear C  no man of so ancient so noble a family as yours has cause for such apprehension from persons of sense if it is not  his own  fault"  St Paul speaking by the Holy Spirit to Timothy says  "  Let no man despise thee  "  It is therefore  absolutely  in our own power to prevent our being  despised  It is one thing to dislike to  hate  and another to  despise  The inspired Writer therefore does not say  "let no man hate thee or persecute"  but  "let no man  despise  thee"  is a command given from an aged to a young Bishop There are countries where perhaps the younger Prelates might so admonish the elders to their profit To the admonisher of Mr C Berkeley when saying that no persons of  sense  would despise him c might had he known it have retorted the famous Dr Rock's answer to Sir Edward Holse Physician to his late Majesty who driving one day down the Strand was stopped by the mob listening to the oratory of Dr Rock in his gaudy equipage Seeing Sir Edward Hulse look out at his chariot window he instantly took a quantity of boxes and vials gave them to one of his  belaced  lacqueys saying  "Give my compliments to Sir Edward tell him these are all I have with me but I will send him ten dozen more tomorrow"  Sir Edward astonished at the message and effrontery of the man actually took them into his chariot on which the mob with one consent all cried out  "See see all the Doctors even the King's  buy  their medicines of him"  In their youth they had somewhere been fellow students Rock not succeeding in a regular way metamorphosed himself into a  Quack  In the afternoon he waited on Sir Edward to beg his pardon for having played him such a trick to which Sir Edward replied  "My old friend how can a man of your understanding condescend to harangue  the populace with such nonsense as you talked today Why none but fools listen to you"    "Ah my good friend  that  is the  very thing  Do you give  me  the FOOLS for  my  patients and you shall have  my free leave  to  keep  the people of SENSE for  your own  "  This anecdote of these two different Doctors was related to the Editor by a medical friend of great eminence who had often heard Sir Edward Hulse relate it to divert his friends adding  "I never felt so like a fool in my life as when I received the bottles and boxes from Rock"  Mr Berkeley felt himself much indebted for numberless polite amiable attentions from Lord Durraghmore for which he was probably indebted entirely to his  own personal  merit and the great good sense of that young Nobleman to whom should he chance to read this it may not perhaps be unpleasant to observe what Mr Berkeley's Father once said to the Editor on her saying  "How very lucky Berkeley is in becoming acquainted with so many learned men so much his superiors in years and knowledge"    "Lucky to be sure he is  lucky  if you  call it so  in having an understanding that  must  make him admired by those who have very superior understandings themselves  that  is the  luck  of it"  They did not perhaps as Mr Berkeley who having dined out in a large company at his return asked his Mother if she was acquainted with a young Baronet  whom he named she replied  "Yes that she had known his mother very well"  Mr B  "  I  am resolved to become acquainted with him"  Mrs B  "Why"  Mr B  "Because two of the most empty foxhunting coxcombs I ever met with have been laughing at and abusing him to the company all the afternoon so  I conclude  he is a man of sense and worth"  Mr Berkeley also felt himself much obliged as the Editor does by the very polite friendly attentions of his Father's Honourable relation Sackville Hamilton Esquire of Dublin Castle He felt himself flattered by the attentions of the learned Reverend William Hamilton BD who presented to him his very curious entertaining work printed during Mr Berkeley's residence in Ireland In his return from Ireland by the way of Scotland he made some little stay with his amiable old intimate friend Sir William Morres at his seat in the county of  name forgotten He could not contrive to reach the house of his learned friend Mr Taylor of Noan Several translations from the Greek Poets of this gentleman's were published when he was about nineteen  In a letter to his Father whilst in Ireland he says  "My Grandfather and Swift are still remembered with gratitude in this kingdom by some their memory is venerated as they merited"  Mr Berkeley having been always told by his Father that Dean Swift was the introducer of his Grandfather when he came young into England to the learned and the great occasioned his from a boy being a great admirer of that wonderful man and his so zealously labouring to vindicate his fame in the Preface to his Literary Relics from some horridly false aspersions and palliating his  sad  conduct to Stella and Vanessa  Unless it is allowed what the Editor herself  firmly  believes from what she learned from Dr Berkeley's very old beloved friend Dean Delanythat both Dean Swift and Mrs Johnson were actually the children of Sir William Temple and the heavy tidings arrived not until the day on which the indissoluble knot was tied Surely a  Spiritual  Court ought to have power to set such unfortunate persons at liberty Some years ago the eldest son of a gentleman of great estate was exceedingly in love with an heiress of large fortune the father threw cold water on itthe old gentleman persisted in refusing to give his consentat length violently urged by his son to find an objection to an accomplished beautiful rich heiress he replied  "You d  d fool the world is wide enough for you to find a wife without marrying your own sister that young lady is my daughter therefore give up all thoughts of her"  He did so and married another lady The beloved object for ever gone Miss  married the first man of large fortune that her parents recommended to her but the loss of her first accomplished lover gave an unfortunate shock to her fine understanding She early in life became a widow The last time the Editor saw her there appeared a sort of melancholy restlessness that could not fail to distress every feeling heart that knew the cause This lady had every thing  this  world could furnish to produce happiness two fine children a son and daughter both magnificently provided for But she had not the society of the only man on earth whom she could love She saw him happy with another Had she learned to  feel  as well as say  "Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven"  it had been happy for her had she humbly patiently submitted instead of sadly murmuring and sadly cavilling as she used alass to do at some parts of Scripture But what piety was it likely should be instilled into her mind by her  direfully  ADULTEROUS MOTHER who was not suspected until this affair of the match  Mr Berkeley was not in England  when that book was published but a copy by his order to his bookseller was sent to every member of his family On his arrival in England he immediately paid his duty at his Father's and after dinner one day said to his Mother that he hoped she had received the Literary Relics which he had ordered to be sent to her before they were published  She replied  "that she was much obliged by his attention"  Mr B  "Have you redde them my dear Madam"  Mrs B  "To be sure I have my dear Child"  Mr B  "Well and what do you think of my account of Swift"  Mrs Berkeley with what her Son used to term  "one of  my Mother's wicked  looks"  replied  "My dear Son it has  determined me  if ever I should have a  desperately bad  cause to plead to retain  you  for my Prime Counsel"  To which Mr Berkeley in a sweet melancholy voice replied  "Ah my dear Mother don't say so I have not defended his wrong conduct I have only said all that my conscience would suffer me to say in extenuation of it You know his kindness to my Grandfather in his youth when he came first to England It grieves me that you say that  I  should be your Prime Counsel"  Mr Berkeley shewed his gratitude in another instance to Dean Swift During his short  séjour  in Dublin he discovered that the old servant Mr Richard Brinan in whose arms Dean Swift expired was poor as well as aged he relieved him and ordered his Father's agent to pay him a small sum every month to lighten the  unavoidable  sufferings of old age which  needs  not the aid of POVERTY to render it unpleasant Dr Berkeley continued this annuity as does the Editor at least she trusts that the poor man receives it as she sees it constantly in her accounts she hopes for his sake it is not as difficult to get a small sum paid  in  Ireland as it is to get  any  sum out of it  It has perhaps been before mentioned that Mr Berkeley resembled his unworthy  Mother  in never forgetting a favour received and his lovely  self  in  never  remembering an injury done to himself Any done to his Father he would not pardon as too plainly appeared in his "Siege of Rhodes"  which the Editor never saw until it was printed or she had certainly made it a point with her obedient Son as in another instance where only themselves were concerned not many months before his death saying  "Here I stand my dear Madam ready to obey whatever you shall be pleased to command"  The  of  had certainly treated Dr Berkeley like a  and Mr Berkeley ever now and then threatened him Dr Berkeley used to say  "The man that can act as he has done is beneath your notice do not soil your paper with such a  "  Mrs Berkeley begged him off on account of his worthy family with whom in her youth she had been acquainted Mr Berkeley used to say  "No man shall maltreat my Father whilst I can hold a pen any more than asperse my Mother's fame whilst I wear a sword"  Mr Berkeley used laughingly to tell a very intimate friend of his  "You are so apt to boast of being  will with the ladies of all ages and all descriptions  that I am sure the  only  thing that prevents your hinting that  my Mother is partial to you is that you know  I would run you through the body immediately"  Had Mr Berkeley lived to read the grateful mention of his Father in the  curious  life of Bishop Horne he had certainly resented it as it merits to be resented Dr Berkeley was a too generous friend to numbers whose present pride and covetousness has quite obliterated from their minds the poverty from which the amiable generosity of Dr Berkeley long since rescued them  HE is gone to receive his reward THEY must in due time follow to receive theirs  It has been mentioned that Mr Berkeley in his first nove "The Generous Rustic" has shewn his love and gratitude to the French friends of his early youth In his second "The Spanish Memoirs" many of the characters are the real ones of English and Scotch friends and acquaintance In that of Father Alberto the reader is made acquainted with the very sensible highly accomplished wonderfully entertaining polite pious Bishop Geddes who had spent many years as a Bishop in New Spain and has often delighted the Editor when visiting at Dr Berkeley's with accounts of the wonderfully affectionate respectful attachment the amiable Peruvians still retain for their Inca and his royal progeny supplying him with fish venison game c and the stratagems the Spaniards were obliged to employ to convey the then Inca from New to Old Spain where he is a grandee His two sons hold considerable rank in the King of Spain's guards they are fine young men although one draws a sigh over their reversed fortune They are perhaps happier to  guard  than to be  guarded  The Editor has often listened with delight to accounts of conversations related to have passed between the Inca and himself  tête à tête  in old Spain al hough the Inca is not a man of very shining abilities perhaps for politic reasons very little  cultivated He was not dead to what he was nor to what he ought to have been  This excellently wise mild Prelate by the great wisdom of the then Pontiff replaced the  flaming  Popish Bishop who presided over the Roman Catholics of Edinburgh when the zeal of John Knox's disciples burned down the chapel to the great distress of the amiable liberal Dr Robertson the worthy witty Dr Webster father of the excellent Colonel Webster the agreeable Dr Carlyle and many other worthy Scottish ministers of Edinburgh On that occasion the zealots of the party exhibited a caricature print of which the Editor has a copy of Dr Johnson's beloved "  Willy Robertson  " with the triple crown on his head a label c c May that sensible agreeable head be now more suitably crowned  Mr Berkeley's superiority of understanding led him to feel great gratitude for Bishop Goddes's devoting so much of his time to Mr Berkeley when in Edinburgh in vacation time He felt that it was condescension in a very learned man of between fifty and sixty to say to a youth of nineteen  "Whenever you please Sir visit me at all times I shall be most happy to see you to give you any information you may wish that I am capable of affording"  The Editor is aware that persons may say  "Oh that was to  make a Papist of him  Mr Berkeley was early in life made by his mother to read most of what has been well written  pro  and  con  in that controversy between the Church of England and the Church of Rome At before ninetten Mr Berkeley was a zealous Protestant not because his grandmother was oneto be sure he had like Timothy  "from a child  known  the Scriptures"  which  poor oldfashioned  St Paul thought and said  "were able to make him wise unto salvation"  See St Paul's Third Epistle to Timothy chap iii verse  "  Bishop Geddes very soon discovered before he had ever seen Mr Berkeley only an anonymous piece of his without the least clue to find out the Writer  "This is written by a  very uncommon  genius indeed be he whom he may"  The Duke D'Arundina Mr Berkeley told the Editor was the late Earl of  whom Mr Berkeley never forgave for turning his own unfortunate nephew his brother's son from his door The amiable Miss  daughter of Lord  told Mr Monck Berkeley that the poor unfortunate young gentleman's father was at Lord  's when his  only  son was chased from the door The Editor hopes that the young Lady had been misinformed as he was an highly respected friend of Dr Berkeley and the Editor Alas alas that parents would consider in their anger against their perhaps illeducated offspring how will this action appear to me when I come to lie on my deathbed God himself says  "Oh that they were wise that they would consider their latter end"  But most so far from considering it banish it from their mind lest it should make them melancholy This illfated young gentleman reached a wretched alehouse  in Northumberland and there ended his miserable mortal pilgrimage There is a day coming ere long when the Editor thinks she would of the two rather choose to be the poor very weak shatterbrained nephew than the sensible solemn pompous uncle who is well characterized in the person of the Spanish  Don  Duke Oh that parents and near relatives whom God has blessed with understanding had some compassion on those to whom he has not been so gracious and consider that there are very many who want guardians through life and the father and mother of a shatterbrained man or simple daughter should look out for a proper guardian in a wise husband or wife like the late Mrs  of  who soon after the death of her excellent husband said to her very uncommonly sensible daughter a very old friend of the Editor  "We must now cast our thoughts about for some very sensible young lady of small fortune who will take your brother or else before we have left  six weeks either the cook or the dairy maid whichever has most cunning will marry him"  The plan was pursued He lived some years a very happy respectable life with one of the sensible daughters of the worthy Sir  Bart His son does not squander the  six thousand pounds per annum  which the wisdom of his grandmother esteemed a stingy woman because she paid her bills regularly rescued from  Molly Dairy  and entrusted to the wise management of Miss    The unfortunate young man driven from the door was once very desirous to have married the daughter of a clergyman a Dignitary of the Church of  well educated but no great fortune The joy of his mother on its being prevented was so great as to occasion Dr Berkeley's calling her FOOL and saying she would live to repent it It is hoped she did for she must meet her injured son at the last great day  Mention has been made before of Mr Berkeley's being sent when he was little more than six years old to town to get a tooth inspected by that very honest dentist the late Mr Hemmet who happened to be out of town The amiable friend who took the charge of him said  "Well we will go to Mr Beardmore or some other eminent man"  To which Mr Berkeley replied  "No Sir if you please I will go to no other for I heard my Mamma tell you that Hemmet was the best  and I am sure  SHE knows and I will go to him"  This occasioned his being detained a few days longer in town and his wise kind host fearing that a child who lived all day in the open air might suffer in town sent him every day to walk in the Park with his own worthy careful valet de chambre This man happening to be intimate with the gentleman of the late excellent Lord Berkeley of Stratton one day in returning from the Park called in Berkeley Square with Mr Berkeley in his hand who of course  went into the steward's or housekeeper's room where his sweetly engaging manners soon so won the hearts of all present that they asked his kind guardian permission to lead him up to shew him to Lord Berkeley and the excellent Mrs Anne Egerton He was introduced as the little grandson of the great Bishop Berkeley His noble relation was charmed with the great good sense and propriety of the little man and after he had been there a short time his sensible guardian telling him it was time to go home he rose made a very graceful bow  Dr Berkeley followed the example of his learned Father who from the time that his Sons put on the habits of men used after dinner to make them practise over and over coming in and going out of a room gracefully saying  "Every man and woman you see is a judge of those things therefore learn to do it like gentlemen"  Dr Berkeley and his son were both very apt scholars and it has been repeatedly remarked to the Editor how very gracefully both Dr and Mr Berkeley came into a room as if they had both learned of the same dancingmaster They had in fact learnt of the same master the learned Prelate who was remarkably attentive to the  minutiae  with his Sons as well as to their Latin Greek and letterwriting always saying  "Learn to write letters properly on all occasions Many people may hear your letters redde that will never hear you speak  vivâ voce  "  When Dr Berkeley was a boy about eight years old he worried his Father to let him go out with him to some Visitation for three or four days The good Prelate not understanding with all his learning the management of boys as well as his Grandson's Mother and having no mind his little Boy should accompany him said  "Well if in these two days you can make me eight Latin verses the Editor thinks it was you shall go with me"  be it what it might the Prelate knew or thought he knew that the poor child  could not  do it Dr Berkeley has often told the Editor that it was what he had never done had never been taught to do but wild to go this journey he set his astonishingly quick wits to work and produced the eight lines or verses in due time On his presenting them the Bishop exclaimed  "Well George you have been too many for me I did not think it possible you could have done it but as you have done it I must keep my word and so you must go"  The Editor used to tell Dr Berkeley that "  she  was angry with the Bishop for being such an Aegyptian taskmaster to a  poor  little creature for no mortal in the house could assist him but his father Why could he not have at once taken the beautiful little creature or told him that he  "  must not go  "  Dr Berkeley was esteemed the most elegant writer of Latin of any of his contemporaries at the University as the Editor has repeatedly heard Messrs Hamilton Whitaker Bishop Horne say Some excellent aged scholar name not recollected said to every one that Dr Berkeley's Latin speech when he was Collector was the best he had ever heard during his twenty years residence at the University  to the Lady and then  to my Lord who untying his purse was presenting him with five guineas to buy him a fine horse saddle c at the toyshop Mr Berkeley having told him that he had a  live  horse at Cookham His worthy guardian stepped up saying  "I must beg your Lordship to excuse Master Berkeley He must not take it His Mamma never suffers him to take a guinea or a sixpence from  my  Master when staying there for months not even from his Grandmother or his Aunt telling him how  shamefully mean  it is to accept money from any one but his  own  Parents when they are at hand"  This injunction was withdrawn when Mr Berkeley went to Eton near an hundred miles from his Father's house that then if any old friend of his family called and  tipped  him a guinea or two he might accept it as his Father and Mother had often  tipped  the sons of their friends He then declined it telling  his Mother  "I don't like it  somehow  not having been used to it and John Hayes his amiable relation is a goodnatured fellow and will always lend me a guinea whenever I ask him till I see my Father or John"  A Gentleman once expressed his astonishment to Dr Berkeley that calling at Eton to see Mr Berkeley he could not persuade him to accept money  Mrs Berkeley having always a dread of her children's being led to practise  any  meanness of  any  kind never suffered either of them to receive  any  sum small or great from  any  one but Dr Berkeley or herself from either Parent they were at  full  liberty to receive as much as ever their  eloquence  could  extract  The Editor from early youth always declared  "However well she might like a  smart  cap or elegant gown that she would much rather wear an old gown and a rusty cloak as she does at present than not pay the butcher baker c every Monday morning"  The doing that in these  blessed times  of  plenty  is hardly sufficient and such is the shameful selfish covetousness of most English traders in that class that they make those pay to the full as much for their commodities who pay every  seventh  day as those who do or do  not  pay after  seven  years credit In Scotland the traders although in general the rudest in the world excepting the Dutch if you pay ready money twenty pounds or thirty pence they always throw you back a considerable discount  as did always the late Mr Goodchild the great linendraper at Charing Cross The Editor when buying at St Andrews even a common chequered apron for  "a  pure auld gewd weef  "  value half a crown has repeatedly had three halfpenny worth of white silk nicely folded in paper presented to her by the very worthy really respectable Dean of Guild Kaye the first shop in St Andrews saying  "Be pleased Madam to take your discount I will not burden you with halfpence"  He had been long enough in England to learn the civility of our traders not long enough to learn their cunning of making those who do pay pay for those who do not Whilst Dr Berkeley's family was at St Andrews they were told by several of their neighbours that a certain Earl who has a mansion near Perth one day walked in and purchased half a guinea's worth of tea and sugar laid down the money on the counter which the grocer took and put into the till The Earl asked  "  Where is my discount  "    " Oh my Lord I thought your Lordship had lived so much in England that you would not take it"    "NOT TAKE IT I have not lived long enough in England to learn their FOOLISH customs"  This nobleman is remarkable for a strong understanding was educated at Westminster and Christ Church College Oxford and being a most able speaker in the House would do the  honest  part of English gentry and traders an essential service if he could introduce this wise Scottish custom South of the Tweed The Editor has one Scottish friend who resides  much in England who constantly when he purchases any thing puts the cash or notes in a paper writes on it what it is to pay and constantly keeps it in his desk twelve months because the English traders will not allow him discount saying  "that they are a set of rascals for not doing it"  After Mr Berkeley grew up some one speaking highly and justly as he deserved of Lord Berkeley of Stratton Mr Monck Berkeley said  "I am sure he was a goodnatured man he would once have made me the  happiest of mortals but for my Mother  "    "How so"  Mr Berkeley then mentioned what has been related above  On which Mrs Berkeley said  "Bless me my dear child do  you  remember that"  Mr B  "  Remember  it my dear Madam why I never felt such happiness before nor ever expect it again on  earth  as the  half  minute that the five guineas were  chinking in my paw  until Mr  the name of Mr Johnson's valet forgotten told me that I must give them back to my Lord for that you never suffered me c"  as before mentioned  "I had in  idea  purchased half the globe with those five guineas Lord Berkeley said I was the grandson of a great good man  Lord Berkeley of Stratton and Bishop Berkeley were extremely intimate in their youth Doctor Berkeley had vast numbers of Lord Berkeley's letters to his father A very unhappy event in Lord Berkeley's life when a young man occasioned  all  his  own  relations breaking all intercourse  all  connection with him whilst wonderful to relate those of his unfortunate illfated lady pardoned it One of her near relations resided entirely with him for many years before his death the very worthy Mrs A Egerton to whom he shewed his gratitude at his death This lady resided some years at FrogmoreHouse where Mr Monck Berkeley whilst an Etonian and his very  wonderfully  sensible clever acute friend Mr Kirk nephew of Colonel Egerton's Lady always found a most cordial reception of which Mr Berkeley often spoke with gratitude Lord Berkeley's life very many years before his death had been not only exemplary but exaltedly pious The Editor will take leave to relate an anecdote of his Lordship and the Princess Amelia Mrs Berkeley happening to be staying at Lambeth Palace when Archbishop Secker related it to the late amiable Bishop Trevor of Durham it made so deep an impression that she can set it down verbatimBishop of Durham  "I cannot conceive what is come to Princess Emely lately people don't usually grow  better  tempered as they grow old but from having been all her life the  the blanks must be filled up by those who read she is become so humble so affable so condescending so kind and charitable her Royal Highness used frequently to send Dr Berkeley ten guineas with a request that he would distribute it as he thought best amongst the poor of his parish of Acton that it delights one to hear it every body wonders but nobody can tell what has caused this astonishing change"  Every one at the table professed themselves glad and contrasted it with her Royal Highness's conduct when Ranger of Richmond Park and the odious stiles erected to deter persons from crossing it The Archbishop in his usual deliberate manner and in his wonted deliberate tone of voice said  "I can inform your Lordship what it is that has wrought this wonderful this  very happy  change in her Royal Highness's manners and conduct You know that my Lord Berkeley of Stratton is always one of her Royal Highness's select partyOne day she told him she found that she grew old and she wished his Lordship would recommend some good book to her to read to make her better His Lordship bowed and said 'he would endeavour to find one to suit her Royal Highness' According the next time he went to Gunnersbury House he took a large folio in his coach and carrying it in under his arm presented it to her Royal Highness saying 'that he had obeyed her Royal Highness's commands and had brought her a book that he hoped and believed she would like' Her Royal Highness  did like it  has redde it and studied it and that my  good  Lord is the cause of this  happy  change in her Royal Highness that  every body  is so wondering at"  The Princess soon fell in love with the Prelate which may many that are neither Princesses nor Peeresses do who may chance on running their eye over this Preface to read and study that  divine  writer the delight of the Editor's spirit that  true Church of England  Prelate is ardently wished by the writer of these poor pageswho if she is the humble instrument in the hand of Providence of consoling  one  poor humble contrite penitent male or female or benefiting  one  soul is content to be derided as  "an old fool"  a most MONSTROUS  ridiculous  creature The Editor inserts  female  as they never were  formerly  forgiven by the world although now we see some much caressed seldom think of applying to HIM who forgives and upbraids not  but that delighted  me not like the guineas chinking in my hand"  Mr Berkeley as well as his parents had a most affectionate regard for his eminently worthy agreeable respectable and it may with the strictest truth be asserted  universally  respected  relation Major James Berkeley one of the grandsons of the Honourable Colonel Berkeley whom on his  dreary  journey from Dover to Cheltenham he was sadly disappointed at not finding at Rochester he being then in barracks at Chatham now alas abroad in a situation of great danger May God in mercy spare that best of sons and brothers to his worthy mother elegant sister and to his idolizing beautiful accomplished lady  May their son if he lives to grow up be  if an officer  as wise and worthy as his father and as valiant as his mother's illustrious ancestor  "  valiant John Talbot  Mrs James Berkeley is a sister of  Talbot Esquire of Stone Castle an old intimate friend of Mr Monck Berkeley's This worthy young gentleman is also indebted for an appointment under Government to the gratititude of Lord Thurlow Oh that  all  grateful persons were compassionate But they would then be Angels and soon removed to the Celestial Choir  "  Proceeding on the road between Rochester and Dartford a postchaise drove most furiously by the coach Mr Berkeley's quick eye saw it and said to Mrs Frinsham  "There goes dear James and his lovely lady I wish to speak to him"  His servant on horseback endeavoured to overtake and stop them but in vain for they outstripped the wind He was affected as he wished exceedingly to bid a  last  adieu to his sincerely beloved respected kinsman  Major Berkeley has a younger brother a very uncommonly sensible man in mind not person a genuine Berkeley On the famous th of July every man between himself and the Earldom of Berkeley were engaged in  actual  service The Honourable George Berkeley only brother of Lord Berkeley Captain Velters Cornwall Berkeley of the Navy Major Lionel Berkeley and Major James above named Should Mr George Berkeley marry a Lady with a mind like his own their offspring may discover what is  transacting  in the stars discovered by Dr Herschel  Mr George Berkeley has as the Editor used to tell Dr Berkeley and her Sonthey had eyes that could see an insect a mile off A learned friend of the Editor not shortsighted used to say of his Lady  "  She  can see a  crow  upon a churchsteeple when I cannot see the  steeple  "  It must surely be very pleasant to be blessed with such eyes The Editor was always anxious to find out when infants whether her children had their dear Father's fine eyes or their mother's Both could like Mr George Berkeley and their Father see the mountains in the moon  This very sensible young Divine once when staying at Dr Berkeley's the Editor seeing him very careless of his health said to him  "If you don't take more care of yourself Berkeley will come to the title at  last  "  He briskly replied  "Surely I think there are enough of  us  to keep your son from it"  The Editor well remembers to have frequently heard her very sensible agreeable intimate friend Mrs Jones sister to the present highly worthy excellent Marquis of Winchester say that  "When he was a little boy of five or six years old and intimate friend of his mother used to say stroking his head 'Aye my dear George this little white head of thine will one day wear a coronet I am old and shall not live to see it but  I promise thee  thou wilt one day be Marquis of Winchester"  The present HONOUR to that very ancient title was then the  seventh  from it The manner in which his Lady's  wise  father recommended it to her with her vast fortune to marry Mr George Pawlett then a younger brother does him more honour than even his very ancient title promised to him by the old lady In this instance it can hardly be urged that prescience is unpleasant for a coronet if honourably obtained is no  unpleasant  prediction Yet how merciful is God in hiding from his creatures the FUTURE unless  by foreseeing  we could  prevent  How gracious was God in the year and several subsequent years in concealing from the unworthy writer of these pages she then spending from the beginning of May to the end of September at Cheltenham on account of her dear sister's health by no means in a dangerous state which must have prevented her enjoying balls parties chad it been made known to her that in the year and she should pass as many months of  extreme  anguish of spirit and at length lose an  only  child one of the finest young men in England it  would it must  have totally destroyed her innocent mirth and  gaieté de coeur  enjoyed there above thirty years beforeThe Honourable Mr Finch great uncle to the present Lord Aylesford being told by a fortuneteller that he would die by means of a grey horse occasioned his living  twentyfive  years in  miserable anxiety  but did  not  prevent his being killed the twentysixth  by a grey horse  in a very remarkably odd way as some West Kent gentlemen have related it to the Editor  Mrs Berkeley takes this opportunity of returning her grateful acknowledgements to many amiable acquaintances at Cheltenham at the time of Dr Berkeley's long confinement after the extreme danger of his illness before mentioned was over who used obligingly to give up the rooms and afford him the pleasure of their pleasing society the very agreeable Miss Nevilles the worthy Mrs André mother of the amiable unfortunate Major André and the delightfully sensible highly cultivated Miss Andrés the wonderfully wellinformed pious Mrs Wells of Cheltenham the Editor's old friend the very amiable worthy Mr De la Bere the worthy Mr Llewelwyn Mr Fitzgerald the sensible agreeable son of an old friend of Dr Berkeley's and his very learned brotherinlaw's old friend Mrs Boswell sister of Lord Bellamont and the highly accomplished agreeable Miss Boswells  After Mr Monck Berkeley's arrival at Cheltenham little society could be kept up but the attentions of the worthy Captain Abbot and his Lady at the next door to prevent extraordinary noise in the house or court are gratefully remembered and the unwearied polite tender attentions during Mr Berkeley's short life and the polite tender attentions after his lamented decease of the very learned accomplished Mr Dunster and his elegant lady were most gratefully felt by Dr Berkeley and will be for ever registered in the retentive memory of the Editor  It has been mentioned that Mr Berkeley never went out but twice at Cheltenham he had therefore never the pleasure of conversing with Mr Dunster which he lamented for he was a great admirer of his writings  Some days after Mr Berkeley's arrival at Cheltenham he one day said  "Who is this Mr Dunster that you all seem to like so much"  On being told he exclaimed  "Mercy on me is it  that  Mr Dunster indeed that you have  got here  "  So saying he rang his bell took out his key and ordered his servant to bring down his poems all then written out fair for the press When the book came down he desired the Editor to carry it  immediately  to Mr Dunster with the following message  "His compliments that he had sent the manuscript volume for Mr Dunster to peruse on this  sole  condition that he would  sans cérémonie  mark whatever he thought might be amended"  Mrs Berkeley saying she would get her hat and cloak he said  "Best of mothers pray go as you are  you know very well  that you  race  all over the garden at Cookham and down the Southcote Walk to give your orders to the gardener and do not catch cold and this is only three doors"    "But the people  here will think me mad  "    "If they do it will be  because  they are fools Best of mothers go  for fear  Mr Dunster should be gone out"  The Editor  obeyed  apologizing to her polite friend pleading her son's  carnestness  to learn  his  strictures They were reddewere much admiredand Mr Dunster declared that there was not  any  thing that could be altered for the better    de la Bere Esquire father of Mr De la Bere died only a very few days before Mr Berkeley who felt very sensibly the amiable delicacy of Mr De la Bere in ordering only a few strokes of the knell lest it should affect Mr Berkeley Alas it affected his relations more than himself He constantly enquired every day what account had been received of Mr De la Bere and one day said  "I wonder which of us God will call first"  He was through Redeeming Mercy as before mentioned prepared for that journey that ALL must sooner or later take May ALL who read take the advice of our adored REDEEMER  "  Be ye therefore ready  "  c The invalids in the elegant houses in St George's Place are considerably incommoded by the ringing of bells a considerable time before service begins on Sunday morning  When Mr Berkeley passed a bad night and could have slept in the morning the noise so very near prevented it Dr Berkeley sent to the exceedingly obliging Mr Edwards one of the churchwardens to request that they might ring less time He most politely sent word that he would take care that no bell should move through the week only just one bell toll five minutes before service began  Mr Berkeley felt so much gratitude for this favour so amiably conferred that he desired Mrs Berkeley would call on Mr Edwards and return him his best thanks  Dr Berkeley  "I have sent a message of thanks to Mr Edwards"  Mr B  "A message my dear Sir No I beg that my dear Mother will go herself She will say what a message or card cannot say  She  will express what  I feel  I therefore intreat that she will go"  Accordingly to gratify the amiable heart of her dear Son Mrs Berkeley went immediately and endeavoured to express to the worthy Mr Edwards how sensibly Mr Berkeley and his parents felt his kind amiability  Mr Edwards the winemerchant had been many years gentleman to Bishop Johnson of Worcester whose angelic gratitude to the relict and daughter of his earliest friend when reduced to poverty can never be forgotten by any who have heard it and to which he by God's appointment owed his wonderful rise in the Church  The excellent Lady Heskett's delightful society and improving pious conversation assisted the Editor much in drawing off her mind from  incessant  meditation on the sufferings of her dearest relatives Her Ladyship was a COWPER She is worthy to be nicee of the Editor's Mother's excellent neighbour in Berkshire the excellent Mrs Madan mother of the present Bishop of Peterborough  The poor unhappy female the  infamous  Lady Vane in her latter days after she had lost the use of all her limbs took a house in her native Country of Berks in order to be near a very eminent German apothecary So extremely was her Ladyship afraid of  culinary  fire that she had a machine made to  twirl  her  instantly  out at her window in case of any such accident in the night  The Editor has been twice awakened out of a very sound sleep to escape from fire the last time when Wrigglesworth's the great Inn at York was on fire She has no machine but her garments are regularly every night  so  placed by herself and her maid with her at York as to be ready for instant flight  From dread of culinary fire as Lady Vane travelled down the vale of years towards the  cold  mansion appointed sooner or later for all the  daughters  of Adam however beautiful in youth however  strongly varnished  in age her poor Ladyship began to apprehend that one  part  of her might soon be in danger of A FIRE from which NO machine could possibly  twirl  her The very worthy witty agreeable Mr Henchman Fellow of All Souls used frequently to ride over to Cookham and take a family dinner at Dr Berkeley's Some time after Lady Vane had taken her house in Bray churchyard he diverted all the company present by relating a dialogue that had the day before passed between her Ladyship and his worthy neighbour the German medical man who had just told Mr Henchman how much her Ladyship had distressed him the day before by asking him if  he  thought it possible  she  should be saved The worthy man in broken English said  "Upon my vord my Lady  I  cannot tellshould hope  thatthatthat  God  voud  not  voud  notI did not know  vat  to say to her  p  ir Lady  she seemed  so troubled so frighted  so I said  Your Ladyship had better ask somebody that understands such tings better dan I do I was quite ashamed I did not know vat answer to make to her  at all  "  Mr Henchman said  I  told my good neighbour that he should have said  "To be sure it was  impossible  that the Almighty should  think  of d  g so  public  spirited a Lady"  The Editor greatly wished her Ladyship's Parish Minister or some wellinstructed Divine to have visited her and have shewn her that one gracious promise of the Saviour of  great  as well as of LITTLE sinners  "Him or  her  that cometh unto ME I will no wise cast outcome unto me ALL ye c c"  She was once going to take the high house at Cookham but being an  absolute  cripple the structure of the staircase would not admit of her men carrying her chair up and down If she had taken it the Editor having no daughter and thereby feeling herself at  full  liberty  to  visit  or not  visit whom she pleases declared to the no small amusement of many of her friends that  "  she  should infallibly visit Lady Vane"  Alas poor soul she like most of the children of Adam was a selfdeceiver always declaring that  "had her dear Lord William Hamilton lived she had remained as chaste as Diana"  The Editor  knows  from too good authority that for some time before the death of that singularly amiable worthy young Nobleman her Ladyship's conduct had made him often very wretched He  was removed  hardly  in time for his  own  peace of mind  His  stay would not have prevented  her  sad fall She had run away from her  proscribed  father South Sea Hawes with Lord William Hamilton and the Editor has from her youth delivered it as one of  her  maxims that the lady who will run away  with  a man will generally run away  from  him perhaps it may be said  tant mieux  There are to be sure some few exceptions to all general rules but a girl of fifteen or sixteen must be a bold little wretch to quit a parent's house and set off with  "  that persidious creature man  "  It requires  some  courage to set off to the Altar led by a tender Parent or kind Guardianat least so thinks the Editor  Mr Monck Berkeley descended from two men so famous in their generation as Bishop Berkeley and Francis Cherry Esquire in whose person all that was mortal of those excellent men ended neither having now any  lineal  descendant that can carry their eminent amiable virtues to posterity Should the Editor at any time have it in her power to erect a monument as Dr Berkeley intended to do in Cheltenham church by the wonderfully powerful chissel of her worthy old acquaintance J Nollekins Esquire the  broken pillar  must alas compose a part It cannot however be recorded that the light of those two great men was extinguished in smoke Blessed for ever praised by the mercy of God the  blaze  was brighter in  death than even in life And those two excellent spirits must have hailed with pleasure on his arrival in the region of happy spirits the lovely spirit of their  last  descendant who in one respect a very unimportant one  Our Blessed Redeemer does not appear to have thought decent funerals and monuments to hand persons down to posterity  things wrong  when he tells his covetous Disciples that the  lovely  penitent Mary Magdalen's gratitude in anointing him to his funeral should be rewarded by being recorded in the Gospel and so she be remembered to the  end  of TIME In Isaiah God threatens a king of Judah that he shall be buried with the burial of an ass cast out c Much might be said very different from what is usually said by very pious persons on both these subjects but time and place and health are all wanting  many may say excelled themselvesthe having had at least a faithful sketch of his life given to those of the publick who may choose to spend an hour in reading it Of every  attempt  of a life of Bishop Berkeley yet published his Son used to say  "they are lamentably imperfect"  when Mr Monck Berkeley as abovementioned used to regret Dr Berkeley had not permitted Dr Johnson to write the Life of Bishop Berkeley  There are a thousand very curious very diverting some very ludicrous ancedotes  Bishop Berkeley retained the famous Pasquilino four years in the palace at Cloyne to teach his children music giving him £  per annum  and keeping him a little chaise and pair of tolerable horses The following ludicrous anecdote was some time ago related to the Editor by the very worthy Mr Angello of Eton Dr Berkeley was esteemed the finest gentlemanperformer on the violincello in England as his brother who died at sixteen was a wonderfully fine performer on the violin Bishop Berkeley had a fine concert at his own house every evening in winter when he did not dine from home Signior Pasquilino was to have a very fine concert at Cork One day at dinner the Bishop said  "Well Pasquilino I have got  rid  of a great many tickets for you among my neighbours to Lord Inchiquin Lord Shannon Mr Lumley c"  To which Pasquilino bowing said  "  May God  PICKLE  your Lordship I pray him  "  All the company laughed immoderately The poor Italian said  "Vell in de grammar that my Lord give me to teach me Inglish it is printed  Pickle  to keep from decay"  Bishop Berkeley most kindly invited his brother the Reverend Doctor Robert Berkeley father of the Dean of Tuam and Mrs Hamilton Lady of Sackville Hamilton Esq to send his seven children one fixed day in every week to learn music dancing c of  his  childrens masters  of that great and good Prelate  that Dr Berkeley and his Mother used to relate of the good Bishop even from his childhood throughly diverting The Editor is much addicted to watching children before either the masque is  fitted on  to hide or grace infused to suppress to rectifythe lamentable  dose  of  Original Sin  The Editor has more than once heard the late Lord  say  "that he often pressed a beloved friend of his to marry"  He at length said  "I have long resolved  not  to marry that I may not be the means of propagating a race of Devils"    "Of Devils my dear Friend Is it probable that any thing sprung from such an angelic being as yourself should be Devils"    "Yes my dear Friend to be sure I do for I am one myself All that you and  many others so much admire in me is  God's Grace  for I am by nature and it bloomed most direfully in early youth before you knew me the most illhumoured badtempered malicious diabolical being I believe  ever born into the world  I think I must have sprung from the insernal regions Now as I am sure if I should have children they will at least some of them inherit my horrible temper and as I am by no means sure that the same measure of Grace may be granted to  them  as has through the great mercy of God been vouchsafed to  me  I am resolved to let my vast estate about which you are so anxious go to my uncle's family they may  perhaps  be better than I am  sure  mine would be Nothing can ever shake my resolution it has been long unalterably fixed Examine the lines of my face attentively and you will be convinced of the truth of what I tell you"  His Lordship said  "there appeared some lines subdued of what the excellent man asserted to be in his spirit"  Every one knows how honourably Socrates justified the skill of a famous physiognomist who on coming to Athens and pronouncing Socrates almost every thing that was bad was treated as an impostor until that noble philosopher declared him an excellent judge c  On the commencement of the hard frost in the Bishop went down to breakfast the first Sunday without a grain of powder in his wig Mrs Berkeley the Chaplain  and some company staying in the house on a visit all called out at once to enquire  "what ailed his Lordship"  Bp Berkeley  "A great deal ails me for our poor are all about to be starved We shall have a famine We shall have a very long frost and I am sure it has already killed all the potatoes in this kingdom therefore the poor must depend upon flour so no powder will I or shall any individual of my family wear until next harvest"  They assured him that it disfigured him exceedingly and that the men would look dirty All persuasion was vain He during the frost and until the summer gave either in gold or in a bank note every Monday morning twenty pounds to proper persons to distribute amongst the poor of the little town of Cloyne besides what they received daily hourly out of his kitchen and housekeeper's room  It was a ludicrous message enough which the Bishop received from one old woman  "Her duty to his Lordship and she was very sorry that she had not lived better"  The good Bishop sent her word that  "he hoped she would send for Mr  the name forgotten and talk with him and lead the short remainder of her life differently"  She returned for answer  "that his Lordship mistook her quite She had no trouble about her  sowle  but was sorry as she now in her dying state got such good things from his house that she had not constantly enjoyned them before and could enjoy them so short time now"  It is to be supposed that this good woman's ideas of the joys of Heaven were  very  low  The Editor has been often told by a very intimate sensible friend that HER ideas of Heaven are  very high  VERY  singular  Such as they are some of her intimate friends now and then conjure her to  treat  them as they are pleased to term it with HER account of Heaven She was once brought to  public  shame for this  private  conversation for it is not to be supposed that the Editor is quite fool enough to cast her precious pearls that seem to deck her wings for flight to those delightful regions before such S  ne  See the words of our Blessed Saviour in the Gospel  as frequently surround a drawingroom or cardtable  A very fine lady once requesting dear Dr Berkeley and two other learned men  "to hold  their  tongues that she might hear more distinctly Mrs Berkeley's account of Heaven it was so  enchanting  "  this so shamed poor Mr Berkeley that it almost turned Heaven into H  l Dr Berkeley laughing said  "It is wonderful how many people love to hear  my  wife talk of Heaven She has never been  there yet But  calling her by her name knows the Bible by heart from end to end"  There is certainly much to be gathered from that sacred volume concerning the state of happy spirits much more than can be imagined by those who do not read it  very  attentively and with a view to discover the  hidden  treasure With regard to what relates to our salvation  "He that runs may read"  blessed be the mercy of God  A smart young Divine a relation of Dr Berkeley's had one day after dinner a contest with Mrs Berkeley about a text of Scripture when he very intimate in the family said  "My dear Madam is it not  very  strange that  you  will contend with  me  who am a  Clergyman  concerning  Scripture  "  He was then about twentythree Dr Berkeley said  "Oh George it would be very happy for you and many other Divines if they were as throughly acquainted with the Holy Scriptures as that lady is  I  frequently apply to her"  The Editor has little other knowledge to boast of and  that  knowledge must in  every  instance EXCLUDE BOASTING but had she not  some  of it she must have been a doleful dolt indeed having been  made  to hear or read four chapters every day of her life at family prayers at her Father's with her  leadingstring  at her back as mentioned in a letter in the St James's Chronicle near eighteen months ago combating the learned Dr Beattie's treatment of  his  son with regard to the existence of a  Supreme Being and thenceforward until this present day and she humbly trusts to the last hour of her life besides every day's private reading alone some portion of that allinforming volume  But to return from this long digression to Mr Monck Berkeley's noble and nonnoble  The Editor has perhaps here  selon sa coutume coined  a word as she did many years ago when in the world When the Honourable and worthy Mrs Berkeley mother of Lady Woodhouse was living there were frequent mistakes although the Editor always left her cards as it  became her to do  "Mrs George Berkeley" and always ordered her servants to announce her Mrs George Berkeley but to save trouble the  ton  lacqueys often dropped the GEORGE a bad pun might here be made in ascending the staircase which now and then occasioned her being received with a  formal respectful  face and then  "Oh my dear friend is it you"  A gentleman once said  "These Ladies should be announced the  Honourable  and the  "  The Editor exclaimed  "  I will not be announced the Dishonourable  Mrs Berkeley for  I  have never disgraced the noble name I am content to be announced the unhonourable Mrs Berkeley"  A very polite lady said  "You should Madam be announced the honoured Mrs Berkeley"  grandsires The Editor does not recollect to have redde in any of Bishop Berkeley's lives that mention is made of his  utterly  refusing to inclose the great common at Cloyne where the poor used to cut their peat turn their cows pigs and poultry the doing which had nearly cost the present Earl of Bristol his life he being obliged to be guarded out of Cloyne by an old friend of Dr Berkeley Mr Lumley of Ballymaloo Castle riding with a cocked pistol close to the CHARITABLE Prelate's ear declaring that the first man who threw a stone  was a dead man as that gentleman's mother told Dr Berkeley in his drawingroom the Editor being present It were to be wished that worthyspirited gentleman or some as worthy and  fearless  had been on the jury who acquitted C  ld How often has the Editor rejoiced to hear her Son thank the goodness of God that the  said  support of the poor was  not  united to  his  small patrimony by his episcopal grandsire  No regular life of Mr Cherry has ever been  attempted  as of Bishop Berkeley to be written A short sketch appeared in in Mr Nichols's "Leicestershire Collections  See the History of Hinckley p  " where his Chaplain the Rev Francis Brokesby is mentioned The  Irish  Demosthenes once did him the honour to say  "It is a shame Madam that the life of your grandfather has not been written"  Mrs Berkeley once met with a small diverting humiliation on account of being descended from that excellent man to the no small diversion of Dr and Dr Mr Monck Berkeley Returning from her morning walk clad as usual  in the morning  the Editor never wastes the  morning  in walking but in winter  Some years ago when Dr Berkeley resided at Cookham the Editor escorted by three elegant beaux used generally to walk an hour and a half in the Southcote Walk by moon or starlight enjoying the conversation of the very learned accomplished D  M  Esquire his son S  M  Esquire and her own delightful youth then about seventeen On their return to Dr Berkeley and Mrs Frinsham he used to say on their creeping  into  the fire  "I wonder your Mother and you two such chilly souls are not perishedIt can only be M  's conversation that can prevent itTo be sure if any one's can it is his"  Dr Berkeley himself never sat  into  a fire He was a great admirer of that gentleman's fine understanding and deep learning    she being now too tender in excessive cold weather to venture to walk after dinner for health although it is  wonderfully  beneficial for those who dining at a reasonable hour at three o'clock can do it as the Editor does experience and has seen in various persons with a black beaver hat tied under her chin and wrapped round in a  rather  rusty black mode cloack she stroled into Dr Berkeley's room not knowing that any one was with him There happened to be a person more esteemed in the world for his great learning and true worth than for his title and rank in society In the course of conversation Mr Cherry was named Dr Berkeley said  "A relation of my wife"  The visitor probably wishing to hear some anecdote of that excellent man turned to Mrs Berkeley saying  "Pray Madam do you know any thing of Mr Cherry"  supposing her as it should seem by the sequel a distant relation She replied  "He was my mother's father"  He started astonished and said  "  What  Madam  are  YOU a granddaughter of the  great  Mr Cherry"  Mrs Berkeley smiling said  "She had that honour"  The enquirer's politeness and good sense prevented  his  apologizing  by saying  "Madam I ask your pardon I did not conceive that such an insignificant undressed little being could possibly be descended from the very handsome noblelooking Mr Cherry"  universally esteemed the most completely accomplished fine gentleman of his time A picture of Mr Cherry by Richardson is in the Picturegallery at Oxford  Mr Cherry bequeathed to the Bodleian Library a box of very curious old  genuine  manuscripts The Editor has often heard her mother say that in the box was a small manuscript book written entirely by Queen Elizabeth the cover of pale blue cloth embroidered with gold and silver leaves and flowers by her  royal fingers  much better employed as she NOW FEELS than when signing the deathwarrant for the  unfortunate Mary  or the NOBLE  Earl of Essex  The Editor in her youth very seldom went to a new play the first night of acting She however was persuaded to go to Brooke's "Earl of Essex" where she heard the finest soliloquy put into the mouth of old Burleigh that even the genius of Brooke could compose  incomparably  utteredand the Editor is esteemed by her acquaintance a tolerable judge of speaking she formerly redde pretty well having an  absolute  command of her voice in  reading  It never was spoken but  that once  When the tragedy was published it was omitted The Editor admiring it very much made enquiry but could never meet with any person who remembered it insomuch that she began to suspect that  she  must have dreamed it Mentioning it a few years ago in a large circle a gentleman of the company said  "I was at the play that night and heard that glorious soliloquy"  He then repeated the substance of it to the company joining with the Editor in supposing that one of Burleigh's descendants had prevailed on Mr Brooke to throw it out It must have been the late very amiable Lord Exeter as the  late  Lord Salisbury would not have cared had Brooke made Burleigh the  actual  butcher of Essex The Editor honours Dr Thompson for the employment he has assigned to that cruel wretch Elizabeth in his very entertaining work "A Voyage to the Moon" as also for the easy delightful way in which he dismisses the late Earl of K  who ceased to be his patron no one knew why on some little caprice of the Earl's as was supposed as the Editor has heard her Son say Mr Monck Berkeley admired Dr Thompson's worthiness in providing an early easy grave for the worthy minister that is Lord K  in the "Journey to the Moon"  presented after his death by his lady and daughters  The Editor and her Sister have a very fine picture of Mr Cherry painted by Riley in a fullbottomed twentyguinea wig when Mr Cherry was a GentlemanCommoner of Edmund Hall not quite  seventeen  years old This tremendous peruke does not so absolutely disguise him but that on  attentive  inspection he appears a very beautiful youth  Mr Cherry married soon after he was twenty His house which at the Revolution made up seventy beds for the officers and soldiers quartered on him was the hotel devoted to friendship to learning to distress  With Sir Constantine Phipps grandsire of the present Lord Mulgrave he formed an acquaintance at Oxford He was a native of Reading and went off from Archbishop Laud's school to St John's College Oxford It was a very advantageous connection for the barrister who until his appointment by Queen Anne to the seals in Ireland had no country residence but Shottesbrook House where himself lady three girls sometimes the amiable T Phipps his angelic eldest son their coachhorses saddlehorses and  three or four servants constantly spent four months every summer  The respected and respectable friends of Mr and Mrs Cherry  Bowdler Esquire his excellent Lady and family grandfather c of the pious  resigned  Miss Bowdler author of the Essays  The seraphic Bishop Kenn  The Editor when a girl about sixteen remembers to have redde what she  then  thought and believes she should  now  think a very  dull  stupid life of that chearful gay as well as exquisitely pious Prelate She was so disappointed that she told her Mother she  thought she  could write a  better  life of him  herself  It is very lucky for  damsels  of  sixteen  to have  wise  mothers Perhaps the Editor had commenced  author  at  sixteen  some will perhaps say better than at  sixty  Her chearful gay spirit had been frequently exhilarated by the lively tales told her by her Mother of the agreeable Bishop She however once told her Mother  "that she  sadly  feared the Bishop was a  little  of an hypocrite"    "An HYPOCRITE child"  exclaimed her Mother  "what can make you talk such  horrid  nonsense"    "Why my dear Madam in one of his works the Editor does not now recollect which he laments that '  his  heart is deceitful desperately wicked c' and he was  you  say 'an Angel'"  To which the Editor's wise judicious Mother only replied  "Well my poor dear child that only shews that  he knew his own heart  "  This and Mrs Frinsham's answer to the Editor on the conduct of poor wretched Miss Blandy whose honest father transacted Mrs Frinsham's business only made the poor ignorant Editor conceive that  all  the excellent of the earth were in unison to be what  she  not  then knowing her own heart  thought  affectedly  humble and to  shew  their humility  falsified  The LAW is the  only schoolmaster  to teach us to read that BLACK BOOKour own heart The Editor cannot forbear mentioning to the honour of a  sort  of favourite of her's she believes for his exquisite politeness Charles the Second the anecdote that placed Bishop Kenn on the Bench She does not recollect having ever seen it in print When the King and Court went down to Winchester the house of Dr Kenn was destined to be the residence of Mrs Gwynne The good little man declared that  she should not be under his roof  He was steady as a rock The intelligence was carried to the King who said  "Well then NELL must take a lodging in the city"  All the  Court  Divines c were SHOCKED at Dr Kenn's  strange  conduct saying that  "he had  ruined  his fortune and would never rise in the church"  militant  Some months after the Bishopric of Bath and Wells becoming vacant the Minister c recommended as is always usual I suppose some  learned pious  Divines to which the King answered  "No none of them shall have it I assure you What is the name of that little man at Winchester that would not let Nell Gwynne lodge at his house"    "Dr Kenn please your Majesty"    "Well he shall have it then I  resolved  that he should have the first Bishopric that fell if it had been Canterbury"  The wise and pious Bishop Horne says in a Sermon before the University  "  And be it known to our adversaries that  GOD  can if he see it good  for his faithful servants advance them in  this  world"  Just after the deprivation of the Bishops a gentleman meeting Bishop Kenn began condoling with his Lordship to which he merrily replied  "God bless you my friend do not pity me man '  my father lived before me  ' he was an  honest  farmer and left me twenty pounds a year thank God"  He spent his time between Long Leate and Shottesbrook House He  every  morning made a vow that he would not marry  that  day Mr Cherry used frequently on his entering the breakfastroom to say  "Well my good Lord is the resolution made this morning"    "Oh yes Sir long ago"  He rose generally very early and never took a second sleep  * Mrs Frinsham always told her daughters after they ceased to be quite children  "Girls never assent to a thing because  I  say it  think  for yourselves turn it in your own minds and if you think differently from me politely tell me so and we will examine the matter together"  The Editor well remembers having availed herself of this liberty at eleven years old when reading the History of England  à l'egard de  Queen Elizabeth whom she thus early abhorred for her horrid deceits her conduct to Secretary Davison  found a second home at Shottesbrook House dividing his time between the Marquis  of Bath's grandfather's famed mansion  "Ye lads and ye lasses who live at Long Leate"  c  and Mr  Cherry's Dr Grabe and many other learned foreigners spent much time at Shottesbrook House  The very learned Charles Leslie was concealed six months by Mr Cherry in regimentals not under his own roof but at an house of Mr Cherry's at White Waltham then called the Hill House now Waltham Place He went to Rome at Mr Cherry's request and at his expence to  attempt  to convert the old Chevalier de St George A wonderful idea to enter into the heads of two so very sensible men to convert an ignorant Papist forbidden by his cunning Confessor to search the Scriptures lest he should see the ALL  sufficiency  of Christ to save  lost  sinners In a letter from Rome to Mr Cherry he says  "It would be much easier to turn the course of the Thames at London Bridge than to convert his Majesty"  This Prince's health was constantly given every day at Mr Cherry's when only Nonjurors were present After the death of several of the conscientious nonjuring Bishops the few remaining pious nonjuring Prelates who were anxious not to continue the schism in the excellent Church of England and all the pious Nonjurors agreed throughout the kingdom to go to their respective parish churches on the same day always taking care to avoid praying for the Queen  as Queen  The Editor has frequently heard her Mother laugh at the different dispositions of Mr Cherry and his friend Mr  Dodwell Every time during the service that the Queen was prayed for her Father rose from his knees fine gentlemen kneeled to God in those oldfashioned timesthe Editor hopes they will take to it again to  distinguish them  from the  profane  ladies of these times who almost all now  sit  when they should  kneel  although they do not worshipalas for them poor souls and stood up facing the congregation Mr Dodwell used to slide off his knees and sit down upon his hassock  Mr Cherry a native of Windsor Forest was to the end of his life perhaps the keenest staghunter in England esteemed to ride better than any man in the kingdom always in at the death of the deer He had one hunter a very fine iron grey an  entire  who never suffered any one to mount him but Mr Cherry The groom was always obliged to lead him to water He once crossing Maidenhead Bridge got himself and master half over the rails and there remained no one daring to go near all trembling for Mr Cherry the idol of Berkshire Boats in abundance put out to endeavour to save him when this spirited beast should throw him off In that tremendous situation he remained near a quarter of an hour and then got the beast on the bridge again  One of Mr Cherry's granddaughters not the Editor who had only skill enough to spring off her horse three or four times in a morning's ride seemed to have inherited the skill of her grandfather without having learned as he had to ride the great horse for she never has got a fall not even when learning to ride and whenever she heard of any lady's being thrown her remark was  "I suppose she  chose  it I should like to find  any  horse that could get  me  off his back if I had not an inclination to go"  She accordingly would often lend her own beautiful spirited horse and ride any wild or stupid beast for her amusement If they leap there she sits if they go on both knees there she sits if they rear up there she remains Dr Berkeley used to tell her she could sit a stag She used to say she seemed to have been born on horseback The late Dr James once told a gentleman of the Editor's acquaintance a Prebendary of Canterbury  "If God had meant men should ride so constantly he would have sent them into the world booted and spurred"  It was more witty than wise Perhaps it was politicless of that excellent medicine James's Powder would be sold if persons rode more on horseback A tenant's wife of old Mr Cherry having purchased an old hunter used regularly to ride to Windsor Market when farmers LADIES were not  quite  so  fine  as in these days with two large paniers of butter and eggs One hunting morning hearing the hounds the poor old beast pricked up his ears and set off Every effort of the old woman to hold him in was in vainAway he flew and soon reduced the butter and eggs to a  fine liquid  It dashed Yeomen Prickers Lords Commoners and  even  his Majesty to the great diversion of the witty Charles who would not suffer any one to attempt stopping the horse At the death of the deer his Majesty ordered the butter and eggs to be  amply  paid for and told the honest old woman who began begging pardon c that he should be glad of her company often upon the field adding  "I have not been so entertained for a long time"    Archbishop Potter told the late Archdeacon Dodwell the following anecdote of his father's excellent friend  "King William who valued himself much on his horsemanship was frequently mortified by hearing his courtiers admiring Mr Cherry's wonderful skill in riding and resolved at length that he would follow Mr Cherry every  where After some days Mr Cherry finding that it was not chance that constantly kept his Majesty just behind him determined to try to serve his as he conceived  lawful  Sovereign by breaking the neck of the  Usurper  He went over many very dangerous places The King excellently mounted and a very good horseman still followed One day when the stag took the soil Mr Cherry instantly plunged into a frightfully deep and broad part of the Thames The King went to the brink looked and looked again then shook his head and retired His Majesty thought the actual possession of  three  kingdoms better than the  fame  of being as good a horseman as Mr Cherry thus yielding the palm to Mr Cherry He never followed him afterwards to the great comfort of his Majesty's attendants"  The late Sir Robert Gayer  The Editor and her sister have a most beautiful miniature the property of Mr Cherry done in Italy of this wonderfully beautiful extraordinary man with whom their grandfather was exceedingly intimate When he lost his lovely lady for whom he mourned seven years he never changed his linen walked about the park unshaved in an old black long loose freeze coat almost a Nebucadnezzar The Editor has heard her Mother and her old intimate friend Mrs Baldwyn his granddaughter and mother of  Annesley Esquire of Blechingdon say that the poor women of Stoke would threaten their bawling brats with  "  If you keep crying I'll give you to Sir Robert  "  At the expiration of somewhat more than seven years he dressed like a rational being went and made a visit to Mr Cherry at Shottesbrook House and on entering saluted Mrs Cherry Now alas comes the throughly tragical part of this tale which the Editor when young used to tell some gentlemen of her friends she would print and to humble the  lords  of the creation have bound up with "The History of the EPHESIAN MATRON""LORD  what is  MAN" After some time poor  wretched  Sir Robert married a beautiful widow his own near relation Lady Christian Rolle by whom he had several children His first so singularly lamented lady left four fine sons all of whom he bred up gentlemen to no profession At his death his very large estate fell unavoidably to his eldest son who married the very uncommonly sensible lady Elizabeth Annesly On opening his will it appeared that this what must one style him  Monster of Cruelty  is a milkandwater title for himhad bequeathed to his three younger sons of the THUS lamented lady only FIVE HUNDRED pounds eachGood God and to the Editor thinks  six  children of Lady Christian Rolle each SIX THOUSAND POUNDS Attend to the fate of the three maltreated young gentlemen One died within a few months of a broken heart Another was deprived of his reason and never perfectly recovered it although he lived to possess one can hardly say enjoy his  horrid  father's great estate at Hurley Berks now the property of the excellent Duke of Marlborough after the death of his nephew the late Robert Gayer Esquire of Hurley The third of these injured sons patiently resignedly sunk his five hundred pounds in an annuity and went to board with a farmer at Stokethe at that time wellknown witty Joe Hewett who was in all the gay parties of the nobility and gentry of the neighbourhood He had been many years valet de chambre to  and had not the beautiful Lady Catharine  been pulled back when getting out at one of the windows of  his grandson had been a Peer of  England  This made a  little  noise at the time The only son of Sir William  was going to marry the beautiful Nan Fisher the chambermaid of the Sun Inn at Maidenhead Berks but Nan would insist upon going to town to buy  wedding  cloaths  alas they were converted into  mourning  weeds for the Earl and Sir William met made up a match between Mr  and Lady Catharine  and they were a very  decently  happy couple as the Editor has frequently heard her Mother and many other friends of that day relate her Ladyship's conduct as a  wife  and a  mother  was excellent A writer of romance would certainly marry the agreeable Joe to Nan Fisher He married a very rich farmer's widow by whom he had a very worthy agreeable daughter whom it was supposed that the resigned Mr Gayer would have married That happytempered injured gentleman the Editor remembers he did not die until after she was grown up a woman Goodtempered persons generally live longer than bad ones and it is certain that their lives are much pleasanter  of  Stoke Park near Windsor absolutely refused to let King William in to see his house his Majesty waiting in his coach at the doorpoor Lady Gayer supplicatingHis answer  "No he is an Usurper Every man in England is King in his own castle He shall not come in"  So his Majesty returned to Windsor and died without seeing Stoke House  During the reign of King William Mr Cherry always on hunting days rode up to the Princess of Denmark's calash the chaise in which her Royal Highness hunted was so called to pay his respects The Princess admired his conversation his uncommonly fine understanding and exquisitely high breeding as politeness now said to be HORRIDLY old fashioned  A Lady who does the Editor the honour to rank her amongst her eldest friends having had the  real  pleasure to have been well acquainted with her since she was seven years old the wonderfully well informed allaccomplished Countess of Orkneywho has more than once said to the Editor  "There are two things however oldfashioned in which I am resolved to persist I will not give up the little politeness I possess nor ever dress like my housemaid"  The Editor has always had the honour to resemble her Ladyship in that idea before Lady Orkney was born when going into a draper's shop in York Street to purchase a morning gown constantly saying  "Be pleased Sir to shew me some linens that  my maid would not wear  "  Several years ago at a very large rout at the worthy Lady Head's a gentleman came up to the cardtable where the Editor was playing and accosted her thus  "Well Mrs Berkeley have  you  heard how the King has FLUMMERED your young neighbour Lady Mary O'Brien"    "Not I"    "Oh then  I'll  tell you She was presented the other day and the King said 'He saw that it was possible to be exquisitely wellbred without having ever been in townin the world' Did you ever hear such  flummer  in your whole life"  Every one said  "That was a very highflown compliment to her indeed"  The Editor said rather briskly  "  By no means  I who have the honour to know the young Lady well throw down my gauntlet to prove that it is  no flattery at all  Her father is I do in my conscience really believe the most completely wellbred man in Europe Poor good Lady Orkney although unable to articulate almost equally so"  The Editor then related two particular instances one when Lady Mary O'Brien was about nine years old the other when Doctor Berkeley's family were one day dining at Taplow Court so silencing the gentleman and entertaining the company The Editor at her return home related this to Dr Berkeley who never staid longer than twenty minutes in a routroom saying  "that he did not love  burnt air  "  as he always termed the air of hot rooms He said  "Aye his Majesty and Lady Mary could not have a better advocate than  calling the Editor by her name that gentleman did not know the young Lady's  father  or he would not have termed it  flummer  "  The Editor who knows we must account for every idle word ie our common conversation and for every  deceitful  compliment  many  obliging polite things may be said to and of many persons  without  deceit here takes the opportunity of saying that she thinks that the most agreeable  whole  day she ever remembers to have passed in her life was spent tête à tête for the worthy Lady Anne O'Brien cannot with propriety be considered in a  conversation  as a third person with Lady Orkney when going and returning many miles on a day visit to their common friends the very worthy General and Mrs B  s  was termed in those AWKWARD  days On her  obtaining a crown  she  lost  the  conversation  of Mr Cherry who was too correctly well bred to think of approaching that throughly respectable Princess to insult her and no bribe could ever have induced him to acknowledge himself her subject  whilst  her father and brother  were living Mr Cherry took great pains as far as the oath of a woman of the bedchamber to King James's Queen  could  ascertain it to be fully convinced that the Chevalier de St George was  actually produced  by his Queen The oath of the facts to which the lady swore was carefully preserved by Mr Cherry and accordingly the first day that her Majesty hunted after her accession to the throne Mr Cherry kept  aloof  from  Royalty  Her Majesty called to her officer known in those days by the name of the  Bottleman  saying  "Peachy if my eyes do not deceive me I see Mr Cherry upon the field"  Peachy  "Yes please your Majesty he is yonder"  pointing with his whip  The Queen  "Aye he will not come to  me now  I know the reason But go you and carry him a couple of bottles of red wine and white  from me  and tell him that I esteem him one of the honestest gentlemen in my dominions"  The Editor although not so  nobly  descended as her beloved Partner sometimes feels a momentary pleasure in knowing she is descended from  honest  ancestors and the character always given by the sensible elegant lovely Mrs Sheeles of the Editor and her sister when girls at school  was  "  They are honest to the bone  When the Editor was a girl about eleven years old dining one day with a very intimate friend of her Mother together with three or four more of Mrs Sheeles's young ladies the good lady recommended to their kind care Miss  daughter of Colonel  who was going the next week to Mrs Sheeles's school Every one said civil things  excepting  the poor Editor to whom the lady said  "My dear Miss Frinsham why don't  you  tell me that  you  will be kind to my little friend"    "  Because  Madam I never make any promises for fear I should break them If you please I will  stay  till I  see  how I shall like her"  On the young lady's arrival she proved a little of the  "  humdrum  "  kind and  no one  paid her any attention but the Editor as the good lady told Mrs Frinsham Mrs Sheeles with her wonted  excellent  skill  furbished  her up She is a very worthy lady as the Editor hears and when the antient title of  devolves to the gentleman she has married she will make a very good Countess  they have  no  deceit in them"  When Mr Monck Berkeley sometimes saw persons  acting polite deceits  he used to say  "Well whatever faults I have thank God and my Mother  I am at least an honest man  "  A very witty friend of the Editor's youth well known in the world for his  bons mols  now no more used to say when men of  a certain rank  in the world acted like scoundrels  "Well  he  will  not  be hanged for no poor wretch ever goes to the gallows whose confession does not begin That he was born of  poor  but HONEST parents"  But to return to Mr Cherry He did not return his  duty  to a Sovereign  he  did not acknowledge as such he  requested Mr Peachy to present his very humble respects and best thanks to his Mr Peachy's Mistress for the high honour conferred on him The favour was frequently repeated  Mr Cherry died just one year before the Queen After the Rebellion in Mrs Cherry in her coach with her two daughters driving down Ludgate Hill met several coaches filled with the unfortunate gentlemen who had been in the Rebellion returning to Newgate after their sentence she exclaimed  "Oh my dear girls bless the goodness of God that your excellent father is  dead  or he had been amongst those unhappy men for I am sure he would never have worn a sword without drawing it in  this  cause and he would certainly have been hanged"  King William sent repeated offers of any thing and every thing to Mr Cherry if he would go to Court and take the oaths Queen Anne it should seem was too well acquainted with Mr Cherry to make him  any such  offers She shewed her esteem for that  throughly honest  man in other ways  A considerable part of Mr Cherry's very large estate lay in Windsor Forest It is to this day a lucky circumstance for the beautiful county of Berks that Mr Cherry's wonderfully  acute father when in the country resided there rather than at his estate in Surrey  On the first laying on the landtax meetings were called by the Sheriffs in every county in England At Reading nearly central always the county town until the old Lord Harcourt contrived to get electors and jurymen dragged down to Abingdon the last townparishin the countyAt Reading the whole county met and were harangued by a  ministerial  orator telling them  "that the tax was only to be levied ONE  year  and every gentleman and yeoman was to give in the full value of his own estate"  Some  few  of the gentlemen zealous friends to the new government for Berks was always an honest Tory county and others from motives of vanity gave in the value of their estates more than double saying  "Come let us do the thing  handsomely generously  "  When an entry was about to be committed to paper that  The Editor often contemplates with admiration the very wonderfully sensible thoughtful sedate countenance of her great grandfather in a very fine portrait of that great lawyer painted by Richardson at an advanced age She would have been pleased to hear the sensible La Vatre's sentiments of it The Editor notwithstanding her being shortsighted was from her youth a great physiognomist and has generally been right in her conjecture The spirit  will force  itsef through the clay  acutest  of barristers stepped forth requesting to be heard a few words His oratory was different from that of many modern barristers it was  rather laconic  The Editor remembers to have heard it often repeated always applauded since she was seven years old  "Gentlemen  "We are  told  that this tax is laid on for  only one year  It is POSSIBLE it may be taken off at the expiration of the year but it is much more probable that our greatgrandchildren may see it  trebled  and then they will not  bless  the  wisdom  of their forefathers in having so greatly overrated the value of their estates as I well know many of you have done"  The greatgrandsire of the present Lord le Despenser cried out  "Mr Cherry speaks like an  Oracle  I am sure in my  hurry  I have given in  my  estate  too  high"  It lay in what is called the  antient demesne  of Bray and the Editor has frequently heard her Mother say that Sir William Paul's  The Editor from the very amiable character that she has heard of the present Lord Despencer conceives he knows not that his beautiful greatgrandmother from whom he enjoys his very ancient title the second daughter of the

cemeteries It is pity  all  parishes do not follow the example of Fairford in Gloucestershire  lay down  iron grates over which swine cannot tread The Editor learned this humiliation of her grandmother's noble beautiful friend by accident when about seventeen The late throughly amiable worthy Bacon Morritt Junior Esquire on a visit at the Editor's Mother's asked Mrs Frinsham  "What could be the reason that a woman of that high rank lay thus neglected"  Mrs Frinsham replied that  "her unworthy  only  daughter by whom she had to her great injury acted most generously having quarrelled with her mother had suffered her to be buried as a pauper"  adding  "I dare say if Sir Thomas Stapleton knew it he would order a  protecting  monument to cover her once exquisitely beautiful elegant form"  To which Morritt replied  "If  he  does not  I declare I will  "  Alas dear youth this and every other amiable purpose of thy excellent heart was broken by the dart of DEATH This excellence

Editor having trespassed too long on the Public with her own imbecil pen in order to make some amends presents her readers with two letters from very superior pens the two abovenamed great and good men from whom Mr Monck Berkeley had the honour to be descended one from Bishop Berkeley on the death of his favourite Son the other from Mr Cherry to his Lady ordering his own interment  LETTER OF BISHOP BERKELEY  Uncertain whether it is addressed to Lord Egmont or to Bishop Benson This letter as well as Mr Cherry's is  borrowed  from amongst those of Potentates Princes and Plebeians of the second volume of the "  Literary Relics by George Monck Berkeley Esq  " all ready for the press at the time of his death When they will see the light is now uncertain Amongst them is one of Bishop Berkeley's to his beloved friend Bishop Benson written on February a few hours after the death of his son The Editor has heard her beloved Partner say that on his entering his Father's room to announce the heavy tidings he had one arm in his nightgown rising to go to his Son four in the morning he drew it out again saying  "the Lord gave"  c and lay down in his bed On the day of the funeral his brother and attending friends dined with him and no one would have supposed that he had lost his idol The Bishop used frequently to say to Dr Berkeley I see him incessantly before my eyes  My dear

slightly built a most uncommonly elegant youth danced as did his brother remarkably well  his innocence and piety his particularly uncommon affection for me had gained too much upon me Not content to be fond of him I was  vain  of him I had set my heart too much upon him more perhaps than I ought to have done upon any thing in this world  The Editor sometimes consoles herself that even the great Bishop Berkeley and the eminently pious Mrs A  had not been able at least had not avoided  "  setting up their idols in their hearts  "  see the prophet Ezekiel how much less could  she  hope to avoid it The pious Prelate speaks himself to his friend by letter The good lady has frequently  vivd voce  said to the Editor  "Ah my dear friend God has been gracious to me he has taken away  all  my idols one by one My eldest son a lovely youth my angelic daughter the first lady of the present Lord  my son's first lady on whom I doated"  Then adding cheerfully  "God has spared my son whom I love very much but the  squire  is not a thing to make an idol"  He is a very worthy gentleman  Thus much suffer me to say in the overflowings of my soul to say to your Lordship who  though distant in place are much nearer my heart than any of my neighbours  Adieu my dear Lord and believe me with the utmost esteem and affection  your faithful humble servant G CLOYNE  Cloyne  March  The following letter is inserted with the notes as it was made ready for the "Literary Relics"  Letter from FRANCIS CHERRY Esquire of Shottesbrook House in Berkshire to his Lady eldest daughter and one of the five rich coheiresses of JOHN FINCH  Eliza the eldest married Francis Cherry Esq  Mrs Cherry was supposed to have made the greatest match of all Mr Finch's daughters though her granddaughters are now the poorest of the family but they have enough  "Man wants but little nor that little long"  says the Poet They bless God that they have so much instead of murmuring that they have not more A famous old ferryman at Bray Island used to say  "We were not all born to live in Cheapside"  His ideas of Cheapside must have been entertaining  "We cannot all have coaches and six"  as good Bishop Taylor says The Editor when a very young woman used always to assert that she had rather have an income of  eight hundred pounds per annum  than one of  eight thousand  to the diversion of her friends and her sister She still continues in the same mind knowing that little or much we  must  "render an account of our stewardship"  Mrs Frinsham with her wonted wit often says to the Editor  "When you have your eight hundred pounds and I my eight thousand you may do so or so but I  promise you  I will do"  She might with truth add  "good to every distressed creature that I could hear of far or near"  Mary the second married John Sawyer Esq of Henwood House Berks Dorothy the third married William Wright Esq a Welch Judge and Recorder of Oxford father of that very learned upright English Judge the late Sir Martin Wright of Barton Stacy Hants The worthy Recorder has still one most worthy descendant the excellent lady Guise relict of the amiable Sir John Guise of Highnam Court Bart in the County of Gloucester May the fine olivebranches round her table resemble the parent stock The fourth Sarah married to William Yorke Esq of Pirton in the county of Wilts who left no child and fifth Johanna married to John Dalby Esq of Hurst Park in the County of Berks nephew to Bishop Juxon The family of the late J Dalby Esq had a fine original picture of his pious uncle The idea that the picture of the Bishop drawn after his death and in the gallery at Lambeth Palace being the  only picture  ever painted of that pious Prelate is erroneous The good Bishop had one of the six rings given by King Charles at the block which is exceedingly curious indeed and is still carefully preserved by the Editor's worthy relations Mrs E and Mrs S Dalby now residing at Reading who obligingly permitted the Editor to take a drawing of it which she keeps with a lock of the Royal Martyr's hair in a snuffbox with a very fine enamelled picture in the lid of his unfortunate grandmother the murdered Mary  Esquire of Fiennes Court Berks  My dearest Creature  I have several times begun to give you some directions for your behaviour after my death but always found you so impatient of any such  discourse that I have reason to believe you remember very little of what I have said to you upon that subject and therefore think it necessary to leave in writing the few directions following with which how unreasonable soever they may seem to you I assure myself of your ready compliance from the long experience I have had of the greatest duty and affection that ever woman shewed to an husband and for which I return you these my last and most hearty thanks First as to my funeral which will be the first trouble I desire to be buried if it may be the morrow night after I shall die and so private that I would have no person know it or be invited to it except four of the poorest of your tenants to carry me to my grave to each of which I desire you to give five shillings in money I would have no atchievement  escutcheon or pall I desire to be buried in the churchyard of Shottesbrook House between the vault where my father lyeth and the chancel belonging to Shottesbrook House I would have a brickwork of two or three foot raised over my grave and a plain black marble laid upon it without any arms name or other inscription but this which followeth  HIC · IACET · PECCATORUM · MAXIMUS  ANNO · DOM MDCC  supplying the date of the year of my death  Mr Cherry died in September His directions to his excellent lady were in general complied with The burialground was after his interment railedin with iron railing and planted with cypress and other funeral shrubs which the present Lord of the Manor and the late Rector conceiving to be injurious to the church they removed them to the great regret of his descendant the late George Monck Berkeley Esq    Second I desire you to take warning by me and not to engage yourself or children in any of my troublesome concerns which have broke my heart and will never suffer either you or them to enjoy any happiness or quiet if you meddle with them I therefore beg of you as the last and greatest instance of love that I can shew you to content yourself with what was settled upon my marriage and the addition settled since by my father  in pursuance of our marriage settlement articles  Mr Cherry marrying before he was of age could only enter into articles to sign fulfil c when of age Part of Mrs Cherry's fortune was in land which could not be properly shared until her four younger sisters became of age  There you have a RIGHT to both in LAW and CONSCIENCE antecedent to any debts either of myself or my father and therefore may with a good conscience claim and enjoy them But as to the rest of my estate both real and personal I desire you to let it go to the payment of debts This will draw down a blessing upon what you have left and vindicate in some measure the honesty  Mr Cherry's  honesty  wanted no vindication A short time before the death of his father he happened to see in his father's study a book containing a list of his debts He purchased one estate with debts upon it which he knew had life been lent him he had soon wiped off On the servant's announcing in the night to Mr Cherry that his father was released three days after the glass of the chariot was taken out of his head he said to his lady  "  I am  now thirty thousand pounds in debt for I am resolved to pay every shilling that my father owed"  So far was quite right surely but alas he immediately took up his father's bonds and gave his own Mr Cherry's fine judgement certainly failed him here Almost every one pressed on him to be paid immediately knowing that should he have a son born he had buried two the estate was so entailed that it could not possibly be sold As it was with only daughters they were obliged after the death of their excellent father to get an Act of Parliament to sell it At a meeting of creditors one day at a Judge's chambers the Editor has often heard her mother say that Mr Spinckes author of "The Sick Man visited" one of the creditors came up to Mrs Cherry and said  "It may perhaps Madam be an odd thing for a clergyman to say but I must say that Mr Cherry was a too honest man Why not let us wait and receive out interest punctually as we always had done from old Mr Cherry"  The celebrated Mrs Barbara Porter arrested Mr Cherry for her debt of  only two hundred pounds  for which his granddaughter the Editor always hangs her beautiful small picture in the storeroom his other granddaughter often threatens to hang it in a more ignoble place the temple of  To be sure she had a fine face and a clever brain  "  but the beast had no heart  "  She was Mr Cherry's godmother He certainly did not learn his  exquisite  kindness to the distressed from  this lady  The respectful sheriff's officers conjured him to go to Reading gaol in his chariot but he would not took his cane and walked with them He remained there but a few days but the Editor has frequently heard her mother say it cost him above an hundred pounds for all the noblemen and gentlemen of the county went to visit him Mr Cherry experienced the truth of one text of Scripture on this event A nephew of his lady who was under very great pecuniary obligations as well as a thousand amiable attentions in his youth begged to be excused being bound for Mr Cherry saying  "that he had promised his wife when he married "that he would never be bound for any one" What a convenient  thing  a wise sometimes is to  "  The very worthy Vicar of the poor pitiful  living  or rather  starving  of White Waltham in the gift of Mr Cherry set out immediately to a gentlemen who had married a near relation of Mr Cherry desiring him to be joint bondsman with him for Mr Cherry The gentleman not a very brilliant genius hesitating a little Mr Griffith said  "Sir Mr Cherry would be torn to pieces by wild horses sooner than fly from his bail"  The Clergy are certainly in general some few exceptions of  Dignitaries  of the church of ********** a very liberal body of men The Editor takes this opportunity of making her public acknowledgements to the polite amiable Mr Hambley of Herts the present vicar of Cookham for his very pleasing conduct to Dr Berkeley when Dr Berkeley quitted that lovely spot and to the Editor since Dr Berkeley always left all unpleasant business to the Editor as he always made her open letters that he suspected to be unpleasant He charged her to write him word how  she  liked his successor She wrote him word that in Mr Hambley's  bearing armorial  was a  lion  but that  she  thought he ought to apply to their friend Sir Isaac Heard to exchange that ferocious animal for a  dove  or a  lamb  As also to the exquisitely polite Mr Barker who succeeded Dr Berkeley as Chancellor of Brecon But  he  has only  ten children  and he has the excellent Bishop Stuart of St David for a patron at which the Editor most sincerely rejoices Those that are judges know that Mr Barker is a gentleman of profound erudition and that the good Bishop has honoured himself by preferring Mr Barker a stranger to his Lordship as his very polite son of Christ's College told the Editor until he became his Diocesan  of  Thy unfortunate but Truly loving husband F CHERRY  Copia vera verbatim  No date It was written several months before Mr Cherry's death which he had seen approaching with such entire confidence in the glorious promises of our allgracious Redeemer that on the Saturday preceding his death  which happened on the Wednesday he danced until the clock struck twelve His beloved nephew eldest son of his eldest sister James Hayes Esq of Holyport father of James Hayes Esq late one of his Majesty's Judges for North Wales then recently married Mr Cherry said one day to his lady  "We have not had the newmarried couple to dinner yet we must have them the last venison we shall have this season is fit to dress for every body but myself" Mr Cherry frequently had a haunch hung up like his nephew Dr Cherry Hayes of Windsor until it was ready to shake from the bone "Send over a servant to invite them for Saturday"  Of course some other families in the neighbourhood  were invited to meet them During the time of dinner Mr Cherry said  "It is just come into my head that I must have a dance with the bride"  Mrs Cherry objected lest it might injure him He replied  "My dear I am as well able to dance now as I was the first time I had the happiness  There had been a quarrel between the gamekeepers of Mr Finch and Mr Cherry Their manors joining so there was no visiting Mr Cherry however met the lady at a neighbour's and as in antient times danced the whole night with her At breakfast one was saying how soundly they had slept and another that they had slept little Mr Francis Cherry said  "I can't tell how it was but I could not sleep at all"  An acute lady said to his anxious mother Mr Cherry a sort of  Isaac  born after his sisters were almost women  "  I  can tell you why  Frank  did not sleep it was because the FINCHES kept such a twittering at his windows it was  impossible  he  should  sleep"  Mr Cherry told his single his favourite sister who fell into a consumption and died for the loss of an accomplished young gentleman to whom she was going to be married that  if ever  he married he then hardly twenty  she  had seen the lady She replied  "Oh my dear brother that is  impossible  you know there has been a quarrel between the families"    "Well then  I  will make PEACE"  He did so for never did family live in greater harmony than old Mr Cherry his excellent lady and Mr and Mrs F Cherry They had no other home either in town or country but Shottersbrook House and Arundel Streetthe house now made into three Old Mr Cherry allowed his son £  per annum  to fly about to Astrop Bath c and to relieve distressed objectsa favourite amusement of Mr F Cherry as well as of his great grandson George Monck Berkeley Esquire  to dance with you"  The young lady one of the most amiable of womenthe Hayes family are remarkably lucky in choosing sweettempered women at least Mr Hayes and his son were so may their worthy descendants  be as fortunate as their father and grandfatherwhen these gentlemen lost their  lovely  mother the Editor lost a  most sincerely  beloved friend and ALL the surrounding poor a real  visible  Guardian Angel Adieu sweet spiritthis lady may perhaps like to think that she has danced with her old uncle  Mr Cherry was esteemed one of the finest dancers as well as the first horseman in England and HE certainly did not esteem dancing a sin he was not one of the gloomy Christians disgracing instead of  "adorning the doctrine of God our Saviour"  He was a great studier of the Holy Scriptures and had no doubt often redde as well as his granddaughter Mrs George Berkeley although perhaps he had not occasion in those days to quote it so frequently the promise of God by the prophet Jeremiah  "Thou shalt again go forth in the dances of them that  make merry  "  The late John Wesley says in his ridiculous account printed by himself of his seminary for educating young hypocrites  "the children at certain times are allowed to RECREATE themselves" there was surely need that they should be  re  created after being under his tuition "for the word  play  is never used never  heard  of amongst them"  Now God speaking by his Holy Prophet Zechariah says  "there shall yet again be boys and girls PLAYING in the streets of Jerusalem"  ch viii ver It is lamentable to remark that those who affect so much more strictness rigidity or what you please than is enjoined by God himself generally fall into the shameful breach of part of the second table This  "loading men and poor little children with these heavy burdens and grievous to be borne"  is often a  blind  to conceal the breach the open breach of the seventh or eighth commandments Mr Cherry was certainly not one of  this sort  of Christians for until the end of his life he his lady and daughters the youngest near sixteen at the time of her father's death always danced several nights every full moon at his own and several neighbouring gentlemen's seats fathers mothers sons and daughters all danced together Young ladies were at  least as  virtuous in those  oldfashioned  days as they are at present The House of Peers was not  quite  so often applied to for dissolving marriages as they are at present Alas let us remember that God speaking of the Jewish nation says  "they assembled by troops in the witty wise pious Dr Young in his 'Centaur not fabulous' says the LADIES houses They were as fed horses c Shall not my soul be AVENGED on  such  a nation as this"  He expressly avoids saying on  this  nation but  "on SUCH a nation as this"  where or whenever seen by his allheartsearching eye We have seen it on France where the  hoinous  sin of ADULTERY was not as formerly there  winked at  but GLORIED in Let us of this stillspared nation beware lest we fall into like condemnation It is in the power often of the most unimportant person to browbeat this dreadful growing sin and woe to those who can by their high rank and station in life do it if they do it not to the  utmost  of their power  Mr Cherry died at Then turning to the  butler he ordered him to send the groom over to Wooburn to fetch the music it soon arrived and to dancing they went and continued their dance until the clock struck twelve Mr Cherry went to church on the Sunday and died on the Wednesday morning following His intimate friend Mr Nelson  The Editor has frequently heard her relate the following she thinks curious anecdote of her excellent intimate friend Robert Nelson Esquire When dying he lay several hours speechless perfectly composed taking no nourishment shewing no signs of life but it was perceptible that he continued to breathe About four in the afternoon the day preceding his death he suddenly put back the curtain raised his head and uttered the following sentence  "There is a very great fire in London this night"  then closed his eyes and lay some few hours as before The Poet says  "Standing on the  threshold  of the old" c c  went over from Cranford House to spend the day with him and found him dying He stayd as late as he could to have carried the news to Lord Berkeley that his friend Mr Cherry's noble spirit had taken its happy flight to the realms of bliss which it did at four in the  morning of the next day and it may be hoped the worthy Earl some years after if he attended to the rules given to him at his  own  See Lord Berkeley's Meditations and the Countess of  's Funeral Sermon c both now very scarce books  request by his angelic friend Mary Countess of Warwick the favourite sister of the SERAPHIC Robert Boyle  It is impossible to dismiss the short account of that  real  Patriot Bishop Berkeley without mentioning his voyage to America one grand design of which no doubt was to introduce Episcopacy  unadulerated  Episcopacy that of the incomparable Church of England into the Western Hemisphere his Lordship frequently declaring  "If Sir  and Lord  do continue to succeed in defeating every scheme to introduce it there that noblest grandest part of the British Empire of the WHOLE world  See Bishop Berkeley's fine poem on America  will be lost they will shake off the Mother Country in a few years Nothing but introducing Bishops amongst them  can  keep them together can keep them loyal  As does plainly appear at this time in France The late Dr Berkeley many years ago once said in a Sermon  "I am persuaded that the  sole  cause why  so  idolatrous a church as that of Rome has been spared thus long is because they have  so strenuously  maintained the coequal Godhead of the Saviour of the World"  And about two years since that very learned Divine and excellent Preacher the Rev Dr Neve Prebendary of Worcester said when preaching  "The reason I am convinced why God has delivered up to such distress devastation and destruction the great kingdoms of France Poland and Hungary is  because they  have given up the GODHEAD of the LORD JESUS CHRIST"  which in France every one knows was owing to that MONSTER of  villany  for he certainly was  not  an infidel but a rascal VOLTAIRE Oh why did PROVIDENCE prevent the great Earl of Peterborough from running him through when his sword was unsheathed to do it  "GOD's ways are unsearchable"  Church  and State in every country must stand and fall together"  What the learned Father so ardently wished so earnestly laboured after the acute Son happily accomplished but it was  "  after the steed was stolen that the stable door was shut  "  for America IS lost Now that he is gone to receive the reward of this  "  good deed  "  and can no longer be  "browbeat  Dr Berkeley in a letter to a friend  "It will  never  be forgiven I was well aware when I did it it  never would  But I care little for that  I  have great delight in having accomplished it"  "  for it it  may  be known to those who did  not  oppose it as it has  long  been to  those that did  that Dr Berkeley Prebendary of Canterbury by his wise arguments persuaded the learned sensible pious Prelates of Scotland to consecrate Bishop Seabury to  their  honour and the  delight  of his own amiable spirit and it may be hoped to the everlasting happiness of many thousands of souls for when the opposers saw that  one  Protestant Bishop had been furnished to America notwithstanding all their opposition they  e'en  sent a few more Why such opposition has been made to the conferring of that invaluable blessing  on the Western World for almost three quarters of a century the OPPOSERS best know and at a certain day we shall ALL know perhaps some may venture a guess before the arrival of that great day  "  That day for which ALL other days were made  "  Dr YOUNG  The Editor has frequently heard Dr Berkeley and his mother who was there say that in Rhode Island about twenty miles in circumference there were at the time of the Bishop's residence there  no less  than  sixteen  different sects in religion Presbyterians Baptists of various sorts c and it was customary for strangers to ask their visitors  "Pray of what religion are you"  and discourse with them on the subject of their dissent from the other FIFTEEN All however excelled the majority alas in England at present in  agreeing  that it was  necessary  to keep  one  day in seven holy to the Supreme Governor of the universe Accordingly on the Bishop's making this usual enquiry it was sometimes answered  "I am a FridaymanI a Saturdayman"  and others acknowledged themselves SEEKERSthat they were  seeking  for the  best  religion and had not  yet  found it These it is to be feared excel thousands in England who  never  Our Blessed Saviour in the Holy Gospel tells us  "Many shall SEEK to enter in and shall not be able"  that we must  "STRIVE c"  The witty Dr Young speaking of  mighty good sort of gentle polite  Christians one supposes says  "Who make an  unobtrusive  tender of  "Their hearts to Heaven" c c c  NIGHT THOUHGTS  seek at all  When two persons of different sects married  a bargain was constantly made that if they changed their religion which they often did twice in six weeks if they did not turn to the husband's or wife's and would exchange it for a  new  one  that new  one should be the Church of England so tacitly acknowledging that to be best of FIFTEEN different religions Surely ladies who are fond of new fashions would find it  mighty pleasant  to reside  sometimes  at Rhode Islanda quite  new wateringplace  This account has been confirmed to the Editor by the very worthy amiable Samuel Johnson Esquire of Connecticut before mentioned in this Preface who was a Privycounsellor of Connecticut the only Church of Englandman that colony had ever elected He was sent over here before we lost America to solicit a cause before his Majesty's Privy Council He was many years hereabout seven His father Dr Samuel Johnson a very learned man an eminent Presbyterian minister was convinced by Bishop Berkeley's arguments and saw the  Divine  right of Episcopacy He preached several Sundays upon it and at length told his congregation that he was so fully convinced of it that  the next Sunday he should attend Episcopal worship and wished  them all  to accompany him which most of them did telling them that  "  he  should not PRESUME to minister any longer in things sacred until he had obtained Episcopal ordination"  which he soon did He wrote several very learned treatises and a very good Hebrew Grammar His excellent son had the degree of LLD conferred on him by the University of Oxford during his residence in England He always spent great part of every summer at Dr Berkeley's and constantly until after the breaking out of the American war sent over two immense double barrels of fine American NewTown pippins the finest growing on Long Island of which his elder brother was proprietor  The Editor used to delight all her friends and neighbours by presenting them with some and herself by making her gardener every year sow some pips in the melonframe and at proper times plant them out There are now eight fine trees thicker than herself bearing six different fruits only one of them resembling the parent fruit one quite through the colour of an orange exquisitely finely flavoured for about six weeks when it becomes so nauseously sweet that nothing but her Chinese pigs will eat them one a green strong sour apple that keeps till May The Editor is a great gardener and made her children such telling her friends that "when God created man HE placed him  in a  garden  not in a  house  It was SIN that made an  house  necessary as well as  cloaths  The young women now contrive to do without cloathing The Editor wishes some contrivance could be found out for aged matrons to do without houses as rent and TAXES run away with much of a small income  In one thing however the different sectarists both men and women all agreed viz in a  rage  for finery to the great amusement of Bishop Berkeley's two learned elegant friends Sir John James and Richard Dalton Esquire the men in flaming scarlet coats and waistcoats laced and fringed with the brightest  glaring yellow  The  sly  Quakers not  venturing  on these  charming  coats and waistcoats yet loving finery figured away with plate at their sideboard or rather  beaufait  One to the no small diversion of Bishop Berkeley sent to England and had made on purpose no such thing being to be found a noble large teapot of solid gold and enquired of the Bishop when drinking tea with him whether  friend  Berkeley had ever seen such a  "  curious  thing"  On being told that silver ones were much in use in England but that he had never seen a gold one Ebenezer replied  "Aye that was the thing I was resolved to have something  finer  than any body else They say that the Queen Queen Caroline has not got one"  The Bishop delighted his ridiculous host by assuring him  "that his was an unique"  and very happy it made him  Oh the fools say rather the knaves If the Kingdom of God as speaks St Paul  "does not consist in meat and drink"  can it signify whether an insignificant individual wears a coat or gown of one colour or another  The Editor once met a rich Quaker woman at tea at the house of a person of quality in her neighbourhood and happened to have on a pair of very fine point ruffles purchased at the time of her marriage for she loved her children too well to buy fine point or lace afterwards After tea the company as is surely pleasant in summer went out to stroll in the garden when the lady of the house called the attention of the Quaker to the Editor's lace She  piously  shook her  wise  head and said  "  I doubt thee beest proud of them vain of them  "  The Editor quietly replied  "I hope not why should I I am a gentleman's daughter and a gentleman's wife and I have from my cradle been dressed as such and if  thee  "the Editor always  thees  and  thous  themthey like  Sir  or  Madam  much better but if they will  not give it  they ought in CONSCIENCE  not to receive it  "and if  thee  wilt excuse me I do not think that I have half the vanity that  thou  hast for  I  have not once called the attention of any of the company to my ruffles and thou hast gone to every individual in the room to shew them that bauble at thy watch telling them it was given to thee by Lady  and taking that opportunity of shewing a very fine watch besides as that  is a solid pebble not an egg that opens to hold something to regale thy nose I fear it must be deemed a VAIN ornament Now ruffles keep my arms warm"  A circle gathered round the Lady who exhibited the ruffles Friend  and Mrs Berkeley They all laughed much and the poor Quaker said  "Thee beest right it is of no use I will take it off when I go home and lock it up"  When Dr Berkeley was rector of Action a female Quaker who lived in the next parish and was said to rouge her cheeks hearing the same of Dr Berkeley's preaching desired to go to Acton church with Mr and Mrs W  A day or two after Mr W  's family dining at Dr Berkeley's Mrs W  said  "Mrs  was a little out of luck last Sunday"  then related as above adding  "that ever  she  should come to hear  her people  so  tuned  "  The sentence alluded to was  "All Christians of every communion agree in this point excepting the Quakers if indeed  they  can be  styled Christians  who have no sacraments at all and who do not allow of Water Baptism despising that important denunciation of our adored Redeemer 'Except a man be born of WATER and of the Spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of Heaven"  The Friend however told Mrs W  that Dr Berkeley was a very fine Preacher  Bishop Berkeley was a  real  Patriot not a PATRIOT as that Prelate always wittily styled his own  bawling  as he called them countrymen the contrasts to himself Dean Swift Dr Madan and a very few more  temporal  At the head of the list the excellent Marquis of Waterford It has been mentioned above that Dr Berkeley had the honour to be nearly related to the Marchioness At dinner one day the Editor asked Dr Berkeley if he had redde the paper He said  "No he had been out riding"    "Why then you have not seen that the  King  has made a  Marquis of your  cozen Lord Tyrone"    "He has done very right in so doing He would not have  overpaid  him had he created him a Duke"    "Why so"    "Because Lord Tyrone has SAVED Ireland He was the ONLY man who could And he has contrived to get the arms out of the hands of the Papists when that poor  Sir  had been weak enough to put them into their hands he knowing  nothing  of the politicks of  that  kingdom How INDEED should a L  shire 'Squire"  saviours of Ireland The power of the Drapier's Letters all know Bishop Berkeley's letter to the Roman Catholics of the Diocese of Cloyne as mentioned above had its deserved attention from the wise Clergy of that communion throughout the nation The lower rank of Roman Catholics all round the neighbourhood of Cloyne with one voice used to declare that  they  did not trouble themselves who had the  best right  to the Crown King George or King Charles  "but my Lord  ie  the Bishop knew very welland they would therefore  fight  for whoever his Lordship  bid them  "  One Popish gentleman alas forfeited his vast estate at the age of  only eighteen  for having raised some of his tenants in the service of King James  just after the battle of the Boyne he had not marched them off his own estate but  unluckily that  estate lying conveniently for two of his Protestant relations it was  forfeited  and HE reduced to  extreme  poverty residing in a cottage with a wife and two daughters When Bishop Berkeley went to reside at Cloyne in the year he found the  unfortunate  Mr Fitzgerald as above described and in his grand climacteric He habited him comfortably gave him an invitation to dine at the palace every day bought him a quiet horse on which he rode out in fine weather the Bishop keeping it and one of his grooms attending to it When any person dined at the palace beside the Bishop's family Mr Fitzgerald at his own entreaty always dined at the steward's table to whose room he every day retired to smoke his pipe Dr Berkeley and his brother when there was not company frequently attending this  "  Cullen of other times  "  to hear as youths and girls of sense always wish to do what was transacted before their  parents  were born  Mr Fitzgerald had a small potatoe ground and two cows The Editor honours the lower ranks of people in Ireland for their kindness to their  fallen  superiors As Mrs Fitzgerald kept no maid the neighbouring poor women milked her cows made her butter scalded her vessels c saying often to the Bishop's Lady  "that it was not  fitten  the  poor Laady  and her daughters should do such drudgery"  so  they amongst them did it for them Bishop Berkeley on his leaving Ireland to go to reside at Oxford to superintend his Son's education there left a certain establishment at Cloyne Mr Fitzgerald dined there every day as usual his horse being kept c  On hearing of the death of Bishop Berkeley he exclaimed  "My  only  friend is gone"  leaned back on his chair and instantly expired He died speaking the truth  The Editor has no doubt the worthy successor of Bishop Berkeley would have continued the same amiable attention for although Bishop Stopford grandfather of the very worthy Earl of Courtown was esteemed a very covetous manperhaps he was a saving man a  very  different thingthe Editor feels pleasure in an opportunity of publishing the conduct of  "  dear Jemmy  "  as Bishop Berkeley always styled Bishop Stopford Dr Berkeley's Mother one day saying  "Your Father kept every thing in as good repair as you do for at his death  even Stopford could  not make  any  demand for dilapidations"  To which Dr Berkeley replied  "Pardon me my dear Madam it was that he  would  not saying 'I will not have  any  thing overlooked for  I  will not take a shilling dilapidation from the family of my dear friend Bishop Berkeley"  The Editor cannot here refrain from relating a  bon mot  of her honoured Fatherinlaw which if she could envy  any  body  any  thing she should envy Bishop Berkeley His predecessor once on a visit at Cloyne to Bishop Berkeley asserted a vast circle at the table that  "  all  mankind were either KNAVES or FOOLS"  Bishop Berkeley instantly said  "Pray my good Lord to which class does your Lordship belong"  He hummed a little while then replied  "Why I believe to  both  "  Bishop Berkeley made a graceful  assenting  bow and when relating the ancedote used to say  "there never was a  truer  character given by manof  any  man"  as he conceived for the Editor has frequently heard Mrs Berkeley say that neither of the Earls his kinsmen who divided his  estate ever gave him a shilling It was not pleasant to them to hear him named  One day when they their ladies and families had dined at Bishop Berkeley's just as the coaches were driving out of the courtyard a violent clamour was heard  scolding screaming crying  It was alas poor Mrs Fitzgerald and her daughters reproaching their noble rich not alas very  "  rich in good works  c kindred with  "avarice and cruelty enjoying  their  estate and leaving them to starve but for the good Bishop"  The very grateful Mr Fitzgerald had made a will  The Editor has frequently been told by Bishop Berkeley's learned agreeable friend Richard Dalton Esquire that his friend Sir John James Baronet told Bishop Benson that he had bequeathed his very large estate excepting a few legacies to his dear friend Bishop Berkeley Bishop Benson wrote what he lovely man thought the  pleasant  news to Cloyne and received in return a  thundering  letter as Mr Dalton termed it saying  "Do  you  tell JAMES that  I  will NOT have his fortune Bid him leave it to his RELATIONS I WON'T have it"  Sir John on hearing this bequeathed it to the old Chevalier de St Georgeso of course his relations got it He had after Bishop Berkeley went to Cloyne boceme a Papist A very long letter of Bishop Berkeley to Sir John James on that occasion is one of the letters which will compose part of the second volume of "Berkeley's Literary Relics" if it is ever printed as also a very curious singular case of conscience submitted  to  nad determined  by  another eminent Prelate of the Church of England  which was sent to Mr Berkeley at Christ's College bequeathing in case the House of Stuart should ever come to the throne and  the poor  PROPRIETORS have their estates restored his WHOLE property excepting fortunes to his two daughters to Bishop Berkeley's eldest son and requesting the  possible  King to grant the title conferred on him by King James of Baron Monteagle  on  the Bishop's son  Neither Doctor Berkeley nor his Son could ever be persuaded by their friends to go to Court and be presented without any cause calling them thither Both laughed at the idea of almost every Country 'Squire and unpreferred Divine going to St James's He used to answer one old friend who often urged him on the subject by saying  "When his Majesty  wants  me he will send for me he knows who I am and where I live and my curate that surely finest of all fine Preachers the late pious Mr Harmer goes frequently and that is enough"  Dr Berkeley felt gratified by a gentleman of his Majesty's household once telling him that on asking leave of absence for a few days his Royal Master asked whither he was going he replied  "To Dr Berkeley's at Cookham"  His Majesty said  "  His Father was an honour to human nature  "  His Majesty had not a more active zealous friend than Dr Berkeley nor certainly a  more disinterested one  Dr Berkeley was at a very great expence to disperse his famous Sermon on the thirtieth of January Only a few months before his lamented death he printed the sixth edition on common paper and had one thousand of them dispersed over England On its first publication it went through five editions in four weeks He has repeatedly told the Editor that the notes of the fifth edition in small duodecimo not now to be purchased for any sum are all except one answers to letters from  "Lords and Gentlemen"  some admiring some with Nicodemus enquiring  "How can these things be  See the third chapter of the Holy Gospel as recorded by Saint John  "  To have answered all the letters received on that Sermon he said would have taken a ream of paper One from the Editor's not Dr Berkeley's  old  acquaintance Soame Jenyns written a very short time before the death of that entertaining agreeable great genius and at length devout Christian is carefully preserved by the Editor who lately found an odd glove in her cabinet that happened to be dropped by a beloved friend the last time she ever visited her about twenty years ago The Editor has a picture of her friend and other  souvenirs  yet the glove is still preserved with care Why is it perhaps it brings the  last  idea of the beloved object to the mind One knows not why else Perhaps the  mind  of  man can never be fully defined by  man  yet it is a delightful study surely next to observing the wonderful ways of PROVIDENCE Of  both  like the late Queen of Prussia on her deathbed as related by her Royal Descendant  See "Memoirs of the House of Brandenburg" written by the late King of Prussia  before  his acquaintance with Voltaire the Editor hopes ere long to know more  Perhaps two sincerer more disinterested patriots have not existed in  any  country at  any  time than Bishop Berkeley and his son Dr Berkeley both very great politicians The Bishop publicly his son more quietly frequently suggested hints to the minister for the time being for the benefit of the country some of which he had the pleasure of seeing were attended to although the letters when the advice was thus conveyed were generally anonymous he using to say  "If the advice is wise a man of sense will attend to it come how it may"  adding  "I write frequently to Mr Pitt and sometimes send him a message"  Dr Berkeley suggested and it was attended to some additional benefit for the poor common soldiers The Editor is no politiciannot that she does not esteem  females equal  to politics Sir Robert Walpole used to say that an old friend of the Editor's Father Mrs Waller of HallBarn near Beaconsfield grandmother of the present  Mr Waller  "  understood the interests of this nation better than any man in it  "  Mrs Waller a daughter of old Aislabie's had a very superior understanding  Dr Berkeley was universally admired as a letterwriter he wrote such  The Editor fears to set down lest it should seem incredible during Archbishop Secker's life the annual amount of the postage of Dr Berkeley's lettersthe Editor always keeps the letteraccompt separate and an heavy enough accompt it is most years even her own nowwhen her beloved friends were living it was sometimes quite frightfuland after his Grace's death numbers of persons who had never seen his face wrote to him to request his advice how to get a place or preferment He benevolently answered them all and generally directed them into a track that led them right The plan he pursued was once practised  against  himself At the election of the late amiable Lord Lichfield when standing for the Chancellorship of the University of Oxford during the reign of George the Second his Lordship being an honest Tory was likely to be  hardrun  His Lordship lamenting one day to a relation of the Editor the late sensible cynical Richard Rowney Esquire Fellow of AllSouls College that he feared Mr Berkeley of Christ College would not vote for him asked if Mr Powney had any interest with Dr Berkeley just then made Vicar of Bray Ive's Place is in Bray Parish The Editor's acute kinsman replied that he could not take the liberty to ask Mr Berkeley for his vote but added  "  I can put you  in a way to SECURE IT if you are acquainted with the Archbishop of Canterbury"  Lord Lichfield replied  "Yes intimately so"    "Oh then I'll  promise you  Mr Berkeley's voteGo  yourself  to Lambeth and request his Grace to  ask  Mr Berkeley to vote for you"  The advice was exactly followed The Editor has repeatedly heard Dr Berkeley relate to various personsit happened before she was acquainted with Dr Berkeleythe Archbishop wrote to Dr Berkeley the letter still exists Dr Berkeley answered it  per  return of post telling his Grace that according to  one  statute he had sworn to observe Lord Lichfield was not eligible and although he respected Lord Lichfield his conscience would not permit him to vote for himthat he had always determined not to vote  against  him and most sincerely wished he might be elected Chancellor Soon after Dr Berkeley went to stay at Lambeth he told his Grace that such a statute said so and so His Grace replied  "HAH I believe it may but I never understood it so before You were or are quite right Sir in not voting for Lord Lichfield for according to that he is or wasthe Editor forgets whether this conversation was prior or subsequent to the election QUITE RIGHT IN NOT voting for his Lordship"  As the Editor does not read Latin  she  is no judge of this matter but she knows it is happy for the poor patients in the Infirmary that his Lordship was Chancellor  numbers so alertly for his friends and  common acquaintances to serve them indeed the chief business of the  trio  Father Son and Grandson seemed to be to assist serve and benefit every one but  themselves  It is supposed by many that knew him through life in early life and until nearly the latest period of life that Dr Berkeley had by his advice direction and assistance made the fortunes of more men than any private person not in station to do it than any man in the three kingdoms so as sometimes to occasion Mrs Berkeley to say to him  "My dear friend you can make every man's fortune or put him in train to do it himself  but your son's  why do you not try to get some appointment for him to help him until he can at least  will  help himself by going to the Bar"  His constant reply was  "Alas no poor fellow I cannot ask any thing for him or for myself He must make his own fortune for me God may raise him some friends"  Mr Monck Berkeley by his Mother's earnest advice to him in youth never meddled with politics she always telling him it was time enough if ever he should be in a station to require it How many creatures stamp themselves for fools by bawling for or against a party when they have hardly left bawling for a good whipping  A gentleman many years ago said to the Editor  "What a man Dr Berkeley is"  The day before yesterday at  some public dinner it was said that an officer one of the company was going to Ireland Some one asked  "if he had many acquaintances in that kingdom"    "Not one"  Dr Berkeley politely asked  "in what part the Colonel's regiment was quartered"  and then said  "I will do myself the pleasure of giving you two letters Sir that perhaps may be of some little service to you although they are very hospitable in Ireland"  He called for pen ink and paper twirled his chair round to a small table and in I think little more than five minutes produced two such letters to the Colonel we all talking and babbling the whole time as I am sure I could not have written in five hours  "My Gd what a clever fellow he is"  Mrs Frinsham sometimes when going into the library and seeing half a score letters lying on the table would say  "Well well what a pity it was your father did not  put  you 'prentice to be Secretary of State  You would have  scribbled  away  so finely  to all the  princes  and  potentates  that it would have  done their hearts good  to read your epistles"  To which as when many persons have said  "How remarkably Dr Berkeley's talents seem calculated for the diplomatic line"    "My dear Donna Anna Mrs Frinsham's nickname amongst her intimate friends I would not  have  been put  'prentice  to any thing but a clergyman  no  not if at twentytwo and an half I had received a revelation from Heaven that I never should have had any thing more than a curacy of forty pounds a year through life"  Not many days before Dr Berkeley's lamented death the Editor consoling him with the delightful thought that he had been a most zealous preacher of Christ not elegant MORAL essays from Plutarch or Seneca he lifted up his still exquisitely fine eyes on her and replied  "I have my dear and HE knows I preached him in SINCERITY  You know  I always  dreaded  being a popular preacher I never wished to please men from the pulpit"  Bishop Berkeley and his grandson both assumed an additional motto of their own choosing as did Mr Cherry  "CONSCIENTIA MILLE TESTES"  Dr Berkeley contented himself with the beautiful blessed one of his ancestors  "DIEU AVEC NOUS"  The Bishop's was  "NON  SIBI SED TOTI"  Mr Monck Berkeley's assumed by him when he was about or rather under twenty on an almost miraculous preservation of the life of himself two other gentlemen his intimate friends still living and their postillion and horses  "VIVAT POST FUNERA VIRTUS"  which he engraved in the strings of his crest as is seen in the print prefixed to the Poems That Mr Berkeley from his cradle or rather  no  cradle as has been before stated to his coffin had numerous hairbreadth escapes from death has been mentioned Some time  after  his death two  very extraordinary  things occurred which will not be here related one very soon after his interment to an entire stranger to every thing but his name having never even  seen him  the other to his Mother about five months after his decease  The Editor again begs pardon for trespassing so long on the public and wishes that she resembled her excellent Son in many instances particularly in burning without mercy not as he did whole quires at a time of beautiful Essays Poems c for in early youth  her manuscripts  consisted only of innumerable letters to friends which she trusts they consigned to the flames and a diary of her own  very unimportant  life from the age of seventeen when being a very early riser in summer and her mother never coming out of her closet to  breakfast  until ten o'clock for the family prayers at Mr Frinsham's were the Editor  thinks very inconveniently not offered up until  after  breakfast when tradespeople are coming and the door must be answered in private familiesexcepting at the house of the late excellent Mr and Mrs Peirce of Windsor Forest who either in town or country never suffered even the kitchenmaid or groom to answer the door until prayers lessons and psalms were gone through At Lambeth Palace during Archbishop Secker's life every servant including the  porter  went into the chapel at nine in the morning Dr Berkeley and the Editor when resident at Acton were one morning a very few minutes too latethe footman dismounted and knocked violentlyDr Berkeley assured him it was in vain so the glasses were drawn up and in about half an hour the gates were opened The Editor on her marriage found the custom at Dr Berkeley's much better that of assembling before breakfast at nine o'clock perhaps not always quite so punctually to a  minute  as did for more than half a century the pious mother of that just Judge Sir W H Ashhurst What a blessing to individuals sometimes to thousands is a wise pious mother  The Editor has frequently heard her mother say  "that the mother of Judge Buller although the daughter of Bishop Trelawny was an angel on earth"  she has been one in heaven almost half a century The late worthy charitable Marchioness of Abercorn was a granddaughter  of this lady The  poor  lamented bitterly at the death of both these ladies  The Editor's idea is perhaps in  most  things an  almost  universal one  to take most care of the most valuable things  She takes more care of a little fine Dresden china than she does of her milkpans and as she used frequently to tell her dear amiable old friend the late Lord  when he used to tell her  "that she took too much care of her soul going to church on weekdays and Sunday afternoons that it were better to stay and chat with her friends"  Her constant reply was  "This little  insignificant  frame of mine  must be laid in the dust one day or other  sooner or later but the  little spark  within  must  exist FOR EVER therefore  I  must take some  little  care about it say what you will and if  I  cannot make  you  take a little more care of the spark that animates  your noble  case why hereafter  I  shall be  noble  and  you ignoble  "  Alas dear amiable friend my mind cannot follow thee with delight beyond thy grave but leave thee in the hands of HIM that  "  judgeth right  "  Thou certainly wert not of the number of those to whom the Psalmist prays God  "  not  to be merciful"  for thou didst NOT  "  offend of malicious wickedness  "  Thou wert neither  profane Deist  nor  Arian  Thou hadst a simple ignorant thoughtless mother and no father from five years old  If the Editor by any thing contained in these sheets should induce  any  in a certain rank of life of her fair she corrects herself she means her RED countrywomen for  almost  all are now become ROUGE DRAGONS to attend a  little  to the education of their children and not devolve that  very very  important charge upon in general a poor ignorant lowlived  foreign  animal with no other recommendation than that she  cannot  speak  English    It has been of late years much the fashion to decry schools for girls The Editor notwithstanding the wish of her amiable friend Lord Lyttelton that she might have  "half a dozen girls to educate"  having neither daughter nor niece and not very intimate with many of her kindred that have girls knows little of schools but thus much she knows of  Swiss  and  French  governesses that the schools must be  bad indeed  if not better than  these gouvernantes  The Swiss  gouvernante  at Lord  's used regularly when Lady  was in the country and gone visiting to take the young ladies in the evening to  visit  and drink  hot elder wine  with the hucksters the bakers the butchers wives of the neighbouring village and sometimes to drink tea c with some of her more distant friends the farmers'  ladies  This the Editor knows from ocular demonstration The following  fact was many years ago related with horror to the Editor by Lady P    Going one morning in town to call on her cousingerman the late Lady  who not being up sent her little girl aged eight years to entertain her the young lady soon began  such  a conversation as was terrifying On being asked  "what could make her talk thus"  Young Lady  "Why to make you laugh"  Lady P    "Make me laugh child Why I am ready to run up the chimney I am so frightened to hear you Whom have you ever heard talk so tell me directly or I will tell your Mamma"  Young Lady  "Why Mademoiselle and Papa's Gentleman and they do laugh so at it that I thought it would make you laugh"  This illfated illeducated young Lady when  completely  educated made Mamma weep instead of Mademoiselle laugh  The unfortunate Lady  soon after she married Lord  told several of her friends  "that she wondered she was not a streetwalker for that she generally  spent every evening whilst the family were in town in a  nightcellar  with her governess when her  careful  mother thought her in bed"  This unhappy woman has been long divorced and is not  re  married She was some few years ago at a waterdrinking place no living soul noticing her an object of great compassion to the Editor who never doing  any  thing in haste was meditating on calling upon her but a very few days ended those charitable meditations for her Ladyship alas for her poor creature was soon exhibited leaning on the arm of an  hostler  Ah me her careless mother must one day meet this injured castoff daughter and hear her call aloud for vengeance on her horrid cruel negligence What will she then do  A few years ago a lady asked the Editor if she was acquainted with Lady  She answered  "I have not that honour I only know and revere as all must do her great worthiness of character"  The Lady replied  "Alasaday a friend of hers is almost frantic on her account She has got a devil incarnate for governess to Lady Charlotte It is certainly known that in her own country she was an adulteress and many assert the murderer of her husband and she is so artful so insinuating a creature and has so wound herself in by her seeming worthiness with Lady  that she will not  believe a syllable against her although she has heard it from several of her friends and I think you might perhaps find some method to convince Lady  what a  wretch  she is"  The Editor assured Lady  that she was unequal to the task it must for her be left to God Probably his mercy kept the wretch's mask on for Lady Charlotte has been married several years and the Editor has not seen  her  name in the newspapers as being handed up to Doctors Commons May she never carry any grist to that mill not for grinding  old  women young but reducing  young  women to a  worse  condition than even old ones  Does not the Almighty exclaim by the Prophet Jeremiah  "Shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this  Jer ch v ver  "  The Almighty does not expressly confine that TREMENDOUS threat of His being  avenged  to the Jewish nation but on  any  which is guilty of that  dreadful crime  placed  second  to murder in the Decalogue written by the  finger  of GOD himself on Mount Sinai It would exceedingly delight the Editor if she thought that any of the fine ladies and fine gentlemen described in the first ten verses of the fifth chapter of the Prophecy of Jeremiah who may chance to read this whilst their hair is dressing may be benefited by it it being customary with many  people to read some  trumpery  book at that time the Editor generally reads in an old thumbed Bible for the powder and pomatum would spoil a good one to her maid which she hopes benefits both parties she means it should as she explains as she reads or rather when she is requested to lay down the book because while the frizzing c is performing the reading cannot go on especially as the Editor is shortsighted  It is now and then some consolation to the Editor who hopes these nations may be spared from French brutality a little longer at least till she has made her exit when she hears these lamentable divorce bills sued for that she recollects that at the time of publishing a  magnificent  edition of the works of that patron of ADULTERY that vile  inciter  to it that MONSTER Voltaire it was said  "  every  CHRISTIAN Prince in Europe had subscribed to it but the King of England"  The Editor very well remembers her beloved Partner's comment on it  "I am sure HE has  shewn himself a Christian  by  not  doing it and God will reward him for it  Dr Berkeley on leaving Lambeth Palace after some days visit on his return to Berkshire when he came just to the entrance of the Park recollecting that there was a poor dying Prelate at Knightsbridge called his servant and sent him with an  howd'ye  saying  "I will wait here that you may not heat the horse a very fine one to overtake me"  Just then his Majesty rode up Dr Berkeley's wonderfully fine face caught his Majesty's eyeTurning to the attendant Lord he said  "Whose coach is that my Lord"    "Please your Majesty I cannot tell"    "I want to know"  His Majesty rode round and looked inDr Berkeley  solus  His Majesty asked another attendant At length Dr Berkeley heard some gentleman say  "His name is Berkeley for the man's arms are the ten crosses"  Dr Berkeley once said to Mr Monck Berkeley  "Alas child  we  have crosses enough"  in their arms The Editor said she hoped SHE did not make the  ten eleven  Both laughed and proceeded to talk of something pleasanter  "  The old Prophet Jeremiah would be a very excellent tutor to many  very fine  people of both sexes as the third chapter of Isaiah would to many of the  quondam  fair now RED sex The Editor recollects that there  is  a text in her  oldfashioned  book a kind of THREAT to ladies  "  thou rendest thy face with  PAINTING"  It is we see so  very oldfashioned  one wonders that fine  ton  ladies practise it The poor old  immensely  vulgar Editor does honestly own it  ever did ever must  whilst she retains her senses occasion her  not respecting  although she  loves  some who do it  As the Editor is writing this her sister is reading to her the direful catastrophe of Lord C  T  About three years ago the Editor was told by her friends that she ought to write a Preface to her dear Son's Poems when she determined to give the opinion of two wise men and her  own  although an imbecile female of a book which Dr Berkeley declared he esteemed to be the first the best work of this century Mr Monck Berkeley said that if young men of  sense  would read it  only cursorily that it must  prevent their gambling The Editor charmed with it on reading only thirtyfive pages of the first volume then at Canterbury laid it down put on her hat and cloak and posted off into the city to the bookseller's to subscribe for herselfher sister then at her own abodeand her Son then abroad Mrs Berkeley ever delighting to benefit her fellow creatures in her  very narrow sphere  did many of her friends the  kindness  to  compel  them to subscribe to "A Treatise on SUICIDE GAMING and DUELLING by the Reverend Charles Moore of Boughton Blean Kent" The Editor used constantly when soliciting subscriptions after the publication of the first incomparable volume to say  "It is for your  own  sake not Mr Moore's although he is a very old acquaintance a very highly respected friend"  On Dr Berkeley's going to Cookham in the summer Mrs Berkeley invited several of her Berkshire friends and neighbours to subscribe Among these was her very worthy respected neighbour Lady Y  who replied  "Oh my dear Mrs Berkeley  I can't afford it  "  "Can't afford it Poor soul Shall  I lend you a Guinea  Why I did not bring my husband  quite  fourscore thousand pounds and yet  I  have afforded it who laid it down as a rule since I had children never to buy a book but at a stall I do not think my friend Sir George will either thrash or scold you"    "No no but I can't afford it"  Mrs Berkeley declared she would not lend it her unless she  would  subscribe another neighbour did as the sequel of the little tale will shew Two or three evenings after Mrs Berkeley called on Lady Y  to ask if she would take a walk with her to view the progress of her Ladyship's castle of  then building On the servant's announcing Mrs Berkeley her Ladyship sprang from the sopha exclaiming  "My dear Madam I am  so  happy to see you you cannot imagine I have been this hour determining every minute to go to you to ask if I am too late to subscribe to Mr Moore It is surely the most excellent book I have redde a long time Do pray take my Guinea"all that Mr Moore would suffer to be paid for those two excellent volumes in quarto"I was not able to quit it and luckily you are come"  The Editor would not take this Lady's subscription for she never receives any money but what is her own due lest as she tells her friends as we say in Scotland  "  She is not o'er rich  "  she should forget and spend it on herself to prevent which when compelled to be  treasurer  for any friend for a few weeks she always seals it up and writes on it to whom it belongs She however promised to write directly to her worthy old acquaintance Mr Rivington to learn about the matter and the name of POOR Lady Y  appears in the additional list of subscribers  Some time afterwards this worthy friend of the Editor at her request procured a very advantageous appointment in the army in India for the eldest son of Mr Moore who although a very excellent scholar as Dr Berkeley told the Editor was resolved to be a warrior and we had then happy days  The Editor although No politician is  "clearly for carrying on the war"  until there is  some  established government in France with whom to make peace or peace may be much more  horrible  than war It is like a  silly  girl  marrying because  she has a  stern  father or a  cross  mother Poor souls  no war of our own in Europe Mr Moore and his Lady and the Editor dares believe the young gentleman felt great gratitude to good Lady Y  for exerting her influence with her brotherinlaw Sir J  C  The Editor wishes that for the benefit of society Mr Moore would put forth an edition in halfcrown numbers There are anecdotes enough to furnish a fine print for  every  number for as Mr Monck Berkeley used to say  "it is as entertaining as a novel with this difference that the facts are real and as pious as Thomas à Kempis"  Thousands would then read and profit by it who otherwise will never hear of it  Bishop Berkeley used to say  "If I had the voice of Stentor I would become hoarse in calling on all particularly on persons of high rank  Take care of the education of your children  "  If my Lord M  s has done so he may  meet his children in a more august court than that of St James's without horror  See a most excellent sermon of the pious learned Dr Doddridge  "  on children's turning out wicked  "  "if not perhaps it might be wise in him to place himself in the situation before the throne of mercy in which thirtysix years ago in the summer of he thought proper to place Mr C  a very respectable Gloucestershire gentleman at the Swan Inn at Cheltenham on  both  his knees begging this GREAT man's pardon not only all the gentlemen who dined there witnessing it but all the town the sashes being up standing on each others' shoulders to behold so wonderfully NOBLE a conduct  At the time when this circumstance happened the Editor and her sister were returning from drinking tea at the rooms to their lodgings below the Swan Inn such a crowd none could pass after waiting some time they desired their footman to push through and learn what occasioned this violent concourse After some time the servant returned he was a very worthy Gloucestershire man so knew Mr C  saying  "Oh Madam it is young Mr C  upon his knees begging pardon of an Officer"  Both the Miss Frinshams at the same instant  "  Upon his knees  "  Servant  "Yes Madam and he is making a long speech and all the gentlemen are standing round them looking very grave"  The next morning the walks echoed with this wonderful transaction  Three of the Editor's old intimate friends the late Sir William and Sir Septimius then Colonel Robinson and the sensible worthy Philip Sharpe Esquire Clerk of the Privy Council lamented over Mr C  's having unluckily said  "that he understood not the use of the sword could not fight"  that declaration all present agreed produced the genuflexion Cheltenham rang with this NOBLE deed during the season It determined the Editor then a young single woman that if ever she did marry and should produce a son  he  should learn to  use  a sword although she trusted he might never meet with a son of the noble M  never draw it in any private quarrel  Mr Monck Berkeley had the honour the  pleasure  to be well known to the  "sweet amiable Lord L  "  eldest son of the M  as he termed him on the Editor's asking in her wonted way  "What is he or she like"  It may be hoped this dire calamity may bring this NOBLE M  on  his  knees  The idea of a nobleman or gentleman upon their knees to  any  BUT God brings to the Editor's mind a circumstance of a noble Duke upon his knees not to beg pardon repeatedly related to her by her Mother  It has been mentioned before that the great controversial writer Charles Leslie greatgrandson of the excellent Bishop of Rothes the only  Scotch  friend of the unfortunate Queen Mary as good Sir Nicholas Throcmorton was her only English one spent much time at Mr Cherry's  Mr Leslie was staying with Mr Cherry at his house in town at the time of the great storm in Mr Cherry's Lady always winter as well as summer rose every morning at six o'clock until within two years of her death at when she lay till seven She never went to rest till between twelve and one Her daughter Mrs Frinsham and one of her granddaughters not the Editor could live almost without sleep Mrs Cherry used to say  finches  were early birds In the morning at halfpast five when the housemaid went in to light Mrs Cherry's fire Mr Leslie followed her in saying  "Is the report true or are my good friends living"  Both at once blessed the mercy of God that they were He replied  "The whole street have been up all night except yourselves and are telling each other 'Ah poor Mr Cherry's family they are all killed servants and all' I lay till my bed was quite covered with bricks from the chimneyI then got up and went to the farther corner and have sat there ever since the first hour"  Mr Cherry had gone up to see after his little girlstheir excellent French governess entreated him not to awake them so they slept through it  where she had often heard the following little anecdote related by Mr Leslie as the origin of Mr Leslie's  "FOUR SHORT MARKS"  to ascertain the truth of historic facts related  as having past long since and which the Editor has repeatedly heard from many learned men cost the late Dr Conyers Middleton twenty years' trying but all in vain to refute  An excellent lady a friend of Mr Cherry was very intimate with the then Duke of Leeds who was a Deist They often disputed on the subject The lady happened one day to lament that although the Duke would never pervert her to Deism she should never be able to convert him to Christianity for he took all her arguments to pieces In short his Grace was a better logician than the lady who said  "Now if Mr Leslie would teach me some arguments I could urge them and perhaps rescue my noble friend from his sad error"  Mr Leslie replied  "I will endeavour to furnish you with some arguments that if his Grace has an  honest  mind will convince him of the truth of Revelation"  Accordingly the  four marks  were given to her and she soon produced them to her noble friend  The next morning as early as it was proper to send to a fine lady perhaps  rather  earlier at the end of the seventeenth than at the close of the eighteenth century the Duke sent to request that the lady would have the goodness to desire the gentleman who had written that paper to visit him with her On Mr Leslie's entering the apartment the  Duke went towards him and like Cornelius to Saint Peter  Acts chap x  fell on his knees burst into tears thanked him and besought him to pray to God to forgive the having lived so long in ignorance and error said that he had sat up the whole night reading it over and over impatient for the arrival of the morning to see and bless the hand that had rescued him from eternal misery  Whoever has as honest a mind as this wise excellent Duke may read these FOUR MARKS almost  verbatim  transcribed by the pious Mr Nelson in  the Monday and Tuesday in WhitsunWeek  in his "Feasts and Fasts" The very learned late Reverend Meredith Jones Rector of Guestling Prebendary of Chichester Chaplain to the present Bishop of Chichester in a most incomparable work of his written when a young man without his name and printed for B White in says  "I defy any  honest  Arian not to be convinced by the proofs here produced"  The book is almost as scarce as it is excellent It proves that the filiation of the SAVIOUR of the WORLD did  not  commence until after the angel Gabriel had been sent to the Blessed Virgin The excellent and very deeply learned Mr Romaine says that the distinction in the Trinity of Father Son and Holy Ghost are only  office  names for he was oldfashioned enough to believe that in this Trinity none was  greater or less than another c See the Anathasian Creed  The book on which the witty Frank Coventry has placed his  hero  POMPEY  "the little"  when conversing with his  friend  PUSS in his old mistress's closet The Editor cannot here forbear setting down  her idea  of the TRIUNE God at  seven  years old Earnestly reading on Saintsdays c this  oldfashioned  creed she puzzled her little  over  inquisitive brain to find out some similitude at length standing one evening by the cardtable when the family c were playing quadrille Basto was played and lying some time alone on the table it occured to her young mind that the ace of clubs was the emblem of the TRIUNE Godthis entirely satisfied all her  sceptical  doubts at seven years old and they have never blessed be God troubled her since It was a wonderfully odd idea for a child but it entirely delivered her parents from her worrying to explain the Trinity to her  The very learned Mr Hawtry has lately published a similar work for  very  learned persons Few females of the Editor's acquaintance excepting her two old friends and namesakes Mesdames Eliza Carter and Eliza Lawrencethe latter styled by Dr Johnson  "The English Sappho"  are perhaps qualified to understand all its merits Probably not the learned Miss  of whom the Editor has heard her son speak who have a little Greek  "a little learning is a dangerous thing"  would always call the Roman orator  Kickero  A boy should have received a  kick  for such folly Mr Monck Berkeley detested every kind of affection as much as his Mother He delighted much in the conversation of the two abovenamed uncommonly sensible as well as very learned ladies The Editor has frequently heard Dr Berkeley say he would prefer were he to publish a Greek work the criticism of Miss Eliza Lawrence now  Lady of the member for Canterbury to most men he knew These two  really  learned ladies are also two of the best housewives that the Editor knowsShe thinks that in that  absolutely necessary  knowledge both these learned ladies  equal  her ignorant  self  The title of Mr Meredith Jones's work is "The Doctrine of the TRINITY as it stands deduced by the Light of REASON from the DATA laid down in the SCRIPTURES to which are added some Remarks on the ARIAN CONTROVERSY also a POSTSCRIPT containing some Observations on the Writings of Justin Martyr and Irenaeus"  The Editor trusts for her own sake as well as that of others that she draws near a conclusion of this  very  long Preface not quite unexampled for one of the acutest writers of the latter end of the last century that wonderful genius Charles Leslie in his incomparable book intituled "THE SNAKE IN THE GRASS  Perhaps it might not be amiss if some of our learned Divines who are such strenuous advocates for  universal unlimited  toleration to  all  the open and  sly  underminers of the excellent Church of Englanduntil she as in the last century receives  her  toleration from them when Archbishop Usher taught school for a groat a week and two poor suffragan Bishops Joseph Hall and Jeremy Taylor for twopence a weekif these learned modern Divines would take a hint from an aged Matron and now that Leslie's Snake is coming  boldly out  of the grass just peep upon him  in  the grassthey might be better prepared to encounter his  hissing  has made his preface considerably  longer than the Work itself The Editor is conscious that she ought hardly to presume to write  her  name in the same paragraph with that great man yet is certain that she has the happiness to resemble him in  one  thinga most ardent wish to advance the glory of GOD and the salvation of souls She hopes for pardon at least from those  "who never give themselves the time or trouble to  consider  whether they have souls to be saved or not"  A young man now no longer an inhabitant of this sublunary world on being one day asked if a friend of his had any religion replied  "Of all the  young  men of my acquaintance I do not in my conscience believe that excepting  and  there is one that ever gives himself the time or trouble to think  whether  he has a soul to be saved"  Every one has redde the request of a pious dying father to a thoughtless dissipated sonto retire for one half hour every day into a room without either pen ink or book We are told it had the desired effecthe was COMPELLED to THINK  The Editor being oldfashioned and vulgar enough to believe a future state of rewards and punishments and wonderfully addicted when she loses a friend or an acquaintance in idea to follow them over  "the dark irremiable flood"  the river of death and to rejoice that  "whether they would hear or whether they would forbear"  for  the  generality  are most  "  thoughtless  "  that she has suggested to them that it  might  be wise to  think  a  little about  it now and then lest like the wretched Lord Chesterfield they should when too late experience what he certainly said  "If I believed one word of the Bible I would live like  "  And some years after not long before his death  "I have a frightful long journey to take in the  dark  and I do not know one step of the way"  Could one of those friends  return  to earth  how  would they reproach those who forbore to warn them to flee to the only TRUE consolation in TIME and through the countless NEVERending ages of ETERNITY  The Editor ever addicted to scribbling to composingfor she amused herself with writing two  sermons  at  eleven  years oldhas long been in the habit of composing prayers for her own  sole  use not for her own  sole  benefittakes leave here to subjoin a part of one used by her  every  morning as soon as she opens her eyes and to her wonder finds

and passion's sake of Him who went about doing good to  all  who died for all who truly call on himJesus Christ the Righteous"  The Editor daily uses the very short beautiful prayer of ARMINE NICHOL the famous pious German maid servant now as much higher as she was here holier than perhaps any of her contemporary Princesses of the whole Germanic body That every one who reads this may profit by it is the ardent wish of the Editor  Eliza Berkeley  Of Mr Monck Berkeley's genius many of those who read what he has written may be competent judges To attempt to do justice to the exquisite amiability generosity and nobleness of his heart the wonderful strength and soundness of his judgement the brilliancy of his imagination and ready wit his wonderful wilfulness in youth the great steadiness of his temper and the exquisite loveliness of his nature even in very early youth would fill a small volume which would be an entertaining one and would require the  knowledge  of the Writer of this Preface and the  pen  of his favourite Dr Johnson  Mr Berkeley like the excellent Honourable Captain Hamilton of the Lancaster man of war father of the Marquis of Abercorn never could behold a cloud of distress on any brow even on that of a perfect stranger without  not only wishing but even endeavouring to remedy or alleviate their sorrows in which they both often succeeded with high and low many curious instances of which might be related  Of the excellent amiable Captain Hamilton the Editor has frequently heard his very worthy brother the Honourable and Reverend Mr Hamilton Canon of Windsor relate the following story which shall be given in his own words  "My brother was going one day from town to dine with several of his friends at Lord  's name forgotten by the Editor It was at the time when Westminster Bridge was either building or repairing Captain Hamilton got into the great ferryboat after having seated himself he observed a middleaged farmerlike man sitting with his arms folded regardless of all that passed no one perhaps but my excellent brother would have thought of enquiring into the cause He spoke to him two or three times His answers were as laconic as might consist with civility This only served to convince my brother that the man was under some distress which it was possible he might alleviate  if he could but find it out  Accordingly he requested one of the passengers to exchange seats with him He now placed himself close to the poor man and said 'My friend you seem unhappy"  Farmer  "Yes Sir I am so  Capt H  "Can I do any thing to relieve you  Farmer  "No Sir I thank you  Capt H  "Do my poor friend tell me your distress perhaps I may be able to assist you  Farmer  "No Sir you cannot"  "Nobody but  my brother  would after this have persevered He intreated the man to tell him the cause of his distress who began thus  "Oh Sir you are so kind I must tell you About a fortnight ago a man came to my house in Devonshire telling me that a relation of mine had died very rich and left me and my brothers his money but that I must go to London to see after it or we should lose it I took him in made him very welcome and in a few days set out with him for London mounted on two of my best horses He said I must carry a pretty good bag of money  The Editor thinks it was about £  just to fee the lawyers and bear my expences in town I paid the road all the way up The morning after we came to town he took me to Westminster Hall where we saw a vast many lawyers in black gowns but  he said his lawyer was not there that day and we must go again but advised me as he was more used to London than I was to let him carry the moneybag We walked about a day or two to look at fine places and yesterday we got in one place into a great crowd and I lost him I have been looking for him and for the inn where we lodged and cannot for the life of me find either I am afraid the man is a rogue and I shall lose all my money but that I do not value if I could but have got my poor horses for they are very fine and worth a deal of money"  "My brother asked him in what part of the town his inn lay"He replied "That never having been in town before he knew not nor the sign of the inn only that it had  great gates  'My brother said 'Well my friend instead of going to my friends you and I will go back to London in the boat and try to find your inn and your horses'  "The poor man's countenance brightened They returned set out on this benevolent wildgoose chase my brother charging the man to keep fast hold of him if they got into any crowd Every inn from Whitehall quite through the City the Strand and Holborn was shewn to him After some hours they got into Aldersgate Street at the upper end of which the poor man exclaimed 'Oh God bless  you Sir  this is the inn  ' He flew into the yard went to the stable where stood his two fine horses which the sharper had not taken away My brother enquired if he did not want money to take him home the honest man replied 'No God reward you Sir luckily I took three guineas loose in my pocket before I gave him the bag to take care of"  The angelichearted Captain Hamilton left his party to dine without him and joined them not until the next day It is almost superfluous to add that whilst he resided at Bearhill House in Berkshire he was the idol of all his neighbours high and lowHe enjoyed the  "Peace of God"  which made him ever chearful and he had wonderful goodwill towards man An attempt to describe the sincere lamentations at his early one must not presume to add untimely death  The Editor cannot forbear to insert here part of a letter written at the time by an old intimate friend of her early youththe  learned benevolent  author  of  "  Christianity not founded on argument  "  "Your excellent neighbour poor Captain Hamilton got on the keel of the boat three times and was washed off again He humbly earnestly begged the sailors pardon for having brought them into such peril told them how merciful God was in granting them that little time to fly to Christ for mercy He preached like an Apostle Upon my word Christianity  cuts a noble figure  in the hands of such an hero"  A naval officer not many months ago told the Editor what she never heard before that Captain Hamilton had not been drowned at last but that he was pinionedhe was endeavouring to take off his coat when the waves washed him off the third time Who can reget that he went to glory in Heaven so many years sooner than by the course of nature  would be as vain as fruitless  This excellent man lived to Christ was owned by him in death and is now rejoicing with him in glory Captain Hamilton was convinced that not every one that  saith  "Lord Lord"  shall enter into the kingdom of Heaven He acted as well as talked like a Christian having constantly prayers twice every day onboard his ship and when on land his family was constantly assembled as often An eminent Divine says although Adam's sin does yet grace does not run in the veins Captain Hamilton's mother was NOT a saint  i e sancta  like himself  Mr Berkeley's mind from the time he could articulate appeared to be of so very extraordinary and singular a turn as determined his Mother to watch over him with the utmost vigilance during the time that to use the language of the wise Lord Halifax in his Advice to his Daughter  "We are entirely under your government and indeed through life you have so much influence over us that it behoves us to take the greatest care that you females are well educated"  Mr Berkeley when grown up used frequently to say  "Let a man commit whatever he can except the not being  a good Greek or Latin scholar my Mother constantly says That was his Mother's fault poor young man"  Mrs Berkeley as constantly charged the improper behaviour of young ladies on the father  if  he was a man who had lived in the world It would be cruel to charge it on a man entirely devoted to study but there are few such now amongst persons of a certain rank in society  Mrs Berkeley from long observation saw how naturally youths are attached to the mother and girls to the father The reason is obvious The mother is not finding fault with her Son's slovenly Latin and Greek exercises nor the father of the young lady's monkeytricks when she should be learning History Geography Drawing Music c so much as often to occasion the late excellent Lady P  the bosomfriend from early infancy of the Editor to say  "It was impossible that children particularly girls should love a mother that did her duty as she ought by them"  She as her friend always assured her she would experienced the contrary Her children when they grew up were lovely and loved her much She was indeed lovely she has frequently wept with vexation that she had not the clam not to be shaken steadiness of mr Berkeley's mother It was perhaps according to the old French proverb  "  Dieu donne la robe selon le froid  "  Mr Berkeley's maternal grandfather with the same lovely nature as Mr  Berkeley had when a child of only four years and an half old on his father's whipping him the third time for wilfulness resolved as the Writer of this Preface has often heard him say to tire his father out and he thought that about seven or eight times would do it Luckily for him his mother intreated his father to give it up to which he replied  "No I will whip him till tomorrow morning rather than let him get the better of me"  THAT he thought would be  rather  too long so instantly submitted  It was really entertaining to hear from Mr Berkeley when grown up his wonderfully deeplaid schemes to conquer his Mother but he used to add  "I never did once succeed yet still I persevered till reason pretty early in life convinced me of my folly"  He would frequently exclaim  "Oh the Wise King was inspired when he gave his lessons for education in the book of Proverbs and blessed be God MY Mother had the sense to make his directions the rule of her conduct God knows what would have become of me by the time I had been ten years old with my sort of spirit and temper"  From two years old until the last breath he drew perhaps no one ever loved a Mother with such exquisite tenderness as Mr Berkeley of which a million of instances might be related Mrs Berkeley used often to say on shewing any  curious thing presented to her by Mr Berkeley  "I am persuaded if my Son visited any odd place where nothing was to be procured but tanned bulls' hides he would say Pray pick out the very best and send it directed to Mrs Berkeley the Oaks Canterbury"  Mr Berkeley's gratitude to his Father was very great on several accounts particularly on two Mr Berkeley from a child and through life was an enthusiastic lover of music Like most he was exceedingly anxious to learn to play the violin which his Father early very wisely told him he  never  should do and Mr Berkeley used always to say  "He was sure had he learned it would have been his destruction"  In the early part of Mr Berkeley's life he played on the German flute but an hereditary illness the asthma attacked him at the age of about seventeen The advice of the very judicious worthy Dr Biddle of Windsor so entirely cured him that he never had a second serious attack The Doctor said  "Mr Berkeley was the youngest patient he ever attended in that frightful disorder"  He bade him lay aside his German flute and charged him never to give the view halloo Mr Berkeley at that time hunted regularly twice a week with the buckhounds  Mr Berkeley used frequently at his return on hunting days to say  "There is a fellow a wellmounted butcher that I longed to knock down He seems to  delight  in crossing the King so as really sometimes to endanger his Majesty  Nothing ever  makes me do it I wonder what the wretch is made of"  To which Dr Berkeley used to reply  "Why of  bulls' hides  child to be sure"  His heart certainly was not cast in the same mould with the amiable elegant butcher standing to represent the town of Hythe in parliament whose conduct on the hustings to the Peer that opposed him is well known to every Kentish person  He wisely obeyed both injunctions  The father and mother of Bishop Berkeley although not at all related before their marriage Mrs Berkeley was aunt to old General Wolfe father of the famous General of that name both died in the same week of the asthma and were interred at the same time in the same grave They were a happy pair through life and happy in not being divided in death It cannot be said that they died an untimely death  Old Lady Bannister aged more than an hundred grandmother of the late Lady Abdy when her children and grandchildren were lamenting over her with her wonted vivacity said  "Children don't stand crying and whining over me I am sure you cannot say that I die  an untimely death  "    both being near ninety They lived to breed up six sons gentlemen  Bishop Berkeley received his school education at Kilkenny He had like other boys cut his name with a knife on some post or table It was protected and shewn to strangers A very few years ago an Irish gentleman told Dr Berkeley that a malicious boy one day cut it clean out for which the Master flogged him very severely The Editor does not recollect the name but thinks it was not JONES perhaps the poor stupid boy did it on the same principle on which the lowlived wretch acted who burned the Temple of Diana at Ephesus  They lived to see the eldest a Bishop some years before their deatha Bishop who did honour to episcopacy by his learning his munificence his piety his wonderfully welljudged charities  The Sunday after the hard frost set in the Bishop appeared at breakfast with his  Cloynemade  wig All the Bishop's  own  cloaths as well as his liveries were constantly made at the  little  village of Cloyne He permitted his sons to employ a Cork tailor The Bishop's wig was without a grain of powder On his Lady's expressing her astonishment at his wonderful appearance he replied  "We shall soon have a famine and I have expressly ordered that none of the servants put any powder into their wigs neither will I"  The chaplain secretary and all took the hint A certain Bishop as soon as the tax was laid took out a licence for three men and his Lady's maid Bishop Berkeley during the frost and scarcity gave every Monday morning twenty guineas to the poor  Primate Boulter gave to the poor that winter ten thousand pounds The then Lord Bishop of Cork Dr Peter Brown  Whoever has not redde Bishop Peter Brown's Sermons those which describe our frail  no longer frail  bodies when clad with glory has much pleasure to come  uncle to the late agreeable Archbishop of Tuam and great uncle to the Editor's  youngold  friend Jemmet Brown of Riverstown in the county of Cork who frequently spent his holydays when at Westminster at Dr Berkeley's a single man gave thirty pounds every week One day the mayor his almoner came when the money being all gone the good Prelate gave all his plate  The Bishop of Cork was great uncle to the Reverend James Brown of Rivers Town the present possessor of the fine ring the only jewel which his truly honourable grandsire would accept from the Spanish lady after Colonel Brown had said  "Cease fair lady cease this strife  "I have in England a fair lady wife  "I would not falsify my vow for gold or gain  "No not for  all  the fairest dames in Spain"  To be sure Colonel Brown had some  odd  ideas perhaps from his grandmother from which most of our modern heroes are  entirely  free As to the generality of our fair dames of these days if they chance to meet with a humoursome or unkind husband  Parents are  wretches  who marry poor girls of sixteen or seventeen to animals to Hodmadods because they are rich The Editor had formerly two friends thus sacrificed at sixteen one had thirtyfive thousand pounds the other had seventy thousand pounds Neither had they been permitted to remain single until twentytwo would have taken their husbands for  under  footmen The six thousand pounds  per annum  was alas still is a noisy mischievous Baboon The other a poor quiet stupid rake who several times endangered in fact ruined his lady's healthbut peace to his maneshe died a penitent and left his relict immense riches all he had The other lives  perhaps  to get the  silken  halter which the Editor's sister Mrs Frinsham promised a lady who said  "that she thought he deserved EVERY thing  but  an halter"  Mrs Frinsham in her wonted way said  "Yes yes hang him you may give him a  silk  halter if you please"  Both these very sensible highly cultivated ladies made most excellent wives one alas still doesalmost too good for she suffers this wretch to force her to request her excellent worthy eldest son to enable the father to beggar by degrees himself A woman  owes  a duty to her children as well as to her husband  they fly to an Officer of the  Guards instead of to some old reverend Divine for counsel and consolation as our greatgrandmothers were wont to do for to suppose that there were  no  unpleasant husbands in the last century would be to suppose that miracles had not  then  ceased but the beauteous young dames were then differently educated and  decently  attired  A few years ago Mr Brown taking his ring off to wash his fingers after dinner three ladies hid it from him For three days he supposed it lost and was as he well might exceedingly distressed They deserved a trip at least  half way  to Botany Bay for their cruelty since which he has never worne it but keeps the invaluable jewel locked up and only shews it to those friends who wish to see so noble so honourable a curiosity  In one of Mr Berkeley's idle fits he was wild to go into the Army that he might take a  handsome  leave of Greek and Latin and by a noble connexion of his Father's he had the offer of a Cornetcy in the Oxford Blues This at the age of fifteen put him into an extacy and he used all his eloquent rhetoric on his Father to obtain his permission but as he used to say  "Happily in those things  my Father was as steady as my Mother in other respects where she was concerned"  Dr Berkeley used to say to his Son  "If after you have left Eton and spent four years at Oxford you wish as it is  possible  you may to go into the army you shall have my free consent"  Dr Berkeley valued an English  ie  not a  foreign  university education as highly as did the Editor from the age of fifteen  Nothing  could have tempted her to marry a gentleman who had not passed some years either at Oxford Cambridge or Dublin It certainly infuses something into the brains even of the most  hairbrained  youths that they very rarely get elsewhere Several gentlemen of the different regiments of cavalry constantly quartered at Canterbury had received that advantage and Dr Berkeley who sometimes dined at the mess with his military acquaintance at his return home used to say  "I wonder all the young men when they see the deference paid by the whole regiment to Captain or Major  do not use their time of absence at the University"  Mr Berkeley during his residence in Scotland accepted a commission in the Royal Edinburgh Volunteers raised to quell some riots in the neighbourhood of that city which occasioned a gentleman's asking him  "if he had not some  thoughts of going into the army"  He replied  "No Sir my Father's wisdom kept me out when I was an idle boy and my own will keep me out now that I am a man Nothing but his Majesty's erecting his standard will ever make  me a  military man in that case I should feel it my DUTY to repair to it"  One trait more of Mr Berkeley's singular temper shall suffice Like all other children he had been early told that it was utterly impossible to form a syllable in any known language without the aid of at least one vowel It was Mrs Berkeley's constant custom to go every night before she sat down to supper to the  rooms  of her children for she never suffered them to sleep together to see if they lay straight and had closed their eyes before they went to sleep as many eyes are injured by sleeping without this necessary care One night on entering Mr Berkeley's room she saw his fine eyes rolling about and began to give him a lesson for not going to sleep as soon as he went to bed at seven He replied  "I cannot sleep for thinking"  the misery of too many older persons it certainly occasioned the death of that wonderful genius the late agreable amiable excellent Mr Gainsborough Dissenting Minister at Henley upon Thames elder brother to the justly celebrated painter Mr Gainsborough of Bath but it may be in general avoided by care as the Editor  knows by experience and when grown up a man taught her Sonfor which  he blessed her  Her  The Marquis of Lansdown has complimented the Wise old King by adorning his lovely first Lady's costly monument in High Wycombe Church with several verses from the Book of Proverbs not engraved in verses but as a long sentence and at the bottom  "SOLOMON"  Dr Berkeley felt much gratitude to the polite Marquis for his very amiable attention in repeatedly obtaining his Majesty's permission to omit his residence at Canterbury during the years he was attending his Son at St Andrew's The Marquis and Dr Berkeley were at Christ Church at the same time    Mrs B  "How dared you set to thinking What are you thinking on"  Mr B  "Why you have often told me that it was impossible to form a syllable without a vowel and therefore I have  long resolved to do it  and tonight have been thinking till my head runs round and I believe I have tried five hundred words throwing out the vowels but I have not  yet  compassed it"  Before six years old he could spell every word in the English language without book and before he had completed his eighth year knew how to introduce them with propriety when occasion served which rendered his language remarkably elegantnot all mono and dissyllables as is often the case with children insomuch as to make the learned accomplished Sir John Temple of America say  "My nephew at near sixteen a pretty good Latin and Greek scholar can no more express his sentiments in the language of this little creature than I could scale the skies"  adding  "I shall watch him as he grows up and farewell to my sagacity if he does not make a most extraordinary man indeed"  The worthy Sir John needs not bid adieu to that trait of his fine strong understanding The Editor has not heard of any of her beloved respected American friends for many years  Mrs George Berkeley being little addicted to going from home and Dr Berkeley's hospitality very great Mr Monck Berkeley when any of his  ton  friends or acquaintance were going to the Continent Margate Ramsgate c c used to give them a letter of introduction to his Father or his Mother which occasioned the latter to say  "that she was the  good woman  who kept the sign of the  Berkeley arms  "  This so tickled the fancy of Mr Monck Berkeley that the next time he visited at home he brought a print of Lord Berkeley's arms framed and glazed  The next day Mrs Berkeley passing through the hall seeing something that she had not been accustomed to see called to Mr Wrightson to know what it was He replied  "that Mr Berkeley had ordered his man to hang it up  This worthy man from his first coming into the family a lad before Mr Monck Berkeley's birth was an excellent hand in assisting Dr Berkeley's young friends from Oxford and his relations from Ireland together with the ladies of the family in a joke to enliven Dr Berkeley when out of spirits He continued it for his beloved Mr Monck Berkeley One of which jokes was a ring at the front gate just as it was dusk to make Dr Berkeley believe that his dear Jemmy Hamilton was arrived as Mr Hamilton never fixed the day This worthy domestic showed his good judgement at fourteen One of the maids saying to him  "If I was youI would not help to make a FOOL of my Master so often"  To which as the Editor's servant told her Mr Wrightson sensibly replied  "Indeed I shall Don't you think that my Mistress the ladies and the young gentlemen know what liberties they may take with my Master better than you or I do besides my Master was never once angry with me for it in his life only says  Jack you are are a sad rogue  "  "  Mrs Berkeley having recourse to her glass soon discovered her Son's  fun  and on seeing him told him  "that his Father's  ten crosses  had no right to supporters except himself and his Mother who ought to take care not to make the  ten twelve  that if he wished for  crowned  supporters he must begin to open his mouth in Westminster Hall  One of the Earl of Berkeley's supporters is crowned as Dr Berkeley has told the Editor to mark that the family are descended from a kingof Denmark  "  Mr Berkeley conjured his Mother to let it hang up to which she consented on condition of its being removed from the hall into the antiroom leading to the eatingroom in the Oaks  The arms still hang upand if any of the Editor's old friends Scotch or English should wish to breathe a little  of the soft air of Chertsey and happen to recollect that she lives at that beautiful town and call she cannot with truth say that  "  Here is good entertainment for man and horse  "  but she can and does say that there is hearty welcome toif they are  in  lucka slice of leg of muttonif  out  of luckhashed mutton and a tartand whilst the Editor's  now  small stock lasts a bottle of good old port or sherry but after her  one  glass  per diem  has exhausted it she believes they must bring their bottle  under their arm  as the new winetax has quite scared her  Mrs Berkeley cannot pretend to assert that the BERKELEY ARMS is the  best  inn at Chertsey for the Swan kept by the uncommonly sensible clever Mrs Daniel mother of the Messrs Daniel who have lately published some fine things which the Editor cannot afford to purchase and if she could has not time to contemplate and admire as she hears all others do certainly excells the BERKELEY ARMS at present for the Editor conceives that Mrs Daniel the postmistress here  could  conduct a post  Most innkeepers' widows find out very soon that a  helpless widow  cannot carry on business somarry their waiter hostler or some such  proper  man The Editor has known in her life three or four who have not she feels  unfeigned  respect for such wise women When a young woman she always despised Motherswho were threatening their boys with  "I'll tell your PAPA of you"  always declaring if God sent her boys she would  try  if  she  could not manage them without calling the  aid  of PAPA Dear lady P  used to say  "You have kept your word to a tittle Batchelors' wives and maids' children is not  your  case my dear friend you have a knack  that is certain  I wish I could learn it of you"  Sweet friend thou learnedst  better  things  and procure  a posthorn the pleasantest music imaginable without sending every letter to and from Staines Some days there are more than  fourscore  as the Editor is informed  Mrs Berkeley one day received a letter from her Son saying  "that in about a fortnight she would receive a visit from the Princess de Lambelle and that he was sure she would have pleasure in making her Highness's few days  séjour  at Canterbury as agreeable as possible"  In answer to which epistle the Editor wrote as follows  My dear Son  If you will  inflict  Princesses as guests upon your poor Mother I hope you will at least have the goodness to  instruct  her in what manner she is to  comport  herself towards them She has had the honour to entertain Baronesses c c up to Duchesses but when she comes to  Princesses  she is  quite out of her Diocese  This sentence was a cant phrase in the family A poor lady in the neighbourhood of Cloyne being seized with a phrensy fever and continuing long ill Bishop Berkeley being out early one morning before enquiry had been regularly made stepping into the coach asked his faithful old coachman if he happened to hear how Mrs  did He replied  "Oh very ill indeed my Lord she is  quite  out of her  Diocese  "  indeed  Who is to be invited to meet her What is to become of her suite To be sure they are  too fine  for John c  To which an immediate answer was returned of the following purport  "Only  must be invited to meet her With regard to her suite they will all be at the Lyon whither I have recommended her Highness The Marchioness of  and the Count and Countess of  names forgotten will dine with her Highness at the same table in the humble eatingroom at the Oaks"  Matters thus adjusted the Editor who during Dr Berkeley's life always kept an excellent cook set her spirit quite at rest expecting in due time the arrival of a fine French  lacquais  announcing when she must go to the Lyon  request the honour  c  One morning before the expiration of the fortnight on going down to breakfast Mr Wrightson delivered to her a letter which she saw was directed by her Son It contained only  My dearest Madam  You will have the honour to receive this from the hands of the Princess de Lambelle and I am persuaded that my Father to whom I request you to present my duty and yourself will have great  pleasure in doing yourselves the honour to pay every possible attention to her Highness in doing which you will greatly oblige  Your most dutiful affectionate son and obedient servant GEORGEMONCK BERKELEY  It may perhaps be asked how became Mr Berkeley so well acquainted so interested for this lovely unfortunate Princess His noble friends at Blenheim did him the honour to invite Mr Berkeley during her Highness's visit at their delightful abode Mr Berkeley escorted her to Nuneham and waited on her whilst she viewed all the noble buildings paintings c at Oxford She said she much wished to see Cambridge but that if she went she feared she should not find  a  Mr Berkeley there  Mr Berkeley with his wonted amiablility and alertness told her Highness that  "if she wished to go thither he would with great pleasure give her a letter of introduction to the Vicechancellor who was a very intimate friend of his Father and with whom  he  had the happiness to be well acquainted the very learned accomplished polite Dr Farmer Master of Emanuel College"  He accordingly did so She said  "She wished to see every thing that was curious during her stay in England"  adding  "I hear that there is a curious Cathedral at Canterbury I saw nothing but a very old city and a vast multitude of people"  Asking Mr Berkeley as he seemed to have a large acquaintance  "if he happened to know any one at Canterbury to whom he could be so good as to give her a letter of introductionjust to shew her what was worthy attention there"  Mr Berkeley told her  "  that  he could most certainly do for that his Father and Mother resided there and would have great pleasure  Perhaps Mr Berkeley in this instance resembled SPONSORS at the FONT who promise  a great deal  indeed which the Editor  never  would  never  will do whilst she retains her poor faculties promising what  pleasure  his  Mother  would haveThe pleasure would have been by rebound gratifying her lovely Son  Entertaining  Princesses is  too mighty  a task for a poor quiet country gentlewoman Indeed Mr Berkeley only said she would receive every  attention  That her Highness certainly and probably would have accepted  more  graciously than did an English  titled dame  of Mr Berkeley's  inflicting  who talked during the time of dinner as  ton  dames frequently doBut on the drawingroom filling with ladies and gentlemen in the afternoon every way  her  superior  save  in birth never opened her mouth but to Dr Berkeley and the Editor which occasioned Mrs Berkeley's asking her Son when he came to the Oaks  "if  was not a very stupied woman"    "No my dear Mother but she despised  your  visitors"  She can talk at a fine rout in town I promise you The Editor forbears setting down  her  answer Dr Young shall now speak  "How will ye weather an ETERNAL night"  "  c c  On hearing this her Highness exulted expecting probably to find as good a showman in the Father as she had found in the Son Dr Berkeley could most elegantly most highly entertain his friends in almost every  other  way but as a showman he was so notoriously bad that a gentleman a very near relation of his used to say  "George is the idlest dog upon earth One may come from Ireland stay a month at Cookham live on the fat of the land and but for Mrs George Berkeley go back again without seeing even either Cliefden's 'proud alcove' or Windsor Castle to say nothing of half a score other beautiful places within a drive of his house to which with much ado Mrs Berkeley drags him as she will not leave him to dine at home without her"  The Editor laid it down as a rule when she married and she strictly adhered to it never to go any where in a morning that would not admit of her placing herself at table at three o'clock unless Dr Berkeley ordered dinner later  Dr Berkeley was famous when at Oxford for  not  going on parties so as to occasion Mr James Hamilton aforenamed to say  "Berkeley had always  one  answer at Oxford 'Oh not  I  indeed  I  have seen Blenheim'So now it is '  I  have seen Windsor Castle"  c The fact is Dr  Berkeley on his arrival at Oxford the first long vacation flew half over England added to which any bodily exercise brought on with him as with his Father who used no exercise at all but in the easiest hung coach for many years a constant hectic feverishness  Mr Berkeley did not at all resemble a late worthy Fellow of All Souls College The Editor one day many years ago asking a very witty Fellow of that College if he was acquainted with Dr B  r of his College he replied in the affirmative adding  "he is a very worthy man but never  throughly  happy when he has not some  Prince  of the GERMANIC BODY to  escort  about the University"  The Princess de Lambelle although she did not see was seen at Canterbury The day after her passing through Canterbury from Dover the Editor met her old  very highly  respected friend Captain Gostling  The Editor the  last  time that she visited Canterbury enquiring after her old friend of his wonderfully witty sister Mrs H Gostling who could  banish  solitude from a  desart  whether she was to ask after him as  Major  or  Colonel  replied  "Oh dear Madam  neither  he prides himself no great honour to others on being the  oldest Captain  in the service Had the old excellent Duke of Montague who got for him his ensigncy at thirteen been living he had not now "whereof to glory" thus"  who reproached her for not having stepped down to the city to look at the Princess de Lambelle saying  "I think  every body  but yourself was  there"  To which the Editor replied  "that she was too old and too stupid to go to SEE any body"  she did not add  "  hear  any thing"  for she would if she could afford to hire horses willingly drive twenty miles at least once every week to listen to the conversation of Mr BURKE adding  "I dare say the wise folks were all disappointed"  To which Captain Gostling replied  "I was not for I think in my conscience  I think in my conscience the Editor does verily believe that her old friend Captain Gostling has a conscience as  "  void of offence towards  GOD  and  MAN"  as most men have ever enjoyed and so his soldiers think  that she is altogether the very finest  woman  that the Almighty ever formed"  The Editor begged as she always does to except her  lamentably curious  grandmother EVE before the Fall Why would the silly woman  The witty and as the Editor has heard her Mother say worthy Bishop Hickman in one of his Sermons says that the  sad dialogue  between the  Lady  and the Serpent ladies  should not be familiar  with the Serpent however beautiful their  outwara  appearance may be has the following sentence  "Eve in conversing with the Devil adds to God's command of not tasting the forbidden fruit one of not touching it she broke her own command and found no inconvenience she then ventured to break God's and so brought misery on all her descendants c"  The Editor as Atheist Gibbon says  "quotes this from memory not having redde it since she was sixteen years old but she frequently finds occasion to quote it to those of her acquaintance who seem to wish to be MORE RIGHTEOUS than GOD"  The Editor writes it with due veneration but there were always Pharisees  wish to know evil As much good as you please Sir Serpent but NO evil for me  A gentleman very many years ago mentioned to the Editor that he had been taught by a very learned anatomical gentleman a method of separating the soul from the body without a possibility of being suspected of suicide adding that he would tell it to her she begged to be excused hearing it lest at any time of deep affliction the enemy of her soul might tempt her to practise it She also conjured him to let it die with him as  angelic  BOYLE did his secret of discharging ink The Editor believes her friend took her advice as he is dead and she has never heard any thing of this  dangerous  secret  Mr Monck Berkeley in one of his letters to his Mother speaking of her after much eulogium adds  "I am afraid I am  really  in love with her without knowing it"  Some pains were taken to conceal from Mr Berkeley just then within a few days of his death the dreadful fate of this lady and of poor Louis the Sixteenth but in vain It was said  "that the monster who murdered this lady received the wages of his iniquity in England at the bankinghouse of an old amiable friend of Mr Monck Berkeley Mr Chambers in Bond Street one poor hundred pounds only"  Our Blessed Master says  "What shall it profit a man if he gain the  whole  world and lose his own soul"  But few Papists are permitted to read the Book of God  This brings to the Editor's remembrance a dialogue that many years ago passed between the late King George the Second and the French Ambassador at Herenhausen one day at dinner when a relation of the Editor the late Richard Powney Esquire Fellow of All Souls College had the honour to dine with his Majesty who when abroad laid aside royalty and wished his guests to forget that he was a King  The Ambassador a lively man said  "YOU poor Kings never made so  pitiful  figures as when Joshua had  seven  of you shut up in a cave together"  The King replied  "Ah you Papists do not read the Bible or you would know that he had but  five  of us in the cave"  Mr Powney who entertained a table full of company at Dr Berkeley's with this anecdote said  "Every one admired the ready wit of the King"  and all the company laughed heartily  This lovelymust one style her unhappy or happyPrincess could not avail herself of Mr Monck Berkeley's politeness  An order arriving in England from the unfortunate Louis XVI for all his subjects to return to France an express  followed the Princess to Cambridge The Editor thinks she recollects hearing her Son say that she had been there some days  This order was so urgent that the Princess only stayed in Canterbury to change horses for Dover at three in the morning At eight Mr Monck Berkeley's letter mentioned above as to be received from the fair hands of the beauteous Princess was brought to the Oaks by the honest hostler of the Lyon and delivered with  "  Mrs Lambelle's  best compliments to Mrs Berkeley and she was very sorry she could not visit her as it was so early but that she should be in Canterbury again very soon when she would comeand that Mr Berkeley the gentleman who wrote the letter which Mrs Lambelle charged him to deliver safe was very well"  The Princess's degradation by the honest hostler afforded much diversion to Dr and Mrs Berkeley and their friends Alas what degradation did her lovely lifeless from suffer after it was lifeless for it is very certain she  "never  saw  "  although she tasted as every mortal must death for her sweet spirit was dismissed from the lovely casket in a single instant Happy if found washed clean in the atoning blood of God cloathed with the robes of HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS and her spirit renewed by  that  Spirit which HE died to purchase for all that throughly turn to HIM See the viiith  chapter to the Romans which glorious chapter the Editor has heard Dr Berkeley say his greatgrandfather Mr Monck of GrangeGormond when old and visited at times perhaps not  very  often by his fine young lady and gentlemen grandchildren used his large Bible always lying on the table to request them to read to him which occasioned  their  supposing that the old gentleman  doated  The late very pious Dr Booth Dean of Windsor was so addicted to talk on the same  delightful  subject that the Editor well remembers a gentleman coming in one evening to her house when she resided at Windsor thirtysix years ago and happening to say  "he came from the Deanry"  a gentleman asked  "Did you hear any news"  Mr Trevanion  The worthy uncle of the present Member of Parliament for Dover    "No"  Gentleman  "What did you talk about"  Mr Trevanion  "Why on the Dean's beloved topic the great blessing of REDEMPTION the wonders of REDEEMING LOVE Aye aye good man he never seems to enjoy any other conversation"  How happy in  age  to resemble the  friends  of St Paul  "whose conversation"  the Apostle tells us  "is in Heaven"  c c May that of the Editor and all her beloved  aged  friends be daily more and more so is her  ardent wish  When last at Canterbury the Editor requested her worthy friend the throughly elegant amiable Mrs Hughes to say to her relation the Reverend Mr Hambley the present vicar of Cookham how very sensibly dear Dr Berkeley and herself felt that universally beloved gentleman's polite generous pleasant conduct on Dr Berkeley resigning that lovely spot Lest it should have slipped that lady's memory the Editor inserts part of a letter of hers to Dr Berkeley who as well as her Son preserved all her scrawls  "You bade me draw the character of your successor at Cookham You observed that he had LYONS in his bearing armorial to  that  they are confined I really believe He seems to have much of the Lamb in his nature and manners and I do not suspect that he is a wolf in sheep's cloathing which I abhor Suppose we get our worthy friend Sir Isaac to exchange the noble Savage for the lovely Lamb for him"  Mrs Berkeley gladly embraces this opportunity of holding up to its merited praise so amiable a character  It may be asked  "What could  Mrs  Berkeley have to do with dilapidations during the life of Dr Berkeley"  She has alas had  too  much to do with them since his lamented death Dr Berkeley never took dilapidations but at Acton a very trifle and at Canterbury not forty pounds and immediately expended on the Prebendal House  more than two hundred pounds The Editor asked him how he came to take any as he never had before and Dr Stedman did not die rich he sweetly replied  "Because I had not you here to remind me not to do it"  Dr Berkeley used always from the time he married to leave all business that he thought might have any thing at all unpleasant in it to Mrs Berkeley laughingly saying  "it was the pleasantest thing in the world to have a wife that one could metamorphose into a steward that although  calling Mrs Berkeley by her name had always declared when she was single she was resolved never to marry  any  man who took a woman merely as a disinterested housekeeper to see that the servants did not cheat him from morning till night and to bring him an heir yet she had not declared against being a steward as was the case of the  little quiet  mother of a worthy Baronet now a Peer whose father had  at least  twenty thousand pounds  per annum  "  One day an amiable Countess a lovely friend of the Editor's youth dining at the  said  wise man's with other company after the ladies were retired to the drawingroom the butler came whispered the lady after some time he repeated his visit and  "Oh beware of the third time"  says the old proverb he entered and whispered loud enough for every one to hear  "Madam if you do not please to  come and  weigh  out the hops they cannot go on with the brewing and the beer will be all spoiled  The Editor's Father was famous for having the finest strong beer in Berkshire and she was resolved her husband should be as famous She  routed out all  his brewery books Mr Wrightson  studied  them as Berks and Canterbury can testify to excellent effect  "  Beer is generally spoiled  by  hops and the Editor has been repeatedly told that there is still an act of Queen Elizabeth  unrepealed  forbidding the  "planting or cultivating that  pernicious weed  called hop"  The Editor has heard from her youth that the law for extinguishing fire on the tolling the curfew bell is also unrepealedShe is sometimes  tempted  to wish it was enforced Perhaps there are few persons who fully know the wholesomeness of aged hard beer The Editor has frequently heard the late excellent Mrs Tucker of Canterbury say that when her father was head master of the King's School the second masters and the other boarding houses had summer after summer a very bad fever amongst the boys but her father Mr Gurney had not a boy ill which  he  attributed entirely under God to their drinking very hard  homebrewed  beer He brewed as they do in all  wise  gentlemen's families only twice in the year in March and October All the world have of late found out the virtues of beer without hops New or as it is commonly called sweetwort is excellent  for worms in children and for scurvies in men and when the poison of the strong rank weed hop is gone off it is  aqua vitae  to many to the Editor even when almost vinegar but a table spoonful of stale brewer's beer is almost death to her  Qu  Why is this  The lady however begged excuse went and did her  duty as housekeeper  Her husband built a very fine house but would have no back door that  he  might see the motions of his half hundred of servants all day long The Editor then about seventeen offered to lay a wager with a gentleman that within two years he would break out a back door he did it within one  The Editor now experiences the want of a back  gate  at least She has few servants but thank God they are not eye servants so want not watching but there are many beggars who do for  "these beasts of the  people  "  on being constantly refused relief leave the front the only gate open for the beasts of the  common  to rout the garden direfully indeed  The Editor and a lady with her went a few weeks ago into a shop a girl about thirteen shabbily dressed came in asked for a pennyworth of gingerbread it was cut and also for a pennyworth of sugar candy the mistress of the shop sensibly asked  "Would you have both"  Beggar  "  Yes I eats um together  "  This being at the time when bread was at its very highest price and WISE people believed we had no corn in the nation the Editor asked  "If she lived at D  that she might  avoid  relieving  her  family"  Beggar  "No"  Mrs B  "Where then"  Beggar  "No where we travels the country"  Mrs B  "What do you sell laces and pins"  Beggar  "No we only travels about"  That is we are common beggars can it be charity to relieve such  The Editor at length getting sight of most of the sheets at once is confirmed in what she suspected that she has been guilty of tautology of Egotism or rather  Editorism  It is said of the excellent Lord Chancellor Clarendon that in his incomparable History of the Rebellion the  Chancellor of the Exchequer  is  too  often introduced  The Editor has always thought that there is at  least  as much if not more in the circumlocution often practised and she is certain a vast deal of affectation which she ever  abhorred does still abhor especially in matrons and pities in girls in persons relating transactions in which they were  necessarily  principal actors front figures who cannot be thrown into the  background  without ruining the picture as is done by  at  by using circumlocution in mentioning themselves It is like a very plain woman  decking  herself  violently  it  calls attention  but does not according to the Editor's humble opinion in  either  case  create respect  It must be considered that through life there was so constant an intercourse whether present or absent between Mr Berkeley and his Mother that She has during the writing these sheets frequently studied how to put herself in a dark corner which has been much more difficult than the doing that kind office to her dear Son until he attained to the age of five when  that  mode of punishment ceased and another somewhat similar was substituted  The Editor perhaps having described herself as the  most resolute of all females  where her children or her conscience were concerned owes it to herself to say that it is most certain that she is not cursed with a  stubborn  or a  saucy  spirit both were pretty easily by her wise mother nipped almost  before  they were  in bud  When she was not quite four years old being very busily employed in underssing her doll to put it into the cradle in an arbore at the farthest part of a very long walk her mother called her thus  importantly  occupied she conceiving that it could not be  heard uttered the following soliloquy  "  I won't come till I have done  "  Very soon appeared the amiable woman who had taken care of here from a month old for thank God her mother was her nurse with  "Oh  fie  Miss how came you to say such a naughty word to my Mistress"    "What word"    "Why you know Miss you said  I won't come  "  Miss did  not  deny it knowing from the time she could articulate that a LIE even with her father was a threat of being whipped  "  all  but to death"  The little culprit was delivered to her mother standing at the garden door to receive her She can almost fancy that her wrist when she thinks of it feels the grasp of her mother's elegant long fingers and hears her say  "  You won't come  MADAM will you"  In she was taken shewn a nice slice of bread covered with currant jelly on the table  "Look you there I called you to give you that for your supper You will now go to bed without any supper but a good whipping"  which was instantly administered to teach her never to say  "I won't"  again to her mother or father It proved effectual for the Editor can with strictest truth assert that this was the  first  and the  last  time that  frightful  word was ever pronounced by her to either parent  It pleased the gracious Giver of every good gift to spare that excellent mother until her daughter was twenty years  old although at the time of her father's death no one would have given half a year's purchase for her life and she has frequently told her daughters when grown up that every breaking up when she returned them to Mrs Sheeles's that she conceived she had taken her  last  leave of them The Editor often cannot refrain exclaiming to her excellent sister  "How gracious was God to us in sparing our angelic Mother"  To shew that the Editor needed not much discipline to bring her to submit to  lawful  authority a simple little story may she hopes be excused The  fault  is obliterated from her memory the  punishment  never can and her consequent sufferings One of the Fathers describing woman says  "  She is an animal delighting in finery  "  A very pretty pale blue the Editor's favourite colour from her cradle for herself to this time bonnet had just arrived with some things of her mother's from town which she had contrived to get sight of half a dozen times during the morning and was told she was to wear it in the afternoon to go visit Miss Sloper sister of General Sir Robert Sloper Mr and Mrs Sloper then lived at Waltham Place This young lady died at Mrs Dennis's school Whether elated by so frequently contemplating the  beautiful  bonnet or in what else she offended whether by flying up one pair of stairs and down the other of the old house a favourite amusement with both sisters when their  Mother  was out of the house Be this  however as it may the culprit was called welljobed and told that instead of going out visiting in the new bonnet she was to stay at home tied by the arm to she believes the first flytable ever made in England made according to Mrs Frinsham's own directions given to a country cabinetmaker and which she the culprit could have drawn all over the house She supplicated for pardon but in vain she was made to sit down on the floor under the table tied by the left arm She was tied with a good long needleful of common white silk taken from a ball in her mother's Indian workbowl She wept much a little while but being naturally of a very cheerful disposition soon dried her eyes and began to amuse herself with scratching a tree and some flowers on the shining old oak floor with a large pin that she had coaxed out of her frock behind  The Editor's delight in drawing and mixing colours commenced she remembers before she left off her backstring Thus amused she  forgot  that she was a prisoner and had crawled quite to the stretch of her tether On finding it she was in such terror lest the silk should break and that her mother should think that she had dared to liberate herself that she crept so close to the leg of the table as to let the silk hang in a loop for considerably more than an hour not amusing herself in any way but the delight arising from her happiness that the silk had  not  broke  It may perhaps by some be thought strange that a  very  docile girl should make so very resolute a mother Her disposition is naturally yielding except when duty called for steadiness as in the case of Mr Berkeley His brother was as easily governed as his Mother  The Editor had the happiness she still feels it such that her mother bore testimony to the amenableness of her temper a very few months before her  "slow sudden death"  A beloved friend of the Editor was strenuously asserting  "that every human being was  stubborn  and would if  possible  get their own will that nothing but superior absolute force prevented it"  adding  "shew me any man woman or child that is  not  stubborn and I will shew you a  black swan  "  Some late travellers have discovered this  rara avis  The Editor constantly opposed the doctrine of  universal stubbornness  and insisted that although she had MANY faults she was certainly not a  wilful  being and respectfully requested her mother to say whether she thought  her  so Mrs Frinsham laid down her work and lifting up her sweet eyes which exactly resembled Dr Berkeley's said  "Oh no my dear indeed you  are not  stubborn you never gave me five minutes trouble in your life from  wilfulness  "  The mentioning of these things brings to the Editor's recollection a conversation with her Son not many months before his death telling a friend who had a violenttempered little boy  "that she should contrive to prevent his crying and screaming so violently as described as it was dangerous and often productive of bad consequences to  boys'  health"  adding  "that she always took care to prevent it with her own boys that when she had locked them into a light room no child should ever be shut into a dark room sad consequences have arisen from it and got the key in her own pocket that no servant might  kindly  administer consolation she always stood to listen till the roaring ceased"  Hereupon Mr Berkeley said  "My dear Mother did you  could  you think that I was fool enough to scream a moment longer than I thought you were in hearing I strained my lungs that you might hear as long as I conceived it possible you should hear" Mrs Berkeley had often observed that the last shout was the most violent "I then immediately reached down some book the prison was generally the Editor's book closet to amuse me till the hour or the two hours according to my sentence was elapsed  I  never shed a tear"    that  his Father often remarked  "I only  roared like a wild bull  to as I conceived  punish you  for punishing meblessing on you for your wisdom"  The Editor on perusing the sheets quite ready for publication finds that she has omitted many anecdotes that must have heightened the ideas of Mr Monck Berkeley's wisdom and amiability and his undaunted courage His rescuing a poor little child late one night near Covent Garden as he was going home to his chambers He met the thief soon after at the Old Bailey and she was transported His rescuing an amiable friend of his from the  Jews  whose  wise  guardians did not at twenty allow him as many hundreds  per annum  as the next year he was to inherit thousands and assisted by his learned amiable friend Mr H  from the Gentiles at four in the morning when going along Covent Garden they saw a coach and some kind of bustle and struggle  Hereupon Mr Berkeley said  "It is very late let us go and see if all is right there"  On drawing near they saw a gentleman liftingdragging into a coach by three females assisted by the coachman Mr H  exclaimed  "Good God Berkeley it is your friend  "  Mr Berkeley sprung forward and said  "My  where are you going"  extremely intoxicated replied  "I do not know"  Mr B  "Yes you do you are going with us"  Mr B's Friend  "Yes yes"  The Nymphs began raving and said  "The gentlemen had no right to take their  guest  from them  was going to spend the  evening  with them"  The Coachman said  "The gentleman  belonged  to the ladies They had taken his coach to carry him home"  Mr Berkeley said  "Haveacare my friend I have taken the number of your coach already and if you act like a villain as surely as I live till morning  you  shall appear before the LordMayor I fancy the ladies can walk home by themselves and do you assist us in putting  into the coach and at your peril drive to any place but where I order you"  They accordingly drove to  's lodgings where they delivered him his  bourse bien chargée  not  des louis  but guineas and his very fine watch safe into the hands of his  valet de chambre  with directions to put him to bed  The Editor rejoices very sincerely that PROVIDENCE has some time ago delivered his Lordship into the hands of a very sensible worthy Lady who has brought him a son  and heir to his vast estate May he grow up as amiable as his father as sensible as his mother  The Editor on perusing the sheets of this wonderfully long Preface  de suite tout ensemble  is hurt to find that her memory is become so treacherous as to have permitted her to be so guilty of tautology at the distance of little more than six months to have twice quoted some favourite lines of Mr Addison This however may be pardoned for they are beautiful and she repeats the hymn of which they form a part every day but repeating her own remarks or comments she laments as she does her  seeming  ingratitude when mentioning the amiable hospitality of Scotland she perceives she has omitted to mention the very highly polite attentions received by Dr Berkeley's family from the very elegant sister of the worthy Lord Newark resident at St Andrew's when Dr Berkeley's family went to reside there  "although last yet not least"  c  A lady the other day said to the Editor  "that our Nobility wanted a  little  humbling that to be sure they had carried the matter  much too far  in France but a  little  humbling would do them service for both worlds"  The Editor begged that the  Scottish  in general excepting some few might be spared and as they took the advice of our blessed Master and amiably  "humbled themselves that they and some few English might be exempted from the  said humbling  "  The Editor has not the honour to be known at present to many Noblesse  "  The world forgetting by the world forgot  "  but she is apt to think that  modern  Nobility are addicted to set more value on a coronet than those to whom it has descended by hereditary succession through several generations  Mrs Berkeley some years ago had the honour to correspond with some English Nobles of both sexes now no more Very many of their letters are preservedas polite as if  she  had been noble  Several years ago the Editor took leave to write to a modern Peeress requesting a very small favour for a young lady  very very  much Mrs Berkeley's superior not to say by birth the Peeress's The answer was returned on an halfsheet of common paper sealed with a wafer pricked with a pin expressing astonishment that the Editor could suppose she could do what she requesteduse her interest to procure a vacant twenty pounds  per annum  for a poor lady who must have had the PAS of the Peeress until her Lord was a few years ago created a Peer What made it  still stranger  to the  poor simple  Editor was that when the Peeress and herself were both girls the Peeress's lovely mother felt at least expressed herself she had the grace of humility  obliged by the Editor's mother's attentions to her and her little girl now the  little  Peeress This occured not long after the Editor's return to England and she supposed that some great revolution in politeness had taken place during her absence and that poor untitled gentry must approach Nobility as Swift makes the subjects of Japan approach their Emperor and  "lick the dust as they crawl towards him"  The Editor's ideas concerning a revolution in manners were however soon corrected by her having the honour to receive letters  à l'égarde de son cher fils  from her amiable friend Lord Loughborouh An instance of his Lordship's amiability related to her by another old friend the agreeable Mr Berridge the hospitable master of John à Gaunt's Castle emboldened her at the distance of near a quarter of a century to write to his Lordship to introduce that dear young man telling his Lordship  "that naturalists assure us that the most timid animals become courageous where their young are concerned that she felt the truth of the assertion"  His Lordship's and good Lady Loughborough's attentions are carefully registered in her grateful memory His Lordship's answer was most polite and friendly Their amiable Graces of Marlborough and the late excellent Lady Effingham who have chanced to honour the Editor with letters have written on  whole  sheets of gilt paper most condescendingly subscribed and sealed  as to a gentlewomannot to be mantuamaker Indeed the Editor used to write more respectfully to the famous Mrs Munday her old playfellow niece of John Breedon Esquire of BearCourt Berks when she wanted a new  négligée  The poor lady for whom the Editor supplicated the Peeress's interest for only a poor vacant twenty pounds  per annum  has the honour at least her grandfather had and upwards for  very many  centuries the honour to have two crowned heads put on mourning at their decease as whilst there was a King in France was always done by that King when the head of the Courtney family died which the Editor is  very  sure no crowned head ever did for  her  ancestors nor as she verily believes for those of Captain  father of the Peeress The poor young lady shewed her high birth by submitting with the Editor really thinks unexampled fortitude and true unaffected dignity to the distresses to which an imprudent match in  very  early youth had unavoidably subjected herself her elegant husband and lovely little girl Although Mrs Berkeley failed to obtain relief from the  courtly  COURTEOUS  Peeress  the amiable Dr Berkeley's pocket failed not to alleviate their  deep  distress for which the young gentleman blessed him when dying His sensible grateful relict and lovely daughter continue to bless his sweet memory Dr Berkeley  is receiving his reward the Peeress  still  enjoys her  new  coronet  Mr Monck Berkeley a great herald from ten years old was consulted at twentytwo by a noble amiable Peer a great herald a friend of the Peeress's Lord elect about supporters to be added when the arms of  were to be  tipped  with a coronet Mentioning the selection Mr Monck Berkeley first made would too plainly mark out the Peeress who it is hoped although she is now turned threescore may live to grow olderand wiser The Editor never wishes  "her pocket catonine tails"  to  wound  any but the vicious and the ungrateful and only to make the  insolent tingle  a little The Editor has some letters which she preserves from ancient  noblesse  male and female for their internal as well as their external merit The assumed motto of the excellent Countess of L  round her Ladyships cipherseal is always carefully preserved  "HOLINESS IS HAPPINESS"  Oh that this were the  motto  of millions noble and nonnoble  The two following letters of the late GeorgeMonck Berkeley Esquire were written at different periods the first when he was just about to return from his  last  vist to Scotland in the end of the autumn of not then alas thinking it was his last visit for he frequently used to say  "If God spares my life to settle I shall every now and  then once in three or four years in summer vacation make a visit to Scotland for a few weeks"  Although an enthusiastic admirer of Johnson in his writings all on the side of virtue his integrity c he used to say  "He behaved like a savage in Scotland where every respectful attention was shewn to him by every one"  Mr Berkeley constantly styled Dr Johnson the  noble learned  BEAR His own abhorrence of what is called rudeness even when persons are ever so much inflamed by resentment he contracted very early in life from his Mother who added to Shakspeare's  "Speak daggers but use none"  let those daggers for your  own  sake be  gilded  never use  coarse  language nor make a  coarse  simile The second was written at Dover a very few months before his lamented death  AN ADDRESS TO THE CLERICAL AND LAY MEMBERS OF THE EPISCOPAL COMMUNION IN SCOTLAND  Reverend Sirs and Gentlemen  Presuming that by this time you are all sufficiently informed with respect to the steps that have been taken by your Bishops to procure  a repeal of the penal laws and that you are also acquainted with the TOTAL failure of their undertakings I shall only trespass on your attention whilst I suggest the propriety of a second application to Parliament and propose to your consideration a plan of proceedure of which the expediency will I doubt not be sufficiently apparent to require little or no assistance from argument  The plan for which I wish to procure your sanction is as follows That each of the two orders I have now the honour to address should elect a representative to superintend on its behalf the next application to Parliament for a repeal of those laws which it is no longer the interest of any man to enforce  Not suffering more than four persons excepting the family of the Clergyman to assemble at one time to attend the reading of the English Liturgy under a severe penalty indeed The Editor has heard a reverend old Divine say  "That he has read it so repeatedly over to  only  four that frequently by evening he has scarce been able to speak to be heard"  It was  not  a sabbath of  rest  to him poor man This is something  like  persecution The  noble charitable  Lord who framed the Bill  wittily  said  "He had got a bill passed that would starve one half of the Scotch and  d  n  the other"  Perhaps it did not occur to his Lordship that an English Peer bred a Presbyterian as his Lordship was could invent any thing TOO severe for  Scottish  Episcopalians To the honour of the Editor's Presbyterian neighbours at St Andrew's she never saw the Episcopalians incommoded although they assembled in much larger numbers at Mr Lindsey's chapel The spirit had  quite subsided  and Lord  had been gone some years before to joineither the starved or the d  d Scots    To direct the attention of the  inferior clergy  to the preservation of their own rights as connected with that church to which their services are devoted would have appeared to me wholly unnecessary had I not witnessed their supineness on the late occasion  That the Bishops undertook their embassy without the concurrence of the Clergy and Laiety over whom they preside that they constituted themselves SOLE AND ABSOLUTE GOVERNORS of the Church IN Scotland that they concerted measures for the relief of that Church without the advice or approbation of the inferior Clergy who with themselves were equally interested in the success of these measures and that they have plainly evinced their utter incapacity to execute their own plans are  facts  I need not call to your recollection But as a man  much  interested in the welfare of that Religious Society in which he hopes to die I think it a duty incumbent on me to suggest to you the necessity of preventing a second encroachment on your privileges and of attempting in concurrence with our  Prelates  by a PROPER and RESPECTFUL application to Parliament to procure for that Church of which you are at once members and guardians the protection of Government whose authority it acknowledges and whose lenity it has long experienced  Do not Gentlemen however suppose that to lessen the respect due to the  Episcopal  character or to circumscribe the authority of the Bishops by improper limits is the object proposed by the present Address Such is by no means the case But when any authority however venerable presumes to invade the rights of others it is the duty of those whose liberties are endangered to defend  that blessing  for which an  equivalent  has never  yet  been discovered  Let me therefore Reverend Sirs and Gentlemen entreat you without delay to elect each of you a representative who may attend such Bishops as may be disposed to go upon a second embassy to London for if you reject this measure errors similar to those which have already disappointed your hopes may again frustrate any exertions that may be made in your favour and you may  for ever  lose that relief which the present government so readily affords to all its suffering subjects This advice will I fear lose much weight as coming from the pen of an Anonymous Writer and I should certainly subscribe my name were I vain enough to suppose it could in the least influence those to whom it is addressed  I have the honour to remain Reverend Sirs and Gentlemen Your sincere wellwisher  A  LAYMEMBER  of the Episcopal Church in Scotland  After the above address was published in Edinburgh and dispersed through Scotland Mr Berkeley sent up a printed copy to his Mother desiring her to shew it to his Father and learn his sentiments of it and after he left Scotland it was immediately known who was the writer  Mr Berkeley was early convinced of the Divine right of Episcopacy His Mother lest she might die had engraven in his mind  that one  text which  nothing can whittle  away spoken by God incarnate himself  "Whosesoever sins YE remit they  are  remitted Whosesoever sins YE retain they  are  retained Lo  I  am with you alway even unto the end of the world"  A Bishop's being a  vautrien  a Socinian c c does not affect the  office  of a Bishop as our blessed Lord plainly shewed by consecrating the traitor Judas He who redde  every  heart certainly  knew  his and no doubt chose one a DEVIL  "Have I not chosen you twelve and one of you is a DEVIL"  See the Holy Gospel as recorded by St John ch vi ver  as he styles Judas Iscariot on purpose to shew  us  that it is the  office not  the  man  The Editor has often made persons stare by asserting  "that she had as lief been baptized or received the sacred elements from the hands of  Judas Iscariot  as from  St Peter  or the beloved Disciple"  We may wish Bishops Priests Deacons and  Ourselves  more piety less worldlymindedness and more to adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour  My dear Parents  As reiterated relapses leave me no hopes of a speedy recovery if of any at all and as I long to embrace those who are most dear to me I propose whilst I have strength left to accomplish the journey to set out for Cheltenham this day se'nnight Weak as I am the journey will take me a whole week  It took him more than a fortnight He was two or three times supposed to be dead in the coach by his incomparable aunt and the two affectionate worthy female attendants named in the Editor's Preface What a journey for three perhaps as tenderhearted persons as can be any where found  to accomplish On this day fortnight I hope to receive your blessing at Cheltenham and possibly when so near I may see Dr Chestern who  may  hit on something to palliate sufferings that are almost intolerable but  that  GOD who  has supported will  support me through it all With kindest love to Dolly  ie  Mrs Dorothy Monck  I remain Your unalterably dutiful devoted Son and servant GEORGEMONCK BERKELEY  A very vexatious suit commenced against the Editor as sole executrix to Dr Berkeley to which she did not prove  till the middle of May although he died on the th of January and from a quarter she little expected and could hardly be persuaded to believe it by the very Reverend bringer of the intelligence who repeatedly assured her in the presence of her Sister that the whole affair was to be carried on in the most amicable way  The Commencer of this suit and the Editor have frequently had very warm amicable disputes concerning the lawfulness of  going to law  with your brother your neighbour or  any one  the commencer of the suit against the Editor constantly declaring that She thought it  so very  wicked that she would sooner give up  every shilling  she possessed the Editor constantly saying  "That seeing it  no where  forbidden in  any  part of her  oldfashioned  book and seeing St Paul in one of his Epistles blaming his converts for carrying their litigations before  Heathen  tribunals  Heathen  judges and  recommending  them to select some wise Christian to decide in matters of law  she  should if attacked  certainly  defend her right"  To which the Commencer of the suit used uniformly to reply  "Oh fye * * * * * you  cannot  be a Christian"  Here follows a proof  how little  we know ourselves how little we can judge how we shall act until called upon  to  act The Editor  was  called upon  to  relinquish The very Reverend the  of  her Lawyer the WORTHY Agent employed by  the Commencer of the suit a near kinsman both of his employer and Dr Berkeley all know that Mrs Berkeley instantly declared she was ready to do it and fearing lest Death might overtake her before the forms could be completed she instantly added a codicil to her will bequeathing the sum in dispute  It was in the Editor's will made soon after Dr Berkeley's death bequeathed to two nearer relations of Dr Berkeley's as the Editor  ever  esteemed  highwaymen  HONEST persons when compared with  childless  widows who rob their husbands family of what his generosity has bestowed on them to alleviate in  some little  measure the loss of an amiable companion and a reduced income The Editor has  very  little more than her own original fortune her  misfortune  now is that as a widow the largest part of her income is in Ireland alas for herAs an unmarried woman it was chiefly in that delightfully punctual repository for widows and maidens the BANK of ENGLAND  it could not be witnessed until past ten at night as is well known to her excellent Sister her servants and a worthy neighbour called in to witness it who came not home untill that late hour The  of  who brought her the intelligence said  "She  must  oppose it"  The Editor ignorant in many things besides law matters enquired why being ready to do every thing that was wished  "It must be pleaded"  was the answer The Editor then obeyed made a horrid hot journey from Oxford to London on the th of August and has in this  amicable  way been taking journeys feeing counsel swearingnothing but truth God the searcher of ALL  hearts well knows  And the obliging  patient  Mr Bush partner with Mr Jenner her Proctors he writing over six or seven times what she was to swear Mrs Berkeley so often assuring them  "that she  would not  swear to  any  thing that she was not of her own knowledge  certain was true  "  SHE fears an Oath at  least  as much as a subtle QUAKER Surely our SENATORS will not enable those  artful  creatures to take away the LIFE of MENby THEIR SOLEMN AFFIRMATIONGOD in MERCY avert it  at different times ever since until now June  It is now November the Editor correcting this sheether excellent Sister just returned from London called thither to give evidence  "That Eliza widow of the Reverend George Berkeley Prebendary of Canterbury c could  not secrete  a few lines of an  unsealed unwitnessed undated unfinished unsigned  WILL found in a corner of a lockedup closet in an house which she never was in in her whole life nor has she been in the  county  of Sussex since the year when she was at Tunbridge"  To be accused of  wilfully wickedly fraudulently  concealing the words of the citation an only begun will many months before the death of the testator is  too  much for a  poor frail  OLD  mortal  to bear without vindicating herself The Editor was told at Doctors Commons  "That the aspersing her  thus  was matter of FORM"  She assured an old gentleman there  "That were he to take it into his head to call her an HARLOT fashionable as it now is she would make him suffer soundly for his pains"    The Editor has heard from some  real  friends that  she  is much blamed for the opposition she has by the Commencer's friend the  of  been told she  must  make but she feared to share the fate of an amiable relation who neglecting to obey a summons from a Law Court on a suit instituted against her by her WORTHY son for neglect of paying a small annuity left by his father to  his aunt he enjoying then a paternal estate of two thousand pounds  per annum  and knowing he must inherit that of his uncle at least six thousand pounds  per annum  more suffered his  unfortunate  mother to be dragged to Winchester jail Mr Monck Berkeley on hearing it said  "I will never speak to him again whilst I breathe"  What a contrast between this rich  Squire and Richard Rainsford  The Editor has not seen this amiable gentleman since he was a lovely lively youth at Eton at a  Montem  before her marriage He then describing matters concerning it to his Mother and the Editor the word  to march  was given how he got down stairs the Editor knows not but in an instant he was in the statueyard in his proper place He was an exceedingly clever youth and was surely a most amiablehearted man probably is such if still living and must have joy of his own children  Esquire whose father lived many years ago in Windsor Forest whose mother's beauty the Editor admired at  five  years old who some years ago on his mother's jointure suffering some considerable diminution went immediately to her receiver and amiably  charged him  not to let his mother know it but pay her as usual that he would constantly make up the difference and never tell her lest she might think he could not afford it as he was married The Squire was married and Fame gave his Lady the credit of  this pious  deed to a most amiable  parent  who had suffered  very much  for him and his really worthy sisters from her tyrant savage husband he the Editor's relation and whom she used to  tune a little  for his  bearish  conduct as a  husband when she was only eighteen years old staying in the house on a visit to his lovely  suffering  Lady Mrs Berkeley cannot now read over his eldest sister Mrs  's letter giving her an account of the dreadful situation in which she and her accomplished partner who flew day and night to her found her without wetting it with a tear  Some persons were apt to disbelieve the above astonishing conduct of this Gentleman  See Brooke's excellent etymology of the words  Gentleman  and  Nobleman  in his Fool of Quality To be sure a man's being of a  very  antient family does not always make him a GENTLE  man  or a NOBLE  man ie  "of GENTLE  manners  of NOBLE  manners  "  pardon this misnomer to his Lady for he was a very good son until after his marriage On his becoming of age he was very desirous to have made over his paternal estate to his sisters and their heirs to take place on his coming into possession of his uncle's estate after the death of Lady  to which his worthy mother objected saying  "No Tom no wife or child of yours" thank God he has no child so the race it is to be hoped will be extinct in his own  sweet little  person "shall ever have it in their power to say that your mother and sisters fleeced you when you were a boy Your father has left your sisters very ample fortunes and they shall not have a shilling of your estate"  This as was observed happened  previous  to his marriage with the daughter of Sir    Some years ago the Editor was applied to by the lawyers of her WORTHY relation to give information when where and by whom his father and mother were married it being necessary to prove it before he could become seised of his grandfather's vast estate in * * * * * * * After repeated applications to Dr Berkeley to  make  the Editor tell and her Son's assuring her that if she did not tell them they would summon her into Westminster Hall she wrote  a  letter that scared yet diverted her beloved Husband and Son when she shewed it to them before she sealed it in which she pathetically laments  "having never heard or read in History or  Romance  of but two Monsters at whose suit  those who bore them  were imprisoned that one of them should be  her  kinsman the other the  tender  the  soft  the  delicate  the  compassionate  Sterne the seducer of ELIZA and the  distractor  of her husband the support of eight fine young children"  as some worthy wise man related in the Gentleman's Magazine at that time  The letter given us by Mr Walpole signed ANNE DORSET PEMBROKE AND MONTGOMERIE is perfect  milk  and  water  compared with the Editor's She preserves the copy a rare thing with her to make or take one in an elegant box for the  amazement  of an old friend or two who  admire  the  spirit  of the Editor who trusts that she attends to the advice of her blessed Master  "Be ye angry and sin  not"  Does not God say  "Who will rise up with ME against the wicked and who will take MY part against the evildoers"  The Editor ever has and hopes she ever shall when she thinks  it  necessary not in her  own  cause but her friends or her neighbours  Many arguments were used by Dr Berkeley and her Son to  blunt  the sentences of this letter but all in vain and Mr Monck Berkeley said  "Well Sir if my Mother  will not  write another this will prevent her being called up to give evidence in person as it will prove that she knows that Mr  was married to the daughter of Bishop  which is all that is necessary"  The Editor naturally rather a coward was once very near being murdered at least knocked down a tremendous thing to befal a poor little female One morning in winter the Editor never wastes the  summer  mornings in walking returning from her morning walk at Canterbury passing through the Cloisters there issued from the dark chapel called St Mary in Criptis violent blowson a nearer approach dreadful groans On turning to look into it the following words were heard  "Because I am old and feeble you take this time to abuse me when all the men are gone off to dinner"    "Yes you old dog I'll do for you I  promise  you"  The Editor much nimbler than at present flew in and there saw a sturdy young villain giving such  blows as she never saw before and hopes never to see again to a poor old silverhaired man She called out  "You wretch leave off how dare you beat the poor old man in this shocking manner"  He instantly replied  "I'll beat him to death what business is it of yours  I'll teach you to  meddle"  and clenching his fist advanced saying  "Who are you I'll teach you  "    "Who am  I Nobody  but my Husband is VICE DEAN and I will go home and send him to  trounce  you for beating this poor old man you  vile  wretch I promise you"  The Editor never felt pleasure before from Dr Berkeley's  local  dignities on this occasion it made her happy The Monste turned as pale as death flew by her and was quite out of sight in an instant She took the poor old man home to her house and desired her careful compassionate servants to see to him and give him some wine c to comfort him  The Editor feels it incumbent on her to declare that from the age of about seventeen when she began to consider seriously that Time is a point Eternity A NEVERENDING circle that she resolved to endeavour to discharge the relative duties of life as she felt she should wish at the  aweful  hour of death as a daughter a sister a friend a mistress a neighbour a wife and a mother  As a daughter the extremely tender attachment she felt for her mother from childhood added to gratitude for a very liberal expensive education rendered the studying to obey and delight her a  pleasant  task  As a sister Mrs Berkeley owned much for the  tenderest  love and never had when a girl the least idea of acting in character of  eldest  sister which she ever reprobatedThe idea of brothers and sisters being ANGRY at an imprudent match is to her wonderful they may be grieved Had the Editor's sister who  early  in life resolved never to marry any man as she told a friend some little time ago chosen to unite hereself with a chimneysweeper the Editor would have kept up friendship with her sister and civility with the  quondam  SWEEP The Editor conceives that the authority of PARENTS is not meant by God to extend to  children  of twentyfive thirty or  forty  years old  As a friend the Editor is certain she was faithful and secret she constantly laboured to be agreeable and she trusts she was obliging and complying It is a little remarkable that almost quite entire strangers to the Editor have requested to deposite important secrets to her keeping She never could conceive the reason She indeed has been told by more than one physiognomist that the lines of honesty are strongly marked in her countenance She never wished to know a secret lest as she used jokingly to say she  should reveal it in her sleep she was well assured she should not when awake  As a mistress which she became very early in life she endeavoured uniformly to treat every even the meanest servant in her house so as were she and they to exchange situations the next day she would wish them to treat her which once occasioned a very faucy very wicked vile housekeeper's saying to her  "You may be loved for aught I know and I believe you are by your servants but I promise you you will never be  obeyed  nor  well served  whilst you consider them so much  A most accomplished neighbour of Dr Berkeley once said  "Either Mrs Berkeley has the  best  servants in the kingdom or she is the  best  mistress for when all the rest of us are complaining of our servants you never hear her utter any thing like a complaint"  This gentleman and his lovely lady are a most excellent master and mistress themselves The Editor has in general been happy in worthy servants She has in the course of thirtysix years been visited by two devils  incarnate  in the capacity of housekeepers one the  "ugliest female"  dear Lady P  used to say  "that ever Nature formed"  one eyebrow of one colour light the other dark her eyes ditto forehead all covered with fears not  influted  at Newgate although she is a thief but by falling into her mother's an honest washerwoman embers She was a harlot to every man gentle or simple whom her cunning deceitful tongue could draw in still unmarried The other exceedingly handsome harlot to  no  man but cursed with a very black heart indeed married to an exceedingly worthy man May God in mercy grant them both  "  repentance unto life  "  The Editor when her friends are complaining of the worthlessness of their servants asks them these short questions  "  Do you teach  them  their duty  to  their  HEAVENLY MASTERDo you call them daily to family prayers and  force  them to hear God's word redde every day"  Did masters and mistresses of families consider that they MUST if negligent of the souls of their servants be infallibly accused by them  for  such negligence at the bar of God surely  "  as lovers of their ownselves  "  they would instruct their servants in their duty to God and manWant of time will not be admitted at that RIGHTEOUS BAR on that TREMENDOUS DAY  A few years ago a groom of a very old acquaintance of the Editor was sentenced to death for a highway robbery His master being at the Assizes the poor wretch turned to him and cried out  "Oh Lord Sir if I had minded what your honour said to me when I lived with you I had never come to this"  His worthy remarkably tenderhearted master replied  "Alas Tom but you would not attend to me so I was  forced  to turn you off"  This gentleman keeps his servants like the Editor as long as they are  keepable  Let  negligent  masters and mistresses who read the poor groom's testimony of his master's atrention to his soul draw  their own  inference  The Editor has the pleasure of knowing that in several instances her  "  labours with her servants have not been in vain in the  LORD"  and  earthly  LORDS have reaped the benefit as Mrs Wiggins many years the Editor's excellent conscientious cook now wife of Mr Wiggins baker in Dyot Street St Giles's a good neighbourhood lately told the Editor that his Grace of York sent twice a week all last winter to her shop for bread they send none out to any one and that Lord Lonsdale whilst in town sends two horses and serants three times a week for their bread finding that it is composed only of the best wheat flour yeast and salt and is better at the week's end than the generality of bakers' bread at two days The Editor used frequently to say without the gift of prophecy to this very worthy woman  "Whenever you set up for yourself you  must  prosper you are so conscientiously careful for those you serve"  It would be well if servants considered WHO it is that says  "  If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's  WHO  shall give you that which is your  OWN"  "  But the Editor ever  kept in mind the words of holy Job  "If I despised the cause of my man servant or my maid servant"  c  "Did not HE that made  me  make  them  "  c  As a neighbour Mrs Berkeley rejoiced always to render any little kind services in the power of so unimportant a person in the scale of beings as herself to do She had always a sort of  giving  spirit Dr Berkeley's very large garden at Cookham excellently planted and cultivated enabled the Editor to oblige her neighbours high and low Sometimes her dairy or her larder were a convenience to her neighbours Had she had a park fishponds or a pidgeonhouse she could have done more  An high Authority says  "To whom little is given of them shall be little required"  Had the Editor been placed in a high station with a large fortune to account for at the Great Day of Account which she most heartily thanks the mercy of God she has not she must have laboured more  A young man of very large fortune was one day abused by a large circle for spending it very ridiculously one said one way others another in which he ought to spend it At length after every one had said their say Mr Monck Berkeley looking very seriously said  "Poor young man I pity him I have always from a boy prayed earnestly to GOD that he would never bestow more money upon me than he would give me sense and grace enough to spend as I ought to do"  On which his mother  wickedly  exclaimed  "Oh my dear child so then you have I find been praying for POVERTY all your life"  To which he replied  "My dear mother be that as it may I always have done it and I always shall continue to do it"  When a young single woman she always declared  "that if the great Disposer of riches would suffer her to choose as a single woman maid or widow she would prefer a fortune of eight hundred pounds  per  annum  to one of eight thousand  For which her excellent Sister and an old acquaintance of hers used to laugh her to scorn saying  "  She is a poor little  unambitious soul Give us the eight thousand pounds  per annum  and let her enjoy her paltry eight hundred pounds"  Neither of the three have that annual income one has the really pretty word  Honourable  prefixed to her  Mrs    Somewhat of the same spirit was visible in an housemaid of old Lady Draper of Sunninghill Park grandmother of the late amiable pious T Baber Esquire Old Sir Thomas and Lady Draper were neighbours and intimate friends of the Editor's grandfather the very worthy John Finch Esquire of Fienes Court in whose clothes King Charles escaped with Lady Jane Lane They met often and Lady Draper not a  modern  fine lady but one of Solomon's looking  well  to the ways of her household  See Proverbs ch xxxi ver  finding sometimes occasion for a little objurgation one of her honest old housemaids used to say  "Aye well my Lady may threaten what she will BUT thank God she can never make  me  Queen of England that's my comfort"  Perhaps this honest woman had lived at Court and seen good quiet mild Queen Mary milling the old Dutchman's chocolate on her knees until her face perspired so as to need wiping This the Editor can assert is a fact it having been repeatedly told to her by her Mother to whom it was related by Mrs Lee daughter of Mr Lee page of the backstairs this lady was the Queen's goddaughter was perpetually with her used  to read the Bible to her some hours every day Every one remembers  "  Henrietta of Bourbon come and draw off my boots  "  Set a beggar on horseback and he will ride to the d  l It is to be feared one is almost tempted to say hoped such lowbred tyrants will ride  or fly  to  him  As a wife when a young woman she always resolved if she ever did marry she would  labour  to be what her excellent mother was universally said to be  "  The best wife in the world  "  The Editor has often said  "if she had been married to BELPHEGOR  Vide  "The Devil upon Two Sticks"  she would have  tried  to have made him a good wife that the poor Devil might at least have served out his time on earth"  As a mother if God vouchsafed to entrust her with the  great blessing  of children which she humbly hoped he would to be indefatigable in attending to their souls their minds their manners their persons and their fortunes It pleased the Divine Goodness to prosper her labours in every instance but the  last  certainly in her estimation the  least  She applied to one considerable gentleman whom she flattered herself gratitude for what he had twentyfive years before deemed  great  favours would have induced to have introduced her son to Mr Pitt who could had he been introduced and she doubts not  would  have effectually served him and himself at the same time but she  found verified  "Put not your trust in  any  child of man  Psalm cxliv ver  "  This gentleman exceedingly intimate with the Premier from early youth wrote the Editor for Dr Berkeley said he  could not  write to him  a very  polite letter of DECLINATIONin it speaking of his gratitude for Dr Berkeley's favours But she did put her trust in HIM who has never  yel  failed her and to whom she daily offers praise for having provided in  his own  BEST way for her beloved Son who used often to say  "What is to become of me if my health does not permit me to go to the bar"  To which his mother constantly replied  "Never fear trust God's word  Yet never saw I the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread  Psalm xxxvii ver  I have not the smallest doubt if it pleases GOD to spare your life that the descendant in fact as your father mother and aunt are out of the question the  only  descendant of Bishop Berkeley and Mr Cherry will  ever  be suffered to want either the convenieces or the  comforts  of life necessary in the station of life in which Providence hath been pleased to place you You know how  often  I have repeated to you the speech of the late Admiral Haddock to his children on his deathbed and how much  oftener  one of my favourite texts A  small  thing that the righteous hath is better than  great  riches of the ungodly  Ibid ver  "  So fearful was the Editor left her children when they grew up should be tempted to marry some girl whose thirty fifty or an hundred thousand pounds had been obtained by  gambling contracting willmaking  and various other  honourable  methods of obtaining a vast fortune ever hoping money so gained might  never  be brought by  marriage  into  her  familySo strongly and so early did she inculcate this and some other important matters on the minds of her children that one little angel who took its happy flight before it had lived eight years and a half one day said  "Mamma I have been thinking that if you do not live till I am old enough to marry I shall never marry at all"  Mrs Berkeley  "Why not my dear"  Little boy  "Why I am resolved you shall choose my wife for me then I am  sure  she will be a good one  The Editor cannot possibly although from the mouth of a poor child of seven years old add the compliment made by the sweet little creature to his mother  "  The Editor ever a friend to that holy institution ordained by God to  complete  man's felicity even before he fell replied  "Oh my dear if you pray to GOD he will direct you to a good wife"  The little boy shook his little head and said  "No no if you die I will NOT have a wife that will be the safest way for me I am sure"  The repetition of this curious dialogue at dinner the children not present being gone off to school afforded great diversion  Many persons will probably laugh at the Editor for frequently talking to her children as if they were grown up She followed in that instance the plan pursued by her wise mother who never expecting to live to see her daughters grow up gave them various rules of conduct that could she have ensured her life she might rather have told them at fifteen than at eleven One the Editor as she thinks it very wise will here set down  "If ever you marry and are not blessed with good health always keep it to yourselves unless you are too seriously ill to keep about Nothing wears out a man's love like hearing a woman always mewling and languishing and crying 'Oh my head aches sadly my stomach is disordered I am  nervous  today"  c c  The Editor had her daughter lived would have added  "Never weary your husband with the faults of the servants  or any family matters of which the lady if wise should bear the burden always taking care to make home as pleasant as possible to her husband"  That children at a very tender age attend seriously to what their parents say particularly if they love their parents may be proved by looking into Dodwell's  The Editor cannot here omit heaving a sigh over the amiable daughterinlaw of this learned man one of the three celebrated beauties at the Public Act at Oxford in before the Editor's birth the lovely lady of Archdeacon Dodwell whom a very gracious Providence sent through a very deep snow on foot one of her horses being lame to the Editor's mother's on the afternoon on which her angelic spirit took its happy flight to the realms of bliss almost in an instant Good God what were the sufferings of the Editor and her Sister on that dreadful night How much sorer but for that lovely friend who never quitted them until some time after the funeral Sweet spirit thou art receiving thy reward for that painful labour of love to the daughters of thy kind thy beloved revered friend This lovely lady left several sons and three excellent daughters two happy wives the third a most amiable mourning widow the eldest wife of  Ridding Esquire of Southampton the second wife of the Reverend  Holland minister of the Duke of Somerset's parish in Wiltshire The Editor often when residing at Magdalen Lodge called on to wonder at the excellent character of his Grace then at Christ Church constantly replied  "that  she could not  wonder as Mr Holland was there on the strictest friendship"  The third the lovely mourning relict of the uncommonly amiable Reverend J Southcombe of Devonshire In the possession of one of these worthy ladies whom the Editor has not seen for some years is probably a very curious little toy to which perhaps the Editor may in  some  measure owe what her friends and acquaintance used to style her very elegnt correct taste in dress It is certain she has  turned  many young ladies into  beauties  by directing them to dress as became their face and person It is wonderful all girls of sense do not attend to it without  entirely  departing from that ABSOLUTE MONARCH FASHION But to return to the toy which she the Editor conceives to be  now  if not always an  unique  for at no toyshop since she went to town at eighteen could she ever pick up one It is a silver case somewhat larger somewhat thicker than a crown piece on one lid is elegantly painted a beautiful young man and woman only decently covered The case contains about ten or twelve different fine dresses painted on isinglass which laid on the young couple sometimes exhibited them in one dress sometimes in another The Editor well remembers in one they appear as a chimneysweeper and his wife but the astonishing alteration that dress produces on the human features cannot be conceived by those who have not seen this little perhaps two hundred years old curiosity for the Editor never met with any person who had seen such a thing as this excepting those who have seen the one here described  life by Brokesby at the age of  five and Mr Newton's life in his letters at the age of six  The Editor could now she believes write down verbatim her excellent father's description of the infernal regions to her one Sunday evening when she was not quite seven pears old It is she well knows the beginning  "The FEAR of the LORD is the  beginning  of WISDOM"  As LOVE is the  fulfilling  of the Law c Bishop Taylor says  "Think what it will be for your soul when it quits the body to be  dragged  by devils"  c and the pious Dr Flavel says  "If you could hear what a  shriek  your POOR soul will give"  c  of what is now her sole delight  "The LOVE of CHRIST"  for rescuing her from misery so finely painted by her pious parent  Admiral Haddock when near his death thus addressed his family  "My dear children considering the situation I  am in and the advantages I have had I do not leave you as large fortunes as you might according to the world  reasonably  expect but what  I do  leave you I promise you my dear children  will prosper will wear well  for I have the comfort of knowing that it is not watered with the tears of one seaman's widow or orphan"  Wise happy  Admiral Two or three very remarkable instances might be adduced from his family to shew that the second commandment is not  yet  repealed the promise of  "Shewing mercy c"  as well as  "  Visiting to the third and fourth generation  The Editor grieves to hear about two years ago that one of the granddaughters of the excellent Admiral had taken for a second husband that tyrant  late Major in the  Regiment of horse to whom the spirited old fishwoman at Canterbury administered a good handful of Scotch snuff when the amiable Major was endeavouring to make his escape from the Riding escorted by the then Mayor and Alderman Smith to avoid being rolled in the kennel  properly  prepared for him by the Editor's worthy old neighbours on account of his  amiable  conduct to the poor soldiers He has  now  NO soldiers under his command but he has alas a poor illfated Lady The account of his treatment of the  said  poor Lady and the only servant he allowed her with a poor infant BRAT of  his own  about eight months old by a family of the Editor's acquaintance who passed some weeks at a wateringplace with them thrilled the Editor and Mrs Frinsham with horror They united in honouring the conduct of Miss  a young lady about seventeen whom compassion to her poor mother keeps with her often for many weeks together May GOD reward her with as kind an husband as her OWN father was  "  c  The late Lord  got a clause inserted in the Militia Act some years ago as Dr Berkeley and several Kentish  gentlemen told the Editor on purpose to enable a very highly respected friend of the Editor Captain Haddock the good Admiral's second son to qualify him to hold some commission in one division of the Kentish MilitiaHis attention to the men and their profiting none can forget who frequented Canterbury Cathedral about twenty years ago when they were quartered in that city  The Editor cannot here forbear relating a curious anecdote of this excellent gentleman Very many years ago when we were at war with Spain and some considerable town was taken the Churches were despoiled of their fine pictures four or six very large exquisitely fine ones were purchased by a Captain of a man of war lying near the city and at his return to England presented to Admiral Haddock who had a good collection at WrothamPlace the Admiral's seat they remained in the drawingroom many long years the admiration of all whose eye can be delighted by fine paintings  A few years ago on the death of the very worthy  Haddock Esquire the good Admiral's eldest son the estate house c devolving to the Editor's pious friend he wrote over to the Church in Spain whence the fine pictures had been pillaged when the town was sacked desiring to be informed by what method he might restore them to the temple whence they had been torne The righteous offer  was gratefully accepted and Mr Haddock has to his real unaffected piety the delight of thinking that instead of  robbing  God he has restored what even his ancestors did not wrest from the temple of God Oh that all who have robbed GOD in Tithes  It is wished that there was a new edition of Sir Henry Spelman's History of Sacrilege which the Editor studied hard at sixteen years old and so inculcated its doctrine on her Son that nothing would have induced him to have any thing to do with them  would make restitution Our poor Clergy of the Church of England would not then be so straightened even those with what are called good livings of three or four hundred pounds  per annum  as they now are What is three hundred pounds  per annum  after taxes c are paid to keep and dress decently a gentleman his wife five children to be educated and three servants  "If in this life  only  they the Clergy have hope in Christ they are of all men most miserable"  says St Paul  On the Editor's congratulating her friend on his worthiness his  happiness  on so doing he replied  "My dear Madam I only wonder that my father and brother  left  it for  me to do  but I dare say it never occurred to them that it was practicable or I am sure they would not have failed to do it"  What makes Mr Haddock's merit double is that he loves fine pictures of sacred history as well as the Editor and is an excellent judge of painting  and had a small collection before he became possessed of Wrothamplace when he resided at Canterbury where Dr Berkeley and the Editor became acquainted with him his worthy lady and family  It has been already mentioned that Mr Berkeley used to say that  "The Editor laid all the faults aukwardness c that any man committed on his MOTHER excepting what related to him as a scholar bad Greek or Latin"  The Editor has through life asserted and maintained against  some  of her friends that there are  certain  elegances to be learned in the house of a father in a certain rank of society  before  the age of fifteen which if not learned  before  that age  are never  attained certainly the diningroom the drawingroom conversation of persons of good education must necessarily be  very  different from the tabletalk of good honest people in the parlour behind the shop in an Alley in Cheapside or in Cities where the Grammarschool is supported by the Dean and Prebendaries as at Canterbury York Gloucester c  The Editor's Canterbury chairman's son is she hears a very worthy Divine the son of Mr B  h's footman is a very learned Divine and Dr Berkeley told the Editor a very few years ago that  "the very learned Mr Naylor upper master of the King'sschool at Canterbury told him as did some other gentlemen that the best scholar  in the school was the son of Dr Berkeley's butcher Stephen Couchman then eighteen fit for the University but his mother would not suffer his very rich father to send him thither but made him stay at home knock down oxen and carry out meat"  The Editor saw him with a basket on his shoulder during her last visit to Canterbury This youth will be tempted to  curse  instead of  bless his  mother The sons of such sometimes very worthy persons if sent to St Paul's or MerchantTailorsSchool may be at least as good  often  better  Latin  and  Greek  scholars than the sons of noblemen or gentlemen BUT they cannot have listened the three holyday months of the twelve to refined elegant cultivated persons' manner of expressing their ideas and sentiments It is not possible that the wife of a butcher or baker c should attend to the  manner  in which her son pronounces the vowels the  few  vowels introduced into our English language the melting them all down as the Editor frequently remarks to her friends may make a very good  hodgepodge  but SHE prefers the component parts separate The Editor well remembers that when the WORTHY Mr Blacowe was for his ZEALOUS services at Oxford preferred by the Ministers of George the Second to a Canonry of Windsor sure it had been  wiser  to have exalted and  hidden  him in some less elegant place a very learned refined cultivated friend of the Editor's said  "The man reads like a  bargeman  "  To which the Editor replied  "He reads like a  lowborn  man  for he has been taught only  two  of the five vowels"    "What do you mean"    "Why he melts the E the O and the U all into one so has only A with which in  reading  he  constantly  couples W and except when used for  ego  always metamorphoses I into U 'He  gUrdeth  himself c' and the '  GUrdle  of his  lines  ' for '  loyns  ' 'He  makUth  the  cloWEds  ' The U he turns into EW 'TREWLY God is loving unto Israel"    "Well to be sure"  replied the gentleman  "he does just what you say"  The late agreeable H B  B  Esquire when dining with Mr Blacowe's nextdoor neighbour used to say  "C  r is Blacowe at home if he is I must mind and not take a glass too much for fear I should say something and have an  informaWgion  against me"  The Editor's father having taken incessant pains with his girls they lost him alas when the eldest was just eleven years old the Editor bestowed the same attention on her children which undoubtedly adds wonderfully to the beauty both of speaking and reading and she found a most  incomparable  coadjutor in the exquisitely elegant Dr Beauvoir who as Mr John Hey above named frequently told the Editor was wonderfully  strict  in making the boys at the King's school mark their vowels in speaking English so  very  sharply admiring much how accurately Dr Berkeley's children pronounced them Dr Beauvoir was  really  a fine gentleman as well as a  very great  and elegant scholar  of the former the Editor was a judge her amiable partner of the latter his father and mother both as the Editor has frequently been told  "exquisitely elegant persons of antient families"  Dr Beauvoir was an exceedingly grateful man to the family of his kind generous patron Dean Lynch and also to the Editor for the little attentions bestowed on his daughter Mrs Hammond such as sometimes crowding her an eighth into her coach from a country as well as a city rout Dr Berkeley used goodhumouredly to say for he was ever ready to oblige as well as serve all  "  My  coach  is  the CANTERBURY HACK"  Yet on Mrs Berkeley's last melancholy visit there she found that  some  of those with whom she had frequently crowded her coach and been reproached by Mrs  and Miss  for so doing could not find an uncrowded place for her supposing it good for an infirm tender halfblind aged matron to walk about that antient city in the dirt and rain  The Editor thinks that she cannot bid adieu to Canterbury without making mention of the conduct of some of old and new friends there of the lovely studied attentions of the throughly amiable Mrs Piercyof the NEW sweet Mrs Weston and to Dr Luxmore from whom Mrs Berkeley an entire stranger on the strength of the character given of him by her dear Son presumed to ask a favour for a friend which he most politely most amiably granted  To the little Auditor for NOBLE gratitude to the Widow of the gentleman to whose indefatigable zeal he obtained that lucrative situation when little more than a  boy for ordering the thirteen  rings  for his patron instead of being guinea rings to be moidore  ie  twentyseven shilling rings On Mrs Berkeley enquiring if those of any former Prebendary or Dean had been  so  costly He replied  "No but that the widow of a worthy Apothecary lately deceased had ordered such for her  cousins  "  To which Mrs Berkeley replied  "That as Dr Berkeley was  not  an  Apothecary  nor the Prebendaries  her cousins  guinea ones might have done"  He said  "He had also ordered one for  himself  "  Ulysses exclaims  "Gods how the sons degenerate from the sires"  Mrs Berkeley really believes the father of this little man to be one of the most generous of men of what is  his own  he presented to his brother six thousand pounds Mrs Berkeley cannot avoid contrasting this provident  little  batchelor with his near neighbour and brother lawyer Mrs Berkeley having some law business to transact applied to Mr Cummyn  The Editor earnestly wishes that she could send Mr Cummyn over to Ireland that she may not be obliged to send  herself  into an English Cottagefor in a Castle or in a  Cavern  she must pay the butcher and baker every Monday morning The Editor always did from fifteen years old close the account of her cloaths as well as of her house on the last day of the old year The cloaths account many years of late excepting two doleful years of mourning did not amount to more than ten pounds this year to little more than four heelpiecing shoes mending clogs and a little black ribband tape and thread all regularly entered including one pound one for a permit to hide with powder her poor old frizzling locks which she has done but twice since May Alas why will not Mr Pitt pity poor aged Widows and aged Maidens It is shameful to make poor old creatures pay a Guineato  prevent  their frighting the CROWS    brother of Captain Cummyn who accompanied Admiral Byron to Patagonia who executed the business speedily and well On Mrs Berkeley's calling one morning to desire her bill he observed  "That it was really so trifling that it was not worth while to charge any thing"  On Mrs Berkeley's remonstrating with him he very politely amiably replied  "That it had been discharged before it had been contracted by Mrs Berkeley's attention to his wife and daughter"  They were alas trifling Mrs Berkeley was of too little importance in the world to benefit any one much however finding that although she could  not  get money  out  of the Auditor's hands eleven pounds until she had proved Dr Berkeley's will she could not possibly get any into the hands of the worthy generous Mr Cummyn she found amongst her things a little offering which he was so obliging as to accept as a  souvenir  of an old neighbour  On Dr Berkeley then in Scotland announcing Dr Beauvoir's marriage with Miss Sharpe he said to his son  "Berkeley you do not seem  much astonihed  at it"  On which Mr Monck Berkeley replied  "Why no my dear Sir  I am not astonished at all  for if a lady wished for an agreeable companion I do declare I do not know where she could  possibly  have found a more agreeable man than  my  old master and I am very glad he has got the lady that he may not  toil  on as he used to do with  us idle  dogs"  Mr Berkeley revered those who in his youth  laboured to  FORCE him to learn Mention is made in the Mémoires de le Duc de Saint Simon of one of the Princes of the Blood who  never would forgive  his preceptor's not having  compelled  him to study in his youth He was certainly a man of  strong  understanding if not of  learning  The Editor feels that had not her Parents bestowed the best education on her that money could procure she never could have loved them living or respected their memory if  she  did not profit by it the fault was  her own  Mr Monck Berkeley was quite of his mother's mind A rather diverting anecdote shewing Mr Monck Berkeley's ideas concerning education when a boy is here subjoined  The very grateful agreeable Mr Taswell Rector of Aylsham in Norfolk wrote to Dr Berkeley saying  "That he meant to wait on him for two or three days in his way to town and he hoped Mrs Berkeley would permit  him to bring his little girl who was going to town to visit an aunt"  The day before their arrival Mr Monck Berkeley said to his father  "I suppose as soon as ever breakfast is over and Mamma has been to the larder and ordered dinner she will take Miss Taswell up stairs get the French and Italian grammars and the maps and teach her  all  her lessons over and examine her  throughly  "  Dr Berkeley was wonderfully diverted with his  son's idea  not then thirteen years old as Mrs Berkeley always told her children  "that as soon as ever they entered their  teens  the words  Papa  and  Mamma  were to be laid aside for  my Father  and  Mother  when speaking  of  their parents  Sir  and  Madam  as usual when speaking  to  them"  and exclaimed  "You monkey do  you think  because your Mamma  worries  herself every day of her life to  teach you  that she will plague herself to teach other children No no nothing but her  violent  love of  you  could make her slave as she does Your mother's delight is in  learning  not in  teaching  I wish to God you had your mother's rage for knowledge it would be a happy thing for you"  Mrs Berkeley certainly had that rage from her very early youth and it continued with her until she lost her idol It is not yet quite extinct the flame is out but the embers still glow a little  A wonderfully wellinformed respected friend the Lady of the late Governor  being in the Editor's room many years ago mentioned something in Astronomy that was new to the Editor she sprang out upon the staircase and called out to Mrs then Miss Frinsham  "  Sister sister  come hither this minute and Mrs  will make you as wise as SOLOMON"  Mrs Frinsham dressing for dinner said  "I am without my cloaths"    "  Never mind your cloaths  but come directly"  The worthy lady laughed so violently that it recovered Mrs Berkeley from her extacy of joy on gaining some addition to her delightful if not useful knowledge It has often been the subject of mirth to the three friends Mrs Berkeley also dressing disengaged herself like lightning from under the hands of her maid  But to return to the uncommonly sensible amiable very highly accomplished Miss Taswell  She  needed no instruction from Mr Berkeley's mother Her own excellent father throughly sensible of the blessing of a good education has spared no pains no cost to bestow it on his daughters The young lady above named her father a few months ago when he visited the Editor told her he was going to lose Happy the young gentleman who gains her The Editor knows him not but if he is not a happy husband she is  firmly  persuaded that the fault must be  entirely  in himself  The Editor has known and admired the merits of Miss Taswell since she was  seven  years old at that very early period by the wise care of her mother she was absolutely better qualified to conduct a  moderate  sized family than most of the  Misses of seventeen are now  The Editor often wishes to be told what it is that modern young ladies are taught but nobody that she meets with can tell her except it is a little music whether they have ear or  no  ear matters not and to speak a sort of gibberish something in short that is not English for English very few of them can speak fewer write The Editor now sees no beautiful worked gowns or aprons all is COBBLEstitched which the dairymaid could perform as well as Miss  The Editor is sometimes asked  "HOW SHE  would have  young ladies educated"  Her reply is  "As the Lady of Sir RichardCarr Glyn was One of her amusements when about twelve years old was putting poor little girls to school to learn to work walking out of a summer evening to see how they had worked calling on the sick poor in their cottages relieving their necessities reporting their situation to her worthy parents"  Dr and Mrs Berkeley dining one day at Barston with the very sensible worthy Mr and Mrs Harvey parents of the late  of the present brave and to the Editor obliging Admiral Harvey he favouring her with the perusal in MS of his tremendous voyage with the late Lord Mulgrave the Editor met the lovely little lass going on one of these pleasant walks Mrs Berkeley used to tell her son many years after  "that if he had a good long rentroll to produce she would have advised him to go and make his bow to the excellent Miss Plumtre"  The Editor heard from her Son that the daughters of an amiable Duke and Duchess are educated  "  selon mon goût  "  and she hears from some of her friends that the Lady Greys daughters of Lord Stamford are excellently educated as of her own knowledge is Miss Ormsbey niece of her amiable friend Mrs Owen niece to the late Lord Godolphin About a week ago the Editor received a letter from a very antient  very worthy  Baronet whom she has known since he was eleven years old requesting  her  "to  recommend a  GOOD  wife to him  "  The Editor laying down the letter exclaimed  "I fear Sir  has lost his wits"  In the  wise  days of the WISE KING we read that they were  rather  scarce What a request to make to a poor forlorn oldfashioned creature quite retired from life  "the world forgetting by the world forgot"  The Editor has been several times asked  "what can have induced her to quit the gay neighbourhood of Windsor and  bury herself  ALIVE in the little dull town of Chertsey"  Her constant reply  "that she may not be called upon to  bury  DEAD"  the last  near  if not the last dear relative that the wisdom of PROVIDENCE has spared to soothe her woes and  smooth  her passage through the  ugly  vale of years to the tomb Mrs Berkeley assures her enquiring friends that it is impossible the air ever should be stagnant with Mr Fox within one mile on one side and Sir Joseph Mawbey on the other The Editor has not yet seen either of these sensible men probably they do not visit aged matrons That her spirit cannot stagnate with so  very judicious  an Evangelical a Preacher as the Reverend Mr White curate of Chertsey Nor is it possible the little wits that affliction illness and a premature old age have left her should stagnate whilst she is frequently favoured with the visits of her and Dr Berkeley's wonderfully witty friend the learned Reverend E W Whitaker of Thorpehouse This gentleman has as much wit as his celebrated father the Serjeant and he has what alas his learned witty father had not All the country is rejoicing that Mr Whitaker has taken out his dedimus He has already diverted the Editor and her sister with one or two JUSTICE  adventures  Add to this the acquisition of Lady and Miss Young mother and sister of sir William Young She therefore flatters herself that she shall not just yet become an  absolute  vegetable    The Editor admires the wisdom of Colonel  who a few five or six years ago carried his daughters to  York for the winter Some one said  "I see Sir you have brought the young ladies that they may have a little  pleasure  "    "No indeed I have brought them that they may get a little  profit  that they may spend their mornings at Mrs  name forgotten a famous pastrycook c in order that they may know how to make good wives if ever they marry and by understanding the management of a family try to keep their husbands out of a  jail  If their mother pleases she may take them to some diversions in an evening sometimes"  The Colonel is a wise man probably his daughters will not  "  hang on hand  "  The Editor does so  loath  the present  horridly  ugly bold  indecent  It is so prostituted in these  equallizing  days as is quite diverting During the Editor's residence at Magdalenelodge she went one evening to the house of a gardener to speak about some fruit his wife a laundress she saw a very tall girl  "  arrayed in purple and fine linen  "  a fine muslin dress and a most sumptuous lilac bandau  odiously  tied  behind  instead of elegantly on the left side large bows and the ends hanging down  quite  to the ground Struck with so much finery sweeping along on the floor of a very small redbricked kitchen Mrs Frinsham asked  "who is that"  The good laundress replied  "Her father is Porter of  College poor  young lady  she has lost her  mamma  and she is very fond of coming to visit my daughters"  How are young ladies  fallen  dress of the  young females  she cannot will not prostitute the pretty elegant words young ladies to bestow them upon beings resembling Swift's YAHOOS  God Almighty when speaking in the Holy Scriptures of any thing remarkably lovely condescends to compare it to a beautiful Virgin certainly the most lovely being created in this lower worldnot a modern English young womanvirgins  they  will probably remain even were war to cease  "and the  fire not to consume our young men  "  OUR maidens would not however given  to  be  taken in  marriage  Psalm lxxviii ver    The Editor one day at the Oaks hearing three young men on a visit to her son two of high birth the other has attained much in his profession of arms talking of the charms of the  Belles the Editor said  "What signifies  talking  and  sighing  over them You had better marry and settle down quietly"  One replied  "Why my dear Madam one cannot afford to marry the young ladies are become so horridly expensive"  He has ventured on a  Country  Baronet's daughter very prudently educated by a wise worthy mother and the Editor pronounces her Ladyship a very happy woman if it is not her own fault for  unites with the gentleness of the dove the prudence of the serpent and he has a noble estate She trusts that he does not suffer her Ladyship to dress like a Yahoo  Whoever remembers Twickenham forty years ago if they had not the felicity of visiting Mrs Isham eldest daughter  of Sir Justinian Isham must have envied those who did visit her This agreeable worthy lady is introduced here on account of a repartee of hers to her father when it is probable young ladies dressed so as to make conquests of worthy sensible men Alas for sweet Mrs Isham and a most amiable young gentleman  she  did BUT by the  perverseness  of a father on one side and the covetousness of an uncle on the other it was  decreed  they were  not  to be united The gentleman died of a  broken heart  very soon the lady survived about forty years resolved never to marry The  lovelorn tale  too long to be inserted here is never related by the Editor without filling her eyes with tears after which she amuses herself and her auditors by  execrating  the  father  and  uncle  After the death of Lady Isham  ald Sir Jus  as he was always styled thought  very unwisely  he would  abridge  the young ladies of their  annual  visit to London They gave several broad hints At length the abovenamed lady said  "Dear Sir I hope you will let us go to town this spring"  Sir Jus  "To town girls What should you go to town for No no you are very happy here in the country"  Young Lady  "But we want to buy some new cloaths Sir"  Sir Jus  "  New cloaths indeed  Why the Scripture tells you that the KING'S DAUGHTER was allglorious  within  "  Mrs Isham  "Yes Sir but it also tells us that  her cloathing was of wrought gold  and we wish to resemble her outwardly as well as inwardly"  The wit of the young lady prevailed one cannot say over the  wisdom  of the father To do justice to Sir Justinian finding that by his parsimony he had doomed his lovely daughter to perpetual celibacy he bequeathed her a much larger fortune than he gave to any of his other younger children but to be sure one must say that had Botany Bay been discovered he deserved to have been exiled thither and the sensible amiable Mr R  's rich old uncle ought to have been hanged outright without benefit of clergy for forcing a rich fool into the arms of his nephew Alas the actors  of  and  in  this tragedy are all now retired behind the scene  It always provokes the Editor to hear a stupid father or mother telling poor girls that they are  happier  at their elbow than at the raceball No let young people have a reasonable share of  innocent  amusement Why should man be more rigid than God who says by his Prophet Jeremiah  "Thou shalt again go forth in the dances of them that make  merry  "  It cannot therefore  be  SIN  The Editor never suffered Mr Monck Berkeley to call her Mamma after he entered his teens telling him it was like a lamb but when speaking of her always "My Mother" of course from the time he could articulate "Madam" when speaking to her  The Editor holds in detestation the idea of children of whatever age calling their parents  Mr  or  Mrs  when speaking to them insomuch that sometimes when the Editor after Mr Monck Berkeley was grown up has been inattentive to what her Son was saying to her after he had called  Madam  two or three times he would say  "Well Madam if you will not listen to me  I protest  I will call you Mrs Berkeley"  It has always had the desired effect procuring an answer  "And I  protest  if you do  I will knock  you down"  The last ridotto before the Editor married at about eight in the evening thus late by her own request the famous Mr  hairdresser attended her to try to make her wonderfully curling hair like an African's keep straight as was the fashion then for a few hours Observing the poor man ready to faint she asked  "if she should order the servant to bring him a glass of wine"  On its arrival the Editor asked  "if he would have a bit of toast"  He replied  "She was very good and if it would not be too much trouble to Mr Joseph" a very worthy greyheaded servant of Mrs Frinsham and the Editor before her marriage  "he should be very glad for that he had not tasted bit or sup since eight in the morninghad been flying over the town to ladies"  The Editor pitying him he said  "He was used to it all the Winter in a greater or less degreethat he seldom got hom to dinner till six o'clock a  ton  hour nowthat he often begged Mrs  his wife not to wait for him"  This so struck the Editor that the next day she conjured Dr then Mr Berkeley that if ever she became his wife which she did on the Easter Tuesday following he would never call her MRS BERKELEY but his WIFE when he spoke of her and by her Christian name when he spoke  to  her wishing to be  "some how"  as we Berkshire folks say distinguished from her hairdresser's  lady  who a few years after by the death of a rich old miller his uncle kept a chariot and saved Mrs  the trouble of waiting dinner for him He then ceased to wait on the ladies He was an excellent hairdresserthe Editor hopes he made a good Esquire  POSTSCRIPT  THE EDITOR takes this opportunity of publishing her heartfelt gratitude to several excellent friends who have most generously most kindly most amiably assisted her in various ways since her being left forlorn and desolate to struggle to wade though much intricate unpleasant some  quite unexpected  businessHer gratitude to her old excellent friend Sir Richard Hillto Dr Berkeley's old friend the Dean of Herefordto the throughly amiable hearted Dr Lynch Prebendary of Canterburyand to the very grateful Reverend Charles Sawkins Student of Christ Church have been already noticed  The Editor wants an abler pen than her own to express what she feels for the exceedingly great kindness of that unwearied friend Commissioner Hey of the Customs with whose exquisite wit the Editor's spirit has not been regaled for many years until an opportunity presented itself of shewing what the Editor has long known that brilliant as that gentleman's wit is his worth exceeds it as numbers benefited by it can testify The amiability of  that gentleman's heart was ever admired by Dr Berkeley What does he now feel towards him and every kind worthy friend of his perplexed Widow  The excellent generous Mr Wilberforce the Editor although very highly obliged to his goodness has never yet seen  To the very obliging polite Mr Edwards Bookseller in Pall Mall the Editor is much indebted for very judicious kind advice given in a matter of which the Editor had not a competent knowledge and of which Mr Edwards was an excellent judge  The Editor is likewise much indebted to the very worthy Printer of Mr Monck Berkeley's Poems and to his Compositors for the patience they have shewn in  deciphering  the  crowded interlined  generally illwritten sheets of this Preface in which are few errors of the  press  although many of the  pen  The Editor when writing a common letter in haste sometimes leaves out three words of a sentence occasioned by a vile trick contracted in early youth of softly saying her sentence as she is writing and dull as her wits now are they reverse the old Proverb  "of not letting one's tongue run before one's wit"  for the Editor wishes that her pen could only keep pacc with her wits slow as they now are it  would save her friends the few who are still  visited  by her letters  The Editor means here to adopt rather to  adapt  a Scottish fashion The people of North Britain have many clever some elegant ones Of the latter is the always going dressed in a black gown or coat the first visit after the family visited have lost a near relation The Editor has constantly practised it since her return from Scotland Just before the Editor set out for Scotland she was driven by her dear Son several miles in the phaëton to make one of these distressing visits at the house of anot very distant relation where they met half the  "  fine folk  "  of Berks They were fine in a double sense as they were persons of fashion all clad in red blue green c ladies and gentlemen Lady  was very elegantly very gaily dressed Mr Berkeley and his Mother of course in mourning and the mourning of both was internal as well as external On driving out of the court yard the Editor as if she had taken a peep at Scotland said to her Son  "My dear Berkeley it has really sickened me to see so many gaudy colours in this house of mourning"  One of the former is an article in the Edinburgh newspapers After the death inserted  "It is hoped his or her relations will accept  this  notification of his or her death"  The Editor having been obliged on account of the tender health of her last near and exceedingly dear relative her excellent sister to quit the clear fine sharp air of Datchet Terrace for the mild soft air of Surrey has taken a house at Chertsey where she expects to be quite beggared by postage One penny for every newspaper Well what is that Why thirteen shillings  per annum  addition for the Saint James's Chronicle one penny with every scrawl she puts  into  the post and one penny with  every  letter that she gets by the post frank or no frank The names of her two kind  pocket  MP's as she always styles her two excellent old friends Sir Richard Hill and Sir Robert Laurie avail no more than were they instead of two most excellent Senators the two heroes of an old ballad sung to the Editor by her mother's maids when she was a girl which begins  "Robert and Richard were two pretty men  "And they lay abed till the clock it struck ten" c  The Editor unless her new neighbour Mr Fox or somebody can get a post  to  Chertsey must if GOD spares her life once a quarter insert in the Saint James's Chronicle  "  This is to certify those whom it may concern that Mrs George Berkeley is still living at Chertsey Surrey  "  She has this day December received eight letters Besides the postage she pays a penny each to the civil old man who brought them  from  Stains that is eightpence and as every one must be answered eightpence more to carry them to Stains so that she is now fully resolved seriously to tell all her friends that she cannot afford to receive or answer their kind letters although they should be franked As to those of her foes she will not suffer her servants to take in a letter in an unknown hand The franking bill and paper tax will soon reduce FEMALES to a state of barbarism again as the Editor conceives The Editor is resolved to advise all her female acquaintance to give up letterwriting even her few young friends to wait and give  vivâ voce  the account of their  conquests cruelty  c c accounts of lovers old and new to their friend Dr Berkeley always said  "If the Minister once gets the House of Commons to give up franking it is over with them Like Sampson they become weak like other men"  Since sending this to press the Editor is told by her servant that the letters when carried to the civil humble Postman  The letters are all deposited in a very large heap on a neat clean white dresser whence one may as easily  take  as  lay  a letterbut the Editor has no Bank Bills to  send off  who always came like the rollboy c with one knock until the Editor advised him to feel his  own  consequence and give two  smart  raps as  other  Postmen every where do and as he now does The worthy man said  "He hoped people would not think it  presuming  in him"  Good humble man perhaps he may sometimes be charged with a letterfrom the COUNTESS OF PUDDLEDOCK vide Faery Tale or some such great Personage to some Chertsey traderor perhaps a sheet to the Editorwho if on a Saint'sday can hardly get time before three o'clock when she  must  eat her dinner and the post sets off for Stains at  five  o'clock so letterwriting is here handsomely taken leave of by the Editor and for the St James's Chronicle she will order them to lie till some neighbour goes to town who will bring them postage freesit down and read a batch together as she has heard is done in the East Indies for which she has often pitied the  poor  rich Nabobesses They may now pity  her  It must hurt the revenue the abridging girls of writing  "What  reams  of paper as Lady B  r used to say did the Editor and her Ladyship's lovely niece  waste  in writing to each other"  Her Ladyship had no  great  talents for letterwriting and here the Editor ABJURES it and advises all her acquaintance and friends to do it except some friend will take charge of a letter and then as is frequently the case  forget to deliver it  Since writing the above the Editor finds that the clever way of getting to and sending letters from Chertsey is with a yard of ribbon or small piece of cloth c for what with the opposition coaches and waggon the carriages that pass and repass from London to Chertsey are going nearly the Editor believes quite half a score times every day Sundays NOT excepted which makes it exceedingly convenient indeed and very reasonable Blessings on opposition may all the inhabitants of Chertsey and its  environs  say Bishop Berkeley used to say  "It is  over  with  England  when there is NO opposition  But  it should be kept under"  a vast deal of troubleand herself also if she  has leisure to run them over the lamenting and correcting her nonsense  The Prophet exclaims  "Are there none amongst all the sons that she hath brought up to take her by the hand to guide her"  The Editor replies  "No not one"  There are four Irish gentlemen every one men of large fortune and appointments whose  only  home for very many years' residence at Eton and Harrow School for the three months holydays of every year was the house of their relation Dr Berkeley  To the Etonian a gentleman of many thousand pounds a year for ages in the family his sweetly amiable father constantly took care to  make  Dr Berkeley's Irish debtors pay with tolerable punctuality If they did not by the  generosity of his excellent kind relation Mr Monck of Grange Gormond father of the Marchioness of Waterford it was pretty much the same to Dr Berkeley Mr Monck saying to his amiable brother  "Whether Dr Berkeley's people pay or not remit his money regularly on my account they will pay some time or other"  Such favours can never be obliterated from a grateful mind The three others had  no  such claim nor any claimand on their arrival at Harrow School in the year their uncle said they were to remain seven years the year round holydays and all as schoolboys The Editor felt for them and besought Dr Berkeley to let them come to him He replied  "I will not have YOU tormented with all the BRATS of my Irish relations turning yourself into a  boarding dame  "  Mrs Berkeley conjured Dr Berkeley to send the coach to fetch them for three or four days that she might see what sort of geniuses they were and if they were well behaved a little mutton c would not be much expence in a family of thirteen or fourteen persons Accordingly she prevailedas women generally do with wise men if their aim is worthy and they set  rightly  about it  Soon after Dr Berkeley's marriage a younger brother of Dr Joshua Berkeley now Dean of Tuam whose only  English  home during his stay at Westminster school and long after at Christ Church Oxon was Dr Berkeley's house came with his worthy eldest brother and his youngest to visit Dr Berkeley at Bray The youth for whom Dr Berkeley had procured a studentship of Christ Church fell ill of the smallpox and Dr Berkeley's mother then at his house thought it  better  that the Editor who had never had the smallpox should leave the house rather than Master William Berkeley although Mr Falwasser the Apothecary assured her there was not the least danger attended the removing the youth It very nearly cost the Editor her life she lost her infant and the taking a readyfurnished house to reside in for three months scouring  spoiling  beds curtains c lest the Editor should get the smallpox that in her family  direful  disease cost Dr Berkeley an hundred pounds He SENSIBLY felt the  only  return he met with from his uncle or either of his learned sons    Mrs Berkeley is sorry to be obliged to say that neither of these gentlemen who used to weep  The late amiable Mr Henchman of All Souls coming in one day saw Charles  Esq with his arms round Mrs Berkeley's neck sobbing and the tears flowing plentifully from the Editor's eyes exclaimed  "What is the matter Is not this very extraordinary"  To which Dr Berkeley replied  "No it is always the case when they leave us They love my wise I believe  better  than their mother I am sure  she is an excellent mother to them  and the coach has been at the gate this half hour to carry them to Harrow"  This gentleman paid attention to Mr Monck Berkeley when in Ireland and on Mrs Berkeley's writing to him a few years ago requesting him to make enquiry in Dublin concerning a young gentleman son of a Canterbury neighbour just then married to an Irish lady of good family and as the event has proved merit he obligingly compliedand in one of his letters  politely  said he had not forgotten favours received at Dr Berkeley's The Editor's friend Mrs D  says that Ireland is  "  the land  where all things are forgotten"  This lady has or had one  vautrien  friend an English woman who marrying greatly in Ireland as most English women do gave herself high airs and forgot her English friends She took care that the late excellent Mrs G  l should not forget her for she drew upon her regularly for an annuity that generous woman had settled upon her when a  poor English  beauty  bitterly when leaving her to return to school ever wrote to Dr Berkeley on the loss of his excellent Son or to the Editor since to offer to assist her in her Irish affairs  Mrs Berkeley feels herself indebted to the goodness of CharlesBerkeley Kippax Esquire greatnephew of Bishop Berkeley whom the Editor never saw until about three years before the death of Dr Berkeley and whom she with all her rhetoric could not persuade Dr Berkeley to invite to his house at holyday times he saying  "You shall not be  devoured  by my relations Kippax has uncles in England"  To this gentleman she has since her loss of Dr Berkeley been obliged for some assistance in her Irish affairs and she has endeavoured to shew her gratitude otherwise than by mere words  The Editor before she finally closes this Postscript wishes to repeat to her few remaining friends in distant parts for alas numbers have within a short space gone to those distant shores whence they  cannot return  until TIME shall be no more her change of abode since the writing and printing the Dedication  Mr Monck Berkeley early in life made to himself a solemn promise that he would never write a Dedication during his life lest as he used to say the Devil should tempt him to flatter with his pen knowing he would not with his tongue  thatalthough she cannot now boast of keeping as she used to do when resident at the Oaks the  best  and  cheapest  inn at Canterbury where she had often the pleasure of returning the amiable attentions paid to her Son in town by persons to whom neither his Father or Mother had the honour to be known and as  they  sometimes  found the  pleasure  of being acquainted withshe resides at present at Chertsey where when she receives any money from Ireland to pay the butcher and baker  every  Monday morning she will be happy to see any  real  friend and  poor  desolate females whether widows or maidens who are too poor to be courted too old to be flatteredthey need not  dread  being  crowded  with company An amiable friend of Mr Monck Berkeley's youth frequently does the Editor the honour to say  "that he should esteem it an honour if she would spend some weeks at his seat with himself and his lovely lady"  The Editor wickedly it is wickedly as she is persuaded he is sincere laughs and says  "  Invite  on press Tommy You are very safe I assure you for I shall never visit you"  If the Editor's life should be spared until next summer and she can prevail on her sister to accompany her she means to go for one week as were it not so distant she would be happy to accept the throughly polite invitation of Mr Monck Berkeley's highly respected old Eton St Andrew's friend the very amiable very grateful for slight favours received at St Andrew's Mr Hume son of the late Lord Bishop of Sarum nephew to Lord Kinnoul Mr Berkeley always spoke in high terms of Mr Hume's worth when an Etonian The Editor rejoices to hear that he is so happily married Long may he enjoy his felicity on earth late exchange it for higher felicity  THE EDITOR TO HER CORRESPONDING FRIENDS  THE Editor having publicly declared war with one of her favourite amusements from ten years old at present her only remaining one letterwriting rather letter  scribbling  unluckily for her for her friends she  too  early in life lighted on that passage in one of Dean Swift's Letters  "that he never leaned on his elbow when writing a letter to study or think what he was to write but set down just what came into his head or occurred at the moment"  The Editor  then  thought it  very clever  so it might perhaps for such a brilliant genius as Dean Swift but not for Miss Frinsham At fifteen however the habit was  unluckily  contracted and every one who has ever redde only  once  Dr Johnson's delightful VISION of THEODORE must remember the astonishingly beautiful description of HABITS Perhaps good ones in early life are  almost  as easily contracted as bad ones at least so a learned  beathen  Philosopher tells us but  he knew not  the  doctrine  of ORIGINAL SIN although all thinking impartial Beings must  feel  it in themselves  Mrs Berkeley here takes leave to recommend to those Friends to whom she may not yet have recommended them as she knows she has to many to purchase and read  every  day two little booksBOGATSKY When recommending that excellent little volume the York edition is correct to her old neighbour Mr Bristow of Canterbury to fell he assured her  "that BOGATSKY was  all the fashion  that vast numbers of LADIES not Gentlemen bought it"  Mrs Frinsham uses wittily to say  "The reason that Men do not kneel at Church or attend to their souls out of Church is because GOD has made  them  LORDS of the Creation"  The second book is the "Hymns" not "Psalms" of the seraphic Dr Isaac Watts and read  one  Hymn every morning The Day of Bogatsky and the Hymn of Watts may both be  dispatched  in less than seven minutes Mrs Berkeley supposes that in near thirty years she has scarce missed thirty times invigorating her Faith and Love to Christ by Dr Watts and her blood boils with indignation at the caution she lately saw in the Saint James's Chronicle against a SOCINIAN edition of those divine Hymns It appears to her  impossible  that they can be garbled by those wretches where every fourth or fifth line does so exalt the  Saviour of Sinners Surely none have exceeded  few  equalled that Divine Man in incessantly in his writings holding up to view the coequal coeternal GODHEAD of the SON and SPIRIT as Dr ISAAC WATTS His sweet spirit has been long worshiping  Why is not that emblem over every altar in every country church as the Editor has seen it in some few little obscure village churches particularly in that of  West  Peckham in West Kent surrounded with a beautiful nimbus  Children babes  of sense would then ask what it was  There has long been a train laid by the Socinian and Arian  Friends  of Satan to undermine good Dr Watts There was a hint in a set of Bampton Lectures several years ago that  latterly  that pious man was not quite so strenuous c as formerly The fact is for many years his fine faculties too much used failed and villains got in and asked him ensnaring questions which he forgot before he answered It had been happy had he done as poor pious  very  weak Bishop Latimer did when examined by the PIOUS  charitable  Papists of  bloody  MARY  "I am become old and foolish I won't answer a word to any question you ask me Go and read what I printed when  I was in vigour and if you don't like it burn me for that"  And so they very kindly did shortening his then dull journey to glory  As this sheet is not written for the Publick at large but  entirely  for Mrs George Berkeley's Correspondents  ie  her kindly curious friends who want to know  "what  sort  of place she has  thrust  herself into"  she here  sine postage  thus writes Her dear friend Mrs Duncombe has  "many a long year ago"  celebrated the beauties of the environs the  exteriour  of Chertsey if she will be pleased to insert her account in the Gentleman's Magazine she will oblige her numerous friends and delight many readers of that very sensible work For the  interiour  the Editor has already described the excellent Preacher and in all times  hitherto  CHURCH has the precedency of State The Editor will follow  "  the good old way  "  The building has but one AILE so it will not probably  fly  away and she hopes the DEMOCRATES will not pluck its one aile and level it with the ground for Mrs B had rather hobble to it on the  little  On Mrs Berkeley asking Mr Whitaker how it came to pass when almost every little town in England was well paved that this had escaped being  "  in the fashion  "  he replied  "Bless me my dear Madam did  you  never hear  how it came to be  so paved"  Mrs Berkeley foolishly expecting to hear by Romans or Saxons or Danes earnestly said  "Oh no  do pray tell me  "  "Why the  tradition  is that the DEVIL paved it  himself  that people might not go to Church"  Mrs Berkeley's father used to say that it must certainly have been the Devil who built the Church at Great Marlow quite at the extremity indeed out of that very long town close to the Thames An odd circumstance occurred one Sunday almost forty years ago Mrs Berkeley on a visit there of course at Church a barge stranded just as the worthy Dr Cloberry was devoutly reading the third commandment a perplexed bargeman without the sacred walls uttered the following words distinctly heard by all the congregation  "G  d d  n your hands why  doan't  you pull that rope"  The inhabitants of Marlow then had one most excellent custom it were to be wished that it were practised in other places During Divine Service at no fixed regular time the Churchwardens attended by other proper persons take up their white wands walk out of Church and walk through the town inspect the alehouses and Mrs Berkeley conceives the Marlow Publicans do not resemble  one  at Cookham who used to shut up his  front  door and receive a vast deal of  good  company through his garden at his  back  door But his  landlord  was one of the WORTHY Cookham Brewers risen from being  humbly thankful  for a horn of fine ale when working hard at Dr Berkeley's at Bray as a Cooperto  making  ale at Cookham and together with a Dissenting Baker during the Sequestration after Dr Berkeley resigned the living of Cookham although he rented the house of his successor shewed their love of power in a very extraordinary manner indeed the Brewer sending repeated orders that Dr Berkeley's cows should not be in the churchyard the cattle have no other way to get at the Thames to drink and the Baker bringing his linen up a ladder over a wall repeatedly to dry them on the premises which he said were become his not in the dryingground appropriated for that purpose but tying his ropes to the two finest mulberrytrees in Berkshire with which Mrs Berkeley regaled all her neighbours far and near rich and poor and would as soon have suffered her maids to have dried her linen on them as to have washed it in her Dresden china but beggars set on horseback  generally  ride  briskly  Whether ABRAHAM and LEVI considered themselves  great folk  as descendants of the Father of the Faithful or as COOKHAM  Parish officers  Mrs Berkeley knows not but conceives the latter Mrs Berkeley telling the late very sensible worthy Mr Stone Carpenter of Cookham and Churchwarden that he had never sent his cloaths to dry or sent for fruit or made the Vicarage Garden a publick walk as Mr Withers the Curate appointed by the Parish did he shook his head saying  "Good Madam that paper from the Archdeacon's Court was only matter of form there was no need for us to take care of any premises that Dr Berkeley was in possession of"  Dr Berkeley and this worthy man between them had taken care of his soul he collected the Offering at the Altar on Sunday looking good man as if really dead and expired in peace the next Tuesday On being advised on Sunday not to go to church because he was dying he replied  "I know it and therefore I will go"  His health had been long in a very declining state He was a very throughly honest just man as I well know he having done all Dr Berkeley's work for many years and I of course always overlooked and paid his very reasonable remarkably just bills  round pebbles than walk  smoothly  over its  foundation as she did the last time she was in France over a Cathedral where she had some few years before worshiped GOD in  her own way  whilst a noble organ was playing the service during the celebrating not  L'OFFICE DE SAUVEUR in which she could well join To tell you that we have no organ at Chertsey would be to tell an untruth as Mrs Berkeley hears by report that the Presbyterians have so far given up the ideas of their ancestors as to suffer the  "  Devil's whistle  "  to be played constantly in their Meetinghouses in many places adopting 'tis to be feared the  Popish  doctrine of doing and  hearing  EVIL that good may come drawing thereby many from the Church of England worship However to console US in the Parish Church for the want of an organ we have a most extraordinary Clerk who no doubt conceive  that his prayers are as prevalent as those of ELIJAH THE PROPHET On my arrival here Mrs Frinsham told me that we had a very extraordinary Clerk indeed but that she was told  she would in time  get used to  his  mode of praying She expressed her wonder that it did not perplex the Officiating Clergymen She would not tell me what it was saying  "I should hear for myself"  Arriving here on the Saturday evening I of course attended Divine Service twice on Sunday as also on weekdays and the following Sunday Having been taught from early youth always to follow never precede the Clerk in the Confession Psalms and Responses I was exceedingly puzzled indeed when I came to the Litany I rubbed my eyes wiped my glasses but all in vain to find out what the poor honest Clerk said as the words WE and FOR are  so very  different in their sound and thanks be to God my ears are as quick as my poor eyes are dullvery remarkably quick always that it was not till several times after giving the utmost attention that I discovered that this good man probably conceiving that HIS prayers as Clerk being louder than the rest of the Congregation are  better  heard in Heaven he very kindly in the Litany instead of saying  "  We beseech Thee to hear us good Lord  "  says FOR I beseech Thee to hear US good Lord Most of the great Churches in town have what is called a Clerk in Orders I believe they seldom officiate themselves but generally by deputy but if they do although in Priests  Orders I fancy they do not supplicate for the Congregation as this  zealous  Clerk does There are several other curious  varieties  but this may suffice to shew how  happy  we are in a Clerk Pews are here exceedingly scarce and the good Lady who  rented  this house before I took it when she quitted the town bequeathed her  non  right in the pew in which she sat to a  little valiant Seaofficer  not now in employ He perhaps considering himself as at sea crowded himself and three cousins in with Mrs Frinsham and myself the pew is small for four persons blustered so violently and swore in Church and at length prevailed by his eloquence  or  his oaths on the  respectable  Vestry after all the gentlemen were retired to write me a very curious letter indeed it is carefully preserved by Mrs Frinsham amongst her  odd  curiosities forbidding me to sit in the seat any more  they  having given it to Captain BLUSTER and his uncle the Coaldealer who are much  too genteel  ever to go to Church in an afternoon or on weekdays I was beginning to fear we must attend Divine Service as used to do the excellent Mrs Yorke of Pirton my mother's aunt who for some years before her death being a cripple by the gout was constantly lifted in and out of her coach to take the air or make a visit but could not drive into the Church she was therefore regularly carried to Church twice every Sunday and every Saint's day Wednesdays and Fridays in her sedanchair placed in the aile and the poles drawn out not to incommode persons  passing to their pews but having at present no sedanchair it occurred to me that unless the amiable Prelate of this Diocese was wonderfully altered for the worse in a few years he would be happy to assist an old friend I accordingly wrote to him stating our hard case His Lordship honoured me with a very polite answer inclosing one to the Churchwardens of Chertsey recommending it to them to provide me with a pew which they immediately did near the little Captain's where we hear him talk but not  now  swear and curseSo much fore cclesiastical matters only remarking that the title bestowed on the Curate of Chertsey as Mr White told us is the  Journeyman  Parson I have often heard my Mother and Archdeacon Dodwell's mother say that the Clerk of Shottesbrook a master shoemaker used to roar out in the Psalm I am a  journeyman  as all my Fathers were and Mr Cherry's comment was  "Frith always struts when he hollows it out feeling his  own  superiority over David who he conceives never attained to being a  master  workman"  We never hear an oath or see or hear a drunken person man or woman in the street  Mr Whitaker told Mrs Frinsham and Mrs Berkeley that the reformation in the manners of the  lower  class of people in this place within these last eight years since Mr White was curate of the place is quite astonishing to all the neighbourhood The higher and middling ranks of  people in most places are too  wise  and too  genteel  to be  anxious  about the salvation of their immortal souls  Perhaps a few weeks spent at Dover by the great boys and girls and some of their parents might suggest to them that it would be better to walk next the kennel and  "leave the wall to elder persons"  as the very worthy Mrs Neal of the teawarehouse at Dover taught her wonderfully civil clever little girl of eight years old who shewing slipped behind to give me the wall at every turning  Enquiring the way once of a sensiblelooking little charityschool girl she said  "I will wait upon you Madam and shew it you"  She received as she merited my kind thanks We set outshe turned back to the little girls that she had quitted slipped off her pattens saying  "Pray take care of them I shall walk quicker without them and not hinder the Lady"  It was impossible for the Lady who ever delighted to pay attention to real humble merit in humble station and try to benefit the possessors to avoid rewarding her little conductress and enquiring who she was She did not reply as washerwomen's c children in these equalizing days generally do  "I am  Mrs Draggletail's  daughter"  She replied  "My name is Susan Ellendor Madam My mother is a  widow and keeps a publick house"  I think the Flying Horse This being the last time I was at Dover I have not learned but hope that the sensible civil little Susan is now a worthy servant in the family of some gentleman who has a worthy lady who takes a  little  care of the souls of her servants as I trust will all the friends to whom I address this farewell epistle  ADIEU my good Friends May we ere long meet in a country where neither Mr Pitt nor Mr Pond nor any Mr can tax  poor  letter scribblers  ELIZA BERKELEY  THE EDITOR'S APOLOGY  For the Errors of herself and the Devil ie the Printer's Devil  THE learned acute Dr Young says  "  Flaw in the bestThe many flaw all o'er  "  To which party the Editor belongs has been by this time pronounced by many perhaps as in most other cases where sentence is pronounced without seeing the  whole  of the evidence the judgement  may  be wrong She conceives as in most other things fortune station c c she is in the  middle  way That she  appears  sometimes to have written  superlative  nonsense is most certain for which she is  not  famous  "But this sentence is absolute nonsense"  says a Reader  "  no one can  make  head or tail of it  "  Agreed good Reader yet the Editor  did not write  it nonsense but her once good hand now when writing in haste degenerated into a very small scrawl must have often puzzled even the  poor  Devil or the Compositor A witty clerk of an uncle of hers a very eminent Barrister used to say  "My master writes  three  hands one that  I  can't read one that he can't read  himself  and one that the  Devil  can't read"  The Editor from an ugly trick contracted in very early youth always speaks in a very low voice what she is writing and although her pen moves very quick yet the little  redrag  "the unruly member"  moves  still  quicker by which means she frequently leaves out three or four words in a sentence which she is obliged to interline She never whilst writing tittles the third vowel crosses her  t  or makes any stop but at the beginning of a new paragraph All this is left  to be done  after the letter c is finished and like most other things postponed is frequently  not done at all  which to those unacquainted with her horridly heedless manner of writing makes her letters  very  valuable Etruscan MSS  The Editor thinks she may now proceed without being guilty of  injustice  to  accuse  the Devil Whenever the Editor has had occasion to use the word  perpetually  the  Devil  knows or perhaps  does not  know why the word as lately in an article in the Gentleman's Magazine  See the Tale of Woe in the Magazine for August  is constantly printed PERSONALLY which makes it in some instances  very extraordinary  nonsense indeed  In some places the note is introduced into the text and the poor text  cast down  into the note as it is at the bottom of p cccc where the last three lines are superfluous but were intended to have accompanied the little anecdote of poor unhappy Lady Vane in p ccccvii  Mentioning a very beautiful little painting of Cheltenham Church taken from the Well by Miss Hamilton  One of the elegant throughly amiable daughters of Lord Archibald Hamilton during the Editor's melancholy  séjour  at Cheltenham during the last direful illness of her son and the tremendously alarming illness of dear Dr Berkeley at Cheltenham These angelichearted young ladies insisted on regularly escorting the Editor from the Spa to her own door every morning as she regularly drank the water and would do it every year for two months in autumn if she could afford the journey The Editor has above mentioned  her objection  to taking a footman to attend her in a morning She has for some years been receiving severe reprimands from her  dear  TRIO Father Son and Sister for DARING to walk except in her garden alone lest she should half more than half blind run her simple  head  against a horse's  tail  as she once did The Poor Editor used to plead  "that she never was  so  watched in youth by her mother why  submit  to it in her old age by her son Yet so it kindly was still kindly is To be followed by her very worthy careful servant in  London  she has no objection  but  to see a female followed by a footman at  Chertsey  would make it supposed an OATLANDS lady was in town"  at the request of the Editor and which hangs constantly within ken of her  short  sightedeye to soothe her wounded heart of a size answering to the frontispiece  designed  by her dear Son and engraved for his beautiful Elegy on the death of Miss M  the  poor  Devil has turned the word  beautiful  into a  handsome  drawing which raises the idea of vulgarity in her mindperhaps as a Berkeshire woman having in early youth heard the lower people of that beautiful county ridiculed for frequently saying  "A  handsomebodied man  or woman as you shall see Sir"  The Editor fears that most of the errors of the press must go uncorrected as although thanks to the mercy of God she has still eyesight sufficient to scrawl by daylight and read a sensible clever book by candlelight she cannot  six  her eye by  any  light to count lines and find out in  which  the error lies without injuring her eyes very much The casting up her  now  very small weekly book of accompts strains her eyes more than reading or writing five hours  de suite  when she has not occasion to fix them  The Editor has been from very early youth by her nearest her dearest surviving friend told  "That she is of a temper  too  sanguinethat she  never  ceases to hope in despite of disappointment repeated and  rerepeated  "  The Editor has ever found it pleasanter than to go quietly into the Castle of GIANT DESPAIR vide Pilgrim's Progress the delight of her very early childhoodthe new edition of which with the excellent notes by the very pious and surely very liberalminded Mr Burder Dissenting Minister at Coventry improves and gladens her declining years if the Editor was rich she would dispense as many of an incomparable little work of his intituled "THE GOOD OLD WAY" as the ZEALOUS Democrats did of Tom Paine's  Rights  of Man As it is although that incomparable little tract is sold as low as  one  penny she half beggars herself in distributing them having generally some in her pocket for  rich and poor who will accept them  As also Sir Richard

To say nothing of the Society's Books at Messrs Rivingtons St Paul's Churchyard The Friendly Call to the Holy Communion by the late excellent Peter Dobree Esquire It is pity that the name of that devout Christian is not now printed in the titlepage it would save the Editor much trouble in writing it there  Reading that  wonderful little  volume she is ready to retract having so often joined that witty Monarch Charles the Second saying that  "Presbyteranism was not the Religion of a GENTLEMAN"  in Mr Burder it appears the Religion of a most liberalminded manBut to return to that cheering temper of the mind HOPE The Editor has really so very often  hoped  that every page of  very  many would be the last of her  LONG Preface that she is almost led to DESPAIR Gratitude for amiable attention she knows not how to avoid celebrating as perhaps few persons feel more sensibly more gratefully amiable unmerited attentions paid to herself and those she tenderly loved  THE Editor wonders at herself that in mentioning the great amiability of the  noblesse  of Scotland she could have omitted to notice the very pleasing politeness of Lord Glasgow to Mr Monck Berkeley during his  séjour  at St Andrew's  As the family were sitting at tea  en famille  in Mrs Berkeley's dressingroom the door opened and the servant Mr Wrightson announced Mr Bower to Mr Berkeley Mr Berkeley sprang up saying  "My dear good fellow I am very glad to see you with all my heart What can have brought you hither"  Mr Bower  "I came Sir to pay my duty to my Father"  Mr Berkeley  "Who is your Father"  Mr Bower  "He tells me Sir that he has the honour to be known to Dr Berkeley and to you Sir"  Mr Berkeley  "What not Patrick Bower"  Mr Bower  "The same Sir I should not have taken the liberty to have waited on you Sir but that my Lord  Glasgow hearing that you were at the University here charged me to wait upon you with his best compliments and to tell you that he hopes you will visit him next vacation at  "  The Editor must add here that Mr Bower the bookseller of St Andrew's was a very worthy man and as she used frequently to say as civil as an English tradesman a very rare thing in Scotland where the traders are in general the most uncourtly she believes of any under the canopy of Heaven the Dutch  The late Mrs Donalon of Chelsea an old friend once a FLAME of Bishop Berkeley's being in Holland and going into a shop to purchase some holland it not being just what she wanted she went out of the shop Walking along the streets she received a most  violent  blow on her back which but for a good pair of stays must have injured her Turning round she saw the Mistress of the shop looking like a Fury who said  "  this is to teach you not to give people the trouble to undo their goods and then not buy them  "  adding some opprobrious Dutch name The Editor often wonders at the  patient  civility of London Traders with her  tiresome idle  Countrywomen who are morning shopstrollers She always herself requests traders  not  to shew her their newfashioned wares as she whether she wants them or not knows that she  cannot  therefore  will not  afford to buy them  always excepted The French and Flemings are in general rude the English are certainly the civilest the most  patient  of men Every one has heard the wager laid to try if it were possible to wear out the patience of Mr Mann the great woollendraper  Mr Kaye the Dean of Guild of St Andrew's answering to our Mayors in England who had visited England was a most liberal obliging and even polite trader Mr Monck Berkeley always made it a point with his English friends to deal with Mr Kaye the great woollen and linen draper at St Andrew's As a proof of his elegance whenever the Editor bought a chequed apron for any poor old Scotch woman value half a crown or three shillings Mr Kaye would constantly on her laying the money on the counter present her with some white sewingsilk in a paper saying  "Madam be pleased to take your discount"  Oh wife Scottish Traders to give it  "I will not trouble you with halfpence ie BAWBEES"    brother to the Ambassador at Florence some years ago The Editor one day in the shop of an old huckster at St Andrew's she is sorry to say that he was an  Episcopal  of the name of Noarey a young gentleman of very remarkable gentle sweet manners as before remarked the young Laird of Logie Almon entered the shop Seeing the old wretch engaged in serving either the Editor or her Sister he politely forbore to ask for the article he wanted The old wretch thus addressed him his hat cocked like a Kevenhuller bolt upright in a parallel line with his surly shoulders  "Well young man why do you stand there What is that you  wants  Why doan't you tell instead of standing there"  The Editor  instantly  replied  "I don't know what Logie Almon wants as his politeness to the Ladies in your shop prevents his telling whilst you are serving them but I can tell you what you want and if this young gentleman and you were at Eton what you would get as you richly deserveyour  fierce  hat thrown into the fire and your saucy self well rolled in  the kennel"  The old Hottentot  growled  and Mrs Frinsham and the young Laird laughed very much  The Editor whilst in Scotland used frequently to afford great diversion to dear Dr Berkeley her Sister and Son The latter used to divert their friends in England with his Mother's  labours and troubles  about spinning and weaving tablecloths napkins c saying  "  My Mother  really turned herself into a very gewd  Scotch weef  counting her spinning when come home measuring marking for bleaching just as if she had been  booarn a Scot  "  Mrs Berkeley going one day to purchase some fine Dutch flax the man was wonderfully surly and saucy Mrs Frinsham said  "You are the rudest being I ever saw in my life Were I the Lady I would go without flax till the  resurrection  sooner than purchase it of such a  wretch  as you are"  He replied his hat cocked and his arms akimbo  "Why now there is nothing in the world that I  likes  so much as affronting a woman I always did and if she is a  Laady  The Editor one day purchasing something in the shop of two brothers at St Andrew's of the name of Millar  David  the eldest an absolute savage  Tom  the younger a very civilized man Mrs Berkeley ever from a child delighting to say obliging things when it could be done as it  very often may  without  any  flattery said  "Tom you are as civil as an English Trader  you  would  do  in England"  The Editor believes he had desired her not to trouble herself to put her parcel into her pocket for that he would send it to her house An elderly woman in the shop waiting to be served exclaimed  "  Good Leard  I never saw any thing like  Lady Berkeley  in my life"  Dr Berkeley by the lower people of St Andrew's was from his short cassock which in both kingdoms he in undress constantly wore esteemed a Bishop and Mrs Berkeley by that rank in St Andrew's who had never heard the address of  vile Queen Bess  to Bishop's wife constantly styled  Lady Berkeley  In her own country when thanked by a starving poor creature for an apron or gown she ever disclaimed the title of  Ladyship  adding if people have NO sense she  will put some into them  The Editor who had not before observed the  gewd weef  replied  "My good friend it has been frequently said in England that if persons had but  one  spark of understanding Mrs Berkeley would  strike it out  for them BUT it was reserved for Scotland to compliment her  endeavours  to do what GOD ALONE  can do bestow  understanding"  The fact was this woman a dealer in tea and  other little  smuggled matters had a very  uncommonly strong  understanding which Mrs Berkeley on learning her name sound that she had instructed her to use to be sure the best tools are useless to the cleverest Artist unacquainted with the mode of using them  I likes it ten times the better"  Mrs Frinsham said  "You are a brute then"  and walked out into the street saying  "My dear Sister come away"  Mrs Berkeley however stayed and purchased her flax as it was the best in the city He had a lad about fourteen the civilest gentle creature one could see his name forgotten He lived in North Street and was a true disciple of the brutal John Knox  The Editor does not recollect the name of Lord Glasgow's very beautiful seat  Kelburn she believes or Rowallan  although Lord  Balgonie  lent her  a charming Elegy in MS written by Mr Bower  Mr Bower was private tutor at Eton to Lord Glasgow The wise lady his mother took a house at Slough to be near her son The Editor conjured Dr Berkeley when his Son went to Eton at least very soon after to leave Canterbury and go and reside at Cookham that both parents might in their different departments superintend the education of their then only child But alas she could not prevail  on seeing the monument in the great wood of  of the late Lord Glasgow his noble pupil's excellent father as it should seem by the character given  Mr Bower the bookseller presented the Editor with his son's Elegy on the death of sweet Lady Helen Boyle aged fourteen The beautiful little red print of that lovely creature Mrs Berkeley has put into a frame and it now hangs in her dressingroom but in frequent removals she has lost the pleasing Elegy or perhaps has lent it and it has never been returned a too common case with the Editor  Mr Bower on taking leave again repeated  "His Lordship charged me to say how happy you would make him if you would visit  "  Mr Berkeley replied  "His Lordship does me much honour I certainly will not be in that part of Scotland without doing myself the honour to pay my respects to his Lordship"  When Mr Bower was gone Mrs Berkeley said to her Son  "Why Berkeley I did not know that Lord Glasgow and you were such great friends at Eton I never heard of his Lordship as one of your CON  An Eton phrase  "  Mr Berkeley  "Nor was he my dear Madam"  Mrs Berkeley  "Why Mr Bower pressed you so repeatedly from Lord Glasgow as he said to go to visit his Lordship as was wonderful to me"  Mr Berkeley  "Why my dear Mother my Lord and I were always very good friends Soon after he came to Eton it fell to  my  lot to give his Lordship a sound drubbing and I believe his Lordship felt himself obliged to me for it and we were ever after very good although not particularly intimate friends I believe his Lordship's good sense led him to feel himself obliged to me for the  said drubbing  And Bower is the only Scotch tutor I ever remember to have been loved or  respected  in my time at Eton they were in general strange animals Good God what a wretch the poor Fitzroys had for a tutor He had nearly killed one of them but that the boys forced into the house and interposed"  Mr Berkeley was intimate with one of the Mr Fitzroys the Editor does not recollect which of the gentlemen Poor amiable Mr Bower not long after this was unfortunately drowned bathing in the sea at Scarborough  The election of the Sixteen Peers coming on during Mr Monck Berkeley's residence at St Andrew's Dr Berkeley kindly permitted him to go to Edinburgh Going one day into Holyrood House a Scotch Peer  The Editor thinks but is not absolutely certain that it was the present Earl of Morton who she has frequently heard her Son say was a very amiable man She is very certain that it was NOT the son of her old friend in early youth the very sensible worthy Countess of L    educated at Eton met him and instantly exclaimed  "BERKELEY  what can have brought you hither  "  Mr Berkeley  "I hope to see your Lordship elected one of the Sixteen"  Lord Morton  "Aye my good Friend that remains to be provedI doubt not"  Mr B  "I hope YES my Lord will  one  vote be of any service to your Lordship"  Lord M  "To be sure it will"  Mr B  "Well then I promise your Lordship I can help you to one"  Lord M  "You help me to one my dear Berkeley how is that possible"  Mr B  "Stay till you see my Lord whether I am a man of my word"  Away flew Mr Berkeley with his wonted alacrity to serve a friend or a strange or even a foe if he thought them worthy and returned escorting his tenderly beloved his sincerely respected friend the late amiable Lord Loudon whose delight in Mr Berkeley's sweet society considering the disparity of their years was wonderful  Some of Mr Berkeley's friends in Edinburgh used laughingly to tell him  "that although  he  might never be a Peer  himself  his  Son  if he had one might for that certainly if he like the great Earl of Cork would wait ten years he must infallibly marry Lady Flora Campbell the present Countess of Loudon"  The sweet Countess of Loudon then about five years old would nestle and crowd On being asked  "What she wanted"  she used to reply  "Why to sit on Mr  Berkeley's knee if he can take me up or else to stand by him"  Her Ladyship was not singular all children quite strangers constantly made up to Mr Berkeley his father and his grandmother Mrs Frinsham and little ones in arms the Editor has frequently seen struggle and even cry to go to Dr Berkeley and to her Mother But one child in the world ever paid the Editor that compliment excepting her own babes Mrs Berkeley does not love little children She should esteem her  nature  more if she did She  pities  the poor little pewling disagreeable animals A kitten can divert one but the  untaught  offspring of the Lord of the creation cannot So much for the DIGNITY of FALLEN Human Nature  An odd accident happened not long after Mr Monck Berkeley's return to England The very amiable Mr Gipps MP for Canterbury ever ready to oblige and serve his friends permitted Mr Monck Berkeley to have his letters from his Scottish friends addressed under cover to him  One day when the Editor was dressing for dinner she heard a visitingrap with the utmost  sangfroide  very certain that Mr Wrightson would not let any one into her apartment  in the morning  Presently open flew the dressingroom door and in flew Mrs Gipps out of breath saying  "I beg your pardon for  forcing  my way in to you but I hear  that Mr Berkeley with whom is  my  business is gone to dinner in the country so I must entreat you to make my apology to him When I went up to dress I saw a letter lie on my table the seal upwards Never minding that it was a coronet I  scratched  it open The folding of it hid the words 'My dear friend' and 'Edinburgh' and the date I began and redde about half way down the first side When I came to these words 'I am most happy that I have it in my power to gratify myself by immediately complying with your request and I can with truth say that were all my Chaplainships now vacant my dear friend Mr Berkeley"    "Here"  added my very sensible very obliging neighbour  "I stood aghast turned the letter and saw on the back 'To GeorgeMonck Berkeley Esquire' I was ready to faint at what Mr Berkeley  must  think of me"  The Editor here answered for her Son that the only sensation it would occasion to him would be that it had caused a moment's distress to Mrs Gipps who proceeded to assure Mrs Berkeley  "that she had not redde a tittle after she came to the name Berkeley"  of which Mrs Berkeley was fully convinced Whilst Mrs Gipps was accusing herself of being a great fool which no one else could ever do she being blessed with an exceeding strong understanding which descends to her two fine little boys blessed the Editor believes with the best motherinlaw in the three kingdoms Mrs  Berkeley prevailed on her good neighbour to stay and pin on her gown which having begun to undress was literally only fastened by one pin such was her haste to exculpate herself from what very few would have suspected her of It afforded a pleasant laugh at the next Canterbury rout  The distressing letter was locked up unredde until Mr Monck Berkeley's return at night when he proceeded to readafter  "were all my chaplainships now vacantmy dear friend Mr Berkeley should fill them every one as he pleased"  There followed some polite obliging encomiums on Mr Monck Berkeley's worth wisdom and good judgement The very elegant young gentleman mentioned in the Note on the Poem on SINGLETON ABBEY the very worthy and Reverend H  R  was just then gone into orders and wishing for that elegant ornament to the clerical habit a SCARF and not choosing to wear it as many SPRIGS  Boys of twentytwo and a half are  generally  by the Editor styled SPRIGS She has no dislike to any other Sprigs  tout au contraire  she is persuaded that she should not have remembered so accurately as she now does the face figure and dress of her Aunt Mrs Cherry who died many months before the Editor attained her  fourth  year but that one day in the garden at Mr Frinsham's the Editor not  daring  to touch them herself requested her Aunt to gather her a  le if  from one of the orangetrees Mrs Cherry amiably took out her knife cut off a good large sprig with an orange as large as a small wallnut and several blossoms on it then took a caukingpin out of her pincushion and pinned it on her frock on the left side The Editor still feels the pleasure her poor little simple heart felt no elegant finery since has  so  delighted it as when the  orangespring  was placed near it It is surely wise to gratify children who must  unavoidably be  so  often  if  wisely  educated contradicted in any  little innocent gratification  The Editor recollects with pleasure the extacy of joy she once occasioned her beloved son to experience during what she always calls the  rabbiting  age with boys Happily girls have it not but there is a time when ALL the boys she has ever known are  rabbitwild wild  with nursing and rearing rabbits for the cats to eat as so  nursed  their flesh is  too strong  for a beggar to eat Mr Monck Berkeley flew into the room saying  "Oh my dear Madam if you  will not give  or  lend me  THREE shillings I shall break my heart Here is a man has brought me  the finest  buckrabbit that  ever was seen  but he  will not  let me have it under a  crown  and I have  but two shillings  in the worldWhat can I do"  His mother thought  a crown  a vast sum to be paid for a  rabbit  The poor child's eyes filled with tears he said  "  Then I must give it up I shall never have  SUCH  another  OFFER  as long as I live  "  The purse was taken the money given and the fine rabbit carried in triumph to the Seraglio After some weeks he died and wonderful to relate the creature in its fur weighed nine pounds and a halfThe Editor laments that she has not now even a single myrtle or a geranium to nurse when she is disposed to idle a little by way of relaxation when her eyes are enflamed with reading and writing She has often expressed her astonishment to her beloved Partner and others that so WISE so SUPER  excellent  in almost every thing as surely is the Church of England should admit foxhunting c c boys into the Ministry at that early age when they read in the Sacred Scriptures that the Saviour of the World GOD incarnate entered not on his Ministry until thirty years of age nor his precursor John Baptist until he was nearly twentyeight to make a poor shatterbrained idle boy swear that  "he will devote himself wholly to the winning of souls c that he will be instant in season and out of season c"  of Divinity do unauthorized  either by NobleMan or those Noble Bodies the two Universities Mr Berkeley had with his wonted amiability without mentioning it to his friend Mr H  R  written to his noble friend Lord Loudon requesting his  Lordship to appoint him one of  his  chaplains which he instantly did Mr Berkeley always after the  melancholy  death of Lord Loudon wore a locket of his hair a  melancholy  picture set in gold pendant from his neck by a strong black ribbon under his outward waistcoat until within a very few days of his own happy exit when too weak to sit up except on a sopha  Mr Monck Berkeley one day on his arrival at Cookham from Oxford sitting after dinner Dr Berkeley asked  "What company he had in the machine to Maidenhead"  He replied  "Very sensible agreeable company"  Dr B  "Probably some gentlemen of your own acquaintance"  Mr B  "No not one but I had a very pleasant drive"  At length after a short silence Mr Berkeley said  "Well if ever I marry and should have a daughter I think I will have her baptized ELIZA LAWRENCE"  Dr B  "Eliza LAWRENCE what do you mean child are you going to sleep after your  long  journey"  Mr B  "No my dear Sir no but I can't help supposing that there must be some  spell  in the thirteen letters which compose those two names united You know my Mother and we all admire Miss Eliza Lawrence of Canterbury By some accident Ritchie forgot to take my place and so I was obliged to come in the Worcester machine in which I met a Miss Eliza Lawrence daughter of a Worcestershire  Or Shropshire the Editor forgets which  clergyman I really think one of the cleverest most sensible women I ever met with in my life I began talking like a  fool  as young folks often do She took me in hand and shewed me  what  a FOOL I was I never was  better  trimmed even by my Mother therefore I think there must me something powerful in  those  names and if I had a girl  I should like  that she should be blessed with a  fine strong  understanding  I assure you  my dear Sir"  THE Editor having at length finished her  too  long Preface it only remained for her to determine whether it should be  Pre  or  Affixed  to her Son's Poems She much wished it might be the latter Just at the time when she was to have determined the matter it pleased the ALLWISE DISPOSER of ALL events in his wisdom to  recal  to himself one of the sweetest spirits ever breathed into the nostrils  See the second chapter of Genesis verse In this alone does the Editor humbly conceive that man differs from the more much more than  "the halfreasoning elephant"  the astonishingly wise wellreasoning Newfoundland dog Mr Monck Berkeley had one who understood and acted as wisely as any Philosopher could have done as several servants of Dr Berkeley's now living well know particularly in two very remarkably striking occurrences Lord Monboddo has proved in his second volume of  Antient Metaphysics  "that dogs can remember can reason can reflect but that they have not consciousness"  ie they have a soul as well as Man sometimes a wiser soul but they have not a spark breathed into Man the BREATH of JEHOVAH  "Let us make Man"  c See Genesis chap ii verse Whoever gives themselves the trouble to read that verse in the Hebrew will more plainly see that no human being can enjoy perfect happiness until reunited to JEHOVAH  of any descendant of  fallen  ADAMMrs Frinsham the  only  the  excellent  the  generous  the INCOMPARABLE Sister of the Editor whose character may be drawn in very few words by comparing her with two great men  of the last century She had as much reserve  That reserve wore off near twenty years ago  and wit  When going from home to make a visit of a few weeks to relations or friends on making her courtsey to her Mother and Sister she used to say to her Mother  "Your most obedient Madam"  to her Sister  "Adieu my dear Miss Frinsham I hope you will both be very happy whilst I am gone but I am sure you will  never laugh  till I come home again"  It was very true she had a neverfailing fund of wonderfully agreeable humour amongst her  intimate  friends Mrs Frinsham and her Sister made it a point after they quitted school never to leave their excellent Mother one night alone  as BUTLER as much worth piety and politeness as BOYLE  A short sketch of the character of Mrs Frinsham appeared in the Obituary of the Gentleman's Magazine for January drawn by the elegant pen of her's and the Editor's beloved respected accomplished Friend Mrs Duncombe of Canterbury of whom frequent grateful mention has been made before in this Preface For this last favour the Editor feels herself most sensibly obliged gratified and consoled  Her exceedingly naturally tender delicate frame stricken by the late  intense  cold which fixed on her lungs after about a fortnight of extreme  external  suffering yet not uttering one impatient word or breathing one impatient groan resigned her sweet spirit into the hands of that God who she happily felt had  lived  had  died  to redeem it from neverending misery  utterly  renouncing all merits of her own and as has been better expressed by the very pious Divine who attended her sickdying bed and preached her  funeral sermon  Not preached to celebrate the uncommon virtues of the dear departed saint but to benefit the survivorsthe grand and greatgrandchildren of the tenants of her eminently pious ancestors and the descendants of the domestics  Some few years ago there were fix or seven worthy persons who kept their own carriages whose fathers grandfathers or grandmothers had been servants some menial servants to Mr Cherry at Shottesbrook House enabled to do so by GOD's blessing on their own honesty and worth which they still attributed to the great care taken by Mr Cherry his excellentlypious mother and his lady to the souls of their domestics many of them the children and grandchildren of faithful old servants Some years ago at a wateringplace a gentleman asked the Editor  "who an elderly man was that he saw walking sometimes with Dr Berkeley and herself"  adding  "Sure Madam he has known all your family for generationsWhat exceeding fine horses he has to his elegant carriage Yet he does not seem to be a man of  much  fashion"  To which the Editor replied  "That he was a very old acquaintance of her's a man of worth"  It was not  necessary  for her to add that his father had taken very good care of Mr Cherry's fine horse at Shottesbrook although it was the case  of her excellently less  celebrated  pious parents The Editor rejoices to hear that the place of her nativity is at present blessed with an  Evangelical  as well as very learned Preacher although a young gentleman a very old fashioned pastor taking the advice of  poor old  SAINT PAUL  "be instant in season"  c Epistle to Timothy as an honest tenant of hers who left her house this morning tells her saying  "I believe Madam that there is scarce a day when the gentleman is not in two or three houses instructing the  poor  people and relieving them where it is wanted"  When he marries the Editor hopes his lady will be as indeed every lady whether wife to a Doctor or a 'Squire should be mother nurse to the surrounding poor They will  one  day find it to have been not only a pleasant but a  profitable  amusement  at Shottesbrooke  This Sermon preached by the Rev Mr White Curate of Chertsey will be soon published This excellent judicious Evangelical Preacher has printed two or three Sermons on different occasions but never published them The Editor asking why he had not Mr White modestly replied  "that as he was  only a Curate  he thought no one would attend to them"  To be sure he bears in mind that  "A Saint in crape is  twice  a Saint in lawn"  But let us hope that there are  some  FEW Saints not clad in LAWN who yet in due time may be  "  clothed in white robes with palms  if not  croziers    in their hands c  "  utterly refusing to  hear her  "  almsdeeds and good works  "  of which to use the language of Saint Luke in the Acts of the Holy Apostles  "  she was full  "  very full indeed  even mentioned to her exclaiming  "Oh name them not I have not had it in my power to do aught for MY SAVIOUR HE has done ALL for me"  She breathed out her last gentle breath in praise to God her Saviour The last words that she uttered to be  distinctly  heard were  "Oh my SAVIOURGOD into THY HANDS do  I  commend MY SPIRIT  It is supposed that she finished the text for she lived about ten minutes and continued speaking with her last breath which by the gesture of her exquisitely elegant hands  Mrs Frinsham was so elegantly limbed that the very witty very polite agreeable Mrs M  c  e of Canterbury once said  "My dear Miss Frinsham if Nature had formed me as she has you I would certainly wear small cloaths and never put on a glove"  Mrs Frinsham danced a minuet so very finely that if on a public day at Mrs  More than thirty years ago it afforded heartfelt pleasure to the Editor to have it in her power to render a very capital service to the most sensible accomplished youngest son of that lovely amiable judicious educator of young ladies then in India It has been often asserted that NO young lady brought up by Mrs Sheeles and the pious sensible Mrs Gambier ever lost their character excepting a wretched little girl who long before she attained the age of fourteen was one Christmas holydays after she had been about a year in Queen's Square SOLD by her vile Guardian to a vile  shire 'Squire whose mother illusing the poor VERY  weak  girl contemporary with the Editor she ran away from him The poor creature as many others have done experienced the truth of the wise Spanish Proverb  "bien et casada que tien ni Sugero ni Canada"  Mrs Sheeles sadly lamented to Mrs Berkeley about thirty years ago that she suffered herself to be persuaded by Lady  to take her daughters No two Earls daughters in England have exceeded these two  ladies in a variety of  matches Mrs Sheeles was a most accomplished woman of very good family granddaughter of the excellent Sir John Smith cousingerman to the late  Lord Montford It always rejoices Mrs Berkeley to hear of the happiness and prosperity of her grandchildren  Sheeles's twenty different sets of company came Mrs then Miss Anne Frinsham was certain to exhibit to every different company Her ear for music was so exquisitely accurate that the Editor has frequently in her youth and a very little before her lamented death heard her say that when at school always in mischief like and perpetually with her dearly beloved friend the wonderfully sensible highly cultivated accomplished Mrs A Langley of the Manorhouse York she has repeatedly  tried  to dance out of time but never could do it more than two steps the third was not in her power It used to be said by the governesses teachers c  "The eldest Miss Frinsham looks as if she would fly over the moon the youngest as if butter would not melt in her mouth yet Miss Frinsham is never in mischief Miss Anne never out of it"  It was innocent mischief although it subjected the two Miss Annes frequently to have recourse to their Common Prayer Book to learn a Psalm sometimes to their Bible to learn a chapter by heart esteemed a pretty weighty although not a disgraceful punishment like the Fool'scap or the Redtongue Schools well conducted are excellent places for children of both sexes surely Mrs Frinsham used through life to laugh and tell Dr and Mr Monck Berkeley when the Editor used to say  "that  as a girl she  found no pleasure in  their escampades  to the parlour door at night"  c  "Aye she was a  poor pusillanimous stupid little puss  She would never get up after she was in bed never slip out of the schoolroom She never saw the kitchen at Mrs Sheeles's in her life She was a sad poor coward indeed"  and the appearance of her eyes seemed to  be  praising  rather than supplicating that SaviourGod whom she had laboured so faithfully to serve for very many years  Although her outward sufferings were very heavy all was bright within No selfreproach for  broken  SABBATHS for neglect of public worship on WEEK DAYS one grand cause of the decay of Christian piety in this Nation which the Editor doomed alas to attend dying beds has twice witnessed to her great distress not blessed be God either  her Mother Son or Husband Her sole anxiety was on account of her poor now alas throughly forlorn desolate  trebly  widowed Sister left to struggle alone with variety of perplexing businesses without one near dear relative to counsel and to soothe her yet blessed be the mercy of an allgracious God she was enabled to say to her almost idolizing Sister  "Dearest of friends I am not ALONE for God is with me  will  be with me I have been constantly as you know praying to him from the age of seventeen '  Cast me not away in the time of age when my strength faileth when I am greyheaded  ' And he has graciously promised ALL his  real  children '  I  will NEVER leave thee nor  forsake  thee' And I may adapt the language of Holy David and instead of saying 'When my Father and my Mother forsake me the LORD taketh me up' But when it pleases HIS wisdom to chastize his poor sinful child by taking from her her idolized Son her tenderly beloved Husband her darling Sister HE  will  take her up and conduct her safely she wishes she might presume to say shortly to the realms of bliss there to rejoin those lovely spirits her dear happy TRIO to part no more"  The lovely Saint was  exceedingly  consoled to find that the Giver of every good gift had in the midst of  such anguish  of soul vouchsafed such a measure of his  best gift  FAITH Mrs Frinsham entreated her Sister to  remember what Mrs Berkeley always admired in Brooke's Fool of Quality that  "GRIEF hath not a more  deadly  FOE than  business  that she alas had much to which she entreated her to apply herself instead of mourning over her loss"  We all in turn feel that it is easier to preach than to practise and the Editor feels the force of Our Blessed Master's words  "Work whilst you have the day for the night cometh wherein no man can work"  The Editor has laboured to work a little in the day the time of youth of vigour for the night is come rather early upon her when she finds by melancholy experience that she can do but  very  littleMay that little all redound to the glory of GOD  her  SAVIOUR  Amen  Lord JESUS say AMEN  The Editor has several stone weight of papers to inspect of Bishop Berkeley'shis journal when in Italy c c of Mr Cherry's of Archbishop Secker's Miss Talbot's Mr Monck Berkeley's and dear Dr Berkeley wished her at her leisure to overlook and select from his numerous sermons enough to make a dozen volumes one volume to be published about six sermons Dr Berkeley got transcribed during his last illness to be printed which together with his four sermons printed during his life will nearly make the volume  The Editor feels some consolation in knowing that from very early youth one of her chief studies and greatest delights was labouring to oblige please and render happy her ever from  infancy  tenderly beloved sister and that the sisters never through life had a quarrel with each other since the age when if there arose any dispute whose DOLL was  best  dressed their wise mother used to call out  "Oh if there is any quarrel  I  am coming to make a  third  "  which always  instantly  ended the dispute  The Editor is perpetually since her  last  lamentable loss involuntarily recurring to those beautiful lines of the eloquent Dr Young in his first Night  DEATH great proprietor of all  * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * *  * * * * * * * * * * *  Amid such mighty plunder why exhaust  Thy  partial  quiver on a mark so  mean  Why thy  peculiar  rancour wreck'd on  me  Insatiate Archer could not

"Reformed Devotions" the Preparatory Office for Death used by the Editor from her youth up on the THURSDAY instead of the Office for that day with which she now concludes this frightfully long Preface    "Yet at the  last  GREAT DAY we shall  easily  discern a  perfect concord  in the  harshest  note when out  adored  REDEEMER shall come in the clouds and summon ALL mankind to appear before HIM"  To which the Editor ever has trusts she ever shall most sincerely subscribe  ELIZA BERKELEY  CHERTSEY  January fatal Month  POEMS  RUMORA OR THE MAID OF RAASA  RAASA by thy rocky shore  Vocal to the Ocean's roar  Cliffs that have for ages stood  Barriers to the briny Flood  Beneath your dark your dismal shade  Wandering wept a woeworn Maid  Whilst the pauses of the gale  Each she fill'd with sorrow's tale  Bursting from the sable sky  See the forked Lightnings fly  Whilst their sad destructive light  Gilds awhile the gloom of Night  Trembling to the blasts that blow  Gazing on the gulph below  Yielding to the ruthless storm  Drooping mark yon Angel Form  Round whose face divinely fair  Loosely streams her golden hair  To the rock's sublimest seat  Fate has led her wandering feet  Yawning wide the greedy Deep  Woos her to eternal sleep  By the Lightning's vivid glare  Saw you not yon frantic stare  By the Tempest's lurid light  Mark her plunge to endless Night  Struggling mid the boiling wave  Nature frighted at the Grave  To the rude the rocky strand  Faintly points her languid hand  Cease ye blasts awhile to blow  Drown not now the wail of woe  Heard ye not yon piercing groan  That proclaim'd her spirit flown  Whilst it soars on seraph wing  Roaring waves her Requiem sing  Still by Raasa's seagirt shore  Blueey'd Maids her fate deplore  From the cliffs sublime and

spring  Whilst Hope fair daughter of the sky  With golden tress and azure eye  Benignant turn'd her gladd'ning lyre  And bade my soul to bliss aspire  But now no more along these plains  She pours her sweet seraphic strains  No more Almeria wanders near  In vain alas I seek her here  Yet as by fond remembrance led  My fav'rite scenes I pensive tread  There peaceful shades yon conscious grove

to mourn  Alike thy draft Lethean drowns  The pride of kings the care of clowns  Now Death has chill'd the fever'd mind  Of him the scourge of humankind  Who his insatiate fame to feed  Bade all

eyes that mock the diamond's blaze  Unheeded now o'er Edward's grave  Fam'd Cressy's living laurels wave  Unconscious of the foliage proud  The warrior slumbers in his shroud  Yet thou who thus of human pride  Stem'st the deep o'erflowing tide  Who o'er ambition's blazon'd tale  Indignant throw'st thy sable veil  Dost still in mercy soothe the woe  That bids through life the tear to flow  Whom mis'ry urges to his tomb  Obtain from thee a welcome doom  At ease reclin'd within thy arms  And deaf to faction's loud alarms  See murder'd Mary calmly sleeps  And blissful change no longer weeps  Embosom'd in some unknown tomb  Forgetful of his impious doom  Sleeps the sad prince whose hapless fate  Through time's long course shall want its mate  E'en Love that tyrant of the breast  At thy

Convent's walls  Reluctant I must own 'tis Nature's voice  That calls Miranda to so sad a choice  For oft at eve I 've seen the pensive maid  Reclin'd beneath the yewtree's mournful shade  Hanging enraptur'd o'er some moving tale  Whilst pleas'd she heard the plaintive warbler's wail  If then Miranda you the Veil assume  If you will seek the Convent's mournful gloom  And the sad tale no abler Bard inspire  Be mine the task to tune the plaintive lyre  If verse like mine eternal fame could give  Thy name Miranda should for ever live  EPITAPH ON G R BERKELEY ESQ  TO MRS GEORGE BERKELEY HIS

beneath this humble harmless stone  Sleeps one to human frailty often prone  Yet Pity's self shall draw a friendly veil  O'er all the guilt that clouds her hapless tale  As vernal air then breathing pure and sweet  One anxious pray'r to Heav'n's high Mercyseat  Thither shall cherub'd Peace the record bear  Whilst radiant Hope shall fix her anchor there  IMPROMPTU  Written with one stocking on the

DIMM'D were the beamy stars of night  The moon had veil'd her temp'rate light  The gale was rude the gale was high  And cheerless shew'd the low'ring sky  All hous'd within an aged yew  Whose boughs were dank with midnight dew  Night's lonely bird with sadd'ning strain  Awoke the echo of the plain  Whilst still the sweet responsive maid  From forth her dark unnotic'd shade  Repeated slow the doleful tale  And faintly gave it to the gale  'T was then the churchyard's hollow sod  With frantic step poor Nancy trod  She sought the spot where Henry slept  And o'er his grave in anguish wept  Fond Friendship's hand had planted there  Such flowrets wild as woodlands bear  The cowslip sweet the vi'let blue  There drank soft Pity's falling dew  The panzy pale the wild rose red  Were cluster'd round her Henry's head  And waving o'er the thronbound grave  The woodbine there its fragrance gave  Beside the spot a willow grew  Of love like her's the emblem true  From that one votive branch she broke  And thus the lovely mourner spoke  " Who can the friendly charm impart  To heal poor Nancy's broken heart  On this green grave she rests her head  To weep her friend her truelove dead  Then from the tomb dear youth return  Nor longer let thy Nancy mourn  In pity quit the cheerless grave  And from despair thy Nancy save  He comes he comes I see him now  On yonder mountain's spiry brow  At

SHAKSPEARE  TO MISS LEE  Author of "The Recess"  FAIRY minstrels haste away  Here attune the pensive lay  Where these roses crown the sod  Avonia's Bard awaits his God  Though Avon's stream for ever flow  So sweet a Bard it ne'er shall know  Child of Nature void of Art  How he knew the human heart  When the magic shell he strung  Echo glad responsive sung  Whilst the cowslip's fairy train  Lightly trod the daisy'd plain  And still at fall of dewy night  By the Moon's uncertain light  Whilst they move to airs divine  Round his tomb they sweetly twine  VERSES ON SEEING THE TRAGEDY OF THE REGENT  Mr B being just landed from a long and stormy passage from abroad wrote five lines to his Mother and retired to rest On rising to eat his dinner at a miserable inn he asked  "If they had any book in the house"  Some one replied  "A gentleman had gone away and left a playbook behind him"  Mr B desired to see it it entered with his dinner which he left to take care of itself until he had finished that charming piece He unlocked his writingbox wrote the following lines sealed and sent them off by post then ate his dinner Mr B sometimes said when shewing them to his friends  "I do not suppose that Mr Greathead ever knew from whom he received them"  A lady of very high rank and very cultivated mind once asked Mr B's Mother  "Whether early friendship had not led Mr B to see the Regent with such very partial eyes"  Mrs B replied  "That she believed her son was not at all acquainted with Mr G but that had she been a poet she would have said as much as her son had done"    TO BERTIE GREATHEAD ESQ  AWAKE ye Nymphs of Avon's stream  Of Shakspeare's verse the fav'rite theme  No more within that sparry cave  Whose mouth Avonia's waters lave  On coral beds in grief recline  But

breathing lute  For ages lost for ages mute  That Genius erst on him bestow'd  Whose pictur'd breast with fancy glow'd  For wak'd by notes that oft have charm'd  Again by hallow'd frenzy warm'd  Hark Echo quits her mossy bed  And scarce believes her Shakspeare dead  Again by Avon's silver stream  A Bard resumes great Nature's theme  Spurning the rules of sordid art  Guided but by a feeling heart  From Nature's self the picture draws  Confin'd by none but Nature's laws  To Fancy's realm the daring wight  On eagle wing pursues his flight  And wand'ring blest those bow'rs among  Where

PENNANT'S TOUR  TO MARY LADY CLARKE OF PENNYCUICKE  STILL was the night and gently roll'd the wave  When Almond's banks a pensive poet sought  And free from care his rustic lay attun'd  When lo by some superior pow'r compell'd  The silver waves in equal parts divide  And thence two lovely virgin forms arise  The fairest they of Caledonia's fair  Who thus with accent soft the bard bespeak  " Be thine the task our hapless fate to sing  Whilst we O Bard thy rustic verse inspire  Still on these banks our pensive spirits stray  And oft at evetide by the swains are seen  In ages past we were for friendship fam'd  Nor love nor death our friendship could destroy  One happy youth by both alike belov'd  Was with our kindest tenderest wishes bless'd  Whilst he for each with equal passion burnt  When from contagions dire we hither fled  For us on yonder hill a bower he built  And oft at evetide climb'd the steepy brae  A Scotch expression  To meet the willing partners of his love  But when at once the azure skies we sought  O'er our remains a simple tomb he rear'd  Then died and join'd us in the realms of light  Oh from our tender tale this moral learn  That real friendship lives beyond the grave  And when from earth remov'd it seeks the skies  It then for ever burns a flame serene  And gilds the regions of eternal day"  The Almond's willing waves again divide  And from his sight the lovely phantoms sink  VERSES ON MRS BILLINGTON'S APPEARANCE AT OXFORD  TO THOMAS BARRETT LENNARD ESQ  IN ages past the sweetlyflowing strain  By Orpheus pour'd along the verdant plain  Disarm'd the tiger's fierce relentless rage  And could the lion's horrid wrath asswage  Secure from harm amidst the bloody throng  The lovelorn bard attun'd his plaintive song  Next old Amphion prov'd the pow'r of sound  And bade his walls defenceless Thebes surround  Such were the wond'rous feats of former days  And such the force of longforgotten lays  Though now at Musick's voice no ramparts rise  No lion fell in magic thraldom lies  Yet still its sweet resistless pow'r remains  We feel its force in living vocal strains  For hark how worthy of Apollo's praise  Eliza tunes her softlythrilling lays  And whilst full many a proud aspiring fane  In echo sweet prolongs the cheerful strain  Behold forth issuing from the portals wide  Display'd in many a long and sable tide  The letter'd sons of holy science come  By music lur'd to quit that peaceful home  Where tranquil pleasures crown the passing hour  And Wisdom dwells unaw'd by tyrant power  Behold how round Apollo's shrine they throng  And list enraptur'd to the swelling song  But markSwift passing through the buoyant air  Yon gloried car a nobler tribute bear  See Handel source of sweet majestic strains  Direct his flight to these his favourite plains  Behold him now with mute attention pause  Now join with rapture bright the just applause  Since Handel then approves the lovely dame  And stamps his fiat on her lasting fame  From lov'd Parnassus' height desced ye Nine  And round her brows your brightest laurels twine  THE POWER OF LOVE  TO ROBERT BERKELEY ESQ JUNIOR OF SPETCHLEY PARK WORCESTERSHIRE  ALTHOUGH the Muse in ev'ry age  With Cupid's wreath has deck'd her page  And tutor'd by the wily boy  Has tun'd her lyre to themes of joy  Yet History sweet recording maid  By Truth allur'd forsakes the shade  And as adown the stream of time  She steers her course with port sublime  She pausing points to many a grave  Where Love thy willows weep and wave  Through sad Voclusa pensive strays  And Nature's tender tribute pays  INVOCATION TO CUPID  TO FREDERICK REYNOLDS ESQ  DECK'D with rays of purple light  Hither Cupid wing thy flight  Through the pure unclouded sky  Let thy shafts unnumber'd fly  Bid the warblers of the grove  Bow before the shrine of Love  And with thy resistless dart  Pierce O pierce each youthful heart  Hark how round thy hallow'd shrine  Sweetly chaunt the tuneful Nine  O'er the green enamel'd plains  Pouring all their magic strains  Phoebus now with fervid rays  Lights thy altar's holy blaze  And touching soft his magic lyre  Joins the sweet Aonian choir  INSCRIPTION FOR A GOTHIC NICHE

the glare of noon  Here have hail'd the rising moon  Here with glitt'ring visions blest  Have they sunk to downy rest  Here have wak'd this truth to know  Wild ambition leads to woe  Whilst around your eyes you turn  From this cell one moral learn  Far from Fortune's flatt'ring gale  Cautious spread your little sail  See yon once aspiring fane  The magnificent ruins of St Augustine's Monastery are seen in a most beautiful point of view from Dr Berkeley's garden in the Oaks    With ruin sad bestrew the plain  Whilst within the fretted tower  Night's lone bird selects her bower  Yet the zealot's ruffian hand  Speeding ruin o'er the land  Spar'd this rude this humble cell  Where Contentment chose to dwell  Those who from the prelate's hand  Tore the crosier's jewel'd wand  Bad the

Though in life no pain he knew  Yet from life few joys he drew  Still the social passions slept  Hope alone her vigil kept  Thus in Eden's hallow'd shade  Sweetly sang the blueey'd maid  "Tenant of this happy plain  Stranger blest to ev'ry pain  Still imperfect is thy state  What is life without a mate  Rising with the second morn  Lovely woman shall be born  Blest with her thy breast shall know  Charms divine from love that flow"  Pausing here the blueey'd maid  Ceas'd to sing in Eden's shade  Charm'd by strains so sweet so blest  The common father sunk to rest  When appear'd the second dawn  Pleas'd he trod the verdant lawn  Seated 'neath a woodbine's shade  Soon he saw the perfect maid  Each in mutual wonder gaz'd  Love within each bosom blaz'd  Rosy blushes tinge the fair  Smiling cherubs bless the pair  Each transported with their lot  Join to bless the nuptial knot  To a more sequester'd shade  Adam led the blushing maid  Lock'd within each other's arms  Gazing on each other's charms  Each exchang'd a balmy kiss  Giving thus a birth to bliss  INSCRIPTION FOR THE FRONT OF SINGLETON ABBEY  This name was chosen by Mr B    TO MISS MALTHUS'S  Several very beautiful accomplished young ladies and some with highly cultivated minds The eldest of them very little turned of twentytwo years used to declare that they would not wait to be derided by the gentlemen as  old maids  if any GENTLEMAN can give such names That they would prepare some fine old abbey join their fortunes and there reside excluding all men whatever before the time arrived that English not Irish gentlemen usually leave off their attentions to the ladies In bare justice to Irishmen of fashion it must be said  their  politeness is as perfect to the matron of sixty as to the nymph of sixteen they are too correctly wellbred to talk nonsense to a dowager or a matron Mr B declared that it would be impracticable to exclude ALL gentlemen that they must have a receiver of their rents c and that he insisted on having  that  office A very elegant amiable young gentleman educating for the church and of which he is now an ornament being a most excellent parish minister the Reverend H R Master of Arts assured them that they must have a chaplain These two favoured youths were therefore to be admitted Mr B said  "If they would retire it should not be into obscurity for that he would write an inscription and fix it up in large gold letters"  The idea occasioned much innocent mirth Most of the sixteen are happily married It is the fault of the remainder that they are still fit for SINGLETON Abbey  THE BELOVED THE RESPECTED FRIENDS OF HIS EARLY YOUTH  KNOW Trav'ller in this sweet sequester'd cell  No weeping maids no slighted virgins dwell  Within these walls are found a vestal train  The loveliest maids that e'er adorn'd the plain  Nor yet esteem this pile a specious tomb  Where beauty pines in neverending gloom  No mattins here disturb the morning sleep  No lovelorn maids forsake their couch to weep  Along these walls no gloomy torches burn  Nor sad disclose where rests some mould'ring urn  Before no sculptur'd saints they prostrate weep  Nor at their shrines the midnight vigil keep  Here dwell the Graces three the Sisters nine  And them alone these maidens deem divine  By fancy led they sought these pleasing shades  And are what vulgar mortals call Old Maids  Yet many a native charm they still possess  Unborrow'd from the gaudy art of dress  Still on each cheek the bloom of youth appears  And prudence is their  only  proof of years  THE FAIRIES  TO MISS GRIMSTON YOUNGEST SISTER OF THOMAS GRIMSTON ESQ OF GRIMSTON YORKSHIRE  The Conqueror found the lineal male ancestor of this truly respectable uncommonly worthy amiable family seated at Holderness The present Thomas Grimston rebuilt the house at Grimston about ten years ago and on finishing it kept open house several days when the poor and the distressed ever objects of the peculiar care of this excellent family were most nobly remembered indeed On the first day of the gala after dinner Mr Grimston wrote to town an order to liberate from Newgate an old greyheaded villain who had defrauded him of a very large sum saying to his excellent brother H Grimston Esq  "I cannot enjoy any of this gaiety while I know that poor wretch  wicked as he is is in Newgate"  The letter written by H Grimston Esq is carefully preserved by the writer of this note But they are the grandchildren of the eminently pious amiable Lady Le Gard mother of the late worth Sir Digby Le Gard  "Train up a child"  says Solomon  "in the way he should go"  A happy proof of this inspired advice is daily felt by all around this excellent family    HOUS'D within the cowslip's bell  As the simple milk maids tell  Shunning there the glare of day  Fairies pass their hours away  There they keep their mimic state  There the fall of night await  Then along their fav'rite hill  Or beside some haunted rill  Whilst around dull mortals sleep  Mystic vigils there they keep  With some wild fantastic rite  Greeting still the pow'r of night  THE IMMORTALITY OF VIRTUE  TO MRS FRINSHAM  A lady for whom Mr B had the very highest respect as have all who have the happiness of being  intimately  acquainted with her    FROM these numbers as they flow  Shepherdmaids this moral know  Soon shall Beauty's brightest bloom  Moulder in the cheerless tomb  Charms that light the blaze of love  Soon the force of time shall prove  Vainly beams the glist'ning eye  Quench'd in dust each star shall lie  Yet when Death's destructive dart  Chills to rest the beating heart  Virtue's flame unquench'd shall burn  Cheer the grave and gild the urn  TO A NIGHTINGALE IN CLIFDEN WOOD  TO MRS D MONCK OF COOKHAM  SAY sad tenant of the grove  Whence the pains that now you prove  Why within your throbbing breast  Why is Sorrow still a guest  Sleeps in death your murder'd mate  Weep'st thou his melancholy fate  If 'tis that disturbs thy peace  Spring shall bid thy sorrows cease  Then thy breast that heaves in woe  With Love's bright flame again shall glow  Yet sweet mourner still complain  Nor though bless'd forbear thy strain  For sweetly sad thy warblings flow  And charming is thy song of woe  As at eve he treads the plain  Oft it soothes the shepherd swain  When he seeks the conscious shade  There to meet the village maid  He

lay  Nor will he e'er forget those blissful days  Where on your banks he tun'd his artless lays  To you his Muse this parting tribute pays  And sings but sings unbrib'd your modest praise  But now a long farewell ye nymphs ye swains  With you no more I tread the verdant plains  No more with you I share my joys my pains  Nor shall you hear again my plaintive strains  But ere lov'd Thames thy flow'ry banks I leave  Where oft I've hail'd th' approach of sober eve  Do thou whilst Fate permits a short reprieve  Dr Berkeley put off his journey to the university of St Andrew whither he accompanied his son from February when he meant to have set out until April    Do thou dear Thames  The pleasuregrounds at Dr B's house at Cookham go quite down to the Thames  this parting wish receive  "O ever gently flow thou hallow'd stream  O may thy waves be still the Muse's theme  When on thy banks pale Cynthia sheds her beam  "O there may Fancy gild the Poet's dream  THE AUTHOR  TO ARTHUR MURPHY ESQ  TO sing of beauty and its pow'r divine  Let other Bards invoke the tuneful Nine  Another theme demands my humble lays  A theme illum'd by Truth's resplendent rays  To no fictitious scenes the Muse shall rove  Nor seek by frenzy led the Delphic grove  Alas the mournful scenes we mean to shew  In real not in fancied life we know  The ills from Genius' source that daily spring  My pensive Muse in plaintive strains shall sing  All hail ye brethren of the tuneful art  Whether ye lull the ear or charm the heart  Whether beneath some halfroof'd shed you lie  Unpity'd live or unlamented die  Or if severer fate your sacred lays  Proclaim some titled Patron's fulsome praise  O list awhile to my untutor'd song  And bless those numbers which to you belong  In early youth when all our joys are pure  And pleasure wooes us with a harmless lure  When blest and thoughtless of our future fate  Around the cheerful hearth we lively prate  Whilst tales of goblins stern and fairies kind  Impress with pleasing awe the infant mind  Or if serener skies to fields invite  We chace with anxious steps the maybug's flight  Or else with pigmy hand the mead despoil  And cowslip's chaplet weave with curious toil  E'en then the hapless breast that Genius lights  With double rapture hails these first delights  To Fancy's sway he yields his guileless heart  Unaw'd by fashion and unspoil'd by art  To him who Fancy's magic influence knows  With brighter glow appears the blushing rose  By Nature form'd to relish all her sweets  Her daisy'd meadows and her green retreats  At length to school remov'd the happy boy  The mother's earnest of much future joy  Forsakes the scene of dear domestic bliss  The father's smile the mother's ardent kiss  Nor quits he yet without some falling tear  Those fields his infant joys have render'd dear  At first the clamour of the buzzing schools  And classic Lily's salutary rules  With terrors new his infant mind appall  And present fears his pristine joys recall  But when the dry grammarian's toils are o'er  And Ovid opens all his tender store  With kindred flame his ardent bosom glows  His version pure the rising genius shews  And the pleas'd master sees with flatt'ring hope  The early efforts of a future Pope  Now partial friends predict his rising fame  With hand unweary'd fan Ambition's flame  At length some guardian care removes the youth  To those blest scenes of wisdom and of truth  Where holy Science holds her peaceful reign  Where Genius wanders o'er the classic plain  On Isis' verdant bank he shapes his way  'Mid scenes that heard a Warton's virgin lay  Or lingers Cam beside thy sedgy stream  Of Mason's matchless verse the darling theme  Here Science wooes him with her tempting lore  He pants while she unfolds her mental store  With eager soul seizes the valued prize  Ambition prompts him and his prospects rise  Still where devoid of care the stripling roves  Beside the stream or through the nodding groves  Each lively thought the hallow'd Muse inspires  Big with idea glowing with her fires  He gazes round Genius adores the youth  And leads him smiling to the shrine of Truth  Perchance lov'd Isis by thy gentle stream  The wahdering youth pursues his wayward theme  And as thy waves in slow succession glide  To mix with Ocean's undistinguish'd tide  With fond expectance waits th' eventful hour  That yields departure from thy muchlov'd bow'r  With hopes of fame his hapless bosom glows  Nor more Content thy peaceful empire knows  Now glittering visions in his sleep appear  The splendid premium and the patron Peer  By Hope deluded and Ambition led  The willing Muse he vows for life to wed  With her he seeks that splendid sink of vice  Where Peers instead of Poets have their price  The Drama now his constant thoughts engage  With eager eye he rifles Shakspeare's page  And hopes like Murphy to adorn the stage  But though like him he matchless pow'rs possess  Though Phoebus' self the fond attempt should bless  Yet ere his numbers meet the public eye  A thousand deaths the hapless Bard must die  Condemn'd to torture by good Larpent's pen  Who cuts by patent and may come again  Larpent who dare the pouring wight arraign  Lo Genius struggles in his torpid chain  Near him Apollo veils his heav'nly fires  And ev'ry Muse with Larpent's name expires  At length arrives the dread the aweful night  When the maim'd infant sees the burst of light  The boxes fill'd with noisy froththe pit  Replete alone with malice and with wit  With vulgar dissonance the gall'ries arm'd  By nought but Edwin's monkey visage charm'd  In senseless clamour their huge prowess shew  And fright with noise alone the  Ton  below  Yielding rich harvest to the critic flail  Nurse Prologue then repeats her wonted tale  At length to ev'ry gazing eye appears  Who opes with Nature's key the source of tears  Critics though stern awhile their voice suspend  Till charm'd by Siddons at her shrine they bend  Yet what avails the tribute Nature pays  Her tenderest tear is but her noblest praise  The sons of sordid wealth and splendid pow'r  Feel but the sorrows of the passing hour  For mark the name 'mid glory's glitt'ring roll  Where Mis'ry scowl'd not on th' aspiring soul  Know those who wept o'er woes his fancy fram'd  Withheld the bread an Otway's hunger claim'd  Illfated Otway o'er whose melting page  Soft Pity's tear shall fall in ev'ry age  If ghastly Famine with unhallow'd pow'r  Triumphant mark'd his last expiring hour  Ah who by Genius bless'd yet curs'd by Fate  Can for his sorrow hope a shorter date  Yet list ye hapless sons of magic verse  While your deep woe my humble lays rehearse  From Fame's bright source let Hope refulgent shine  For yours alone is great Apollo's shrine  A shrine to which the fool shall never bend  Or off'ring there the god shall ne'er befriend  The time may come when England's rocky shore  Shall prize the balance of the world no more  When some proud victor o'er this happy land  Shall impious stretch the tyrant's fated wand  Whene'er o'er Britain doom'd to reign no more  Her shrine removing to the Western shore  Sweet Freedom heav'nly maid shall wing her way  And to new worlds disclose her lustrous day  The Nine lov'd partners of each former flight  Disdaining still to own a tyrant's right  With her shall seek the bless'd the favour'd clime  Where each shall wait the aweful close of Time  The jealous guardians of your wellearn'd fame  Shall to the tawney tribes your worth proclaim  And whilst around new empires rise to view  Their mingled praise shall still belong to you  Yet what avails this bright this flatt'ring thought  By Hope inspir'd nay more by Reason taught  Since ere her pillar Fame begins to raise  The fated Bard thy debt O Nature pays  When all the varied ills of life are o'er  And slighted worth is doom'd to feel no more  When hears'd in death the woeworn Genius sleeps  Then o'er his grave a grateful country weeps  And loads with costly pile the hallow'd spot  Where all that Famine spar'd is doom'd to rot  STANZAS ON PAINTING  TO THE REVEREND WILLIAM PETERS LLB  A panegyric in prose from a  feeble  pen on the  wonderful powers  of Mr Peter's  pencil  would be a vain attempt Perhaps it may be equally vain to attempt doing justice to the exquisite amiability of that worthy gentleman's heart and the very refined elegance of his manners He was most sincerely beloved and respected by Mr Monke Berkeley who in a letter introducing Mr P to his father Dr B says Pope has given his  true  character in few words  "The noblest work of God"  Mr P painted a picture of his friend which was by Mr B presented to his mother It is by some of the best judges of painting supposed to be the finest portrait ever produced by any pencil ancient or modern It preserves that wonderful depth of thought and that exquisite benevolence which so strongly animated the countenance of Mr M B The letter to Mrs B which accompanied the picture proves that Mr Peters wields his pen almost as ably as he does his pencil  WHEN first in Greece the Arts were young  And Muses wild rude numbers sung  That pow'r of Genius dawn'd on earth  Which o'er the tablet's polish'd face  The lines of Art began to trace  'Twas Beauty gave it birth  When Persian charms Apelles drew  The force of Beauty then he knew  Now see the Youth unconscious gaze  Now see the lifeless tablet bear  The graces of the living Fair  And Love's bright passion blaze  Obedient now to Painting's call  The Passions come attendant all  Now Joy supreme now deep Despair  Alternate fill the glowing scene  Now Madness wild now Grief serene  Now Vengeance rages there  How drear the scenes that Rosa chose  His pictur'd fields no bloom disclose  Nought but the dark and dreary pine  Or rocks immense of height sublime  Coaeval they with hoary Time  The marks of Pow'r Divine  But who thy glowing scenes can view  And crown thee Claude with honour due  Or who the sacred source can trace  Whence Raphael stole the spark divine  That through his forms is seen to shine  Or Rubens caught his grace  When Peters bids the canvas glow  With shapes but little known below  O say when cherub'd forms divine  In all their native glory shine  Say where the bounds of magic Art  Genius though station'd here below  No sublunary bounds will know  Like Peters still 'twill seek its theme  Beyond pale Cynthia's quivering beam  And charm the feeling heart  ODE TO LOVE  TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE LADY DUDLEY AND WARD  ALL hail to thee resistless pow'r  Before whose shrine all Nature bows  And fondly breathes her ardent vows  Hail parent of the blissful hour  Hail theme of Sappho's trembling lyre  Hail theme of Petrarch's plaintive strain  Hail mystic source of joy and pain  Hail theme of Nature's woodland choir  With mazy dance and breathing song  The joys around thy altar throng  Though amid thy smiling train  Jocund pleasures tread the plain  Yet mark yon spectre's gloomy air  Who whilst the Graces fondly twine  Their roseate wreaths around thy shrine  Insidious plants the cypress there  Say Cupid now what phantom drear  Approaches near  On whose torn breast  The serpent rears his scaly crest  Tearing with venom'd tooth  The seat of life and truth  Whilst through the gaping wound black gore  In sullen tide is seen to pour  Thy matted hair  Thy frantic stare  Thy green eye fell  These jealous fiend thy name will tell  See as the Loves disporting round  Dance to the rebeck's jocund sound  With rage inspir'd  By vengeance fir'd  Whilst horrorstruck the Graces gaze  See madly through the Daedal maze  As coupled now with writhing pain  In hurried step he treads the plain  And spurning Love thy wily song  Disperses thus thy frighted throng  O thou who 'mid the roaring wave  An early fate to Sappho gave  Who lur'd with Syren strain  And promis'd joy  The Grecian boy  To plow the wint'ry main  Though quench'd in night  Thy faithless light  That beam'd on high  And let a lover die  Amid the elemental war  He ask'd in vain the dovedrawn car  That erst thy goddessmother bore  From Neptune's realm to Paphos' shore  But deaf to Hero's ardent pray'rs  But heedless of a lover's cares  And deaf to sad Leander's cries  You sought false pow'r serener skies  Then Heloise thy victim fell  Ah see her stretch'd in yonder cell  By all thy fiercest passions borne  Berest of hope through thee forlorn  Attentive hear each groan each sigh  And mark the lamps that dimly burn  Around her lover's holy urn  Now pouring slow  Sad notes of woe  See Petrarch seek his Laura's grave  Hark how the saddening strain  Wanders o'er Vauclusa's plain  Thine are his lays  And thine the praise  Thou kindledst first the fatal fire  Then tun'd to grief his plaintive lyre  Round Laura's tomb  With cheerless gloom  Thy cypress sad is seen to wave  Whilst Pity's self slow pausing there  With Lethe's blissful balm  The mourner's pangs could calm  But yonder groan that pierc'd the air  Proclaimeth all thy reign despair  Since such thy pow'r since such thy deeds  Since gor'd by thee each bosom bleeds  From me thy shafts dread Godhead turn  Ne'er shall my breast devoted burn  Thy cup Circean freely give  To those who wish with thee to live  Thy arts I spurn thy joys despise  Minerva's smile alone I prize  ODE TO CONSCIENCE  TO MRS YEARSLEY  This celebrated poetess this sensible woman denies the existence of conscience    FOR ever hail thou great celestial pow'r  To whom belongs the subjectearth  Thou dread companion of the lonely hour  Who claim'st with man coeval birth  To curb the passions as they rise  To fix our hopes beyond the skies  To thee dread monarch of the mind  Has Nature's God this solemn trust consign'd  At night's still hour when guiltless bosoms know  The joys that blissful dreams bestow  O hither call that solemn tribe  Of days of years now long o'erpast  Whose voice not Eastern wealth can bribe  Whilst shrinks the soul through fear aghast  With accent deep as midnight knell  Each impious deed let Mem'ry tell  And trembling guilt appall'd shall hear  The twofold voice of Conscience and of Fear  On the raven's boding wing  From the dark domain of woe  Where the streams of sorrow flow  Hither all thy terrors bring  Of murther'd ghosts  By vengeance led  Let countless hosts  Surround the bed  Where terror struck thy frantic victim lies  And for each death he gave a thousand dies  Let horror paint that vengeful hour  When stern Eliza felt thy pow'r  Beside whose dying couch was seen  The ghost of Scotia's murther'd queen  And where distain'd with blood  The injur'd Essex stood  Pointing to that distant shore  Where the tyrant reigns no more  Whilst furies stern their gloomy torches wave  And sink her trembling to a hopeless grave  ODE TO TRAGEDY  TO MRS SIDDONS  O HALLOW'D source of fancy'd woe  Around thy shrine the streams that flow  From Pity's sacred source arise  Now lost in horror chill'd we gaze  And see thy hand the dagger raise  The fated victim dies  Where the pale body lifeless lies  Sweet Pity yields her throbbing sighs  And though deserving of the doom  Yet falls he not without a tear  Which shed by Virtue o'er his bier  Bids hope dispel the gloom  When first the Muse in Grecia sung  To comic strains her shell she strung  Then pleas'd alone with shepherd lays  But O when Genius pour'd her light  Along the gloom of early night  To thee belongs the praise  By ev'ry tragic bard of old  Of whom th' historic page hath told  By every dear departed shade  By mighty Shakspeare's honour'd dust  And by thy Otway's laurel'd bust  Descend to earth sweet maid  Still Britons feel thy glowing rage  Illum'd by Shakespeare's magic page  Still o'er thy Otway's verse we mourn  When impious Cawdor's guilty queen  With murder stains the horrid scene  O how our bosoms burn  When fair Monimia weeping pleads  And when her hapless husband bleeds  Whilst tears bedim her radiant eyes  Sweet Pity's self descending there  Attempts to soothe the hopeless fair  With sympathetic sighs  When catching frenzy from thy page  Immortal Siddons treads the stage  The Fairies stern awhile refrain  A while their scorpion lust restrain  And pleas'd behold the scene of woe  Uncertain if our tears and sighs  From true or fancied ills arise  But ah the sweet delusion o'er  Again they steep their snakes in gore  And bid our sorrows flow  ODE TO GENIUS  TO THE REV WILLIAM MASON AM PRECENTOR OF THE CATHEDRAL CHURCH OF YORK  GENIUS thou pow'r fublime and bright  Thou radiant spark of heav'nly light  Sent from above our toil to cheer  How in Shakspeare's hallow'd page  Glowing with poetic rage  Thy magic strokes appear  Spenser seiz'd thy trembling lyre  How he felt thy sacred fire  Let his matchless numbers tell  Goblins stern and Fairies kind  Airy offspring of the mind  To them he tun'd his shell  Milton too that bard divine  Bow'd before thy sacred shrine  Of cherub'd hosts and heaven's high throne  Soaring bold on eagle's wing  O how sweetly did he sing  But ah he sung alone  Inspir'd by thee majestic Young  Of Death and Fate sublimely sung  And while he tun'd his solemn lyre  By pale Luna's fickle light  How he charm'd the ear of Night  And bade our souls aspire  Then Collins chaste and Theban Gray  Gave to thee the ardent lay  Pleas'd you heard their numbers flow  Mason's verse you now inspire  Charm'd you tune his matchless lyre  And dwell with him below  PROLOGUE SPOKEN BY THE AUTHOR ON OPENING THE NEW THEATRE AT BLENHEIM OCTOBER  TO THEIR GRACES THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF MARLBOROUGH  THOUGH each theatric wight in prose or rhyme  Condemns of course the drama of his time  'Tis better sure than when in tilted cart  Each tragic hero mouth'd his thund'ring part  The Muses thentheir brains a little crack'd  Were fairly subject to the  Vagrant Act  But mark how greatly chang'd their  present  state  Victims no more of law caprice or fate  Thricewelcome now to Shakspeare's native isle  Where Genius hails them with a fost'ring smile  Whilst Spenser's princely race erect their shrine  'Midst scenes for ever sacred to the Nine  These scenes of old how fam'd for beauteous dames  And Blenheim  now  the palm of beauty claims  Within  this  shade as say the tales of old  As Hull in pensive verse hath sweetly told  HERE Nature's fairest rose was seen to bloom  Till jealous rage decreed an early tomb  Where her cold ashes rest let no stern prude  In all the pomp of vestal pride intrude  By Pity's tears embalm'd still lives her name  By mercy screen'd from infamy and shame  His lyre to strains uncouth HERE Chaucer strung  And o'er THESE plains his Gothic stanzas sung  And erst within this dark embowering shade  The stern Eliza dwelta captive maid  Then free from murd'rous deeds and crimes of state  And guiltless  then  of sainted Mary's fate  Here Wilmot too the witty and the gay  Repentantsaw the close of mortal day  Oft o'er his urn shall British Genius weep  And there in watchet weeds her vigils keep  Nor Love's soft wreath alone shall Woodstock claim  Nor rest on GENIUS all her hopes of fame  HERE ere on Cressy's plain the victor fought  Great Edward's soul the flame of glory caught  And HERE when peace return'd to Britain's shore  When Marlb'rough bade his thunders cease to roar  And Albion triumph'd o'er unnumber'd foes  'Twas HERE her guardian hero sought repose  To crown with wealth her Marlb'rough's glorious toil  A grateful country gave THIS classic soil  She bade yon dome arise and by its name  Prolong'd her mighty warrior's lasting fame  Then round her godlike Marlb'rough's glory'd shrine  Bade all her brightest greenest laurels twine  And HERE through countless ages shall they bloom  And shed around a consecrated gloom  For still to Britain shall THESE scenes be dear  Since all the milder virtues flourish HERE  Like vernal suns with genial warmth they glow  And soothe the pangs of poverty and woe  But sick of worthies and their fame ye fair  Perhaps ye wish to know our bill of fare  Spoken before  Who is the Dupe  Know then fair Cowley's Muse will paint a wight  Who thinks that Learning's always in the right  But sure of tonish life he little knows  Who worships scholars and who laughs at beaux  Which of the bucks that shine in Pleasure's round  Was e'er a scholar or a critic found  By Fashion's rule the sweets of life they cull  "Gay by constraint and elegantly dull  See Hobhouse  "  They ne'er o'er Homer's thund'ring verses pore  And Tully's self they deem an arrant bore  When such the charming youths our isle can boast  What chance has Learning with a reigning toast  For both our sakes ye Fair I hope our Bard  Has on the softer sex been somewhat hard  For if the picture she presents be just  Thenbooks farewellconsign'd to mould'ring dust  For who the toils of Learning will pursue  If unprotected and ungrac'd by you  Spoken before the  Lyar  This night

copy preserved by his Mother without Mr B's knowledge Mr B perpetually burned numbers of beautiful productions of his early youth Mr B came one morning into his Mother's dressingroom saying  "He had just met with a little poem that he thought she would like to hear if at leisure"  He took his seat and read as far as to the five last lines then ceased and asked how she liked it Mrs B replied  "Like it my dear child why the man was a great villain and the poor girl a great fool Who wrote it"  Mr B replied  "It is not quite finished"  He then read the five last lines when Mrs B not guessing her son to be the writer exclaimed  "The moral is delightful and makes it  all  beautiful tell me if you know who wrote it"  He replied  "An Eton boy"  adding in his sweetly musical voice  "I am happy that you like it my dear Madam it is in verse what you have been inculcating on me from my childhood in prose"  Mr B at a very early age wrote a wonderfully beautiful panegyric on the late Earl of Chatham Nothing could ever prevail on Mr B to flatter  any one  but he ever spoke and wrote obliging truths most elegantly    WHERE gentle Avon winds its silver stream  A mossgrown cottage rears its humble head  There Lucy first the vernal air inhal'd  And spent beneath its roof her infant years  Like Avon's stream those years flow'd gently on  Nor heav'd a murm'ring sigh for pomp or wrath  Her Parents' toil to ease was all her care  Their cott with three small fields was all their store  This little all by labour not by fraud  Obtain'd by bounteous Heav'n was kindly blest  And ever did their frugal wants supply  To Nature not to Art her charms she ow'd  By all the hamlet were those charms confess'd  Still had she liv'd and still had happy been  Had honour been young Edward's constant guide  But Edward tutor'd long in Fashion's school  Lord of each pleasing art each winning grace  To visit Shakspeare's hallow'd Mulberry came  By Lucy guided to the classic shade  Beneath its ancient boughs he woo'd the Nymph  And twice two moons on Avon's banks he spent  Ere the sad Maid by hapless love betray'd  Yielded her virgin honour to his arms  Ye Vestals stern who oft a virtue boast  That springs unbidden in your frigid breasts  Scorning weak Love be still  severely  chaste  Yet spare oh spare poor Lucy's injur'd shade  For once resemble HEAVEN and pardon Her  If ever  You  for HEAVEN's pardon hope  For crimes  You  have though not from Love they spring  And had young Edward sought your cold embrace  Then you like Lucy might have lov'd and fall'n  Sad Lucy once possess'd her arms he left  To pluck fresh roses in a distant clime  And twice two years on transatlantic shores  Edward false Edward spent ere he return'd  To visit injur'd Lucy's native land  She like the plaintive bird her love bewail'd  And ever sighing stray'd on Avon's banks  Like Avon's stream her tears flow'd ceaseless down  For three long years her fate she sorely mourn'd  The fourth no longer able to endure  The pangs of hope delay'd and blasted fame  In Avon's stream the ruin'd Lucy plung'd  Avonian nymphs the lovelorn fair receiv'd  And deeply mourn'd a sister's hapless fate  And now vile Edward came to Avon's banks  His guilty steps he bent and sought his Fair  Who now on Avon's banks had ceas'd to stray  But ere poor Lucy's wellknown cott he reach'd  He met the Sexton grim who jeering said  "Go to thy Lucy 'neath yon yewtree's shade  In bridal honours deck'd she waits thee there"  Guided by the pale Moon trembling he went  But ah no Lucy there sad Edward found  Nought but the stone that told her tale of woe  Full long entranc'd in grief he speechless stood  Then sheath'd his glitt'ring poignard in his breast  And sunk expiring on his Lucy's grave  From this said tale one moral may we learn  That Virtue's paths alone are paths of peace  And that the man who these pure paths shall quit  For Pleasure's gilded halls and roseate bow'rs  Through life's long course will ne'er true bliss attain  THE RAPE OF THE WIG  WRITTEN IN THE YEAR  IT is necessary to prefix this short account to the following  jeu d'esprit  of Mr B then about eighteen Some of the students used to say that if Newbourn would wear a better wig his lectures would make a deeper impression on them and talked of burning the vile caxon One day the young gentleman since known at Bath by the name of Count E  an early friend of Mr B's at Eton school visiting an English gentleman who boarded at Mr Cook's snatched it off the peg in the  trance  ie the hall where it hung when he got into the street he told his friend that he had got it and was taking it home to burn it Mr B who ever from a youth hated  mischievous  mischief much as he  ever  loved innocent mischief replied  "Oh no do not burn it"    "What can I do then"  "Why let your servant or mine who will do itBetter dress it nicely fill it with powder and pomatum and give it a new ribband"  It was a tail wig This was agreed on Some of the gentlemen suggested that in the box in which it was returned an apology for the  theft  ought to be made and Mr B being ever a ready penman was told he must write the card He took up his pen with his usual alertness and wrote the following lines It was some weeks before the Author was known in the University  IMMORTAL Pope the ravish'd lock has sung  But since his classic lyre is now unstrung  Be mine the task the ravish'd Wig to sing  While thus my untry'd lyre I string  Accept O Newbourn  This very worthy Gentleman's estate is called Newbourn The young gentlemen among themselves used to call him Laird of Newbourn He was sincerely beloved and respected by Mr B and all the English students Most of those of large fortune and of fashion boarded at his house and a most pleasant abode they found it  nor this Wig disdain  Pray who this Wig from dressing could refrain  'Twas friendship only did the theft inspire  To make this Wig what students  must  admire  Now Art with Nature gladly will combine  To make thy spouse esteem thee  quite  divine  Professor Cook was a very excellent husband Mrs Cook most sincerely attached to him used to wish him to pay a little more attention to his dress of which he was remarkably negligent He was most conscientiously attentive to his pupils This worthy gentleman would never dine at General  's because his public day was the Lord'sday May he be imitated by many in both kingdoms who certainly shew the Almighty's wisdom in prefixing the word REMEMBER to the Fourth Commandment The excellent Lady Warwick the beloved sister of that divine writer the Honourable Robert Boyle says in her sweet Meditations  "The keeping HOLY the LORD's day is the hedge of Religion"  What would she have said had she lived in these days to see stagecoaches waggons cricketplaying c cThe late Penyston Powney Esq MP for Berks father of Colonel P during his life never suffered  any  waggons to pass through the town of Maidenhead He once set a man in the stocks who defied his authority    This Wig may now a constellation blaze  Whilst wond'ring Herschel shall enraptur'd gaze  When these you read chance anger from your breast  And pray be happy that your Wig is

modern beaux  Yet conscious still of some small share of worth  She 'll chuse a mate of fortune and of birth  If to this artless Fair an Earl should yield  You then in simple guise may take the field  And trusting only to your native charms  No more from France implore the loan of arms  But if the timid maid should droop through fear  Let your applause her sinking spirits cheer  On such gay scenes she never gaz'd before  And though you deign to smile will gaze no more  Yet should your plaudits crown her humble toil  She 'll plant your laurels in her native soil  Till wak'd by Merit's and by

Hauberk  Lord Westmoreland  Emma  Eva  Peasants Servants c c  LOVE AND NATURE  A PIECE IN ONE ACT  SCENE PARTLY AT LORD HAUBERK'S HALL AND PARTLY IN THE NEIGHBOURING FOREST  SCENE I  BEFORE THE CASTLE GATE  Enter a Number of Peasants as going out to Work  CHORUS  WHEN soars the warbling Lark on high  And Phoebus paints the glowing sky  With jocund hearts we reap the soil  That ever grateful pays our toil  And when the sultry work is o'er  Wellpleas'd we view the wintry store  Which princely Hauberk's lib'ral hand  So freely sheds around the land  But see the Sun he rises fast  Full half the dawn is now o'erpast  Then haste ye rustics haste away  Nor waste in sloth the busy day  Exeunt  Enter  Lord Hauberk  and  Lady Eva  HAUBERK  Sister can you the riddle of my Emma's love  Unfold Can you declare the hidden cause  Why vainly kneels each fond aspiring youth  Whom same of Emma's charms hath hither brought  EVA  That to unfold were far beyond the scope  Of such as deal not with the wizard tribe  Not one of all the farfam'd gallant knights  Who for your Emma's fame have broken lance  Hath yet obtain'd the bounty of a smile  To mark the path her Virgin Love hath ta'en  HAUBERK  'Tis strange 'tis passing strange that one in youth  When Nature's self is prone to freest speech  Should thus conceal from all the timid love  That surely burneth in her wily breast  This morn Lord Westmoreland hath greeting sent  And ere the close of day will sure be here  To ask the boon of Emma's lovely hand  A Peer he is not poor in noble worth  And held in good esteem by Henry's self  Beneath whose conqu'ring sway full well he fought  When haughty France beheld her lilies droop  I'll to the Maid and try to win her o'er  That on this noble Earl she deign to smile  Meanwhile see thou our bow'rs be gaily deck'd  And crown the board with all that princely is  Exeunt  SCENE II  A FOREST  Enter EMMA  EMMA  'TIS sure the time my Truelove chose and yet  Not here He is not wont to break his faith  Perchance the tim'rous deer hath led him far  And by its flight prolong'd the panting chace  For Henry sure can ne'er to me be false  And with my Henry blest how vain is wealth  SONG  What though within a hunter's cot  The Fates have fix'd my Henry's lot  Though there no gems refulgent blaze  A shrine to Love we yet may raise  At that blest shrine I'll ever bow  And each new year repeat this vow  That my fond flame through life shall burn  Illume my breast and gild my urn  But see he comes to meet his own Truelove  Enter HENRY  HENRY  Sweet health and joy to Emma of the dale  If Henry hath outstay'd the fixed time  If here the Nutbrown Maid hath lonely sat  The chace he pleads and Emma's pardon craves  EMMA  Though Henry had outstay'd his time yet Love  Had won his pardon ere the crime was own'd  SONG BY HENRY  When from my lovely Emma torn  Unheeded dawns the rosy morn  The panting chace in vain I try  For Emma still I ardent sigh  To you the generous Gods impart  The blessing of a tender heart  To Pity's sway your breast resign  And be that tender pity mine  At best how great a Lover's pain  But oh when doom'd to sigh in vain  When once of radiant hope bereft  The wretch has then no comfort left  EMMA  Say Henry why with doleful gloom o'ercast  Of Emma's love thus hopeless speak O say  HENRY  It grieves me much fair Maid that sad despair  Must check the grateful bloom of Emma's love  But vain the thought that Hauberk's daughter fair  Will quit yon stately pile with all its pomp  To rove a wandering Dame with Hunter poor  To dwell in arbour green or cavern dark  With one whom Nature's scanty bounty feeds  Who owns no lofty hall no wide domain  But Nature's tenant dwells in forest wide  Such life would ill befit a Lady fair  EMMA  So harsh a parley sure is not the right  Of one within whose artless breast sweet Love  Devoid of every grosser thought doth dwell  The arbour green by thee my Henry fram'd  Were to thy Emma dearer far than hall  Of Baron bold with costly gems o'erlaid  This head when pillow'd on my Henry's arm  Would lose remembrance of my former state  I'd dream of Henry's love and lasting truth  Nor would my waking sense bely my dreams  HENRY  But say when thickly falls the wint'ry sleet  When loudly howls the blust'ring storm around  When freezing snows shall silver all the plain  Say how will Emma mourn her distant home  EMMA  Indeed good youth you wrong your Emma much  When howls the blast around to thee I'll turn  In Henry's arms a peaceful haven find  In proud defiance of the storm without  Whilst Mem'ry shall restore the happy day  When first on Henry's form I grateful gaz'd  When from his den forth came the rav'nous wolf  Who all around his glowing eyeballs turn'd  And mark'd this helpless frame his destin'd prey  But ere the bloody deed the savage wrought  By Henry's conquering sword the victim fell  The life which Henry's ardent valour sav'd  His love once lost by me was little priz'd  Storm of thunder and Lightning  HENRY  Hark how the aweful thunders roll around  See Emma where the vivid lightnings flash  Go to the Castle straight thyself betake  Lest some mischance arrive which Henry's arm  Cannot avert I'll to yon cavern drear  And herd me with the tenants of the den  EMMA  If Henry's love I hapless lose O swift  May lightnings blast your Emma's worthless form  For life without thee is no worthy boon  HENRY  Love to my Emma for this gentle speech  For which my warmest thanks I grateful give  And more of Love's sweet parley would we have  But that the horn proclaims some hunter nigh  DUET  Then haste ye hours O haste away  Love impatient waits delay  Soon O soon my Love restore  From you ye Fates I ask no more  Ye Fairy Pow'rs in pity view  Two Lovers fond and ever

pride  EMMA  Lasting as life shall be your Emma's Love  HAUBERK  For which sweet Maid thou art most justly priz'd  Yet much it pains my love that thus in vain  Our martial youth their gallant feats display  In vain for thee they hold the Tourney's feast  In vain the victors claim one valued smile  Say Emma whence this cold this virgin pride  EMMA  Luckless I am that thus my senseless heart  Should prove the source of grief to Hauberk's breast  Yet 'till I see the youth whom Fate ordains  My Truelove for to be I trust kind Sire  That force will ne'er constrain your Emma's Love  HAUBERK

wond'rous art reflected bright you sure  Will leave your Emma free to hold her Love  HAUBERK  Still in this breast shall dearest Emma reign  Nor e'er my will your virgin choice shall sway  But grant this Knight be he whom erst you saw  That Hauberk's line no longer want an Heir  In two short hours we hope him here till then  Farewel  Exit  EMMA  O in what stern array doth duty meet  My Virgin Love but Nature will prevail  SONG  No human pow'r can e'er control  The freedom of a Lover's soul  Each motive base it nobly spurns  And bright with purest passion burns  By duty led to Hymen's shrine  We may our persons there resign  Our hearts we yield to Nature's voice  And mighty Love approve the choice  Exit  SCENE IV  THE WOOD  Enter HENRY  HENRY  SCARCE of the lessening day doth aught remain  Yet Emma comes not to th' accustom'd oak  How weak is woman's love like some gay rose  At breath of wint'ry blast it droops it dies  Yet still each blissful hour that life can boast  From Beauty's smiles derives its welcome birth  SONG  Blooming joys for ever new  Lovely Maids belong to you  Yours the tear and yours the smile  That alike the heart beguile  Wand'ring in this world of woe  'Tis from you our pleasures flow  Yours the dance and yours the song  You the charms of life prolong  'Rest of love say what is life  Barren toil and noisy strife  Yours ye Fair the magic pow'r

Maid we now must part  EMMA  Part part from thee Use not so harsh a sound  O never neverIn thy arms I'll die  But from my Henry partIt ne'er shall be  HENRY  Alas it must for I have done a deed  At sound of which thy gentle blood shall freeze  I just have fought a gallant Knight whom late  I chanc'd to meet He to Lord Hauberk bore  Kind greeting from a noble Earl who comes  To claim that hand which never can be mine  This Knight in madd'ning rage I rashly slew  And now must hence an outlaw'd wretch to roam  Therefore sweet Maid farewel We meet no more  But when your Earl you wed of Henry think  EMMA  O stay in pity stayI 'll freely tread  With thee the howling waste the desart drear  Though yonder Knight you slew yet take not now  With keener sword your oncelov'd Emma's life  With thee all eartly woe I'll dauntless brave  Sharp hunger's pangs and pinching cold in vain  Assail the breast where burns the flame of Love  How dark how drear soe'er the horrid scene  It sheds around the cheerful light of joy  Henry be not so cruel to thy Love  HENRY  In vain you pleadAh say deluded Maid  Would you whose mind is pure as winter's snow  Assort with one distain'd by foulest guilt  Whose nightly rest the murther'd sprites would break  Say Emma would'st thou share the thorny bed  Around whose sides at night's dread hour the ghosts  Of murder'd men would angry stalk and to  Thy fearful sight disclose their gaping wounds  Then call for vengeance on this guilty head  EMMA  If such dread ills await my constant Love  They will not turn me from my Henry dear  At night when stalk these ghastly sprites around  I'll soothe thy haunted mind and bid thee rest  And each returning day that dawns shall see  These hands to Mercy's throne uplifted high  To ask the peace of those whom Henry slew  HENRY  Peace gentle Maid go meet thy destin'd Lord  Whilst to you height I bend my guilty steps  'Mid forests drear lament my horrid crimes  Whilst Echo's self shall tremble to repeat  The murderous tale  Exit  EMMA  O cruel Youth for this did Emma love  How my head burnsand O my heart it beats  SONG  How deep the sorrows of this day  My faithless youth is gone away  Had Henry lov'd the nutbrown Maid  In arbour green with her he'd staid  Cold is the grave colder my love  How great the pain that now I prove  Her Henry gone poor Emma mad  Will sit beneath the willow sad  From rosy morn to dewy eve  Beside a brook will Emma grieve  Till o'er her sad untimely grave  The willow green shall weep and wave  But I must hence for see here comes the train  Of one who vainly hopes this heart

grief a father's love can soothe  EMMA  No my good Lord save only that just now  I chanc'd to hear a Minstrel's ditty sad  Of Rosamond the Fair who was conceal'd  In mystic bower by royal Henry's love  Till that the jealous Queen destroy'd her swift  By wicked draught of pois'nous juice Therefore  My Lord I wept and sigh'd at hearing of  This grievous tale  HAUBERK  Since such the source of Emma's grief we hope  'Tis o'er and that she now will kindly look  Upon this noble Earl  EMMA  If such be he as once in mirror bright  I chanc'd to see your Emma's hand is his  Enter Lord WESTMORELAND  HAUBERK  Most noble Lord right welcome are you here  Both to myself and to my daughter fair  EMMA  'Tis he 'tis Henry's self  HAUBERK  What means this speech  HENRY  This riddle Sir 'tis we alone can read  Suffice it now to say that Emma's love  Has long been mine and here I kneeling claim  The promis'd joy of virtuous Emma's hand  EMMA  Though much you tried your Emma's constant love  Yet still to her is gallant Henry dear  Though not more dear than if in forest wild  With thee dear youth a wand'ring life she 'd led  For then the flame of Love had purely shone  Illum'd by that the cavern drear had seem'd  Some stately palace fair  TRIO  How truly blest this happy hour  So sacred now to Hymen's pow'r  When Emma's self by duty led  No longer fears her choice to wed  Whilst all unite with cheerful lay  To hail this happy happy day  May Love the path with roses strew  And each fond heart through life be true  HAUBERK  Grant Heaven the sun of joy that gilds this day  For countless years unclouded shine on all  Who here are come to hail this happy hour  HENRY  Since in yon forest wide I won that love  Which more than India's boasted wealth I prize  If such your liking is within that shade  This day our bridal feast we 'll joyous keep  Whilst all your hinds shall share a master's joy  HAUBERK  Ne'er shall refusal check so fair a thought  And see the toil of harvest o'er they

Exeunt omnes  IT is hoped that the excellent Writer of the following  Jeu d'Esprit  will pardon his old his throughly grateful Friend for publishing it without his knowledge or consent That it is the first offence of the kind cannot be pleaded in excuse The former offence was pardoned the work was of a very different kind an excellent little tract for the children of the Sunday Schools near his own estate There being no titlepage the Writer of this introduction prefixed one  "Written by Henry Grimston Esquire"  of whom it may with strictest truth be asserted that he is  "Of manners gentle of affections mild  "In wit a man simplicity a child"  To attempt an elaborate character of Mr Grimston would be too weighty a task it may be learned from every distressed man woman or child in his own neighbourhood Suffice it to say that the Editor esteems it a real happiness  to have lived in the strictest friendship with Mr Grimston for the last fifteen years often for many months together under the same roof and never observed or even heard that he had the shadow of any vice but firmly believes that he is blessed with every virtue He was the chosen the beloved the respected the bosom friend of the amiable hearted GeorgeMonck Berkeley Esquire His  unwearied attentions  to Mr Berkeley during the two last years of his painful journey through this vale of misery to the realms of bliss prove the soundness of Mr Berkeley's judgement when at the age of about twenty he said to his Mother  "I have I thank God many friends that I  love  and  some  that I  respect  but the man I fix on for my fast friend through life is Grimston"  Mr Grimston is the grandson and in some sort the  eleve  of as his lovely mother died to  "give him orphan'd in his birth"  as speaks the eloquent Dr Young in the Night Thoughts the excellently wise and throughly pious Lady Le Gard mother of the late Sir Digby Le Gard  AN EPISTLE TO MRS LENNARD  Dear Madam  I take the liberty of transmitting to you a copy of verses which I found under the table in the corner of our room they were almost illegibly written on a dirty scrap of paper My dog Teazer  A beautiful Highland Tarrier given by Mr Monck Berkeley to Henry Grimston Esquire  to whom you were so kind was laying by them when they were found and from the subject matter I am led to suppose they must have been addressed from him to you I have therefore copied them out fair in order to render them legible and hope you will excuse the lines as the canine race are not much given to poetry I beg my compliments to my friend Lennard and your little ones and remain your obedient humble servant  Henry Grimston  Berkeley's best regards attend you and Mr Lennard  T Barret Lennard Esquire an old and affectionate friend of Mr Grimston and Mr Monck Berkeley with his very lovely lady went from Essex to visit their dying friend During their visit Mr Grimston's dog was so kindly treated as is every creature rational and irrational by Mrs Lennard as to induce the dog to follow Mr Lennard's carriage a long way Mr Berkeley said the dog shewed the superiority of his sense above English dogs Mr Berkeley revered Mrs Lennard's loveliness of disposition and rejoiced that Providence had blessed his dear old friend with  such  a lovely partner Long may they enjoy their felicity  and the olive branches  IT may perhaps seem odd indeed  That I a simple quadrupede  Should thus presume with pen and ink  To tell you what I truly think  But gratitude inspires my lay  And truth shall dictate all I say  Nor need I fear t' incur displeasure  Who felt your kindness without measure  It is with gratitude I own  The frequent gift of many a bone  The plates of beef so nicely drest  The mutton fat the chicken's breast  Then since such kindness I've receiv'd  If  Teazer's  word may be believ'd  I 'll ne'er whilst I have pow'r to eat  Forget the hand which gave me meat  With anguish think upon the day  When you from Hastings drove away  Why would that cruelhearted boy  My hopes of happiness destroy  Why in his arms my legs restrain  That long'd to follow o'er the plain  But now alas I'm left to grieve  Since without thee I'm doom'd to live  I range about in vain to find  A Lady who is half so kind  Oft as I pass that lonely door  Which now seems shut to ope no more  Where by thy bounty I was fed  And thy fair hand oft strok'd my head  I sigh to think the change I find  Since I by thee am left behind  For now alas hard fate is mine  On fishes' bones I'm doom'd to dine  Or else with mutton beef or veal  I'm forc'd to make a scanty meal  Since then 'tis you such pleasure give  With you fair Dame I wish to live  Yet I've no right t' expect on me  Alone you 'll exert your charity  Since Birds and Beasts of every kind  In you a sweet Protectress find  In Summer Autumn Winter Spring  To you the Can'ry Bird shall sing  The Robin too in Winter's frost  Shall visit you his generous host  The Poultry tribe around your door  Shall all receive your bounteous store  The constant Turtledove shall coo  In notes of gratitude to you  And every living thing shall see  A kind protecting Friend in thee  A MORNING HYMN  WRITTEN AND PRINTED BY THE LATE EXCELLENT BISHOP HORNE  It is here inserted to enhance the value of the volume of his beloved young friend who never saw it  APRIL PRESERVED AND PASTED IN A BOOK BY HIS SENSIBLE PIOUS AND HIGHLY RESPECTED FRIEND MRS COX  When Dr Berkeley's sermon preached at the consecration of his beloved friend Bishop Horne was by his earnest request published after his death Mrs George Berkeley sent

HENRY WOOTTON COMPOSED IN A NIGHT OF EXTREME SICKNESS  It is very possible that this glorious hymn of this eminently pious great man may be in print The Editor stumbled upon it some months ago looking over some papers written in the beautiful hand of her beloved partner on the back of a letter of a beloved cousingerman of his the throughly amiable T  M  Esquire of Dublin thus inscribed  "The last letter I ever received from my dear T  M  probably the last he ever wrote"  This gentleman beloved respected by all who knew him was seized on board the yacht with a violent fever landed insensible in Dubling and died in two days The Editor has never ceased to lament him She has double cause to do it now    O Thou great Power  in  whom I move  For  whom I live  to  whom I die  Behold me through thy beams of love  Whilst on this couch of tears I lie  O cleanse my sordid soul within  By thy Christ's blood the bath of sin  No hallow'd oils no grains I need  No rags of saints no purging fire  One rosy drop from Jesu's side  Was worlds of seas to quench thine ire  O precious ransom which once paid  That "  consummatum est  " was said  And said by HIM that said no more  But seal'd it with his sacred breath  Thou then that hast dispung'd my score  And dying wast the death of death  Be to me now on thee I call  My life my strength my joy my ALL  As this Hymn was written before the  Father of Mischief  had introduced the word METHODIST  ie  a TITLE indiscriminately now conferred on all those who  endeavour  to live their short  inch  of TIMEas believing they  must  pass the neverending circle of  Eternity  either in HEAVEN or in HELLthat word which Dr L  t Dean of Peterborough preaching at Court about seventy years ago said  "A  place  which  I  will  not name  in so  polite  a congregation"  It is possible that the  elegant  Dean and  some  of his  polite  congregation might now be able if we saw them to give us some account of  that  place May she who writes and all those who read this never see it but content themselves with our blessed Saviour's tremendous description of it  "where  their  worm dieth  not  and the fire is  not  quenched"  repeated to be sure ONLY  three  times within three minutes  de suite    AN ELEGY  ON THE DEATH OF MASTER GEORGEROBERT BERKELEY SECOND SON OF THE REV DR BERKELEY PREBENDARY OF CANTERBURY  Who died April aged eight years four months and four days after only one week's illness of a dreadful putrid fever then raging in Canterbury as did one of his beloved schoolfellows that lovely child Master Tatton only son of the Reverend Dr Tatton Prebendary of Canterbury and grandson of the charitable bountiful Dean Lynch No art could prevent this sweet child from calling three or four times in the day to know how his friend did Master Robert Berkeley sickened on one Saturday and died the next Master Tatton was going to take a ride it being holyday When got as far as Burghgate the  dismal  sound of the  great  bell assailed his ear he dropped his bridle and said to the servant attending him  "Ah  my dear  Robert is dead and my ride is spoiled"  He turned his horse went home fickened that very evening and died the next Saturday These little creatures were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their deaths were not divided The elegant  application  of this text is borrowed from a most charming letter of the highly cultivated Mrs Cox of St Giles Oxford to Mrs George Berkeley thanking her for Dr Berkeley's longsmothered sermon preached at Lambeth Palace at the consecration of his beloved old friend the angelic Bishop Horne see p Dr Berkeley did not long survive his beloved Friend They have  now  met to part no more    Oh just beheld and lost admir'd and mourn'd  POPE  "O may I ever like the Saints above  "Adore my Maker with seraphic love  Reading one day to his Mother the subject led him to enquire what was the difference between a Cherub and a Seraph He was told that it was supposed by Divines that Seraphs loved God most but that Cherubs knew more of God and of his adorable nature He paused near a minute and appeared to be in deep thought then looking on his Mother he said  "Mamma Mamma pray listen to me I do desire to be a Seraph that I may love God a great deal rather than be a Cherub and have a vast deal of knowledge"  This was remarkable as he had a very uncommon thirst for knowledge The above choice was made just a month before his death when in good health in high gay spirits being just come in from playing with some of his schoolfellows    "I ask not earthly treasures to obtain  "Be poverty my lot if Christ's my gain  When he was but seven years old reading that part of the Gospel where our blessed Saviour says  "How hardly shall they that are rich enter into the kingdom of Heaven"  he started dropped the Bible on the table and said  "What can NO rich people go to Heaven"  Being desired to proceed and see what would follow he redde  "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of Heaven"  He added  "Then I am sure it is impossible"  On being told that Christ says how hard it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of Heaven and that riches are apt to draw off the heart from God although that is not always the case he laid down his book considered some time in silence then addressed his Mother as before  "Mamma Mamma pray listen to me"  and said  "I do desire to be poor and to go to Christ rather than to be very rich and live without him"  He naturally loved money exceedingly and never parted with it willingly but to the poor He would frequently borrow of the servants to relieve them if his allowance was all spent His Father and Aunt used to amuse themselves with borrowing six pence of him and then pretending they could not pay it that they might witness his  extreme  anxiety not to lose it He would say  "Why Mamma  tells me  that  no  honest people  ever  borrow money without paying it again as soon  as possible  and that it is  very wicked to run in debt  "  He would then repair to his Mother lament his hard fate and ask if he could not  make  them pay him What a contrast to his generous Brother Yet both were delightfully amiable children in their different ways It is supposed that Bishop Berkeley was  naturally  a lover of money An Irish nobleman an intimate friend of the Bishop's often mentioned to the Editor that on his  urging  Bishop Berkeley to accept the primacy offered to him by Lord Chesterfield the Bishop replied  "No my dear Lord I very early in life got the love of money here" lifting up his leg and setting it down with such force that it shook his library and every thing in it "and here by the grace of God I will  always  keep it"  This was uttered in the most energetic tone of voice A younger brother of Dr Berkeley's who died at about seventeen had the same spirit as his little nephew The Bishop early gave his sons a large allowance for cloaths c A collection was making for a distressed Baronet The Bishop called on his sons to contribute Dr Berkeley flew to his room and brought down twenty guineas The Bishop said  "Willy where is yours"  William  "Presently my Lord"  Bp B  "Willy I wait for your money"  William  "Yes my Lord immediately"  He went off slowly to his room and brought down  fifteen  guineas saying  "There it is"  But added smiling  "It is  really my heart's blood  but  I know  it is  right  to give to the poor"  "  Thus spoke the loveliest child  He was universally allowed to be very remarkably handsome He had fine large eyes with an uncommon mixture of sense and sweetness and very long dark eyelashes beautifully dark and finely arched He had fine nutbrown hair which curled on his forehead and round his face and hung in fine ringlets below the bottom of his back his complexion a fine distinct red and white  that e'er the sound  Of the last trump shall summon from the ground  Heav'n heard and yielding to the warm request  Receiv'd with open arms the longing guest  But ah how much that dread compliance cost  Say ye who mourn a Son a Brother lost  He loved his only brother four years older than himself so violently as is hardly to be described He has been often overheard by the servants of the family when alone with his brother to say  "Brother I will not live a moment after you die whenever you will If you go to fight against the French  I will  go too if you are shot I will be shot the very next minute"  His Brother until near seventeen was languishing to go into the army as most idle geniuses are the wisdom of his Father kept him out rejecting the kind offer of a cornetcy in the Oxford Blues made to him by his amiable Friend the late Lord Conyngham who having obtained it for a near relation of his Lady the youth altered his mindwhen dear Lord Conyngham offered it to Dr Berkeley whose brave Uncle Major Burton had married an Aunt of Dr Berkeley's This connexion and the  very  near neighbourhood of this amiable family added much to Mr Berkeley's and his parents pleasure from his childhood until Dr Berkeley quitted Cookham to attend his Son to the University of St Andrew's When he was not six years old his brother was exceedingly ill and refusing to take a medicine this lovely child came to him and in an agony of soul  not to be described  urged him to take it saying  "if you will not I must die"  This had the desired effect    Nor think though anguish should the voice restrain  Ye cannot tell your agonizing pain  More than the pomp and majesty of song  Or words that move in solemn state along  More than the deepton'd melancholy knell  The bigswoln eye and heaving bosom tell  What though from care and sorrow far away  He shines for ever in the realms of day  Still sigh we mustbut sigh alas in vain  No sighs no tears no wishes can regain  Can tears or sighs recall the fleeting breath  Or move the bosom of relentless death  What force of words what pathos can prevail  Where beauty innocence and ROBERT fail  He was always called by his second name    Lamented ROBERT thou whose spotless breast  No sin polluted no remorse oppress'd  Bless'd with the art affection to engage  He had been always told that God saw  all  that passed in his heart and he was so fully convinced of the truth of it that he never could be prevailed on to say any thing he did not really think and yet he had a sweet engaging manner of saying obliging things    Fond without flatt'ry arch above thy age  Manly in voice and look of heart sincere  He was remarkably manly in his gait his air and in his voice which was  very  deep but not at all a coarse bass    Stranger alike to ev'ry vice and fear  Oft as returning this lov'd school I see  Once bless'd with joy and liveliness and thee  Still from my bosom steal unbidden sighs  And thoughts of former happiness arise  What gen'rous pity in thy bosom glow'd  Thy ev'ry action ev'ry gesture shew'd  What strong emotions fill'd thy tender breast  To see a babe by sad disease oppress'd  Eager to pity though you durst not greet  You flew to kiss the wretched infant's feet  This alludes to a little incident which happened when he was only two years and a quarter old A poor woman of the parish brought a wretched little child to his Father's house to apply for relief the poor creature was covered over with a loathsome humour He sitting in his nurse's arms heard the mother tell its deplorable case he turned to his nurse and said  "Pray let me go and kiss it to make it well"  She fearing her darling might suffer by his philanthrophy said  "  No  you  must  not lest you should get any harm"  He submitted sat some minutes then sprang from her arms ran across the room and kissed each of the child's shoes saying  "There I have kissed its shoes I hope  that  will make it well and can do  me  no harm nurse"  When he was three years and a quarter old his nurse had a violent illness his grief was very great Some months afterwards she relating to a friend how ill she had been he was at the other part of the nursery much taken up as it was supposed with play he left his playthings ran to her and with tears in his eyes said  "Pray my dear nurse do not talk any more about your illness  I cannot  bear to think what I felt then"    "Ye who ere lost an angel pity me"  Says the eloquent Young Pity the relatives of this lovely child    Though from the gloomy mansions of the grave  Thee nor thy virtue nor thy form  He was very tall and graceful being measured a short time before his lamented death he was exactly five feet one inch Soon after his Father's going to reside at Canterbury the fame of his beauty was so dinned in the ears of an old Lady of the name of Knowler who never went out of her house that she desired a Lady of her acquaintance to request Mrs Berkeley to let Master Robert visit her the Lady took him thither the next afternoon which he spent with the good old LadyShe desired her friend to thank Mrs Berkeley and tell her with her compliments that although being near an hundred years old she had of course seen  many  children she had never during her  long  life of her own descendants or others ever seen so completely beautiful or sensible a childthat with the Queen of Sheba  "the  half  had not been told her"  could save  Can we forget the beauties of thy face  The seat of dignity and manly grace  What pow'r of song those auburn locks can tell  Which down thy back in graceful ringlets fell  What though a total dimness has o'erspread  The noblest eyes that ever grac'd a head  Still on their former lustre dwells the mind  Where lively sense and sweetness shone combin'd  No farther pow'rs fond Nature could unite  To raise our admiration and delight  Oh had she stopp'd content with the display  Nor rais'd their value by their shorten'd stay  But Faith perform'd what Nature could not do  Still other virtues Faith held forth to view  Faith ev'ry anxious thought and wish suppress'd  And warm'd with firm belief his youthful breast  Ev'n when some truth to question he inclin'd  Reflection brought this moral to his mind  "Man was not made to question but adore"  He stopp'd submissive stopp'd nor added more  He would when reading the Holy Scripture often ask questions not to be answeredLest a too great inquisitiveness might lead to scepticism he was told to keep always in his mind that fine line of Dr Young  "Man was not made to question but adore"  This was near a year before his death About six weeks before that dreadful event some doubts arising in his mind of a very deep nature he was told that those were questions that could not properly be known till mortality was swallowed up of life He replied  "To be sure man was not made to question but adore"  And proceeded in reading his chapter    At that black hour the cause of ev'ry sigh  When Death remorseless conqueror drew nigh  His soul while here his tortur'd body lay  Aspiring said "Lord teach my heart to pray  During his last illness of only seven days he was one night much troubled lest he should not go to God and cried out to the servant  The very sensible worthy Mrs Mary Farrant wife of Mr Farrant butcher and grazier at TownMalling Kent who idolized him and never complained of him to his Mother but once during his whole lifewhen it was most highly necessary to do it Mrs Farrant a neighbour's daughter lived from her early youth many years in Dr Berkeley's family She is one of the best tempered of women Her little charge when very young one night took it into his head that he would sing two or three lines of a little song upon every step as he ascended the staircase Mrs Berkeley happening to pass stood still to listen and overheard the amiable servant say  "Come Sir come you must go up quicker or I must call my Mistress"  To which he replied  "No no my dear Molly I know very well you won't  do that  "  On which Mrs Berkeley presenting herself the little man skipped off to his room in an instant and his Mother said  "Molly how many fibs you do tell that child for you know that you never told a tale of him in your life nor would if he was to torment you from morning till night"    "No to be sure Madam I should not for at last by threatening him with YOU I get him to do what he should do"  Mrs Berkeley till within these very few years made an annual grateful offering to a worthy woman who lived with her mother when SHE was six years old for not telling of her when she climbed the trees like a boy  who always waited upon him  "Molly teach me to pray"  She replied with tears  "My angel God will teach you to pray"  He said with great earnestness  "Lord teach my heart to pray"  He had always been told that the prayer which  reacheth  to God must come  from  the  heart  and with the heart this lovely creature often did pray He always used Bishop Kenn's prayers and hymns in The Winchester Scholar Whenever Mrs Berkeley was alone her children always offered their prayers and repeated or sang their hymns with her One evening as he was repeating the following verse in Bishop Kenn's evening hymn  But though sleep o'er my frailty reigns  Let it not hold me long in chains  And now and then let loose my heart  Till it an Hallelujah dart  his Mother desired him to omit it saying  "Although it might suit the exalted piety of Bishop Kenn it was in him little  Robert  mocking God as she did not believe he had devotion sufficient to wish to wake in the middle of the night to praise God"  He stood about a minute silent pensive then replied  "Why Mamma I do desire to awake to praise God in the night so if you please to give me leave I will say it as I always do when I say it to Molly Phipps"  the very worthy woman above named who doated on him and he on her His Mother rejoiced that her child excelled her in piety she always omitting it herself He was perhaps the most ingenious and accomplished little creature any where to be seen As his brother was resolved not to learn to read so he seemed resolved to learn without being taught He would conjure his mother not to tell him and clap his little hand over her mouth lest she should begin or rather go on speaking but as he termed it let him  guess it out  himself how words were to be spelt or pronounced At the age of four and an half he redde as well as he could have done at fourteen He could find out in the Calendar the lessons for the day for Sundays and holydays whilst he remained in petticoats On  week  days he sat with his Mother in the seats appropriate to the Prebendaries' Ladies The amiable worthy lady of the late Dr Caryl both of whom doated on him used to say  "It is like the idea one has of praying in Heaven to hear this  little  Cherubring this great choir when he chaunts I really believe he understands better what he is about than half the  grownup people  that come hither"  Accident discovered to his mother the strength of his memory her own was once pretty good she having often heard her mother say that she learned the alphabet at once shewing that the next day she knew every letter but Robert much excelled his mother Mrs Berkeley being a pretty good  Bible scholar  used to work with her needle as she never put out any work of any sort or kind whilst her children were reading the Scriptures In History Geography c that would not do One day observing little Robert going on perfectly right and finding his eyes fixed at the other end of the room she enquired what he was at looking off his book He replied  "Why Mamma you know when one has redde any thing  in  the book  once  one can read it  without  the book afterwards and a little while ago I redde this chapter  in  the book in the servants' hall Bible so now I can  read  it  without  the book to you today"  A boy having cut off some of his fine curling ringlets which hung below the bottom of his back he was very angry and said  "He would never forgive him"  His Mother assured him  "He would go to hell if he did not"  He then replied  "Then I will forgive him  but I will never forget it  "    "Yes you must or God will not love you"    "Well then if God  will have  me forget it he must MAKE me do it for I never did forget any thing I ever heard or saw in my whole life"  When a little child not being allowed scissors for fear of his beautiful eyes he with his fingers pinched out in paper birds beasts ships flowers c so accurately as was astonishing he drew very finely his second lesson a cow's head is preserved as a prodigy of genius He danced delightfully and could go through all the military exercise of the infantry Dr Berkeley always paid a serjeant for attending his Sons He spoke French as fluently as he did English He as well as his Brother repeated by heart and acted delightfully He chaunted and sang finely His beloved schoolfellows were lovely little Tatton the present sensible worthy Samuel Sawbridge esq of Ollantigh and the learned Dr Herbert Packe son of the celebrated Dr Packe of Canterbury The Saturday on which he sickened in the evening he flew up at twelve o'clock to conjure his Mother to give him permission to invite  "my dear Sam to dinner today"  It was alas the last dinner he ever ate he sickened about eight in the evening Here follows a proof of this gentleman's honesty in very early youth  Some  of the Upper School Boys had a  shameful  trick of  robbing  the very worthy Mrs Longley in the churchyard of  a dozen  oranges when they  purchased half a dozen  It was necessary to have one little boy as an assistant to this honourable action Samuel Sawbridge was enticed to which he sensibly nobly replied  "What take Mrs Longley's oranges  without paying  for them Miss Tucker teaches me my Catechism and that says "THOU SHALT NOT STEAL" and  she  tells me "that taking any thing from any body without paying for it  is stealing  so I won't go with you"  This gentleman not then quite seven years old all Canterbury rang with this tale Mrs Berkeley asked her little Robert if he thought he should have been as honest as his dear friend Samuel To which he made the following reply  "God knowsGod knows my dear Mamma if I had been tempted what  I might  have done THANK God THANK God they did not  ask  me"  and he shuddered as he energetically uttered the reply This lovely creature was to be sure wonderfully ambitious He repeatedly until told it was a wicked idea asked his mother  "Mamma if I was to read Greek and Latin all day and all night and study violently hard could I come to be a King I should  like  to be a King"  Such a thought never entered the head of his dear brother nor perhaps of any other child  "  For me who mindful of my absent friend  Have paid this mournful tribute to his end  It still appear'd some solace some relief  To tell how great HIS merits and MY grief  Thus the poor bird who mourns her plunder'd nest  With plaintive notes by fond concern oppress'd  Sounds through the wood sequester'd from the throng  And vents her grief in melody and song  CHARLES SAWKINS  One of the senior monitors of the King's School Canterbury now a most learned worthy student of Christ Church Oxon    King's School Canterbury  June  SEVERAL things of Mr Berkeley's writing having been noticed some quite ready for publication at the time of his decease the Editor feels it a sort of duty to mention a work  not  ready for the press not  even  written but constantly  talked  of by Mr Berkeley from the early age of fifteena work in defence of the CHRISTIAN RELIGION as taught in the purest Church on Earth the superexcellent CHURCH OF ENGLAND Dr Berkeley used now and then to say  "Well Berkeley when are we to see  your  defence of the Christian Religion"  Mr M Berkeley  "Why my dear Sir not yet although I never shall be quite happy until  I have  done it"  Dr B  "Why not then do it directly"  Mr B  "I will tell you my dear Sir I am resolved not to do it until I have if GOD spares my life established at least have endeavoured to establish  such  a character in  my own  profession the Law as shall induce  men of sense to read it with the attention that  I hope  it will merit"  Mr Monck Berkeley although he failed alas to keep the resolution formed when about eight years old  Coming into his Mother's dressingroom and seeing what her witty sister used to call  her Vesper Book  and when both young women used to threaten to tie round her neck and her bed around her waist because the Editor in general wished to retire to rest at eleven that is Dean Hickes's Reformed Devotions lying on her table took it up and twirling it over stumbled on the hymn in the Office for Sunday Vespers reading the lines  "How cross art thou  ie  the World mentioned two verses before  to that design  "For which we had our birth  "Us who are made in heav'n to shine  "Thou bow'st down to the earth  "Nay to thy hell for thither sink  "All that to thee submit  "Thou strew'st some flowers on the brink  "To drown us in the pit"  Mr Berkeley then just turned of eight years old as mentioned above exclaimed  "No no I promise you I won't stoop to pick them up  They shan't drown me  with their  fine flowers  One must be a fool  indeed  to do that"  ever  felt the necessity of Religion for all who hope to be happy here and hereafter a strong proof of which he gave the last time of his being at Bath He and his excellent unwearied friend Mr Grimston lodged and boarded at Mr Garret's  A  bon mot  of Mr Whitaker's cannot here be omitted Dr Berkeley c going one day to visit Dr Berkeley's relation the very worthy Colonel Butler at Thorpe on their arrival they found he had died three days before Mr Whitaker rode up to the carriage and enquiring how Mr Monck Berkeley did and where he was hearing that he was at Bath said  "I am going thither in two days where shall I find him"  Mrs Berkeley  "At Mr Garret's"  Mr Whitaker  "'Pshaw how could I be such a blockhead to aska POET is always in a GARRET"  Several gentlemen boarded who could not lodge at Mr Garret's Amongst these was the at Bath wellknown Captain Lawley  Soon after the arrival of Mr Grimston and Mr Berkeley this wretched Captain began to  instruct  the two young men in the  pleasing  doctrine of there being  no  God c c that the idea of Hell and its Prince was all a bugaboo to keep silly  women  in a little order Many arguments did these two young Christian men use with this wretched old Atheist but all alas in vain One day he was missed from dinner the second he appeared not On an enquiry being sent to his lodgings word was brought that he was very ill Mr Grimston and Mr Berkeley went to call on him and found him as his apothecary said very dangerously ill indeed with little hope of recovery Both were exceedingly shocked at his situation Mr Grimston earnestly requested Mr Berkeley to talk to him concerning his soul  Mr Berkeley  "Alas no my dear friend he NOW wants an abler counsellor than I am"  Mr Grimston  "What can we do for him"  Mr B  "We will go and request the favour of that gentleman  The Editor has forgotten the gentleman's name but thinks that it was Mr Jackson rector of St Jame's church  whose preaching we both so much admire to go him to talk to him and pray with him"  They immediately went to Mr Jackson who said to them  "Gentlemen out of respect to you as you seem so earnestly to wish it  I  will go but am consident I shall make no more impression on him than on this marble hearth on which I stand for he is the most  determined  Atheist the  greatest  ridiculer of every thing sacred that is any where to be found"  The young gentlemen however continued very desirous and the worthy Divine complied so each party  "  delivered their own soul  "  but lamentable thought the wretched Captain Lawley resolved to die as he had lived and meet Bugaboo  "Unhousel'd unanneal'd unanointed"  One day when the two gentlemen were visiting him during his illness he fixed his eyes earnestly in silence on Mr Berkeley and at length said  "Mr Berkeley I should be very glad of a pair of your old shoes Sir"  Mr Berkeley rather distressed said smiling  "My  old  shoes Captain Lawley I believe my servant would object to that but if a pair of my new ones will do as well I am sure there are a pair or two if you please very much at  your service"  He looked thoughtful and replied  "I think I should like  your  shoes"  Mr Grimston conceived that he meant it as is sometimes said  "I would not be in his shoes or his coat"  when any one is in a scrape  On opening the Captain's will at his death it appeared that he had during his very few days illness made a will in favour of a gentleman who a few days before it had caused the gentleman and the Editor thinks some ladies of character who boarded at Mr Garret's by their servants to prevent Captain Lawley from fighting this gentleman by contriving to prevent their meeting one evening He had by this  wonderful  will ruined two very near relations the Editor thinks nieces whom he had obliged to give up keeping a very good school for young ladies by allowing them handsomely and promising to leave them his fortune  Mr Monck Berkeley was so convinced that the Captain's intellects were deranged from the beginning of his illness that being about to leave Bath he left his address in writing with some proper person saying  "If the will was contested by the relations he was ready to give his evidence whenever called upon"  On the publication of the Captain's will the very worthy Sir Robert Lawley Baronet his cousingerman said  "It should be contested  entirely  at his expence on behalf of his worthy kinswomen and that himself would not come in for a shilling of the fortune"  Some months before Mr Monck Berkeley's death he received a letter from Doctors Commons requesting to know when it would be convenient to him to receive some gentlemen thence to take his depositions concerning Captain Lawley He appointed an early day and several gentlemen arrived one morning from Wood's at Maidenhead Bridge at Dr Berkeley's at Cookham stayed near two hours with Mr Monck Berkeley received his deposition and the Editor hopes some  very thick  good Vannilla chocolate sandwiches white wine and water c which she ordered to be sent in to them  Mr Berkeley requested if he lived until it was decided that he might be informed whether the will were established or not About a fortnight before his lamented death he received a letter from a gentleman of the Commons telling  him that the Court had rejected the will of Captain Lawley  It were much to be wished that the Ecclesiastical Court could sometimes act as a Court of EQUITY They would they should surely had they been applied to have set aside the will of a wretched old Fanatic of Hull who after having kept his dutiful amiable only son near nine years with an eminent Clergyman of the Church of England who takes private pupils sent him down to Scotland to the University of St Andrew's as he wrote to Dr Forrest one of the Professors  "that he might learn to preach the  everlasting Gospel  as a  Presbyterian  minister in England"  Mr Rogers was accordingly to his great distress entered of the Divinity Colledge The wonderful amiability of his nature and the sweetness of his manners rendered him universally beloved by persons of all ranks His zeal to succour and save and his generosity  when saved  to poor shipwrecked persons on the coast of St Andrew's used to occasion Mr Monck Berkeley's saying  "Well now Rogers  is  happy he is posting off to a wreck with three or four bottles and blankets innumerable He  has ordered beds to be ready for all the poor creatures that are escaped"  Mr Rogers attended divine service regularly at Dr Berkeley's every Sunday Several letters arrived from the father asking when his son would be FIT  to preach  in the  Meetinghouse  that  he  had  built  ready for him This diverted his friends but as the frogs in the fable say  "Although it is  sport to you  it is  death to us  "  Poor Mr Rogers extremely distressed applied as hundreds of others did to Dr Berkeley for advice and direction who told him  "that perhaps if his wish was to become a Divine of the Church of England he had better apply to his Father who as his grand desire seemed to be to  hear  his son  preach  and as he was very rich might buy the next presentation of a living with an aged incumbent on it"  The case was properly stated to the old man who soon returned for answer  "that having met with some  Baptists  who had agreed to give him a  very high  rent for his meetinghouse he had let it to them left the Presbyterians and become a  Baptist himself  and his son might be of the Church of England if he pleased"  Dr Berkeley with his wonted goodness applied to his old tutor the present Archbishop of York stating the case to his Grace and requesting him to ordain Mr Rogers on the testimonial of several of the respectable Professors at St Andrew's with regard to his life and conversation  The Editor supposes that the testimonial of the learned Dean Hill Professors Hunter Baron Cook c of Mr Rogers's learning life and conversation and Dr Berkeley's  own  knowledge of his holding  "no doctrine contrary to the Church of England as by law established"  induced his Grace to ordain the very worthy young man without a testimonial from Oxford Cambridge or Dublin Perhaps the Editor in this last sentence may be writing like a fool as she has not for many years heard a testimonial for orders redde If she has so done she is sorry for it The old man was so delighted that he set off in his postchaise and  four  for York to see his son ordained in that magnificent Cathedral He was quite transported and had  some  thoughts of becoming a member of the Church of England However that idea was  transient  and on his amiable son's going to settle at or near Hull this old  numpscull  insisted on his  preaching  at the  Baptist  meeting which Mr Rogers utterly refusing to do he cast him off married a young Baptist and entirely disinherited him and this throughly amiable man is now as the Editor hears from her beloved excellent friend Henry Grimston Esquire a distressed Curate at or near Beverley in Yorkshire The old wretch allowed him very handsomely during his residence at the University of St Andrew's or his bounties to the poor could not have been so extensive as all then resident there knew them to be but even then  "the  beast  shewed his nature"  His only daughter as Mr Rogers was his only son was married to Captain Lee the first officer as it was then said who ever sailed from England in a copperbottomed vessel  This gentleman was either dead or the ship and crew supposed to be lost or carried into slavery the Editor thinks the latter to have been the case And no entreaties could prevail on this vile old HODMADOD to tell his poor son in what part of the kingdom his sister with the Editor thinks four young children resided  The Editor one day asking her Son what could induce the wretch if he was in his senses to be such a BRUTE he  replied in his most sweetly plaintive voice when feeling the woes of other  "Alas my dear Mother he  is  in his senses but he  wants  the  sense  of  feeling  which he knows  his son  has in an eminent degree and he is afraid that Rogers should assist his I sadly fear distressed sister as it is so long since her husband has been heard of and Rogers knows her father  won't  relieve her  because  the  week  before she was with  his  consent to be married to Captain Lee he bade her  turn him off  and marry a young plump Presbyterian parson that he brought to her but she preferred Captain Lee and her  cunning  father took  that  opportunity to pocket the fortune he had promised to give to Captain Lee with her"  It is surely a defect in our laws although excellent in general that a vilely covetous or horridly capricious father or mother can at their  own  pleasure either beggar or damn perhaps both in one their own illfated offspring  Parents should have  all  power during youth  none  at all after children come to years of discretion and if they are  wise  or  just  if they have it let them renounce it as the Editor  always solemnly protested to Dr Berkeley that she would do he using to say when his children were young that he would leave them dependant on her for bread that they might be dutiful Mrs Berkeley assured him that much within a month after his decease she would put it out of her power to rob the children of a dead father that she would by God's blessing make them dutiful although they had an independance of ten thousand a year  The Editor was exceedingly delighted the first time she heard it and has diverted many persons since with the account given of herself by the late sensible agreeable Lady Grey of Denne Hill Kent mother of the late Sir James Grey many years his Majesty's Ambassador to the Court of Spain  The Editor has an old trick like her late excellent relation Sir Martin Wright of thinking aloud It is in her quite involuntary as she conceives it must have been in him When sitting on the  judgementseat  he would say loud enough to be heard by the barristers some of whom she has heard relate it to her mother  "WELL PUT Mr Hume Campbell  that  will do"  And again  "OH  LAMENTABLE LAMENTABLE Mr    that will  never  do never do at all  "  So the Editor the first visit she made at Denne Hill on entering the room where hung a magnificent wholelength portrait of the then King of Spain of whom Mr Clarke gives so curious an account as also of the lamentations of his amiable Queen when the sentence of death was pronounced to her not by  French devils  but by her wise pious Confessor the Editor's eyes being better then than now she caught Dr Berkeley entering just behind her by the arm exclaiming  "Ohlook do look at that man HE must be the uniting link in the chain between man and brute between man and devil"  This was quite involuntary Had she known it had been the MONSTER MONARCH who to try a new fowlingpiece took aim and killed a poor mason's labourer ascending a ladder in view the  prejugée  might have had share in her sentence To be sure according to the Editor's idea it is the most extraordinary countenance she ever saw  The witty worthy Lady Grey who became a widow before she was thirty and continued such until ninety when the oil all exhausted the lamp went gently out  used to say  "I don't know how it is that young widows marry so fast  I  could not contrive to do it To be sure  very soon  after Sir James's death I had a multitude of lovers from Lords and Commons I heard of nothing but my  beauty  and  wit  However as soon as I had a little dried my eyes for the death of poor Sir James I sent for a lawyer and settled the money about an hundred thousand pounds that he had left  entirely  in my power on his poor little orphans and whether it was that I grew ugly and foolish at  nine and twenty  or  what else  I know not but so it was  I  never heard a word more of my wit or beauty nor ever had a lover afterwards"  Her witty Ladyship had admirers if not lovers to the last of her long life on earth  A poor old doating rich Divine in the neighbourhood of Cloyne a widower with several children was going to marry a girl it reached the ears of Bishop Berkeley who immediately visited him and introducing the subject the old gentleman said  "that he should not have thought of it but that the  young Lady was so exceedingly in love with him  "  How much weaker is  second  childhood  "  sans eyes sans teeth  "  c c than the first The Bishop  said  "if that was the case the Lady would at any rate marry him"  He assented and the Bishop prevailed on him to settle his fortune on his children after his own death which so entirely cured the young lady's  violent passion  for him that he was suffered to go to his grave under the care of his worthy children the best guardians for aged persons when God vouchsafes to spare them  Dr Berkeley used sometimes to ask Mrs Berkeley  "what could induce her to marry who could well enough manage all her own business"  c Her uniform reply was  "That she might enjoy and improve by the conversation of a man of many men of superior understanding whilst she had sense enough left to enjoy it and to have some sensible worthy children to  love  and GOVERN her if she should which she  never  wished always dreaded yet never dared to pray against attain to old age"  The Editor used frequently to conjure her dear Son if she should attain to old age to govern  her  as carefully as she had governed  him  in his childhood  The Editor is just returned from her Parishchurch where it being December Saint Thomas's day she heard the proper lesson Proverbs xxiii one of her  guiding  chapters and where every reward promised to a watchful parent is recorded She humbly praised the mercy of God he had vouchsafed to permit her to experience in its  fullest  extent  But the Editor did not wish her Son to govern her  exactly  in the same mode in which she had governed him not looking up upon him for two days one of Mr Monck Berkeley's punishments from about seven to ten years old sitting on the same chair without moving for an houronce alas for full three hours by the carelessness of his mother One day before teatime he was ordered to sit on a  particular  One of Mr Monck Berkeley's punishments from three to eight years old In one room at his Father's ten chairs stood in one row His Mother used generally to point to the one at the upper end Mr Berkeley from three years and an half would regularly go to the lowest not out of  humility  but to use a  coined  word of the Editor WILFULLITY then to the next to which his  ever  STEADY Mother said  "  not that  "  Thus he constantly strove for victory  nine  times and after standing some time at the tenth  wriggled  himself upon it  chair in the Library His Mother called  into the Drawingroom to make tea left him before tea was quite over Dr Berkeley said  "It is a heavenly evening we will cross the water and walk to Cliefden Be quick My dear get your hat"  The Editor never when young made  any  one wait for  her  especially her Mother and her Lord and Master as she used  en badinant  to style Dr Berkeley called her maid got her hat c and skipped away thoughtless of her sweet little prisoner until she had crossed the Thames when she wished to have returned but Dr Berkeley said  "Oh he'll get off when he finds you gone out"  The Editor expressed her fear that he would not but she proceeded on her walk On her return she was met at the ferry by Mr Monck Berkeley's everkind friend John lest she should make any call in the village saying  "Will you be pleased Madam to go home that Master Berkeley may go to bed then nine o'clock he just seven years old for none of  us  can prevail upon him to stir off the chair where he says you  ordered  him to sit and not stir till  you  came to him We promised him you would not be angry but nothing would do and there he sits"  The Editor left Dr Berkeley and ran home the shortest way she could find through all the high dewbesprinkled grass to her obedient little man  When Mr Berkeley was about thirteen he one day said to his Mother  "I wish you would be so good as to write upon a sheet of paper these words GEORGEMONCK BERKELEY  is a very dutiful Son  "  Mrs Berkeley  "No indeed my dear I won't write any such thing"  Mr B  "I  wish  you would"  Mrs B  "No I cannot for I don't think it"  Mr B  "I am sorry you do not"  Mrs B  "So am I but you know how wilful you are"  Mr B  "Well but I always obey you  at last  "  Mrs B  "Yes but that is not being DUTYFUL"  Mr B  "Well but I am OBEDIENT then"  Mrs B  "Yes you certainly do  obey me  "  Mr B  "Well then you will be so good as to write  on this sheet of paper 'GEORGEMONCK BERKELEY  is an  OBEDIENT SON"  Mrs B  "Yes if it will oblige you"  Mr B  "Oh yes it will indeed"  The words were immediately written The sweet lad's eyes sparkled with joy when he redde them He carefully folded them up and walked away to his own room At dinner the curious dialogue was related to dear Dr Berkeley and the Editor never heard or thought of it more until examining the small trunk containing many of his precious deposits delivered into her hands by the faithful Mrs Leycester Mr Berkeley's bedmaker at Magdalen Hall mentioned before in this Preface This  testimonial  of her dear Son's obedience signed as requested with her name lay carefully folded  The Editor from a youth had always told Mr Berkeley that he was the  eldest Son  in the Gospel  "Son go work today in my vineyard cyet afterwards he repented and went"  Mr Berkeley used frequently to quote it on his Mother  Once when she requested him much to visit in town a very old friend of hers well known in the  ton  world but who did not happen to hit Mr Berkeley's fancy and he begged to be excused visiting the gentleman Mrs Berkeley replied  "Well my dear then let it alone"  He said  "My dear Mother I have a very large acquaintance in town and I cannot spend all my time in visiting That will not fit me for the Bar"  The morning that he was leaving the Oaks he crept to his Mother's bedside saying  "My dear Madam I will wait on  "  Mrs B  "Well my dear do not if it is disagreeable to you"  Mr B  "Yes I must I  ought  to have said I would do it on your first mentioning it to me but I  could not  You know you have always told me that I am the  eldest Son  the Gospel I cannot help it I wish I could"  Mrs B  "Indeed my dear child I am much happier that you are the  eldest  rather than the  younger  Son mentioned by our Blessed Master"  The Editor's request to her dear son to govern her in return for her having  so well  governed him recals to mind what he one day said at St Andrew's  Soon after his return from a visit in the Country to his beloved friend the universally beloved respected amiable Sir John Ramsay Advocate in Edinburgh whose early death at twentyeight Mr Berkeley never ceased to lament when speaking of that excellent young gentleman Mr Berkeley said  "I am certainly a very lucky fellow for let me go where I will I  always find  a mother At Cookham when my mother was not in company if I said or did any aukward ridiculous thing my dear Mrs M  s always  set me  torights or well tuned me for itand here in  Scotland  Lady Ramsay takes me in hand"  His great good sense like that of his dear friend Mr Grimston made him add  "I am sure I am much obliged to them"  Mr Grimston one day speaking of the son of a Yorkshire Baronet said  "he has had  great  advantages by being in the Militia because Mrs Masters the Editor thinks  was the name of the Colonel's Lady has taken to him and  tutored  him just as Mrs Berkeley does me and c c"  Mr Monck Berkeley used to tell his father that he heard some of his mother's friends say that in her youth  "She had a wonderful  knack  of making the young men  know  their distance and respect her and he was sure he was too polite to say now that she is  old  but now that she is not young she has a  blessed knack  of  tuning  the young men that visit here"  To  hich his Mother used to reply  "Well Sir and do not you often tell your Father that  and  and  love  your  Mother almost as well as you do"  Mr B  "Oh yes my dear Madam all the fellows of  good sense  like you wonderfully"  It is very  salutary  for young men to meet with oldladyadvisers as it is surely happy for young women if they are wise enough to profit by it to have a wise male adviser who has lived in the world who knows life as it is wiretermed A wise wife or father or a worthy some  yearsolder brother can tell a young lady  many  things that will render her pleasing or displeasing to the young men that a mother cannot and let young ladies  deny it ever so strongly  they all wish to be if not admired at least  not displeasing  in the opinion young men of  sense  A diverting dialogue might here be related which passed almost thirty years ago between the late excellent Lord Lyttelton the well known very sensible Miss Charlotte B  and the Editor on  this  subject when he exclaimed on the public walk at    "How I do  honour  Mrs Berkeley's honesty"  adding  "  I know  also that ALL the ladies in England  love  elegancies but I know but TWO that are  honest  enough to avow it Mrs Montagu and Mrs Berkeley"  The throughly elegant Mrs Montagu has ever had it in her power to gratify that innocent taste Mrs Berkeley only in taking care that dear Dr Berkeley's visitors got comfortable sort of dinners and clean nice sleeping rooms c all that persons of moderate fortune who are blessed with children to educate and provide for can justly aim at for elegancies when butcher baker c are  unpaid  become  sinful  vanities  But to return to the INCOMPARABLE Lady Ramsay as the late Lord Kinnoul styled her Ladyship when  speaking of her to the Editor who had not the honour to be known to her Ladyship His Lordship one day said  "I wish you  did  know her I do not think there is a cleverer woman upon the face of the whole earth"  Mr Monck Berkeley one day said  "When I was at  The name of Sir John's seat is not recollected by the Editor he being a Baronet of course was not called by it as all gentlemen of fortune  sine  title are in Scotland  we had been out shooting all the morning and after tea Lady Ramsay and her elegant young ladies being drawn round the table to work Sir John and Mr Berkeley on the sofa the former said softly 'Come let us lie heads and points and rest ourselves a little' Lady Ramsay soon perceiving their situation said "Mr Berkeley I have not the honour  Her Ladyship was as very sensible persons of rank generally are very condescending to speak thus  to know Mrs Berkeley but from what I have heard from many of her friends  I do not  think that she would quite approve of your present situation when there are  ladies  in the room Sir John are not you ashamed of yourself to lay your length on the sofa when your mother and sisters are in the room"  Mr Berkeley said  "I think I never felt  more  ashamed in my whole life  I sprang upon my feet in an instant begged her Ladyship ten thousand pardons thanked her a thousand times for her goodness and I assured her that my Mother would have  well tuned  me had she seen me guilty of such horrid inattention to ladies or to gentlemen my superiors or elders"  The Editor when Mr Berkeley was little more than a youth one day after dining out reproached him for not peeling as well as cracking the walnuts for the young lady by whom he sat at dinner adding  "that when  she  was a young woman and sat near gentlemen they always peeled them for her"  Mr Berkeley then but very young replied  "Oh my dear Mother thank Fate the girls in  these  days have  found  the  use  of their  fingers  I  always  crack them for them and I think  they may  very well  peel them  for themselves"  Mr Berkeley felt very sincerely for his highly respected friend Lady Ramsay the loss of two so amiable sons in the very prime of life He felt indeed for ALL in distress  "whether of  mind body  or  estate  "  a strong proof of which the Editor cannot forbear reciting here During his residence  in the University at St Andrew's Dr Berkeley dining in the country soon after dinner Mr Berkeley walked out and returning immediately flew into the eating room and exclaimed  "Best of Mothers how  can you  sit reading here as if nothing had happened"  The Editor sprang up saying  "Good God child has your Father been overturned"  Mr Berkeley  "  No I hope not  but a poor unhappy man's foot is just now torn off above his ancle by the mill"  Mrs B  "Well my dear child could I know that by inspiration"  Mr B  "No but pray do something for him They have sent for Flint  Dr Flint the very learned experienced almost always successful Professor of Physic in the University at St Andrew's  and Melville  Mr Melville a most excellent Surgeon  and they are both out of town"  Mrs B  "Well if he is bleeding violently I can send John with some Manchester styptic  This incomparable medicine when genuine not here called by its right name which is Hatfield's styptic once saved Mr Monck Berkeley's life when a child when nearly all the blood in his veins was exhausted and nothing could staunch the bleeding The moment this was applied it ceased but that was genuine prepared by and procured from the honest wife of the Manchester baker to whom a famous French surgeon in gratitude for her goodness in nursing him through a very long illness communicated the secret For years it was sold only in Manchester Happy for the public had it continued as well as some other famous Patent Medicines in honest hands The Editor means if God spares her life to give in the Gentleman's Magazine some account of the almost miraculous cures wrought by this astonishingly fine medicine as many medical gentlemen high in their profession have declared it to be when they have by their  eloquence  prevailed on the Editor to let them taste itshe not exhibiting to the  Faculty  left they should maliciously laugh as she tells them and call her  "  Lady Bountiful  "  Alas she cannot now get it from Mr Hatfield the baker's daughter at Manchester There is a poor wretched thing called  "Hatfield's styptic"  sold by the man who obliged happily for the public Messrs Hoopers to take into their own hands again the preparing their father Dr Hooper's excellent pills These pills genuine cured a respectable old servant of the Editor's of seven large wounds in one leg not that ALL Patent Medicines prepared by the Proprietors  if  they happen to be covetous are genuine as the Editor's poor weakened stomach lamentably feels and pretty certainly will feel as long as she continues an inhabitant of this sublunary world She hopes and believes that her private admonition has on his  own  account wrought reformation on the Medicine if not on Preparer Respect for the very worthy vender keeps the name of the said adulterated medicine from being published as she verily believes it is since her visit in  properly preparedif not from  principle  yet from POLICY  "  Mr B  "No it does not bleed a drop but send John with a bottle of wine and some money to comfort the  poor creature for God's sake I have given him something but do you send him more"  Mr Melville soon arrived the poor man did well and perhaps is now living blessing with many others in St Andrew's Mr Monck Berkeley's lovely charity The poor man was warned not five minutes before by a woman of the mill to be aware of the rope that tore off his foot but warning alas does not  always  avail The neglecting it must add weight to calamity  The loss of this poor man's foot recalls to the Editor's mind the preservation of the leg of a relation of hers S Cherry Esquire a cousingerman of Mr Cherry who served in all Queen Anne's wars under the great Duke of Marlborough when besieging  the Editor forgets what place One day eight or ten officers sat down to dinner in a sawpit they agreed to make a table by every man laying his right leg across the pit instead of dropping both into it On beginning their dinner they wanted salt or mustard one said go you another go you to the sutlers at length Captain Cherry jumped up saying  "I will go"  At his return he found that every officer  had lost a leg a chain ball had been fired from the battery and had quite taken off the leg of some and so shattered those of the others that the surgeon was obliged to amputate them Poor men they all lived and went halting to the  "house appointed for all living"  on one leg as the Editor has frequently heard her unmaimed rèlation say at fourscore he had not lost one of as fine a set of teeth as ever were seen as white as at twenty years oldhis eyesight almost equally good The Editor has often heard him and Colonel  a relation of her mother relate a very curious transaction that happened between the Duke of Marlborough and his AiddeCamp Lord Cadogan father of the late Duchess of Richmond that does honour to both noblemen  The Editor regrets always did regret that she is of a  terribly  longlived family on both sides It is however some pleasure to her to think that her Father and Mother both died much younger than she now is but alas those two excellent Christians were  quite ripe  for GLORY before they went to enjoy it She never could quite subscribe to that beautiful simile in Dean Hickes's "Reformed Devotions" in one of the Psalms of the Prpa ratory  Office for Death used every Thursday by the Editor since her age of seventeen  "No matter how late the fruit be gathered if it still go on in growing better  "No matter how soon it fall from the tree if not blown down before it be ripe"  To the latter verse she heartily subscribes although to the former verse  not quite  it is only THY WILL be it done  in  me  on  me and  by  me that ALONE reconciles her to the  unpleasantnesses  of OLD AGE  VERSES by the Pious MR NORRIS of  Bemerton  Altered by the equallypious betterinformed MRS CATHARINE TALBOT of  Lambeth Palace  Several gentlemen one day at Lambeth Palace some Divines amongst them were admiring these verses of the pious learned Mr Norris Miss Talbot ever chearful evèr delighting to look forward with joy to  that  world where she through faith well knew that happiness  was  to be found which she  too  well knew  was not  to be found here said  "I never could bear that Poem of Norris's"  Several with one voice exclaimed  "Who could have written a finer on  that  subject"  She laughing replied  "Any one"  Some one said  "I wish you would then"  "Well go get me the book and a pen and I will at least if not make a better mend that"  which she immediately certainly did as above This is copied from the altered one in the handwriting of that loveliest of women That entirely beloved friend who gave it to the Editor the next day by whom it has been carefully preserved for more than thirty years she Miss Talbot saying  "I cannot bear to hear persons who I really think believe in the allsufficiency of Christ admire such stuff as  "Death could not a more  sad  retinue find  "Sickness and Pain before  Darkness  behind"  Poets sometimes take  strange  flights Good Mr Norris in one of his Poems shocked the Editor when she was a very young woman hardly a womansaying in his Poem on the death of some young Norfolk lady  "that Heaven wanted the presence of her I think Mrs Margaret Pastarn's spirit to make it a place of  complete  happiness"  She flew to her Mother to enquire if it was not BLASPHEMY Were Mrs Frinsham still on earth the Editor would not trouble her concerning those lines she thinking of them just as she did at fifteen She blesses GOD that no  such  flights are to be found in Mr Monck Berkeley's Poems The Editor cannot omit mentioning here two short conversations held with her Son at the distance of almost ten years When a  very  young man he shewed to his Mother some charming verses that he had written to a friend on the death of a  very near  and dear relation His Mother said  "You seem to offer all your consolation from Heathen Philosophers"  He replied  "Best of Mothers what could I do Would you have had me offered it from the Bible to a man  that you  know does not believe that blessed Book"  The second near ten years afterMrs Berkeley said  "My dear I dare say although  I  am no judge that the lines are very fine but there is not a  tittle  said of the  only  thing that could console  you  were the Almighty to deprive you of your poor Motherthat she was gone to Christ"  Mr Berkeley looked sweetly sad and replied  "Oh best of Mothers  But I could  not offer THAT consolation concerning one who I have alas  too good  reason to fear  did not  believe  in  CHRISTSurely SUCH  can never go to  HIM I have said all that my  conscience  would suffer me to say to soothe a  little  the anguish of their spirits on the loss of an  agreeable  Mother"  Christ says  "Except ye believe that I AM ye shall die in your sins"  What a threat to SOCINIANS and to the ARIANS Lord Monboddo in his "Ancient Metaphysics" says  "The ARIAN HERESY was the  subtlest  that ever infected the Christian Church"  Many years ago a gentleman on a visit at Dr Berkeley's at Cookham said that in his way through London on the preceding Sunday resting on the Sabbathday he had heard the following sentence uttered from the pulpit by a very learned Divine preaching on the abovecited words of our adored Redeemer  "If ye believe not that I AM"  c  "If JESUS CHRIST be not GOD perfectly equal with the Father I had  rather trust  to the BLOOD of a DOG for my Salvation than to that of CHRIST who if not  absolutely equal  with the Father  is  an IMPOSTOR"  Some one said  "That is very  strong  language"  Dr Berkeley replied  "But it is certainly right or true"  the Editor forgets which word he used Whatever ARIAN can be happy enough to lay eyes on the  wonderful  work of the late very deeply learned Reverend Meredith Jones many years Chaplain to the present venerable Lord Bishop of Chichester  "must be convinced"  The Editor has one which she lends out for one week only if not returned she threatens the borrower with an  action of trover    IT must be done my Soul But though a strange  'Tis sure a most delightful change  When thou must leave this Tenement of Clay  And through the Fields of Ether wing thy way  When Time shall be Eternity and thou  Shalt live where dwell thy pious Friends where dwells thy Saviour now  Amazing thought that we should ever dread  To think of Death or view the dead  Not now wrapp'd up in clouds but Faith to thee  A Land of Light and Certainty  Death could not a more blest Retinue find  Patience and Faith before and glorious Hope behind  When Life's close knot by GOD's supreme decree  Disease shall cut or Age set free  The  Christian  firm amid the awful strife  Stands calm though trembling on the verge of Life  And from distracting Doubts serenely free  HIM whom in TIME he lov'd trusts for ETERNITY  So when the spacious Globe was cover'd o'er  And highest mountains were no more  Safe in the Ark the righteous Noah stood  Till borne triumphant o'er the boundless flood  He reach'd the Haven where he wish'd to be  And hail'd a fair new World from Sin and Sorrow free  FINIS
