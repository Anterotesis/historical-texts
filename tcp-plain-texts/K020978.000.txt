Rope that tries at all  In each unpractis'd Caper risques a Fall  I own I dread his ticklish Situation  Critics detest Poetic Innovation  Had  Ic'rus  been content with solid Ground  The giddy vent'rous Youth had ne'er been drown'd  The  Pegasus  of old had Fire and Force  But your true Modern is a Carrier's Horse  Drawn by the foremost Bell afraid to stray  Bard following Bard jogs on the beaten Way  Why is this Man so obstinate an Elf  Wall he alone not imitate himself  His Scene now shews the Heroes of old  Greece    But how 'tis monstrous In a Comic Piece  To Buskins Plumes and Helmets what Pretence  If mighty Chiefs must speak but common Sense  Shall no bold Diction no Poetic Rage  Fome at our Mouths and thunder on the Stage  No 'tis  Achilles  as he came from  Chiron    Just taught to sing as well as wield cold Iron  And whatsoever Criticks may suppose  Our Author holds that what He spoke was Prose  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Lycomedes  MR  Quin  Diphilus  Mr  Aston

Child I must insist upon your Promise that you will never discover yourself without my Leave Don't look upon it as capricious Fondness nor think because 'tis a Mother's Advice that in Duty to yourself you are oblig'd not to follow it  Ach  But my Character my Honour Wou'd you have your Son live with InfamyOn the first Step of a young Fellow depends his Character for LifeI beg you Goddess to dispense with your Commands  Thet  Have you then no Regard to my Presentiment I can't bear the Thoughts of your going for I know that odious Siege of  Troy  wou'd be the Death of thee  Ach  Because you have the natural Fears of a Mother wou'd you have me insensible that I have the Heart of a Man The World Madam must look upon my absconding in this Manner and at this particular Juncture as infamous Cowardise  AIR I A Clown in  Flanders  once there was  What's Life No Curse is more severe  Than bearing Life with Shame  Is this your Fondness this your Care  O give me Death with Fame  Thet  Keep your Temper  Achilles  'Tis both impious and undutiful to call my Prescience in question  Ach  Pardon me Goddess for had you like other Mothers been a meer Woman only I shou'd have taken the Liberty of other Sons and shou'd as 'tis my Duty have heard your Advice and follow'd my own  Thet  I positively shall not be easy Child unless you give me your Word and HonourYou know my Commands  Ach  My Word Madam I can give you but my Honour is already sacrific'd to my Duty That I gave you when I submitted to put on this Womans Habit  Thet  Believe me  Achilles  I have a tender Regard for your Honour as well as LifeBy preventing your running headlong to your Destiny I preserve you for future Glory Therefore Child I once more insist upon your solemn Promise  Ach  Was I a Woman as I appear to be I cou'd without Difficulty give you a Promise to have the Pleasure of breaking it but when I promise my Life is pledg'd for the Performance Your Commands Madam are sacredYet I intreat you Goddess to consider the ignominious Part you make me actIn obeying you I prove my self unworthy of you  Thet  My Will  Achilles  is not to be controverted Your Life depends upon your Duty and positively Child you shall not go to this Siege  AIR II  Gudgeon  's Song  Why thus am I held at Defiance  A Mother a Goddess obey  Will Men never practise Compliance  Till Marriage hath taught 'em the Way  Ach  But why must I lead the Life of a Woman Why was I stolen away from my Preceptor Was I not as safe under the Care of  Chiron  I know the Love he had for me I feel his Concern and I dare swear that good Creature is now so distress'd for the Loss of me that he will quite founder himself with galloping from Place to Place to look after me  Thet  I'll hear no more Obey and seek to know no further Can you imagine that I wou'd have taken all this Trouble to have lodg'd you under the Protection of  Lycomedes  if I had not seen the absolute Necessity of it  Ach  Were I allow'd to follow my Inclinations what wou'd you have to fearI shou'd do my Duty and die with Honour Was I to live an Age I cou'd do no more  Thet  You are so very obstinate that really Child there's no enduring youYour Impatience seems to forget that I am a Goddess Have I not degraded my self into the Character of a distress'd  Grecian  Princess 'Tis owing to my Artifice and Insinuation that we have the Protection of the King of  Scyros  Have I not won  Lycomedes  his Friendship and Hospitality to that degree as to place you without the least Suspicion among his DaughtersAnd for what dear  Achilles  Your Safety and future Fame requir'd it  Ach  'Tis impossible Madam to bear it much longer My Words my Actions my aukward Behaviour must one Day inevitably discover meI had been safer under the Tuition of  Chiron  Thet  Hath not the Prophet  Calchas  persuaded the Confederates that the Success of their Expedition against  Troy  depends  upon your being among 'em Have they not Emissaries and Spies almost every where in search of you 'Tis here only and in this Disguise that I can believe you out of the Reach of SuspicionYou have so much Youth and such a Bloom that there is no Man alive but must take you for a Woman What I am most afraid of is that when you are among the Ladies you shou'd be so little Master of your Passions as to find your self a Man  AIR III Did you ever hear of a galant Sailor  Ach  The Woman always in Temptation  Must do what Nature bids her do  Our Hearts feel equal Palpitation  For we've unguarded Minutes too  By Nature greedy  When lank and needy  Within your Fold the Wolf confine  Then bid the Glutton  Not think of Mutton  Can you persuade him not to dine  Thet  Now dear Child let me beg you to be discreetI have some SeaAffairs that require my Attendance which much against my Will oblige me for a time to leave you to your own Conduct  SCENE II  Thetis Achilles Artemona  Art  The Princesses Lady  Pyrrha  have been sitting at their Embroidery above a Quarter of an Hour and are perfectly miserable for want of you  Thet  Pyrrha  is so very unhandy and so monstrously aukward at her Needle that I know she must be diverting Her Passion for Romances as you must have observ'd in other Girls took her off from every Part of useful Education  Ach  For the many Obligations I have to the Princesses I should no doubt upon all Occasions shew my self ready to be the But of their Ridicule'Tis a Duty that all great People expect from what they call their Dependants  Art  How can you Lady  Pyrrha  misinterpret a Civility I know they have a Friendship an Esteem for you and have a Pleasure in instructing you  Thet  For Heaven's sake  Pyrrha  let not your captious Temper run away with your Goodmanners You cannot but be sensible of the King's and their Civilities both to you and me How can you be so horridly out of Humour  Ach  All I mean Madam is that when People are sensible of their own Defects they are not the proper Objects of Ridicule  Thet  You are so very touchy  Pyrrha  that there is no enduring youHow can you be so unsociable a Creature as to deny a Friend the Liberty of laughing at your little Follies and Indiscretions For what do you think Women keep Company with one another  Ach  Because they hate one another despise one another and seek to have the Pleasure of seeing and exposing one another's Faults and Follies  Thet  Now dear  Pyrrha  tell me is Work a thing you pique yourself upon Suppose too they shou'd smile at an Absurdity in your Dress it cou'd not be such a Mortification as if like most Women you had made it the chief Business of your Life  Art  Don't they treat one another with equal Familiarity  Ach  But a Reply from me whatever was the Provocation might be look'd upon as impertinent I hate to be under the Restraint of Civility when I am illus'd  Art  Will you allow me Madam to make your Excuses to the PrincessesThe Occasion of your Highness's leaving her I see troubles herPerhaps I may interrupt Conversation  Thet  'Tis astonishing Child how you can have so little Complaisance This sullen Behaviour of yours must be disagreeable I hope Madam she is not always in this way  Art  Never was any Creature more entertaining Such Spirits and so much Vivacity The Princesses are really fond of her to DistractionThe most chearful Tempers are liable to the Spleen and 'tis an Indulgence that one Woman owes to another  Ach  The Spleen Madam is a Female Frailty that I have no Pretensions to nor any of its Affections  AIR IV Si vous vous moquez de nous  When a Woman sullen sits  And wants Breath to conquer Reason  Always these affected Fits  Are in Season  Since 'tis in her Disposition  Make her be her own Physician  Nay dear Madam you shall not go without meThough I have my particular Reasons to be out of Humour I cannot be deficient in Goodmanners  Art  I know they would take it mortally ill if they thought your Complaisance had put yourself under the least Restraint  Ach  I can't forgive myself for my BehaviourYou must excuse me Madam for Absence in Conversation is an Incivility that I am but too liable to  Art  You know we all rally you upon your being in Love as that is one of its most infallible Symptoms  Thet  I charge you upon my Blessingas you expect Fame Glory Immortality obey me  To  Achilles    Thetis  kisses him Exeunt  Achilles  and  Artemona    SCENE III  Thetis  As for his Face his Air his Figure I am not under the least Apprehension all my Concern is from the Impetuosity of his TemperYet after all why  shou'd  I fear a Discovery for Women have the same Passions though they employ 'em upon different Objects  AIR V A Minuet  Man's so touchy a Word that's injurious  Wakes his Honour he's sudden as Fire  Woman kindles and is no less furious  For her Trifles or any Desire  Man is  sty  Or sour or resty  If balk'd of Honours or Pow'r or Pelf  Woman's Passions can no less molest ye  And all for Reasons she keeps to her self  He is sudden he is impatient What then Are Women less so Ask almost all Servants what they know of their Mistresses He is wilful testy and untractable Can't  Thousands of Husbands say as much of their Wives Then as for his Obstinacythat can never shew him less a Woman But he hath not that Command of his Tongue I cou'd wish him He is too vehement too severe in his Expressions In this Particular indeed few Women take equal Liberties to one another's Faces but they make ample Amends for it behind each other's Backs so that with all these Infirmities of Man he may with the least Conduct very well pass for a finespirited Woman This Reflexion hath cur'd my Anxiety and will make me believe him secure  SCENE IV  Thetis Lycomedes  Thet  'Tis with the utmost Gratitude that I return your Majesty Thanks for the Honours and hospitable Favours shewn to me and my Daughter  Lycom  You wou'd oblige me more Madam if your Affairs wou'd allow you to accept 'em longer  Thet  I have presum'd Sir to trespass further on your Generosity in leaving my Daughter under your ProtectionI hope  Pyrrha  's Behaviour will deserve it  AIR VI To you my Dear and to no other  Must then alas the fondest Mother  Desert her Child  Lycom  Ah why this Tear  She'll in  Theaspe  find another  In me paternal Love and Care  Had you taken her with you my Daughters wou'd have  been miserable beyond Expression Theirs and her Education shall be the same  Thet  I beg you Sir not to regard my Gratitude like the common Obligations of Princes for neither Time nor Interest can ever cancel it  Lycom  Affairs of Consequence may require your Presence Importunity upon these Occasions is troublesome and unhospitable I ask no Questions Madam because I choose not to pry into Secrets  Thet  I can only thank and rely upon your Majesty's Goodness My Duty to the Queen Sir calls me hence to own my Obligations and receive her Commands  SCENE V  Lycomedes Diphilus  Lyc  The Princess  Calista  hath taken her Leave she is but just gone out of the Room  Diph  That  Pyrrha  Sir was a most delicious Piece  Lycom  With all her little vixen Humours to my Taste she is infinitely agreeable  Diph  Your parting with her Sir in this easy manner is astonishing One too so excessively fond of you  Lycom  Parting with her  Diphilus  Diph  But no Prince alive hath so great a Command of his Passions  Lycom  Dear  Diphilus  let me understand you  Diph  To my Knowledge you might have had her  Lycom  Can I believe thee  Diph  I really thought the Queen began to be a little uneasy and for the Quiet of the Family since she is gone I must own I am heartily glad of it  AIR VII  John  went suiting unto  Joan    How your Patience had been try'd  Had this haughty Dame comply'd  What's a Mistress and a Wife  Joy for Moments Plague for Life  Lycom  I am not so unhappy  Diphilus  Her Mother hath left her to my Care  Diph  Just as I wish'd  Lycom  Wou'd she had taken her with her  Diph  It might have been better For beyond dispute Sir both you and the Queen wou'd have been easier  Lycom  Why did she trust her to me  Diph  There cou'd be but one Reason  Lycom  I cannot answer for myself  Diph  'Twas upon that very Presumption you was trusted  Lycom  Wou'd I could believe thee  Diph  'Tis an apparent manifest Scheme Sir and you wou'd disappoint both Mother and Daughter if your Majesty did not betray your TrustYou love her Sir you say  Lycom  To Distraction  Diphilus  Diph  And was the betraying a Trust ever as yet an Obstacle to that Passion What wou'd you have a Mother do more upon such an Occasion Ladies of her Rank cannot transact an Affair of this kind but with some  Decorum  Lycom  But you can never suppose  Pyrrha  knows any thing of the Matter  Diph  Why not Sir  Lycom  From me she cannot for I have never as yet made any downright Professions  Diph  There lies the true Cause of her Thoughtfulness 'tis nothing but Anxiety for fear her Scheme shou'd not take place for no doubt her Mother hath instructed her not to be too forward to make you more soBelieve me Sir you will have  no Difficulties in this Affair but those little ones that every Woman knows how to practise to quicken a Lover  Lycom  Be it as it will  Diphilus  I must have her  Diph  Had I been acquainted with your Pleasure sooner your Majesty by this time had been tir'd of herHow happy shall I make her if I may have the Honour of your Majesty's Commands to hint your Passion to her  Lycom  Never did Eyes receive a Passion with such Coldness such Indifference  AIR VIII Groom's Complaint  Whene'er my Looks have spoke Desire  I sigh'd I gaz'd in vain  No Glance confess'd her secret Fire  And Eyes the Heart explain  Diph  Though 'tis what she wishes what she longs for what she sighs for Respect and Awe are a Restraint upon her Eyes as well as Tongue I have often told you Sir she dares not understand you she dares not believe herself so happy  Lycom  This Ring  Diphilus  I must leave the rest to your Discretion  Diph  There may be a manner in giving it her a little Hint or sobut the Present will speak for itself 'tis the most successful Advocate of Love and never wants an Interpreter  Lycom  Say every thing for me  Diphilus  for I feel I cannot speak for myself  Diph  Cou'd I be as successful in all my other Negotiations Yet there may be Difficulties for if I mistake not the Lady hath something of the Coquette about her and what SelfDenial will not those Creatures suffer to give a Lover Anxiety  AIR IX O'er Bogie  Observe the wanton Kitten's Play  Whene'er a Mouse appears  You there the true Coquette survey  In all her flirting Airs  Now pawing  Now clawing  Now in fond Embrace  Till 'midst her Freaks  He from her breaks  Steals off and bilks the Chase  Lycom  Dear  Diphilus  what do you mean I never saw a Woman so little of that Character  Diph  Pardon me Sir your Situation is such that you can never see what Mankind really are In your Presence every one is acting a Part no one is himself and was it not for the Eyes and Tongues of your faithful Servants how little wou'd your Subjects be known to you Though she is so prim and  reserv'd before you she is never at a Loss for Airs to draw all the young flirting Lords of the Court about her  Lycom  Beauty must always have its Followers  Diph  If I mistake not General  Ajax  too who is sent to solicit your Quota for the  Trojan  War hath another Solicitation more at heartBut suppose she had ten thousand Lovers a Woman's prevalent Passion is Ambition which must answer your EndsThe Queen is coming this way and her Commands may detain meI go Sir to make  Pyrrha  the happiest Creature upon Earth  SCENE VI  Lycomedes Theaspe  Theas  I think the Princess  Calista  might as well have taken her Daughter with herThat Girl is so intolerably forward that I cannot imagine such Conversation can possibly be of any great Advantage to your Daughter's Education  Lycom  You seem of late to have taken an Aversion to the Girl She hath Spirit and Vivacity but not more than is becoming the Sex and I never saw any thing in her Behaviour but what was extremely modest  Theas  For Heaven's sake Sir allow me to believe my own Eyes Her Forwardness must give the Fellows some Encouragement or there wou'd not be that intolerable Flutter about herBut perhaps she hath some Reasons to be more upon her Guard before you  Lycom  How can you be so unreasonably censorious  Theas  I can see her Faults Sir I see her as a Woman sees a Woman The Men it seems think the aukward Creature handsome  AIR X  Dutch  Skipper First Part  Lycom  When a Woman's censorious  And attacks the meritorious  In the Scandal she shews her own malicious Thought  If real Guilt she blames  Then Pride her Heart inflames  And she fansies she's better for another's Fault  Thus seeking to disclose  The Slips of Friends and Foes  By her Envy she does herself alone expose  Nay dear Child your attacking her in this peevish way can be nothing but downright Antipathy  Theas  Nay dear Sir your defending her in this feeling manner can be nothing but downright Partiality  Lycom  I own my self partial to Distress and I see her in that Circumstance  Theas  But there are other Reasons that may make a Man partial  AIR XI  Dutch  Skipper Second Part  As you Sir are my Husband no doubt you're prone  To turn each new Face  To a Wife's Disgrace  And for no other Cause but that she's your own  Nay Sir 'tis an evident Case  'Tis strange that all Husbands should prove so blind  That a Wife's real Merits they ne'er can find  Tho' they strike all the rest of Mankind  Lycom  How can you be so ridiculous By these Airs Madam you would have me believe you are jealous  Thes  Whence had you this contemptible Opinion of me Jealous If I was so I have a Spirit above owning it I wou'd never heighten your Pleasure by letting you have the Satisfaction of knowing I was uneasy  Lycom  Let me beg you my Dear to keep your Temper  Theas  Since I have been so unguarded as to own it give me leave to tell you Sir that was I of a lower Rank it wou'd keep you in some Awe because you wou'd then know I cou'd take my Revenge  Lycom  You forget your Duty Child  Theas  There is a Duty too due from a Husband  Lycom  How can you give way to these Passions  Theas  Because you give way to yours  Lycom  But to be so unreasonably jealous  Theas  Unreasonably Wou'd it were so  AIR XII Black Joke  Lycom  Then must I bear eternal Strife  Both Night and Day put in mind of a Wife  By her Pouts Spleen and passionate Airs  Theas  D'ye think I'll bear eternal Slight  And not complain when I'm robb'd of my Right  Call you this Sir but whimsical Fears  Lycom  Can nought then still this raging Storm  Theas  Yes What you promis'd if you wou'd perform  Lycom  Pr'ythee teaze me no more  Theas  I can never give o'er  Till I find you as fond and as kind as before  Lycom  Will you ne'er ask  A possible Task  Wou'd you have me so unhospitable as to deny her my Protection  Theas  'Tis not Sir that I presume to controul you in your PleasuresYet you might methinks have shew'd that Tenderness for me to have acted with a little more Reserve Women are not so blind as Husbands imagineWere there no other Circumstancesyour Coolness to me your Indifference How I despise my self for this ConfessionPardon me Sir Love made me thus indiscreet  AIR XIII Ye Shepherds and Nymphs  Theaspe  weeping  O  Love  plead my Pardon nor plead it in vain  'Twas you that was jealous 'twas you was in Pain  Yet why should you speak To what Purpose or End  I must be unhappy if Love can offend  Yet was ever a Design of this kind so manifest so barefac'd  AIR XIV The Goddesses  Theaspe  angry  To what a Pitch is Man profuse  And all for ostentatious Pride  Ev'n Misses are not kept for Use  But for mere Show and nought beside  For might a Wife speak out  She cou'd prove beyond all doubt  With more than enough he was supply'd  The Princess  Calista  hath shewn an uncommon Confidence in your Majesty The Woman no doubt depends upon it that her Daughter's Charms are not to be resisted  Lycom  Nay dear Child don't be scandalous  AIR XV  Joan  's Placket  Reputations back'd and hew'd  Can never be mended again  Yet nothing stints the tattling Prude  Who joys in another's Pain  Thus while she rends  Both Foes and Friends  By both she's torn in twain  Reputations hack'd and hew'd  Can never be mended again  Theas  You are in so particular a manner oblig'd to her that I am not surpris'd at your taking her Part  Lycom  But dear Madam why at present is all this violent Fluster  Theas  Ask your own Heart ask your own Conduct Those can best inform you'Twou'd have been more obliging if  Pyrrha  and you had kept me out of this impudent Secret You know Sir I have Reason  Lycom  If one Woman's Virtue depended upon another's Suspicions where shou'd we find a Woman of common Modesty Indeed Child I think you injure her I believe her virtuous  Theas  When a Man hath ruin'd a Woman he thinks himself oblig'd in Honour to stand up for her Reputation  Lycom  If you will believe only your own unaccountable Suspicions and are determin'd not to hear Reason I must leave you to your perverse HumoursWhat wou'd you have me say What wou'd you have me do  Theas  Shew your Hospitality as you call it to me and put that Creature out of the Palace  Lycom  I have a greater Regard to yours and my own Quiet than ever to comply with the extravagant Passions of a jealous Woman  Theas  You have taken then your Resolutions I find and I am sentenc'd to NeglectDid ever a Woman marry but with the Probability of having at least one Man in her Power What a wretched Wife am I  Weeps  Lycom  Jealousy from a Wife even to a Man of Quality is now look'd upon as Illmanners though the Affair be never so publickBut without a CauseI beg you Madam to say no more upon this Subject  Theas  Though you Sir may think her fit Company for you methinks the very same Reasons might tell you that she is not so very reputable a Companion for your Daughters  Lycom  Since a passionate Woman will only believe herself I must leave you Madam to enjoy your Obstinacy I know but that way of putting an end to the Dispute  AIR XVI We've cheated the Parson  c  Though Woman's glib Tongue when her Passions are fir'd  Eternally go a Man's Ear can be tir'd  Since Woman will have both her Word and her Way  I yield to your Tongue but my Reason obey  I obey  Nothing say  Since Woman will have both her Word and her Way  SCENE VII  Theaspe  Theas  Wou'd I had been more upon the Reserve But Husbands are horridly provoking they know the Frailty of the Sex and never fail to take the Advantage of our Passions to make us expose our selves by Contradiction  Artemona  SCENE VIII  Theaspe Artemona  Art  Madam  Theas  Is that Creature that what do you call her that Princess gone  Art  Yes Madam  Theas  Why did not she take that awkward Thing her Daughter with her  Art  The Advantages she mighr receive in her Education might be an Inducement to leave her  Theas  Might  that  be an Inducement  Art  Besides in her present Circumstance it might be inconvenient to take her Daughter with her  Theas  Can't you find out any  other  Reason for leaving her  Art  Your Courtesy Madam your Hospitality  Theas  No  other  Reason  Art  No other Reason  Theas  Wou'd I cou'd believe there was no other  Art  'Tis not for me to pry into your Majesty's Secrets  Theas  I hate a Girl that is so intolerably forward  Art  I never observ'd any thing but those little Liberties that Girls of her Age will take when they are among themselves Perhaps those particular Distinctions the Princesses shew her may have made her too familiarI am not Madam an Advocate for her Behaviour  Theas  A Look so very audacious Now the filthy Men who love every thing that is impudent call that Spirit But there are  Artemona  some particular Distinctions from a certain Person who of late hath been very particular to me that might  indeed  make her too familiar  Art  Heaven forbid  Theas  How precarious is the Happiness of a Wife when it is in the Power of every new Face to destroy itNow dear  Artemona  tell me sincerely don't you from what you yourself have observed think I have Reason to be uneasy  Art  That I have observ'd  Theas  Dear  Artemona  don't frighten thyselfI am not accusing you but talking to you as a Friend  AIR XVII Fairy Elves  Art  O guard your Hours from Care  Of Jealousy beware  For she with fancy'd Sprites  Herself torments and frights  Thus she frets and pines and grieves  Raising Fears that she believes  Theas  I hate myself too for having so much Condescension and Humility as to be jealous 'Tis flattering the Man that uses one ill and 'tis wanting the natural Pride that belongs to the Sex What a wretched mean contemptible Figure is a jealous Woman How have I expos'd myself  Art  Your Majesty is safe in the Confidence repos'd in me  Theas  That is not the Case  Artemona Lycomedes  knows I am unhappy I have own'd it and was so unguarded as to accuse him  Art  Upon mere Suspicion only  Theas  Beyond Dispute he loves her I know it  Artemona  and can one imagine that Girl hath Virtue enough to withstand such a Proposal  AIR XVIII  Moll Peatly  All Hearts are a little frail  When Temptation is rightly apply'd  What can Shame or Fear avail  When we sooth both Ambition and Pride  All Women have Power in view  Then there's Pleasure to tempt her too  Such a sure Attack there's no defying  No denying  Since complying  Gives her another's Due  I can't indeed if you mean that positively affirm that he hath yet had her  Art  Then it may be still only Suspicion  Theas  I have trusted too my Daughter  Deidamia  with my Weakness that she by her Intimacies and Friendship with  Pyrrha  may get into her Secrets In short I have plac'd her as my Spy about herThat Girl out of Goodnature and to prevent Familydisputes may deceive me She insists upon it that I have nothing to fear from  Pyrrha  and is so positive in this Opinion that she offers to be answerable for her Conduct  Art  Why then Madam will you still believe your own Jealousies  Theas  All I say is that  Deidamia  may deceive me for whatever is in the Affair 'tis impossible but she must know it I have order'd it so that she is scarce ever from her they have one and the same BedChamber yet such is my Distemper that I suspect every Body and can only believe my own ImaginationsThere must be some Reason that  Deidamia  hath not been with me this MorningI am impatient to see her  AIR XIX  John Anderson  my  Jo    Art  Let Jealousy no longer  A fruitless Search pursue  You make his Flame the Stronger  And wake Resentment too  This selftormenting Care give o'er  For all you can obtain  Is what was only Doubt before  To change for real Pain  The End of the First Act  ACT II SCENE I  Diphilus Achilles  Ach  I Am very sensible my Lord of the particular Honours that are shewn me  Diph  Honours Madam  Lycomedes  is still more particular How happy must that Woman be whom he respects  Ach  What do you mean my Lord  Diph  Let this speak both for him and me The Present is worthy him to give and you to receive  Ach  I have too many Obligations already  Diph  'Tis in your Power Madam to return 'em all  Ach  Thus I return 'em And if you dare be honest tell him this Ring had been a more  honourable  Present to  Theaspe

is yours I intreat your Highness not to forget your Servant  Ach  I shall remember thee with Contempt and Abhorrence  Diph  I beg you Madam to consider your present Situation This uncommon Distinction requires a softer Answer  Ach  I shall give no other my LordI dare say  Diphilus  you think yourself highly honour'd by your present Negotiation Is there no Office too mean for AmbitionWas you not a Man of Quality was you not a Favourite the World my Lord wou'd call you a Pimp a Pandar a Bawd for this very honourable Proposal of yours  Diph  What an unmerciful Weapon is a Woman's Tongue I beg your Highness to confine yourself within the Bounds of common Civility and to consider who I am  Ach  I do consider it  Diphilus  and that makes thee a thousand times the more contemptible  AIR XXI Butter'd Pease  Shou'd the Beast of the noblest Race  Act the Brute of the lowest Class  Tell me which do you think more base  Or the Lion or the Ass  Boast not then of thy Rank or State  That but shews thee the meaner Slave  Take thy due then of Scorn and Hate  As thou'rt but the greater Knave  Diph  Though the Sex have the Privilege of unlimited Expression and that a Woman's Words are not to be resented yet a Lady Madam may be illbred Ladies too are generally passionate enough without a Provocation so that a Reply at present would be unnecessary  Ach  Are such the Friends of PowerHow unhappy are Princes to have their Passions so very readily put in Execution that they seldom know the Benefit of Reflexion Go and for once make your Report faithfully and without Flattery  SCENE II  Diphilus  Diph  This Girl is so excessively illbred and such an arrant Termagant that I cou'd as soon fall in love with a Tigress She hath a handsom Face 'tis true but in her Temper she is a very FuryBut  Lycomedes  likes her and 'tis not for me to dispute either his Taste or PleasureNotwithstanding she is such a Spitfire 'tis my Opinion the thing may still do Things of this Nature shou'd be always transacted in Person for there are Women so ridiculously halfmodest that they are asham'd in Words to consent to what when a Man comes to the Point they will make no Difficulties to comply with  SCENE III  Lycomedes Diphilus  Lycom  Well  Diphilus  in what manner did she receive my Present  Diph  'Tis my Opinion Sir that she will accept it only from your Hands From me she absolutely refuses it  AIR XXII Come open the Door sweet  Betty    Lycom  What must I remain in Anguish  And did not her Eyes consent  No Sigh not a Blush nor Languish  That promis'd a kind Event  It must be all Affectation  The Tongue hath her Heart bely'd  That oft hath withstood Temptation  When ev'ry thing else comply'd  Lycom  How did she receive you Did you watch her Eyes What was her Behaviour when you first told her I lov'd her  Diph  She seem'd to be desperately disappointed that you had not told her so your self  Lycom  But when you press'd it to her  Diph  She had all the Resentment and Fury of the most complying Prude  Lycom  But did not she soften upon Consideration  Diph  She seem'd to take it mortally ill of me that my meddling in the Affair had delay'd your Majesty's Application  Lycom  What no favourable Circumstance  Diph  Nay I was not in the least surpris'd at her Behaviour Love at secondhand to a Lady of her warm Constitution It was a Disappointment Sir and she cou'd not but treat it accordingly Whatever was my Opinion 'twas my Duty Sir to obey you but I found just the Reception I expected Apply to her your self Sir answer her Wishes and if I know any thing of Woman she will then answer yours and behave herself as she ought  Lycom  But dear  Diphilus  I grow more and more impatient  Diph  That too by this time is her CaseTo save the Appearances of Virtue the most easy Woman expects a little gentle Compulsion and to be allow'd the Decency of a little feeble Resistance For the Quiet of her own Conscience a Woman may insist upon acting the Part of Modesty and you must comply with her ScruplesYou will have no more trouble but what will heighten the Pleasure  Lycom  Pyrrha  This is beyond my Hopes  Diphilus  lay your Hand upon my Breast Feel how my Heart flutters  Diph  Did  Pyrrha  feel these Assurances of Love she wou'd not appear so thoughtful  Lycom  Deidamia  too not with her  Diph  She is with the Queen Sir  Lycom  My other Daughters who seem less fond of her are in the Garden so all's safeLeave me  Diphilus  and let none upon Pain of my Displeasure presume to intrude  SCENE IV  Lycomedes Achilles  Lycom  Lady  Pyrrha  my dear Child why so thoughtful  Ach  Thoughts may not be so respectful they may be too familiar too friendly too true And who about you presumes to communicate 'em Words and Forms only are for your Ear Sir  Lycom  You know  Pyrrha  you was never receiv'd upon the Foot of Ceremony but Friendship so that it wou'd be more respectful if you was less shy and less reserv'd'Tis your Behaviour  Pyrrha  that keeps me at a Distance  Ach  If I was wanting Sir either in Duty to you or my self my own Heart wou'd be the first to reproach meYour Majesty's Generosity is too solicitous upon my Account and your Courtesy and Affability may even now detain you from Affairs of ImportanceIf you have no Commands Sir the Princesses expect me in the Garden  Lycom  Nay positively my dear  Pyrrha  you shall not go  Ach  But why

Decency to themselves practise with common Lovers before ComplianceBut my Passion  Pyrrha  deserves some Distinction  Ach  I beg you then Sir don't lay violent Hands upon me  Lycom  The Present you

Sir and had it not been for that Sycophant  Diphilus  perhaps you had known yours  Lycom  I am not Lady to be aw'd and frighten'd by stern Looks and FrownsSince your obstinate Behaviour then makes Violence necessary  Ach  You make Selfpreservation Sir as necessary  Lycom  I won't be refus'd  AIR XXVI The Lady's NewYear's Gift  Lycom  Why such Affectation  Ach  Why this Provocation  Lycom  Must

desperate Fight  'Tis Justice and Virtue that hath prevail'd  Power must yield to Right  Lycom  Am I so ignominiously to be got the better of  Ach  You are  Lycom  By a Woman  Ach  You now Sir find you had acted a greater Part if in Spite of your Flatterers you had got the better of your own Passions  SCENE V  Lycomedes Achilles Diphilus Courtiers  Court  An Attempt upon the King's LifeThe Guards where are the Guards  Court  Such an open barefac'd Assassination  They seize  Achilles  and raise  Lycomedes    Court  And by a Woman too  Court  Where are your Wounds Sir  Court  Take the Dagger from her that she do no farther Mischief  Court  The Dagger Where What Dagger  Court  You will find it some where or other conceal'd examine her search her  Ach  Save your Zeal Sirs for times of real Danger Let  Lycomedes  accuse meHe knows my Offence  Lycom  How have I expos'd my self  Diphilus  bid these overofficious Friends leave me and as they value my Favour that they say nothing of what they have seen    Diphilus  talks apart with the Courtiers who go out  Though the Insult from any other Person had been unpardonable there are ways that you Madam might still take to reconcile me  Ach  Selfdefence Sir is the Privilege of Mankind I know your Power but as I have offended no Law I rely upon your Justice  Lycom  'Twou'd be safer Madam to rely on your own future Behaviour  Ach  Who

A Glance cou'd all my Rage destroy  And light up my Flame anew  For though a Man can stand at Bay  Against a Woman's Will  And keep amid the loudest Fray  His Resolution still  Yet when consenting Smiles accost  The Man in her Arms is lost  SCENE VI  Lycomedes Achilles Diphilus  Ach  If your Resentment wants only the Show of Justice let this  honourable  Man here be my Accuser it may be necessary for him to trump up a horrid Conspiracy to skreen his own infamous Practices  Diph  Your Majesty hath had too much Confidence in this Woman The Lives of Kings are sacred and the Matter trivial as it seems deserves further InquiryThere must be some secret villainous Design in this Affair  Ach  And are not you  Diphilus  conscious of that secret villainous Design  Diph  'Tis an Offence Sir that is not to be pardon'd Your Dignity Sir calls upon you notwithstanding your Partiality to her to make her an Example There must be Things of Consequence that we are still ignorant of and she ought to undergo the severest ExaminationMy Zeal for your Service Sir was never as yet at a loss for Witnesses upon these Occasions  To  Lycomedes    Lycom  Don't you see the Queen coming this Way Have done with this Discourse dear  Diphilus  and leave me Wou'd I cou'd forget this ridiculous Affair For the present  Pyrrha  I trust you to return to the Ladies though considering your passionate Temper I have little Reason to rely on your Discretion  SCENE VII  Lycomedes Theaspe Deidamia  Theas  I thought I had heard  Pyrrha  's Voice  Lycom  A jealous Woman's Thoughts are her own and her Husband's eternal Plague so I beg you my Dear say no more of her  Theas  And have I no reason but my own Thoughts my Liege  AIR XXIX Dicky's Walk in Dr  Faustus    Theas  What give o'er  I must and will complain  Lycom  You plague us both in vain  Theas  You wont then hear a Wife  Lycom  I must it seems for Life  Teaze no more  Theas  Nay Sir you know 'tis true  That 'tis to her I owe my Due  No Thanks to you  It behoves Kings Sir to have the severest Guard upon their Actions for as their great ones are trumpeted by Fame their little ones are as certainly and as widely convey'd from Ear to Ear by a Whisper  Lycom  These chimerical Jealousies Madam may provoke my Patience  Theas  Chimerical JealousiesAnd do you really Sir think your ignominious Affair is still a SecretAm I to be ignorant of a Thing that is already whisper'd every where  AIR XXX Puddings and Pyes  Lycom  The Slips of a Husband you Wives  Will never forget  Your Tongue for the Course of our Lives  Is never in debt  'Tis now funning  And then dunning  Intent on our Follies alone  'Tis so fully employ'd that you never can think of your own  Theas  My Suspicions have  indeed  wrong'd  Pyrrha  How I respect and honour that Girl  Deidamia  that honourable that virtuous Creature  Pyrrha  well deserves both your Friendship and mineAs soon as you have found her bring her to me that I may acknowledge the Merits she hath to me  SCENE VIII  Lycomedes Theaspe  Theas  After the Repulse and Disgrace you have very justly met with you might with Reason censure me for want of Duty and Respect shou'd I upbraid you'Tis past and if you will never again put me in mind I choose to forget itYet wou'd you reward Virtue and had you any Regard for my Quiet  AIR XXXI My Dilding my Dalding  Ah shou'd you ever find her  Complying and kinder  Though now you have resign'd her  What then must ensue  Your Flame though now 'tis over  Again will recover  You'll prove as fond a Lover  As I'm now of you  Lycom  What wou'd you have me do  Theas  I wou'd have you distrust your self and remove the TemptationI have long had it at Heart to find a Match for my Nephew  Periphas  and I really think we can never meet with a more deserving Woman  Lycom  Whatever Scheme you have for her  I  shall not interfere with youI have had enough of her termagant Humours she hath not the common Softness of the Sex 'Tis my Opinion that  Periphas  will not find himself much oblig'd to you for the Man that marties her must either conquer his own Passions or hers and one of 'em according to my Observation is not to be conquer'd  Theas  Marriage Sir hath broke many a Woman's Spirit and that will be only his AffairWhen he takes her with him your own Family at least will be easy  Lycom  Her Presence just now wou'd be shockingI cou'd not stand the Shame and ConfusionI see her and  Deidamia  with herDo with her as you please you have my Consent  SCENE IX  Theaspe Deidamia Achilles  Theas  The Character  Deidamia  hath given of you and your own Behaviour Child have so charm'd me that I think I never can sufficiently reward your Merits  Ach  Deidamia  's Friendship may make her partialMy only Merit Madam is Gratitude  Theas  To convince you of the Opinion I have of youBut I must first ask you a QuestionDon't you think Lady  Pyrrha  that my Nephew  Periphas  is very agreeable  Ach  That Impatience of his to serve as a Volunteer with the Troops of  Lycomedes  at the Siege of  Troy  is becoming his BirthSo much Fire and so much SpiritI don't wonder your Majesty is fond of him  Theas  But I am sure  Pyrrha  you must think his Person agreeable  Ach  No Woman alive can dispute it  Theas  I don't know every way so deserving a young Man and I have that Influence upon him and at the same time that Regard for him that I would have him happyDon't think Child that I wou'd make him happy at your Expence for knowing him I know you will be soWas the Princess  Calista  here 'tis a Match she cou'd not disapprove of therefore let that be no Obstacle for every thing in regard to her I take upon my self  Ach  Wou'd you make me the Obstacle to his Glory Pardon me Madam I know my self undeserving  AIR XXXII How happy are you and I  First let him for Honour roam  And martial Fame obtain  Then if he shou'd come Home  Perhaps I may explain  Since then alone the Hero's Deeds  Can make my Heart give way  'Till  Ilion  falls and  Hector  bleeds  I must my Choice delay  Theas  Nay  Pyrrha  I won't take these romantick Notions of yours for an Answer  Deidamia  is so much your Friend that I am sure she must be happy with this Alliance so while I make the Proposal to my Nephew I leave you two to talk over the Affair together  SCENE X  Deidamia Achilles  Ach  Was there ever a Man in so whimsical a Circumstance  Deid  Was there ever a Woman in so happy and so unhappy a one as mine  Ach  Why did I submit why did I plight my Faith thus infamously to conceal my selfWhat is become of my Honour  Deid  Ah  Pyrrha    Pyrrha  what is become of mine  Ach  When shall I behave my self as a Man  Deid  Wou'd you had never behav'd yourself as one  AIR XXXIII Fy gar rub her o'er with Straw  Deid  Think what Anguish tears my Quiet  Since I suffer'd Shame for thee  Man at large may rove and riot  We are bound but you are free  Are thy Vows and Oaths mistaken  See the Birds that wing the Sky  These their Mates have ne'er for saken  'Till their Young at least can fly  Ach  Pester'd and worried thus from every Quarter 'tis impossible much longer to prevent discovery  Deid  Dear dear  Pyrrha  confide in me Any other Discovery but to me only wou'd be inevitable Perdition to us both Am I treated like a common Prostitute Can your Gratitude wou'd I might say Love refuse to let me know the Man to whom I owe my Ruin  Ach  You must rely my dear Princess upon my Honour for I am not like a fond weak Husband to be teaz'd into the breaking my Resolution  AIR XXXIV  Beggar  's Opera Hornpipe  Ach  Know that Importunity's in vain  Deid  Can then nothing move thee  Ach  Ask not since Denial gives me Pain  Deid  Think how much I love thee  Ach  What's a Secret in a Woman's Breast  Deid  Canst thou thus upbraid me  Ach  Let me leave thy Heart and Tongue at rest  Deid  Love then hath betray'd me  Ach  For Heaven's sake  Deidamia  if you regard my Love give me QuietIntreaties Fondness Tears Rage and the whole matrimonial Rhetorick of Woman to gain her Ends are all thrown away upon me for by the Gods my dear  Deidamia  I am inexorable  Deid  But my dear  Pyrrha  for you oblige me still to call you by that Name only imagine what must be the Consequence of a Month or twoThink of my unhappy Condition To save my Shame if you are a Man of Honour you must then come to some Resolution  Ach  'Till I deserve these Suspicions  Deidamia  methinks it wou'd be more becoming your Professions of Love to spare 'em I have taken my Resolutions and when the time comes you shall know 'em till then be easy and press me no farther  AIR XXXV My time O ye Muses  Deid  How happy my Days and how sweet was my Rest  Ere Love with his Passions my Bosom distrest  Now I languish with Sorrow I doubt and I fear  But Love hath me all when my  Pyrrha  is near  Yet why have I griev'dYe vain Passions adieu  I know my own Heart and I'll think thee as true  And as you know my Heart 'twou'd be folly to range  For who'd be inconstant to lose by the Change  Deid  My Life my Honour then I implicitly intrust with you  Ach  Who wou'd have the trouble of putting on a Character that does not naturally belong to him the Life of a Hypocrite must be one continual Scene of Anxiety When shall I appear as I am and extricate my self out of this Chain of Perplexities I have no sooner escap'd being ravish'd but I am immediately to be made a Wife  Deid  But dear  Pyrrha  for my sake for your own have a particular Regard to your Behaviour till your Resolution is ripe for ExecutionYou now and then take such intolerable Strides that I vow you have set me a blushing  Ach  Considering my continual Restraint and how much the Part I act differs from my Inclinations I am surpriz'd at my own Behaviour  AIR XXXVI I am come to your House  Ach  Your Dress your Conversations  Your Airs of Joy and Pain  All these are Affectations  We never can attain  The Sex so often varies  'Tis Nature more than Art  To play their whole Vagaries  We must have Woman's Heart  Deid  Your Swearing too upon certain Occasions sounds so very masculinean Oath startles meWou'd I cou'd cure my self of these violent Apprehensions  Ach  As for that matter there are Ladies who in their Passions can take all the Liberties of Speech  Deid  Then too you very often look so agreeably impudent upon me that let me die if I have not been mortally afraid my Sisters wou'd find you out  Ach  Impudent are Women so censorious that Looks cannot escape 'emMay not one Woman look kindly upon another without Scandal  Deid  But such LooksNay perhaps I may be particular and it may be only my own Fears for notwithstanding your  Dress whenever I look upon you I have always the Image of a Man before my Eyes  Ach  Do what we will Love at some Moments will be unguardedBut what shall I do about this  Periphas    Deid  His Heart is so set upon the Siege that I know you can have but very little Persecution upon his Account  Ach  Wou'd I cou'd go with him  Deid  And cou'd you leave me thus  Ach  Have you only a womanish Fondness I thought  Deidamia  you lov'd me And you cannot truly love and esteem if in every Circumstance of Life you have not a just Regard for my Honour  Deid  Dear  Pyrrha  don't mention it the very Thought of it kills me You have set my Heart in a most violent Palpitation Let us talk no more upon this disagreeable Subject My Sisters will grow very impatientShou'd we stay longer together I might again be importunate and ask to know you and I had rather bear the eternal Plague of unsatisfied Curiosity than give you a Moment's DisquietThey are now expecting us in the Garden and considering my present Circumstances I wou'd not give 'em occasion to be impertinent for of late they have been horridly prying and inquisitiveLet us go to 'em  Ach  I envy that  Periphas  His Honour his Fame his Glory is not shackled by a Woman  AIR XXXVII The Clarinette  Ach  Ah why is my Heart so tender  My Honour incites me to Arms  To Love shall I Fame surrender  By Laurels I'll merit thy Charms  Deid  How can I bear the Reflection  Ach  I balance and Honour gives way  Deid  Reward my Love by Affection  I ask thee no more than I pay  The End of the Second Act  ACT III SCENE I  Theaspe Periphas Artemona  Theasp  PEriphas  I have a Favour to ask of you and positively I will not be refus'd  Per  Your Majesty may command  Theas  Nay Nephew 'tis for your own good  Per  To obey your Commands Madam must be so  Theas  I am not  Periphas  talking to you as a Queen but as a Relation a FriendI must have no Difficulties therefore I insist upon your absolute Promise  Per  I am not in my own Power Madam  Lycomedes  you know hath acceded to the Treaty of Alliance that to furnish his Quota his Troops are already embark'd and that I have engag'd my self in his Service  Theas  Why will you raise Obstacles before you know the Conditions 'Tis a thing I have set my heart upon and I tell you 'tis what in Honour you can comply with  Per  My Duty my Obligations put me entirely in your Disposal  Theas  You promise then solemnly faithfully  Per  I do  Theas  I have remark'd  Periphas  that you are prodigiously fond of the Princess  Calista  's Daughter  Per  I fond of her Madam  Theas  Nay  Periphas  are not you eternally at her Ear  Art  How I have seen that formidable Hero General  Ajax  suffer upon your AccountOf all his Rivals you are his eternal TormentHe reddens sighs and as much as is consistent with such a blustering Soldier's Valour languishes whenever you are near her  Theas  You may safely own your Passion  Periphas  for I know you think her agreeable  Art  Besides her being the fashionable Beauty of the Court which is sufficient Vanity to make all the young Fellows follow her you of all Mankind in Gratitude ought to like  herI know all of 'em envy the particular Distinctions she shews you  Theas  I am convinc'd of her Merits and your marrying her I know wou'd make you both happy  Per  Let me perish Madam if I ever once thought of it  Theas  Your Happiness you see hath been in my Thoughts I take the settling this Affair upon my self  Per  How cou'd you Madam imagine I had any Views of this kindWhat be a Woman's Follower with Intention to marry her Why the very Women themselves wou'd laugh at a Man who had so vulgar a Notion of Galantry and knew so little of their InclinationsThe Man never means it and the Woman never expects it and for the most part they have every other View but Marriage  Theas  But I am serious Nephew and insist upon your Promise  AIR XXXVIII No sooner had  Jonathan  leap'd from the Boat  What are the Jests that on Marriage you quote  All ignorant Batchelors censure by Rote  Like Criticks you view it with Envy or Spleen  You pry out its Faults but the Good is o'erseen  Per  'Tis not in my Power Madam 'tis not in my InclinationsA Soldier can have but one Inducement to marry and the Woman may have the same Reason too which is the Opportunities of Absence  Theas  You know Nephew you have promis'd  Per  But suppose I am already engag'd  Theas  That will be another Merit to her  Per  'Tis impossible MadamIn a Day or two you know I am to set out for the Campaign  Theas  A Lady of her romantic Spirit can have no Objections to following the Camp  AIR XXXIX Love's a Dream of mighty Pleasure  Soldier think before you marry  If your Wife the Camp attends  You but a Convenience carry  For perhaps a hundred Friends  If at home she's left in Sorrow  Absence is convenient too  Neighbours now and then may borrow  What is of no Use to you  Theas  I indeed fear'd  Pyrrha  might have started some Difficulties but if you rightly consider the Proposal you can have none  Per  What is the Cause of the War we are now engag'd in Does not the Fate of  Menelaus  stare me in the Face  Theas  I will have no more of your trifling Objections  Periphas  and as to your Part from this time I will look upon the Affair as happily concludedAll that now remains to be done is with  Pyrrha  I have left her to  Deidamia  's Management and without doubt her good Offices must prevail for you can never have a better AdvocateBut shou'd the Girl be perverse and obstinate'Tis impossible For however her Heart is already engag'd no Woman alive can resist the Ambition of such an Alliance  SCENE II  Periphas  Per  Had I so little Taste of Liberty as to be inclin'd to marry that Girl is of so termagant a SpiritThe bravest Man must have the dread of an eternal Domestic WarIn a Tonguecombat Woman is invincible and the Husband must come off with Shame and Infamy for though he lives in perpetual Noise and Tumult the poor Man is only ridiculous to his NeighboursHow can we ever get rid of her  Hercules  conquer'd the sevenheaded  Hydra  but his Wife was a venom'd Shirt that stuck to him to the last  SCENE III  Periphas Ajax  Ajax  This Rencounter  Periphas  is as I wish'dThe Liberties you have takenyou know what I meanwhen my Honour is concern'dan Indignity and all that 'Tis not to be put up and I must insist upon an Explanation There is a particular Affair my Lord  Per  Your accosting me in this particular manner Lord  Ajax  requires ExplanationFor let me die if I comprehend you  Ajax  Death my Lord I explain I am not come here to be ask'd Questions'Tis sufficient that I know the Affront and that you know I will have SatisfactionSo now you are answer'd  Per  I can't say much to  my  Satisfaction my Lord for I can't so much as guess at your meaning  Ajax  A Man of Honour  Periphas  is not to be trifled withal  Per  But a Man of Honour  Ajax  is not oblig'd in Courage to be unintelligible  Ajax  I hate talkingThe Tongue is a Woman's Weapon Whenever I am affronted by the Gods this Sword is my only Answer  Per  'Tis not  Ajax  that I decline the Dispute or wou'd upon any Account deny you the Pleasure of fighting yet if it is not too much Condescension in a Man of Honour before I fight I wou'd willingly know the Provocation  AIR XL  Maggy Lawther  Ajax  What is all this idle Chat  Words are out of Season  Whether 'tis or this or that  The Sword shall do me reason  Honour call'd me to the Task  No matter for explaining  'Tis a fresh Affront to ask  A Man of Honour's meaning  Ajax  Be it as it will  Periphas  we have gone too far already to retractYou know I suppose of my Pretensions to a certain LadyNow are you satisfied  Per  If you had her my Lord it had been much more to my SatisfactionI admire your Courage  AIR XLI Lord  Frog  and Lady  Mouse    Oh then it seems you want a Wife  Shou'd I consent  You may repent  And all her daily Jars and Strife  You may on me resent  Thus ev'ry Day and ev'ry Night  If things at home shou'd not go right  We three must live in constant Fight  Take her at all Event  Ajax  Hell and Furies I am not to be rally'd out of my Resentment  Per  Now in my Opinion 'tis flinging away your Courage to fight without a Cause though indeed the Men of uncommon Prowess by their loving to make the most of every Quarrel seem to think the contrary  Ajax  You are not so sure of the Lady  Periphas  as you flatter yourself for whenever I am a Rival by  Jove  'tis not her Consent but my Sword that must decide the Question  Per  Sure never a Rival as you will call me had a better Reason for fighting than I have at present for if I am kill'd I shall be out of danger of having the Woman  Ajax  You might spare your Jokes  Periphas  for my Courage wants no ProvocationIf I fall  Pyrrha  may be yours You will then deserve her'Till then  Per  So he that conquers as a Reward I find is to be marriedNow dear  Ajax  is that worth fighting for  Ajax  Your Passion for that Lady  Periphas  is too publick to bear DisputeHave not I seen you whisper her laugh with her And by some particular Looks at the same time 'twas too evident that I was the Subject of your Mirth  Per  Looks  Ajax  Ajax  Yes Looks my Lord and I never did or will take an impertinent one from any Man  Per  Impertinent one  Ajax  Furies This calm Mockery is not to be born I won't have my Words repeated  Per  Such Language  Ajax  may provoke me  AIR XLII  Richmond  Ball

Tittletattle  Is a Battle  You may safer try  Per  Yet first I'd fain know why  Ajax  By  Jupiter    Periphas  'till now I never thought you a Coward  Per  Nay thensince my own Honour calls upon me Take notice  Ajax  that I  don't  fight for the Woman  They fight  SCENE IV  Periphas Ajax Theaspe Artemona Guards  Guard  Part 'emBeat down their Swords  They are parted  Guard  How dar'd you presume to fight in the Royal Gardens  Guard  Nay in the very PresenceFor see the Queen  Ajax  'Tis very hard Sirs that a Man shou'd be deny'd the Satisfaction of a Gentleman  Theas  Lord  Ajax  for this unparallel'd Presumption we forbid you the Palace  Ajax  I shall take some other Opportunity my Lord  SCENE V  Theaspe Artemona Periphas  Theas  And as for you  Periphas    Per  Your Majesty's Rigor can do no less than forbid me the Woman  Theas  The Woman  Periphas  is the only thing that can reconcile me to your Behaviour  Per  That blundering Hero  Ajax  will have it that I am his Rival The Man will be almost as miserable without her as 'tis probable he might be with herOblige us both then Madam and let the General be miserable in his own way  Theas  I cou'd not have imagin'd that obstinate Girl cou'd have had any Scruples to the Match but  Deidamia  tells me she finds her as difficult as you  Per  Since you know Madam that  Pyrrha  will have her own way for both our sakes and to save yourself unnecessary Trouble your Majesty had better give up this Impossibility  SCENE VI  Theaspe Artemona Periphas Diphilus Guards  Diph  To prevent future Mischief my Lord his Majesty puts you under Arrest and commands you to attend him General  Ajax  is already in Custody'Tis his Pleasure too that after you have paid your Duty to him you embark with the Troops immediately and you are not to come ashore again upon pain of his Majesty's Displeasure  AIR XLIII  In War we've nought but Death to fear  How gracious is the Sentence  For that is easier far to bear  Than Marriage with Repentance  Begirt with Foes by Numbers brav'd  I'd bless the happy Crisis  The Man from greater Danger sav'd  The lesser ones despises  Per  Your Majesty then you find must dispense with my Promise 'till after the ExpeditionIf the General shou'd be so happy to bring  Pyrrha  with him to the Camp perhaps we may like one another better  Diph  The King Madam wants to talk to your Majesty upon Affairs of ConsequenceYou will find him in the Royal Apartment  Theas  My Daughters with  Pyrrha  have just turn'd the Walk and are coming this wayYou may stay with 'em  Artemona  till I send for you  SCENE VII  Artemona Philoe Lesbia  Phil  'Tis horridly mortifying that these TradesPeople will never get any thing New against a Birthday They are  all so abominably stupid that a Woman of Fancy cannot possibly have the Opportunity of shewing her Genius  Lesb  The Fatigue one hath of talking to those Creatures for at least a Month before a Birthday is insupportable for you know Sister when the time draws so very near a Woman can think of nothing else  Phil  After all Sister though their things are detestable one must make choice of something or other I have sent to the Fellows to be with me this Morning  Lesb  You are so eternally sending for 'em one wou'd imagine you was delighted with their Conversation For those hideous Stuffs they will shew us from Year to Year are frightful are shocking How can a Woman have so ill a Taste as to expose herself in a last Year's Pattern  Phil  Dear Madam I beg your Pardon Let me die if I saw you  Lesb  Our meeting her was lucky beyond Expression for I never felt so uneasy a thing as a Secret  Phil  You know Sister we had agreed to trust her with our Suspicions  Lesb  Yet after all when a Sister's Reputation is concern'd  Phil  But is not the Honour of a Family of greater Consequence  Lesb  Tho she is a Woman and a Favourite I dare say if  Artemona  promises whatever the suffers she will inviolably keep it to herself  Art  If I had not this Quality I had little deserv'd  Theaspe  's FriendshipBy all that's Sacred Ladies you may safely trust me  Phil  'Tis impossible Sister but she herself must have observ'd it  Lesb  Whatever People have observ'd 'tis a thing you know that no Creature alive can presume to talk upon  Phil  Deal fairly and openly with us  Artemona  Have you remark'd nothing particular of  Deidamia  yonder of late  Art  Of  Deidamia  Lesb  Only look upon her Madam  Phil  Wellwhat do you think of her  Lesb  Are you blind  Artemona  or dare not you believe your Eyes  Art  Her particular Intimacy with  Pyrrha  do you mean  Phil  Dear MadamThen I find we must speak first  Lesb  Now dear  Artemona  can any Woman alive imagine that Shape of hers within the compass of common Modesty  Art  But how can one possibly have those Suspicions  Phil  She is a Woman Madam she hath Inclinations and may have had her Opportunities that we know nothing of  AIR XLIV Minuet of  Corelli  in the Ninth  Concerto    Phil  We may resolve to resist Temptation  And that's all we can do  For in the Hour of Inclination  What cou'dI or you  Lesb  Though the thing is improbable 'tis so monstrously evident that it cannot bear a Dispute  Phil  Then her Bosom too is so preposterously impudent One wou'd think a Woman in her Condition was not conscious of her own Shame  Lesb  Or imagin'd other People cou'd overlook it as well as herself  Phil  Then she is so squeamish and so frequently out of order  Lesb  That she hath all the outward Marks of Female Frailty must be visible to all Womankind  Phil  But how she came by 'em there  Artemona  is still the Secret  Lesb  I must own that by her particular Intimacies with that forward Creature  Pyrrha  I suspect her to be her Confident in this Accident  Art  I beg you Ladies to turn this Discourse for  Deidamia  and  Pyrrha  are just coming upon us to join the Conversation  SCENE VIII  Philoe Lesbia Artemona Deidamia Achilles  Lesb  Now I dare swear that careless Creature  Pyrrha  hath not once thought of her Clothes  Art  Nay dear Lady  Pyrrha  the thing is not such a trifle for 'tis the only Mark of Respect that most People are capable of shewing And though that is not your Case I know your Gratitude can never omit this publick Occasion  AIR XLV Tom and Will were Shepherds twain  Art  Think of Dress in ev'ry Light  'Tis Woman's chiefest Duty  Neglecting that our selves we slight  And undervalue Beauty  That allures the Lover's Eye  And graces ev'ry Action  Besides when not a Creature's by  'Tis inward Satisfaction  Ach  As I am yet a Stranger Ladies to the Fashions of the Country 'tis your Fancy that must determine me  Phil  How can a Woman of common Sense be so unsolicitous about her Dress  Lesb  And trust a Woman to choose for her 'Tis a Temptation to be spiteful that very few of us can resist for we have not many Pleasures that can equal that of seeing another Woman ridiculous  Phil  But you have not  Pyrrha  misplac'd your Confidence  SCENE IX  Philoe Lesbia Deidamia Achilles Artemona Servant  Serv  Your Embroiderer Madam  Phil  That Woman is everlastingly pestering me for Employment Now can she imagine that to promote her tawdry  Trade I can be talk'd into making myself ridiculous by appearing eternally in her odious EmbroideryI can't see her nowBut perhaps I may want her for some trivial thing or otherLet her call again to morrow  Serv  The Antichamber Madam is crowded with TradesPeople  Phil  Did not I tell you that I wou'd not be troubled with those impertinent CreaturesBut holdI had forgot I sent for 'emLet 'em wait  Lesb  But if those foreign Merchants who lately came into Port are among 'em  Phil  There Sister is all my Hope I shall be horridly disappointed if they don't shew us something charming  Lesb  Shou'd any Woman alive get Sight of their things before us  Phil  I cou'd not bear itTo appear in what another Woman had refus'd wou'd make the Creature so intolerably vain  Lesb  Are those Merchants I ask you among 'em  Serv  They have been waiting Madam above this half Hour  Lesb  And did not you know our ImpatienceHow cou'd you be so stupidLet us see them this Instant  SCENE X  Artemena Philoe Lesbia Deidamia Achilles Ulysses Diomedes Agyrtes Disguis'd as Merchants  Art  Unless you have any thing that is absolutely new and very uncommon you will give us and your selves Gentlemen but unnecessary Trouble  Ulys  Our Experience Madam must have profited very little by the Honour of dealing with Ladies if we cou'd imagine they cou'd possibly be pleas'd twice with the same thing  Diom  You might as well offer 'em the same Lover  Ulys  We have learnt the good Manners Madam to distinguish our CustomersTo produce any thing that had ever been seen before wou'd be a downright Insult upon the Genius of a Lady of Quality  Diom  Novelty is the very Spirit of Dress  Lesb  Let me die if the Fellows don't talk charmingly  Phil  Sensibly Sister  Lesb  'Tis evident they must have had Dealings with Ladies of Condition  Diom  We only wait your Commands  Ulys  We have things of all kinds Ladies  Phil  Of all kindsNow that is just what I wanted to see  Lesb  Are not

Bobtail Lass  In Dress and Love by like Desires  Is Woman's Heart perplext  The Man and the Gown she one Day admires  She wishes to change the next  The more you are fickle we're more employ'd  And Love hath more Customers too  For Men are as fickle and soon are cloy'd  Unless they have something New  Lesb  But dear Man consider our Impatience  Ulys  Wou'd you command the things Ladies to be brought here or wou'd you see 'em in your own Apartment  Phil  How intolerably these Fellows love talking  Lesb  How canst thou Man ask such a Question  Phil  Hereimmediately  Ulys  Nay tis not Madam that our Goods can be put out of Countenance by the most glaring Lightas for that matter  Lesb  Nay pry'thee Fellow have done    Diomedes  goes out and returns with  Agyrtes  Ulys  I wou'd not offer you these Pearls Ladies if the World cou'd produce such another Pair  Phil  A Pair FellowDost thou think that Jewels pair like Men and Women because they were never made to agree  Diom  Now Ladies

Lesb  A Suit of ArmourYou see  Philoe  they can at least equip us for the Camp  Phil  Nay  Lesbia  for that Matter it might serve many a stiff awkward Creature that we see every Day in the Drawingroom
