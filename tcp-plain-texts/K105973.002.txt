 THE JOURNEY  TO  SNOWDON  RUDLAND  LONDON Printed by Henry Hughes MDCCLXXXI  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS Journey is the continuation of my Tour in WALES Another part will appear with all conve∣nient speed and comprehend the remainder of  Caernar∣vonshire  the Isle of  Anglesea  the county of  Montgomery  and conclude with some account of SHREWSBURY the antient seat of the  British  Princes which will complete the second volume and probably all that I shall say of our Principality for indolence the forerunner of age begins to check every new attempt  THIS book contains a journey from my own house

westward from  Downing  passed by  Whiteford  our parishchurch and ascended the hill of  Garreg  or the  Rock  a high and most conspicuous part of the country The  Romans  took ad∣vantage of it and placed on its summit a  Pharos  A PHAROS  to conduct the navigators to and from  Deva  along the difficult channel of the  Seteia Portus  The building is still remaining I hope my friends will not deem me an antiquarian  Quixote  and imagine me mis∣taking in this my second sally a building hitherto supposed to have been a windmill for a  Roman  lighthouse It is tolerably entire its form is circular the height considerable the inner diameter twelve feet and a half the thickness of the walls four feet four inches The doors or entrances are opposite to each other over each is a square funnel like a chimney which opens on the outside about half way up the building On each side is  a window About four feet from the ground are three circular holes lined with mortar as is frequent in  Roman  buildings and penetrate the whole wall for purposes now unknown  WITHINSIDE are the vestiges of a staircase which led to the floors of which there appear to have been two Along such part of the upper which was conspicuous from the channel are eight small square openings cased with freestone the rest of the build∣ing being of rude limestone bedded in hard mortar and each of these were separated by wooden pannels placed in deep grooves the last still in a perfect state In each of these partitions were placed the lights which the  Romans  thought necessary to keep distinct or to prevent from running into one lest they should be mistaken by seamen for a star  Periculum in corrivatione ignium ne sidus existimetur  Plini  Hist Nat  lib xxxvi c    To the building is very evidently a broad and raised road pointing from the east and near its upper end are the marks of a trench which surrounded and gave protection to this useful edi∣fice Descend and near the foot of the hill leave on the left  Maen Achwynfan  the cross described in my former tour  Glol  an inclosed mountain a little farther on has among the bushes various circular foundations of stone unmortared building About a mile from hence  NEWMARKET  visit the small town of  Newmarket  almost the entire creation of its then owner  John Wynne  esq  of  Gop  who died in the present century The antient name of the parish is  Tre∣lawnyd  for which I can find no satisfactory reason In the churchyard is a handsome old cross Here is fixed one of the charityschcols founded and opened in by doctor  Daniel Williams  a dissenting minister with an endowment of eight pounds a year a charity which he extended to every county in  North Wales  dis∣tinguishing that at  Wrexham  the place of his birth by an annual  salary of fifteen pounds He also established a fund I believe to each from which the children are apprenticed at five pounds apiece  FROM the town I ascended the hill  Cor  called  Copa'r'leni  on whose summit is a most enormous carnedd or tumulus formed of lime∣stones It was probably the site of  specula  or exploratory tower and memorial of some chieftain If  Roman  perhaps  Paulinus  gave name to it  CopPaulini  There is great uncertainty in these derivations I may possibly as well abide by my former etymo∣logy of  Cop yr Goleuni  or the Mount of Lights for it might have been a place of signals by fire of the approach of an enemy by sea  Tour in Wales i  or a  station  of the  holy fires  the  Coel Ceithie  of the  Druids  simi∣lar to the  Karn Gollewa  the carn of lights and  Karn Leskyz  or carn of burnings of the  Cornish  supposed by the learned BORLASE  Antiq Cornwall  to have been used for similar purposes The tract from hence to  Caerwys  was certainly a field of battle no place in  North Wales  exhibits an equal quantity of  tumuli  but all sepulchral as is proved by the urns discovered in them they are of a far inferior size to the first and covered with turf It will not be too hazardous a conjecture to suppose that in this place was the slaughter of the  Ordovices  by  Agricola  when our gallant nation was nearly extir∣pated Part of the brow of the hill is called  Bryn y Saethiau  or  the Hill of Arrows  from being the station of the archers in the en∣gagement  RETURN along the ridge of the hill marked its whole length with verdant tumuli the tombs of ancient heroes See beneath  me the little church of  Gwaenyskor  GWAENYSKOR  remarkable for its ancient register  DESCEND to the church and village of  Llanasa  the former dedi∣cated to  St Asaph  whose festival is kept on the first of  May  LLANASA  Laurence Child  Bishop of  St Asaph  in procured the impro∣priation of this church to supply his cathedral with lights  Willi's St Asaph App No xxi  and repair the ruins occasioned by the wars In my approach from these high lands towards the shore observe the ruins of a small chapel at the little hamlet of  Gwespyr  near  Trelacre  one of the seats of Sir  Pyers Mostyn  Baronet a branch of the house of  Mostyn  His adjacent quarry is noted for the excellence of the freestone and his vast and profitable warren beneath noted for the delicacy of the rabbets by reason of their feeding on the maritime plants  PASS over  GronantMoor  GRONANT  There is a tradition that its extent was so great that the people on this side could hold conversation over the channel with those of  Cheshire  This may be exagge∣rated but from authentic records it appears that this flat was formerly very extensive and that it had been reduced to its pre∣sent scanty limits by the fury of the sea which still possesses its antient place Previous to that catastrophe it was possessed by the see of  St Asaph  by virtue of a grant made by  Edward the Black Prince  son of  Edward  III to  Llewelyn ap Madoc  elected Bishop of  St Asaph  in The inundation happened before the reign of  Henry  V Previous to that time the Bishop paid annually into the exchequer at  Chester  as an acknowlegement the sum of twenty marks but  Henry  V in and  Henry  VI in and in consideration of the misfortune released  the see from that rent  Willis's St Asaph App No xxxi xxxii  If this record did not remain an incon∣teslable proof of the ravages of the ocean on this part of the coun∣try there exist other natural ones that would have given rea∣sonable grounds for suspicion The  Hyle sands  which run for twelve or fourteen miles parallel to the narrow hundred of  Wiral  in  Cheshire  and divided from  Wales  by a narrow channel were once in all probability part of the firm land of  England  A few miles to the west of  GronantMoor  under the parish of  Aber∣geleu  in  Denbighshire  are to be seen at low water very remote from the shore bedded in the sand immense numbers of oaktrees a forest before this event Lastly in the churchyard wall of  Abergelli  is a dateless epitaph in  Welsh  signifying the person who was interred there lived three miles to the north of that spot a tract now entirely possessed by the sea  ON approaching  Prestatyn  about two miles from  Trelacre  the flat becomes extremely fertile in corn especially wheat which is of distinguished excellence and continues equally noted through all the flat tract as far as  Ruddlan  where it is interrupted for a space by the marsh and is again continued along the coast far beyond  Abergeleu  A little below  Prestatyn  mill in a meadow is the site of its Castle nothing more than an elevated space with foundations consisting of stone and mortar and a foss at some dis∣tance from it now remain  PRESTATYNCASTLE  This little fortress was probably built by the  Welsh  but wrested from them by the  English  who were possessed of it in the only time I find any mention of it when it was destroyed by  Owen Gwynedd Cadwalader  his brother  and  Rees  Prince of  South Wales  and all  Tegengle  reduced to the power of its lawful sovereign  THE hamlet and village of  Prestatyn  lie in the parish of Meli∣den This place was granted by  Richard  I to  Robert Banaster  who enjoyed it for three years and a half and built the town which was destroyed by  Owen Gwynedd Robert de Crevecoeur  in the seventh year of  Edward  I laid claim to it in right of his an∣cestor  Banaster  An inquisition was made before a jury of twentyfour men  Sebright's MSS  their determination was in favor of  Robert  since I find by another record that he died possessed of lands in  Maelwr Saesneg  and  Prestatyn  which he held by the service of one knight's fee  THE road from hence to  Diserth  is extremely pleasant at the foot of high hills rich in lead ore with a fine and fertile flat to the right The white rock makes a conspicuous figure on the left and its sides appeared deeply trenched by the miners in search of ore Near this place is the beginning of the vale of  Clwyd  and the ter∣mination of the range of mountains which bound it on the east At a small distance from hence lies the church of  Diserth  in a picturesque and romantic bottom beneath some rude rocks the church overshaded with great yews and the singular figure of some of the tombs form a most striking appearance  DISERTH CHURCH  A waterfall in the deep and rounded hollow of a rock finely darkened with ivy once gave additional beauty to this spot but of late the di∣verting of the waters to a mill has robbed the place of this ele∣gant variation The stream which is little inferior to that of  Holywell  flows principally from a single well called  Fynnon Asa  or  St Asaph's Well  in a dingle in the parish of  Cwm  about a mile distant The fountain is inclosed with stone in a polygonal form and had formerly its votaries like that of St  Winefrede  ABOVE  Diserth  church on a high rock stand the remains of its Castle We cannot trace the foundation of this fortress which went by the names of  Dincolyn Castell y Ffailon  and  Castell Gerri  Llwyd's Itin  CASTLE  It probably was  Welsh  and the last of the chain of  British posts  on the  Clwydian  hills  Henry  III in fortified it  Powel  but its date was but short for in  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  rased both this castle and that of  Diganwy  Same  It was at a siege of this place that  Eineon  the son of  Ririd Vlaidd  was slain  Hengwrt MS  A cross was erected on the spot called  Croes Eineon  the shaft of which ornamented with strange sculpture now is supposed to form the stile into the churchyard of  Diserth  in which is another cross of very curious work∣manship  THE castle occupied the summit of the rock whose sides are escarpée or cut steep to render the access more difficult On one part beneath the top is a square outwork with fosses cut in part through the solid limestone The fragments of the castle shew that its ruin was not effected by time they lie in vast masses overthrown by mining which was a common method of besieging very long before the use of powder  IN a field a little to the south of the castle is a ruinous build∣ing called  Siamber Wen  This is said to have been the seat of a Sir  Robert Pounderling  Llwyd's Itin MS  once constable of the adjacent castle  SIR ROBERT POUNDERLING  a knight valiant and prudent who had one of his eyes knocked out  by a gentleman of  Wales  in the rough sport of tournament but being requested to challenge him again to  feates of armes  on meeting our countryman at the  English  court declined the com∣bat declaring that he did not intend that the  Welshman  should beat out his other eye  Leland's Itin  vi    Moel Hiraddug  a  British  post on a very steep and rocky hill with an immense agger of loose stones on the accessible part stands to the south of the castle and forms the next to it in the chain of fortresses  Tour in Wales  On the east side and on a place called  Marion  are long deep trenches out of which minerals have been dug proba∣bly in the times of the  Saxons  the ore appears by the fragments and color of the rubbish to have been iron and on the summit of the hill which is in the parish of  Cwm  is a great bed of beau∣tiful red spar which seems to take its tinge from the ore  Cwn  church as the word signifies is embosomed with hills and fronts the vale of  Clwyd  CWM CHURCH  On a very antient stone in the churchyard is this inscription  Hic jacet  TANGWISTE  uxor  LLEWELIN  ap  INIR but whether of  Inir  of  Yale  is uncertain  FROM  Diserth  I rode to  BodRhyddan  long the residence of the  Conways  a family derived from Sir  Hugh Conway  son of old  John Coniers  of  Richmond Yorkshire  brother to  Jevan  Lord  Coniers  Mr  W Mytton's Coll Pedigrees  his son Sir  Henry  by marriage with  Angharat  heiress to Sir  Hugh Crevecoeur  of  Prestatyn  Salusbury Pedigree  p b  probably acquired the settlement in this country  Prestatyn  continued possessed by the  Conways  till the death of Sir  John Conway  Baronet in the last of the male line when the estate was divided  ABOUT a mile and a half farther stands the small borough of  Rhuddlan  seated high on the red clayey banks of the  Clwyd  and above  MorsaRhuddlan  a marsh celebrated for the battle in between the  Saxons  and  Welsh  our monarch  Caradoc  fell in the conflict  Powel    and I fear victory declared against us We do indeed say that  Offa  the famous king of  Mercia  was slain here but the  Saxon  chronicle places his death  Sax  ch  the year before that battle The fine plaintive  Welsh  tune so well known by the name of  MorfaRhuddlan  is supposed to have been composed on this occasion for victories are not the only subjects for the harp How beauti∣fully does  David  lament the blood of the slain on the mountains of  Gilboa  HOW ARE THE MIGHTY FALLEN AND THE WEAPONS OF WAR PERISHED  THE castle had been a handsome building in a square with two extremes placed at opposite corners with a double round tower at each and a single one at the two other corners  CASTLE  The court forms an irregular octagon The ditch is large faced on both sides with stone The steep slope to the river was defended by high walls and square towers one is entire and there are vestiges of two others the first is called  TwrySilod  another in the castle was named  TwryBrenhin  or the  King's Tower  To the south of the castle at about a furlong distance is a large artificial mount the site of another fortress of very early date the whole surrounded by a very deep foss including also the abby which crosses from the margin of the bank near the ascent of the present road to  St Asaph  to another parallel road near which it is continued then turns and falls nearly into the southern part of the  walled ditch of the castle the whole forms a square area of very great extent These different works were formed at three several times The mount now called  TutHill  and its superstructure whatever it was is thoroughly  British  and is said to have been built by  Llewelyn ap Sitsylt  who reigned from the year to  Cambden  ii  It was a residence of our princes from that time but  Gryffyd ap Llewelyn  in having given offence to  Edward the Confessor  by receiving  Algar  one of his rebellious subjects was attacked by  Harold  who in revenge burned the palace at  Rhudd∣lan  Powel    It was soon restored and as soon lost  Robert  afterwards surnamed of  Rhuddlan  a valiant  Norman  nephew to  Hugh Lupus  earl of  Chester  conquered it from the  Welsh  and by the command of  William  the Conqueror fortified it with new works  Order Vital    and made it his place of residence from whence he greatly annoyed our countrymen The square towers are evidently of  Norman  archi∣tecture and naturally adopted by the new owner  Robert  received here a visit from our prince  Gryffydd ap Kynan  who came to solli∣cit aid against his enemies from the  Norman  warrior which he obtained but on some quarrel attacked him in his castle took and burnt the bailey or yard and killed such a number of his men that very few escaped into the towers  Life of  Gr ap Kynan  SEBRIGHT MSS    Henry  II in added new strength to the castle and left a considerable garrison in it before he quitted the country Not∣withstanding this  Owen Gwynedd  in took and dismantled  it but it was afterwards refortified by the  English  for it ap∣pears that this fortress had with two others been bestowed by  Henry  with  Emma  his natural sister on  David ap Owen  son and successor to  Owen Gwynedd  Here in he entertained very nobly  Baldwin  archbishop of  Canterbury  in his progress through  Wales  Girald Cambr Itin    Possibly he resigned it again to the  English  for I find that in it was besieged and taken by  Llewelyn ap Jorwerth  his successor in the principality  Powel      I MUST not omit relating notwithstanding I am unable to give the year of the event that  Randle Blundeville  earl of  Chester  was in this castle surprized by a body of  Welsh  and lay in the utmost distress until he was relieved by his lieutenant  Roger Lacy  alias  Hell  who collecting suddenly a rabble of fiddlers and idle people put the besiegers to flight In reward he received from the earl  Magisterium omnium Leccatorum et meretricum  TOTIUS CESTRESHIRE  Leicester  This Earl of  Chester  held his earldom from to    I FIND it in possession of  Edward  I in who was so well convinced of its importance in the conquest of  Wales  that he made it the rendezvous of all the forces destined for that purpose It was the  place d'armes  and the great magazine of provision for the support of his army in its advance into the country The reigning prince  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  knew the danger of leaving so consequential a place in the hands of his enemy but it resisted all the most vigorous efforts made on it in by  Llewelyn  and his brother  David  just reconciled to him by the sense of their com∣mon  danger Soon after it proved the place of confinement to the letter not long before his ignominious end at  Shrewsbury  IN order to secure it from any future attempts  Edward  turned all his thoughts towards founding a fortress impregnable by any future attempts of the  Welsh  He accordingly began with an act of justice that of making recompence to  Master Richard Bernard  parson of  Rhuddlan  for certain lands taken from him for the pur∣pose of enlarging the castle  Ayl  ff's Rot Wall      and again in made an ex∣change with the same church of six acres and a half for the same uses  Sebright MS  and on which he built the castle whose ruins we now sur∣vey The finishing of it took a considerable time for I find an order in for overlooking the works at the castles of  Rhuddlan Flint  and  Chester  Ret Walha    I cannot but remark here the strong neces∣sity of curbing the newconquered country with powerful garri∣sons for notwithstanding all the ravages of long and barbarous wars it remained so exceedingly populous that  Edward  politi∣cally drafted out of it not less than fifteen thousand men in aid of his  Scottish  expedition  Carte  II  The consequence proved almost fatal to him for while he lay encamped near  Linlithgow  a national quarrel ensued between the  English  and  Welsh  troops and after great bloodshed the latter separated themselves from his army  Da  ym  's Anna's  II    DURING the civil wars of the last century  TAKEN BY GEN MYTTON  it was garrisoned on the part of the king was taken by general  Mytton  in  July  and in the same year ordered by the parlement in the phrase of  the times to be slighted  i e  dismantled with many other  Welsh  castles  Whitelock      IN respect to the civil history of  Rhuddlan  I find that in the reign of  Edward the Confessor  it made part of the great territo∣ries of earl  Edwin  It was then by reason of the inroads of  Ha∣rold  a waste and continued so when it was possessed by  Hugh Lupus  It then became the capital of the district and  Hugh  en∣joyed a moiety of the church the mint and mines of the iron ore found in the manor  Probably those which we have mentioned in the parish of  Cwm  to which this maner might have extended for  Dissarch  or  Diserth  adjoining to  Cwm  is cited in  DoomsdayBook  as belonging to it  and a moiety of the water of  Clwyd i e  of the mill and fishery on such part which belonged to earl  Edwin  a moiety of the forests on the manor and of the toll and of the village called  Bren  and there were at this time in  Rhuddlan  eight burgesses All this  Hugh Lupus  granted to  Robert  of  Rhuddlan  with an addition of certain hamlets dependent on the place and a new borough was erected with eighteen burgesses who enjoyed the same privileges with those of  Hereford  and  Bre∣tril  and were exempted from all fines exceeding twelvepence except in case of manslaughter theft and  heinfare i e  the de∣priving a person of his servant  DoomsdayBook    EDWARD I  A BOROUGH  made this town a free borough appointed the con∣stable of the castle for the time being to be mayor and the bailiffs to be chosen annually by the burgesses on  Michaelmas  day who were to be presented to the constable to be sworn The town  was to have power of imprisoning except in such cases which affected the life or loss of limb when criminals of this nature were to be committed to the castle burgesses only were permitted to bail No  Jews  were to inhabit the town The burgesses had a forest and free warren a  gild cum hausa et loth et shoth sok sak et theam et insangenthest et lib per totam terram de Theoloniis lesta∣gio Muragio Danegeld Gaywite  c  THIS charter was given by the King at  Flint September  th in the twelfth year of his reign  Testibus Rob Bath Wells  c and confirmed by  Richard  II at  Leicester  and again at  West∣minster  No constable has been appointed since the days of  Oliver Cromwel  THE burgesses contribute towards electing a member for the borough of  Flint  Those who are qualified inhabit the place and that part of the parish called  Rhuddlan Franchise  which extends above a mile from the town  THE parlement said to have been held here in  JTS PARLEMENT  by  Ed∣ward  I was probably no more than a council assembled by the conqueror to divide his new conquests into counties and to give salutary laws to the  Welsh  to abolish any antient customs which the wise prince thought detrimental and to introduce such of the  English  as would prove of use This was not done hastily for in the year preceding a commission had been appointed with  Tho∣mas Beke  bishop of  St David  president who were to consider and report upon oath the different laws of both countries From their resolutions were framed the famous STATUTE OF RHUDDLAN in which among many excellent institutions were introduced  sheriffs and coroners their powers defined and the principal crimes of the times pointed out most of which were acts of vio∣lence rapine and theft such as might be expected to exist among people an evil which resulted more from the turbulence of the times than the want of wholesome laws  See the  Statuta Walliae  passim    A PIECE of antient building called the Parlement House is still to be seen in  Rhuddlan  probably the place where the king sat in council From hence he actually practised the wellknown deceit of giving them a prince born among them who never spoke a word of  English  and whose life and conversation no man was able to stain  Powel    all which our discontented nobility eagerly accepted little thinking the person intended to be the infant  Ed∣ward  just born at  Caernarvon  THE bridge consists of two arches  BRIDGE  It appears to have been rebuilt or repaired in that date with the arms of  St Asaph  and the initials of  William Hughes  the bishop of that time being cut in the battlements The tides flow very little higher than this place and bring up to the bridge slats or vessels of about seventy tons The port of these parts is about three miles further at the  vorryd  or  great ford  where the river dis∣charges itself into the sea and from whence much corn and tim∣ber is exported  THE house called the  Gwindy  or Wine House  GWINDY  must not be for∣gotten There are few towns in  Wales  which have not one of that name but the use has long been lost In old times  most gentlemen's houses had one in their neighborhood where they met their friends and retainers to  ymgampio  or to exert feats of activity Here the gentleman kept a wine cellar which he retailed for his own profit Here they passed the day in archery wrestling throwing the sledge and other manly exercises At first the drinking was moderate but at length the purpose was abused and these places were made the sanctuary for all sorts of crimes committed by the dependents or friends of the owner of the  Gwindy  who were recommended to his care and there  Llawruddion  ie persons who came  redhanded  from a murder were protected till composition could be made for their crimes  THE church is dedicated to  St Mary  CHURCH  It has nothing re∣markable about it except an antient gravestone with a flowery cross and sword the last the mark of the gentility of the person interred The patronage of this church was granted in to the see of  St Asaph  in recompence for the loss of that of  Eglwys∣vach  which had been taken from it and bestowed on the abby of  Conway  Willis's St Asaph    Rot Walliae      THE priory of blackfriers stood about half a mile south of the castle There is a fragment which bears the marks of antiquity the rest is disguised in the form of a farmhouse and barn We do not know the time of its foundation but it was certainly be∣fore the conquest by  Edward  I as  Anian  or  Eineon de Schonan  a friar of this house was made bishop of  St Asaph  in It suffered much in the wars between  Edward  and  Llewelyn  but soon recovered its losses towards which they were allowed  l    s  Rymer  ii  besides a grant of a fishery on the  Clwyd  with one net free from any obstruction  Rot Walliae    On the dissolution the house was granted to  Harry ap Harry  and now belongs to  John Davies  esq  of  Llanerch  NEAR this place were certain lands called  Nunneland  and  St Marieland  Sebright MSS  but whether they had reference to any house of fe∣male religious I cannot say  THE hospital which existed in stood between the town and  Bodyryddan  As soon as  Edward  I had finished the fortifications of  Rhuddlan  and filled his new town with inhabitants he and bishop  Anian  II made different petitions to the pope to remove the see of  St Asaph  to this place  Rymer  ii  Willis's St Asaph    They urged the solitude and insecurity of the former its hazard from  banditti  and the danger to which the body of the most glorious confessor  St Asaph  was continually exposed and the king in particular adds the great safety of this place by reason of the vast works he had completed But these petitions never took effect frustrated either by the death of the pope or the exhortion of the archbishop of  Canterbury  to rebuild the cathedral on its antient site  A LITTLE beyond the priory I descended the bank  ST ASAPH  and fording the  Clwyd  soon came in sight of  St Asaph  The handsome exten∣sive bridge the little town and the cathedral mixed with trees form a most agreeable view The place is seated on the slope of a pleasant eminence the cathedral on its summit The  Clwyd  runs on the eastern side the  Elwy  a most turbulent stream on the western and from the last is taken the  British  name of  LlanElwy  The township in which it stands is also called  BrynPaulin  and one part of it  Bron y Wylfa  or the  brow of the watch  from which circumstances as well as the great fitness of the situation between two rivers I cannot but think that it was a place of encampment of  Paulinus  in his way to or from  Mona  ITS ecclesiastical history may be spoken of with more certainty When  Kentigern  bishop of  Glasgow  was driven from his see in he retired into  Wales  and established here a monastery for nine hundred and sixtyfive monks instituted on the same plan with that of  Bangor  part for labor part for prayer  SII  Here he built a church and having won over the  British  prince  Maglo∣cunus  once his violent opponent established here a see and was himself the first bishop Being recalled to  Scotland  he nominated for successor  Asaph  or  Hassaph  a Briton of great piety and good family being grandson of  Pabo pou Prydain  He died in was buried in his cathedral and gave name to the place  THE church was first built of wood but soon after of stone In during the wars of  Henry  III the diocese was destroyed by fire and sword  Matthew Paris    and the bishop who sided with the English obliged to live on alms In  CATHEDRAL  the cathedral was burnt down but ample amends was made to the see by the grant of  Edward  I of lands in  Newmarket Nannerch Dincolyn Cwed y Mynedd  and a rich mineral tract in  Diserth  four hundred and nine acres were given each of which appears at that time to be valued at only  sixpence  Sebright MSS  In the church underwent new misfortunes being burnt by  Owen Glyndwr  together with the palace and ca∣nons houses who strange to say soon after brought over to his party  John Trevor  the injured bishop of the see who was de∣prived on account of his revolt After this the church remained in ruins for eighty years when it was rebuilt by that worthy pre∣late  Richard Redman  The same building still remains hand∣some plain and neat The present dean and chapter are now re∣building out of a fund vested in them for that purpose the choir after the inevitable dilapidations of time in the space of near four hundred years The good imitation of the gothic and the happy copy in the east window of the noble remains in  Tintern  abby will add no small beauty to the church and credit to the idea  THE tombs are very few  TOMBS  Here is one in an episcopal habit supposed to commemorate that munificent bishop  David ap Owen  who died in and in the churchyard near the west door is a plain altar monument of bishop  Isaac Barrow  who de∣parted in and whose pious address I can read without any offence howsoever papistical zealots may think it

prebendaries and seven canons Besides these belong to the church four vicars choral four singingmen four choristers and an organist  THE present palace is not very magnificent The walls are the same with those built by bishop  David ap Owen  restorer of the house in after it had lain in ruins a hundred years  THE diocese comprehends all  Flintshire  excepting  Hawarden  all  Denbighshire  but the deanery of  Dyffrin Clwyd  all  Montgome∣ryshire  excepting seven parishes and the hundreds of  Mowddwie  Penllyn  and  Ideirnion  in  Meirionyddshire  and trespasses a little even on  Shropshire  The number of livings are a hundred and thirty of which all except seven  Viz Holywell  Flintshire  Kevedoc alias St George  Denbighshire  Kin∣nersley Oswestry Knocking Whittington Selattin  Sal  p  are in the patronage of the bishop as is the valuable deanery  THE road from  St Asaph  along the common called the  Row  is extremely beautiful is watered by the  Elwy  which runs be∣neath lofty banks finely wooded at its extremity is  Pont yr allt Gôch  a noble bridge of one lofty arch eightyfive feet in dia∣meter The  Elwy  here takes another direction running west and then north along most romantic dingles varied with meadows woods and cavernous rocks neither is it destitute of antiquities  Y fynnon vair  or our lady's well a fine spring inclosed in an angu∣lar wall formerly roofed and the ruins of a crossshaped cha∣pel finely overgrown with ivy exhibit a venerable view in a deep wooded bottom not remote from the bridge and this in days of pilgrimage the frequent haunt of devotees  THE most capital view of these picturesque glens  PENCRAIG  is from  Pen∣craig  on the grounds of Mrs  Jones  of  Galtvaenan  from whence is a sight of three at once together with an unspeakable variety of other objects extremely worthy a visit from every traveller  AT  Llannerch  the chief seat of my kinsman  John Davies  esq  formerly called  Lleweni Vechan  about half a mile to the east of the bridge I stopped a while to admire the charming view of the vale of  Clwyd  with the magnificent boundary between it and  Flintshire  The intervening plain is of matchless fertility inclo∣sures creep high up the hills the remaining part is divided into  various summirs in the season glowing to the setting sun with the purple flowers of the heath Churches and neat mansions en∣liven the scene From  TremeirchionGreen  placed high above  Llannerch  is a very fine view of the whole vale of the western  oundary and the lofty tract of  Snowdon  The middle from end to end is enriched with towns and castles among which rises supreme the rock of  Denbigh  topped with its great fortress  IN  Tremeirchion  church is the mutilated tomb of Sir  Robert Pounderling  before mentioned By his crossed legs it seems he had attained the merit of pilgrimage to the holy sepulchre  UNDER a handsome gothic arch lies  DAFYDD DDU  in priestly vestments well executed the image of  Dafydd Ddu  or the black of Hirad∣dug Underneath is inscribed  Hic jacet  DAVID AP RODERIC AP MADOC He was vicar of this place and dignitary of  St Asaph  prophet and poet and had a great concern in regulating our prosody The  Daroganen  or prophecies of  Robin Ddu  so cele∣brated in  North Wales  I believe properly belong to  Dafydd  who flourished in above a hundred years before the time of  Robin  IN this church stood a cross celebrated for its miracles which are celebrated in an  owdwl  or poem about the year by  Gryffydd ap Isan ap Llen vychan  The cross is now demolished but the carved capital is still to be seen in a building adjoining to the churchyard  IN the bottom not far from  Tremerchion  lies half buried in woods the singular house of  Bachegraig  It consists of a mansion and three sides inclosing a square court The first consists of a vast hall and parlour the rest of it rises into six wonderful sto∣ries  including the cupola and forms from the second floor the figure of a pyramid the rooms small and inconvenient The bricks are admirable and appear to have been made in  Holland  and the model of the house was probably brought from  Flanders  where this species of building was not unfrequent The country people say that it was built by the devil in one night and that the architect still preserves an apartment in it but Sir  Richard Clough  an eminent merchant in the reign of queen  Elizabeth  seems to have a better title to the honor The initials of his name are in iron on the front with the date and on the gateway that of  SIR  Richard  was a man of distinguished character who raised himself by his merit from a poor boy at  Denbigh  to one of the greatest merchants of his time He was first a chorister at  Chester  Puller  's Br Worthies  Flintshire  p  then had the good fortune to become apprentice to the famous Sir  Thomas Gresham  and afterwards his partner His re∣sidence was chiefly at  Antwerp  where his body was interred his heart in  Whichurch  a neighbouring church He is said to have made a pilgrimage to  Jerusalem  and to have been made knight of the  holy sepulchre  this is confirmed for he assumed the five crosses the badge of that order for his arms  Salusbury Pe  gree    His wealth was so great that  Ese a aeth yn Glough  or  He is become a  CLOUGH grew into a proverb on the attainment of riches by any person He left two daughters one he bestowed with this house and certain tythes in  Llein  on  Roger Salusbury  a younger son of  Llewenni  the other on a  Wynne  of  Melay  with whom he gave  the abby of  Maenan  Sir  Richard  meditated great things for the advantage of his country he designed to make the  Clwyd  navi∣gable from  Rhuddlan  to have introduced commerce and to have made the sides of his court the magazines from which he was to dispense his imports to the neighboring parts  IN front of the house cross the  Clwyd  on  Pont y Cambull  and turning to the left cross it again at  Pont Gryffydd  in order to search in the parish of  Bodfari  for the antient  Varis  Soon enter the deep pass formed by nature in the  Clwydian  hills from the vales into the county of  Flint  But neither my own examination or that of some intelligent friends availed any thing The sole remaining antiquity is  British  a post on a hill to the left called  Moel y Gaer  or the hill of the camp The beauty of the ride makes amends for the disappointment The vale is narrow fer∣tile diversified with groves and watered by the crystal  Wheeler  The part about  Maes mynan  is singularly fine consisting of de∣tached hills cloathed with timber a charming extent of mea∣dows and the lofty mountain  Moel y pare  skirted with trees contrasting itself to the softer part of the scenery This place is at present the property of Sir  Roger Mostyn  purchased by one of his family from the  Messies  a name which represented the county of  Flint  as early as the first of queen  Mary  Willis  's Not Parliam ii part and  This place has been called  Llys Maes Mynan  or the palace of  Maes Mynan  where  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  last prince of  Wales  resided in a house whose foundations till within these few years were to be seen in an adjacent meadow  Hy  Gwedir      BUT there is no part of this vale that furnished me with the lest vestige of the  Roman  station  Varis  mentioned by  Antonine  in his eleventh  Iter  and placed at nineteen or twentyone miles distant from  Conovium  or  Caerhên  for there appears an uncer∣tainty in the reading  QUIT the turnpike road on the left ford the  Wheler  and after crossing the  Clwyd  reach  Lleweni  On this spot is said to have resided about the year  Marchweithian  one of the fifteen tribes or nobility of  North Wales  At present it is the seat of the honorable  Thomas Fitzmaurice  lately purchased by him from Sir  Robert Salusbury Cotton  baronet of  CumbermereAbby  in  Cheshire  That gentleman possessed this place by the marriage of his an∣cestor Sir  Robert Cotton  with  Hester  sister to Sir  John Salusbury  the last baronet of his name in the time of  Charles  II The  Salusburies  were an  English  family settled here before the time of  Henry  III Several of the portraits were transferred with the estate to the present owner and preserved in the magnificent old hall Sir  John Salusbury the Strong  SIR JOHN SALUSBURY  is represented on board a half length with short dusky hair beardless in a yellow figured jac∣ket a vast ruff and one hand on his sword dated aet He succeeded to the estate on the execution of his elder brother  Thomas  I SIR THOMAS  who suffered in for his concern in  Babington  's plot A picture supposed to be his is to be seen here representing him in a grey and black vest dark hair short whiskers bushy beard and with an earring his bonnet in his hand his breast naked  SIR  Henry  SIR HENRY  the first baronet is placed sitting in his shirt his bosom naked over one arm is cast a red mantle his breeches red with points at his knees his stockings purple his slippers  rich in lace his beard bushy his whiskers small he is seated in a balcony as if at his toilet I have seen here a fine picture of his eldest son Sir  Thomas  II SIR THOMAS  as much distinguished by his pen as his sword He appears as if on the point of quitting his family to join the army for he was a distinguished loyalist in the time of  Charles  I He is taking leave of his lady and three children is dressed in a buff surtout brown boots with a rich scymetar by his side attended by two grehounds a groom dressed in a long canvas gown holding a horse with the arms of the house on the man's shoulders by way of badge This gentleman was edu∣cated at  Jesus College Oxford  and having as  Wood  Athen Oxon  ii  says a na∣tural geny to poetry and romance exercised himself much in those juvenile studies and produced from his pen the  History of Joseph  in  English  verse in thirteen chapters He retired to  Lleweni  and died in  I MUST not omit the portrait of a lady  CATHERINE Y BERAIN  exceedingly celebrated in this part of  Wales  the famous  Catherine Tudor  better known by the name of  Catherine  of  Berain  from her seat in this neigh∣borhood She was daughter and heiress of  Tudor ap Robert Fychan  of  Berain  she took for her first husband  John Salusbury  heir of  Lleweni  and on his death gave her hand to Sir  Richard Clough  The tradition goes that at the funeral of her beloved spouse she was led to church by Sir  Richard  and from church by  Morris Wynne  of  Gwedir  who whispered to her his wish of being her second she refused him with great civility informing him that she had accepted the proposals of Sir  Richard  in her way to  church but assured him and was as good as her word that in case she performed the same sad duty which she was then about to the knight he might depend on being her third From this match I have the honor of some of  Catherine  's blood in my veins As soon as she had composed this gentleman to shew that she had no superstition about the number THREE she concluded with  Ed∣ward Thelwal  of  Plas y Ward  esq  departed this life  August  and was interred at  Llanivydd  on the st of  September    HER portrait is an excellent threequarters on wood The plate represents the dress By the date it seems to have been painted by  Lucas de Heere  the only artist which I know of in that period equal to the performance I was told that in the locket she wore to the gold chain was the hair of her second and favorite husband  Lleweni  notwithstanding it lies on a flat has most pleasing views of the mountains on each side of the vale the town and castle of  Denbigh  form most capital objects at the distance of two miles and the nearer environs of the place promise to animate die country by the commercial spirit of their active master  David  brother of our last  Llewelyn  makes great complaints of the havock made by  Reginald de Grey  justice of  Chester  in cutting down his wood of  Lleweni  Powel    which  David  probably held as lord of  Denbigh  ABOUT a mile and a half west of this house visit the church of  Whitchurch  or  St Marcellus

was interred beneath Be∣hind him are nine sons behind her seven daughters He died in she in His virtues are rehearsed in the following quaint lines  In vayn we bragg and boast of blood in vayne of

upright hand  SEVERAL of the sons were men of distinguished characters The third  William  was a sea captain and an eminent poet His early education was at  Oxford  but his military turn led him abroad where he signalized himself as soldier and sailor He translated the psalms into  Welsh  metre and finished them on  Jan  th  apud  Scutum  insulam occidentalium Indorum  which as well as his  Barddoniaeth  or art of  Welsh  poetry were published in  London  the first in the other in  Athen Oxon  i  It is sayed that he with captain  Thomas Price  of  Plâsyollin  and one captain  Koet  were the first who smoked or as they called it drank tobacco pub∣lickly in  London  and that the  Londoners  flocked from all parts to see them  Sebright MSS  Pipes were not then invented so they used the  twisted leaves or  segars  The invention is usually ascribed to Sir  Walter Raleigh  It may be so but he was too good a courtier to smoke in public especially in the reign of  James  who even condescended to write a book against the practice under the title of  The Counterblast to Tobacco  Thomas  the fourth son became lord mayor of  London  and was the founder of the family of  Chirkcastle  It is recorded that having married a young wife in his old age the famous song of  Room for cuckolds here comes my lord mayor  was invented on the occasion  Myddelton Pedigree MS    Charles  the fifth son succeeded his father in the government of  Denbigh  castle  I NOW speak of the sixth son  Hugh  a person whose useful life would give lustre to the greatest family This gentleman after∣wards Sir  Hugh  displayed very early his great talents and began as we are told by himself by searching for coal within a mile of his native place His attempt did not meet with success his genius was destined to act on a greater stage The Capital af∣forded him ample space for his vast attempts few readers need be told that he planned and brought to perfection the great de∣sign of supplying the city with water This plan was meditated in the reign of  Elizabeth  but no one was found bold enough to attempt it In the dauntless WELSHMAN stept forth and SMOTE THE ROCK and on  Michaelmas  the waters flowed into the thirsting metropolis He brought it in defiance of hills and vallies reckoning every winding near thirtynine miles conveyed it by aqueducts in some places in others pierced the  high grounds and gave it a subterraneous course He was a true prototype of the later genius of similar works but he sacrificed private fortune to the public good Two thousand pounds a month which he gained from the  Cardiganshire  mines were swallowed up in this river  Fodina Regales    He received the empty honor of seeing himself attended by the king his court and all the corpo∣ration of  London  among whom was his brother designed mayor for the ensuing year The waters gushed out in their presence and the great architect received their applause and knighthood and in the title of baronet His own fair fortune being expended on an undertaking which now brings in to the pro∣prietors an amazing revenue he was reduced to become a hireling surveyor and was eminently useful in every place where draining or mining was requisite I shall have occa∣sion to speak of some other of his labors in the course of this book He died in  Myddelton Pedegree MS  Sir  Myddelton  the last baronet of this branch of the family died a few years ago The present representative is a widow in distressful circumstances Sir  Hugh  left a certain number of shares to the  Goldsmith  's company to be divided among the poor members but as the husband of this poor woman happened not to be of the company the repre∣sentative of the greatest benefactor  London  ever had is I trust through ignorance of her case permitted to linger away her days in cruel penury  A MURAL monument needlessly attempts to preserve the me∣mory of that great antiquary  HUMPHREY LLWYD  Humphrey Llwyd  He is repre∣sented in a  Spanish  dress kneeling at an altar beneath a range of  small arches above a multitude of quarterings proclame his long descent He derived himself from the  Rosendales  of the north who settled at  Foxhall  in this neighborhood in by marriage with the heiress of the place He himself was of a branch which fixed at  Denbigh  He was educated at  Oxford  a commoner of  Brazennose  college and master of arts He re∣turned to his native place an accomplished gentleman He stu∣died at the university the healing art but is celebrated as a per∣son of great eloquence an excellent rhetorician and sound philo∣sopher After the panegyric passed on him by  Cambden  it would be presumptious to add any thing relative to his great skill in the antiquities of our country He practised for his amusement physic and music The motto on his portrait in possession of his representative  John Lloyd  of  Aston  esq  expresses his liberal turn of mind  Hwy pery klod Nagolyd  FAME IS BETTER THAN WEALTH In medicine and the study of antiquities he has left several proofs of his knowlege which seems to have been quite unconfined He made the map of  England  for his friend  Ortelius  For his

British Museum  Grainger  i For the history of his works see  Athen Oxon  i  In his last letter to the great geo∣grapher  Ortelius  Prefixed to his  Commentarioli Britannicae descriptionis fragmentum

year and day of her departure  A LITTLE further stands  Denbigh  placed like  Sterling  on the slope of a great rock crowned with a castle Its antient  British  name was  Castell Kled vryn yn Rhôs  or the Craggy Hill in  Rhos  the former name of the tract in which it is seated The word  Dinbech  the present  Welsh  appellation signifies a small hill which it is comparative to the neighboring mountains The first time I find any mention of it is in the beginning of the reign of  Edward  I from whom  David  in defiance of his brother  Llewelyn  chose to hold this lordship together with the cantred of  Dyffryn Clwyd  R  tu  ae Walliae    He made it his residence till the conquest of our country soon after which he was taken near the place and car∣ried loaden with irons to the  English  monarch at  Rhuddlan  THE king politically secured his new acquisitions by bestowing several of the great lordships on his followers He gave that of  Denbigh  to  Henry Lacy  earl of  Lincoln  who built the castle and inclosed within a wall the small town he found there Among other priveleges he gave his vassals liberty of killing and destroy∣ing all manner of wild beasts on the lordship except in certain parts reserved out of the grant I suppose for the purpose of the particular amusement of the lord  Sebright  MSS  for I find in the reign of  Henry  VI the names of five parks in this lordship viz  Moylewike Caresnodooke Kylford Bagh  a  ̄  and  Posey  of which the king consti∣tuted  Owen Tudor  ranger On the death of  Lacy  the lordship passed to  Thomas  earl of  Lancaster  by virtue of his marriage with  Alicia  daughter of the last possessor After the attainder of  Tho∣mas Edward  II bestowed it on  Hugh D'Espencer  who proved an oppressive superior and abridged the inhabitants of the priveleges granted to them by  Lacy  The same  By the fatal end of that favorite it fell again to the crown and was given by  Edward  III to ano∣ther equally unfortunate  Roger Mortimer  earl of  March  whose death enabled the king to invest with this lordship  William Moun∣tacute  earl of  Salusbury  He died in and on the reversal of the attainder of the earl of  March  it was restored to his family in the perfon of his grandson  Roger  and by the marriage of  Anne  sister to another  Roger  last earl of  March  with  Richard Plantagenet  earl of  Cambridge  it came into the house of  York  and so into the crown Queen  Elizabeth  in bestowed it as a most valuable gift on her unmerited minion  Robert Dudley  earl of  Leicester  who soon made the country feel the weight of his oppression Notwithstanding the tenants made him a present of  two thousand pounds at his first entrance into the lordship he re∣mained unsatisfied he constrained the freeholders to raise the old rents of  l  a year to or  l  Secret Memoirs of  Robert  earl of  Leicester    and at his will inclosed the waste lands to the injury of the tenants who offended at his ra∣pacity arose and levelled his encroachments This was con∣strued into riot and rebellion two hopeful young men of the house of  Lleweni  were taken to  Shrewsbury  tried and executed there for the pretended offence He had the insolence even to mortgage the manor to some merchants of  London  Strife's Annals  ii  and I ap∣prehend tricked them for their credulity The various disor∣ders which rose from these practices were so great that  Eliza∣beth  interposed and by charter confirmed the quiet possession of the tenants and allayed the discontents  Baron  Price  's Speech  These were again excited in die reign of king  William  by the vast grant made to the earl of  Portland  The same ferments arose and the same means were used to allay them at present this and the other great manors of  Bromefield  and  Yale  remain in the crown and are peacefully superintended by a steward appointed by the king  THE castle and inclosed part of the town took up a very consi∣derable space and were defended by strong walls and towers the last are chiefly square There are two gates to the outmost pre∣cinct that called the  Burgesses Tower  GATES  is large square and built singularly with small ashler stones The other was called the  Exchequer Gate  in which the lord's court was kept Some few houses with most beautiful views are at present inhabited in this  part  Leland  says that there had been divers rows of streets but in his time there were scarcely eighty housholders within these walls Here stands the chapel called  St Hillary's  formerly be∣longing to the garrison now the place of worship for the town In old times on every Sunday here were masses for the souls of  Lacy  and  Percy  Leland  ITIN v  Not far from it are the remains of an unfi∣nished church a hundred and seventyfive feet long and seventyone broad and designed to have been supported by two rows of pillars This noble building was begun in as appears by the date on a foundationstone It was to this purpose for at present it is much defaced

sacerdos est verus homo  G A  Copied from Dr  Foulk  's Papers among Mr  Mytton  's MSS  THIS church was begun under the auspices of  Leicester  CHURCH  but it is said that he left off his buildings in  Wales  by reason of the public hatred he had incurred on account of his tyranny  Memoirs  A sum was afterwards collected in order to complete the work  but it is said that when the earl of Essex passed through  Denbigh  on his  Irish  expedition he borrowed the money destined for the purpose which was never repayed and by that means the church was left unfinished  Dr  Foulk  's Papers    THE Castle crowns the summit of the hill  CASTLE  one side of which is quite precipitous The entrance is very magnificent beneath a gothic arch over which is the statue of  Henry Lacy  sitting in stately flowing robes On each side of the gateway stood a large octagonal tower The breaches in it are vast and awful they serve to discover the antient manner of building a double wall appears to have been built with a great vacancy between into which was poured all forts of rubbish stone and hot mortar which time consolidated to a stony hardness This part as  Leland  says was never completed the work having been deserted by the earl on the loss of his eldest son who was accidentally drowned in the well whose opening is still to be seen in the castleyard  Charles  I lay here on the d of  September  after his retreat from  Chester  in a tower still called  Siamber y Brenbin  or the  King's Tower  THE prospect through the broken arches is extremely fine ex∣tending in parts over the whole vale and all its eastern hills from  Moel Venlli  to  Diserth  rock a rich view but deficient in water the river  Clwyd  being too small to be seen and in great rains so furious as to overflow a great space of the meadowy tract  LELAND relates a particular of this fortress which I do not dis∣cover in any other historian he says that  Edward  IV was be∣sieged in it and that he was permitted to retire on condition  DENBIGH CASTLE  that he should quit the kingdom for ever The only time in which that prince was constrained to abdicate his dominions was in when he took shipping at  Lynn  not by reason of any capitulation with his enemies but through the desperate situation of his affairs at that period  fasper Tudor  earl of  Pembroke  had in the year possessed this place and several others in the principality in behalf of his weak halfbrother  Henry  VI  Dugdale Baron  ii  but they were wrested from him by the  Yorkists  in the following year In he returned was joined by two thousand  Welsh  and burnt the town  Carte ii  meditating rather revenge than conquest  IN the beginning of  November  the parlement army ob∣tained near this town a most important victory over the royalists The latter  BATTLE  under the command of Sir  William Vaughan  had formed a considerable body of forces  Welsh  and  Irish  with a de∣sign of marching to the relief of  Chester  then besieged Sir  Wil∣liam Brereton  had notice of the design and immediately detached that able officer  Mytton  and under him colonel  Jones  and colonel  Louthian  with one thousand four hundred horse and a thousand foot to frustrate the plan  Mytton  did his duty attacked the royalists with vigor and after several hot engagements totally routed them took five hundred horse and four hundred foot killed one hundred and so entirely dispersed them as not to leave a hundred together in one place  Whitelock      In  SIEGE  we find the castle garrisoned by the loyalists its go∣vernor  was colonel  William Salusbury  of  Bachymbyd  commonly called  Salusbury Hosandu Gleisiau  or  Blue Stockings  The siege was begun under the conduct of majorgeneral  Mytton  about the th of  July  Whitelock    but such was the gallant defence of the besieged that it was not surrendered till the d of  November  and then only on the most honorable conditions  The same For the Articles of Capitulation see  Appendix  It is very remarkable that notwithstanding the orders of fallen majesty in  June  for the ge∣neral surrender of every garrison in  England  and  Wales  on fair and honorable terms yet the first which yielded in  North Wales  held out above two months longer than the last  English  castle  THE priory of  Carmelites  PRIORY  or  White Friars  stood at the bottom of the town It was founded by  John Salusbury  of  Lleweni  who died as appeared from a mutilated brass found in the conventual church on the th of  March    Collin's Baronets  Edit i    Speed  ascribes the building to one  John de Sunimore  in but the inscription fixes the honor on  Salusbury  On the dissolution this house was granted to  Richard Andreas  and  William L'Isle  The church now con∣verted into a barn is the only remaining building it was the buryingplace of the family of the founder till the reformation and some of their tombs were to be seen here within memory of man  THE present town covers great part of the slope of the hill  TRADE  and some streets extend along the plain Its manufactures in shoes and gloves are very considerable and great quantities are  annually sent to  London  to the great warehouses of the Capital and for the purposes of exportation  THE constitution of this borough and its origin will be fully explained by the following transcript communicated to me by one of its burgesses It begins with citing the last charter  CHARTER  which is that granted by king  Charles  II which recites letters patent granted by queen  Elizabeth  and dated at  Westminster  the th of  June  in the thirtyninth year of her reign in which the said queen recites "That seeing  Edward  I by his letters patent dated at  Northampton  the th of  August  in the eighteenth year of his reign hath granted to  Henry de Lacy  earl of  Lincoln  that all his men then inhabiting his town of  Denbigh  or that should for ever inhabit it through all his territories formerly belonging to the king of  Wales  and also through

year who  had the courage to withstand the insinuations the promises and the threats of as unprincipled a lord as this kingdom was ever afflicted with who had power to inflict and will to execute any vengeance that opposition to his arbitrary inclinations might excite In that year it was his pleasure that one  Henry Dynne  should represent this borough in parlement the burgesses were refractory and chose another person which gave rise to the fol∣lowing letter which I print as a  sans pareille  A L  re  sent from the earle of  Leicester  to the bayliffe aldermen and burgesses greatlie

expressly forbidden to meddle in matters of state or in causes ecclesiastical  Drake's Parliam Hist  iv  and this was the GOLDEN REIGN of ELIZABETH  FROM  Denbigh  I went to the hospitable house of  Gwaenynog  about two miles distant fronted by the most majestic oaks in our principality The fine wooded dingles belonging to the demesne are extremely well worth visiting they are most judiciously cut into walks by the owner  John Myddelton  esq  and afford as beautiful scenery in their kind as any we have to boast  Moel Vamma  superbly terminates one view and the ruins of  Denbigh Castle  burst awfully at the termination of the concluding path  IN rummaging over the family papers of this house I met with an anecdote of it too singular to be suppressed It will prove at left that private morals and respect to the laws were in that distant period but in a very low state for no notice seems to have been taken of so atrocious an offence The criminal en∣joyed the favor of the crown in common with others its peaceful subjects  David Myddelton  who is styled receiver of  Denbigh  in the nine∣teenth of  Edward  IV and  Valectus Coronae D  ni  Regis  in the second  of Richard  III made his addresses to  Elyn  daughter of Sir  John Done  of  Utkinton  in  Cheshire  and gained the lady's affections but the parents preferred their relation  Richard Done  of  Croton  The marriage was accordingly celebrated which  David  having notice of watched the groom leading his bride out of church  killed him on the spot and then carried away his mistress and married her the same day so that she was a maid widow and wife twice in one day From  Roger  the eldest son of the match descended the  Myddeltons  of this place  I MENTION  Thomas Myddelton  another of his progeny only to prove that the custom of the  Irish  howl or  Scotch Coranich  was in use among us for we are told he was buried  cum magno dolore et clamore cognatorum et propinquorum omnium  HAVING made  Gwaenynog  my head quarters for this neighbor∣hood I one day visited from thence  Henllan  the parish church of these parts remarkable for the schism between church and steeple the first having retreated into the bottom the last maintains its sta∣tion on the top of the hill The church is covered with shingles a species of roof almost obsolete  St Sadwrn  or  St Saturnus  cotem∣porary to  St Wenefrede  has it under his protection Here was interred Sir  Peter Mutton  knight descended from  Richard Mutton  of  Rhuddlan  and  Elen  daughter to  John Aer Hên Conway  of  Bod∣rhyddan  Sir  Peter  as his epitaph informs us was chief justice of  North Wales  a matter in chancery prothonatory and clerk of the crown He died  November  the th He had the ho∣nor of representing the borough of  Caernarvon  and once occa∣sioned much diversion to the house by asserting in one of his speeches "that he remembered fourteen years  before  he was he was born c c" But he was a good judge made a fair fortune and by marriage acquired the estate of  Llanerch  which passed with his daughter to  Robert Davies  of  Gwysaney  esq  ancestor of the present owner  NOT far from  Henllan  church in the parish of  Llannefydd  on  the bank of the brook  Meirchion  are the remains of a seat of  Me∣reddydd ap Meirchion  or  Merach y Meirch  lord of  Isdulas  Part is now standing particularly the chapel which serves for a farm∣house but some very extensive foundations shew its former im∣portance  FROM hence after a ride of a few miles I reached  Dyffryn Al∣led  or the vale of the river  Alled  a very narrow tract bounded by high hills and of late ornamented by the magnificent seat built by Mrs  Meyric  At the head of the valley stand the village and church of  Llansannan  dedicated to  St Sannan  confessor and hermit descended for our very saints boast of their pedegree from antient parentage near the territory of the father of  St We∣nefrede  with whom he maintained strict friendship Their re∣mains were both enterred at  Gwytherin  to which place though unworthy I resolved on an immediate pilgrimage  IN my way I descended a very steep wooded dell in the town∣ship of  Penared  to visit the gloomy cataract of  Llyn yr ogo  where the  Alled  tumbles into a horrible black cavern overshaded by oaks Somewhat higher up is another exposed to full day falling from a vast height and dividing the naked glen  LlynAlled  the small lake from which the river flows lies at a small distance amidst black and heathy mountains through which runs much of the road to  Gwytherin  THAT little village and church stand on a bank at the head of a small vale near the rise of the  Elwy  The church is celebrated for the honor of having first received the remains of  St Winefrede  ST WINEFREDE  after her second death On the decease of  St Beuno  she was warned by a voice to call on  St Deifer  at  Bodvari  by  St Deifer  she was directed to go to  St Saturnus  at  Henllan  and by  St Sa∣turnus  to seek a final retreat with  St Elerius  at  Gwytherin  Hi∣ther she repaired found a convent of nuns received the veil from the saint and on the death of the abbess  Theonia  succeeded to the high charge  St Wenefrede  died on the d of  November  and rested here in quiet near the body of her predecessor for the space of five hundred years By reason of a miracle wrought as was supposed by her intercession on a monk of  Shrewsbury  the abbot determined on the translation of her remains to their mo∣nastery  HER REMAINS TRANSLATED  Seven holy men were deputed the inhabitants of  Gwytherin  refused to part with such a treasure visions deter∣mined the former to persist in their request and at length on the declaration of the will of heaven by another vision to the parson of  Gwytherin  who declared to his flock the impiety of far∣ther resistance the reliques were delivered up and carried with triumph to their place of destination  This and much more may be seen in the Life of  St Winefrede  pp c  The prior at this time was  Robert  Mr  William Mytton  Antiquities of  Shropshire  folio MS  calls him  Pennant  If he was of the neighborhood of  Holywell  I do not wonder he was so anxious about the remains of his countrywoman which he knew could not fail enriching his house by virtue of the miraclecraft so frequent in that age  IN the church is shewn the box in which her reliques were kept before their removal to  Shrewsbury  Here is also an antient grave∣stone with a flowery cross and  chalice  the last denoting the  priestly profession of the deceased with  Hic jacet Llowarch Mab Cadell  inscribed on the cross  THE Saint's Chapel  Capell Gwenfrewi  is now totally destroyed it stood on the south side of the church but nothing remains except some slight ditches and foundations  ON the north side of the churchyard stand four rude upright stones On one is rudely cut an inscription for which I refer to the supplemental plates  IN my return I followed the course of the  Elwy  by  Havodynos  the seat of  Howel Lloyd  esq  by the church and village of  Llangerniew  by  Garthewin  the seat of  Robert Wynn  esq  command∣ing a most lovely view of a

will not grow indignant when I ex∣press my fears that in very early times we were as fierce and sa∣vage as the rest of  Europe  and they will bear this the better when they reflect that they keep pace with it in civilization and in the progress of every fine art We cannot deny but that we were to the excess  Jealous in honor sudden and quick in quarrel  Two gentlemen of this house exemplify the assertion  RUDE TIMES  Meiric ap Bleyddyn  resentful of the injuries which he and his tenants re∣ceived from the  English  judges and officers slew one of the first and hanged several of the latter on

painted glass ex∣pressing  a favorite subject of the time the root of  Jesse  The pa∣triarch is represented sprawling at the bottom with a genealogi∣cal tree issuing out of him containing all the kings of  Israel  and  Juda  up to our SAVIOUR The branches around the kings are in very beautiful foliage at the top is a rose of  Lancaster  and ano∣ther with an eye in glory within it the window

to great advantage with its walls and towers extending along its precipitous base  AT the foot of this rising is  Fynnon Ddysnog  a fine spring de∣dicated to  St Ddysnog  one of our long pedegreed faints for∣merly much resorted to by votaries The fountain is inclosed in an angular wall decorated with small human figures and before is the well for the use of the pious bathers  NEAR this are some comfortable almshouses for eight widows founded by Mrs  Jones  of  Llanrhaider  a  Bagot  in and each has her garden and two shillings a week  HERE the diocese of  Bangor  encroaches on that of  St

trees  CHESNUT TREES  one of which is near twentyfour feet in circumference The reader need not be told that this species of trees is not a native of  Great Britain  nor even of  Europe  We are indebted for it to the  Romans  who probably first planted it in  Kent  where it has been fo fully naturalized as to form in certain tracts great woods in other parts of the kingdom it every where

seen mixed with the native rock which in parts served as a facing to the fortress whose lower part was formed out of it a very deep foss hewen out of the live stone with a portal at each end divides it breadthways Honest  Churchyard  with great truth and simplicity thus describes the work  This castle stands on rocke much like red bricke  The dykes are cut with toole throughe stonie cragge  The towers are hye the walles are large and thicke  The worke itself would shake a subject's bagge  A DRAWING I discovered in the  British Museum  shews that it soared high above the ground and that its numerous towers well merited the poet's praise  THE views from the summit of the ruins are very well worthy of the traveller's attention If he is fond of a more aerial one I would by all means have him ascend the heights of  Bwlch pen y Barras  from whence is a full prospect of our boasted vale and the remote hills of our  Alpine  tract  THE  Welsh  name of the fortress is  Castell Côch yn Gwernvor  Llwyd's Itin  MS iii  Possibly our countrymen had here a stronghold before the time of  Edward  I who built the castle whose ruins we survey  Rotulae Walliae    and bestowed it in with the cantred of  Dyffryn Clwyd  on  Regi∣nald de Grey  for which he did homage at  Chester  to  Edward  of  Caernarvon  then prince of  Wales  The king added at the same time the townships of  Maesmynnan Pembedw  and  Blowite  as de∣pendencies on the castle and I ought to add the land of  Wenchal de Lacy  Out of this antient cantred was formed the present lordship of  Ruthin  which comprehends several parishes It re∣mained in the family of the  Greys  till the time of  Richard  earl of  Kent  who having dissipated his fortune by gaming sold it to  Henry  VII Queen  Elizabeth  bestowed it on  Ambrose Dudley  earl of  Warwick  and it is now in possession of  Richard Myddelton  esq  of  Chirk Castle  I must observe this lordship was directed by  Edward  the Second to contribute two hundred foot soldiers for his  Scottish  expedition in but in only one man at arms and thirty footmen were required  Rymer  iii iv    THE inhabitants united with those of  Denbigh  and  Holt  send a

a native of  Ruthin  and was greatly distinguished by his various merit As a church∣man he acquired great fame by his translation of the epistle to the  Corinthians  being assistant in the version of the bible into  English  as a philanthropist his foundation of a hospital for twelve poor people and a warden who is the clergyman of the place perpetuates his benevolent turn and his affection to learned men is evident not only by his establishing here a free school for this parish and that of  LlanElidan  with a stipend to the master of sixty pounds a year but by his being the patron of the great  Cambden  Cambden Middlesex  i  whom he enabled to take those travels which produced the finest collection of provincial antiquities ever extant  THE church was originally conventual and belonged to a house of  Bonhommes  Leland Itin  iii  a species of  Augustins  introduced into  England  in but the time of their continuance here could be but very short for in  John  son of  Reginald

twentythree cows and a bull and  pannage  or the free keeping of sixty hogs in the woods of the lordship  Dugdale's Monast  iii pars ii  For these and several other good things the said priests were

chancel and in his days was placed on the right side of the choir  THE apartments of the priests were connected to the church by a cloister part of which is built up and serves as the man∣sion of the warden When  John de Grey  undertook this work he obtained the consent of Sir  Hugh  then rector of  Llanruth  to whom he allows this to have been subordinate by custom as well as right  The same

Eubule  became master of  Jesus College Oxford  I will not tire the reader with the whole family history but must not omit  Ambrose  the ninth son who began life with being servant to Sir  Francis Bacon  and so great a favorite was he that in order to reward him Sir  Francis  moved his royal master to knight all the masters in chancery for which  Ambrose  was to have a gratuity of one hundred pounds a man The affair was done and the money paid except by his brother Sir  Eubule  then one of the masters to whom he remitted the fees  THERE is in the church a monumental bust of  Ambrose

defence consists of a single wall mostly in ruins yet in some parts the facings are still apparent in the thickness of the walls are evident remains of apartments It had two entrances Near the northeastern is an oblong square added to the main works and as the ground there is rather flat it is strengthened with a great ditch and a wall within are the foundations of rude stone buildings one of which is circular and several yards in diameter the ditch is carried much farther than the wall and seems part of an unfinished addition to the whole It is conjec∣tured that  Owen Gwynedd  occupied this post while  Henry  II lay encamped on the  Berwyn  hills on the other side of the vale  Owen Glyndwr  is said also to have made use of this fastness in his occasional retreats  NOT far from hence

the godliest man and greatest clerke in all  Wales  He died in  yet that saint has his well here and is patron of the church  ON the south side of the church wall is cut a very rude cross which is

if the whole had been formed in imitation of and in veneration of the sacred  Cromlehs  of very early time  A MONUMENT of our superstition remains in the  Carreg y Big yn y fach Newlyd  a pointed rude stone which stands near the porch We are told that all attempts to build the church in any other place were frustrated by the influence of certain adverse  powers till the founders warned in vision were directed to the spot where this pillar stood  IN the churchyard is a building founded by  William Eyton  of  Plâs Warren  in  Shropshire  who in left by will a sum for the support of six widows of clergy of the county of  Merioneth  only and for the erecting six houses for them to live in In con∣sequence this building was finished and lands to the present amount of sixty pounds a year bought which is equally divided among the widows resident here  LEAVE  Corwen  and return as far as the bridge on the way I came The vast  Berwyn  mountains are the eastern boundary of this beautiful vale Their highest tops are  Cader Fronwen  or  The White Breast  and  Cader Ferwyn  On the first is a great heap of stones brought from some distant part with great toil up the steep ascent and in their middle is an erect pillar Of him whose ambition climbed this height for a monument we are left in ignorance Under their summit is said to run an artificial road  FFORD HELEN  called  Ffordd Helen  or  Helen's Way  a lady of whose labors I shall soon have occasion to speak further  ON these hills particularly about  Cader Fronwen  is found the  Rubus Chamaemorus  CLOUD BERRIES  Cloud Berries  or  Knot Berries Llwyd  In  Camden's Br  ii  says that the  Welsh  call it  Mwyar Berwyn Mora Montis Berwyn  They are frequently used for the making of tarts and the  Swedes  and  Norwegians  reckon the berries to be excellent antiscorbutics and preserve great quantities in autumn to make tarts The  Laplanders  bruise and eat them as a delicious food in the milk of reindeer and to preserve them through the winter bury  them in snow and at the return of spring find them as fresh as when first gathered  Flora Scotica i  tab xiii  I have seen them in the  Highlands  of  Scotland  brought to table as a desert  REACH  Cynwyd  a small village formerly noted for the courts kept here by the great men of the neighborhood to settle the boundaries of their several clames on the wastes and commons and to take cognizances of the encroachment but they have been long discontinued and the records destroyed  VISIT from this place  Rhaider Cynwyd  WATTERFALL  or the fall of  Cynwyd  which finely finishes the end of the dingle that extends about half a mile from the village The water of the river  Trystion  bursts from the sides of the hill through deep and narrow chasms from rock to rock which are overgrown with wood The rude and antient stocks that hang in many parts over the precipices add much to this picturesque scene which is still improved by the little mill and its inhabitants in this sequestered bottom  PURSUE the journey to  Bala  Go by the little church of  Llangar  Observe somewhat farther on the left in a field called  Caer Bont  CAER BONT  a small circular entrenchment consisting of a foss and rampart with two entrances meant probably as a guard to this pass My fellowtraveller the reverend Mr  Lloyd  informed me that in another tour he had ascended a hill above this place called  Y Foel  on whose summit was a circular coronet of rude pebbly stones none above three feet in height with an entrance to the east or rising sun The diameter of the circle is ten yards Within was a circular cell about six feet in diameter sunk a very little below the surface and about a hundred yards distance  facing this are the reliques of a great  Carnedd  surrounded by large stones The whole of this formed a place of worship among the antient  Britons  and probably was surrounded with a grove But what I have to say on the subject of  Druidism  is re∣served till I reach  Anglesea  its principal seat  PROCEED to  Llandrillo  a village with a church dedicated to  St Trillo  It is seated on the torrent  Keidio  at the mouth of a great glen which extends upwards of two miles embosomed in the  Berwyn  mountains and leads to the noted pass through them called  Milter Gerrig  into the county of  Montgomery  AT about a mile distance from  Llandrillo  I again crossed the  Dee  at  Pont Gilan  a bridge of two arches over a deep and black water Beyond this spot the valley acquires new beauties espe∣cially on the right The valley here contracts greatly the road runs at the foot of a brow of a stupendous height covered with venerable oaks which have kept their stubborn station amidst the rudest of rocks which every now and then shew their grey and broken fronts amidst the deep verdure of the foliage of trees which so strangely find nutriment amongst them The growth of the oak in forcing its root downward frequently rends thse vast strata whose fragments often appear scattered at the base of most amazing sizes The whole scenery requires the pencil of a  Sal∣vator Rosa  and here our young artists would find a fit place to study the manner of that great painter of wild nature  A LITTLE beyond the extremity of this romantic part in an opening on the right  ST DERFEL  stand the church and village of  LlanDder∣fel  the first was dedicated to  St Derfel Gadarn  and was re∣markable for a vast wooden image of the saint the subject of  much superstition in ancient times The  Welsh  had a prophecy that it should set a  whole forest on fire  Whether to complete it or whether to take away from the people the cause of idolatry I cannot say but it was brought to  London  in the year and was used as part of the fuel which consumed poor frier  Forest  to ashes in  Smithfield  for denying the king's supremacy This un∣happy man was hanged in chains round his middle to a gallows over which was placed this inscription allusive to our image  David Darvel Gutheren  As sayth the  Welshman  Fetched outlawes out of Hell  Now is he come with spere and sheld  In harnes to burne in  Smithfeld  For in  Wales  he may not dwel  And  Foreest  the freer  That

consumed to the great content of the lord mayor the dukes of  Suffolk  and  Norfolk  the lord admiral and lord privy seal and di∣vers others of the nobility who honored this  auto de fe  with their presence  Stow's Annals    but unfortunately the frier not having the insensi∣bility  of our wooden saint on the touch of the flames shewed the natural horrors at approach of an agonizing death and payed very little respect to the arguments of the pious  Latimer  who was placed opposite to the sufferer in a pulpit to preach him into a sense of the crime of differing in opinion with his sovereign in re∣ligious matters for which the prelate himself suffered in a suc∣ceeding reign  Forest  thought fit to deny that  Henry  was head of the church and  Latimer  would force that honor upon  Mary  who chose to cede it to the Pope  OPPOSITE to this church is  Llandderfel  bridge of four arches At some distance from it the vale almost closes and at  Kalettur  finishes nobly with a lofty wooded eminence above which soars the vast mafs of the  Arennig  mountains notwithstanding they ap∣pear immediately after to be very remote And I here stop a mo∣ment to recommend to the traveller who does not chuse pre∣cisely to pursue my steps to follow the course of the  Dee  from  Bangor  through the delicious tract it waters from thence to  Llangollen  to follow it through  Glyndwrdwy  to  Corwen  and thence through the matchless vale of  Edeirneon  to this spot where for a small space it passes through a flat an unpleasant contrast to the preceding ride  ON the left lies  Rhiwaedog  or  The Bloody Brow  noted for a battle between  Llowarch  Hên and the  Saxons  in which he lost  Cynddelw  the last of his numerous sons A spot not far from hence called  Pabell Llowarch Hên  or the tent of that monarch is supposed to have been the place where he rested the night after the battle and where he finished that pathetic elegy in which he laments the loss of all his sons In it he directs the last to de∣fend  the brow of that hill indifferent to the fate of the only survivor  CYNDDELW cadw dithew y Rhiu  Arr a ddêl yma heddiw  Cubeb am un mab nyd gwiu  J D Rhys  's Grammar    CYNDDELW

of  William Price  esq  member for the county in the long parlement but soon displaced for his adherence to the king  REACH  Bala  a small town in the parish of  Llanyekil  noted for its vast trade in woollen stockings and its great markets every  Saturday  morning when from two to five hundred pounds worth are sold each day according to the demand Round the place women and children are in full employ  KNITTING  knitting along the roads and mixed with them  Herculean  figures appear assisting their  om∣phales  in this effeminate employ During winter the females through love of society often assemble at one another's houses to knit sit round a fire and listen to some old tale or to some an∣tient song or the sound of a harp and this is called  Cymmorth Gwau  or the knitting assembly  MUCH of the wool is bought at the great fairs at  Llanrwst  in  Denbighshire  CLOSE to the southeast end of the town is a great artificial mount  TOMMEN Y BALA  called  Tommen y Bala  in the summer time usually covered in a picturesque manner with knitters of both sexes and all ages From the summit is a fine view of  Llyntegid  and the adjacent mountains On the right appear the two  Arennigs Vawr  and  Vach  beyond the farther end soar the lofty  Arans  with their two heads  Aran Mowddwy  and  Penllyn  and beyond all the great  Cader Idris  closes the view  THIS mount appears to have been  Roman  and placed here with a castelet on its summit to secure the pass towards the sea and keep our mountaneers in subjection The Welsh in after time took advantage of this as well as other works of the same nature  THE town is of a very regular form the principal street very spacious and the lesser fall into it at right angles I will not deny but that its origin might have been  Roman  THE mounts form a chain I have observed one within sight of this on the mountain road to  Ruthin  which is called  Tommen y Castell Caer Crwyni  is a small entrenchment not remote from it overlooking the vale of  Edeirnion  the mount in the garden of  Rûg  is another a third much more considerable lies within  VIEW FROM TOMMEN Y BALA  sight of this on the road to  Gwyddelwern  and farther on in the parish of Bettws is a fourth which goes under the usual name of  Tommen y Castell  Bala  takes its name from its vicinity to the place where a river discharges itself from a lake  Balloch  in the  Erse  language signi∣fies the same I know little of its antient history any more than it seems to have been dependent on the castle of  Harlech  and that in the reign of  Edward  II it was committed to the care of  Finian de Stanedon  constable of that castle  Sebright MSS  and in the time of  Edward  III his great general  Walter de Manni  was rewarded with the feefarm of  Bala  and  Harlech  and was made sheriff of this county for life  Dugdale Baron  ii  I may add incidentally that  Edward  I gave one  Hugo de Turbervill  liberty of hunting through  Meirio∣nithshire  all kinds of wild beasts  Rotulae Walliae  In P is an order for him to have six stags out of the forest of  Meirionith  while probably the subdued natives were only his Chasseurs  Bala Lake Pimble Mere  LAKS  or  Llyntegid  lies at a small distance from the town and is a fine expanse of water near four miles long and twelve hundred yards broad in the widest place the deepest part is opposite  Bryn Golen  where it is fortysix yards deep with three yards of mud the shores gravelly the bounda∣ries are easy slopes well cultivated and varied with woods In stormy weather its billows run very high and incroach greatly on the northeast end where within memory of man numbers of acres have been lost It rises sometimes nine feet and rains and  winds jointly contribute to make it overflow the fair vale of  Edeirnion  ITS fish are  FISH  pike perch trout a few roach and abundance of eels and shoals of that  Alpine  fish the  Gwyniaid  which spawn in  December  and are taken in great numbers in spring or summer Pike have been caught here of twentyfive pounds weight a trout of twentytwo a perch of ten and a gwyniaid of five Sir  Wat∣kin Williams Wynn  clames the whole fishery of this noble lake It had been the property of the abby of  Basingwerk  for  Owen de Brogynton  made a grant to GOD  St Mary  and the monks of that house of  a certain water in  Penthlinn  called  Thlintegit  or  Pembelmore  and all the pasture of the said land of  Penthlinn  This was witnessed by  Reiner  who was bishop of  St Asaph  from to and by  Ithail Owen  's chaplain  Sebright MSS    THE waters are discharged under  Pont Mwnwgl y Llyn  a bridge of three arches They seem inconsiderable in respect to the size of the streams which feed the lake for the  Dee  does not make in dry seasons the figure I expected Salmon come in plenty to this place but neither do they trespass into the lake and the  gwyniaids  very rarely into the river Report says that the  Dee  passes through the lake from end to end without deigning to mix its waters as the  Rhone  was fabled to serve the lake of Ge∣neva But in fact the  Dee  does not assume its name till it quits its parent  NEAR the west side close to the bridge and just opposite to  Tommen y Bala  stood another castelet not so high but of a more extensive form than that mount It is now broke through by a  public road but is very apparent on both sides The mount or keep was on the lower immediately above the river and the vestiges of a wall are still evident This was subservient to the same purposes as the others for there must have been from the nature of the ground a travellable road on both sides of the lake This I apprehend to have been the castle of  Bala  which  Llewelyn ap Jorwerth  founded in  Powel      THERE is no river in  England  which has been so much cele∣brated by our poets for its sanctity  THR DLF SACRED  as the  Dee  Most countries had one which they held in peculiar veneration The  Thessalians  paid divine honors to their  Paeneus  on account of its beauty the  Scythians  worshipped their Ister on account of its size the  Ger∣mans  the  Rhine  because it was the judge whether their offspring was legitimate for the spurious sunk the lawful floated  Cluverius Germ Antiq  lib i  and let me add to the list the  Ganges  out of whose waters no  Indian  of a certain sect would willingly yield his last breath Our river foretold events by the change of its channel  Girald Camb Itin  c xi  and it often seemed miracu∣lously to increase without the usual intervention of rains therefore in all probability derived its name not from  Ddu  or black because its waters are not so except in parts by reason of the depth nor from  Dwy  two because it does not appear to flow from any two particular fountains but from Duw  divine  by reason of its wondrous attributes Our original stock the  Gauls  deified foun∣tains lakes and rivers They even had one which in theirs our  primitive tongue bore the same name and was

Song x    WELL therefore might the sacred rivers be called URBIS GENII and that ours was as deserving as the best of them of that title is evinced from the above Finally  Milton  in the follow∣ing line beautifully alludes to the interpreters of the presages among the  Britons  the antient  Druids  who dwelt upon its banks  Nor yet where DEVA spreads her wizard fstream  Lycidas    IT was long before we got clear of these superstitions They were very prevalent in the time of  Gildas  in the sixth century when our ancestors strongly retained the idolatry of the  Druids  among their  Christian  rites and notwithstanding the fulmination of many a monarch  Edgar and Canute  it kept its ground and hydromancy still remains practised among us of which I shall have occasion to speak of more than one kind  I FOUND that I could here  KERRIG Y DRU∣IDION  with greater ease than from any other place digress to  Kerrig y Druidion  a parish a few miles to the north in the county of  Denbigh  noted for certain  Druidical  remains which gave name to the place After a dreary ride I found myself disappointed these sacred reliques having been profanely carried away and converted into a wall It is therefore from the annotator on  Cambden  II  and the drawings preserved by him among the  Sebright  MSS that I must form my description  THE largest was a fine specimen of the  British Kist vaen  or stone chest It consisted of one stone at top placed inclining to the north and was when measured by Mr  Llwyd  ten feet long supported by a stone on each side about seven feet long and near  two and a half broad Under one end was a stone three feet long at the other one of the length of two feet The hollow beneath was only seven feet long three and a half broad and only two and a half high which sufficiently shews that these mo∣numents had not been the cells of  Druids  their uses therefore must have been sepulchral according to the conjecture of Doctor  Borlase  The antient natives of our isle did not always burn their dead Skeletons have been discovered in similar  Kist vaens  at full length in such as this they might lie commodiously with all the parade of arms often buried with them Around this was a circle of stones inclosing an area of about forty paces in diameter and the precinct might be formed with the intent of keeping people at a respectable distance from the remains per∣haps of some mighty chieftain This monument went by the name of  Karchar Kynric Rwth  not that it ever was used for that purpose originally but there is a tradition that in aftertimes a little tyrant of that name in the neighborhood was wont to cram those who offended him into the hollow of these stones which might serve for the purposes of torment as well as the  little ease  in the tower of  London  or the iron cages of the  Bastille  THE other  Kist vaen  was nearly similar to the first but no mention is made of the circle of stones probably they were taken away before Mr  Llwyd  visited the place  AT  Giler  BARON PRICE  in this parish was born that upright and able judge  Robert Price  esq  baron of the exchequer and finally justice of the common pleas His famous speech in the house of com∣mons against the grant of the great  Welsh  lordships to the earl of  Portland  will ever testify his love to his country His speedy  promotion by king  William  do equal credit to his majesty and Mr  Price  since the former howsoever grievous to him might be the opposition to his will yet no consideration could induce him to permit his subjects to lose the benefit of a magistrate ca∣pable and honest as he knew our countryman to be  RETURN to  Bala  and continue my journey on the south side of the lake a most beautiful ride Pass by  Llanyckil  church dedi∣cated to  St Beuno  and see on the opposite side  Llangower  de∣dicated to  St Gwawr  mother of the  Cambrian  bard  Llowarch Hên  Beneath flows  Avon Gwawr  the only feed of the lake on that side  Go by  Glan y Llyn  GLAN Y LLYN  an old house near the water edge which as well as the following had been the property of the  Vaughans  LEAVE on the right another antient seat  Caer Gai  placed on an eminence  Cambden  says it was a castle built by one  Caius  a  Roman  the  Britons  ascribe it to  Gai  fosterbrother to king  Ar∣thur  It probably was  Roman  for multitudes of coins have been found in different parts of the neighborhood and it is certain that it had been a fortress to defend this pass for which it is well adapted both by situation and form of the hill  I PROCEEDED about two miles farther  CASTELL CORN∣DOCHON  to visit another seated a mile from the  Dolgelleu  road on the summit of a high rock which bears the name of  Castell Corndochon  the origin of which we are equally ignorant of Two sides of the rock are precipitous In the front of the castle is cut a deep foss the castle consisted of an oblong tower rounded at the extremity and its measure within is fortythree feet by twentytwo Behind that and joined to it by a wall are the ruins of a square tower this lies in the main  body of the fortress whose form as  Cambden  observes inclines to oval This had been very considerable was built with mortar made of gravel and sea shells and was faced with freestone squared and well cut  I RETURNED towards  Caer Gai  LLAN∣UWCHLLYN  and not far from thence to the village and  church  of  Llanuwchllyn  In the last is the figure of an armed man with a conic helmet and mail muffler round his chin and neck on his breast is a wolf's head and on his belly another and in the intervening space three roses The first are the arms of  Ririd Vlaidd  the others of  Kynedda Wledig  or  The Warlike  a  Cumbrian  prince whose sons after their father had been defeated by the  Saxons  in the sixth century retired and possessed themselves of these parts of  Wales  and from  Mei∣rion  a grandson of his is said to be given the name of  Meirionith  to this shire  Ririd  was lord of  PenLlyn  which signifies the head of the lake and forms one of the hundreds of  Meirionithshire  It had also its castle which probably was that of  Corndochon  Around the margin of the tomb is a mutilated inscription which as far as I could discover run thus  Hic jacet Johannes ap * * * * ap Madoc ap Jeth cujus animae pretur Deus amen anno D  •i  MCCC V  CLOSE by this village runs  AvonyLlan Avon Llew  or  Amlêw  The last rises from two springs and falls into the former Those who chuse to derive the  Dee  from its double origin may fix on these but I met with a third at the farthest corner of the lake arising from the neighborhood of the lofty  Aran  ARAN HI  to which  Spencer  gives the honor of forming that celebrated river I suppose after running through the lake unmixed with the waters The poet  makes the foot of that mighty mountain the place of education of our renowned prince  Arthur  who on his birth being deli∣vered to a fairy knight is by him instantly conveyed to an antient hero  To be upbrought in gentle thews and martial might  IT is evident that  Spencer  who was deeply read in all the ro∣mance of his romantic days had heard the tradition of  Caer Gai  and its old inhabitant  Gai  's father to whom he chuses to give the more classical name of  Timon  for so prince  Arthur  is made to name his fosterfather  Unto old  Timon  he me brought

honored stream is now known by the name of  Avon Twrch  is a fierce mountain torrent precipitating itself from the  Aran  and crosses a road from whence I first begin my journey among the  Alps  of our country and ascend from hence then sink into very deep bottoms bounded on each side by fields of such steepness as to put the inhabitants to great difficulties in the cul∣tivation Woods especially of birch vary the scene On the right  tower the vast hills of  Aran  or rather two heads arising from one base  ARRIVE at the foot of  Bwlch y Groes  or the pass of  The Cross  one of the most terrible in  North Wales  The height is gained by going up an exceeding steep and narrow zigzag path the pass itself is a dreary heathy flat on which I suppose the cross stood to excite the thanksgiving of travellers for having so well accomplished their arduous journey The descent on the other side is much greater and very tedious into the long and narrow vale of  Mowddwy  VALE OF MOWDDWY  It is seven or eight miles long and so contracted as scarcely to admit a meadow at the bottom Its boundaries are vast hills generally very verdant and fine sheep walks but one on the left exhibits a horrible front being so steep as to balance between precipice and slope it is red and naked and too steep to admit of vegetation and a slide from its summit would be as fatal as a fall from a perpendicular rock In one place on the right the mountains open and furnish a gap to give sight to another picturesque and strange view the rugged and wild summit of  Aran Mowddwy  which soars above with tre∣mendous majesty  THERE is a beauty in this vale which is not frequent in others of these mountanous countries The inclosures are all divided by excellent quickset hedges and run far up the sides of the hills in places so steep that the common traveller would scarcely find footing Numbers of little groves are interspersed and the hills above them shew a fine turf to the top where the bog and heath commence which give shelter to multitudes of red grous and a few black But their consequences to these parts are infinitely  greater in being the beds of fuel to all the inhabitants The turberies are placed very remote from their dwellings and the turf or peat is gotten with great difficulty The roads from the brows of the mountains in general are too steep even for a horse  TURF SLEDGES  the men therefore carry up on their backs a light sledge fill it with a very considerable load and drag it by means of a rope placed over their breast to the brink of the slope  At this time the turberies lie at a great distance from the brow of the hill the natives are therefore obliged to bring a horse by a roundabout way to them which assists in dragging the turf to the brink of the slope where men supply its place  then go before and draw it down still preceding and guiding its mo∣tions which at times have been so violent as to overturn and draw along with it the master to the hazard of his life and not without considerable bodily hurt  AFTER riding some time along the bottom of the vale pass by the village and church of  Llan y Mowddwy  the last is dedicated to  St Tydecho  ST TYDECHO  one of our most capital saints His legend  Gywydd y  DYDDECHO SANT yn amser MEALGWIN GWYNEDD  i  the poem of  St Tydecho  who lived in the time of  Malgwyn Gwynedd  is written in verse by  Dafydd Llwyd ap Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  lord of  Mathafarn  a person who had a great hand in bringing in  Henry  VII by feeding his countrymen with prophecies that one of them was to deliver  Wales  from the  English  yoke by which means thousands of them were induced to rise under Sir  Rhys ap Thomas  and join  Henry  then earl of  Richmond  at  Milford  THIS illustrious bard informs us that  Tydecho  had been an ab∣bot in  Armorica  and came over here in the time of king  Arthur  but after the death of that hero when the  Saxons  overran most of the kingdom the saint retired and led here a most austere life lying on the bare stones and wearing a shirt of hair yet he employed his time usefully was a tiller of the ground and kept hospitality  Malgwyn Gwynedd  then a youth took offence at the saint and seized his oxen but wild stags were seen the next day performing their office and a grey wolf harrowing after them  Malgwyn  enraged at this brought his milkwhite dogs to chace the deer while he sat on the blue stone to enjoy the di∣version but when he attempted to rise he found his breech im∣moveably fixed to the rock so that he was obliged to beg pardon of the saint who on proper reparation was so kind as to free him from his aukward pain  So far legend That  St Tydecho  might have lived and that  Malgwyn Gwynedd  did live a prince of our country I make no doubt and that the former did receive from the prince the pri∣vileges it once enjoyed of sanctuary for man and beast is equally probable every offender however criminal met with protection here Legend says that it was to endure for a hundred ages but blind to futurity the reformation was not foreseen This place was also exempted from all fighting burning and killing nor was it permitted to affront any of the inhabitants without making the most ample reparation  THE lands of  Tydecho  were also freed from mortuaries clames oppression and that great duty which most places were subject to the  Gobr Merched  the penalty of incontinence which the saint in tenderness to the possible frailty of his flock wisely took care to get it exempted from  ABOUT four or five miles farther I reached  Dinas y Mowydwy  DINAS MOWD∣DWY  seated on the plain of an eminence at the junction of three vales beneath the rock  Craig y Dinas  whose peat paths I now survey with horror reflecting on a frolick of my younger days in climbing to its summit to enjoy the pleasure of darting down again in one of the peat sledges The foot of this eminence is watered by the  Kerris  and the  Dyfi  The last which retains its name till lost in the sea at  Aberdyfi  rises at the bottom of the rude rock  Craig Llyn Dyfi  under  Aran Mowddwy  It abounds with salmon which are hunted in the night by an animated but illicit chace by spear∣men who are directed to the fish by lighted whisps of straw  THIS  Mowddwy  notwithstanding it is dignified with the name of  Dinas  or city consists but of one street strait and broad with houses ill according with its title but it still preserves the in∣signia of power the stocks and whippingpost the  vagvawr  or great fetter the mace and standard measure It is likewise the capital of an extensive lordship under the rule of my worthy cousin  John Mytton  esquire  OWNERS  He derives it from  William  or  Wil∣c  cke  as he is commonly called fourth son of  Gryffyd ap Gwen∣wynwyn  lord of  Powis  His granddaughter and sole heir mar∣ried Sir  Hugh de Burgh  son of the famous  Hugh  justiciary of  England  His son Sir  John  left four daughters married into the houses of  Newport Leighton Lingen  and  Mytton Alianor  the fourth daughter having given her hand and this seignory to  Thomas Mytton  ancestor of the present lord  THE powers of this capital over a district  PRIVILEGES  which comprehends this large parish and seven out of the eight townships of that of  Mallwyd  are considerable The corporation consists of a mayor  aldermen recorder and several burgesses The mayor tries crimi∣nals but as the late worthy magistrate a very honest smith told me that for some years past they have not adventured to whip the stocks or confinement in the  vagvawr  is the utmost severity they have exerted but then they retain the exclusive power of licensing alehouses in their district and are likewise justices of the peace as far as the limits of their little reign  THE recorder in absence of the lord tries all matters of pro∣perty not exceeding forty shillings and the attornies whose fees do not exceed half a crown are chosen from the lettered part of the community or those who can read  I WAS accommodated with entertainment at the manorhouse from whence I took a delightful walk of about two miles along the vale on the banks of the  Dyvi  The valley expands and the hills sink in height towards the west After passing the  Dyfi  cross a bridge over the deep and still water of the  Klywêdog  black as ink passing sluggishly through a darksome chasm into open day  REACH  Mallwyd  MALLWYD  remarkable for the situation of the altar in the middle of the church which Doctor  Davies  author of the dictionary then incumbent in defiance of the orders of archbi∣shop  Laud  removed again from its imaginary superstitious site at the east end  ONE of the beautiful yew trees in the churchyard is extremely well worth notice It is a sort of forest of vast trees issuing from one stem forming a most extensive shade and magnificent ap∣pearance Another reason for planting these trees in churchyards besides those usually assigned was a custom in old times  upon  Palme Sunday  to make this the substitute of the tree from which that  Sunday  took its name to bless on that day the boughs also to burn some of them to ashes and with those the priest on the following  AshWednesday  signed the people on the forehead saying  Memento homo quod pulvis es et in pulverem reverteris  And of the branches so blessed it was customary to stick some in the fields in rogation week or at the times of processions  RETURN to  Dinas y Mowddwy  CRUEL MURDER  On the road was informed of the place not far from hence where  Lewis Owen  vicechamber∣lain of  North Wales  and baron of the exchequer of  North Wales  was cruelly murdered in the year by a set of banditti with which this country was overrun After the wars of the houses of  York  and  Lancaster  multitudes of felons and outlaws inhabited this country and established in these parts for a great length of time from those unhappy days a race of profligates who conti∣nued to rob burn and murder in large bands in defiance of the civil power and would steal and drive whole herds of cattle in midday from one county to another with the utmost impunity To put a stop to their ravages a commission was granted to  John Wynn ap Meredydd  of  Gwedyr  and this gentleman in order to settle the peace of the country and to punish all offenders against its government In pursuance of their orders they raised a body of stout men and on a  ChristmasEve  seized above four score out∣laws and felons on whom they held a jail delivery and punished them according to their deserts Among them were the two sons of a woman who very earnestly applied to  Owen  for the pardon  of one he refused when the mother in a rage told him baring her neck  These yellow breasts have given suck to these who shall wash their hands in your blood  Revenge was determined by the surviving villains They watched their opportunity when he was passing through these parts from  Montgomeryshire  assizes to waylay him in the thick woods of  Mowddwy  at a place now called from the deed  Llydiart y Barwn  where they had cut down seve∣ral long trees to cross the road and impede the passage They then discharged on him a shower of arrows one of which stick∣ing in his face he took out and broke After this they attacked him with bills and javelins and left him slain with above thirty wounds His soninlaw  John Llwyd  of  Ceisgwyn  defended him to the last but his cowardly attendants fled on the first onset His death gave peace to the country for most rigorous justice ensued and the whole nest of banditti was extirpated many by the hand of justice and the rest fled never to return  THE traditions of the country respecting these banditti are still extremely strong I was told that they were so feared that travellers did not dare to go the common road to  Shrewsbury  but passed over the summits of the mountains to avoid their haunts The inhabitants placed scythes in the chimneys of their houses to prevent the felons coming down to surprize them in the night some of which are to be seen to this day This race was distin∣guished by the titles  Gwyllied y Dugoed  and  Gwilliaid Cochion Mowddwy  i e  The Banditti of the Black Wood  and  The redheaded Banditti of Mowddwy  LEAVE  Dinas  and take the road towards  Dolgelleu  Pass by some deserted lead mines which as yet have never been worked  with success I may here mention an earth which this place is noted for  OCHRE  a bluish ochre which the shepherds wet and pound in a mortar then form into balls and use in marking their sheep An old proverb of the three things which  Mowddwy  wishes to send out of the country shews their long knowlege of it  O Fowddy ddu ni ddaw dim allan  A ellir i rwystraw  Oad tri pheth helaeth hylaw  Dyn atgas  NOD GLAS  a gwlaw  Detested people bluemarking earth and rain    ABOUT three miles from  Dinas  leave on the left the vast sheep farm of  Pennanthigi  a deep bottom environed on three sides by vast mountains forming a noble theatre This whole country abounds in sheep and cattle and the wool is manufactured in all parts into flannel and stockings  ASCEND a steep hill into the pass  Bwlch Oerddyrws  BWLCH OERDDRWS  and the country beyond suddenly assumes a new face Before us is a vast extent of dreary slope bounded by vast rocky mountains among which  Cader Idris  soars preeminent  THIS pass is noted for being one of the three places  CONVENTION THERE  in which were assembled six years after the wars of  Glyndwr  all the great men of certain districts in order to enforce the observation of justice by their own weight without any other legal sanction This perhaps was occasioned by the merciless laws enacted against the  Welsh  by  Henry  IV At each of these places they en∣tered into a compact to cause justice to be done for all wrongs  inflicted before and after the wars but not during that turbulent period Every one was to have his goods or land which had been forced from him restored without lawsuit and any goods detained after this were to be deemed as stolen or if his lord sold them he was fined ten pounds and the goods or their va∣lue to the owner If the refractory person was hanged or died a natural death the demand lay good against the wife heirs or executors but if they or she denied the demand the plaintiff must procure his compurgators viz six persons with him to swear to the right of his clame but like the  English  in cases of jury the defendant had a right to challenge one of the six and another was to be provided in his stead  AFTER this follow various regulations for restoring the go∣vernment of the country in general and several laws relative to waifs and estrays vagrants bail recovery of debts manslaughter thefts duty of officers c The code concludes with valuation of several goods and chattels for which satisfaction was to be made For example a horse and mare on the oath of the owner and two neighbors were valued at ten shillings a foal at twenty pence an ox at a mark a cow at ten shillings the hire of an ox and the milk of a cow were also valued an ewe was esteemed at sixteen pence her wool at four pence her milk at two pence and her lamb at eight pence  As a proof of the high value of arms and that we had few manufactures of that kind a twohanded sword was valued at ten shillings a onehanded at six shillings and eight pence and a steel buckler at two shillings and eight pence but what is very  singular a bow which themselves could make was valued at sixteen pence and an arrow at six pence  To all these laws no penalty was annexed for the breach ex∣cept the forfeiture of the benefit of the compact which in those unsettled times was probably sufficient as it left the party unsup∣ported and friendless  DESCEND from hence  DOLGELLEU  along very bad stoney roads to  Dol∣gelleu  every entrance to which is barred by a turnpike in imi∣tation of other places and every approach mended for a short space by help of the scanty tolls The town is small the streets disposed in a most irregular manner but the situation is in a beautiful vale fertile well wooded and embellished with num∣bers of pretty seats and watered by the river  Onion  over which on account of its floods is a bridge of several arches The town takes its name from its being placed in a dale abundant in hazels It has nothing in it remarkable but the church which notwith∣standing it is pewless is a good building Within is the monu∣ment of  Meiric Vychan ap Ynyr Vychan  of the neighboring house of  Nanney  fifth in descent from prince  Cadwgan  son of  Bleyddyn ap Cynvyn  who resided there and in whose posterity it continues to this time He is armed in a close mail helmet and neckguard sword in hand and with a short mantle over the rest of his armour  Cader Idris  rises immediately above the town  CADER IDRIS  and is generally the object of the traveller's attention I skirted the mountain for about two miles left on the right the small lake of  Llyn Gwernan  and began the ascent along a narrow steep horseway perhaps the highest road in  Britain  being a common passage even for loaden  horses into  LlanvibangelyPennent  a vale on the other side On gaining the brow of the hill I found it to be a very extensive pasture of coarse grass mixed with a little bog The hill slopes from hence upwards the steeper part to the highest peak or the  Pen yr Cader  grows more and more rocky the approach to the summit extremely so and covered with huge fragments of disco∣lored rocks very rugged and cemented by a semivitrified mat∣ter which gives them a very vulcanic look added to their dis∣joined adventitious appearance I met with on my ascent quantities of pumice of the same cellular kind with the  toadstone of Derbyshire  but of a green color The day proved so wet and misty that I lost the enjoyment of the great view from the summit I could only see that the spot I was on was a rude ag∣gregate of strangely disordered masses I could at intervals per∣ceive a stupendous precipice on one side where the hill recedes inwards forming a sort of theatre with a lake at the bottom yet very high in comparison of the base of the mountain On the other side at a nearer distance I saw  Craig Cay  a great rock with a lake beneath lodged in a deep hollow possibly the crater of an antient  Vulcano  This is so excellently expressed by the ad∣mirable pencil of my kinsman Mr  Wilson  that I shall not at∣tempt the description  IN descending from the  Cader  I kept on the edge of the greater precipice till I came near the  Cyfrwy  another peak The whole space for a considerable way was covered with loose stones in the form of a stream sloping from the precipitous side Multi∣tudes of them were columnar  COLUMNS  but not jointed square or penta∣gonal none erect but lying very disorderly in all directions  Some appeared hanging down the face of the precipice the ends of others were peeping out at a vast depth beneath me which shewed the great thickness of the stream I wish the day had been more favorable but I hope another traveller will surround the whole and make a more satisfactory relation of this moun∣tain than I have been able to do  IN respect to the heights of this mountain  HEIGHT  and those of  Aran Benllyn  and the  Arrenig Vawr  I am enabled to give a very exact account by the assistance of the ingenious Mr  Meredith Hughes  of  Bala  who assures me that the  Pen y Gader  is nine hundred and fifty yards higher than the green near  Dolgelleu Aran Benllyn  seven hundred and forty above  Llyntegid  and the  Ar∣renig  only twenty yards short of the  Aran  that the fall from the lake to  DolgelleuGreen  is one hundred and eighty yards so that the real difference of height between the  Cader  and the  Aran  is only thirty yards  AFTER recovering the fatigue of this journey I began another in order to encircle the vast base of the mountain I took the same road as I did before and continued my ride beneath  Tyrrau Mawr  one of the points of  Cader Idris  the highest rock I ever rode under Beyond on the right are the two pools called  Llynian Cregenan  and not far distant are some remains of circles of upright stones with many carns a vast stone raised erect on the top of a neighboring rock and several  maeni hirion  or rude upright columns  AT some distance beyond these  LLYS BRADWEN  near the river  Kregennan  I saw the remains of  Llys Bradwen  the court or palace of  Ednowain  chief of one of the fifteen tribes of  North Wales  either in the  reign of  Gryffydd ap Cynan  or soon after The reliques are about thirty yards square the entrance about seven feet wide with a large upright stone on each side by way of doorcase the walls with large stones uncemented by any mortar in short the structure of this palace shews the very low state of architecture in those times it may be paralleled only by the artless fabrick of a cattle house  Ednyfed ap Aaren  a descendant of this great man had the ho∣nor of entertaining  Owen Glyndwr  in one of his sad reverses of fortune and is said to have concealed him from the pursuit of his enemies in the parish of  Llan Gelynln  in a cave to this day called  Ogof Owain  I MUST not lead the reader into a belief that every habitation of these early times were equal in magnificence to that of  Ednowain ap Bradwen  Those of inferior gentry were formed of wattles like  Indian  wigwams or  Highland  hovels without gar∣dens or orchard and formed for removal from place to place for the sake of new pasture or a greater plenty of game The fur∣niture was correspondent there were neither tables nor cloths nor napkins  Girald Cambr Dejer Walliae    but this is less wonderful since we find that even so late as the time of  Edward  II straw was used in the royal apartment  Anderson's Dict Com  ii    ANTIENT HOSPI∣TALITY  Notwithstanding this the utmost hospitality was preserved every house was open even to the poorest person When a stranger entered his arms were taken from him and layed by and after the scriptural custom water was brought to  wash his feet The fare was simple the meal did not consist of an elegant variety but of numbers of things put together in a large dish the bread was thin oatcakes such as are common in our mountanous parts at this time The family waited on the guests and never touched any thing till they had done when it took up with what was left Music and the free conversation of the young women formed the amusements of the time for jealousy was unknown among us Bands of young men who knew no profession but that of arms often entered the houses and were welcome guests for they were considered as the volun∣tary defenders of the liberties of their country They mixed with the female part of the family joined their voices to the melody of the harp and consumed the day with the most animated festi∣vity At length sunk into repose not under rich testers or on downy beds but along the sides of the room on a thin covering of dried reeds placed round the great fire which was placed in the centre they lay down promiscuously covered only by a coarse homemade cloth called  Brychan  or plaid the same with the more antient  Bracha  and kept one another warm by lying close together or should one side lose its genial heat they turn about and give the chilly side to the fire  Giraldus      SOME vein of the antient minstrelsie is still to be met with in these mountanous countries  ANTIENT MIN∣STRELSIE  Numbers of persons of both sexes assemble and sit around the harp singing alternately  pennylls  or stanzas of antient or modern poetry The young people usually begin the night with dancing and when they are tired sit down  and assume this species of relaxation Oftentimes like the mo∣dern  Improvisitore  of  Italy  they will sing extempore verses A person conversant in this art will produce a  pennyll  apposite to the last which was sung the subjects produce a great deal of mirth for they are sometimes jocular at others satyrical and many amorous They will continue singing without intermission and never repeat the same stanza for that would occasion the loss of the honor of being held first of the song Like nightin∣gales they support the contest throughout the night  Certant in∣ter se palamque animosa contentiovicta morte finit saepe vitam spiritu prius deficiente quam cantu  may almost be added The au∣dience usually call for the tune sometimes only a few can sing to it and in many cases the whole company but when a party of capital singers assemble they rarely call for a tune for it is indifferent to them what tune the harper plays Pa∣rishes often contend against parishes and every hill is vocal with the chorus  CONTINUE the ride as before between high mountains in a narrow glen Quit the narrow pass and go along a good road formed on the sides of the hills with a fine slope from it to the sea at this time strangely mottled with black and green varied by the light through the broken clouds The road now passes between verdant and smooth hills the great sheep walks of the country they are round at their tops and covered with flocks which yield the materials for the neighboring manufactures From a place called  AlltLwyd  have a very full view of the flat called  Towyn Meirionydd  a mixture of meadow land and black turbery watered by the  Dysynni  which falls into the sea a few  miles lower On one side is the village and church of  Tywyn  TOWYN  or  Towyn  The rectory is an impropriation in the bishop of  Lich∣field  the vicarage formerly belonged to the nunnery of  Barking  in  Essex  now in the patronage of the bishop of  Bangor  I neg∣lected visiting this place but believe my trouble would not have been thrown away for I find among Mr  Llwyd  's papers  Sebright  MSS  the drawing of the sepulchral effigies of a churchman another of a warrior and two rude pillars one seven feet high with the figure of the cross and an inscription on each side in old characters Another column marked likewise with a cross but inscribed with letters of a different form is drawn in the same collection from one in the churchyard of  Llanvihangel y Traetheu  in this county  FROM the place where I made this digression I descended a sleep path through fields and crossing the river dined on a great stone beneath the vast rock  Craig y Deryn  CRAIG Y DERYN  or  The Rock of Birds  so called from the numbers of corvorants rock pigeons and hawks which breed on it At the foot is a prodigious stream of stones which extend some hundreds of yards from the bottom of the rock and is formed by the continual lapse of fragments from it Here the  Towyn  is contracted into a fertile vale which extends about two miles further Near its end is a long and high rock narrow on the top Here stood the castle of  Teberri  TEBERRI CASTLE  which extended lengthways over the whole surface of the summit and was a fortress of great strength and extent The most complete apartment was thirtysix feet broad and was cut out of the rock on two sides for much of it is hollowed In some parts the  precipices skirted by a wall formed the defence The remain∣ing walls are well built the stones squared the mortar shells and gravel but at present very rotten The whole of this place is so overgrown with bushes as to render the survey very diffi∣cult It lies in the parish of  Llan vi hangel y Pennant  and is said to have been once defended by a  Coch o'r Pennant  or  The Red  of that place  THIS probably was the castle  Bere  belonging to our last  Llewelyn  which was taken not long before the final conquest of  Wales  by  William de Valence  earl of  Pembroke  Leland's Collect  i  This seems to have been likewise the same which was committed by  Edward  I to the custody of  Robert Fitzwalter  who had at the same time the liberty of hunting all kinds of wild beasts in this county  Rotulae Walliae    It is fit to mention this as there was another strong fortress in  Cardiganshire  of a similar name  RETURN about half a mile  TAL Y LLYN  and ride several miles along the pretty vale of  Tal y Llyn  very narrow but consisting of fine mea∣dows bounded by lofty verdant mountains very steeply sloped Went by  Llyn y Myngil  a beautiful lake about a mile long which so far fills the valley as to leave only a narrow road on one side Its termination is very picturesque for it contracts gradually into the form of a river and rushes through a good stone arch into a narrow pass having on one side the church on the other a few cottages mixed with trees The church and that of  Llanvehan∣gel y Pennant  are chapels to  Towyn  Ecton      ADJACENT to this valley  SINGULAR COFFIN  at a place called  Llwyn Dôol Ithel  in the year was found in digging turf about three yards deep a coffin made of deal about seven feet long carved and gilt at both ends Two skeletons supposed of different sexes were found in it placed with the head of the one parallel to the feet of the other the bones were moist and tough and of an uncom∣mon size the thigh bones being twentyseven inches long Within a yard of the coffin were found two other skeletons of the same dimensions with the former layed on the bare clay and within two roods of them a grave with a skeleton of the usual size Along the graves and coffin were layed hazel rods with the bark on and so tough as to be flexible  Llwyd's Itin  MS Another instance is related in  Cambden  ii  The high preservation of these rods and the toughness of the bones were owing to the bituminous quality of the turbery in which they were deposited The rods were placed for some superstitious purpose perhaps to avert the power of witchcraft since a double hazelnut in some parts of the Highlands of  Scotland  is to this day supposed to have that virtue  A FEW miles beyond  Tal y Llyn  church the hills almost meet at their bottoms and change their aspect No verdure now is to be seen but a general appearance of rude and savage nature The sides are broken into a thousand crags some spiring and sharp pointed but the greater part project forward and impend in such a manner as to render the apprehension of their fall tre∣mendous A few bushes grow among them but the dusky color  of them as well as the rocks only served to add horror to the scene  ONE of the precipices is called  Pen y Delyn  LLAM Y LLA∣DRON  from some resem∣blance it has to a harp Another is styled  Llam y Lladron  or  The Thieves Leap  from a tradition that thieves were brought there and thrown down I have no doubt but that such a punishment might have been inflicted from this  Welsh Tarpeian  by order of an arbitrary lord but we formerly very rarely used capital punish∣ments for any crime not but the gallows was in use for theft  Leges Walliae    but fines were accepted in almost all instances even in cases of murder which gave rise to private revenge and brought on a train of endless feuds and bloodshed  ON the left is the rugged height of  Cader Idris  LLYN Y TRI GRAIENYN  pass near a small lake called  Llyn y tri Graienyn  or of the three  grains  which are three vast rocks the ruins of the neighboring mountain which some time or other had fallen into the water These say the peasants were the three grains which had fallen into the shoe of the great  Idris  which he threw out here as soon as he felt them hurting his foot  PASS over  Bwlch Coch  NANNEY  and after descending a very bad road again reach  Dolgelleu  from whence I visited  Nanney  the antient seat of the antient family of the  Nanneys  now of the  Vaughans  The way to it is a continual ascent of two miles so perhaps it is the highest situation of any gentleman's house in  Britain  The estate is covered with fine timber which clothe all the sides of the dingles for many miles On the road side is a venerable oak in its last stage  of decay and pierced by age into the form of a gothic arch yet its present girth is twentyseven feet and a half The name is very classical  Derwen Ceubren yr Ellyll  the hollow oak the haunt of  daemons  How often has not warm fancy seen the fairy tribe revel round its trunk or may not the visionary eye have seen the  Hamadryad  burst from the bark of its coeval tree  ABOVE  Nanney  is a high rock with the top incircled with a dike of loose stones This had been a  British  post the station perhaps of some tyrant it being called  Moel Orthrwm  or the hill of oppression  THE park of  Nanney  is remarkable for its very small but very excellent venison I have before mentioned the ruins of the house of  Howel Sele  within this park and related his unfortunate history  Tour in  Wales  i    RETURN through  Dolgelleu  and about a mile beyond on a rising spot have a beautiful view of three vales finely bounded by hills and embellished with gentlemen's houses finely watered by the junction of the  Onion  and the  Maw  or  Mowdach  I was diverted from taking the direct road to  Barmouth  by the great deference I always found reason to pay to the judgement of a gentleman who a few years ago honored our country with his remarks  A Gentleman's Tour through  Monmouthshire  and  Wales  in printed for  T Evans    and has made a particular euloge on the cascades of  GlynMaw  Let me add that the consideration of ending this little excursion at the hospitable house of Mr  Garnons  of  Rhiw Goch  was another spur to my design  CROSS the bridge of  Llan Elltyd  Below is a fine tract of mea∣dow wretchedly deformed by the necessity of digging into them for turf the fuel of the country The tide flows within a small distance of this place and on the banks I saw a small sloop ready to be launched On the left is the church of  LlanElltyd  on the right in a rich flat stand the remains of the abbey of  Cymmer  CYMMER ABBEY  Part of the church is still to be seen and shews its an∣tient grandeur At the east end are three lofty but very narrow windows pointed at top and over them three lesser mantled in a great and gloomy thicket of ivy The great hall and part of the abbot's lodgings now form a farmhouse  THIS had been an abbey of  Cistercians  founded not by  Llewelyn ap Jorwerth  as has been supposed who only confirmed the dona∣tions as prince of  Wales  but by the two princes  Meredydd  and  Gryffydd  the sons of  Conan  and  Howel  the son of  Gryffydd  about the year In the charter of  Llewelyn  in is mention of their benefactions of his own and of the boundaries of the abbey lands  Sebright  MSS  which shew it had been founded by other persons This charter is most ample over rivers lakes and sea birds and wild beasts and tame over all mountains woods things moveable and immoveable and over all things under and over the lands so granted and gives liberty of digging for metals and hidden treasures all which was done in presence of  Esau  then  lord  abbot and others religious of the house  Dugdale Monast  i who as well as  Tanner  confounds this with  Cwmbir  abbey in  South Wales  At the dissolution its re∣venues  were valued at fiftyone pounds thirteen shillings and six pence by  Dugdale  at fiftyeight pounds fifteen shillings and four pence by  Speed  The only charge on it in was six pounds thirteen shillings and four pence paid to  Lewis ap Thomas  sup∣posed to have been the last abbot  Willis  ii    Uchtred ap Edwyn  built a castle here  CASTLE  which was taken and overthrown about by  Eneon ap Cadwgan  and  Gryffyd ap Meredydd ap Bleyddyn  Powel    and its place is not at present even known  CONTINUE my journey on a bank high above the  Maw  The valley grows soon very contracted the sides of the hills finely covered with wood almost to the top and the river assumes the form of a torrent rolling over a rocky channel  ABOUT five or six miles from  Dolgelleu  at  Dôol y Melynllyn  I turned out of the road meeting the furious course of the  Gamlan  that falls with short interruptions from rock to rock for a very considerable space amidst the woods and bushes till it reaches a lofty precipice from whence it precipitates into a black pool shaded by trees which gives to the cataract the name of  Rhaia∣derddu  RHAIADER DDU  or  The Black  A noble birch placed above finely finishes this picturesque scene  CROSS  Pont ar Gamlan  below which the river falls into the  Maw  Not far from thence the junction of the  Maw  and  Eden  forms another fine scene A lofty hill cloathed with woods ends here and forms the forks of the rivers correspondent to the steeps  through which these torrents roll and exhibits a view like those of the shady wilds of  America  BEGIN a considerable ascent and find on the top some groves of handsome oaks before me a naked country Descend through some steep fields to another set of wooded dingles that wind along the bottoms and join with the former In various parts  Cader Idris  appears in full majesty over these sloping forests and gives a magnificent finishing to the prospect Soon after my ar∣rival among the woods another cascade astonishes me with its grandeur From the situation I was in it formed a vast fall bounded on one side by broken ledges of rocks on the other by a lofty precipice with trees here and there growing out of its mural front On the summit of each part oaks and birch form distinct little groves and give it a sort of character distinct from our other cataracts After the water reaches the bottom of the deep concavity it rushes in a narrow rocky chasm of a very great depth over which is an admirable wooden  Alpine  bridge and the whole for a considerable way awefully canopied by trees This is called  Pistill y Kain  or the spout of the river  Kain  At no great distance from it is another for nature is here profuse in her beauties of this kind  PISTILL Y MAW  The  Maw  for some space runs along a deep glen finished by a bare mountain seen through vistos formed by the woods on each side The water tumbles down a series of ledges of different heights into a very black and sullen pool from which it reassumes its violence and is lost among the far extending woods  IN the nakedness of winter there is a spot far above from whence these two cataracts may be seen at once exhibiting through  the trees a piece of scenery as uncommon as it is grand After emerging from these romantic depths I reach a long extent of woodless tract the vast parish of  Trawsfynnydd  walled in on all sides by lofty rugged mountains of various forms  IN a farmhouse  BEDH PORUS  not far from this road to  Rhiw Goch  I visited  Bedh Porus  or the grave of  Porus  On a flat stone over it is the following inscription copied somewhat differently by Mr  Llwyd  in the  Britannia  II    PORVS  HIO IN TVMVLO IACIT  HOMO PIANVS FVIT  SOME have supposed the P to have been an R and the word to have been CHRISTIANUS FUIT but whatsoever the let∣ter in dispute might have been there certainly never was room between HOMO and the next word for the letters CHRIS  NOT far from it in another field is a great upright stone called  Llech Idris  There is some silly legend about it concern∣ing the giant  Idris  but it is no more than one of the monu∣mental columns so frequent in  Wales  and many other parts  AFTER a short ride  SARN HELEN  see on a common for the first time the noted  Sarn  or  Llwybr Helen  the causeway or path of  Helen  a road supposed to have been made through part of  North Wales  by  Helena  daughter of  Eudda  or Octavius and wife to the em∣peror  Maximus  Rowland      THIS road is now entirely covered with turf but by the rising of it is in most parts very visible beneath are the stones which  form it and extend in all its course to the breadth of eight yards There are tumuli near it in various places it being very usual for the  Romans  to inter near their highways Close to the part in question is one in which were found five urns the whole ma∣terials of it are composed of burnt earth and stones with several fragments of bricks which had been placed round the urns to keep them from being crushed  AFTER reposing a night at  Rhiw Goch  CASTELL PRYSOR  adjacent to this part of the journey I continued it a few miles to  Castell Prysor  a very singular little fort placed in a pass between the hills on a natural round rock appearing at first sight like the artificial mounts we had before observed Around its summit had been the wall whose remains are visible in several places and in one is the ap∣pearance of a round tower the facings are very regular but the work destitute of mortar Notwithstanding this the castelet is probably  Roman  for multitudes of coins and urns are found about it The name explains the cause of the want of lime in the walls  Castell Prysor  signifying a castle  made in baste  so that there was not time to prepare the usual cement Around its base are the foundations of several buildings which were placed there to enjoy the protection of the place  FROM hence I took the track towards  Festiniog  and saw by the road side  Llyn Rathllyn  a small lake noted for a strange variety of perch  CROOKED PERCH  with a hunched back and the lower part of the backbone near the tail oddly distorted  Br Zool  iii tab xlviii  in other respects they re∣semble the common kind which are equally numerous in this water The same are found at  Fablun  in  Sweden  NOT far from hence  ROMAN CAMP  within the inclosed country I found a very fine  Roman  camp most judiciously placed in a situation over an extensive view of the country partly level partly inclin∣ing from it and commanding a number of passes to die lesser posts of this mountanous tract It is surrounded with a ditch and bank on the last of which are the vestiges of a wall near one end is a great mount of earth broken and hollow in the middle from the removal of the stones which composed the fort round its base is a deep ditch This camp is called  Tomnen y Mur  or the mount within the wall Coins and urns are as frequent about this place as the former  Sarn Helen  runs into it at one end and is continued to  Rhyd yr Halen  in  Festiniog  parish and by the side of  Fannod Vawr  and over a farm called  Cae Du  to  Ffrydd y Dduallt  to the upper part of a farm called  Croesor  at the upper end of  Cwm Croesor  and through  Cae Ddafydd  in  Nanmor  and perhaps to  Dinas Emrys  The branches are numerous I cannot entertain a doubt but that one pointed by  Castell Dol Wyddelan  to  Caer Hûn  or  Conovium  and that by  Pont Aber Glas Llyn  and  y Gymwynas  or the work  done in kindness  may be supposed to have been another pointing to  Segontium  I have before men∣tioned a  Ffordd Helen  among the  Berwyn  hills and let me add those recorded by the annotator on  Cambden  in  Llanbadarn Odyn  in  Caerdiganshire  and from  Brecknock  to  Neath  in  Glamorganshire  which pass under the name of the same princess  Cambden  ii    CLOSE by the road side  OVAL INCLOSURE  on the common at a small distance from the camp is an oval inclosure about thirtysix yards long  and twentyseven wide in the middle surrounded by a high mound of earth but without a foss There were two entrances one op∣posite to the other and near one end a part seemed to have been divided off by a wall whose foundations still remain  I RETURNED out of the parish of  Trawsfynnydd  along the beautiful road of the preceding day till I reached  Llan Elltyd  when I kept on the side of the hill above the valley which leads to  Barmouth  The ride is very picturesque the vale wa∣tered by the  Maw  known here only by the name of  Avon  or  The River  which widens as we advanced the sides bounded by hills chequered with woods I found the little town of  Barmouth  BARMOUTH  seated near the bottom of some high mountains and the houses placed on the steep sides one above another in such a manner as to give the upper an opportunity of seeing down the chimneys of their next subjacent neighbors The town is seated very near to the sea at the mouth of the  Maw  or  Mawddoch  and takes its name of  Barmouth i e Aber Maw  or  Mawddoch  from that circumstance At high water the tide forms here a bay about a mile over but the entrance hazardous on account of the many sandbanks This is the port of  Meirio∣niddshire  but not so much frequented as it ought to be by reason the inhabitants do not attempt commerce on a large scale but vend their manufactures through the means of factors who run away with much of the advantages which the natives might en∣joy yet ships now and then come to fetch the webs or flan∣nels and I am informed that a few years ago forty thousand pounds worth have been exported in a year and ten thousand  pounds worth of stockings Many of the webs are sold into  Spain  and from thence sent to  South America  IN a former visit  July  th  to this place  FASTING WOMAN  my curiosity was excited to examine into the truth of a surprizing relation of a woman in the parish of  Cylynin  who had fasted a most supernatural length of time I took boat had a most pleasant passage up the harbour charmed with the beauty of the shores intermixed with woods verdant pastures and corn fields I landed and after a short walk found in a farm called  Tydden Bach  the object of my excursion  Mary Thomas  who was boarded here and kept with great humanity and neatness She was of the age of fortyseven of a good countenance very pale thin but not so much emaciated as might be expected from the strangeness of the circumstances I am going to relate her eyes weak her voice low deprived of the use of her lower extremi∣ties and quite bedridden her pulse rather strong her intel∣lects clear and sensible  ON examining her she informed me that at the age of seven she had some eruptions like the measles which grew confluent and universal and she became so fore that she could not bear the left touch she received some ease by the appli∣cation of a sheep's skin just taken from the animal After this she was seized at spring and fall with swellings and in∣flammations during which time she was confined to her bed but in the intervals could walk about and once went to  Holywell  in hopes of cure  WHEN she was about twentyseven years of age she was at∣tacked with the same complaint but in a more violent man∣ner and during two years and a half remained insensible and took no manner of nourishment notwithstanding her friends forced open her mouth with a spoon to get something down but the moment the spoon was taken away her teeth met and closed with vast snapping and violence during that time she flung up vast quantities of blood  SHE well remembers the return of her senses and her know∣lege of every body about her She thought she had slept but a night and asked her mother whether she had given her any thing the day before for she found herself very hungry Meat was brought to her but so far from being able to take any thing solid she could scarcely swallow a spoonful of thin whey From this she continued seven years and a half without any food or liquid excepting sufficient of the latter to moisten her lips At the end of this period she again fancied herself hungry and desired an egg of which she got down the quan∣tity of a nut kernel About this time she requested to receive the sacrament which she did by having a crum of bread steeped in the wine After this she takes for her daily sub∣sistence a bit of bread weighing about two pennyweights seven grains and drinks a wine glass of water sometimes a spoonful of wine but frequently abstains whole days from food and liquids She sleeps very indifferently the ordinary func∣tions of nature are very small and very seldom performed Her attendant told me that her disposition of mind was mild her temper even that she was very religious and very servent  in prayer the natural effect of the state of her body long un∣embarrassed with the grossness of food and a constant aliena∣tion of thought from all worldly affairs  She was living in and in the same state    THIS instance of the influence of disease for such only can it be called strange as it is is not without parallel  THE first is the case of a lady a patient of the late doctor  Gower  of  Chelmsford  who was confined to her bed for ten years during which time she had an extreme and constant aversion to all kinds of solid nourishment She drank a pint of tea daily and once in three or four days chewed without swallowing a few raisins of the sun and blanched almonds about four or half a dozen of each she seldom eat oftener than once a month and then only a bit of dry bread of the size of a nutmeg but frequently abstained from food for many weeks together This lady recovered by means of constant medical regimen so that she could walk two miles without taking ei∣ther rest or refreshment  I REFER the reader to the  Tour  in  Scotland  of for the extraordinary case of  Katherine Macleod  of the county of  Ross  and finally shall mention that of  Martha Taylor  of near  Bakewell Derbyshire  who abstained from food from  De∣cember  for thirteen months and took nothing the whole time excepting a few drops of syrup water and sugar or the juice of roasted raisins She was also very religious was much emaciated her palms moist her other evacuations very small  Harleian  Miscel iv See  London  Magazine p in which is another instance of long abstinence    I SHALL now mention another singular personage  EVANS THE CONJURER  but less innocent a native of the same parish with  Mary Thomas  This was the noted astrologer and illfavored knave  Arise Evans  a character and species of impostor frequent in the reigns of  Elizabeth  and  James  I His figure is preserved in the  Antiqua∣rian Repertory  and answers the description given of him by his great pupil  William Lilly  of having a broad forehead beetle∣brows thick shoulders flat nose full lips a down look black curling stiff hair and splay foot He was a deep student in the  black art  and  Lilly  assures us that he had most  piercing judgement naturally upon a figure of theft  and many other questions he ever met withal was well versed in the  nature of spirits  and had many times used the  circular way of invocating  He then tells how his friend  Evans  by means of the angel  Salmon  brought to him a deed which one of his customers had been wronged of at the same time blowing down part of the house of the person in whose custody it was and again how to satisfy the curiosity of lord  Bothwel  and Sir  Kenelm Digby  who wanted to see a spirit he liked to have lost his life being carried over the  Thames  and flung down near  Battersea  by the spirits whom he had vexed at the time of invocation for want of  making  In the life of  Benevuto Cellini  is a most ridiculous tale of this nature  a due fumigation  These ridiculous impostures were the fashionable credulity of the times and the greatest men were the dupes of these pretenders to occult science To shew that  Wales  was fertile in geniuses of every kind we must lay clame to the celebrated doctor  John Dee  or  Dû  who  was born at  NantyGroes Radnorshire  J D Rhys Cambr Brit  Ling Institut p  and was sought after by the greatest princes in  Europe Ben Johnson  in his excel∣lent comedy of  The Alchemyst  for a time gave almost as fatal a blow to the black art as  Quevedo  did in  Spain  to chivalry but since avarice and curiosity are passions most difficult of conquest it rose again with fresh vigor and maintained its ground till the restoration  See  Lilly  's Life  passim    ON my return to  Barmouth  I proceeded for some time along the coast among shifting sands Pass near  Kail Wart  by a stone now serving as a foot bridge on which was this inscrip∣tion  Hic jacet  CALIXTUS  Monedo Regi  There is no tradition of the place it was removed from  ASCEND from the coast to  Corsygedol  CORSYGEDOL  the antient seat of the  Vaughans  where I was entertained by  William Vaughan  esquire for some days in the style of an antient baron The woods near his house are extensive but affected by the west winds in a very surprizing manner the tops are shorn quite even and the boughs so interwoven as to form seemingly a close and al∣most impenetrable surface  THERE are few places which abound more in  British  anti∣quities than the environs of  CorsyGedol  CRAIG Y DINAS  I first visited  Craig y Dinas  the summit of a hill surrounded with a vast heap of stones the ruins of a wall which in many parts retain a re∣gular and even facing this and some others similar are the first deviations from the rude ramparts of stone and prior to the improvement of masonry by the use of mortar Into this  is an oblique entrance with stone facings on both sides and near it are two ramparts of stones The whole is on the steep extremity of the hill near to which is a pass into the country  ABOUT a mile farther  LLYN BODLYN  is  Llyn Bodlyn  a small lake beneath a lofty precipice well stocked with char which will take a bair and afford good diversion to the angler  Llyn Cwm Howel  is another lake in this neighborhood noted for a race of trouts which I have seen with most deformed heads thick flatted and toad shaped and which probably might give rise to the fabled accounts of the monstrous species recorded by  Giraldus  AFTER passing by  LlynIrddin  a small piece of water on a plain arrive amidst a wondrous group of  Druidical  antiquities On the flat appear two circles  CIRCLES OF STONES  The first is about fiftysix feet in diameter formed of piles of loose stones with upright co∣lumns placed at five yards distance from each other in pairs so as nearly to divide the circle into four parts About thirty yards from this is a lesser with several upright stones among the smaller but placed with less regularity Design not chance certainly directed the founders of these circles in the disposition of the columnar stones but I fear when I come to speak more fully of them the cause must remain unaccounted for by reason of the remoteness of the time and the mystery of the antient priesthood  HALF a mile fouth of these on the side of a hill are two car∣nedds of a most stupendous size containing an uncommon as∣semblage of druidical customs  CARNEDDEU HENGWM  or religion in form of  Cromleh Maen Hir  and  Kist Vaen  Both are of an oblong form and  composed of loose stones the largest is fiftyfive feet long and twelve high in the middle At the east end is a great  Crom∣leh  altar composed of two sloping stones one placed over the edge of the other upon five flat upright stones seven feet high in one part and four feet ten in the lowest About eight yards from this is the upper stone of a  Cromleh  lying flat on the carnedd without the appearance of any other support  ELEVEN yards farther is another great heap of stones and in it a large  Cromleh  supported with upright stones It is now converted into a retreat for a shepherd who has placed stone seats within and formed a chimney through the loose stones above In the same carnedd a little farther on is another magnificent  Cromleh  whose incumbent stone is twelve feet by nine four vast columns or  maen hirion  three now fallen and a third erect The columns are from the height of ten feet four to that of twelve feet eight and each between four and five feet broad  NORTHWEST of these antiquities  CASTELL DINAS CORTIN  on the top of a hill is a strong post called  Castell Dinas Cortin  entrenched around with an advanced work on one side This and  Castell Craig y Dinas  were doubtlessly formed as defences to the sacred ground the subject of the above description I may add like∣wife another object of protection of the same nature which I met with on my return to  Corsegedol  two great  Carnedds  placed on small eminences near to each other and within one the five square flags of a  Kist vaen  the top being de∣stroyed The place is most remarkable for the name  Bryn Cornyn  JAU The neighbors of this antiquity are fond of ren∣dering  it  The Hill of the Horns of  JOVE It more probably was a place of sacrifice before or after the chace and derived its title from the horned deity  Cernunnos  CERNUNNOS  who was venerated by the  Gauls  and applied to as a protector from the dangers attendant on the diversion  Religion de  Gaulois  ii    Both the  Gauls  and  Britons  had one com∣mon religion so that  Cernunnos  might as reasonably be supposed to have a place here as in  France  THIS neighborhood also abounds with  Cromlechs  of very great size  CROMLECHS  I measured one in a tenement called  BrynyVoel  which was sixteen feet four inches long seven feet four broad and twenty inches thick It lay about two feet above the ground supported by small stones and was surrounded with a circle of loose stones Most of the  Cromlechs  of these parts lie very near to the ground and in that respect differ from those of other places They lie likewife horizontally which shews that their object was different whatsoever it was  THIS country is in the hundred of  Ardudwy  The entrance into it from  Trawsfynnydd  is called  Drws Ardudwy  DEWS ARDUDWY  or the door of  Ardudwy  formed by nature through the sterile mountains which separate the places I was tempted to visit this noted pass and found the horror of it far exceeding the most gloomy idea that could be conceived of it The sides seemed to have been rent by some mighty convulsion into a thousand precipices forming at their tops rows of shelves which the peasants com∣paring to the ranges in a dove cot style  Carreg y Klommenod  or the rock of the pigeons The bottom of this passage is covered  with a deluge of stones which have streamed from the sides and along it is a narrow horsepath on the slippery rock formed by the removal of a few of the fragments which in other places are disposed into form of most steep and hazardous flights of steps and yet as if the natural and artificial difficulties of these ways were not sufficient to terrify invaders there are in one place the vestiges of a wall which went across the pass in which might have been the door which gave name to it  ON my return I visited an ordinary house called  Maes y Gar∣nedd  the birth place of the regicide colonel  Jones  whose inso∣lence to the neighboring gentry is still spoken of even to this day with much warmth Actuated by enthusiasm he went every length that the congenial  Cromwell  dictated and was a brave and successful officer in a cause which after a certain pe∣riod was the result of ambition and the foundation of tyranny  FROM some of the adjacent heights of this ride I had a full view beneath me it being low water of the long range of sand and gravel which runs from this coast twentytwo miles into the sea It is deservedly called  Sarn Badrig  SARN BADRIG  or more properly  Badrhwyg  or  Ship breaking Causeway  from the number of ships lost upon it This shoal is dry at the ebb of springtides and marked in storms by horrible breakers Tradition says that all this part of the sea had been a habitable hundred called  Cantréer Gwaelod  or  The Lowland Hundred  and that it was overwhelmed by the sea about the year in the time of  Gwyddno Go∣ronhir  A SIMILAR accident happened in some distant period on the coast of  Essex  The canons of  St Paul  must be possessed of a  prebend before they can become residentiaries and the one usually given is  The Praebenda consumpta per mare  which lay on the coast of that county  FROM  Corsegedol  I pursued my journey towards  Harlech  but on the road was tempted by my constant fellowtraveller the reverend Mr  John Lloyd  to make a small deviation to the right to visit a near relation of his who lived a few miles to our right in his antient territories of  Cwm Bychan  We approached it through  Glyn Artro  a little valley watered by a river of the same name and prettily wooded The view upwards was extremely pictu∣resque of a conic rock skirted by a sweet grove and beyond soared the naked mountains which bounded the object of our ride  AFTER passing through the wood and ascending  Dinas Porch∣ellyn  had before us a wild horizon of rocks and rocky moun∣tains Even these tracts unfriendly as they seem to vegetation had once been covered with venerable oaks and there still re∣mained a few between eight and nine feet in circumference We went under their shade above a rapid torrent with a de∣lightful view before us of a true  Alpine  wooden bridge and a small mill and a little farther an antient arch flung from rock to rock giving passage over a still and black water shaded by trees Ford the river again near  Llyn Sarph  or  The Serpent's Hole  Wind up a rocky staircase road and arrive full in sight of  Cwm Bychan  CWM BYCHAN  embosomed with rocks of magnificent height After a short ride high above a lake of the same name descend and reach the house of the venerable  Evan Llwyd  who with his ancestors boast of being lords of these rocks at left since the  year This and the fortified pass of  Drws Ardudwy  were most probably occupied by the sons of  Cadwgan  in their contests with the sons of  Uchtryd ap Edwyn  whom they at last expelled the country  The following as it is the true descent of Mr  Evan Llwyd  and my fellowtraveller who being brother's children are eighteenth in descent from  Blyddyn ap Cynvyn  so it is a genuine copy of the form of a  British  pedegree  Evan ap Edward ap Richard ap Edward ap Humphrey ap Edward ap Dafydd ap Robert ap Howel ap Dafydd ap Meirig Llwyd o Nannau ap Meirig Vychan ap Ynyr Vychan ap Ynyr ap Meuric ap Madog ap Cadwgan ap Bleddyn ap Cynvyn  prince of  North Wales  and  Powys  Numbers of respectable families in this country are of the same descent    I WAS introduced to the worthy representative of this long line who gave me the most hospitable reception and in the style of an antient  Briton  He welcomed us with ale and po∣tent beer to wash down the  Coch yr Wden  or hung goat and the cheese compounded of the milk of cow and sheep He likewise shewed us the antient family cup made of a bull's scro∣tum in which large libations had been made in days of yore The family lay in their whole store of winter provisions being inaccessible a great part of the season by reason of snow Here they have lived for many generations without bettering or lessen∣ing their income without noisy fame but without any of its embittering attendants  OF this house was the valiant  Dai Llwyd  to whom is said to have been addressed the noted  Welsh  tune  Ffarwel  DAI Llwyd on occasion of his going with  Jasper Tudor  and  Owen Lawgoch  to fight  Risiart Frawdwr  or  Richard the Traitor  by which name the  Welsh  stigmatized  Richard  the Third  THE mansion is a true specimen of an antient seat of a gen∣tleman of  Wales  The furniture rude the most remarkable were the  Cistie Styffylog  or the great oatmeal chests which held the essential part of the provision  THE territories dependent on the mansion extend about four miles each way and consist of a small tract of meadow a pretty lake swarming with trout a little wood and very much rock but the whole forms a most august scenery The naked moun∣tains envelope his vale and lake like an immense theatre The meadows are divided by a small stream and are bounded on one side by the lake on the other by his woods which skirt the foot of the rocks and through which the river runs and beyond them tumbles from the heights in a series of cataracts He keeps his whole territory in his own hands but distributes his hinds among the  Havadwys  or summer dairyhouses for the conveniency of attending his herds and flocks he has fixed his heir on another part of his estates His ambition once led him to attempt draining his lake in order to extend his landed pro∣perty but alas he gained only a few acres of rushes and reeds so wisely bounded his desires and saved a beautiful piece of water He found on one side a stratum of fine white earth about half a yard thick which I knew was what mineralogists dignify with the name of  Lac Lunae  and  Agaricus Mineralis  The  Germans  use it as an absorbent in dysenteries and malignant fevers  Da Costa  's Fossils i  and it would prove a good manure  STOOLS and roots of firs of vast size are frequently found near the lake Mr  Llwyd  found one with the marks of fire on it which he used to repair the  Tyddyn y Traian  or jointurehouse of his family an ancient customary appendage to most of the  Welsh  houses of any note  AMONG the mountains which guard the  Cwm  is one named  Carreg y Saeth  on whose verge is a great  Maen Hîr  and  Car∣nedd Saeth  signifies an arrow so probably the antient sports∣men here took their stand to watch the passing of the deer which formerly abounded in these parts Nor have they long been extinct a person of the last generation informed my host that he had seen eighteen at once grazing in the meadow  THE  Welsh  had several animals  ANTIENT HUNTING  which were the objects of the chace such as  y Carw  or the stag  Kaid Wenyn  a swarm of bees and  y Gleisiad  or the salmon  Yr Arth  the bear  y Dringhedydd  climbing animals I suppose wild cats martins and squirrels and  Ceiliog Coed  or cock of the wood And the last division was  y Llwynog  the fox  Ysgyfarnog  the hare and  yr Ywrch  the roe Some of the above come very improperly under our idea of hunting yet were comprehended in the code of laws relative to the diversion formed as is supposed by  Gryffyd ap Cynan  Lewis's Hist Wales  Introd    I SUSPECT also that the otter was an object of diversion there  being a  Cylch Dyfrgwm  or an annual payment by the  Welsh  for the prince's water dogs  Record of  Caernarvon Harl  MSS    THE three first were  Helfa Gyffredyn  or the common hunt The stag because he was the noblest animal of chace and be∣cause every body who came by at his death before he was skinned might clame a share in him The next animals were  Helfa Gyfarthfa  or the animals which could be brought to bay such as the bear c which were hunted with hounds till they ascended a tree The bird mentioned here is the cock of the wood whose nature it is to sit perched on a bough where they will gaze till they are shot as they were in old times by the bow or crossbow  THE third division was  Helfa Ddolef  or the shouting chace because attended by the clamor of the sportsmen and compre∣hended the fox the hare and the roe The method of hunting was either with hounds or grehounds which they let slip at the animals holding the dogs in leashes No one was to slip his grehound when the hounds were in chace unless he had a hound in the pack on penalty of having the grehound hamstrung neither was it allowed to kill any animal of chace on its form or at rest on pain of forfeiting his bow and arrow to the lord of the manor When several grehounds the property of different persons were slipt at any animal the person whose dog was nearest the beast when last in sight clamed the skin A bitch was excepted unless it was proved she was pregnant by a dog which had before won a skin  EVERY person who carries a horn must give a scientifical ac∣count of the nine objects of chace or else he will be looked on as a pretender and forfeit his horn The same penalty at∣tends the  Cynllafan  or leash he is never again to wear it round his middle on pain of forfeiture but then he is suffered to wear it round his arm  THE antient  Welsh  held the flesh of the stag hare wild boar and the bear to be the greatest delicacies among the beasts of chace  THE prince had his  Pencynwydd  or chief huntsman He was the tenth officer of the court He had for his own supper one dish of meat and after it three horns of mead one from the king another from the queen the third from the steward of the houshold He was never to swear but by his horn and his leash He had the third of the fines and heriots of all the other huntsmen and likewise the same share of the  amobr  on the marriage of any of their daughters At a certain time of the year he was to hunt for the king only at other seasons he was permitted to hunt for himself His horn was that of an ox of a pound value He had in winter an ox's hide to make leashes in summer a cow's to cut into spatterdashes  THE king had liberty of hunting wheresoever he pleased but if a beast was hunted and killed on any gentleman's estate and not followed and clamed by the huntsman that night the owner of the land might convert it to his own use but was to take good care of the dogs and preserve the skin  THE penalty of killing a tame stag of the king's was a pound and a certain fine if it was a wild one if it was killed between  a certain day in  November  and the feast of  St John  the va∣lue was sixty pence but the fine for killing it a hundred and eighty pence A stag was also reckoned equivalent to an ox a hind to a well grown cow a roe to a goat a wild sow to a tame sow a badger had no value because in some years it was measled wolves and foxes and other noxious animals had no value because every body was allowed to kill them and there was none set upon a hare for a very singular reason because it was believed every other month to change its sex  See  Leges Wallicae  xxxix to    FROM  Cwm Bychan  HARLECH  took the road to  Harlech  a small and very poor town remarkable only for its castle which is seated on a lofty rock facing the  Irish  sea above an extensive marsh once occupied by the water This fortress was antiently called  Twr Bronwen  from  Bronwen  or  The Whitenecked  sister to  Bran ap Llŷr  king of  Britain  In aftertimes it got the name of  Caer Collwyn  from  Collwyn ap Tango  one of the fifteen tribes o  North Wales  and lord of  Efionydd Ardudwy  and part of  Llŷn  His grand∣children flourished in the reign of  Gryffydd ap Cynan  He resided some time in a square tower in the antient fortress whose remains are very apparent as are part of the old walls which the more modern in certain places are seen to rest on  THE present castle was the work of  Edward  I is a noble square building with a round tower at each corner and one on each side the entrance with elegant turrets issuing out of the great rounders like those of his other castles of  Caernarvon  and  Conway  It was completed before the year at lest I then  find that a hundred pounds was the annual salary of  Hugh de Wlonkeslow  the constable  Ayloff's Welsh Calendar    but it was afterwards reduced for it appears that the annual fee was only twentysix pounds thir∣teen shillings and four pence and in some accounts fifty pounds which was supposed to be for both constable and captain of the town The whole garrison at the same time was twenty sol∣diers whose annual pay amounted to a hundred and forty pounds  Dodderidge    The present constable is  Evan Lloyd Vaughan  esq  with a salary of fifty pounds a year payable out of the revenues of  North Wales  It was impregnable on the side next to the sea on the other it was protected by a prodigious foss cut with vast expence and trouble in the hard rock  THIS place was possessed  BESIEGED IN  in by  Dafydd ap Jevan ap Ei∣nion  a strong friend of the house of  Lancaster  and distinguished as much by his valour as his goodly personage and great sta∣ture  Gwedir Family    He was besieged here by  William Herbert  earl of  Pem∣broke  after a march through the heart of our  Alps  attended with incredible difficulties for in some parts the soldiers were obliged to climb in others to precipitate themselves down the rocks  Cambden  ii The road is to this day called  Lle Herbert  and at length invested a place till that time deemed impregnable  Pembroke  committed the care of the siege to his brother Sir  Richard  a hero equal in size and prowess to the  Bri∣tish  commandant Sir  Richard  sent a summons of surrender but  Dafydd  stoutly answered that he had kept a castle in  France  so long that he made all the old women in  Wales  talk of him and that he would keep this so long that all the old women in  France  should talk of him Famine probably subdued him he yielded on honorable terms and  Richard  engaged to save his life by interceding with his cruel master  Edward  IV The king at first refused his request when  Herbert  told him plainly that his highness might take his life instead of that of the  Welch  captain or that he would assuredly replace  Dafydd  in the castle and the king might send whom he pleased to take him out again This prevaled but Sir  Richard  received no other reward for his service  Life of lord  Herbert      Margaret of Anjou  the faithful and spirited queen of the meek  Henry  VI found in this castle in an asylum after the un∣fortunate battle of  Northampton  She first fled to  Coventry  and from thence retired to this fortress  Carte ii  after a short stay here she went to  Scotland  and collecting her friends in the north of  England  poured all her vengeance on her great enemy duke of  York  at the battle of  Wakefield  THE place more than once changed masters  AND IN  during the last civil wars It was well defended by major  Hugh Pennant  till he was deserted by his men It was finally taken in  March  by general  Mytton  when Mr  William Owen  was go∣vernor and the whole garrison consisted but of twentyeight men It had the honor of surrendering on articles and of being the last in  North Wales  which held out for the king  Whitelock      Torques  Edward  I formed the town into a borough and conferred on it grants of certain lands and other emoluments  NEAR this place was found the celebrated piece of antiquity  In possession of Sir  Roger Mostyn    TORQUES  on which the learned have thought sit to bestow the name of  Torques  It is well described in  Cambden  as a wreathed rod of gold about four feet long with three spiral furrows with sharp intervening ridges running its whole length to the ends which are plain truncated and turn back like pothooks Whether this was purely  Roman  or whether it might not have been com∣mon to both nations I will not dispute The use was that of a baldric to suspend gracefully the quiver of men of rank which hung behind by means of the hook and the golden wreath crossed the breast and passed over the shoulder  Virgil  in his beautiful description of the exercises of the  Trojan  youth expresses the manner in these frequently misconstrued lines  Cornea bina ferunt praefixo hastilia ferro  Pars laeves numero pharetras it pectore summo  Flexilis obtorti per collum circulus auri  Each brandishing aloft a cornel spear  Some on their backs their burnish'd quivers bore  Hanging from wreaths of gold which shone before  A little altered from the translation in  Cambden  ii    THE  Torch  or  Torques  worn by the  Gauls  and  Britons  was a very different affair a collar of gold or other metal worn round the neck Our heroine  Boadicia  had a great one of that precious  metal and  Virdomarus  wore round his neck another fastened behind with hooks which fell off when the conqueror cut off his head  Illi virgatis

single combat in sight of the army and  Publius Cornelius  after his slaughter of the  Boii  took among other spoils not fewer than four thousand and seventy golden  Torques  Livij  lib xxxvi c    THEY were also in use among the  Romans  who bestowed them as military rewards and as  Pliny  pretends the golden on the auxiliaries the silver on the citizens  Plin  lib xxxiii c  They probably were made in several ways I have seen a very beautiful one I think at present in possession of the reverend Mr  Prescot  of  Cambridge  composed of several links of silver wire most elegantly twisted together it was long enough to go twice round the neck and had clasps which fastened it on  THE custom of wearing the  Torques  was continued from the more remote periods of  Britain  to later times  Llewelyn  a a lord of  Yale  was called  Llewelyn aur Dorchog Llewelyn  with the golden torques on that account and the common proverb  Mi a dynna'r dorch a chwi  I will pluck the torques with you  signifies to this day a hard struggle of a person before he would yield a victory  FROM  Harlech  I ascended a very steep hill and on my way observe several  maen hirion  and circles formed of large common pebblestones and of different diameters sometimes appears circle within circle in other places they intersect each other I should have doubted whether they had not been the founda∣tions of  Cytti'er Gwyddelod  CYTTI'ER GWYD∣DELOD  or the cottages of the wood rangers a sort of temporary hovels erected for the purposes of hunting by our remotest ancestors  Mona Antiqua  had it not been for their inter∣sections The learned  Borlase  gives instances of such in the circles of  Botallek  Antiq Cornwal  tab xiv  which he supposes to have been formed for reli∣gious ceremonies and that one rite might have been performed in one particular circle and another again in a compartment al∣lotted for it by the superstition of  Druidism  Clusters of circles were not peculiar to our island baron  Dahlberg  Suecia Antiqua  c tab  has given a plate of similar assemblages near the town of  Wexio  in  Smaland  in  Sweden  which are on a flat at the foot of a vast sepulchral  tumulus  with a high column and great globe of stone on the summit Some columnar stones or  maen hirion  appear in the ranges of stones composing the circles  THE  tumulus  is called that of king  Ingo  but since the three monarchs of that name were said to have been steady christians and to have lived in the eleventh century I do guess both tu∣mulus  and circles to have been of earlier date and formed in honor  pagan potentate for the northern  christendoms old  Wormii Mon Dan    or  of christianity abolished all such customs  I MUST observe that this place is called  Bonleff Hir  or the loud shout or  cry to battle  Possibly it had been a field of com∣bat and a chieftain had fell here for one of the  maen hirion  is of a distinguished size  FROM hence the road is intolerably bad and stoney  GLYN  till I reached  Glyn  a house of my kinsman  Robert Godolphin Owen  esq  seated in a romantic bottom well wooded This had been the residence of the antient family of the  Wynnes  from whom it passed to the  Owens  by the marriage of Sir  Robert  with the heiress of the place in the last century  PASS by the village of  Llan Tegwyn  and near a small lake filled with that beautiful aquatic the  Water Lilly  Somewhat farther is  LlynTegwyn  LLANTEGWIN  which well merits the name of  Fair and Lovely  a lake about a mile round whose waters are of a crystal∣line clearness its margin full its boundaries neat and clean The narrow path we rode on impends over it and is cut out of a hill whose sides are composed of shivering slate starting out at an immense height above threatening destruction they were much enlivened by flocks of milkwhite goats which skiped along the points and looked down on us with much un∣concern  FROM one of the heights a vast  Alpine  prospect appears in view The stupendous mountains of  Caernarvenshire  and those  of  Merioneddshire  not much inferior form a tremendous scenery and rise divided into a multitude of craggy heads The last are particularly barren and appear quite naked excepting where varied by a mossy verdure or whitened by the  lichen tartaricus  The highest summit of  Snowdon  called  y Wyddfa  soars preemi∣nent From thence the mountains gradually lower to  Lleyn  which stretches in view far to the west and terminates on the point of  Aberdaron  Descend into a deep glen cloathed on each side with trees with the  VelynRhyd  VELYN RHYD  or  Yellow Ford  at bottom notwithstanding its name a most inky stream the fine cataract a little above being most fitly styled  RhaiaderDu  or  The Black  AFTER a short ride reach the village and chapel of  Maen Twrog  dependent on the church of  Festiniog  Near one end is a great upright stone from which it takes the name This stone is taken into the  Welsh  calendar canonized by the name of  St Twrog  The place lies in the  Tempe  of this country the vale of  Tan y Bwlch  TAN Y BWLCH  a narrow but beautiful tract about three or four miles long divided by the small river  Dwy'ryd  or  The Two Fords  being formed by the  Cynsael  and another stream which unite towards the upper ends The vale is composed of rich meadows the sides edged with groves and barren preci∣pitous mountains close this gem as it were in a rugged case Here is a very neat small inn for the reception of travellers who ought to think themselves much indebted to a nobleman  The present earl of  Radnor  for the great improvement it received from his munificence  ABOVE it is a house embosomed with woods most charmingly situated on the side of the hill This seat from the quick suc∣cession of owners by the fatal attachment to the bottle has oc∣casioned many a moral reflection from the  English  traveller  A heavy glutinous ale has charms enough to debauch the senses of the whole principality  and let me add after a certain stage the fiery dram is called in to effect the destruction the former had begun yet I trust that its charms do not fasci∣nate the senses of the WHOLE principality but that after a fair scrutiny there may be found some corner free from the  Baccha∣nalian  rout  THE river hereabouts widens into a good salmon fishery and after some space falls into an arm of the sea called  Traeth Bach  or the little sands  RIDE up the vale and dismounting meet the course of the  Cynfael  FALLS OF THE CYNFAEL  which tumbles along the bottom of a deep timeworn chasm sided with sharp and rugged rocks for a very considerable space darkened by trees that overspread the whole issuing both from the sides and margin Near  Festiniog  is one cascade re∣markably fine consisting of three great falls the lowest dropping into a deep pool black and overshadowed by far impending rocks Below is a magnificent columnar rock rising out of the torrent and called  Pulpit Hugh Llwyd Cynfael Hugh  lived in the time of  James  I was supposed to have been a magician and from thence to have delivered his nocturnal incantations a place fit indeed for the purpose as the pit of  Acheron  ABOUT a mile from the  Cynfael  is another comfortable inn which has often received me after my toilsome expeditions  Opposite to it lies  Cwm Cwm̄orthin  CWM̄ORTHIN  a retreat much more seques∣tered and much more difficult of access than even  Cwmbychan  In my visit to it I descended through woods along a steep road into a very deep but narrow valley which I crossed and began a very hazardous and fatiguing ascent up the rocky front of a losty mountain the path narrow and dangerous and I be∣lieve very rarely attempted by horses After the labor of a mile reached this strange habitation of two farmers in a hollow surrounded on three parts by the rudest of environs and con∣taining a pretty lake and two tenements which yield only grass so that in case the inhabitants have any other wants they must descend from their  Cwm  to get them supplied The mountains which inclose it are the  Moelwyn yr Hydd  and the  Moelwyn Gwyn  and others equally rude High in the first is the lake  Dubach  which affords perch and another called  Llyn Trwstyl∣lon  and opposite to the last a third called  Llyn Conglog  all of which after hard rains form noble cataracts down the fronts of the hills We preferred another way out of this singular place and wound up a narrow path at the farthest end on part of  Molwyn y Hydd  in order to descend through  Cwm Croesor  being then desirous of getting by the nearest road to  Pont Aber Glâs Llyn  But in our descent we met with such narrowness of path such short turnings and horrible precipices that our poor beasts with much reason trembled in every limb and in fact had a wonderful escape in getting safe to the bottom The traveller who chuses to follow our steps will find a narrow grassy bottom in  Cwm Croesor  with a few tenements he will pass through a  pretty wood and soon after find himself on the high road from  Tan y Bwlch  to  Caernarvon  IN this journey I went from  Festiniog  on a less hazardous way Not two miles from thence on the road from  Trawsfyn∣nydd  to  Yspytty  I fell again into  Fford Helen  which is here quite bare and exhibits the rude stones with which it was made  NEAR it  BEDDAU GWYR ARDUDWY  at  Rhyd yr Halen  on the right are the remains of  Beddau Gwyr Ardudwy  or the graves of the men of  Ardudwy  These graves were about six feet long marked at each end by two upright stones but most of the stones are now removed There are yet to be seen several circles of stones the largest about fiftytwo feet in diameter a vast carnedd with two up∣right stones placed on one part as if to mark the entrance to the cell which it probably incloses and near it a lesser heap and a small circle all of which had been surrounded with a larger circle now incomplete by the application of the materials to the making of walls The tradition relating to these monuments is classical nearly parallel with the rape of the  Sabines  The men of  Ardudwy  to populate their country made an inroad into the vale of  Clwyd  and layed violent hands on the fair ladies of the land they carried them in safety to this place where they were overtaken by the warriors of the vale a fierce battle ensued and the men of  Ardudwy  all slain but the ravishers had some how or other so gained the hearts of their fair prey that on their defeat the ladies rather than return home rushed into an adja∣cent water called from the event  Llyn y Morwynion  or  The Maiden's Lake  and there perished That this had been the  scene of a bloody conflict there is a probability the graves and carnedds prove it and the circles evince that it was in the time when the ceremonies of druidism existed  FROM hence I descended the long and tedious steep of  Bwlch Carreg y Frân  into the narrow vale of  Penmachno  and after ascending another hill turn to the right into the black and moory mountains to visit  Llyn Conwy  LLYN CONWY  the source of the noted river of that name It is a very large piece of water most dismally si∣tuated among rock and bog and the sides very irregularly in∣dented It is placed the highest of any large piece of water I have met with in these parts In it are three islands one of which is the haunt of the blackback Gulls during the breeding season They are so exceedingly fierce in the defence of their young that I knew of a man who was nearly drowned in an at∣tempt to swim to their nests being so violently beaten by the old birds that he thought he escaped well with the dreadful bruises he received on all the upper part of his body The water issues out of the end of the lake in form of a little rill but in the course of a few miles before it reaches  Llanrwst  becomes a most considerable river by the addition of the various mountain streams  DESCEND for two or three miles and reach the village of  Yspytty Jevan  YSPYTTY  or the hospital of  St John  of  Jerusalem  so styled from its having formed in the then inhospitable country an asylum and guard for travellers under the protection of the knights who held the manor and made its precincts a sanctuary After the abolition of the order this privelege became the bane of the neighborhood for the place thus exempted from  all jurisdiction was converted into a den of thieves and mur∣derers who ravaged the country far and wide with impunity till the reign of  Henry  VII when they were extirpated by the bravery and prudence of  Meredydd ap Evan  AFTER a very long interval another charity succeeded in the almshouses for six poor men founded in by captain  Richard Vaughan  a poor knight of  Windsor  and descended from the neighboring house of  Pant Glâs  IN the church are three alabaster figures  TOMBS  The first is the va∣liant  Rhys Vawr ap Meredydd  of the house of  Plâs Yolyn  to whom at the battle of  Bosworth Henry  VII entrusted the stan∣dard of  England  after the bearer Sir  William Brandon  was slain by  Richard  a proper respect to the  Welsh  who so highly fa∣vored the  Lancastrian  cause The next is an ecclesiastic his son  Robert ap Rhys  crossbearer and chaplain to cardinal  Wolsey  and the third  Lowry  the wife of the great Rhys I may add that he left several sons from whom were descended many familes particularly those of  Rhiwlas Pant Glâs Giler  and  Voelas  FROM  Yspytty  I made an excursion to  Voelâs  VOELAS  about two miles distant remarkable for a great column with an inscription in memory of  Llewelyn  prince of  Wales  who was slain in the year Here is likewise a vast artificial mount the site of a  Welsh  castelet destroyed by  Llewelyn  the Great  See the Poem addressed to him by  Llywarch Brydydd y Moch  in  Evans  's Coll  Awdl  vii  Mr  Llwyd  confesses the inscription to be very obscure It is part in  Latin  part in  Welsh  The last line says  Levelinus optimus prin∣ceps hic humatus  which if meant of any of the actual princes of  Wales  must intend  Llewelyn ap Sitsyllt  he being the only one of the three of the name of  Llewelyn  of whose place of interment we are ignorant  Cambden  ii    TURN back and again reach the river  Conway  Enter CAERNARVONSHIRE And after a short ride  RHAIADER Y GRAIG LLWYD  arrive at its celebrated falls not very far from its junction with the  Machno  The prospect is very ex∣traordinary from the neighborhood of a fulling mill where the channel of the rivers form a triangle of deep and doleful chasms worn by the water through the live rock Not far below be∣gins the cataract the most tremendous I ever saw and whose roaring gives sufficient notice of its vicinity The rocks which bound it are of a vast height and approach very near to each other and want the pleasing  accompaniment  of trees attendant on most of our cascades One fall is of very great height and be∣neath that full in view is a succession of four lesser The de∣scent is steep and dangerous and not to be attempted but by those who have strength of body and steadiness of head When down I found myself environed with naked precipices faced with angular columnar rocks pointing in a sloping direction towards the river adding to the strangeness of the scenery  DESCEND a steep hill and arrive in  Nant Conwy  or the vale of  Conwy  after passing over  PontorLleder  beneath which the  river  Lleder  hastens to join thar which gives name to the valley Observe in the course of the  Conwy  a deep wide and still wa∣ter called  Llyn yr Afange  or  The Beavers Pool  BEAVERS  from being in old times the haunt of those animals Our ancestors also called them with great propriety  LlostLydan  or the broad tailed ani∣mal Their skin was in such esteem as to be valued at a hun∣dred and twenty pence while that of the martin took no more than twentyfour pence an ermine twelve an otter wolf or fox only twelve  Leges Wallicae    They seem to have been the chief finery and luxury of the days of  Hoel Dda  THE vale gradually expands from this end and extends about twenty miles terminating at the town of  Conway  It soon widens to about a mile in breadth and improves in beauty especially in the neighborhood of  Llanrwst  where it is divided into the most beautiful meadows The sides of the hills finely cultivated on the western the vast mountains of  Snowdon  rise in a majestic range The eastern consists of low and broken hills chequered with rich pasturage corn fields and groves The river mean∣ders through the whole and before it reaches  Llanrwst  is of a considerable size  VISIT the church of  Bettws Wyrion Iddon  BETTWS WYRION  or the beadhouse of the granchildren of  Iddon  Within is the figure of  Gruffydd ap Dafydd Goch  son to  Dafydd Goch  natural son of  Dafydd  bro∣ther to the last prince of  Wales  He is in armour recumbent with this inscription  Hic jacet Grufud ap Davyd Goch agnus  DEI  misere mei  DOLWYDDELAN CASTLE  A LITTLE farther pass by  Pont y Pair  PONT Y PAIR  a most singular bridge flung over the  Llugwy  consisting of five arches placed on the rude rocks which form most durable piers These rocks are precipitous and in high floods exhibit to the passenger most awful cataracts below the bridge The scenery beyond of rocky mountains fringed wich woods is very striking  THIS bridge was built on the following occasion One  Howel  a mason from  Penllyn  having occasion about the year to attend the  Merionethshire  assizes then held at  Conway  had his passage over the  Lleder  obstructed by floods This determined him to remove to the spot where he built a bridge at his own expence and received no other gratuity than what resulted from the spontaneous generosity of passengers He afterwards moved to the  Llugwy  and began that of  Pont y Pair  but died before he completed his work  Llwyd's Itin  MS i The same authority says that near this place is a great Cromleh called  Cromleh Hwva  so named from one  Hwva ap Kyfnerth  at  Rhyddon  who concealed himself under it when the earl of  Pembroke  deso∣lated these parts    I SOON left the bridge and after a steep ascent arrive at  Dolwyddelan  castle  DOLWYDDELAN CASTLE  seated in a rocky valley sprinkled over with stunted trees and watered by the  Lleder  The boundaries are rude and barren mountains and among others the great bending mountain  Scabod  often conspicuous from most distant places  The castle is placed on a high rock precipitous on one side and insulated it consists of two square towers one forty feet by twentyfive the other thirtyone by twenty Each had for∣merly  three floors The materials of this fortress are the shat∣tery stone of the country yet well squared the masonry good and the mortar hard The castleyard lay between the towers  THIS had been founded by some of our princes but we are ignorant of its origin There were very few castles in  North Wales  before its conquest by the  English  They were needless for Nature created in our rocks and mountains fortifications un∣till our fatal divisions quite impregnable Had there been oc∣casion for artificial retreats the wealth of our country could rea∣dily have supplied the means of erecting them We had the ba∣lance of trade in our favor This prevented our princes from ever making use of their third prerogative that of coining  Tertiam est jus leges condendi et MONETAM PERCUTIENDI  Wottou's Leges Wallicae    Our herds and flocks were the frequent resource of the  English  and brought large sums into  Wales  Witness the large sums of money we too frequently were obliged to pay as purchasers of disgraceful peace Besides cash was far from being requisite since by our laws every subject was bound to assist in building the royal castles excepting the husbandmen belonging to the king  Leges Wallicae      Jorwerth Drwndwn  made this place his residence and here is said to have been born his son  Llewelyn the Great  Gweair Fam    who began his reign in the time of  Richard  I If  Dolinchalan  castle is as I  suppose the same with this  Gryffydd ap Tudor  in the reign of  Edward  I had a fee of fifteen pounds as constable  Rotulae Walliae      Meredydd ap Jevan  an ancestor of the  Wynnes  of  Gwedir  in the reign of  Henry  VII purchased the lease of this castle and the inclosures belonging to it from the executors of Sir  Ralph Berkenet  it having been excepted among the places granted by  Richard  III and resumed by his successor  Gwedir Family  a publication we are indebted for to my respected friend the honorable DAINES BARRINGTON  Before that time  Hoel as Evan ap Rhys Gethin  a noted outlaw resided here As soon as it came into possession of  Meredydd  he removed his habi∣tation in  Evionedd  a hundred in the county to this castle giv∣ing this excellent reason  I had rather fight with outlaws and thieves than with my own blood and kindred if I live in my own house in  Evionedd  I must either kill mine own kinsmen or be killed by them  The feuds among the gentry in  Evionedd  occasioned perpetual murders and  NantConwy  was filled with  banditti  THIS gentleman soon reformed the country he established colonies of the  most tall and able men  he could procure till at last they amounted to seven score tall bowmen every one arrayed in a  jacket or armolet coate a good steele cap a short sword and dagger together with his bow and arrowes many of them alsoe had horses and chasing slaves which were ready to answer the crie on all occasions  The same    HE founded the strong house of  Penamnaen  PENAMNAEN  a mile distant from the castle He removed the church which before lay in a thicket to a more open place by way of security for he never dared to quit his house without leaving in it a strong guard and another of twenty tall archers to attend him whenever he went to church besides a watchman on a rock called  Carreg y Big  to give notice of the approach of the  banditti  He ended his useful life in and left behind him twentythree legiti∣mate and three natural children  THE church had been an impropriation of the abby of  Bedd∣kelert  is very small and has in it a monument commemorating such of the family who were buried here  pedegree of the  Wynnes  See Appendix    IN my return to  Pont y Pair  digressed a little up the river  Llugwy  to see a noted cascade called  Rhaiader y Wenol  or  The Waterfall of the Swallow  The river runs along a strait stony channel for a considerable way amidst narrow meadows bounded by majestic  Alpine scenery  then falls into an amazing hollow The bottom is difficult of access but when arrived at exhibits a wonderful scene of mountain and precipice shaded with trees which fringe the top and start even from the fissures of the sides  CROSS  Pont y Pair  CARREG Y GWALCH  and go beneath a very lofty rock cloathed with wood called  Carreg y Gwalch  or  The Rock of the Faleon  Here was the retreat of a famous partizan of the house of  Lan∣caster  called  Dafydd ap Shenkin  who lurked in a cave still named from him  Ogo Davyd ap Shenkin  The noblest oaks in  all  Wales  grew on this rock within memory of man I remem∣ber the stools of several which proved that they were equal to any which grow in the deepest soil yet these rocks are totally destitute of all earth for a considerable way so that the nutri∣ment which the oaks received must have been derived from the deep penetration of the roots through the fissures of the stones into some nutritive matter  THE antient house of  Gwedir  stands near the foot of this rock  GWEDIR  It is built round a greater and lesser court Over the gateway is the date with I W  John Wynne ap Meredydd  granfa∣ther to the famous Sir  John  author of the memoirs of the family This shews the supposed time of the death of the former to be a mistake The place takes its name from  Gwaeddir  the bloody land from the battles fought here by  Llywarch Hên  See his Works  about the year or perhaps from the cruel battle in between the sons of  Hoel  and the princes  Jevaf  and  Iago  Powel    and a third may be added between  Gryffydd ap Cynan  and  Trahaern ap Cradog  equally bloody  Vide  his Life  The supposition that it was de∣rived from its being the first house in  Wales  which had  glass win∣dows  is not well founded those conveniences having been known long before Sir  John Wynne  himself even mentions a date of on a window at  Dolwyddelan  which is long before the building of  Gwedir  But the following lines of a poet who flourished some centuries before is still a stronger proof of the antiquity of glass in our country  Trwy ffenestri  Gwydir  yd ym gwelent  See the poems of  Cynddelw Brydydd Mawr  who flourished about the year    They see me through the glass windows  ON a rock high above the  Lower Gwedir  stood another called  The Upper  seemingly built for the enjoyment of the beautiful view it commands of the rich meadows watered by the  Conwy  and their elegant boundaries It was a sort of  Diaeta  or summerhouse erected by Sir  John Wynne  in who had a classical taste The walls were covered with inscriptions and the situation well deserved the panegyric bestowed on it in the following  Welsh  lines placed over the entrance  Bryn  Gwedir  gwelir goleu adeilad  Uwch dolydd a chaurau  Bryn

Hist Gwedir Fam  xii    THIS has been of late demolished but the family chapel which stands near the site of the old house is still preserved and service performed in it four times in the year Among various papers belonging to  Gwedir  communicated to me by my friend  Paul Panton  esq  is a curious one drawn up by old Sir  John Wynne  prescribing the rules to his chaplain an odd mixture of  SIR IOHN WYNNE BARONET  portrait of Sir John Wynne  insolence and piety  Appendix  The inventory of his wardrobe drawn up in his own hand is also worth preservation as it shews not only the complete dress of a man of rank in those days but the great oeconomy of the times among people of fashion when their wardrobe was bestowed by will and passed from genera∣tion to generation  The same    SIR  John  was sent to  London  in to study the law was a man of abilities and particularly attentive to the antiquities of his country and family His consequence made him to be taken notice of by the court for he was made a baronet in  June    THIS place continued in the family till the year when it passed into that of the late duke of  Ancaster  by marriage of  Mary  daughter and heiress of Sir  Richard

hence to  Llanrwst  is a pretty walk  LLANRWST BRIDGE  mostly by the side of the river The town lies in  Denbighshire  on the opposite bank The approach is over the bridge the boasted plan of  Inigo Jones  INIGO JONES  It consists of three arches the middle fiftynine feet wide two are extremely beautiful and mark the hand of the architect the third differs greatly having been rebuilt in by a very inferior genius I wish I could do more honor to my country than suppose him to have been a descendant of this neighborhood but he seems to have been by birth a  Lon∣doner  a son of a clothworker  Mr

after he had been in  Italy  assumed the name of  Giovanni Coperario  Hawkins  's Hist Music iv  It is in vain to give the life of a man which has been so amply written by one of the ablest pens in the fine arts Let it suffice to say that the first Sir  Richard Wynne  procured from  Jones  the plan of this bridge of which he was founder in determined to do his country all possible honor by the beauty of the design invented by an architect to which  Wales  had at lest a near relation  Among all the family papers there is not the lest mention of  Inigo  which must have been the case had he been an  Eleve  of the  Wynnes  as has been po∣pularly asserted    THERE is one circumstance attending this great genius which deserves mention as it bears some relation to the country from whence he may have derived his origin When he was em∣ployed to furnish rare devices and paint the scenery for the masques of the festive year he painted the  Creigie'r eira  or a scene in  Snowdonia  for the masque FOR THE HONOUR OF  WALES He did it with such success as to excite the envy of the poet  Ben Jonson  for the scenes were more admired than the entertainment which might very well be but  Jonson  was so offended as to give vent to his spleen in a copy of verses as im∣becil as they were rancorous and illfounded  Ben Jonson  's Works vi    THE river here makes a handsome appearance extending in a direct line far above the bridge and often enlivened with the coracles the  vitilia navigia  of the antient  Britons  busied in tak∣ing salmon and in the months of  February  and  March  numbers of

CHURCH  and ill built and has nothing remarkable except the church which is dedicated to  St Rystyd  or  Restitutus  archbishop of  London  in present at the council of  Arles  in The ground on which it is built is said to have been given by  Rhun  the son of  Nefydd Hardd  to expiate the foul murder of prince  Idwal  a son of  Owen Gwynedd  slain by order of his fosterfather  Nefydd  to whom he had been intrusted  XV Tribes of which  Nefydd  was one  Some curious carving said to have been brought from the neighboring abby graces the inside The  Gwedir  chapel founded in by the abovementioned Sir  Richard Wynne  from a design of  Inigo  would be another ornament if not so shamefully neglected On the wall is a ruinous marble monument elegantly ornamented with trophies it was meant  to comemorate the ancestors of the family but soon promises to tumble into a heap of undistinguishable rubbish  TRAMPLED under feet are several brass plates  BRASSES AND TOMBS  admirably en∣graven with the heads of several of the family who rest beneath Among them is that of Sir  John Wynne  compiler of the me∣moirs who died in The country people have a tradition that he was a great oppressor and accordingly have sent his perturbed spirit to reside in the neighboring cataract of  Rhaiader y Wenol  The head of his wife  Sydney  Died in  daughter of Sir  William Gerard  chancellor of  Ireland

stone records the death of his eldest brother Sir  John Wynne  knight who died at  Lucca  on his travels in and was buried there in the parish of  St John  I have seen numbers of his letters which

the late Sir  John Wynne  of  Glynllivon  A large old house built from the materials of the abby still remains  I RETURNED through  Llanrwst  TREFRIW  and about two miles beyond high over the  Conwy  visit the village of  Trefriw  where num∣bers of small vessels are built and sent down the river at spring tides It is said that  Llewelyn the Great  had near this place a palace and as a proof several hewen stones have been found in ploughing a field called  Gardd y Neuodd  The church of  Trefriw  was originally built by  Llewelyn  for the ease of his prin∣cess who before was obliged to foot it to  Llanrhychwyn  a long walk among the mountains  Sebright  MS    FROM hence I went back as far as  Gwedir  and ascend a very steep hill leaving the park belonging to the house on the left Go over an open space called  Bwlch yr Haiarn  full of turbe∣ries the providential fuel of the country Some leadmines have been discovered in these parts but none of any consequence The  Gale  GALE OR BOG MYRTLE  or bog myrtle abounds here and perfumes the air with its spicy smell It is a northern plant but does not extend  far It is found in  Lapland Norway  and  Sweden  and several parts of the  Alpine  situations of  Great Britain  It is called  Bwrli  or the emetic plant and  Gnwyrddling  or green plant Our countrymen use it as a yellow dye They lay branches of it upon and under their beds to keep off fleas and moths and also give it in powder or infusion and apply it to the abdomen as a vermifuge It is besides sometimes used as a  succedancum  for hops  THE  Sorbus Aucuparia  or mountain ash is frequent in these parts The poorer sort of people make a drink called  diod∣griafel  by infusing the berries in water In former times a su∣perstitious use was made of the wood a piece made in form of a cross was carried in the pocket as an infallible preservative against all sorts of fascinations  AFTER gaining the summit visit to the right  Llyn Geirion∣nydd  a small lake noted for having had near it the habitation of the celebrated  Taliesin  TALIESIN  who flourished about the year in the time of  Gwyddno Goronhir  a petty prince of  Cantre'r Gwaelod  The history of our famous bard begins like that of  Moses  for he was found exposed on the water wrapped in a leathern bag in a wear which had been granted to  Elphin  son of  Gwyddno  for his support The young prince reduced by his extravagance burst into tears at finding as he imagined so unprofitable a booty He took pity on the infant and caused proper care to be taken of him After this  Elphin  prospered and  Taliesin  when he grew up addressed to him the following moral ode styled  Dyhuddiant  ELPHIN or ELPHIN'S  Consolation  supposed to have been addressed to the prince by the infant bard on the night he  was found I take the liberty of using the beautiful transla∣tion with which a fair countrywoman of mine hath lately favored the world  Printed in MDCCLXXX and sold by  Dodsley  and  Elmsley    ELPHIN

and varied by small groves of young oaks very unlike the great woods which cloathed this place  Dyffryn Mymbyr Llanberis  and other parts of  Snowdon  in the time of  Leland  Litin  v  Go through a narrow pass high above a raging torrent falling in broken cascades from rock to rock At a small distance from hence enter  Dyffryn Mymbyr  a valley in which woods and even trees disappear The small church of  Capel Kerig  CAPEL KERIG  and a few scattered houses give a little life to this dreary tract  Snowdon  and all his sons  Crib Coch Crib y Distill Lliweddy yr Aran  and many others here burst at once full in view and make this far the finest approach  THE SUMMIT OF SNOWDON FROM CAPEL CERIG  to our boasted  Alps  The boundaries of this vale are on one side the base of the crooked mountain  Moel Siabod  on the other that of the  Gludar Bach  and several other hills of lesser note The bottom is meadowy at this time enlivened with the busy work of hay harvest and filled with drags horses and even men and women loaden with hay The middle is varied with two small lakes along whose sides we rode and at some distance beyond them near  Pont y Gwryd  quitted our horses to visit the summit of the  Glyder  noted for the report the editor of  Cambden  had made of the singular disposition of the rocks We directed our servants to go on to  Llanberis  with our steeds The ascent was extremely long steep and laborious wet and slippery and almost the whole way covered with loose fragments of rocks be∣neath which was a continual roar of waters seeking their way to the bottom  OUR pains were fully repaid on attaining the summit  GLYDER BACH  The area was covered with groupes of columnar stones of vast size from ten to thirty feet long lying in all directions most of them were of a columnar form often piled on one another in other places half erect sloping down and supported by others which lie without any order at their bases The tops are frequently crowned in the strangest manner with other stones lying on them horizontally One was about twentyfive feet long and six broad I climbed up and on stamping it with my foot felt a strong tremulous motion from end to end Another eleven feet long and six in circumference in the thinnest part was poised so nicely on the point of a rock that to appearance the touch of  a child would overset it A third enormous mass had the pro∣perty of a rocking stone  MANY of the stones had bedded in them shells and in their neighborhood I found several pieces of lava I would therefore rather consider this mountain to have been a sort of wreck of nature formed and flung up by some mighty internal convulsion which has given these vast groupes of stones fortuitously such a strange disposition for had they been the settled strata bared of their earth by a long series of rains they would have retained the regular appearance as we observe in all other beds of similar matter  ONE side of this mountain is formed into a gap  berissce  I may call it with sharp rocks pointing upwards one above the other to a great height In the midst of a vale far below rises the sin∣gular mountain  Trevaen  TREVAEN  assuming on this side a pyramidal form naked and very rugged A precipice from whose summit I surveyed the strange scene forbad my approach to examine the nature of its composition and whether it might not have been suspected of being formed at the same time with the phoenomena on the top of its neighbor  Glyder  for I have heard that insu∣lated mountains of this form often appear at the base of greater which have been supposed to owe their origin to volcanic force  FROM  Glyder Bach  I passed over a plain above half a mile broad called  Y Waun Oer The Chilly Mountainous Flat  Ob∣serve from the edge in a tremendous hollow  Llyn y Boch Llwyd  or  The Lake of the Grey Goat  and in the bottom of the valley  near the foot of the  Trevaen Llyn Ogwen  noted for its fine trout  FROM  Waen Oer  we made a most hazardous descent to  Cwm Bochllwyd  and from thence to  Llyn Ogwen  The way from that place into the valley or rather chasm of  Nant Frankon  is called  The Benglog  BENGLOG  the most dreadful horse path in  Wales  worked in the rudest manner into steps for a great length On one side in a deep hollow formed under fallen rocks was once the hiding place of  Rys Goch o'r Eryri  or  Rhys the Red  of  Snowdon  a mountain bard patronised by  Robert Meredydd  a partizan of  Glyndwr  an outlawed chieftain of whose fortunes he partookI do assure the traveller who delights in wild na∣ture that a visit to it up  Nant Frankon  from  Bangor  will not be repented The waters of five lakes dart down the precipice of the middle of the  Benglog  and form the torrent of the  Ogwen  which falls into the sea a few miles lower This bottom is sur∣rounded with mountains of a stupendous height mostly preci∣pitous the tops of many edged with pointed rocks I have from the depth beneath seen the shepherds skipping from peak to peak but the point of contact was so small that from this distance they seemed to my uplifted eyes like beings of another order floating in the air  THE  Trevaen  from this bottom makes also a very singular ap∣pearance resembling a human face reclined backward Fore∣head nose lips and chin are very apparent and you may add without any great strain of fancy the beard of an antient inha∣bitant an archdruid  BEGIN another hard ascent to  Cwm Idwal  CWM IDWAL  infamous for the murder of a young prince of that name son of  Owen Gwynedd  by  Dunawt  son of  Nefydd Hardd  one of the fif∣teen tribes of  North Wales  to whom  Owen  had entrusted the youth to be fostered according to the custom of the country It was a fit place to inspire murderous thoughts environed with horrible precipices shading a lake lodged in its bottom The shepherds fable that it is the haunt of  Daemons  and that no bird dare fly over its damned water fatal as that of  Avernus  Quam super haud ullae poterant impunè volantes  Tendere iter pennis  NEAR this place is a quarry noted for excellent hones of which quantities are sent annually to  London  A NEW and greater toil is to be undergone in the ascent from  Cwm Idwal  to the heights I had left The way lies beneath that vast precipice  Castell y Geifr  or  The Castle of the Goats  In some distant age the ruins of a rocky mountain formed a road by a mighty lapse A stream of stones each of monstrous size points towards the  Cwm  and are to be clambered over by those only who possess a degree of bodily activity as well as strength of head to bear the sight of the dreadful hollows frequent beneath them  OBSERVE on the right a stupendous  roche fendue  or split rock called  TwllDu  TWLL DU  and  The Devil's Kitchen  It is a horrible gap in the center of a great black precipice extending in length  about a hundred and fifty yards in depth about a hundred and only six wide perpendicularly open to the surface of the mountain On surmounting all my difficulties and taking a little breath I ventured to look down this dreadful aperture and found its horrors far from being lessened in my exalted si∣tuation for to it were added the waters of  Llyn y Cwn  impe∣tuously rushing through its bottom  REACH the  Glyder Vawr  KLOGWYN DU  and pass by the edge of  Klogwyn Du Ymben y Glyder  as dreadful a precipice as any in  Snowdonia  hanging over the dire waters of  Llyn Idwal  Its neighborhood is of great note among botanists for rare plants among which may be reckoned the  Saxifraga Nivalis Bulbocodium  and the  Lichen Islandicus  The last is of singular use to the  Icelanders  A decoction of the fresh leaves in water serves them in the spring as a powerful cathartic and yet when dried changes its qua∣lity and if grinded to powder is a common food either made into bread or boiled with milk or water  Haller  and  Scopoli  also mention its use at their time in  Vienna  in coughs and consumptions made into broth or gruel  Lightfoot's Fl Sectica  ii    THE prospect from this mountain is very noble  GLYDER VAWR  Snowdon  is seen to great advantage the deep vale of  Llanberris  and its lakes  Nant Frankon  and variety of other singular views The plain which forms the top is strangely covered with loose stones like the beach of the sea in many places crossing one another in all directions and entirely naked Numbers of groupes of stones are placed almost erect sharp pointed and in sheafs all  are weatherbeaten timeeaten and honeycombed and of a ve∣nerable grey color The elements seemed to have warred against this mountain rains have washed lightnings torn the very earth deserted it and the winds made it the constant object of their fury The shepherds make it the residence of storms and style a part of it  Carnedd y Gwynt  or  The Eminence of Tempests  THIS mountain is connected to the lesser  Glyder  by the  Weyn Oer  the traveller therefore has his choice of ways to these won∣drous mountains but the most preferable for ease is the road I descend into the vale of  Llanberis  In my way pass close by a rugged brow of a hill which I think is  Rhiw y Glyder  recorded by LLWYD and RAY for its variety of plants From thence descend by  Oleu Fawr  SOON after visit the small lake called  Llyn y Cwn  LLYN Y CWN  noted for the tale of  Giraldus  who informs us that in his days the three kinds of fish it yielded trouts perch and eels were mon∣ocular every one wanting the left eye At present there is not a fish in it to disprove the relation To make amends the botanist will find in it the  Lobelia Dortmanna Sabularia Aquatica  and  Isoetis Lacustris  and not far from it the  Juncus Triglumis  common to this and some of the  Highland  mountains The  Hieracium Alpinum Ruhus Saxatilis Solidago Cambrica  and other rare plants are to be met with In the course of this part of the descent leave o  the right  Llider Vawr  and  Llider Vach  two great mountains part of the boundaries of  NantBeris  and ar∣rive in that vale by  Caunant yr Esgar  or  The Dingle of the Enemy  THIS is a very picturesque vale  NANTBERIS  bounded by the base of  VIEW in NANTBERIS  Snowdon Cefn Cwm Gafr  the two  Glyders  and two  Lliders  each of them firstrate mountains It is strait and of nearly an equal breadth filled by some meadows and two magnificent lakes which communicate to each other by means of a river The venerable oaks spoken of by  Leland  are no more Ava∣rice or dissipation and its constant follower poverty have de∣spoiled much of our principality of its leafy beauties Among the numberless errors of this performance I fear the word is cloathed with trees must be supplied by the traveller with WAS But this shadeless tract is still worthy his attention A road once a succession of rude and stony stairs made with much la∣bor ran on one side high above the lake and was often cut out of the rock to form the way This is I am now informed changed into a road which too much facilitates the approach and lessens its propriety and its agreement with the wild en∣virons  ON the loftiest part  CASTELL DOLBA∣DERN  over one of the lakes stand the remains of  Castell Dolbadern  consisting of a round tower and a few frag∣ments of walls It was constructed with the thin laminated stones of the country cemented with very strong mortar with∣out shells The inner diameter of the tower is only twentysix feet This seems to have been built to defend the pass into the interior parts of  Snowdonia  and it was likewise used as a state prison The founder is unknown to me but it was evidently a  Welsh  prince  IN this valley are two groupes of wretched houses The farthest is near the end of the upper lake with its church dedi∣cated to  St Peris  who was as we are told a cardinal Here  is to be seen the well of the saint inclosed with a wall The sybil of the place attends and divines your fortune by the appearance or nonappearance of a little fish which lurks in some of its holes  FROM hence I took a ride above the lakes to their lower ex∣tremity The upper is the lesser but much the most beautiful piece of water It is said to be in places a hundred and forty yards deep to have abounded with char before they were re∣duced by the streams flowing from the copper mines which had been worked on the sides of the hills The lower lake is about a mile and a half long narrows gradually into the form of a river called the  Rythell  and flows in a diffused channel to  Caer∣narvon  where it assumes the name of  Seiont  NEAR this end of the lake lived a celebrated personage  MARGARET UCH EVAN  whom I was disappointed in not finding at home This was  Margaret uch Evan  of  Penllyn  the last specimen of the strength and spirit of the antient  British  fair This extraordinary female was the greatest hunter shooter and fisher of her time She kept a dozen at lest of dogs terriers grehounds and spaniels all excel∣lent in their kinds She killed more foxes in one year than all the confederate hunts do in ten rowed stoutly and was queen of the lake fiddled excellently and knew all our old music did not neglect the mechanic arts for she was a very good joiner and notwithstanding she was seventy years of age was the best wrestler in the country and few young men dared to try a fall with her Some years ago she had a maid of con∣genial qualities but death that mighty hunter at last earthed this faithful companion of her's I must not forget that all the  neighboring bards payed their addresses to  Margaret  and cele∣brated her exploits in pure  British  verse  ABOUT half a mile farther I visited the remains of  Llŷs Di∣norwig  a house said to have been one of the palaces of prince  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  the walls high and strong the hall twentyfour yards long and before the house is a deep ditch over which had probably been a drawbridge Not very far from hence is a spot called  Rhiw'r Cyrn  or  The Brow of the Horns  where ac∣cording to old usage an officer stood and blew his horn to give notice to the houshold of the approach of their master or to summon the vassals to assemble on all emergent occasions  THIS country is part of the woodless flat  BRITISH POSTS  between the moun∣tains and the  Menai  Its want of strength is supplied with se∣veral posts fortified in the  British  manner  Dinas Dinorwig  about half a mile south of the church of  Llandeniolen  In the churchyard is an yew tree twentyseven feet in girth  is the chief The area is very large surrounded with an agger of small stones backed by another of very large ones then suc∣ceeds a deep ditch a rampart of earth a second vast ditch and a third rampart within the area is a circle of stones the post probably of the commander in chief  IN our way from hence we passed by another called  Pen y Gaer  and soon after by a smaller called  Bryn y Castrelau  sur∣rounded with a single wall and on a rising on the other side of the  Rythell  is another named  Caer Cwm y Glo  or  Caer CarregyFran  from which had been as we were informed a paved way to  Llŷs Dinorwig  I may here add that after the death of  Llewelyn Edward  I bestowed that palace on Sir  Gryffydd Llwyd  the same gentleman who first brought him the news of the birth of his son  Edward  of  Caernarvon  RETURN by the same road and after refreshing myself with a night's rest at Mr  Close  's agent to the mines in  Llanberris  early in the morning begin our ascent to the highest peak of  Snowdon  under the guidance of  Hugh Shone  whom I beg leave to recom∣mend as a most able conductor Keep upon the side of the lake for a considerable way then turn to the left and see not far from the road  Caunant Mawr  CAUNANT MAWR  a noble cataract precipitating over two vast rocks into two most horrible chasms Near this place were found several beads some of glass and one of jet  ASCEND above  Cwm Brwynog  a very deep bottom fertile in  Gwair y Rhosydd  which is composed chiefly of different kinds of rushes particularly  Juncus Squarrosus  the mossrush  Scirpus Caspitosus  the heath club rush  Schaenus Nigricans  the black bog rush and  Carexes  intermixed with few kinds of grass The hay which the lower meadows produce is very different in qua∣lity  GRASSES  being remarkably fine and soft and consists in great part of the fine bent grass  Agrostis Capillaris  As we are on the subject of grasses it may be pleasing to observe how some of them wonderfully change their appearance as they ascend the higher hills the turfy hair grass  Aira Caespitosa  sheep's fescue grass  Pestuca Ovina  Alpine meadow grass  Poa Alpina  and some others which in the low countries where they enjoy the due influence of the sun and length of summer to ripen their seeds are propagated in the common manner that grasses are  as they reach a more exalted situation where they want conti∣nuance of summer and the necessary power of that enlivening body to perfect their seeds become viviparous that is the ru∣diment of the  Germen  vegetates and shoots into blade in the cup from whence falling it readily takes root and grows a kind and providential dispensation for the advantage of those colder climates which are less favorable to vegetation  THIS mountanous tract scarcely yields any corn Its produce is cattle and sheep which during summer keep very high in the mountains followed by their owners with their families who reside in that season in  Havodtys  SUMMER DWELLINGS  or summer dairyhouses as the farmers in the  Swiss Alps  do in their  Sennes  These houses consist of a long low room with a hole at one end to let out the smoke from the fire which is made beneath Their furniture is very simple stones are the substitutes of stools and the beds are of hay ranged along the sides They manufacture their own cloaths and dye their cloths with  Cenn du y Cerrig  or  Lichen Omphaloides  and another  Cenn  the  Lichen Parietinus  native dyes collected from the rocks During summer the men pass their time either in harvest work or in tending their herds the women in milking or making butter and cheese For their own use they milk both ewes and goats and make cheese of the milk for their own consumption The diet of these mounta∣neers is very plain consisting of butter cheese and oatbread or  Bara Cyrch  their drink whey not but they have a reserve of a few bottles of very strong beer by way of cordial in illness They are people of good understanding wary and circumspect usually tall thin and of strong constitutions from their way of  living Towards winter they descend to their  Hên Dref  or  old dwelling  where they lead during winter a vacant life  IN the course of our ascent saw on the left above the  Cwm Moel y Cynhorion  or  The Hill of Council  Pass through  Bwlch y Maescwm  and skirt the side of  Snowdon  till we reach  Bwlch y Cwm Brwynog  where the ascent becomes very difficult by reason of its vast steepness People here usually quit their horses We began a toilsome march clambering among the rocks On the left were the precipices over  Cwm Brwynog  with  Llyn du yr Ard∣dwy  at their foot On our right were those over the small lakes  Llyn Glâs Llyn yNadroedd  and  Llyn Coch  THE HIGH LAKES  The last is the highest on this side of the mountain and on whose margins we were told that in fairy days those diminutive gentry kept their revels This space between precipice and precipice forms a short and no very agreeable isthmus till we reached a verdant expanse which gave us some respite before we labored up ano∣ther series of broken crags after these is a second smooth tract which reaches almost to the summit  TOP OF SNOWDON  which by way of preemi∣nence is styled Y WYDDFA or  The Conspicuous  It rises almost to a point or at best there is but room for a circular wall of loose stones within which travellers usually take their repast  THE mountain from hence seems propped by four vast buttresses between which are four deep  Cwms  or hollows each excepting one had one or more lakes lodged in its distant bot∣tom The nearest was  Fsynnon Lás  FYNNON LAS  or  The Green Well  lying im∣mediately below us One of the company had the curiosity to descend a very bad way to a jutting rock that impended over the monstrous precipice and he seemed like  Mercury  ready to  take his flight from the summit of  Atlas  The waters of  Ffynnon Lâs  from this height appeared black and unfathomable and the edges quite green From thence is a succession of bottoms surrounded by the most lofty and rugged hills the greatest part of whose sides are quite mural and form the most magnificent amphitheatre in nature The  Wyddfa  is on one side  Crib y Distill  with its serrated tops on another  Crib Coch  a ridge of fiery redness appears beneath the preceding and opposite to it is the boundary called the  Lliwedd  Another very singular sup∣port to this mountain is  Y Clawdd Coch  rising into a sharp ridge so narrow as not to afford breadth even for a path  THE view from this exalted situation is unbounded In a former tour  August th Old Stile  I saw from it the county of  Chester  the high hills of  Yorkshire  part of the north of  England Scotland  and  Ireland  a plain view of the  Isle of Man  and that of  Anglesea  lay extended like a map beneath us with every rill visible I took much pains to see this prospect to advantage sat up at a farm on the west till about twelve and walked up the whole way The night was remarkably fine and starry towards morn the stars faded away and left a short interval of darkness which was soon dis∣persed by the dawn of day The body of the sun appeared most distinct with the rotundity of the moon before it rose high enough to render its beams too brilliant for our sight The sea which bounded the western part was gilt by its beams first in slender streaks at length glowed with redness The prospect was disclosed to us like the gradual drawing up of a curtain in a  theatre We saw more and more till the heat became so power∣ful as to attract the mists from the various lakes which in a slight degree obscured the prospect The shadow of the moun∣tain was flung many miles and shewed its bicapitated form the  Wyddfa  making one  Crib y Distill  the other head I counted this time between twenty and thirty lakes either in this county or  Meirionyddshire  The day proved so excessively hot that my journey cost me the skin of the lower part of my face before I reached the restingplace after the fatigue of the morning  ON this day  August th New Stile  the sky was obscured very soon after I got up A vast mist enveloped the whole circuit of the mountain The prospect down was horrible It gave an idea of numbers of abysses concealed by a thick smoke furiously circulating around us Very often a gust of wind formed an opening in the clouds which gave a fine and distinct visto of lake and valley Some∣times they opened only in one place at others in many at once exhibiting a most strange and perplexing sight of water fields rocks or chasms in fifty different places They then closed at once and left us involved in darkness in a small space they would separate again and fly in wild eddies round the middle of the mountains and expose in parts both tops and bases clear to our view We descended from this various scene with great reluctance but before we reached our horses a thunder storm overtook us Its rolling among the mountains was inexpressibly awful the rain uncommonly heavy We remounted our horses and gained the bottom with great hazard The little  rills which on our ascent trickled along the gullies on the sides of the mountain were now swelled into torrents and we and our steeds passed with the utmost risque of being swept away by these sudden waters At length we arrived safe yet sufficiently wet and weary to our former quarters  IT is very rare that the traveller gets a proper day to ascend the hill  ATTRACTION OF CLOUDS  for it often appears clear but by the evident attraction of the clouds by this lofty mountain it becomes suddenly and unexpectedly enveloped in mist when the clouds have just be∣fore appeared very remote and at great heights At times I have observed them lower to half their height and notwithstand∣ing they had been dispersed to the right and to the left yet they have met from both sides and united to involve the summit in one great obsscurity  THE quantity of water which flows from the lakes of  Snow∣donia  RIVERS  is very considerable so much that I doubt not but col∣lectively they would exceed the waters of the  Thames  before it meets the flux of the ocean  THE reports of the height of this noted hill have been very differently given  HEIGHT  A Mr  Caswell  who was employed by Mr  Adams  in in a survey of  Wales  measured it by instruments made by the directions of Mr  Flamstead  Wren's Parentalia  i I suppose  Caswell  was employed by Mr  Adams  author of the  Index Villeris  and asserts its height to have been twelve hundred and forty yards but for the honor of our mountain I am sorry to say that I must give greater credit to the experiments made of late years which have sunk it to  one thousand one hundred and eightynine yards and one foot reckoning from the quay at  Caernarvon  to the highest peak  THE stone that composes this  STRATA  and indeed the greatest part of  Snowdonia  is excessively hard Large coarse crystals are often found in the fissures and very frequently cubic  pyritae  the usual attendants on  Alpine  tracts These are also frequented by the rock ouzel a mountain bird and some of the lakes are stocked with  char  and  gwyniads Alpine  fish The antient inhabitant the goat decreases daily in value since the decline of orthodoxal wigs to which its snowy hair universally contributed Still large flocks are kept for the dairy and milked with great regularity  BOTANY is not within my province  BOTANY  I shall therefore say no∣thing more of the plants than that those species which LIN∣NAEUS so very expressively styles  Aethereae  are entirely confined to the higher parts of the mountains and notwithstanding the seeds must be blown downwards they never vegetate in the lower parts which are deserted by certain plants which are natives of a higher tract of the same hill  THE animals of these regions are chiefly foxes Stags were found here in the days of  Leland  in such numbers as to destroy the little corn which the farmers attempted to sow but they were extirpated before the year  Gwedir  MSS    A ROYAl FOREST  Snowdon  being a royal forest warrants were issued for the killing of the deer I have seen one from the duke of  Suffolk  dated  April  the th and another in the first year of queen  Elizabeth  signed by  Robert To  nesend  and a third in by  Henry Sydney  The second  was addressed to the master of the  game ranger and keeper of the queen's highness forrest of  SNOWDON in the county of  Caernarvon  The last extended the forest into the counties of  Meirionydd  and  Anglesea  with the view of gratifying the rapacity of the favorite  Dudley  earl of  Leicester  who had by letters patent been appointed chief ranger of the forest In consequence he tyrannized over the counties with great insolence A set of informers imme∣diately acquainted him that most of the freeholders estates might be brought within the boundaries Commissioners were ap∣pointed to enquire of the encroachments and concealments of lands within the forest Juries were empannelled but their re∣turns were rejected by the commissioners as unfavorable to the earl's designs The jurors performed an honest part and found a verdict for the country  Leland  who no longer before than the reign of  Henry  VIII had gone over this tract as he did most of  England  under the royal commission and yet reports that all  Cregery i e Snowdon  is in  Caernarvonshire  and no part in  Merionethshire  though says he that shire be  montanius  Itin  V    A NEW commission was then directed to Sir  Richard Bulkeley  of  Baron Hill Anglesea  Sir  William Herbert  and others but this by the firmness of Sir  Richard  was likewise soon superseded But in another was appointed dependent on the favorite A packed jury was directed to appear at  Beaumaris  who went on the same day to view the marsh of  Malltraeth  ten miles distant and found that marsh to be in the forest of  Snowdon  notwith∣standing it was in another county and divided from the forest  by an arm of the sea because the commissioners had told them that they had met with an indictment in the exchequer of  Gaernarvon  which they had the year before broke open and ransacked by which they had discovered that a stag had been rouzed in the forest of  Snowdon  in  Caernarvonshire  was

said that whosoever slept upon  Snowdon  would wake inspired as much as if he had taken a nap on the hill of  Apollo  The  Britons  in very  early times worshipped mountains and rivers  Gildas  but that does not appear from the triambics quoted by our able antiquary Mr  Rowlands  Rowlands    for the words  Eiry Mynydd  are applicable not to this mountain in particular but to all which are

of  Wales  which the prince and his predecessors held since the time of  Brute Edward  I was told by the inhabitants of  Snow∣don  in the treaty he held with our countrymen in the year that even should their prince be inclined to gratify the king in yielding him possession they would not do homage to strangers of whose tongue manners and laws they were ignorant  Powel    Our  princes had in addition to their title that of LORD OF SNOWDON They had five hardy barons within the tract who held of them Such was the importance of this strong region that when  Llewelyn  was at the last extremity he rejected the proposal of  Edward  of a thousand a year and some honorable county in  England  well knowing that his principality must terminate with the cession  No sooner had  Edward  effected his conquest  FAIR HELD THERE  than he held a triumphal fair upon this our chief of mountains and adjourned to finish the joy of his victory by solemn tournaments on the plains of  Nevyn  I SHALL take my leave of  Snowdonia  NAME  with some remarks on the name and the weather The first is a literal translation  By the  Saxons  first into SNAWDUNE  Sax Chr    of the antient appellation  Creigie'r Eira The Snowy Mountains  from the frequency of snow upon them  Niphates  in  Armenia  and  Imaus  in  Tartary  derive their name from the same circumstance Some have supposed it to be taken from  Creigiau'r Eryri  or  The Eagle Rocks  but that bird appears very seldom among them The other circumstance is constant not that it is to be imagined that they are covered with snow in some part or other the whole year as has been idly fabled there being frequently whole weeks even in winter in which they are totally free  THE earliest appearance of snow  WEATHER  is commonly between the middle of  October  and the beginning of  November  the falls which happen then are usually washed away with the rains and the hills remain clear till  Christmas  Between that time and the end of  January  the greatest falls happen which are succeeded  by others about the latter end of  April  or beginning of  May  which remain in certain places till the middle of  June  in which month it has been seen of the depth of some feet It has even happened that the greatest fall has been in  April  or beginning of  May  and that never fails happening when the preceding winter has had the smallest falls But the fable of  Giraldus  con∣cerning the continuance of snow the whole year is totally to be exploded  NEAR the end of  Nantberis  pass beneath  Glyder Vawr  and observe the strata of a columnar form high above our heads At times vast fragments of this tremendous rock tumble down the ruins are scattered about the base and exhibit awful speci∣mens of the frequent lapses One is styled the  Cromlech  for having accidentally fallen on other stones it remains lifted from the earth with a hollow beneath resembling one of those  Druidical  antiquities The length of the incumbent stone is sixty feet the breadth fortysix the thickness sixteen The hollow is said once to have been occupied by an old woman but now serves for a sheep pen  THE ascent from hence is either over loose stones or solid staircase and is exceedingly steep It is a singular road lying in a stupendous chasm bounded for above a mile by nearly equidistant precipices of prodigious height on one side belong∣ing to the  Glyders  on the other by the parts of  Snowdon  REFRESH ourselves on a spot called  The Gorphwysfa  GORPHWYSFA  or  The RestingPlace  At a small distance from which is  Bwlchy Gwyd∣dyl  or  The Pass of the Irishmen  from whence is a singular view of  Dyffryn Mymbyr  the chasm we had left and far below us  the picturesque vale of  Nant Gwynnan  the scene of many a bloody skirmish in the time of  Edward  IV between  William  earl of  Pembroke  and the  Welsh Lancastrians  under  Jevan ap Robert  DESCEND a very steep road  CWM DYLI  into that part called  Cwm Dyli  where we quitted our horses and began a most toilsome journey to visit the hidden vales lodged in the bosom of the mountains We began with clambering up the rugged face of a rock broken into a multitude of short precipices and divided in the middle by a cataract the discharge of the waters from the  Alpine  lakes After about a quarter of a mile's labor  CWM DYLI UCHA  we reached  Cwm y Cwm Dyli  a flat tract of hay ground watered by a river and filled with haymakers the farmer and his family being resident here in his  Havodtu  for the summer season After dining with them on curds and whey we kept along the river's side and found opposed to us another front rugged as the former and attended with a cataract This was surmounted with equal difficulty We found on arriving at the top a bottom a mile in length filled with  Llyn Llydaw  LLYN LLYDAW  a fine lake winding beneath the rocks and vastly indented by rocky projections here and there jutting into it In it was one little island the haunt of blackbacked Gulls which breed here and alarmed by such unexpected visi∣tants broke the silence of this sequestered place by their deep screams We continued our walk ascending along a narrow path above the lake as far as the extremity then descending reached the opposite side in order to encounter a third descent as arduous as the preceding This brought us into the horrible  crater  immediately beneath the great precipice of the  Wyddfa  in which is lodged  Ffynnen Lâs  FFYNNON LAS  Its situation is the most dread∣ful  surrounded by more than three parts of a circle with the most horrible precipices of the  Wyddfa Crib y Distill  and  Crib Coch  with the vast mural steeps of  Lliwedd  continued over the other lake and  Cwm Dyli  In the  Lliwedd  was a strange break called  Bwlch y Saethau  or  The Pass of the Arrows  probably a station for hunters to watch the wanderings of the deer  THE margins of  Ffynnon Lâs  here appeared to be shallow and gravelly The waters had a greenish cast but what is very sin∣gular the rocks reflected into them seemed varied with stripes of the richest colors like the most beautiful lutestrings and changed almost to infinity  HERE we observed the  Wheatear  WHEATEAR  a small and seemingly ten∣der bird and yet is almost the only small one or indeed the only one except the Rock Ouzel or  Mwyalchen y Graig  that frequents these heights▪ the reason is evidently the want of food  WE descended from this dreary scene on the other side of the hill  CRIB COCH  above  Llyn Llydaw  having the tremendous red preci∣pices of  Crib Coch  high above us rising into a mere ridge ser∣rated or rather  herissee  its whole length The face of many of the rocks were marked with large veins of coarse white crystal and others especially  Crib Coch  were varied with the deep green of the dwarf  Alpine  juniper On attaining the top of the hills above the lower end of the lake we descend to the  Gorphwysfa  where we found our horses and returned once more into  NantGwinan  THIS is the most beautiful vale in  Snowdonia  NANT GWYNAR  varied with woods lakes river and meadows besides the most august  boundaries being guarded on each side by vast mountains such as  Crib Du  or part of  Mynydd Nanmer  the  Aran Lliwedd Dduallt  and  Wenallt  extending about five miles to the church of  Beddkelert  On the left we passed by  Havod Lwyvog  the seat of the late  Meyric Meredydd  esq  surrounded with large woods A little farther is the pretty lake  Llyn Gwynan  about three quarters of a mile long and near it are the ruins of a chapel of the same name The chapel had been an ease to the church of  Beddkelert  and was supported by a stipend of five pounds a year from the estate of  Gwedir  It is said to have been founded by  John Williams  grandson of  John Coetmor ap Meredydd ap Je∣van ap Robert  of  Keselgyfarch  and  Gwedir  and goldsmith in  London  the same who is reported to have furnished  Michael Drayton  with  Leland  's papers  NEAR the end of the lake the valley grows so contracted as to form only a narrow streight but almost instantly opens again into a fine expanse chiefly filled with the beautiful  Llyn Di∣nas  Beyond that is a tract of meads chequered with woods and watered by the river created by the various lakes but re∣tains the name of  Avon GlásLyn  from the lofty  FfynnonLâs  from which it originates  AT the bottom rises a vast rock  DINAS EMRIS  insulated and cloathed with wood the famous  Dinas Emris  from early times celebrated in  British  story for here  Prophetic  Merlin  sate when to the  British

Britain  he determined by the advice of his magicians on build∣ing an impregnable fortress in  Snowdon  He collected the ma∣terials which all disappeared in one night The prince asto∣nished at this convened again his wise men They assured him his building would never stand unless it was sprinkled with the blood of a child born without the help of a father The realm was ransacked at length one of his emissaries overheard some boys at play reproach another and call him an unbegotten knave The child and his mother were brought before the king She confessed he was the offspring of an  Incubus  a

read in all the learning of his age The vulgar as usual ascribed all he did to art ma∣gic and his discovery that  Vortigern  had begun to found his castle on a morass was immediately said to have been attended with most portentous circumstances Numbers of prophecies were attributed to him the repetition of which is said to have been forbidden by the council of  Trent  THREE sides of this famous rock are precipitous On the top is a large area on the accessible part of which are two great ramparts of stone and within is the ruin of a stone building ten yards long the walls are dry but strong Since it is certain that  Vortigern  after his misfortunes retired to the  Snowdon  hills and died not very remote from them it is possible he might have selected this for his stronghold as it is admirably adapted for that purpose and nearly fills the streight of the valley and  Merlin Ambrosius  might have given to it the name of  Emris  A place close by styled  Cell y Dewiniaid  or  The Cell

short ride near the river to the village of  Bedd Kelert  seated in a beautiful tract of meadows at  BEDDKELERT  the junction of three vales near the conflux of the  Glâs Lyn  and the  Colwyn  which flows through  Nant Colwyn  a vale that leads to  Caernarvon  Its situation was the fittest in the world to in∣spire religious meditation amidst lofty mountains woods and murmuring streams The church is small yet the loftiest in  Snowdonia  The east window consists of three narrow slips The roof is neat and there yet remains some very pretty fret∣work A side chapel is supported by two neat pillars and gothic arches I could discover no tombs nor any thing worth transcribing but the following epitaph  Infra jacet corpus  Evani Lloyd  de  Hafod Lwyfog  Armigeri qui  Inhumatus fuit paterno et avito  Tumulo sexto die Idus  Maiae  A D Annos Natus  THIS church had been conventual  PRIORY  belonging to a priory of  Augustines  dedicated to  St Mary  There is reason to suppose they might have been of that class which was called  Gilbertines  and consisted of both men and women who lived under the same roof but strictly separated from each other by a wall The cause of my suspicion is that I discovered a piece of ground near the church called  Dôol y Llein  or  The Meadow of the Nun  BEDD KELERT had been the most antient foundation in all the country excepting  Bardsey Tanner  ascribes it to our last prince but it must have been long before his days there being a recital  of a charter for certain lands bestowed on it by  Llewelyn the Great  Rymer  ii  who began his reign in It was favored in the same manner by others of the succeeding princes  David ap Llewelyn  bestowed on it some lands in  Pennant Gwernogan  be∣longing to  Tudor ap Madoc  to which the prince had no right This occasioned a suit between the sons of  Tudor  and  Philip  prior of the house before  William de Grandison  and  R de Stanedon  at  Caernarvon  when a verdict was given against the convent  Sebright  MS  The prior had for his support the grange of  Llecheidior  and part of a mill the grange of  Fentidilt  and village of  Gwehelyn  the grange of  Tre'rbeirdd  one plough land and a certain share of the bees The esteem which these insects were held in by the antient  Britons  on account of their pro∣ducing the nectareous  Medd  was so great that they considered them as created in PARADISE that when they quitted it on the fall of man they were blessed by God himself and therefore no mass ought to be celebrated but by the light of their wax  Leges Walliae      THE prior had besides an allowance of fifty cows and twenttwo sheep The expences of the house must have been large It lay on the great road from  England  and  West Wales  into  North Wales  and from  Ireland  and  North Wales  into  England  In order to enable this place to keep its usual hospitality after it had suffered in by a casual fire  Edward  I most mu∣nificently repaired all the damages and bishop  Anian

The revenues of  Bedd Kelert  were valued by  Dugdale  at seventy pounds three shillings and eight pence by  Speed  at sixtynine pounds three shillings and eight pence  Ed∣ward Conway  is mentioned as last prior There are not the lest reliques of the house  IN order to complete the mountain ramble as far as was in my power I made an excursion from this village up a narrow vale Ascend a steep road amidst a thin hanging wood and see from the road multitudes of black cattle desending from all parts on their way to a neighboring fair The vale expands is watered by the  Colwyn  which flows from a small lake we passed by called  Llyn Cader  LLYN CADER  Left on the right another ascent to the  Wyddfa  where its base extends to a considerable breadth and is far less steep than that on the side of  NantBeris  We soon reached the pretty lake of Cawellyn noted for its Char The mountains hereabouts approach near to each other On the right  Mynydd Mawr  forms a striking feature its top is smooth but its front is formed into a most immense precipice retiring  inwards in a semicircular shape  Moel Eilio  is another mountain of a stupendous bulk most regularly rounded and of a beautiful verdure At  Bettus Garmon  a village with a church dedicated to  St Germanus  the scene changes into a range of beautiful meadows watered by a rapid stream  I HERE turn my back on the humble flats and resume my former road till I had passed  Cawellyn  Not far beyond that lake  LLYN Y DYWARCHEN  I turned to the right to visit  Llyn y Dywarchen  or  The Lake of the Sod  long since celebrated by the hyperbolical pen of  Giraldus  Itin Cambr  lib ii c ix p  for its  insula erratica  its  wandering island  as he calls it That little lake is seated in the middle of a turbery and at this time actually exhibited the phaenomenon recorded by our romantic historian It had on it a floating island of an irregu∣lar shape and about nine yards long It appeared to be only a piece of the turbery undermined by the water torn off and kept together by the close entangling of the roots which form that species of ground It frequently is set in motion by the wind often joins its native banks and as  Giraldus  says cattle are frequently surprized on it and by another gale carried a short voyage from the shore  CONTINUE our journey to  Drws y Coed  DRWS Y COED  or  The Door of the Wood  a pass towards  Clynnog  It is bounded by vast moun∣tains on one side by  Tal Mignedd  on the other by a great clift of  Mynydd Mawr  Some years ago here were con∣siderable adventures for copper of the yellow kind and in the rocks were sometimes found some very thin  laminae  of the native  metal I was tempted here to exceed a little the limits of my  Alpine  tour for now the mountains descend fast from their ma∣jestic heights growing less and less as they approach the  Irish  sea My motive was to obtain a sight of two fine lakes called  Llynnieu Nanlle  which form two handsome expanses  LLYNIEU NANLLE  with a very small distance between each From hence is a noble view of the  Wyddfa  which terminates the view through the visto of  Drws y Coed  It is from this spot Mr WILSON has favored us with a view as magnificent as it is faithful Few are sensible of this for few visit the spot  NEAR these lakes  Edward  I in the summer of resided for some days and from hence issued out more than one of his edicts I find some dated  July  the th and the th Others are dated in the same year from  Bangor Caernarvon Mold  and  Hope  One from  Caernarvon  Sebright  MSS  Rymer  ii to  is dated as late as the d of  October  which shews what attention he paid to the establishment of government in his new dominions by the long visit he deigned to honor them with The place he resided at here was called  Bala Deu Llyn  or the place where a river discharges itself from two lakes but at present all memory is lost of the situation of the town whose traces might perhaps be still discovered after proper search  I RETURNED by the same road and again reach  Bedd Ke∣lert  where I made a coarse lodging The evening was so fine that we were irresistibly tempted not to defer till morning our visit to  Pont Aberglas Llyn  a short walk from hence  PONT ABERGLAS LLYN  The first part is along the narrow vale but in a very little time  the mountains approach so close as to leave only room for the furious river to roll over its stony bed above which is a narrow road formed with incredible labor impending over the water The way seems to have been first cut out of the rock and then covered with great stones as usual in several of our narrow passes The scenery is the most magnificent that can be ima∣gined The mountains rise to very uncommon height and op∣pose to us nothing but a broken series of precipices one above the other as high as the eye can reach Here is very little ap∣pearance of vegetation yet in spots there is here and there enough to tempt the poor goat to its destruction for it will sometimes leap down to an alluring tuft of verdure where with∣out possiblity of return it must remain to perish after it has fi∣nished the dearbought repast  THE bridge terminates the pass and consists of a single arch flung over a deep chasm from rock to rock Above is a considerable cataract where the traveller at times may have much amusement in observing the salmon in great numbers make their efforts to surpass the heights Near the place is a salmon fishery Here had been a royal wear in the reign of  Henry  IV which was then rented by  Robert ap Meredydd  It probably be∣longed in old times to our natural princes for it seems to have been a most valuable privelege We have seen before that young  Elphin  was endowed with one by his royal father and the effect of his disappointment in missing his usual revenues by finding which I dare say was in those days a very rare in∣stance an empty wear Salmon was the most useful and esteemed fish among the  Welsh  it was reckoned among the game and if I remember right is the only species which was preserved by law  ON my return to  Bedd Kelert  RHYS GOCH  a stone by the road side was pointed out to me by the name of the chair of  Rhys Goch O'ryri  the famous mountain bard cotemporary with  Owen Glyndwr  He was of the house of  Havod Garregog  at the entrance into  Traeth Mawr  from whence he used to walk and sitting on this stone compose his poems Among others is a satire on a fox for killing his favorite peacock He died about the year and was interred in the holy ground at  Bedd Kelert  after escaping the vengeance of the  English  for inspiring our countrymen with the love of liberty and animating them by his compositions into a long and gallant resistance to the galling yoke  CONTINUATION OF THE JOURNEY  FROM  Bedd Kelert  I returned to  Pont Aber Glas lyn  and soon reached  Traeth Mawr  a large extent of sands be∣tween the counties of  Caernarvon  and  Meirionydd  of most dan∣gerous passage to strangers by reason of the tides which flow here with great rapidity This forms the bottom of the vast bay of  Cardigan  In the year Sir  John Wynne  of  Gwedir  conceived the great design of gaining this tract

sandy marshy tract called  Morva Bychan  Cambden  ii  Ph Trans  N  o    Lowthorp's Abridg  ii  and crossed over a channel of eight miles to  Harlech  It set fire on that side to sixteen ricks of hay and two barns one filled with hay the other with corn It infected the grass in such a manner that numbers of cattle horses sheep and goats died One character of a  mephites  was wanting for men went into the midst of it with impunity It was easily dispelled any great noise such as the sounding of horns the discharging of guns or the like at once repelled it It moved only by night and appeared at times but less frequently the following summer after which this phaenomenon ceased It may possibly arise as the editor of  Cambden  conjectures from a local  casualty such as the fall of a flight of Locusts in that spot as really did in the sea near  Aberdaron  which growing corrupt might by the blowing of the wind for a certain period from one point direct the pest to a certain spot while others less remote might for the same reason escape the dreadful effects  Mouffet  gives an account of a plague in  Lombardy  about the year which arose from the fall of a cloud of Locusts which corrupted the air to such a degree that eighty thousand men and cattle perished  Theatre of Infects  Engl ed      I continued my journey along the shore  WRECK OF BIRDS  which is for the most part flat except where some small headland juts into it On this coast the Reverend Mr  Hugh Davies  of  Beaumaris  was witness to a very uncommon wreck of seafowl which had happ∣ened in He saw the beach for miles together co∣vered with dead birds especially those kinds which annually visit the rocks in summer such as Puffins Razorbills Guil∣lemots and Kittiwakes of the last there were many many thou∣sands Numbers also of Tarrocks And of birds which retire to distant countries to breed were Gannets Wildgeese Bernacles Brentgeese Scoters and Tuftedducks The frost from  Ja∣nuary  th to  February  the d had been in that winter uncom∣monly severe a storm had probably overtaken both the mi∣grants and remigrants and occasioned this havock and the birds which are perpetually resident with us underwent the same fate unable to resist the freezing gale  Passed by  Stymllyn  the seat of  Wynne  Esq  and soon reach  Crickaeth  CRICKAETH  a poor borough town contributory to  Caernarvon  CRICKAETH  Its castle is seated on a pretty round hill jutting far into the sea and the isthmus crossed by way of defence by two deep ditches on each side of the entrance is a great round tower The court is of an irregular form and has the remains of a square tower beyond is another court and in it on the verge of the rock are two others also square It is probable that all the towers were originally square for the insides of the two round towers are of that form They have so much the appearance of the architecture of  Dolwyddelan  castle that I entertain no doubt but that this castle was founded by a  Welsh  prince and that its supposed founder  Edward  I did no more than case the towers which at present are the two rounders After the Con∣quest  Edward  appointed  William de Leybourn  to be constable with a salary of a hundred pounds a year for which he was to maintain a garrison of thirty stout men ten of whom were to be crossbow men one chaplain one surgeon one carpenter and one mason  Sebright  MSS    OUR boasted countryman  SIR HOWEL Y FWYALL  Sir  Howel y Fwyall  was con∣stable of this castle a hero descended from  Collwyn ap Tangno  He attended the Black Prince to the battle of  Poitiers  and as we say was the person who took the  French  king prisoner but history bestows that honor on  Denis de Morebeque  a knight of  Artois  Froissart  tom i ch clxiiii p  Engl Froissart  i  Perhaps we must wave that particular glory but he undoubtedly behaved on the occasion with distinguished valour for the Black Prince not only bestowed on him the constableship of this castle which he afterwards made his residence but  knighted him and in perpetual memorial of his good services ordered that from thenceforth a mess of meat should be served up before the poleax with which he performed such great feats for what reason he bore it in his coat of arms and was slyled Sir  Howel y Fwyall  or of the  Ax  after the mess had appeared before the knight it was carried down and bestowed on the poor Eight yeomen attendants were constituted to guard the mess and had eight pence a day constant wages at the king's charge and these under the name of yeomen of the crown were continued on the establishment till the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  Some do not scruple to say that the yeo∣men of the crown were grafted upon this stock After the death of Sir  Howel  the mess was carried as before and bestowed on the poor for the sake of his soul and probably as low as the period above mentioned  See  XV Tribes of North Wales  and  Hist Gwedir Family  in  Mr Barrington's Miscelles  and  Hist Gwedir  octavo    EIGHT miles farther is  Pwllheli  In my way cross over a pretty stream on a bridge of three arches at  Llan Ystyndwy  a church and village in a pretty wooded bottom A little farther inland is  Plâs Hén  a seat  of Evan Lloyd Vaughan  Esq  by marriage of an heiress of the name of  Vaughan  a descendant of  Colwyn ap Tangno  she afterwards married  William Lloyd  a younger son of  Bodidris  Cross the little river  Arch  at  Aberarch  or the port of the coffin near a church dedicated to St  Cwrda  After another mile's ride reach  Pwllheli  the best town in this country and the magazine of goods which supplies all this tract It lies close on the shore and has a tolerable harbour for vessels of about sixty tons The en∣trance  is by a high rock called  The Gimlet  a mile from land to which it is joined by a range of sandhills This place was made a free borough by the  Black Prince  by charter dated in the th year of his principality at  Caernarvon  in compliment to  Nigel de Loryng  or  Lohareyn  one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber on whom he had bestowed  Pwllheli  and  Nevyn  in consideration of his great service in  Gascony  and particularly at the battle of  Poitiers  He entitles him to  Servitiis quorum∣cunque tenentium tam liberorum quam nativorum  by which it may be presumed that he did not include the  Welsh  in the privileges What those were I do not learn but they were the same which the burgesses of  Rosfair  in  Anglesey  enjoyed and for them  Pwll∣heli  was to pay to  Nigel  fourteen pounds a year and  Nevyn  thirty∣two This borough and  Nevyn  he freely bestowed on him with all its appurtenances together with four librates of land to∣wards the repair of his manors and for all these he was only to pay an acknowlegement of a rose in lieu of all services If he died without issue the whole was to revert to the crown  Edward  III afterwards confirmed these grants at  Sandwich  FROM hence I took a ride about five miles inland to  Carn Madryn  CARN MADRYN  a lofty rocky insulated hill noted for having been a strong hold of the sons of  Owen Gwynedd Roderick  and  Mal∣gwn  to whom this part of the country belonged The bottom sides and top are filled with cells oblong oval or circular once thatched or covered from the inclemency of the weather many of them are pretty entire The chieftains resided on the top the country with the cattle in times of invasion occu∣pied the sides and bottom The whole summit was surrounded with a wall still visible in many places From the summit is  an extensive view of the country with the bay of  Caerncr  on one side and that of  Cardigan  on the other  Sarn Badrig  Tour in Wales  ii  is seen extending from  Meireonyddshire  its dangerous length nearly parallel to the shore of  Lhein South Wales  may be seen plainly and in clear weather  Ireland  and in front the whole tract of  Snowdonia  exhibits a most magnificent and stupendous barrier  AT the foot of this hill is  Madryn  formerly the seat of the  Bodvels  descended from  Collwyn ap Tangno  but on the death of the last male heir the estate was purchased by  Parry  Esq  of  Wern Vawr  From  Pwllheli  I continued my journey near the shore to  Llan Badrog  along the sides of that noble bay the  Tudwal  's road sheltered by two islands of that name so named from St  Tudwal  sacred to whom was a small chapel on the greater Its present inhabitants are sheep rabbits and in the season puffins  IN the promontory  Penrhyn Du  PENRHYN DU  one of the points of this bay have been considerable adventures for lead ore and of late years attempts to drain the mines by means of a fire engine but the expences proved superior to the profits A little be∣yond this is another bay called  Hell's Mouth  dreaded by mari∣ners being the  Scylla  to the  Charybdis  of  Sarn Badrig  whose extremity lies nearly opposite  IN a small time I reached  Aber  aron  ABERDARON  a poor village at the very end of  Caernarvonshire  seated on a sandy bay beneath some high and sandy cliffs The mouth of the bay is guarded by two little islands called  Ynys Gwylan  a security to the small craft of the inhabitants who are all fishermen It takes its  name from the small rivulet the  Daron  which empties itself here  IN the church are two ailes supported by four very handsome pillars This being the place where devotees usually took boat for  Bardseye  island was greatly resorted to It was dedicated to St  Hywyn  a saint of that island was a sanctuary  Powel    and also much frequented by pilgrims  Leland says  it was called  Llan Engas Brenin Fanum Niniani Reguli  Itin  v  Ninian  died in    Ninian  is a saint son of a  Cumbrian  prince and whom legend might have sent here to found the church  FROM this port I once took boat for  Bardseye  island  BARADSEYE ISLAND  which lies about three leagues to the west The mariners seemed tinctured with the piety of the place for they had not rowed far but they made a full stop pulled off their hats and offered up a short prayer After doubling a headland the island ap∣pears full in view we passed under the lofty mountain which forms one side After doubling the farther end we put into a little sandy creek bounded by low rocks as is the whole level part On landing I found all this tract a very fertile plain and well cultivated and productive of every thing which the main land affords The abbot's house is a large stone build∣ing inhabited by several of the natives not far from it is a singular chapel or oratory being a long arched edifice with an insulated stone altar near the east end In this place one of the inhabitants reads prayers all other offices are performed at  Aberdaron  THE island is about two miles in circumference contains a few inhabitants and is rented from Lord  Newborough  It was granted by  Edward  VI to his uncle Sir  Thomas Seymour  and after his death to  John  Earl of  Warwick  Tanner    The late Sir  John Wynn  purchased it from the late reverend Dr  Wilson  of  Newark  THE island whose spiritual concerns are at present under the care of a single rustic once afforded during life an asylum to saints and after death graves to as many of their bodies well therefore might it be called  Insula Sanctorum The Isie of Saints  But with Dr  Fuller  I must observe that  it would be more facile to find graves in  Bardseye  for so many saints than saints for so many graves  Worthies of Wales      But to approach the truth  S  DUBRITIUS  let it be said that  Dubritius  archbishop of  Caerleon  almost worn out with age resigning his see to St  David  re∣tired here and according to the best account died in was interred on the spot but in after times his body was re∣moved to  Llandaff  The slaughter of the monks of  Bangor  about the year is supposed to have contributed to the population of this island for not only the brethren who es∣caped but numbers of other pious  Britons  fled hither to avoid the rage of the  Saxons  THE time in which the religious house was founded  CONVENT  is very uncertain it probably was before the retreat of  Dubritius  for something of that kind must have occasioned him to give the preference to this place It seems likely to have been a seat of the  Culdees  or  Colidei  the first religious recluses of  Great  Britain  who sought islands and desert places in which they might in security worship the true GOD It was certainly re∣sorted to in very early times for our accounts say that it flourished as a convent in the days of  Cadwan  king of  Britain  Rowlands    coeval with  Dubritius  It was an abbey dedicated to St  Mary  I find among the  Sebright  MSS mention of a petition from the abbot to  Edward  II in which he sets forth the injuries he had received from the sheriff of  Caernarvon  who had extorted from him s and d contrary to his deed of feoffment on which the king directed  Roger de Mortimer  justiciary of  Wales  to make enquiry into the matter who reported that the abbot held his lands in the county of  Caernarvon  in  puram et perpe∣tuam elemosynam  without any service or secular acknowlegement and further that  David  lord of  Lhein  and brother to the last Prince of  Wales  had exacted the same sum as did his  Pen∣cynydd  or master of his dogs possibly under pretence of maintaining them The king therefore by his special favor and by advice of his council does for ever remit the said sum and all arrears and directs that no one in future either on his account or that of his heirs ever should molest the convent  THE house underwent the common fate of others at the dis∣solution Its revenues were as  Dugdale  says  l    s    d  according to  Speed    l    s    d  In the year only  l    s    d  remained in charge to the surviving religious of this place  THE  British  name of the island is  Ynys Enlli  or the Island in the Current from the fierce current which rages particu∣larly  between it and the main land The  Saxons  named it  Bardseye  probably from the bards who retire here preferring solitude to the company of invading foreigners  THERE are great plenty of fish round the island and abun∣dance of lobsters the spiny lobster  Br Zool  iv N  o  is more frequent here than in most other places  WE reembarked from the rocks on the opposite side of the island to that on which we landed Rowed through the rapid current called the  Race of Bardsey  between the island and the great promontory  Braech y Pwll  the  Canganum Promontorium  of  Ptolemy  part of it is called from certain yellow stones  Maem Melyn  the rest is a vast precipice black and tremen∣dous After landing at  Aberdaron  I rid to its summit and found the ruins of a small church  CAPEL VAIR  called  Capel Vair  the Chapel of our Lady and I was informed that at the foot of the pro∣montory below highwater mark was a fountain of fresh water to which devotees were wont to descend by a circuitous and most hazardous path to get at lowwater a mouthful of the spring which if they carried up safe to the summit their wish whatsoever it was was to be surely fulfilled This was under the protection of our Lady and called  Ffynnon Vain  The chapel was placed here to give the seamen opportunity of invoking the tutelar saint for protection through this dangerous sound and I dare say in old times the walls were covered with votive tables Not far from hence I pasfed by the ruins of  Capel Anhelog  or the Chapel without Endowment  AFTER going through a fertile bottom ascended a lofty moun∣tain impending over the sea called  Uwch Mynydd  on which were several circular hollows edged with stone the tempo∣rary  VIEW OF BARDSEY ISLAND  habitations of perhaps some invader Descend and pass by a large and antient house called  Bethelem  NOT far from thence about a quarter of a mile from the shore rises a high rock called  Maen y Mellt  or The Stone of Lightning  MAEN Y MELLT  Ride by  Cefnamwlch  the seat of  John Griffith  Esq  and soon after to  Brynodol  that of  Hugh Griffith  Esq  where I met with a most hospitable reception for two nights From hence I visited the neighboring shore which is here low and rocky opening into frequent little creeks useful to the fishermen who find in them during the herringfishery a safe retreat from storms Among these are  Porth Towyn Porth Colman Porth Gwylan  and  Porth Ysgadan  Near the last about thirty years ago a rock which towered a great height out of the sea was suddenly missed after a horrible night of thunder and lightning supposed to have been struck down by the resistless bolt I observed that the fields about  Porth Gwylan  were covered with  y ddafad  or samphire which sheep and cattle eagerly feed on and grow very fat I was pleased here with the fine blossom of thrift glowing over numbers of the pastures  LLŶN or  Lleyn  is a very extensive hundred in general flat  LLŶN PRODUCE OF  but interspersed with most characteristic hills or rocks rising insulated in several parts none makes so conspicuous a figure as  Carn Madryn  and  Carn Boduon  The houses of the common people are very mean made with clay thatched and destitute of chimnies Notwithstanding the laudable example of the gentry the country is in an unimproved state neglected for the sake of the herringfishery The chief produce is oats and black cattle I was informed that above three thousand are  annually sold out of these parts Much oats barley butter and cheese are exported The land is excellent for grazing be∣ing watered by a thousand little rills It is destitute of trees except about the houses of the gentry  THE herrings about the year  HERRINGS  were taken here in vast abundance from  Porth Ysgadan  or the  Port of Herrings  to  Bard∣seye  island The capture amounted usually to the value of about four thousand pounds They were sometimes salted on shore at other times bought from the fishers by the  Irish  wherries at sea and carried to be cured in  Dublin  These desultory fish about the period mentioned appear in  July  and went away in  October  in earlier times they came in  September  and went away in  No∣vember Dories  are often taken here The fishermen were wont to fling them away on account of their ugly appearance nor was this luxury known to the gentry till one of their servants who was acquainted with the fish informed them of its being an inhabitant of thefe seas The  Atherine Br Zool  iii No is taken near  Pwllbeli  and a small lobster is often found burrowing in the sand but differs from the common kind only in its place of residence and in size The traps for lobsters are made with packthread like thiefnets and baited with pieces of the lesser spotted shark  Br Zool  iii N  o  The fishers remark that the sexes of these voracious fish confort at certain times apart for at certain periods they take only males at others only females  THE churches in this country are of very antient foundation Some cause or other prevented me from seeing several old inscriptions a few of which I have since picked up In the church of  Llangynodol  is said to be this  Hic jacet  GWEN HOEDL  a holy lady who lived in very early times DERVORI  hic jacet  is another inscription on a stone now placed over a door of  Pen∣prys  stable in  Llannor  parish  Sebright MSS  and at  Capel Yverach  in  Aber∣daron  parish is another which I think better expressed by an engraving  The same  They are cut on very rude stones and were cer∣tainly the work of the early times of Christianity  BRYNODOL by advantage of situation on the side of a hill commands a vast view of a flat woodless tract the sea and a noble mass of mountains The  Eist  hills  Boduon  and the vast  Carn Madryn  rise in the fore ground and beyond these soars all  Snowdonia  from those  alps  which surround the  Wyddfa  to the most remote in the county of  Meireonydd  ON quitting  Brynodol  I descended into an extensive flat  PORTH YN LLŶN  reached  Porth yn Llŷn  a fine safe and sandy bay guarded on the west by a narrow headland jutting far into the sea On part of it are the remains of very strong entrenchments pro∣bably an outpost of the  Romans  who as I shall have occasion to mention had another between this place and  Caernarvon  SEPARATED from this bay by a small headland is that of  Nefyn  and near it a small town of the same name  NEFYN  a contribu∣tory borough to  Caernarvon  This place had been bestowed on  Nigel de Lohareyn  by the Black Prince in the th year of his principality and made a free borough was allowed a guild mercatory with every privilege attendant on other free boroughs and all the liberties and customs granted here∣tofore to that of  Newborough  in  Anglesey  He also gave it a grant of two fairs annually and a market on a  Sunday  to  which the inhabitants of that part of the  Commot y Llŷn  then called  Dynthlayn  were obliged to resort  HERE  Edward  I in held his triumph on the conquest of  Wales  and perhaps to conciliate the affections of his new subjects in imitation of our hero  Arthur held a round table and celebrated it with dance and tournament  Ad rotundam tabulam juxta  Snowdon  praeonizatam in choreis et hastiludiis ad invicem colludentibus  Annal Waverleins▪  in  Gale  ii    Where throngs of knights and barons bold  In weeds of peace high triumphs hold  With store of ladies whose bright eyes  Rain influence and judge the prize  Of wit or arms while both contend  To win her grace whom all commend  TOURNAMENT  The concourse was prodigious for not only the chief nobi∣lity of  England  but numbers from foreign parts graced the festival with their presence  THE custom is very antient for it may be derived even higher than the days of  Arthur  We may allow that he held his round table on account of one of his victories and that he had fourandtwenty knights who sat at the festive board which might have been designedly made of a circular form in order to destroy all dispute about preeminence of seat But the  Gauls  also sate at their round tables and every knight had at his back a squire with his armour in waiting  Athenaeus  lib iv  This gallant assem∣bly was held for many ages after Besides this held at  Nefyn  another was presented by Earl  Mortimer  at  Kenilworth  where the knights performed their martial exercises and the ladies danced

surrounded with a high mound a ditch in the inside and two entrances one opposite to the other for the knights to enter at and make their onset One of these I have seen by  Penrith  which bears the name of  Arthur  's round table  Tour in Scotland  d ed  others which are far larger I found on  Thornborough  heath in  Yorkshire  of which I may in future time give some account  ASCEND from  Nefyn  for a considerable way up the side of the high hill and after a short ride on level ground quit our horses in order to visit  Nant y Gwrtheyrn  or  Vortigen's valley  VORTIGERN'S VALLEY  the immense hollow to which  Vortigern  is said to have fled from the rage of his subjects and where it was said that he and his castle were consumed with lightning  Nennius  Hist Br  c xlviii  places the scene near the  Teivi  in  Caermarthenshire  but I believe that the historian not only mistakes the spot but even the man∣ner of his death His life had been profligate the monks therefore were determined that he should not die the common death of all men and accordingly made him perish with signal marks of the vengeance of Heaven Fancy cannot frame a place more fit for a retreat from the knowlege of mankind or more apt to inspire one with full hopes of security from any pursuit Embosomed in a lofty mountain on two sides bounded by  stony steeps on which no vegetables appear but the blasted heath and stunted gorse the third side exhibits a most tremen∣dous front of black precipice with the loftiest peak of the mountain  Eifl  soaring above and the only opening to this secluded spot is towards the sea a northern aspect where that chilling wind exerts all its fury and half freezes during winter the few inhabitants The glen is tenanted by three families who raise oats and keep a few cattle sheep and goats but seem to have great difficulty in getting their little produce to market  JUST above the sea is a high and verdant mount natural but the top and sides worked on by art The first flat∣ted the sides marked with eight prominent ribs from top to bottom On this might have been the residence of the unfortunate prince of which time has destroyed every other vestige Till the beginning of the last century a tumulus of stone within and externally covered with turf was to be seen here it was known by the name of  Bedd Gwrtheyrn  tradi∣tion having regularly delivered down the report of this having been the place of his interment The inhabitants of the parish perhaps instigated by their then minister Mr  Hugh Roberts  a person of curiosity dug into the carn and found in it a stone coffin containing the bones of a tall man  Kenne's Paroch Antiq Hist Allchester    This gives a degree of credibility to the tradition especially as no other bones were found with it no other  tumuli  on the spot a proof at lest of respect to the rank of the person and that the place was deserted after the death of the royal fugitive about the year  AFTER emerging out of this chearless bottom I found fresh and amazing matter of speculation I got into a  bwlch  or hollow between two summits of the  Eifl  mountains  THE EIFL HILLS  a range that makes a most distinguished figure with the sugarloaf points from various and distant parts of the country they range obliquely and separate  Lleyn  from the hundred of  Arfon  and jut into the sea near  Vortigern's valley  ACROSS this hollow from one summit of the  Eifl  to the other extends an immense rampart of stones or perhaps the ruins of a wall which effectually blocked up the pass On the  Eifl  is the most perfect and magnificent as well as the most artful of any  British  post I ever beheld It is called  Tre'r Caeri  TRE'R CAERI  or the  Town of the Fortresses  This which was the accessible side is defended by three walls the lowest is very imperfect the next tolerably entire and has in it the grand entrance This wall in one part points upwards towards the third wall which runs round the edges of the top of the hill the second wall unites with the first which runs into a point re∣verts and joins the highest in a place where the hill becomes inaccessible The facings on the two upper walls are very entire especially that of the uppermost They are lofty and exhibit from below a grand and extensive front The space on the top is an irregular area part is steep part flat in most parts covered with heath giving shelter to a few red grouse The whole is almost filled with cells To be seen with advantage the station should be taken from the summit about which the cells are very distinct and disposed with much art About the middle is a square place fenced with stones a sort of  praetorium  surrounded with two rows of cells numbers  are also scattered about the plain and others again are conti∣guous to the wall all along the inside  THE cells are mostly perfect of various forms round oval oblong square Some of the round were fifteen feet in dia∣meter of the oblong thirty feet in length with long entrances regularly faced with stone All of them when inhabited were well protected from the weather by roofs of thatch or sod  THE upper wall was in many places fifteen feet high on the outside and often sixteen feet broad It consisted of two pa∣rallel and contiguous parts one higher than the other serving as a parapet to the lower which seemed to have had its walk like that on the walls of  Chester  There was in one place a cell in the thickness of the wall or perhaps a sallyport in part stopped by the fallingin of the stones  I was determined to trace every species of fortress of this nature which lay in the neighborhood On descending from  Tre'r Caeri  to the south  GARY GUWCH  I very soon ascended  Moel Garn Guwh  a hill of conic form on the summit of which is a prodigious heap of stones seemingly a shapeless ruin if it was not for the appearance of certain facings of a central cell still remaining to prove that it had been a large tower and an outpost to the preceeding place These ruins are called by the country people  A  g  d y G  s  or The apronfull of stones flung  down by  he G  s  I MUST remark that from the  Eift  saw sveral other lesser eminences fortified in a manner nearly similar I may men∣tion  Carn Madryn  before described the hill of  Boduan  above    covered with similar cells  Meel ben Twrch  between    and  Castell Gwgan  remarkable for a  CLYNNOG  small circular intrenchment and to these I may add another fortified hill called  Pen y Gaer  on the other side of the pass which leads from  Arfon to Llŷn  all which makes it probable that this country was the retreat of multitudes of  Britons  to escape the first fury of the  Saxon  invaders  AFTER viewing the  ArffedogedyGowres  I descended to the village and church of  LlanAelhaiearn  LLANAELHALEARN  the last dedicated to St  Aelhaiearn  or the saint with an  iron eyebrow  from a legend too absurd to relate Near it is a fine well once much fre∣quented for its reputed sanctity Continue descending on the right are the high conic hills of  Gern goch  and  Gern ddu  the extremity of the long chain which extends obliquely from  Snowdon  beginning at  Talmignèdd  Reach  CLYNNOG  CLYNNOG  seated in a small grove near the shore on a plain near the foot of the hills  CHURCH  The church is the most magnificent structure of its kind in  North Wales  built in form of a cross the length from east to west is about a hundred and thirtyeight feet from north to south seventy Near the altar are three neat stalls divided by pillars supporting gothic arches the seats of the officiating priests The monuments are few one to  Wil∣liam Glynn de Lleiar  with his figure and those of his wife and seven children another to his soninlaw  George Twisleton  Esq  of  Aula Barrow  in  Yorkshire  and in right of his wife of  Lleiar  I imagine him to be the same with Colonel  Twisleton  an active officer under  Cromwell  and the same who had the honor of beating and making prisoner the gallant Sir  John Owen  Whitelock's Memorials  and    ADJOINING to the church is the chapel of St  Beuno  The passage to it is a narrow vault covered with great flat stones and of far greater antiquity than either church or chapel which seem nearly coeval  Leland  speaks of the first as  new worke  and the architecture verifies his account He speaks also of the old church where St  Beuno  lieth being near the new  Itin v    The passage is the only part left The chapel was probably built after that traveller had visited the place in the room of the old church which might have fallen to ruin In the midst is the tomb of the saint plain and altarshaped  TOMB OF ST BEUNO  Vota∣ries were wont to have great faith in him and did not doubt but that by means of a night's lodging on his tomb a cure would be found for all diseases It was customary to cover it with rushes and leave on it till morning sick children after making them first undergo ablution in the neighboring holy well and I myself once saw on it a feather bed on which a poor paralytic from  Meirionyddshire  had lain the whole night after undergoing the same ceremony  I HAVE given some account of St  Beuno  in the preceding volume  p    ST BEUNO ACCOUNT OF  After he had assumed the monastic habit he here founded a convent in  Cadvan  king of  North Wales  was his great patron and promised him much land his son  Cad∣wallan  performed the promise and received from the Saint a golden sceptre worth sixty cows The land was clamed in behalf of a little infant and his title proved good the king refuses either to give other land in lieu or to resign the pre∣sent  Beuno  cursed him and went away but was appeased by  Gwrddeint  first cousin to the king who overtook him and  gave the town of  Celynnog  for ever to GOD and St  Beuno  for his own soul's sake and that of the wicked  Cadwallan  Long after his time the  Carmelites  or white monks had here an establishment They were suppressed but I cannot learn the period At the time of the  Lincoln  taxation or the year the church was collegiate consisting of five portionists or pre∣bendaries and it continued so to the dissolution  Tanner    The rectory is a sinecure annexed to the headship of JESUS College  Oxford  the poor vicarage is the gift of the bishop  ITS revenues at the dissolution are not recorded but they must at one time have been very

churchwardens who sell and account for them and put it into a great chest called  Cyff St Beino  made of one piece of oak secured with three locks From this the  Welsh  have a proverb for attempting any very difficult thing You may as well try  "to break up St  Beuno  's chest" The little money resulting from the sacred beasts or casual offerings is either applied to the relief of the poor or in aid of repairs  THOSE who are curious in druidical antiquities  A CROMLEH  may see a very uncommon  Cromleh  on the tenement of  Bachwen  about half a mile from this place The inclination of the upper stone is to the west on its surface are numbers of small shallow holes with two or three larger than the rest possibly for some purpose of augury At thirty paces distance is an upright stone placed as is supposed to mark the limits of approach to the people while the rites were performing by the  Druid∣priest  THE distance from  Clynnog  to  Caernarvon  is ten miles a continued plain the mountains recede gradually from the sea so as to leave a considerable extent of level ground as we ap∣proach the capital of the county The road is excellent and the greatest part has the merit of being made at the expence of the parishes The shore is low gravelly or sandy and forms one side of the bay of  Caernarvon  CROSS the  Llyfni  a rapid stream flowing out of  Llyn Nanlle  I heard here of a strong camp called  Carreg y Di∣nas  of which I find this note in the MS travels of the late ingenious Dr  Mason  of  Cambridge  He mentions it as being placed upon the  Isthmus  of the  Llyfni  opposite to the house of  Lleiar  The three sides to the river are very steep the fourth is defended by two fosses and two banks made chiefly of stone especially the inner one which is six yards high In the middle is a mount possibly the ruins of a tower The entrance is at the east end between the ends of the banks  ABOUT three miles  DINAS DINLLE  turn to the left to visit  Dinas Dinlle  a vast mount of gravel and sand on the verge of a great marsh upon the shore On the top is a large area surrounded by an amaz∣ing agger seemingly formed by the earth scooped out of the summit Within are remains of foundations of buildings of an oblong form constructed with earth and round stones and in one part is a tumulus of the same materials On the outside of the agger on one part is a very deep ditch with another high rampart and the ground towards the base seems every where to have been smoothed by art There is a regular entrance at one end on the other the ground slopes to the sea and is quite open a defence being there needless The waves have made great depredations and worn one side into a cliff I must attribute this fortress to the  Romans  and am the more confirmed in my notion as I am informed that coins have been found here among which was one of  Alectus  The  Romans  might possibly be induced to form this post to secure a landingplace for any necessaries the country might want for the entrance into the port  Segontium  ▪s often even at pre∣sent very difficult much more so in the earlier times of navi∣gation  THAT intelligent traveller and able botanist Mr  Thomas Johnson  An ingenious apothecary the editor of  Gerard's Herbal  He travelled through  North Wales  in to collect plants He published his tour in a small volume under the title of  Mercurius Botanicus  He was slain in the defence of  Basing stoke  House in  speaks thus of  Dinas Dinlle  Stationem hie in ipso littore  Romani  milites habuerunt cujus adhuc satis clara vestigia manent  Possibly there may be another of the  same kind for I find in the old maps both of  Saxton  and  Speed  the name  Caer Ierienrode  a little lower down at the mouth of the  Llyfni  and by the addition of the word  Caer  it must have been a fortified place  WHEN I made my visit to  Dinas Dinlle  I was under the guidance of a worthy friend and learned antiquary the Re∣verend  Richard Farrington  now deceased He conducted me to his residence at  Dines Dincethwy  about four miles distant In the way he shewed to me  Dinas y Prif  or The Post of the Chieftain a small camp about fortyfour yards square Each corner is elevated above the ramparts and withinside are foundations of some stone buildings By the name it might be the summer station of the  Roman  commander in chief resident in winter at  Segontium  FROM  Dinas  I visited  Glynllivon  a house built by the late Sir  John Wynn  seated near the little river  Llifon  issuing from the  Kilgwyn  mountain  Cilmin Troedddu  or  Cilmin  with a  black foot  one of the fifteen tribes of  North Wales  and nephew to  Merfyn Fryeh  prince of  Wales  slain in had his residence on this spot From him are descended the family of the  Glynns  who took their name from the place They bear in allusion to the name of their ancestor a man's leg  coupè a la cuisse  sable A ridiculous legend tells you that  Cilmin  's leg became so dis∣colored by escaping from a daemon whose books he had assisted a magician to steal In leaping over a brook which was to be the limit of the pursuit  Cilmin  's left leg plunged into the water and assumed its sable dye Our stories are absurd but not more so than an Eastern tale  Glynllivon  came into pos∣session of the late Sir  John Wynn  by the marriage of his father  Tho Wynn  Esq  Afterwards created a Baronet He died in  April    of  Boduan  with  Frances  second daughter to  John Glynn  Esq  of  Glynllivon  CONTINUE my journey on a turnpike road Cross at  Pont Newydd  the  Gwyrfai  which flows from  Llyn Cwellyn  CAERNARVON  and soon after cross the  Seiont  and reach CAERNARVON  THIS town is justly the boast of  North Wales  for the beauty of situation goodness of the buildings regularity of the plan and above all the grandeur of the castle the most magnificent badge of our subjecton The place sprung from the ruin of the antient  Segontium  but it does not owe its name to  Edward  I as is generally supposed  Giraldus Cambrensis  mentions it in his journey of the year  Iter Cambr    and  Llewelyn the Great  dates from it a charter in the year  This charter is to the Canons of  Penmon Sebright MSS  I greatly suspect the  Caernarvon  of those times to have been no other than the antient  Segontium  whose name the  Welsh  had changed to the apt one of  Caer ar Fôn  or The strong hold opposite to  Anglesey  But the present town was in all probability a creation of our conqueror A judicious warrior such as  Edward  could not fail profiting of so fit a situ∣ation for a curb on the newconquered country It had natural requisites for strength being bounded on one side by the arm of the sea called the  Menai  by the estuary of the  Seiont  on another exactly where it receives the tide from the former on a third side and part of the fourth by a creek of the  Me∣nai  and the remainder has the appearance of having the in∣sulation completed by art  Edward  undertook this great work immediately after his conquest of the country in and completed the fortifications and castle before for his queen on  April  th in that year brought forth within its  walls  Edward  first prince of  Wales  of the  English  line It was built within the space of one year by the labor of the peasants and at the cost of the chieftains of the country on whom the conqueror imposed the hateful task  Sebright MSS    Henry Ellerton  or  de Elreton  was appointed master mason of the castle  Sebright  and  Gloddaeth MSS  and per∣haps was the architect and under him must have been num∣bers of other skilful workmen for I dare say that the  Welsh  peasants were no mare than cutters of wood and hewers of stone It is probable that many of the materials were brought from  Segontium  or the old  Caernarvon  and tradition says that much ot the limestone with which it is built was brought from  Twrkelyn  in  Anglesey  and of the gritstone from  Vaenol  in this county The  Menai  greatly facilitated the car∣riage from both places  THE external state of the walls and castle are at present exactly as they were in the time of  Edward  The walls are defended by numbers of round towers and have two principal gates the east facing the mountains the west upon the  Menai  The entrance into the castle is very august beneath a great tower on the front of which appears the statue of the founder with a dagger in his hand as if menacing his newacquired unwilling subjects The gate had four portcullises and every requisite of strength The court is oblong The towers are very beautiful none of them round but pentago∣nal hexagonal or octagonal two are more lofty than the rest The Eagle tower is remarkably fine and has the ad∣dition of three slender angular turrets issuing from the top  Edward  II was born in a little dark room in this tower not  CAERNARYON CASTLE  twelve feet long nor eight in breadth so little did in those days a royal consort consult either pomp or conveniency  QUEEN'S GATE  The gate through which the affectionate  Eleanor  entered to give the  Welsh  a prince of their own who could not speak a word of  English  is at the farthest end at a vast height above the out∣side ground so could only be approached by a drawbridge In his sixteenth year the prince received the homage of his duped  subjects  at  Chester  Powel    invested as marks of his dignity with a chaplet of gold round his head a golden ring on his finger and a silver sceptre in his hand  Dodridge's Wales      THE walls of this fortress are about seven feet nine inches thick and have within their thickness a most convenient gal∣lery with narrow slips for the discharge of arrows The walls of the Eagle Tower are near two feet thicker The view from its summit is very fine of the  Menai Anglesey  and the nearer parts of the  British alps  THE first whom I find appointed by  Edward  to be governor of the castle was  John de Havering  with a salary of two hun∣dred marks for which he was obliged to maintain constantly besides his own family fourscore men of which fifteen were to be crossbowmen one chaplain one surgeon and one smith the rest were to do the duty of keepers of the gates centinels and other necessary offices  Sebright MSS    IN I find that the king had appointed  Adam de Weten∣hall  to the same important office  Ayloff's Rotulae Wailiae      THE establishment for town and castle was as follows  THE constable of the castle had sometimes sixty pounds at others only forty  THE captain of the town had  l    s    d  for his annual fee but this office was sometimes annexed to the former and then the see was  l  for both  THE constable and the captain had twentyfour soldiers al∣lowed them for the defence of the place at the wages of  d  per day each Surely this slight garrison was only during peaceful times  The porter of the gates of the town had for his annual see  l    s  Dedridge      I can discover no more than two instances of this place hav∣ing suffered by the calamities of war In the great insurrec∣tion of the  Welsh  under  Madog  in they surprised the town during the time of a fair and put many  English  to the sword  Powel    and according to Mr  Carte  Carte  ii  took the castle that of  Snowdon Conway  and made himself master of all  Anglesey  In the last century Captain  Swanly  a parlementarian officer took the town in made four hundred prisoners and got a great quantity of arms ammunition and pillage The royal∣ists afterwards repossessed themselves of the place Lord  Byron  was appointed governor was besieged by General  Mytton  in and yielded the place on the most honorable terms In the General himself and Colonel  Moson  were besieged in it by Sir  John Owen  who hearing that Colonel  Carter  and Co∣lonel  Twisselton  were on the march to relieve the place drew a party from the siege in order to attack them on the way The parties met near  Llandegay  Sir  John  was defeated and made  prisoner and after that all  North Wales  submitted to the par∣lement  Whitelock      THE quay is a most beautiful walk along the side of the  Me∣nai  QUAY  and commands a most agreeable view  CAERNARVON is destitute of manufactures  TRADE  but has a brisk trade with  London Bristol Leverpool  and  Ireland  for the several necessaries of life It is the residence of numbers of genteel families and contains several very good houses a very antient one called  Plâs Pulesdon  is remarkable for the fate of its first owner Sir  Roger de Pulesdon  ROGER DE PULES∣DON  a distinguished favorite of  Edward  I He had been appointed sheriff and keeper of the county of  Anglesey  Ayloff's Rotulae Walliae    in What office he held here I am unacquainted with but in being directed to levy the subsidy for the  French  war a tax the  Welsh  had never been accustomed to they took up arms and hanged  de Pulesdon  and several of his people This was a signal for a general insurrection  Madoc  a relation of the late Prince  Llewelyn  headed the people of this country  Edward  marched against them in person and with great difficulty reduced the country to submit again to his yoke  Matt Westm      THE church is no more than a chapel to  Llan Beblic  CHAPEL  and probably originally only a chapel to the garrison  EDWARD I bestowed on  Caernarvon  its first royal charter  CHARTER  and made it a free borough Among other privileges none of the burgesses could be convicted of any crime committed be∣tween the rivers  Conwy  and  Dyfy  unless by a jury of their own townsmen  Sebrigbt MSS  It is governed by a mayor who by patent  is created governor of the castle  CORPORATION  It has one alderman two bailiffs a townclerk and two serjeants at mace The repre∣sentative of the place is elected by its burgesses and those of  Conwy Pwllbeli Nefyn  and  Crickaeth  The right of voting is in every one resident or nonresident admitted to their freedom  Willis's Notitia Parliam  iii Part i  FIRST MEMBERS  The first member was  John Puleston  and the second time it sent representatives which was in the st of  Edward  VI it chose  Robert Puleston  and the county elected  John  The same Part ii pp  as if both town and county determined to make re∣paration to the family for the cruelty practised on its an∣cestor  The mother church of  Caenarvon  is about half a mile south∣east of the town is called  Llan Beblic  being dedicated to Sr  Peblic  or  Peblicius  according to our historians son of  Maxon Wledic    Maximus  the tyrant and his wife  Helen  daughter of  Euddaf  It is said that he retired from the world and took a religious habit  Rowlands' Mena denqua      Richard  II bestowed this church and the chayel of  Caernarvon  on the nuns of St  Mary  's in  Chester  in consideration of their poverty  Sebright MSS  I find in the recital of another charter of the same prince that his grandfather  Edward  III had bestowed on those religious the advowson of  Llangathen  in  Caer∣martsoershire  The same  both which on the dissolution were annexed to the see of  Chester  and remain to this day under the patronage of the Bishop of  Chester  In the church is the tomb of a son  This son for the name is defaced seems from the pedigree of the family to have been Sir  Rhys Gryffydd  of Sir  William Gryffydd  of  Per  byn  who died in and  Margaret  daughter to  John Wynne ap Mereddyd  Their figures are in white marble lying on a mat admirably carved He is in armour She has on a short quilled ruff and quilled ruffles at her wrists in a long gown and a sash round her waist  NEAR the steep bank of the river  Seiont  ROMAN FORT  at a small distance from the castle is an ancient  Roman  fort On two sides the walls are pretty entire one is seventyfour yards long the other which points to the river is sixtyfour The height ten feet eight inches The thickness six feet Much of the facing is taken away which discovers the peculiarity of the  Roman  masonry It consists of regular courses the others have the stones disposed in zigzag fashion Along the walls are three parallel lines of round holes not three inches in diameter nicely plastered within which pass through the whole thickness There are other similar holes which are discovered in the end of the wall and seem to run through it lengthways I can discover the use of neither one or other Those that run through the walls are supposed to be for the purpose of annoy∣ing an enemy with arrows but from the smallness of the dia∣meter a compass of aim in directing the shot is wanting Near the corner of one of the walls is a heap of stones the ruins of a tower for on digging some years ago the founda∣tion of a found one was discovered It was paved and in it were found the horn of a deer and skeletons of some lesser ani∣mals This place seems intended to secure a landingplace from the  Seiont  at time of high water and I was informed that in  Tre'r Beblic  on the opposite shore had been other ruins the work of the same people  AT a small distance above this  SEGONTIUM  and about a quarter of a mile from the  Menai  is the antient  Segontium  to the use of which the fort had been subservient It forms an oblong of a very considerable extent seemingly about six acres placed on the summit of rising ground and sloping down on every side It is now divided by the public road but in several parts are vestiges of walls and in one place appears the remnant of a building made with tiles and plastered with very hard and smooth mortar this seems to have been part of a  hypocaust  The mortar in all other parts is very hard and mixed with much gravel and sand At present a public road passes through the midst of this antient station beyond which the  Romans  had only a small outpost or two in this county A gold coin of about seventeen shillings weight was found here inscribed T DIVI AVG FIL AVGVTVS  CAMBDEN suspects that this might have been the  Setantiorum Portus  of  Ptolemy  being willing to read it  Segontiorum  ii  but the situation of the former is certainly at the mouth of the  Ribble  He may be right in supposing it to have been in after times named  Caer Custenin  or the Castle of  Constantine  Nennius  and that  Hugh Lupus  who certainly invaded  Anglesey  in had here a temporary post How far the relation of  Matthew  of  West∣minster  that  Censtantius  father of  Constantine  was interred here may be depended on I will not say nor whether as the histo∣rian farther asserts that  Edward  caused the body to be taken up and honorably reburied in the church I suppose of St  Publicius  Mat Westm    Mr  Rowlands  says that  Helen  the mother of  Pub∣licius  had a chapel here which he tells us was in being in his days  Mona Antiq    Helen  was born at  Segontium  A well near the fort bears the name of that princess and some very slight remains of ruins are to be seen adjacent Tradition says the chapel stood on that spot  THE traveller who wishes to visit  Snowdon  ROAD FROM CAERNARVON TO SNOWDON  from this town may have a very agreeable ride After crossing the  Fai  or  Gwyrfai  This river issues out of  Llyn Cwellyn  and separates the two Hundreds of  UwchGwrfai  and  IsGwrfai  at  Pont y Bettws  about four miles and a half from  Caernarvon  he will find about the village of  Bettws Garmon  or  IsGwrfai  a beautiful cascade fronting him as he passes up a valley which consists of verdant meadows watered by the same river and bounded by hills rising fast into  alpine  majesty He will go under  Moel Elian  a noble mountain of a stupendous bulk cloathed with a smooth green turf and most regularly rounded He will pass on the right near  Castell Cedwm  said by Mr  Rowlands  to be one of the guards to the entrance into  Snowdon  it is a great rock which I did not ascend so cannot certify whether it had any works like those of other  British  posts The lake  Cwellyn  here almost fills the valley a water famous for its Char which are taken in nets in the first winter months and after that season retire to the inaccessible depths In former times this water was called from the steepness of its banks  Llyn y Torlennydd  Above on the right side of the lake soars the magnificent  Mynnydd Vawr  smooth on the top but the sides receding inwards in a semicircular form exhi∣biting a tremendous precipice Soon after this the vale ex∣pands  y Wyddfa  appears full in view The traveller will pass by LLYN Y CADER and join in my former tour at  Bedd Kelert  FROM  Caernarvon  I crossed in the ferry to  Tal y Voel  in the island of ANGLESEY  THE  Menai  is here two miles broad In my passage had a view of  Abermenai  ABERMENAI  the very narrow passage into the port of  Caernarvon  and rendered more dangerous by the sands both within and without  Abermenai  has its ferry and is one of the five over this strait They were originally the property of the crown of  England  till  Henry  VIII granted all of them to  Richard Gifford  one of the sewers of his chamber who again set them to  William Bulkely  in the d year of his royal master but since that period every one has been transferred to other hands  I SOON reached  Newborough  NEWBOROUGH  about three miles from the shore a place greatly fallen away from its antient splendor Here had been one of the resi¦dences of his princes In Mr  Row∣lands'  time the foundation of the  Llŷs  or palace was to be seen a little to the south of the church which is supposed to have been the domestic chapel In its neighborhood at  Vrondeg  is a stone which I overlooked I find it mentioned in the manuscripts of Mr ROWLANDS who has given the following inscription CUR FILIUS CUURICINI EREXIT HUNC LAPIDEM The author of the History of  Anglesey  P Printed for  Dodsley  to  also men∣tions it but varies in the name of the founder and his father  His reading is thus FILIUS ULRICI EREXIT HUNC LAPIDEM I am credibly informed that the inscription is at present ille∣gible but the style of the memorial induces me to give it to a  Dane  such are extremely frequent in  Scandinavia  STO∣DINGUS  fecit erigi lapidem  in memoriam ARNONIS  filii sui qui profectus est in  HARDALAM  Peringskioldi Monum Suevgothic    THORSTATUM GURA  fecerunt erigi saxum in memoriam  LAFSONIS  patris sui  The same  and the imper∣fect one like this of  Ulric  SAXO  lapidem hunc posuit  Wormii Mon Danica    are proofs of the custom in the  Baltic  kingdoms  THE  Danes  frequently invaded  Anglesey  and between the years and  Godfryd  the son of  Harold  subdued the whole island  Powel    a pious son in one of the times might according to the custom of his country have erected this monument to his father but from the imperfect state of the inscription we are at a loss to know whether it was sepulchral or votive  NEWBOROUGH or more properly  Rhosvair  the  British  name was a manor of our princes It was divided into two parts the one consisted of officers of the houshold under the prince which were of two kinds and had twelve gavels in land be∣tween them part maintained the  Maerdrefyrs  or persons who overlooked his demesn the other was for the  Garddwyr  certain persons resembling our cottagers who possessed small parcels of land called  Gardds  Record of Caer∣narvon in Biblioth Litteraria    There were besides eight gavels which were the property of freeholders the posterity of whom en∣joyed the same to the very time of my author Mr  Rowlands  This was also the feat of justice for the whole commot of  Menai  and continued so long after it became subject to the  English  A respect to a royal seat was still maintained by the new royal possessors It became a manor of the princes of  Wales Ed∣ward  I erected the town into a corporation and gave it a gild mercatory and other privileges which were confirmed by parlement in the first year of  Edward  III  Mr Rowlands' MSS  From this time it was called  Newborough  In the latter part of that reign were found ninetythree houses thirteen gardens one orchard twelve cro  ts and sixty small pieces of ground inclosed for the use of the houses The crown had its steward for this district with a salary of ten pounds a year The palace and royal chapel existed in the time of  Edward  III for it appears by an inquisition taken here in before  William de Shalde∣ford  representative of  Richard  Earl of  Arundel  justiciary of  North Wales  that the tenants of the commot of  Menai  had been required to put those buildings into repair but on their representing that if that duty was put in force they would be of little or no advantage to the king the justiciary was directed to enquire into the truth and whether it would not be better for him to take an annual sum in lieu of the repairs not only of the palace and chapel but of all the other buildings on the royal manor  Sebright MSS  In after times it had the honor of send∣ing representatives to the  British  parlement  Richard ap Rhydderch ap Myfyrian  sate in the third of  Henry  VIII and  John ap Robert Llwyd  in the first of  Edward  VI who in the next year transferred this honor to  Beaumaris  The glory of  Newborough  is now passed away  IT now subsists by a manufacture of mats and  Rhosir mor∣hesg  ropes made of sea reedgrass a plant of which Queen  Elizabeth  in tenderness to such of her subjects who lived on sandy shores wisely prohibited the extirpation  See the sad effects of these moveable sands in Mr  Cordiner's Letters  and my  Tour Scotl  th ed  in order to prevent the misfortunes which have since happened of having half the parish buried in the unstable sands by the rage of tempests  SUCH is the case of  Llanddwyn  LLANDDWYN  a parish which extends below into the sea and terminates in a narrow peninsula almost the whole is at present covered with sandhills We are told that in the time of  Edward  III there were on it no more than eight small houses or as they were then called  weles  Rowlands' MSS  yet in the reign of  Henry  VIII it was one of the richest prebends in the cathedral of  Bangor  Its wealth arose not from the real fertility of the place but from the superstition of the common people from pilgrimages to crosses reliques holy wells or∣deals and what Mr  Rowlands  calls  or divination from fishes  The same  In the time of  Owen Glyndwr  one  Yerwerth Vychan  rector of  Llanddoged  made pretensions to the offerings and sacrilegiously seized on them but  Griffydd le Yonge  chan∣cellor to our hero interfered and by a decree of his put a slop to the invasion of the rights of the place  The same  and  Hist Anglesey    ON the peninsula are the ruins of the church  CHURCH  dedicated to St  Deuwen  daughter of  Brychan  one of the holy  Colidei  or primitive Christians of  Britain  Near it are the small remains  of the prebendal house The first appears to have been no inelegant building The laft is noted for the residence of  Richard Kyssyu  then rector of  Llanddwyn  and afterwards dean of  Bangor  He was a strenuous friend to the house of  Lancaster  and here concerted with Sir  Rhys ap Thomas  and other  Welsh  chieftains a plan for the bringing in the Duke of  Richmond  then in  Britany  to whom they transmitted by means of fish∣ingvessels all necessary intelligence  FROM  Newborough  I several years ago made an excursion to  Ahersraw  about seven miles to the north in search of another palace of our antient princes They took one of their titles from this place  Princeps de Ahersraw  which preceded that of  Dominus de Snowdon  I crossed at lowwater the arm of the sea called  Malltraeth  LLANGADWA∣LADR  and rode by the church of  LlanGadwa∣ladr  said to have been founded by  Cadwalladr  last king of the  Britons  and made one of the sanctuaries of the island Over the door is said to be an inscription in memory of  Cadvan  grandfather to the founder to this effect CATAMANUS  Rex sa∣pientissimus opimutissimus omnium Regums  Cambden  ii  Rawlands    The stone on which this is inscribed is said tobe in form of a coffin and pro∣bably in the former church had a more suitable place  ABOUT a mile or two farther reach the site of the princely residence  ABERFRAW  It is now reduced to a few poor houses seated on the river  Ffraw  near a small bay Not a vestige is to be seen of its former boast It was a chief seat of our princes and one of the three courts of justice for the principality  Leges Wallicae    Here was always kept one of the three copies of the antient  code of laws another at  Dinevawr  in  Caermarthenshire  and the third was kept by the  Blegored  or doctors of laws for their constant use  Leges Wallicae    This place was of great antiquity being one of the three fixed on by  Roderic  the  Great  about the year for the residence of his successors In it was ravaged by the  Irish  Powel    An extent was made of  Aberfraw  in the th  Edward  III from which may be learned some of the antient revenues of the  Welsh  princes It appears that part arose from rents of lands from the profit of mills and fisheries and often in things in kind but the last were frequently com∣muted for their value in money Thus one place payed XIII  s  VII  d  instead of butter milk and services in work and another dis∣trict rendered for CIV sheep IX hens and XXXVII  s  II  d  in lieu of the labor of a hundred and sixtyone days  BUT to return to the  Menai  From  Newhorough  I visited  Llanidan  LLANIDAN  a seat of Lord  Boston  's finely situated on that arm of the sea commanding upwards a beautiful prospect of  Caernar∣von  and the  Snowdon  hills The church which is adjacent was once belonging to the convent of  Beddcelert  In it followed the sate of that house Queen  Elizabeth  granted it to  Edmond Downam  and  Peter Ashton  who sold it in to  Richard Prytherch  of  Myfyrian  whose daughter married a  Llwyd  of  Llugwy  on the other side of the island On the ex∣tinction of that family all their estates were bought by Lord  Uxbridge  who left them to his nephew Sir  William Irby  the late Lord  Boston  IN the church is a reliquary made neither of gold nor silver  nor yet ornamented with precious stones but of very ordinary gritstone with a rooflike cover Whether it contained any reliques of the patron saint a St  Aiden  of whom the venerable  Bede  makes such honorable mention  De vita Cudbercti  c  I cannot say The church of  Durham  possessed his cross three of his teeth his head and two Griffin's eggs  Smith's Beda App  N  o  XV  The living is a rectory but saddled with the churches of  Llanedwen Llanddaniel  and  Llanvair y Cwmmwd  I MUST not pass unnoticed the celebrated stone  Maen Mordbwyd  or the stone  of the thigh  now well secured in the wall of this church In old times it was so constant to one place that let it be carried ever so far it would be sure of returning at night  Hugh Lupus  Earl of  Chester  determined to subdue its locomotive faculties fastened it with iron chains to a far greater stone and flung it into the sea but to the astonish∣ment of all beholders it was found the next morning in its usual place  Giraldus Itin Cambr  lib ii c vii and  Powel  's note  Giraldus  says the stone took its name from its shape    I NOW enter on classical ground and the pious seats of the antient  Druids  the sacred groves the altars and monumental stones A slight mention of what I saw must content my reader who is referred to the works of the celebrated and learned Mr  Henry Rowlands  the former rector of this place and to those of my friend the late reverend Dr  Borlase  who hath added fresh illustrations of these obscure remains  AT  Tre'r Dryw  TRE'R DRYW  or the habitation of the  ArchDruid  I met with the mutilated remains described by Mr  Rowlands  His  Bryn Gwyn  or  Brein Gwyn  or royal tribunal is a circular hollow of a hundred and eighty feet in diameter surrounded by an immense agger of earth and stones evidently brought from some other place there not being any mark of their being taken from the spot It has only a single entrance This is supposed to have been the grand consistory of the druidical administration  Not far from it was one of the  Gorseddau  now in a manner dispersed but once consisted of a great copped heap of stones on which sate aloft a  Druid  instructing the surrounding people  Mona Antiq    tab iv  multa de Deorum immortalium vi et potestate disputare et juven∣tuti tradunt  Cesar Bel Gal  lib vi    HERE were also the reliques of a circle of stones with the  Cromlech  in the midst but all extremely imperfect Two of the stones are

yet remain This circle when complete was one of the temples of the Druids in which their religious rites were performed It is the conjecture of Mr  Rowlands  that the whole of these remains were surrounded with a circle of OAKS and formed a deep and sacred grove  Tam per se roborum elegunt lucos neque ulla sacra sine ea fronde conficiunt  Plin Hist Nat  lib xv c    NEAR this is  CaerLēb  Mona

prodigy of learning the re∣verend HENRY ROWLANDS vicar of this parish His account of the druidical antiquities of this part of the island and his comments on them is a most extraordinary performance con∣sidering that he never enjoyed any other literary advantages than what he found in his native isle It is sayed that he never even travelled farther than  Conway  but I believe it is certain that Shrewshury was the farthest limits of his travels He died in aged and was interred under a slab of black  Anglesey  marble in the parish of  Llanedwen  He was descended from  Henry Rowlands  who died Bishop of  Bangor  in and who in purchased from  Robert Gryffydd  of  Penrhyn  the estate of  Plas Gwyn  in the forementioned parish which re∣mains to this day in his posterity The inscription on his

skirting the  Menai  for a confi∣derable way The wooded part of the island is on this side It commences at  Llanidan  and recalls the antient name of  Anglesey Ynys Dywyll  or the  Dark Island  on account of the deep shade of its groves but at present it is except in this part entirely divested of trees and the climate so averse to their growth that in most parts it is with great difficulty the gentry can raise a plantation round their houses  PLAS NEWYDD  PLAS NEWYDD  the seat of Sir  Nicholas Bayley  lies close upon the water protected on three sides by venerable oaks and ashes The view up and down this magnificent riverlike strait is extremely fine The shores are rocky those on the opposite side covered with woods and beyond soar a long range of  Snowdonian alps  Here stood a house built by Gwen∣llian a descendant of Cadrod Hardd  Plas Gwyn MSS  The mansion has been improved and altered to a castellated form by the present owner  IN the woods are some very remarkable druidical antiquities Behind the house are to be seen two vast  Cromlechs  CROMLECHS  The up∣per  stone of one is twelve feet seven inches long twelve broad and four thick supported by five tall stones The other is but barely separated from the first is almost a square of five feet and a half and supported by four stones The number of supporters to  Cromlechs  are merely accidental and depend on the size or form of the incumbent stone These are the most magnificent we have and the highest from the ground for a middlesized horse may easily pass under the largest  DR BORLASE has shewn the improbability of these stones ever being designed or used as altars The figure proves the impossibility of making fires or performing sacrifices on their sloping summits and almost all which I have seen have an inclination It is reasonable to suppose them to have been se∣pulchral monuments and that the body might be lodged in the space beneath and near the monument divine honors might be payed or sacrifices performed to the manes of the dead  See what the learned author offers in support of his opinion  Antiq Corn∣wal  p and the following    THIS species of monument is to be found in most

Probably all those which we see in our island might originally have been thus closed up but in time destroyed either through the sacrilegious hope of finding wealth deposited with the corpses or as is the case often at present for the sake of applying the stones to oecono∣mical uses Others again are quite bedded in the  Carnedd  or heap of stones of which instances may be produced in  Llan Faelog

 Esq  FROM  Plas Newydd  I continued my journey within sight of the water At  Craig y Ddinas  I was irresistably delayed by feasting my eyes with the fine view of the noble curvature of the  Menai  The annexed view is given with the utmost fidelity  THE SWELLY  Not far from hence I rode towards the shore to admire the furious current of the  Swelly  or  Pwll Keris  a part where by opposition of rocks and the narrowness of the channel are great overfalls and violent whirlpools during the time when the flood or ebb makes strong At lowwater the channel for a considerable space appears pointed with rocks black and horrible The fury of the tide amongst them at the times I mention is inconceivable unless by the naviga∣tor I when very young ventured myself in a small boat  VIEW on the MENAL

Caernarvon  and four from thence to its entrance at  Abermenai  A LITTLE lower down on a small rocky peninsula stands the church of  Llandyssilio  jutting far into the water a most dreary cure It is remarkable that most of the seventyfour parishes which this island is divided into have their churches not re∣mote from the shores  PORTHAETHWY  PORTHAETHWY  the most general ferry into  Anglesey  is

were exported He reckons only barley rye and oats but I have seen most incomparable wheat grow∣ing on the island The improvement in husbandry has greatly increased since the suppression of smuggling

founding the castles of  Caernarvon  and  Conway  he discovered that it was necessary to put another curb on my headstrong countrymen  CASTLE  He built this fortress in and fixed on a marshy spot near the chapel of St  Meugan  such as gave him opportunity of forming a great foss round the castle and of filling it with water from the sea He also cut a canal in order to permit vessels to discharge their lading beneath the walls  Sebright MSS  and as a proof of the existence of such  a conveniency there were within this century iron rings af∣fixed to them for the purpose of mooring the ships or boats The marsh was in early times of far greater extent than at present and covered with fine bullrushes  Sebright MSS  and  Plâ Gwyn MSS  There is even a strong tradition that one  Helig ap Clunog  had great possessions which extended even to  Dwygyfyechau  and fair house where now the sea flows all which were suddenly overwhelmed and it is pretended that there may still be seen at very low ebbs ruins of houses and a causeway from  Priestholm  pointing to∣wards  Penmaen Mawr  plâs Gwyn MSS    THE lands on which  Edward  built the castle were private property and it appears he made them full

chapel  CHAPEL  in form of a theatre the sides ornamented with Gothic arches and the roof supported by ribs springing from elegant pilasters be∣tween each of which is a narrow window and behind some are small closets gained out of the thickness of the wall probably allotted to the officers or persons of rank A narrow gallery runs within the whole space of the castle walls  THE entrance faces the sea and near it is a long narrow ad∣vanced work called the  Gunners Walk  THE first governor was Sir  William Pickmore  a  Gascon  knight appointed by  Edward  I  CONSTABLE OF THE CASTLE  There was a constable of the castle and a captain of the town The first had an annual fee of forty pounds the last of twelve pounds three shillings and four pence and the porter of the gate of  Beaumaris  had nine pounds two shillings and six pence Twentyfour soldiers were allowed for the guard of the castle and town at four pence a day to each  Dodridge      THE constable of the castle was always captain of the town except in one instance in the th of  Henry  VI Sir  John Boteler  held the first office and  Thomas Norreys  the other  THE castle was extremely burthensome to the country quarrels were frequent between the garrison and the country people In the time of  Henry  VI a bloody fray happened in which  David ap Evan ap Howel  of  Llwydiarth  and many others were slain  FROM the time of Sir  Rowland Villeville  alias  Brittayne  re∣puted base son of  Henry  VII and constable of the castle the  garrison was withdrawn till the year when  Thomas Cheadle  deputy to the Earl of  Dorset  then constable put into it men and ammunition In  Thomas Bulkeley  Esq  soon after created Lord  Bulkeley  succeeded his son Colonel  Richard Bulkeley  and several gentlemen of the country held it for the king till  June    TAKEN IN  when it surrendered on honorable terms to General  Mytton  who made Captain  Evans  his deputygo∣vernor In the annual expence of the garrison was se∣venteen hundred and

state of the boat which was then out of repair and in case it was feasible to cause it to be made fit for use at the expence of the baileywick but if the boat proved past repair a new one was to be

efforts of a dumb person to speak This affection ceases at the time of re∣migration which is most exactly about the eleventh of  August  They then go off to a single bird and leave behind the un∣fledged young of the later hatches a prey to the Peregrine Fal∣con which watches the mouth of the holes for their ap∣pearance compelled as they must soon be by hunger to come out  THE food of these birds is sprats  FOOD  or seaweeds which makes  PUFFIN AUK  them excessively rank yet the young are pickled and pre∣served by spices and by some people much admired  IT appears certain that the Puffins do not breed till their third year  THEIR BILLS CHANGE IN  The proof arises from the observations made by the reverend Mr  Davies  on the different forms of the bills among the thousands of this species which he saw wrecked as I have mentioned in page He remarked them in their several periods of life Those which he supposes to have been of the first year were small weak destitute of any furrow and of a dusky color those of the second year were considera∣bly larger and stronger lighter colored and with a faint vestige of the furrow at the base those of more advanced years were of the vivid colors and great strength Among the myriads which annually resort to  Priestholm  not an individual has ever been observed which had not its bill of an uniform growth Per∣haps the same remark may hold good in respect to the RAZORBILL  Br Zool  i N  o  Mr  Davies  having found multi∣tudes with bills far inferior in strength to those which haunt the island of an uniform black color and without the cha∣racteristic white furrow and black grooves  The channel between  Priestholm  and  Anglesey  has produced some very uncommon fish  FISH  The  Beaumaris  SHARK  Br Zool  iii N  o  the MORRIS N  o  and the trifurcated HAKE N  o  are new species taken in this sea I was indebted to the late Mr  William Morris  of  Holyhead  for that on which I bestowed his name The reverend Mr Hugh

the square tower and is frequently made into a poultice with oatmeal and used by the country people with success in the quincy  I RETURNED to  Beaumaris  and from thence visited  BaronHill  BARONHILL  The seat of Lord  Bulkeley  placed at the head of an extensive lawn sloping down to the town backed and winged by woods which are great embellishments to the country The founder of  BaronHill  was Sir  Richard Bulkeley  a most dis∣tinguished personage of the name  I will not here break in on my Tour with his history but as it may merit the reader's attention I refer him to the  Appendix  He built it in be∣fore that time the residence of the family was at  Court Mawr  in the subjacent town and afterwards in another house called  Old Place  The present seat has of late been wholly altered with excellent taste by its noble owner by the advice of that elegant architect Mr  Samuel Wyat  THE view is justly the boast of the island The sea forms a most magnificent bay with the  Menai  opening into it with the grandeur of an  American  river The limit of the water in front is a semicircular range of rocks and mountains the chief of  Snowdonia  with tops spiring to the clouds and their bottoms richly cultivated sloping gently to the water edge The great promontory  Penmaen Mawr  and the enormous mass of  Llan∣dudno  are rude but strinking features and strong contrasts to the softer parts of the scenery  I PROCEEDED on my journey  CROMLECH  and at  Trevawr  passed by a great and rude  Cromlech  with the ruins of others adjacent Reach  Plâs Gwyn  PLAS GWYN  the seat of my friend  Paul Panton  Esq  in right of his first wise  Jane  daughter of  William Jones  Esq  The house was built by Mr  Jones  and may be reckoned among the best of the island Here are preserved two portraits heads of two prelates natives of  Wales Humphrey Humphreys  who died bishop of  Hereford  in aged He was painted by Mrs  Mary Beale  when he was bishop of  Bangor  and is re∣presented in lawn sleeves with dark hair and a good counte∣nance The other prelate is  Robert Morgan  who died bishop of the same diocese in and is recorded to have been a considerable benefactor to his cathedral He is dressed like the former has short grey hair a close black cap and hard coun∣tenance  FROM  Plâs Gwyn  I made an excursion to  Traeth Coch  or  Redwharf  REDWHARF  a large bay covered with a firm sand which on the west side has so large a mixture of shells as to be used as a manure in all parts of the island within reasonable distance On the east side about three miles from  Plâs Gwyn  near the shore are two rounded mounts on each side of a deep gully leading towards  Llanddona  church These seemed to have been the work of the  Danes  cast up to protect their vessels in their plundering excursions a calamity to which it appears from the writing of our poets this island was much subject  ABOVE  Llanddona  is a high hill called  Bwrdd Arthur  BWRDD ARTHURY  or  Arthur  's round table the true name was probably  Din  or  Di∣nas Sulwy  for a church immediately beneath bears that of  Llanvihangle DinSulwy  On the top of it is a great  British  post surrounded by a double row of rude stones with their sharp points uppermost and in some parts the ramparts are formed of small stones In the area are vestiges of oval build∣ings the largest is formed with two rows of flat stones set an end These had been the temporary habitations of the possessors It had been a place of vast strength for besides the artificial defence the hill slopes steeply on all sides and the brink next to the ramparts are mostly precipitous It is worth while to ascend this hill for the sake of the vast prospect an inter∣mixture of sea rock and alps most savagely great  ABOVE it the reverend Mr  Hugh Davies  pointed out to me the  Hypericum Montanum  and beneath on the west side the  Cystus Hirsutus  I DESCENDED to the church of  Llanjestyn  LLANJESTYN  remarkable for the tomb of its tutelar saint St  Estyn  or  Jestyn  son of  Geriant  a worthy knight of  Arthur  's round table slain by the  Saxons  at the siege of  London  The figure of the saint represents a man with a hood on his head a great round beard and whiskers on upper and under lip He has on a long cloak fastened by a broche in one hand is a staff with the head of some beast on the top in the other is a scroll with an inscription round his long cassock is a sash and long cord This appears by the in∣scription to have been a votive offering I shall give it as copied by my worthy and ingenious friend the honorable DAINES BARRINGTON

his royal consort in after she had brought him three sons and one daughter  Edmund Jaspar  and  Owen  the last embraced a monastic life  Sandford's Geneal    in the abbey of  Westminster  and died soon after the daughter died in her infancy It appears that after the death of their  mother  Edmund  and  Jaspar  most respectfully were placed un∣der the care of  Catherine de la Pole  daughter of  Michael de la Pole  Earl of  Suffolk  and abbess of  Berking  A petition from her dated appears on record for the payment of certain money due to her on their account  Rymer  x  During the life of the queen the marriage had been winked at notwithstanding a law had been made after that event enacting that no person under severe penalties should marry a queen dowager of  Eng∣land  without the special

Newgate  The same  He made his escape a second time The length of his second imprisonment does not appear After a considerable period high honors were conferred on his two eldest sons half brothers to the king In the year they were both created earls  Edmund  was made Earl of  Richmond  and  Jaspar  Earl of  Pembroke Henry  about this time was disturbed by the open clame of the Duke of  York  to the suc∣cession and found it prudent to strengthen his interest by all possible means The  Welsh  flattered by the honors bestowed on their young countrymen ever after faithfully adhered to the house of  Lancaster  OWEN had besides a natural son called  Dafydd  knighted by his nephew  Henry  VII who also bestowed on him in marriage  Mary  the daughter and heiress of  John Bohun  of  Midherst  in  Sussex  and with her a great inheritance  Cambden  i  Dugdale Baron  i  Owen  was taken no notice of till the year when as the patent expresses it in regard of his good services he had a grant of the

soon after at  Hereford  and interred in the church of the  Grey Friers  in that city  Leland Itin  iv viii    NOTWITHSTANDING the birth of  Owen  was calumniated he certainly was of very high descent  Henry  VII early in his reign issued a commission to Sir  John Leiaf  priest  Gutten Owen  and a number of others to make enquiry into his pater∣nal descent and they from our  Welsh  chronicles proved  in∣contestably  that  he was lineally descended by issue male saving one woman from  Brutus  son of  Aeneas  the  Trojan  and that he was son to  Brute  in fivescore degrees  See the return of the commission c in  Wynn's Hist Wales  c    I shall drop a little short of this long descent  Owen Tudor  was as∣suredly of high blood He was seventh in descent from  Edny∣fed Vychan  counsellor and

must have been the instrument of his own advance∣ment and have owed it entirely to his personal merit His grandfather  Tudor ap Gronw  was a man of great valour a fa∣vorite of  Edward  III and received from him the honor of knighthood He died and was buried  September  th and was interred at the friery at  Bangor  His fourth son  Me∣redydd  was in no higher station than  Scutifer  to the bishop of  Bangor  Having committed a murder he fled his country and lived in exile during which time his wife was delivered of  Owen  the subject of these pages By what means he intro∣duced himself to the  English  court does not appear most pro∣bable by military services the usual road to honors in those days  THE remains of the residence of the  Tudors  are  HOUSE OF PEN∣HYNNYDD  the door of the gateway part of the house and the great chimneypiece of the hall are to be seen in the present farmhouse Some coats of arms and dates of the building or time of repairs are to be seen with the

couped a  cheveron  ermin  EDNYFED VY∣CHAN  Directly descended from him were  Henry  VII and VIII  Edward  VI Queen  Mary  and Queen  Elizabeth  and every crowned head in  England  ever since besides heroes not less illustrious in their degree Among them was Sir  Grayffydd Llwyd  SIR GRYFFYDD LIWYD  son of  Rhys ap Grayffyd ap Ednyfed Vychan  This gentleman received from  Edward  I the honor of knighthood on bringing him the news of the birth of his son  Edward  of  Caernarvon  He did homage for his lands in  Wales  to the young prince at  Chester  but indignant at the sufferings of his countrymen under the  English  yoke meditated a revolt Between the years and his attempted to form an alliance with  Edmund Bruce  the shortlived king of  Ireland  Letters passed between them but without effect  Wynn's Hist Wales    At length from the greatness of his sprit determined alone to endeavour to free his country from the slavery to which he himself had probably contributed he took arms in  Powel    and for a while overrun the country with resistless impetuosity At length was subdued taken and doubtlessly underwent the common fate of our gallant insurgents I find that he had fortified his house at  Tregarnedd  with a very strong foss and rampart and made another strong hold about three quarters of a mile distant in the morass of  Maltraeth  called  Ynys Ce∣venni  which he insulated by bringing round it the waters of the river  Cefni  Rowlands' MSS  both are still remaining The foss is nearly perfect and near four yards deep and eitht wide His daughter  Morvydd  one of his coheiresses  Sebright MSS  conveyed by marriage this estate being her protion to  Madog Gloddaeth  which followed the succession of that house till when it was alienated by the late Sir  Thomas Mostyn  to Mr  Owen Williams  THE name of this place is taken from an immense  Carnedd  GREAT CARNEDD  or heap of stones surrounded with great upright stones in an adjacent field It seems to have beneath it passages formed on the sides and tops with flat stones or flags These were the repositories of the dead  See  Borlase's Cornwal  p tab xvii fig i iii and his  Scilly Islands  tab ii at p  Not that bones or urns are also discovered in them for the founders like those of the pyramids of  Egypt  appear often to be disappointed in their hopes of having their reliques lodged in these labored  Mausoleums  A FEW years ago beneath a carnedd similar to that at  Tre∣garnedd  was discovered on a farm called  Bryncelliddu  near the feat of Sir  Nicholas Bayley  a passage three feet wide four feet two or three inches high and about nineteen feet and a half long which led into a room about three feet in diameter and seven in height The form was an irregular hexagon and the sides composed of six rude slabs one of which measured in its dia∣gonal eight feet nine inches In the middle was an artless pillar of stone four feet eight inches in circumference This sup∣ports the roof which consists of one great stone near ten feet in diameter Along the sides of the room was if I may be allowed the expression a stone bench on which were found human bones which fell to dust almost at a touch it is pro∣bable that the bodies were originally placed on the bench There are proofs that it was customary with the  Gauls  to place their dead in that form in cells but they added to the head of each body a stone weapon which served as a pillow  La Religion de Gaulois  ii plate  but nothing of the king was discovered in this sepulchre The diameter of the incumbent carnedd is from ninety to a hun∣dred feet This seems to be that which Mr  Rowland  takes notice of in his  Mona Antiqua  P tab vii    I MUST not omit mention of the great patriarch of  Tregaian  PATRIARCH OF TREGAIAN  a chapelry of this parish who lived in the year and died at the age of his name was  William ap Howel ap Jerwerth  He had by his first wife twentytwo children by his second ten by his third four and by his two concubines seven in all fortythree His eldest son was eithtyfour in and his eldest  daughter seventytwo and his youngest son then only two years and a half old so that between his first child and last there was an interval of eightytwo years Nor did there less than three hundred people descend from this stock in that in∣terval eighty of whom lived in this parish He was small of statute of a chearful convivial temper but spare in his diet living mostly on milk He passed his time in rural employ∣ments and at his leisure in fishing and fowling and preserved his memory and senses to the last  I RETURNED to  Plâs Gwyn  CASTELLMAWR  and from thence crossed  Red∣wharf  to the western horn of the bay called  Castellmawr  a small cape flat at top and joined to the land by a low isthmus It is composed of limestone which is carried to distant parts in small vessels which lie in a small channel near the rock and by their numbers frequently enliven the view  Roman  coins have been found in this neighborhood but there are no vestiges of there having been any station Beyond  CastellMawr  on the shore I saw vast blocks of black marble filled with shells corolloids and  fungitae  Proceed near the shore  LLUGWY  On the left are the woods of  Llugwy  extensive for this island This estate fomerly be∣longed to the  Llwyds  at present to Lord  Boston  See p  Not far from

country and is frequented by small vessels which take off the oats and butter of these parts Off the mouth is  Ynys Gadarn  a small island Go by  Llys Dulas  the seat of Mrs  Lewis  and soon after within sight of the church of  LlanElian  LLANELIAN  seated on the rocks not far from the sea It is handsomely built and makes a considerable figure among the churches of this part of  Wales  It is dedicated to St  Elian  surnamed  Gannaid  or the Bright He was formerly a most popular saint and had a great concourse of devotees who implored his assist∣ance to relieve them from variety of disorders To gain his favor they made considerable offerings which were deposited in the church in  Cyff Aelian  or St  Aelian  's chest These amounted to so large a sum that the parishioners purchased with it three tenements for the use of the church which belong to the living to this day  NEAR this place  Caswallon Lawhîr  or  Caswallon Longima∣nus  kept his  Llys  or court He had made a grant of lands and several privileges to this church among which was that of a  Nawddfa  or sanctuary This was one of the seven churchpatron saints in  Anglesey  which were entitled in  Capite  to several tenures one of the conditions of which seems to have been the preservation of these places of refuge  Rowlands' Mona Antiq  The other saints or patronchurches were  St Beuno St Kybi St Cadwaladr St Peirio St Machutus  or  Mechel  and  St Cyngar    FROM hence I visited  Trysclwyn  mountain on part of which  PARYS MOUN∣TAIN  called  Parys mountain  probably from a  Robert Parys  who was chamberlain of  North Wales  There was another of the same name in the reign of  Edward  III  in the reign of  Henry  IV is the most considerable body of copper ore perhaps ever known The external aspect of the hill is extremely rude and rises into enormous rocks of coarse white quartz The ore is lodged in a bason or hollow and has on one side a small lake on whose waters distasteful as those of  Avernus  no bird is known to alight The whole aspect of this tract has by the mi∣neral operations assumed a most savage appearance Suffocating fumes of the burning heaps of copper arise in all parts and extend their baneful influence for miles around In the adja∣cent parts vegetation is nearly destroyed even the mosses and lichens of the rocks have perished and nothing seems capable of resisting the fumes but the purple  Melic  grass  Melica Caerulea Lightfoot Fl Scot  i  Aira Caerulea Hudson Fl Angl  i  which flou∣rishes in abundance  I HAVE little doubt but that the ore had been worked in a very distant period Vestiges of the antient operations appear in several parts carried on by trenching and by heating the rocks intensely then suddenly pouring on water so as to cause them to crack or scale thus aukwardly supplying the use of gunpowder  See  Tour in Wales  i  Pieces of charcoal were also found which prove that wood was made use of for that purpose As the  Britons  im∣proted all works in brass it is certain that the  Romans  were the undertakers of these mines and it is very probable that they sent the ore to  Caerbén  to be smelted the place where the famous  cake of copper was discovered  Tour in Wales  p tab ix  They might likewise have had a smeltinghearth in this island for a round cake of copper was discovered at  Llanvaethlle  a few miles from this place Its weight was fifty pounds and it had on it a mark resembling an  L  IN the year one  Alexander Frazier  came into  Anglesey  in search of mines He visited  Parys mountain  called on Sir  Nicholas Bayley  and gave him so flattering an account of the prospect as induced him to make a trial and sink shafts Ore was discovered but before any quantity could be gotten the mines were overpowered with water In about two years after Messrs  Roe  and Co of  Macclesfield  applied to Sir  Nicholas  for a lease of  Penrhyn ddu  mine in  Caernarvonshire  with which they were much against their wills compelled to take a lease of part of this mountain and to carry on a level and make a fair trial The trial was accordingly made ore was discovered but the expences overbalanced the profits They continued working to great loss and at length determined to give the affair up They gave their agent orders for that purpose but he as a final attempt divided his men into ten several com∣panies of three or four in a partnership and let them sink shafts in various places about eight hundred yeards eastward of a place called the  Golden Venture  on a presumption that a spring which issued from near the place must come from a body of mineral His conjecture was right for in less than two days they met with at the depth of seven feet from the surface the solid mineral which proved to be that vast body which has since been worked to such advantage The day that this discovery was made was  March  d which has  ever since been observed as a festival by the miners Soon after this discovery another adventure was begun by the reverend Mr  Edward Hughes  owner of part of the mountain in right of his wife  Mary Lewis  of  Llys Dulas  so that the whole of the treasure is the property of Sir  Nicholas Bayley  and himself  THE body of copper ore is of unknown extent  THE ORE  The thick∣ness has been ascertained in some places by the driving of a level under it several years ago and it was found to be in some places twentyfour yards The ore is mostly of the kind called by  Cronsted Pyrites cupri flavo viridescens  and contains vast quantities of sulphur It varies in degrees of goodness some of it is rich but the greater part poor in quality  THERE are other species of copper ore found here Of late a vein of the  Pyrites cupri griseus  of  Cronsted  about seven yards wide has been discovered near the west end of the mountain some is of an iron grey some quite black the first contains six∣teen lb of copper per clb the last forty An ore has been lately found in form of loose earth of dark purplish color and the best of it has produced better thatn eight in twenty Some years ago above thirty pounds of native copper was found in driving a level through a turbery some was in form of moss some in very thin leaves  IT is quarried out of the bed in vast masses is broken into small pieces and the most pure part is sold raw at the rate of about  l  to  l  per ton or sent to the smeltinghouses of the respective companies to be melted into metal Mr  Hughes  has great furnaces of his own at  Ravenhead  near  Leverpool  and at  Swansey  in  South Wales  An idea of the wealth of these mines may be formed by considering that the  Macclesfield  com∣pany  have had at once fourteen thousand tons of ore upon bank and Mr  Hughes  's thirty thousand  THE more impure ore is also broken to the size of about hen's eggs but in order to clear it from the quantity of sul∣phur with which it abounds as well as other advantitious mat∣ter it must undergo the operation of burning For that pur∣pose it is placed between two parallel walls of vast length some kilns are twenty others forty and fifty yards in length some ten others twenty feet wide and above four feet in height The space between is not only filled but the ore is piled many feet higher in a convex form from end to end the whole is then covered with flat stones closely luted with clay and above is placed a general integument of clay and small rubbish of the work in order to prevent any of the fumes from evaporating Of late some kilns have been constructed with brick arches over the ore which is found to be the best method of burning Within these few years attempts are made to pre∣serve the sulphur from flying away and that is done by flues made of brick whose tops are in form of a Gothic arch many scores of feet in length one end of these opens into the beds of copper which are to be burnt Those beds are set on fire by a very small quantity of coal for all the rest is effected by its own  phlogiston  The volatile part is confined and diredted to the flues in its course the sulphurous particles strike against their roofs and fall to the bottom in form of the finest brimstone  BRIMSTONE  which is collected and carried to adjacent houses where it is melted into what is called in the shops stone brimstone  THE beds of copper thus piled for burning are of vast ex∣tent Some contain four hundred tons of ore others two  thousand The first require four months to be completely burnt the last near ten Thus burnt it is carried to proper places to be dressed or washed and made merchantable By this process the ore is reduced to a fourth part in quantity but considerably improved in quality and by this means the water is strongly or richly impregnated with copper which is dissolved by the acid quality of the sulphur and is collected or precipitated again by iron in the abovedescribed pits The iron is all dissolved  BUT a far richer produce of copper is discovered from the water lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore  PRECIPITATED COPPER  which is highly saturated with the precious metal This is drawn up either by means of whimsies or windmills to the surface and then distributed into numbers of rectangular pits thirtysix feet long some pits more some less twelve to fifteen feet broad and twenty inches deep To speak in the language of the adept  Venus  must make an assignation with  Mars  or this solution will have no effect In plain  English  a quantity of iron must be immersed in the water The kind of iron is of no moment old pots hoops anchors or any refuse will suffice but of late for the convenience of management the adventurers procure new plates four feet long one and a half broad and three quarters of an inch thick These they immerse into the pits the particles of copper instantly are precipitated by the iron and the iron is gradually dissolved into a yellow ocher great part of it floats off by the water and sinks to the bottom The plates or the old iron as it happens are frequently taken out and the copper scraped off and this is repeated till the whole of the iron is consumed The copper thus procured differs  little from native copper and is prized accordingly and sold for prices of  l  to  l  a ton  THIS discovery is far from new it has been practised long in the  Wicklow  mines in  Ireland  and above a century in those of  Herngrundt  in  Hungary  where it is called  Ziment Copper  Brown's travels    Keysler's travels  iv  The waters of the  Hungarian  mines are much more strongly impregnated with copper than those of  Parys mountain  The first effects its operation in twelve or about twenty days the last requires two months Horseshoes iron made in shape of hearts and other forms are put into the foreign waters and when per∣fectly transmuted are given as presents to curious strangers  THE ore is not got in the common manner of mining but is cut out of the bed in the same manner as stone is out of a quarry A hollow is now formed in the solid ore open to the day and extends about and hundred yards in length about forty yards in breadth and twentyfour yards in depth The ends are at present undermined but supported by vast pillars and mignificent arches all metallic and these caverns meander far under ground These will soon disappear and thousands of tons of ore be gotten from both the columns and roofs The sides of this vast hollow are mostly perpendicular and access to the bottom is only to be had by small steps cut in the ore and the curious visitor must trust to them and a rope till he reaches some ladders which will conduct him the rest of the descent On the edges of the chasms are wooden platforms which project far on them are windlasses by which the work∣men are lowered to transact their business on the face of the precipice There suspended they work in mid air pick a  small space for a footing cut out the ore in vast masses and tumble it to the bottom with great noise In such situations they form caverns and there appear safely lodged till the rope is lowered to convey them up again Much of the ore is blasted with gunpowder eight tons of which I am informed is an∣nually used for the purpose  NATURE hath been profuse in bestowing her mineral favors on this spot for above the copper ore and not more than three quarters of a yard beneath the common soil is a bed of yellow∣ish greasy clay from one to four yards thick containing lead ore and yielding from six hundred to a thousand pounds weight of lead from one ton and one ton of the metal yields not less than fiftyseven ounces of silver Mixed with the earth are fre∣quently certain parts of the color of cinnabar whether these are symptomatic of the sulphurous arsenical silver ores or of quicksilver I will not pretend to decide Something inter∣feres with the successful smelting of this earth in the great insomuch that it has not yet been of that profit to the adven∣turers which might reasonably be expected from the crucible assays of it and they have at this time about eight thousand tons on bank undisposed of This place has been worked for lead ore in very distant times In the bottom of the pool was found an antient smelting hearth of gritstone and several bits of smelted lead of about four inches in length two breadth and half an inch thick  THESE works have added greatly to the population of the island for

this place some parts of  Italy  and to  Corsica  MARBLE QUARRY  and known in the shops by the name of  Verde di Corsica  Its colors are green black white and dull purple irregularly disposed In different blocks one or other of the colors are frequently wanting but among the green parts are often found narrow veins of a most elegant and silky white  asbestos  It is a compound species of marble part is calca∣reous and may be acted on by aqua fortis The green parts partake of the nature of jasper It is apt to be intersected by small cracks or by asbestine veins therefore incapable of taking a high polish This quarry lies on the lands of  Mo∣nachty  in the parish of  LlanFairYnghornwy  and it is found again in the isle of  Skerries  off this parish  NEITHER the quarry not the asbestos are at present in use The antients set a high value on the last a price equal to that of pearls They wove napkins of it and at great feasts  diverted themselves in order to clean them to fling them into the fire from which they returned unhurt and with im∣proved lustre They likewise made of it shrouds for the bodies of great men before they were placed on the funeral pile and by that means preserved their ashes pure from those of the wood The antients believed that it was found only in  India  in places where showers never fell and the residence of dire serpents  Plinii Nat Hist

Hist Anglesey    This prince was styled  Draco Insularis  perhaps the dragon engraven on the church may allude to him Others assert that the founder of this college was  Hwfa ap Cynddelw  lord of  Llys Llivon  in this island and one of the fifteen tribes of  North Wales  and contemporary with  Owen Gwy∣nedd  The same  The head of the college was called  Penclas  or  Pen∣colas  and was one of

about the year  Powel Pres    Sirigi  was canonized by his countrymen and had in this chapel a shrine in high repute for many miracles This place had distinct revenues from the collegiate church At length it fell to ruin and was disused for ages In removing the rubbish not many years ago a stone coffin was found with bones of a stupendous size but we must not suppose these to have been the reliques of  Sirigi  which had been carried away by some Irish rovers and deposited in the cathedral of  Christ Church  in  Dublin  Hist Anglesey      THE precinct of the churchyard clames a far higher anti∣quity than the church  ROMAN FORT  It is a square of two hundred and twenty feet by a hundred and thirty Three sides are strong walls seventeen feet high and six feet thick the fourth side is open to the precipitous rocks of the harbour and never had been walled being intended for ships to retire to and receive the benefit of protection from this inclosure At each corner of the wall is an oval tower The masonry of the whole is evidently  Roman  the mortar very hard and mixed with much coarse peb∣ble Along the walls are two rows of round holes about four inches in diameter which penetrate them They are in all respects like those at  Segontium  p and nicely plaistered within  THE use of this harbour to the  Romans  in the passage from various places to the ports of  Lancashire  and that of  Chester  is very evident They could not find a better place to run into in case of hard weather than this as it projected farthest into the  Vergivian  sea so that they could make it with less danger of being embayed than in any other place If as is very probable they had commerce with  Ireland  no place was better adapted The  Romans  it is true never made a settle∣ment in that country but they certainly traded with it even in the time of  Agricola  when its ports and harbours were better known from the concourse of merchants for the pur∣poses of commerce  Tacitus Vitae

entrance On the  Pen y Gaer Gybi  or the sum∣mit of the mountain are foundations of a circular building strongly cemented with the same sort of mortar as the sort in the town It seems to have been a  Pharos  A PHAROS  a necessary director in these seas  FROM the top of this mountain I had a distinct view of the isle of  Holyhead  it being at that time highwater and the channel filled on each side

mile eastward of the town on the ridge of hills which bound the southeast side of the vale and nearly the same distance from the port The castle stood on a rocky and in many parts a precipitous hill Three sides of the walls are easily to be traced on the southeast side they extended a hundred and twenty yards on the southwest sixtysix ending at a precipice the northeast may be traced forty yards and ends in the same manner On the fourth side the natural strength of the place rendered a farther defence useless Mounds of earth tending to a semicircular form with rocks and precipices connect the northeast and southwest walls  We know not the time of its demolition probably as soon as the earl had effected his design it was suffered to fall to ruin  ON leaving  Bangor  I took the road towards

William  or Sir  Richard Dalton  IN the reign of Queen  Elizabeth Piers Gryffydd  He married  Margaret  daughter of Sir  Thomas Mostyn  of  Mostyn  knight and had by her three sons all of whom died young It is said that he built or repaired his ships in  Aber Cegid  where there was till of late years on the gable end of a house his initials P G and the date    PIERS GRYF∣FYDD  lord of the place

Sir  Francis Drake  He shared with the other men of rank and gallantry in the honor of defeating the  Spanish armada  After that distinguished victory he joined with Sir  Francis Drake  and Sir  Walter Raleigh  in their different expeditions against the  Spaniards  in the  WestIndies  but in the reign of  James  I continuing his depredations against the  Spaniards  after peace was proclamed he was called to account and so harrassed by persecutions that he was ob∣liged to mortgage his estate to defray the expences part to some citizens of  London  and part to  Jevan Llwyd  Esq  of  Yale

great satisfaction to find that the place will soon be restored to its former lustre under the auspices of the present worthy owners and on the plan of that able architect Mr  S Wynt  THE only furniture left to this house which savored of anti∣quity was the drinkinghorn of its hero  Piers Gryffydd  DRINKINGHORN  out of which I have made libations in the hospitable reign of the agent Mr  Richard Hughes  It was a large bugle or horn of an ox enriched with sculptured silver and with a chain of the same metal At one end are the initials of his own name P G and those of his father and mother R G K or  Rhys  and  Ca∣therine Gryffydd  Such horns were in use with  Danes Saxons Scots  and  Welsh  We had in old times three species in our royal court which by usage were to be made of those of the  ox The first was  Y Corn ydd Yfo y  BRENIN or that allotted for the sole use of the king the second was  Corn Cyweithas  or the horn with which the domestics of the palace was to be called and the third was  y Corny y Pencynydd  or the horn of the chief huntsman Each of them was to be worth a pound  Leges Walliea    To drink out of the royal cup at great entertainments was a privilege of the officers of the palace Thus the governor was to receive a cup of metheglin by the hand of the high steward The same officer was also dispenser of horns of drink to several others among them to the royal porter who at certain seasons had besides his horn from the king and queen another from the master of the horse which was styled  Gwi∣rawd i'r Ebysdyl  or the  Waissail  cup of the  apostle  The same  whom they probably invoked at the time of drinking This custom was in frequent use in old times The  Danes  invoked the highest powers to assist the mighty draught  Help  GOT  unde  MARIA  Journey to London    And the  Saxon Ulphus  when he conveyed certain lands to the church of  York  quaffed off the horn DEO  et St Petro  Archaelogia  iii S  On less serious occasions on festive days the horn was emptied at one tip and then blown to shew that there was no deceit The jovial horn was a subject of poetry Thus  Owen Cyveiliog  the princely Bard  He was prince of  Powis  and flourished about the year See the reverend Mr  Evan Evans's Collections  p  celebrates the  Hirlas  or drirnkinghorn used at feasts in his palace He writes in a more exalted strain as the poem was

Ogwen  and commands a beautiful view It is a small but neat structure in form of a cross with the tower in the center supported within by four arches Here is pre∣served an alabaster monument of an armed man and his lady recumbent They probably belonged to the neighboring house but on the dissolution were removed from the friery of  Llanvaes  where the persons represented had been interred A mural monument with the figure of archbisshop  John Wil∣liams  in his episcopal dress  ARCHBISHOP WILLIAMS  kneeling at an altar is placed above the remains of that great prelate He was born at  Conwy  His father  Edmund  was sixth son of the neighboring family of  Cwchwillan  a branch of that of  Penrhyn  His mother  Mary  daughter of  Owen ap John Owen  Pedigree of the family MS  The archbishop was fifth son In his childish years with other playfellows he was di∣verting himself with leaping from part of the walls of  Conwy  down to the shore The fall was on so critical a part as ever to secure him from all reproaches of unchastity I mention this merely to rescue him from the reflections flung on him by that satyrical historian Sir  Anthony Weldon  Memoirs  At school which was that of  Ruthin  he was a compound of alternate truantry and industry His great abilities were soon taken notice of He entered on public life as chaplain to lord chancellor  Eger∣ton  and preaching before the king so pleased the royal ear that in  James  made him dean of  Salisbury  and on far∣ther discovery of his great abilities in dean of  West∣minster  and in lord keeper in the room of the illustri∣ous Lord  Bacon  and in less than a month nominated him to the see of  Lincoln  Now placed above restraint his character be∣gan to unfold His spirit grew beyond the controul of mini∣sters for with undaunted courage he persisted in all that was right and being subject to the failings of his country great passion pride and vanity sometimes in what was wrong He discharged his office foreign as it was to his profession with distinguished credit near five years Soon after the ac∣cession of  Charles  I by the influence of the favorite  Buckingham  he was suddenly dismissed for he always had resisted the un∣reasonable demands of that minion  IN two parts of his conduct I must consider him as a wife but not as a good manHis advice to his distressed master in the case of the earl of  Strafford  had too great a share of du∣plicity to be vindicated perhaps of resentment for he hated the devoted minister The spirit of  Machiavel  arose strong in him when he spoke of a public and private conscience and still more strongly when he advised  Charles  in case the king could not gain  Cromwel  by promises of fair treatment to catch him by some stratagem and cut him short He may appear in these instances a great minister but a bad divine The infirmity the inequalities which may be met in men even of firstrate abilities may be exemplified in his attempt to defend himself from a frivolous accusation for he fell into the dis∣graceful crime of subornation of perjury was censured in the starchamber and suffered imprisonment from to On his release irritated against the court he for a time joined the popular leaders Let me attribute this and candor may admit the cause to the natural violence of his temper for on all trying occasions he shewed his zeal for the liberty of the subject and his sincerity to his order Soon after this he was according to an old promise promoted to the see of  York  He was a firm friend to the  petition of right  Drake's Parliam Hist  viii  foreseeing that he served both king and people in the support of it As a friend to the church he was so successful an advocate and shewed such eloquence and strength of reasoning in the debate in  May  on taking away the votes of bishops in the house of lords  The same ix  as to cause the affair to be dropped for that sessions  In the latter end of the year when popular fury ran high he was attacked in  Westminster  abbey and with great courage re∣pelled the violence of the mob This gave rise to the first satyrical political print I know The prelate is represented in his episcopal dress a musket on his shoulder rest in his hand helmet on his head and mitre on the ground The rage of the common people increased even so far as to seize him in his way to the house of lords and to tear his robes from his back Incensed at this he returned to  Westminster  abbey the deanery of which he had been allowed to hold three years in  commendam  and in a fit of passion induced eleven bishops to join him in a phrenetic protest against all acts that should be done in the house of lords during their forced absence  Clarendon  ii  This brought an impeachment of hightreason against them imprisonment of eighteen months and in the end a release upon bail in which the archbishop in particular was bound not to go into his diocese during the disturbances in the county of  York  Drake's Parliam Hist  x  He instantly disobeyed the injunction followed the king into the city of  York  was enthroned there on  June  th but immediately driven away by the  Hothams  He then retired to his native country where he finished his days on his birthday  March  th aged He died at  Gloddaeth  the seat of Sir  Roger Mostyn  an eminent loyalist whose lady warned him of the approach of death the stroke of which he received with exemplary piety courage and resignation  Philips's Life of archbishop Williams  His chaplain  Hackett  afterwards bishop of  Lichfield  composed his epitaph His memory is more pleasingly pre∣served in an elegant little poem on the fight of his monument preserved in vol vi of  Dodsley  's  Miscellanies    FROM  Llandegai  I descended and crossed the wooden bridge over the furious torrent  Ogwen  which a little lower discharges itself into the sea at  Aberogwell  and near which is the ruin of the old chapel  Capel Ogwen  and certain entrenchments defences of this part of the country I soon quitted the great road to visit  Carnedd Llewelyn  and  Carnedd Dafydd  In my way near a field called  Car Gwilim Ddu  is an artificial cave in which tradition says was interred  William de Breos  exe∣cuted by  Llewelyn  the Great on suspicion of too great fami∣liarity with his royal consort From hence I begin a steep ascent and leave on the left the vast mountain  Moelwynnion  and the strange ferrated rocks  Bere Mawr  and  Bere Bach  The  Gern  appeared on our right and  Trwsgwl  in front On the right farther on projected into the bottom the lofty peaked  Moel yr Elain  or the naked hill  of the Fawn  seeming like a buttress to  Carnedd Llewelyn  and between it and  Carnedd Da∣fydd  lies the little vale of  Cwm Penllafar  fertile in grass We proceeded on the sloping sides of the  Trwsgwl  and near  Car∣nedd y Filiast  and  Carnedd y Lladron  and passing over  Clogwyn y Heliwr  or the  rock of the Hunters  and ascending the steep and stoney side of  Carnedd Llewelyn  reach the broad and flat summit and quickly decide its height to be far inferior to that of its rival  Y Wyddfa  The view is amazingly great At some distance are  Y Wyddfa  and its neighboring  alps  The  Glyders Trevaen  Tour in Wales  vol ii  and  Carnedd y Filiast  or  rock of the Bitch Grehound  appear immedi∣ately beneath The front of the last is an even slope of rock smooth and uniform and so slippery that if the fox in extreme danger takes over it in wet weather it falls down and perishes  NANT FRANKON is a tremendous glen  NANT FRANKON  or rather chasm bounded by these and other lofty rocks In the bottom is a narrow tract of meadowing watered by the  Ogwen  which at the end tumbles out of  Llyn Ogwen  down the rude front of the  Benglog  In one part it is called  Sarn yr Afange  or the  Beavers Dam  another proof  Taur is Wales  vol ii  of the former existence of those animals in our country Over part of this vale impends  Yr Oleu Wen  with its front torn into amazing gullies through which torrents of stones were some time before carried into the  Nant  by the single collision of a cloud which burst against it discharging an ocean of water The ruins of the hill looked like a stream of  lava  which providentially divided above a house and by that means gave safety to the inhabitants Among the ruins were stones filled with innumerable small brassy cubic  pyritae  I must not omit that the passage through this dreary bottom was once defended by a fort about a mile from the  Benglog  called  Ty'n y Twr  close to a bridge called  Pont y Twr  but at present there is not a vestige to be seen  THE  Menai Anglesey  and the river  Conway  afforded a distinct and fine prospect The high hills east of  Nant Conway  ap∣peared a mere undulated tract a proof of our lofty situation Our near view was very disagreeable of dreary bottoms or moory hills and of no waters of any consequence except  Llyn Llyphaint  LLYN LLYPHAINT  or the lake of the Frogs distinguished only by a ri∣diculous tale About the year says Dr  Powel  two vast stones one of which a thousand yoke of oxen could not have moved in a certain night marched out of the bottom of the lake up part of the foot of  Carnedd Llewelyn  the space of at  lest a bowshot from whence they have not stirred to this day  Henry  VIII doubting the truth sent a person to enquire into it but was fully satisfied of the fact by the mouth of his messenger  Powel's Notes on Girald Cambr Iter Cambriae lib ii c    CARNEDD DAFYDD  CARNEDD DAFYDD  the companion summit is connected to  Carnedd Llewelyn  by a semilunar isthmus which on the side over  Cwm Penllafar  is called  Ysgollion Duon  or the  black lad∣ders  and forms the most horrid precipice that thought can conceive The height of  Carnedd Dafydd  equals that of  Lle∣welyn  We descended through  Cwm Penllafar  which signifies the Vale of Melody perhaps that of the hounds when in full cry over the  rock of the Hunters  A few peasants who have sufficient strength of head sometimes attempt to pass the tre∣mendous isthmus as the shortest way to  Dyffryn Mymbr  and  Llanrwst  A safer way through variety of bog and stoney tracts may be found up the  Benglog  and along  Nant y Benglog  and  Bwlch Oleuni  over which is a narrow path into  Dyffryn Mumbr  IN my return from this sublime ride I called at  Coytmor  COYTWOR  or more properly  Coed Mawr  seated in the midst of lofty trees every now and then opening so as to admit sight of the exalted mountains and rocks soaring above with misty tops This had long been the residence of a family of the same name and of later years by the marriage of the heiress the property of the  Pughs of Penrhyn  in  Creuddyn  In the house is a remarkable picture by Sir  Peter Lely  of the diminutive painter  Richard Gib∣son  PICTURE OF GIBSON THE PAINTER  and his fairy wife hand in hand neither of them exceeded three feet ten inches in height He was distinguished for his skill in watercolors and was excellent in his copies of the portraits of Sir  Peter Lely  He had the honor of being draw∣ingmaster  to the princess of  Orange  and her sister Queen  Anne  He died in aged His little widow survived him till when she quitted life at the great age of  Mr Walpole's Anecdotes of Painting  iii  They had the honor of being married in the presence of  Charles  I and his queen and the still greater honor of having their  epithalamium  composed by Mr  Waller  It is so beautiful that I doubt not but the reader will excuse me for giving it at full length  Of the  MARRIAGE  of

towards  Aber  ABER  a small village with a church in the gift of Lord  Bulkeley  seated at the mouth of a deep glen which runs straight a mile and a half between the mountains and bounded on one side by a magni∣ficent rock called  Maes y Gaer  One part is hid with trees on the other they only sprinkle its grey surface At the ex∣tremity of this glen a mountain presents a concave front in the center of which a vast cataract precipitates down a double fall  CASCADE  The lowest is of a very great height and forms partly a broad white sheet partly a snowy dew not unlike the  Staub∣hauch  or  dusty  cascade in  Switzerland  AT the entrance of the glen close to the village is a very large artificial mount flat at top and near sixty feet in diame∣ter widening towards the base It was once the site of a castle belonging to  Llewelyn  the Great Some foundations are yet to be seen round the summit and in digging traces of buildings have been discovered In this place was detected the intrigue of  William de Breos  son of  Reginald  a potent baron in the reign of  Henry  III with the wife of  Llewelyn  It seems that  William  by chance of war had before fallen into the hands of our prince at which time probably the familiarity with the princess commenced but was not discovered till after he was released on a large ransom  Dugdale Baron  i  The vindictive  Llewelyn  in the following year inveigled  Breos  into his power by an invitation to celebrate the feast of  Easter  when after an elegant banquet the prince reproached him with his crime  and caused him to be dragged from his presence  Knyghton  in  Hist Angl Script  ii  Cambden  in  Brecknockshire  ii  and hung on an adjacent hill The tradition of the country is that a Bard of the palace accidentally meeting with the princess who was ignorant of the fate of her lover accosted her in the fol∣lowing manner and on receiving her answer shewed him to her hanging on a tree  Diccyn doccyn gwraig  Lhewelyn  Beth y roit'i

England  and  Llewelyn  to boot I would give them all to see my  William  I CONTINUED my journey from  Aber  along the rich recess en∣joying a fine view of the entrance into the  Menai  with its wooded shores of  Anglesey  and  Priestholm  isle and the great expanse of water between them and  Llandudno  or  Ormshead  the vast cape rising like the rock of  Gibraltar  high out of the waves Before me soared the great promontory of PENMAEN MAWR protruding itself into the sea and exhibiting a fine contrast to the fertility which it interrupts by a rude view of grey weatherbeaten stone and precipice I passed by  Bryn y Neuodd  a house late the property of  Humphrey Roberts  Esq  now of his daughter and sole heiress relict of  Robert Wynne  Esq  of  Plâsnewydd  near  Denbigh  A little farther is the small vil∣lage and church of  Llanvair Vechan  from whence is a very short ride to the once tremendous road over this celebrated rock  IN past times it was justly the terror of the traveller  PENMAEN MAWR  ex∣tremely narrow bad and stoney and what added to his fears for a considerable way the danger encreased with his progress by reason of the precipice gaining additional height Generally it was without the protection of a wall to secure him in case of a false step which might in the loftiest place precipitate him some scores of yards either on sharp rocks or into the sea according to the state of the tide A vein of a crumbling stratum in one part so contracted the road as to excite new hor∣rors The  British  parlement eased the fears of the travellers by a generous aid which by means of the judicious employ∣ment of JOHN SYLVESTER about the year effected what was before thought beyond the reach of art to remedy The road is now widened to a proper breadth and near the verge of the precipice secured by a strong wall The descent towards  Penmaen Bach  or the  Little Penmaen  which before was hardly practicable is now destroyed and the road is brought on a level for two or three miles at a vast height above a return of rich slopes and the deep bottom of  Dwygyfylchig  till we arrive at the rude back of that lesser promontory when we labor up the steep ascent of  Sychnant  with a horrible and almost precipitous mountain on one side and hills with tops broken into most singular crags on the other From the top of  Sych∣nant  the road is continued about two miles on a perpetual descent to the town of  Conway  THE breach occasioned by the crumbling stratum is now effectually repaired by a series of arches a work the just ad∣miration of travellers and a high credit to the ingenious con∣triver One danger yet remains which must for ever baffle the art of man the side of this great rock above the road breaks into millions of vast masses depending often on preca∣rious tenures which loosened by the frequent torrents some∣times though rarely descend in stoney streams  Two or three accidents  ACCIDENTS THERE  which have happened on this road will remain as miracles An exciseman fell from the highest part and escaped unhurt The reverend Mr  Jones  who in was rector of  Llanelian  in the isle of  Anglesey  fell with his horse and a midwife behind him down the steepest part The  sage femme  perished as did the nag The divine with great philosophy unsaddled the steed and marched off with the trappings exulting at his preservation  I HAVE often heard of another accident attended with such romantic circumstances that I would not venture to mention it had I not the strongest traditional authority to this day in the mouth of every one in the parish of  Llanvair Vechan  in which this promontory stands Above a century ago  Siôn Humphries  of this parish had made his addresses to  Anne Thomas  of  Creyd∣dyn  on the other side of  Conway  river They had made an appointment to meet at a fair in the town of  Conway  He in his way fell over  Penmaen Mawr  she was overset in the ferryboat and was the only person saved out of more than fourscore They were married and lived very long together in the parish of  Llanvair  She was buried  April  th aged He survived her five years and was buried  December  th  was buried close by her in the parish churchyard where their graves are familiarly shewn to this day  I HAVE more than once visited the summit of this noted rock to view the fortifications described by the editor of  Cambden  from some notes of that sensible old baronet Sir  John Wynn  of  Gwedir  and have found his account very just  Cambden  ii seq Before Sir  John Wynn  a Sir  Thomas ap Wil∣liam  medicus M A had described it but his account never appeared in print He was eighth son of one of the family of  Cochwillan  Lived in the year and is said to have resided at  Trefriw  The ascent is laborious Soon after leaving the inn I met with the ruins of St  Seiriol  's chapel or as it is here called his  Gweli  or bed and after passing a considerable way amidst small trees and brushwood attain the bare and stoney part or the  Braich y Ddinas  i e the arm of the city which rises in form of another hill out of this promontory A Mr  Caswel  ITS HEIGHT  at the request of Mr  Flamsteed  the great astronomer measured the height and found it to be from the sands feet  AFTER climbing for some space among the loose stones the front of three if not four  AN ANTIENT FORTRESS  walls presented themselves very dis∣tinctly one above the other In most places the facings ap∣peared very perfect but all of dry work I measured the height of one wall which was at the time nine feet the thickness seven feet and a half Between these walls in all parts were innumerable small buildings mostly circular and regularly faced within and without but not disposed in any certain order These had been much higher as is evident from the fall of stones which lie scattered at their bottoms and  probably had once the form of towers as Sir  John  asserts Their diameter in general is from twelve to eighteen feet but some were far less not exceeding five feet The walls were in certain places intersected with others equally strong On the northwest and southeast sides are the plain marks of two roads of a zigzag form with the remains of walls on both sides which lead to the summit On the small area of the top had been a group of towers or cells like the former one in the center and five others surrounding it Three are still distinct of the two others are only faint vestiges Near this had been I believe a similar group but at present reduced to a shape∣less heap of stones Near one of these groups is a well cut in the live rock and always filled with water supplied by the rains and kept full by the frequent impending vapours  THIS strong hold of the  Britons  is exactly of the same kind with those on  Carn Madryn Carn Boduan  and  Tre'r Caeri  de∣scribed pp This was most judiciously founded to cover the passage into  Anglesey  and the remoter part of their country and must from its vast strength have been invincible except by famine being inaccessible by natural steepness to∣wards the sea and on the other parts fortified in the manner described  See a plan of the top and one side of this strong hold in the  Archaelogia  iii plate xxix p    THE white beam or  Aria Theophrasti  ARIA THEO∣PHRASTI  is frequent on the sides of this rock and in many similar places in  Wales  No use is made of it in our country The  Swiss  procure from the berries a good spirit The wood is very hard and excellent for  flutes and the wood from its great solidity was esteemed to make the best charcoal  I DESCENDED from the summit into a hollow between the  Penmaen  and an adjacent mountain Got upon my horse and directed my course on a good sheepwalk towards  Conway  In my way observed above  Gwdhw Glâs  in the parish of  Dwygy∣vylcheu  a long series of antiquities some of which are men∣tioned in the account of  Penmaen Mawr  preserved in  Cambden  For a very considerable length of way I saw circles of stones of various diameters and great  Carneddau  CIRCLES AND CARNEDDAU  The principal circle consists at present of ten upright stones at unequal dis∣tances from each other the largest of which is eight feet three inches high on the ground is another eleven feet two The circle is completed by a low bank of loose stones placed be∣tween the greater The diameter of this circle is eighty feet Near this are four other circles far inferior in size In the cen∣ter of one is a flat stone the remains of a Cromlech pro∣bably the rest might have had those memorials before they were removed for the purpose of walling or the like About a quarter of a mile from these is a large  Carnedd  composed of small stones and near it another of large stones and not far from these a circle composed of small ones  An assemblage of antiquities of this nature may be seen in plate ii book iii of Mr THOMAS WRIGHT'S  Louthirna  That book is a small specimen of his great abilities The vast treasure he possesses of drawings of  Irish  antiquities in the highest degree merit publication and clame the assistance of some dis∣tinguished patron to enable a person of his merit to enrich the literary world with more of his labors  Near the last is a great rude stone standing upright called  Maen y Campiau  MAEN Y CAMPIAU  or  Stone of the Games  and almost contiguous is a Carnedd and a small circle of twelve stones This tract had certainly been much inhabited for all around are the foundations of small buildings made of rounded stones suitable to the rudeness and simplicity of distant ages Small upright stones and numbers of small  Carnedds  are scattered in various places and the ves∣tige of a formed road is to be seen pointing from hence towards the  Conway  WHATSOEVER purpose the lesser circles might be designed for there is great reason to suppose that the greater especially that near to the  Maen y Campiau  were the  British  circus for the exhibition of antient games probably the  Eisteddfods  or sessions for deciding the merits of rivals in our  British Olympics  might have been originally held here or in similar places Of  British  games  THE ANTIENT GAMES  we had twentyfour  Pedair  CAMP  ar hugain  whose names as preserved by Dr  Davies  in his Dictionary I shall give with their explanation as far as in my power Of these ten were called GWROLGAMPAU or manly games of these six depended on bodily strength alone and were styled  Tadogion  i e  Father games  because no instrument whatsoever was necessary to perform them for they depended on the man naked as he was born The  Greeks  had their  Pentathlum  We had one more I Strength to raise weights II Running III Leaping IV Swimming V Wrestling VI Riding I imagine that the word  Marchogaeth  extends farther than the common acceptation and that the game intended was a con∣test between charioteers for no people were more skilled in the use of chariots in war than the  Britons  it is therefore impro∣bable that they would not in time of peace exert their art in  mimic combat or in competitions of speed in the festive field And these six were undoubtedly original games of this island and from the earliest of times of others some doubt may be made  THE remaining four manly games were  O Rymarfau  or what depended on skill in arms I Archery II Playing with the sword and buckler III Playing with the  Cleddyf Deuddwrn  or the twohanded sword the antient weapon of the  Britons  as exemplified in a statue of a soldier found in digging among the ruins of  London  after the great fire in  Monfaucon's Antiq  iv tab ix  IV  Chwarau Ffon Ddwybig  or playing with the twoend staff which seems to correspond with the more modern quarterstaff  AFTER these were the ten  Mabolgampau  or JUVENILE games Among them three species of the chare I Coursing with the grehound II Fishing III Fowling The remaining seven were of the domestic kind I  Bairddoniath  or poetical competi∣tions of which I have before spoken  In my account of the  Eisteddfoddau Caerwy Tour in Wales  i to some light is thrown on this and certain of the following articles  II Playing upon the harp III Reading  Welsh  IV Singing a  Cywydd  with music V Singing a  Cywydd  between four with accents VI Drawing of coats of arms VII Heraldry These two seem so conge∣nial as to be unnecessarily separated  AFTER these were four  Gogampiau  or  Subgames  I  Chwa∣rau Gwyddbwyll  a game like that of Draughts played with  men  and probably the game of  Fox and Goose Gwydd  signify∣ing a goose and  Gwerin y Wyddbwyll  the men of that game  II CHWARAU  Tawl Bwrdd  is probably  Back gammon  words of  British  origin  bach  little and  gammon  a battle the  strife of gamesters  and  Tawl bwrdd  is literally the cast on the table  III CHWARAU  Ffristeal  or the games of the dicebox of which we know no more than that dice had a concern in it And IVthly  Cyweiriaw Felyn  or the tuning of the harp  AFTER leaving the antiquities of  Goddw Glâs  I joined the turnpike road above  Sychnant  On the left was pointed to me a lofty hill impending over  Conway March  On its sum∣mit is  Castell Caer Lleion  a  British  post surrounded with ditches and strong ramparts of stones an additional defence to the country besides that of  Penmaen Mawr  The view of part of  Conway  and a large bend of the river with its rich and wooded banks are seen from the descent to them to great advantage  I ENTERED CONWAY at the upper gate  CONWAY  A more ragged town is scarcely to be seen within or a more beautiful one without The situation is on a steep slope to the verge of the river here a mile broad at highwater The form is nearly triangular surrounded with lofty walls guarded by twentyfour round towers The lower face of the triangle borders on the river A castle of matchless magnificence rises on a lofty rock at one corner and from near each end of the townwalls fronting the  Conwy  a curtain terminated with a round tower ran some way into the river the more effectually to prevent the approach of an enemy from the water Only one of these curtains exists the other with both the towers have long since perished  IN front is an extensive quay from which is a delightful view up and down the river The opposite side is hilly varied with  CONWAY CASTLE  CONWAY CASTLE  woods and gentlemen's seats and the bifurcated hill of  Diga∣nwy  a fortress The ground called  Arcadia  laid out by my worthy friend and old schoolfellow  Owen Holland  Esq  and  Plâstyrion  the house of the reverend Mr  Owen Jones  well merit a visit from the traveller  THE castle was built by  Edward  I in the year who I believe employed the architect who built  Caernarvon  All his skill seems to have been exerted here A more beautiful fortress never arose Its form is oblong placed on all parts on the verge of the precipitous rock One side is bounded by the river another by a creek full of water at every tide and most beautifully shaded by hanging woods The other two sides face the town Within are two courts and on the outside project eight vast towers each with a slender one of amazing elegance issuing from its top within which had been a wind∣ing staircase In one of the great towers is a fine window in form of an arched recess or bow ornamented with pillars This in antient times was an elegant part of architecture called the  oriel  usual in the houses of people of rank and appears from a poem of the very age in which this was built to have been the toilet of the ladies and probably might have been that of Queen  Elinor  In her ORYALL there she was  Closyd well with royal glas  Fulfullyd it was with ymagery  Every windowe by and by  On each side had ther a gynne  Sperde with manie a dyvers pynne  Part of the poem of the SQUIRE OF LOW DEGREE See Mr WARTON'S  Hist Poetry  i The  gynnes  were the fastenings of the casements which were often secured with  pynnes of yvere    THE great hall suited the magnificence of the founder  HALL  It is of a curved form conformable to the bend of the outward walls including one end with a large window which seems to have been the private chapel It extended a hundred and thirty feet in length was thirtytwo broad and of a fine height The roof once supported by eight noble arches six of which still remain A great fireplace at one end and another on the side warmed it and six windows to the country and three to the court gave light to this spacious apartment Beneath were vast vaults the magazines of all that contributed to the con∣vivial mirth above  THERE were two entrances into this fortress  ENTRANCES TO THE CASTLE  both contrived for security The one from the  Conwy  up a steep rock once a winding narrow stairs ending in a small advanced work before one of the gates of the castle and protected by small round towers At the other extremity is a similar work from which had been a drawbridge occasionally dropped into the town over a great foss This entrance is expressed in the vignette p of this volume  THE town contains but few inhabitants  TOWN  a considerable space being vacant of buildings It has four entrances the upper gate the lower or that next to the water a portal between that and the castle and another to the creek called  Porth y Felin  or the gate to the mill  EDWARD I made  Conwy  a free borough and ordered that the mayor who was the constable of the castle for the time being should preserve its privileges  William Sikun  was appointed first to that honor At present it is governed by one alderman a recorder coroner waterbailiff

Jorwerth  prince of  North Wales  in honor of the Blessed Virgin and All Saints  Dugdale's Monasticon  i  A long vaulted room of good masonry worked with clay but plaistered with lime and a  Saxon  door are still to be seen He endowed it with lands to a vast extent in  Caernarvonshire  and in  Anglesey  The same  and with privileges of great value among the lands are men∣tioned  Caput Wedva Vawr  and  Caput Grybcoch  and  Morva Din∣llin  It was exempted not only from the maintenance of all men horses dogs and hawks and even of those of the prince No one was to interfere in the elections or affairs of the house They were to enjoy all benefits of wrecks on the shores of their  property in the same manner as the prince did on his but no advantage was to be taken of similar misfortunes to the religious men but all their goods so wrecked were to be restored They and their servants were to be exempt in all parts from tolls pontage and the like and their free passage over the  Menai Conwy Barmouth Abermaw  and  Dyni  perhaps  Dyfi  is parti∣cularly provided for Numbers of other privileges are men∣tioned the charter of which is dated from  Aberconwy  and wit∣nessed by  Yorwerth Gam Gwin ap Ednewein Ydon  the prince's chaplain and by  Madog ap Cador  Dugdale's Monasticon      This shews that  Conwy  was a place of some note before the  English  conquest It pro∣bably had some sort of fortress before the existence of the pre∣sent its antient name being  Caer Gyffin Gyffin  being that of the stream that flows into the creek beneath the castle  MS in the possession of his grace the

and ceilings are swans owls cranes ostriches and bears and ragged staves the last the badges of  Robert Dudley  earl of  Leicester  a piece of flattery paid to him by the founder of the house  FEW of the remarkable events which have befel this place  EVENTS  are preserved in history When  Henry  III made his calami∣tous encampment under  Diganwy  opposite to this town he dispatched three hundred renegado  Welshmen  of the borders with some other troops to rescue a ship of provision which had been stranded on this side They succeeded but instigated by avarice sacrilegiously plundered the abbey and burnt seve∣ral houses belonging to it The loyal  Welsh  grew desperate attacked the banditti loaden with spoils slew numbers and hung or beheaded every prisoner whom they took  Powel      RICHARD II before his return from  Ireland  directed that the rendezvous of his forces destined to oppose the usurping  Bo∣lingbroke  should be here Forty thousand loyalists out of  Che∣shire  and  Wales  had assembled under the banners of the earl of  Salisbury  Wearied by the delays of their illfated prince numbers disbanded themselves yet sufficient remained ani∣mated against the usurper and determined to follow their king through all his fortunes  Richard  seized with a panic stole from  Conwy  in the night  Helinshed    was betrayed by the earl of  North∣umberland  and soon after perished in the hands of his enemy  In the  Tour in Wales  i is the sequel of his story    THE town was almost depopulated by the plague in and numbers of people were buried in the streets It was ob∣served to break out here within three weeks of the time it ap∣peared in  London  probably brought here by some sugitives  IN mention of the transactions in this place during the civil wars the last active scene of the life of Archbishop  Williams  must be related especially as it was a part for which he under∣went the greatest but perhaps unjust calumny As soon as he retired into  Wales  in he was resorted to by all the loyalists being the person on whose prudence and spirit they could fully rely He had received in charge from his majesty all  North Wales  and in particular the castle of  Conway  Philip's  Life of Archbishop  Williams  He began with fortifying his house at  Penrhyn  and was at consi∣derable expence in strengthening this fortress In the peril∣ous state of those times multitudes of the country gentlemen requested the archbishop to receive into the castle their writ∣ings plate and most valuable moveables He undertook the charge and gave to every owner a receipt by which he made himself liable to the loss and put his nephew  William Hookes  in possession of the place in  January    Philips    His Grace from that time was the protector of the country not only from the violence of the enemy but from the oppression of his own party In  May  Prince  Rupert  unfortunately superseded the pre∣late in his command and caused Sir  John Owen  to take posses∣sion of the castle This he did with most blameable violence and with a constant evasion of giving the archbishop any se∣curity of the valuables he had in charge  The same    AFFAIRS were in this state till  June  when  Williams  foreseeing ruin to himself irritated by injuries from those who had embarked in the same cause with himself and in the criti∣cal time when the king's affairs were desperate invited by General  Mytton  to put himself on the favor of parlement ac∣cepted his offer and assisted him in the reduction of the place  General Mytton's  Letter in  Drake's Parl Hist  xv    MYTTON by the advice of the archbishop took the town by storm on  August  th the latter assisted personally and was wounded in the neck  Rushworth  iv part i  With the severity usual at that time towards the  Irish Mytton  seized on all that were found and caused them to be tied back to back and flung into the river  Whitelook    The castle surrendered on the th of  November  and  Mytton  who is repre∣sented as a generous character more haughty than covetous  Philips    restored to every individual the property intrusted to  Williams  For these services the parlement granted him a general pardon and a release from all his sequestrations  THE beauty and grandeur of this fortress seemed to have induced the governing powers to forbear offering any violence to its walls that impiety was reserved for loyal hands A grant had been made of it by the king to  Edward Conway  earl of  Conway  In the earl employed his servant  Milward  to take down the iron timber and lead and to transport it to  Ireland  under pretence of its being for his majesty's service  The Earl's Letter in the Appendix    Thomas Bulkely  Esq  Colonel  Wynn  and several of the princi∣pal gentlemen of the country opposed the design but their  remonstrance was overruled and this noble pile reduced to nearly its present condition At present it is held from the crown by  Owen Holland  Esq  SEVERAL years ago the folly of some of the inhabitants by getting stones from the rock beneath one of the great towers brought down a vast segment The ruins are the most awful I ever beheld lying in stupendous fragments on the shore some so unbroken as to preserve both the grand external rotundity and inward concavity a hardened cement of stone and mortar eleven feet thick The prospect of the upper part of the tower remains entire suspended at a vast height above our heads ex∣hibiting in the breach such a strength of walling as might have given to the architect the most reasonable hope that his work would have endured to the end of time When I image to myself the gay appearance of this fortress filled by the fes∣tive court of  Edward  his beloved  Elinor  and all the train of gallant nobility who passed a  Christmas  here exulting at the conquest of my hardy countrymen and when I survey its pre∣sent ruins my mind naturally falls into melancholy reflections suitable to the scene around me Let me only change the rock on  Towy  's flood for that of  Conwy  and a favorite poet will express the ideas that must arise in the mind of its past and present state  Deep at its feet in  Conwy  's flood  His sides are cloath'd with waving wood  And antient towers crown his brow  That cast an awful look below  Whose ragged walls the Ivy creeps  And with her arms from falling keeps  So both a safety from the wind  On mutual dependence find  'Tis now the Raven's blank abode  'Tis now th' apartment of the Toad  And there the Fox securely feeds  And there the poisonous Adder breeds  Conceal'd in ruins moss and weeds  While ever and anon there falls  Huge heaps of hoary moulder'd walls  Yet time has seen that lifts the low  And level lays the lofty brow  Has seen this broken pile compleat  Big with the vanity of state  But transient is the smile of Fate  A little rule a little sway  A sunbeam in a winter's day  Is all the proud and mighty have  Betwixt the cradle and the grave  DYER'S  Grongar Hill  FROM  Conway  I took the road towards  Caer Hên  BATTLE OF KYMRYD  the  Conovium  of the  Romans  In my way passed near  Kymryd  a place noted for a bloody battle in between  Anarawd  prince of  Wales  and the  Saxons  under  Edred  duke of  Mercia  The  Britons  were victorious and drove the invaders back into their own country  Anarawd  styled the battle  Dîal Rodri  or the  Revenge of Roderic  for his father  Roderic  the Great had the year before been slain by the  Saxons  Cambden  ii  Powel      PASSED by the ferry of  Tal y Cafn  At a small distance from it is a large artificial mount called  Bryn y Castell  probably the site of a watchtower belonging to  Conovium  and judici∣ously placed in a very contracted part of the vale to observe the approach of an enemy from this side  CAER HĒN  CARE HĒN  the old  Conovium  lay in a low spot near the river There are still to be seen remains of  Roman  bricks and a sunk building divided into two parts probably the remains of the hypocaust from which the hollow brick or funnel preserved at  Gloddaeth  was taken On one of the common bricks was inscribed LEG Xthe  Legio Antonianus  which served in these parts under Ostorius  Cambden  Here also was found the cake of copper mentioned in the d page of my first volume Near the church are some remains of walls which are all that are left of this once noted place The Itinerary places it twentyfour miles from  Segontium  and nineteen from  Varis  I PROCEEDED a little farther and turned up a very steep road by the church of  Llanbedr  to the summit of a very lofty hill called  Pen Caer Helen  PEN CAER HELEN  to try to discover more of  Helen  's noted road but my search was fruitless Yet my pains were reward∣ed by the sight of a  British  post of great strength and in some parts singularly guarded It had the usual fosses and vast ram∣parts of stones with some remains of the facing of walls and the foundations of three or four round buildings but what struck me much were two considerable spaces of ground thickly set with sharppointed stones set upright in the earth as if they had been to serve the use of  chevaux du frize  to impede the approach of an enemy From this hill is one way a wild and barren pro∣spect of  Carnedd Llewelyn  and a long tract of rude hills and stoney bottoms and on another the whole extent of the fertile  Nant Conwy  Descended returned the same road and passed the river in the good ferry at  Tal y Cafn  FROM hence I continued my journey through the wooded parish of  Llansaintfraid  beautifully sloping to the water's edge The rout I took was towards  Llandudno  the grand boundary of the entrance of the  Conwy  From the road in many parts are most august views of the vast expanse of the river and the majestic towers of  Conwy  Similar views and old fortified towns I have seen frequent on the  Rhine  but in magnificence far inferior to these our  British  glory After a ride of about three miles descend to a flat Pass by  Marle  a house of fine appearance but now little more than a case having suffered by fire about forty years ago It is picturesquely seated under a lofty rock almost covered with wood and op∣posite to the town of  Conwy  It had been originally the pro∣perty of the  Hollands  It fell afterwards to Sir  Hugh Williams  second son of Sir  Gryffydd Williams  of  Penrhyn  and on the death of his grandson Sir  Robert  devolved to Sir  Thomas Pren∣dergast  of the kingdom in right of his lady  Anne  sister to Sir  Robert  HIGH above  Marle  BODSCALLAN  is  Bodscallan  the property of Sir  Roger Mostyn  in right of his wife  Margaret  daughter of the reverend  Hugh Wynne  I find  Richard Mostyn  second son of  Thomas ap Richard ap Howel  in possession of it and that he had one daughter  Margaret  married to  Gryffydd Wynne  second son of  John Wynne ap Mereddydd  of  Gwedir  and who had his settlement at  Berth Du  near  Llanrwst  It is a fine situation environed with woods From a neglected terrace is a most beautiful view over the tops of trees of  Conwy  part of the river and the vast mountains the back ground of the pro∣spect  It is a place of great antiquity being mentioned in the record of  Caernarvon  but was inhabited in far earlier times as appears by the ruins of a small castlet now hid in woods on the top of a small hill near the present house  Bodscallan  signifies the dwellingplace of  Scallan  in all probability a word corrupted from  Caswallon  the owner in some distant period It was one of those townships called  Tre' Welyog  not entirely free The tenants were originally possessors of hereditary estates which were divided and subdivided among their posterity to the fourth descent after which they became possessed by branches independent of each other every one of whom paid for their own land  Record of  Caernarvon Bibl Litt    This possibly might have been one of the three  Gwelis  or estates of children from a common stock originally belonging to  Gloddaeth  The same  In the present house is a good portrait of old Sir  John Wynne  of  Gwedir  A small head on board of  Robert Wynn  founder of the  Plas Mawr  in  Conwy  He is painted in black with a book in his hand and with short grey hair and beard But the most remarkable is that of Dr  Ellis Pryse  of  Plas Yollin  in  Denbighshire  dated a creature of the earl of  Leicester  's and devoted to all his bad designs  Pryse  's dress is a white jacket with a broad turnover his hair yellow and his beard thin and of the same color his visage very long lank and hypocritical He was the greatest of our knaves in the period in which he lived the most dreaded oppressor in his neighborhood and a true syco∣phant for a common address of his letters to his patron was O LORD  in thee do I put my trust  FROM hence is a small walk to GLODDAETH  GLODDAETH  a seat of Sir  Roger Mostyn  's placed on the slope of a very extensive hill or limestone rock cloathed with successful plantations by Sir  Roger  grandfather of the present possessor Part of the plain below the house was planted by the same gentleman with fo∣resttrees and laid out according to the taste of his time in straight walks intersecting each other or radiating from a center distinguished by a statue  ITS WALKS  The upper walks having fortu∣nately a steep and stubborn rock for their basis checked the modish propensity to rectitude so there was a necessity to de∣viate from it but in no greater degree than the flexure of a zigzag would admit Notwithstanding some blemishes cor∣rigible at an easy rate these walks may be considered among those of the first rate of this island for such beauties of view which nature can bestow and from those spots favored by the sight of  Conwy  FINE VIEWS  I may add the majestic ones of antient art Every flight of path presents new and grand objects at first of the great windings of the river towards  Llanrwst  the lofty towers of  Conwy  and the venerable walls of the town and be∣yond a long extent of  alps  with  Moel Siabod  the  Drûm  and  Carnead Llewelyn  and  Dafydd  appearing with distinguished height From a little higher ascent is opened to us the dis∣charge of the  Conwy  into the sea sublimely bounded by the lesser  Penmaen  and the immense  Orm's Head  or  Llandudno  between which appear a fine bay the vast promotory of  Penmaen Mawr  the isle of  Priestholm  and the long extent of  Anglesey  After gaining the summit beneath is seen a considerable flat with the estuary of the river  Conwy  falling into the  Irish  sea on one side and the beautiful halfmoon bay of  Llandudno  on  the other one of whose horns is the great head of the same name the other the lofty rock  Rhiwleden  or the little  Orm's Head  A little farther progress brings us in sight of a great bay sweeping semicircularly the shores and beyond are the distant hills of  Flintshire  and the entrances into the estuaries of the  Mersey  and  Dce  frequently animated with shipping  BESIDES the adventitious trees and shrubs  RARE PLANTS  these walks afford great amusement to the botanists by their variety of rare plants all within a very small compass Among them that able bo∣tanist my

excellent collection of books and manuscripts among the last is a most beautiful copy of the first and second books of  Froissart  a manuscript on vellum with most elegant illuminations The frontispiece represents the author on his knees in a blue mantle presenting his book to  Ed∣ward  III A king of  France  distinguished by the  fleurs de lis  on his robes holds a queen by the hand who from the arms of  England  the lions on her robe seems to be Queen  Philippa  to whom  Froissart  was clerk of the closet She holds by the hand a little boy whose robe is also marked with the lions This must have been  Richard  of  Bourdeaux  her grandson after∣wards  Richard  II A lady and several other figures appear in the piece This book was given by Lord  Buckburst  to Sir  William Cecil

tenant owed only suit and service to the county and hundred courts and when they went to attend the prince in war they went at his expence  EGGLWYS RHOS  EGGLWYS RHOS  the parish church is in a flat at a small distance from  Gloddaeth  near a precipitous rock cloathed with wood called  Bryn Maelgwyn  Painted in the east window is  the figure of a man kneeling dressed in a herald's mantle with the arms of  Englefield  From the maimed inscription I collect that he must have been  Howel ap Tudor  of  Mostyn  Salisbury Pedigree    and that he had bestowed this window on the church  BUT this church is celebrated for the death of the prince of  Maelgwyn Gwynedd  who had taken shelter here to avoid the  Vâd felen  or yellow pestilence which at that time raged through  Europe  The  Britons  like the  Romans  personified disease In this instance it was to assume either the form of a  Basilisc  or the powers of one under the form of a fair woman who slew  Mael∣gwyn  with a glance as he

small distance from  Egglwys Rhos  The walls crossed the space between the hills and ran up their sides on the summit of one is a vestige of a round tower and here and there a few foundations of walls on the accessible parts Dr  Powel  from the authority of the  Welsh  historians  His notes on  Giraldus Cambr Itin  lib ii c  says there had been a city here which in was destroyed by lightning and  Cambden  adds that he believed it to have been the antient  Dictum  from its having been the station of a party of  Nervii Dictenses  under the later emperors I cannot discover the founder of the fortress on whose ruins I contemplate Possibly it might have been  Robert  of  Rudland  We are told this country was parcel of the possessions of the earls of  Chester  and that  Robert  was in it when he came to his fate On  July  the d our brave prince  Gryffydd ap Cynan  with three ships entered the  Conwy  and landing under the castle at highwater left the ships on shore at the recess of the tide He ravaged the neighboring country and drove towards his vessels a great booty of men and cattle  Robert  indignant at this descended from his fortress attended by a single soldier  Osbern de

The same  At length  Diganwy  was in totally dismantled by our last prince  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd  NOT far from hence  ANTIENT TOWER  on the top of a low hill near  Bryniau  is an antient tower Its form is circular its height about twenty feet the diameter twelve Its walls compose only two thirds of a circle the rest is open to the top and the finishing of the walls complete without any appearance of there ever having been a door and this opening is to the land Within are the marks of two floors Round the inside are three rows of  square holes none of which pass through the building Its walls are of great thickness and the mortar appears very antient I can make no conjecture about the use but describe it in or∣der to exercise the talents of others  CONTINUED my ride along the shore by the flat  isthmus  which connects the high land of  Gloddaeth  with the great pro∣montory  Llandudno  Ride along part of the last on a narrow road above the sea having on the right steep hills and preci∣pices Reach  Gogarth  GOGARTH  a long but narrow tract of great fer∣tility It had been an appendage to the abbey of  Conway  of which there remains part of a very strong building  I ASCENDED on a very long and steep path to the top of  Llandudno  LLANDUDNO OR ORM'S HEAD  a beautiful sheepwalk consisting of a fine turf ex∣cept where the rock appears extending near four miles in length and one in breadth It lies in the manor of  Gogarth  belonging to the see of  Bangor  The western extremity is a vast precipice the haunt of various seafowls in the season of breeding  SEAFOWLS  The Gulls possess the lowest part above them the Razorbills and Guillemots have their quarters over them croak the Corvorants and Herons occupy the highest regions and scattered in different parts are a few Puffins and black Guillemots The Peregrine Falcon builds in these rocks  FALCONS  The kind was in the days of falconry so excellent that the great mini∣ster  Burleigh  sent a letter of thanks to an ancestor of Sir  Roger Mostyn  for a present of a cast of Hawks from this place  FALCONRY was in high esteem among the  Welsh  ANTIENT FAL∣CONRY  Our prince had his chief falconer who held the fourth rank among the offi∣cers of his court He held his lands free had a double portion of provender for his horse the prince supplied him with woollen  cloaths the princess with linen He brought his cup with him into the hall but was not allowed to drink more than would quench his thirst least he should get fuddled and neglect his Hawks He was allowed the hearts and lungs of all the animals in the royal kitchen and sometimes a barren ewe to feed his birds Whenever his Hawks killed any of the three most noble species of game the Heron the Bittern or the Crane he received from the prince three services that of holding his stirrup when he descended from his horse of holding his horse while he was taking the Hawks from the game and of holding his stirrup again when he mounted his horse and at night the prince honored him with serving him thrice at table with his own hands In case the falconer took any of the royal birds in the prince's absence he was to bring it into the hall and shew it to him on that the prince was to arise or if he did not he was to bestow on him the robe which he then wore During the time that the Hawks were in their mew the falconer was not bound to answer any suit If he killed his horfe in the exercise of his office the prince was to find him another The fine for an injury to the chief falconer was vi cows and cxxvi pence His slaughter was not to be atoned for less than cxxvi cows  L  ges Wallicae  to  Let me conclude with saying that there was a peculiar tax for the support of this office called  Cylch Hebog Yddjon  Record of  Caernarvon  in  Bibliotheea Litteraria    which fell on the vassals for the prince contributed little or nothing to the expence of his amusements  THE northern side of this promontory is broken into pre∣cipices of various heights and the base of both these sides is  washed by a very deep water It is well worth the labor of ascending to the highest point to view the extensive and va∣rious prospects  ON the same side are the remains of several rude walls without mortar called  Llety Vadog  or the house of  Madoc  a supposed ancestor of  Gloddaeth  and not far from it is a strait narrow path with stones on each side probably the remains of two walls a watchplace for Deer as the name  Wylfa yr Ceirw  signifies  ON a great eminence called  Dinas  is a large enclosure The edge of the hill is surrounded with a rude wall and within are multitudes of small circular hollows about twelve feet in diameter environed with walls such as are found on  Tre'r Caeri  and similar places the rough habitations of our distant ancestors Near this place is a  Maen Sigl  rockingstone a great one whose point of contact with the ground is so small as to make it moveable with the left touch The country people call it  Crŷd Tudno St Tudno's Cradle  This is sur∣rounded with a foss and has a formed road to it It is the conjecture of the learned that the  Druids  made these stones an instrument of imposition on their votaries and in case of any judicial determinations pretended that none but their holy hands could move them and probably they were surrounded with a foss and had their prescribed road to keep off the vul∣gar and give greater solemnity to the miraculous decision The ingenious  Bernier  relates a superstition not very foreign from this At  Sendbrary  in the kingdom of  Cachemire  the  Bramins  the  Druids  of  India  shewed him a stone which the strongest man could not lift yet eleven of those holy men  with the tip of their finger could effect it on praying to their saint  Bernier's vojage of Cachemire      FROM hence I passed by the church  LLANDUDNO CHURCH  on the bleakest of situa∣tions above the sea and remote from all dwellings It is de∣dicated to St  Tudno  of  Maes Gwyddno  the country now over∣flown by the sea between  Meirionyddshire  and  Llein  In de∣scending from this promontory I passed by several copper works which at times are worked to advantage The ride from hence along the side of  Llandudno  bay is extremely plea∣sant I ascended to  Gloddaeth  near the foot of  Rhewledin  a vast rock which swarms in the season with Razorbills and Puffins and with Rock Pigeons abundance of which regularly breed here in preference to the dovehouses which they con∣stantly quit at their layingtime  I DESCENDED from  Gloddaeth  to the sea side about two miles distant Saw close to the shore the singular little building called  St Trillo's Chapel  It is oblong has a window on each side and at the end a small door and a vaulted roof paved with round stones instead of being slated Within was a well The whole building is surrounded with a stone wall  ON a hill about half a mile distant from this chapel is the church of  Llandrillo  LLANDRILLO  dedicated to the same saint Near it is a large ruined house called  Bryn Euryn  formerly called  Llŷs Maelgwyn Gwynedd  who had a palace on this spot About the twelfth century it was inhabited by the great  Ednyfed Vychan  and some time in the last was possessed by a family of the name of  Conwy  of  Welsh  descent derived from  Gryffydd Goch  lord of  Rhos  and  Rhyfoniod  KEEP along the shore and pass by  Rhos Vynach  RHOS VYNACH  or the Marsh of the Monks having been the property of  Conwy  abbey The church still keeps share in a considerable wear which runs from this point the bishop and the vicar of  Llandrillo  having the fish of every tenth tide between them At times they have a good chance of a profitable capture for in two successive tides forty pounds worth of mackrel have been taken  FROM  Rhos Vynach  the land recedes inwards and forms a pretty bay The country slopes to the water edge and is va∣ried with woods and cultivation  Penmaen Rhos  PENMAEN RHOS  a great lime∣stone rock juts into the sea at the end of the bay In my me∣mory the traveller went along a narrow path cut on its front like the road on  Penmaen Mawr  but infinitely more terrible and dangerous a fine coachroad has of late years been formed far behind this precipice From thence I descended to  Llan∣ddulas  a small village and church In one of the deep bottoms of this neighborhood was betrayed the unfortunate prince  Ri∣chard  II who had been deceived by the earl of  Northumber∣land  to go along with him from  Conwy  to meet  Bolingbroke  to settle amicably the quarrel between them Hereabouts he suddenly found himself surrounded by a large band of armed men placed there by the treacherous earl who seizing on  Ri∣chard  delivered him captive to the usurper in  Flint  castle  See the whole story agreeably expressed by suitable prints from old illumi∣nated MSS in Mr  Strutt's Regal Antiquities    A LITTLE farther on the right hand high above the road is  Cefn Ogo  CEFN OGO  a lofty precipice white unless where darkened by the ivy which spreads along the front In the middle is the  most magnificent entrance into a cave which  Britain  can boast It seems like the portal of a noble cathedral arched and di∣vided within by what has the appearance of a great column  FROM near this place begins the rich arable flat which ex∣tends over  Rudland Marsh  and beyond  Prestatyn  in  Flintshire  The small town of  Abergeleu  lies near the sea  ABERGELEU  about a mile from  Cefn Ogo  It lies near the clayey cliffs which impend over the sea Tradition says that in old times that element had over∣whelmed a vast tract of inhabited country once extending northward a dateless nameless epitaph on the churchyard wall is called in as evidence  Yma mae'n gorwedd yn monwent mihangel gwr oeddai annedd dair miltor yn y gogledd  In this churchyard lies a man who lived three miles to the north of it  But as better proof I have observed at lowwater far from the clayey banks a long tract of hard loam filled with the bodies of oak trees tolerably entire but so soft as to be cut with a knife as easily as wax  OF this parish was  Marchud ap Cynan  MARCHUD AP CYNAN  cotemporary with  Roderic  the Great and one of the tribes of  North Wales  whose posterity gave princes to the  British  empire His seat was  Brynffanigl  where likewise his descendant the great  Ednyfed Vychan  sometimes resided  ABERGELEU is bounded to the right by high limestone hills at times productive of lead ore On one of them projecting from the rest called  Coppa yr Wylfa  COPPA YR WYLFA  or the mount of the watch∣tower is a very strong  British  post The front is a great pre∣cipice out of whose interstices grows the  Aria Theophrasti  and across the accessible part are defences of stone and earth In a glen beneath is a ditch called  Ffôs y Bleiddiaid  or the ditch  of the Wolves possibly from the frequency of those animals in these parts Mr  Llwyd  in his Itinerary speaks of a mount near  Abergeleu  divided in two on which formerly stood a castle called  Pen y Pīl  PEN Y PĪL  possibly a residence of the antient lords  FROM  Abergeleu  I ascended to the neighboring parish of  Cegidoc  or as the  English  call it St  George  It was formerly annexed to St  Asaph  and the parishioners were obliged to re∣pair the street wall of the churchyard  HIGH above this place on the top of a hill called  Pen y Parc  is a very strong post said to have been occupied by  Owen Gwynedd  after his fine retreat before  Henry  II  CAMP OF OWEN GWYNFDD  whom he kept here at bay and politically secured his dominions from further invasion for it was on this spot not among the  Snowdon  hills as Lord  Lyttelton  ii d ed octavo  supposes that our gallant prince made a most effectual stand and stopped all further pro∣gress of the invader On the accessible sides are double and treble ditches and ramparts the others are sufficiently guarded by precipices The area is near three quarters of a mile round and near the edge of the steep part facing  Rudland  is smoothed into the form of a terrace  ST GEORGE had in this parish his  Holy Well  SUPERSTITIONS  at which the  British Mars  had his offering of horses for the rich were wont to offer one to secure his blessing on all the rest He was the tutelar saint of those animals all that were distempered were brought sprinkled with the water and this blessing bestowed  Rhad  DUW  a Sant  SIOR  arnat  The blessing of GOD and St  George  be on thee  THE well of St  Aelian  a parish not far from  Llandrillo  in  Caernarvonshire  has been in great repute for the cures of all diseases by means of the intercession of the saint who was first invoked by earnest prayers in the neighboring church He was also applied to on less worthy occasions and made the in∣strument of discovering thieves and of recovering stolen goods Some repair to him to imprecate their neighbors and to request the saint to afflict with sudden death or with some great mis∣fortune any persons who may have offended them The be∣lief in this is still strong for three years have not elapsed since I was threatened by a fellow who imagined I had in∣jured him with the vengeance of St  Aelian  and a journey to his well to curse me with effect  I SHALL here bring into one point of view the several religi∣ous customs used among us in former times  RELIGIOUS CUSTOMS  which have been gradually dropped in proportion as the age grew enlightened Several were local several extended through the whole country perhaps some which were expressive of their hatred of vice or which had a charitable end might as well have been retained notwithstanding the smack of folly that was often to be per∣ceived in them  IN church at the name of the Devil an universal spitting seized the congregation as if in contempt of that evil spirit and whenever  Judas  was mentioned they expressed their ab∣horrence of him by smiting their breasts  IF there be a  Fynnon Vair  the well of our Lady or any other saint the water for baptism was always brought from thence and after the ceremony was over old women were very fond of washing their eyes in the water of the font  PREVIOUS to a funeral it was customary when the corpse was brought out of the house and laid upon the bier for the next of kin be it widow mother sister or daughter for it must be a female to give over the coffin a quantity of white loaves in a great dish and sometimes a cheese with a piece of money stuck in it to certain poor persons After that they present in the same manner a cup of drink and require the person to drink a little of it immediately When that is done all pre∣sent kneel down and the minister if present says the Lord's Prayer after which they proceed with the corpse and at every crossway between the house and the church they lay down the bier kneel and again repeat the Lord's Prayer and do the same when they first enter the churchyard It is also cus∣tomary in many places to sing psalms on the way by which the stillness of rural life is often broken into in a manner finely productive of religious reflections  To this hour the bier is carried by the next of kin a custom considered as the highest respect that filial piety can pay to the deceased This was a usage frequent among the  Romans  of high rank and it was thought a great continuance of the good fortune which had attended  Metellus Macedonicus  through his whole being that when he had in the fulness of years passed out of life by a gentle decay amidst the kisses and embraces of his nearest connections he was carried to the funeral pile on the shoulders of his four sons  Valer Max  lib vii c  and let me add that each one of them had enjoyed the greatest offices of the com∣monwealth  Plinii Hist Nat  lib vii c    AMONG the  Welsh  it was reckoned fortunate for the deceased if it should rain while they were carrying him to church that his bier might be wet with the dew of heaven  IN some places it was customary for the friends of the dead to kneel and say the Lord's Prayer over the grave for several  Sundays  after the interment and then to dress the grave with flowers  Manibus date lilia plenis  Purpureos spargam flores animamque nepotis  His saltèm accumulem donis et fungar inani  Munere  Bring fragrant flowers the fairest lilies bring  With all the purple beauties of the spring  These gifts at lest these honors I'll bestow  On the dear youth to please his shade below  WARTON  IT is still usual to stick on the eve of St  John  the  Baptist  over the doors sprigs of St  John's wort  or in lieu of it the common Mugwort The intent was to purify the house from evil spirits in the same manner as the  Druids  were wont to do with  Vervaine  which still bears with the  Welsh  the significant title of  Cas gan Gythral  or  the Daemons aversion  UPON  Christmas  day  PLYGAN  about three o'clock in the morning most of the parishioners assembled in church and after prayers and a sermon continued there singing psalms and hymns with great devotion till broad day and if through age or infirmity any were disabled from attending they never failed having prayers at home and carols on our SAVIOUR'S nativity The former part of the custom is still preserved but too often per∣verted  into intemperance This act of devotion is called  Ply∣gan  or the  Crowing of the Cock  It has been a general belief among the superstitious that instantly  at his warning  Whether in sea or fire in earth or air  Th' extravagant and erring spirit hies  To his confine  But during the holy season the Cock was supposed to exert his power throughout the night from which undoubtedly ori∣ginated the  Welsh  word  Plygan  as applied to this custom Accordingly  Shakespear  finely describes this old opinion  Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes  Wherein our SAVIOUR'S birth is celebrated  The bird of dawning singeth all night long  And then they say no spirit walks abroad  The nights are wholesome then no planets strike  No fairy takes no witch hath power to charm  So hallow'd and so gracious is the time  SOON after leaving  St George  KINMAEL  I passed by  Kinmael  house and park in a lofty situation on the left This place had been during four generations the property of the  Hollands  of a noble  English  descent long settled in this part of  Britain  and branched into several respectable families The pedigrees de∣rive them from a Sir  Thomas Holland  who tradition says came with another brother into  Wales  in troublesome times I have reason to suppose them to have been  William  and  Tho∣mas  the two younger sons of  John Holland  duke of  Exeter  who died in and left to each of them an annuity of forty  pounds  Dugdale's Baron  ii  They were of a most unpopular family therefore pro∣bably retired to shun the miseries they might experience in that age of civil discord  Pierce Holland  eleventh in descent from Sir  Thomas  made his settlement at  Kinmael  by his marriage with  Catherine  daughter to  Richard ap Evan ap Dafydd Vychan  and  Alice  his wife heiress of the place daughter of  Gryffydd Lloyd  Ap Evan ap Rhys ap Gryffydd Lloyd ap Rohyn ap Rhys ap Robert  In the last century one of his descendants had two daughters Colonel  Carter  an officer in the service of the par∣lement made choice of  Catherine  the youngest and took the estate with her A wag said that he had chosen the best piece of  Holland  in the country He left the eldest sister  Mary  to Colonel  Price  of  Rhiwlas  a royalist About fifty years ago a descendant of his  John Carter  Esq  alienated the place to the late Sir  George Wynne  Bart  IN a very wet situation  VAENOL  beneath  Kinmael  is  Vaenol  one of the best old houses in the county of  Flint  It was built in by  John Lloyd  a younger son of  Wickwer  and register of St  Asaph  in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  a place extremely profitable before the powers of the church were abridged At this place  Brynpolin  and  Wickwer  had been chapels of ease to St  Asaph  and three out of the four vicars did duty at them in turn A fine stone coffin from that of  Vaenol  lies in the garden of this house  IN my way from  Kinmael  BODLEWITHAN  see  Bodlewithan  the seat of  John Williams  Esq  a purchase of his father second son to Sir  Wil∣liam  speaker of the house of commons Previous to that it  had been for many generations the property of the  Humphries  descended from  Rhys Goch  brother to  Gweryd ap Rhys  one of the fifteen tribes of  North Wales  and cotemporary with  Owen Gwynedd  Descend to  Pengwern  PENGWERN  the seat of Sir  Edward Lloyd  Bart an excellent new house built by him on the site of the old one which had been built by  Elen  sister to Archbishop  Williams  for the son of her first husband  Evan Gryffydd  owner of the place Her second husband was Sir  Peter Mutton  The por∣trait of her brother in a clergyman's dress with the seals and arms of  Lincoln  of which see he was possessed during the time he was lord keeper is preserved here Another of Sir  Peter Mutton  in his scarlet robes a ruff and great hat and another of Lady  Mutton  a handsome woman in a black gown high hat and with a feather fan and great kerchief aet From hence I passed through  Rudland  and  Newmarket  to the comforts of my fireside  FROM DOWNING TO MONTGOMERY AND SHREWSBURY  ON  Wednesday July  th I left home breakfasted with the reverend Mr  Lloyd  at  Caerroys  and with him de∣scended into the pretty little vale which leads from  Mold  to  Denbigh  and immediately on crossing it ascend the steep and lofty side of  Bwlch Coed y Mynydd  a great hill the last of the  Clwydian  chain before it is broken by the streight of  Bod∣vari  On the side of this hill at  Llys Coed y Mynydd  towards the left lived  Ednowain Bendew  or  Ednowain  the Strong∣headed lord of  Tegengl  in and one of the fifteen tribes of  North Wales  THESE  Llwythau  TRIBES OF NORTH WALES  or tribes were the nobility of  North Wales  They commenced extremely early and at different times were lords of distinct districts and called to that honor by se∣veral princes The latest were about the time of  Dafydd ap Owen Gwynedd  who began his reign in We are left ig∣norant of the form by which they were called to this rank  All we know is that each of them enjoyed some office in the court of our princes which seems to have been hereditary and probably to be attendant on the honor  AFTER reaching the summit of the hill a rich and extensive view presented itself of the fertile vale of  Clwyd  beneath and the great range of our alpine country at length jutting into the sea at the bold promontories of  Llandudno  and  Penmaen Mawr  The descent into the vale is gradual along a beautiful terrace for a considerable space far above it  Vronyw  the seat of  John Madocks  Esq  commands a delightful prospect Its master adds to the many illustrious proofs we have at this period that the modern  Welsh  are as eminent in persuasive rhetoric as our  Gaulish  neighbors were in days of yore  PASS by the small churches of  LlanGwifan LlanDyrnog LlanGynbafal  and  LlanRhychan  dedicated to the Saints  Gwy∣fan Tyrnog Cynhafal  and  Rhychan  all in the county of DEN∣BIGH and diocese of  Bangor  Beneath the church of  Llanbe∣der  reach nearly the bottom of the vale and continue my journey through  Ruthin  and along  Nantclwyd  by a good old house of the same name  AFTER resting one night at  Corwen  proceed as far as  Llan∣drillo  on the road to  Bala  and near that village turn to the left into a narrow glen much wooded watered by a rude tor∣rent and bounded by high hills At its extremity near a farm called  Blaen y Cwm  MILLTIR GERRIC  begin to ascend  Milltir Gerrig  or the  Stoney Mile  a  Bwlch  or pass amidst the  Berwyn  hills about a mile in length with the mountains black with heath soaring on each fide to a stupendous height It is the great pass in these parts from  Meirionyddshire  into  and divides the counties the latter is called by the  Welsh Sir Tre Faldwyn  or the shire of the town of  Baldwin  lieutenant of the marches in the time of the Conqueror who built the town the name of which was afterwards changed to that of  Montgomery  derived from  Roger de Montgomery  the founder of the castle which name it gave to the county when it was formed into one by  Henry  VIII The first member that appears on record was  Edward Leech  Esq  who sat in  Humphry Llwyd  justly celebrates the fertility of its vallies the stature and beauty of its inhabitants but stigmatises them with the character of idleness and of being addicted to useless amusements  Commentariolum      The descent from this pass is very steep but a fine road was then forming with the great view of giving the  Irish  a shorter way into their country through  Oswestry  and over the  Bwlch  through the county of  Meirionydd  This is one of the vast designs of the present age which will effect communications with places before almost inaccessible  ON arriving at the bottom I again found myself in narrow vales loftily bounded After about three miles riding reached  Llangynog  LLANGYNOG  a small village in the parish of the same name in the diocese of  St Asaph  This place was the source of shortlived wealth to the maternal relation of the present earl of  Powys  LEAD MINE  A lead mine was discovered here in the year which was in most parts a vein of three yards and a half thick  and was worked to the depth of a hundred yards when the water became too powerful It continued in a flourishing state during a period of near forty years yielded about four thou∣sand tons annually was sold at  l  a ton and smelted on the spot and brought in a clear revenue to the family of twenty thousand pounds a year  A SLATE quarry has been discovered of late years in the pa∣rish About were sold from  November  to  November  which sell at the rate of from  s  to  s  a thousand but the want of water carriage is a great loss to the work  AT about two miles distance from  Llangynog  I turned up a small valley to the right to pay my devotions to the shrine of St  Monacella  ST MONACELLA  or as the  Welsh  style her  Melangell  Her legend relates that she was the daughter of an  Irish  mo∣narch who had determined to many her to a nobleman of his court The princess had vowed celibacy She fled from her father's dominions and took refuge in this place where she lived fifteen years without seeing the face of man  Brochwel Yscythrog  prince of  Powys  being one day a harehunting pur∣sued his game till he came to a great thicket when he was amazed to find a virgin of surprising beauty engaged in deep devotion with the hare he had been pursuing under her robe boldly facing the dogs who retired to a distance howling notwithstanding all the efforts of the sportsmen to make them seize their prey Even when the huntsman blew his horn it stuck to his lips  Brochwel  heard her story and gave to God and her a parcel of lands to be a sanctuary to all that fled there He desired her to found an abbey on the spot She did so and died  abbess in a good old age She was buried in the neighboring church called  Pennant  CHURCH OF PENNANT MELANGELL  and from her distinguished by the addition of  Melangell  Her hard bed is shewn in the cleft of a neighboring rock Her tomb was in a little chapel or oratory adjoining to the church and now used as a vestryroom This room still is called  Cellybedd  or the  Cell of the Grave  but her reliques as well as her image have been long since re∣moved but I think the last is still to be seen in the church∣yard The legend is perpetuated by some rude wooden carv∣ings of the saint with numbers of hares scuttling to her for pro∣tection She properly became their patroness They were called  Mwyn Melangell    St Monacella  's Lambs Till the last century so strong a superstition prevaled that no person would kill a hare in the parish and even later when a hare was pursued by dogs it was firmly believed that if any one cried  God  and St Mo∣nacella be with thee  it was sure to escape  See her life    IN the churchyard is a stone with the figure of an armed man which now serves as a common gravestone but once covered the remains of the eldest son of  Owen Gwynedd Jor∣werth Drwyndwn  TOMB OF JORWERTH DRWYNDWN  or  Edward  with the  broken nose  who was put aside of the succession on account of the blemish  Powel's Hist▪ Wales    Hither he had fled for refuge from the cruelty of his brother  Dafydd ap Owen Gwynedd  this place having been one of our most ce∣lebrated sanctuaries On his shield is inscribed  Hic jacet Etwart  Tradition says he was killed not far from hence at a place called  Bwlch Croes Jorwerth  THIS valley is exceedingly picturesque inclosed by hills on all sides except its entrance watered by the  Tanat  which  springs not far off The upper end is bounded by two vast precipices down which at times fall two great cataracts be∣tween them juts out the great and rude promontory of  Moel ddu Mawr  which almost divides the precipices into equal parts and all together formed a fine and solemn retreat for de∣votees On the side of this valley is the house of  Llechwedd∣garth  the property of  Thomas Thomas  Esq  Continue my journey for some time along the valley then ascend and descend a series of grassy hills of a moderate height and observe in many parts the narrower passes crossed by entrenchments in old times designed to interrupt the inroads of an invader It is said that a  Roman  road goes near this place towards  Aber∣ystwyth  BODFACH  Descend to  Bodfach  the seat of my friend  Bel Lloyd  Esq  by virtue of his marriage with Miss  Price  heiress of the place This and several other estates even as far as the borders of  Shropshire  belonged to the  Kyffins  so named from being  Kyffi∣niad  or borderers They were descended from  Eneon Evell  or  Eneon the Twin  brother to  Kynric Evell  illegitimate sons of  Madoc ap Meredydd ap Blyddyn ap Cynven  prince of  Powys  who gave  Eneon  his portion in this country and  Kynric  his in  Molesdale  and its neighborhood  Owen Brogynton  eldest of his natural children was settled in  Edeirnion  THE valley about  Bodfach  expands is admirably cultivated is watered by the  Cain  and prettily bordered by low hills finely wooded The town and church of  Llanvyllin  happily fill one angle and vary the view  FROM  Bodfach  I made an excursion to  Llwydiarth  LLWYDIARTH  a large old house in the parish of  Llanwddyn  seated in a hilly naked country It was formerly the property of the great family of  the  Vaughans  descended from  Aleth Hên  king of  Dived  or  Pembrokeshire  The estate was conveyed to the late Sir  Watkin Williams Wynn  by his first wife daughter and heiress to the last owner From one part of the ride had a view into  Cardi∣ganshire  and of the great naked mountain of  Plynlimmon  co∣vered with heath or moory grass  I CANNOT omit in this place mention of an excursion formerly made to  Llanrhaiadr yn Mochnant  a neighboring parish partly in this county partly in  Denbighshire  LLANRHAIADR YN MOCHNANT  The church is seated in the last dedicated to St  Dogvan  son of  Brychan  Dr  Wil∣liam Morgan  who first translated the Bible into  Welsh  was vicar of this He was rewarded by Queen  Elizabeth  with the bishoprick of  Llandaff  in and was removed to that of St  Asaph  in where he died  September  th and was interred in the cathedral  THE facetious but learned preacher Dr  South  was the last rector of the parish On his decease the rectorial tithes were appropriated by act of parlement to the maintenance of the choir and repair of the cathedral church of St  Asaph  I MUST speak with due respect of the memory of the late worthy vicar  PISTILL RHAIADR  Dr  Worthington  to whose hospitable house I was indebted for a seasonable reception the wet evening which for∣tunately preceded my visit to the celebrated cataract  Pistill Rha∣iadr  It terminates the precipitous end of a very narrow valley and as it were divides a bold front of the  Berwyn  mountains After sliding for some time along a small declivity it darts down at once twothirds of the precipice and falling on a ledge has in process of time worn itself a passage through the rock and makes a second cataract beneath a noble arch which  it has formed on the slippery summit of which a daring shepherd will sometimes terrify you with standing The se∣cond fall reaches the bottom and assumes the name of the  Rhaiadr  or the cascade The desect of this noble fall is the want of wood When I visited it the approach was very bad but that is not only effectually remedied by the late benevo∣lent vicar but as I am informed he has besides erected a cot∣tage as a retreat to the traveller from the fury of a storm  THE abundance of sheep which enliven these hills brought at the time I visited the country great wealth into it The flannel manufacture and that of a coarse cloth for the army and for the covering the poor negroes in the  West Indies  is manufactured in most parts of the county It is sent and sold in the rough to  Shrewsbury  a practice very contrary to the interest of the country  LEAVE  Bodfach  and for the sake of a beautiful view am led by Mr  Lloyd  a little out of my way to the top of a hill from whence is a prospect of a rich expanded vale with the church of  Llanvechan  in the midst Part is bounded by low and fertile hills The great rock of  Llan y Mynach  the magazine of limestone for a vast tract of country closes one side beyond them extends the great flat of  Shropshire  with the  Wrekin  hill rising insulated in the distant ground I returned through  Llanfyllin  LLANFYLLIN  a small town which had a charter bestowed on it by  Llewelyn ap Gryffydd ap Gwynwynwyn  in the reign of  Ed∣ward  II and confirmed by  Edward de Charlton  lord of  Powys  This gave the burgesses exemption from tolls  Theam  through∣out his territories  Gileam  and  Hampsum  They could take imprison and try any thieves or malefactors and should such  escape they had liberty of pursuing them for a league round the town Any stranger residing in it and paying scot and lot for a year became free It is governed by two bailiffs chosen annually who among other privileges granted it by  Charles  II were made justices of the peace within the corpora∣tion during the time of their office  Cambden  ii    RIDE for some time on the  Oswestry  road Ascend to the right go near  Bryn Gwyn  a seat of  William Mostyn  Esq  above which is a circular  British  post Numbers of them front the low country on the hills which jut into it as if guards to pro∣tect the internal parts from invasion Across the road in one place I met the vestiges of a very strong rampart to defend a pass into the vale of  Meivod  which soon after appeared in view The church and village are situated in the middle of the valley  VALE OF MEIVOD  which is quite flat extends in length more than five miles and about half a mile broad Three parts are bounded by low hills prettily wooded one end opens into the plain and is finely terminated by the  Freiddin  hills a vast mass and con∣spicuous feature in this county and part of  Shropshire  The  Vyrnyw  called by Dr  Powel Marnovia  a beautiful river winds along the middle of the vale Its borders rich in wheat rye and grass  THE church is dedicated to St  Tyssilio  a prince of  Powys  the supporter of the  British  churches against  Austin  the Monk In old times it belonged to the abbey of  Strata Marcella Ystrat Marchell  in this county It is the mother church to  Pool  and  Guildsfield  all which in the th of  Henry  VII the bishop  of St  Asaph  had licence to appropriate to himself  Notitia  on  St Asaph  diocese  MS  The vi∣carage of  Meivod  is now appropriated to  Christchurch Oxford  It is a place of great ecclesiastical antiquity There is reason to suppose that it took its name from its having been in the very early ages of Christianity the residence of a hermit or recluse for  Meudwyfod  implies a hermit's habitation and  Lan  is frequently added to many  Welsh  words to imply them to have been inclosed places such as  Gwinllan  a vineyard  Cor∣lan  a sheepfold  Ydlan  a stackyard so that  Meudwylan  would signify the precinct of the hermit and by the assistance of a  Roman  termination become  Meudwylanium  and that readily more latinized into  Mediolanum  the name we find it bears in the Itinerary  Iter Britanniarum  where it is placed between  Bovium Bangor  and  Rutunium Rowton  We find it again in the Chorography of the  Ravenna  's and in  Ptolemy  Horsely    If those periods are supposed to have been too early for the institution of monastic life in this island I must defend my opinion by that of the learned  Tanner  who reasonably supposes it to have been nearly coeval with Christianity in  Great Britain  Preface    THE  Roman  antiquity rests upon the authority of one of our older writers  Girald Cambr Itin  Dr  Bowel  's note c iv lib ii  who mentions that in his time there were con∣siderable remains of  venerable antiquity  that several founda∣tions floors and causeways have been dug up but whether any coins arms or inscriptions have been met with does not appear  Cambden  also mentions a field called  Erw'r Porth  or  the field of the gate where he concludes might have stood one of the  Portae  or gates  Cambden  ii    To revert to the Christian antiquities  Meivod  is said to have been the archdeaconry of all  Powystand  and that it had two churches besides the present Whether the chapel whose ruins were standing in no very remote period and was called  Eglwys Gwyddfarch  from a  British  saint of this country might not have been one I cannot say the other was named  Eglwys Vair  or the church of the Virgin which was built in  Powel      IN the chief church were interred the princes and great men of  Powys  among whom may be enumerated  Madoc ap Meredydd ap Blyddyn ap Cynvyn  prince of  Powys  who died in at  Winchester  and was conveyed here and the noble  Gryffydd Maelor  lord of  Bromefield  who died in  Powel      THE churchyard of the present is not less than nine acres  CHURCHYARD  and yields to the minister as many pounds as a pasture  NOT far above  Meivod  is an union of two rivers both of the name of  Vyrnyw  both of them diverge considerably from each other and take their rise remote from one another The poeti∣cal topographer  Draiton  therefore very justly styles the river  FORKT  Vurnway  bringing  Tur  and  Tano    growing rank  She plies her towards the  pool  Canto vi    Both are large streams in many places black and deep Soon beyond their junction the ground rises On a steep bank above one of the rivers stood  Mathraval  once the seat of the princes of  Powis  the name at present preserved only by a farmhouse  I could easily trace the site of the antient castle it occupied the space of about two acres One side was guarded by the steep over the river the other three sides by a vast rampart of stone and earth and a very deep foss a high exploratory mount on which perhaps had been a castelet fills one corner from which is a clear view of all that passes up and down the vale  AFTER this place was deserted by its princes the castle was possessed or as Dr  Powel  says built by  Robert de Vepont  a potent baron high in favor with King  John  It is most pro∣bable that he only restored and strengthened it with new works In  Llewelyn ap Jorwerth  laid siege to it but the king coming with a potent army obliged  Llewelyn  to retire and after that caused the castle to be demolished  Hist Wales      IN  Gwern Ddu  a wood opposite to  Mathraval  beyond the river is a circular entrenchment and in a field beyond the other branch is a round mount both which certainly had re∣spect in early times to the fortress at  Mathraval  I must therefore agree with the learned  Burton  's conjecture that this might have been the  Mediolanum  of the  Romans  it having been customary with  British  as well as  Saxon  princes to have their palaces where formerly  Roman  stations had their situation and being  Burton's Com    Let me add also that this might have been the win∣ter station and the low  Meivod  subject to overflowings from the river the summer station  THE country beyond  Mathraval  grows hilly clayey and barren Pass by the church of  Llangyniw  to the left is  Dolar∣ddyn  where  Henry  VII is said to have lodged a night  A FEW miles farther I rid through the village of  Castell Caere∣neon  seated on the  Vyrnyw  A castle was built here in by  Madoc ap Meredydd  prince of  Powys  Powel    I had not leisure to enquire whether there were any remains  THE country for seven miles more continued hilly  CRYGYNNOG  and full of unpleasant commons Reach  Crygynnog  the seat of  Arthur Blainey  Esq  whose hospitality I experienced for two or three days Under his conduct I saw every thing in the neighborhood which merited attention The very worthy owner is descend∣ed from  Brochwel Yschythrog  The elder branch of the family has been ennobled in  Ireland  since the year by the title of Lord  Blainey  of  Monaghan  an honor well earned by Sir  Edward Blainey  Knight by services in  Ireland  in the reigns of Queen  Elizabeth  and her successor  ONE evening I was conducted to  Castell Dolforwyn  CASTELL DOL∣FORWYN  a castle on a high ridge of a hill very steep and almost surrounded by wooded dingle At the bottom runs a small brook which falls into the  Severn  about a mile distant This fortress is very ruinous being built with the small shattery stone of the country and resembles much in its masonry  Castell Dinas Bran  On the two more accessible sides are deep trenches cut through the rock It commands a fine view of the rich vale of  Severn  According to  Dugdale  Monast  ii  it was built by  Dafydd ap Llewelyn  a prince who reigned from to but I prefer the authority of  John Dafydd Rhys  quoted by the re∣verend Mr  Evan Evans  Dissertatio de Bardis    which assures us it was founded by that worthy prince  Bleyddyn ap Cynvyn  between the years  and  Roger de Mortimer  obtained a grant of it together with the castles of  Kedewen  and  Keri  from  Edward  I in to hold to himself and his heirs by the service of three knights fees  Dugdale Baron  i    WHAT is the origin of the name of  Dolforwyn  or the Mea∣dow of the Maiden I cannot with any certainty pronounce but from some legendary tradition of the country I suspect that it has allusion to the story of  Sabra  or  Sabrina  of which our poets have made so beautiful an use  SABRINA HER STORY  She was says  Jeffry  of  Monmouth  daughter of  Locrine  king of  Britain  by  Estrildis  one of the three captive virgins of  matchless  charms which he took after he had defeated  Humber  king of the  Huns  to whom they belonged  Locrine  had divorced his former queen  Guendolen  in her favor On the death of the  British  monarch  Guendolen  assumed the government pursued  Estrildis  and  Sabra  her daughter with unrelenting cruelty and caused them to be drowned in the river which with a slight alteration assumed the name of the innocentvictim  Milton  in his brief and ele∣gant description of our rivers speaks of  The  Severn  swift guilty of maiden's death  But in his incomparable mask of  Comus  he enters fully into her sad story and makes her the goddess of Chastity and calls her from the deep  To undo the charmed band  Of true virgin here distrest  Through the force and through the wile  Of unblest inchanter vile  No reader of taste will I am sure be displeased with me for relating the history of the goddess in the beautiful numbers of our poet  SABRINA is her name a virgin pure  Whilome she was the daughter of  Locrine  That had the scepter from his father  Brute  She guiltless damsel flying the mad pursuit  Of her enraged stepdame  Guendolen  Commended her fair innocence to the flood  That stay'd her flight with his crossflowing course  The waternymphs that in the bottom play'd  Held up their pearled wrists and took her in  Bearing her strait to aged  Nereus'  hall  Who piteous of her woes rear'd her lank head  And gave her to his daughters to imbathe  In nectar'd lavers strow'd with asphodil  And through the porch and inlet of each sense  Dropt in ambrosial oils till she reviv'd  And underwent a quick immortal change  Made Goddess of the river Still she retains  Her maiden gentleness and oft at eve  Visits the herds along the twilight meadows  Helping all urchin blasts and illluck signs  That the shrewd meddling else delights to make  Which she with precious vial'd liquors heals  For which the shepherds at their festivals  Carol her goodness loud in rustic lays  And throw sweet garland wreaths into her stream  Of pansies pinks and gaudy daffadils  And as the old swain said she can unlock  The clasping charm and thaw the numming spell▪  If she be right invok'd in warbled song  For maidenhood she loves and will be swift  To aid a virgin such as was herself  In hard besetting need  NOT far from  Dolforwyn  is  Abervechan  ABERVECHAN  an old house which after being owned by the  Blaineys  the  Prices  and the  Lloyds  is now possessed by Sir  Gervase Clifton  Baronet by virtue of his marriage with the heiress of the place daughter of  Richard Lloyd  Esq  FROM hence we descended into the vale of  Severn  and cross the river on a wooden bridge It is the misfortune of this part of the country to be destitute of several most necessary materials The rich are obliged to burn wood instead of coal and the poor a wretched turf Lime is extremely remote and stone fit for masonry at a vast distance From the head of the  Severn  as low as  Llandreinio  there is not a stone bridge Should it happen in any remote period that timber should fail the better sort of people must probably be reduced to distress for want of fuel and at times one part of the country become inaccessible to the other for want of bridges The moral of this is PLANT and PRESERVE YOUR WOODS  VISIT  Tre' Newydd  NEWTOWN  or  Newtown  a neat small town with a good market on the banks of the  Severn  In a pretty park near to the town is the seat of the  Pryses  The family derives itself from  Elystan Glodrydd  one of the five royal tribes of  Wales  prince of all the country between  Wye  and  Severn  and earl of  Hereford  in right of his mother  Rhiengar  daughter of  Grono ap Tudor Trevor  It became possessed of this place about the time of  Henry  VI  SIR JOHN PRYSE  The late owner Sir  John Pryse  was a gentleman of worth but of strange singularities He married three wives and kept the two first who died in his room one on each side of his bed his third declined the honor of his  hand till her defunct rivals were committed to their proper place  DURING the season of miracles worked by  Bridget Bostock  of  Cheshire  who healed all diseases by prayer faith and an em∣brocation of fastingspittle multitudes resorted to her from all parts and kept her salival glands in full employ Sir  John  with a high spirit of enthusiasm wrote to this wonderful woman to make him a visit at  Newtown Hall  in order to restore to him his third and favorite wife His letter will best tell the foundation on which he built his strange hope and very un∣common request  EURYDICES oro properata retexite fila  Purport of Sir JOHN PRYCE'S Letter to

PRYCE  THE following day our ride was directed towards  Caer Sws  a place of  Roman  antiquity Our way lay over some high grassy lands  ROMAN ROAD  On  Gwyn Vynydd  was easily traced the  Roman  road called  Sarn Swsan  It runs from  Caer Sws  points towards  Meivod  and is distinctly traced as far as the banks of the  Vyr∣nyw  near  Llyssin  I am not able to pursue it either to or from  Meivod  but the late Dr  Worthington  assured me that it was met with in his parish at  Street Vawr  near  Coed y Clawdd  that it crossed  Rhôs y Brithdir  to  Pen y Street  and from thence to  Llamjwrch  to  Caerfach  which is supposed to have been a small  Roman  camp Dr  Worthington  supposed that this road tends to  Chester  NOTWITHSTANDING it is rather out of its place let me speak of another road in the same parish and mentioned to me by the same gentleman This seems to lead from  Rutunium Rowton  in  Shropshire  It crosses the  Tanat  at  Gartheryr  from whence it passes through  Street y Planirau  to  Maengwynedd  and winds up  Bwlch Maen Gwynedd  and retains the name of  Ffordd Gam Elen  or the winding road of  Helen  Dr Worthington  's Letter on his parish addressed to me  Nov  th    To return to  Gwynvynydd  CAER SWS  I observed on the side of the  Roman  road a small suboval camp The road conducts us to  Caer Sws  a hamlet with a few houses on the side of the  Severn  The adjacent fields are divided to this day from each other by lanes which intersect each other as it were to point the very places which had formed the antient streets On the northwest sides are hollows which possibly were part of the fosses of the old precincts Bricks have been found one was presented to me with letters that baffle my guess The figure of them is given for the conjecture of the more profound antiquary  As to coins I have heard of only one being met with and the  owner could not ascertain to me the emperor This station is unnoticed by every  Roman  writer  OPPOSITE to it  RHOS DDIARBED  at some distance from the river is  Rhos Ddiar∣bed  or the common where  no quarter was given  The reason is now lost In an adjacent field is a camp of a very uncommon form At the south is a vast exploratory mount of a conic form surrounded with a foss of a vast depth On the north part of the foss is an oblong area about seventy yards wide in the greatest diameter guarded by a very high rampart and on the outside by a ditch In the lower part is a  porta  open∣ing into a great rectangular camp about two hundred yards long and above one hundred broad Opposite to the other  porta  is a second placed at the extremity but there are no others as usual in  Roman  camps which this certainly was but an eccentric one  prout loci qualitas aut necessitas postulaverat  The whole is encompassed with a rampart and ditch In a field opposite to  Caer Sws  are some trenches perhaps relative to the camp The former I suppose to have been the winter this the summer station  FROM hence I returned into the road On the right opens another vale watered by the  Carno  The mountains of  Carno  like the mountains of  Gilboa  were celebrated for the fall of the mighty  BATTLE OF CARNO  The fiercest battle in our annals happened in amidst these hills when  Gryffydd ap Cynan  supported by  Rhys ap Tudur  prince of  South Wales  disputed the sovereignty of  North Wales  with  Trahaern ap Caradoc  the reigning prince followed by  Caradoc ap Gryffydd  and  Meilir  sons of  Rywallon ap Gwyn  his cousingermains After a most bloody contest vic∣tory declared itself in favor of the first  Trahaern  and his kins∣men  disdaining flight fell on the spot and  Gryffydd ap Cynan  was put into possession of his rightful throne which he filled during fiftyseven years with great dignity  The church of  Carno  belonged to the knights of St  John  of  Jerusalem  CHURCH  who are said to have had a house near it As one part of their business was the protection of their fellowcrea∣tures from violence it is very possible that they might have had a station in these parts which were long filled with a lawless  banditti  IN view is  Park  the residence of  Herbert  Esq  I have been informed that Queen  Elizabeth  kept here a stud of horses Possibly the famous breed of  Spanish  horses introduced into the country by  Robert  earl of  Shrewsbury  Willis's Bangor    might render these parts distinguished for an excellent kind even so late as the reign of that great princess  REACH  Llanddinam  LLANDDINAM  a church prettily seated on a little head∣land jutting into the vale This is a vicarage belonging to the chapter of  Bangor  and the comportions were vested in the dean and chapter in for repairing the cathedral and aug∣menting the vicarages thereof  Girald Itin Cambriae  lib ii c  Opposite to  Llanddinam  on the summit of a high mountain is a  British  post called  Y Caer Vychan  Y CAER VYCHAN  or the Little Fortress surrounded with a number of fosses from one to five according as the strength or weakness of the parts required  MY journey was continued along a most beautiful road The vale grows narrow is bounded by lofty hills whose bot∣toms are in many places skirted with beautiful hanging woods  those of  BerthLwyd  are far the most considerable  BERTHLWYD  The poor remains of the antient house of that name stand in the valley its masters were the old family of the  Llwyds  descended from  Dyngad  second son of  Tudor Trevor Dafydd  seventeenth in descent from  Dungad  first took the name of  Llwyd  and pro∣bably gave the additon of title to the house It continued in the family several generations after and of late years passed by purchase to Sir  Edward Lloyd  Baronet  ABOUT a mile farther is  Llanidlos  LLANIDLOS  a small town with a great market for yarn which is manufactured here into fine flannels and sent weekly by waggonloads to  Welsh Pool  The church is dedicated to St  Idlos  Within are six arches the columns surrounded with neat round pillars ending in capitals of palmleaves The inhabitants assert that they were brought from the abbey of  Cwm Hîr  in  Radnorshire  A date on the roof is which soon followed the period of monastic ruin in this kingdom  THIS is a country of sheepwalks The flocks like those of  Spain  are driven to them from distant parts to feed on the summer herbage The farms in the vallies are only appen∣dages  SLATE  for winter habitations and provisions A coarse slate is found in the neighboring hills but there still remains in ma∣ny parts the antient covering of the country shingles heart of oak split and cut into form of slates This was introduced by the  Saxons  as the word is derived from  Schindel  which signifies the same thing  A LITTLE beyond  Llanidlos  the vale closes The  Severn  here dwindles into an inconsiderable stream By wonderful instinct Salmon force their way from the ocean higher up even than  this distant spot for the sake of depositing their spawn The other fish are Trouts Samlets Graylings and Pike The river runs in a hollow to its source fifteen miles distant in  Plynlimmonis  ardua moles  the vast hill of  Plynlimmon  PLYNLIMMON  I was dissuaded from making it a visit being informed that it was an uninteresting object the base most extensive the top boggy and the view over a dreary and an almost uninhabited country THAT part lay in the county of  Montgomery  and part in  Cardiganshire  and that be∣sides the  Severn  it gave rise to the  Ridal  which flows to the sea near  Aberystwyth  and the  Wye  which precipitating from its fountains down some most romantic rocks continues its course till it falls into the  Severn  below  Chepstow  I was told that the road to it from  Cregynnan  was by  Caer Sws Park  and  Treveglws  and that from the last it is necessary to get a guide to conduct the traveller over the mountains    AFTER a most pleasing ride return to  Cregynnan  with my good host the best shewer of a country I ever had the good fortune of meeting  ON the morning I took leave of  Cregynnan  and attended by Mr  Blainy  skirt the hilly country Our ride was chiefly through narrow lanes Stop to see the church of  Bettws  BETTWS CHURCH  seated in a bottom dedicated to St  Beuno  and formerly be∣longing to the nunnery of  Llanlugan  in this county The steeple makes a figure in these parts It was built by one of its ministers whose figure in priestly vestments carved on a  brass plate is fastened to one of the walls He thus relates his story  orate pro anima  Johannis ap Meredyth  de  Powisia  Quondam vicarius hujus

plentiful wood The great chest is made of a single trunk of oak  A LITTLE further on the top of a hill on the left is a great exploratory mount and I was informed that on the same range is a post called  Pen y Gaer  PEN Y GAER  surrounded by three trenches  FROM a hill called  Cefn Uppol  is a most delightful view of the vale of  Severn  the river and beyond appear the long ex∣tent of  Cerri  hills even on the top  Corndon  hill  Longment  the  Tetterstones  and the rugged mass of  Freiddin  ON the left is the house of  Vaynor  VAYNOR  once the property of the  Prices  but by the marriage of the heiress in the last century to  George Devereux  Esq  was transferred to the Viscounts  Here∣ford  But on the death of  Price Devereux  tenth of that honor was by will alienated to persons foreign to the name and blood  DESCEND into the vale Cross the  Severn  Ride along the road through the midst of a  Roman  camp  ROMAN CAMP  called the  Gaer  seated  in the parish or rather chapelry of  Fordin  It is of the usual rectangular form A little beyond near the house of  Nantcrib∣ba  the seat of Lord Viscount  Hereford  rises a great conoid rock A few years ago on taking away the top were disco∣vered the remains of a little fort  A SMALL FORT  and on paring away the rubbish it appeared to have been square with a round tower probably at each corner one is tolerably entire and is only nine feet diameter within the walls seven feet seven inches thick There had been some small square rooms with door∣cases of good freestone the rest of the building is of rough stone cemented with clay This place was probably ruined by fire for I observed some melted lead mixed with charcoal and several pieces of vitrified stuff There is no history rela∣tive to it It must be very antient for on the top is the stool of a vast oak The base of the rock is surrounded with a ditch cut through it leaving only a narrow pass to the sort At a dis∣tance is another trench  Offa  's ditch lies about two hundred yards from the rock Enter a part of SHROPSHIRE at  Walcot  and keeping southerly soon reach  Chirbury  CHIRBURY  a church and village which give name to the hundred and title to the celebrated flower of chivalry  Edward  Lord  Herbert  in whom madness and abilities kept equal pace This hundred did in old times belong to the castle of  Montgomery  which was then reputed to be in it In the th of  Edward  VI  Chirbury  hun∣dred was given by the crown to  Edward Herbert  and his heirs but  Charles  I in the d year of his reign permitted Sir  Edward Herbert  to alienate it to  William Neye  and  Thomas Gardiner  Esqrs  NEAR this village stood a priory of  Benedictines  PRIORY  founded in the reign of King  John  The church was given to the priory with all the lands along the road side as far as  Merebroc  By a composition between Prior  Philip  and the parson of  Mont∣gomery  the right of burials and christening was reserved to the church of  Chirbury  The same year the Prior had a grant of the tithes of  Montgomery  wood and the mill  Hubert de Burgh  was a benefactor to this house In the prior and convent removed to  Snede  the place of their first constitution and abode it being represented that  Chirbury  was not so proper a place for celebrating divine mysteries but this removal was not to af∣fect the souls of those buried at  Chirbury  to whom they were bound to do the same services as before the removal neither were the religious to lose any of their rights at  Chirbury  Halston MSS    THIS house maintained a prior and five or six monks Its revenues  l    s    d  according to  Dugdale  and  l    s    d  according to  Speed  Tanner  The last prior was  Oliver Middleton  probably of the old family of  Middleton Hall  in this parish who had a pension for life of  l per annum  Willis  ii  Two miles farther is the town of MONTGOMERY A small neat town  MONTGOMERY  partly built on the slope partly on the sum∣mit of a hill beneath the shadow of a much higher It owes its foundation to  Baldwyn  lieutenant of the marches to  William  the Conqueror from whom the  Welsh  called it  Tre Faldwyn  That he also built a castle here or some kind of defence is probable for we are informed that in the year  Roger de  Montgomery  earl of  Shrewsbury  entered  Powisland  and won the town and castle of  Baldwyn  I suppose at that time possessed by the  Welsh Roger  fortified the place and called it after his own name  Montgomery  but in the  Welsh  took the castle put the garrison to the sword and carried destruction through the neighboring parts The king  William Rufus  as∣sembled a vast army and repossessed himself of the low parts of the country The earl of  Shrewsbury  rebuilt the castle which the  Welsh  had destroyed It was again ruined but we are not informed of the period only we are told that  Henry III  built a new castle there in  Powel      Henry  granted it to his great justiciary  Hubert de Burgh  with two hundred marks an∣nually and a greater salary in case of war  Dugdale Baron  i  During the time it was possessed by  Hubert  it was besieged by the  Welsh  but speedily relieved by the  English  Many bloody skirmishes hap∣pened about this time in the neighborhood in one of which was taken by the  Welsh William de Breose  a potent baron who was obliged to pay a considerable sum for his ransom In  Llewelyn  assembled a great army and so terrified  Hubert  that he evacuated the castle which was seised and burnt by the exasperated prince  Powel      ON an inquisition taken on the reversal of the attainder of the famous  Roger Mortimer  earl of  March  in  Dugdale Baron  i  he was found to have been possessed of it at his death and also of the hundred of  Chirbury  in which at that time the castle and manor of  Montgomery  were reputed to lie It continued in the  family at the time of the death of his grandson  Roger  for it formed part of the jointure of his widow  Dugdale Baron  i  and probably re∣mained in his descendant  Edmund  who died without issue  I LEAVE a long interval before I discover any thing more of this place Lord  Herbert  speaks of it as the habitation of some of his ancestors  His Life p  I suppose holding it from the crown as steward of the castle and of the hundred of  Chirbury  IN the civil wars it was seised for the use of the parlement  SIEGE IN  by Sir  Thomas Middleton  in who on the appearance of the king's army was obliged to make a sudden retreat to  Os∣westry  and leave it ill provided both with garrison and pro∣visions The royal forces under Lord  Biron  laid siege to it but Sir  Thomas  being joined by Sir  William Brereton  Sir  John Meldrum  and Sir  William Fairfax  returned under the com∣mand of  Brereton  with about three thousand men to the relief of the place The king's army was five thousand strong who on approach of the enemy took possession of the hill above the castle  BATTLE SEPTEMBER TH  The castle was relieved and a most bloody battle ensued The king's army descended from their post and mak∣ing a most vigorous attack on the forces of the parlement at first gained considerable advantage but the last actuated by despair made the most violent efforts at length obtained a most complete victory The pursuit was continued near twen∣ty miles Above five hundred were slain and fourteen hun∣dred taken prisoners The loss on the side of the parlement only forty slain and about sixty wounded  Drake's Parl Hist  xiii  Whitelock    The castle met  with the fate of all others being dismantled by order of the commons  THE remains impend over the town  CASTLE DE∣SCRIBED  They stand on a pro∣jecting ridge of a great height and steepness and towards the end quite precipitous The reliques of this fortress are very small It had been divided by four fosses cut in the rock each perhaps had its drawbridge Between the end of the buildings and the precipice is a level spot the yard or parade of the place  AT the bottom of the hill in the vale is a small fortification of the same kind with those used by the  Saxons  and by the  Welsh  also having in it a high mount  ON a hill  BRITISH POST  not far from the castle is a stupendous  British  post The approach is guarded by four great ditches with two or three entrances towards the main work where two or three fosses run across the hill the end of which is sufficiently guard∣ed by the steepness  THIS and the preceding pieces of military antiquity shew the importance of this place in early times the first was pro∣bably in being when  Baldwyn  made himself master of this country notwithstanding the original name has totally pe∣rished  FROM the summit of the  British  post is a fine view of the vale of  Montgomery  which is very extensive and bounded by the hills of

earl of  Powys  placed on the ridge of a rock having scarcely any area which in common with most mansions sprung from castellated origin are far from desireable situations This retains a mixture of castle and mansion You enter between two rounders there are also remains of round towers in other parts Near the castle is a long gallery a hundred and seventeen feet by twenty It was once a hundred and sixtyseven feet but an apartment has been taken out of one end This is of a later date than the other building and was detached from it by a fire about fifty years ago  IN the parlour within the

their long lapse to herefy The po∣litic pope saw the folly of the design and never received the embassador without being seized with a most seasonable fit of coughing which always interrupted the subject of his errand At length wearied with delay he was advised to take pet and  threaten to leave  Rome  His holiness with great  sang froid  told him that since such was his resolution he

in imitation of the wretched taste of St  Ger∣mains en Laye  which the late family had a most unfortunate opportunity of copying  THE first notice I find of this place is about the year when the renowned  Briton Cadwgan ap Bleddyn ap Cynvyn  sought here an asylum from the persecution of his kindred and began a castle At that time it was called  Y Trellawng  While he was intent on the business his nephew  Madoc  came on him unawares and slew him  Powel    The building was continued perhaps by  Gwenwynwyn  SIEGES IN  for in it was besieged by  Hubert  archbishop of  Canterbury  who met at first with a most vigorous resistance At length the prelate sent for a company of miners and proceeded so successfully that the besiegers seeing the walls undermined and the enemy three to one surrendered on the most honorable terms The archbishop fortified it more  strongly and placed a strong garrison in it but soon after  Gwenwynwyn  attacked it in his turn and had the good fortune to reduce it on the very terms which his own garrison had re∣ceived At this time it was called the castle of  Gwenwynwyn at the Pool  Powel      HIS son  Gryffydd  probably took part with the  English  SUCCESSION  for in  Llewelyn ap Jorwerth  overthrew this fortress which now assumed the name of  Castell Coch  or  Red Castle  from the color of the stones  The same    HIS grandson  Owen ap Gryffydd ap Gwenwynwyn  remained in possession of the place He left a daughter called  Hawys Gadarn  or  Hawys the hardy  Four of her uncles  The same  disputed her title to her father's land alleging that a female was incapable of inheriting  Hawys  wisely made a friend of  Edward  II who married her to  John de Charlton  born near  Wellington  in  Shrop∣shire  in and styled  Valectus Domini Regis  The same  It continued in their posterity several generations The barony and title were afterwards conveyed to Sir  John Grey  of  Northumberland  by his marriage with  Jane  eldest daughter of  Edward  Lord  Powys  Dugdale Baron  ii  It remained in their descendants till the reign of  Henry  VIII the title became then extinct by the death of  Edward Grey  I cannot trace the succession of the estate till I find it in pos∣session of Sir  William Herbert  second son of the earl of  Pem∣broke  who got it by purchase in the reign of Queen  Elizabeth  He was created Lord  Powys  and was ancestor to

stand in a pretty situation on a bank above the  Vyrnyw  and very advantageous for trade It lies at the opening of three val∣lies at the intersection of two great public roads and on a river navigable

with red and streaked with white and capable of a good polish This is the limestone of the place  GREAT LIME∣WORKS  The quantity burnt on this hill is inconceivable and the increase is ten times greater since the improvement of the  Montgomeryshire  roads for it is carried even for manure thirty miles into that county The season of carriage begins in  March  and ends in  October  The hill is of a considerable length and breadth slopes upwards from the side next to the village and on the upper part ends in a vast and long precipice Its bowels are probably replete with minerals  MINERALS  Copper lead ore and calamine have been found there of late years but there are undeniable proofs of its having been worked by the  Romans  WORKED BY THE ROMANS  In a great artificial cave formed into several mean∣ders in search of the ores have been discovered  Roman  coins among them an  Antoninus  and a  Faustina  Near the coins were found the skeleton of a man at full length on his left arm a bracelet and by his side a battleax Burnt bones and ashes are often found on the hill and near the northwest part of the precipice are numbers of large pits in form of inverted cones supposed to have been the work of the  Romans  ON the slope of the hill  ANTIENT DIKES AND FOSSES  in the more accessible part runs from top to bottom a stupendous rampart of loose stones with a foss at the foot of it and at certain distances beyond are two other parallel fosses in many places cut through the rock with vast labor It has been thought that the  Romans  were the peo∣ple who made these works but I rather think them to have been  British  as they are so similar to those which constitute the strength of the  British  post  Offa  's dike may be traced on this hill but is plainly different from the others The wall of the churchyard is placed on the former  FROM the summit of the hill is a most delightful view one way of the vast flat of  Shropshire  with its various rising boun∣daries The  Freiddin  hills form a noble group opposite to this  eminence which together rise most magnificently like two great capes at the entrance into the vale of  Severn  which from hence to  Llanidlos  is

to whose labors I am so much indebted He was a younger brother of the house of  Halston  see vol i page of this Tour He was designed for the church but by reason of certain political scruples declined the pursuit of the profession He then to∣tally gave himself up to the study of antiquity chiefly that of his own coun∣ty consulted all the records he could get access to and with vast pains and accuracy formed the volume I refer to But his designs extended to the giving a most complete history of  Shropshire  for which purpose he had made immense collections which he left behind undigested besides a numerous and elegant collection of drawings of monuments c done by an artist he kept for that purpose Death prevented the execution of his plans He died on the th of  September  aged at

almost a direct line from this place but I preferred following the course of the river tempt∣ed by the extreme beauty of the ride I crossed  Montford  bridge turned to the right and went over the  Perry  not far above its junction with the  Severn  MITTON  The hamlet of  Mitton  i e  Middle Town  lies in the midst of the narrow neck of land be∣tween the two rivers The  Severn  here makes a great bend and forms on the opposite side a peninsula with so very nar∣row an  isthmus  as to occasion it to be called  the Isle  of  Up Rossal  THE ISLE  being encompassed by the river for the space of five miles except at the entrance which forms a neck of only three hundred and eighty yards in breadth The isle is a most compact estate of  Humphrey Sandford  Esq  and lies in the parish of  St Chad  This place formerly belonged to Sir  Francis Englefield  Knight a gentleman zealous for the old religion at the time of the Reformation and a principal officer about the person of the Princess  Mary  afterwards queen At the ac∣cession of  Edward  VI he was sent for with others of her hous∣hold by the Protector and council to forbid them hearing of mass in the princess's house They refused obedience and in consequence were imprisoned for several months On the ac∣cession of  Mary  he received the strongest proofs of her grati∣tude for his fidelity In the very first year of the following reign he quitted the kingdom with many other zealots and was indefatigable in promoting the interests of  Mary  queen of  Scots  He was attainted in the year and all his estates confiscated but some legal difficulties arising in a new act was passed which fully confirmed the former  Ruffhead  's Statutes at Large ii  Sir  Francis  died in at  Valladolid  and his body was interred there in the  English  college This estate of his was granted by Queen  Elizabeth  to  Richard Sandford  Esq  an officer of the crown and ancestor to the present owner a family long before possessed of other estates in the neighborhood  FITTES  FITTES  the parish church of  Mitton  is seated at a small distance on an eminence with a large exploratory mount not remote from it From a field not far from the churchyard is a most beautiful view of the  Severn  which lies far beneath at the foot of the steep banks clothed with hanging woods or darkened with yews of enormous size The river is seen winding round the isle and the isle itself a tract of rich land mixed with trees slopes gracefully to the margin of the water A long and nar∣row wooded island diversifies the view by dividing the river into two channels which reunite and run under  Leighton  shelf a high cliff which forms a noble finishing on that part Above the foreground of this rich prospect are numberless mountains of different forms all together forming the finest view this country can boast  IN the course of my ride pass by the upper and lower  Berwick  one the seat of  Betton  Esq  the other of  Thomas Powis  Esq  both commanding most delicious views of the river and town of SHREWSBURY They are both in the parish of  St Mary Shrewsbury  SHREWSBURY  My entrance into the town was through the  North Gate  which  for greater security in reality consists of two gates at a small distance from one another with a round tower on each side  THE castle stands on an eminence on the left  CASTLE  Only one part with two rounders remain and the walls of the north and east∣ern sides The keep was on a large artificial mount which shews this fortress to have been of  Saxon  or  British  origin not∣withstanding the foundation is ascribed to the great earl of  Shrewsbury Roger de Montgomery  The inside is cleared from buildings excepting one house The whole castleyard is a garden and the mount is at present admirable only for its beau∣tiful view  THE town of  Shrewsbury  is seated within a peninsula with the ground finely sloping in most parts to the river The castle was judiciously placed on a narrow  isthmus  two hundred yards wide which connects it to the main land  Roger de Montgome∣ry  FOUNDED BY ROGER DE MONT∣GOMERY  on whom almost the whole county was bestowed by the Conqueror besides a hundred and fiftyeight manors in other parts of the kingdom made this his principal seat In order to extend his fortifications he demolished fortyone houses for this part of the town at that period was very populous These houses paid taxes yet no remittance was made to the owners notwithstanding the greatness of their loss The first constable was  Warine the Bald  a man of small stature but great courage This place continued in the possession of the two sons of  Roger de Montgomery Hugh  who was slain in  Anglesey  and that mon∣ster of cruelty  See Dugdale Baron  i  Robert  surnamed  de Belesme  who after various struggles was at length obliged to surrender this place his  honors and all his mighty possessions into the hands of his sovereign  Henry  I As soon as it became a royal fortress the lands and demesnes which followed it were parceled out into serjeanties for its defence Thus  Robert  the son of  Adam de Leyton  was obliged by his tenure to continue in this castle fifteen days  cum una balista  with one crossbow and  William de Wichard  held the manor of  Cold Hatton  to keep ward in this castle at his own expence twenty days in time of war  cum uno equo lorica capello ferreo et lancea  The constables were usu∣ally men of the first note and very often it was committed to the care of the sheriff of the county After it had been dis∣mantled in the civil wars it was granted by  Charles  II to  Francis  lord viscount  Newport  afterwards earl of  Bradford  In our times it got into the hands of  Pulteney  earl of  Bath  and is now in those of  William Pulteney  Esq  THE first attempt towards the walls of this town  WALLS  was made by  Robert de Belesme  who to defend it against the king's forces then marching against him drew a wall from each side of the castle across the isthmus to the waterside One is still remaining and as I have been informed terminated with a square tower both these walls are preserved in  Speed  's plan of the place The town was not defended by walls till the year when  Henry  III strongly urged the inhabitants to con∣sider of some means of defence against an enemy At first he made them a grant of various small tolls but at length find∣ing those insufficient was obliged to assist them but the work went on so slowly that they were not completed in less than thirtytwo years The town was paved in the next reign by the assistance of certain customs granted for that purpose  IN almost every part the original walls were at a distance from the river Those on the southeast side of the town are kept in good repair and form pleasant but interrupted walks by reason of flights of steps Those on the northwest side are entirely covered with houses Beneath them is a narrow field extending from the School to the  Welsh Bridge  along the verge of which close to the river in  ROWSHILL WALL  was built another wall called  Rowshill  wall the materials of which are said to have been brought from  Shrawardine  castle  THERE are many historical evidences of the antiquity of the town  TOWN  It had been for many ages the capital of  Powisland  and the seat of the princes  Brochmail Yscithroc  who lived about the year is said to have had his palace on the spot where St  Chad  's church now stands  Powel    The  Welsh  called it  PenGwern  or the Head of the Aldergroves and  Ymwithig  or the  Delight  I suppose of our princes The period in which the town arose is not certainly known but it is supposed to have been on the ruin of the  Roman Uriconium  the  Vreken Ceaster  of the  Saxons  and the modern  Wroxeter  a small village about four miles from hence upon the  Severn  where may be still seen a large fragment of the antient wall  IN the time of  Edward  the Confessor  IN SAXON TIMES  Scrobbes Byrig  as the  Saxons  called it was a considerable place At that period there were two hundred and fiftytwo houses and the burgesses paid yearly  l    s    d  in excise Whenever the king lay in the town twelve of the chief inhabitants kept watch about his per∣son and if he came there to hunt the better sort of burgesses  who kept horses rode armed as his guard and the sheriff sent thirtysix footmen for their support while the king was resident among them When the king left the town the sheriff sent twentyfour horses to  Lenteurde  to conduct him to the first stage in  Staffordshire  WHEN the sheriff went against the  Welsh  which he had fre∣quent occasion of doing it was customary to summon thirtysix men at  Marseteley  park to give their service for eight days Those who neglected to go forfeited forty shillings  THE king had here three masters of the mint who like the other coiners of the county were obliged to pay him twenty shillings at the end of fifteen days while the money was out of the mint and while it was current The town paid in all twenty pounds yearly the king had twothirds the sheriff one As soon as the  Norman  reign commenced it paid to its new earl forty pounds  THE first charter extant for that of  Henry  I is lost was one in  CHARTERS  from  Richard  I It confirms all its antient customs and privileges for which the town was to pay forty marks in silver including ten for the purpose of providing a brace of hunters for the royal personage It likewise grants to the burgesses the town and all its appurtenances which had been seized by  Henry  I on the forfeiture of Earl  Robert  King  John  in enlarged their charter permitting the citizens to elect two substantial discreet persons of their body as bailiffs for the government of the town and that the commoncouncil might chuse four others to determine all pleas of the crown in the corporation and to be a check on the bailiffs themselves Various other charters with additional privileges were granted by succeeding princes  till Queen  Elizabeth  made it a body corporate and  Charles  I confirmed and enlarged her royal charter It now consists of a mayor twentyfour aldermen and fortyeight assistants who are called the commoncouncil They have also a recorder two chamberlains annually chosen by the mayor aldermen and assistants a steward a swordbearer and three serjeants at mace  THIS town sent members from the beginning The right of voting rests in burgesses living in the town and paying to church and poor according to a resolution of the house in but in it was resolved that foreign burgesses had a right to vote  THERE is in this town no manufacture considerable enough to merit mention but it draws very great profit from those of  Montgomeryshire  This place is the chief mart for them About yards of  Welsh  webs a coarse kind of woollen cloth are brought here annually to the  Thursday  market and bought up and dressed that is the wool is raised on one side by a set of people called  Shearmen  At this time only forty are em∣ployed but in the time of Queen  Elizabeth  the trade was so great that not fewer than six hundred  Anderson's Dict  i  maintained themselves by this occupation The cloth is sent chiefly to  America  to clothe the Negroes or to  Flanders  where it is used by the pea∣sants  FLANNELS both coarse and fine are brought every other  Monday  except when fairs intervene to  Welsh Pool  and are chiefly consumed in  England  to the amount of about or  yards The  Shrewsbury  drapers go every market to  Welsh Pool  for the sake of this commerce  THE disposition of the streets in  Shrewsbury  is extremely irre∣gular  STREETS  as is the case with all antient towns not of  Roman  origin Many of the buildings are old but the modern buildings are in general scattered in various places  THE freeschool stands near the castle in a broad handsome street  FREESCHOOL  It was founded by  Edward  VI in who endowed it with tithes at that time amounting to  l    s  and empower∣ed the bailiffs burgesses and their successors to appoint one schoolmaster and one underschoolmaster and with the con∣sent of the bishop of  Lichfield  to frame statutes for its govern∣ment Queen  Elizabeth  added considerably to the endowments so that at present the revenues are very large The build∣ing was originally of wood but in a beautiful and ex∣tensive edifice of stone arose in its place which contains the school houses for the masters and a library filled with a va∣luable collection of books and several curiosities among them are three large sepulchral stones discovered by ploughing at  Wroxeter  The first has on its summit a pinecone between two lions and beneath the pediment a rose The first is taken from the  Picea  what  Pliny  calls  Feralis Arbor  Picea  Feralis Arbor et funebri indicio ad fores posita ac rogis virens  Hist Nat  lib xvi c  expressive of the me∣lancholy subject and not infrequent on memorials of this kind Such was the great brass cone five yards high which stood on the top of the mausoleum of  Adrian  now the tower of St  Angelo  and is still preserved in the garden of the  Belvedere  Flaminius Vacca  in  Montfaucon's travels Engl  ed  Wright's travels  i  The in∣scription denotes the death of C MANNIVS SECUNDUS of the town of  Pollentia  a  Beneficiarius  or veteran in the xxth legion who had served his time and was called again into service by the entreaties of a chief legate  THE second stone has on the upper part a human face two dolphins and two serpents Beneath are three pannels In the first is commemorated by her husband  Placida  aged fiftyfive and thirty years his wife In the next is an inscription to  Deuccus  a boy fifteen years old son to the same person  Cur agente patre  The third pannel is a blank so it is probable as was hinted to me by a most ingenious friend that the man who had erected this monument designed to have been buried in the same place with his wife and son but dying elsewhere this pannel remains unfilled  The third stone is inscribed to  M Petronius  signifer or standardbearer to the  Legio quatuor decima gemina  or the four∣teenth double legion or a legion in which two had been formed into one As this legion never was in  Britain  the learned Dr  Ward  See his account of these three stones in the  Ph Tr  xlix part i  guesses that  Petronius  only came for his health and died here  A PRETTY wooden model of a hypocaust discovered at the same place with the stones is also preserved here  THE public buildings of this town are not of note sufficient to be mentioned  PUBLIC BUILD∣INGS  Among the hotels of the great men of past time  Charlton  house now the theatre was the residence of  the  Charltons  lords of  Powys  This was probably founded by  John de Charlton  in when he fortified it by the permission of  Edward  II  Philips    Vaughan Place  is another antient house the property of  John Mytton  of  Halston  Esq  derived from the mar∣riage of his ancestor  Reginald Mytton  about the year with  Elinor  sole heiress  Haymon  son of Sir  Thomas Vaughan  Mytton Pedigree  of this town  The infirmary was  INFIRMARY  within my memory a private house It was opened on  April  th Since that time to  June  th have been admitted  inpatients of which were cured relieved  outpatients of which were cured relieved  The annual subscription of the last year amounted to £  Two bridges connect this peninsula with the country  WELSH BRIDGE  The  Welsh Bridge  is a very antient structure of six arches with a very handsome embattled gateway at one end On each side is a round tower and over the entrance a statue of a prince in armour ge∣nerally supposed to be intended for  Richard  duke of  York  for beneath his feet is a rosesprig a device usual on the seals of that great prince  Sandford's General  p tab  This probably was a favorite town of the  Plantagenets  for  Elizabeth  queen to  Edward  IV found an asylum here during her husband's contests for the crown and here was delivered of her second son  Richard  duke of  York  and her third  George  duke of  Bedford  The same pp  This was not the original site of the statue it having been fixed here after it had been removed from another place in  Philips    At the  Welsh  end of the  bridge formerly stood another tower of great strength calculated to repel the inroads of my countrymen  ON an eminence above  Frankwel  MILLINGTON'S HOSPITAL  a suburb beyond the bridge stands  Millington  's hospital a handsome brick building founded in by the will of Mr  James Millington  of this town  Drapier  It maintains twelve poor housekeepers of  Frankwel  single persons and a charityschool for twenty boys and twenty girls of the same district if to be found there and if not to be taken out of the nearest part of the parish of St  Chad  there to be instructed and fitted for trades suitable to their stations to have prayers constantly read morning and evening on schooldays for which the chaplain is to have twenty pounds a year and finally they are to be decently cloathed twice a year The poor housekeepers are to receive  l    s  a year apiece a load of coal and a new coat or gown annually These poor people are to be on vacancy elected out of ten others properly qualified who till their election are to receive likewise annually a new coat or gown apiece Mr  Millington  besides founded in  Magdalen  college  Cambridge  two exhibitions of forty pounds a year for two scholars to be elect∣ed from his grammarschool and when in orders one of them is to be elected chaplain of the school in the room of the cler∣gyman who happens not to be so qualified and who must in that case resign The founder was a true churchman for all dis∣senters and all persons not truly orthodox are to be excluded  THE new bridge is on the side of the town  NEW BRIDGE  and is a very handsome building of seven arches It was begun in and built by subscription under the direction of Mr  Gwyn  architect a native of  Shrewsbury  This succeeded a very an∣tient  and incommodious narrow bridge with the usual obstruc∣tion a gateway It consisted in the time of  Leland  of four arches besides the drawbridge  Leland Itin  iv  It formerly was called the East bridge and the Stone bridge  NOT far from hence  ABBEY  on the side of the river stood the great mitred abbey of St  Peter  and St  Paul  founded in by  Roger  earl of  Shrewsbury  and his countess Adelissa It was built on the site of a timber church erected by  Siward  who exchanged it and probably the ground about it with the earl for the village of  Langafielda  which  Siward  at his death bequeathed to the new foundation It was peopled with  Benedictine  monks from  Seez  in  Normandy  who arrived hungry and naked  Roger  himself with the permission of his lady was shorn and became a monk of his own abbey and enriched it with the coat of St  Hugh  of the monastery of  Cluni  which he sometimes wore himself as a most precious relique He endowed the house largely and encouraged every body who held under him to do the same Among the after endowments I smile at these good men receiving from earl  Hugh  the tithe of all the venison in  Shropshire  except such which ranged in the woods of  Wenlock  The founder died in and was interred here as was his son  Hugh  slain in  Anglesey Fulcheredus  a man of great elo∣quence was first abbot  Robert  the fourth abbot whom Mr  William Mytton  names  Pennant  procured with infinite difficulty and as I have in p related enriched the abbey with the re∣liques of St  Wenefrede  and enshrined them much to the emo∣lument of his house  William Beauchamp  earl of  Warwick  by will dated  August  ordered  foure images of gold  everich of them of the weight of twenty pounds of gold to be made after my similitude with myn arms holding an ancre between his hands  to be presented to the shrines of four different churches one of which was to be that of St  Wenefrede  in  Shrewsbury  Hearze's Collections  The Earl's Will  I have in vol i p of my Tour given an account of the fraternity established here in honor of the saint about the year  Thomas Butler  was last abbot At the dissolution Dr  Lee  and Master  Henly  were sent down They convened the abbot and monks to the chapterhouse caused some deeds to be signed with the common seal of the house then ordered an officer to break it and declared the convent to be dissolved  Mr W Mytton  Butler  was allowed a pension of eighty pounds a year and lesser sums to the monks  Willis  i  The revenues at the dissolution are reckoned by  Dugdale  at only  l    s    d Speed  with more probability says they were  l    s    d  The site was granted by  Henry  VIII to  Edward Watson  and  Henry Herdson  Tanner    Queen  Elizabeth  made the church parochial This church was called  St Crux  or the  Holy Cross  in the abbey of  Shrewsbury  and still retains the name  IN so great a length of time the church underwent great alte∣rations Some of the round arches are to be seen within and some of the doors are of the same species of architecture most of the other parts are more modern The west window is an elegant piece of sharppointed Gothic and above is a statue The tomb of the founder is preserved in the church on which is represented his figure in mail and a mantle and in the at∣titude of drawing his sword  IN the garden is a most beautiful stone pulpit open on all sides I refer the reader to the print as the best description  THE  Grey Friers  FRANCISCANS  or  Franciscans  had a house a little to the south of the new bridge not far from the townwalls It was founded on the motion  Hawyse  daughter of  Owen ap Gryffydd  prince of  Powys  and wife to  John Charleton  lord of  Powys  Leland Itin  Charleton  died in the year  Hawyse  before him and was interred in this convent At the dissolution it was granted to  Richard Andrews  and  Nicholas Temple  The remains are fi  ed up into a private house  A LITTLE farther is that beautiful walk the  Quarry  border∣ing on the river and planted with rows of trees It is the property of the corporation and the pasturage part let to the inhabitants and the profits distributed to the burgesses In this ground was set to three persons for ten years for the annual acknowlegement of a red rose on condition they brought water in leaden pipes as high as it would run for the use of the town from  Brodwel  near  Crow Meole  which was effected in  ON a lofty bank  ORPHANHOUSE  opposite to these walks is seated the Orphanhouse a fine brick building with thirteen windows in front and two small wings It was begun in and designed to receive part of the foundlings from the great hospital in  London  They were first to have been put out to nurse in the neighborhood and at a proper age to have been brought into the house and under proper masters and mistresses to be taught such arts as would make them useful members of society On the decline of the capital hospital this great building became useless and is at present no more than a place of confinement for prisoners of war  BEYOND the quarry  AUGUSTINES  close to the river stood the house of  Augustine  friers  Leland  Itin  iv  says it was founded by one of the  Staffords  and that several persons of note slain in the battle of  Shrewsbury  were interred here and in the church of the  Black  friers The friers of this house lay under a very bad fame it is even said that a neighboring lane took its name from their noc∣turnal amours Dr  Powel  seems to think that the celebrated  Incubi  were nothing more than mendicant friers who might encourage the notion in order to remove scandal from them∣selves and their religious paramours  Hi  says the zealous an∣notator  Incubi daemones ita religiosas virgines illis diebus opprime∣bant ut nulla eos crucis signatio nec aqua benedicta nec ipsum cor∣poris  CHRISTI  sacramentum abigere valeret  Girald Camb Itin  lib ii c    The house of the  Black  friers or  Dominicans  DOMINICANS  stood near St  Mary  's  Water Lane  It is said that  Richard  a burgess of this town by the king's licence built them a church in but the foundation of the friery is ascribed to  Maud  Lady  Genevil  wife of  Jeffry  Lord  Genevil  who lived in the reigns of  Henry  III and  Edward  I They had confirmation of what they held here from  Edward  III and likewise were permitted to make an aqueduct in the ground belonging to their house  MOST of the parochial churches are of great antiquity  CHURCHES  That of St  Chad  was probably founded by the  Saxons  soon after the expulsion of the  Welsh  At the Conquest it was found to be col∣legiate and to have a dean and ten prebendaries In the old church was burnt down by the carelesseness of a workman The fellow seeing the mischief he had done ran home put some  money in his pocket and attempting to escape was drowned in fording the river near the stone bridge In this church is the monument of  Richard Onslow  and his wife with their figures recumbent he dressed in a bonnet and gown This gentle∣man was of the law was twice member for  Steyning  in  Sussex  and was ancestor to the honorable  Arthur Onslow  speaker of the house of commons and the present Lord  Onslow  The former in paid such respect to his memory as to cause this me∣morial of him to be repaired  Richard Onslow  died of a pesti∣lential fever in  ST MARY'S and St  Alcmund  's are remarkable for their hand∣some spire steeples The first is said to have been founded by King  Edgar  Philips    the last by the heroine  Elfleda  Tanner    each of them had been collegiate But the church which is said to be the most antient is that of St  Giles  ST GILES  seated at the skirt of the sub∣urbs beyond the abbey It is small and only remarkable for the vast size of one side of the roof It had the honor of receiving the bones of St  Wenefrede  before they were deposited in the shrine in the abbey It is called in Doomsday book the parish of the city  Philips    which gives it stronger clame to antiquity than any of the others It is now annexed to the church of the Holy Cross or the abbey  AMONG the more remarkable civil transactions may be rec∣koned the parlements held in this town The first was sum∣moned formally by writ By the first the lords to appear on  September  th the second writ directed the commonal∣ty of every county to chuse two knights the third to the  cities and boroughs the fourth to the judges At this august assembly was tried and condemned  David  brother to  Llewelyn  last prince of  Wales  his perfidy to  Edward  and his treasons to his country before his reconciliation with his brother ren∣dered him an object of detestation Eleven earls and an hun∣dred barons were commissioned to try him  Drake's Parl Hist  i  as a subject of  England  for he had received from  Edward  a barony and a considerable pension He was the first who suffered the death of a traitor in the form of the sentence now in use which he underwent in its fullest extent  ANOTHER parlement was held here in it was called the  Great Parlement  on account of the number of people assem∣bled in it Here the unfortunate  Richard  by this obsequious senate obtained a stretch of power unknown before and by a strange concession obtained that the whole power of the nation should devolve on the king twelve peers and six commoners The Pope's bull was thought necessary to confirm so irregular a proceeding  Rapin  i    THE military transactions relative to this place were nume∣rous but so brief and so rapid that I shun mention of all except three  BATTLE OF SHREWSBURY  The first was the important battle on St  Magda∣lene  's eve  July  d which is best known by the name of that of  Shrewsbury  between  Henry  IV and the brave  Henry Percy  surnamed  Hotspur  It was the design of the northern insurgents to make themselves masters of this town and here to strengthen their forces by a junction with the great  Glyndwr  and his countrymen They made rapid marches through  Lich∣field  and  Stafford  but the active  Henry  stimulated by the advice of the earl of  Dunbar  a  Scotch  nobleman then in his army ad∣vanced with a speed which saved his crown and proved the destruction of his enemies He flung himself into  Shrewsbury  as some assert  Sto      at the instant that the insurgents were going to scale the walls He immediately quitted the town and en∣camped before the gates The high spirit of  Percy  would not suffer him to wait till the arrival of  Glyndwr  who was no farther dis∣tant than  Oswestry  so that only four thousand of the  Welsh  were able to join the northern forces  Percy  sent that night  Thomas Kaiton  and  Thomas Salvaigne  two of his esquires with a most reproachful manifesto concluding in the romantic manner of the times with hurling defiance in his teeth  WE defy thee  DEFIANCE  thy fautoures and compliers as common traytours and de∣stroyers of the realme and the invadours oppressours and confounders of the verie true and right heyres to the crowne of  Englande  which thing we entende with our handes to prove this daie Almyghty GOD helpyng us  Halle  fol xxii  THE fight began early in the morning and very near to the town for the spirited  Percy  had made his advances much sooner and nearer than the king expected The onset was made in  Oldfield  or  Bulfield  at a small distance beyond a little brook north of the northgate and the battle raged towards  Berwick  Carte  ii  and as far as what is now called  Battlefield  Let the old historians paint the conflict in their plain but animated language  THE kyng perceivyng that the battayll was nerer than he  either thoughte or loked for leaste that

Welshemen  also whiche sithe the kynges departure out of  Wales  had lurked and lien in wooddes mountaignes and marshes heringe of this battayl towarde came to the aide of the earles and refreshed the wery people with new suc∣cours When a fearful messenger had declared to the kynge that his people were beaten doune on every side it was no nede to bid him stirre for sodaynly he approched with his freshe battaill and comforted hartened and encouraged his part so that they toke their hartes to theim and manly fought with their enemies The Prince  Henry  that daie holpe muche his father for

battaill continued thre longe houres with indifferent fortune on bothe partes That at last the kyng crying SAINCT GEORGE VICTORY brake the arraie and entered into the battaill of his enemies and

frely and frankely delivered On the kynges part were slain xvi c persones and above v thousand on the other and as to the  Scottes  few or none escaped alive  Halle  fol xxii    THE body of gallant  Percy  was found among the slain and delivered to  Thomas Nevil  Lord  Furnival  to be interred but the next day the king ungenerously ordered it to be taken up placed between two millstones in  Shrewsbury  and guarded by armed men after which he caused it to be beheaded and quar∣tered and hung in different parts of the kingdom  Stew    HENRY after slaughtering five thousand people in his bad cause most piously returned thanks to the Giver of all victo∣ries  BATTLEFIELD CHURCH  and erected or permitted to be erected on the spot pro∣bably stained with most blood the collegiate church of  Battle∣field  in the parish of  Albrighton  about three miles from  Shrews∣bury  The royal licence permits  Roger Ive  rector of the chapel of  AlbrightHusee  to erect on a piece of ground he had obtained from  Richard Husee  a chapel to be dedicated to St  Mary Mag∣dalene  of which the said  Ives  and his heirs were to be master There was also to be five chaplains who were to pray for the good state of the king while he lived and after death for his soul and those of  Richard Husee  and  Isolda  his wife and those of their heirs and finally for the souls of all that fell in battle on that fatal spot  Dugdale Monast  iii pars ii  Its clear revenues at the dissolution were  l    s    d  Tanner      THE church had been a small but handsome building of stone with a tower steeple The west part is unroofed but the chancel is neatly fitted up and serves as a chapel to the parish of  Albrighton  Over the outside of the east window is the statue of  Henry  IV armed and crowned In the windows is some painted glass with several arms chiefly of the  Corbets  to  whom the place belongs among them are those of  Richard Corbet  who died bishop of  Norwich  in It appears by the arms of the see of  Oxford  joined with his own that he enjoyed that see when they were painted He was a celebrated poet  Two editions of his poems were published after his death See his Life in the  British Biography  ii  as well as an eloquent preacher which recommended him so greatly to  James  I that he made him one of his chaplains and in bestowed on him the deanery of  Christchurch  IN  August  the town made some shew of resisting the pas∣sage of the earl of  Richmond  EARL OF RICH∣MOND'S PASSAGE THROUGH IN  afterwards  Henry  VII in his way to meet  Richard  III and give him battle My authority

for above sixty years after infested this kingdom at different periods In many places it swept away  a third of the people It begun with a sweat which never left the patient till it destroyed him or rill he recovered It had many of the symptoms of the plague restlessness anxiety sick∣ness ravings drowsiness faintness palpitations but it never was attended with eruptive spots buboes or carbuncles attend∣ant on the other scourge of heaven It always began with the affection of one part the sense of a hot vapor running through the whole limb The crisis never exceeded twentyfour hours Dr  Caius  on that account calls it  Ephemera Britannica  but oftener death ensued in three or ten There were places in which scarce one in a hundred escaped infection Towards the latter end of the visitation the malignancy abated for in out of forty thousand who were seized in  London  only two thousand died The patient was to wait the event just as he happened to be seized whether in bed or in his cloaths It is a mistake to suppose as many have done that it was a disease peculiar to  England  and that  Englishmen  only let them have been where they would were seized with it It certainly origi∣nated neither in  England  nor among  Englishmen  but among the foreign levies of the duke of  Richmond  raked out of hospitals and jails and buried in filth and crowded on board the transports so as naturally to generate a distemper among sub∣jects so admirably predisposed  See the ingenious and pleasing Biographical Memoirs of Medicine in  Great Britain  by Mr  John Aikin  of  Warrington  p to  Let me add that it ended in this town in but not with that mildness as was observed in the later visitations in other places for not fewer than nine hundred and ninety died in a few days  The same    IN the civil wars of the last century  Shrewsbury  was garrisoned by the king  TOWN TAKEN IN BY GENERAL MYTTON  many of the works greatly strenthened and a strong sort erected above  Frankwell  to prevent the town being commanded from the adjacent heights Sir  Michael Earnly  was left governor and Captain  Crowe  lieutenant of the castle Ge∣neral  Mytton  who lay with a small garrison at  Wem  and was re∣presentative for this town determined to surprise it He made two unsuccessful attempts but on  February  st with such forces as he could collect he renewed his enterprize He sent the foot along the  Severn  side and by the help of some carpenters who cut down the palisades between the castle and the river formed an entrance Forty dismounted troopers scaled the walls in a low part near the councilhouse supported by the mus∣queteers and three hundred and fifty foot surprised the mainguard in the marketplace and killed the captain The castle foregate was next secured and the drawbridge let down for the admittance of the horse At one in the afternoon the castle was surrendered on condition that the  Irish  should be given up and the  English  march to  Ludlow Crowe  was soon after hanged for his treachery or cowardice The governor and great numbers of people of rank in the county were taken prisoners and the town was plundered notwithstanding the general had offered his soldiers a great bounty to forbear all acts of violence Much booty was found in the town a considerable magazine and the baggage belonging to Prince  Maurice Mytton  was made governor of the town and re∣ceived the thanks of the house for his good services  I DETERMINED to conclude my tour by a journey to  Caer Caradoc  a post of the celebrated  British  hero  Caractacus  I  went over the new bridge passed by  Condover  CONDOVER  a remarkably handsome and commodious house for its time built by Sir  Tho∣mas Owens  who died in one of the judges in the King'sbench  Herald's Visitation of Shropshire  It is seated at the edge of a fine park from which are variety of beautiful views This place passed to my eldest maternal uncle  Richard Mytton  of  Halston  Esq  by virtue of his marriage

meditating a voyage to explore the productions of the new world he was snatched in at the age of thirtyseven by a fatal pleurisy  NEAR the house is a most remarkable pond which flings up in hot weather a vast quantity of strong bitumen greatly resembling  pitch which gives name to the place It serves all the uses of that commodity and an oil most efficacious in many disorders has been for a

dignified with barons or knights from the time of the Conquest but he had acquired great wealth which he laid out with true munificence By certain monuments with the arms of the family in the church of  Burnel  in  Normandy  it is supposed that they came originally from that country The castle was honored by a session of parlement in the lords sate in the fortress the commons in a great barn the gable ends of which are still to be seen The  Statutum de Mercatoribus  enacted here is from the place known by the name of the statute of  Acton Burnel  It is probable that it was by the influence of the prelate that his habitation was so distinguished  HIS successor in the castle was Sir  Edward Burnel  who served in many actions in  Scotland  under  Edward  I and appeared with great splendor He was always attended with a chariot decked with banners on which as well as on the trappings of his horses were depicted his arms He married  Alice  daughter of Lord  Despenser  by whom he had no issue On his decease in his sister  Maud  became sole heir She married first  John  Lord  Lovel  of  Tichemersh  surnamed  The Rich  he died in Her second husband was  John de Handlow  who died in and left by her one son named  Nicholas  Lord  Burnel  the subject of much contest in the court of chivalry with a  Robert de Morley  CURIOUS TRIAL ABOUT A COAT OF ARMS  on account of the arms which  Nicholas  bore in right of cer∣tain lands of the barony of  Burnel  bestowed on him by his mother These arms  de Morley  had assumed without any just pretence but because as he declared  it was his will and pleasure so to do and that he would defend his so doing  Probably he had no arms of his own having been the first of his family who had appeared in a military capacity He had served as esquire to Sir  Edward Burnel  without any other domestic than one boy and ever since the death of his master assumed the arms in dispute It happened that they both were at the fiege of  Calais  under  Edward  III in arrayed in the same arms  Nicholas  Lord  Burnel  challenged the arms as belong∣ing to the  Burnels  only he having at that time under his com∣mand a hundred men on whose banners were his proper arms Sir  Peter Corbet  then in his retinue offered to combat with  Robert de Morley  in support of the right which his master had to the arms but the duel never took place probably because the king denied his assent The suit was then referred to the court of chivalry held on the sands before  Calais  before  Wil∣liam Bohun  earl of  Northampton  high constable of  England  and  Thomas Beauchamp  earl of  Warwick  earl marshal The trial lasted several days when  Robert  apprehending that the cause would go against him took an opportunity in presence of the king to swear by God's flesh that if the arms in question were adjudged from him he never more would arm himself in the king's service On this the king out of personal regard for the signal services he had performed in those arms and consi∣dering the right of  Nicholas  Lord  Burnel  was desirous to put an end to the contest with as little offence as possible He  therefore sent the earl of  Lancaster  and other lords to  Nicholas  to request that he would permit  Robert de Morley  to bear the arms in dispute for the term of his life only which  Nicholas  out of respect to the king assented to The king then directed the high constable and earl marshal to give judgment accor∣dingly This they performed in the church of St  Peter  near  Calais  and their sentence was immediately proclamed by a herald in the presence of the whole army there assembled  ROBERT  de Morley  was seized with his last illness in  Burgundy  in the year when the  English  army was on its return from the blockade of  Paris  Feeling the approach of death he di∣rected that his banner with the arms of  Burnel  should upon his decease be delivered to  Nicholas  Lord  Burnel  in pursuance of the judgment before passed in the court of chivalry and ac∣cordingly his bannerbearer having in his hands the banner rolled up delivered it to Lord  Burnel  in presence of numbers of the nobility convened as witnesses of the ceremony Lord  Burnel  died in the year and was interred in  Acton Burnel  church under an altar tomb with a brass inlaid in it of the figure of an armed man and a brass label inscribed  Hic jacet Dominus Nich Burnel miles dominus de Holgot qui ob      die Jan AD    Cujus animae propitietur Deus Amen  AMONG the witnesses in this cause were several lords and knights and many very antient people some of them above a hundred years of age one of a hundred and forty and one of a hundred and twenty probably of  Shropshire  as may be collect∣ed from their names and the testimony they gave relative to the descents of the  Burnels  and several private affairs of the family  which were likely to be best known in the neighborhood of their residence  This account is from a curious MS I had the pleasure of receiving from Sir  Edward Smythe    FROM  Longnor  I visited  Caer Caradoc  After a ride of about three miles I fell accidentally on the steepest ascent and after a laborious clamber up a green and smooth ascent now and then mixed with small fragments of  lava  I reached the summit impeded a little by the first ditch and rampart in a place where from the exceeding steepness they seemed totally unnecessary A little higher is the second ditch with a vast agger of stones now sodded over The area is irregular of pretty considerable extent On the more accessible side are three fosses and ram∣parts The entrance and approach are very conspicuous and may even at present be easily travelled on horseback The area slopes upwards and ends in a peak  NOTWITHSTANDING this place is styled  Caer Caradoc  it cer∣tainly was not that

APPENDIX  No INSCRIPTION ON CERTAIN MARBLES IN MOSTYN LIBRARY BROUGHT FROM NARBONNE vol i p  NO II EXTRACTS OUT OF A MANUSCRIPT TREATISE OF THE LORDSHIPS MARCHERS IN WALES TAKEN AUGUST vol i p  The Treatise was borrowed of  Thomas Lloyd  of Overton  Esq    THE treatise shews  How why and when the lordships marchers were first erected  How why and when they were suppressed And  How they may be known and tried at this day from other lordships that were not lordships marchers  For the true knowledge and perfect understanding of the state of lordships marchers in  Wales  the following ques∣tions are fit to be moved  When lordships marchers began in  Wales  How long the creating lordships marchers in  Wales  con∣tinued  When the same was given over and why  Why they were at first ordained and to what end they served  How they became lordships marchers and to have regal authority  How long they continued their force and authority from their first erection  When they were spoiled of their liberty and the same was resumed into the king's hands  Why they were deprived of their regal power  How they are to be known at this day  Why they were at first and are now called lordships marchers and how they first took the name  What difference is at this day between them and other lordships  WALES was the refuge to the antient  Britons  when they were driven by the  Saxons  out of  England  and there they pre∣served the antient blood royal of their kings their laws and antient language from the fury of the  Saxons  There continued an implacable hatred and wars between the two nations And though the heptarchy was reduced to a monarchy by  Egbert  king of the  WestSaxons  who first called that part England yet he and his successors received no obe∣dience or subjection from the kings or princes of  Wales  but they held  Wales  as absolute monarchs and acknowledged no su∣perior under God  Here  Cadwallader  the last king of  Britain  of the  British  line and his desendants did govern the people as their lawful kings and princes all the time of the  Saxon  government  When  William  the Conqueror subdued  England  he dispos∣sessed the  Saxon  issue of the crown he rooted out most of their nobility and brought in his own people the  Normans  and when he was in quiet possession of the kingdom the  Welsh  took no notice of his conquest over the  Saxons  but accounted of it only as a war between two strange nations  Long before the Conquest all  Wales  fell to  Roderick  the Great who divided it between his three sons to  Cadell  he gave  South Wales  containing cantreds to  Anarawd North Wales  of cantreds and to  Mervyn Powys  of cantreds  The issue of these three sons possessed  Wales  according to the said division in the Conqueror's time viz  Rice  son of  Theodore  ruled  South Wales Griffith ap Conan North Wales  and  Blethyn ap Confyn Powys  These three princes would ne∣ver acknowledge that the Conqueror had any superiority over  Wales  and for this reason there arose cruel wars between them and they made daily incursions on each other  The kings of  England  often invaded the borders of  Wales  and forced the inhabitants to fly to the mountains and the  Welsh  at other times made divers inroads over  Severn  and car∣ried great spoils out of  England  This so provoked them that they resolved to make a conquest of  Wales  but the roughness of the country the hills woods and bogs was such a pro∣tection that a great army could hardly be brought to annoy them but were often forced to return home with lofss As  William Rufus  and  Henry  II who entered  Wales  three times with royal armies King  John  made war upon  Llewelin ap for∣werth  prince of  North Wales  and  Henry  III upon  Llewellin ap Griffith  which brought great loss to themselves as well as da∣mage to the  Welsh  The kings of  England  seeing it difficult to make a conquest of  Wales  by a great army gave to the lords and other great men of  England  such countries in  Wales  as they could win from the  Welshmen  These are the words of divers of their grants  By these means many were drawn to bring great armies of  Englishmen  and  Normans  into  Wales  who conquered many great lordships which they held to them and their heirs for ever of the kings of  England  as lands purchased by conquest  The kings of  England  having built divers strong towns of garrison on the frontiers of  Wales  after the Conquest such as  Bristow Gloucester Worcester Salop  and  Chester  as places ready to chastise the  Welshmen  upon all attempts the great men began to invade the countries next to those towns as namely  Peter Corbet  for  Cause Mortimer  for  Wigmore Fitzalan  for  Clun  and  Oswestry Walter Lacy  for  EwyasLacy Dru de Ba∣ladan  for  Abergaveny Monthault  for  Hawarden Gilbert  lord of  Monmouth  for  Monmouth Fulk Fitzwarren  for  Whittington Roger le Strange  for  Elesmere  and shortly after came  Robert Fitzhamon  with his twelve knights into  Glamorgan Bernard Newmarch  into  Brecknock Strongbow  to  Dyfed  or  Pembrokeshire Martin  to  Kemes Morris de Londres  to  Cydwelŷ  and  Cornwallon Lacy  earl of  Lincoln  to  Rhôs  and  Rhyvoniog  now the lordship of  Denbigh Brewis  to  Gower Buelt Radnor Melenith  and  El∣vel  and to  Roger Mortimer  the country now called  Chirk  then called  Mochnant  and to  Cynlleth  and  Nantheudwŷ  and others to other lordships  That the lords might the better govern the people when subdued they were suffered to take upon them such preroga∣tive and authority as were fit for the quiet government of the country  The antient historiographer  Lampridius  saith that the kings of  England  did then use the same policy with lands on the borders of  Scotland  No record to be found in the Tower of  London  or elsewhere of any grant to be a lordship marcher in  Wales  The king's writs out of the courts at  Westminster  did not run into  Wales  except  Pembrokeshire  which was counted part of  England  and called  Little England  beyond  Wales  Nor were there any she∣riffs to execute such writs but the lords did execute laws themselves over the people which they subdued which the kings permitted for a time  No charters of these liberties could conveniently be granted for three reasons  The kings of  England  did not know beforehand what lands a lord should conquer or whether he should conquer any and therefore could not grant any liberties within a certain precinct or territory  The lords after their conquest of any country were not overhasty to purchase any charter because they were not sure but that those lands might be restored by composition between the kings of  England  and the princes of  Wales  as they some∣times were or they might be recovered by force and the lords expelled But  The learned say that the lords marchers had no charters of such liberties because the liberties were of so high a na∣ture so royal and so united to the crown that by the law it was not in the king's power to grant them from the crown  The government by lords marchers continued in  Wales  till the time of  Henry  VIII who perceiving the  Welsh  to live in quietness and subjection thought they might be governed by civil laws as the  English  were And therefore anno c he resumed most of those jurisdictions into his own hands and  appointed justices of peace sheriffs and other officers and di∣vided the country into shires He governed them by the laws of  England  and left little or no authority to the lords marchers  The lords at their conquest of the country built castles for themselves and towns for their followers in the most fertile part and by this means the towns and castles in  Wales  were built as may be seen in the antient charters of those towns  Pembroke Tenby  and  Haverfordwest  by  Strongbow William de Valence  and the  Hastings  being his posterity  Newport  by  Martin  lord of  Kemes Cydwely  by  Londres  and augmented afterwards by the duke of  Lancaster  to whom it came by mar∣riage  Swansey Oystermouth Loghor Radnor Buelt Raiadr  and others by the  Brewises  from whom they came to the  Morti∣mers  and  Beauchamps  by a female issue of  Brewis Brecknock  by  Bernard Newmarch  BlaenLlyfney  by  Herbert Caerdiff  and  Cowbridge  by  Fitz∣hamon  and the earls of  Gloucester Neath  by  Greenfield Aber∣gaveny  by  Dru de Baladan Miles  earl of  Hereford  and others his posterity  Ruthin  by Lord Grey  Denbigh  by  Lacy  earl of  Lincoln  Some of these were towns before the Conquest but being destroyed in the winning of them they were rebuilt by the lords  The lords held their lordships of the kings of  England  in chief as of the crown immediate by serving the king in his wars with certain numbers of men and they were bound to keep their castles with sufficient men and munition for the keeping of the king's enemies in subjection  They executed the  English  laws for the most part within their lordships and brought them to be of  English  tenure and to pass the same according to the laws of  England  by fine recovery feoffment and livery of seisin But such parts as they left to the antient inhabitants to possess were by some lords suffered to be held after the old  Welsh  custom the laws of  Howel Dda  which was to pass the same by surrender in court which they called  Côf Lŷs  and  Ystŷn Wialen  whereof the word  Ystynnol  was derived and where that custom was permitted there is no deed to be found of any lands before the th  Henry  VIII when  Wales  was made shireground but for such lands as were turned to  English  tenures you may find deeds of two three or four hundred years past written in  Latin  or  French  as was used in  England  in those days  The laws of  England  were brought in by the lords marchers because the laws of the land were unknown to the  English  but they suffered the antient tenants to retain some part of the old  Welsh  laws such as the use of gavelkind for parting lands between the brothers and the passing of lands by surrender in court And for this in many lordships there is a  Welsh  court for the  Welshmen  called  Welchrie  and another for the  English  called  Englishrie  In some lordships the lands were divided by gavelkind but passed by feoffments from whence comes  Eng∣lish  tenure and  Welsh  dole in  Welsh Cyfraith Saesnig a RhanCymraig  And the lords had the wardship of all the brethren as if they had been sisters  The lords marchers increased in number till  Llewellin ap Griffith  the last prince of  Wales  was slain anno  Ed  I who then took the principality of  Wales  into his hands and  gave it to  Edward  II his son and made him prince of  Wales  Since which time no more lordships marchers could be erected for the  Welsh  in general submitted themselves to the kings of  England  Since the principality came to the kings of  England  no lord marcher could claim any liberty or prerogative more than they had before without a grant  Edward  I immediately held a parliament at  Ruthlan  castle and there ordained laws and officers to govern  Wales  after the  English  manner  The lordship of  Powŷs  had not its original from conquest as the lordships marchers had but in this manner  Griffith  son of  Meredith ap Blethyn  lord of  Powŷs  seeing the king of  England  and  English  lords preparing themselves to conquer  Wales  did in discretion and policy submit himself to  Henry  I and yielded to hold his lordship of the king of  England  in chief as the lords marchers did and to do the king the like service and thereupon was suffered to hold the same to him and his heirs and was created lord  Powŷs  by the said  Henry  I and made baron of the parliament of  England  His descendant  Hawŷs Gadarn  fell to be the king of  Eng∣land  's ward by reason of the alteration of the tenure in capite who gave her in marriage to a valiant gentleman of his named  John Charlton  And so the lordship of  Powŷs  came to the pos∣session of the  English  lords  Mowthwy  and others did the same These with the lords marchers held their lordships of the kings in chief and not of the princes of  Wales  The lord of  Powŷs  thus submitting himself to the king of  England  the comots in that lordship continue whole and entire  to this day and there is a court baron in every one of them But the lords marchers to reward those that assisted them in their conquests gave them divers manors and so divided the comots into several parts and erected a courtbaron in each The comots were six  Carcinion Mechan uwchCoed Mechan isCoed Mochnant Llannerchhûdol  and  Ystradmarchell  The like may be found in the counties of  Anglesey Caernar∣von Merioneth Flint Carmarthen  and  Cardigan  where the antient comots remain entire without alteration and retain their antient names and bounds and keep the same courts The reason is because they were not conquered by the lords marchers but continued in the hands of the princes of  Wales  till  Llewellin  the last prince was slain by  Edward  I  It appears by antient record that the lordship of  Bromefield  and  Yale  antiently called  Dinas Brân  being the chief castle of the lordship came to the possession of  English  lords as fol∣lows  Emma  daughter to Lord  Audley  and widow to  Griffith ap Ma∣dog  lord of  Bromefield  and  Yale Chirk Nantheudwŷ Maelor  and other lands parcel of antient  Powŷs  having four sons be∣tween whom their father's inheritance was divided strife grew between her and her husband's kindred about the custody of her sons they fearing that if the sons should be brought up by the mother in  England  they would become  English  and rather incline to the king of  England  than to the princes of  Wales  But the mother getting into her possession the two eldest  Ma∣dog  and  Llewellin  the first having to his part  Bromefield  and  Yale  and the other  Chirk  and  Nantheubwŷ  and not being  able to keep them to herself nor to remain in quiet upon her jointure she delivered her sons to  Edward  I shewing that by right they were his wards because their ancestors had formerly made their submission to the kings of  England  The king took them to his ward and committed  Madog  the eldest to the care of  John  earl  Warren  and  Llewellin  to  Roger Mortimer  third son to  Ralph  Lord  Mortimer  of  Wigmore  The two guardians having the sons and their lands in their custody Earl  Warren  built the castle of  Holt  in  Bromefield  and  Roger Morti∣mer  the castle of  Chirk  and placed garrisons of  English  in each to defend the country from the  Welsh  And the wards dying shortly after without issue the said guardians still kept the lands and obtained grants of the king to hold the same th of  Edward  I only the castle of  Hope  and lands thereto belonging were reserved to the king in Earl  Warren  's grant The antient rent of  Bromefield  and  Yale  was  l  a year  Emma  being molested in her jointure because she had de∣livered her sons to the king and so procured the coming of those lords to build the castles of  Bromefield  and  Chirk  she de∣sired the king to take  Maelor  her jointure and to give her lands in  England  for it which the king did and so got into possession of  Maelor Saesnaeg  and held the same ever after not suffering any of the heirs to have it pretending that they were rebels against him  No lord marcher without a castle and a sufficient garrison to suppress such of the  Welsh  as should annoy the king's subjects and therefore all castles had towns close to them inhabited by the  English  And by  Henry  IV c it is enacted that  castles and walled towns in  Wales  should be possessed by valiant  Englishmen  strangers to the seigniories  The charters of those towns give great liberty to the  English  but no  Welshman  might be a burgess or purchase any land therein see  Henry  IV c and It was also enacted that no  Welshman  should have any castle or fortress saving such as was in the time of  Edward  I except bishops and temporal lords  The more to encourage the  English  to conquer  Wales  the kings of  England  created them peers of the realm by the name of lords baron of the places they conquered Their number once was twentyone but now are reduced to one  viz Aber∣gaveny  who is the first lord baron of  England  The rest lost their name and place by coming either to the crown or to lords who had other places and titles in parliament The castles in  Wales  were about  The  Welsh  submitted to  Henry  VII because he was paternally descended from their princes and his son  Henry  VIII made several statutes for the future government of them anno  Lords marchers seized on the goods of their tenants who died intestate  All the lordships marchers have lost their antient jurisdictions and authorities which were the common signs whereby they were known so that it is now a doubt which were such lord∣ships But they may still be known by several tokens  There can be no lordship marcher but such as was sub∣dued before the death of Prince  Llewellin  Such lordship must be held of the king in chief and not of the principality of  Wales  It must have been in antient time the inheritance of some  English  lord  If any suit arose about the title it was to be pleaded at common law in  WestminsterHall  and there were fines levied of those lordships and none other in  Wales  The escheator of the marches of  Wales  did in antient time inquire of the tenure and find  office post mortem  of the lord and that by writ out of the chancery of  England  And as those lordships were not in any shire in  England  and the king had no escheators to enquire of the tenure of them the same was laid on the escheator of the next  English  shire And such es∣cheators had the charge care and survey of all lordships marches that were holden of the king And such escheator was to go into any lordship marcher in  Wales  and swear an in∣quest and find an office after the death of the lord and inquire of the tenure and value of the lordshipN B All offices of other manors that were holden of the king as of his princi∣pality were found by virtue of writs out of the king's ex∣chequer of  Caernarvon  or  Chester  for  North Wales  and  Car∣marthen  or  Cardigan  for  South Wales  and out of  Pembroke  for lands in that earldom  These lords by stat  Henry  VIII c have the penalty for killing of wainlings and for nonappearance at their courts and by stat  Henry  VIII c and c they have the forfeiture of common mainprize recognizances mizes power to keep courtbarons and courtleets and to have waifs strays infangthefe outfangthefe treasuretrove deodands goods and chattels of felons persons condemned and outlawed and also wreck de mere wharfage and custom of strangers  From the river  Tifi  in  South Wales  to the river  Conwy  in  North Wales  there was no lordship marcher but all that coun∣try remained wholly to the princes of  Wales  until the princi∣pality came to the crown by Prince  Llewellin  's death  As the river  Severn  was the antient limit between  Wales  and  England  a doubt hath arisen why all the land that is over that river  viz  all  Herefordshire  and so much as is part of  Gloucester∣shire Worcestershire  and  Shropshire  had not been lordships marchers as the rest of  Wales  was that was won since the Con∣quest  The reason is this All  Herefordshire  and those parts of the other counties were won from the  Welsh  in or shortly after the time of  Offa  king of  Mercia  The  Welsh  were expelled thence the country was new planted with  Englishmen  and this was long before the dividing of  England  into shires The same was an∣nexed to the kingdom of  Mercia  and so as part of that king∣dom it came to the hands of king  Alfred  who first divided  Eng∣land  into shires He finding those countries subdued and the  Welsh  expelled divided them with the rest on the other side  Se∣vern  He added part to  Gloucestershire  part to  Worcestershire  and part to  Shropshire  and made  Herefordshire  a shire of itself  Here lies the difference between conquering of  Wales  by the  Saxons  and the  Normans  So much of  Wales  as the  Saxon  kings won they did it at their own charge and for their own use and did not suffer their subjects to deal therein But the  Norman  conqueror content∣ing himself with the realm of  England  did not bend his forces against  Wales  more than he was forced to do by their invading of his people and country and he and his successors thought  it better policy to give to the nobility such parts of  Wales  as they could conquer  Herefordshire  was not won since the Conquest appears from the lordship of  Urchinfield  which is antient demesnelands such as is not to be found in  England  but what was in the pos∣session of its kings before the Conquest See  Silas Taylor  of  Urchinfield

Account of the Discontents in  France  in the begin∣ning of the Reign of  Louis  XIII  MY humble duty premisedOur embassador being return∣ed to  England  and my acquaintance in  Paris  retyred with him I am uncertayn where to dyrect my lr̄es that I may be assured they may come to hand  This state of  France  is in division with ytselfe for certain of the princes are discontentedly retyred to their governments where they fortify themselves in the strongest cytties Those  of them who want place of importance in their own countrey joyn with the rest to make good the hould they fynd fitt to make resistance and so many are joyned togeather in  Champaigne  being the government of the duke of  Nevers  who also is one of the number But the cheife of all is the prince of  Conde  with whom also is the duke of  Vendosme  bastard son to the late king of  France  who not longe since was comitted to pryson but finding that opportunite to shift him self into the habit of a scullion he escaped and put himselfe into the companie of the malecontents being in number about six or dukes besides others assembled togeather upon there garde in the cytty of  Misiers  and  Cedan  upon the borders of the Low Coun∣treys being frontyre towns of  Champaign  Whence the prince of  Conde  writt to the king and queen shewing the cause of his retyrednes so far as touched himselfe being as he sayed out of the care he had of the king and kingdome to reform the one and give contentment to the other which could not be don without the assembly of the states which he earnestly desi∣red principally to abridge the extream taxations of the sub∣jects to purge the kingdome of the unnecessarie offices who served to no other use than to impoverish the people and with∣all to forbear to proceed in the marriadge between  France  and  Spayn  untyll the assembly of the estates wear dissolved least any thinge should be concluded to the pjudice of those of the reformed religion The lre was well written and carried with yt a shewe of great good to the comon wealth but the people are so fearfull of the name of civil warre that very fewe stirr of the parte of the princes It is very true that the prince of  Conde  was drawn into the number by some other of the dukes  and not out of any just cause that he hath of discontent more then for the love of some of them who he wo  d  protect  Thèr ys watch and ward in all towns and good order for provision of arms whereof ther ys no want in these partes  The queen maketh great preparation to go to meete the king of  Spayn  to conclude the marriage notwithstandinge the dis∣taste the princes have of that proceedinge  The report hear ys that the princes will submit themselves to the kings mercie and will offer themselves to attende the kinge to his marriage but how that will prove ys uncertain for they fortifie themselves daylie and while they speake of peace they prepare for warre But that w  ch  will turn to there mischife ys the want of money w  ch  all knowe otherwise they are well seated to do the kinge a shrewd turne These sturrs in  France  causeth the kingdome to be more difficult for tra∣vaile and maketh many strangers remove to other countreys myself amonge the rest am resolved of my remove with as much speed as I may to  Savoy  and so to  Piēmont  and to see some part of  Lombardie  before the extreamitie of the heate I have continued here in  Burbonnoise  to exercise myself to ride where∣to I have applyed myselfe amonge the bestnatured people of the world God contynewe you your health and make my re∣turn as happy as you desire  I rest your obedient son JOHN WYNNE  st  Aprilis    His next Lr̄e is dated  April  from  Marseilles  and directed to his Father  My humble duty remembred  SYTHENCE The writinge Of my last I removed from the place where I was to  Lyons  being leagues Of  Burbonnoise  Before I set foorth I ridd to the Bath w  ch  ys leagues distant from  Moulins  as well to see the castle as other remarkable things w  ch  are well worthy a strangers Observion The go∣vernor Of The country sent expressly to cause all things to be shewed me Being arrived I bestowed that nyht to see the new work w  ch  the last king caused to be built near the springe but that w  ch  was wonderfull was inclosed places within the bath the waters whereof ys so extream hot that there ys not any that care adventure to goe bath himselfe within though the weather be never so could for experience whereof the last great frost a younge mayd goinge to take up water her feet slipt because of the yce and falling into the water was taken up dead being boyled by reason Of the extroardinarie heat of the springe The next morninge I sawe the castle Of  Bourbon  w  ch  ys extroardinarie well seated for strength and adorned with∣in with a very fayr chappell beinge on of the rarest pieces Of worke Of  France  within w  ch  there ys a piece of the very true crosse of our Saviour if wee may give credit to them that have the keepinge thereof w  ch  was brought from  Jerusalem  By St  Clovis  king Of  France  with on of the thorns of the crown Of our Saviour w  ch  marvilouslie doth flowr upon the Passion day between nine and ten of the clock and after doth vanish away I wo  d  upon that day have gone to see yt but I found  all men at there devotion so that non wo  d  travaile that day I doubt nothinge of the omnipotencie of the Almightie who hath made all things of nothinge but I make question of ma∣ny superstitious observations of these Papists who have often belyed God attributinge to reliks more then to God This thorn is inclosed in christall within the same that the crosse ys beinge all set in gould with works of imagerie contayninge the passion of our Saviour w  ch  the houldinge in your hand the bud appeareth at that tyme of the day upon Good Fryday remayneth on flowr and so vanisheth  From thence to  Lyons  where I contynued a week and so by water I voyaged to  Avignon  w  ch  ys belonging to the Pope where entring into the town I was demanded by the gard at the gate whence I was and of what religion Where havinge related all things according to there demand I was lett passe towarde my lodginge beinge somewhat melancholick because I supposed that I sho  d  not have that libertie to see all places in that towne as I desired but havinge encountred with a  French  lord of that country of whom I inquired whether I might freely see all places in town who used me with that extroar∣dinarie kindness that being invited to supper that night he speake of me to the cardinal being vicelegat and the next morninge brought me to the cardinal who was returned from masse having a hundred gentlemen well appointed who in ranke went before him by three and by three until the pallaisie my selfe coming by with that lord I was saluted by the legat and honorably entertayned with many good words tellinge me that yt was not lawfull for those of our religion to remayne above three dayes but for me I might stay as longe as I wo  d    with many other circumstances of love and curtesie enjoyninge that I  d  to shewe me all places in town and principally to con∣duct me to see a companie at a gentlemans house who wear ready to maske and dance in honour of a babtisme whereunto the cardinals brother was intreated as godfather In ende be∣inge after dinner at the church to see the manner of yt though I had before seen the like behould a great number of violens and musitiens came marching before the godfather who brought the child upon his arme accordinge to the  French  manner to the church and then the ladies and gentlewomen accompany∣inge the godmother entred and so they went to the ceremonie my selfe went amonge the rest and stood by to hear and see what they did which some gentlemen perceivinge who had taken notice of me in the morninge demanded of me how I liked of the ceremonie I sayd well And whether there wear great difference between the  English  manner and that of  France  for the babtisme I answered for that I had seen that they differed from us I was further pressed by those gent whether yt pleased me to see the manner of yt or not I sayd yea but that I co  d  not enter for the presse Then the gent made me place and brought me close to the place where in interpretinge unto me the manner of all circumstances he was louder

other gent and I discoursed of I was asked by the parent of the child in what sort we differed in  England  from the manner of  France  in babtisme I answered that our children wear not so well fed before they received babtisme  as this child was The gent fell all to a laughter for indeed the child was so ould that he was almost ready to goe and had such a broad face that all the companie were made merry with the mouths the child made at the preist duringe the time he was using his office The gent tould me that yt was the man∣ner in these countreys also to christen them when they wear or dayes ould but for this the godfather beinge in  Italy  they wear constrained to stay till his return After the babtisme I was offered all the curtesie that I could desire And so I went to  Aix  being

SIR  Rich  d  Bulkeley  served in parl  t  for the county of  Anglesey  the  d  and  d  sessions of Q  Mary  the  d  of  Eliz  and  st  of  James  He was of goodly person fair of complexion and tall of sta∣ture He was temperate in his dyet not drinking of healths In his habit he never changed his fashion but always wore round breeches and thick bumbast doublets though very gallant and  rich In the last year of Queen  Eliz  being then somewhat stricken in years he attended the counsil of marches at  Ludlow  in wintertime When the lord president  Zouch  went in his coach to church or elsewhere Sir  Richard  used to ride on a great stone horse and some time he wo  d  go from his lodging to church in frost and snow on foot with a short cloak silk stockings a great rapier and dagger tarry all prayers and ser∣mon in very cold weather insomuch y  r  L  d  Zouch  was wont to say he was cold to see him  He was a great reader of history and discourses of all estates and countries of very good memory and understanding in matters belonging to housekeeping husbandry maritime af∣fayres building of ships and maintaining them at sea He drew his own letters and answered all letters with his own hand and being complayned of at the counsil of the marches for breach of an order of that court he drew his own answer that he co  d  not be evicted out of his possession but by course of common lawpleaded  Magna Charta  and demanded judge∣ment which answer being put into court the chief justice Sir  Richard Shuttleworth  called for a sight thereof and after pe∣rusal said to the counsellors at the bar  Look my masters what a bone S  r  Rich  d  Bulkeley  hath cast into the court for you to tire upon  and the matter being argued it was re∣ferred to the com̄on law  He was a great housekeeper and entertainer of strangers especially such as passed to or from  Ireland  He nobly enter∣tained the earl of  Essex  in his way there to be lord lieuten  t  He made provision of all necessaries for his table beforehand He sent yearly two ships to  Greenland  for cod ling and other  fish which he did use to barter in  Spain  for  Malaga  and sherrie wines and always kept a good stocke of old sack in his cellar which he called  Amabile  besides other wines He kept two parks well stored with Red and Fallow Deer w  ch  did afford such plenty of venison as furnished his table or times every week in the season besides pleasuring of friends He kept several farms besides his demesne in his hands w  ch  fur∣nished his house with fat beef mutton lamb c c He was an excellent horseman and an expert tilter keeping two great stables of horses one in  Cheshire  and another in  Beaumaris  and a great studd of mares His estate in  Anglesey  was £ in  Carnarvonshire  £ and in  Cheshire  £ a year having always a great stock of ready money lying in his chest He kept many servants and attendants tall and proper men two lacqueys in livery always ran by his horse he never went from home without or to attend him He was a great favo∣rite of Queen  Eliz  He had powerful freinds at court and had the gentry and commonalty of the county of  Anglesey  at his ser∣vice except the  Woods  of  Rhosmore  who were always his ennemies  He had great contests with  Dudley  earl of  Leicester  who ob∣tayned the queens letters patents under the great seal to be chief ranger of the forrest of  Snowdon  in which office he be∣haved very injuriously to the counties of  Merioneth Carnarvon  and  Anglesey  attempting to bring within the bounds and li∣mits of that forrest most of the freeholders lands in those counties and for that purpose the earl procured several com∣missions from the queen to inquire of encroachments and con∣cealments of lands The return of the jury in  Anglesey  not  being agreeable to the earls commissioners they went in a rage to  Carnarvon  forcibly entered the exchequer there ran∣sacked the records and carried away what they pleased but the earl after making many attempts to the great grievance of the country was obliged to desist being defeated in all schemes upon  Snowdon  by the power and interest and spirit of Sir  Rich  d  Bulkeley  But  manet alta mente repostum  the earl bore a poy∣sonous hatred to Sir  Rich  d    yet he continued still in favor with the queen and counsel though often molested by the earl his agents and creatures  S  r  Richard  being one of the deputy lewtenants of  Anglesey  upon intelligence of the  Spanish Armadas  threatening  England  was to cesse the country in arms and cessing Mr  Woods  of  Rhosmore  he was highly offended and thought himself too heavi∣ly loaden therefore went up to court to the earl of  Leicester  carrying a false tale with him that Sir  Richard Bulkeley  a little before the attainder and execution of  Tho  s  Salusbury  one of the accomplices of  Anth  y  Babington  the traytor had been in the mountains of  Snowdon  conferring with him and that at a farm of Sir  Richards  called  Cwmligie  they had layne together two or nights The earl glad of this information presently acquaints the queen and council therewith Sir  Richard  being called before the council and examined absolutely denied the whole matter And when the earl at y  t  time president of the queens counsil did severely inforce it ag  t  him he told the earl to his face "Your father and the very same men as now informe against me were like to undoe my father for upon the death of K  Edw  by letters from your father he was commanded to proclayme Queen  Jane  and to muster the  country which he did accordingly and had not my mother been one of Queen  Maries  maids of honor he had come to great trouble and danger" Hearing these words the counsil hushed and rose and Sir  Richard  departed The earl hastened to the queen and told her the counsil had been examining Sir  Richard Bulkeley  about matters of treason that they found him a dangerous person and saw cause to comit him to the Tower and that he dwellt in a suspicious corner of the world "What Sir  Richard Bulkeley"  said the queen "he never intended us any harm We have brought him up from a boy and have had special tryal of his fidelity you shall not comit him" "We" said the earl "have the care of your majestys person see more and hear more of the man than you doe he is of an aspiring mind and lives in a remote place" "Before God replyed the queen we will be sworn upon the holy Evan∣gelists he never intended us any harm" and so ran to the Bible and kissed it saying "You shall not comitt him we have brought him up from a boy" Then the lords of the counsill wrote a letter to D  r  Hugh Bellot  lord bishop of  Bangor  to exa∣mine the truth of the accusation layd to Sir  Richards  charge which the bishop found false and forged and so certifyed to the counsil Whereupon he was cleared to the queens majestys great content to the abundant joy of his country and to his own great credit and reputation and afterwards diverse of the lords of the councell wrote letters to the justices of assize of  North Wales  to publish Sir  Richards  wrongs and to notify to the queens subjects his clear innocence  But that Sir  Richard  might not rest in peace one  Green  be∣longing to the earl of  Leicester  in the name of one  Bromfeild  a pensioner came to him to challenge him to meet  Bromfeild  in the feild "Have you no other errand quoth Sir  Richard  " "No" says  Green  Then S  r  Richard  drew his dagger and broke  Greens  pate telling him to carry that as his answer he scorning to meet such a knave as  Bromfeild  This treatment of  Green  highly encreased the anger of the Earl  Bromfeild Green  and others of his retayners plotted mischief to the per∣son of Sir  Richard  but he stood upon his guard keeping al∣ways stout men with swords bucklers and daggers to de∣fend him from their attempts They hired boats and wherries upon the  Thames  with a design to drown Sir  Richard  as he sho  d  go from  Westminster  to  London  but he being privately informed thereof borrowed the lord mayor of  Londons  barge furnished it with men musquetts billets drums and trumpets and rowed along the  Thames  shot the bridge and went down to  Greenwich  where the queen kept her court at that time and at the landing place over against the pallace he caused his companie to discharge their musquets to beat their drums and sound their trumpets The earl of  Leycester  hearing there∣of repaired to the queen and informed her that Sir  Richard Bulkeley  more like a rebel than a subject had come with barges men musquetts drums and trumpets and had shot several pieces over against her majestys palace to the great terror of her court a matter not be suffered The queen sent for Sir  Richard  and after hearing his apology for himself made the earl freinds with him Within a while after the earl sent for S  r  Richard  to his chamber who coming thither the earl began to expostulate with him on several wrongs and abuses he pretended to have received at his hands and that  he had lost £ by his opposition But the discourse end∣ed in milder terms and Sir  Richard  was bidden to dinner but did eat or drink nothing save of what he saw the earl tast re∣membring Sir  Nic  s  Throgmorton  who was said to have received a fig at his table  But the earl of  Lycester  dying in  Oct  r  Sir  Richard Bulkeley  and his country enjoyed peace and quietness from his tyrannical oppressions his devices and wicked practises and Sir  Richard  survived to the  June  when he dyed aged He had attended the coronation of y  e  queens  Mary  and  Elizabeth  and of  James  the st His cloak at this last coro∣nation cost him £  N  o  XI A LETTER OF ARCHBISHOP WILLIAMS WHILE FELLOW OF ST JOHN'S COLLEGE

want an honourable place in commencing since you are content to undergo the charges  I thank you Sir for your charges always with me Your former so many courtesies devoided of all requital of my side

prince some extraordinary contentment at  Newmarket  upon  Tuesday  last what time by appointment I preach'd before them I had a great deal of court holy water if I can make myself any good thereby  I pray you Sir by  Lent  next when your son is capable of a place let there be some order taken that the money you are willing to disburse for his place be at  London  in some readi∣ness for me to call

of the  Sha∣kerlies  who settled there soon after the restoration They were originally of  Cheshire  but removed to this place almost imme∣diately on the return of the royal family Colonel afterwards Sir  Jeffry    Shakerly  was a distinguished loyalist and had the command of a regiment of horse under  Charles  I During his service he contracted a great frindship with colone  Robinson  owner of the  Upper Gwersilt  which induced him soon after the year to purchase this estate from captain  Sutton  an old cavalier descended from  Tudor Trevor  and ruined in the royal cause This the colonel did not only to replace a considerable estate he had been obliged to sell in  Kent  in support of the cause but to be near his friend and fellowsoldier No mention is made of him in any of the histories of our civil commotions notwithstanding he was engagd in most of the actions of any note The following account of what preceded the battle of  RowtonHeath  near  Chester  is extremely curious and merits pre∣servation which I deliver in the manner I received it by the favor of his grandson  Peter Shakerley  Esq  "THE heath upon which Sir  Marmaduke Langdale  was drawn up carries the name of  Rowton Heath  a mile beyond which in the  London  road from  Chester  is another heath called  Hatton Heath  The order which Sir  Marmaduke  had received from the king was only to beat  Poyntz  back Sir  Marmaduke  performed the same effectually for having marched his men over  Holt Bridge  undiscovered by the enemy who had taken the outworks and suburbs of the city on the eastside thereof and  Poyntz  coming in a marching posture along the narrow lane be∣tween  Hatton Heath  and  Rowton Heath  Sir  Marmaduke  having lined the hedges fell upon him and killed a great many of his men and having so done ordered colonel  Shakerley  who was best acquainted with that country to get the next way he could to the king who lodged then at Sir  Francis Gamull  's house in  Chester  and acquaint him that he had obeyed his orders in beat∣ing  Poyntz  back and to know his majesty's further pleasure The colonel executed his orders with better speed than could have been expected for he gallopped directly to the river  Dee  under  Huntingdon House  got a wooden tub used for slaughtering of swine and a battingstaff used for batting of coarse linen for an oar put a servant into the tub with him and in this despe∣rate manner swam over the river his horse swimming by him for the banks were there very steep and the river very deep ordered his servant to stay there with the tub for his return and was with the king in little more than a quarter of an hour after he had left Sir  Marmaduke  and acquainted the king that if his Majesty pleased to command further orders to Sir  Marmaduke  he would engage to deliver them in a quarter of an hour and told the king of the expeditious method he had taken which saved him the going nine or ten miles about by  Holt Bridge  for the boats at  Eaton  were then made useless but such delays were used by some about the king that no orders were sent nor any sally made out of the city by the king's party till past three o'clock afternoon which was full six hours after  Poyniz  had been beaten back and so  Poyntz  having all that time for his men to recover the fright they had been put into in the morning  Poyntz  rallied his forces and with the help of the parlement forces who came out of the suburbs of the city to his assistance upon whom the king's party in the city might then successfully have fallen put all those of the king's to the rout which was the loss of the king's horse and of his design to join  Montross  in  Scotland  who was then understood to be in a good condition  "THIS is what my father the said colonel  Shakerley  afterwards Sir  Geffrey Shakerley  hath often declared in my hearing and since no mention is made of him in all this history though he faithfully served the king in all the wars was personally engaged in almost all the field battles for the king sold part of his estate to support that service and was for many years sequestered of all the rest I thought it my duty as his eldest son and heir to do that justice to his memory to insert this here under my hand that it may be remembered to posterity  "PETER SHAKERLEY"  Page An antient chronicle speaks of the phoenomenon of the comet in these terms

their grant that of  Madoc  the founder of the abby The monks erected new works on the river for the purpose of taking the fish this caused a dispute between them and the freemen The last referred it to the abbot and five monks of their own choice who were to ad∣just the matter on oath  Madoc  and his secretary  John Parvus  appointed a day for the purpose The assembly was held the oath solemnly administered and the abbot and monks made the decision in their own favor They alleged that they had bought the right of erecting what works they pleased and of re∣pairing of them from the heirs of
