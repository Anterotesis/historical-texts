TO THE PISOS  TRANSLATED FROM HORACE  WITH NOTES  REVISED AND CORRECTED  First Printed in the Year MDCCLXXXIII  TO The Rev JOSEPH WARTON D D MASTER of WINCHESTER SCHOOL AND TO The Rev THOMAS WARTON BD FELLOW of TRINITY COLLEGE OXFORD  MY DEAR FRIENDS  IN a conversation some months ago I happened to mention to you the idea I had long enter∣tained of that celebrated Epistle of Horace com∣monly distinguished by the title of THE ART OF POETRY I will not say that you acceded to my opinion but I flatter myself that I in some degree interested your curiosity and engaged your attention our discourse at least revived an intention I had once formed of communicating my thoughts on the sub∣ject to the Publick an intention I had only dropt for want of leisure and inclination to attempt a translation of the Epistle which I thought necessary to accompany the original and my remarks on it  In the original Horace assumes the air and style of an affectionate teacher admonishing and instructing his young friends and pupils but the following translation together with the observations annexed I address to You as my Masters from whom I look for sound information a wellgrounded confirmation of my hypothesis or a solution of my doubts and a correction of my errors  It is almost needless to observe that the Epistle in question has very particularly exercised the critical sagacity of the literary world yet it is remarkable that amidst the great variety of comments and de∣cisions on the work it has been almost universally considered except by one acute and learned writer of this country as a loose vague and desultory com∣position a mass of shining materials like pearls unstrung valuable indeed but not displayed to ad∣vantage  Some have contended with Scaliger at their head that this pretended  Art of Poetry  is totally void of art and that the very work in which the beauty and excellence of  Order  ORDINIS VIRTUS ET VENUS is strongly recommended is in itself un∣connected confused and immethodical The ad∣vocates  for the writer have in great measure confessed the charge but pleaded in excuse and vindication the familiarity of an Epistle and even the genius of Poetry in which the formal divisions of a prosaick treatise on the art would have been insupportable They have also denied that Horace ever intended such a treatise or that he ever gave to this Epistle the title of  the Art of Poetry  on which  title  the at∣tacks of Scaliger and his followers are chiefly grounded The title however is confessedly as old as the age of Quintilian and that the work it∣self has a perpetual reference  to Poets and Poetry  is as evident as that it is from beginning to end in its manner style address and form perfectly  Epistolary  The learned and ingenious Critick distinguished above an early ornament to letters and now a worthy dignitary of the church leaving vain com∣ments and idle disputes on the  title  of the work sagaciously directed his researches to scrutinize the work itself properly endeavouring to trace and in∣vestigate from the composition the end and design of the writer and remembering the axiom of the Poet to whom his friend had been appointed the commentator  In every work regard  THE AUTHOR's END  For none can compass more than they intend  POPE  With this view of illustrating and explaining Horace's Art of Poetry this shrewd and able writer about thirty years ago republished the original Epistle giving the text chiefly after Dr Bentley subjoining an English Commentary and Notes and prefixing an Introduction from which I beg leave to transcribe most part of the three first paragraphs  It is agreed on all hands that the antients are our masters in the  art  of composition Such of their writings therefore as deliver instructions for the exercise of this  art  must be of the highest value And if any of them hath acquired a credit in this respect superior to the rest it is perhaps the  following work  which the learned have long since considered as a kind of  summary  of the rules of good writing to be gotten by heart by every young student and to whose decisive authority the greatest masters in taste and compo∣sition must finally submit  But the more unquestioned the credit of this poem is the more it will concern the publick that it be justly and accurately understood The writer of these sheets then believed it might be of  use if he took some pains to clear the sense con∣nect the method and ascertain the scope and pur∣pose of this admired Epistle Others he knew indeed and some of the first fame for critical learning had been before him in his attempt Yet he did not find himself prevented by their labours in which besides innumerable lesser faults he more especially observed two invete∣rate errors of such a sort as must needs perplex the genius and distress the learning of  any  com∣mentator The  one  of these respects the SUBJECT the other the METHOD of the  Art of Poetry  It will be necessary to say something upon each  That the  Art of Poetry  at large is not the  proper  subject of this piece is so apparent that it hath not escaped the dullest and least attentive of its Criticks For however all the different  kinds  of poetry might appear to enter into it yet every one saw that  some  at least were very slightly considered whence the frequent attempts the  artes et institutiones poeticae  of writers both at home and abroad to supply its deficiencies But though this truth was seen and confessed it un∣luckily happened that the sagacity of his nume∣rous Commentators went no further They still  considered this famous Epistle as a  collection  though not a  system  of criticisms on poetry in ge∣neral with this concession however that the stage had evidently the largest share in it  Satyra haec est in sui saeculi poetas PRAECIPUE vero in Roma∣num Drama  Baxter  Under the influence of this prejudice several writers of name took upon them to comment and explain it and with the success which was to be ex∣pected from so fatal a mistake on setting out as the not seeing  'that the proper and sole pur∣pose of the Author was not to abridge the Greek Criticks whom he probably never thought of nor to amuse himself with composing a short criti∣cal system for the general use of poets which every line of it absolutely confutes but simply to criticize the ROMAN DRAMA'  For to this end not the tenor of the work only but as will appear every single precept in it ultimately re∣fers The mischiefs of this original error have been long felt It hath occasioned a constant perplexity in defining the  general  method and in fixing the import of  particular  rules Nay its effects have reached still further For conceiving as they did that the whole had been composed out of the Greek Criticks the labour and ingenuity  of its interpreters have been misemployed in picking out authorities which were not wanted and in producing or more properly by their studied refinements in  creating  conformities which were never designed Whence it hath come to pass that instead of investigating the order of the Poet's own reflexions and scru∣tinizing the peculiar state of the Roman Stage the methods which common sense and common criticism would prescribe the world hath been nauseated with insipid lectures on  Aristotle  and  Phalereus  whose solid sense hath been so attenu∣ated and subtilized by the delicate operation of French criticism as hath even gone some way to∣wards bringing the  art  itself into disrepute  But the wrong explications of this poem have arisen not from the misconception of the  subject  only but from an inattention to the METHOD of it The  latter  was in part the ge∣nuine consequence of the  former  For not sus∣pecting an unity of design in the subject its in∣terpreters never looked for or could never find a consistency of disposition in the method And this was indeed the very block upon which HEINSIUS and before him JULIUS SCALIGER  himself stumbled These illustrious Criticks with all the force of genius which is required to dis∣embarrass an involved subject and all the aids of learning that can lend a ray to enlighten a dark one have notwithstanding found themselves utterly unable to unfold the order of this Epistle insomuch that SCALIGER  Praef in LIB POET et l vi p  hath boldly pro∣nounced the conduct of it to be  vicious  and HEIN∣SIUS had no other way to evade the charge than by recurring to the forced and uncritical expedient of a licentious transposition The truth is they were both in one common error that the Poet's purpose had been to write a criticism of the Art of Poetry at large and not as is here shewn of the Roman Drama in particular  The remainder of this Introduction as well as the Commentary and Notes afford ample proofs of the erudition and ingenuity of the Critick yet I much doubt whether he has been able to convince the learned world of the truth of his main proposition  "that it was the proper and sole purpose of the Au∣thor simply  to criticise the  ROMAN DRAMA"  His Commentary is it must be owned extremely seduc∣ing yet the attentive reader of Horace will perhaps  often fancy that he perceives a violence and con∣straint offered to the composition in order to ac∣commodate it to the system of the Commentator who to such a reader may perhaps seem to mark transitions and point out connections as well as to maintain  a method  in the Commentary which cannot clearly be deduced from the text to which it refers  This very ingenious  Commentary  opens as fol∣lows  The subject of this piece being as I suppose  one  viz  the state of the Roman Drama  and com∣mon sense requiring even in the freest forms of composition some kind of  method  the intelligent reader will not be surprized to find the poet prose∣cuting his subject in a regular wellordered  plan  which for the more exact description of it I distinguish into three parts  I The first of them from l to is prepa∣ratory to the main subject of the Epistle con∣taining some general rules and reflections on poetry but principally with an eye to the follow∣ing parts by which means it serves as an useful introduction to the poet's design and opens with that air of ease and elegance essential to the epi∣stolary form  II The main body of the Epistle from l to is laid out in regulating the  Roman  stage but chiefly in giving rules for Tragedy not only as that was the sublimer species of the  Drama  but as it should seem less cultivated and understood  III The last part from l to the end ex∣horts to correctness in writing yet still with an eye principally to the  dramatick species  and is taken up partly in removing the causes that pre∣vented it and partly in directing to the use of such means as might serve to promote it Such is the general plan of the Epistle  In this general summary with which the Critick introduces his particular Commentary a very mate∣rial circumstance is acknowledged which perhaps tends to render the system on which it proceeds ex∣tremely doubtful if not wholly untenable The original Epistle consists of four hundred and seventysix lines and it appears from the above numerical analysis that not half of those lines only two hun∣dred and six verses from v to are employed on the subject of  the Roman Stage  The first of the three parts above delineated from v to cer∣tainly  contains general rules and restrictions on poetry  but surely with no particular reference to the Drama As to the second part the Critick I think might fairly have extended the Poet's consideration of the Drama to the th line seventy lines further than he has carried it but the last hundred and eleven lines of the Epistle so little allude to the Drama that the only passage in which a mention of the Stage has been supposed to be implied  ludusque repertus c  is by the learned and ingenious Critick himself particularly distinguished with a very different inter∣pretation Nor can this portion of the Epistle be considered by the impartial and intelligent reader as a mere exhortation  "to correctness in writing taken up partly in removing the causes that pre∣vented it and partly in directing to the use of such means as might serve to promote it"  Correctness  is indeed here as in many other parts of Horace's Satires and Epistles occasionally inculcated but surely the main scope of this animated conclusion is to deter those who are not blest with genius from attempting the walks of Poetry  I much approve what this writer has urged on the  unity of subject and beauty of epistolary method  observed in this Work but cannot agree that  "the main  subject and intention was  the regulation of the Roman Stage  "  How far I may differ concerning particu∣lar passages will appear from the notes at the end of this translation In controversial criticism differ∣ence of opinion cannot but be expressed  veniam petimusque damusque vicissim  but I hope I shall not be thought to have delivered my sentiments with petulance or be accused of want of respect for a character that I most sincerely reverence and ad∣mire  I now proceed to set down in writing the sub∣stance of what I suggested to you in conversation concerning my own conceptions of the end and de∣sign of Horace in this Epistle In this explanation I shall call upon Horace as my chief witness and the Epistle itself as my principal voucher Should their testimonies prove adverse my system must be aban∣doned like many that have preceded it as vain and chimerical and if it should even by their support be acknowledged and received it will I think like the egg of Columbus appear so plain easy and obvious that it will seem almost wonderful that the Epistle has never been considered in the same light till now I do not wish to dazzle with the lustre of a new hypothesis which requires I think  neither the strong opticks nor powerful glasses of a critical Herschel to ascertain the truth of it but is a system that lies level to common apprehension and a luminary discoverable by the naked eye  My notion is simply this I conceive that one of the sons of Piso undoubtedly the Elder had either written or meditated a poetical work most proba∣bly a Tragedy and that he had with the know∣ledge of the family communicated his piece or in∣tention to Horace but Horace either disapproving of the work or doubting of the poetical faculties of the Elder Piso or both wished to dissuade him from all thoughts of publication With this view he formed the design of writing this Epistle addressing it with a courtliness and delicacy perfectly agree∣able to his acknowledged character indifferently to the whole family the father and his two sons  Epi∣stola ad Pisones de Arte Poeticâ  He begins with general reflections generally ad∣dressed to his  three  friends  Credite  PISONESPATER    JUVENES  patre digni  In these prelimi∣nary rules equally necessary to be observed by Poets of every denomination he dwells on the necessity of unity of design the danger of being dazzled by the  splendor of partial beauties the choice of subjects the beauty of order the elegance and propriety of diction and the use of a thorough knowledge of the nature of the several different species of Poetry summing up this introductory portion of his Epistle in a manner perfectly agreeable to the conclusion of it  Descriptas servare vices operumque colores  Cur ego si nequeo ignoroque poeta salutor  Cur nescire pudens pravè quam discere malo  From this general view of poetry on the canvas of Aristotle but entirely after his own manner the writer proceeds to give the rules and history of the Drama adverting principally to Tragedy with all its constituents and appendages of diction fable character incidents chorus measure musick and decoration In this part of the work according to the interpretation of the best Criticks and indeed I think according to the manifest tenor of the Epistle he addresses himself entirely to  the two young gentlemen  pointing out to them the difficulty as well as ex∣cellence of the Dramatick Art insisting on the avowed superiority of the Graecian Writers and ascribing the comparative failure of the Romans to negligence and avarice The Poet having  exhausted this part of his subject suddenly drops a  second  dismissing at once no less than  two  of the  three  Persons to whom he originally addressed his Epistle and turning short on  the  ELDER PISO most earnestly conjures him to ponder on the danger of precipitate publications and the ridicule to which the author of wretched poetry exposes himself From the com∣mencement of this partial address O MAJOR JUVE∣NUM  c  v to the end of the poem  almost a fourth part of the whole  the second person plural  PisonesVosVos O Pompilius Sanguis  c is discarded and the second person singular  Tu Te Tibi  c invariably takes its place The argu∣ments too are equally relative and personal not only shewing the necessity of study combined with natural genius to constitute a Poet but dwelling on the peculiar danger and delusion of flattery to a writer of rank and fortune as well as the inestima∣ble value of an honest friend to rescue him from de∣rision and contempt The Poet however in reve∣rence to the Muse qualifies his exaggerated description of an infatuated scribbler with a most noble enco∣mium on the uses of Good Poetry vindicating the dignity of the Art and proudly asserting that the most exalted characters would not be disgraced by the cultivation of it  Ne forte pudori  Sit  tibi  Musa lyrae solers Cantor Apollo  It is worthy observation that in the satyrical picture of a frantick bard with which Horace con∣cludes his Epistle he not only runs counter to what might be expected as a Corollary of an Essay on  the Art of Poetry  but contradicts his own usual practice and sentiments In his Epistle to Augustus instead of stigmatizing the love of verse as an abominable phrensy he calls it  levis haec insania a slight mad∣ness  and descants on its good effects  quantas  VIR∣TUTES  habeat sic collige  In another Epistle speaking of himself and his addiction to poetry he says  ubi quid datur oti  Illudo chartis hoc est  MEDIOCRIBUS ILLIS  Ex vitiis unum  c  All which and several other passages in his works almost demonstrate that it was not without a par∣ticular purpose in view that he dwelt so forcibly on the description of a man resolved  in spite  Of nature and his stars to write  To conclude if I have not contemplated my system till I am become blind to its imperfections this view of the Epistle not only preserves to it all that  unity of subject and elegance of method  so much in∣sisted on by the excellent Critick to whom I have so often referred but by adding to his judicious general abstract the familiarities of personal address so strongly marked by the writer scarce a line ap∣pears idle or misplaced while the order and dispo∣sition of the Epistle to the Pisos appears as evident and unembarrassed as that of the Epistle to Au∣gustus in which last the actual state of the Roman Drama seems to have been more manifestly the object of Horace's attention than in the Work now under consideration  Before I leave you to the further examination of the original of Horace and submit to you the Translation with the Notes that accompany it I cannot help observing that the system which I have here laid down is not so entirely new as it may perhaps at first appear to the reader or as I myself originally supposed it No Critick indeed has to my know∣ledge directly considered  the whole Epistle  in the same light that I have now taken it but yet  parti∣cular passages  seem so strongly to enforce such an  interpretation that the Editors Translators and Commentators have been occasionally driven to ex∣planations of a similar tendency of which the Notes annexed will exhibit several striking instances  Of the following version I shall only say that I have not knowingly adopted a single expression tending to warp the judgement of the learned or un∣learned reader in favour of my own hypothesis I attempted this translation chiefly because I could find no other equally close and literal Even the Version of Roscommon though in blank verse is in some parts a paraphrase and in others but an ab∣stract I have myself indeed endeavoured to sup∣port my right to that force and freedom of translation which Horace himself recommends yet I have faithfully exhibited in our language several passages which his professed translators have abandoned as impossible to be given in English  All I think necessary to be further said on the Epistle will appear in the Notes  I am my dear friends With the truest respect and regard Your most sincere admirer And very affectionate humble servant GEORGE COLMAN  LONDON  March  Q HORATII FLACCI EPISTOLA AD PISONES  HUmano capiti cervicem pictor equinam  Jungere si velit et

if a Painter in his art to shine  A human head and horse's neck should join  From various creatures put the limbs together  Cover'd with plumes from ev'ry bird a feather  And in a filthy tail the figure drop  A fish at bottom a fair maid at top  Viewing a picture of this strange condition  Would you not laugh at such an exhibition  Trust me my Pisos wild as this may seem  The volume such where like a sickman's dream  Extravagant conceits throughout prevail  Gross and fantastick neither head nor tail  " Poets and Painters ever were allow'd  " Some daring flight above the vulgar croud"  True we indulge them in that daring flight  And challenge in our turn an equal right  But not the soft and savage to combine  Serpents to doves to tigers lambkins join  Oft works of promise large and high attempt  Are piec'd and guarded to escape contempt  With here and there a remnant highly drest  That glitters thro' the gloom of all the rest  Then Dian's grove and altar are the theme  Then thro' rich meadows winds the silver stream  The River Rhine perhaps adorns the lines  Or the gay Rainbow in description shines  These we allow have each their several grace  But each and several now are out of place  A cypress you can draw what then you're hir'd  And from your art a seapiece is requir'd  A shipwreck'd mariner despairing faint  The price paid down you are ordain'd to paint  On with your art proceed as you begun  Why dwindle to a cruet from a tun  Simple be all you execute and one  Lov'd sire lov'd sons well worthy such a sire  Most bards are dupes to beauties they admire  Proud to be brief for brevity must please  I grow obscure the follower of ease  Wants nerve and soul the lover of sublime  Swells to bombast while he who dreads that crime  Too fearful of the whirlwind rising round  A wretched reptile creeps along the ground  The bard ambitious fancies who displays  And tortures one poor thought a thousand ways  Heaps prodigies on prodigies in woods  Pictures the dolphin and the boar in stoods  Thus ev'n the fear of faults to faults betrays  Unless a masterhand conduct the lays  An under workman of th' Aemilian class  Shall mould the nails and trace the hair in brass  Bungling at last because his narrow soul  Wants room to comprehend  a perfect whole  To be this man would I a work compose  No more I'd wish than for a horrid nose  With hair as black as jet and eyes as black as sloes  Select all ye who write a subject fit  A subject not too mighty for your wit  And ere you lay your shoulders to the wheel  Weigh well their strength and all their weakness feel  He who his subject happily can chuse  Wins to his favour the benignant Muse  For him shall Eloquence her stores display  And beauteous Order trace and clear his way  Order I trust may boast nor boast in vain  These Virtues and these Graces in her train  What on the instant should be said to say  Things best reserv'd at present to delay  Guiding the bard thro' his continu'd verse  What to reject and when and what rehearse  To words establish'd by long usage true  With innovations or adoptions few  Happy your art if by a cunning phrase  To a new meaning a known word you raise  If calling from the dark abyss of time  " Things unattempted yet in prose or rhime"  Oft stern necessity exacts some word  By the straitlac'd Cethegi never heard  Take without blame yet take with coyness too  The licence to your arduous subject due  New or but recent words shall have their course  If drawn discreetly from the Grecian source  What Plautus and Cecilius safely claim  Shall Rome in Virgil and in Varius blame  Or if myself should some few words explore  Shall I be envied for my little store  Cato and Ennius while our style was young  With many a sterling phrase enrich'd our tongue  And We our Sires and Sons without a crime  May stamp on words the coinage of the time  As branching woods let fall and change their leaves  Our language too a change of words receives  Year after year drop off the ancient race  While young ones bud and flourish in their place  Nor we nor all we do can death withstand  Whether the Sea  imprison'd in the land  A work imperial takes a harbour's form  Where navies ride secure and mock the storm  Whether the Marsh  within whose horrid shore  Barrenness dwelt and boatmen plied the oar  Now furrow'd by the plough a laughing plain  Feeds all the cities round with fertile grain  Or if the River  by a prudent force  The corn once flooding learns a better course  The works of mortal man shall all decay  And words are grac'd and honour'd but a day  Many shall wake reviv'd that now lie dead  Many shall fade and all their glories shed  Custom alone their rank and date can teach  Custom the sov'reign law and rule of speech  For deeds of kings and chiefs and battles fought  What numbers are most fitting Homer taught  Couplets unequal were at first confin'd  To speak in broken verse the mourner's mind  Prosperity at length and free content  In the same numbers gave their raptures vent  But who first fram'd the Elegy's small song  Grammarians squabble and will squabble long  Archilochus resentment's bitter rage  Arm'd with his own Iambicks to engage  With these the humble Sock and Buskin proud  Shap'd dialogue and still'd the noisy croud  Embrac'd the measure prov'd its ease and force  And found it apt for business or discourse  Gods and the sons of Gods in Odes to sing  The Muse attunes her Lyre and strikes the string  Victorious Boxers Racers mark the line  The cares of youthful love and joys of wine  The various outline of each work to fill  If nature gives no pow'r and art no skill  If marking nicer shades I miss my aim  Why am I greet with a Poet's name  Or if thro' ignorance I can't discern  Why from false modesty forbear to learn  A comick incident loaths tragick strains  Thy feast Thyestes lowly verse disdains  Familiar diction scorns as base and mean  Touching too nearly on the comick scene  Each style allotted to its proper place  Let each appear with its peculiar grace  Yet Comedy at times exalts her strain  And angry Chremes storms in swelling vein  The tragick hero plung'd in deep distress  Sinks with his fate and makes his language less  Peleus and Telephus poor banish'd each  Drops his foothalffoot words and sounding speech  Or else what bosom in his grief takes part  Which cracks the ear but cannot touch the heart  'Tis not enough that Plays are polish'd chaste  Or trickt in all the harlotry of taste  They must have  ppassion  too beyond controul  Transporting where they please the hearer's soul  With those that smile our face in smiles appears  With those that weep our cheeks are bath'd in tears  To make  me  grieve be first  your  anguish shown  And I shall feel your sorrows like my own  Peleus and Telephus unless your style  Suit with your circumstance I'll sleep or smile  Features of sorrow mournful words require  Anger in menace speaks and words of fire  The playful prattle in a frolick vein  And the severe affect a serious strain  For Nature first to every varying wind  Of changeful fortune shapes the pliant mind  Sooths it with pleasure or to rage provokes  Or brings it to the ground by sorrow's heavy strokes  Then of the joys that charm'd or woes that wrung  Forces expression from the faithful tongue  But if the actor's words belie his state  And speak a language foreign to his fate  Romans shall crack their sides and all the town  Join horse and foot to laugh th' impostor down  Just  Dialogue  to every speaker fit  Their several rank and character should hit  Hero or God the Sire sedate and grave  Or the warm Youth to passion still a slave  Matron or Nurse the Merchant us'd to roam  Or Farmer ploughing his rich field at home  If Colchian or Assyrian fill the scene  Theban or Argian note the shades between  Follow the Voice of Fame or if you feign  The fabled plan consistently sustain  If Homer's hero you bring back to view  Shew your Achilles such as Homer drew  Active warm brave impetuous high of soul  Calling to arms and brooking no controul  Fierce let Medea seem in horrors clad  Perfidious be Ixion Ino sad  Io a wand'rer and Orestes mad  Should you advent'ring novelty engage  Some bold Original to tread the Stage  True to the parent mould in which 'twas cast  Sustain the character from first to last  Yet hard the task to touch on untried facts  Safer the Iliad to reduce to acts  Than be the first new regions to explore  And dwell on themes unknown untold before  Quit but the vulgar broad and beaten round  The publick field becomes your private ground  Nor word for word too faithfully translate  Nor leap at once into a narrow strait  A copyist so close that rule and line  Curb your free march and all your steps confine  Be not your opening fierce in accents bold  Like the rude balladmonger's chaunt of old  " The fall of Priam the great Trojan King  " Of the right noble Trojan War I sing"  Where ends this Boaster who with voice of thunder  Wakes Expectation all agape with wonder  The mountains labour hush'd are all the spheres  And oh ridiculous a mouse appears  How much more modestly begins HIS song  Who labours or imagines nothing wrong  " Say Muse the Man who after Troy's disgrace  " In various cities mark'd the human race"  Not flame to smoke he turns but smoke to light  Kindling from thence a stream of glories bright  Antiphates the Cyclops raise the theme  Scylla Charibdis fill the pleasing dream  He goes not back to Meleager's death  With Diomed's return to run you out of breath  Nor from the Double Egg the tale to mar  Traces the story of the Trojan War  Still hurrying to th' event at once he brings  His hearer to the heart and soul of things  And what won't bear the light in shadow flings  So well he feigns so well contrives to blend  Fiction and Truth that all his labours tend  True to one point persu'd from end to end  Hear now what I expect and all the town  If you would wish applause your play to crown  And patient fitters 'till the cloth goes down  Man's several ages  with attention view  His flying years and changing nature too  The Boy  who now his words can freely sound  And with a steadier footstep prints the ground  Places in playfellows his chief delight  Quarrels shakes hands and cares not wrong or right  Sway'd by each fav'rite bauble's shortliv'd pow'r  In smiles in tears all humours ev'ry hour  The beardless Youth  at length from tutor free  Loves horses hounds the field and liberty  Pliant as wax to vice his easy soul  Marble to wholesome counsel and controul  Improvident of good of wealth profuse  High fond yet fickle generous yet loose  To graver studies new pursuits inclin'd  Manhood  with growing years brings change of mind  Seeks riches friends with thirst of honour glows  And all the meanness of ambition knows  Prudent and wary on each deed intent  Fearful to act and afterwards repent  Evil in various shapes  Old Age  surrounds  Riches his aim in riches he abounds  Yet what he gain'd in fear he fears to lose  And what he sought as useful dares not use  Timid and cold in all he undertakes  His hand from doubt as well as weakness shakes  Hope makes him tedious fond of dull delay  Dup'd by tomorrow tho' he dies today  Illhumour'd querulous yet loud in praise  Of all the mighty deeds of former days  When  he  was young good heavens what glorious times  Unlike the present age that teems with crimes  Thus years advancing many comforts bring  And flying bear off many on their wing  Confound not youth with age nor age with youth  But mark their several characters with truth  Events are on the stage in act display'd  Or by narration if unseen convey'd  Cold is the tale distilling thro' the ear  Filling the soul with less dismay and fear  Than where spectators view like standersby  The deed submitted to the faithful eye  Yet force not on the stage to wound the sight  Acts that should pass within and shun the light  Many there are the eye should ne'er behold  But touching Eloquence in time unfold  Who on Medea's parricide can look  View horrid Atreus human garbage cook  If a bird's feathers I see Progne take  If I see Cadmus slide into a snake  My faith revolts and I condemn outright  The fool that shews me such a silly sight  Let not your play have  fewer acts  than  five  Nor  more  if you would wish it run and thrive  Draw down no God  unworthily betray'd  Unless some great occasion ask his aid  Let no  fourth person  labouring for a speech  Make in the dialogue a needless breach  An actor's part the CHORUS should sustain  Gentle in all its office and humane  Chaunting no Odes between the acts that seem  Unapt or foreign to the general theme  Let it to Virtue prove a guide and friend  Curb tyrants and the humble good defend  Loud let it praise the joys that Temperance waits  Of Justice sing the real health of States  The Laws and Peace secure with open gates  Faithful and secret let it heav'n invoke  To turn from the unhappy fortune's stroke  And all its vengeance on the proud provoke  The Pipe  of old as yet with brass unbound  Nor rivalling as now the Trumpet's sound  But slender simple and its stops but few  Breath'd to the Chorus and was useful too  No crouded seats wedg'd close and closer still  Then asking pow'rful blasts their space to fill  When the thin audience pious frugal chaste  With modest mirth indulg'd their sober taste  But soon as the proud Victor spurns all bounds  And growing Rome a wider wall surrounds  When noontide revels and the daylight bowl  Licence on holidays a flow of soul  A richer stream of melody is known  Numbers more copious and a fuller tone  For what alas could the unpractis'd ear  Of rusticks revelling o'er country cheer  A motley groupe high low and froth and scum  Distinguish but shrill squeak and dronish hum  The Piper grown luxuriant in his art  With dance and flowing vest embellishes his part  Now too its pow'rs increas'd  the Lyre severe  With richer numbers smites the list'ning ear  Sudden bursts forth a flood of rapid song  Rolling a tide of eloquence along  Useful prophetic wise the strain divine  Breathes all the spirit of the Delphick shrine  He who the prize a filthy goat to gain  At first contended in the tragick strain  Soon tootho' rude the graver mood unbroke  Stript the rough SATYRS and essay'd a joke  For holidayspectators flush'd and wild  With new conceits and mummeries were beguil'd  Yet should the Satyrs so chastise their mirth  Temp'ring the jest that gives their sallies birth  Changing from grave to gay so keep the mean  That God or Heroe of the lofty scene  In royal gold and purple seen but late  May ne'er in cots obscure debase his state  Lost in low language nor in too much care  To shun the ground grasp clouds and empty air  With an indignant pride and coy disdain  Stern Tragedy rejects too light a vein  Like a grave Matron destin'd to advance  On solemn festivals to join the dance  Mixt with the shaggy tribe of Satyrs rude  She'll hold a sober mien and act the prude  Ne'er would I Pisos in the Sylvan scene  Use abject terms alone and phrases mean  Nor of high Tragick colouring afraid  Neglect too much the difference of shade  Davus may jest pert Pythias may beguile  Simo of cash in a familiar style  The same low strain Silenus would disgrace  Servant and guardian of the Godlike race  Let me on subjects known my verse so frame  So follow it that each may hope the same  Daring the same and toiling to prevail  May vainly toil and only dare to fail  Such virtues order and connection bring  From common arguments such honours spring  The woodland Fauns their origin should heed  Take no town stamp nor seem the city breed  Nor let them aping young gallants repeat  Verses that run upon too tender feet  Nor fall into a low indecent stile  Breaking dull jests to make the vulgar smile  For higher ranks such ribaldry despise  Condemn the Poet and withhold the prize  To a short Syllable a long subjoin'd  Forms an Iambick foot so light a kind  That when six pure Iambicks roll'd along  So nimbly mov'd so trippingly the song  The feet to half their number lost their claim  And  Trimeter Iambicks  was their name  Hence that the measure might more grave appear  And with a slower march approach the ear  From the fourth foot and second not displac'd  The steady spondee kindly it embrac'd  Then in firm union socially unites  Admitting the ally to equal rights  Accius and Ennius lines thus duly wrought  In their bold Trimeters but rarely sought  Yet scenes o'erloaded with a verse of lead  A mass of heavy numbers on their head  Speak careless haste neglect in ev'ry part  Or shameful ignorance of the Poet's art  " Not ev'ry Critick spies a faulty strain  And pardon Roman Poets should disdain"  Shall I then all regard all labour slight  Break loose at once and all at random write  Or shall I fear that all my faults descry  Viewing my errors with an

reading the Epistle whether adverse or favourable to the idea I ventured to premise concerning its Subject and Design In the address to my learned and worthy friends I said little more than was necessary to open my plan and to offer an excuse for my undertaking The Notes descend to particulars tending to illustrate and confirm my hypothesis and adding occasional explanations of the original chiefly intended for the use of the English Reader I have endeavoured ac∣cording to the best of my ability to follow the advice of ROSCOMMON in the lines which I have ventured to prefix to these Notes How far I may be entitled to  the poetical blessing  promised by the Poet the Pub∣lick must determine but were I avoiding arrogance to renounce all claim to it such an appearance of  Modesty  would include a charge of  Impèrtinence  for having hazarded this publication  Take pains the  GENUINE MEANING  to explore  There sweat there strain tug the laborious oar  Search ev'ry comment  that your

THE work of Horace now under consideration has been so long known and so generally received by the name of  The Art of Poetry  that I have on account of that notoriety submitted this translation to the Publick under that title rather than what I hold to be the true one  viz Horace's  EPISTLE TO THE PISOS The Author of the English Commen∣tary has adopted the same title though directly re∣pugnant to his own system and I suppose for the very same reason  The title in general a matter of indifference is in the present instance of much consequence On the title Julius Scaliger founded his invidious and injudicious attack  De arte quaeres quid sentiam Quid equidem quod  DE ARTE SINE ARTE  traditâ  To  ehe Title  all the editors and commentators have  particularly adverted commonly preferring the Epistolary Denomination but in contradiction to that preference almost universally inscribing the Epistle  the Art of Poetry  The conduct however of JASON DE NORES a native of Cyprus a learned and ingenious writer of the th century is very remarkable In the year he published at Ve∣nice this work of Horace accompanied with a com∣mentary and notes written in elegant Latin in∣scribing it after Quintilian  Q Horatii Flacci  LIBER DE ARTE POETICA  I think it right to mention that I have never seen the first edition pub∣lished at Venice With a copy of the second edition printed at Paris I was favoured by Dr Warton of Winchester  The very next year how∣ever he printed at Paris a second edition enriching his notes with many observations on Dante and Pe∣trarch and changing the title after mature consi∣deration to  Q Horatii Flacci  EPISTOLA AD PISONES  de Arte Poeticâ  His motives for this change he as∣signs in the following terms  Quare adductum me primum sciant  AD INSCRIPTIO∣NEM OPERIS IMMUTANDAM  non levioribus de causis quod formam  EPISTOLAE  non autem  LIBRI  in quo praecepta tradantur vel ex ipso principio prae se ferat quod in vetustis exemplaribus Epistolarum libros sub∣sequatur  quod etiam summi et praestantissimi homines ita sentiant quod minimè nobis obstet Quintiliani testimonium ut nonnullis videtur Nam si  LIBRUM  appellat Quintilianus non est cur non possit inter  EPIS∣TOLAS  enumerari cum et illae ab Horatio in libros di∣gestae fuerint Quod vero  DE ARTE POETICA  idem Quintilianus adjungat nihil commoveor cùm et in  EPISTOLIS  praecepta de aliquâ re tradi possint ab eodem∣que in omnibus penè et in iis ad Scaevam Lollium praecipuè jam factum videatur in quibus breviter eos instituit quâ ratione apud majores facile versarentur  Since writing and first publishing the above I have seen the  first  Edi∣tion of DE NORES and find the title of the Epistle to be the same as in his  second  so that he here refers to his departure from the usage of others not to any variation from himself    Desprez the Dauphin Editor retains both titles but says inclining to the Epistolary  Attamen  ARTEM POETICAM  vix appellem cum Quintiliano et aliis ma∣lim vero  EPISTOLAM  nuncupare cum nonnullis eruditis  Monsieur Dacier inscribes it properly enough agree∣able to the idea of Porphyry  Q Horatii Flacci  DE ARTE POETICA LIBER  seu  EPISTOLA AD PI∣SONES PATREM ET FILIOS  Julius Scaliger certainly stands convicted of cri∣tical malice by his poor cavil at  the  SUPPOSED  title    and has betrayed his ignorance of the ease and beauty of Epistolary method as well as the most gross mis∣apprehension by his ridiculous analysis of the work resolving it into thirtysix parts He seems how∣ever to have not ill conceived the genius of the poem in saying that  it relished of  SATIRE This he has urged in many parts of his Poeticks parti∣cularly in the Dedicatory Epistle to his son not omitting however his constant charge of  Art with∣out Art Horatius  ARTEM  cum inscripsit  ADEO SINE ULLA DOCET ARTE UT SATYRAE PROPIUS TOTUM OPUS ILLUD ESSE VIDEATUR This comes almost home to the opinion of the Author of the elegant commentaries on the two Epistles of Horace to the Pisos and to Augustus as expressed in the Dedica∣cation to the latter With the recital of that opinion I shall conclude this long note  "The genius of Rome was bold and elevated but Criticism of any kind was little cultivated never professed as an  art  by this people The specimens we have of their ability in this way of which the most elegant beyond all dispute are the two epistles to  Augustus  and the  Pisos    are slight occasional at∣tempts  made in the negligence of common sense  and adapted to the peculiar exigencies of their own taste and learning  and not by any means the re∣gular  productions of  art  professedly bending itself to this work and ambitious to give the last finish∣ing to the critical system"  Translated from Horace  In that very entertain∣ing and instructive publication entitled  An Essay on the Learning and Genius of Pope  the Critick recom∣mends as the properest poetical measure to render in English the Satires and Epistles of Horace that kind of familiar blank verse used in a version of Terence attempted some years since by the Author of this translation I am proud of the compliment yet I have varied from the mode prescribed not be∣cause Roscommon has already given such a version or because I think the satyrical hexameters of Horace less familiar than the irregular Iambicks of Terence English Blank Verse like the Iambick of Greece and Rome is peculiarly adapted to theatrical action and dialogue as well as to the Epick and the more elevated Didactick Poetry but after the models left by DRYDEN and POPE and in the face of the living example of JOHNSON who shall venture to reject rhyme in the province of Satire and Epistle  TRUST ME MY PISOS  Credite Pisones  Monsieur Dacier at a very early period feels the influence of  the personal address  that governs this Epistle Remarking on this passage he observes that Horace anxious to inspire  the Pisos  with a just taste says earnestly  Trust me my Pisos Credite Pi∣sones  an expression that betrays fear and distrust left  the young Men  should fall into the dangerous error of bad poets and injudicious criticks who not only thought the want of unity of subject a pardon∣able effect of Genius but even the mark of a rich and luxuriant imagination And although this Epistle continues Monsieur Dacier is addressed in∣differently to Piso the father and his Sons as ap∣pears by v of the original yet it is  to the sons in particular  that these precepts are directed a con∣sideration which reconciles the difference mentioned by Porphyry  Scribit ad Pisones viros nobiles di∣sertosque patrem et filios vel ut alii volunt  AD PISONES FRATRES  Desprez the Dauphin Editor observes also in the same strain  Porro scribit Horatius ad patrem et filios Pisones  PRAESERTIM VERO AD HOS  The family of  the Pisos  to whom Horace ad∣dresses this Epistle were called Calpurnii being  descended from Calpus son of Numa Pompilius whence he afterwards styles them  of the Pompilian Blood Pompilius Sanguis  THE VOLUME SUCH LIBRUM  persimilem  Liber  observes Dacier is a term applied to all li∣terary productions of whatever description This remark is undoubtedly just confirms the sentiments of  Jason de Nores  and takes off the force of all the arguments founded on Quintilian's having stiled this Epistle LIBER  de arte poeticâ  Vossius speaking of the censure of Scaliger "  de arte sine arte  " subjoins  sed fallitur cum  putat esse ab Horatio qui inscripserat  EPISTOLAM AD PISONES  Argumentum vero ut in Epistolarum

Verse  as well as the Satires and  Art Poetique  of Boileau and Pope's  Essay on Criticism  abound with imitations of Horace This passage of our Author seems to have given birth to the follow∣ing lines of Buckingham  'Tis not a flash of fancy which sometimes  Dazzling our minds sets off the slightest rhimes  Bright as a blaze but in a moment done  True Wit is everlasting like the Sun  Which though sometimes behind a cloud retir'd  Breaks out again and is the more admir'd  The following lines of Pope may perhaps appear to bear a nearer resemblance to this passage of Ho∣race  Some to  Conceit  alone their taste confine  And glitt'ring thoughts struck out at ev'ry line  Pleas'd with a work where nothing's just or fit  One glaring chaos and wild heap of wit  Essay on Criticism  SIMPLE BE ALL YOU EXECUTE AND ONE  Denique sit quidvis simplex duntaxat unum  Supposing for a moment that the elder Piso had actually submitted some poetical effort to the judgement of Horace it is natural to con∣clude that the work was in our Poet's opinion of the character described in the opening of this Epistle studded with brilliant thoughts and adorned with flowery passages but void of plan inco∣herent  irregular and on the whole lame and imperfect    Of th' Aemilian class    Aemilium circa ludum  literally  near the Aemilian School  al∣luding to the Academy of Gladiators of Aemilius Lentulus in whose neighbourhood lived many Ar∣tists and Shopkeepers  Pope has given a beautiful illustration of this thought  Survey THE WHOLE nor seek slight faults to find  Where nature moves and rapture warms the mind  In wit as Nature what affects our hearts  Is not th' exactness of peculiar parts  'Tis not a lip or eye we beauty call  But the joint force and full result of all  Thus when we view some wellproportion'd dome  The world's just wonder and ev'n thine O Rome  No single parts unequally surprise  All comes united to th' admiring eyes  No monstrous height or breadth or length appear  THE WHOLE at once is bold and regular  Essay on Criticism  SELECT ALL YE WHO WRITE A SUBJECT FIT  Sumite materiam c  This passage is well imitated by Roscommon in his Essay on Translated Verse  The first great work a talk perform'd by few  Is that  yourself  may to  yourself  be true  No mask no tricks no favour no reserve  Dissect  your mind examine ev'ry  nerve  Each poet with a different talent writes  One  praises  one  instructs  another  bites  Horace did ne'er aspire to Epick Bays  Nor lofty Maro stoop to Lyrick Lays  Examine how your  humour  is inclin'd  And which the ruling passion of your mind  Stooping  to Lyrick Lays though not inapplicable to some of the lighter odes of Horace is not descrip∣tive of the general character of the Lyrick Muse  Musa dedit Fidibus Divos c  Pope takes up the same thought in his Essay on Criticism  Be sure yourself and your own reach to know  How far your genius taste and learning go  Launch not beyond your depth but be discreet  And mark that point where sense and dulness meet  Like Kings we lose the conquests gain'd before  By vain ambition still to make them more  Each might his servile province well command  Would all but stoop to what they understand    A cunning phrase    Callida junctura  Jason de Nores  and many other interpreters agree that Horace here recommends after Aristotle the artful elevation of style by the use of common words in an uncommon sense producing at once an air of familiarity and magnificence Some however con∣fine the expression  callida junctura  to signify  com∣pound words  The Author of the English Commen∣tary adopts the first construction but considers the precept in both senses and illustrates each by many beautiful examples from the plays of Shakespeare These examples he has accompanied with much ele∣gant and judicious observation as the reader of  taste will be convinced by the following short ex∣tracts  The writers of that time had so  latinized  the English language that the pure  English Idiom  which Shakespeare generally follows has all the air of  novelty  which other writers are used to affect by foreign phraseologyIn short the articles here enumerated are but so many ways of departing from the usual and simpler forms of speech without neglecting too much the grace of ease and perspicuity in which welltempered li∣cence one of the greatest charms of all poetry but especially of Shakespeare's poetry consists Not that he was always and every where so happy His expression sometimes and by the very means here exemplified becomes  hard ob∣scure  and  unnatural  This is the extreme on the other side But in general we may say that He hath either followed the direction of Horace very ably or hath hit upon his rule very happily  THE STRAITLAC'D CETHEGI CINC∣TUTIS  Cethegis  Jason De Nores differs and I think very justly from those who interpret  Cinctutis  to signify  loose bare  or  naked  EXERTOS NUDOS The plain sense of the radical word  cingo  is directly opposite The word  cinctutis  is here assumed to express a severity of manners by an allusion to an antique gravity of dress and the Poet adds  De Nores  very happily forms a new word himself as a vindication and example of the licence he recom∣mends Cicero numbers M Corn Cethegus among the old Roman Orators and Horace himself again refers to the Cethegi in his Epistle to Florus and on the subject of the use of words  Obscurata diu papulo bonus eruet atque  Proferet in lucem speciosa vocabula rerum  Quae priscis memorata  CATONIBUS  atque  CETHEGIC  Nunc situs informis premit deserta vetustas  Adsciscet nova quae genitor produxerit usus  Mark where a bold expressive phrase appears  Bright thro' the rubbish of some hundred years  Command  old words  that long have slept to wake  Words that wise Bacon or brave Raleigh spake  Or bid  the new  be English ages hence  For Use will father what's begot by Sense  POPE  This brilliant passage of Pope is quoted in this place by the author of the English Commentary  who has also subjoined many excellent remarks on  the revival of old words  worthy the particular atten∣tion of those who cultivate prose as well as poetry and shewing at large that  "the riches of a language are actually increased by retaining its old words and besides they have often  a greater real weight and dignity  than those of a more  fashionable  cast which succeed to them This needs no proof to such as are versed in the earlier writings of any language""  The growing prevalency of a very different humour  first catched as it should seem from our commerce with the French Models  and countenanced by the too scrupulous delicacy of  SOME GOOD WRITERS AMONGST OURSELVES  had gone far towards unnerving the noblest modern language and effeminating the public taste  ""The rejection of  old wards  as  barbarous  and of many modern ones "as unpolite" had so exhausted the  strength  and  stores  of our language that it was high time for some masterhand to interpose and send us for supplies to  our old poets  which there is the highest authority for saying no one ever despised but for a reason not very consistent with his credit to avow  rudem esse omnino in nostris poetis aut  INERTISSIMAE NEQUITIAE  est aut  FASTI∣DII  DELICATISSIMI    Cic de sin  l i c "  AS BRANCHING WOODS c  Ut silvae foliis  c  Mr Duncombe in his translation of our Author concurs with Monsieur Dacier in observing that  "Horace seems here to have had in view that fine similitude of Homer in the sixth book of the Iliad comparing the generations of men to the annual succession of leaves"  Like leaves on trees the race of man is found  Now green in youth now withering on the ground  Another race the following spring supplies  They fall successive and successive rise  So generations in their turns decay  So flourish these when those are past away  POPE  The translator of Homer has himself compared words to leaves but in another view in his Essay on Criticism  Words are like leaves and where they most abound  Much fruit of sense beneath is rarely found  In another part of the Essay he pursues the same train of thought with Horace and rises I think above his Master  Short is the date alas of modern rhymes  And 'tis but just to let them live betimes  No longer now that golden age appears  When Patriarchwits surviv'd a thousand years  Now length of Fame our second life is lost  And bare threescore is all ev'n that can boast  Our sons their father's failing language see  And such as Chaucer is shall Dryden be  So when the faithful pencil has design'd  Some bright idea of the Master's mind  Where a new world leaps out at his command  And ready Nature waits upon his hand  When the ripe

Agrippa under his auspices  Regis opus  Both these lakes says Martin were in Campania the former was destroyed by an earthquake but the latter is the present  Lago d'Averno  Strabo the Geographer who as well as our Poet was living at the time ascribes this work to Agrippa and tells us that the Lucrine bay was separated from the Tyrrhene sea by a mound said to have been first made by Hercules and restored by Agrippa Philargyrius says that a storm arose at the time of the execution of this great work to which Virgil seems to refer in his mention of this Port in the course of his Panegyrick on Italy in the second Georgick  An memorem Portus  LUCRINOQUE  addita claustra  Atque indignatum magnis stridoribus aequor  Julia quà ponto longe sonat unda refuso  Tyrrhenusque fretis immittitur aestus

KINGS  c    Res gestae regumque c  The ingenious author of the English Commen∣tary to whom I have so often referred and to whom I must continue to refer has discovered particular taste judgement and address in his explication of this part of the Epistle It runs thus  From reflections on  poetry at large  he pro∣ceeds now to  particulars  the most obvious of  which being the different  forms  and  measures  of poetick composition he considers in this view from v to the four great species of po∣etry to which all others may be reduced  the Epick Elegiack Dramatick and Lyrick  But the distinction of the  measure  to be observed in the several species is so obvious that there can scarcely be any mistake about them The diffi∣culty is to know from v to how far each may partake of the  spirit  of the other without destroying that  natural and necessary difference  which ought to subsist betwixt them all To ex∣plain this which is a point of great nicety he considers from v to the case of Drama∣tick Poetry the two species of which are as di∣stinct from each other as any two can be and yet there are times when the features of the one will be allowed to resemble those of the otherBut the Poet had a further view in chusing this instance For he gets by this means into the main of his subject which was Dramatick Poetry and by the most delicate transition imaginable proceeds from to to deliver a series of rules interspersed with historical accounts  and enlivened by digressions  for the regulation of the ROMAN STAGE  It is needless to insist that my hypothesis will not allow me to concur entirely in the latter part of this extract at least in that latitude to which the system of the writer carries it yet I perfectly agree with Mr Duncombe that the learned Critick in his observation on this Epistle  "has shewn in gene∣ral the connection and dependence of one part with another in a clearer light than any other Commentator"  His shrewd and delicate commen∣tary is indeed a most elegant contrast to the bar∣barous analysis of Scaliger drawn up without the least idea of poetical transition and with the uncouth air of a mere dry logician or dull grammarian I think however the  Order  and  Method  observed in this Epistle is stricter than has yet been observed and that the  series of rules  is delivered with great re∣gularity NOT  enlivened by digressions  but passing from one topick to another by the most natural and easy transitions The Author's discrimination of the different stiles of the several species of poetry leads him as has been already shewn to consider THE DICTION of the Drama and its accommoda∣tion to the  circumstances  and  character  of the Speaker A recapitulation of these  circumstances  carries him to treat of the due management of  characters already known  as well as of sustaining those that are entire∣ly  original  to the first of which the Poet gives the preference recommending  known  CHARACTERS as well as  known  SUBJECTS And on the mention of this joint preference the Author leaves further con∣sideration of  the  DICTION and slides into discourse upon  the  FABLE which he continues down to the d versa  Atque ita mentitur sic veris falsa remiscet  Primo ne medium medio ne discrepet imum  Having dispatched  the  FABLE the Poet proceeds and with some Solemnity of Order to the conside∣ration of  the  CHARACTERS not in regard to suit∣able  diction  for of that he has already spoken but in respect to  the manners  and in this branch of his subject he has as judiciously borrowed from  the Rhe∣toricks  of Aristotle as in the rest of his Epistle from the  Poeticks  He then directs in its due place the proper conduct of particular INCIDENTS  of the fable  after which he treats of the CHORUS from whence he naturally falls into the  history  of theatrical MU∣SICK which is as naturally succeeded by an ac∣count of the Origin of  the Drama  itself which the Poet commences like his master Aristotle even from the Dithyrambick Song and carries it down  to the establishment of the New Greek Comedy from whence he passes easily and gracefully to  the  ROMAN STAGE acknowledging the merits of the Writers but pointing out their defects and assign∣ing the causes He then subjoins a few general ob∣servations and concludes his long discourse on  the  DRAMA having extended it to lines This discourse together with the result of all his reflec∣tions on Poets and Poetry he then applies in the most earnest and  personal  manner to  the  ELDER PISO and with a long and most pathetick  peroration  if I may adopt an oratorical term concludes the Epistle  THE ELEGY's SMALL SONG EXI∣GUOS  Elegos  Commentators differ concerning the import of this expressionEXIGUOS  Elegos the Elegy's  small  song  De Nores Schrevelius and Desprez think it refers to the humility of the elegiack stile and subjects compared with epick or lyrick sublimity Monsieur Dacier rather thinks that Horace refers here as in the words  Versibus impariter junctis  "Couplets unequal" to the use of the pentameter or short verse consisting of five feet and joined to the hexameter or long verse of six This inequality  of the couplet Monsieur Dacier justly prefers to the two long Alexandrines of his own country which sets almost all the French poetry Epick Dramatick Elegiack or Satyrick to the tune of  Derry Down  In our language the measures are more various and more happily conceived Our Elegy adopts not only  unequal couplets  but  alternate rhymes  which give a plaintive tone to the heroick measure and are most happily used in Gray's beau∣tiful  Elegy in a Country Church yard  THY FEAST THYESTES  Coena Thyestae  The story of Thyestes being of the most tragick nature a banquet on his own children is com∣monly interpreted by the Criticks as mentioned by Horace in allusion to Tragedy in general The Author of the English Commentary however is of a different opinion supposing from a passage of Cicero that the Poet means to glance at the  Thyestes  of  Ennius  and to pay an oblique compliment to  Varius  who had written a tragedy on the same sub∣ject  The same learned Critick also takes it for granted that the Tragedy of  Telephus  and probably of  Pe∣leus  after mentioned point at tragedies of Euripi∣des  on these subjects translated into Latin and accommodated to the Roman Stage without success by  Ennius Accius  or  Noevius  One of the Critick's notes on this part of the Epistle treating on the use of  pure poetry  in the Drama abounds with curious disquisition and refined criti∣cism    They

divide the life of man into SEVEN AGES viz  In∣fancy Childhood Puberty Youth Manhood Old  Age  and  Decrepitude    "which last says De Nores in some sort answers to Infancy"  or as Shakespere expresses it IS SECOND CHILDISH∣NESS  "Before Shakespeare's time says Warburton  seven acts  was no unusual division of a play so that there is a greater beauty than appears at first sight in this image"  Mr Steevens however informs us that the plays of that early period were not di∣vided into acts at all It is most probable therefore that Shakespeare only copied the moral philosophy the  Socraticae chartae  of his own day adapting it like Aristotle and Horace to his own purpose and I think with more felicity than either of his il∣lustrious predecessors by contriving to introduce and discriminate  every one of  THE SEVEN AGES This he has effected by assigning STATION and CHA∣RACTER to some of the stages which to Aristotle and Horace appeared too similar to be distinguished from each other Thus PUBERTY YOUTH MAN∣HOOD and OLD AGE become under Shakespeare's hand  the  LOVER  the  SOLDIER  the  JUSTICE and the lean and slipper'd PANTALOON while the  natu∣tural qualities  of the

stage And so indeed it appeared to some few writers The most admired of the French tragick poets ventured to introduce it into two of his latter plays and with such success that as one observes  It

CHORO  nihil disserui quia non est essentialis dramati atque à neotricis pe∣nitus  ET ME JUDICE MERITO REPUDIATUR Prael Poet vol ii p Whence it hath come to pass that the Chorus hath been thus ne∣glected is not now the enquiry But that this critick and all such are greatly out in their judg∣ments when they presume to censure it in the ancients must appear if we look no further from the double use insisted on by the poet For A  Chorus  interposing and bearing a part in the progress of the action gives the representation that probability  Quel avantage ne peut il le poete pas tirer

ne sent que trop le vuide de notre Theatre sans choeurs c  Les Theatre des Grecs vol i p  and striking resemblance of  real life which every man of sense perceives and  feels  the want of upon our stage a want which nothing but such an expedient as the Chorus can possibly relieve And The importance of its other office l to the  utility  of the repre∣sentation is so great that in a moral view no∣thing can compensate for this deficiency For it is necessary to the truth and decorum of cha∣racters that the  manners  bad as well as good be drawn in strong vivid colours and to that end that immoral sentiments forcibly expressed and speciously maintained be sometimes  imputed  to the speakers Hence the sound philosophy of the Chorus will be constantly wanting to rectify the wrong conclusions of the audience and pre∣vent the ill impressions that might otherwise be made upon it Nor let any one say that the au∣dience is well able to do this for itself Euripides did not find even an Athenian theatre so quick∣sighted The story is well known Sen Ep that when this painter of the  manners  was obliged by the rules of his art and the character to be sustained to put a run of bold sentiments in the mouth of one of his persons the people instantly took fire charging the poet with the  imputed  vil∣lainy as though it had been his  own  Now if  such an audience could so easily misinterpret an attention to the truth of character into the real doctrine of the poet and this too when a Chorus was at hand to correct and disabuse their judg∣ments what must be the case when the  whole  is left to the sagacity and penetration of the people The wiser sort it is true have little need of this information Yet the reflections of sober sense on the course and occurrences of the representa∣tion clothed in the noblest dress of poetry and enforced by the joint powers of  harmony  and  action  which is the true character of the Chorus might make it even to such a no unpleasant or unpro∣fitable entertainment But these  two  are a small part of the  uses  of the Chorus which in every light is seen so important to the truth decorum and dignity of the tragick scene that the  modern  stage which hath not thought proper to adopt it is even with the advantage of sometimes the justest moral painting and sublimest imagery but a very faint shadow of the  old  as must needs appear to those who have looked into the ancient models or divesting themselves of modern pre∣judices are disposed to consult the dictates of plain sense For the use of such I once designed to have drawn into one view the several important  benefits arising to the drama from the observance of this rule but have the pleasure to find myself prevented by a sensible dissertation of a good French writer which the reader will find  in the  VIII  tom of the History of the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles Lettres  Or it may be sufficient to refer the English reader to the late tragedies of EL∣FRIDA and CARACTACUS which do honour to modern poetry and are a better apology than any I could make for the ancient Chorus  Notes on the Art of Poetry  This and all the extracts which are quoted  Notes on the Art of Poetry  are taken from the Author of the English Commentary    Though it is not my intention to agitate in this place the long disputed question concerning the ex∣pediency or inexpediency of the CHORUS yet I cannot dismiss the above note without some farther observation In the first place then I cannot think that  the judgment of two such Crikicks  as Aristotle and Horace can be decisively quoted as  concurring with the practice of wise antiquity  TO ESTABLISH THE CHORUS Neither of these  two Criticks  have taken up the question each of them giving directions for the proper conduct of  the  CHORUS considered as an established and received part of Tragedy and indeed  originally as they both tell us  the whole  of it Aristotle in his Poeticks has hot said much on the subject and from the little he has said more arguments might perhaps be drawn in favour of the omission than for the introduction of  the  CHORUS It is true that he says in his th chapter that  "Tragedy after many changes paused  having  gained its natural form  "  This might at first sight seem to include his approbation of  the  CHORUS as well as of all the other parts of Tragedy then in use but he himself expressly tells us  in the very same chapter  that he had no such meaning saying that  "to enquire whether Tragedy be perfect in its parts either considered in itself or with relation to the theatre was foreign to his present pur∣pose  "  In the passage from which Horace has in the verses now before us described the office and laid down the duties of the CHORUS the passage re∣ferred to by the learned Critick the words of Ari∣stotle are not particularly favourable to the institution  or much calculated to recommend the use of it For Aristotle there informs us  "that Sopho∣cles alone of all the Grecian writers made  the  CHORUS conducive to the progress of the fable not only even Euripides being culpable in this instance but other writers after the example of Agathon introducing Odes as little to the pur∣pose as if they had borrowed whole scenes from another play  "  On the whole therefore whatever may be the merits or advantages of  the  CHORUS I cannot think that the judgment of Aristotle or Horace can be adduced in recommendation of it As to  the  PRO∣BABILITY  given to the representation by the  CHORUS  interposing and bearing a part in the action  the Pub∣lick who have lately seen a troop of singers assembled on the stage as a CHORUS during the whole re∣presentations of ELFRIDA and CARACTACUS are  competent to decide for themselves how far such an expedient gives a more  striking resemblance of human life  than the common usage of our Drama As to its importance in a  moral  view to correct the evil impression of vicious sentiments  imputed  to the speak∣ers the story told to enforce its use for this pur∣pose conveys a proof of its inefficacy To give due force to sentiments as well as to direct their proper tendency arises from the skill and address of the Poet independent of  the  CHORUS  Monsieur Dacier as well as the author of the above note censures the modern stage for having rejected  the  CHORUS and having lost thereby  at least half its probability and its  GREATEST ORNAMENT so that our Tragedy is  but a very faint shadow of the  OLD Learned Criticks however do not perhaps con∣sider that if it be expedient to revive  the  CHORUS all the other parts of the Antient Tragedy must be revived along with it Aristotle mentions MUSICK as one of the six parts of Tragedy and Horace no sooner introduces  the  CHORUS but he proceeds to  the  PIPE  and  LYRE If a CHORUS be really ne∣cessary our Dramas like those of the Antients should be rendered wholly  musical  the  Dancers  also will then claim their place and the pretensions of  Vestris and Noverre must be admitted as  classical  Such a spectacle if not more  natural  than the mo∣dern would at least be consistent but to introduce a groupe of  spectatorial actors  SPEAKING in one part of the Drama and SINGING in another is as strange and incoherent a medley and full as unclassical as the dialogue and airs of  the  BEGGAR's OPERA    Chaunting no Odes between the acts that seem  UNAPT  or  FOREIGN  to the  GENERAL THEME  Nec quid medios c  On this passage the author of the English Com∣mentary thus remarks  "How necessary this ad∣vice might be to the writers of the Augustan age cannot certainly appear but if the practice of Seneca may give room for suspicion it should seem to have been much wanted in whom I scarcely believe  there is  ONE SINGLE INSTANCE of  the  CHORUS being employed in a manner conso∣nant to its true end and character"  The learned Critick seems here to believe and the plays under the name of Seneca in some measure  warrant the conclusion that  the  CHORUS of the Roman Stage was not calculated to answer the ends of its institution Aristotle has told us just the same thing with an exception in favour of Sophocles of the Grecian Drama And are such surmises or such information likely to strengthen our prejudices on behalf of  the  CHORUS or to inflame our desires for its revival  LET IT TO VIRTUE PROVE A GUIDE AND FRIEND  Ille bonis faveatque c  The Chorus  says the poet  is to take the side of the good and virtuous  i e is always to sustain a moral character But this will need some expla∣nation and restriction To conceive aright of its office we must suppose the  Chorus  to be a number of persons by some probable cause assembled to∣gether as witnesses and spectators of the great ac∣tion of the drama Such persons as they cannot be wholly uninterested in what passes before them will very naturally bear some share in the repre∣sentation This will principally consist in de∣claring their sentiments and indulging their re∣flections freely on the several events and distresses  as they shall arise Thus we see the  moral  attri∣buted to the Chorus will be no other than the dictates of plain sense such as must be obvious to every thinking observer of the action who is under the influence of no peculiar partialities from  affection  or  interest  Though even these may be supposed in cases where the character towards which they  draw  is represented as virtuous  A Chorus thus constituted must always it is evident take the part of virtue because this is the natural and almost necessary determination of mankind in all ages and nations when acting freely and unconstrained  Notes on the Art of Poetry  FAITHFUL AND SECRET  Ille tegat commissa  On this  nice part  of the duty of  the  CHORUS the author of the English Commentary thus remarks  This important advice is not always easy to be followed Much indeed will depend on the choice of the subject and the artful constitution of the fable  Yet with all his care the ablest writer will sometimes find himself embarrassed by the  CHORUS  I would here be understood to speak chiefly of the moderns For the antients though it has not been attended to had some peculiar advantages over us in this respect resulting from the princi∣ples and practices of those times For as it hath been observed of the ancient Epic Muse that she borrowed much of her state and dignity from the false  theology  of the pagan world so I think it may be justly said of the ancient tragic that she has derived great advantages of probability from its mistaken  moral  If there be truth in this re∣flection it will help to justify some of the ancient choirs that have been most objected to by the moderns  After two examples from Euripides in one of which the trusty CHORUS conceals the premeditated  suicide  of Phaedra and in the other abets Medea's intended  murder of her children  both which are most ably vindicated by the Critick the note concludes in these words  In sum though these acts of severe avenging justice might not be according to the express letter of the laws or the more refined conclusions of the PORCH or ACADEMY yet there is no doubt that they were in the general account esteemed  fit and reasonable And it is to be observed in order to pass a right judgment on the ancient Chorus that though in virtue of their office they were obliged universally to sustain a moral character yet this moral was rather political and popular than strictly legal or philosophic Which is also founded on good reason The scope and end of the ancient theatre being to serve the in∣terests of virtue and society on the principles and sentiments already spread and admitted amongst the people and not to correct old errors and in∣struct them in philosophic truth  One of the censurers of Euripides whose opinion is controverted in the above note is Monsieur Da∣cier who condemns  the  CHORUS in this instance as not only violating their  moral  office but  transgressing the laws of  NATURE  and of  GOD  by a fidelity  so VICIOUS and CRIMINAL  that these women    the  CHORUS  ought to fly away in the Car of Medea to escape the punishment due to them  The Annotator above agrees with the Greek Scholiast that  the Co∣rinthian women    the  CHORUS  being free  properly desert the interests of Creon and keep Medea's se∣crets  for the sake of justice  according to their custom Dacier however urges an instance of their infidelity  in the Ion of Euripides where they betray the secret of Xuthus to Creusa which the French Critick de∣fends on account of their attachment to their mis∣tress and adds that the rule of Horace like other rules is proved by the exception  "Besides con∣tinues the Critick in the true spirit of French gal∣lantry should we so heavily accuse the Poet for not having made  an assembly of women  KEEP A SE∣CRET"  D'ailleurs peut on faire un si grand crime à un poete de n'avoir pas fait en sorte qu'une troupe de femmes garde un secret  He then concludes his note with blaming Euripides for the perfidy of Iphigenia at Tauris who abandons these faithful guardians of her secret by flying alone with Orestes and leav∣ing them to the fury of Thoas to which they must have been exposed but for the intervention of Mi∣nerva  On the whole it appears that the  moral importance  of  the  CHORUS must be considered  with some limita∣tions  or at least that  the  CHORUS is as liable to be misused and misapplied as any part of modern Tragedy    The  PIPE  of oldTibi non ut nunc c  This says the author of the English Com∣mentary is one of those many passages in the epistle about which the critics have said a great deal without explaining any thing In support of what I mean to offer as the true interpreta∣tion I observe  That the poet's intention certainly was not to censure the  false  refinements of their stagemusic but in a short digressive history such as the di∣dactic form will sometimes require to describe the rise and progress of the  true  This I collect From  the expression itself  which cannot with∣out violence be understood in any other way For as to the words  licentia  and  praeceps  which have occasioned much of the difficulty the  first  means a  freer use  not a  licentiousness  properly so called and the  other  only expresses a vehemence and rapidity of language naturally productive of a quicker elocution such as must of course attend the more numerous harmony of the lyrenot as M Dacier translates it  une eloquence temeraire et outrêe  an extravagant straining and affectation of style From  the reason of the thing  which makes it incredible that the music of the theatre should then be most complete when the times were barbarous and entertainments of this kind little  encouraged or understood From  the character of that music itself  for the rudeness of which Ho∣race in effect apologizes in defending it only on the score of the imperfect state of the stage and the simplicity of its judges  The above interpretation of this part of the Epistle is in my opinion extremely just and exactly cor∣responds with the explication of De Nores who cen∣sures Madius for an error similar to that of Dacier  Non rectè sentire videtur Madius dum putat potius  IN ROMANORUM LUXURIAM  invectum Horatium quam  DE MELODIAE INCREMENTO  tractasse  THE MUSICK having always been a necessary appendage to  the  CHORUS I cannot as has already been hinted in the note on l of this version consider the Poet's notice of the Pipe and Lyre as a  digression  notwithstanding it includes a short his¦tory of the rude simplicity of the Musick in th  earlier ages of Rome and of its subsequent improve∣ments  The  CHORUS too being originally  the whole  as well as afterwards a legitimate  part  of Tragedy the Poet naturally traces the Drama from its origin to its most perfect state in Greece and afterwards compares its progress and improvements with the  Theatre of his own country Such is I think the natural and easy  method  pursued by Horace though it differs in some measure from the  order  and  con∣nection  pointed out by the author of the English Commentary  For what alas could the unpractis'd ear  Of rusticks revelling o'er country cheer  A motley groupe high low and froth and scum  Distinguish but shrill squeak and dronish hum  Indoctus quid enim saperet liberque laborum  Rusticus urbano canfusus turpis honesto  These lines rather breaking in upon the continuity of the history of theatrical musick create some ob∣scurity which has given birth to various interpreta∣tions The author of the English Commentary who always endeavours to dive to the very bottom of his subject understands this couplet of Horace as a  sneer  on those grave philosophers who considered these  refinements  of the musick as  corruptions  He inter∣prets the passage at large and explains the above two lines in these words  "Nor let it be objected than this  freer harmony  was itself an abuse a corruption  of the severe and  moral  musick of antient times Alas we were not as yet so  wise  to see the inconveniences of this improvement And how should we considering the nature and end of these theatrical entertainments and the sort of men of which our theatres were made up"  This interpretation is ingenious but Jason De Nores gives I think a more easy and unforced ex∣planation of this difficult passage by supposing it to refer by way of  parenthesis  to what had just been said of the original rude simplicity of the Roman theatrical musick which says the Poet was at least as polished and refined as the taste of the au∣dience This De Nores urges in two several notes both which I shall submit to the reader leaving it to him to determine how far I am to be justified in having adapted my version to his interpretation  The first of these notes contains at large his re∣proof of Madius for having like Dacier supposed the Poet to censure the improvements that he mani∣festly meant to commend  Quare non rectè videtur sentire Madius dum putat potius in Romanorum luxuriam invectum Horatium quàm de melodiae incremento tractasse cùm  SEIPSUM  INTERPRETANS  quid sibi voluerit per haec luce cla∣rius ostendat  Tibia non ut nunc orichalco vincta tubaeque Aemula  Et  Sic priscae motumque luxuriam addidit arti

applied by way of comment on this passage itself  INDOCTUS QUIDENIM SAPERET  Reddit ra∣tionem  QUASI PER DIGRESSIONEM  occurrens tacitae objectioni  QUARE ANTEA APUD ROMANOS MUSICA MELODIA PARVA AUT

VERBIS IM∣PERITIAM EORUM RUSTICITATEMQUE DEMON∣STRAT  Upon the whole De Nores appears to me to have given the true sense of the passage I am no friend to licentious transpositions or arbitrary variations of an author's text yet I confess I was strongly tempted in order to elucidate this perplexed passage to have carried these two lines of Horace four lines back and to have inserted them immediately after the th verse  Et frugi castus verecundusque coibat  The English reader who wishes to try the expe∣riment is desired to read the four lines that compose my version immediately after the th line  With modest mirth indulg'd their sober taste  THE PIPER  grown luxuriant in his art    Now too its powers increas'd  THE LYRE SEVERE  Sic priscaearti  TIBICEN c  SIC FIDIBUS c  This is the application of what hath been said in general concerning the refinement of theatri∣cal music to the case of  tragedy  Some commen∣tators say and to  comedy  But in this they mis∣take as will appear presently M  Dacier  hath I know not what conceit about a comparison be∣twixt the  Roman  and  Greek  stage His reason is  that the lyre was used in the Greek Chorus as appears  he says  from Sophocles himself playing upon this in∣strument himself in one of his tragedies  And was it not used too in the Roman Chorus as appears from Nero's playing upon it in several tragedies But the learned critic did not apprehend this matter Indeed from the caution with which his guides the dealers in antiquities always touch this point it should seem that they too had no very clear conceptions of it The case I take to have been this The  tibia  as being most proper to accompany the declamation of the acts  can∣tanti succinere  was constantly employed as well in the Roman tragedy as comedy This appears from many authorities I mention only two from  Cicero  Quam multa  Acad l ii  quae nos fu∣giunt in cantu exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati Qui primo inflatu Tibicinis Antiopam esse aiunt aut An∣dromacham cum nos ne suspicemur quidem  The other is still more express In his piece entitled  Orator  speaking of the negligence of the Roman writers in respect of  numbers  he observes  that there were even many passages in their tragedies which unless the  TIBIA  played to them could not be dlstinguished from mere prose quae nisi cum Ti∣bicen accesserit orationi sint solutoe simillima  One of these passages is expressly quoted from  Thyestes  a tragedy of  Ennius  and as appears from the measure taken out of one of the acts It is clear then that the  tibia  was certainly used in the  de∣clamation  of tragedy But now the song of the tragic chorus being of the nature of the ode of course required  fides  the lyre the peculiar and appropriated instrument of the lyric muse And this is clearly collected if not from express tes∣timonies yet from some occasional hints dropt by the antients For the lyre we are told Cic De Leg ii and is agreed on all hands was an instrument of the Roman theatre but it was not employed in comedy This we certainly know from the short account of the  music prefixed to Terence's plays Further the  tibicen  as we saw accompanied the declama∣tion of the acts in tragedy It remains then that the proper place of the lyre was where one should naturally look for it in the songs of the Chorus but we need not go further than this very passage for a proof It is unquestionable that the poet is here speaking of the Chorus only the following lines not admitting any other possible interpreta∣tion By  fidibus  then is necessarily understood the instrument peculiarly used in it Not that it need be said that the  tibia  was never used in the Chorus The contrary seems expressed in a passage of Se∣neca Ep lxxxiv and in Julius Pollux l iv § It is sufficient if the  lyre  was used sole∣ly or principally in it at this time In this view the whole digression is more pertinent and con∣nects better The poet had before been speaking of tragedy All his directions from l respect this species of the drama only The application of what he had said concerning music is then most naturally made to the  tibia  the music of the acts and to  fides  that of the choir thus confining himself as the tenor of this part re∣quired to tragedy only Hence is seen the mis∣take not only of M Dacier whose comment is  in every view insupportable but as was hinted of Heinsius Lambin and others who with more probability explained this of the Roman comedy and tragedy For though  tibia  might be allowed to stand for comedy as opposed to  tragoedia  as in fact we find it in l ii Ep that being the only instrument employed in it yet in speak∣ing expresly of the music of the stage  fides  could not determinately enough and in contradistinction to  tibia  denote that of tragedy it being an instru∣ment used solely or principally in the Chorus of which the context shews he alone speaks It is further to be observed that in the applica∣tion here made besides the music the poet takes in the other improvements of the Tragic Chorus these happening as from the nature of the thing they would do at the same time  Notes on the Art of Poetry  WITH DANCE AND FLOWING VEST EM∣BELLISHES HIS PART  Traxitque vagus per pulpita vestem  This expresses not only the improvement arising from the ornament of proper dresses but from the grace of motion not only the  actor  whose  peculiar office it was but the  minstrel  himself as appears from hence conforming his gesture in some sort to the music  Of the use and propriety of these gestures or dances it will not be easy for us who see no such things attempted on the modern stage to form any very clear or exact notions What we cannot doubt of is That the several theatrical dances of the antients were strictly conformable to the genius of the different species of composition to which they were applied That therefore the tragic dance which more especially accompanied the Chorus must have been expressive of the high∣est gravity and decorum tending to inspire ideas of what is  becoming graceful  and  majestic  in which view we cannot but perceive the important assist∣ance it must needs lend to virtue and how greatly it must contribute to set all her graces and attrac∣tions in the fairest light This idea of the an∣cient tragic dance is not solely formed upon our knowledge of the conformity beforementioned but is further collected from the name usually given to it which was  This word cannot well be translated into our language but expresses all that grace and concinnity of motion which the dignity of the choral song required Lastly it  must give us a very high notion of the moral effect of this dance when we find the severe Plato ad∣mitting it into his commonwealth  Notes on the Art of Poetry  HE WHO THE PRIZE A FILTHY GOAT TO GAIN  AT FIRST CONTENDED IN THE TRAGICK STRAIN  Carmine qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum  If I am not greatly deceived all the Editors and Commentators on this Epistle have failed to observe that the  historical  part of it relative to the Graecian Drama commences at this verse all of them sup∣posing it to begin lines further in the Epistle on the mention of Thespis whom Horace as clear∣ly as correctly describes to be the first  improver  not  inventor  of Tragedy  whose  ORIGINAL he marks  here  Much confusion has I think arisen from this oversight as I shall endeavour to explain in the fol∣lowing notes only observing in this place that the Poet having spoken particularly of all the parts of Tragedy now enters with the strictest  order  and greatest propriety into its general history which by his strictures on  the  CHORUS he most elegantly  as well as forcibly connects with his subject taking occasion to speak  incidentally  of other branches of the Drama particularly THE SATYRS  and the  OLD COMEDY    Soon tootho' rude the graver mood un∣broke  STRIPT THE ROUGH SATYRS  and essay'd a joke  Mox etiam  AGRESTES SATYROS  c  It is not the intention of these notes to retail the accounts of others I must therefore refer the reader for whatever concerns the history of the satiric as I have hitherto done of the tragic and comic drama to the numerous dissertators on the ancient stage and above all in the case before us to the learned Casaubon from whom all that hath been said to any purpose by modern writers hath been taken Only it will be proper to ob∣serve one or two particulars which have been greatly misunderstood and without which it will be impossible in any tolerable manner to explain what follows  I The design of the poet in these lines is not to fix the origin of the satyric piece in ascribing  the invention of it to Thespis This hath been concluded without the least warrant from his own words which barely tell us  "that the represen∣tation of tragedy was in elder Greece followed by the  satires  "  and indeed the nature of the thing as well as the testimony of all antiquity shews it to be impossible For the  satire  here spoken of is in all respects a regular drama and therefore could not be of earlier date than the times of Aes∣chylus when the constitution of the drama was first formed It is true indeed there was a kind of entertainment of much greater antiquity which by the antients is sometimes called  satyric  out of which as Aristotle assures us tragedy itself arose  But then this was nothing but a Chorus of satyrs Athenaeus l xiv celebrating the festivals of  Bacchus  with rude songs and un∣couth dances and had little resemblance to that which was afterwards called  satiric  which ex∣cept that it retained the Chorus of satyrs and turned upon some subject relative to Bacchus was of a quite different structure and in every respect as regular a composition as tragedy it∣self  II There is no doubt but the poem here dis∣tinguished by the name of SATYRI was in actual use on the Roman stage This appears from the turn of the poet's whole criticism upon it Par∣ticularly his address to the Pisos l and his observation of the offence which a loose dialogue in this drama would give to a  Roman  auditory l make it evident that he had in fact the practice of his own stage in view  III For the absolute merit of these satires the reader will judge of it himself by comparing the Cyclops the only piece of this kind remaining to us from antiquity with the rules here delivered by Horace Only it may be observed in addition to what the reader will find elsewhere  n  l apologized in its favour that the double character of the satires admirably fitted it as well for a sen∣sible entertainment to the wise as for the sport and diversion of the vulgar For while the grotesque appearance and jesting vein of these fantastic per∣sonages amused the one the other saw much fur∣ther and considered them at the same time as replete with science and informed by a spirit of the most abstruse wisdom Hence important lessons of civil prudence interesting allusions to public  affairs or a high refined moral might with the highest probability be insinuated under the slight cover of a rustic simplicity And from this in∣structive cast which from its nature must be very obscure if not impenetrable to us at this day was I doubt not derived the principal pleasure which the antients found in this species of the drama If the modern reader would conceive any thing of the nature and degree of this pleasure he may in part guess at it from reflecting on the entertainment he himself receives from the cha∣racters of the clowns in Shakespeare  who  as the poet himself hath characterized them  use their folly like a stalking horse and under the presentation of that shoot their wit  As you like it  Notes on the Art of Poetry  This learned note I think sets out with a mis∣apprehension of the meaning of Horace by involv∣ing his  instructions  on THE SATYRICK DRAMA with his account of its  Origin  Nor does he in the most distant manner insinuate tho' Dacier has asserted the same thing that  the  SATYRS owed their first in∣troduction to  Thespis  but relates that the very Poets who contended in  the GoatSong  to which TRAGEDY owes its name finding it too solemn and severe  an entertainment for their rude holiday audience interspersed the grave strains of tragedy with comick and  satyrical  Interludes producing thereby a kind of medley something congenial to what has appeared on our own stage under the name of TRAGICOMEDY Nor if I am able to read and comprehend the con∣text do the words of Horace tell us  "that the re∣presentation of Tragedy was in elder Greece  followed  by  the  SATYRS"  The Satyrs composed a part of the Tragedy in its infancy as well as in the days of Horace if his own words may be quoted as authority On any other construction his direc∣tions concerning the conduct of the  God  or  Hero  of the piece are scarcely reconcilable to common sense and it is almost impossible to mark their being incorporated with the Tragedy in more expressive terms or images than by his sollicitude to prevent their broad mirth from contaminating its dignity or purity  Effutire leves indigna  TRAGAEDIA  versus  Ut festis matrona moveri jussa diebus  INTERERIT SATYRIS  paulum pudibunda  PRO∣TERVIS  The  CYCLOPS of Euripides the only SATYRICK DRAMA extant written at a much later period than  that of which Horace speaks in this place cannot I think convey to us a very exact idea of  the Tragick Pastorals  whose  origin  he here describes  The  CY∣CLOPS scarce exceeding lines might be played according to the idea of some criticks after another performance but that cannot without the greatest violence to the text be supposed of the satyrick piece here mentioned by Horace The idea of  farces  or  afterpieces  tho' an inferior branch of the Drama is in fact among the refinements of an improved age The writers of an early period throw their dra∣matick materials serious and ludicrous into one mass which the critical chymistry of succeeding times separates and refines The modern stage like the antient owed its birth to the ceremonies of Religion From  Mysteries  and  Moralities  it pro∣ceeded to more regular Dramas diversifying their serious scenes like  the  SATYRICK POETS with lu∣dicrous representations This desire of  variety  was one cause of the  irregularity  as well as extraordi∣nary  length  of their pieces of which I believe they never gave above  one  at the same time of repre∣sentation  Farce  is in point of age as well as rank but a younger brother of the Theatre  Other Criticks have taken the text of Horace in the same sense that I have here considered it  AGRESTES SATYROS  Silvestres Faunos nudos in∣troduxit ita enim  SATYROS  vocantQuod vero  SA∣TYROS  in fabulos inductos dixi

tragoediae gravitatem    DE NORES  The distinction made by  De Nores  of  the  SATYRS not making a part of the Tragedy but barely ap∣pearing between the acts can only signify that the Tragick and Comick Scenes were kept apart from each other This is plain from his saying that they held the place of THE CHORUS not sustaining their continued part in the tragick dialogue but filling their chief office of singing between the acts The antient Tragedy was one continued representation divided into acts by the Chaunt of  the  CHORUS and otherwise according to modern ideas forming  but one act  without any interruption of the per∣formance  These antient SATYRICK SONGS with which the antient Tragedians endeavoured to enliven the Di∣thyrambicks gave rise to two different species of poetry Their rude jests and petulant raillery en∣gendered  the Satire  and their sylvan character pro∣duced  the Pastoral  THO' RUDE THE GRAVER MOOD UNBROKE  Stript the rough Satyrs and  ESSAY'D A JOKE  Agrestes Satyros nudavit asper  INCOLUMI GRAVITATE  jocum tentavit  It hath been shewn that the poet could not intend in these lines to  fix the origin of the sa∣tiric drama  But though this be certain and the dispute concerning that point be thereby deter∣mined yet it is to be noted that he purposely describes the satire in its ruder and less polished form glancing even at some barbarities which deform the Bacchic Chorus which was properly the satiric piece before Aeschylus had by his regular constitution of the drama introduced it under a very different form on the stage The reason of this conduct is given in  n  on l Hence the propriety of the word  nudavit  which Lambin rightly interprets  nudos intro∣duxit satyros  the poet hereby expressing the mon∣strous indecorum of this entertainment in its first unimproved state Alluding also to this ancient character of the  satire  he calls him  asper  i e rude and petulant and even adds that his jests were intemperate and  without the least mixture of gravity  For thus upon the authority of a very ingenious and learned critic I explain  incolumi  gravitate  i e rejecting every thing serious bidding  farewell  as we may say  to all gravity  Thus L iii O  Incolumi Jove et urbe Româ  i e  bidding farewell to Jupiter Capitolinus and Rome agreeably to what is said just before  Anciliorum et nominis et togae  OBLITUS  aeternaeque Vestae  or as SALVUS is used more remarkably in Martial l v  Ennius est lectus  SALVO  tibi Roma Marone  Et sua riserunt secula Moeonidem  Farewell all gravity  is as remote from the original sense of the words  fare well  as  incolumi gravitate  from that of  incolumis  or  salvo Marone  from that of  salvus    Notes on the Art of Poetry  The beginning of this note does not I think perfectly accord with what has been urged by the same Critick in the note immediately preceding He there observed that  the  "SATYR here spoken of is  in all respects  a regular Drama and therefore  could not be of earlier date  than the times of Aes∣chylus"  Here however he allows though in subdued phrase that  "though this  be certain and the dispute  concerning that point thereby determined  yet it is to be noted  that he purposely describes the Satyr  IN ITS RUDE AND LESS POLISHED FORM  glancing even at some barbarities which deform  THE BACCHIC CHORUS WHICH WAS PROPERLY THE SATYRICK PIECE  before  Aeschylus had by his regular con∣stitution of the Drama introduced it  under a very different form  on the stage"  In a subsequent note the same learned Critick also says that  "the connecting particle  verum    verum ita risores c  expresses the opposition intended between the  ori∣ginal Satyr  and that which the Poet approves"  In both these passages the ingenious Commentator seems from the mere influence of the context to approach to the interpretation that I have hazarded of this passage avowedly one of the most obscure parts of the Epistle  The explanation of the words INCOLUMI GRA∣VITATE in the latter part of the above note though favourable to the system of the English Commentary is not only contrary to the construction of all other interpreters and I believe unwarranted by any ac∣ceptation of the word INCOLUMIS but in my opi∣nion less elegant and forcible than the common in∣terpretation  The line of the Ode referred to  INCOLUMI  Jove et urbe Româ  was never received in the sense which the learned Critick assigns to it  The Dauphin Editor interprets it  STANTE  urbe Capitolino Jove Romanos protegente  Schrevelius to the same effect explains it  SALVO  Capitolio quae Jovis erat sedes  These interpretations as they are certainly the most obvious seem also to be most consonant to the plain sense of the Poet    For holiday spectators flush'd and wild  With new conceits and mummeries were be∣guil'd  Quippe erat  ILLECEBRIS  c  Monsieur Dacier though he allows that  "all that is here said by Horace proves  incontestibly  that the Satyrick Piece had possession of the Roman stage"  tout ce qu' Horace dit icy prouve  INCONTESTABLE∣MENT  qu'il y avoit des Satyres  yet thinks that Ho∣race lavished all these instructions on them chiefly for the sake of the ATELLANE FABLES The author of the English Commentary is of the same opinion  and labours the point very assiduously I cannot however discover in any part of Horace's discourse on  the  SATYRS one expression glancing towards  the  ATELLANES though their OSCAN peculiarities might easily have been marked so as not to be mistaken    That  GOD  or  HERO  of the lofty scene  May not c  Ne quicumque  DEUS  c  The Commentators have given various explana∣tions of this precept  De Nores  interprets it to sig∣nify  that the same actor who represented a God or Hero in the  TRAGICK  part of the Drama must not be employed to represent a Faun or Sylvan in the  SA∣TYRICK  Dacier  has a strange conceit concerning the joint performance of a  Tragedy  and  Atellane  at one time the same God or Hero being represented as the prin∣cipal subject and character of both on which occa∣sion says he the Poet recommends to the author not to debase the God or Hero of  the  TRAGEDY by sinking his language and manners too low in  the  ATELLANE whose style as well as measure should be peculiar to itself equally distant from Tragedy and Farce  The author of the English Commentary tells us that  "Gods and Heroes were introduced as well into the  Satyrick  as  Tragick  Drama and often the very same Gods and Heroes which had borne a part in THE PRECEDING TRAGEDY a practice which Horace I suppose intended by this hint to re∣commend as most regular"  The two short notes of Schrevelius in my opinion more clearly explain the sense of Horace and are in these words  Poema serium jocis  SATYRICIS  ita  COMMISCERE  ne scilicet is qui paulo ante  DEI  instar aut  HEROIS  in scenam fuit introductus postea lacernosus prodeat  On the whole supposing  the  SATYRICK  Piece  to be  TragiComick  as Dacier himself seems half in∣clined to believe the precept of Horace only re∣commends to the author so to support his principal personage that his behaviour in the SATYRICK scenes shall not debase the character he has sustained in the TRAGICK No specimen remaining of the Roman SATYRICK Piece I may be permitted to il∣lustrate the rule of Horace by a brilliant example from the  seriocomick  HISTORIES of the Sovereign of our Drama The example to which I point is the  character of  the  PRINCE  of  WALES in the two Parts of  Henry the Fourth  Such a natural and beautiful decorum is maintained in the display of that cha∣racter that the  Prince  is as discoverable in the loose scenes with Falstaff and his associates as in the Presence Chamber or the Closet After  the natural  though MIXT DRAMAS of Shakespear and Beau∣mont and Fletcher had prevailed on our stage it is surprising that our progress to  pure  Tragedy and Co∣medy should have been interrupted or disturbed by  the regular monster of  TRAGICOMEDY nursed by Southerne and Dryden  NE'ER WOULD I PISOS IN THE SYLVAN SCENE  USE ABJECT TERMS ALONE AND PHRASES MEAN  Nonego  INORNATA    DOMINANTIA  c  The author of the English Commentary proposes a conjectural emendation of Horace's textHONO∣RATA instead of INORNATAand accompanied with a new and elevated sense assigned to the word DOMI∣NANTIA This last word is interpreted in the same manner by  De Nores  Most other Commentators explain it to signify  common words  observing its ana∣logy to the Greek term  The same expression  prevails in our tongue  a  REIGNING  word a  REIGN∣ING  fashion  c The general cast of  the  SATYR seems to render a caution against a lofty stile not very necessary yet it must be acknowledged that such a caution is given by the Poet exclusive of the above proposed variation  Ne quicumque  DEUS  Migret in obscuras  HUMILI SERMONE  tabernas  Aut dum vitat humum  NUBES INANIA CAPTET    Davus may jest cDavusne loqua∣tur c  It should seem from hence that the common cha∣racters of Comedy as well as the Gods and Heroes of Tragedy had place in  the  SATYRICK DRAMA cultivated in the days of Horace Of the manner in which the antient writers sustained the part of Silenus we may judge from  the  CYCLOPS of Eu∣ripides and  the  PASTORALS of Virgil  Vossius attempts to shew from some lines of this part of the Epistle  Ne quicumque Deus c  that  the  SATYRS were  subjoined  to the Tragick scenes not  incorporated  with them and yet at the same mo∣ment he tells us and with apparent approbation that DIOMEDES quotes our Poet to prove that they  were BLENDED WITH EACH OTHER  simul ut spectator  INTER RES TRAGICAS SERIASQUE SATYRORUM QUOQUE JOCIS LUSIBUS  delectaretur  I cannot more satisfactorily conclude all that I have to urge on the subject of the SATYRICK DRAMA as here described by Horace than by one more short extract from the notes of the ingenious author of the English Commentary to the substance of which extract I give the most full assent  The Greek Drama we know had its origin from the loose licentious raillery of the rout of Bacchus indulging to themselves the freest sallies of taunt and invective as would best suit to law∣less natures inspirited by festal mirth and made extravagant by wine Hence arose and with a character answering to this original the  Satiric Drama  the spirit of which was afterwards in good measure revived and continued in the Old Comedy and itself preserved though with con∣siderable alteration in the form through all the several periods of the Greek stage even when Tra∣gedy which arose out of it was brought to its last perfection    To a short syllable a long subjoin'd  Forms an  IAMBICK FOOT  Syllaba longa brevi subjecta vocatur Iambus  Horace having after the example of his master Aristotle slightly mentioned the first rise of Tragedy in the form of a CHORAL SONG subjoining an ac∣count of  the  SATYRICK CHORUS that was soon MOX  etiam  combined with it proceeds to speak particularly of the Iambick verse which he has be∣fore mentioned generally as the measure best ac∣commodated to the Drama In this instance how∣ever the Poet has trespassed against  the order and method  observed by his philosophical guide and by that trespass broken the thread of his history of the Drama which has added to the difficulty and ob∣scurity of this part of his Epistle Aristotle does not speak of  the  MEASURE till he has brought Tra∣gedy through all its progressive stages from the Dithyrambicks down to its establishment by Aes∣chylus and Sophocles If the reader would judge of the  poetical beauty  as well as  logical precision  of such an arrangement let him transfer this section of the Epistle beginning in the original at v and ending at to the end of the th line by which transposition or I am much mistaken he will  not only disembarrass this historical part of it rela∣tive to the Graecian stage but will pass by a much easier and more elegant transition to the Poet's application of the narrative to the Roman Drama  The English reader inclined to make the expe∣riment must take the lines of the translation from v to v both inclusive and insert them∣after v  In shameful silence lost the pow'r to wound  It is further to be observed that this detail on  the  IAMBICK is not with strict propriety annext to a critical

the Critick refers before Tragedy acquired a per∣manent form under Aeschylus Thespis seems not only to have embodied  the  CHORUS but to have pro∣vided a theatrical apparatus for an itinerant exhibition to have furnished disguises for his performers and to have broken the continuity of  the  CHORUS by an  Interlocutor  to whom Aeschylus adding another per∣sonage thereby first created DRAMATICK DIA∣LOGUE while at the same time by a  further diminu∣tion of the  CHORUS by improving the dresses of the actors and drawing them from their travelling waggon to a fixt stage he created  a regular theatre  It appears then that neither Horace nor Aristotle ascribe  the origin  of Tragedy to THESPIS The Poet first mentions the rude beginning of Tragedy  carmen tragicum the  GOATSONG he then speaks of  the Satyrick Chorus  soon after interwoven with it and then proceeds to the  improvements  of these Bacchic Festivities by Thespis and Aeschylus though their perfection and final establishment is as∣cribed by Aristotle to Sophocles  DACIER very properly renders this passage  On dit que Thespis fut le premier qui inventa  UNE ESPECI DE TRAGEDIE AUPARAVANT INCONNUE AUX GRECS  "Thespis is said to be the first inventor of  a species  of Tragedy  before unknown to the Greeks  "  Boileau seems to have considered this part of the Epistle in the same light that I have endeavoured to place it  La Tragedie informe grossiere au naissant  N'etoit qu'un simple Choeur ou chacun en dansant  Et du Dieu des Raisins entonnant les louanges  S'efforçoit d'attirer de fertiles

law only abolished the  abuse  of the Chorus The ignominy lay in dropping the entire use of it on account of this restraint Horace was of opi∣nion that the Chorus ought to have been retained though the state had abridged it of the licence it  so much delighted in of an illimited and intem∣perate satire  Sublatus Chorus fuit  says Scaliger  cujus illae videntur esse praecipuae partes ut potissimum quos liberet laederent  Notes on the Art of Poetry  If Dacier be mistaken in this instance his mistake is common to all the Commentators not one of whom the learned and ingenious author of the above note excepted has been able to extract from these words any marks of Horace's predilection in favour of  a  CHORUS or censure of "its culpable omission" in Comedy De Nores expresses the general sense of the Criticks on this passage  TURPITER  Quia lex declaratâ Veteris Comoediae scriptorum improbitate eos a maledicendi licentiâ deter∣ruitSicuti enim antea summâ cum laude Vetus

hujusce Veteris differentiam  SUBLATO CHORO NOVAE  appellatae sunt  What Horace himself says on a similar occasion of the suppression of the Fescennine verses in the  Epistle to Augustus is perhaps the best comment on this passage  quin etiam lex  Poenaque lata malo quae nollet carmine quenquam  Describi  VERTERE MODUM FORMIDINE FUSTIS  AD BENE DICENDUM DELECTANDUMQUE RE∣DACTI    Daring their Graecian masters to forsake  And for their themes Domestick Glories take  Net nimium meruere decus vestigia Graeca  Ausi desererè celebrare domestica facta  The author of the English Commentary has a note on this passage replete with fine taste and sound criticism  This judgment of the poet recommending do∣mestick subjects as fittest for the stage may be inforced from many obvious reasons As that it renders the drama infinitely more  affecting  and this on many accounts As a subject taken from our own annals must of course carry with it an air of greater probability at least to the ge∣nerality of the people than one borrowed from  those of any other nation As we all find a personal interest in the subject As it of course affords the best and easiest opportunities of catch∣ing our minds by frequent references to our man∣ners prejudices and customs And of how great importance this is may be learned from hence that even in the exhibition of foreign charac∣ters dramatic writers have found themselves obliged to sacrifice truth and probability to the humour of the people and to dress up their per∣sonages contrary to their own better judgment in some degree according to the mode and man∣ners of their respective countries  "L'etude égale des poëtes de différens tems à plaire à leurs spec∣tateurs a encore influé dans la maniere de peindre les caracteres Ceux qui paroissent sur la scene Angloise Espagnols Françoise sont plus Anglois Espagnols ou François que Grecs ou Romains en un mot que ce qu'ils doivent être Il ne faut qu'en peu de discernement pour s'appercevoir que nos Césarts et nos Achiles en gardanr même un partie de leur charactere primitif prennent droit de naturalité dans le païs où ils sont transplantez semblables à ces portraits qui sortent de la main d'un peintre Flamand Italien ou François et qui portent l'empreinte du païs On veut plaire à sa nation et rien ne plait tant que le résemblance de manieres et de enie"  P Brumoy vol i p  And as the writer himself from an intimate acquaintance with the character and genius of his own nation  will be more likely to draw the manners with life and spirit  II Next which should ever be one great point in view it renders the drama more generally use∣ful in its moral destination For it being con∣versant about domestic acts the great instruction of the fable more sensibly affects us and the cha∣racters exhibited from the part we take in their good or ill qualities will more probably influence our conduct  III Lastly this judgment will deserve the greater regard as the conduct recommended was in fact the practice of our great models the Greek writers in whose plays it is observable there is scarcely a single scene which lies out of the confines of Greece  But notwithstanding these reasons the practice hath in all times been but little followed The Romans after some few attempts in this way from whence the poet took the occasion of de∣livering it as a dramatic precept soon relapsed into their old use as appears from Seneca's and the titles of other plays written in or after the Augustan age Succeeding times continued the  same attachment to Grecian with the addition of an equal fondness for Roman subjects The rea∣son in both instances hath been ever the same that strong and early prejudice approaching some∣what to adoration in favour of the illustrious names of those two great states The account of this matter is very easy for their writings as they furnish the business of our younger and the amusement of our riper years and more especially make the study of all those who devote themselves to poetry and the stage insensibly infix in us an excessive veneration for all affairs in which they were concerned insomuch that no other subjects or events seem considerable enough or rise in any proportion to our ideas of the dignity of the tragick scene but such as time and long admiration have consecrated in the annals of their story Our Shakespeare was I think the first that broke through this bondage of classical super∣stition And he owed this felicity as he did some others to his want of what is called the advantage of a learned education Thus uninfluenced by the weight of early prepossession he struck at once into the road of nature and common sense and with∣out designing without knowing it hath left us in his historical plays with all their anomalies  an exacter resemblance of the Athenian stage than is any where to be found in its most professed ad∣mirers and copyists  I will only add that for the more successful execution of this rule of celebrating domestic acts much will depend on the aera from whence the subject is taken Times too remote have almost the same inconveniences and none of the advan∣tages which attend the ages of Greece and Rome And for those of later date they are too much fa∣miliarized to us and have not as yet acquired that venerable cast and air which tragedy demands and age only can give There is no fixing this point with precision In the general that aera is the fittest for the poet's purpose which though fresh enough in our minds to warm and interest us in the event of the action is yet at so great a distance from the present times as to have lost all those mean and disparaging circumstances which unavoidably adhere to recent deeds and in some measure sink the noblest modern trans∣actions to the level of ordinary life  Notes on the Art of Poetry  The author of the Essay on the Writings and Ge∣nius of Pope elegantly enforces a like opinion and observes that Milton left a list of thirtythree sub∣jects for Tragedy all taken from the English An∣nals    Whether  THE GOWN  prescrib'd a style more mean  Or  THE INWOVEN PURPLE  rais'd the scene  Vel qui  PRAETEXTAS  vel qui docuere  TOGATAS  THE GOWN  Toga  being the common Roman habit signifies  Comedy  and THE INWOVEN PURPLE  praetexta  being appropriated to the higher orders refers to  Tragedy Togatae  was also used as a general term to denote all plays in which the habits man∣ners and arguments were ROMAN those of which the customs and subjects were GRAECIAN like the Comedies of Terence were called  Palliatae    But  YOU  bright hopes of the Pompilian Blood  Never the verse approve c  Vos O Pompilius Sanguis c  The English Commentary exhibits a very just and correct analysis of this portion of the Epistle but  neither here nor in any other part of it observes the earnestness with which the Poet on every new topick addresses his discourse to  the Pisos  a practice that has not passed unnoticed by other Commenta∣tors On this passage De Nores writes thus  Vos O Pompilius Sanguis    Per apostrophen  SER∣MONEM CONVERTIT AD PISONES EOS ADMONENS UT SIBI CAVEANT  ab hujusmodi Romanorum poetarum errore Videtur autem  EOS AD ATTENTIONEM EX∣CITARE  dum ait  Vos O  et quae sequuntur    Because  DEMOCRITUS  c  Excludit sanos Helicone poëtas Democritus  De Nores  has a comment on this passage but the ambiguity of the Latin relative renders it uncertain how far the Critick applies particularly to  the Pisos  except by the  Apostrophe  taken notice of in the last note His words are these  Nisi horum  DEMOCRI∣TICORUM  opinionem

of his enmity to Pompey  ON NATURE's PATTERN TOO I'LL BID HIM LOOK  AND COPY MANNERS FROM HER LIVING BOOK  Respicere exemplar vitae morumque jubebo  DOCTUM IMITATOREM  veras hinc du∣cere voces  This precept seeming at first sight liable to be interpreted as recommending  personal imitations  De Nores Dacier and the Author of the English Com∣mentary all concur to inculcate the principles of Plato Aristotle and Cicero shewing that the truth of representation  verae voces  must be derived from an imitation of  general nature  not from copying  indi∣viduals  Mankind however being a mere collection of  individuals  it is impossible for the Poet not to found his observations on particular objects and his chief  skill seems to consist in the happy address with which he is able to  generalize  his ideas and to sink the likeness of the individual in the resemblance of uni∣versal nature A great Poet and a great Painter have each illustrated this doctrine most happily and with their observations I shall conclude this note  Chacun peint avec art dans ce nouveau miroir  S'y vit avec plaisir ou crut ne s'y point voir  L'Avare des premiers rit du tableau fidele  D'un Avare souvent tracé sur son modéle  Et mille fois un Fat finement exprimé  Méconnut le portrait sur luimême formé  BOILEAU  L'Art Poet  ch iii  Nothing in the art requires more attention and judgment or more of that power of discrimina∣tion which may not improperly be called Genius than the steering between general ideas and indi∣viduality for though the body of the whole must certainly be composed by the first in order to communicate a character of grandeur to the whole yet a dash of the latter is sometimes necessary to give an interest An individual model copied with scrupulous exactness makes a mean style like the Dutch and the neglect of an actual model and the method of proceeding solely from idea has  a tendency to make the Painter degenerate into a mannerist  It is necessary to keep the mind in repair to replace and refreshen those impressions of nature which are continually wearing away  A circumstance mentioned in the life of Guido is well worth the attention of Artists He was asked from whence he borrowed his idea of beauty which is acknowledged superior to that of every other Painter he said he would shew all the models he used and ordered a common Porter to sit before him from whom he drew a beautiful countenance this was intended by Guido as an exaggeration of his conduct but his intention was to shew that he thought it necessary to have  some model  of nature before you however you deviate from it and correct it from the idea which you have formed in your mind of  perfect beauty  In Painting it is far better to have a  model  even to  depart  from than to have nothing fixed and certain to determine the idea There is something then to proceed on something to be corrected so that even supposing that no part is taken the model has still been not without use  Such habits of intercourse with nature will at least create that  variety  which will prevent any one's prognosticating what manner of work is to be produced on knowing the subject which is the most disagreeable character an Artist can have  Sir Joshua Reynolds's Notes on Fresnoy  ALBIN's HOPEFUL  Filius  ALBINI  Albinus was said to be a rich Usurer All that is necessary to explain this

We are now arrived at that portion of the Epistle which I must confess I am surprised that any Com∣mentator ever past without observing the peculiar language and conduct of the Poet There is a kind of awful affection in his manner wonderfully cal∣culated to move our feelings and excite our atten∣tion The DIDACTICK and the EPISTOLARY stile were never more happily blended The Poet assumes the air of a father advising his son rather than of a teacher instructing his pupils Many Criticks have thrown out a cursory observation or two as it were extorted from them by the pointed expressions of the Poet but none of them that I have consulted have attempted to assign any reason why Horace having closed his particular precepts addresses all the re∣mainder of his Epistle on the nature and expediency of Poetical pursuits to  the  ELDER PISO only I have endeavoured to give the most natural reason for this conduct a reason which if I am not deceived renders the whole of the Epistle interesting as well as clear and consistent a reason which I am the more inclined to think substantial as it confirms in great measure the system of the Author of the English  Commentary only shewing  the reflections on the Drama in  THIS EPISTLE as well as in THE EPISTLE TO AUGUSTUS to be  incidental  rather than the  prin∣cipal subject and main design  of the Poet  Jason De Nores  in this

the Pisos  All other Commentators apply it as surely the text warrants to  the  ELDER PISO In a long controversial note on this passage the learned Critick abovementioned also explains the text thus  "In fact this whole passage from  et vitae  c to  cantor Apollo  obliquely glances at the two sorts of poetry peculiarly cultivated by himself and is an indirect apology for his own choice of them For  vitae monstrata via est  is the character of his  Sermones  And all the rest of his  Odes  ""I must add the very terms of the Apology so expressly define and characterize Lyrick Poetry that it is something strange it should have escaped vulgar notice"  There is much ingenuity in this interpretation and it is supported with much learning and ability yet I cannot think that Ho∣race meant to conclude this fine encomium on the dignity and excellence of the Art of Poetry by a partial reference to the two particular species of it that had been the objects of his own attention The MUSE and APOLLO were the avowed patrons and inspirers of Poetry in general whether Epick Dramatick Civil Moral or Religious all of which are enumerated by Horace in the course of his panegyrick and referred to

caution against flatterers was addressed has before been observed by  Dacier  This description therefore growing immediately out of that caution must be considered as addressed to THE ELDER PISO    Leap'd  COLDLY  into Aetna's burning mount  Ardentem  FRIGIDUS  Aetnam insiluit  This is but a cold conceit not much in the usual manner of Horace    Whether the victim of incestuous love  THE

punishment for some heavy crime  HANGS ON HIM NE'ER TO QUIT WITH CEASELESS SPEECH  TILL GORG'D AND FULL OF BLOOD A VERY LEECH  The English Commentary introduces the explica∣tion of the last hundred and eleven lines of this Epistle the lines which I think determine the scope and intention of the whole in the following manner  "Having made all the reasonable allowances which a writer could expect he Horace goes on to enforce  the general instruction of this part viz  A DILIGENCE IN WRITING by shewing from l to that a  mediocrity  however tolerable or even commendable it might be in other arts would never be allowed in this"  "This reflexion leads him with great advantage from l to to  the general conclusion in view viz  that as none but excellent poetry will be allowed it should be a warning to writers HOW THEY ENGAGE IN IT WITHOUT ABILITIES OR PUBLISH WITHOUT SEVERE AND FREQUENT CORRECTION"  If the learned Critick here means that  "  the ge∣neral instruction of this part viz  A DILIGENCE IN WRITING is chiefly inculcated for the sake of  the general conclusion in view  a warning to writers HOW THEY ENGAGE IN POETRY WITH∣OUT ABILITIES OR PUBLISH WITHOUT SEVERE AND FREQUENT CORRECTION"  if I say a dis∣suasive from unadvised attempts and precipitate pub∣lication is conceived to be the main purpose and design of the Poet we perfectly agree concerning this last and important portion of the Epistle with this addition however on my part that such a dis∣suasive is not merely  general  but  immediately  and  personally  directed and applied to  the  ELDER PISO and that too in the strongest terms that words can afford and with a kind of affectionate earnestness particularly expressive of the Poet's desire to awaken and arrest his young friend's attention  I have endeavoured after the example of the learned and ingenious author of the English Commentary though on somewhat different principles to prove  "an unity of design in this Epistle"  as well as to illustrate  "the pertinent connection of its several parts"  Many perhaps like myself will hesitate to embrace the system of that acute Critick and as many or more may reject my hypothesis But I am thoroughly persuaded that no person who has considered this work of Horace with due attention and carefully examined the drift and intention of the writer but will at least be convinced of the folly or blindness or haste and carelessness of those Criticks however distinguished who have pro∣nounced it to be a crude unconnected immethodi∣cal and inartificial composition No modern I believe ever more intently studied or more clearly understood the works of Horace than BOILEAU His Art of Poetry is deservedly admired But I am surprised that it has never been observed that the Plan of that work is formed on the model of this Epistle though some of the parts are more in detail and others varied according to the age and country of the writer The first Canto like the first Section of  the Epistle to the Pisos  is taken up in general pre∣cepts The second enlarges on the Lyrick and  Elegiack and smaller species of Poetry but cur∣sorily mentioned or referred to by Horace but introduced by him into that part of the Epistle that runs exactly parallel with the second Canto of Boi∣leau's Art of Poetry The third Canto treats en∣tirely on the ground of Horace of Epick and Dra∣matick Poetry though the French writer has with great address accommodated to his purpose what Horace has said but collaterally and as it were in∣cidentally of the Epick The last Canto is formed on the final section the last hundred and eleven lines of  the Epistle to the Pisos  the author however judiciously omitting in a professed Art of Poetry the description of the Frantick Bard and concluding his work like the Epistle to Augustus with a com∣pliment to the Sovereign  This imitation I have not pointed out in order to depreciate the excellent work of Boileau but to shew that in the judgment of so great a writer the method of Horace was not so ill conceived as Scaliger pretends even for the outline of an Art of Poetry Boileau himself at the very conclusion of his last Canto seems to avow and glory in the charge of having founded his work on that of HORACE  Pour moi qui jusq'ici nourri dans la Satire  N'ose encor manier la Trompette la Lyre  Vous me verrez pourtant dans ce champ glorieux  Vous animez du moins de la voix des yeux  Vous offrir ces leçons que ma Muse au Parnasse  Rapporta jeune encor  DU COMMERCE D'HORACE  BOILEAU  After endeavouring to vouch so strong a testimony in favour of Horace's  unity  and  order  from France it is but candid to acknowledge that two of the most popular Poets of our own country were of a con∣trary opinion Dryden in his dedication of his translation of the Aeneid to Lord Mulgrave author of the Essay on Poetry writes thus  "In this ad∣dress to your Lordship I design not a treatise of Heroick Poetry but write  in a loose Epistolary way  somewhat tending to that subject  after the ex∣ample of Horace  in his first Epistle of the d Book to Augustus Caesar  and of that  TO THE PISOS which we call his ART OF POETRY In both of which  he observes  NO METHOD  that I can trace  whatever Scaliger the Father or Heinsius may have seen  or rather  THINK  they had seen  I have taken up laid down and resumed as often as I pleased the same subject and this loose pro∣ceeding I shall use through all this Prefatory  Dedication  Yet all this while I have been sailing with some side wind or other toward the point I pro∣posed in the beginning  "  The latter part of the comparison if the comparison is meant to hold throughout as well as the words  "  somewhat tend∣ing to that subject  "  seem to qualify the rest as if Dryden only meant to distinguish the  loose  EPIS∣TOLARY  way  from the formality of  a Treatise  How∣ever this may be had he seen the  Chart  framed by the author of the English Commentary or that now delineated perhaps he might have allowed that Horace not only made towards his point with some sidewind or other but proceeded by an easy navi∣gation and tolerably plain sailing  Many passages of this Dedication as well as other pieces of Dryden's prose have been versified by Pope His opinion also on the Epistle to the Pisos is said to have agreed with that of Dryden though the Introduction to his Imitation of the Epistle to Augustus forbids us to suppose he entertained the like sentiments of that work with his great prede∣cessor His general idea of Horace stands recorded in a most admirable didactick poem in the course of which he seems to have kept a steady eye on this work of our author  Horace still charms with graceful negligence  And WITHOUT METHOD  talks  us into sense  Will like a friend familiarly convey  The truest notions in the easiest way  He who supreme in judgment as in wit  Might boldly censure as he boldly writ  Yet judg'd with coolness tho' he sung with fire  His precepts teach but what his works inspire  Our Criticks take a contrary extreme  They judge with fury but they write with flegm  NOR SUFFERS HORACE MORE IN WRONG TRAN∣SLATIONS  By Wits  THAN CRITICKS IN AS WRONG QUOTA∣TIONS  Essay on Criticism  ☞ I have now compleated my observations on this popular Work of Horace of which I at first attempted the version and illustration as a matter of amusement but which I confess I have felt in the progress to be an arduous undertaking and a laborious task Such parts of the Epistle as cor∣responded with the general ideas of Modern Poetry and the Modern Drama I flattered myself with the hopes of rendering tolerable to the English Reader  but when I arrived at those passages wholly relative to the Antient Stage I began to feel my friends dropping off and leaving me a very thin audience My part too grew less agreeable as it grew more difficult I was almost confounded in the serio∣comick scenes of the Satyrick Piece In the musical department I was ready with Le Fevre to execrate the Flute and all the Commentators on it and when I found myself reduced to scan the merits and demerits of Spondees and Trimeters I almost fancied myself under the dominion of some  plagosus Orbilius  and translating the  prosodia  of the Latin Grammar Borrowers and Imitators cull the sweets and suck the classick flowers rejecting at pleasure all that ap∣pear sour bitter or unpalatable Each of them travels at his ease in the high turnpikeroad of poetry quoting the authority of Horace himself to keep clear of difficulties  et quae  Desperat tractata nitescere posse relinquit  A translator must stick close to his Author follow him up hill and down dale over hedge and ditch tearing his way after his leader thro' the thorns and brambles of literature sometimes lost and often benighted  A master I have and I am his man  Galloping dreary dun  The reader I fear will fancy I rejoice too much at having broke loose from my bondage and that I grow wanton with the idea of having regained my liberty I shall therefore engage an advocate to re∣commend me to his candour and indulgence and as I introduced these notes with some lines from a noble Poet of our own country I shall conclude them with an extract from a French Critick Or if I may speak the language of my  trade  as I opened these annotations with a  Prologue  from ROSCOMMON I shall drop the curtain with  an Epilogue  from DA∣CIER Another curtain now demands my attention I am called from the contemplation of Antient Ge∣nius to sacrifice with due respect to Modern Taste I am summoned from a review of the mag∣nificent spectacles of Greece and Rome to the re∣hearsal of a Farce at the Little Theatre in the Haymarket  Voila tout ce que j'ai cru necessaire pour l'in∣telligence de la Poetique d'Horace si Jule Sca∣liger l'avoit bien entendue il lui auroit rendu plus de justice en auroit parlé plus modestement  Mais il ne s'estoit pas donnê la temps de le bien comprendre Ce Livre estoit trop petit pour estre gouté d'un homme comme lui qui faisoit grand cas des gros volumes qui d'ailleurs aimoit bien mieux donner des regles que d'en recevoir Sa Poetique est assurément un ouvrage d'une erudition infinie on y trouve par tout des choses fort re∣cherchées elle est toute pleine de saillies qui marquent beaucoup d'esprit mais j'oserai dire qu'il n'y a point de justesse dans la pluspart de ses jugemens que sa critique n'est pas heureuse Il devoit un peu plus etudier ces grands maitres pour se corriger de ce defaut qui rendra toujours le plus grand savoir inutile ou au moins rude sec Comme un homme delicat etanchera mille fois mieux sa soif boira avec plus de goût de plaisir dans un ruisseau dont les eaux seront clairs pures que dans un fleuve plein de bourbe de limon tout de même un esprit fin qui ne cherche que la justesse une certaine fleur de critique trouvera bien mieux son compte dans ce petite traité d'Horace qu'il ne le trouverait dans vingt volumes aussi enormes que la Poetique de Scaliger On peut dire veritablement que celuy qui boit dans cette source pure  pleno se proluit auro  tant pis pour celuy qui ne sait pas le  connoistre Pour moi j'en ai un tres grand cas Je ne say fi j'auray esté assez heureux pour la bien éclaircir pour en dissiper si bien toutes les dif∣ficultés qu'il n'y en reste aucune Les plus grandes de ces difficultés viennent des passages qu'Horace a imité des Grecs ou des allusions qu'il y a faites Je puis dire au moins que je n'en ay laissé passer aucune sans l'attaquer je pour∣rois me vanter  nec tela nec ullas  Vitavisse vices Danaum  En general je puis dire que malgré la foule des Commentateurs des Traducteurs Horace estoit tresmalentendu que ses plus beaux endroits estoient défigurés par les mauvais sens qu'on leur avoit donnés jusques icy il ne faut pas s'en étonner La pluspart des gens ne reconnoissent pas tant l'autoritè de la raison que celle du grand nombre pour laquelle ils ont un profond respect Pour moy qui say qu'en matiere de critique on ne doit pas comptez les voix mais les peser j'avoüe que j'ay secoüé ce joug  que sans m'assujetir au sentiment de personne j'ay tâché de suivre Ho∣race de démêler ce qu'il a dit d'avec ce qu'on luy a fait dire  J'ay mesme toûjours remarqué  j'en pourrois donner des exemples bien sensibles que quand des esprits accoûtumés aux cordes comme dit Montagne qui n'osent tenter de franches allures enterprennent de traduire de commenter ces excellens Ouvrages  où il y a plus de finesse plus de mystere qu'il n'en paroist  tout leur travail ne fait que les gâter que la seule vertu qu'ayent leur copies c'est de nous dégoûter presque des originaux Comme j'ay pris la liberté de juger du travail de ceux qui m'ont précedé que je n'ay pas fait difficulté de les condamner tres∣souvent je declare que je ne trouveray nullement mauvais qu'on juge du mien qu'on releve mes fautes il est dissicile qu'il n'y en ait mesme beaucoup si quelqu'un veut donc se donner la peine de me reprendre de me faire voir que j'ay mal pris le sens je me corrigeray avec plaisir car JE NE CHERCHE QUE LA VERITV'E QUI N'A JA∣MAIS BLESS'E PERSONNE AU LIEU QU'ON SE TROUVE TOUJOURS MAL DE

We dare to bring you one of those bold Plays  Wrote by rough English Wits in former days  Beaumont and Fletcher those Twin Stars that run  Their glorious course round Shakespeare's golden Sun  Or when Philaster Hamlet's place supplied  Or Bessus walk'd the Stage by Falstaff's side  Their Souls wellpair'd shot fire in mingled rays  Their hands together twin'd the social Bayes  Till Fashion drove in a refining age  Virtue from Court and Nature from the Stage  Then Nonsense in Heroicks seem'd sublime  Kings rav'd in couplets and maids sigh'd in Rhime  Next prim and trim and delicate and chaste  A Hash from Greece and France came Modern Taste  Cold are her sons and so afraid of dealing  In Rant and Fustian they ne'er rise to Feeling  O say ye Bards of Phlegm say where's the name  That can with Fletcher urge a rival claim  Say where's the Poet train'd in Pedant Schools  Equal to Shakespeare who o'erleap'd all Rules  Thus of our Bards we boldly speak our mind  A harder task alas remains

grown familiar to our Stage  Here the Rialto often has display'd  At once a Bridge a Street and Mart of Trade  Here Treason threat'ning to lay Venice flat  Grave CandleSnuffers oft in senate sat  To night in Venice we have plac'd our scene  Where I have beenliv'ddiedas you have seen  Yet that my travels I may not disgrace  Let me since now reviv'ddescribe the place  Nor would the Tour of Europe prove our shame  Could every Macaroni do the same  The City's selfa wonder all agree  Appears to spring like Venus from the sea  Founded on Piles it rises from the strand  Like Trifle plac'd upon a silver stand  While many a lesser isle the prospect crowns  Looking like sugarplums or floating towns  Horses and mules ne'er pace the narrow street  Where crowded walkers elbow all they meet  No carts and coaches o'er the pavement clatter  Ladies priests lawyers nobles go by water  Light boats and Gondolas transport them all  Like one eternal party to Vauxhall  Now hey for merrimenthence grief and fear  The jolly Carnival leads in the year  Calls the young loves and pleasures to its aid  A threemonths Jubilee and Masquerade  With gaiety the throng'd piazza glows  Mountebanks Jugglers Boxers PuppetShows  Mask'd and disguis'd the ladies meet their sparks  While Venus hails the mummers of St Mark's  There holy friars turn gallants and there too  Nuns yield to all the frailties"Flesh is heir to"  There dear Ridottos constantly delight  And sweet Harmonic Meetings ev'ry night  Once in each year the Doge ascends his barge  Fine as a London Mayor's and thrice as large  Throws a huge ring of gold into the sea  And cries "Thus we thy sovereign marry thee  " Oh may'st thou ne'er like many a mortal spouse  " Prove full of storms and faithless to thy vows"  One word of Politicksand then I've done  The state of Venice Nobles rule alone  Thrice happy Britain where with equal hand  Three wellpois'd States unite to rule the land  Thus in the Theatre as well as State  Three ranks must join to make us bless'd and great  Kings Lords and Commons o'er the nation sit  Pit Box and Gallery rule the realms of wit  PROLOGUE To the Comedy of A WIFE IN THE RIGHT Written by Mrs GRIFFITH Spoken by Mrs BULKLEY  March  BY your leave Criticks'Tis a Female Play  A Female Prologue may prepare the way  Among the chronicles of modern fame  Who has not read of gentle Frances' name  Henry and Frances a fond loving pair  Whose soft epistles still amuse the fair  LETTERS BETWEEN MR AND MRS GRIFFITH under the names of HENRY and FRANCES  Some nights ago our couple all alone  A Fireside  tête à

Whether from passion love of pow'r or riches  Women we see all love to wear the breeches  At sea some madcaps enter volunteers  Some in the army list as grenadiers  Others write hist'ries stateintrigues unriddle  Ride the great horse and play upon the fiddle  Gently cries Frances truce with your reproaches  And mark which sex on t'other most encroaches  Soft silky coxcombs full of nice punctilio  All paste pomatum essence and Pulvilio  With huge bouquets like beaupots daily go  Trick'd out like dolls to pace in RottenRow  Thus flies the morning and the day to crown  To Quinze and Faro ev'ry fop sits down  Each coat so trim lest any speck fall on it  An apron guards each forehead a strawbonnet  Nay lest Rouleaus themselves should soil their ruffles  A  muffatee  each Pretty Master muffles  Women in vain to keep their place have striven  From ev'ry trade from each profession driven  MenMidwives swarm men mantuas make make stays  Dress hair dress meatlet women then write plays  While narrow prejudice deform'd the age  No Actress play'd no Female trod the Stage  Some smooth unrazor'd youth for Juliet rav'd  And kings sat waiting till the queen was shav'd  But Women once brought forward on the Scene  By man like Eve was lik'd as soon as seen  Let Females then compose as well as play  And strive to please you in the noblest way  No sulky Critick to the Playhouse

PROLOGUE On opening the THEATRE ROYAL at LIVERPOOL for the Winter Season Spoken by Mr YOUNGER  October  THE troops who lately shone in bright array  Proud on these plains their banners to display  Call'd to their posts in town by beat of drum  Aided with fresh recruits I hither come  I your old Serjeant once again appear  Happy to fix my Winterquarters here  Here where Goodhumour shews her smiling mien  And Judgment with fair Candour ever seen  Oh for a soul of flame that might inspire  Thro' all our ranks a truelymartial fire  But oh my breath is weak my words are vain  My efforts poor the mighty point to gain  What tho' in ev'ry breast strong ardours glow  On you alone their longing eyes they throw  Your frowns at once their noblest spirit damp  And strike a terror thro' our little camp  Yet if you smile again their hopes return  Again their souls with love of glory burn  Eager to fight to conquer or to fall  From first to hindmost  Pioneers and all  Nerveless and sinewless their arms 'tis true  But yet 'tis glory to contend for you  As some low hind whose poverty's confess'd  Receives beneath his roof some mighty guest  Dried winter fruits alas his only cheer  His only liquor some October beer  Makes up in welcome what he wants in store  Wishing his morsel better riches more  Spreads with a willing heart his humble board  And freely empties all his little hoard  So we too conscious of our homely fare  Trust to your smiles to snatch us from despair  Fall on with hearty stomachs to regale  Let not nice taste but appetite prevail  While we plain landlords a kind

had wit and gentlemen wrote plays  A rural 'squire was term'd a country Put  And the grave City was a standing butt  To town like oxen honest knights were led  To shew in droves huge antlers on their head  Gallants in quest of game cried  Eastward Hoe  And oft sprung Puss within the sound of Bow  While ev'ry 'prentice in the galleries chuckled  At London Alderman dubb'd London Cuckold  But now the times are chang'd and chang'd the jest  For Horns some say sprout nobly in the West  The murrain 'mongst horn'd cattle spreads so far  It rages on each side of Templebar  The modish citizen o'erleaps his ward  And the gay Cit plants Horns upon My Lord  While Beaux whose wives of flattery chew the cud  Are dupes fullblown or Cuckolds in the bud  Artists who furnish'd pictures for the stage  In good Queen Bess memorable age  With a just pencil Cityportraits drew  Mark'd ev'ry vice and mark'd each virtue too  The City Madam's vanities display'd  Prais'd honest gains but damn'd the tricks of trade  Artists like these Old Ben the chief tonight  Bring Idleness and Industry to light  Their Sketch by Time perhaps impair'd too much  A female hand has ventur'd to retouch  Hence too our Hogarth drew nor scorn'd to glean  The Comick stubble of the Moral Scene  Hence FellowPrentices he brought to life  And shew'd their manners and their fate at strife  Shew'd to what ends both Good and Evil stretch  To Honour one and t'other to Jack Ketch  Turn'd ridicule 'gainst folly fraud and pride  And sought with Humour's lance on Virtue's side  Such be henceforth each Comick Artist's aim  Poets or Painters be their drift the same  Such are the lessons which ToNight we read  And may next sessions prove that we succeed  PROLOGUE On opening the New THEATRE ROYAL at MANCHESTER Spoken by MR YOUNGER  October  IN days of old they say the Poet's Lays  Cities could build and mighty temples raise  When Orpheus play'd so powerful was his song  He drew stocks stones and savage beasts along  Amphion harp'd obedient to his call  The moving quarry jump'd into a wall  Verse of fair government first taught the plan  Religion Laws and Arts in Verse began  Thus fables tell and mystick truths they hide  For Arts and Freedom with the Muse abide  When fogs of ignorance o'erspread the land  Grim Persecution rules with iron hand  The social Arts to kinder climates fly  The Muses' Temples all in Ruins lie  But let the ray of Science chase the gloom  The plough the sail the shuttle and the loom  Plied by the sons of Industry bring in  The kindred Arts and Freedom's joys begin  Meanwhile wellpleas'd their triumphs to proclaim  The Muses celebrate and share their fame  And while their grateful incense seeks the skies  Temples and Theatres in splendor rise  Such be your boast here let the Muse retreat  Where Pallas long has fixt her fav'rite seat  If you upon our humble labour smile  In happy hour to Shakespeare rose this Pile  But if you frown our splendid Scenes decay  And all our baseless fabrick melts away  Our cloudcapt tow'rs our gorgeous palaces  Our mounts our woods our rivers and our seas  Our solemn temples and each solemn robe  That stuffs this wooden O this little globe  Shall fade and like the insubstantial wind  Or empty dreams leave not a rack behind  Smile then and for your clemency be prais'd  And oh support the Building you have rais'd  On that foundation must we rest

brushes fill'd his hand  But ah the Painter's skill they little knew  Nor by what curious rules of Art he drew  The waggonload unpack'd his ancient store  Furnish'd for each a face drawn long before  God Dame or Heroof the days of yore  The Caesars with a little alteration  Were turn'd into the Mayor and Corporation  To represent the Rector and the Dean  He added wigs and bands to Prince Eugene  The ladies blooming all deriv'd their faces  From Charles the Second's Beauties and the Graces  Thus done and circled in a splendid frame  His works adorn'd each room and spread his fame  The

In Buskins and Blank Verse the Stage to tread  On Pompeys and old Caesars rise to fame  And join the Poet's to th' Historian's name  The Comick wit alas whose eagle eyes  Pierce nature thro' and mock

The Fox the Alchymist the Silent Woman  " Done by Ben Jonson are out done by no Man"  Thus say in rough but panegyrick rhymes  The Wits and Criticks of our author's times  But now we bring him forth

Chapterfrom the Book of Nature  Wrote by a Woman too the Muses now  Few liberties to naughty Men allow  But like old maids on earth resolv'd to vex  With cruel coyness treat the other sex  PROLOGUE On the opening of the THEATRE ROYAL HAYMARKET  June  Spoken by MR PALMER  WITH broken Funds our Monarch meets the House  His  Board of Works  have left him scarce a souse  Poets and only Poets durst rehearse  In ancient times the mighty pow'rs of Verse  The Bards of old who built the lofty rhyme  Could build whole cities at the self same time  Amphion struck his lyreand at his call  Stone leap'd on stone and form'd of Thebes the wall  Oh for a Muse of fire in flames to smother  Our crazy Playhouse and create another  Our Poet Manager has no such skill  In comes the Carpenter's and Bricklayer's bill  Ev'n Opera now the power of Song has lost  And plung'd in Brick and Mortar feels their cost  By Italy betray'd she flies to France  And what she lost in Song makes up in Dance  No more from voice or ear her profits flow  The soul of Opera fixes in  Goose Toe  Since then St Vitus' Dance despotick reigns  The surest Succedaneum for the brains  Genius of Nonsense fill our empty places  Let us too  dance  ourselves into your graces  O'er the whole Haymarket in state preside  Nor let a Palsy seize our hapless side  To court thy smiles Farce shall learn  entrechat  And Tragedy shall caper  en grand pas  Crook'd Richard now shall frisk his passions mute  " To the lascivious pleasings of a Lute"  And in a cut of eight to make you stare  Macbeth shall catch the Dagger in the air  Tobine for life in minuet step shall beg  And Bowkitt scrape and  stand upon one leg  While Dancing shall remain the fav'rite rage  On these and arts like these must stand our Stage  But if some Whim shou'd "bid the reign commence  " Of rescu'd Nature and reviving Sense"  Again to Humour shall we bend our cares  And draw on Witto pay for our Repairs  PROLOGUE To the POSITIVE MAN A FARCE

 And in good sober sadness one word let me say  Do but think that the Schoolboys have broke up Today  Forgive them their frolicks and laugh at their play  In th' Imperative Mood should you view the

CURIOSITY on its Revival at the THEATRE ROYAL in the HAYMARKET  June  Spoken by Mr PALMER  LONG since beneath this humble roof this Play  Wrought by true English Genius saw the day  Forth from this humble roof it scarce has stray'd  In prouder Theatres 'twas never play'd  There you have gap'd and doz'd o'er many a piece  Patch'd up from France or stol'n from Rome or Greece  Or made of shreds from Shakespeare's Golden Fleece  There Scholars simple nature cast aside  Have trick'd their heroes out in Classick pride  No Scenes where genuine Passion runs to waste  But all hedg'd in by shrubs of Modern Taste  Each Tragedy laid out like garden grounds  One circling gravel marks its narrow bounds  Lillo's plantations were of Forest growth  Shakespeare's the sameGreat Nature's hand in both  Give me a tale the passions to control  " Whose slightest word may harrow up the soul"  A magick potion of charm'd drugs commixt  Where Pleasure courts and Horror comes betwixt  Such are the Scenes that we this night renew  Scenes that your fathers were well pleas'd to view  Once we halfpaus'dand while cold fears prevail  Strive with faint strokes to soften down the tale  But soon attir'd in all its native woes  The Shade of Lillo to our Fancy rose  Check thy weak hand it said or seem'd to say  Nor of its manly vigour rob my Play  From British Annals I the story drew  And British Hearts shall feel and bear it too  Pity shall move their souls in spite of rules  And Terror takes no lesson from the Schools  Speak to their Bosoms to their Feelings trust  You'll find their sentence generous and just  PROLOGUE To the COMEDY of The EASTINDIAN Spoken by Mr PALMER  July  WHEN the EastIndian gives our Play a name  With what a glow the Writer's breast should flame  What brilliant strokes thro' every Scene should run  Bright as ripe fruit the side that's next the Sun  Moguls and Nabobs should in judgement sit  O'er  Crores  of Humour and a  Lack  of Wit  In our cold climate we but vainly strive  To keep by hothouses such fire alive  And force by Art when Nature's at a stand  Dramatick Pine Apples at second hand  Methinks I hear some Alderman all hurry  Cry where's the  Pellow  Bring me out the  Curry  Be quiet says his lady silence man  Where's the  Old China  Show me the  Japan  Psha cries a Wit the Plot's an Indian Screen  The Muse shall enter in a  Palanquin    And lovers after many a foolish fray  In Love's  Pagoda  shall conclude the play  Our Poetess scarce blest with one Rupee  Invites the Criticks to a Dish of Tea  On India business she attempts to call  Voters and Orators from Leadenhall  And many a lady shrouded in a Shawl  Who rang'd in rows may bribe the Critick's eye  With a new Blanket Warehouse in July  Her Indian host or guest of this night's feast  Is just imported neat as from the East  His temper hot as Kayan taste uncouth  But full of Honour Honesty and Truth  Let the Committee on his Acts who sit  No fault that is not fairly prov'd admit  Take him for what he is humanely greet him  And like a stranger as you like him treat him  EPILOGUE To the CAPRICIOUS LADY altered from the SCORNFUL LADY of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER And acted at the THEATRE ROYAL COVENT GARDEN Spoken by Mrs ABINGTON  February  IN Fletcher's days it was the favourite plan  Of Woman to dethrone the tyrant Man  Our modern Fashions varyyet their aim  Howe'er pursu'd appears the very same  The StarchRuff'd Maidens of Queen Bess's reign  Were doom'd a Starch demeanour to maintain  Quill'd up like Porcupines they shot their darts  Slaughter'd whole rows of Knights and wounded Hearts  Their Virtue nought could shake no siege could alter  A rock impregnable as Gibraltar  In vain were sighs and tears and idle flattery  Their redhot balls laid low each hostile battery  While they bright stars above all weak comparison  Shone forth the Female Eliotts of the Garrison  The modern maiden finds things alter'd quite  A hundred Danglers not one faithful Knight  Nor coy nor cruel all her charms display'd  Coldly she's seen and trusting she's betray'd  Unfeeling coxcombs scorn the damsels pow'r  And pass in RottenRow the vacant hour  The Fair her power thus lost in single life  Reserves her policy till made a Wife  The humble married dames of Fletcher's day  Thought wives must love and honour and obey  Bound in the nuptial ring that hoop of Gold  Enchain'd their passions and their will controll'd  Too oft the modern Miss scarce made a bride  Breaks out at once all insolence and pride  Mounted in Phaeton she courts the eye  And eats and games and paints and dresses high  Who shall say nay Content to drink and play  His Lordship cries"My Lady take your way  I've fixt your box at the operabut am vext  That Polly Brilliant could not get the next"  Such was the rigid line of ancient rule  And such the freedom of the Modern School  Chuse which ye Fair or else to copy loth  Compose a new  Pasticcio  out of both  Or smit with nobler pride on Nature look  And read the brightest pages of her book  Would you a spotless maid chaste wife be known  Show the young Virtues ripening or full blown  Mark how they prop and dignify the Throne  Rival Their goodness with a loyal strife  And grace with Royal Virtues private Life  OCCASIONAL PROLOGUE On opening the THEATRE ROYAL HAYMARKET  May  Spoken by Mr PALMER  OF real Novelty we're told there's none  We know there's nothing new beneath the Sun  Yet still untir'd a Phantom we pursue  Still expectation gapes for something new  To whet your appetite and pique your taste  Each Bard serves some old dish in new PuffPaste  Crams with hard crusts the Literary Glutton  And like Lord Peter swears they're Beef and Mutton  Old Magazines each Manager too plunders  Like Quacks and Mountebanks cries Wonders Wonders  Detection scorns risks contradictions flat  Boasts a Black Swan and gives usa Black Cat  Two Magpies thus all Winter charms the ear  The selfsame note our Cuckow dwells on here  For We like Them our Penny Trumpets sound  And  Novelty  's the word the whole year round  What tho' our house be threescore years of age  Let us newvamp the Box newlay the Stage  Long paragraphs shall paint with proud parade  The gilded front and airy balustrade  While on each post the flaming bill displays  Our Old New Theatre and NewOld Plays  The Hag of Fashion thus all paint and flounces  Fills up her wrinkles and her age renounces  Stage answers Stage from other boards as here  Have Sense and Nonsense claim'd by turns your ear  Here late his jests Sir Jeffrey Dunstan broke  Yet here too Lillo's Muse sublimely spoke  Here Fielding foremost of the hum'rous train  In Comick Mask indulg'd his laughing vein  Here frolick Foote your favour well could beg  Propt by his genuine Wit and only Leg  Their humble follower  feels his merit less  Yet feels and proudly boasts as much success  Small though his talents smaller than his size  Beneath your smiles his little Lares rise  And oh as Jove once grac'd Philemon's Thatch  Oft of our Cottage may You lift the latch  Oft may we greet you full of hope and fear  With hearty welcome though but homely cheer  May our old roof its old success maintain  Nor know the  Novelty  of your disdain  EPILOGUE To the COMEDY called A FRIEND in NEED is a FRIEND INDEED Spoken by Mrs BULKLEY  July  WOMAN of all who feel the Hour of Need  Wants most most rarely finds a Friend Indeed  Doom'd in each sex alas by turns to prove  False hollow Friendship and insidious Love  Hogarth on whom sweet Humour's darling child  At once Minerva and Thalia smil'd  Whose pencil'd satire Vice and Folly smote  Who many a Comedy on canvas wrote  With coat tuck'd up straw hat and linen gown  Draws honest Marg'ry just arriv'd in town  With ruddy health and innocence she glows  Fresh as the morn and blooming like the rose  In the innyard a Hag who ready stands  Lays on the harmless maid her harpy hands  Too well the Beldam knows the treach'rous art  To tempt and to corrupt the female heart  Too soon to ruin she decoys her prey  " Then casts her like a loathsome weed away"  " Pooh pooh cries Citpup this is all a lie  " Poets and Painters will make freeOh fie  " Poor souls they love to bounce and think they railly  " Nothing but Truth and Honour in 'ChangeAlley  " Plump Marg'ry at a monstrous Premium went  " Prodigious interestalmost  Cent per Cent  " I found her poor not blest with Half a Crown  " Stampt her my own and brought her upon Town  " Made her as fine as hands or gold could make her  " Built her a Coacha grand onein LongAcre  " Marg'ry's good fortunes all on me depend  " I  ruin'd  herand am her only  Friend  "  Happy the highborn fair whose ample dower  Pours in her wealthy lap a Golden Shower  While many a friend sincere no doubt surrounds  Her thousand charmsand hundred thousand pounds  But she who pines in want whose early bloom  Deceit would canker or Distress consume  Let jealous fears her ev'ry step attend  And mark the Flatterer from the real Friend  He who with gold would bribe her into vice  Buys but her Honour at a dearer price  Not generous but prodigal and vain  A Bosom Traitor cruel not humane  But  He  whose virtuous hand her wants supplies  And wipes the tears of Anguish from her eyes  Who rears o'ercharg'd with grief her drooping head  And summons Hymen to the genial bed  Let Love and Gratitude his merits plead  And lodge him in her heart a  Friend indeed  PROLOGUE TO THE YOUNG QUAKER A COMEDY written by Mr O'KEEFFE Spoken by Mr PALMER  August  OLD Crab a Critick looking o'er our Bill  Thus vents his angry Spleen and rails his fill  "  A Comedy  The man's too bold by half  I can't bear Comedies that make me laugh  I doubt my friend he'll make both me and you sick  Farce is his province

true first woo'd the Publick here  And here their smiles have oft dispell'd his fear  Of sportive Farce he seem'd the fav'rite Child  And with a song your easy ears beguil'd  Tonight not dreaming of a grand essay  By some strange Meteor fancies led astray  He meant an Opera and produc'd a Play  Youthen  to the Orchestra  whose breath and resin'd bows in league  Have pip'd and scrap'd whole hours

Dramatick Pannel  Pit  Let not your mercy leave its ancient channel  If by some chance or impulseHeav'n knows whence  Our Bard quits Sound and wanders into Sense  If Wit and Humour on the surface flow  While solid Sense and Moral lurk below  Let him be pardon'd nor your verdict dread  Tho' Farce sometimes pops in her waggish head  By Mildness you shall teach him to succeed  And write hereafter  Comedies indeed  EPILOGUE To the YOUNG QUAKER Spoken by Miss FRODSHAM in the Character of DINAH  August  NO more nam'd Primrose I'm my Reuben's wife  And Dinah Sadboy I am call'd for life  There will I rest Though alter'd be my name  My faith and manners shall remain the same  Still shall my cheek show Nature's white and red  No cap shall rise like Steeple from my head  Powder pomatum ne'er my locks shall deck  Nor curls like Sausages adorn my neck  In leathern carriage though I sometimes go  I'll mount no lofty chaise in RottenRow  Me shall the eye of Wonder ne'er behold  In varnish'd vehicle all paint and gold  With liveried slaves behind in grand parade  All sticks bags lace brown powder and cockade  Drawn thro' the crowded Parkwhile at my side  The booted nobles of the nation

heart and full of Love  Such as to Reuben Dinah means to prove  Much art thou chang'd my ReubenBut 'twere strange  To wish thy faithful Dinah too might change  Wife of thy bosom ne'er shall I delight  To turn the night to day the day to night  The Vigils pale of Balls and Routes to keep  Or at the Cardtable to murther sleep  My mind shall still be pure my thoughts serene  My habit simple and my person clean  No pomps and vanities will I pursue  But love my home and love my husband too  PROLOGUE To the BIRTHDAY A COMEDY of Two ACTS Written by Mr O'KEEFE First acted at the THEATRE ROYAL in the HAYMARKET  August  Spoken by Mr PALMER  WHEN Fate on some tremendous act seems bent  And Nature labours with the dread event  Portents and Prodigies convulse the earth  That heaves and struggles with the fatal birth  In happier hours are lavish Blessings given  And pour'd in floods to mark the hand of Heaven  In a long series of bright glories drest  Britons must hail This Day supremely blest  First on This Day in Liberty's great cause  A BRUNSWICK came to guard our Rights and Laws  On this great Day our glorious annals tell  By British arms the pride of Cuba fell  For then the Moro's gallant chief o'erthrown  Th' Havannah saw his fate and felt her own  The selfsame Day the same auspicious morn  Our elder Hope our Prince our GEORGE was born  Upon his natal hour what triumphs wait  What captive treasures croud the palacegate  What doubled joys the Royal Parent claim  Of homefelt Happiness and Publick Fame  Long very long great George protect the land  Thy race like arrows in a Giant's hand  For still tho' blights may nip some infant rose  And kill the budding beauty ere it blows  Indulgent Heav'n prolongs th' illustrious line  Branching like th' Olive clustering like the Vine  Long very long thy course of glory run  A bright example to thy Royal Son  Forming that Son to grace like Thee the throne  And make his Father's Virtues all his own  PROLOGUE TO THE ELECTION OF THE MANAGERS Spoken by MR PALMER  June  " CURST be the verse how well so e'er it flow  That tends to make one worthy man my foe  Gives Virtue Scandal Innocence a Fear  Or from the softeyed virgin steals a Tear"  Thus sung sweet Pope the vigorous Child of Satire  Our Bayes less Genius boasts not less GoodNature  No poison'd shaft he darts with partial aim  Folly and Vice are fair and general game  No Tale he echoes on no Scandal dwells  Nor plants on  one  Fool's head the Cap and Bells  He paints the living Manners of the time  But lays at no man's door Reproach or Crime  Yet some with Critick nose and eye too keen  Scent doublemeanings out and blast each Scene  While squint Suspicion holds her treacherous lamp  Fear moulds base coin and Malice gives the stamp  Falsehood's vile gloss converts the very Bible  To  Scandalum Magnatum  and a Libel  Thus once when sick Sir Gripus as we're told  In grievous usury grown rich and old  Bought a good book that on a Christian plan  Inculcates  the whole Duty of a Man  To every sin a sinner's name he tack'd  And through the parish all the vices track'd  And thus the comment and the text enlarging  Crouds all his friends and

halffledg'd upon the Stage  Within this little Round the Parent Bird  Hath warbled oft oft patiently you heard  And as he strove to raise his eager throat  Your kind Applause made Musick of his note

Hopes his Fears how vain  'Tis You must hear and hearing judge the strain  Your equal Justice sinks or lifts his name  Your Frown's a Sentence your Applause is Fame  If Humour warms his scenes with

a solemn pause  Within these seas what various peril shocks  Dire Critick shoals and Actormarring rocks  Alas no chart or compass she can boast  Yet runs her vessel on a dangerous coast  That coast where late in spite of ev'ry sand  A greater Sigismunda gain'd the land  Yet Britain ever hails the cloth unfurl'd  And opens her free ports to all the world  Majestick navies in her harbours ride  Skiffs snows and frigates anchor by their side  And oh may now with no unprosp'rous gale  The Sigismunda spread her little sail  And while the Kemble follows fast behind  A Guardian in her Sister's

o'er his lines the vacant hour  Oft have you felt and own'd his Muse's pow'r  Now to this roof we bring his favour'd page  And force him halfreluctant to the Stage  The Stage where those who simple Nature paint  Fear lest their strokes too faithful seem too faint  For here the artist with a desperate hand  And broad poundbrush not pencil takes his stand  Anxious to make his cloth at distance

novelty all rivalship to smother  Play follows playone just as good as t'other  And now to lull the Dragons of the Pit  Two Connoisseurs take counsel Wit with Wit  As thieves catch thieves so Poet convicts Poet  Their plan's all wrongand I must overthrow it  I am an author too my name is Bayes  My trade is scribbling my chief scribbling Plays  Many I've written clapp'd by houses cramm'd  Acted with vast applauseand some few  damn'd    But ne'er tryed aught so Low or so Sublime  As Tragedy in Prose or Comedy in Rhyme  A Comedy in Rhyme the Thought's not new  'Twas tried long sinceand then it would not do  What happy point the dialogue can crown  Set to the hackneyed tune of Derrydown  What Pegasus in flight can reach the spheres  With bells like packhorse gingling at his ears  Smart Prose gives hit for hit and dash for dash  Joke after joke like lightening flash on flash  Retort so quick and repartee so nimble  'Tis all Prince Prettyman and sharp Tom Thimble  As the Piece stands no Critick could endure it  'Twould die but Bayes has a receipt to cure it  And little Bayes egad has long been known  To make the works of others all his own  Whate'er your piece'tis mine if you

LACY  September  WHEN first Pandora's box beneath whose lid  All Evils lay in dreadful ambush hid  Its treasur'd plagues let loose upon mankind  Hope only cordial Hope remain'd behind  Hope the sole balm of pain sole charm for grief  That gives the mind in agony relief  She with her sister Patience Heavenly pair  Teaches weak man the load of life to bear  As some poor mariner by tempest tost  Shipwreck'd at last and in the sea near lost  Cleaves to one plank and braving shoal and sand  Buoy'd up by Hope attempts to gain the land  Thus I my treasures on the waters cast  Guided by Hope seek here a port at last  Oh might I cast secure my Anchor here  Should Kindness sooth my Grief and ease my Fear  Warm Gratitude all anxious to repay  The soft restorers of my happier day  Within my

English Antients are agreed  A Maid of Honour is a Maid indeed  'Tis not alone among the virgin band  Demure behind the Chair of State to stand  To groan beneath the labours of the loom  A walking pageant of the Drawing Room  To hear the small talk of small lords in waiting  Or trifle with White Wands inclin'd to prating  No 'tis her province firmly to support  Intrench'd in the strong fences of a Court  That citadel where thousand dangers wait  And Female Honour holds her aweful state  Harmless with busy hum and empty sound  The silken CourtFlies buz and flutter round  They like Fulgentio are with scorn dismist  So weak 'tis scarce a triumph to resist  But when Bertoldos true blood Royal vie  Then then's the glorious effort to deny  To prove with all a woman's graces on her  She's still a Maid a real  Maid of Honour  Yet ah Camiola thy fate was hard  Severe the sentence of our rigid Bard  What nip a beauteous maiden in her bloom  And in a convent all her charms entomb  Consign her fortune blast her bud of youth  Though one swain's Falsehood proves another's Truth  While she like Cato finds from each adorer  " Her Bane and Antidote are both before her  Sicilian Maids of Honour thus were undone  Ah Maids of Honour act not thus in London  Here in chaste dew sweet roses hail the morn  Undoom'd to wither on the virgin thorn  Stern Romish doctrines strict Italian rules  Suit not the freedom of our British schools  Our wiser Law a sager code exhibits  Our milder Church such sacrifice prohibits  Should some false lord betroth'd his contract break  And at the altar's foot the maid forsake  In comes the Serjeant to distrain his lands  And while some young Adorni ready stands  In comes the readier Priest to join their Hands  Nay e'en the Widow who her lost love grieves  Here takes those  Thirds  our Maid of Honour leaves  Not Rome herself so dreadfully enthralls  E'en Eloisa 'twixt a nunnery's walls  Past joys with her dear Abelard recalls  Joys which her days of trial nobly past  May ev'ry Maid of Honour taste at last  PROLOGUE TO I'LL TELL YOU WHAT A COMEDY written by Mrs INCHBALD Spoken by Mr PALMER  August  LADIES and Gentlemen  I'll tell you what

roughly strike the lyre  But with the Feather raise a soft desire  Our Poetess has gain'd sublimest heights  Not Sappho's self has soar'd to nobler flights  For She bright spirit the first British fair  Climb'd unappall'd the unsubstantial air  And here beneath the changes of the Moon  Wond'ring you saw her launch a grand Balloon  While she with steady course and flight not dull  Paid a short visit to the Great Mogul  Alluding to the Farce of the MOGUL TALE    Shrink not Nabobs our Poetess tonight  Wakes not the Genius of Sir Matthew Mite  Beyond our hemisphere she will not roam  Keeps in

But a true patriot Female there's nothing so vexes  As this haughty preeminence claim'd 'twixt the sexes  The free spirit revolts at each hard proposition  And meets the whole system with loud opposition  Men 'tis true in their noddles huge treasures may hoard  But the heart of a Woman with  Passions  is stor'd  With Passions not copied from Latin or Greek  Which the language of Nature in plain English speak  Girls who grieve or rejoice from true feeling as I do  Never dream of Calypso or Helen or Dido  To the end of our life from the hour we begin it  Woman's Fate all depends on  the Critical Minute  A Minute unknown to the dull pedant tribe  And which never feeling they never describe  'Tis no work of Science or sparkle of Wit  But a point which mere Nature must teach us to hit  And which in the changes and turns of my story  A weak Woman's Pen has tonight laid before ye  And say ye grave Prudes gay Coquettes too ah say  What  a Critical Minute  was mine in the Play  Here Poverty Famine and Shame and Reproach  There Plenty and Ease and a Lord and a Coach  But perhaps our Bard held Mrs Euston too mean  And conceiv'd her disgrace would but lower the Scene  Let us then better pleas'd to acquit than convict her  On the ground of High Life sketch the very same Picture  Imagine some Fair plung'd in modish distress  Her wants not less than mine nor her agony less  At Hazard suppose an unfortunate cast  Has swept her last guinea nay more than her last  Her diamonds all mortgag'd her equipage sold  Her husband undone genteel friends looking cold  At her feet his sweet person Lord Foppington throws  The most handsome of Nobles the richest of Beaux  At once too his love and his bounty dispenses  Sooths with Thousands her grief lulls with Flatt'ry her senses  Alas what a Minute ah what can be done  All means must be tried and our Drama shows one  Let Papa in that Minute that so frowns upon her  Redeem the vile debts that encumber her Honour  Let Papa in that Minute that teems with undoing  Step in like my Father and mar a Lord's wooing  Let her know as I've known all the horror that's in it  And feel the true force of  the Critical Minute  Thus wishes our Bard as she bids me declare  And such is  my  wishBy mine Honour I swear  PROLOGUE At the opening of the THEATRE ROYAL HAYMARKET  June  Spoken by Mr BENSLEY  LE SAGE of life and manners no mean teacher  Draws an Archbishop once a famous preacher  Till apoplex'd at last his congregation  Smelt Apoplexy in each dull Oration  Our Chief alas since here we parted last  Has many a heavy hour of anguish past  Meanwhile by Malice it was said and written  His mind and body both at once were smitten  Alluding to a paragraph in the Publick Advertiser of November This couplet omitted at the

generous town  Sure that Misfortune never meets their Frown  Fam'd Pasquin his applauded predecessor  'Gainst Wit and Humour never a transgressor  Still cheer'd your vacant hour with jest and whim  When hapless chance depriv'd him of a limb  But you who long enjoy'd the tree's full shade  Cherish'd the Pollard and were well repaid  Shall then his Follower less your favour share  Or rais'd by former kindness now despair  No from your smiles deriving all his light  Those genial beams shall make his flame more bright  Warm Gratitude for all your kindness past  Shall sooth Disease and charm Affliction's blast  By Reason's twilight we may go astray  But honest Nature sheds a purer ray  While more by feeling than cold caution led  The  heart  corrects the errors of the  head  Cheer'd by these hopes he banishes all fear  And trusts at least you'll find  No Palsy here  PROLOGUE To the COMEDY of the DISBANDED OFFICER or The BARONESS of BRUCHSAL Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL HAYMARKET Spoken by Mr PALMER  August  IN days of old on Property and Trade  Taxes and rates unqualified were laid  But modern politicks with reins more lax  Comforts administer with every tax  Hold out  Douceurs  by way of compensation  And make the burthen light by  Commutation  Tea's now a drug so cheap with draughts be∣witching  Imperial Congou Hyson charm the kitchen  Bohea like Bull's blood in

Passions gag'd and Plots excis'd  What frauds would be unveil'd Sophistication  Much contraband and much adulteration  Neat as imported  is the constant boast  Though smuggling smacks and cutters croud the coast  At many a pilfer'd Scene you've cried and laugh'd  And oft for Homebrew'd Balderdash have quaff'd  Plays from French Vineyards drawn have learnt to please  Run like Southampton Port on Claret Lees  While the Bard cries to smuggling no great foe  " 'Tis English English Sirs from Top to Toe"  Tonight a new Advent'rer vents his Stock  And brings you from the Rhine some good Old Hock  Waves but his wanda true Dramatick Merlin  Presto  you're charm'd from Londonplac'd in Berlin  There lies our Scene Tonightan hour or two  True Prussians we must do as Prussians do  Our goods our habits are of German growth  Both fairly enter'd and acknowledg'd both  Lessing  a German Bard of high renown  Long on the Continent has charm'd the town  His Plays as much applauded at Vienna  As here the School for Scandal or Duenna  From his bold outline draws our present Bayes  And on his canvas English colours lays  Rumbling and rough tho' Bruchsal's name appear  Grating harsh thunder on an English ear  Yet she may charm and prove ere she departs  That Ladies with hard Names have tender Hearts  PROLOGUE To the COMEDY of TIT for TAT Acted at the THEATRE ROYAL HAYMARKET Spoken by Mr PALMER  August  LONG hath Old England given as from the helm  Dramatick Law to every Sister realm  Scotland her Theatres delights to rear  But for Supplies for Ways and Means looks here  Hibernia too improves the friendly hint  " A new Play Honey sait there's nothing in't  " For we have all their manuscripts in print"  Teague speaks but truth Across St George's Channel  John Bull in vain his juries would impannel  In vain expects grave Chancellors to sit  And guard by Equity the Rights of Wit  While distant Managers feel no compunctions  And laugh alike at Actions or Injunctions  Yet to be just ourselves we own Today  That from Hibernia comes our printed Play  A Play first flowing from a Frenchman's pen  Cork'd bottled there decanted here again  Three Acts in Paris kept the Scenes alive  And those three Acts in Dublin swell'd to five  Le Jeu de l'Amour du Hazard  a Comedy of Marevaux    But Dwarfs ne'er treading Giants' Causeways We  Lop off two legs and rest again on three  Oh on our Tripod may we firmly stand  And hail like them our cargo safe on land  French Irish English whatso'er the freight  Your sentence stamps its merit seals its fate  PROLOGUE To the FARCE of the MANMILLINER  February  Enter hastily Mrs  Mattocks  with a band box  FORGIVE me Sirs that I come in thus bounce  You know me Ladies  your old friend  La Flounce  Sov'reign of Fancy Regent of the Mode  To all your wants and wishes  toute commode    For artificial sprigs a Winter Flora  With  rouge  that gives the blushes of Aurora  A Woman Milliner for sure no  Man  Would  be a Milliner or ever  can  Horse  Milliner indeed a Man's true trade is  But saucy grooms such trappings suit not ladies  Yet Men assail our persons several ways  They make our Mantuas and they make our Stays  And though to  CurryCombs  we scorn to truckle  They frize toupees and give the locks their buckle  Hence strange reverses rise and we're betray'd  By turns their neighbour province to invade  Husbands the Distaff take Wives seize the Club  At home their patient Hercules to drub  While  Sir  appears so feminine and trim  And  Madam  looks so masculine and grim  You scarce know  him  from  her  or  her  from  him  In changes thus if humbler ranks should strive  Maid servants soon will mount the Box and drive  Or else to Reason and Decorum blind  Seising a place unfit for womankind  With flambeaux in their hands jump up  behind  While Footmen women grown as now grown Fops  Shall darn old hose sweep rooms and trundle mops  Ladies and Gentlemen 'tis your's tonight  To end disputes and set the sexes right  To check the inroads of the Tyrant Man  And keep within due bounds the Woman's Plan  Let me then as a Female Envoy greet ye  And here negociate a Commercial Treaty  Forbid the Men by some restraining

half afraid to venture  Advancing  "  Be your eyes wet yes faith  nay truce with sorrow  Julia's quite well and dies again Tomorrow  Tomorow  did I say Tomorrow's Sunday  So if you please she'll die again on Monday  I've heard the Tragedy with strict attention  The Tale they say is fact and no invention  And while deep Criticks ponder on its merits  I'll tell you how it acted on my spirits  As by the Scenes I took my silent stand  Each Act that past I hail'd this happy land  Bards who from history or fiction glean  Rarely in England place the Tragick Scene  Led by the Muse they sail o'er distant seas  Scale Alps on Alps or pierce the Pyrenees  Abroad in search of  Cruelties  they roam  Follies and Frailties may be found at home  Passions in warmer climes that fiercely burn  Here lose their rancour and to humours turn  Not cank'ring inwards with a treach'rous stealth  Break nobly out and keep the soul in health  No Lovers here contending for a Wife  Mix pois'nous bowls or draw the murd'rer's knife  No Julia here should find her virgin fame  Arraign'd for crimes she shudders but to name  Safe from such horrors in a generous nation  Where Madness only dreams Assassination  No tho' the moonlight walk and precious Picture  Conspire with jealous Fulvia to convict her  Tried fairly tried in our High Court of Drury  She'll stand acquitted by an English Jury  Wise was the man who each returning morn  Thank'd his kind stars he was in England born  And wiser still the Fair that lot possessing  Who proves she knows the value of the Blessing  With pity who beholds poor Julia's fate  Yet prizes as she ought  her  happier state  The charms of English worth who can discover  And never wish for  an Italian Lover  ☞ I did not know that the pen of Malice or Slander had ascribed the suppression of this Epilogue at the Theatre to the pretended  Indelicacy  of its  contents till I had seen the generous Vindication of it by another hand The Epilogue was written at the particular instance of a very worthy friend of Mr Jephson by whom and by the author it was received with cordial thanks and the warmest appro∣bation Mrs Siddons however seeming to expect the Epilogue her Importance to the Piece rendered the friends of the Author unwilling to question her Claim and a few alterations were made in the in∣troductory lines which the change of the Supposed Speaker required  Supposed  for Mrs Siddons after keeping the Epilogue some days returned it with a declaration that she would not speak it and a request of another The alterations with an ad∣ditional couplet occurred between the th and th lines and are here subjoined with the variations printed in Italicks  You've  heard the tragedy with due attention  The tale they say is fact and no invention  How ill our Bard has touch'd it or how well  Many sage Criticks will precisely tell  Let me then while they  ponder on its merits  Say how it mov'd a Patriot Female's spirits  While crimes like these on foreign records stand  How warmly must we hail  this happy land  PROLOGUES AT WYNNSTAY  PROLOGUE TO THE BEGGARS BUSH Spoken at WYNNSTAY  Christmas  THE Muse that charms the polish'd City now  Deriv'd her birth from rusticks and the plow  Their labours o'er the honest country folks  Indulg'd in laughter and enjoy'd their jokes  Found mirth the  Lethe  of the troubled soul  And bath'd their sorrows in the genial bowl  Still windingup wellpleas'd the toilsome year  With sports and games religion and good cheer  Now at our call from London routs and drums  Back to her rural home Thalia comes  While Harlequin in town the Christmas keeps  To Wales unheeded and  incog  she creeps  Who can in hospitality surpass us  There our Welch Mountains tow'r o'er Mount Parnassus  Oh welcome then the Muse for

engage  That some folks here have travell'd in the Stage  Jamm'd in at midnight in cold winter weather  The crouded passengers are glew'd together  O'er many a rut and illpav'd causeway jumbling  They pass their Journey justling jolting grumbling  Sometimes a pleasing prospect strikes the eye  Sometimes they chuckle when a good inn's nigh  'Till many a squabble some endearments past  They part wellpleas'd and with regret at last  So in our Stage in which this Christmas Tide  As inside passengers you've deign'd to ride  You thought yourselves perhaps not well convey'd  The cattle brokenwinded roads ill made  Yet fond of travel some kind looks you bend  Tow'rds fellow trav'llers at your journey's end  May each whom pleasure call'd awhile to roam  Find double pleasure when arriv'd at home  May each kind husband meet a wife more kind  And each fond wife a fonder husband find  Meanwhile Oh think not  Us  beneath your care  Nor drive your humble drivers to despair  Shall Posthumus his Imogen restor'd  Be doom'd to wail his destiny deplor'd  Shall Jachimo who oft your cares beguil'd  Be left to crybecause you never smil'd  Noyou will grant a smilenor only kind  To honest Coachmen cheer ev'n those  behind  For who can well deny if they but ask it  To pity the poor devils in the Basket  Rosina all resistless pleads her cause  And with her Sirensong extorts applause  But give poor Doctor Bartholo a plaister  And with  Allegros  cheer your Musick Master  To mirth let Argus Tall Boy stir your bloods  Nor leave the Spanish Barber in the Suds  And if youv'e past your time with some delight  Bid Basil  go to bed  and bid  Good Night  PROLOGUE Spoken at WYNNSTAY  Christmas  PLEASURE dear Pleasure is the gen'ral aim  Various the means but still the ends the same  Partial to that he seeks with eager haste  Each damns alike his neighbour's want of Taste  One thro' the DevilsDitch pursues the Race  One breaks his neck in following the Chace  Come here' sa Bumper says Sir John half drunk  Damn ye d'ye flinch have ye no Soul no Spunk  Away with business and confound all thinking  No joy in life to be compar'd to drinking  Yes says Lord Feeble verging on threescore  I like a Bottle but I love a Whore  For me I left poor little Sally weeping  And have besides three other girls in keeping  Stick you to Bacchus and I'll stick to Venus  And we'll divide the Two Gay Pow'rs between us  The joys of Dress alone Sir Fopling feels  And all his passions center in red heels  Or buoy'd by Vanity to reach his head  There with her feathers join his native lead  Thus others' follies lightly touch'd and shewn  We hope in turn indulgence for our own  Now Fashion sends her liv'ried lacqueys out  With cards to call all London to a Rout  Meanwhile to Antient Britons from Wynnstay  Our Host distributes tickets for a Play  You then who deign for some few hours to quit  Your fireside humour and domestick wit  Who though the weather's cold and roads are rough  Leave your HotCockles and your Blindman's Buff  With looks well pleas'd bring in the newborn year  And laughing join our Christmas Gambols here  PROLOGUE Spoken at WYNNSTAY  January  LADIES AND GENTLEMEN  I Am a poor Strolling Playerand my hapless condition  Obliges me to wait upon you with my Humble Petition  Thro' England South Wales and North Wales  I have travell'd many years since  And represented Lover and Hero Wit and Fool  Statesman and Cuckold Beggar and Prince  Nay more than Roscius Betterton Booth or Garrick himself could say  I have acted every partwomen as well as menevery part in every play  Not long ago at Oswestry we did the falchion wield  Now near this place we pitch our tentvery near hereeven in Wrexham  Field    By Metaphor I say  Field  for in fact at a very great expence  We have fitted up the Town Hall and for the first time made it the Theatre of Common Sense  Our bills all honestly paid now new dangers we essay  Rival Strollers have arisen and are resolv'd to exhibit at Wynnstay  And what I am sure in our cause will make you very hearty  The little Manager from the Haymarket is one of the party  They call themselves  Gentlemen  indeed but still I say so much the worse  For when Gentlemen act unlike Gentlemen 'tis a private and a publick curse  Why should a Gentleman pretend to more than he understands  Take the bread out of our mouths and our trade out of our hands  All arts are best executed by the artists themselves  Gentlemen Artists are mostly mere Dabblers and ignorant Elves  Says Sir John his round hat on his head a Quid in his mouth and long Whip in his hand  I'll drive you my Dear at the door see the horses and Phaeton stand  From high steps to the Chaise Sir John and the Lady mount three pair of stairs  While the Mob in the street at the Cavalcade stares  Chuck chuckoff they goJehu oight oight till at some sudden pitch  Sir John and the Lady come souse in a ditch  Such are Baronet Drivers and thus Country Squires hunt a pack or ride matches  Thus Generals write plays and thus Nobles sing Catches  Thus tonight a Welch Baronet and his Friends give a play  And promise Dramaticks for the whole week to come at Wynnstay  With  Rule a Wife and Have a Wife  The Entertainments of the Season  they mean to make you sick  And turn  Shakespeare's Great Richard  The Entertainments of the Season  to tiny King  Dick  Of  BonTon  The Entertainments of the Season  they'll give you much more than you desire  And when they promise entertainment no doubt they'll play the  Liar  The Entertainments of the Season  But after all Ladies and Gentlemen Peace is our plan  And we wish to compromise this matter if we can  They have given some reasons which I think will hold water  They have had a Christening it seems and Sir  Watkin has got another daughter  Besides the Former Worthy Mistress of this place  Now deigns with her presence their Gambols to grace  Since the Country's call'd in we're determin'd not to vex 'em  And so for this week have shut up our fine Theatre at Wrexham  But since for this week we agree to lie mum  You'll  fill  us no doubt for a fortnight to come  FINIS  SCHOOL LIBRARY AT DR CHARLES
